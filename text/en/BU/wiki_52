<text>In electrophysiology, the threshold potential is the critical level to which a membrane potential must be depolarized to initiate an action potential. In neuroscience, threshold potentials are necessary to regulate and propagate signaling in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

Most often, the threshold potential is a membrane potential value between –50 and –55 mV, but can vary based upon several factors. A neuron&#x27;s resting membrane potential (–70 mV) can be altered to either increase or decrease likelihood of reaching threshold via sodium and potassium ions. An influx of sodium into the cell through open, voltage-gated sodium channels can depolarize the membrane past threshold and thus excite it while an efflux of potassium or influx of chloride can hyperpolarize the cell and thus inhibit threshold from being reached.

==Discovery==
Initial experiments revolved around the concept that any electrical change that is brought about in neurons must occur through the action of ions. The German physical chemist Walther Nernst applied this concept in experiments to discover nervous excitability, and concluded that the local excitatory process through a semi-permeable membrane depends upon the ionic concentration. Also, ion concentration was shown to be the limiting factor in excitation. If the proper concentration of ions was attained, excitation would certainly occur. This was the basis for discovering the threshold value.

Along with reconstructing the action potential in the 1950s, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley were also able to experimentally determine the mechanism behind the threshold for excitation. It is known as the Hodgkin–Huxley model. Through use of voltage clamp techniques on a squid giant axon, they discovered that excitable tissues generally exhibit the phenomenon that a certain membrane potential must be reached in order to fire an action potential. Since the experiment yielded results through the observation of ionic conductance changes, Hodgkin and Huxley used these terms to discuss the threshold potential. They initially suggested that there must be a discontinuity in the conductance of either sodium or potassium, but in reality both conductances tended to vary smoothly along with the membrane potential.

They soon discovered that at threshold potential, the inward and outward currents, of sodium and potassium ions respectively, were exactly equal and opposite. As opposed to the resting membrane potential, the threshold potential&#x27;s conditions exhibited a balance of currents that were unstable. Instability refers to the fact that any further depolarization activates even more voltage-gated sodium channels, and the incoming sodium depolarizing current overcomes the delayed outward current of potassium. At resting level, on the other hand, the potassium and sodium currents are equal and opposite in a stable manner, where a sudden, continuous flow of ions should not result. The basis is that at a certain level of depolarization, when the currents are equal and opposite in an unstable manner, any further entry of positive charge generates an action potential. This specific value of depolarization (in mV) is otherwise known as the threshold potential.

==Physiological function and characteristics==
The threshold value controls whether or not the incoming stimuli are sufficient to generate an action potential. It relies on a balance of incoming inhibitory and excitatory stimuli. The potentials generated by the stimuli are additive, and they may reach threshold depending on their frequency and amplitude. Normal functioning of the central nervous system entails a summation of synaptic inputs made largely onto a neuron&#x27;s dendritic tree. These local graded potentials, which are primarily associated with external stimuli, reach the axonal initial segment and build until they manage to reach the threshold value. The larger the stimulus, the greater the depolarization, or attempt to reach threshold. The task of depolarization requires several key steps that rely on anatomical factors of the cell. The ion conductances involved depend on the membrane potential and also the time after the membrane potential changes.

===Resting membrane potential===
The phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane is, in itself, highly impermeable to ions. The complete structure of the cell membrane includes many proteins that are embedded in or completely cross the lipid bilayer. Some of those proteins allow for the highly specific passage of ions, ion channels. Leak potassium channels allow potassium to flow through the membrane in response to the disparity in concentrations of potassium inside (high concentration) and outside the cell (low). The loss of positive(+) charges of the potassium(K+) ions from the inside of the cell results in a negative potential there compared to the extracellular surface of the membrane. A much smaller &quot;leak&quot; of sodium(Na+) into the cell results in the actual resting potential, about –70 mV, being less negative than the calculated potential for K+ alone, the equilibrium potential, about –90 mV. The sodium-potassium ATPase is an active transporter within the membrane that pumps potassium (2 ions) back into the cell and sodium (3 ions) out of the cell, maintaining the concentrations of both ions as well as preserving the voltage polarization.

===Depolarization===
However, once a stimulus activates the voltage-gated sodium channels to open, positive sodium ions flood into the cell and the voltage increases. This process can also be initiated by ligand or neurotransmitter binding to a ligand-gated channel. More sodium is outside the cell relative to the inside, and the positive charge within the cell propels the outflow of potassium ions through delayed-rectifier voltage-gated potassium channels. Since the potassium channels within the cell membrane are delayed, any further entrance of sodium activates more and more voltage-gated sodium channels. Depolarization above threshold results in an increase in the conductance of Na sufficient for inward sodium movement to swamp outward potassium movement immediately. If the influx of sodium ions fails to reach threshold, then sodium conductance does not increase a sufficient amount to override the resting potassium conductance. In that case, subthreshold membrane potential oscillations are observed in some type of neurons. If successful, the sudden influx of positive charge depolarizes the membrane, and potassium is delayed in re-establishing, or hyperpolarizing, the cell. Sodium influx depolarizes the cell in attempt to establish its own equilibrium potential (about +52 mV) to make the inside of the cell more positive relative to the outside.

===Variations===
The value of threshold can vary according to numerous factors. Changes in the ion conductances of sodium or potassium can lead to either a raised or lowered value of threshold. Additionally, the diameter of the axon, density of voltage activated sodium channels, and properties of sodium channels within the axon all affect the threshold value. Typically in the axon or dendrite, there are small depolarizing or hyperpolarizing signals resulting from a prior stimulus. The passive spread of these signals depend on the passive electrical properties of the cell. The signals can only continue along the neuron to cause an action potential further down if they are strong enough to make it past the cell&#x27;s membrane resistance and capacitance. For example, a neuron with a large diameter has more ionic channels in its membrane than a smaller cell, resulting in a lower resistance to the flow of ionic current. The current spreads quicker in a cell with less resistance, and is more likely to reach the threshold at other portions of the neuron.

The threshold potential has also been shown experimentally to adapt to slow changes in input characteristics by regulating sodium channel density as well as inactivating these sodium channels overall. Hyperpolarization by the delayed-rectifier potassium channels causes a relative refractory period that makes it much more difficult to reach threshold. The delayed-rectifier potassium channels are responsible for the late outward phase of the action potential, where they open at a different voltage stimulus compared to the quickly activated sodium channels. They rectify, or repair, the balance of ions across the membrane by opening and letting potassium flow down its concentration gradient from inside to outside the cell. They close slowly as well, resulting in an outward flow of positive charge that exceeds the balance necessary. It results in excess negativity in the cell, requiring an extremely large stimulus and resulting depolarization to cause a response.

==Tracking techniques==
Threshold tracking techniques test nerve excitability, and depend on the properties of axonal membranes and sites of stimulation. They are extremely sensitive to the membrane potential and changes in this potential. These tests can measure and compare a control threshold (or resting threshold) to a threshold produced by a change in the environment, by a preceding single impulse, an impulse train, or a subthreshold current. Measuring changes in threshold can indicate changes in membrane potential, axonal properties, and/or the integrity of the myelin sheath.

Threshold tracking allows for the strength of a test stimulus to be adjusted by a computer in order to activate a defined fraction of the maximal nerve or muscle potential. A threshold tracking experiment consists of a 1-ms stimulus being applied to a nerve in regular intervals. The action potential is recorded downstream from the triggering impulse. The stimulus is automatically decreased in steps of a set percentage until the response falls below the target (generation of an action potential). Thereafter, the stimulus is stepped up or down depending on whether the previous response was lesser or greater than the target response until a resting (or control) threshold has been established. Nerve excitability can then be changed by altering the nerve environment or applying additional currents. Since the value of a single threshold current provides little valuable information because it varies within and between subjects, pairs of threshold measurements, comparing the control threshold to thresholds produced by refractoriness, supernormality, strength-duration time constant or &quot;threshold electrotonus&quot; are more useful in scientific and clinical study.

Tracking threshold has advantages over other electrophysiological techniques, like the constant stimulus method. This technique can track threshold changes within a dynamic range of 200% and in general give more insight into axonal properties than other tests. Also, this technique allows for changes in threshold to be given a quantitative value, which when mathematically converted into a percentage, can be used to compare single fiber and multifiber preparations, different neuronal sites, and nerve excitability in different species.

===&quot;Threshold electrotonus&quot;===
A specific threshold tracking technique is &quot;threshold electrotonus&quot;, which uses the threshold tracking set-up to produce long-lasting subthreshold depolarizing or hyperpolarizing currents within a membrane. Changes in cell excitability can be observed and recorded by creating these long-lasting currents. Threshold decrease is evident during extensive depolarization, and threshold increase is evident with extensive hyperpolarization. With hyperpolarization, there is an increase in the resistance of the internodal membrane due to closure of potassium channels, and the resulting plot &quot;fans out&quot;. Depolarization produces has the opposite effect, activating potassium channels, producing a plot that &quot;fans in&quot;.

The most important factor determining threshold electrotonus is membrane potential, so threshold electrotonus can also be used as an index of membrane potential. Furthermore, it can be used to identify characteristics of significant medical conditions through comparing the effects of those conditions on threshold potential with the effects viewed experimentally. For example, ischemia and depolarization cause the same &quot;fanning in&quot; effect of the electrotonus waveforms. This observation leads to the conclusion that ischemia may result from over-activation of potassium channels.

==Clinical significance==
The role of the threshold potential has been implicated in a clinical context, namely in the functioning of the nervous system itself as well as in the cardiovascular system.

===Febrile seizures===
A febrile seizure, or &quot;fever fit&quot;, is a convulsion associated with a significant rise in body temperature, occurring most commonly in early childhood. Repeated episodes of childhood febrile seizures are associated with an increased risk of temporal lobe epilepsy in adulthood.

With patch clamp recording, an analogous state was replicated &quot;in vitro&quot; in rat cortical neurons after induction of febrile body temperatures; a notable decrease in threshold potential was observed. The mechanism for this decrease possibly involves suppression of inhibition mediated by the GABAB receptor with excessive heat exposure.

===ALS and diabetes===

Abnormalities in neuronal excitability have been noted in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and diabetes patients. While the mechanism ultimately responsible for the variance differs between the two conditions, tests through a response to ischemia indicate a similar resistance, ironically, to ischemia and resulting paresthesias. As ischemia occurs through inhibition of the sodium-potassium pump, abnormalities in the threshold potential are hence implicated.

===Arrhythmia===
Since the 1940s, the concept of diastolic depolarization, or &quot;pacemaker potential&quot;, has become established; this mechanism is a characteristic distinctive of cardiac tissue. When the threshold is reached and the resulting action potential fires, a heartbeat results from the interactions; however, when this heartbeat occurs at an irregular time, a potentially serious condition known as arrhythmia may result.

====Use of medications====
A variety of drugs can present prolongation of the QT interval as a side effect. Prolongation of this interval is a result of a delay in sodium and calcium channel inactivation; without proper channel inactivation, the threshold potential is reached prematurely and thus arrhythmia tends to result. These drugs, known as pro-arrhythmic agents, include antimicrobials, antipsychotics, methadone, and, ironically, antiarrhythmic agents. The use of such agents is particularly frequent in intensive care units, and special care must be exercised when QT intervals are prolonged in such patients: arrhythmias as a result of prolonged QT intervals include the potentially fatal torsades de pointes, or TdP.

====Role of diet====
Diet may be a variable in the risk of arrhythmia. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, found in fish oils and several plant oils, serve a role in the prevention of arrhythmias. By inhibiting the voltage-dependent sodium current, these oils shift the threshold potential to a more positive value; therefore, an action potential requires increased depolarization. Clinically therapeutic use of these extracts remains a subject of research, but a strong correlation is established between regular consumption of fish oil and lower frequency of hospitalization for atrial fibrillation, a severe and increasingly common arrhythmia.

<text>Wings 3D is a free and open-source subdivision modeler inspired by Nendo and Mirai from Izware. Wings 3D is named after the winged-edge data structure it uses internally to store coordinate and adjacency data, and is commonly referred to by its users simply as Wings.

Wings 3D is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, using the Erlang environment.

==Overview==
Wings 3D can be used to model and texture low to mid-range polygon models. Wings does not support animations and has only basic OpenGL rendering facilities, although it can export to external rendering software such as POV-Ray and YafRay. Wings is often used in combination with other software, whereby models made in Wings are exported to applications more specialized in rendering and animation such as Blender.

==Interface==
Wings 3D uses context-sensitive menus as opposed to a highly graphical, icon-oriented interface. Modeling is done using the mouse and keyboard to select and modify different aspects of a model&#x27;s geometry in four different selection modes: Vertex, Edge, Face and Body. Because of Wings&#x27;s context-sensitive design, each selection mode has its own set of mesh tools. Many of these tools offer both basic and advanced uses, allowing users to specify vectors and points to change how a tool will affect their model. Wings also allows users to add textures and materials to models, and has built-in AutoUV mapping facilities.

==Features==
* A wide variety of Selection and Modeling Tools
* Modeling Tool support for Magnets and Vector Operations
* Customizable Hotkeys and Interface
* Tweak Mode lets you make quick adjustments to a mesh
* Assign and edit Lighting, Materials, Textures, and Vertex Colours
* AutoUV Mapping
* Ngon mesh support
* A Plugin Manager for adding and removing plugins
* Import and Export in many popular formats

==Supported file formats==
Wings loads and saves models in its own format (codice_1), but also supports several standard 3D formats.

<doc id="598594" wikidata="Q509053" url="?curid=598594" title="Atrioventricular node">
<text>The atrioventricular node or AV node electrically connects the heart&#x27;s atria and ventricles to coordinate beating in the top of the heart; it is part of the electrical conduction system of the heart. The AV node lies at the lower back section of the interatrial septum near the opening of the coronary sinus, and conducts the normal electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles. The AV node is quite compact (~1 x 3 x 5 mm).

==Structure==
===Location===
The AV node lies at the lower back section of the interatrial septum near the opening of the coronary sinus, which conducts the normal electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles. The AV node is quite compact (~1 x 3 x 5 mm). It is located at the center of Koch&#x27;s triangle—a triangle enclosed by the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, the coronary sinus, and the membranous part of the interatrial septum.

===Blood supply===
The blood supply of the AV node is from the atrioventricular nodal branch. The origin of this artery is most commonly (80–90% of hearts) a branch of the right coronary artery, with the remainder originating from the left circumflex artery. This is associated with the dominance of the coronary artery circulation. In &quot;right-dominant&quot; individuals the blood supply is from the right coronary artery while in left dominant individuals it originates from the left circumflex artery.

===Development===
Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) cell signaling plays a key role in diverse aspects of cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis. (BMPs) are multifunctional signaling molecules critical for the development of AV node. BMP influences AV node development through Alk3 receptor (Activin receptor-like kinase 3). Abnormalities seen in BMP and Alk3 are associated with some cardiovascular diseases like Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly and AV conduction disease.

==Function==

The AV node receives two inputs from the right atrium: posteriorly, via the crista terminalis, and anteriorly, via the interatrial septum.

Contraction of heart muscle cells requires depolarization and repolarization of their cell membranes. Movement of ions across cell membranes causes these events. The cardiac conduction system (and AV node part of it) coordinates myocyte mechanical activity. A wave of excitation spreads out from the sinoatrial node through the atria along specialized conduction channels. This activates the AV node. The atrioventricular node delays impulses by approximately 0.09s. This delay in the cardiac pulse is extremely important: It ensures that the atria have ejected their blood into the ventricles first before the ventricles contract.

This also protects the ventricles from excessively fast rate response to atrial arrhythmias (see below).

AV conduction during normal cardiac rhythm occurs through two different pathways:
* the first &quot;pathway&quot; has a slow conduction velocity but shorter refractory period
* the second &quot;pathway&quot; has a faster conduction velocity but longer refractory period.

An important property that is unique to the AV node is &quot;decremental conduction&quot;, in which the more frequently the node is stimulated the slower it conducts. This is the property of the AV node that prevents rapid conduction to the ventricle in cases of rapid atrial rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

The AV node&#x27;s normal intrinsic firing rate without stimulation (such as that from the SA node) is 40–60 times/minute. This property is important because loss of the conduction system before the AV node should still result in pacing of the ventricles by the slower pacemaking ability of the AV node.

==Clinical significance==
* Atrioventricular conduction disease (AV block) describes impairment of the electrical continuity between the atria and ventricles. It occurs when the atrial depolarization fails to reach the ventricles or is conducted with an abnormally long delay. It can result from an injury or be a genetically inherited disorder.
* Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia, which is caused by a dual AV node physiology and AVNRT can only occur in people with it, however almost half of the population have it, though only a few of them will develop AVNRT at some point in life.
* Cystic tumour of atrioventricular nodal region (CTAVN) CTAVN is of endodermal origin and occurs exclusively in the area of the AV node, tricuspid valve, and interatrial septum.

<text>Daniel Joseph Berrigan (May 9, 1921 – April 30, 2016) was an American Jesuit priest, anti-war activist, Christian pacifist, playwright, poet, and author.

Berrigan&#x27;s protests against the Vietnam War earned him both scorn and admiration, especially regarding his association with the Catonsville Nine. He was arrested multiple times and sentenced to prison for destruction of government property, and was listed on the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s &quot;most wanted list&quot; after flight to avoid imprisonment (the first-ever priest on the list).

For the rest of his life, Berrigan remained one of the United States&#x27; leading anti-war activists. In 1980, he co-founded the Plowshares movement, an anti-nuclear protest group, that put him back into the national spotlight. Berrigan was an award-winning and prolific author of some 50 books, a teacher, and a university educator.

==Early life==
Berrigan was born in Virginia, Minnesota, the son of Thomas Berrigan, a second-generation Irish Catholic and active trade union member, and Frieda Berrigan (née Fromhart), who was of German ancestry. He was the fifth of six sons. His youngest brother was fellow peace activist Philip Berrigan.

At age 5, Berrigan&#x27;s family moved to Syracuse, New York. Berrigan was devoted to the Catholic Church throughout his youth. He joined the Jesuits directly out of high school in 1939 and was ordained to the priesthood on June 19, 1952. In 1946, Berrigan earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from St. Andrew-on-Hudson, a Jesuit seminary in Hyde Park, New York. In 1952 he received a master&#x27;s degree from Woodstock College in Baltimore, Maryland.

==Career==
Berrigan taught at St. Peter&#x27;s Preparatory School in Jersey City from 1946 to 1949.

In 1954, Berrigan was assigned to teach French and theology at the Jesuit Brooklyn Preparatory School. In 1957 he was appointed professor of New Testament studies at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York. The same year, he won the Lamont Prize for his book of poems, &quot;Time Without Number&quot;. He developed a reputation as a religious radical, working actively against poverty and on changing the relationship between priests and lay people. While at Le Moyne, he founded its International House.

While on a sabbatical from Le Moyne in 1963, Berrigan traveled to Paris and met French Jesuits who criticized the social and political conditions in Indochina. Taking inspiration from this, he and his brother Philip founded the Catholic Peace Fellowship, a group that organized protests against the war in Vietnam.

On October 28, 1965, Berrigan, along with the Reverend Richard John Neuhaus and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, founded an organization known as Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam (CALCAV). The organization, founded at the Church Center for the United Nations, was joined by the likes of Doctor Hans Morgenthau, the Reverend Reinhold Niebuhr, the Reverend William Sloane Coffin, and the Reverend Philip Berrigan his brother, among many others. The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who delivered his 1967 speech &quot;Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence&quot; under sponsorship from CALCAV, served as the national co-chairman of the organization.

From 1966 to 1970, Berrigan was the assistant director of the Cornell University United Religious Work (CURW), the umbrella organization for all religious groups on campus, including the Cornell Newman Club (later the Cornell Catholic Community), eventually becoming the group&#x27;s pastor. Berrigan was the first faculty advisor of Cornell University&#x27;s first gay rights student group, the Student Homophile League, in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;CUGALA online presentation on LGBT student activism on 6/6/2020&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Berrigan at one time or another held faculty positions or ran programs at Union Theological Seminary, Loyola University New Orleans, Columbia, Cornell, and Yale. His longest tenure was at Fordham (a Jesuit university located in the Bronx), where for a brief time he also served as poet-in-residence.

Berrigan appeared briefly in the 1986 Warner Bros. film &quot;The Mission&quot;, playing a Jesuit priest. He also served as a consultant on the film.

== Activism ==
=== Vietnam War era ===
Berrigan, his brother and Josephite priest Philip Berrigan, and Trappist monk Thomas Merton founded an interfaith coalition against the Vietnam War and wrote letters to major newspapers arguing for an end to the war. In 1967, Berrigan witnessed the public outcry that followed from the arrest of his brother Philip, for pouring blood on draft records as part of the Baltimore Four. Philip was sentenced to six years in prison for defacing government property. The fallout he had to endure from these many interventions, including his support for prisoners of war and, in 1968, seeing firsthand the conditions on the ground in Vietnam, further radicalized Berrigan, or at least strengthened his determination to resist American military imperialism.

Berrigan traveled to Hanoi with Howard Zinn during the Tet Offensive in January 1968 to &quot;receive&quot; three American airmen, the first American prisoners of war released by the North Vietnamese since the US bombing of that nation had begun.

In 1968, he signed the Writers and Editors War Tax Protest pledge, vowing to refuse to make tax payments in protest of the Vietnam War. In the same year, he was interviewed in the anti-Vietnam War documentary film &quot;In the Year of the Pig&quot;, and later that year became involved in radical non-violent protest.

====Catonsville Nine====

Daniel Berrigan and his brother Philip, along with seven other Catholic protesters, used homemade napalm to destroy 378 draft files in the parking lot of the Catonsville, Maryland, draft board on May 17, 1968. This group, which came to be known as the Catonsville Nine, issued a statement after the incident:

Berrigan was arrested and sentenced to three years in prison, but went into hiding with the help of fellow radicals prior to imprisonment. While on the run, Berrigan was interviewed for Lee Lockwood&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Holy Outlaw&quot;. The Federal Bureau of Investigation apprehended him on August 11, 1970, at the home of William Stringfellow and Anthony Towne on Block Island. Berrigan was then imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, until his release on February 24, 1972.

In retrospect, the trial of the Catonsville Nine was significant, because it &quot;altered resistance to the Vietnam War, moving activists from street protests to repeated acts of civil disobedience, including the burning of draft cards&quot;. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted in its obituary, Berrigan&#x27;s actions helped &quot;shape the tactics of opposition to the Vietnam War.&quot;

===Plowshares movement===
On September 9, 1980, Berrigan, his brother Philip, and six others including Anne Montgomery RSCJ, Elmer Maas, Carl Kabat, John Schuchardt, Dean Hammer, and Molly Rush (the &quot;Plowshares Eight&quot;) began the Plowshares movement. They trespassed onto the General Electric nuclear missile facility in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where they damaged nuclear warhead nose cones and poured blood onto documents and files. They were arrested and charged with over ten different felony and misdemeanor counts. The story is partly told in the book &quot;ARISE AND WITNESS: Poems by Anne Montgomery, RSCJ, About Faith, Prison, War Zones and Nonviolent Resistance,&quot; published in 2024. On April 10, 1990, after ten years of appeals, Berrigan&#x27;s group was re-sentenced and paroled for up to months in consideration of time already served in prison. Their legal battle was re-created in Emile de Antonio&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;In the King of Prussia&quot;, which starred Martin Sheen and featured appearances by the Plowshares Eight as themselves.

=== Consistent life ethic ===
Berrigan endorsed a consistent life ethic, a morality based on a holistic reverence for life. As a member of the Rochester, New York-area consistent life ethic advocacy group &quot;Faith and Resistance Community&quot;, he protested via civil disobedience against abortion at a new Planned Parenthood clinic in 1991.

===AIDS activism===
Berrigan said of pastoral care to AIDS patients:

Berrigan published &quot;Sorrow Built a Bridge: Friendship and AIDS&quot; reflecting on his experiences ministering to AIDS patients through the Supportive Care Program at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital and Medical Center in 1989. The &quot;Religious Studies Review&quot; wrote, &quot;the strength of this volume lies in its capacity to portray sensitively the impact of AIDS on human lives.&quot; Speaking about AIDS patients, many of whom were gay, &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; quoted Berrigan saying in 1991, &quot;Both the church and the state are finding ways to kill people with AIDS, and one of the ways is ostracism that pushes people between the cracks of respectability or acceptability and leaves them there to make of life what they will or what they cannot.&quot;

===Other activism===

Although much of his later work was devoted to assisting AIDS patients in New York City, Berrigan still held to his activist roots throughout his life. He maintained his opposition to American interventions abroad, from Central America in the 1980s, through the Gulf War in 1991, the Kosovo War, the US invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He was also an opponent of capital punishment, a contributing editor of &quot;Sojourners&quot;, and a supporter of the Occupy movement.

P. G. Coy, P. Berryman, D. L. Anderson, and others consider Berrigan to be a Christian anarchist.

<text>The bundle of His (BH) or His bundle (HB) ( &quot;hiss&quot;) is a collection of heart muscle cells specialized for electrical conduction. As part of the electrical conduction system of the heart, it transmits the electrical impulses from the atrioventricular node (located between the atria and the ventricles) to the point of the apex of the fascicular branches via the bundle branches. The fascicular branches then lead to the Purkinje fibers, which provide electrical conduction to the ventricles, causing the cardiac muscle of the ventricles to contract at a paced interval.

==Function==
The bundle of His is an important part of the electrical conduction system of the heart, as it transmits impulses from the atrioventricular node, located at the anterior-inferior end of the interatrial septum, to the ventricles of the heart. The bundle of His branches into the left and the right bundle branches, which run along the interventricular septum. The left bundle branch further divides into the left anterior fascicle and the left posterior fascicle. These bundles and fascicles give rise to thin filaments known as Purkinje fibers. These fibers distribute the impulse to the ventricular muscle. The ventricular conduction system comprises the bundle branches and the Purkinje networks. It takes about 0.03–0.04 seconds for the impulse to travel from the bundle of His to the ventricular muscle.

==Clinical significance==

Disorders affecting the cardiomyocytes that make up the electrical conduction system of the heart are called heart blocks. Heart blocks are separated into different categories based on the location of the cellular damage. Damage to any of the conducting cells in or below the bundle of His is collectively referred to as &quot;infra-Hisian blocks&quot;. To be specific, blocks that occur in the right or left bundle branches are called &quot;bundle branch blocks&quot;, and those that occur in either the left anterior or the left posterior fascicles are called &quot;fascicular blocks&quot;, or &quot;hemiblocks&quot;. The conditions in which both the right bundle branch and either the left anterior fascicle or the left posterior fascicle are blocked are collectively referred to as bifascicular blocks, and the condition in which the right bundle branch, the left anterior fascicle, and the left posterior fascicle are blocked is called trifascicular block. Infra-hisian blocks limit the heart&#x27;s ability to coordinate the activities of the atria and ventricles, which usually results in a decrease in its efficiency in pumping blood.

===Pacing===

A 2000 study found that direct His bundle pacing is more effective in producing synchronized ventricular contraction—and therefore in improving cardiac function—than apical pacing.

==Etymology==
These specialized muscle fibers in the heart were named after the Swiss cardiologist Wilhelm His Jr., who discovered them in 1893.

<doc id="598602" wikidata="Q507217" url="?curid=598602" title="De temporum fine comoedia">
<text>(Latin for &quot;A Play on the End of Time&quot;) is a choral opera-oratorio by 20th-century German composer Carl Orff. His last large work, and a personal one, it took ten years to compile the text (1960 to 1970) and another two years to compose (1969 to 1971); he revised it in 1979 and again in 1981. Orff presents a mystery play summarizing his view of the end of time sung in Ancient Greek, Latin, and a German translation by Wolfgang Schadewaldt. &quot;De temporum fine comoedia&quot; was recorded before it was premiered. Herbert von Karajan conducted sessions from 16 to 21 July 1973 in a studio in Leverkusen-Wiesdorf, employing three choruses (the Tölzer Knabenchor, the RIAS Kammerchor and the Kölner Rundfunkchor) and the Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra. The public and stage premiere took place at the Salzburg Festival a month later, on 20 August, with the same forces and stage direction by August Everding.

==Roles==
==Music==
===Summary/dramatis personae===
The opera is in 3 parts, with each part having its own characters.
Part 1 involves 9 Sibyls, represented by female singers.
* 3 dramatic sopranos
* 4 mezzo-sopranos
* 1 alto
* 1 deep contralto

Part 2 involves 9 anchorites, represented by male singers
* 1 tenor
* 5 baritones
* 2 basses
* 1 basso profondo
There is also a children&#x27;s choir, along with a tenor section that is heard on a magnetic tape.

Part 3 involves the following roles:
* The last beings; represented by three large mixed choirs
* The choral leader, a speaking part
* Lucifer, who appears near the end, a speaking role
There is also a double chorus of sopranos and altos used near the end, as well as two soloists, tenor and contralto, to represent the &quot;Vox Mundana&quot;. A children&#x27;s choir is also used to represent the &quot;Voces caelestes&quot;.

===1. Die Sibyllen (The Sibyls)===
# &quot;Heis theós estin anarchos, hypermegéthaes, agénaetos&quot; (A god is, without beginning, immense, unformed)
# &quot;Opse theü g’aléüsi myloi&quot; (The mills of God are late to grind)
# &quot;Pasin homü nyx estin isae tois plüton echusin kai ptochois&quot; (The same night awaits all, rich and poor)
# &quot;Choneusó gar hapanta kai eis katharón dialexó&quot; (I will melt everything down and purify it)
# &quot;Vae! Ibunt impii in gehennam ignis eterni&quot; (Woe! The impious shall enter the hell of the eternal fire)

===2. Die Anachoreten (The Anchorites)===
===3. Dies illa (That Day)===
===Orchestration===
The music requires a very unusual, and possibly symmetrical orchestra:
* 6 flutes (all doubling on piccolos)
* 6 E clarinets (3 doubling on B clarinets)*
* contrabassoon
* 6 horns in F
* 8 trumpets in C
* 6 trombones
*tuba

* a consort of 4 viols
* 8 contrabasses
* electronic tape
* an enormous amount of percussion (including about 100 instruments)
* 3 harps
* 3 pianos, each with two players
* electronic organ

* In an intermediary revision of the work, Orff had all six clarinets in B.

The percussion section, requiring about 25 to 30 players, consists of:
* 2 snare drums
* 6 tambourines
* 3 tenor drums
* 2 bass drums (one with attached cymbal)
* 3 darabukka (alto, tenor, and bass)
* 3 tom-toms
* 6 congas
* bass conga
* 4 &quot;timpanetti&quot; with unpitched wooden drum heads (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass)
* 5 timpani (3 with cymbals)
* 5 crotales
* 5 suspended cymbals
* 1 pair of crash cymbals
* 3 copper tam-tams (40–60 centimetres in diameter)

* 2 tam-tams (large &amp; very large)
* gong pitched to low C
* dobaci (a Japanese temple bell) pitched to C
* 5 high bronze bells &quot;at the interval of a semitone&quot;
* two sets of tubular bells
* triangle
* guiro
* whip
* maracas
* 6 castanets
* hyoshigi*
* angklung
* 3 wood bells, actually referring to temple blocks
* 5 wood blocks

* &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;double&quot; ratchets
* 3 &quot;large church ratchets&quot;
* 4 water glasses
* celesta
* 2 glockenspiels
* lithophone
* metallophone
* xylophone
* tenor xylophone
* bass xylophone
* 2 marimbas

* The hyoshigi are used only on the inside of the piano at the climax of part 3, where they are struck hard on the piano strings by a percussionist. In the original score, they were used in one other passage as well.

The total forces used for the taped sections are
* piccolo
* 8 flutes
* 10 trumpets in C
* 4 trombones
* 2 pianos
* grand church organ
* glockenspiel

* marimba
* crotales
* timpano, as well as large vocal forces:
* tenor and contralto solos
* a large chorus (emitting a loud scream); a tenor section, and double-chorus of sopranos and altos
* a children&#x27;s chorus (soprano).
There is also one spoken part, an echo of one of the sibyls&#x27; spoken dialogue, accompanied by wind machine.

===Tape sections===
The music on the magnetic tape is used in four different places, most notably at the end when Lucifer appears.

The first section is used in part 1, and requires the following instruments:
* piccolo
* glockenspiel
* marimba
* piano

The second section, also used in part 1 utilizes the following:
* wind machine, accompanying an echo of one of the Sibyl&#x27;s dialogue.

The third section is used in part 2:
* A children&#x27;s choir and tenor section
* 2 trumpets in C
* crotales
* glockenspiel
* marimba
* timpano
* 2 pianos

The fourth and final section is used towards the end of part 3. In Orff&#x27;s final revision in 1981, this taped section was omitted and instead given to players in the orchestra:

* 8 flutes
* 10 trumpets in C, intoning a fanfare to heaven
* 4 trombones
* A female chorus (SSAA)
* tenor and contralto soloists
* children&#x27;s choir

===1979 revision===
Orff later made extensive revisions to &quot;De temporum fine comoedia&quot; with many changes in orchestration. In his 1981 revision the following instruments were added:
* 1 snare drum, bringing the total number to 3
* 7 water glasses, bringing the total to 11
* grand church organ, in return omitting it on tape

The following instruments were eliminated:

* triangle
* 3 timpanetti, leaving only 1 (alto)
* All 3 copper tam-tams
* 2 church ratchets, leaving only 1
* 2 suspended cymbals, bringing the number down to 3

The modifications to the pre-recorded music consist of the addition of the following:
* 1 piano, bringing the total up to 3
* 3 contrabasses

The omissions consisted of:

* All 8 flutes
* 8 trumpets, leaving only 2
* All 4 trombones
* grand church organ, instead brought into the orchestra
* double-chorus of sopranos and altos, replaced by a small chorus in the orchestra pit
* tenor and alto soloists, whose parts are reduced and sung live

In addition to loud percussive passages, there are also as periods of calm piano and straight dialogue. In this culmination of his stage works, Orff almost abandons his diatonicism to chromaticism, which enriches and thickens the musical texture, and octatonicism.

As the play is about to finish, after the destruction of all worldly material, Satan asks for forgiveness and is restored to Angel Lucifer, thus forgiven. The unsettling chromaticism here ends and Bach&#x27;s &quot;Before Thy Throne&quot; (Vor deinen Thron tret ich hiermit, BWV 668) strikes up in a canon from the four viols. This canon is pandiatonic and upon its completion, its mirror image is stated (that is the identical material played backward).

<text>Streptobacillus is a genus of fastidious microaerophilic Gram-negative bacteria, which grow in culture as rods in chains.

Their species associated with infection is &quot;S. moniliformis.&quot;

Their reported susceptibilities and therapies are penicillin and erythromycin.

==Diseases==
Associated infections: the Haverhill fever form of rat bite fever. (Notes &quot;Spirillum minus&quot; is also an agent of rat bite fever, in the form known as Sodoku.)

Haverhill fever, which is characterized by fever, rash, chills, headache, vomiting, muscle pain, arthritis, and bacteremia, and by weight loss and diarrhea in children.

==Commentary==
Rat bite fever is caused by either &quot;Streptobacillus moniliformis&quot; or &quot;Spirillum minor&quot;. The incidence of rat-bite fever is highest in urban areas with poor sanitation where the rat population is high, however in recent times cases have also been attributed to occupational contact with rodents such as pet shop employees or laboratory workers or through pet ownership.

While the disease is usually caused by a bite, it can also occur from close contact with rodents or ingestion of contaminated food or water. The latter is known as Haverhill fever. The disease typically presents with chills and fever accompanied by headache, vomiting, and muscle pain. A rash and arthritis develop 2–4 days after the initial onset. Less commonly the infection can cause pneumonitis, endocarditis or meningitis. As these symptoms are common to many febrile diseases, this is often classified as a fever of unknown origin (FUO). If untreated, death will occur in approximately 10% of cases.

<text>Charlotte Marion Hughes (née Milburn; 1 August 1877 – 17 March 1993) was a British supercentenarian who, at 115 years, 228 days, is the longest-lived person ever documented from the United Kingdom.

==Biography ==
Born in Hartlepool in the fortieth year of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign, she lived under the rule of five more monarchs and 24 UK Prime Ministers. Hughes grew up in Middlesbrough in Yorkshire, where her father ran a music shop. She worked as a teacher in a primary school from the age of thirteen and married Noel Hughes, a retired army captain, after she retired aged 63. They remained married until his death in 1979 at the age of 88. Her father, Herbert Milburn, died at age 93, while her mother, Annie, died at 92. She had three younger brothers: Herbert, Henry and Reginald. Herbert died at 58, Henry at 80, and Reginald at 62.

She remained in robust health into extreme old age and achieved public recognition for her longevity, including tea with then-UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in 1985, whom she jokingly admonished against cuddling up to her, as Hughes was a Labour Party supporter. Thatcher replied by saying &quot;Oh well, never mind, let&#x27;s have a cup of tea.&quot; However, Hughes admitted to personally liking Thatcher, and she described the Prime Minister as &quot;a very nice woman.&quot; For her 110th birthday, she flew on Concorde to New York City, one of only two supercentenarian air passengers ever recorded. She stayed at The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel for four days, on an all-expenses-paid visit, and met then-Mayor Ed Koch.

Hughes became the oldest living person in the United Kingdom when Kate Begbie of Scotland died in 1988, and she broke the national longevity record, held until then by Anna Eliza Williams, in early 1992. Hughes lived in her own home in Marske-by-the-Sea until 1991, when she moved to a nursing home in Redcar due to her becoming too frail to look after herself. She also spent her final years in a wheelchair, although she remained mentally alert and sharp to the end of her life. She was described by relatives as &quot;extremely domineering, outspoken, and sharp; but also as friendly and witty.&quot;

Hughes was never interviewed by demographers or other longevity researchers, though the historian Peter Laslett went through the documentation pertaining to her case.

<text>Carmi Gillon (; born January 1950) is an Israeli politician and a former Israeli ambassador to Denmark and head of Shin Bet, Israel&#x27;s internal security service, from 1994 to 1996.

After the 4 November 1995 assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, he attracted criticism for failing to provide adequate security.

He graduated from the National Security College. He has a B.A. in political science from the Hebrew University, where he was recruited into the Shin Bet, and an M.A. in public policy from the University of Haifa. He attended a six-week advanced management program at Harvard Business School, and completed management training at Harvard Kennedy School.

==Biography==
Gillon was born in Jerusalem. His mother, Saada Gillon (née Frumkin), was born in Ottoman Judea to which her ancestors immigrated from the Russian Empire in the 19th century, likewise Gillon&#x27;s maternal great grandfather was Israel Dov Frumkin, a pioneer of Hebrew journalism who arrived 1859 (When Judea was part of Ottoman Syria). His maternal grandfather, Gad Frumkin, was one of the first trained attorneys in British-Palestine (a novel parcellation after WW1), who was the only Jewish judge on the Supreme Court of Palestine during the British Mandate era and was also a member of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem&#x27;s Board of Governors from the 1930s until his death. His maternal grandmother, Chana Frumkin, was the daughter of Aharon Eisenberg, a pioneer of the First Aliyah who was one of the founders of Rehovot, and was the President of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith in Jerusalem. His mother served as Deputy Attorney General. His father, Colin Gillon, was born Colin Gluckman to a Jewish family in Johannesburg, South Africa, and immigrated to Palestine in 1937. Gillon&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Katie Gluckman, was a prominent activist in the Zionist movement in South Africa. Colin served as State Attorney, and Hebraized his name from Gluckman to Gillon at Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion&#x27;s insistence.

Gillon studied at high school in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Rehavia, and at the Academy of Music. He began his military service in the Israel Defense Forces in the Armored Corps, but was transferred to the Artillery Corps. He was wounded in action in the War of Attrition, and was discharged from the IDF in 1971. In 1972, he began studying political science and public administration at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Gillon is married to Sari. He has three children and five grandchildren.

==Shin Bet career==
In 1972, Gillon was recruited by Shin Bet during his university studies. He initially worked as a bodyguard for senior staff. From 1982 to 1987, he was chief of the Shin Bet Jewish Department. From 1987 to 1989, he attended the National Security College, serving in a number of senior positions during his studies for an MA in political science and public administration. From 1989, he was chief of the Training Division. From 1990, he was chief of the Shin Bet Northern Command, a position in which he was responsible for Shin Bet activity in Lebanon. From 1993 to 1994, he was chief of the Administrative Division, responsible for HR, finances, and logistics. For four months in 1994, he was Shin Bet acting director during Yaakov Peri’s academic leave.

From March 1995 to February 1996, Gillon was the director of Shin Bet. B&#x27;Tselem, Human Rights Watch, and other human rights organizations have criticized his oversight. &quot;During his tenure, and until the Israel High Court of Justice ruled against such methods in 1999, GSS interrogators were officially sanctioned to use &#x27;moderate physical pressure&#x27; on detainees (the vast majority of them Palestinians),&quot; according to Amnesty International. From October 1994, when a suicide bomb killed 23 people, they were allowed to use &quot;increased physical pressure&quot;. Secret government guidelines set down what &quot;moderate physical pressure&quot; and &quot;increased physical pressure&quot; allowed; according to court testimonies of GSS members themselves, this included subjecting detainees to sleep deprivation, prolonged shackling in painful positions, hooding with filthy sacks, being forced to squat like a frog (gambaz) and violent shaking (tiltul). During Carmi Gillon&#x27;s period of service with the GSS such methods of interrogation were used against several hundred Palestinian detainees every year, many of whom were later released without charge.

In 1995, the Shin Bet&#x27;s VIP protection unit failed to prevent the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin. Gillon had been in Paris at the time of the assassination, and upon returning to Israel, immediately submitted his resignation to Acting Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who rejected it. Nevertheless, he resigned the following year. The Shamgar Commission was critical of the Shin Bet under his tenure.

==Private sector==

After leaving the service, Gillon served as general manager of the Avner Insurance Company (1997–2000) and then as director general of the Peres Center for Peace (2000–2001). He also studied at Harvard Business School.

==Ambassador to Denmark==

From 2001 to 2003, he was the Israeli ambassador to Denmark. When he was nominated for the position in 2001, Human Rights Watch called for the Danish government to reject his appointment and for Israel to withdraw his nomination, while Amnesty International asked the Danish authorities to investigate him for torture, and if there was enough evidence for a prosecution, to detain him under the UN Convention against Torture, and to either try him or extradite him to a state willing to try him. Danish Justice Minister Frank Jensen initially said that Gillon could be arrested and prosecuted under the terms of the Convention after he admitted using &quot;moderate physical pressure&quot; on Palestinian detainees, but later backed down, acknowledging that as an ambassador, Gillon was protected by diplomatic immunity.

Gillon defended the use of torture as a means of &quot;self-defense against terrorism.&quot; He told Danish media that Israel might have to re-introduce &quot;moderate physical pressure&quot; when interrogating suspected Palestinian terrorists. &quot;We banned this form of interrogation in Israel in 1999 because of the peace process. Unfortunately, it looks like we may have to start using it again,&quot; Gillon said. One member of parliament, Centre Democrat leader Peter Duetoft, called opposition to Gillon&#x27;s appointment &quot;hypocritical&quot; because Yasser Arafat, &quot;the biggest terrorist&quot;, had recently visited Denmark without there having been similar objections.

In January 2014, Gillon arrived in Denmark to attend the Copenhagen Film Festival for a screening of &quot;The Gatekeepers&quot; and to deliver a lecture. After a Danish anti-torture NGO reported Gillon to the police for torture, Gillon left Denmark on January 10. The Prosecutor&#x27;s Office subsequently rejected the complaint due to lack of evidence.

==Politics and other activities==
From 2003 to 2007, he was elected head of the Mevasseret Zion local council. From 2007 to 2013, he was vice president for external relations for Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Gillon has been a member of a number of boards of directors, including the Tahal Group, Danker Investment, and the Arab Israel Bank. From 2014, he was chairman and CEO of Carmi Gillon Inc., chairman of CYTEGIC, and external director of the Dan Hotels chain.

Over the years, Gillon has written several books and a range of articles on the subjects of foreign affairs and security. He has also been an active current affairs commentator in the electronic media in Israel and overseas.

In 2012, Gillon was featured in a documentary film, &quot;The Gatekeepers&quot;, and discussed the main events of his tenure in Shin Bet.

<text>In cryptography, GMR is a digital signature algorithm named after its inventors Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali and Ron Rivest.

As with RSA the security of the system is related to the difficulty of factoring very large numbers. But, in contrast to RSA, GMR is secure against &quot;adaptive chosen-message attacks&quot;, which is the currently accepted security definition for signature schemes— even when an attacker receives signatures for messages of his choice, this does not allow them to forge a signature for a single additional message.

<doc id="598619" wikidata="Q7846262" url="?curid=598619" title="Troponin">
<text>Troponin, or the troponin complex, is a complex of three regulatory proteins (troponin C, troponin I, and troponin T) that are integral to muscle contraction in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, but not smooth muscle. Measurements of cardiac-specific troponins I and T are extensively used as diagnostic and prognostic indicators in the management of myocarditis, myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome. Blood troponin levels may be used as a diagnostic marker for stroke or other myocardial injury that is ongoing, although the sensitivity of this measurement is low.

==Function==
Troponin is attached to the protein tropomyosin and lies within the groove between actin filaments in muscle tissue. In a relaxed muscle, tropomyosin blocks the attachment site for the myosin crossbridge, thus preventing contraction. When the muscle cell is stimulated to contract by an action potential, calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic membrane and release calcium into the sarcoplasm. Some of this calcium attaches to troponin, which causes it to change shape, exposing binding sites for myosin (active sites) on the actin filaments. Myosin&#x27;s binding to actin causes crossbridge formation, and contraction of the muscle begins.
Troponin is found in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, but the specific versions of troponin differ between types of muscle. The main difference is that the TnC subunit of troponin in skeletal muscle has four calcium ion-binding sites, whereas in cardiac muscle there are only three. The actual amount of calcium that binds to troponin has not been definitively established.

==Physiology==
In both cardiac and skeletal muscles, muscular force production is controlled primarily by changes in intracellular calcium concentration. In general, when calcium rises, the muscles contract and, when calcium falls, the muscles relax.

Troponin is a component of thin filaments (along with actin and tropomyosin), and is the protein complex to which calcium binds to trigger the production of muscular force. Troponin has three subunits, TnC, TnI, and TnT, each playing a role in force regulation.. Under resting intracellular levels of calcium, tropomyosin covers the active actin sites to which myosin (a molecular motor organized in muscle thick filaments) binds in order to generate force. When calcium becomes bound to specific sites in the N-domain of TnC, a series of protein structural changes occurs, such that tropomyosin is rolled away from myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing myosin to attach to the thin filament and produce force and shorten the sarcomere.

Individual subunits serve different functions:

* Troponin C binds to calcium ions to produce a conformational change in TnI
* Troponin T binds to tropomyosin, interlocking them to form a troponin-tropomyosin complex
* Troponin I binds to actin in thin myofilaments to hold the actin-tropomyosin complex in place

Smooth muscle does not have troponin.

===Subunits===
TnT is a tropomyosin-binding subunit which regulates the interaction of troponin complex with thin filaments; TnI inhibits ATP-ase activity of acto-myosin; TnC is a Ca2+-binding subunit, playing the main role in Ca2+ dependent regulation of muscle contraction.

TnT and TnI in cardiac muscle are presented by forms different from those in skeletal muscles. Two isoforms of TnI and two isoforms of TnT are expressed in human skeletal muscle tissue (skTnI and skTnT). Only one tissue-specific isoform of TnI is described for cardiac muscle tissue (cTnI), whereas the existence of several cardiac specific isoforms of TnT (cTnT) are described in the literature. No cardiac specific isoforms are known for human TnC. TnC in human cardiac muscle tissue is presented by an isoform typical for slow skeletal muscle. Another form of TnC, the fast skeletal TnC isoform, is more typical for fast skeletal muscles. cTnI is expressed only in myocardium. No examples of cTnI expression in healthy or injured skeletal muscle or in other tissue types are known. cTnT is probably less cardiac specific. The expression of cTnT in skeletal tissue of patients with chronic skeletal muscle injuries has been described.

Inside the cardiac troponin complex the strongest interaction between molecules has been demonstrated for cTnI – TnC binary complex especially in the presence of Ca2+ ( KA = 1.510−8 M−1). TnC, forming a complex with cTnI, changes the conformation of cTnI molecule and shields part of its surface. According to the latest data cTnI is released in the blood stream of the patient in the form of binary complex with TnC or ternary complex with cTnT and TnC. cTnI-TnC complex formation plays an important positive role in improving the stability of cTnI molecule. cTnI, which is extremely unstable in its free form, demonstrates significantly better stability in complex with TnC or in ternary cTnI-cTnT-TnC complex. It has been demonstrated that stability of cTnI in native complex is significantly better than stability of the purified form of the protein or the stability of cTnI in artificial troponin complexes combined from purified proteins.

===Cardiac conditions===
Subtypes of troponin (cardiac I and T) are sensitive and specific indicators of heart muscle damage (myocardium). They are measured in the blood to differentiate between unstable angina and myocardial infarction (heart attack) in people with chest pain or acute coronary syndrome. A person who recently had a myocardial infarction has areas of damaged heart muscle and elevated cardiac troponin levels in the blood. This can also occur in people with coronary vasospasm, a type of myocardial infarction involving severe constriction of the cardiac blood vessels. After a myocardial infarction troponins may remain high for up to 2 weeks.

Cardiac troponins are a marker of all heart muscle damage, not just myocardial infarction, which is the most severe form of heart disorder. However, diagnostic criteria for raised troponin indicating myocardial infarction is currently set by the WHO at a threshold of 2 μg/L or higher. Critical levels of other cardiac biomarkers are also relevant, such as creatine kinase. Other conditions that directly or indirectly lead to heart muscle damage and death can also increase troponin levels, such as kidney failure. Severe tachycardia (for example due to supraventricular tachycardia) in an individual with normal coronary arteries can also lead to increased troponins for example, it is presumed due to increased oxygen demand and inadequate supply to the heart muscle.

Coronary artery stent placement can also cause immediate post-procedure elevated serum troponin levels. This can be problematic in a clinical setting as troponin values and guidance protocols become subject to more thoughtful interpretation. Essentially, making it difficult for a clinician to use troponin elevation diagnostically in this patient group. After stenting and related PCI procedures, troponin levels do return to standard levels once the stent has &#x27;settled&#x27; and is no longer causing localized cardiac muscle inflammation.

In patients with non-severe asymptomatic aortic valve stenosis and no overt coronary artery disease, the increased troponin T (above 14 pg/mL) was found associated with an increased 5-year event rate of ischemic cardiac events (myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery).

Troponins are also increased in patients with heart failure, where they also predict mortality and ventricular rhythm abnormalities. They can rise in inflammatory conditions such as myocarditis and pericarditis with heart muscle involvement (which is then termed myopericarditis). Troponins can also indicate several forms of cardiomyopathy, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or (left) ventricular hypertrophy, peripartum cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or infiltrative disorders such as cardiac amyloidosis.

Heart injury with increased troponins also occurs in cardiac contusion, defibrillation and internal or external cardioversion. Troponins are commonly increased in several procedures such as cardiac surgery and heart transplantation, closure of atrial septal defects, percutaneous coronary intervention, or radiofrequency ablation.

===Non-cardiac conditions===
The distinction between cardiac and non-cardiac conditions is somewhat artificial; the conditions listed below are not primary heart diseases, but they exert indirect effects on the heart muscle.

Troponins are increased in around 40% of patients with critical illnesses such as sepsis. There is an increased risk of mortality and length of stay in the intensive-care unit in these patients. In severe gastrointestinal bleeding, there can also be a mismatch between oxygen demand and supply of the myocardium.

Chemotherapy agents can exert toxic effects on the heart (examples include anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin). Several toxins and venoms can also lead to heart muscle injury (scorpion venom, snake venom, and venom from jellyfish and centipedes). Carbon monoxide poisoning or cyanide poisoning can also be accompanied by the release of troponins due to hypoxic cardiotoxic effects. Cardiac injury occurs in about one-third of severe CO poisoning cases, and troponin screening is appropriate in these patients.

In both primary pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), right ventricular strain results in increased wall tension and may cause ischemia. Of course, patients with COPD exacerbations might also have concurrent myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism, so care has to be taken to attribute increased troponin levels to COPD.

People with end-stage kidney disease can have chronically elevated troponin T levels, which are linked to a poorer prognosis. Troponin I is less likely to be falsely elevated.

Strenuous endurance exercise such as marathons or triathlons can lead to increased troponin levels in up to one-third of subjects, but it is not linked to adverse health effects in these competitors.
High troponin T levels have also been reported in patients with inflammatory muscle diseases such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Troponins are also increased in rhabdomyolysis.

In hypertensive disorders of pregnancy such as preeclampsia, elevated troponin levels indicate some degree of myofibrillary damage.

Cardiac troponin T and I can be used to monitor drug and toxin-induced cardiomyocyte toxicity. .

In 2020, it was found that patients with severe COVID-19 had higher troponin I levels compared to those with milder disease.

===Prognostic use===
Elevated troponin levels are prognostically important in many of the conditions in which they are used for diagnosis.

In a community-based cohort study indicating the importance of silent cardiac damage, troponin I has been shown to predict mortality and first coronary heart disease event in men free from cardiovascular disease at baseline. In people with stroke, elevated blood troponin levels are not a useful marker to detect the condition.

===Subunits===
First cTnI and later cTnT were originally used as markers for cardiac cell death. Both proteins are now widely used to diagnose acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina, post-surgery myocardium trauma and some other related diseases with cardiac muscle injury. Both markers can be detected in patient&#x27;s blood 3–6 hours after onset of the chest pain, reaching peak level within 16–30 hours. Elevated concentration of cTnI and cTnT in blood samples can be detected even 5–8 days after onset of the symptoms, making both proteins useful also for the late diagnosis of AMI.

==Detection==
Cardiac troponin T and I are measured by immunoassay methods.

* Due to patent regulations, a single manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics) distributes cTnT.
* A host of diagnostic companies make cTnI immunoassay methods available on many different immunoassay platforms.

Troponin elevation following cardiac cell necrosis starts within 2–3 hours, peaks in approx. 24 hours, and persists for 1–2 weeks.

<text>A revolution in military affairs (RMA) is a hypothesis in military theory about the future of warfare, often connected to technological and organizational recommendations for military reform.

Broadly stated, RMA claims that in certain periods of the history of humankind, there were new military doctrines, strategies, tactics and technologies which led to an irrecoverable change in the conduct of warfare. Furthermore, those changes compel an accelerated adaptation of novel doctrines and strategies.

In the United States, RMA is often linked to discussions such as the reorganization plan of the United States Army and total systems integration.

==History==
The original theorizing was done by the Soviet Armed Forces in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov. The United States initially became interested in it through Andrew Marshall, the head of the Office of Net Assessment, a Department of Defense think tank. It slowly gained credence within official military circles, and other nations began exploring similar shifts in organization and technology.

Interest in RMA and the structure of future U.S. armed forces is strong within China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army and it has been incorporated into China&#x27;s strategic military doctrine. Many other militaries have also researched and considered RMA as an organizational concept—e.g., those of Canada, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, Republic of China (Taiwan), India, Russia, and Germany—but not all militaries have adopted RMA, due to its significant infrastructure and investment costs.

=== Soviet views ===
Nikolai Ogarkov called the early idea of RMA the Military Technological Revolution (MTR). Pentagon officials in the United States changed the name of his original idea, which is how it became known as RMA. Ogarkov&#x27;s belief that the potential and possibility for new weapons was increasing rapidly led to the development of his initial idea.

At the time of the initial development of MTR, the Soviets anticipated that certain technologies, including energy weapons and robots, would be in use by 2015 at the latest. They believed that the use of large ground forces would be minimized. In place of some ground forces, these new technologies would be implemented in order to establish dominance on the battlefield. Russians also believed that control of space would become essential for maintaining dominance in future conflicts. Soviets believed that it would be essential to control the satellite space around Earth, in order to more effectively relay information. They also anticipated the ability to use space as a medium in which they could deploy weapons.

=== Renewed interest ===
The United States&#x27; victory in the 1991 Gulf War renewed interest in RMA theory. In the view of RMA proponents, American dominance through superior technology emphasized how the United States&#x27; technological advances reduced the relative power of the Iraqi military, by no means a lightweight rival, to insignificance. According to Stephen Biddle, part of the growth in popularity of the RMA theory after the Gulf War was that virtually all American military experts drastically over-estimated the coalition casualty count. This led many experts to assume that their models of war were wrong—that a revolution of sorts had occurred.

After the Kosovo War, in which the United States did not lose a single life, others suggested that war had become too sterile, creating a &quot;virtual war&quot;. Furthermore, the United States’ inability to capture Osama bin Laden or effectively combat the Iraqi insurgency led some to question RMA in the face of asymmetrical warfare, in which foes of the United States may increasingly engage in order to counter RMA&#x27;s advantages.

In 1997, the U.S. Army mounted an exercise codenamed &quot;Force 21&quot;, to test the application of digital technologies in warfare in order to improve communications and logistics by applying private-sector technologies adapted for military use. Specifically, it sought to increase awareness of one&#x27;s position on the battlefield as well as that of the enemy, in order to achieve increased lethality, greater control of the tempo of warfare, and fewer instances of friendly fire via improved identification friend or foe.

In 2002, Chris Bray described RMA as new ideas about &quot;the use of information and automation on the battlefield&quot; to make forces &quot;more lethal&quot; and &quot;more agile.&quot;

==Areas of focus==
One of the central problems in understanding the current debate over RMA arises from many theorists&#x27; use of the term to refer to the revolutionary technology itself, which is the driving force of change. Concurrently, other theorists tend to use the term as referring to revolutionary adaptations by military organisations that may be necessary to deal with the changes in technology. Other theorists place RMA more closely inside the specific political and economic context of globalization and the end of the Cold War.

When reviewing the gamut of theories, three fundamental versions of RMA come to the forefront. The first perspective focuses primarily upon changes in the nation-state and the role of an organised military in using force. This approach highlights the political, social, and economic factors worldwide, which might require a completely different type of military and organisational structure to apply force in the future.

Authors such as the RAND Corporation&#x27;s Sean J. A. Edwards (advocate of BattleSwarm tactics, a type of military swarming), Carl H. Builder and Lt. Col. Ralph Peters emphasized the decline of the nation-state, the nature of the emerging international order, and the different types of forces needed in the near future.

The second perspective—most commonly assigned the term RMA—highlights the evolution of weapons technology, information technology, military organization, and military doctrine among advanced powers. This &quot;System of Systems&quot; perspective on RMA has been ardently supported by Admiral William Owens, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who identified three overlapping areas for force assets. These are intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, command, control, communications and intelligence processing, which allows for the use of precision force.

Advanced versions of RMA incorporate other sophisticated technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), nanotechnology, robotics, and biotechnology. Recently, the RMA debate focused on &quot;network-centric warfare&quot; which is a doctrine that aims to connect all troops on the battlefield.

Finally, the third concept is that a &quot;true&quot; revolution in military affairs has not yet occurred or is unlikely to. Authors such as Michael E. O&#x27;Hanlon and Frederick Kagan, point to the fact much of the technology and weapons systems ascribed to the contemporary RMA were in development long before 1991 and the Internet and information technology boom.

Several critics point out that a &quot;revolution&quot; within the military ranks might carry detrimental consequences, produce severe economic strain, and ultimately prove counterproductive. Such authors tend to profess a much more gradual &quot;evolution&quot; in military affairs, as opposed to a rapid revolution. In 2021 the Chief of Naval Operations stated that it was a mistake to concurrently introduce 23 unproven technologies onboard carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) before land-based testing, in particular the weapons elevators. The Air Force also developed the F-35 concurrently with its production, and is now seeking another fighter that is less expensive to operate; The cost penalty for concurrent development and production of the F-35 is estimated to be $2 billion.

=== Precision attack ===
By 2021 the concept and capability for Long range precision fires had developed sufficiently to be able to schedule their initial fielding by 2023, in its various materiel forms, as well as to be able to communicate the necessary doctrine for their application by the United States. In brief, no headquarters, no command center, no air defense, no missile battery, nor any logistics center of an adversary is safe in the event of war. Moreover, the strikes will be precise enough to paralyze the adversary&#x27;s massed military capability. &quot;See: Artillery § Precision-guidance&quot;

In considering the implications of precision attack, it is clear that precision weapons, when coupled to recent developments in aerospace, have transformed warfare, and as a result, the question is not that &quot;Does an RMA exist?&quot; rather, &quot;When did it begin, and what are its implications?&quot; Tied to this are surprisingly persistent questions about the use and value of air power, now more accurately seen as aerospace power. If nothing else, given the record of precision air power application, aerospace power advocates should not still have to spend as much time as they do arguing the merits of three-dimensional war and precision attack&#x27;s value to it. Modern joint service aerospace forces offer the most responsive, flexible, lethal, and devastating form of power projection across the spectrum of conflict, employing a range of aerospace weaponry such as maritime patrol aircraft, attack and troop-lift helicopters, land-based long-range aircraft, and battlefield rocket artillery systems. Service-specific aerospace power can often be formidable and, as such, has transformed conflict from two-dimensional to three-dimensional, and has changed the critical focus of conflict from that of seizing and holding to one of halting and controlling.

In reviewing a few points from the military history of the 20th century, within roughly a decade of the first flight of an airplane, aircraft were having an occasionally decisive effect on the battlefield. Within four decades, a nation—Great Britain—secured its national survival through air warfare. By the midst of the Second World War, three-dimensional attack (from above and below the surface) had become the primary means of sinking both vessels at sea and destroying the combat capability of armies on land. In fact, for the United States, this trend of inflicting losses and material destruction primarily through air attack continued after the second world war for Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf, Bosnia, and other, lesser, conflicts. In particular, air attack directed against land forces has been especially powerful in blunting and destroying opponents on the offensive, whether in older experience—such as confronting Rommel in the Western Desert, or German armored forces trying to split the Normandy invasion at Mortain, or at the Bulge (where German commanders credited Allied fighter attacks on fuel trucks and supplies as being the decisive factor in halting their drive), in the opening and closing stages of the Korean War, and confronting the 1972 North Vietnamese Spring Invasion—or, more recently, in destroying the Khafji offensive of Saddam Hussein in 1991. NATO&#x27;s reliance upon air power in the Yugoslav Wars was not surprising because from the very earliest days, the NATO alliance saw air power as the linchpin of Western military strength and the necessary offset to the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s huge military forces.

Given its historical underpinnings, we should not be surprised that the revolution in warfare that has been brought about both by the confluence of the aerospace and the electronic revolutions, and by the offshoot of both—the precision guided munition—is one that has been a long time coming, back to the Second World War, back, even, to the experimenters of the First World War who attempted, however crudely, to develop &quot;smart&quot; weapons to launch from airships and other craft. Used almost experimentally until the latter stages of the Vietnam War, the precision weapon since that time has increasingly come to first influence, then dominate, and now perhaps to render superfluous, the traditional notion of a linear battlefield. 
A cease-fire in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war was brokered by the effective use of armed drones, loitering munitions which would lock-on to a ground target, and strike it while transmitting pictures of the kill.

In 2009 the Future Combat Systems project was cancelled by the Secretary of Defense, as too ambitious for the time. The Decker-Wagner report (2011) in fact recommended the dissolution of RDECOM, the R&amp;D arm of the US Army. De-layering of the commands of the US Army in order to speed up development of materiel was begun in 2017.

By 2021 long range precision fires (LRPF) at ranges well over 1725 miles were developed and well on the way toward initial fielding in 2023. The Space Development Agency&#x27;s National defense space architecture is an essential part of this plan.

==Criticism==
The revolution of military affairs is the inclusion and expansion of new technology—e.g., drones, satellite imaging, and remotely operated vehicles—within current military tactics. RMA has generally been praised for its ability to reduce casualty rates and facilitate intelligence gathering. On the other hand, some critics argue that RMA serves to further dissociate soldiers from the horrific realities of warfare, while others maintain that RMA restricts the overall understanding of warfare and its dynamics. Scholars recommend gaining a critical understanding of RMA before implementing it.

Operation Desert Storm is considered the first major global conflict successfully implementing RMA and is considered a paragon of future military operations due to the low casualty rate and the U.S. military&#x27;s speed and precision. On the other hand, others claim that RMA technology severely inhibited the U.S. military&#x27;s ability to respond to guerrilla tactics and that efforts to incorporate advanced weapons like Patriot missiles were unsuccessful. Indeed, a number of epistemological issues have cropped up.

In the wake of RMA technologies such as drones, unmanned ground vehicles, and clean bombs there are several concerns about the distancing and disassociation that eclipse the realities of war. An analysis of tactical strikes reveals that while the number of ones own soldiers may be preserved as the number of long-range attacks increases, so does collateral damage. Furthermore, by removing the soldier-on-soldier element of warfare, the natural reactions and consequences of wartime actions are impacted, which has been frequently referred to as the removal of humanity from war. RMA technological advances have resulted in a dehumanizing of warfare, which negatively effects the decisions made by officers, as well as individuals in the field. Another critique argues that RMA&#x27;s good intentions notwithstanding, the resulting collateral damage is unacceptable and thus urges more careful consideration in incorporating RMA technology.

Stephen Biddle&#x27;s 2004 book, &quot;Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern War&quot;, discounts the idea of RMA. He argues that military doctrine and tactics are far more important to battle outcomes in modern warfare than is technological progress, and that basic doctrine has changed little since the second half of World War I.

<text>Albert Lincoln Roker Jr. (born August 20, 1954) is an American weather presenter, journalist, television personality, and author. He is the weather anchor on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, and occasionally co-hosts &quot;3rd Hour Today&quot;. He has a lapsed American Meteorological Society (AMS) Television Seal of Approval (#238).

==Early life==
Roker was born in the borough of Queens, New York City, the son of Isabel, of Jamaican descent, and Albert Lincoln Roker Sr., a bus driver of Bahamian descent. He initially wanted to be a cartoonist. He was raised Catholic, his mother&#x27;s faith, and graduated from Xavier High School in Manhattan. He attended the State University of New York (SUNY) at Oswego where he received a B.A. in communications in 1976. 

==Career==
===Early career (1974–95)===
Roker worked as a weather anchor for CBS affiliate WHEN-TV (now WTVH) in Syracuse, New York from 1974 until 1976, while he was enrolled at SUNY Oswego. During his time in Oswego, he also DJ&#x27;d at the campus radio station, WNYO. Following the completion of his studies, Roker moved to Washington, D.C., and took a weathercasting position at independent station WTTG, then owned by Metromedia, remaining there for much of the next two years.

Roker&#x27;s career with NBC began in 1978 when he was hired at WKYC in Cleveland, then an NBC owned-and-operated station. After five years in Cleveland, Roker was promoted to the network&#x27;s flagship outlet, WNBC-TV in his hometown. Roker returned to New York City in late 1983 as a weekend weathercaster, and within eight months became the station&#x27;s regular weeknight weathercaster. Roker replaced 27-year WNBC-TV veteran Dr. Frank Field, who left the network over a contract dispute. From 1983 to 1996, Roker was the regular substitute for forecaster Joe Witte on the NBC News program &quot;NBC News at Sunrise&quot;, and from 1990 to 1995 filled in for Willard Scott, Bryant Gumbel and 1997 through the 2000s for Matt Lauer on the &quot;Today Show&quot;. In 1995, he became the host of &quot;The Al Roker Show&quot;, a weekend talk show on CNBC.

Roker received wider exposure when David Letterman asked him to join in an elevator race on an episode of the talk show &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, which taped across the hall from the WNBC news studio in the GE Building. This led to Roker becoming the forecaster for &quot;Weekend Today&quot;. He also substituted on the weekday edition of &quot;Today&quot; when Willard Scott was ill or away.

===Full time on &quot;Today&quot; (1996–present)===
In early 1996, Scott announced his semi-retirement from &quot;Today&quot;. On January 26, 1996, Roker received the regular weekday weather slot. Roker&#x27;s studio remote forecasts, interviewing visitors outside and giving them some camera time, became a staple. Roker conducted more interviews and segments on the show over time. He continues the daily tradition of birthday wishes to centenarians that began with Scott.

In 2005, Roker reported from inside Hurricane Wilma. A popular viral video shows him swept off his feet by the fierce wind and clinging to the cameraman.

In addition to his role as &quot;Today Show&quot; weather man and anchor, Roker co-hosted the third hour of &quot;Today&quot; called &quot;Today&#x27;s Take&quot;, beginning November 12, 2012. &quot;Today&#x27;s Take&quot; was cancelled in February 2017 for &quot;Megyn Kelly Today&quot; and aired its final episode on September 22, 2017. After &quot;Megyn Kelly Today&quot; was cancelled in 2018, Roker returned to co-host &quot;3rd Hour Today&quot;.

During the 2013 inauguration of Barack Obama, Roker received a handshake from Joe Biden. Years later, as an NBC News reporter at Biden&#x27;s own 2021 inauguration, Roker received a fist bump from the newly inaugurated president moments before Biden entered the White House.

In November 2014, Roker embarked on a &quot;Rokerthon&quot;, in which he did a non-stop, 34-hour weather forecast on NBC, from 10:05 p.m. on November 12, 2014, until about 8:00 a.m. on November 14, 2014. The record-setting event was a fundraiser for the Crowdrise Campaign to benefit the military and USO. He held a &quot;Rokerthon 2&quot;, this time reporting weather from all 50 states and Washington, D.C. during the week from November 6 to November 13, 2015, in support of Feeding America. From March 27 until March 31, 2017, he embarked on &quot;Rokerthon 3&quot;, visiting colleges and setting a Guinness World Record at each one, such as the longest conga line on ice and largest human letter.

==Other work==
Roker has hosted NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade since 1995 (with the exception of 2022), where he provides commentary along with some of his &quot;Today Show&quot; colleagues. He is known as the &quot;uptown&quot; host, whose main roles include cutting the ribbon during the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the start of the parade, and interviewing celebrities who are watching the parade from its start at 77th Street. Roker was unable to host the coverage of the parade in 2022 after recovering from blood clots that had led to being hospitalized.

Roker is a game show fan. From 1996 to 1997, he hosted a game show on MSNBC called &quot;Remember This?&quot;. He substituted for Meredith Vieira for a week of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; shows from March 5–9, 2007.

In 2008, Roker hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Family Feud.&quot; 
He hosted a week-long feature on &quot;Today&quot; profiling five game shows and their hosts in July 2016 titled &quot;Game On Today&quot;. He has appeared as a celebrity player on both Merv Griffin game shows &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;.

Roker has hosted programs on Food Network, namely, &quot;Roker on the Road&quot;, and &quot;Tricked-Out Tailgating&quot;. He is also an avid barbecue enthusiast.

Roker provided forecasts for several radio stations, including the New York smooth jazz radio station WQCD (101.9 FM) and for Cleveland smooth jazz station WNWV (107.3 FM), through a service called the &quot;Al Roker Radio Weather Network&quot;, distributed by United Stations Radio Networks. It has since been replaced by Accuweather.
He also had a one and a half hour weekday morning stint live from 5:00–7:00 a.m. on The Weather Channel under the name &quot;Wake Up with Al&quot; which aired from 2009 until 2015.

In June 2001, Roker underwent a total knee arthoplasty (replacement, or &quot;TKA&quot;) on his left knee.

In 2002, Roker underwent gastric bypass surgery to lose weight, which he said he did after failing at numerous diets. Eight months after the surgery, the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; reported he had dropped from his figure. Roker wrote about his battle with weight loss in &quot;Never Goin&#x27; Back: Winning the Weight Loss Battle For Good&quot;, published in 2013.

He returned to the show on January 6, 2023, revealing he also suffered from internal bleeding which necessitated surgery, two bleeding ulcers, colon resection surgery when part or all of the colon is removed, and gallbladder removal surgery. Roker credits his wife and NewYork-Presbyterian physicians and staff for saving his life.

===Controversy===
====2012 Olympic logo controversy====


The following day Roker stated, &quot;I started joking about [the logo]. I want to make this clear—I was not joking about epilepsy or anyone who suffers from epilepsy. We understand and know that this is a serious affliction and would never joke about that. We were joking about the logo—not about epilepsy. If anybody was offended, I heartily and really humbly apologize.&quot;

====Cab driver====
On November 23, 2015, Roker alleged racial discrimination and filed a complaint after he and his son attempted to hail a cab. The cab driver reportedly had passed them in order to pick up a white man on the next block. Roker stated on Twitter that a &quot;cabbie picked up a white guy a block away. Wonder why Uber wins?&quot; According to the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, the driver would either have to pay a $500 fine or possibly have his license suspended.

<doc id="598633" wikidata="Q3366819" url="?curid=598633" title="End-diastolic volume">
<text>In cardiovascular physiology, end-diastolic volume (EDV) is the volume of blood in the right or left ventricle at end of filling in diastole which is amount of blood present in ventricle at the end of diastole. Because greater EDVs cause greater distention of the ventricle, &quot;EDV&quot; is often used synonymously with &quot;preload&quot;, which refers to the length of the sarcomeres in cardiac muscle prior to contraction (systole). An increase in EDV increases the preload on the heart and, through the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart, increases the amount of blood ejected from the ventricle during systole (stroke volume).
==Sample values==
The right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) ranges between 100 and 160 mL. The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) is calculated by RVEDV/BSA and ranges between 60 and 100 mL/m2.

<text>The Hong Kong Commercial Daily () (HKCD) is a Chinese state-owned newspaper, published in broadsheet format in Hong Kong and dubbed “China’s international media window” by the central government. Established in 1952, it was the first financial newspaper in the Chinese language. It is one of the few newspapers authorized by the Hong Kong SAR government to publicize legal announcements, and also the only Hong Kong newspaper allowed to be circulated freely in mainland China. It is controlled by the Hong Kong Liaison Office and has a branch office in Shenzhen.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated the parent company of &quot;Hong Kong Commercial Daily&quot;, Guangdong Xin Wenhua, to be &quot;Captured Public or State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

== History ==
The &quot;HKCD&quot; was founded on October 11, 1952, at a price of 10 HK cents. Its stated aim was to serve as the voice of the local Hong Kong commerce with a focus on worldwide economies especially in Hong Kong and China. It also covered sports and on weekends offered columns and serialized short stories with pictures.

Early coverage of horse and dog racing was curtailed by the government in the early 70s, so as not to promote gambling, leading to a severe decline in circulation.

In December 1989, a majority shareholding was acquired by the Joint Publishing (HK) Company Limited (the joint company of The Commercial Press (H.K.) Ltd, Chung Hwa Book Co., and Joint Publishing) for HK$160 million.

In 1995, &quot;HKCD&quot; launched a mainland edition in cooperation with mainland publishing companies. Since 1996, an online version has been available.

In May 2005, the paper was upgraded priced at HK$3 in Hong Kong and overseas while in Mainland China it sold for 3 yuan within Guangdong Province and 5 yuan in other provinces. 
The new version of the paper emphasizes business news from Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta, along with some sports coverage.

In 2015, assistant editor-in-chief Long Zhenyang was placed under &quot;political measures&quot; for comments he made during the 2014 Hong Kong protests and regarding the demolition of churches in Zhejiang. For the following year, he did not work as an editor but was allowed to continue writing, and in February 2016 resigned and sought political asylum in the United States, comparing the sociopolitical climate in Chinese politics to the Cultural Revolution, and saying that &quot;All hope for social reform and reforms to China’s political system, have now been extinguished.&quot;

<doc id="598638" wikidata="Q5375773" url="?curid=598638" title="End-systolic volume">
<text>End-systolic volume (ESV) is the volume of blood in a ventricle at the end of contraction, or systole, and the beginning of filling, or diastole.

ESV is the lowest volume of blood in the ventricle at any point in the cardiac cycle.
The main factors that affect the end-systolic volume are afterload and the contractility of the heart.
==Uses==
End systolic volume can be used clinically as a measurement of the adequacy of cardiac emptying, related to systolic function. On an electrocardiogram, or ECG, the end-systolic volume will be seen at the end of the T wave. Clinically, ESV can be measured using two-dimensional echocardiography, MRI (magnetic resonance tomography) or cardiac CT (computed tomography) or SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography).

==Sample values==
Along with end-diastolic volume, ESV determines the stroke volume, or output of blood by the heart during a single phase of the cardiac cycle. The stroke volume is the difference between the end-diastolic volume and the end-systolic volume. The end-systolic values in the table below are for the left ventricle:

The right ventricular end-systolic volume (RVESV) normally ranges between 50 and 100 mL.

<text>The Aston Martin DB7 is a car that was produced by British luxury car manufacturer Aston Martin from September 1994 to December 2004. It was designed by Ian Callum and Keith Helfet as a grand tourer in coupé and convertible bodystyles. The prototype was complete by November 1992 and debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1993. The six-cylinder DB7 (based on the Jaguar AJ6 engine) was positioned as an &quot;entry-level&quot; model below the hand-built V8 Virage introduced a few years earlier. This model was the most-produced Aston Martin automobile up to that point in time, with more than 7,000 built before it was replaced by the DB9 in 2004.

== Overview ==
The DB7, known internally as the &quot;XX project&quot;, was made mostly with resources from Jaguar Cars and had the financial backing of the Ford Motor Company, owner of Aston Martin from 1988 to 2007. The DB7&#x27;s platform is an evolution of the Jaguar XJS platform, though with many changes.

The DB7 began life as a successor to the Jaguar XJS envisioned by Tom Walkinshaw of TWR. Walkinshaw had been impressed by the XJS&#x27; potential after driving it in the European Touring Car Championship in the late 1970s and early 1980s and wanted to re-body the car so it would have more modern styling. He initially wanted to engage Peter Stevens to design such a car but he refused due to his on going projects at the time. Walkinshaw then engaged Ian Callum, who was new in the car design work at the time, to design the car.

Jaguar had been struggling to replace the XJS due to its weak financial position. A project codenamed the XJ41/42 (41 for the coupé, 42 for the convertible) was already in development stage in the company, mooted to be called the F-Type when completed and was designed by Keith Helfet. When American automobile manufacturer Ford acquired both Jaguar and Aston Martin, the new management cancelled the XJ41/42 project in 1990 because of the car&#x27;s heavier weight than the XJS, the project&#x27;s high budget and also the employee overtime spent on the car. Seeing the potential of the abandoned project, Walkinshaw based his concept on the XJ41 and tasked Ian Callum to design his envisioned body around the XJ41. He presented the completed car to Jaguar&#x27;s management who rejected it.

Due to the development of the Jaguar XJ220, Ford had not been very keen on development of new Aston Martin models, considering high development costs and the market in the wake of the 1990s economic downturn. Aston Martin CEO at the time, Walter Hayes approached Walkinshaw as he had seen the potential in Walkinshaw&#x27;s proposition to succeed. Development started with a project name of XX. Ian Callum was again tasked to redesign the car so it would look like an Aston Martin. Due to a limited financial backing at the time, the final product shared many components from other marques owned by Ford. The tail lights came from the Mazda 323 F, the exterior chrome door handles came from the Mazda 323 Estate, the side reflectors and interior door handles came from the Mazda MX-5, the front indicator lenses came from the Mazda MX-3 and the interior door mirror switches came from the Ford Scorpio. The only foreign component would be the wing mirrors which were shared with the Citroën CX. The whole project cost US$30 million.

These vehicles were fitted with the Tibbe disc tumbler lock barrel design as used on Ford vehicles around the time of this vehicle&#x27;s manufacture. The difference between Ford locks and the ones fitted to the DB7 is the fact the DB7 utilises 8 discs rather than 6, hence the key blade and the lock barrel is longer. Jaguar vehicles also used the 8 disc Tibbe locks.

An alternate DB7 proposal was considered in 1991 to develop a 6-cylinder platform from the Escort RS Cosworth&#x27;s 4x4 system.

On 1 January 1993, Jac Nasser was appointed the new chairman of Ford Europe. He presented the finished car, which had yet to be named, to the general public at the 1993 Geneva Motor Show. Due to the positive and overwhelming reception, the car was put into production as the Aston Martin DB7.

The positive response also prompted Jaguar to use the platform for the XJS&#x27; successor. The car was redesigned by Geoff Lawson and was launched in the market as the Jaguar XK which uses an evolution of the XJS platform (called the X100 by Jaguar) and the cars share a family resemblance, although the DB7 was more expensive than the XK.

The DB7 was engineered in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, by TWR on behalf of Aston Martin. The engines continued to be built in Kidlington during the production run of the vehicle.

With the production of the Virage (soon rechristened &quot;V8&quot; following Vantage styling revisions) continuing at Newport Pagnell, a new factory was acquired at Bloxham, Oxfordshire that had previously been used to manufacture the XJ220, where every DB7 would be built throughout its production run. The DB7 and its variants were the only Aston Martin automobiles produced in Bloxham and the only ones with a steel unit construction inherited from Jaguar (Aston Martin had traditionally used aluminium for construction of the bodies of their cars, and models introduced after the DB7 use aluminium for the chassis as well as for many major body parts).

The convertible &quot;Volante&quot; version was unveiled at the North American International Auto Show held in Detroit in 1996. Both versions initially had a supercharged straight-six engine that has a power output of and of torque. In the United States, the Coupé was sold for US$140,000, and the Volante for US$150,000. Works Service provided a special Driving Dynamics package, which greatly enhanced performance and handling for drivers who wanted more than what the standard configuration offered. The straight-6 models were phased out in mid-1999 due to lack of market interest.


== Variants ==
===V12 Vantage===

In 1999, the more powerful DB7 V12 Vantage was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show. Its 5.9-litre, 48-valve, Aston Martin V12 engine has a power output of and of torque. It has a compression ratio of 10.3:1. Two transmission choices were available, those being a TREMEC T-56 six-speed manual or a &quot;ZF 5HP30&quot; five-speed automatic. Aston Martin claimed the car had a top speed of either with the manual gearbox or with the automatic gearbox, and could accelerate from 0–97 km/h (60 mph) in 4.9 seconds. The V12 Vantage is long, wide, high, with a weight of . Aesthetic differences from the straight-6 DB7 include different wing mirrors and large fog lamps under the headlamps along with &quot;DB7 Vantage&quot; badging at the rear.

After the launch of the Vantage, sales of the base DB7 with the supercharged straight-6 engine had reduced considerably so its production ended by mid-1999.

===V12 GT and GTA===
In 2002, a new variant was launched, named V12 GT or V12 GTA when equipped with an automatic transmission (the A referring to the automatic transmission itself). It was essentially an improved version of the Vantage, with its V12 engine now having a power output of and of torque for the manual GT, although the GTA retained the engine having a power output of and of torque of the standard DB7 Vantage. The DB7 GT also received a shorter final drive ratio (4.09 for the DB7 GT compared to 3.77 for the manual DB7 Vantage). This resulted in dramatically improved mid-range performance and defined the different character of the DB7 GT compared to the DB7 Vantage (see table below). Additionally, the GT and GTA chassis had substantially updated suspension from the DB7 Vantage models. Aesthetically, compared to the Vantage it has a mesh front grille, vents in the bonnet (hood), a boot (trunk) spoiler, an aluminium gear lever, optional carbon fibre interior trim and new wheels. It also has front and rear vented disc brakes made by Brembo. When being tested by Jeremy Clarkson on &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2003, he demonstrated the car&#x27;s ability to pull away in fourth gear and continue until it hit the rev limiter: the speedometer indicated . Production of the GT and GTA was extremely limited, as only 190 GTs and 112 GTAs were produced worldwide and only 64 GTs and 17 GTAs were shipped to the US market, out of a total of 302 cars.

==Special editions==
A number of special-edition DB7 cars were built:
* DB7 I6
** 1998 Alfred Dunhill Edition – 78 (of an announced 150) &quot;Dunhill Silver platinum metallic&quot; cars with a built-in humidor
** 1998 Neiman-Marcus Edition – 10 &quot;Jet Black&quot; cars for the 1998 Neiman Marcus Christmas catalogue
** 1999 Stratstone Edition – 19 &quot;Bowland Black&quot; cars, 9 coupes and 10 Volantes
** 1998 Beverly Hills Edition – 6 &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;, 2 coupes and 4 Volantes
* DB7 V12 Vantage
** 2003 Jubilee Limited Edition – 24 &quot;Jubilee Blue&quot; cars were made for Europe and 26 were made for North America to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II
** 2002 Keswick Limited Edition – 10 &quot;Ferrari Nero Daytona Black&quot;, 5 coupes and 5 Volantes
** 2003 Anniversary Edition – 55 (of an announced 100) &quot;Slate Blue&quot; cars to celebrate the end of DB7 Vantage production

==Special models==
Two special edition variants were made at the end of the DB7&#x27;s production run, the &quot;DB7 Zagato&quot; and &quot;DB AR1&quot;.

===DB7 Zagato===

The DB7 Zagato was introduced at the Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance in August 2002 and later shown at the Paris Motor Show the following October.

It was only offered for the 2003 model year, with a limited run of 99 cars built (a 100th car was produced for the Aston Martin museum), all of which immediately sold out. The car has a steel body designed in collaboration between Andrea Zagato at Zagato and the then chief designer of Aston Martin Henrik Fisker and features the signature &#x27;double-bubble&#x27; Zagato roofline. Other features include a unique Analine leather interior not found on the normal DB7 and Zagato styled five-spoke alloy wheels. The car was only available in the UK, Europe and Southeast Asia.

Like the DB7 Vantage on which it is based, the DB7 Zagato is powered by a 6.0 L V12 engine that has been tuned to now produce at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm. Power goes to the rear wheels via a 6-speed manual transmission or an optional 5-speed automatic. It featured upgraded suspension and brakes as well It has a top speed of and a 0–60 mph acceleration time of 4.9 seconds.

Unlike the later DB AR1, the Zagato is built on a shortened chassis that has a shorter wheelbase and is shorter overall. It is also approximately lighter than the standard DB7.

===DB AR1===

The DB AR1 (standing for &quot;American Roadster 1&quot;) was introduced at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2003. It is based on the DB7 Vantage Volante and features a unique body designed by Zagato in collaboration with Henrik Fisker that is very similar to the previous coupé variant, but retaining a full-length chassis. Only 99 examples were produced for sale, though Aston Martin built one additional example for their own factory collection. They were only offered for the U.S. market. The AR1 was intended for sunny American states and as such had no roof of any kind. Collectors elsewhere in the world have attempted to remedy this, but long-time DB AR1 owner Robert Stockman commissioned Zagato to construct a small folding convertible top. The resulting electrically operated unit is very slight, referred to as a &quot;shelter&quot; rather than a roof by Andrea Zagato, and hides behind the seats when not in use.

The DB AR1 uses the 5.9 litre, 48-valve, V12 engine from the DB7 producing at 6000 rpm and of torque at 5000 rpm. It has a top speed of and a 0–60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time of 4.9 seconds. 
== One-offs ==
===DB7 i6 GT Competition Prototypes===
Aston Martin planned on a gentleman&#x27;s racer programme featuring the DB7. For this purpose, Prodrive was commissioned to create a racing DB7 based on the first DB7 production car. This car features a red noseband. A second car, built by Works Service, followed and had a yellow noseband. The plans for the racing series were cancelled.

===DB7 V8 road car by Works Service===
In 1998, Works Service was given the task of supplying a DB7 powered by the famous V8. To make things more interesting, Works Service opted to use the 6.3 litre variant as also seen in the Virage 6.3. Unique features to distinguish this car include twin power bulges on the bonnet including brass coloured mesh grilles for additional cooling.

===DB7 V12 prototype by TWR===
TWR owner Tom Walkinshaw commissioned a one-off model in 1996 for his ownership based on the Aston Martin DB7. The car was fitted with a 6.4-litre Jaguar-TWR V12 engine based on a 6.0-litre V12 engine. The engine had a revised steel crankshaft and specially designed four-valves per cylinder heads. The twin cam-shafts worked by a unique chain drive mechanism. The engine has a claimed power output of at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm.

Power was transferred to the rear wheels by an AP racing twin-plate clutch and the engine was mated to a 6-speed Borg Warner T-56 manual transmission. The car had an estimated top speed of due to a longer final gear ratio. On the exterior, the car had a specially designed body kit and a rear spoiler for improved downforce. The car was fitted with wider Yokohama tyres for enhanced grip and to handle the power of the engine and had specially designed 20-spoke alloy wheels.

==Concept car==
===Twenty Twenty===

During the 2001 Geneva Motor Show, Italdesign presented an open-top concept car based on the DB7 mechanicals. The Aston Martin Twenty Twenty was designed in such a way as to overlay the structural extruded aluminium panels and beams over the car&#x27;s carbon and plastic bodywork. The name &#x27;Twenty Twenty&#x27; was meant to invoke a futuristic design intended for the year 2020. Two front seats were protected by a roll-over hoop, behind which two smaller seats were hidden by a tonneau cover. Both Giorgetto Giugiaro and his son Fabrizio were responsible for the design work. The working concept car was powered by a 5.9-litre V12 engine, claimed to be uprated to 500 PS.

<doc id="598647" wikidata="Q157264" url="?curid=598647" title="Rumex">
<text>The docks and sorrels, genus Rumex, are a genus of about 200 species of annual, biennial, and perennial herbs in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae.
Members of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native.

Some are nuisance weeds (and are sometimes called dockweed or dock weed), but some are grown for their edible leaves. &quot;Rumex&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species, and are the only host plants of &quot;Lycaena dispar&quot; and &quot;Lycaena rubidus.&quot;

==Description==
They are erect plants, usually with long taproots. The fleshy to leathery leaves form a basal rosette at the root. The basal leaves may be different from those near the inflorescence. They may or may not have stipules. Minor leaf veins occur. The leaf blade margins are entire or crenate.

The usually inconspicuous flowers are carried above the leaves in clusters. The fertile flowers are mostly hermaphrodites, or they may be functionally male or female. The flowers and seeds grow on long clusters at the top of a stalk emerging from the basal rosette; in many species, the flowers are green, but in some (such as sheep&#x27;s sorrel, &quot;Rumex acetosella&quot;) the flowers and their stems may be brick-red. Each seed is a three-sided achene, often with a round tubercle on one or all three sides.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Within the family Polygonaceae, it is placed in the subfamily Polygonoideae. The genus &quot;Emex&quot; was separated from &quot;Rumex&quot; by Francisco Campderá in 1819 on the basis that it was polygamous (i.e. had both bisexual and unisexual flowers on the same plant). However, some species of &quot;Rumex&quot; subg. &quot;Acetosa&quot; also have this characteristic, and most other features that are supposed to distinguish &quot;Emex&quot; are found in species of &quot;Rumex&quot;. Accordingly, in 2015, Schuster et al. demoted &quot;Emex&quot; to a subgenus of &quot;Rumex&quot;.

Within the subfamily Polygonoideae, &quot;Rumex&quot; is placed in the tribe Rumiceae, along with the two genera &quot;Oxyria&quot; and &quot;Rheum&quot;. It is most closely related to &quot;Rheum&quot;, which includes Rhubarb.

==Uses==

These plants have many uses. Broad-leaved dock (&quot;Rumex obtusifolius&quot;) used to be called butter dock because its large leaves were used to wrap and conserve butter.

&quot;Rumex hymenosepalus&quot; has been cultivated in the Southwestern US as a source of tannin (roots contain up to 25%), for use in leather tanning, while leaves and stems are used for a mordant-free mustard-colored dye.

These plants are edible. The leaves of most species contain oxalic acid and tannin, and many have astringent and slightly purgative qualities. Some species with particularly high levels of oxalic acid are called sorrels (including sheep&#x27;s sorrel &quot;Rumex acetosella&quot;, common sorrel &quot;Rumex acetosa&quot;, and French sorrel &quot;Rumex scutatus&quot;), and some of these are grown as leaf vegetables or garden herbs for their acidic taste.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Rumex obtusifolius&quot; is often found growing near stinging nettles, owing to both species favouring a similar environment, and there is a widely held belief that the underside of the dock leaf, squeezed to extract a little juice, can be rubbed on the skin to counteract the itching caused by brushing against a nettle plant. This home remedy is not supported by any science, although it is possible that the act of rubbing may act as a distracting counterstimulation, or that belief in the dock&#x27;s effect may provide a placebo effect.

In traditional Austrian medicine, &quot;R. alpinus &quot;leaves and roots have been used internally for treatment of viral infections.

Rumex nepalensis is also has a variety of medicinal uses in the Greater Himalayas, including Sikkim in Northeastern India.

==Fossil record==
Several fossil fruits of &quot;Rumex&quot; sp. have been described from middle Miocene strata of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark.
 One fossil fruit of a &quot;Rumex&quot; species has been extracted from a borehole sample of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland. This fossil fruit is similar to the fruits of the extant species &quot;Rumex maritimus&quot; and &quot;Rumex ucranicus&quot; which both have fossil records from the Pliocene and Pleistocene of Europe.

<text>Darrell K Royal (July 6, 1924 – November 7, 2012) was an American gridiron football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Mississippi State University (1954–1955), the University of Washington (1956), and the University of Texas (1957–1976), compiling a career college football record of 184–60–5. In his 20 seasons at Texas, Royal&#x27;s teams won three national championships (1963, 1969, and 1970), 11 Southwest Conference titles, and amassed a record of 167–47–5. He won more games than any other coach in Texas Longhorns football history. Royal also coached the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (CFL) for one season in 1953. He never had a losing season as a head coach for his entire career. Royal was an All-American at the University of Oklahoma, where he played football from 1946 to 1949. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1983. Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin, Texas, where the Longhorns play their home games, was renamed in his honor in 1996.

==Early life==
&quot;K&quot; was Royal&#x27;s given middle name, not an abbreviation. He received it in honor of his mother, Katy, who died when he was an infant. She died of cancer, but because of the stigma surrounding the disease at that time, Royal was led to believe until he was an adult that she had died giving birth to him.

==Playing career==
In 1942, during World War II, Royal finished Hollis High School, where he had played football. He joined the United States Army Air Corps, where he played football for the 3rd Air Force team during 1945 and was spotted and recruited by scouts for the University of Oklahoma Sooners football program. He played quarterback and defensive back at the University of Oklahoma under his mentor, coach Bud Wilkinson, from 1946 to 1949. While attending Oklahoma, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity.

Royal was most noted for his prowess as a defensive back, where his 18 career interceptions and his three interceptions in the 1947 game against Oklahoma A&amp;M (now Oklahoma State) are still Sooner records.

Royal&#x27;s part-time contributions as quarterback had a similar impact, despite the fact that he shared time with Jack Mitchell and Claude Arnold at the position. He threw a 43-yard pass against North Carolina in the 1949 Sugar Bowl. Royal holds the fourth-best winning percentage in school history (minimum 15 starts) with a 16–1 mark as a part-time quarterback starter. His 11–0 mark as a starter in 1949 ranks as one of the best seasons in school history.

In 1992, Royal was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame.

==Coaching career==

===Early positions===
Royal served as an assistant coach at North Carolina State, Tulsa and Mississippi State. He coached the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, and in 1954, he returned to Mississippi State for his first collegiate head coaching job. After two seasons, he left for Washington in the Pacific Coast Conference, but stayed in Seattle for less than ten months.

===University of Texas===
Royal took over as head coach at the University of Texas (UT) on December 18, 1956. The team went from a 1–9 record in 1956, their worst record ever, to a 6–4–1 mark in 1957 and a berth in the Sugar Bowl. Within two years, Royal had the Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl as the number-four team in the country. In Royal&#x27;s 20 years as head coach, Texas never had a losing season. Royal posted a record at Texas, and his overall record was . Some of his most memorable games were against the Arkansas Razorbacks, and fellow College Football Hall of Fame head coach Frank Broyles.

With Royal at the helm, Texas won the school&#x27;s first three national championships (1963, 1969 and 1970), won or shared 11 Southwest Conference championships, and made 16 bowl appearances. His 1963 and 1969 teams finished the season undefeated and untied—something no Longhorn team would do again until 2005.

Royal&#x27;s teams were known for being very run-oriented. The quote, &quot;Three things can happen when you pass, and two of them are bad,&quot; is often attributed to Royal, but Royal himself attributed it to another run-first coach, Woody Hayes.
Royal&#x27;s coaching tactics were the subject of criticism in Gary Shaw&#x27;s exposé of college football recruiting and coaching practices, &quot;Meat on the Hoof&quot;, which was published in 1972, six years after Shaw left the Texas football program.

Beginning in 1962, Royal also served as Texas&#x27; athletic director. He retired from coaching in 1976 and remained director of athletics until 1980. He then served as special assistant to the university president on athletic programs.

During his tenure, Royal oversaw the integration of African-Americans into the UT athletics program. At that time, while UT began admitting black students in 1956 and opening the athletics program to them in 1963, there were no black student-athletes well into the late 1960s.

In a confidential University of Texas memo dated November 10, 1959 which related to how various coaches at the university felt about black players, it was stated that &quot;Coach Royal has coached Negro students, but says they create problems. White players particularly resented Negro boys coming in their room and lounging on their beds. Darrell was quite pronounced in not wanting any Negroes on his team until other Southwest Conference teams admit them and until the housing problem is solved or conditions change.&quot;

In 2005, Royal retrospectively noted that &quot;things they are a-changing. But they weren&#x27;t changing that quickly around here at the time.&quot; He offered a scholarship to Julius Whittier (1950-2018) of San Antonio after the last recipient dropped out due to poor academic performance, and Whittier became the first black student-athlete to play for the Texas Longhorns football team. Whittier went on to graduate from the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs in 1976 with a master&#x27;s degree and worked as a chief prosecutor with the Dallas District Attorney&#x27;s Office.

Royal also coached Freddie Steinmark, who was a member of the 1969 Longhorns National Championship team and subsequently died from bone cancer. Steinmark has been the topic of several books and a 2015 movie, &quot;My All American&quot; where Royal was portrayed by Aaron Eckhart.

In 1996, the University honored Royal by renaming Texas Memorial Stadium as Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium. Royal was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983.

Coach Royal was famous for the inspirational Royalisms he deployed as motivational tools. These sayings include:

* &quot;God gives talent, size, speed. But a guy can control how hard he tries.&quot;
* &quot;I want to be remembered as a winning coach, but I also want to be remembered as an honest and ethical coach.&quot;
* &quot;You&#x27;ve got to think lucky. If you fall into a mud hole, check your back pocket—you might have caught a fish.&quot;
* &quot;Punt returns will kill you quicker than a minnow can swim a dipper.&quot;
* &quot;Don&#x27;t matter what they throw at us. Only angry people win football games.&quot;

==Late life and death==
Royal spent his retired years enjoying life with his wife, Edith, and close friends such as former president Lyndon B. Johnson and noted musician Willie Nelson. He enjoyed playing golf and spending time in nature. In 1991, Royal paid $117,350 for Willie Nelson&#x27;s Pedernales Country Club after it was seized by the IRS due to Nelson&#x27;s tax debt. He, along with professional baseball player Pete Runnels, also helped found a co-ed summer camp, Camp Champions in Marble Falls, Texas, which is still in existence today.

Royal died on November 7, 2012, due to complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He is interred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas.

Royal was survived by his wife Edith (b. 1925), whom he married on July 26, 1944. They have a son, Sammy Mack, and two predeceased children, Marian Royal Kazen (1945–73) and David Wade Royal (1952–82), both of whom died in automobile-related accidents.

<text>The New York School was an informal group of American poets, painters, dancers, and musicians active in the 1950s and 1960s in New York City. They often drew inspiration from surrealism and the contemporary avant-garde art movements, in particular action painting, abstract expressionism, jazz, improvisational theater, experimental music, and the interaction of friends in the New York City art world&#x27;s vanguard circle.
==People==
Frank O&#x27;Hara was at the center of the group before his death in 1966. Because of his numerous friendships and his post as a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, he provided connections between the poets and painters such as Jane Freilicher, Fairfield Porter, and Larry Rivers (who was O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s lover). There were many joint works and collaborations, particularly between poets such as O&#x27;Hara, Kenneth Koch, John Ashbery, and James Schuyler: Rivers inspired a play by Koch, Koch and Ashbery together wrote the poem &quot;A Postcard to Popeye&quot;, Ashbery and Schuyler wrote the novel &quot;A Nest of Ninnies&quot;, and Schuyler collaborated on an ode with O&#x27;Hara, whose portrait was painted by Rivers.

Ron Padgett, Dick Gallup, Joe Brainard, and Ted Berrigan came to the group from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Koch, O&#x27;Hara, Schuyler, and Ashbery were quite different as poets, but they admired each other and had much in common personally:

* Except for Schuyler, all overlapped at Harvard University,
* Except for Ashbery, all did military service,
* Except for Koch, all reviewed art,
* Except for Ashbery, all lived in New York during their formative years as poets.

All four were inspired by French Surrealists such as Raymond Roussel, Pierre Reverdy, and Guillaume Apollinaire. David Lehman, in his book on the New York poets, wrote: &quot;They favored wit, humor and the advanced irony of the (that is, the insolent prank or jest) in ways more suggestive of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg than of the New York School abstract expressionist painters after whom they were named.&quot;

==Poetry==
Concerning the New York School poets, critics argued that their work was a reaction to the Confessionalist movement in Contemporary Poetry. Their poetic subject matter was often light, violent, or observational, while their writing style was often described as cosmopolitan and world-traveled.

The poets often wrote in an immediate and spontaneous manner reminiscent of stream of consciousness writing, often using vivid imagery. They drew on inspiration from Surrealism and the contemporary avant-garde art movements, in particular the action painting of their friends in the New York City art world circle such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning.

Poets often associated with the New York School include John Ashbery, Frank O&#x27;Hara, Joe Brainard, Kenneth Koch, James Schuyler, Barbara Guest, Ted Berrigan, Bernadette Mayer, Alice Notley, Tom Clark, Clark Coolidge, David Shapiro, Lorenzo Thomas, Ted Greenwald, Eileen Myles, Kenward Elmslie, John Giorno, Barbara Barg, Jerome Sala, Elaine Equi, Frank Lima, Ron Padgett, Lewis Warsh, Tom Savage and Joseph Ceravolo.

==Visual art==

The New York School which represented the New York abstract expressionists of the 1950s was documented through a series of artists&#x27; committee invitational exhibitions commencing with the 9th Street Art Exhibition in 1951 and followed by consecutive exhibitions at the Stable Gallery, NYC: Second Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, 1953; Third Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, 1954; Fourth Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, 1955; Fifth Annual Exhibitions of Painting and Sculpture, 1956 and Sixth New York Artists’ Annual Exhibition, 1957.

Included in the New York School were Bradley Walker Tomlin, Robert Goodnough, Rosemarie Beck, Joan Mitchell, and Philip Guston.

Other New York School artists, including those of the 1960s, have included painters Richard Pousette-Dart, Cecile Gray Bazelon, William Baziotes, Nell Blaine, Seymour Boardman, Ilya Bolotowsky, Ernest Briggs, Peter Busa, Lawrence Calcagno, Nicolas Carone, Nanno de Groot, Beauford Delaney, Lynne Mapp Drexler, Edward Dugmore, Amaranth Ehrenhalt, John Ferren, Perle Fine, Joseph Glasco, Karl Hagedorn, John Hultberg, Albert Kotin, Clarence Major, Knox Martin, Hugh Mesibov, Ray Parker, Misha Reznikoff, Joop Sanders William Scharf, Ethel Schwabacher, Kendall Shaw, Gloria Shapiro, Thomas Sills, Merton Simpson, Hedda Sterne, and Jack Stewart. In addition, painter/sculptors Karel Appel, Claire Falkenstein, Betty Parsons, and Antoni Tàpies are known as members of the New York School.

===Galleries===
The Anita Shapolsky Gallery in New York City specializes in 1950s and 1960s New York School art, and exhibits expressionism, geometric abstraction, and painterly abstraction. It most frequently exhibits works in oil and acrylic, as well as sculpture. The Tibor de Nagy Gallery and Stable Gallery have also exhibited New York School art, and in 1998, the Gagosian Gallery also in New York City presented an exhibit of New York School art.

==Music==

The term also refers to a circle of composers in the 1950s which included John Cage, Morton Feldman, Earle Brown and Christian Wolff. Their music influenced the music and events of the Fluxus group, and drew its name from the Abstract Expressionist painters above.

==Dance==
During the 1960s the Judson Dance Theater located at the Judson Memorial Church, New York City, revolutionized Modern dance. Combining in new ways the idea of Performance art, radical and new Choreography, sound from avant-garde composers, and dancers in collaboration with several New York School Visual artists.

The group of artists that formed Judson Dance Theater are considered the founders of Postmodern dance. The theater grew out of a dance composition class taught by Robert Dunn, a musician who had studied with John Cage. The artists involved with Judson Dance Theater were avant-garde experimenatalists who rejected the confines of ballet technique, vocabulary and theory.

The first Judson concert took place on July 6, 1962, with dance works presented by Steve Paxton, Freddie Herko, David Gordon, Alex and Deborah Hay, Yvonne Rainer, Elaine Summers, William Davis, and Ruth Emerson. Seminal dance artists that were a part of the Judson Dance Theater include:
David Gordon, Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, Lucinda Childs, Deborah Hay, Elaine Summers, Sally Gross, Aileen Passloff, and Meredith Monk. The years 1962 to 1964 are considered the golden age of the Judson Dance Theater.

During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s New York School artists collaborated with several other choreographer / dancers including: Simone Forti, Anna Halprin, Merce Cunningham, Martha Graham, and Paul Taylor.

<text>Leonard P. Liggio (July 5, 1933 – October 14, 2014) was a classical liberal author, research professor of law at George Mason University and executive vice president of the Atlas Network in Fairfax, Virginia.

== Career ==
In 1965, Liggio gave lectures with Russell Stetler on &quot;Imperialism and Anti-Imperialism: The Ideological Question in Vietnam&quot; for the newly founded Free University of New York. He provided editorial direction for &quot;Literature of Liberty: A Review of Contemporary Liberal Thought&quot;, a periodical published by the Cato Institute from 1978 to 1979, then by the Institute for Humane Studies from 1980 to 1982.

Liggio was a visiting professor of law at the Francisco Marroquin University in Guatemala City, at the Academia Istropolitana in Bratislava (Slovakia), at the Institute for Political and Economic Studies (Georgetown University) and at the University of Aix-en-Provence, France. He was executive director of the John Templeton Foundation Freedom Project at the Atlas Network, where he led the International Freedom Project from 1998 to 2003. He was a distinguished senior scholar with the Institute for Humane Studies, where he served as director of Programs in History and Social Theory from 1974 to 1977, as executive vice-president from 1979 to 1980 and then as president from 1980 to 1989.

He became the chairman of its program committee for the 2002 meeting in London, England. He was then vice-president of the Mont Pelerin Society from 2000 to 2002 and its president from 2002 to 2004. He has been senior vice-president since 2004 and due to leave in 2006.

From 1988 to 1998, he had been a trustee of the Philadelphia Society, of which he was president from 1992 to 1993 and from 1994 to 1995.

<doc id="598655" wikidata="Q3961435" url="?curid=598655" title="Sinclair Breweries">
<text>Sinclair Breweries Limited is the parent company for Orkney and Atlas ales. Orkney Brewery was founded in March 1988 at the old schoolhouse in Sandwick, Orkney, one mile from Skara Brae and was one of Scotland&#x27;s first microbreweries. Atlas was formed in 2002 and merged with Orkney Brewery, where both beers are now brewed. Owned and run by Orcadian, Norman Sinclair, Orkney Brewery is Orkney&#x27;s oldest brewery.

The brewery operates all year long brewing and supplying beer to the UK, Europe, Australia, Canada and the US with the Visitor Centre running from Spring to Autumn. The visitor centre is equipped with a Tasting Hall offering a full menu and Orkney Brewery Ales as well as shop where local crafts, merchandise and the beers are sold.

==History and development==
The brewery is located in the former west mainland Victorian school in Quoyloo, which was founded in 1878. When Norman Sinclair took over in 2006, he made sure the school was preserved as much as possible while the brewery grew, especially since it was the very school his father attended as a boy. In 2010 Norman rebuilt it into a new 30 barrel brew plant. The old school part was turned into a visitor&#x27;s centre and tasting hall. The visiting centre was awarded five-star status by the national tourism organisation VisitScotland, just weeks after opening to the public. 

==Availability==
The cask ales are available in various pubs around Britain and at British beer festivals. The filtered bottled ales are sold throughout Europe, North America, Canada, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and most of the European countries.

Bottled beer can also be found in supermarkets across the UK such as Waitrose, Sainsbury&#x27;s, Tesco, Lidl, Co-operative and Asda.

==Beers==
The Orkney brewery produces cask ale and filtered beer in bottles, and since October 2005, a lager. &quot;Dark Island&quot; a rich, fruity, vinous dark ale, is the biggest seller. Dark Island has won Champion Beer of Scotland on several occasions. &quot;Red MacGregor&quot;, a 4% bitter has won the World Cask Beer Gold Medal (BIIA 2001). The same name is used for a 5% premium bitter available filtered in the bottle.

Orkney brewery uses isinglass in the production of all of its beers, making them unsuitable for vegetarians.

Atlas Brewery was originally based in Kinlochleven and situated in a category B listed former aluminium smelting facility. It later closed in 2010 with operations relocated to Orkney. Among its beers are Nimbus Pale Ale, Latitude Pilsner, and Three Sisters Scotch Ale which are available on tap and in bottles throughout Lochaber and Scotland. They also produce a number of seasonal beers.

===Skull Splitter===
&quot;Skull Splitter&quot; is an 8.5% abv wee heavy &quot;Skull Splitter&quot; won the award of Supreme Champion Winter Beer of Britain 2001 at CAMRA&#x27;s national winter celebration of beer. &quot;Skull Splitter&quot; takes its name after Torfinn Hausakljuv who was nicknamed &quot;Skullsplitter&quot;. Hausakluif was the 7th Viking Earl of Orkney sometime around 950 AD.

<doc id="598657" wikidata="Q7054497" url="?curid=598657" title="North Carolina General Assembly of 1777">
<text>The [[North Carolina General Assembly]] of 1777 met in two sessions in New Bern, North Carolina, from April 7 to May 9, 1777, and from November 15 to December 24, 1777. This was the first North Carolina legislature elected after the last provincial congress wrote the first North Carolina Constitution. This assembly elected Richard Caswell as the state&#x27;s first constitutional governor (he had been serving as acting governor by action of the provincial congress).

Each of the 38 counties of North Carolina were authorized to elect one senator and two representatives to the House of Commons. In addition, six boroughs (also called districts) elected one House member each. An additional district, Washington District, had one senator and no representative in the House of Commons. Washington District comprised the lands that later became part of Tennessee in 1789. It was referred to as a District in 1776 and 1777 and Washington County after 1777.

==History==
The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 created a strong legislature and a weak executive. The constitution created a bicameral legislature consisting of a Senate made up of one representative from each county and a House of Commons with two members from each county and one member from each of seven designated districts, including Washington District. House members had to own at least 100 acres of land and Senate members had to own at least 300 acres of land. Members were not paid for their services. The governor was chosen annually. Thus, Richard Caswell was chosen the first governor of the State of North Carolina. The governor had no veto power and little control over patronage, He could not convene, prorogue, or dissolve the legislature.

Members of the legislature were elected by popular vote annually. As such, they were the only state officials elected by popular vote. The constitution allowed that &quot;all freemen of the age of twenty-one years, who have been inhabitants of any one county within this State twelve months immediately preceding the day of any election, and shall have paid public taxes shall be entitled to vote for members of the House of Commons for the county in which he resides&quot;. It also allowed &quot;that all freemen, of the age of twenty-one years, who have been inhabitants of any one county within the State twelve months immediately preceding the day of any election and possessed of a freehold within the same county of fifty acres of land for six months next before, and at the day of election, shall be entitled to vote for a member of the Senate.&quot; Restrictions were placed on voting for town or district members, i.e. &quot;That all persons possessed of a freehold in any town in this State, having a right of representation and also all freemen who have been inhabitants of any such town twelve mouths next before and at the day of election, and shall have paid public taxes, shall be entitled to vote for a member to represent such town in the House of Commons: -- Provided always, That this section shall not entitle any inhabitant of such town to vote for members of the House of Commons, for the county in which he may reside, nor any freeholder in such county, who resides without or beyond the limits of such town, to vote for a member for said town.

The Constitution of 1776 required the General Assembly to &quot;appoint judges of the Supreme Courts of Law and Equity, Judges of Admiralty, and Attorney-General,&quot; who were commissioned by the Governor and held office during good behavior. Acting under this authority, the General Assembly in 1776 divided the State into six judicial districts. Under the act of 1777 three judges, Samuel Ashe, Samuel Spencer, and James Iredell, were chosen.

The General Assembly of 1777 was also responsible for electing Councilors of State. They elected the following councilors on April 18, 1777:
* William Cray from Onslow County
* William Haywood from Edgecombe County
* Joseph Leech from Craven County
* Edward Starkey from Onslow County
* Thomas Eaton from Bute County
* Cornelius Harnett from New Hanover County
* William Taylor from Duplin County

The General Assembly of 1777 elected James Glasgow from Dobbs County as North Carolina Secretary of State.

From 1777 to 1779, the State was divided into two districts, Northern and Southern, each with a treasurer. John Ashe from New Hannover County was elected treasurer of the Southern District. Samuel Johnston from Chowan County was elected treasurer of the Northern District but declined to serve, so William Skinner was elected.

Waightstill Avery from Burke County was elected Attorney-General by the 1777 legislature.

The General Assembly of 1777 elected the following Judges of the Superior Court: James Iredell (17771778, Samuel Ashe (17771795), and Samuel Spencer (17771794).

The constitution gave the Senate and House of Commons the power to appoint the generals and field-officers of the militia, and all officers of the regular army of this State.

<text>The WECT Tower was a 2,000 ft (609.6m)-tall mast used as antenna for TV-broadcasting, including broadcasting the analog television signal of WECT channel 6. It was built in 1969 and was situated along NC 53 south of White Lake in Colly Township in Bladen County, North Carolina, United States. Before demolition, WECT Tower was, along with several other masts, the seventh tallest man-made structure ever created; and was not only the tallest structure in North Carolina, but also the tallest in the United States east of the Mississippi River.

On September 8, 2008, WECT ceased regular transmission of their analog signal from the Bladen County tower, relying instead on its newer digital transmitter in Winnabow. Following the switch, the analog signal remained on air until the end of September as a &quot;Nightlight&quot;, broadcasting an instructional video explaining installation of converters and UHF antennas, but many who were able to receive WECT&#x27;s former VHF analog signal would no longer be able to receive the station at all digitally, due to a shift to a UHF channel and a vastly smaller coverage area.

WECT continued to utilize the former analog tower for electronic news-gathering purposes before donating the tower and site to the Green Beret Foundation in 2011. On September 20, 2012 at 12:47 PM, the tower was demolished with explosives to be scrapped. Proceeds from the sale of the land and the scrap metal of the tower will go to the foundation.

<text>James Edward Sullivan (18 November 1862 – 16 September 1914) was an American sports official of Irish descent. He was one of the founders of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) on Jan 21, 1888, serving as its secretary from 1889 until 1906 when he was elected as President of the Amateur Athletic Union from 1906 to 1909. He declined a fourth term and was re-elected to his former position as secretary-treasurer until his sudden death which followed an emergency operation. Sullivan also served as the chairman of the Greater New York Irish Athletic Association in 1903 and on the New York City Board of Education from 1908 to 1912. In 1911 he served as chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission.

==Biography==
He was born on 18 November 1862 in New York City.

His business career began in 1878 at Frank Leslie&#x27;s publications. In 1880, he started a paper &quot;The Athletics News&quot;. His career continued in sports publishing, and sporting goods businesses. His athletics on the track had started in 1877 as a member of the Pastime Athletic Club. In 1888 and 1889 he won the all round championship of the club.

He also was one of the most influential people in the early Olympic movement, although his relationship with IOC president Pierre de Coubertin was tense. Sullivan was also an organizer of the Outdoor Recreation League and served as its second president. Sullivan was the advertising representative of Spalding, which provided running shoes, implements, balls and gloves for many sports.

==1904 St. Louis Olympic Games==
Sullivan was a chief organizer of the 1904 Summer Olympics. He decided to allow only one water station on the 24.85-mile course of the marathon even though it was conducted in heat over unpaved roads choked with dust. His ostensible reason was to conduct research on &quot;purposeful dehydration,&quot; even though dehydration is potentially fatal. The marathon ended with the worst ratio of entrants to finishers (14 of 32) and by far the slowest winning time, 3:28:45, almost 30 minutes slower than the next slowest winning time at the 1900 Summer Olympics. He also organized the Anthropology Days, a racist and cynical attempt to demonstrate athletic white superiority.

==1912 Olympic Games==
The 1912 Summer Olympics allowed female divers and swimmers, but Sullivan, on behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, barred American women from participating even though there were capable women willing to participate.

American athlete of Indian origin Jim Thorpe competed in the 1912 games and won gold medals in the pentathlon and the decathlon. However, those medals were stripped by the AAU and the USOC, with Sullivan playing a prominent role in the decision, following reports that Thorpe had previously played semi-professional baseball. There is evidence that the AAU was aware of Thorpe&#x27;s status before the games and allowed him to compete, only to rescind his medals afterward. Thorpe&#x27;s gold medals were posthumously restored to him in 1983 and presented to his children in a solemn ceremony.

==Death and funeral==

In 1911 he was injured in a train wreck in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He died on 16 September 1914 at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, after an operation on his intestines. For the funeral on 19 September 1914, his body was conveyed from his home, 540 West 114th Street, to St. Aloysius Gonzaga&#x27;s Church, at 132d Street and Seventh Avenue, where a requiem Mass was held.

==Legacy==
James E. Sullivan created &quot;The Athletic News&quot; in 1880. The 1914 National Outdoor Track and Field Championships were postponed (Sept 19 to Oct 3) in his honor (after his death). In 1930, the AAU established the James E. Sullivan Award in his honour. It is awarded annually to the best amateur athlete in the US. In 1977, he was inducted into the National Track &amp; Field Hall of Fame.

Sullivan was also the Records Chair for the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU).

==Publications==
*&quot;The Olympic games, Athens&quot;, Spalding Athletic Library (1906)
*&quot;The Olympic games, Stockholm&quot;, Spalding Athletic Library (1912)
*&quot;An Athletic Primer&quot;, Spalding Athletic Library (1907)
*&quot;Official Athletic Almanac&quot;, Spalding Athletic Library (1905 to 1922)

Sullivan was the first President of the American Sports Publishing Company which published the Spalding Athletic Library. Sullivan was editor of several publications.

Sullivan created The Athletic News in 1880. The Athletic News in 1880 was the first USA track and field publication.

<doc id="598666" wikidata="Q6556312" url="?curid=598666" title="Liphook">
<text>Liphook is a village in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire, England. It is 4.1 miles (6.6 km) west of Haslemere, bypassed by the A3 road, and lies on the Hampshire/West Sussex/Surrey borders. It is in the civil parish of Bramshott and Liphook, which includes Bramshott, Griggs Green, Conford, Passfield, Hammer Bottom (also called Hammer Vale), Ludshott Common and Waggoners Wells, and has an area of and a population of 8,491 in 2011.

Liphook has a railway station, on the Portsmouth Direct line.

The village grew as a coaching stop between London and Portsmouth during the 17th and 18th centuries. It served as a base during the First World War and the Second World War for Canadian troops stationed in Southern England.

==History==

===Pre-coaching times===
The first record of Liphook is in the Bramshott Manor Court Rolls to one &#x27;Robert of Lupe&#x27; in 1281. Then follows Matilda of &#x27;Lhupe&#x27; in 1337, William at &#x27;Lupe&#x27; in 1365, John at &#x27;Lepe&#x27; in 1386, and John Maunser at &#x27;Leope&#x27; in 1423. On his death in 1428, John Maunser&#x27;s tenancy at &#x27;Lepe&#x27; between modern London Road and Headley Road is the first identifiable landmark in Liphook. Sir Edmund Pakynham inherited a tenement and land in &#x27;Lepoke&#x27; in 1527, and John Hooke bought the manor of &#x27;Chiltle&#x27; in &#x27;Lippuck&#x27; in 1591. John Speed&#x27;s map of 1610 shows it as Lippocke.

Some people escaped from the manors of Bramshott, Chiltlee and Ludshott to Liphook, an area above the marshes around the River Wey, to evade taxes of their local Lords.

===The coaching age===
Liphook grew further as a coach stop on the London - Portsmouth route. In Tudor times mail was sent from London to Portsmouth via Southampton and the route through Liphook was only used in emergencies, such as the Armada of 1588. The map of 1675 by John Ogilby shows this road bypassing Bramshott and going through Lippock, however the quality of this road was very poor.

Originally travellers&#x27; needs were catered for by stalls, eventually replaced by the half-timbered houses that exist around The Square. Growth accelerated with wagons being replaced by coaches, and coaching in Liphook was firmly established by 1660. The roads were often unmaintained and unsigned - Samuel Pepys records three journeys by this road in May 1661, April 1662 and August 1668, on the last occasion staying in Lippock:

A coach service from London to Portsmouth started in 1688, which coincided with growth of &quot;The Royal Anchor&quot; coaching inn, and other 17th century buildings in The Square. &quot;The Royal Anchor&quot; has a fireback dated 1588 which supports the supposition that there was an earlier building on the site.

In the 17th century the Royal Navy considered the road from Petersfield to Portsmouth impassable for heavy goods in winter. Improvements were made in the 18th century to roads and coaches along with the coming of the turnpike. Turnpiking between Petersfield and Portsmouth began in 1710 and between Kingston and Petersfield via Liphook in 1749. The Old Toll House by Radford Bridge in Liphook dates from the 18th century. Highwaymen were a problem in the 18th century as notices in the Royal Anchor show. By 1784 London-Portsmouth coaches carried mail through Liphook. Turnpiking reduced the journey from London-Portsmouth from two days in the 1660s to 10 hours in 1819. Cary&#x27;s New Itinerary of 1819 records seven coaches on weekdays left London for Portsmouth via Liphook and three during the night.

Local tradition has it that Nelson spent his last night in England in Liphook before sailing for the Battle of Trafalgar. George III and Queen Charlotte on their stay gave permission for &quot;The Blue Anchor&quot; to be renamed &quot;The Royal Anchor&quot;.

In Samuel Lewis&#x27;s 1831 &quot;Topographical Dictionary of England&quot;, he referred to Liphook as a hamlet in the parish of Bramshott.

===The railway era===

The London and South Western Railway came to Liphook in 1859. The Portsmouth Direct line was built after the 1840s &#x27;Railway Mania&#x27;. Originally the LSWR route from London to Portsmouth was via a branch from Southampton to Gosport, where passengers then went on the chain ferry across Portsmouth harbour. This lasted until the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway extended their London-Brighton line to Portchester. Initially the LSWR constructed a branch from Woking to Guildford in 1845 then Godalming in 1849, but were reluctant to extend it to Havant. Thomas Brassey, a railway contractor, was granted Act of Parliament to construct a single track in 1853 (doubling was completed on 1 March 1878 ). The first train arrived in Liphook on 24 January 1859, but a dispute between the LSWR and the LBSCR meant full service was not initiated until 7 May.

Railways caused the long-distance coaching trade to reduce in the village. The railway station became the hub of short-distance horse-drawn transport, with the blacksmiths shop in The Square flourishing until at least 1918.
The railway was originally planned to bypass Liphook, but the Liphook Deviation amendment of the Act of Parliament altered it to its present course. In doing so it bisected the estate of Chiltlee Manor, a split that exists to this day. The northern part remained as fields and the village cricket pitch, until its requisition to become the British Army&#x27;s Ordnance Supply Unit in 1939. After decommissioning it was sold to Sainsbury&#x27;s to form the site of their shop, the Millennium Centre and several other housing developments. The southern part was sold to Mary Anne Robb in 1869, who built the house of Chiltlee Place and the surrounding arboretum in 1880. In the 1960s the site was sold to the Berg firm of builders for construction of their housing estate.

Liphook&#x27;s population grew modestly, from 1,367 in 1861 to 1,614 in 1891. The railway did not cause a more substantial increase, since many could not afford to pay the fare for more than an occasional excursion. The Kelly&#x27;s Directory of 1895 shows far more shopkeepers in Liphook than Bramshott: Liphook had become the predominant centre of the Parish of Bramshott. A few wealthy people however saw the potential of commuter travel, notably Mary Ann Robb and London solicitor William Thomas Longbourn, who bought Foley Manor in 1859. He later sold it to William Barrington Tristram, a former member of the Bombay Council who built the house&#x27;s Victorian extension.

===20th century===
From 1916 to 1928 author and poet Flora Thompson lived in Liphook where her husband was postmaster. Her first work, &quot;Bog-Myrtle and Peat&quot;, was published in 1921 when she lived in Liphook. The roads &#x27;Lark Rise&#x27; and &#x27;Candleford Gate&#x27; are named after two of the works.

During both World War I and II Liphook was the base for Canadian troops, particularly Bramshott Camp. Recent roads in Liphook have been given Canadian place names to commemorate the armed forces of that country which trained in this area during the World Wars. The cemetery of St Mary&#x27;s church in Bramshott has a section of Canadian graves, including those of both war dead and victims of the influenza outbreak of 1918.

Liphook was one of three sites (with Longmoor and Bordon) occupied by the Royal Engineers&#x27; Engineer Stores Depot which, in 1948, employed 700 men. It was established in 1943, originally called Chiltlee Manor Engineer Stores Depot and in 1945 was designated 2 Engineer Stores Depot under the War Office. In 1948 the local MP (for Petersfield), General Sir George Jeffreys, asked the Secretary of State for War, Emanuel Shinwell, whether the men at Liphook were fully occupied as the men themselves stated that they were not. Mr Shinwell promised an investigation. The depot continued its military function until it was closed in 1968.

During the hot summer of 1983, Liphook made the news as the hottest spot (33.7C) in the United Kingdom on three days in July.

==Governance==
Liphook is in the parliamentary constituency of , and included in the civil parish of Bramshott and Liphook together with several other settlements nearby.

==Amenities==
===Transport===
Liphook was located on both the main road (&quot;A3&quot;) and rail (&quot;Portsmouth Direct line&quot;) links between London and Portsmouth, but is now bypassed by the A3. It is served by Liphook railway station.

===Education===
Liphook is the location of the public school Churcher&#x27;s College Junior school, (the Senior school being located in nearby Petersfield) and Highfield Brookham preparatory school. The site previously housed Littlefield school, which was bought by Churcher&#x27;s and converted. Liphook is also the home of Bohunt School, a top fifty secondary state school.

===Sport===

Liphook and Ripsley Cricket Club play on a ground to the southwest of the village just over the border in West Sussex. The club reached the National Village Cup final in 2018, but were beaten at Lord&#x27;s by Folkton and Flixton by 72 runs.

There are two golf courses near the village: Old Thorns, designed by Peter Alliss, is to the west of the village and Liphook Golf Club is to the south, straddling the Portsmouth Road that was formerly the A3.

===Community and culture===
Liphook Millennium Centre contains a cinema and facilities for community events and occasions. Amateur drama has been a feature of village life since before World War 2. Liphook Amateur Dramatic Society (LADS) existed at least between the 1930s (revived 1955) and 1969. Two companies currently (2014) exist - Liphook Amateur Productions (LAMPS) and The MAD (Methodist Amateur Dramatic) Company.

===Local attractions and business===
Local attractions include the Hollycombe Steam Collection. On the last day of British Summer Time (usually the last Saturday in October) the village holds the Liphook Carnival with a procession of floats through the village followed by a bonfire and fireworks. It has taken place since 1903. &quot;Liphook in Bloom&quot; is an annual floral competition. Champneys Forest Mere health spa is south of the village.

<text>A diagram is a symbolic representation of information using visualization techniques. Diagrams have been used since prehistoric times on walls of caves, but became more prevalent during the Enlightenment. Sometimes, the technique uses a three-dimensional visualization which is then projected onto a two-dimensional surface. The word &quot;graph&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for diagram.

== Overview ==
The term &quot;diagram&quot; in its commonly used sense can have a general or specific meaning: 
* &quot;visual information device&quot; : Like the term &quot;illustration&quot;, &quot;diagram&quot; is used as a collective term standing for the whole class of technical genres, including graphs, technical drawings and tables.
* &quot;specific kind of visual display&quot; : This is the genre that shows qualitative data with shapes that are connected by lines, arrows, or other visual links.

In science the term is used in both ways. For example, Anderson (1997) stated more generally: &quot;diagrams are pictorial, yet abstract, representations of information, and maps, line graphs, bar charts, engineering blueprints, and architects&#x27; sketches are all examples of diagrams, whereas photographs and video are not&quot;. On the other hand, Lowe (1993) defined diagrams as specifically &quot;abstract graphic portrayals of the subject matter they represent&quot;.

In the specific sense diagrams and charts contrast with computer graphics, technical illustrations, infographics, maps, and technical drawings, by showing &quot;abstract rather than literal representations of information&quot;. The essence of a diagram can be seen as:
* a &quot;form&quot; of visual formatting devices
* a &quot;display&quot; that does not show quantitative data (numerical data), but rather relationships and abstract information
* with &quot;building blocks&quot; such as geometrical shapes connected by s, arrows, or other visual links.
Or in Hall&#x27;s (1996) words &quot;diagrams are simplified figures, caricatures in a way, intended to convey essential meaning&quot;. These simplified figures are often based on a set of rules. The basic shape according to White (1984) can be characterized in terms of &quot;elegance, clarity, ease, pattern, simplicity, and validity&quot;. Elegance is basically determined by whether or not the diagram is &quot;the simplest and most fitting solution to a problem&quot;.

== Diagrammatology ==
Diagrammatology is the academic study of diagrams. Scholars note that while a diagram may look similar to the thing that it represents, this is not necessary. Rather a diagram may only have structural similarity to what it represents, an idea often attributed to Charles Sanders Peirce. Structural similarity can be defined in terms of a mapping between parts of the diagram and parts of what the diagram represents and the properties of this mapping, such as maintaining relations between these parts and facts about these relations. This is related to the concept of isomorphism, or homomorphism in mathematics. 

Sometimes certain geometric properties (such as which points are closer) of the diagram can be mapped to properties of the thing that a diagram represents. On the other hand, the representation of an object in a diagram may be overly specific and properties that are true in the diagram may not be true for the object the diagram represents. A diagram may act as a means of cognitive extension allowing reasoning to take place on the diagram based on which constraints are similar.

== Gallery of diagram types ==
There are at least the following types of diagrams:

===Logical===
* Logical or conceptual diagrams, which take a collection of items and relationships between them, and express them by giving each item a 2D position, while the relationships are expressed as connections between the items or overlaps between the items, for example:

===Quantitative===
* Quantitative diagrams, which display a relationship between two variables that take either discrete or a continuous range of values; for example:

===Schematic===
* Schematics and other types of diagrams, for example:

Many of these types of diagrams are commonly generated using diagramming software such as Visio and Gliffy.

Diagrams may also be classified according to use or purpose, for example, explanatory and/or how to diagrams.

Thousands of diagram techniques exist. Some more examples follow:

<text>The Frank–Starling law of the heart (also known as Starling&#x27;s law and the Frank–Starling mechanism) represents the relationship between stroke volume and end diastolic volume. The law states that the stroke volume of the heart increases in response to an increase in the volume of blood in the ventricles, before contraction (the end diastolic volume), when all other factors remain constant. As a larger volume of blood flows into the ventricle, the blood stretches cardiac muscle, leading to an increase in the force of contraction. The Frank-Starling mechanism allows the cardiac output to be synchronized with the venous return, arterial blood supply and humoral length, without depending upon external regulation to make alterations. The physiological importance of the mechanism lies mainly in maintaining left and right ventricular output equality.

==Physiology==

The Frank-Starling mechanism occurs as the result of the length-tension relationship observed in striated muscle, including for example skeletal muscles, arthropod muscle and cardiac (heart) muscle. As striated muscle is stretched, active tension is created by altering the overlap of thick and thin filaments. The greatest isometric active tension is developed when a muscle is at its optimal length. In most relaxed skeletal muscle fibers, passive elastic properties maintain the muscle fibers length near optimal, as determined usually by the fixed distance between the attachment points of tendons to the bones (or the exoskeleton of arthropods) at either end of the muscle. In contrast, the relaxed sarcomere length of cardiac muscle cells, in a resting ventricle, is lower than the optimal length for contraction. There is no bone to fix sarcomere length in the heart (of any animal) so sarcomere length is very variable and depends directly upon blood filling and thereby expanding the heart chambers. In the human heart, maximal force is generated with an initial sarcomere length of 2.2 micrometers, a length which is rarely exceeded in a normal heart. Initial lengths larger or smaller than this optimal value will decrease the force the muscle can achieve. For longer sarcomere lengths, this is the result of there being less overlap of the thin and thick filaments; for shorter sarcomere lengths, the cause is the decreased sensitivity for calcium by the myofilaments. An increase in filling of the ventricle increases the load experienced by each cardiac muscle cells, stretching their sarcomeres toward their optimal length.

The stretching sarcomeres augments cardiac muscle contraction by increasing the calcium sensitivity of the myofibrils, causing a greater number of actin-myosin cross-bridges to form within the muscle. Specifically, the sensitivity of troponin for binding Ca2+ increases and there is an increased release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition, stretch of cardiac myocytes increases the releasability of Ca2+ from the internal store, the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as shown by an increase in Ca2+ spark rate upon axial stretch of single cardiac myocytes. Finally, there is thought to be a decrease in the spacing between thick and thin filaments, when a cardiac muscle is stretched, allowing an increased number of cross-bridges to form. The force that any single cardiac muscle cell generates is related to the sarcomere length at the time of muscle cell activation by calcium. The stretch on the individual cell, caused by ventricular filling, determines the sarcomere length of the fibres. Therefore the force (pressure) generated by the cardiac muscle fibres is related to the end-diastolic volume of the left and right ventricles as determined by complexities of the force-sarcomere length relationship.

Due to the intrinsic property of myocardium that is responsible for the Frank-Starling mechanism, the heart can automatically accommodate an increase in venous return, at any heart rate. The mechanism is of functional importance because it serves to adapt left ventricular output to right ventricular output. If this mechanism did not exist and the right and left cardiac outputs were not equivalent, blood would accumulate in the pulmonary circulation (were the right ventricle producing more output than the left) or the systemic circulation (were the left ventricle producing more output than the right).

==Clinical examples==

=== Premature ventricular contraction ===
Premature ventricular contraction causes early emptying of the left ventricle (LV) into the aorta. Since the next ventricular contraction occurs at its regular time, the filling time for the LV increases, causing an increased LV end-diastolic volume. Due to the Frank–Starling mechanism, the next ventricular contraction is more forceful, leading to the ejection of the larger than normal volume of blood, and bringing the LV end-systolic volume back to baseline.

=== Diastolic dysfunction – heart failure ===
Diastolic dysfunction is associated with a reduced compliance, or increased stiffness, of the ventricle wall. This reduced compliance results in an inadequate filling of the ventricle and a decrease in the end-diastolic volume. The decreased end-diastolic volume then leads to a reduction in stroke volume because of the Frank-Starling mechanism.

==History==
The Frank–Starling law is named after the two physiologists, Otto Frank and Ernest Henry Starling. However, neither Frank nor Starling was the first to describe the relationship between the end-diastolic volume and the regulation of cardiac output. The first formulation of the law was theorized by the Italian physiologist Dario Maestrini, who on December 13, 1914, started the first of 19 experiments that led him to formulate the &quot;&quot;legge del cuore&quot; &quot;.

Otto Frank&#x27;s contributions are derived from his 1895 experiments on frog hearts. In order to relate the work of the heart to skeletal muscle mechanics, Frank observed changes in diastolic pressure with varying volumes of the frog ventricle. His data was analyzed on a pressure-volume diagram, which resulted in his description of peak isovolumic pressure and its effects on ventricular volume.

Starling experimented on intact mammalian hearts, such as from dogs, to understand why variations in arterial pressure, heart rate, and temperature do not affect the relatively constant cardiac output. More than 30 years before the development of the sliding filament model of muscle contraction and the understanding of the relationship between active tension and sarcomere length, Starling hypothesized in 1914, &quot;the mechanical energy set free in the passage from the resting to the active state is a function of the length of the fiber.&quot; Starling used a volume-pressure diagram to construct a length-tension diagram from his data. Starling&#x27;s data and associated diagrams, provided evidence that the length of the muscle fibers, and resulting tension, altered the systolic pressure.

<text>Rolling paper is a specialty paper used for making cigarettes (commercially manufactured filter cigarettes and individually made roll-your-own cigarettes). Rolling papers are packs of several cigarette-size sheets, often folded inside a cardboard wrapper. They are also known as &#x27;blanks&#x27;, which are used to encase tobacco or cannabis. It may be flavoured.

Rolling papers are also used for rolling cannabis cigarettes called joints.
==History==

Paper cigarettes became popular in the second half of the 19th century, displacing the more expensive cigars and cigarillos.

As cigars and cigarillos were expensive, the beggars of Spain would collect the cigar butts from the ground and roll them in pieces of paper to be smoked. During the Crimean War this culture became more prevalent and British soldiers learned how to roll tobacco in newspapers. Frequent use of rolling paper became a custom, and to fulfil the need, rolling paper companies Pay-Pay, Smoking, and Rizla emerged.

==Composition==
Cigarette paper is made from thin and lightweight &quot;rag fibers&quot; (nonwood plant fibers) such as flax, hemp, sisal, rice straw, and esparto. The paper is available in rolls and rectangular sheets of varying sizes, and has a narrow strip of glue along one long edge. It may be transparent, colored and flavored. It has a high filler content and a basis weight of 10-28 g/m2. To control the smoking properties, this paper has a porosity that is suited to the type of tobacco and contains additives that regulate burning. One critical paper characteristic is permeability; its primary physical influence is smoke dilution. Among the fillers used are calcium carbonate to influence the permeability and color, magnesium carbonate to improve ash color, or titanium oxide if a particularly white ash is required. Sodium potassium tartrate (Seignette&#x27;s salt), sodium and potassium citrate are used as a combustion regulator in cigarette paper, increased levels result in faster burning papers. Poly(vinyl alcohol) in aqueous solution is used for cigarette adhesives.

A study of commercially available rolling papers found that concentrations of several elements, particularly copper, chromium, and vanadium in some products, may present a hazard to frequent users. Of particular concern is the concentration of copper from pigments used in the papers might result in exposures as high as 4.5–11 times the maximum exposure limits.

Permeability is defined as the measure of the volume of air that flows through a specified area of cigarette paper in a given unit of time. It is measured in CORESTA units. US commercial filter cigarette brands have paper permeability between 14 and 51 CORESTA units. Increased cigarette paper permeability results in increased smoke dilution with air.

Fire-resistant cigarettes, which reduce the risk of fire from unattended cigarettes, are made with special paper that includes a plastic compound, ethylene vinyl acetate. If a cigarette made with this type of paper is left unattended, the plastic in the paper will help the cigarette self-extinguish.

Other specialty papers for tobacco products are:
* Imitation cork paper is a brownish yellow colored paper used for the production of cigarette tips. It has an imitation cork imprint and joins the filter to the tobacco stick.
* Filter encasing paper is used for the production of acetate or cellulose filters. The tip paper may be covered with polyvinyl alcohol.
* Cigar or cigarillo casing paper holds the chopped tobacco together and serves as the inner casing.

==Consumption==
===United States===
In 2008, Tobacconist Magazine called roll-your-own (RYO) the tobacco industry&#x27;s fastest growing segment. It estimates that 2–4% of cigarette smokers in the United States, or approximately 2.6 million people, make their own cigarettes. Many of these smokers have switched in response to increasingly high taxes on manufactured cigarettes.

===Canada===
In 2000, a Canadian government survey estimated that 9% of Canada&#x27;s six million cigarette smokers smoked hand-rolled cigarettes &quot;sometimes or most of the time&quot;, 7% smoked roll-your-owns &quot;exclusively&quot;, and over 90% of rolling papers sold in Canada were for tobacco consumption. A more recent 2009 study has shown that approximately 925,000 Canadians roll their own cigarettes.
===United Kingdom===
According to &quot;The Publican&quot;, &quot;Low price RYO has seen an astonishing rise of 175% in [2007] as cigarette smokers look for cheaper alternatives and to control the size of their smoke&quot;. The National Health Service has reported that roll-your-own use has more than doubled since 1990, from 11% to 24%. Many of these smokers apparently believe that hand-rolled cigarettes are less harmful than manufactured products, although it is equally possible that the increase is due to the steep rise in prices since the early-1990s to the present day.

===Thailand===
In Thailand, smokers of roll-your-own cigarettes have long outnumbered smokers of manufactured brands. A 2008 survey found that 58% of surveyed smokers in Thailand rolled their own cigarettes, compared to just 17% in neighbouring Malaysia.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Ministry of Health reported in 2005 that: &#x27;The ratio of roll-your-own to manufactured or tailor-made cigarettes consumed by New Zealanders has risen over (at least) the past decade, perhaps reflecting price differences between these products, and currently approaching 50 percent overall.&#x27;

===India===
As the prices of cigarettes rise year after year, roll-your-own is becoming a trend among Indian smokers. Rolling papers and rolling tobacco are now easily accessible and can be bought at almost any Pan Shops in India.

==Taxation==
Consumers&#x27; switching to roll-your-own has led to a response among certain tax authorities. In the United States, Indiana and Kentucky tax rolling papers. Kentucky set its tax at $0.25 per pack (for up to 32 leaves, larger packs are taxed at $0.0078 per leaf) in 2006 despite complaints from manufacturers. Louisiana Revised Statute 47:338.261 allows up to $1.25 per pack at retail.

==Regulation==
===United States===
The FDA stated in 2011 that every brand (including private labels) of cigarette rolling papers sold in the US must submit their ingredients and seek agency approval or withdraw from the marketplace by March of that year if they had not been sold in the US before February 15, 2007.

<doc id="598676" wikidata="Q1299082" url="?curid=598676" title="Afterload">
<text>Afterload is the pressure that the heart must work against to eject blood during systole (ventricular contraction). Afterload is proportional to the average arterial pressure. As aortic and pulmonary pressures increase, the afterload increases on the left and right ventricles respectively. Afterload changes to adapt to the continually changing demands on an animal&#x27;s cardiovascular system. Afterload is proportional to mean systolic blood pressure and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).

== Hemodynamics ==
Afterload is a determinant of cardiac output. Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. Afterload is a determinant of stroke volume (in addition to preload, and strength of myocardial contraction). 

Following Laplace&#x27;s law, the tension upon the muscle fibers in the heart wall is the pressure within the ventricle multiplied by the volume within the ventricle divided by the wall thickness (this ratio is the other factor in setting the afterload). Therefore, when comparing a normal heart to a heart with a dilated left ventricle, if the aortic pressure is the same in both hearts, the dilated heart must create a greater tension to overcome the same aortic pressure to eject blood because it has a larger internal radius and volume. Thus, the dilated heart has a greater total load (tension) on the myocytes, i.e., has a higher afterload. This is also true in the eccentric hypertrophy consequent to high-intensity aerobic training. Conversely, a concentrically hypertrophied left ventricle may have a lower afterload for a given aortic pressure. When contractility becomes impaired and the ventricle dilates, the afterload rises and limits output. This may start a vicious circle, in which cardiac output is reduced as oxygen requirements are increased.

Afterload can also be described as the pressure that the chambers of the heart must generate to eject blood from the heart, and this is a consequence of aortic pressure (for the left ventricle) and pulmonic pressure or pulmonary artery pressure (for the right ventricle). The pressure in the ventricles must be greater than the systemic and pulmonary pressure to open the aortic and pulmonic valves, respectively. As afterload increases, cardiac output decreases. Cardiac imaging is a somewhat limited modality in defining afterload because it depends on the interpretation of volumetric data.

== Calculating afterload ==
Quantitatively, afterload can be calculated by determining the wall stress of the left ventricle, using the Young–Laplace equation:

formula_1 where

EDP is end-diastolic pressure in the left ventricle, which is typically approximated by taking pulmonary artery wedge pressure,

EDR is end-diastolic radius at the midpoint of the left ventricle, and

&quot;h&quot; is the mean thickness of the left ventricle wall. Both radius and mean thickness of the left ventricle may be measured by echocardiography.

== Factors affecting afterload ==

Disease processes pathology that include indicators such as an increasing left ventricular afterload include elevated blood pressure and aortic valve disease.

Systolic hypertension (HTN) (elevated blood pressure) increases the left ventricular (LV) afterload because the LV must work harder to eject blood into the aorta. This is because the aortic valve won&#x27;t open until the pressure generated in the left ventricle is higher than the elevated blood pressure in the aorta.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is increased blood pressure within the right heart leading to the lungs. PH indicates a regionally applied increase in afterload dedicated to the right side of the heart, divided and isolated from the left heart by the interventricular septum.

In the natural aging process, aortic stenosis often increases afterload because the left ventricle must overcome the pressure gradient caused by the calcified and stenotic aortic valve, in addition to the blood pressure required to eject blood into the aorta. For instance, if the blood pressure is 120/80, and the aortic valve stenosis creates a trans-valvular gradient of 30 mmHg, the left ventricle has to generate a pressure of 110 mmHg to open the aortic valve and eject blood into the aorta.

Due to the increased afterload, the ventricle has to work harder to accomplish its goal of ejecting blood into the aorta. Thus, in the long-term, increased afterload (due to the stenosis) results in hypertrophy of the left ventricle to account for the increased work required and also to decrease wall stress since wall thickness and wall stress are inversely proportional.

Aortic insufficiency (Aortic Regurgitation) increases afterload, because a percentage of the blood that ejects forward regurgitates back through the diseased aortic valve. This leads to elevated systolic blood pressure. The diastolic blood pressure in the aorta falls, due to regurgitation. This increases pulse pressure.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) &quot;decreases&quot; afterload. In ventricular systole under MR, regurgitant blood flows backwards/retrograde back and forth through a diseased and leaking mitral valve. The remaining blood loaded into the LV is then optimally ejected out through the aortic valve. With an extra pathway for blood flow through the mitral valve, the left ventricle does not have to work as hard to eject its blood, i.e. there is a decreased afterload. Afterload is largely dependent upon aortic pressure.

<doc id="598682" wikidata="Q6214570" url="?curid=598682" title="Trader Vic's">
<text>Trader Vic&#x27;s is a restaurant and tiki bar chain headquartered in Emeryville, California, United States. Victor Jules Bergeron, Jr. (December 10, 1902 in San Francisco – October 11, 1984 in Hillsborough, California) founded a chain of Polynesian-themed restaurants that bore his nickname, &quot;Trader Vic&quot;. He was one of two people who claimed to have invented the Mai Tai. The other was his amicable competitor for many years, Donn Beach of the &quot;Don the Beachcomber&quot; restaurants.

==History==
Bergeron attended Heald College in San Francisco. On November 17, 1934, using $500 in borrowed money, Bergeron opened a small bar/restaurant across from his parents&#x27; grocery store at San Pablo Avenue and 65th Street in the Golden Gate District of Oakland. He named it Hinky Dink&#x27;s. As its popularity spread, the menu and decor developed an increasingly tropical flair, and Hinky Dink&#x27;s soon became Trader Vic&#x27;s.

In 1949, Western Hotels executive Edward Carlson convinced Bergeron to open his first franchised location in the Benjamin Franklin Hotel in Seattle. Originally a small bar named &quot;The Outrigger&quot;, it was expanded into a full restaurant in 1954 and renamed &quot;Trader Vic&#x27;s&quot; in 1960. Due to the restaurant&#x27;s success, Bergeron worked with Western Hotels to open Trader Vic&#x27;s locations in a number of their hotels. In 1940, Bergeron opened a Trader Vic&#x27;s location in Hawaii and in 1951 at 20 Cosmo Place in San Francisco.

Because Bergeron lacked the capital to expand, he partnered with Hilton Hotels. Conrad Hilton opened his first Trader Vic&#x27;s in The Beverly Hilton in 1955. Two years later, Hilton opened another Trader Vic&#x27;s in The Palmer House in Chicago, and then licensed the Trader Vic&#x27;s brand for use throughout his chain for $2,000,000, retaining Bergeron to oversee the decoration, staffing and operation of the restaurants for an annual salary of $65,000. Hilton soon estimated the popular Trader Vic&#x27;s establishments were earning his hotel chain $5 million a year. Sheraton Hotels quickly opened competing chains of tiki restaurants in their hotels, known as Ports O&#x27; Call and Kon-Tiki.

During the Tiki culture fad of the 1950s and 1960s, as many as 25 Trader Vic&#x27;s restaurants were in operation worldwide. They all featured the popular mix of Polynesian artifacts, unique cocktails, and exotic cuisine. The chain of restaurants grew and is credited as one of the first successful themed chains, a marketing model that many other restaurants followed.

In 1972 the original location in Oakland was closed and replaced by a bayfront restaurant in nearby Emeryville, now considered the chain&#x27;s flagship restaurant. In the 1980s and 1990s, the chain began to shrink as the tiki theme carried little resonance with a younger generation. Poor locations or less trendy addresses took a further toll on the chain&#x27;s popularity. While many of the original locations have closed, Trader Vic&#x27;s once again grew to 18 locations around the globe as of July 2018.

As of 2024, there are three Trader Vic&#x27;s restaurants in the United States, one in Europe, ten in the Middle East, two in Asia, and one in Africa.

The Trader Vic&#x27;s Corporation has also franchised restaurants and bars under the names the Mai Tai Lounge (all locations defunct), Trader Vic&#x27;s Island Bar &amp; Grill (opened 2010 in Sarasota, Florida, shuttered in 2013 – where the company experimented with a Margaritaville-like concept), and Señor Pico. There is one remaining Señor Pico location at The Palm Dubai.

==Drinks==
According to the Trader Vic&#x27;s website, the Mai-Tai was invented by &quot;Trader Vic&quot; Bergeron in 1944 in Oakland, California.

Beyond the Mai Tai, Bergeron&#x27;s other more famous drinks included the Fog Cutter and the Scorpion Bowl. Both drinks were served in a specific and highly decorated mug or bowl. His take on a Hot buttered rum was also an early example calling for a specific ceramic mug, in this case a skull. The Scorpion Bowl in particular and its many variations proliferated onto the cocktail menus of virtually all subsequent Tiki bars. The menus from his restaurants could list dozens of different tropical drinks. As was the case with Don the Beachcomber, rum was the hallmark ingredient in most of his cocktails, but Vic is also credited with creating the &quot;Eastern Sour&quot;, which employed less common (for Tiki drinks) rye whiskey, and another drink using even more rarely used tequila (the &quot;Mexican El Diablo&quot;).

==Headquarters==
The company is headquartered in Emeryville, California.

At times the company had its headquarters in several locations in the San Francisco Bay Area, including Corte Madera and San Rafael.

== In popular culture ==

The song &quot;Werewolves of London,&quot; a Top 40 hit co-written by Warren Zevon and appearing on his 1978 album &quot;Excitable Boy&quot;, contains the line &quot;I saw a werewolf drinking a piña colada at Trader Vic&#x27;s.&quot; The Trader Vic&#x27;s in London opened in 1963.

The restaurant is also referenced by Bill Murray&#x27;s character, Frank Cross, to John Forsythe&#x27;s character, Lew Hayward, in the 1988 movie &quot;Scrooged&quot;.

In the film &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot; the character of David Frost orders takeout from Trader Vic&#x27;s while staying in The Beverly Hilton, which formerly had a Trader Vic&#x27;s location inside the hotel. The character orders a cheeseburger. 

In the film &quot;Thunder Force&quot; Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy dine at a Trader Vic&#x27;s (scene filmed on location at Atlanta Trader Vic&#x27;s).

In the New York Times bestseller and 2012 100 Notable Books, &quot;Beautiful Ruins&quot;, by Jess Walter, Trader Vic&#x27;s in Seattle Washington is the setting of a scene between two characters in September 1967. In Chapter 16, &quot;After the Fall&quot; a couple meet at Trader Vic&#x27;s and one walks &quot;into a burst of warm air and bamboo, tiki and totem, dugout canoe hung from the ceiling.&quot;

<doc id="598688" wikidata="Q1062799" url="?curid=598688" title="Thomas Ligotti">
<text>Thomas Ligotti (born July 9, 1953) is an American horror author, lay philosopher, and writer. His writings are rooted in several literary genres – most prominently weird fiction – and have been described by critics as works of philosophical horror, often formed into short stories and novellas in the tradition of gothic fiction. The worldview espoused by Ligotti in his fiction and non-fiction has been described as pessimistic and nihilistic. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called him &quot;the best kept secret in contemporary horror fiction.&quot;

==Career==
Ligotti started his professional writing career in the early 1980s with short stories published in American small press magazines. He was contributing editor to &quot;Grimoire&quot; from 1982 to 1985. In 2015, Ligotti&#x27;s first two collections, &quot;Songs of a Dead Dreamer&quot; and &quot;&quot;, were republished in one volume by Penguin Classics as &quot;Songs of a Dead Dreamer and Grimscribe&quot;. Michael Calia of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote of the reprint that &quot;Horror writer Thomas Ligotti is about to enter the American literary canon. Penguin Classics published a volume of Mr. Ligotti’s short stories, making him one of 10 living writers, including Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo, among the hundreds the imprint has published in the U.S.&quot; Ligotti&#x27;s work received high praise following the publication from the likes of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot;,&quot; The Washington Post&quot;, and&quot; The New Yorker&quot;. Terrence Rafferty contrasts Ligotti with Stephen King, observing, &quot;King, the great entertainer, needs the story as the comedian needs the joke, and when he can’t quite deliver it he dies (in the comedian’s sense). King is a master of horror, though. When inspiration fails, he has the technique to fake it. Thomas Ligotti is a master of a different order, practically a different species. He probably couldn’t fake it if he tried, and he never tries. He writes like horror incarnate.&quot;

Ligotti collaborated with the musical group Current 93 on the albums &quot;In a Foreign Town, In a Foreign Land&quot; (1997, reissued 2002), &quot;I Have a Special Plan for This World&quot; (2000), &quot;This Degenerate Little Town&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Unholy City &quot;(2003), all released on David Tibet&#x27;s Durtro label. Tibet has also published several limited editions of Ligotti&#x27;s books on Durtro Press. Additionally, Ligotti played guitar on Current 93&#x27;s contribution to the compilation album &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, whose proceeds went to the treatment of musician John Balance&#x27;s alcoholism.

==Personal life==
He has cited Thomas Bernhard, William S. Burroughs, Emil Cioran, Vladimir Nabokov, Edgar Allan Poe, Giacomo Leopardi, Samuel Beckett, Franz Kafka, and Bruno Schulz as being among his favorite writers. H. P. Lovecraft is also an important touchstone for Ligotti: a few stories, &quot;The Sect of the Idiot&quot; in particular, make explicit reference to Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos, and one, &quot;The Last Feast of Harlequin&quot;, was dedicated to Lovecraft. Also among his avowed influences are Algernon Blackwood, M. R. James, and Arthur Machen, all &quot;fin de siècle&quot; horror authors known for their subtlety and implications of the cosmic and supernatural in their stories. He has also invoked the influence of philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer and Peter Wessel Zapffe.

Ligotti has suffered from chronic anxiety and anhedonia for much of his life; these have been prominent themes in his work. Ligotti avoids the explicit violence common in some recent horror fiction, preferring to establish a disquieting, pessimistic atmosphere through the use of subtlety and repetition. Ligotti has stated he prefers short stories to longer forms, both as a reader and as a writer, though he has written a novella, &quot;My Work Is Not Yet Done&quot; (2002)

Ligotti&#x27;s ancestry is three-quarters Sicilian, one-quarter Polish, a genetic combination he likes to think &quot;contributed to the bizarre quality of my imagination and to what has been called its &#x27;universality&#x27;.&quot; He says that his Polish grandmother&#x27;s stories, though not horrific, &quot;put me in touch with an older and stranger world than I would otherwise have known and that emerged when I started writing stories so many years later&quot;.

Ligotti attended Macomb County Community College between 1971 and 1973 and graduated from Wayne State University in 1978. For 23 years Ligotti worked as an Associate Editor at Gale Research (now the Gale Group), a publishing company that produces compilations of literary (and other) research. In the summer of 2001, Ligotti quit his job at the Gale Group and moved to south Florida. Politically, he identifies as socialist.

==Influence==
He has been influenced by the &quot;first-person voice in which Nabokov wrote&quot; and the &quot;densely metaphorical style of Bruno Schulz&quot;.

In 2003, Wildside Press published &quot;The Thomas Ligotti Reader: Essays and Explorations&quot;, a collection of essays about Ligotti&#x27;s work edited by Darrell Schweitzer.

Author Jeff VanderMeer has penned numerous pieces praising Ligotti&#x27;s writing, including the introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of &quot;Songs of a Dead Dreamer and Grimscribe&quot;.

In 2014, the HBO television series &quot;True Detective&quot; attracted attention from some of Ligotti&#x27;s fans because of the resemblance of the pessimistic, antinatalist philosophy espoused in the first few episodes by the character of Rust Cohle (played by Matthew McConaughey) and Ligotti&#x27;s own philosophical pessimism and antinatalism, especially as expressed in &quot;The Conspiracy Against the Human Race&quot;. After accusations that dialogue from Cohle&#x27;s character in &quot;True Detective&quot; were lifted from &quot;The Conspiracy Against the Human Race,&quot; the series&#x27; writer, Nic Pizzolatto, confirmed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that Ligotti, along with several other writers and texts in the weird supernatural horror genre, had indeed influenced him. Pizzolatto said he found &quot;The Conspiracy Against the Human Race&quot; to be &quot;incredibly powerful writing&quot;. On the topic of hard-boiled detectives, he asked: &quot;What could be more hardboiled than the worldview of Ligotti or [Emil] Cioran?&quot;

The writing of Ligotti and Eugene Thacker is cited as an influence on the 2021 album &quot;The Nightmare of Being&quot; by the Gothenburg melodic death metal band At the Gates.

<text>Escape is an American radio drama. It was radio&#x27;s leading anthology series of high-adventure radio dramas, airing on CBS from July 7, 1947 to September 25, 1954. 

== Overview ==
Since the program did not have a regular sponsor like &quot;Suspense&quot; (a sister program that often used the same actors and scripts), it was subjected to frequent schedule shifts and lower production budgets, although Richfield Oil signed on as a sponsor for five months in 1950.

Despite these problems, &quot;Escape&quot; enthralled many listeners during its seven-year run. The series&#x27; well-remembered opening combined Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; with this introduction, as intoned by William Conrad and later Paul Frees:
:&quot;Tired of the everyday grind? Ever dream of a life of romantic adventure? Want to get away from it all? We offer you... &quot;Escape!&quot;

Following the opening theme, a second announcer (usually Roy Rowan) would add:
:&quot;Escape&quot;! Designed to free you from the four walls of today for a half-hour of high adventure!&quot;

==Adaptations==
Of the more than 230 &quot;Escape&quot; episodes, most have survived in good condition. Many story premises, both originals and adaptations, involved a protagonist in dire life-or-death straits, and the series featured more science fiction and supernatural tales than &quot;Suspense&quot;. Some of the memorable adaptations include Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot;, Carl Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Leiningen Versus the Ants&quot;, Algernon Blackwood&#x27;s &quot;Confession&quot;, Ray Bradbury&#x27;s oft-reprinted &quot;Mars Is Heaven&quot;, George R. Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Earth Abides&quot; (the program&#x27;s only two-parter), Richard Connell&#x27;s &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; and F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Diamond as Big as the Ritz&quot;.

John Collier&#x27;s &quot;Evening Primrose&quot;, about people who live inside a department store, was later adapted to TV as a Stephen Sondheim musical starring Anthony Perkins. William Conrad, Harry Bartell and Elliott Reid were heard in the chilling &quot;Three Skeleton Key&quot; (broadcast on 15 November 1949), the tale of three men trapped in an isolated lighthouse by thousands of rats; the half-hour was adapted from an &quot;Esquire&quot; short story by the French writer George Toudouze and later remade for the March 17, 1950 broadcast starring Vincent Price, Harry Bartell and Jeff Corey and again for the August 9, 1953 broadcast starring Paul Frees, Ben Wright and Jay Novello.

Other actors on the series included Elvia Allman, Eleanor Audley, Parley Baer, Michael Ann Barrett, Tony Barrett, Harry Bartell, Ted Bliss, Lillian Buyeff, Ken Christy, William Conrad, Ted de Corsia, John Dehner, Don Diamond, Paul Dubov, Sam Edwards, Virginia Gregg, Lou Merrill, Howard McNear, Jess Kirkpatrick, Dee J. Thompson, Shep Menken, Frank Gerstle, George Neise, Jeanette Nolan, Dan O&#x27;Herlihy, Barney Phillips, Forrest Lewis, Robert Griffin, Alan Reed, Bill Johnstone, Sandra Gould, Junius Matthews, Carleton G. Young, Marvin Miller, Frank Lovejoy, Berry Kroeger, Vic Perrin, Elliott Lewis, Eleanore Tanin, Herb Vigran, Jack Webb, Peggy Webber, and Will Wright.

Music was supplied by Del Castillo, organist Ivan Ditmars, Cy Feuer, Wilbur Hatch and Leith Stevens. The primary announcer was Roy Rowan, while the introductory signature voice (the dramatic &quot;voice of Escape&quot;) was played most often by either Paul Frees or William Conrad, with other actors filling in at various times.

A television counterpart aired on CBS TV for a few months during 1950.

The program&#x27;s opening announcement—&quot;Tired of the everyday grind?&quot;—was employed as a slogan for the counterculture magazine, &quot;New Escapologist&quot;.

<doc id="598697" wikidata="Q7752863" url="?curid=598697" title="The Mysterious Traveler">
<text>The Mysterious Traveler was an American media franchise created by Robert Arthur and David Kogan. All versions of the franchise focused on suspense and crime fiction, with occasional elements of horror or science fiction. 

The anthology radio series debuted in 1943 and ran until 1952, featuring a narrator-host known as &quot;the Mysterious Traveler&quot;. The concept was later adapted to magazine in 1952-53, and the comic book format in 1948, 1956-59, and in 1985.

==Radio==
Written and directed by Robert Arthur and David Kogan, the radio series was sponsored by Adam Hats. It began on the Mutual Broadcasting System, December 5, 1943, continuing in many different time slots until September 16, 1952. The lonely sound of a distant locomotive heralded the arrival of the sinister narrator (portrayed by Maurice Tarplin), who introduced himself each week in the following manner:

:This is the Mysterious Traveler, inviting you to join me on another journey into the strange and terrifying. I hope you will enjoy the trip, that it will thrill you a little and chill you a little. So settle back, get a good grip on your nerves and be comfortable—if you can!
The narrator also took an active role in two episodes. In &quot;The Accusing Corpse&quot;, he appears as a coroner named Roger. In &quot;The Good Die Young&quot; he appears as a general practitioner named Doctor Smith.

Cast members included Jackson Beck, Lon Clark, Roger DeKoven, Elspeth Eric, Wendell Holmes, Bill Johnstone, Joseph Julian, Jan Miner, Santos Ortega, Bryna Raeburn, Frank Readick, Luis van Rooten, Ann Shepherd, Lawson Zerbe and Bill Zuckert. Sound effects were by Jack Amrhein, Jim Goode, Ron Harper, Walt McDonough and Al Schaffer.

&quot;Behind the Locked Door&quot;, a popular, much-requested episode which took place in total darkness, was repeated several times during the years. Two archaeologists discover a century-old wagon train that had been sealed in a cave following a landslide. When their Native American guide is mysteriously and brutally attacked, the two, now lost in the darkness, conclude that the descendants of the wagon train are still living in the cave.

Only 75 of the original 370 &quot;Mysterious Traveler&quot; episodes still exist. The popularity of the series spawned other supernatural shows, such as &quot;The Sealed Book&quot;. With scripts by a &quot;Mysterious Traveler&quot; writer and Tarplin as host-narrator, &quot;The Strange Dr. Weird&quot; was a nearly identical program.

==Magazine==

Grace Publishing&#x27;s 1951–52 &quot;Mysterious Traveler&quot; digest-sized magazine ran for five issues with cover paintings by famed pulp illustrator Norman Saunders. The publisher was David Kogan, and managing editor Robert Arthur also contributed many stories. The first issue (November 1951) carried a welcome from the Mysterious Traveler himself:
:This is the Mysterious Traveler, inviting you to join me on another journey into the realm of mystery and suspense. This time the trip is to be made in the pages of a magazine, rather than on the air. Thousands of letters have come to me from the many listeners who enjoy my weekly radio program on the Mutual Broadcasting System, urging me to put some of my stories into printed form.

:This magazine is the answer. Some of the stories in it will be my own, retold for your enjoyment in fiction form by the finest writers of today. But many of the other stories will be favorites of mine, both new and old, written by the world&#x27;s greatest craftsmen of the mystery—such men and women as John Dickson Carr, Dorothy L. Sayers, Brett Halliday, Ray Bradbury, Craig Rice, Lawrence Blochman, all of whom you will find in this issue, and dozens of others who will appear in the issues to come.

:These stories, both new and old, will be the finest I can collect for your enjoyment. They will have mystery, suspense, inventiveness, color—and above all they will be good reading, just as I try to make &quot;The Mysterious Traveler&quot; on the air good listening.

:I hope you will enjoy this magazine, now in your hands for the first time. I hope also that you will let me know if it satisfies you, what kind of stories you would prefer to see in future issues, the titles of any favorite stories you would like me to bring back into print again, or any other comments you wish to make. Write me at: Studio 4, 105 East 15th St., New York 3, New York. And now I invite you to begin our first trip together in print with one of John Dickson Carr&#x27;s most unusual and least known short stories, &quot;The Other Hangman,&quot; which begins on the opposite page. Good reading!

:Yours sincerely,
::The Mysterious Traveler

==Comic books==
Trans-World Publications&#x27; one-shot &quot;Mysterious Traveler Comics&quot; #1 (Nov. 1948) had a direct tie-in with the radio series, including the story &quot;Five Miles Down&quot;, taken directly from an episode scripted for the radio program. Only a single issue was published.

Charlton Comics published a separate Tales of the Mysterious Traveler comic book for 13 issues from 1956 to 1959, followed by two more issues in 1985 shortly before the company went under. Steve Ditko illustrated many stories in this title. Stories intended for future issues saw print in Renegade Press&#x27;s &quot;Murder&quot;. In 1990, Eclipse Comics published a large-format paperback collecting 19 Ditko stories from the Charlton title. Some of those stories were reprinted in Pure Imagination&#x27;s &quot;Steve Ditko Reader&quot;.

==Short story and biography==
Anthony Boucher&#x27;s 1950 detective story anthology, &quot;Four-and-Twenty-Bloodhounds&quot;, paired each story with a brief biography of the detective. In the case of &quot;The Big Money&quot; by Robert Arthur, Boucher apologized to the reader:
:The most disquieting moment in editing this anthology came when I received the biographical questionnaire filled in by the Mysterious Traveler. In answer to the first blank, born __, he had simply inserted: ?. And the succeeding answers were equally disconcerting and not in all cases publishable—though I have forwarded a copy to Miskatonic University for its files. Suffice it that no one—not even his nominal creators, Robert Arthur and David Kogan—knows whether the Traveler is detective, criminal or neither. He is only a sly, insinuating, knowing voice heard weekly over MBS, and here makes his first appearance anywhere in print.

<doc id="598698" wikidata="Q4355674" url="?curid=598698" title="Dimension X (radio program)">
<text>Dimension X was an NBC radio program broadcast mostly on an unsponsored, sustaining basis from April 8, 1950, to September 29, 1951. The first 13 episodes were broadcast live, and the remainder were prerecorded. Fred Wiehe and Edward King were the directors, and Norman Rose was heard as both announcer and narrator, opening the show with: &quot;Adventures in time and space... told [or transcribed] in future tense...&quot; For two months, beginning on July 7, 1950, the series was sponsored by Wheaties.

==Overview==
Preceded by Mutual&#x27;s &quot;2000 Plus&quot; (1950–52), &quot;Dimension X&quot; was not the first adult science fiction series on radio, but the acquisition of previously published stories immediately gave it a strong standing with the science fiction community, as did the choice of established writers within the genre: Isaac Asimov, Robert Bloch, Ray Bradbury, Fredric Brown, Robert A. Heinlein, Murray Leinster, H. Beam Piper, Frank M. Robinson, Clifford D. Simak, William Tenn, Jack Vance, Kurt Vonnegut, Jack Williamson and Donald A. Wollheim. Ernest Kinoy and George Lefferts adapted most of the stories and also provided original scripts.

In &quot;Science Fiction Television&quot; (2004), M. Keith Booker wrote:
:It was not until the 1950s that science fiction radio really hit its stride, even as science fiction was beginning to appear on television as well. Radio programs such as Mutual&#x27;s &quot;2000 Plus&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Dimension X&quot; were anthology series that offered a variety of exciting tales of future technology, with a special focus on space exploration (including alien invasion), though both series also often reflected contemporary anxieties about the dangers of technology.

The series opened with &quot;The Outer Limit,&quot; Ernest Kinoy&#x27;s adaptation of Graham Doar&#x27;s short story from &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; (December 24, 1949) about alien contact. A week later (April 15, 1950), the program presented Jack Williamson&#x27;s most famous story, &quot;With Folded Hands,&quot; first published in the July 1947 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction.&quot;

With a five-month hiatus from January 1951 to June 1951, the series spanned 17 months. All 50 episodes of the series survived and can be heard today. Later, NBC&#x27;s &quot;X Minus One&quot; (1955–58) utilized many of the same actors and scripts.

<doc id="598701" wikidata="Q8042761" url="?curid=598701" title="X Minus One">
<text>X Minus One is an American half-hour science fiction radio drama series that was broadcast from April 24, 1955, to January 9, 1958, in various timeslots on NBC. Known for high production values in adapting stories from the leading American authors of the era, &quot;X Minus One&quot; has been described as one of the finest offerings of American radio drama and one of the best science fiction series in any medium.

==Overview== 
Initially a revival of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Dimension X&quot; (1950–51), the first 15 episodes of &quot;X Minus One&quot; were new versions of &quot;Dimension X&quot; episodes, but the remainder were adaptations by NBC staff writers, including Ernest Kinoy and George Lefferts, of newly published science fiction stories by leading writers in the field, including Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Philip K. Dick, Robert A. Heinlein, Frederik Pohl and Theodore Sturgeon, along with some original scripts by Kinoy and Lefferts.

Included in the series were adaptations of Robert Sheckley&#x27;s &quot;Skulking Permit&quot;, Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Mars Is Heaven&quot;, Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Universe&quot; and &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot;, Pohl&#x27;s &quot;The Tunnel under the World&quot;, J. T. McIntosh’s &quot;Hallucination Orbit&quot;, Fritz Leiber’s &quot;A Pail of Air&quot;, and George Lefferts&#x27; &quot;The Parade&quot;.

The program opened with announcer Fred Collins delivering the countdown, leading into the following introduction (although later shows beginning with Episode 37, were partnered with &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; rather than &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;):

The series was canceled after the 126th broadcast on January 9, 1958. However, the early 1970s brought a wave of nostalgia for old-time radio; a new experimental episode, &quot;The Iron Chancellor&quot; by Robert Silverberg, was produced in 1973, but it failed to revive the series. NBC also tried broadcasting the old recordings, but their irregular once-monthly scheduling kept even devoted listeners from following the broadcasts.

The series was re-released in podcast form beginning on June 22, 2007.

In November 2008, Counter-Productions Theatre Company became the first theater company to stage three episodes, &quot;The Parade&quot;, &quot;A Logic Named Joe&quot;, and &quot;Hallucination Orbit&quot;.

<text>Labial–velar consonants are doubly articulated at the velum and the lips, such as . They are sometimes called &quot;labiovelar consonants&quot;, a term that can also refer to labialized velars, such as the stop consonant and the approximant .

Labial-velars are often written as digraphs. In the Kâte language, however, is written Q q, and as Ɋ ɋ.

Globally, these types of consonants are quite rare, only existing in two regions: West and Central Africa on the one hand, Eastern New Guinea and northern Vanuatu on the other. There are 2 other isolated cases, allophonically in Vietnamese and in the Adu dialect of Nuosu (Yi).

==Plain labial-velar stops==
Truly doubly articulated labial-velars include the stops , the nasal , and the implosive . To pronounce them, one must attempt to say the velar consonants but then close their lips for the bilabial component, and then release the lips. While 90% of the occlusion overlaps, the onset of the velar occurs slightly before that of the labial, and the release of the labial occurs slightly after that of the velar so the preceding vowel sounds as if it were followed by a velar, and the following vowel sounds as if it were preceded by a labial. The order of the letters in and is therefore not arbitrary but motivated by the phonetic details of the sounds.

Phonemic labial–velars occur in the majority of languages in West and Central Africa (for example in the name of Laurent Gbagbo, former president of Ivory Coast; they are found in many Niger–Congo languages as well as in the Ubangian, Chadic and Central Sudanic families), and are relatively common in the eastern end of New Guinea. The rare implosive is only found in Lese, a Nilo-Saharan language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In Southeast Asia, they occur in the Adu dialect of Nuosu (Yi), which aside from its isolated location, is unusual in having a relatively large inventory of labial-velar consonants, including the rare aspirated version: .

Labial–velar stops can also occur as an ejective (unattested) and a voiceless implosive . Floyd (1981) and Clark (1990) report that voiced and voiceless implosives occur in Central Igbo. As stated above, the voiced implosive has been confirmed in Lese.

The Yele language of Rossel Island, Papua New Guinea, has both labial–velars and labial–alveolar consonants. Labial–velar stops and nasals also occur in Vietnamese but only word-finally.

These sounds are clearly single consonants rather than consonant clusters. For example, Eggon contrasts , , and . The following possibilities are possible if tone is ignored:

Allophonic labial-velars are known from Vietnamese, where they are variants of the plain velar consonants and .

==Labialized labial-velars==
Some languages, especially in Papua New Guinea and in Vanuatu, combine the labial–velar consonants with a labial–velar approximant release: , . The extinct language Volow had a prenasalised labial-velar stop with labialization .

==Velar labial clicks==

Bilabial clicks are stops that involve closure at both the lips and the soft palate. Treatments often analyze the dorsal articulation as part of the airstream mechanism, and so consider such stops to be labial. However, there may be a distinction between the velar labial clicks and the uvular labial clicks , which is not captured if they are described as simply labial.

<doc id="598703" wikidata="Q3773506" url="?curid=598703" title="Gordon Richards (jockey)">
<text>Sir Gordon Richards (5 May 1904 – 10 November 1986) was an English jockey who was the British flat racing Champion Jockey 26 times, and is often considered the world&#x27;s greatest jockey. He remains the only flat jockey to have been knighted.

==Early life==

Gordon Richards was brought up in the Shropshire village of Donnington Wood (now part of Telford) where he was born at Ivy Row (now demolished), the third son of eight surviving children of coal miner Nathan and former dressmaker Elizabeth. His mother was the daughter of another miner, William Dean, who was also a lay preacher, and Richards was given a strict Methodist upbringing. The family later moved during his childhood to Wrockwardine Wood where they lived in a row of cottages called The Limes, Plough Road, built on land bought by his mother. His father reared several pit ponies at their home, and fostered the young Richards&#x27; love of equestrian sport. He rode the ponies bareback from an early age, then from the age of seven drove the pony and trap passenger service his family ran between Wrockwardine Wood and Oakengates station. It is said that this is when he developed his unique riding style, using a long rein and an upright stance. He had two brothers, Colin and Clifford, who shared this love of horses and also became jockeys: the latter was a Classic-winning jockey.

==Career==
Leaving school at the age of 13, he became a junior clerk in the warehouse of the nearby Lilleshall Company engineering works, sometimes riding a pony to work. He found work as a clerk monotonous and already held ambitions of a career with horses. He answered a newspaper advertisement to be an apprentice to Martin Hartigan, trainer at the Foxhill Stable near Swindon, Wiltshire, owned by Jimmy White, and on New Year&#x27;s Day 1920 left home to move there.

His riding skills were soon noticed by his new employer, who gave him his first ride in a race at Lincoln on 16 October 1920, after a deal struck during a football match against the neighbouring Osbourne Stables. White had bet on his stable to win, and the match stood at three all when his team were awarded a penalty. White insisted that Richards take it, with the incentive that he would ride at Lincoln the next day if he scored. He did, and got to ride the horse, called Clock-Work. He weighed out at 6 stone 9 pounds. His first win came the following season: Gay Lord at Leicester on 31 March 1921. He soon became known by the nickname of &quot;Moppy&quot;, for his thick, black hair.

===First championship===

His apprenticeship at Foxhill lasted until 1924, when he moved to become first jockey to Captain Thomas Hogg, based at Russley Park, Wiltshire, near Lambourn. That first season as a fully-fledged professional, 1925, he became Champion Jockey for the first time, with 118 wins.

Early in the following year, however, he contracted tuberculosis, which put his burgeoning career in jeopardy. Following diagnosis, he spent the rest of the year in a Norfolk sanitarium. While he was recuperating, he met fellow patient Bill Rowell who was to have a major influence on his life. Rowell became a friend and mentor, teaching the young jockey how to cope with wealth, and his increasing fame among high society in Britain&#x27;s inter-war class system. In Richards&#x27; absence from riding, Tommy Weston won the championship; but by December, he had returned to the saddle and in 1927 regained his title with 164 winners, following up in 1928 and 1929.

By now, shipping magnate William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely had retained his services. Hogg had become his private trainer, in Newmarket. For Glanely, he won his first classics – the 1930 Oaks on Rose of England and the 1930 St Leger on Singapore – and narrowly missed out on a fourth successive title to Freddie Fox. As the season drew to a close, he won the November Handicap for Glanely on Glorious Devon, putting him one ahead of Fox, but Fox won the fourth and fifth races to overhaul him.

===Fred Darling===

After retaking the championship in 1931 with 141 winners, he was made a substantial offer to become stable jockey to Fred Darling. Richards offered Glanely the chance to match it, but he declined. The move proved fruitful, and in his first season he scored 259 victories, breaking Fred Archer&#x27;s longstanding record for the greatest number of wins in a year and becoming a national hero in the process. This included 11 consecutive victories at Chepstow in early October, as he closed in on Archer&#x27;s target of 246, finally surpassing that total on Golden King at Liverpool on 8 November. He would break the record again himself in 1947, and retain it for nearly 50 years.

Throughout the 1930s, he came frustratingly close to winning a first Derby. In 1934, he rode Easton into second, and in 1936 was unlucky on Taj Akbar for the Aga Khan, being badly hampered before again finishing second, this time to the Aga Khan&#x27;s second string Mahmoud. In 1938, Darling&#x27;s two horses were Pasch, on which Richards had won the 2000 Guineas and French import Bois Roussel. Richards stayed loyal to Pasch, and finished third to Bois Roussel. His bad luck in the race was becoming proverbial.

During World War II, Richards was not required to serve in the armed forces on account of his prior tuberculosis. This meant he could keep riding, adding further titles in 1939 and 1940, but missing out again (to Harry Wragg this time) after he broke a leg at Salisbury in May 1941.

On George VI&#x27;s Sun Chariot in 1942, he won the Fillies&#x27; Triple Crown of 1,000 Guineas, Oaks and St Leger. He also won the substitute 2,000 Guineas for the king on Big Game on the way to another championship. In 1943, he became the jockey with the most wins in British history, surpassing Archer&#x27;s career total of 2748 winners on Scotch Mist at Windsor and took a 16th championship.

At Newmarket in 1947, he won the 2,000 Guineas aboard Tudor Minstrel by 8 lengths, the largest winning margin in the race since 1900. It was described shortly afterwards as &quot;possibly the greatest feat in racing.&quot; As heavily backed favourite for the Derby, the horse seemed set to break Richards&#x27; hoodoo in the race; however, he failed to stay and finished fourth. This did not stop Richards&#x27; march to a twentieth championship with the record-breaking total of 269 winners.

His partnership with Fred Darling lasted 16 years, until the trainer retired. Richards said of him, &quot;I unhesitatingly describe him as a genius. There has been no trainer like him and there will never be another.&quot; Sir Noel Murless took over the stable at Beckhampton and Richards continued on as stable jockey. His greatest horse for Murless, was grey sprinter Abernant, dual winner of the Nunthorpe Stakes.

===Later career and knighthood===

Despite the successes, the Derby still eluded him. The 1953 race occurred on a week of great national, and personal celebration for Richards himself, as he became the first jockey to receive a knighthood. On being awarded the knighthood, he memorably joked, &quot;I never dreamed I&#x27;d end up being the shortest knight of the year.&quot; It was awarded &quot;as much in recognition of his exemplary integrity as of his professional achievement&quot;.

This time Sir Gordon rode Pinza, a huge horse for a flat-thoroughbred at 16 hands high, and he rode a terrific race. Pinza was in second position through much of the one-and-half-mile (2414 m) course, competing against the Queen&#x27;s own horse Aureole, and sweeping past the Aga Khan III&#x27;s horse, Shikampur, into first place with just two furlongs remaining. The long-awaited win was accompanied by thunderous cheers from the frenzied crowd. Winning The Derby at what was to be his final attempt was undoubtedly Sir Gordon&#x27;s crowning victory, and he was promptly summoned from the winners&#x27; enclosure to be congratulated by the Queen.

A little over a year later, he broke his pelvis and four ribs when being thrown by Abergeldie in the Sandown Park paddock on 10 July 1954. This enforced his retirement. He had ridden 4,870 winners from 21,843 rides and been champion jockey twenty-six times.

Following his retirement he declined an offer to stand for Parliament as Conservative candidate for his native Wrekin constituency.

==Training career==

Subsequently, Richards trained at Beckhampton and Ogbourne Maizey in Wiltshire, and finally Whitsbury, Hampshire. His training career was less stellar than his riding one, but not without success.

His main owners were the partnership of Sir Michael Sobell and his son-in-law Lord Weinstock. They placed their first horse, London Cry, with Richards in 1957 and he went on to win the Cambridgeshire Handicap of 1958. Richards also trained Pipe Of Peace, the champion two-year-old colt of 1956. The Sobell/Weinstock owned colt Reform was probably his finest horse, winning 11 of his 14 starts including the Champion Stakes, St James&#x27;s Palace Stakes and the Sussex Stakes. He also trained for Lady Beaverbrook when she took up her interest in racing. An early owner was Dorothy Paget, and when she died he was an influence in Sobell and Weinstock purchasing her Ballymacoll Stud, breeding and racing stock. His stable jockey for much of his training career was Scobie Breasley, and when he retired Edward Hide took over.

At the end of the 1970 season, circumstances forced his hand and he had to give up training: the bookmaker William Hill, from whom he leased his stables, wished to restart his breeding operation there. Sobell and Weinstock negotiated to buy West Ilsley Stables from Jakie Astor, but a stipulation of the purchase was that incumbent trainer Dick Hern, and stable jockey Joe Mercer remained in place. He gave up training, but was elected an honorary member of the Jockey Club that year.

He took up the role of Racing Manager in 1971 to Sobell, Weinstock and Lady Beaverbrook, and continued as such until his death. In this capacity he worked closely with Hern and was particularly active in the purchasing of yearlings for Lady Beaverbrook. Under his management these owners had tremendous success with horses such as Sun Prince, Sallust, Admetus, Cistus, Troy and Sun Princess (for Sobell/Weinstock), and Boldboy, Bustino, Relkino, Niniski and Petoski (for Lady Beaverbrook).

==Riding style and reputation==
In rating him the top jockey of the 20th century, the Racing Post said of Richards that he &quot;bestrode the sport like a colossus&quot; and &quot;by his skill, integrity, consistency and longevity in the saddle, and his attractive personality, brought more credit to his profession than any other jockey has ever done.&quot; He was particularly known for his determination and single-mindedness.

He had the &quot;ideal physique&quot; for a jockey, being short, stocky and very strong for his weight, but his style was unorthodox, riding upright and with a long rein. In a driving finish, he would turn almost sideways, flourish his whip and apparently throw his reins at his mount. Even so, horses &quot;ran as straight as a die&quot; for him. John Hislop, an expert in riding technique, noted how Richards would win on horses which no other jockey could have got home first, and had the knack of making an apparently beaten horse run on.

Clive Brittain, who was an apprentice with Murless at the time Richards was there, described him as &quot;a warm, generous and modest man&quot; whose &quot;integrity and loyalty were beyond reproach.&quot; &quot;When you rode work with him, if you made a mistake, he only needed to tell you once. He commanded respect wherever he went.&quot;

It is also said he was a &quot;kind and down-to-earth man, who never lost touch with his Shropshire roots&quot;.

==Personal life==
Richards married Margery Gladys (d. 1982), daughter of Swindon railway carriage fitter Thomas David Winckle on 1 March 1928. They had three sons and a daughter. The daughter and one of the sons were twins, but the son only lived a few hours.

He published his autobiography, &quot;My Story&quot;, in 1955.

==Death and legacy==

Richards died of a heart attack at his home, Dove House, Kintbury, Berkshire, on 10 November 1986. His funeral service was held at St Mary&#x27;s, Kintbury, and he was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Marlborough, Wiltshire.

In his home county of Shropshire his feats were celebrated in Donnington with a pub, The Champion Jockey, named in his honour, and the &#x27;Pinza Suite&#x27; in Telford Theatre (originally Oakengates Town Hall which he officially opened in 1968), named after his winning horse. The public house, demolished 2009, has not survived. On the site of his birthplace in Ivy Row, Donnington, have been built the apartment blocks Gordon House and Richards House in Cordingley Way, which were officially opened by Richards in 1975.

Within racing, the Gordon Richards Stakes, a Group 3 race at Sandown Park, has been named in his honour.

In 1999, the &quot;Racing Post&quot; listed him at number 17 in their list of 100 Makers of 20th century horse racing and number 1 in their list of the Top 50 jockeys of the 20th century.

In 2002, Richards&#x27; record number of victories in a season was exceeded, by jump jockey Tony McCoy, although McCoy had been able to fly between tracks and was able to compete in more races in the season than was possible in Richards&#x27; time. His total of 4,870 winners is still a British record. He also holds the record for the most consecutive winners ridden – 12 (half at a night meeting) – and the record for most years as British flat racing Champion Jockey – 26.

<text>Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD; also Becton Dickinson or Becton) is an American multinational medical technology company that manufactures and sells medical devices, instrument systems, and reagents. BD also provides consulting and analytics services in certain areas.

BD is ranked #211 in the 2024 &quot;Fortune 500&quot; list based on its revenues for the fiscal year ending September30, 2023.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1897 in New York City by Maxwell Becton and Fairleigh S. Dickinson. It later moved its headquarters to New Jersey.

In 2004, BD agreed to pay out US$100 million to settle allegations from competitor Retractable Technologies that it had engaged in anti-competitive behavior to prevent the distribution of Retractable&#x27;s syringes, which are designed to prevent needlestick injury. The lawsuit touched off a series of legal conflicts between the companies. Retractable would accuse BD of patent infringement after BD released a retractable needle of its own. Later Retractable would claim BD was falsely advertising its own brand of retractable needle as the “world’s sharpest needle”.

In October 2014, the company agreed to acquire CareFusion for a price of US$12.2 billion in cash and stock.

In April 2017, Becton, Dickinson and Company announced it would acquire C. R. Bard. The transaction was completed later that year, and the company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BD, rebranded as Bard.

In 2024, BD announced it would acquire Edwards Lifesciences&#x27; critical care unit for $4.2 billion.

== Finances ==
For the fiscal year 2017, Becton Dickinson reported earnings of US$1.030 billion, with an annual revenue of US$12.093 billion, an increase of 10.5% over the previous fiscal cycle. Becton Dickinson&#x27;s shares traded at over US$192 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$63 billion in November 2018.
==Business segments==

Currently there are three business segments.

===BD Medical===
In certain places, BD Medical also offers consulting and analytics related services. BD Medical&#x27;s Consulting services are primarily targeted at hospitals, healthcare systems and networks of healthcare providers.

===BD Life Sciences===
Business units include Biosciences and Integrated Diagnostic Solutions.

Offerings include preanalytical solutions for sample management; immunology research, including flow cytometry and multiomics tools; microbiology and molecular diagnostics; lab automation and informatics; and differentiated reagents and assays.

===BD Interventional===
The company&#x27;s line of plastic conical screwtop test tubes, known as &#x27;Falcon tubes&#x27;, is popular and the term is sometimes used as a generic term for such tubes.

== Environmental and social track record ==
As of February 2010, BD was ranked 18th in the EPA Fortune 500 List of Green Power Purchasers. BD was also listed among the top 100 companies in Newsweek&#x27;s 2009 Green Rankings ranking of the 500 largest American corporations based on environmental performance, policies, and reputation. BD placed third in the health care sector and 83rd overall. In addition, BD has been a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the four and five consecutive years, respectively.

Pfitzer &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) identify BD&#x27;s development of a needleless injection system as an example of leading businesses&#x27; role in creating shared value.

=== Health and safety issues ===
In April 2016, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined BD US$112,700 for safety violations. They found repeat and serious violations of health and safety law that had resulted in two employees having partial finger amputations.

In 2020, C.R. Bard, Inc. and its parent company BD were fined $60 million USD for failing to adequately inform patients about health risks related to their transvaginal mesh devices.

==Recalls==

===2007 Discardit II incident in Poland===
In mid-2007, the firm&#x27;s Discardit II series of syringes numbered 0607186 was withdrawn from hospitals and other medical services around Poland, about half a year after the discovery of remains of dark dust in some syringes, which were alleged to have been from this series. The newspaper Dziennik Online claimed that other series such as 06022444, 0603266, and 0607297 were also suspected of being contaminated. BD recalled and tested the syringes in question, and revealed sterile particulates in 0.013 percent of the products. 

===2010 Q-Syte Luer and IV Catheter partial recall===
In February 2010 BD announced a voluntary product recall of certain lots of BD Q-Syte Luer Access Devices and BD Nexiva Closed IV Catheter Systems. BD stated that the use of the affected devices may cause an air embolism or leakage of blood and/or therapy, which may result in serious injury or death. The approximately 2.8 million BD Q-Syte and 2.9 million BD Nexiva units containing 5 million BD Q-Syte devices that were recalled were distributed in the United States, Asia, Canada, Europe, Mexico, the Middle East, South Africa, and South America. The recall was initiated on Oct. 28, 2009 after BD received complaints of problems due to air entry through a part of the device. BD stated that the cause of the problem was manufacturing deviation and claimed that it corrected the problem. BD announced that it notified customers about the recall by letter and has been working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and worldwide health agencies to coordinate recall activities.

=== 2021 IV Giving Sets ===
In March 2021 BD announced a recall of infusion sets for CC, GP, VP, GW/GW800, SE, and IVAC 590 Alaris Pumps and gravity infusion sets and connectors following the news that a supplier falsified sterilisation documents going back ten years.

<doc id="598706" wikidata="Q4951486" url="?curid=598706" title="Box 13">
<text>Box 13 is a syndicated radio drama about the escapades of newspaperman-turned-mystery novelist Dan Holiday, played by film star Alan Ladd. Created by Ladd&#x27;s company, Mayfair Productions, &quot;Box 13&quot; aired in different cities over different dates and times. It first aired in several United States radio markets in October 1947.

==Synopsis==
To seek out new ideas for his fiction, Holiday ran a classified ad in the &quot;Star-Times&quot; newspaper where he formerly worked: &quot;Adventure wanted, will go anywhere, do anything – write Box 13, Star-Times&quot;. The stories followed Holiday&#x27;s adventures when he responded to the letters sent to him by such people as a psycho killer and various victims.

==Cast and crew==
=== Main cast ===
* Alan Ladd as Dan Holiday
* Sylvia Picker as Holiday&#x27;s scatterbrained secretary, Suzy.
* Edmund MacDonald as police Lt. Kling, Holiday&#x27;s foil.

Guest cast members included Betty Lou Gerson, Frank Lovejoy, Lurene Tuttle, Alan Reed, Luis Van Rooten, and John Beal. Vern Carstensen, who directed &quot;Box 13&quot; for producer Richard Sanville, was also the show&#x27;s announcer.

The series featured music by Rudy Schrager. Russell Hughes, who had previously hired Ladd as a radio actor in 1935 at a $19 weekly salary, wrote most of the scripts, sometimes in collaboration with Ladd. The partners in Mayfair Productions were Ladd and Bernie Joslin, who had previously run the chain of Mayfair Restaurants.

Raymond Burr appeared in some episodes.

== Adaptations ==
At least one attempt to convert the series for television was tried when Ladd appeared in an adaptation of &quot;Daytime Nightmare&quot; (retitled &quot;Committed&quot;) on CBS&#x27; &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; (December 5, 1954). Russell Hughes, who was then working at Columbia, reworked the script for the small screen. The show was produced by Jaguar, Ladd&#x27;s own company.

The TV show did not result in a series. In 1956, Jaguar worked on another attempt to make a series, but Ladd was no longer cast as Holiday. Ladd&#x27;s wife Sue Carol was reported as being involved in casting.

In 1958, Jaguar hired Charles Bennett to adapt the series into a television series.

In 1959, Ladd was working on scripts for TV series with Aaron Spelling. Bill Leslie was to play the lead, opposite Ann McRae.

Shortly before his death, Ladd announced plans to make a feature film version of the show. He said he would play the lead and the film would have featured 13 cameos from stars that Ladd had worked with in the past. Possible names included William Bendix, Veronica Lake, Brian Donlevy, and Macdonald Carey.

&quot;Box 13&quot; was also re-imagined (rather than a straight adaptation or continuation) as a comic book series in 2010, by David Gallaher and Steve Ellis, and published by ComiXology. It is published digitally by ComiXology and published in print by Red 5 Comics.

<doc id="598708" wikidata="Q1091848" url="?curid=598708" title="Facultative anaerobic organism">
<text>A facultative anaerobic organism is an organism that makes ATP by aerobic respiration if oxygen is present, but is capable of switching to fermentation if oxygen is absent.

Some examples of facultatively anaerobic bacteria are &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; spp., &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;Listeria&quot; spp., &quot;Shewanella oneidensis&quot; and &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;. Certain eukaryotes are also facultative anaerobes, including fungi such as &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and many aquatic invertebrates such as nereid polychaetes.

It has been observed that in mutants of &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot; that underwent mutations to be either obligate aerobes or anaerobes, there were varying levels of chromatin-remodeling proteins. The obligate aerobes were later found to have a defective DNA gyrase subunit A gene (&quot;gyrA&quot;), while obligate anaerobes were defective in topoisomerase I (&quot;topI&quot;). This indicates that topoisomerase I and its associated relaxation of chromosomal DNA is required for transcription of genes required for aerobic growth, while the opposite is true for DNA gyrase. Additionally, in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; K-12 it has been noted that phosphofructokinase (PFK) exists as a dimer under aerobic conditions and as a tetramer under anaerobic conditions. Given PFK’s role in glycolysis, this has implications for the effect of oxygen on the glucose metabolism of &quot;E. coli&quot; K-12 in relation to the mechanism of the Pasteur effect.

There may exist a core network of transcription factors (TFs) that includes the major oxygen-responsive ArcA and FNR control the adaptation of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; to changes in oxygen availability. Activities of these two regulators are indicative of spatial effects that may affect gene expression in the microaerobic range. It has also been observed that these oxygen-sensitive proteins are protected within the cytoplasm by oxygen consumers within the cell membrane, known as terminal oxidases.

== Functions ==
Facultative anaerobes are able to grow in both the presence and absence of oxygen due to the expression of both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory chains using either oxygen or an alternative electron acceptor. For example, in the absence of oxygen, &quot;E. coli&quot; can use fumarate, nitrate, nitrite, dimethyl sulfoxide, or trimethylamine oxide as an electron acceptor. This flexibility allows facultative anaerobes to survive in a number of environments, and in environments with frequently changing conditions.

Several species of protists use a facultative anaerobic metabolism to enhance their ATP production, and some can produce dihydrogen through this process.

== As pathogens ==
Since facultative anaerobes can grow in both the presence and absence of oxygen, they can survive in many different environments, adapt easily to changing conditions, and thus have a selective advantage over other bacteria. As a result, most life-threatening pathogens are facultative anaerobes.

The ability of facultative anaerobic pathogens to survive without oxygen is important since their infection is shown to reduce oxygen levels in their host&#x27;s gut tissue. Moreover, the ability of facultative anaerobes to limit oxygen levels at infection sites is beneficial to them and other bacteria, as dioxygen can form reactive oxygen species (ROS). These species are toxic to bacteria and can damage their DNA, among other constituents.

<doc id="598711" wikidata="Q7718394" url="?curid=598711" title="The Black Museum (radio series)">
<text>The Black Museum is a radio crime-drama program produced by Harry Alan Towers, which was broadcast in the USA on the Mutual network in 1952. It was then broadcast in Europe in 1953 on Radio Luxembourg, a commercial radio station, and was not broadcast by the BBC until 1991. 

Towers was based in London, but this series was recorded in Sydney, Australia. In 1946 Towers and his mother, Margaret Miller Towers, started a company called Towers of London that sold various syndicated radio shows around the world, including &quot;The Lives of Harry Lime&quot; with Orson Welles, &quot;The Secrets of Scotland Yard&quot; with Clive Brook, &quot;Horatio Hornblower&quot; with Michael Redgrave, and a series of Sherlock Holmes stories featuring John Gielgud as Holmes, Ralph Richardson as Watson and Welles as Moriarty.
Towers visited Australia in the late 1940s and set up production facilities in Sydney. &quot;The Black Museum&quot; was produced in Sydney by Creswick Jenkinson on behalf of Towers of London. It had a top-line Australian cast including Joe McCormick, plus American actor Harp McGuire. Orson Welles&#x27;s introductions were recorded on tape in London, then flown to Australia to be added to the locally recorded performances. This was the first series to be produced in Australia in this way.

&quot;The Black Museum&quot; was based on real-life cases from the files of Scotland Yard&#x27;s Black Museum. The programme was transcribed in 1951 and was broadcast in the United States in 1952 on Mutual. More than 500 of the network&#x27;s stations carried it. Ira Marion was the scriptwriter and music for the series was composed and conducted by Sidney Torch.
This same music was used for the opening credits of, and incidental music in, the 1955 film &quot;They Can&#x27;t Hang Me&quot;, starring Terence Morgan.

Orson Welles was both host and narrator of stories of horror and mystery, based on Scotland Yard&#x27;s collection of murder weapons and various ordinary objects once associated with historical true crime cases. The show&#x27;s opening began:
:&quot;This is Orson Welles, speaking from London.
:(Sound of Big Ben chimes)
:The Black Museum ... a repository of death. Here in the grim stone structure on the Thames which houses Scotland Yard is a warehouse of homicide, where everyday objects ... a woman’s shoe, a tiny white box, a quilted robe ... all are touched by murder.&quot;

Robert Rietti played the lead roles and Keith Pyott was often in the cast.

In 2002, Towers produced &quot;The Black Museum&quot; for television and hired director Gregory Mackenzie to be the showrunner and director for the anthology series using the original narration by Welles. The adaptation was shot on location in London in a film noir style and the pilot starred Michael York as Scotland Yard Inspector Russell.

==Programme format and themes==
Walking through the museum, Welles would direct attention to one or two objects with a comment about them, then pause at the specific exhibit, his description of the artifact serving as a device to lead into a wryly narrated dramatized tale of a brutal murder or a vicious crime connected to the artifact. In the closing: &quot;Now until we meet again in the same place and I tell you another tale of the Black Museum&quot;, Welles would conclude with his signature radio phrase, &quot;I remain, as always, obediently yours&quot;.

With the story themes deriving from objects in the collection (usually with the names of the people involved changed but the facts remaining true to history), the 51 episodes had such titles as &quot;The Tartan Scarf&quot; and &quot;A Piece of Iron Chain&quot; or &quot;Frosted Glass Shards&quot; and &quot;A Khaki Handkerchief&quot;. An anomaly to the series was an episode called &quot;The Letter&quot;, as this was the only story not about murder but about forgery.

== Broadcast history ==
In the United States, the series aired on the Mutual Network in 1952. It was rebroadcast on KABC, Los Angeles, California, in 1963–1964 and on KUAC (FM) in Fairbanks, Alaska, in 1967.

Beginning on 7 May, 1953, it was also broadcast over Radio Luxembourg, sponsored by the cleaning products Dreft and Mirro. Since the BBC carried no commercials, Radio Luxembourg aired sponsored programmes broadcast at night to the UK.

In the United States, there was a contemporary programme called &quot;Whitehall 1212&quot; written and directed by Wyllis Cooper and broadcast by NBC, that was similar in scope to &quot;The Black Museum&quot;. It was hosted by Chief Superintendent John Davidson, curator of the Black Museum. It used many of the same selected cases as &quot;The Black Museum&quot;, and it nearly mirrored its broadcast run. The two shows were different in the respect that, while &quot;Whitehall 1212&quot; told the story of a case entirely from the point of view of the police, starting from the crime scene, &quot;The Black Museum&quot; was more heavily dramatised and played out scenes of the actual murders and included scenes from the criminal&#x27;s point of view.

==Comparisons with source material==
*Two episodes, &quot;The Car Tyre&quot; and &quot;The Gas Receipt,&quot; were the same story with minor differences between the two. &quot;The Baby&#x27;s Jacket&quot; and &quot;The Spectacles,&quot; were also based on the same case, as were &quot;The Tan Shoe&quot; and &quot;The Leather Bag.&quot;
*Four famous murder cases were dramatised on &quot;The Black Museum&quot;: John George Haigh, the &quot;Acid Bath Murderer&quot;; George Joseph Smith, the &quot;Brides in the Bath Murderer&quot;; Adelaide Bartlett, whose husband died from chloroform poisoning; and Florence Maybrick, who allegedly used arsenic from fly-paper to murder her husband James Maybrick.
*In &quot;The Open End Wrench&quot; it&#x27;s mistakenly stated that the culprit was executed in Dartmoor. No twentieth-century executions were carried out in Dartmoor. Built during the Napoleonic Wars to contain French and American POWs, it was, after lying idle from 1815 to 1850, later commissioned as a convict prison and used for dangerous long-term prisoners only.
*The dramatised story of &quot;The Hammerhead&quot; was changed to make the victim&#x27;s sister the murderer instead of the boy friend.
*The episode &quot;Small White Boxes&quot; is the only story in which the real names were used rather than pseudonyms.

<doc id="598713" wikidata="Q448727" url="?curid=598713" title="Margot Adler">
<text>Margot Susanna Adler (April 16, 1946 – July 28, 2014) was an American author, journalist, and lecturer. She worked as a correspondent for National Public Radio for 35 years, became bureau chief of the New York office, and could be heard frequently on nationally syndicated All Things Considered and Morning Edition on National Public Radio (NPR). A Wiccan high priestess, Adler wrote &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot;, a seminal work on neopaganism in America.

== Early life ==
Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, she was the only child of Dr. Kurt Adler, and the only grandchild of renowned psychologist Alfred Adler, a contemporary and associate of Sigmund Freud’s and Carl Jung’s in Vienna before the Second World War. She was also the only child of her mother Freyda Nacque Adler (née Pasternack) who was the daughter of uneducated immigrants, both of whom were dead by the time Margot was born. Freyda was charismatic--Margot likened her to Auntie Mame, beautiful, and a renowned political activist, and beloved mother to Margot. Both parents were Jewish although neither practiced the religion nor observed its religious holidays.

In her autobiographical account of growing up in the 1960s, &quot;Heretic&#x27;s Heart&quot;, she branded herself, “an alien in America.” Her paternal grandfather had been a personal friend of Leon Trotsky’s. Trotsky was ruthlessly hunted and ultimately assassinated by Stalin and his henchmen. Her grandfather had brought his family to the United States to avoid persecution by Stalinist, anti-Trotsky factions in Austria. But he was unable to save his oldest daughter, Valentine, who was imprisoned in Russia. Albert Einstein, a friend of the family interceded on the Alders’ behalf and learned that Valentine and her husband had died in a gulag in 1942.

Margot describes herself as “raised by left-wing parents,” a red diaper baby, in the height of the McCarthy era. Her father, like her grandfather, was a psychiatrist, who remained a cipher to Margot. He devoted his life’s work to analyzing his father’s theories of human psychology and drawing parallels to those of Karl Marx’s theories of economic socialism, although this work remained incomplete at the time of his death. Margot wrote, “The only thing that was beaten in my head was the Adlerian notion of ‘social interest,’ which, while never clearly defined in my youth, seemed to have something to do with being cooperative and merging your individual desires with the needs of society—rather like socialism”.

Margot grew up in Manhattan where she attended the liberal City and Country School in Greenwich Village, “my utopia, and the place that remained whole and intact and vibrant, even when my own family fell apart” . It was here that she fell in love with the stories of the gods and goddesses of myth that were later foundational in her decision to become a Wiccan priestess. There she also discovered her love of singing and performance which would influence her to go to the High School of Music &amp; Art (later joined with the High School of Performing Arts to become the LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and the Performing Arts) in New York City.

It was her mother Freyda to whom she was closest and with whom she lived after her parents’ divorce. Her mother retained the family apartment on Manhattan’s West Side overlooking Central Park, which Margot inherited when it was still a rent-controlled apartment and which she and her husband subsequently purchased when the units became condominiums. Margot referred to the apartment as her bit of heaven on earth, high up on the western edge of Central Park with a view of the city. It came with all of the family mementos stored there since Margot’s childhood, including the letters that formed the basis of &quot;Heretic’s Heart&quot;.

== Education ==
Adler received a Bachelor of Arts in political science from the University of California, Berkeley and a master&#x27;s degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York in 1970. She was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1982.

The focus of &quot;Heretic’s Heart&quot; was Margot’s experiences in the 60s. She was a freshman at Berkeley when the Free Speech Movement (FSM) erupted there in 1965 in response to the University of California’s crackdown on student and faculty rights to meet and organize on political issues, specifically to enlist students as workers in the Civil Rights Movement in the South. Campus protests and finally a sit-in at Sproul Hall, the Berkeley Administration Building, resulted in the largest mass arrest of students for political protests in the nation’s history. Following in her mother’s footsteps, Margot did not shy away from political activism. She embraced it, drawn to issues, feeling matters deeply to the point where she willingly went to jail for 90 days for her protests in FSM when she might have escaped her punishment. It was at this time that Margot began working as a volunteer journalist reporting on FSM for Pacifica Radio, KPFA, in Berkeley.

In 1965, the summer of her freshman year, she went to Mississippi to volunteer with the Democratic Freedom Party to register African Americans to vote. This was not a positive experience on many levels. There was discord between the volunteers and regular staff workers; little success in registering many voters; and finally, she found herself stranded with other volunteers on a lonesome country road where they were forced at gunpoint to abandon the one African American volunteer who was with them and who ultimately walked back to safety on his own. The experience left Margot shaken and she decided to return home to New York. She stopped &quot;en route&quot; in Little Rock, (where she had been born while her father was stationed there during the Second World War) to visit a family friend who lived in an all-white neighborhood and who shared with Margot her regret at the recent school desegregation in that city. This served to further underscore Margot’s sense of alienation in her own country.

At the core of &quot;Heretic&#x27;s Heart&quot; is the correspondence between Margot and a GI in Vietnam that took place while she was a student at Berkeley. They wrote 200 pages of letters between the spring of 1967 to later that year when they finally met after he returned in October from a war he didn’t support but had had to fight to survive. He and Margot finally rendezvoused in San Francisco and spent several days together. However, the love affair did not last, and there is no record that they stayed in touch afterward although it came closest to the romantic obsessions spinning in her mind. 

After graduating from Berkeley Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in political science, she chose to pursue a career in journalism and was accepted into the Master’s Program at Columbia University. But being part of the establishment did not end her political activism. She and a friend, as part of their studies, joined the Venceremos Brigade harvesting sugar in Cuba to support the Cuban revolution and to counter the crippling impact of the USA&#x27;s economic embargo against the country. Her stay ended when she was called back to her mother’s bedside in the final days of her battle with lung cancer. She died in 1970 at the age of 61.

== Journalism and radio ==
In 1971 Margot went to Washington, D.C. during the Nixon years to serve as bureau chief for Pacifica radio. These were difficult times for her. She struggled with her weight and body issues and felt “I was way over my head in the strange land of Richard Nixon’s Washington. On the outside I tried to look reasonably ‘straight’ and presentable; I spoke softly and politely. On the inside I was raging.”
After returning to New York City, she worked at its sister station, WBAI-FM, where, in 1972, she created the talk show &quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot; (still on the air as hosted by Jim Freund), and later another talk show, called &quot;Unstuck in Time&quot;.

Adler joined NPR in 1979 as a general assignment reporter, after spending a year as an NPR freelance reporter covering New York City, and subsequently worked on a great many pieces dealing with subjects as diverse as the death penalty, the right to die movement, the response to the war in Kosovo, computer gaming, the drug ecstasy, geek culture, children and technology and Pokémon. After 9/11, she focused much of her work on stories exploring the human factors in New York City, from the loss of loved ones, homes and jobs, to work in the relief effort. She was the host of &quot;Justice Talking&quot; up until the show ceased production on July 3, 2008. She was a regular voice on &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;. She was also co-producer of an award-winning radio drama, &quot;War Day&quot;.

== Neopaganism ==
Adler wrote &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot;, a 1979 book about Neopaganism which was revised in 2006. The book is considered by some a watershed in American Neopagan circles, as it provided the first comprehensive look at modern nature-based religions in the US. For many years it was the only introductory work about American Neopagan communities. She was also drawn to paganism as the spiritual side of her feminism which rejected the hierarchy of monotheism. She agreed with the historian James Breasted&#x27;s characterization of monotheism as “imperialism in religion.”

Her second book, &quot;Heretic&#x27;s Heart: A Journey Through Spirit and Revolution&quot;, was published by Beacon Press in 1997. Adler was a Wiccan priestess, an elder in the Covenant of the Goddess, and she also participated in the Unitarian Universalist faith community.

== Personal life ==
Margot’s partner in life was John Gliedman whom she married in June 1988 when she was 42. Like Margot, he was the child of a psychiatrist, well-educated with a doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They held a commitment ceremony in 1976. They were married in a pagan ritual that took place on Martha’s Vineyard where Margot had loved family vacations with her parents as a child. “Their wedding was the first Pagan handfasting to be written up in the society pages of The New York Times.” Margot and John had one child, a son born in 1990.

== Death ==
In early 2011, Adler was diagnosed with endometrial cancer, which metastasized over the following three years. Adler died on July 28, 2014, at the age of 68.

<doc id="598714" wikidata="Q252321" url="?curid=598714" title="Pharyngeal consonant">
<text>A pharyngeal consonant is a consonant that is articulated primarily in the pharynx. Some phoneticians distinguish upper pharyngeal consonants, or &quot;high&quot; pharyngeals, pronounced by retracting the root of the tongue in the mid to upper pharynx, from (ary)epiglottal consonants, or &quot;low&quot; pharyngeals, which are articulated with the aryepiglottic folds against the epiglottis at the entrance of the larynx, as well as from epiglotto-pharyngeal consonants, with both movements being combined.

Stops and trills can be reliably produced only at the epiglottis, and fricatives can be reliably produced only in the upper pharynx. When they are treated as distinct places of articulation, the term &quot;radical consonant&quot; may be used as a cover term, or the term &quot;guttural consonants&quot; may be used instead. 

Pharyngeal consonants can trigger effects on neighboring vowels. Instead of uvulars, which nearly always trigger retraction, pharyngeals tend to trigger lowering. For example, in Moroccan Arabic, pharyngeals tend to lower neighboring vowels (corresponding to the formant 1). Meanwhile, in Chechen, it causes lowering as well, in addition to centralization and lengthening of the segment /a/.

In addition, consonants and vowels may be secondarily pharyngealized. Also, strident vowels are defined by an accompanying epiglottal trill.

==Pharyngeal consonants in the IPA==
Pharyngeal/epiglottal consonants in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA):

:*A voiced epiglottal stop may not be possible. When an epiglottal stop becomes voiced intervocalically in Dahalo, for example, it becomes a tap. Phonetically, however, both voiceless and voiced affricates and off-glides are attested: (Esling 2010: 695).
:** Although traditionally placed in the fricative row of the IPA chart, is usually an approximant. Frication is difficult to produce or to distinguish because the voicing in the glottis and the constriction in the pharynx are so close to each other (Esling 2010: 695, after Laufer 1996). The IPA symbol is ambiguous, but no language distinguishes fricative and approximant at this place of articulation. For clarity, the lowering diacritic may used to specify that the manner is approximant () and a raising diacritic to specify that the manner is fricative ().

The Hydaburg dialect of Haida has a trilled epiglottal and a trilled epiglottal affricate ~. (There is some voicing in all Haida affricates, but it is analyzed as an effect of the vowel.)

For transcribing disordered speech, the extIPA provides symbols for upper-pharyngeal stops, ⟨⟩ and ⟨⟩.

==Place of articulation==
The IPA first distinguished epiglottal consonants in 1989, with a contrast between pharyngeal and epiglottal fricatives, but advances in laryngoscopy since then have caused specialists to re-evaluate their position. Since a trill can be made only in the pharynx with the aryepiglottic folds (in the pharyngeal trill of the northern dialect of Haida, for example), and incomplete constriction at the epiglottis, as would be required to produce epiglottal fricatives, generally results in trilling, there is no contrast between (upper) pharyngeal and epiglottal based solely on place of articulation. Esling (2010) thus restores a unitary pharyngeal place of articulation, with the consonants being described by the IPA as epiglottal fricatives differing from pharyngeal fricatives in their manner of articulation rather than in their place: 

Edmondson et al. distinguish several subtypes of pharyngeal consonant. Pharyngeal or epiglottal stops and trills are usually produced by contracting the aryepiglottic folds of the larynx against the epiglottis. That articulation has been distinguished as &quot;aryepiglottal&quot;. In pharyngeal fricatives, the root of the tongue is retracted against the back wall of the pharynx. In a few languages, such as Achumawi, Amis of Taiwan and perhaps some of the Salishan languages, the two movements are combined, with the aryepiglottic folds and epiglottis brought together and retracted against the pharyngeal wall, an articulation that has been termed &quot;epiglotto-pharyngeal&quot;. The IPA does not have diacritics to distinguish this articulation from standard aryepiglottals; Edmondson et al. use the &quot;ad hoc&quot;, somewhat misleading, transcriptions and . There are, however, several diacritics for subtypes of pharyngeal sound among the Voice Quality Symbols.

Although upper-pharyngeal plosives are not found in the world&#x27;s languages, apart from the rear closure of some click consonants, they occur in disordered speech. See voiceless upper-pharyngeal plosive and voiced upper-pharyngeal plosive.

==Distribution==
Pharyngeals are known primarily from three areas of the world: 
#the Middle East, North Africa and the Horn of Africa, in the Semitic, Berber (mostly in borrowings from Arabic) and Cushitic branches of the Afroasiatic language family 
#the Caucasus, in the Northwest, and Northeast Caucasian language families 
#British Columbia, in the Northern Haida dialects, in the Interior Salish branch of the Salishan language family, and in the southern branch of the Wakashan language family.

There are scattered reports of pharyngeals elsewhere, as in:

The fricatives and trills (the pharyngeal and epiglottal fricatives) are frequently conflated with pharyngeal fricatives in literature. That was the case for Dahalo and Northern Haida, for example, and it is likely to be true for many other languages. The distinction between these sounds was recognized by IPA only in 1989, and it was little investigated until the 1990s.

<doc id="598715" wikidata="Q16970503" url="?curid=598715" title="The Adventures of Harry Lime">
<text>The Adventures of Harry Lime (broadcast in the United States as The Lives of Harry Lime) is an old-time radio programme produced in the United Kingdom during the 1951 to 1952 season. Orson Welles reprises his role of Harry Lime from the celebrated 1949 film &quot;The Third Man&quot;. The radio series is a prequel to the film, and depicts the many misadventures of con-artist Lime in a somewhat lighter tone than that of the film.

==Production==
&quot;The Adventures of Harry Lime&quot; is one of the most successful series created by prolific British radio producer Harry Alan Towers and his company Towers of London. Towers and Graham Greene, author of &quot;The Third Man&quot;, had the same literary agent, and Towers learned that Greene had not sold the rights to the character of Harry Lime to Alexander Korda when he sold Korda &quot;The Third Man&quot;. Towers quickly bought the rights to the character and in 1951 he put a syndicated radio series into production. Orson Welles reprised the role of Harry Lime in a series of adventures that preceded the story told in &quot;The Third Man&quot;.

Several episodes would begin with &quot;The Third Man Theme&quot; being played, abruptly cut off by an echoing gunshot. Then Welles would speak: &quot;That was the shot that killed Harry Lime. He died in a sewer beneath Vienna, as those of you know who saw the movie &quot;The Third Man&quot;. Yes, that was the end of Harry Lime ... but it was not the beginning. Harry Lime had many lives ... and I can recount all of them. How do I know? Very simple. Because my name is Harry Lime.&quot;

Although often cited as a BBC production, the series was one of a number produced and distributed independently by Towers of London and syndicated internationally.

==Episodes==
Only sixteen of the episodes were acquired and broadcast by the BBC in the UK. It was the first time that the BBC broadcast episodes of a dramatic series that it did not produce. The full series was syndicated to radio stations in the U.S. 


The con orchestrated by Welles&#x27; character in the episode &quot;Horse Play&quot; closely resembles that of the 1973 Robert Redford and Paul Newman film &quot;The Sting.&quot; Both are based on the book &quot;The Big Con&quot; written by David W. Maurer which was published in 1940. 

The episode &quot;Man of Mystery&quot;, written by Welles, was later expanded by him and served as the basic plot for his film &quot;Mr. Arkadin&quot;.

A recording of the 1951 &quot;A Ticket to Tangiers&quot; episode of &quot;The Lives of Harry Lime&quot; series is available on the Criterion Collection DVD edition of &quot;The Third Man&quot;. In addition, recordings of the 1952 episodes &quot;Man of Mystery&quot;, &quot;Murder on the Riviera&quot; and &quot;Blackmail is a Nasty Word&quot; are included on the Criterion Collection DVD &quot;The Complete Mr. Arkadin&quot;.

==Novelisation==
===&quot;The Lives of Harry Lime&quot;===
Fifteen episodes were adapted into a short story collection, &quot;The Lives of Harry Lime&quot;, published in the United Kingdom by Pocket Books in 1952. The book was credited to &quot;Orson Welles and others&quot;, and Welles had been credited with writing the scripts of several episodes, but it is unclear whether or not he wrote the adaptations. 

Additionally, Harry Alan Towers has cast doubt on whether Welles even wrote the episodes he was credited with. He describes how the series started being written by a team of experienced American radio scriptwriters. When Welles discovered they were being paid $1,000 per script, he offered to write 6 scripts himself. The scripts were delivered and Towers duly paid Welles $6,000. Then one day, a man walked into Towers&#x27; office, demanding to be paid for the scripts which &quot;he&quot; had ghostwritten for Welles. When Welles was asked about it later, he smiled: &quot;Don&#x27;t pay him. They weren&#x27;t very good scripts.&quot;

The episodes which were adapted into short stories were:

#&quot;It&#x27;s in the Bag&quot; by Orson Welles (Episode 30)
#&quot;The Golden Fleece&quot; by Orson Welles (Episode 11)
#&quot;Art is Long and Lime is Fleeting&quot; by Sigmund Miller (Episode 15)
#&quot;Love Affair&quot; by Sigmund Miller (Episode 7)
#&quot;See Naples and Live&quot; by Sigmund Miller (Episode 2)
#&quot;Every Frame Has a Silver Lining&quot; by Robert Cenedella (Episode 13)
#&quot;Paris is Not the Same&quot; by Joseph Cochran (Episode 49)
#&quot;Five Thousand Pengoes and a Kiss&quot; by Carl Jampel (Episode 26)
#&quot;The Hand of Glory&quot; by Jonquil Anthony (Episode 24)
#&quot;The Hyacinth Patrol&quot; by Virginia Cooke (Episode 31)
#&quot;Horseplay&quot; by Peter Lyon (Episode 17)
#&quot;Work of Art&quot; by Bud Lesser (Episode 9)
#&quot;Rogue&#x27;s Holiday&quot; by Peter Lyon (Episode 8)
#&quot;A Ticket to Tangier&quot; [sic] by Orson Welles (Episode 4)
#&quot;An Old Moorish Custom&quot; by Irvan Ashkinazy (Episode 20)

===&quot;Une Grosse Légume&quot;===
Welles also tried to convert one episode script into a film script for producer Alexander Korda. When that fell through, the story was adapted into a novel and published in France as &quot;Une Grosse Légume&quot; in 1953. The novel was ghostwritten by Maurice Bessy and published under Welles&#x27;s name. It has never been published in English.

<doc id="598719" wikidata="Q7033216" url="?curid=598719" title="Night Beat (radio program)">
<text>Night Beat, sometimes spelled Nightbeat, is an NBC radio drama series that aired February 6, 1950 – September 25, 1952, sponsored by Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer and Wheaties.

== Description ==

Frank Lovejoy starred as Randy Stone, a reporter who covered the night beat for the &quot;Chicago Star&quot;, encountering criminals, eccentrics, and troubled souls. Listeners were invited to join Stone as he &quot;searches through the city for the strange stories waiting for him in the darkness.&quot; Most episodes leaned towards suspense, crime and thriller themes, but &quot;Night Beat&quot; also featured occasional humorous or sentimental stories. Each episode ended with Stone at his desk as he finished typing a news story based on his latest exploits, and shouting for the copy boy to deliver his story to an editor.

Radio historian John Dunning described &quot;Nightbeat&quot; as a &quot;superior series&quot;, carried by vivid writing and Lovejoy&#x27;s sympathetic performance.

&quot;Ripperologist&quot; editor Paul Begg offered this description of the series:
Supporting actors included Joan Banks, Parley Baer, William Conrad, Jeff Corey, Lawrence Dobkin, Paul Frees, Jack Kruschen, Peter Leeds, Howard McNear, Lurene Tuttle, Martha Wentworth, and Ben Wright. The announcer was Donald Rickles.

== Other media ==

=== Television ===
The format was recreated, with Lovejoy as Stone, on an episode of the television anthology series, &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot; (&quot;Search in the Night&quot; 5 November 1953). This episode was a television pilot produced by Four Star Productions for a proposed, but ultimately unproduced, weekly television series.

=== Prose ===
In December 2012, Old Time Radio distributor Radio Archives published &quot;Nightbeat: Night Stories&quot;, an ebook anthology of six new &quot;Nightbeat&quot; stories. Authors included were Howard Hopkins, Paul Bishop, Will Murray, Tommy Hancock (who also served as editor), Mark Squirek, and Bobby Nash. Each story used the traditional radio opening and closing, as well as Stone&#x27;s first-person narration. Several characters from the radio series appear, and Hancock&#x27;s entry – &quot;Lucky&quot; – attempts to explain who &quot;Lucky&quot; Stone from the original pilot really is.

&quot;Nightbeat: Night Stories&quot; was also released as an audiobook, read by Michael C. Gwynne.

<text>Legislative elections were held in South Korea on 15 April 2004. In the 17th election for the National Assembly, voters elected 299 members of the legislature. The newly formed Uri Party and other parties supporting President Roh Moo-hyun, who was impeached by the outgoing National Assembly, won a majority of seats. This was the first time a centre-left liberal party won a majority in the National Assembly.

== Electoral system ==

The election was held under parallel voting, with 243 members elected in single-member constituencies via first-past-the-post voting and the remainder elected via proportional representation. Proportional seats were only available to parties which one three percent of the national valid vote among seat-allocated parties and/or won five or more constituency seats.

==Political parties==
The newly formed liberal Uri Party (&quot;Uri-dang&quot; or &quot;Our Party&quot;) gained support through its opposition to the impeachment of President Roh. It won 32 out of 49 seats in Seoul, 44 out of 62 in Incheon and Gyeonggi, confirming that a majority of voters supported the President Roh.

The conservative Grand National Party, which supported the impeachment of President Roh, suffered a loss of support, but won a majority in North Gyeongsang and South Gyeongsang regions and retained the 100 seats necessary to block constitutional changes.

The progressive, socialist Democratic Labor Party got 13.03% of vote share, but won only 10 out of 299 seats due to the FPTP system. However this was considered as a great triumph within political landscape of South Korea which is traditionally anti-communist and against left-wing policies. DLP also won two FPTP seats in Ulsan and Changwon based on labor movement.

The Millennium Democratic Party, formerly the major liberal party, was the second-largest party prior to the election but sustained the biggest loss in the backlash following its leading role in the impeachment of Roh, as much of its support shifted to the Uri Party.

The United Liberal Democrats, a conservative regional party based on North Chungcheong and South Chungcheong regions, lost support since its leader, Kim Jong-pil, did not contest the last presidential election.

<doc id="598723" wikidata="Q7764561" url="?curid=598723" title="The Six Shooter">
<text>The Six Shooter is a United States Western old-time radio program starring James Stewart as a gunfighter. It was created by Frank Burt, who also wrote many of the episodes, and lasted only one season of 39 episodes on NBC (Sept. 20, 1953–June 24, 1954). Initially, it was broadcast on Sundays at 9:30 pm Eastern Time, through October 11. Then it was heard at 8:30 pm for three weeks. Finally, on November 8, 1953, through March 21, 1954, it was broadcast Sundays at 8 pm; beginning April 1, 1954, through the final episode, it was on Thursdays at 8:30 pm. One old-time radio directory called the program &quot;a last, desperate effort by a radio network (NBC) to maintain interest in adventure drama by employing a major Hollywood movie star in the leading role.&quot; 
Stewart starred as Britt Ponset, a drifting cowboy in the final years of the wild west. Episodes ranged from straight Western drama to whimsical comedy. A trademark of the show was Stewart&#x27;s use of whispered narration during tense scenes that created a heightened sense of drama, and relief when the situation was resolved.

Some of the more prominent actors to perform on the program included Parley Baer, Virginia Gregg, Harry Bartell, Howard McNear, Jeanette Nolan, Dan O&#x27;Herlihy, Alan Reed, Marvin Miller, and William Conrad (often credited as &quot;Julius Krelboyne&quot; because he was also the star of CBS&#x27;s radio show &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, playing Marshall Matt Dillon at the time). Some did multiple episodes playing different characters.

Each episode opened with the announcer (Hal Gibney; John Wald in later episodes) stating: &quot;The man in the saddle is angular and long-legged. His skin is sun-dyed brown. The gun in his holster is gray steel and rainbow mother-of-pearl, its handle unmarked. People call them both &#x27;the Six Shooter&#x27;.&quot;

The haunting theme music was &quot;Highland Lament&quot;, arranged by series composer Basil Adlam and written by British film composer Charles Williams. Jack Johnstone was the producer-director for NBC Radio, in association with Revue Productions.

The final episode, &quot;Myra Barker&quot;, provided a satisfying (if melancholy) finale to the series. Ponset falls in love with Myra, and proposes marriage. Myra, after thinking it over, appears to accept, but then tells Britt she has heard that Sheriff Jennings of Eagle Falls has asked for his help, and Britt admits that he feels obligated to go. Myra tells Britt to go and not come back, telling him some adventure will always call him, and he will always go, or regret not going. Britt goes, resuming his wanderings, but not before revealing to the audience that he knows he was *not* needed in Eagle Falls, and knows Myra knows that, too. The moment comes across as a moment of supreme self-realization by Britt that he always will be a wanderer.

==Adaptation==
James Stewart filmed a television pilot episode titled &quot;The Windmill&quot; featuring Barbara Hale, John McIntire, and Edgar Buchanan, but it somehow failed to sell. A perfect copy of the episode exists, however. The program was later successfully adapted for television in 1957 with John Payne as the star; by that time, Stewart&#x27;s career had completely recovered from his initial postwar slump, and he was no longer available. An article in a trade publication reported that 39 &quot;half-hour tv films&quot; would be produced &quot;for a series titled &quot;The Six Shooter&quot;.&quot; Frank Burt was the consultant for all episodes of the adaptation. The pilot episode, titled &quot;The Restless Gun&quot;, aired on 29 March 1957 as an episode of the anthology series &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot;. John Payne, who went on to star in the series, played the lead character, Britt Ponsett. By the time the series, also called &quot;The Restless Gun&quot;, debuted the following fall, though, the main character&#x27;s name had been changed to Vint Bonner, &quot;a slightly altered rendition of Britt Ponset&quot;.

==Trivia==
* An episode of the anthology &quot;Hollywood Star Playhouse&quot; on NBC entitled &quot;The Six Shooter&quot;, was broadcast April 13, 1952. This used the &quot;Ben Scofield&quot; script, which was also used for the audition episode and (with a slightly different opening) the seventh episode of the series. 
* The unaired audition episode, recorded July 15, 1953, includes a personal message by James Stewart in the middle and end trying to sell the program to potential sponsors.
* Stewart revived the Ponset character for the Feb. 10, 1957, episode of the television anthology program &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; titled &quot;The Town with a Past&quot;. The script was based on the &quot;Silver Annie&quot; episode of the radio show. Stewart, however, declined to appear on a weekly TV version, and the proposed series was offered to John Payne.
* The Dec. 15, 1957, episode of &quot;G.E. Theater&quot;, &quot;The Trail to Christmas&quot;, was based on the radio episode &quot;Britt Ponset&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, although in this instance, Stewart&#x27;s character was renamed Bart, and the Dec. 15, 1959, episode of the television anthology program &quot;Startime&quot;, &quot;Cindy&#x27;s Fella&quot;, was based on the radio episode &quot;When the Shoe Doesn&#x27;t Fit&quot;. Stewart took the role of peddler Azel Dorsey, while George Gobel played an unnamed drifter in place of Ponset.
* Ponset&#x27;s horse was named Scar.
*Although Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co. was interested in underwriting the program, James Stewart refused to accept, believing that it did not coincide with his public image. Jack Johnstone was quoted as saying, &quot;Chesterfield begged and begged and begged for months trying to get sponsorship, but Jim didn’t feel that, because of his screen image, it would be fair for him to be sponsored by a cigarette&quot;. Coleman eventually bought commercial time during the first four episodes, but no other advertisers sustained the series after that.

<doc id="598727" wikidata="Q756766" url="?curid=598727" title="1995 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1995 Atlantic hurricane season was a very active Atlantic hurricane season, and is considered to be the start of an ongoing era of high-activity tropical cyclone formation. The season produced twenty-one tropical cyclones, nineteen named storms, as well as eleven hurricanes and five major hurricanes. The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The first tropical cyclone, Hurricane Allison, developed on June 2, while the season&#x27;s final storm, Hurricane Tanya, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 1. The very active Atlantic hurricane activity in 1995 was caused by La Niña conditions, which also influenced an inactive Pacific hurricane season. It was tied with 1887 Atlantic hurricane season with 19 named storms, which was later equalled by the 2010, 2011, and 2012 seasons.

There were four particularly destructive hurricanes during the season, including Luis, Marilyn, Opal and Roxanne. Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn both caused catastrophic damage in the Leeward Islands and Virgin Islands. The former storm was the first hurricane to affect the islands since Hugo in 1989, while the latter was the most devastating cyclone on the Virgin Islands since Hugo as well. Opal, the strongest and most intense storm of the season, caused devastation along portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States. Roxanne, a rare late-season major hurricane, caused significant damage when it made landfall in Quintana Roo. All four aforementioned names were retired following the season. Additionally, Erin produced moderate damage in Florida and into Alabama. Felix generated strong waves, causing heavy beach erosion in the Northeastern United States and drowning nine people. Iris caused flooding that left five deaths in the Lesser Antilles. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the season caused about $12.74 billion (1995 USD) in damage and at least 182 deaths.

== Seasonal forecasts ==
=== Pre-season forecasts ===

Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has 12.1 named storms; of these, 6.4 reach hurricane strength; and 2.7 major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Additionally, the 1950–2000 CSU average for a normal season is 9.6 named storms, of these 5.9 reach hurricane strength, and 2.3 become major hurricanes.

In December 1994, CSU predicted that only 12 named storms would form and 8 of those would become hurricanes; 3 major hurricanes were projected. CSU noted an above average season due to expectations that the existing El Niño would dissipate, while a La Niña would develop by the summer of 1995. Additionally, the western areas of the Sahara Desert were predicted to have the fourth or fifth rainiest season since 1970. A year with heavier precipitation in this region usually correlates with an active Atlantic hurricane season. In April 1995, CSU revised their forecast, decreasing the number of named storms to 10, hurricanes to 6, and major hurricanes to 2. However, in June, CSU reverted to their December forecast, which called for 12 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. The forecast by the WRC in early 1995 was 10 named storms and 6 hurricanes, with no prediction on the number of major hurricanes.

== Seasonal summary ==


The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, and activity in 1995 began on the next day with the formation of Hurricane Allison on June 2. It was a well-above average season in which 21 tropical depressions formed, 19 of which attained tropical storm status, and 11 of these attained hurricane status. In addition, five tropical cyclones reached major hurricane status, which was well above the 1950–2005 average of two per season. At the time, only 1933 surpassed the season&#x27;s total storms, making the season the second most active in recorded history tying with 1887. The 1995 season would be the beginning of an active period in the Atlantic basin, which has lasted for nearly 30 years. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of this season caused 182 deaths and $12.02 billion in damage. The last storm of the season, Hurricane Tanya, became extratropical on November 1, over four weeks before the official end of the season on November 30.

Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season began with the development of Hurricane Allison on June 2. The month of July was very active, with four tropical cyclones forming. This record of storms in July stood until the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season when five storms formed in July. A total of seven storms formed in August — Felix, Gabrielle, Humberto, Iris, Jerry, Karen, and Luis — tying the 1933 record for most in the month; this record was broken in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season when eight named storms formed during August. Although September is the climatological peak of hurricane season, it was much less active than August. Four tropical cyclones developed in September, with Marilyn, Noel, and Opal eventually strengthening into hurricanes. Four tropical cyclones also formed in October; notably, Hurricane Roxanne developed in that month. The last storm of the season, Hurricane Tanya, developed later in October and eventually became extratropical on November 1. This was the first time since forecasters began assigning given names to tropical storms in 1953 that names starting with the letters &quot;O&quot; through &quot;T&quot; were used.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a very high accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 228, the fifth highest value on record, and far above the 1981–2010 median of 92. Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration or stronger intensity, such as Felix, Luis, Opal, or Roxanne will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of . Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included here. After the storm has dissipated, typically after the end of the season, the NHC reexamines the data, and produces a final report on each storm. These revisions can lead to a revised ACE total either upward or downward compared to the operational value.
== Systems ==
=== Hurricane Allison ===
A westward moving tropical wave reached the Caribbean Sea in late May and gradually organized over the next few days. Around 00:00 UTC on June 3, a tropical depression developed about east of Belize City, Belize. The depression initially moved northwestward before recurving to the north. The depression entered the Gulf of Mexico and strengthened into Tropical Storm Allison by 12:00 UTC. Despite unfavorable upper-level winds, the storm intensified into a hurricane about 24 hours later. Allison then peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Increasing wind shear weakened it to a tropical storm early on June 5. At 14:00 UTC, Allison made landfall near Alligator Point, Florida, with winds of . After briefly emerging over Apalachee Bay, Allison struck near St. Marks with winds of . Early on June 6, Allison weakened to a tropical depression, shortly before becoming extratropical. The remnants continued northeastward and later struck Newfoundland before dissipating near Greenland on June 11.

While brushing Cuba, Allison produced wind gusts up to and as much as of rainfall. A total of 32 structures were damaged or destroyed, causing one death. In Florida, storm surge heights of were observed in Dixie and Wakulla counties and to the east, causing significant beach erosion and damaging 65 homes, 3 hotels, and a restaurant. Elsewhere in Florida, damage was generally minor, totaling only about $860,000. In Georgia, there was minor flooding and tornadoes, one of which caused $800,000 in damage in St. Marys. Some locations in Atlantic Canada reported tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall.
=== Tropical Storm Barry ===

A frontal low situated between Bermuda and South Carolina developed into Tropical Depression Two late on July 6. Strong wind shear initially prevented significant strengthening, though by early on July 7, the depression became Tropical Storm Barry. A nearby trough enhanced convection and caused strengthening, with maximum sustained winds reaching later that day. Later on July 8, Barry weakened slightly, falling to winds of , an intensity it would retain until landfall. An approaching mid-level trough accelerated the storm as it traveled roughly along the Gulf Stream. Early on July 9, convection began to shift away from the storm&#x27;s center. While moving rapidly northeastward, Barry made landfall in Hart Island, Nova Scotia, late on July 9.

It weakened slightly and made landfall on Cape Breton Island less than an hour later. Cold water caused deep convection to diminish as it was making landfall, and the storm lost most remaining tropical characteristics as it tracked toward Newfoundland. Barry was declared extratropical early on July 10 near the west coast of Newfoundland. As a fast-moving and weakening extratropical cyclone, the system remained distinct until it passed across the east coast of Labrador, when it dissipated. Tropical storm force winds were recorded at Fourchu, Nova Scotia, as well as wind gusts up to at Port aux Basques, Newfoundland. Barry dropped significant rainfall, peaking at in Nova Scotia, with lesser totals at several other locations.
=== Tropical Storm Chantal ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July 5. During the next week, the wave improved on satellite imagery and developed into a tropical depression about east-northeast of Guadeloupe on July 12. The depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Chantal. Initially, Chantal threatened the Bahamas, and the Government of the Bahamas issued tropical storm watches and warnings, which were in effect for the southeast and central islands as well as the Turks and Caicos Islands. However, Chantal re-curved to the north and did not directly affect the Bahamas. After the cyclone turned northward, it threatened Bermuda, which prompted a tropical storm watch for the island on July 16. The watch was canceled on July 18 as the storm passed well northwest of the island.

By early on July 17, Chantal attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Thereafter, the storm began weakening and slowly losing tropical characteristics. At 18:00 UTC on July 20, Chantal transitioned into an extratropical storm about east-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The remnants continued rapidly northeastward and later east-northeastward, before dissipating west of the British Isles on July 22. Although Chantal remained well offshore, the storm dropped heavy rainfall in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, peaking at on the Burin Peninsula. Further west in Nova Scotia, heavier precipitation was reported, peaking at near Barrington.
=== Tropical Storm Dean ===
A stationary front in the Gulf of Mexico developed an upper-level circulation. By July 28, the system organized enough to be classified as Tropical Depression Four. Despite favorable conditions, the depression tracked westward without significantly intensifying, due to the poor organization of the storm itself. As the depression curved west-northwestward, it began to strengthen and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dean while located only from the Texas coastline on July 30. The system made landfall early on July 31 near Freeport with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Shortly thereafter, Dean weakened back to a tropical depression. The storm continued to slowly weaken as it moved northwestward, dissipating on August 2 near the Texas–Oklahoma border.

Storm surge caused minor coastal flooding, especially on Galveston Island. Dean produced a large swath of rainfall between , while some areas received more than . Precipitation from the storm caused moderate localized flood damage. A total of 20 families in Chambers County evacuated, while 38 houses in the southeastern portions of Texas were flooded. Two tornadoes were also reported in the state, but neither caused significant damage. In Oklahoma, heavy rainfall flooded more than 40 houses and left about 24 cars stranded. At least three highways suffered significant flooding, while other minor roads were closed for several days. Outside of Oklahoma and Texas, the remnants of the storm dropped rainfall in several Midwestern states, though minimal damage occurred. Despite the flooding, property damage estimates were only $500,000, while one fatality occurred.
=== Hurricane Erin ===
A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on July 22 and headed toward the Leeward Islands, where the system nearly developed into a tropical cyclone but was inhibited by vertical wind shear. By July 31, the system was classified as Tropical Storm Erin while just west of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Despite effects from wind shear, Erin continued to strengthen as it moved northwestward and was upgraded to a hurricane later on July 31. Further intensification occurred, and Erin reached winds of before making landfall near Vero Beach, Florida, on August 1. The storm emerged over the Gulf of Mexico after weakening back to a tropical storm, though it quickly re-strengthened into a hurricane. Shortly before making landfall near Pensacola Beach, Florida on August 3, Erin briefly intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. After moving inland, Erin slowly weakened as it tracked across the Southern United States and Midwestern United States. By August 6, Erin merged with a frontal system over West Virginia.

Erin was the first hurricane to strike the United States since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. In Jamaica, the outer bands of Erin produced heavy rainfall on the island, which caused a plane crash, killing five people; two other fatalities occurred when two people were struck by lightning. Although many islands in the Bahamas experienced high winds and heavy rainfall, damage associated with Erin was fairly minor. Offshore of Florida, nine people drowned, three of which occurred after a cruise ship sunk. Over land, high winds produced by Erin damaged over 2,000 houses, most of which were in the Florida Panhandle. In addition, strong winds left over one million people without electricity. Several tornadoes were spawned in the state, causing damage. In Alabama, more than 100 houses were damaged by Erin. Between 50 and 75 percent of the pecan crop in Baldwin County was lost. Similar impact also occurred in Mississippi, although to a lesser degree. Elsewhere, some areas of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States experienced heavy rainfall. Overall, Erin caused 13 fatalities and $700 million in damage.
=== Tropical Depression Six ===

The southern part of the tropical wave that spawned Hurricane Erin continued into the Caribbean Sea in late July. By August 4, the system entered the Bay of Campeche and developed into Tropical Depression Six on August 5. The depression moved slowly over Mexico and gradually intensified that day and August 6. Satellite intensity estimated showed the depression was likely just below the threshold of tropical storm status. However, late on August 6, the depression made landfall in Cabo Rojo, Veracruz. The depression slowly weakened inland and dissipated late on August 7. The depression and the precursor tropical wave dropped heavy rainfall in some areas of Mexico. Precipitation from the precursor system peaked at in Escuintla, Chiapas, while rainfall from the depression itself peaked at in Tlaxco, Puebla. Some localized flooding may have occurred near the path of the depression.
=== Hurricane Felix ===
A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on August 6 developed into Tropical Depression Seven on August 8 while located about west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. The depression moved west-northwestward due to a subtropical ridge and deepened into Tropical Storm Felix later that day. Further intensification was slower, with Felix reaching hurricane status on August 11. Due to warm sea surface temperatures and light wind shear, Felix began to rapidly strengthen as it was curving northwestward. Late on August 12, Felix peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Felix weakened over the next few days back to a Category 1 hurricane on August 14, after an eyewall replacement cycle and an increase in wind shear.

The storm posed a significant threat to Bermuda, warranting a hurricane warning between August 14 and August 15. During the latter date, Felix passed only to the southwest of the island. Continuing on its northwest trek, the cyclone also temporarily prompted preparations along the East Coast of the United States. However, the storm curved northward and then east-northeastward while remaining offshore. Felix briefly threatened Bermuda again, but turned back to the northeast and weakened to a tropical storm on August 20. It accelerated east-northeastward and passed a short distance offshore of Newfoundland, where it transitioned into an extratropical storm on August 22. The remnants of Felix continued northeastward across the Atlantic until dissipating near Shetland on August 25.

Large waves in Puerto Rico caused minor coastal flooding in Cataño. On Bermuda, the storm produced near-hurricane-force winds, which downed trees and power lines, and left 20,000 people without power. Rough surf was also reported on Bermuda, which damaged a few boats and hotels. In addition, the passage of Felix postponed Bermuda&#x27;s 1995 independence referendum. In the United States, Felix generated large waves from northeast Florida to Maine. In New York, two houses were washed away in The Hamptons, while 20 to 30 houses in North Carolina experienced minor damage from rough seas. While passing southeast of Newfoundland, Felix produced moderate rainfall and large waves across the island, although damage was minimal. Overall, Felix caused eight deaths due to drowning along the coasts of North Carolina and New Jersey, and $132,000 in damage.
=== Tropical Storm Gabrielle ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa in late July 1995 and entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 8. On the following day, the system developed a weak low-level circulation and was declared Tropical Depression Eight while in the western Gulf of Mexico. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Gabrielle on August 10. Gabrielle continued to rapidly strengthen as it tracked toward the coast of Mexico, nearly becoming a hurricane late on August 11. However, Gabrielle made landfall near La Pesca, Tamaulipas, Mexico two hours later, which prevented further strengthening. Gabrielle rapidly weakened inland and dissipated early on August 12.

Gabrielle dropped heavy rainfall in Mexico, where some areas possibly experienced more than of precipitation. However, according to the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), rainfall peaked at in southern Tamaulipas. Despite the large amounts of precipitation, it was considered beneficial due to drought conditions in some areas, especially in Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon. However, in other nearby areas, the heavy rainfall flooded streets and destroyed roadways and bridges. Further north, Gabrielle dropped light to moderate rainfall in Texas. Gabrielle caused six fatalities in Mexico, while the damage figure is unknown.
=== Hurricane Humberto ===

On August 19, a tropical wave crossed over Dakar, Senegal, shortly before entering into the Atlantic Ocean. The wave quickly organized once in the Atlantic and developed into Tropical Depression Nine on August 22. Due to low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Humberto six hours later. It continued west-northwestward and then westward under the influence of a mid-level trough. Early on August 23, Humberto intensified into a hurricane. By early on August 24 the storm developed a well-defined eye after becoming a Category 2 hurricane.

After peaking with winds of on August 24, Humberto began a fujiwhara interaction with Hurricane Iris. This generated shear on Humberto, causing the storm to weaken back to a Category 1 hurricane on August 26. Humberto continued to weaken until August 28, when it was barely a hurricane. Operationally, Humberto was erroneously downgraded to a tropical storm on that same day. Thereafter, the storm began restrengthening and reached a secondary peak slightly below the threshold for a Category 2 hurricane on August 30. While tracking northeastward, Humberto began weakening and acquiring extratropical characteristics starting on the following day. Later on August 31, Humberto weakened to a tropical storm. By 06:00 UTC on September 1, the storm was absorbed by an extratropical low while west of the Azores. Humberto was the second of four tropical waves in quick succession in the tropical Atlantic that all eventually became tropical storms or hurricanes; it was preceded by the wave that became Iris, and followed by the waves that became Karen and Luis. It was also the first of three tropical cyclones to form within a 24-hour period on August 21 and 22; Iris formed 12 hours later and Jerry formed 18 hours later. It was also the first of five named storms to form within a seven-day period; Karen formed on August 26 and Luis on August 28.
=== Hurricane Iris ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on August 16. It rapidly developed a closed circulation, though convection diminished a few days after the wave entered the Atlantic. However, convection began to re-develop and by 12:00 UTC on August 22, the system developed into Tropical Depression Ten. Six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Iris. Thereafter, Iris continued to intensify and became a hurricane later on August 23. After reaching winds of , the storm began to weaken during a Fujiwhara interaction with Hurricane Humberto, causing Iris to be downgraded to a tropical storm on August 24. Iris continued to steadily weaken as it approached the Lesser Antilles. After making a direct hit on Saint Lucia and Martinique on August 26, steering currents produced by a trough forced Iris north-northwestward; this caused it to brush Dominica and Guadeloupe and make landfall in Antigua and Barbuda on August 27. Around the time, Iris began restrengthening due to a decrease in wind shear and became a hurricane again on August 28.

It is possible that the forward motion of the storm became slightly erratic after a Fujiwhara interaction began with Tropical Storm Karen. By September 1, Iris peaked as a Category 2 hurricane. After curving north-northeastward, Iris began to weaken after encountering increasing wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures. Nonetheless, it was still able to absorb Tropical Depression Karen on September 3. By early on the following day, Iris weakened to a tropical storm, six hours before becoming extratropical, while centered southeast of Newfoundland. While crossing through the Leeward Islands, Iris produced heavy rainfall. High waves in Trinidad caused coastal flooding and damage to boats. In Martinique, significant amounts of precipitation led to flooding and landslides. Four fatalities were reported on that island, two of which occurred after mudslides push a house off a cliff. Flooding was also reported in coastal areas, resulting in heavy damage in Le Vauclin. On Guadeloupe, the only island to record tropical storm force winds, one fatality occurred after a person drowned in a flooded river. Rainfall in Antigua damaged banana trees and caused flooding in low-lying areas.
=== Tropical Storm Jerry ===
A tropical wave which emerged off of Africa began convective organization in the vicinity of the Bahamas. On August 23, the system was declared Tropical Depression Eleven while located between Florida and Andros Island. The depression strengthened as it headed north-northwestward, despite only marginally favorable conditions. On the following day, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Jerry while located only offshore Florida. At 18:00 UTC on August 23, the storm made landfall later near Jupiter, Florida, as a minimal tropical storm with winds of . Jerry slowly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical depression late on August 24. After drifting across Florida, the cyclone briefly emerged over the Gulf of Mexico, but then headed northward and back inland. Jerry meandered over Georgia and eventually dissipated on August 28.

Jerry dropped heavy rainfall in Florida, especially in the southern portion of the state, where of precipitation fell in Golden Gate. Although the storm struck the east coast of the state, much of the damage in Florida occurred in Collier County. In that county, 340 houses were damaged and 12 others were destroyed due to flooding. Other nearby counties also reported flood damage, albeit less severe. Agricultural damage was also reported in southwest Florida, primarily to citrus crops. The storm also spawned two tornadoes in West Central Florida, though neither caused any damage. Heavy rainfall also occurred in Georgia, with some areas experiencing over of rain. The remnants of Jerry produced heavy precipitation in North and South Carolina, with observed in Antreville, South Carolina. In both states, many roads were flooded and numerous buildings and houses were damaged, especially in the Charlotte and Raleigh areas of North Carolina. Overall, there were eight fatalities and $40 million in damage associated with Jerry.
=== Tropical Storm Karen ===

On August 23, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa. Shortly after entering the Atlantic, the tropical wave developed into a low-pressure area. Over the next few days, the cloud pattern associated with the system fluctuated in organization and a tropical depression may have developed as early as August 24. Two days later, satellite imagery indicated a well-defined low-level cloud center. As a result, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Twelve developed at 12:00 UTC on August 26. The depression slowly intensified as it tracked west-northwestward under the influence of low- to mid-level flow. Although sea surface temperatures were warm, outflow from Hurricane Humberto may have slowed further strengthening of the depression.

The depression finally began to develop bands north of the center on August 27, though overall, the deep convection remained disorganized; the circulation of the depression also became elongated. Around 06:00 UTC on August 28, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Karen. Early on the following day, Karen peaked with maximum sustained winds of . By August 31, Karen north-northwestward around the circulation of Hurricane Iris and thus, a Fujiwhara interaction began. As the storm was approaching Iris, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began predicting on September 1 that Karen would merge with the former. On the following day, Karen weakened to a tropical depression. Early on September 3, Karen lost its well-defined center and merged with Iris at 06:00 UTC, while centered near Bermuda.
=== Hurricane Luis ===

A westward-moving tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen at 18:00 UTC on August 28. Initially, strong vertical shear hindered the depression from strengthening significantly; by early on August 29, however, it acquired sufficient organization to be named Tropical Storm Luis. The storm continued to strengthen slowly until wind shear decreased on August 30, causing Luis to become a hurricane later that day. By September 1, Luis became a major hurricane after it reached Category 3 intensity. Later that day, Luis was further upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane. Early on September 3, maximum sustained winds reached , though the lowest pressure in relation to Luis was not recorded until September 8. After weakening slightly, Luis passed near Antigua and made landfall in Barbuda early on September 5, before brushing Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, and Anguilla. After remaining a major hurricane for a week, Luis weakened to a Category 2 hurricane while northeast of the Bahamas on September 8; the weakening was possibly as a result of the storm crossing over decreasing ocean temperature due to upwelling from Hurricane Felix. On September 10, Luis rapidly accelerated northeastward and weakened to a Category 1 hurricane. Luis made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland early on September 11. While crossing the island, cold, dry air began impacting the storm, causing it to rapidly become extratropical and merge with a frontal zone shortly after reentering the Atlantic Ocean.

Strong winds and high waves wreaked havoc on several islands in the Lesser Antilles. In Antigua and Barbuda, winds reaching damaged numerous houses on Barbuda and destroyed nearly 45% of residences on Antigua. An estimated 1,700 people were forced to flee to shelters and about 3,200 others were left homeless. Within Antigua and Barbuda alone, three fatalities occurred, 165 people were injured, and damage totaled to $350 million. Strong winds in Guadeloupe caused moderate damage to homes and trees, especially in the Grande-Terre region. At Basse-Terre, nearly 100% of the banana crop was destroyed. Heavy rainfall in this portion of the island caused significant damage to roads. High waves also caused significant coastal flooding on the west coast of the island. About $50 million in damage was reported and one fatality occurred. The most significant effects occurred in the Netherlands Antilles, especially on Saint Martin – including both the French and Dutch side of the island. Approximately 60% of buildings were damaged to some degree. Additionally, severe disruption to utility services was reported, including water, electricity, and telephone service. Nine deaths and $1.8 billion in damage was reported on the island.

In Dominica, storm surge left 1,000 people homeless and $47 million in property losses. Winds exceeding caused severe impact in eastern Puerto Rico, especially Culebra. The area was left without electricity and 350 houses were extensively damaged or destroyed. On the main island, effects were primarily limited to downed trees and power lines on highways and electrical outages at about 200,000 houses. Throughout Puerto Rico, damaged reached $200 million and there were two deaths. Similarly strong winds lashed the United States Virgin Islands. Saint Thomas suffered the worst, where 75%–80% of houses were severely damaged or destroyed. The island&#x27;s hospital was flooded. Damage in the United States Virgin Islands was estimated at $300 million. Lesser effects occurred in the British Virgin Islands. Several homes were deroofed, especially on Anegada and Virgin Gorda. There were a number of telephone and electrical outages after a number of poles were toppled. In the United States, storm surge and high tides were reported along the East Coast, leading to two drowning deaths—one in North Carolina and the other in New York. In the former state, eight homes were swept into the ocean and damage reached $1.9 million. The storm also brought minor flooding to Newfoundland, with one death and $500,000 in damage. In addition, Luis was the earliest twelfth-named storm on record at the time. However, this record has since been broken by Hurricane Laura in 2020.
=== Tropical Depression Fourteen ===

A tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on September 4 and tracked westward across the Atlantic. The system gradually organized and became a tropical depression on September 9. However, the NHC did not operationally declare the system as Tropical Depression Fourteen until September 11, while the system was centered southeast of Bermuda. Although the National Hurricane Center predicted that it would intensify into a tropical storm, it was also noted shortly after advisories were initiated that &quot;this might have been the only opportunity to name this depression.&quot; The depression moved toward the northwest and encountered strong upper-level winds which removed the convection from the low-level center on September 13, causing the storm to dissipate.
=== Hurricane Marilyn ===
A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and entered into the Atlantic Ocean between September 7 and September 8. Although it had a large circulation, deep convection was minimal. After tracking steadily westward over the next few days, the system began developing convection. By 18:00 UTC on September 12, the system became Tropical Depression Fifteen, while centered about east-southeast of Barbados. The depression strengthened and became Tropical Storm Marilyn six hours later. Early on September 14, Marilyn further intensified to a hurricane. Later that day, Marilyn made landfall near Jenny Point, Dominica, with winds of at 21:00 UTC. Shortly thereafter, Marilyn entered the Caribbean Sea. While approaching the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, the storm became a Category 2 hurricane. After avoiding landfall, Marilyn re-entered into the Atlantic Ocean on September 16. The storm continued to intensify and early on September 17, it peaked as a minimal Category 3 hurricane. While curving northward, Marilyn fluctuated in intensity until beginning a weakening trend on September 20. The storm turned east-northeastward, and by the following day, it weakened to a tropical storm. By 06:00 UTC on September 22, Marilyn became extratropical while about southeast of Sable Island. The remnants of Marilyn lasted until merging with a cold front on October 1.

Throughout the Lesser Antilles, the storm produced high winds and heavy rainfall. After Hurricane Luis destroyed 90% of Dominica&#x27;s banana crop, Marilyn ruined the remaining 10%. In addition, a roof was torn off an emergency shelter. On Martinique, moderate rainfall and tropical storm force winds were recorded, though no damage or fatalities occurred. Effects in Guadeloupe were similar, but more intense. In Saint-Claude, of rain fell, which was the highest precipitation total associated with Marilyn. Wind speeds measured on Guadeloupe were also tropical storm force, with sustained winds of in Marie-Galante. Similar but lesser winds and rain occurred in Saint Barthélemy and Sint Maarten. However, the United States possessions, were, by far, suffered the most damage. Strong winds damaged or destroyed at least 80% of buildings on St. Thomas, which left 10,000 people homeless. Storm surge in the Charlotte Amalie harbor beached the &quot;USCGC Point Ledge&quot; and damaged many smaller boats. Moderate to severe damage was also reported on St. Croix and St. John, where 20–30% of houses were damaged. On Culebra, an offshore island of Puerto Rico, wind gusts as high as were reported. As a result, light planes were overturned and 250 homes were either damaged or destroyed. Large waves also caused street flooding on the island. Flash floods on the main island of Puerto Rico sent rivers above their banks. Moderate winds and rainfall on Antigua caused extensive damage to banana crops. While the storm bypassed Bermuda, tropical storm force winds were reported but no damage occurred. Overall, Marilyn caused at least 13 fatalities and $2.1 billion in damage.
=== Hurricane Noel ===

A tropical wave exited Africa on September 22 and within three days began to develop organized convection. After a low-level circulation formed, the system developed into Tropical Depression Sixteen late on September 26. Despite the presence of wind shear, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Noel on September 27. Moving northwestward, it gradually intensified to hurricane status by September 28, with peak winds of . After remaining a hurricane for 42 hours, during which it turned to the northeast, Noel weakened to tropical storm strength due to increased wind shear.

Although forecast to weaken to a tropical depression, Noel maintained minimal tropical storm intensity as it curved to the northwest. Following a decrease in shear, Noel regained hurricane status on October 5 about west-southwest of the Azores. It turned to the east, and the return of unfavorable conditions caused it to weaken to a tropical storm by October 6. A day later, Noel weakened below tropical storm strength as it transitioned to an extratropical cyclone. The remnants lasted until late on October 7 until they were absorbed by a cold front.
=== Hurricane Opal ===
On September 11, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa. The wave remained disorganized until nearing the Yucatán Peninsula, where it became a tropical depression on September 27 while south-southeast of Cozumel. The depression slowly moved over the Yucatán Peninsula for a few days, eventually emerging off the north coast, where it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Opal on September 30. After becoming a hurricane on October 2, the cyclone rapidly intensified and began moving north across the Gulf of Mexico. At 10:00 UTC on October 4, Opal peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Shortly thereafter, the storm began weakening. Upon making landfall in Pensacola Beach, Florida, around 22:00 UTC on October 4, winds had decreased to , which is Category 3 intensity. Opal weakened rapidly after moving inland, deteriorating to a tropical storm early on October 5 and then to a tropical depression about six hours later. At 18:00 UTC on October 5, Opal became extratropical over Kentucky. The extratropical storm dissipated over Ontario on October 6.

The precursor and initial stages of Opal brought heavy rainfall and flooding to Guatemala and Mexico. In the former, rivers near the border with Mexico overflowed, resulting in the evacuation of 110 families in Tecún Umán. Approximately 34,000 people were left homeless. Landslides left damage to infrastructure and agriculture, with about $17 million in crop damage alone. Thirty-one deaths occurred in Guatemala. In Mexico, more than 42,000 people were forced to evacuate as rivers overtopped their banks in Campeche and Tabasco, while an estimated 100,000 people evacuated due to the storm. Around 500,000 acres of crops had been destroyed by the floods. Agricultural losses in Campeche alone were estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Nineteen fatalities were reported in Mexico. In Florida, strong winds and storm surge left severe damage in the panhandle. From Wakulla County westward, many structures including homes and buildings were swept away or suffered some degree of damage. In Escambia, Okaloosa, and Santa Rosa counties, nearly 300 homes were destroyed and 1,000 others suffered major damage. The storm left at least $2.1 billion in damage in Florida.

In Alabama, storm surge ranging from left significant damage in coastal counties. Inland, tropical storm force winds gusts were observed as far north as Huntsville. Numerous trees and power lines were downed in several counties, leaving 2.6 million people across the state without electricity at the height of the storm. Downed trees also damaged some dwellings, primarily mobile homes. Several short-lived tornadoes destroyed over 125 homes, while 150 others suffered major damage. It was estimated that the storm caused over $182 million in damage in Alabama. Strong wind gusts were reported in northern Georgia, with a gust of at Marietta. There were more than 1,200 telephone poles knocked down and almost 5,000 power lines snapped. Wind damage in Rabun County alone reached about $5 million, while the pecan crop suffered around $50 million in damage. Several other states reported lesser wind damage and flooding. Throughout the United States, Opal caused approximately $4.7 billion in damage and 27 fatalities, including 14 in Georgia, 6 in Alabama, 5 in Florida, and 2 in North Carolina.
=== Tropical Storm Pablo ===

A tropical wave crossed the west coast of Africa and entered into the Atlantic Ocean on October 3. It quickly acquired a low-level circulation and by the following day, it developed into Tropical Depression Eighteen. Under the influence of deep easterlies, the storm tracked west-northwest and westward across the southern portions of the Atlantic Ocean. At 12:00 UTC on October 5, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Pablo. After becoming a tropical storm, Pablo developed well-defined outflow and the possibility of it strengthening into a hurricane seemed likely.

Although strong upper-level westerlies were ahead of the storm, it was still predicted that Pablo would reach hurricane status. By 12:00 UTC on October 6, Pablo peaked as a tropical storm. However, shortly thereafter, strong vertical shear then diminished much of the deep convection associated with the storm. Early on October 7, Pablo managed to re-develop some deep convection, though it did not restrengthen. Later that day, the low level circulation became indiscernible on infrared imagery. By 12:00 UTC on October 8, Pablo weakened to a tropical depression. Six hours later, Pablo dissipated while approaching the Windward Islands.
=== Hurricane Roxanne ===
A tropical wave merged with a broad low pressure area and an upper trough near Honduras. The system quickly organized into Tropical Depression Nineteen on October 7. The depression brushed Central America before curving northward, where it strengthened into Tropical Storm Roxanne on October 9. Roxanne posed a threat to Cuba and the Cayman Islands, which briefly prompted the issuance of a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch. However, a high pressure system forced Roxanne to tracked generally westward, which prevented it from significantly affecting the Cayman Islands. After becoming a hurricane on October 10, Roxanne began to rapidly strengthen. Later that day, the storm peaked as a minimal Category 3 hurricane, with winds of .

By 02:00 UTC on October 11, Roxanne made landfall just north of Tulum, Quintana Roo, on the Yucatán Peninsula with winds of . The storm significantly weakened inland and emerged into the Bay of Campeche as a tropical storm. Several shortwave troughs and ridges caused Roxanne to track aimlessly through the southern Gulf of Mexico. By October 14, it re-strengthened into a hurricane. After making a close approach to the Yucatán Peninsula while heading southeastward, Roxanne weakened to a tropical storm on October 17 as it doubled back to the northwest. A cold front forced Roxanne westward on October 19, and it simultaneously weakened to a tropical depression. The cyclone curved abruptly southward and dissipated just offshore of Veracruz on October 21.

In the Gulf of Mexico, a petroleum work barge with 245 people on board capsized, causing five people to drown. Due to its erratic movement, Roxanne dropped heavy rainfall in many areas of southern Mexico, and some areas reported over of precipitation. Extensive flooding occurred as a result, which destroyed crops, washed out roads, and damaged at least 40,000 homes. In addition, significant coastal flooding also occurred, as storm surge for nearly a week caused water to travel inland for hundreds of yards. High winds also occurred over the Yucatán Peninsula, with one station reporting hurricane-force winds on October 11. Unconfirmed reports also indicated that many hotel lobbies in Cancun and Cozumel were damaged from pounding waves. Overall, Roxanne caused $1.5 billion in damage and 29 fatalities. However, not all damage could be distinguished from Hurricane Opal.
=== Tropical Storm Sebastien ===

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on October 13 and moved across the Atlantic. On October 20, it was declared a depression after shower activity increased. Twelve hours after forming, the depression became Tropical Storm Sebastien. It organized and developed good outflow. Although wind shear was expected to limit intensification, the storm instead intensified and peaked with maximum sustained winds of late on October 22, based on a ship report. At the time, most of the convection was sheared away from the center, and the storm was interacting with a low pressure area near Puerto Rico. The storm initially moved northwestward, before turning to the southwest along the low-level flow and into an area of increasing shear. On October 24, Sebastien weakened into a tropical depression, and it maintained this intensity until landfall on Anguilla. The next day, the system dissipated near the United States Virgin Islands, although the remnants continued westward.

As it turned towards the Caribbean, the NHC issued a tropical storm watch for the United States Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands. Other islands were on alert as the NHC stated that the watch area may need to be expanded. Still recovering from Hurricane Marilyn less than a month prior, residents living in damaged homes reportedly evacuated their homes. However, the watch was discontinued 24 hours later after the storm weakened to a tropical depression. The remnants of Sebastien produced moderate rainfall across parts of Puerto Rico, peaking at in Quebradillas.
=== Hurricane Tanya ===
Early on October 27, a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression. The system strengthened into Tropical Storm Tanya later that day. Tanya initially tracked northeastward due to a shortwave trough, though an upper-level cyclone soon turned the storm toward eastward. Early on October 29, Tanya was upgraded to a hurricane. On the following day, a cold front to the west forced the cyclone to accelerate northeastward. Despite slightly cooler water, Tanya strengthened a bit more that afternoon, reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . That intensity was maintained until late on October 31, when the storm weakened as it traveled over cooler waters. Early on November 1, Tanya began to lose tropical characteristics while heading rapidly northeast towards the Azores. The system was downgraded to a tropical storm on November 1. That evening, Tanya became extratropical near the central Azores. The remnants turned northward and were absorbed by another extratropical cyclone early on November 3.

In the Azores, Tanya tore roofs off houses and downed trees, and light posts flew through houses and buildings. One death by drowning was reported, as well as several injuries. The islands of Faial, Pico, São Jorge, and Terceira were hardest hit, where the storm sank numerous boats and knocked down trees and power lines, which severely disrupted electricity and telecommunications. Additionally, several houses were damaged and moderate crop losses were reported.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1995. This is the same list used for the 1989 season, except for &quot;Humberto&quot;, which replaced &quot;Hugo&quot;. Storms were named &quot;Humberto&quot;, &quot;Luis&quot;, &quot;Marilyn&quot;, &quot;Noel&quot;, &quot;Opal&quot;, &quot;Pablo&quot;, &quot;Roxanne&quot;, &quot;Sebastien&quot;, and &quot;Tanya&quot; for the first (and in the cases of &quot;Luis&quot;, &quot;Marilyn&quot;, &quot;Opal&quot;, and &quot;Roxanne&quot;, only) time in 1995.

=== Retirement ===

The World Meteorological Organization retired the names &quot;Luis, Marilyn, Opal, and Roxanne&quot; from the Atlantic hurricane name lists following the 1995 season due to their destructiveness. They were replaced for the 2001 season by &quot;Lorenzo&quot;, &quot;Michelle&quot;, &quot;Olga&quot;, and &quot;Rebekah&quot;. As of , the 1995 season is one of four seasons to have four storm names retired, along with: 1955, 2004, and 2017; only the 2005 season had morewith five names retired.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1995 USD.

<doc id="598730" wikidata="Q6719227" url="?curid=598730" title="MV Andrew J. Barberi">
<text>The MV &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; was a &quot;Barberi&quot;-class ferry boat that was operated as part of the Staten Island Ferry between Manhattan and Staten Island in New York City. With a capacity of 6,000, she was among the highest-capacity boats in the ferry&#x27;s fleet. &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; was named after the longtime coach of Curtis High School&#x27;s football team. Since her introduction in 1981, she has had a history of incidents, including a 2003 crash that killed 11 people and a 2010 crash that injured 37. The boat was retired in 2023, and the city placed her for sale in 2024.

==Description==
The &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; was the first of two Staten Island Ferry boats in the &quot;Barberi&quot; class, which also includes MV &quot;Samuel I. Newhouse&quot; (built 1982). Each boat has a crew of 15, can carry 6,000 passengers but no cars, is long and wide, with a draft of , a gross tonnage of , a service speed of , and four engines capable of 8,000 horsepower (6.0 MW). The &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; has two propellers each capable of . Both ships in the &quot;Barberi&quot; class were built at the Equitable Shipyard in New Orleans, at a cost of $16.5 million each. At the time of construction, the ships&#x27; capacity was the largest of any licensed ferry in the world.

The &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; made her maiden voyage in August 1981 and, along with the &quot;Samuel I. Newhouse&quot;, was built to replace three steam-powered vessels. &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; was named after the longtime coach of Curtis High School&#x27;s football team, who had died shortly before the ship was commissioned. Barberi coached throughout the 1950s, &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s and was instrumental in the development of scholastic football on Staten Island.

==2003 crash==
On October 15, 2003, &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; collided with a pier on Staten Island. Eleven people were killed, including one decapitation, and 70 more injured as a result. On March 8, 2005, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) published a report on its investigation into the incident. The NTSB determined the probable cause of the collision was the assistant pilot&#x27;s sudden incapacitation due to unreported and illegal use of prescription medications for chronic pain, high blood pressure and insomnia (none of these conditions had been reported to the Coast Guard as required by law), with a contributory cause of the master&#x27;s failure to maintain command and control of his vessel.

The assistant pilot pleaded guilty to 11 counts of seaman&#x27;s manslaughter and falsifying his medical forms. The ferry director also pleaded guilty after failing to enforce a rule requiring that ferries be operated by two pilots, and the doctor who had certified the assistant pilot pleaded guilty to making a false statement about the assistant pilot&#x27;s health. &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; was rebuilt in West Brighton, Staten Island by Caddell Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. and, on July 1, 2004, returned to regular service. A plaque was installed inside the ferryboat, commemorating the victims of the crash.

==2010 crash==
At 9:18 a.m. on May 8, 2010, the &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; forcefully collided with the St. George Terminal on Staten Island, hitting a passenger bridge at the terminal. She had been traveling at about at the time of the collision. Around 40 passengers were taken to the hospital for a variety of injuries. The only damage was found above the waterline of the Staten Island end of the vessel.

An NTSB investigation found that there was a problem with the vessel&#x27;s propulsion system. At one end of the vessel was a propulsion control panel, where electric solenoids were used to shift hydraulic valves. These valves sent hydraulic oil to the control cylinders on the propulsion units, shifting the pitch setting of the units. Investigators found that bronze ring fragments had lodged themselves in the solenoids, preventing their correct operation. The NTSB announced their findings in April 2012.

==Retirement and auction==
The New York City government was looking to retire the aging &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; by 2012, and her replacements, the &quot;Ollis&quot;-class ferries, were announced in 2014. The &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; was retired from service in October 2023. The New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services placed the boat for sale at an auction in May 2024; the starting price for the auction was set at $155,000. That June, the boat was sold for $101,000.

<doc id="598735" wikidata="Q1029168" url="?curid=598735" title="Common Scrambling Algorithm">
<text>The Common Scrambling Algorithm (CSA) is the encryption algorithm used in the DVB digital television broadcasting for encrypting video streams.

CSA was specified by ETSI and adopted by the DVB consortium in May 1994. It is being succeeded by CSA3, based on a combination of 128-bit AES and a confidential block cipher, XRC. However, CSA3 is not yet in any significant use, so CSA continues to be the dominant cipher for protecting DVB broadcasts.

==History==
CSA was largely kept secret until 2002. The patent papers gave some hints, but important details, like the layout of the so-called S-boxes, remained secret. Without these, free implementations of the algorithm was not possible. Initially, CSA was to remain implemented in hardware only, making it difficult to reverse engineer existing implementations.

In 2002 FreeDec was released, implementing CSA in software. Though released as binary only, disassembly revealed the missing details and allowed reimplementation of the algorithm in higher-level programming languages.

With CSA now publicly known in its entirety, cryptanalysts started looking for weaknesses.

== Description of the cipher ==
The CSA algorithm is composed of two distinct ciphers: a block cipher and a stream cipher.

When used in encryption mode the data are first encrypted using the 64-bit block cipher in CBC mode, starting from packet end.
The stream cipher is then applied from packet start.

=== Block cipher ===

The block cipher process 64-bit blocks in 56 rounds. It uses 8 bits from an expanded key on each round.

=== Stream cipher ===

The first 32 round of the stream cipher are used for initialization and do not generate any output.
The first 64 bits of data are used as initialization vector during this phase and are left unchanged.
The stream cipher then generates 2 bits of pseudo-random stream on each round which are xored starting at bit 64 of the packet.

==Weaknesses==
Were CSA to be broken, encrypted DVB transmissions would be decipherable, which would compromise paid digital television services, as DVB has been standardised for digital terrestrial television in Europe and elsewhere, and is used by many satellite television providers.

Most attacks on the pay-TV system have not targeted CSA itself, but instead the various key exchange systems responsible for &quot;generating&quot; the CSA keys (Conax, Irdeto, Nagravision, VideoGuard, etc.), either by reverse-engineering and breaking the algorithms altogether, or by intercepting the keys in real-time as they are generated on a legitimate decoder, and then distributing them to others (so-called card sharing).

===Software implementations and bit slicing===
The stream cipher part of CSA is prone to bit slicing, a software implementation technique which allows decryption of many blocks, or the same block with many different keys, at the same time. This significantly speeds up a brute force search implemented in software, although the factor is too low for a practical real-time attack.

The block cipher part is harder to bit slice, as the S-boxes involved are too large (8x8) to be efficiently implemented using logical operations, a prerequisite for bit slicing to be more efficient than a regular implementation. However, as all operations are on 8-bit subblocks, the algorithm can be implemented using regular SIMD, or a form of “byteslicing”. As most SIMD instruction sets, (with the exception of AVX2) do not support parallel look-up tables, the S-box lookups are done in a non-bytesliced implementation, but their integration into the rest of the algorithm is not hampered markedly by the byteslicing.

Both techniques are used in libdvbcsa, a free implementation of CSA.

===Cryptanalysis===
Cryptanalysis is made more difficult as most data is protected both by the block and the stream cipher. Adaption codes can result in packets with some data protected by only the block cipher or the stream cipher.

===Brute force approach===
While the CSA algorithm uses 64-bit keys, most of the time, only 48 bits of the key are unknown, since bytes 3 and 7 are used as parity bytes in CA systems, and may be easily recalculated. This allows for possible known-plaintext attacks when combined with knowledge of the underlying plaintext structure. As the first three bytes of the PES header are always 0x000001, it would be possible to launch a brute force attack. Such an attack would reveal millions of possible keys, but still few enough to make it practical to attempt decryption of other parts of the data with the same key in a second pass to recover the true key.

===Known-plaintext attack===
In 2011, a group of German researchers released an attack on CSA as used in the DVB system. By noting that MPEG-2 padding frequently requires long series of zeroes, leading to entire 184-byte cells being encrypted with zeroes only, it is possible to build up a rainbow table recovering the key from such a known-zero block. (A block would be known to be zero if two blocks with the same ciphertext were found, since presumably both would be zero blocks.) The attack described would require about 7.9 TB of storage, and enable an attacker with a GPU to recover a key in about seven seconds with 96.8% certainty. However, the attack is only effective when such all-zero padding blocks are present (i.e., in scenes with very little movement or noise), and it would be easily mitigated by for instance sending such all-zero cells unencrypted.

This differs from the brute-force attack examples already mentioned, in that the plain-text contents of the entire cell is known before the attack, not just parts of a block, which enables the ahead-of-time computation of the rainbow table.

===Fault attack===
In 2004, a fault attack was published on the block cipher. The basic idea was to introduce a few deliberate faults in the intermediate calculations, making it possible to deduce the last eight round keys. From this, the final key can be computed.

While very few faults are needed (on average two or three per round key recovered), fault attacks are usually impractical to carry out, in that it requires the ability to change bits at will inside the hardware of a decoder that already has the key in question.

<text>Rowland Constantine O&#x27;Malley Armstrong (born 8 May 1966), known professionally as both Rollo and R Plus, is an English DJ and music producer. He is one half of the remix/production duo Rollo &amp; Sister Bliss and is a founding, non-touring, member of the electronic music group Faithless. He has produced and remixed many tracks for Dido, Rob Dougan, Pet Shop Boys, Simply Red, R. Kelly, U2, Moby, Grace, Tricky and Suede. He is also known for producing the UEFA Euro 2008 theme, which is also used as UEFA Super Cup, UEFA Women&#x27;s Championship, and youth tournaments theme since 2017.

== Early life ==
Rollo was born to an Irish publisher and a French-English poet. His younger sister is singer Dido. He studied at the University of York and was an active member of the student radio station URY. Later bandmate Sister Bliss has claimed that Rollo experiences synaesthesia, seeing &quot;music as colours&quot;.

== Career ==
Rollo has appeared on a large number of music projects, both within groups and solo, using various monikers, including Faithless (which he formed in 1995 with Sister Bliss, Jamie Catto and Maxi Jazz), Rollo Goes ..., Our Tribe (with Rob Dougan), and Dusted.

In late 1991, Rollo founded Cheeky Records, releasing two singles before the label folded. In 1992 Champion Records stepped in to help with funding and advice, and the label was restarted, with &quot;Reverence&quot; by Faithless its first album release (it has since been bought out by BMG). In 1992, Rollo co-wrote and co-produced Felix&#x27;s hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot;, which reached number 1 in Finland, Italy, Spain and Switzerland, as well as reaching number 6 on the UK Singles Chart.

In the United States, Rollo is known for his production work on Dido&#x27;s albums: &quot;No Angel&quot; (1999), &quot;Life for Rent&quot; (2003), &quot;Safe Trip Home&quot; (2008), Girl Who Got Away (2013) and &quot;Still on My Mind&quot; (2019). Rollo was also a producer on singer-songwriter Kristine W&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Land of the Living&quot;.

In 2008, Rollo composed the official melody of the UEFA Euro 2008 competition. and UEFA Euro 2012. He was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Original Song for his work with A.R. Rahman and Dido on &quot;If I Rise&quot;, featuring in the 2010 Danny Boyle film &quot;127 Hours&quot;.

===R Plus===
On 11 October 2019, Rollo released his first solo album, &quot;The Last Summer&quot; under the alias &quot;R Plus&quot;. It charted at No. 96 on the UK Album Sales Chart and at No. 55 on the UK Album Download Chart. On 19 July 2020, &quot;The Last Summer (Deluxe Edition)&quot; was released, and credited as by both R Plus and Dido.

After moving record labels to Armada Music, Rollo (as R Plus) released a cover of Joy Division&#x27;s 1980 hit &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; on 7 May 2021, and features singer Amelia Fox. Rollo spoke of the remake: &quot;[The song] meant the world to me when I was teenager, and it still does. I stole my first Joy Division T-shirt from a shop in Camden Market, and got to fleetingly meet guitarist Peter Hook years later at a party at the Hacienda in Manchester. It took a long time before I felt brave enough to cover this song, before I felt I knew what I was doing as a producer [...] To introduce Amelia Fox and the new R Plus album to the world, we thought it would be good to start with this cover. We wanted our version to sound like a piece of music found in a time capsule buried under the now empty DJ booth at the Hacienda, and wanted to capture both the sadness of the song and the late-night euphoria of that legendary club.&quot; In July 2021, R Plus released &quot;Hey Lover&quot; again featuring Fox. 

On 13 May 2022, R Plus released &quot;WeDisappear&quot;, a collaboration album with Amelia Fox. &quot;Makes Me Feel Good&quot; and an edited version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Really Have Some Fun&quot;, released 28 April 2023, were released as singles. On 24 November 2023, R Plus released the album &quot;For Lovers, Not Killers&quot;, alongside Fox. Some streaming services erroneously list Faithless as a collaborative artist on R Plus releases, due to Armstrong&#x27;s involvement in both projects.

<text>The skeletal muscle pump or musculovenous pump is a collection of skeletal muscles that aid the heart in the circulation of blood. It is especially important in increasing venous return to the heart, but may also play a role in arterial blood flow.

==General==
The skeletal muscle pump is vital in negating orthostatic intolerance when standing. When moving upright, the blood volume moves to the peripheral parts of the body. To combat this, the muscles involved in standing contract and help to bring venous blood volume to the heart. The pump is important in affecting the central and local supply of blood output. Venous return, cardiac output, and stroke volume were all increased during exercise experiments, as well as affecting the local muscle being used, blood volume.

==Arterial blood pumping==
Between muscle relaxations, intramuscular pressure transiently returns to a level below the venous blood pressure. This allows blood from the capillary system to refill the veins until the next contraction. It is postulated that this change in pressure may be great enough to draw blood from the arterial side to the venous side. It is hypothesized that this pressure drop during rhythmic contraction actually increases blood flow through the muscle, and may be responsible for a portion of the increase in muscle blood flow immediately at the onset of activity. This explanation is attractive, because it would explain the readily observable tight coupling between muscle contraction and a rapid increase in muscle blood flow. However, recent evidence has emerged that cast doubts on this theory. Experiments have shown that a strong muscle contraction can occur without a corresponding increase in skeletal muscle blood flow. Given the proposed manner of action of the muscle pump to increase arterial blood flow, it would seem impossible for a muscle contraction and skeletal muscle hyperemia to be uncoupled. Another experiment recently was only able to find evidence that vasodilation, not the skeletal muscle pump, was responsible for maintaining proper pressure and blood return. This might have to do with the lack of rigorous physiological tests thus far used to be able to prove the pump.

Experiments have shown the use of passive leg exercises, where only vasodilation was used, was responsible for increased blood return.

<doc id="598741" wikidata="Q2964004" url="?curid=598741" title="Cardiothoracic surgery">
<text>Cardiothoracic surgery is the field of medicine involved in surgical treatment of organs inside the thoracic cavity — generally treatment of conditions of the heart (heart disease), lungs (lung disease), and other pleural or mediastinal structures.

In most countries, cardiothoracic surgery is further subspecialized into cardiac surgery (involving the heart and the great vessels) and thoracic surgery (involving the lungs, esophagus, thymus, etc.); the exceptions are the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, India and some European Union countries such as Portugal.

==Training==
A cardiac surgery residency typically comprises anywhere from four to six years (or longer) of training to become a fully qualified surgeon. Cardiac surgery training may be combined with thoracic surgery and/or vascular surgery and called cardiovascular (CV) / cardiothoracic (CT) / cardiovascular thoracic (CVT) surgery. Cardiac surgeons may enter a cardiac surgery residency directly from medical school, or first complete a general surgery residency followed by a fellowship. Cardiac surgeons may further sub-specialize cardiac surgery by doing a fellowship in a variety of topics including pediatric cardiac surgery, cardiac transplantation, adult-acquired heart disease, weak heart issues, and many more problems in the heart.

===Australia and New Zealand===
The highly competitive Surgical Education and Training (SET) program in Cardiothoracic Surgery is six years in duration, usually commencing several years after completing medical school. Training is administered and supervised via a bi-national (Australia and New Zealand) training program. Multiple examinations take place throughout the course of training, culminating in a final fellowship exam in the final year of training. Upon completion of training, surgeons are awarded a Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (FRACS), denoting that they are qualified specialists. Trainees having completed a training program in General Surgery and have obtained their FRACS will have the option to complete fellowship training in Cardiothoracic Surgery of four years in duration, subject to college approval. It takes around eight to ten years minimum of post-graduate (post-medical school) training to qualify as a cardiothoracic surgeon. Competition for training places and for public (teaching) hospital places is very high currently, leading to concerns regarding workforce planning in Australia.

===Canada===
Historically, cardiac surgeons in Canada completed general surgery followed by a fellowship in CV / CT / CVT. During the 1990s, the Canadian cardiac surgery training programs changed to six-year &quot;direct-entry&quot; programs following medical school. The direct-entry format provides residents with experience related to cardiac surgery they would not receive in a general surgery program (e.g. echocardiography, coronary care unit, cardiac catheterization etc.). Residents in this program will also spend time training in thoracic and vascular surgery. Typically, this is followed by a fellowship in either Adult Cardiac Surgery, Heart Failure/Transplant, Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery, Aortic Surgery, Thoracic Surgery, Pediatric Cardiac Surgery or Cardiac ICU. Contemporary Canadian candidates completing general surgery and wishing to pursue cardiac surgery often complete a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship in the United States. The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada also provides a three-year cardiac surgery fellowship for qualified general surgeons that is offered at several training sites including the University of Alberta, the University of British Columbia and the University of Toronto.

Thoracic surgery is its own separate 2–3 year fellowship of general or cardiac surgery in Canada.

===United States===

Cardiac surgery training in the United States is combined with general thoracic surgery and called cardiothoracic surgery or thoracic surgery. A cardiothoracic surgeon in the U.S. is a physician who first completes a general surgery residency (typically 5–7 years), followed by a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship (typically 2–3 years). The cardiothoracic surgery fellowship typically spans two or three years, but certification is based on the number of surgeries performed as the operating surgeon, not the time spent in the program, in addition to passing rigorous board certification tests. Two other pathways to shorten the duration of training have been developed: (1) a combined general-thoracic surgery residency consisting of four years of general surgery training and three years of cardiothoracic training at the same institution and (2) an integrated six-year cardiothoracic residency (in place of the general surgery residency plus cardiothoracic residency), which have each been established at many programs (over 20). Applicants match into the integrated six-year (I-6) programs directly out of medical school, and the application process has been extremely competitive for these positions as there were approximately 160 applicants for 10 spots in the U.S. in 2010. As of May 2013, there are 20 approved programs, which include the following:

Integrated six-year Cardiothoracic Surgery programs in the United States:
* Medical College of Wisconsin
* Stanford University – two positions
* University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
* University of Virginia
* Columbia University – two positions
* University of Pennsylvania
* University of Pittsburgh – two positions
* University of Washington
* Northwestern University
* Mount Sinai Hospital, New York

* Medical University of South Carolina
* University of Southern California – two positions
* University of Rochester
* University of California, Davis
* Indiana University
* University of Kentucky
* Emory University
* University of Michigan
* Yale University
The American Board of Thoracic Surgery offers a special pathway certificate in congenital cardiac surgery which typically requires an additional year of fellowship. This formal certificate is unique because congenital cardiac surgeons in other countries do not have formal evaluation and recognition of pediatric training by a licensing body.

==Cardiac surgery==
The earliest operations on the pericardium (the sac that surrounds the heart) took place in the 19th century and were performed by Francisco Romero (1801) Dominique Jean Larrey, Henry Dalton, and Daniel Hale Williams. The first surgery on the heart itself was performed by Norwegian surgeon Axel Cappelen on 4 September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. He ligated a bleeding coronary artery in a 24-year-old man who had been stabbed in the left axilla and was in deep shock upon arrival. Access was through a left thoracotomy. The patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours, but became ill with increasing temperature and he ultimately died from what the post mortem proved to be mediastinitis on the third postoperative day. The first successful surgery of the heart, performed without any complications, was by Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, who repaired a stab wound to the right ventricle on September 7, 1896.

Surgery in great vessels (aortic coarctation repair, Blalock-Taussig shunt creation, closure of patent ductus arteriosus) became common after the turn of the century and falls in the domain of cardiac surgery, but technically cannot be considered heart surgery. One of the more commonly known cardiac surgery procedures is the coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), also known as &quot;bypass surgery.&quot; 

===Early approaches to heart malformations===
In 1925 operations on the heart valves were unknown. Henry Souttar operated successfully on a young woman with mitral stenosis. He made an opening in the appendage of the left atrium and inserted a finger into this chamber in order to palpate and explore the damaged mitral valve. The patient survived for several years but Souttar&#x27;s physician colleagues at that time decided the procedure was not justified and he could not continue.

Cardiac surgery changed significantly after World War II. In 1948 four surgeons carried out successful operations for mitral stenosis resulting from rheumatic fever. Horace Smithy (1914–1948) revived an operation due to Dr Dwight Harken of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital using a punch to remove a portion of the mitral valve. Charles Bailey (1910–1993) at the Hahnemann Hospital, Philadelphia, Dwight Harken in Boston and Russell Brock at Guy&#x27;s Hospital all adopted Souttar&#x27;s method. All these men started work independently of each other, within a few months. This time Souttar&#x27;s technique was widely adopted although there were modifications.

In 1947 Thomas Holmes Sellors (1902–1987) of the Middlesex Hospital operated on a Fallot&#x27;s Tetralogy patient with pulmonary stenosis and successfully divided the stenosed pulmonary valve. In 1948, Russell Brock, probably unaware of Sellor&#x27;s work, used a specially designed dilator in three cases of pulmonary stenosis. Later in 1948 he designed a punch to resect the infundibular muscle stenosis which is often associated with Fallot&#x27;s Tetralogy. Many thousands of these &quot;blind&quot; operations were performed until the introduction of heart bypass made direct surgery on valves possible.

===Open heart surgery===
Open heart surgery is a procedure in which the patient&#x27;s heart is opened and surgery is performed on the internal structures of the heart. It was discovered by Wilfred G. Bigelow of the University of Toronto that the repair of intracardiac pathologies was better done with a bloodless and motionless environment, which means that the heart should be stopped and drained of blood. The first successful intracardiac correction of a congenital heart defect using hypothermia was performed by C. Walton Lillehei and F. John Lewis at the University of Minnesota on September 2, 1952. The following year, Soviet surgeon Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vishnevskiy conducted the first cardiac surgery under local anesthesia.

Surgeons realized the limitations of hypothermia – complex intracardiac repairs take more time and the patient needs blood flow to the body, particularly to the brain. The patient needs the function of the heart and lungs provided by an artificial method, hence the term cardiopulmonary bypass. John Heysham Gibbon at Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia reported in 1953 the first successful use of extracorporeal circulation by means of an oxygenator, but he abandoned the method, disappointed by subsequent failures. In 1954 Lillehei realized a successful series of operations with the controlled cross-circulation technique in which the patient&#x27;s mother or father was used as a &#x27;heart-lung machine&#x27;. John W. Kirklin at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota started using a Gibbon type pump-oxygenator in a series of successful operations, and was soon followed by surgeons in various parts of the world.

Nazih Zuhdi performed the first total intentional hemodilution open heart surgery on Terry Gene Nix, age 7, on February 25, 1960, at Mercy Hospital, Oklahoma City, OK. The operation was a success; however, Nix died three years later in 1963. In March, 1961, Zuhdi, Carey, and Greer, performed open heart surgery on a child, age , using the total intentional hemodilution machine. In 1985 Zuhdi performed Oklahoma&#x27;s first successful heart transplant on Nancy Rogers at Baptist Hospital. The transplant was successful, but Rogers, who had cancer, died from an infection 54 days after surgery.

===Modern beating-heart surgery===
Since the 1990s, surgeons have begun to perform &quot;off-pump bypass surgery&quot; – coronary artery bypass surgery without the aforementioned cardiopulmonary bypass. In these operations, the heart is beating during surgery, but is stabilized to provide an almost still work area in which to connect the conduit vessel that bypasses the blockage; in the U.S., most conduit vessels are harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as endoscopic vessel harvesting (EVH).

Some researchers believe that the off-pump approach results in fewer post-operative complications, such as postperfusion syndrome, and better overall results. Study results are controversial as of 2007, the surgeon&#x27;s preference and hospital results still play a major role.

===Minimally invasive surgery===
A new form of heart surgery that has grown in popularity is robot-assisted heart surgery. This is where a machine is used to perform surgery while being controlled by the heart surgeon. The main advantage to this is the size of the incision made in the patient. Instead of an incision being at least big enough for the surgeon to put his hands inside, it does not have to be bigger than &quot;pencil-sized&quot; holes for the robot&#x27;s much smaller &quot;hands&quot; to enter a surgical patient&#x27;s body.

In September 2024, the first successful fully robotic heart transplant took place at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh, led by surgeon Feras Khaliel, head of the hospital&#x27;s cardiac surgery and director of its Robotics and Minimally Invasive Surgery Program. In December 2024, the first robotic surgery for a combined robotic aortic valve replacement (AVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was successfully performed through one small incision at West Virginia University, led by surgeon Vinay Badhwar, who is the executive chair of the WVU Heart and Vascular Institute and a vice president of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

===Pediatric cardiovascular surgery===
Pediatric cardiovascular surgery is surgery of the heart of children. The first operations to repair cardio-vascular defects in children were performed by Clarence Crafoord in Sweden when he repaired coarctation of the aorta in a 12-year-old boy. The first attempts to palliate congenital heart disease were performed by Alfred Blalock with the assistance of William Longmire, Denton Cooley, and Blalock&#x27;s experienced technician, Vivien Thomas in 1944 at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Techniques for repair of congenital heart defects without the use of a bypass machine were developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Among them was an open repair of an atrial septal defect using hypothermia, inflow occlusion and direct vision in a 5-year-old child performed in 1952 by Lewis and Tauffe. C. Walter Lillihei used cross-circulation between a boy and his father to maintain perfusion while performing a direct repair of a ventricular septal defect in a 4-year-old child in 1954. He continued to use cross-circulation and performed the first corrections of tetralogy of Fallot and presented those results in 1955 at the American Surgical Association. In the long-run, pediatric cardiovascular surgery would rely on the cardiopulmonary bypass machine developed by Gibbon and Lillehei as noted above.

===Risks of cardiac surgery===
The development of cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques has reduced the mortality rates of these surgeries to relatively low ranks. For instance, repairs of congenital heart defects are currently estimated to have 4–6% mortality rates. A major concern with cardiac surgery is the incidence of neurological damage. Stroke occurs in 5% of all people undergoing cardiac surgery, and is higher in patients at risk for stroke. A more subtle constellation of neurocognitive deficits attributed to cardiopulmonary bypass is known as postperfusion syndrome, sometimes called &quot;pumphead&quot;. The symptoms of postperfusion syndrome were initially felt to be permanent, but were shown to be transient with no permanent neurological impairment.

To assess the performance of surgical units and individual surgeons, a popular risk model has been created called the EuroSCORE. This takes a number of health factors from a patient and using precalculated logistic regression coefficients attempts to give a percentage chance of survival to discharge. Within the UK this EuroSCORE was used to give a breakdown of all the centres for cardiothoracic surgery and to give some indication of whether the units and their individual surgeons performed within an acceptable range. The results are available on the CQC website. The precise methodology used has however not been published to date nor has the raw data on which the results are based.

Infection represents the primary non-cardiac complication from cardiothoracic surgery. Infections include mediastinitis, infectious myo- or pericarditis, endocarditis, cardiac device infection, pneumonia, empyema, and bloodstream infections. &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; colitis can develop when prophylactic or post-operative antibiotics are used.

Post-operative patients of cardiothoracic surgery are at risk of nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, and aspiration pneumonia.

== Thoracic surgery==
A pleurectomy is a surgical procedure in which part of the pleura is removed. It is sometimes used in the treatment of pneumothorax and mesothelioma. In case of pneumothorax, only the apical and the diaphragmatic portions of the parietal pleura are removed.

===Lung volume reduction surgery===
Lung volume reduction surgery, or LVRS, can improve the quality of life for certain patients with COPD of emphysematous type, when other treatment options are not enough. Parts of the lung that are particularly damaged by emphysema are removed, allowing the remaining, relatively good lung to expand and work more efficiently. The beneficial effects are correlated with the achieved reduction in residual volume. Conventional LVRS involves resection of the most severely affected areas of emphysematous, non-bullous lung (aim is for 20–30%). This is a surgical option involving a mini-thoracotomy for patients in end stage COPD due to underlying emphysema, and can improve lung elastic recoil as well as diaphragmatic function.

The National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) was a large multicentre study (N = 1218) comparing LVRS with non-surgical treatment. Results suggested that there was no overall survival advantage in the LVRS group, except for mainly upper-lobe emphysema + poor exercise capacity, and significant improvements were seen in exercise capacity in the LVRS group. Later studies have shown a wider scope of treatment with better outcomes.

Possible complications of LVRS include prolonged air leak (mean duration post surgery until all chest tubes removed is 10.9 ± 8.0 days.

In people who have a predominantly upper lobe emphysema, lung volume reduction surgery could result in better health status and lung function, though it also increases the risk of early mortality and adverse events.

LVRS is used widely in Europe, though its application in the United States is mostly experimental.

A less invasive treatment is available as a bronchoscopic lung volume reduction procedure.

=== Lung cancer surgery ===

Not all lung cancers are suitable for surgery. The stage, location and cell type are important limiting factors. In addition, people who are very ill with a poor performance status or who have inadequate pulmonary reserve would be unlikely to survive. Even with careful selection, the overall operative death rate is about 4.4%.

In non-small cell lung cancer staging, stages IA, IB, IIA, and IIB are suitable for surgical resection.

Pulmonary reserve is measured by spirometry. If there is no evidence of undue shortness of breath or diffuse parenchymal lung disease, and the FEV1 exceeds 2 litres or 80% of predicted, the person is fit for pneumonectomy. If the FEV1 exceeds 1.5 litres, the patient is fit for lobectomy.

There is weak evidence to indicate that participation in exercise programs before lung cancer surgery may reduce the risk of complications after surgery.

==== Complications ====
A prolonged air leak (PAL) can occur in 8–25% of people following lung cancer surgery. This complication delays chest tube removal and is associated with an increased length of hospital stay following a lung resection (lung cancer surgery). The use of surgical sealants may reduce the incidence of prolonged air leaks, however, this intervention alone has not been shown to results in a decreased length of hospital stay following lung cancer surgery.

There is no strong evidence to support using non-invasive positive pressure ventilation following lung cancer surgery to reduce pulmonary complications.

====Types====
* Lobectomy (removal of a lobe of the lung)
* Sublobar resection (removal of part of lobe of the lung)
* Segmentectomy (removal of an anatomic division of a particular lobe of the lung)
* Pneumonectomy (removal of an entire lung)
* Wedge resection
* Sleeve/bronchoplastic resection (removal of an associated tubular section of the associated main bronchial passage during lobectomy with subsequent reconstruction of the bronchial passage)
* VATS lobectomy (minimally invasive approach to lobectomy that may allow for diminished pain, quicker return to full activity, and diminished hospital costs)
* esophagectomy (removal of the esophagus)

<doc id="598743" wikidata="Q2585855" url="?curid=598743" title="Economic history of Canada">
<text>Canadian historians until the 1960s tended to focus on the history of Canada&#x27;s economy because of the far fewer political, economic, religious and military conflicts present in Canadian history than in other societies. Many of the most prominent English Canadian historians from this period were economic historians, such as Harold Innis, Donald Creighton and Arthur R. M. Lower.
Scholars of Canadian economic history were heirs to the traditions that developed in Europe and the United States, but frameworks of study that worked well elsewhere often failed in Canada. The heavily Marxist influenced economic history present in Europe has little relevance to most of Canadian history. A focus on class, urban areas, and industry fails to address Canada&#x27;s rural and resource-based economy. Similarly, the monetarist school that is powerful in the United States has been weakly represented.

Instead, the study of economic history in Canada is highly focused on economic geography, and for many years the dominant school of thought has been the staples thesis. This school of thought bases the study of the Canadian economy on the study of natural resources. This approach has been used to study the early European history of the Canadian economy, arguing that the Canadian economy during that time developed through exploitation of a series of staples which were then exported to Europe. The staples thesis has since also become used outside of Canada, such as Australia and many developing nations.

Before the arrival of Europeans, the First Nations of what would become Canada had a large and vibrant trade network. Furs, tools, decorative items, and other goods were often transported thousands of kilometres, mostly by canoe throughout the many rivers and lakes of the region.

== Fishing in Canada ==
=== Atlantic Fisheries ===
The earliest European settlements in Canada were the fisheries of the East Coast, especially the Grand Banks off Newfoundland. Boats from France, Portugal, Spain, and Great Britain would traverse the Atlantic, fish for a summer and then return laden with fish. The trade was originally dominated by fishers from southern Europe. In Catholic countries, demand for fish was much greater. It was from the northern nations of Britain and France that the first settlers came, however. Spain, Portugal and the south of France had abundant supplies of salt because in the warm climates it was a simple matter to evaporate seawater. They would thus bring barrels of salt with them to the fishing grounds, salt the fish aboard ship, and return to Europe never having touched land. In the colder and wetter climate of the British Isles and northern France, salt was in scarce supply. To preserve the fish, they were dried by hanging them on large fish racks on the coast of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. These drying stations were active for months of the year, and eventually permanent settlements grew up around them. These small settlements totaled only a few thousand people, but they were many of the first European arrivals in North America

=== Pacific Fisheries ===
Prior to European contact, First Nations people on the Pacific Coast would frequently trade salmon with First Nations people of the Canadian Prairies. Shortly after European settlements had begun appearing in British Columbia in the mid 19th century, the first salmon canneries had begun appearing alongside them, the first being a salmon cannery in the Fraser river in 1867. The next forty years saw the salmon industry gradually become an increasingly lucrative trade in the pacific. Places such as the Fraser river and the Skeena river saw a sharp rise in immigration and the development of the fishing industry. With the outbreak of the Second World War came an increased demand for fishing industries of British Columbia to help relieve the war effort. The ten-year average for total cases of canned salmon in British Columbia from 1910 to 1942 was 1.6 million, while the Second World War&#x27;s average alone was more than 2 million, with a peak of 2.25 million in 1942.

== Mercantilism and corporatism ==

Canada&#x27;s economic development in colonial times was based on the economic policy of mercantilism. This economic idea sought to derive the maximum material benefit from the colony, for the homeland, with a minimum of imperial investment in the colony itself. The ideology was embodied in New France through the establishment under Royal Charter of a number of corporate trading monopolies including La Compagnie des Marchands, which operated from 1613 to 1621 and the Compagnie de Montmorency, from that date until 1627. It was in turn replaced by La Compagnie des Cent-Associés created in 1627, by the King of France, Louis XIII and the Communauté des habitants in 1643. These were the first corporations to operate in what is now Canada.

== Staples thesis ==

Harold Innis (1894–1952), based in the history department at the University of Toronto, and William Archibald Mackintosh (1895–1970), based in the economics department at Queen&#x27;s University developed the Staples thesis. They argued that the Canadian Economy (beyond the level of subsistence farming) was primarily based on exports of a series of staples—fish, fur, timber, wheat—that shipped to Britain and the British Empire. Industrialization came much later. The thesis explains Canadian economic development as a lateral, east–west conception of trade. Innis argued that Canada developed as it did because of the nature of its staple commodities: raw materials, such as fish, fur, lumber, agricultural products and minerals. This trading link cemented Canada&#x27;s cultural links to Britain. The search for and exploitation of these staples led to the creation of institutions that defined the political culture of the nation and its regions. Innis, Influenced by the American historian Frederick Jackson Turner added a sociological dimension: different staples led to the emergence of regional economies (and societies) within Canada. For instance, the staple commodity in Atlantic Canada was cod fishing. This industry was very decentralized, but also very co-operative. In western Canada the central staple was wheat. Wheat farming was a very independent venture, which led to a history of distrust of government and corporations in that part of the country. (Also important, however, were the shocks caused by volatility in the market for wheat and by the weather itself on the growing season.) In Central Canada, the main staple was fur, and the fur trade dominated the economy for many years. This fur trade was controlled by large firms, such as the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and thus produced the much more centralized, business-oriented society that today characterizes Montreal and Toronto.

=== Core-periphery model ===

Innis depicted the relationship between regions of Canada as one of &quot;heartland&quot; to &quot;hinterland&quot;: The periphery, or hinterland, is dominated by the core, or heartland. Because the heartland was dependent upon the search for and accumulation of staples (which were located in the hinterland) to perpetuate the economy, it sought to gain economic and political power by exploiting the hinterland. Historians continue to use elements of the Innis model, applying it for example to British Columbia. That province&#x27;s economic structure exemplifies the &quot;core-periphery&quot; structure of intra-regional relationships. The core is metropolitan Vancouver, with its concentration of corporate management and transportation functions and manufacturing growth. It dominates an underdeveloped periphery that depends on production and export of staple commodities.

== Fur trade ==
The fur trade was key to the development of the Canadian interior. In Europe, hats from beaver pelts had become especially fashionable and valuable, and the forests of North America were home to many of the creatures.

This trade closely involved the Native peoples who would hunt the beavers and other animals and then sell their pelts to Europeans in exchange for guns, textiles, and luxury items like mirrors and beads. Those who traded with the Native were the &quot;voyageurs&quot;, woodsmen who travelled the length of North America to bring pelts to the ports of Montreal and Quebec City.

The French dominated the trade through the New France, the Ohio Valley, and west into what would be Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In an attempt to break the French monopoly the English began trading through Hudson Bay and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company built an elaborate network of trading posts and forts.

There was fierce rivalry between the French and English and their respective Native allies. Even when the two nations were at peace fierce fighting would occur in the interior.

The great disadvantage of the fur trade for the Canadians was that it did not encourage settlement. The fur trade only needed a few highly skilled workers. Also, the fur trade required more tonnage of goods to be shipped to North America than going the other way. This meant that there was no excess space on the westward voyage and passage costs were high. Unlike the United States where agriculture had become the primary industry, requiring a large labour force the population of what would be Canada remained very low.

This was a great benefit to the British in their struggles with the French. Over the course of the eighteenth century, the French possessions were gradually seized by the British until, in 1759, all of New France was conquered. The continued dependence on trade with Europe, also meant that the northern colonies were far more reluctant to join the American Revolution, and Canada thus remained loyal to the British crown.

== Population history ==

The population has grown steadily from a few thousand in the 1660s, to one million in the 1820s, 10 million in the 1920s, and 30 million in 2001. Accurate census data begins in 1851; the older numbers are estimates by historians.

== Timber ==

In the early nineteenth century timber became the dominant staple commodity. Timber for the domestic market had long been a small industry in the colonies, but it was changes in Europe in the early nineteenth century that created a large export market. Great Britain had exhausted its supplies of quality timber by the start of the eighteenth century. The great oaks that had built the Royal Navy were all but gone. The lack of very large trees that could supply great masts was especially problematic as they were a necessity for both its war and merchant shipping. A thriving timber importing business had thus developed between Britain and the Baltic region. This trade was very unpopular for both economic and strategic reasons.

For much of the eighteenth century, Britain had encouraged the timber trade with the New England colonies. The American stands of timber were primarily located along the small, but easily navigable rivers of New York and Massachusetts. These were fairly quickly exhausted. Even without the American Revolution new sources would have been needed by the start of the nineteenth century.

The Napoleonic Wars and the Continental blockade cut off, or at least reduced the Baltic trade so the British looked northwards to the colonies that had remained loyal and were still available. The industry became concentrated in three main regions. The first to be exploited was the Saint John River system. Trees in the still almost deserted hinterland of New Brunswick were cut and transported to Saint John where they were shipped to England. This area soon could not keep up with demand and the trade moved to the St. Lawrence River where logs were shipped to Quebec City before being sent on to Europe. This area also proved insufficient and the trade expanded westward, most notably to the Ottawa River system, which, by 1845, provided three-quarters of the timber shipped from Quebec City. The timber trade became a massive business. In one summer, 1200 ships were loaded with timber at Quebec City alone, and it became by far British North America&#x27;s most important commodity. it was from the money made in timber that the Bank of Montreal was founded in 1817.

The cutting of the timber was done by small groups of men in isolated camps. For most of the nineteenth century, the most common product was square timber, which was a log that had been cut into a square block in the forest before being shipped. The timber was transported from the hinterlands to the major markets by assembling it into a raft and floating it downstream. Because of the narrower and more turbulent waters that one would encounter on the Ottawa River system, smaller rafts, known as &quot;cribs,&quot; were employed. On the St. Lawrence, however, very large rafts, some up a third of a mile in length would be employed. The most common type of tree harvested was white pine, mostly because it floated well. Oak, which does not float, was in high demand but was much harder to transport and oak timbers needed to be carefully integrated into the raft if they were to be carried to market.

In 1842, the British preferential tariffs were lifted; however, the transatlantic trade still remained a profitable one. Demand in Britain remained high, especially for railway ties. Improved ships and new technologies, especially the steam engine, allowed the trade to continue to prosper. After the middle of the century the trade in timber began to decline, being replaced by trade in cut lumber and the pulp and paper industry.

One of the most important side effects of the timber trade was immigration to British North America. Timber is a very bulky and not a particularly valuable cargo. For every ship full of British manufactured goods, dozens would be needed to carry the same value of timber. There was no cargo coming from the British Isles to Canada that could take up as much room on the return voyage. Exporting salt filled a few ships, and some vessels were even filled with bricks, but many timber ships made the westward voyage filled with ballast. The population of Canada was small and the lack of wealth in the area made it an unattractive market.

There was, however, one cargo that the ship-owners did not have to worry about finding a market for in the sparsely populated New World: people. Many of the timber ships turned to carrying immigrants for the return voyage from the British Isles to fill this unused capacity. Timber ships would unload their cargo and sell passage to those desiring to emigrate. During the early nineteenth century, with the preferential tariff in full effect, the timber ships were among the oldest and most dilapidated in the British merchant fleet, and travelling as a passenger upon them was extremely unpleasant and dangerous. It was, however, very cheap. Since timber exports would peak at the same time as conflicts in Europe, such as the Napoleonic Wars, a great mass of refugees sought this cheap passage across the Atlantic.

In later decades after the repeal of the tariff and the increase of competition, the quality and safety of the ships improved markedly. Since the travellers would bring along their own food and bedding the trade was an extremely easy one to operate. All that was required was a few advertisements, generally in Irish newspapers, and the installation of bunks along the side of the hold. An average timber ship could thus carry about 200 passengers. Even with only a fraction of the hundreds of timber ships carrying passengers, this created an unprecedented influx of new inhabitants. By comparison, it has been calculated that the trade between New France and Europe only included an average sixty-six immigrants per year over the lifetime of that colony.

The timber trade did not only bring immigrants to British North America, it also played a very important role in keeping them there as well. While many of those disembarking from the timber ships would head south to the United States, many others would stay in British North America. In large part, this was because of the employment that could be found in the timber trade. At the peak of the trade in the 1840s, 15,000 Irish loggers were employed in the Gatineau region alone. This when it had been only a few years before that the population of Montreal was only ten thousand. Similar situations could be found in the other centres of the timber trade.

=== Historiography ===
Historian Robert Gillis, has emphasized the strong interest of lumber men in long-term conservation of the natural resources they were harvesting. However he points out that most historians present a much more negative interpretation:
:The prevailing attitude in Canadian historiography towards the lumber man is a mixture of maudlin romanticism and harsh, vitriolic condemnation. Along with most other businessmen the lumber operator is pictured as a crass, yet colourful, grasping individualist dedicated to the proposition of &quot;laissez faire&quot;. This approach, which might be called the &#x27;robber baron&#x27; interpretation of the forest industry, was first adopted by A.R.M. Lower in &quot;The North American Assault on the Canadian Forest&quot; (1938). Lower stresses the instability and transitory nature of lumbering, condemns its wastefulness, praises the early efforts at conservation and by calling the lumber men &#x27;buccaneers.&#x27;

=== Upper Canada ===

The timber industry also created large peripheral industries, the most important of these being agriculture. Unlike the fur trade, the timber trade saw large numbers of men in one location for a substantial period of time. The lumber camps, and the lumber towns needed to be supplied with food and other provisions. In the early years of the trade, much of the food, mostly barrels of pork, was shipped from the United States. Mostly coming from around the Cleveland area, shipping costs were high, creating a market for locally produced goods. As the loggers pushed ever westwards, farmers followed to take advantage of this captive market. Some of these farms failed after the loggers moved on, but many found new markets and became permanent settlements. This process formed the basis of many communities in what is now Ontario.

To encourage the settlement of the best land in the region, the government created the Canada Company. It was given much of the land in Western Ontario and Southwestern Ontario and tasked with selling it off to immigrants. It was successful in this, but it also became deeply unpopular for its monopolization of the land. This was an important trigger of the 1837 rebellions.

== Capitalism and finance ==

Capitalism, which would become the dominant philosophy for Canadian economic development, evolved from the economic activity of the colonial business elite. One of the most important manifestations of this ideology was the creation of an indigenous financial system. One of Canada&#x27;s first banks, the Canada Banking Company was founded in Montreal in 1792. This was followed by others including the Bank of Montreal, in 1817, the Bank of New Brunswick in 1820 and the Bank of Upper Canada in 1821. By 1886, 38 banks had been chartered. The pace of this financial activity was marked by the newly formed Government of Canada with the passing of the &quot;Bank Act&quot; in 1871. Insurance companies, including, Sun Life, 1865, Mutual Life, 1870, Confederation Life, 1871 and London Life, 1874, were also founded during these years. Markets for the exchange of investments came to Canada as well, with the establishment of the Montreal Stock Exchange in 1832, the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1861 and the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange in 1904. The repeal of the Corn Laws by the Parliament of Britain in 1846, terminated colonial trading preferences and marked the symbolic end of mercantilism in Canada while ushering in the new era of capitalism.

== Canals ==

To aid settlement and the timber trade, the nineteenth century saw a spree of canal building projects across the region. Canals could not only bypass rapids and falls, but they could connect previously unlinked parts of the river system. They also made transport of goods far easier and safer. Canals were created for the timber trade, the transport of wheat, and also for military reasons.

The construction of the Rideau Canal was one of the first projects in Upper Canada to employ thousands of laborers. It was under the control of the British military. The British officers and the contractors they hired both looked at the workers as instruments of production required to facilitate the most economic completion of the project. Because of the shortage of jobs, labourers had little choice but to endure difficult and often dangerous working and living conditions. The response of workers to these harsh conditions was militant but sporadic. They tended to act against individual property owners and contractors in order to obtain the immediate necessities for survival. More concerted activity was discouraged in large part by the military which posted soldiers along the line of the canal to suppress dissent and ensure a cheap supply of labour.

Canals such as the Rideau Canal, the Welland Canal, the Trent–Severn Waterway were massive engineering projects, and huge expenditures. The government of Upper Canada was bankrupted by these projects, and this was an important factor in the merging of Upper Canada with the still solvent Lower Canada into one colony in 1840.

== Railways ==

The national government strongly supported railway construction for political goals. First, it wanted to knit the far-flung provinces together. Second, it wanted to maximize trade within Canada and minimize trade with the United States to avoid becoming an economic satellite. The Grand Trunk Railway of Canada linked Toronto and Montreal in 1853. Lines to Portland in Maine (which was ice-free), Michigan and Chicago, were subsequently opened. By 1870 it was the longest railway in the world.

The Intercolonial Railway, finished in 1876, linked the Maritimes to Quebec and Ontario, tying them to the new Confederation. Entrepreneurs in Montreal sought direct lines into the U.S. and shunned connections with the Maritimes, with a goal of competing with American railroad lines heading west to the Pacific. Joseph Howe, Charles Tupper, and other Nova Scotia leaders used the rhetoric of a &quot;civilizing mission&quot; centered on their British heritage, because Atlantic-centered railway projects promised to make Halifax the eastern terminus of an intercolonial railway system tied to London. Leonard Tilley, New Brunswick&#x27;s most ardent railway promoter, championed the cause of &quot;economic progress&quot;, stressing that Atlantic Canadians needed to pursue the most cost-effective transportation connections possible if they wanted to expand their influence beyond local markets. Advocating an intercolonial connection to Canada, and a western extension into larger American markets in Maine and beyond, New Brunswick entrepreneurs promoted ties to the United States first, connections with Halifax second, and routes into central Canada last. Thus metropolitan rivalries between Montreal, Halifax, and Saint John led Canada to build more railway lines per capita than any other industrializing nation, even though it lacked capital resources, and had too little freight and passenger traffic to allow the systems to turn a profit.

Saint John was cut off by the Confederation promise of an Intercolonial Railway. E B Chandler, of New Brunswick&#x27;s north shore, saw to it that the rail line went from ice-bound Montreal along the St. Lawrence and down the North Shore of New Brunswick bringing New Brunswick no benefit except at Moncton. From there the distance to Halifax and Saint John were about equal. So even though Saint John was half as far from Montreal as Halifax, the new federal policy helped Halifax outpace Saint John as the winter port for Canada. When the St. Lawrence opened in the 1950s, yet another Federal government policy killed the port of Saint John. Eventually a rail line was built from Saint John through Maine USA to Montreal. However, Montreal businessmen preferred Portland USA even though the Saint John River Valley, with no rail line, was a shorter route from Quebec. So Canadian Prairie wheat was shipped four months of the year through the port of Portland, Maine, USA. Saint John has dwindled from being the fifth-largest city in Canada at Confederation to the fourth largest city in Atlantic Canada now and 32nd largest city in Canada.

Den Otter (1997) challenges popular assumptions that Canada built transcontinental railways because it feared the annexationist schemes of aggressive Americans. Instead Canada overbuilt railroads because it hoped to compete with, even overtake Americans in the race for continental riches. It downplayed the more realistic Maritimes-based London-oriented connections and turned to utopian prospects for the farmlands and minerals of the west. The result was closer ties between north and south, symbolized by the Grand Trunk&#x27;s expansion into the American Midwest. These economic links promoted trade, commerce, and the flow of ideas between the two countries, integrating Canada into a North American economy and culture by 1880. About 700,000 Canadians migrated to the U.S. in the late 19th century. The Canadian Pacific, paralleling the American border, opened a vital link to British Canada, and stimulated settlement of the Prairies. The CP was affiliated with James J. Hill&#x27;s American railways, and opened even more connections to the south. The connections were two-way, as thousands of American moved to the Prairies after their own frontier had closed.

Two additional transcontinental lines were built to the west coast—three in all—but that was far more than the traffic would bear, making the system simply too expensive. One after another, the federal government was forced to take over the lines and cover their deficits. In 1923 the government merged the Grand Trunk, Grand Trunk Pacific, Canadian Northern and National Transcontinental lines into the new Canadian National Railways system. Since most of the equipment was imported from Britain or the U.S., and most of the products carried were from farms, mines or forests, there was little stimulation to domestic manufacturing. On the other hand, the railways were essential to the growth of the wheat regions in the Prairies, and to the expansion of coal mining, lumbering, and paper making. Improvements to the St. Lawrence waterway system continued apace, and many short lines were built to river ports.

== Confederation ==

The repeal of the British Corn Laws and of preferential treatment for the British colonies led many in British North America to realize that the motherland could no longer be counted on economically. In 1854, the Canadian colonies signed Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty with the United States to try to ensure access to the American market. This treaty was cancelled in 1866, however, leaving the colonies once again adrift.

The railways were also an important factor. The Province of Canada had again nearly bankrupted itself by promising unwise subsidies to railway companies. The Maritime colonies wanted a railroad, but as disunited as they were, building one would be all but impossible.

Both the Maritime colonies and the Province of Canada desired access to the large and unexploited western hinterland. They hoped that if these areas were developed they would become a market for their manufactured goods, and provide exports for the eastern ports.

For these reasons and others, the colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and the two Canadas agreed to merge into one federation in 1867. While in name it was a confederation, the new constitution, the &quot;British North America Act&quot; outlined a strongly centralized federation. The federal government had control of most of the taxation power, and was responsible for the largest expenditures, railroads, canals and the military. The provinces were given exclusive jurisdiction over what at the time seemed merely local or minor matters such as health care and education. The pledge to build the Intercolonial Railway of Canada linking the Maritimes to Quebec and Ontario was finally realized in the 1870s.

In 1871, British Columbia, which was nearing bankruptcy due to railway construction agreed to join the union in exchange for a transcontinental railroad. Prince Edward Island joined in 1873 when the national government provided $800,000 for buying out the landlords who held large blocks of island land. All private holdings over 1,000 acres were sold to the province.

== The National Policy ==

The first Prime Minister of the new nation was John A. Macdonald, and he outlined what would be Canada&#x27;s economic program for decades. This would be the National Policy a system of protective tariffs that would encourage the development of Canadian manufacturing. This would be combined with great railway building projects such as the Canadian Pacific Railway to link the east with the west and the Intercolonial Railway to link central Canada with Atlantic Canada. Other plans for the National Policy were the promotion of Canadian Identity and the population of western Canada.

Canada had traditionally been committed to free trade and had only had one experiment with a protective tariff with the Cayley-Galt Tariff of 1858. This policy has long been controversial as it is seen to have favoured Central Canada at the expense of the Maritimes and the West.

Beginning in 1897, the National Policy included tariff preferences for imports from Britain, and these margins of preference were widened in 1898 and 1900. According to one study, Canada&#x27;s adoption of imperial preference had the effect of substantially reorienting Canadian imports toward Britain at a time when the United States was competing more intensely in the Canadian market.

== Post-Confederation slump ==

In the years after Confederation, the once-buoyant BNA economy soured, an event some blamed on union or government railway policy, but was more likely caused by the Long Depression that was affecting the entire world. Demand for Canadian resources slumped, and protectionist policies in the United States and Europe hurt Canada&#x27;s trade.

There was little immigration to Canada during this period. Despite efforts to settle the west including the &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; of 1872, few immigrants were willing to settle on Canada&#x27;s colder and drier prairies when open land was still plentiful in the United States. In the thirty years after Confederation, Canada experienced a net out flow of migrants, as a large number of Canadians relocated to the United States.

In the early part of the nineteenth century, the economies of the Canadian Maritimes were the most industrialized, and prosperous in British North America. The 1850s and 1860s were especially prosperous. By the start of the twentieth century, however, they were far poorer than the rest of the country, and remain so to this day. It has been said that the provinces never emerged from the post-Confederation slump. See Economy of the Maritimes for a full discussion of this issue.

== Boom years ==

The economy of the rest of the country improved dramatically after 1896, and from that year until 1914, Canada had the world&#x27;s fastest-growing economy. The west was settled, the population grew quickly, so that by 1900, Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier could predict that the twentieth century would be Canada&#x27;s century as the nineteenth was the United States&#x27;s.
The cause of this boom is debated. Whether the settlement of the west was a cause or effect of the boom is one of the most important issues. Globally the economy was improving with the end of the Long Depression. The last semi-humid farmland in the United States was exhausted, leaving Canada with the best unexploited farm land in North America. Technological changes from the steel plow to combine harvesters played an important role, but perhaps the most important development was the practice of dry farming that allowed farmers to profitably grow wheat on the semi-arid southern prairies.

The most noted expansion was in western Canada, but at the same time Central Canada was undergoing a period of significant industrialization.

While western and central Canada boomed during the pre-World War I years the economies of the three Maritime provinces grew far more slowly. There is also much debate over the cause of this, but its consequence was a growing disaffection with Confederation in the east, manifested by the Maritime Rights movement.

== Farming ==
=== Ontario ===
In Ontario farming was generally quite profitable, especially after 1896. The major changes involved &quot;mechanization of technology and a shift toward output of high-grade consumer oriented products&quot;, such as milk, eggs and vegetables for the fast-growing urban markets. It took farmers a half century to appreciate the value of high-protein soybean crops. Introduced in the 1890s, acceptance was slow until 1943–52, when farmers in the southwestern counties expanded production. Farmers increasingly demanded more information on the best farming techniques. Their demands led to farm magazine and agricultural fairs. In 1868 the assembly created an agricultural museum, which morphed into the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph in 1874.

=== Prairies ===

Wheat was the golden crop that built the economy of the Prairie provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta and filled outbound trains headed for ports to carry the grain to Europe. The tall grain elevator alongside the railway tracks became a crucial element of the Prairie grain trade after 1890. It boosted &quot;King Wheat&quot; to regional dominance by integrating the region&#x27;s economy with the rest of Canada. Used to efficiently load grain into railroad cars, grain elevators came to be clustered in &quot;lines&quot; and their ownership tended to concentrate in the hands of increasingly fewer companies, many controlled by Americans. The main commercial entities involved in the trade were the Canadian Pacific Railway and the powerful grain syndicates. Dramatic changes in the grain trade took place in the 1940s, notably the amalgamation of grain elevator companies. By the 1870s Saskatchewan was the center, followed by Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario, as the spread of railway lines allowed easy exports to Britain. By 1910 wheat made up 22% of Canada&#x27;s exports, rising to 25% in 1930 despite the sharp decline in prices during the worldwide Great Depression.

Norrie argues that the necessity of using dry farming techniques created special risks and the farmers responded by using summer fallow rather than the risky but more productive use of substitute crops or the planting of wheat every year. Tenants often preferred the safety of sharecropping to the hazards (and higher returns) of cash rental, and showed an interest in crop insurance. Because farmers were averse to risk, grain production was less than it might have been.

Recklessness, greed, and overoptimism played a part in the early-20th-century financial crisis on the Canadian wheat frontier. Beginning in 1916, the Palliser Triangle, a semiarid region in Alberta and Saskatchewan, suffered a decade of dry years and crop failures that culminated in financial ruin for many of the region&#x27;s wheat farmers. Overconfidence on the part of farmers, financiers, the Canadian Pacific, and the Canadian government led to land investments and development in the Palliser on an unprecedented and dangerous scale. A large share of this expansion was funded by mortgage and loan companies in Britain eager to make overseas investments. British money managers were driven by a complex set of global economic forces including a decline in British investment opportunities, excess capital, and massive investment expansion on the Canadian frontier. Reduced grain production in Europe and increased grain production in the Prairie Provinces also encouraged the export of capital from London. The mythical image of the Palliser as an abundant region, coupled with a growing confidence in technology, created a false sense of security and stability. Between 1908 and 1913 British firms lent vast sums to Canadian farmers to plant their wheat crops; only when the drought began in 1916 did it become clear that far too much credit had been extended.

== The First World War and the Roaring Twenties ==

Canada played an extraordinarily large role in the First World War relative to the size of its population. It sent over hundreds of thousands of troops, and was also the granary and arms producer for the allied side. This led to a further boom on the prairies as wheat prices skyrocketed. The rest of the country, even the Maritimes, benefited from an increase in manufacturing.

The immediate post-war years saw a short, but severe, recession as the economy readjusted to the end of wartime production. By 1921, the Canadian economy was back on its feet and rapidly expanding. In the 1920s, there was an unprecedented increase in the standard of living as items that had been luxury goods such as radios, automobiles, and electric lights—not to mention flush toilets—became common place across the nation. The boom lasted until 1929.

== The Great Depression ==
Canada was hard hit by the Great Depression. When the American economy began to collapse in the late 1920s the close economic links and the central banking system meant that the malaise quickly spread across the border. The world demand fell for wheat, lumber and mining products; prices fell, profits plunged, and unemployment soared.

In May 1930, US raised the tariff with the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act. Canada retaliated by imposing new tariffs on 16 products that accounted altogether for around 30% of U.S. exports to Canada. Following Britain&#x27;s lead, Canada then forged closer economic links with the British Empire via the British Empire Economic Conference (Ottawa Conference) of 1932 by establishing a zone of limited tariffs within the Empire but high tariffs towards states outside of the Empire. According to a 2024 study, the impact of the agreement on Canada was limited, as Canada already had a highly protectionist trade policy.

By 1933, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance. Wages fell as did prices; debts did not fall and they became more burdensome. Gross National Expenditure had declined 42% from the 1929 levels. In some areas, the decline was far worse. In the rural areas of the prairies two-thirds of the population were on relief. Population growth contracted markedly as immigration slowed, and birth rates fell as people postponed marriage and family life until they were more secure. Crime rates increased, and a new class of unemployed vagrants appeared.

Canada remained in depression far longer than the United States, not passing 1929 levels until 1939, with the outbreak of the Second World War. There was no national recovery program similar to Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal.

== The Second World War and the boom years ==
The turn around brought about by the command economy imposed at the beginning of the Second World War was immense. Unemployment virtually disappeared by 1940 as soldiers were recruited and factories turned to war production. Canada was in the unusual situation of helping Britain financially, through a program similar to the American Lend-Lease.

In the twenty-five years after the war, there was an immense expansion in the Canadian economy. Unemployment remained low and the end of wartime production was quickly turned over to making consumer goods. Canada, along with many other developed nations, firmly established itself as a welfare state with publicly funded health care, the Canada Pension Plan, and other programs.

During this period, the Canadian economy became much more closely integrated with the American one as tariff barriers fell and trade agreements like the Canada-United States Automotive Agreement and the &quot;Hyde Park Declaration&quot; were signed.

== Trade unions==
Canada&#x27;s first trade union, the Labourers&#x27; Benevolent Association (now International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association Local 273), formed in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1849. The union was formed when Saint John&#x27;s longshoremen banded together to lobby for regular pay and a shorter workday. Canadian unionism had early ties with Britain and Ireland. Tradesmen who came from Britain brought traditions of the British trade union movement, and many British unions had branches in Canada. Canadian unionism&#x27;s ties with the United States eventually replaced those with Britain.

Collective bargaining was first recognized in 1945, after the strike by the United Auto Workers at the General Motors&#x27; plant in Oshawa, Ontario.
Justice Ivan Rand issued a landmark legal decision after the strike in Windsor, Ontario, involving 17,000 Ford workers. He granted the union the compulsory check-off of union dues. Rand ruled that all workers in a bargaining unit benefit from a union-negotiated contract. Therefore, he reasoned they must pay union dues, although they do not have to join the union.

The post-World War II era also saw an increased pattern of unionization in the public service. Teachers, nurses, social workers, professors and cultural workers (those employed in museums, orchestras and art galleries) all sought private-sector collective bargaining rights. The Canadian Labour Congress was founded in 1956 as the national trade union center for Canada.

In the 1970s the federal government came under intense pressures to curtail labour cost and inflation. In 1975, the Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau introduced mandatory price and wage controls. Under the new law, wages increases were monitored and those ruled to be unacceptably high were rolled back by the government.

Pressures on unions continued into the 1980s and &#x27;90s. Private sector unions faced plant closures in many manufacturing industries and demands to reduce wages and increase productivity. Public sector unions came under attack by federal and provincial governments as they attempted to reduce spending, reduce taxes and balance budgets. Legislation was introduced in many jurisdictions reversing union collective bargaining rights, and many jobs were lost to contractors.

Prominent domestic unions in Canada include ACTRA, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, the Public Service Alliance of Canada, the National Union of Public and General Employees, and Unifor. International unions active in Canada include the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, United Automobile Workers, United Food and Commercial Workers, and United Steelworkers.

== Recent years ==

=== Recession ===

Canada experienced economic recession in the early 1980s and again in the early 1990s. This led to massive government deficits, high unemployment, and general disaffection. The poor economy helped lead to the overwhelming rejection of the
Progressive Conservative Party in the 1993 election, and the fall of other governments such as Bob Rae&#x27;s Ontario New Democratic Party. The poor economy may have increased support for sovereignty in Quebec, an option that was just barely rejected in the 1995 Quebec referendum.

A brief recovery in 1994 was followed by an economic slump in 1995–1996. Since that date, the Canadian economy has improved markedly, in step with the boom in the United States. In the mid-1990s, Jean Chrétien&#x27;s Liberal government began to post annual budgetary surpluses, and steadily paid down the national debt. Once referred to as a fiscal basket-case, Canada has become a model of fiscal stability as the government has posted surpluses every fiscal year from 1996 to the 2008 recession.

The recession brought on in the United States by the collapse of the dot-com bubble beginning in 2000, hurt the Toronto Stock Exchange but has affected Canada only mildly. It is one of the few times Canada has avoided following the United States into a recession.

Following this downturn, Canadian economic growth has been concentrated in the petroleum, real estate and income trust sectors.

The 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession resulted in a significant rise in unemployment in Canada.

Canada&#x27;s federal debt was estimated to total $566.7 billion for the fiscal year 2010–11, up from $463.7 billion in 2008–09. In addition, Canada&#x27;s net foreign debt rose by $41 billion to $194 billion in the first quarter of 2010. However, Canada&#x27;s regulated banking sector (comparatively conservative among G7 nations), the federal government&#x27;s pre-crisis budgetary surpluses, and its long-term policies of lowering the national debt, resulted in a less severe recession compared to other G8 nations. , the Canadian economy has largely stabilized and has seen a modest return to growth, although the country remains troubled by volatile oil prices, sensitivity to the Eurozone crisis and higher-than-normal unemployment rates. The federal government and many Canadian industries have also started to expand trade with emerging Asian markets, in an attempt to diversify exports; Asia is now Canada&#x27;s second-largest export market after the United States. Widely debated oil pipeline proposals, in particular, are hoped to increase exports of Canadian oil reserves to China.

=== Healthcare system ===
Canada&#x27;s healthcare system, colloquially called &quot;Medicare&quot;, is a significant economic factor. As most aspects of the healthcare system are financed from general government revenues, and as provincial governments bear the majority of these costs, healthcare has grown to become the largest component of Canadian provincial budgets. Medicare is also a relevant factor in the decisions of employers to locate businesses in Canada (where government pays most of employees&#x27; healthcare costs) as opposed to the United States (where employers more directly pay many healthcare costs).

=== Poverty ===
Poverty in Canada remains a prevalent issue within some segments of society. The most frequently quoted measure, the low-income cut off or LICO, displays a downward trend since 2000 after a spike in the mid-1990s and was 10.8% as of 2005. Another measure, published by the free market think tank Fraser Institute, displays a constant downward trend since 1970 and stood at 4.9% as of 2004. There is a debate about which measure is more valid.

== GDP history ==
Despite similarities in history, law and culture, Australia and Canada followed quite different macroeconomic histories. Australia&#x27;s GDP per caput was well above those of Britain and the United States in 1870, and more than twice the Canadian level. By the 1980s, however, Canada&#x27;s GDP almost matched the United States, and was well above that of Australia and Britain.

The following table displays the change in real GDP from the previous year, from 2000 to 2011:

<text>Expeditus (died 303), also known as Expedite, was said to have been a Roman centurion in Armenia who was martyred around April 303 in what is now Turkey, for converting to Christianity. Considered the patron saint of urgent causes, he is also known as the saint of time; he was commemorated by the Catholic Church on 19 April.

== Hagiography ==
Information concerning Expeditus is found in the &quot;Hieronymian Martyrology&quot;, where he appears as one of six Roman soldiers said to have been executed at Melitene during the Diocletianic Persecution. If he was stationed at Melitene at the beginning of the fourth century, he would likely have been a member of the Legio XII Fulminata.

His cult was already developed in Turin, Italy, in the Middle Ages. Given that &quot;Expeditus&quot; is Latin for a soldier without marching pack, i.e. a soldier with light equipment, this saint may be an anonymous individual known by his profession. He was mentioned briefly in 1675 in the &quot;Acta sanctorum&quot; volume for April. Expeditus was included in martyrologies in Italy before 1781. 

==Historicity==
According to hagiographical scholar Hippolyte Delehaye, the word &quot;Expeditus&quot; is a misreading of &quot;Elpidius&quot;. His name was struck off the list of martyrs by Pope Pius X in 1905, and his image was banned from churches, without success. 

==Legends ==
According to tradition, Expeditus was a Roman centurion in Armenia who became a Christian and was beheaded during the Diocletian Persecution in AD 303. The day he decided to become a Christian, the Devil took the form of a crow (a snake in some versions of the legend) and told him to defer his conversion until the next day. Expeditus stamped on the bird and killed it, declaring, &quot;I&#x27;ll be a Christian today!&quot;

Various stories circulated about the origin of the &quot;cultus&quot; of Expeditus. One states that it began when a package marked &quot;expedite&quot; (meaning &#x27;be ready&#x27; or alternately &#x27;loosen&#x27;) arrived with unidentified relics or statues. The recipients assumed that the statuary or relics belonged to an Expeditus, and so veneration began. Such an account is set in France in 1781. A case containing the relics of a saint, who was formerly buried in the Denfert-Rochereau catacombs of Paris, was delivered at a convent in the city. The senders had written &quot;expédit&quot; on the case, to ensure fast delivery of the remains. The nuns assumed that &quot;Expédit&quot; was the name of a martyr, and prayed for his intercession. When their prayers were answered, veneration spread rapidly through France and on to other Roman Catholic countries.

Another version of the story takes place in New Orleans, Louisiana, which was strongly influenced by French Catholic culture through the colonial period. This account says that Our Lady of Guadalupe Chapel (New Orleans) received a large shipment of statues of various saints, and that one case lacked an identifying label. It was labeled &quot;Expedite&quot; (&quot;Expédit&quot; in French), so the residents assumed that must be the saint&#x27;s name. The church has a statue of Expéditus, who still figures prominently in Louisiana Creole folklore and is revered through amulets, flowers, candles, and intercessory prayers.

== Veneration ==
His feast of April 19 is widely celebrated. Expedite is venerated in Europe and strongly in Latin America. Brazil has ceremonies in São Paulo and crowds attending ceremonies to mark his April 19 feast day can reach in the hundreds of thousands. St Expedite is also venerated by Orthodox Christians being a pre-schism saint.

==Patronage==
At first, he was invoked for urgent causes. In 1781 Pope Pius VI proclaimed him protector of merchants and seafarers, There was a tradition that Expeditus could be called upon to help settle overly long legal cases. Expeditus is the patron saint of Acireale, Sicily.

=== Iconographical depiction ===
Expeditus&#x27; typical depiction in artwork is as a young Roman centurion. The soldier is squashing a crow beneath his right foot and bearing a clock in early images. Later depictions have Expeditus holding a cross, inscribed with the Latin word &quot;hodie&quot; (&quot;today&quot;). A banderole with the word &quot;cras&quot; (&quot;tomorrow&quot; in Latin) emerges from the crow&#x27;s mouth.

==Cultus==
=== Churches===
* Buenos Aires, Argentina

=== Chile===
Veneration in Chile is said to have begun when a devotee of Expeditus (or locally in Spanish, &quot;San Expedito&quot;) brought an image of him to Viña del Mar, one of the most popular beach cities of Chile. She petitioned some local priests for help to have a small church built for him. It is said that local authorities initially rejected the idea, but the priests and the devout lady prayed to Expeditus, and in less than nine days they had the approval. Since then, the cult of San Expedito has become increasingly popular in Chile; from rich to poor, people pray novenas to him. The shrine in the Reñaca sector of Viña is a rather popular pilgrimage site, especially during summer.

&quot;Himnos mil al glorioso Expedito,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;que su sangre en la Armenia vertió,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;cuyo nombre en el cielo fue escrito,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;y de mártir el laurel alcanzó.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
—Himno a San Expedito

&quot;A thousand hymns to glorious Expeditus,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Who shed his blood in Armenia,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Whose name was written in heaven,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;And gained the laurel of martyrdom.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
—Hymn to Saint Expeditus
=== Réunion Island ===
&quot;Expédit&quot; has a significant folk following on the French island of Réunion off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean. Stories about the origin of his veneration follow the typical formula: a mysterious parcel marked with &quot;expedit&quot; arrived as an aid to instill pious virtues in the people. Another version says that Expédit acquired his name through his help in placing vengeful curses. Decapitated statues of the saint are often found, the defacement inflicted in anger for a request not carried out, or in order to break an existing curse.

Road-side altars dedicated to Expédit can be as small as a box containing a small statue of the saint, or as large as a hut, containing multiple statues, candles, and flowers. In all cases, these altars are painted a bright red. Also common are ex-votos thanking Expédit for wishes granted and favors received.

In Réunion, the cult of Saint Expédit has been syncretic, associating him with goddess Kali, with Roman Catholicism absorbing other beliefs from Madagascar or India. Expédit is a popular saint, revered by Reunionnais regardless of age or religion. As the worship of Expédit is officially considered taboo, people do not generally visit the altars in the open. But, the altars are widespread on the island and obviously well-tended, showing that the cult is active.

<text>The rough-snouted giant gecko (Rhacodactylus trachyrhynchus), also known as the greater rough-snouted gecko or tough-snouted gecko, is a species of gecko found in New Caledonia.

== Description ==
The common name of the rough-snouted giant gecko refers to the enlarged scales that cover its snout. Other characteristics of this gecko include broad toes and a prehensile tail. the rough-snouted giant gecko has a mottled color pattern, generally a grayish-green to brown mixed with white. Its body length (BDL) is usually around , making it a large gecko species, with its tail being roughly the same length.

== Behavior and habitat ==
The rough-snouted giant gecko is a nocturnal species, hunting in the nighttime and taking shelter in the daytime. It lives in forests, mostly in tropical and subtropical climates but also in forests with evergreen trees. It exhibits ovoviviparity, causing it to have a lower reproductive rate than other species in its genus. Like all &quot;Rhacodactylus&quot; geckos, the rough-snouted giant gecko is an omnivore. Its diet consists mainly of insects and fruit, and can include as well small lizards and nestling birds and rodents.

== Distribution ==
The rough-snouted giant gecko lives only in several small areas in New Caledonia. Sparse populations are known from Province Sud and Province Nord, specifically in Ile des Pins and small parts of Grand Terre, the main island of New Caledonia. Its occupies a total of 149 km2 of land up to above sea level.

Although the exact population trend of the rough-snouted giant gecko is unknown, both its range and population size are declining for a number of reasons. Habitat loss is one of its major threats, specifically due to wildfires, larger animals such as pigs destroying its habitat, and humans clearing its forests in favor of farmland. In addition, rodents and cats were introduced to the area, which prey on the gecko; fire ants (i.e. &quot;Wasmannia auropunctata&quot;) are a danger as well. The species has also been collected and traded illegally in some areas, sometimes being used as a pet. Although some of the areas it lives in are protected, no conservation actions are taking place for the species. The decline of its population and its small distribution cause it to be listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and has been assessed as vulnerable by &quot;Endemia&quot;.

== Breeding ==
The rough-snouted giant gecko is the only &quot;Rhacodactylus&quot; gecko that gives live birth. It is sometimes seen in captivity and as an arboreal species, requires a vertically oriented terrarium. Males should be housed separately or as a part of a breeding pair or trio with females. Although males housed together will often fight, females are social and can be housed together.

== Taxonomy ==
The description of the species was published by José Vicente Barbosa du Bocage in 1873. A population assigned as a subspecies, originally described by George Boulenger in 1878 as species &quot;Chameleonurus trachycephalus&quot;, has been recognised as species &quot;Rhacodactylus trachycephalus&quot;.

<text>In statistics, the score (or informant) is the gradient of the log-likelihood function with respect to the parameter vector. Evaluated at a particular value of the parameter vector, the score indicates the steepness of the log-likelihood function and thereby the sensitivity to infinitesimal changes to the parameter values. If the log-likelihood function is continuous over the parameter space, the score will vanish at a local maximum or minimum; this fact is used in maximum likelihood estimation to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function.

Since the score is a function of the observations, which are subject to sampling error, it lends itself to a test statistic known as &quot;score test&quot; in which the parameter is held at a particular value. Further, the ratio of two likelihood functions evaluated at two distinct parameter values can be understood as a definite integral of the score function.

==Definition==

The score is the gradient (the vector of partial derivatives) of formula_1, the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, with respect to an m-dimensional parameter vector formula_2.
:formula_3
This differentiation yields a formula_4 row vector at each value of formula_5 and formula_6, and indicates the sensitivity of the likelihood (its derivative normalized by its value).

In older literature, &quot;linear score&quot; may refer to the score with respect to infinitesimal translation of a given density. This convention arises from a time when the primary parameter of interest was the mean or median of a distribution. In this case, the likelihood of an observation is given by a density of the form formula_7. The &quot;linear score&quot; is then defined as

:formula_8

==Properties==
===Mean===
While the score is a function of formula_2, it also depends on the observations formula_10 at which the likelihood function is evaluated, and in view of the random character of sampling one may take its expected value over the sample space. Under certain regularity conditions on the density functions of the random variables, the expected value of the score, evaluated at the true parameter value formula_2, is zero. To see this, rewrite the likelihood function formula_12 as a probability density function formula_13, and denote the sample space formula_14. Then:

:formula_15

The assumed regularity conditions allow the interchange of derivative and integral (see Leibniz integral rule), hence the above expression may be rewritten as

:formula_16

It is worth restating the above result in words: the expected value of the score, at true parameter value formula_2 is zero. Thus, if one were to repeatedly sample from some distribution, and repeatedly calculate the score, then the mean value of the scores would tend to zero asymptotically.

===Variance===

The variance of the score, formula_18, can be derived from the above expression for the expected value.
:formula_19
Hence the variance of the score is equal to the negative expected value of the Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood.
:formula_20
The latter is known as the Fisher information and is written formula_21. Note that the Fisher information is not a function of any particular observation, as the random variable formula_22 has been averaged out. This concept of information is useful when comparing two methods of observation of some random process.

==Examples==

===Bernoulli process===

Consider observing the first &quot;n&quot; trials of a Bernoulli process, and seeing that &quot;A&quot; of them are successes and the remaining &quot;B&quot; are failures, where the probability of success is &quot;θ&quot;.

Then the likelihood formula_12 is

:formula_24

so the score &quot;s&quot; is

:formula_25

We can now verify that the expectation of the score is zero. Noting that the expectation of &quot;A&quot; is &quot;nθ&quot; and the expectation of &quot;B&quot; is &quot;n&quot;(1 − &quot;θ&quot;) [recall that &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are random variables], we can see that the expectation of &quot;s&quot; is

:formula_26

We can also check the variance of formula_27. We know that &quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot; = &quot;n&quot; (so &quot;B&quot; = &quot;n&quot; − &quot;A&quot;) and the variance of &quot;A&quot; is &quot;nθ&quot;(1 − &quot;θ&quot;) so the variance of &quot;s&quot; is

:formula_28

===Binary outcome model===

For models with binary outcomes (&quot;Y&quot; = 1 or 0), the model can be scored with the logarithm of predictions

: formula_29

where &quot;p&quot; is the probability in the model to be estimated and &quot;S&quot; is the score.

==Applications==
===Scoring algorithm===

The scoring algorithm is an iterative method for numerically determining the maximum likelihood estimator.

===Score test===

Note that formula_27 is a function of formula_2 and the observation formula_10, so that, in general, it is not a statistic. However, in certain applications, such as the score test, the score is evaluated at a specific value of formula_2 (such as a null-hypothesis value), in which case the result is a statistic. Intuitively, if the restricted estimator is near the maximum of the likelihood function, the score should not differ from zero by more than sampling error. In 1948, C. R. Rao first proved that the square of the score divided by the information matrix follows an asymptotic χ2-distribution under the null hypothesis.

Further note that the likelihood-ratio test is given by
:formula_34
which means that the likelihood-ratio test can be understood as the area under the score function between formula_35 and formula_36.

==History==

The term &quot;score function&quot; may initially seem unrelated to its contemporary meaning, which centers around the derivative of the log-likelihood function in statistical models. This apparent discrepancy can be traced back to the term&#x27;s historical origins. The concept of the &quot;score function&quot; was first introduced by British statistician Ronald Fisher in his 1935 paper titled &quot;The Detection of Linkage with &#x27;Dominant&#x27; Abnormalities.&quot; Fisher employed the term in the context of genetic analysis, specifically for families where a parent had a dominant genetic abnormality. Over time, the application and meaning of the &quot;score function&quot; have evolved, diverging from its original context but retaining its foundational principles.

Fisher&#x27;s initial use of the term was in the context of analyzing genetic attributes in families with a parent possessing a genetic abnormality. He categorized the children of such parents into four classes based on two binary traits: whether they had inherited the abnormality or not, and their zygosity status as either homozygous or heterozygous. Fisher devised a method to assign each family a &quot;score,&quot; calculated based on the number of children falling into each of the four categories. This score was used to estimate what he referred to as the &quot;linkage parameter,&quot; which described the probability of the genetic abnormality being inherited. Fisher evaluated the efficacy of his scoring rule by comparing it with an alternative rule and against what he termed the &quot;ideal score.&quot; The ideal score was defined as the derivative of the logarithm of the sampling density, as mentioned on page 193 of his work.

The term &quot;score&quot; later evolved through subsequent research, notably expanding beyond the specific application in genetics that Fisher had initially addressed. Various authors adapted Fisher&#x27;s original methodology to more generalized statistical contexts. In these broader applications, the term &quot;score&quot; or &quot;efficient score&quot; started to refer more commonly to the derivative of the log-likelihood function of the statistical model in question. This conceptual expansion was significantly influenced by a 1948 paper by C. R. Rao, which introduced &quot;efficient score tests&quot; that employed the derivative of the log-likelihood function.

Thus, what began as a specialized term in the realm of genetic statistics has evolved to become a fundamental concept in broader statistical theory, often associated with the derivative of the log-likelihood function.

Set during the World War III scenario outlined in Sir John Hackett&#x27;s novel &quot;The Third World War: The Untold Story&quot;, the novel follows the titular United States Army armored company-sized team in combat against the Soviet Union after the Warsaw Pact invades Western Europe. While Hackett&#x27;s book emphasizes strategy and world politics, Coyle&#x27;s features the experiences of the tank crews and infantrymen fighting on the front lines.

&quot;Team Yankee&quot; was Coyle&#x27;s first novel, and its success made Coyle a prominent writer in the field of military fiction. The novel achieved best-selling status and inspired a series of comic books, an Origins Award-winning board wargame, and a video game. In 2015, it was adapted as a sister scenario for the &quot;Flames of War&quot; wargame.

==Plot==
Over the summer of an unspecified year, relations between the United States and the Soviet Union deteriorate rapidly, particularly in the Persian Gulf. By August, NATO forces are mobilized and moved to the Inner German border between West Germany and East Germany. Among the mobilized NATO forces is Team Yankee, an average U.S. Army armored team under First Battalion, 4th Armored Division. Captain Sean Bannon is the company commander, First Lieutenant Robert Uleski is the executive officer, and First Sergeant Raymond Harrert is the first sergeant. Team Yankee is composed of First Platoon (Lieutenant Murray Weiss), Second Platoon (Second Lieutenant McAllister), Third Platoon (Second Lieutenant Gerry Garger), and the Mech Platoon (Staff Sergeant Polgar). Each platoon has four M1 Abrams tanks for a total of ten across the team, as well as five M113 armored personnel carriers, two M901 ITV TOW missile vehicles, an M113A4 AMEV, and an M88 recovery vehicle. The Mech Platoon is also equipped for anti-tank warfare, armed with M47 Dragon anti-tank missiles and M72 LAW rocket launchers. When deployed to Germany under brigade commander Colonel Brunn and Major Jordan, Team Yankee is attached to Task Force 3-78 Mechanized Infantry, led by Lieutenant Colonel Reynolds and composed of Team Yankee, mech-heavy (one tank, two mech platoons) Team Bravo, standard infantry C Company (Captain Craven), standard infantry D Company, and an M981 FISTV-equipped artillery team (Second Lieutenant Rodney Unger).

On August 3, with the increasingly likely possibility of war, Bannon sends his wife Pat and their children to Rhein-Main Air Base to flee the country alongside other civilians, while also preparing to replace Garger for repeatedly troubling him. Suddenly, as Reynolds inspects TF 3-78&#x27;s positions, the Soviets attack, and Team Bravo&#x27;s company commander is killed. Team Yankee repels the attack, and Bannon notes Garger&#x27;s competence in combat. That evening, Pat and her children arrive at Rhein-Main and narrowly board an American aircraft as the Soviet Air Forces indiscriminately bomb fleeing civilians, while Bannon learns the staff are more enthusiastic about war than the soldiers who have actually seen combat.

The next day, Team Yankee attacks Hill 214, but receives conflicting orders from Reynolds and Jordan to attack and halt respectively. Bannon&#x27;s tank driver and Lt. McAllister, are killed, but Bannon and his surviving crew manage to destroy three T-62 tanks before destroying their crippled M1 Abrams to prevent its capture and commandeering Uleski&#x27;s tank. C Company, intended to support them, never arrives, forcing the team to defend Hill 214 throughout the night. Bannon&#x27;s loader, PFC Richard Kelp, assists Private McCauley and an anti-tank infantryman from the Mech Platoon into battle, but the gunner is killed, and Kelp and McCauley use his launcher to destroy a T-72 targeting them, earning Kelp a Silver Star.

The members of Team Yankee fall asleep and wake up several hours after they were expected to withdraw, and Bannon charts a way to return to U.S. lines in daylight with minimal casualties where, to Bannon&#x27;s fury, they find C Company, having apparently held there the entire time. Bannon reports to his superiors and Team Yankee is placed in reserve for reinforcing and recovery. Second Lt. Avery, an inexperienced Armor School classmate of Garger&#x27;s, reports as McAllister&#x27;s replacement, but finds himself isolated from his new comrades.

On August 8, Team Yankee&#x27;s brigade is ordered to follow up a Bundeswehr counterattack into East Germany through the Thuringian Forest towards Leipzig and Berlin to cut off the Soviet offensive against the Northern Army Group, and Team Yankee is ordered to lead the attack. Bannon however expresses doubts to Reynolds that the rest of the battalion, particularly C Company, can carry out their role in supporting the armor teams. The attack is delayed when the enemy, a Polish People&#x27;s Army T-55 battalion, launches its attack first, but the team repels them and Avery gets his first kill, forcing the Polish battalion to retreat. TF 3-78 stops to consolidate its gains, but the Polish battalion returns to attack C Company, prompting TF 3-78, assisted by a German company and American artillery, to respond in force and crush the Polish battalion. The Mech Platoon advances to secure the nearest town, but is attacked by a member of the Free German Youth, who is killed after wounding a soldier.

TF 3-78 sets up their headquarters in East Germany. Avery is wounded by a Soviet helicopter and his tank is damaged, but it is quickly salvaged as it is due back in combat the next day. Suddenly, the headquarters is attacked; several soldiers are wounded or killed, C Company is almost entirely wiped out, Reynolds is severely wounded, and Jordan is cut off from reaching the others. Bannon reorganizes TF 3-78 and leads a counterattack to repel the Soviets and rescue Jordan and the staff. TF 3-78, resuming activities under Jordan, coordinates an ambush against a Soviet battalion approaching their position and a town, using scout troops and area denial artillery munitions in a reverse slope defense to force them into Team Yankee&#x27;s lines.

By this point, NATO is running short on equipment and manpower, forcing major unit reorganizations to maintain the offensive, and Team Yankee is moved from TF 3-78 to TF 1-4 Armored, their original unit, to continue the advance to Leipzig and Berlin. Team Yankee is assigned a screening role to the main effort, and is ordered to conduct a feint attack against a bridge over the Saale River, but the speed of their attack and internal conflicts between the Soviet Army and the KGB allow the First Platoon to capture the bridge intact.

The next day, Bannon learns the Soviet Union has launched a nuclear attack on Birmingham, England, and that NATO has retaliated with a nuclear attack against Minsk, Belarus. TF 1-4 is ordered to prepare for nuclear warfare, CBRN defense, and the effects of nuclear war, and Bannon braces for a nuclear exchange. Suddenly, news comes in that the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact are collapsing and a ceasefire has been ordered. The ceasefire ultimately holds, ending the devastating war after only two months. A National Guard division relieves the 4th Armored Division, and Bannon returns to quarters to reconnect with Pat and their children.

==Adaptations==
===Board games===
* GDW Games published &quot;Team Yankee&quot; under license, authored by Frank Chadwick and Marc W. Miller, as a part of their &quot;First Battle&quot; series of wargames that shared the same basic rules. In the March 1989 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (issue #3), Ellis Simpson reviewed the game and was not impressed, giving it a poor rating of only 1 out of 5 and called it &quot;a turkey&quot;.
* While not directly based on the novel, the game &quot;World at War: Eisenbach Gap&quot; by Mark H. Walker is based on events and units as laid out in the &quot;Team Yankee&quot; book and John Hackett&#x27;s book &quot;The Third World War&quot;.

===Comic book===
First Comics published a six-issue comic book series based on &quot;Team Yankee&quot;, which was reissued as a graphic novel in 1989. David Drake wrote the strip.

===Video game===

In 1990, British video game developer Oxford Digital Enterprises developed &quot;Team Yankee&quot;, a computer wargame published by Empire Software for Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, and Commodore CDTV, following a premise and plotline based on the novel. The game received two sequels, &quot;Pacific Islands&quot; in 1992 and &quot;War in the Gulf&quot; in 1993, both unrelated to &quot;Team Yankee&quot;.

===Tabletop game===
In November 2015, the tabletop wargaming system &quot;Flames of War&quot; released the miniature based table-top game &quot;Team Yankee&quot;, inspired by both &quot;The Third World War&quot; and &quot;Team Yankee&quot; novels. It allows the player to build a Team Yankee, NATO, or Warsaw Pact force to play with. It also has missions based on those from the novel.

<doc id="598791" wikidata="Q7621756" url="?curid=598791" title="Strategery">
<text>The word &quot;strategery&quot; ( ) was used in a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch, written by James Downey, airing October 7, 2000, which satirized the performances of George W. Bush and Al Gore, two candidates for President of the United States, during the first presidential debate for election year 2000. Bush, played by Comedian Will Ferrell, when asked by a mock debate moderator to &quot;sum up, in a single word, the best argument for his candidacy&quot;, replied &quot;strategery&quot; (a mock-Bushism playing on the word &quot;strategy&quot;), satirizing Bush&#x27;s reputation for mispronouncing words. SNL later released the episode as part of a video tape titled &quot;Presidential Bash 2000&quot;.

==Becoming a Bush catchphrase==
After the 2000 presidential election, people inside the Bush White House reportedly began using the term as a joke, but it later became a term of art meaning the oversight of any activity by Bush&#x27;s political consultants. Bush&#x27;s strategists also came to be known within the White House as &quot;The Department of Strategery&quot;, or the &quot;Strategery Group&quot;.

Affectionately embracing satirical portrayals has been a Bush tactic at other times as well, such as when he presented a self-parodying slide show at the May 2004 Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner about looking for weapons of mass destruction in the Oval Office after the political comic strip &quot;Doonesbury&quot; satirically portrayed him on a similar comical search.

The term is now widely used in comic and popular discourse across the political spectrum. Rush Limbaugh picked up the usage soon after the &quot;SNL&quot; airing. A trial exhibit from the 2007 &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby trial included the term, in Libby&#x27;s daily schedule for June 10, 2003, which showed that Libby had a 6:00 pm &quot;Strategery Meeting&quot; scheduled to last 90 minutes. In a 2017 interview on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, Bush recalled a joke argument with &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s Lorne Michaels about whether an &quot;SNL&quot; writer or Bush himself had actually coined the term.

==Other uses==
Sarah Palin used the term in an interview with Bill O&#x27;Reilly on his television show. Speaking of Charles Krauthammer and his political contacts, Palin commented &quot;they&#x27;re meeting people and they&#x27;re doing their strategery&quot;.

The term is also a centerpiece of the fictitious firm Strategery Capital Management, LLC, a satirical website, which mocks the Treasury&#x27;s $700 billion &quot;Troubled Asset Rescue Plan&quot; (which itself is a spoof of the real-world Troubled Asset Relief Program, which Bush signed into law in 2008).

A White House reporter, during a September 29, 2009, press briefing, began a question for press secretary Robert Gibbs with &quot;From the standpoint of leverage or strategery...&quot; The question, about Iran, drew laughs and a quip from Gibbs.

Shepard Smith, on his evening news program &quot;The FOX Report with Shepard Smith&quot; on July 10, 2012, described London officials&#x27; quoted &quot;overall strategery&quot; in placing anti-aircraft missiles on apartment buildings during the London Olympics.

The official podcast of the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas is called, &quot;The Strategerist.&quot;

<text>The Asmara-Massawa Cableway was a cableway (or &quot;ropeway&quot;) built in Italian Eritrea before World War II. The Eritrean Ropeway, completed in 1937, ran 71.8 km from the south end of Asmara to the city-port of Massawa.

==History==

The cableway was built by the Italian engineering firm Ceretti and Tanfani S.A. in Eritrea. It connected the port of Massawa with the city of Italian Asmara and ran a distance of nearly 72 kilometres. It also moved food, supplies and war materials for the Imperial Italian Army, which had also conquered Ethiopia in 1936. In August 1936 the first section of 26.6 km was opened from Ghinda to Godaif, a suburb of Asmara.

With the capacity to transport 30 tons of material every hour in each direction from the seaport of Massawa to 2326 meters above sea level in Asmara, the cableway was the longest of its kind in the world when inaugurated in 1937. The bearing cables were in almost 30 sections, were powered by diesel engines, and carried freight in 1540 small transport gondolas. In southern Eritrea there was another small ropeway.

During their eleven-year military administration (1941-1952) of the former Italian colony, the British dismantled the installations. They removed the diesel engines, the steel cables, and other equipment as war reparations. Iron towers that remained were scrapped in the 1980s.

<text>Alkaliphiles are a class of extremophilic microbes capable of survival in alkaline (pH roughly 8.5–11) environments, growing optimally around a pH of 10. These bacteria can be further categorized as obligate alkaliphiles (those that require high pH to survive), facultative alkaliphiles (those able to survive in high pH, but also grow under normal conditions) and haloalkaliphiles (those that require high salt content to survive).

==Background information==

Microbial growth in alkaline conditions presents several complications to normal biochemical activity and reproduction, as high pH is detrimental to normal cellular processes. For example, alkalinity can lead to denaturation of DNA, instability of the plasma membrane and inactivation of cytosolic enzymes, as well as other unfavorable physiological changes. Thus, to adequately circumvent these obstacles, alkaliphiles must either possess specific cellular machinery that works best in the alkaline range, or they must have methods of acidifying the cytosol in relation to the extracellular environment. To determine which of the above possibilities an alkaliphile uses, experimentation has demonstrated that alkaliphilic enzymes possess relatively normal pH optimums. The determination that these enzymes function most efficiently near physiologically neutral pH ranges (about 7.5–8.5) was one of the primary steps in elucidating how alkaliphiles survive intensely basic environments. Since the cytosolic pH must remain nearly neutral, alkaliphiles must have one or more mechanisms of acidifying the cytosol when in the presence of a highly alkaline environment.

==Mechanisms of cytosolic acidification==
Alkaliphiles maintain cytosolic acidification through both passive and active means. In passive acidification, it has been proposed that cell walls contain acidic polymers composed of residues such as galacturonic acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and phosphoric acid. Together, these residues form an acidic matrix that helps protect the plasma membrane from alkaline conditions by preventing the entry of hydroxide ions, and allowing for the uptake of sodium and hydronium ions. In addition, the peptidoglycan in alkaliphilic &quot;B. subtilis&quot; has been observed to contain higher levels of hexosamines and amino acids as compared to its neutrophilic counterpart. When alkaliphiles lose these acidic residues in the form of induced mutations, it has been shown that their ability to grow in alkaline conditions is severely hindered. However, it is generally agreed upon that passive methods of cytosolic acidification are not sufficient to maintain an internal pH 2-2.3 levels below that of external pH; there must also be active forms of acidification. The most characterized method of active acidification is in the form of Na+/H+ antiporters. In this model, H+ ions are first extruded through the electron transport chain in respiring cells and to some extent through an ATPase in fermentative cells. This proton extrusion establishes a proton gradient that drives electrogenic antiporters—which drive intracellular Na+ out of the cell in exchange for a greater number of H+ ions, leading to the net accumulation of internal protons. This proton accumulation leads to a lowering of cytosolic pH. The expelled Na+ can be used for solute symport, which are necessary for cellular processes. It has been noted that Na+/H+ antiport is required for alkaliphilic growth, whereas either K+/H+ antiporters or Na+/H+ antiporters can be utilized by neutrophilic bacteria. If Na+/H+ antiporters are disabled through mutation or another means, the bacteria are rendered neutrophilic. The sodium required for this antiport system is the reason some alkaliphiles can only grow in saline environments.

==Differences in alkaliphilic ATP production==
In addition to the method of proton extrusion discussed above, it is believed that the general method of cellular respiration is different in obligate alkaliphiles as compared to neutrophiles. Generally, ATP production operates by establishing a proton gradient (greater H+ concentration outside the membrane) and a transmembrane electrical potential (with a positive charge outside the membrane). However, since alkaliphiles have a reversed pH gradient, it would seem that ATP production—which is based on a strong proton-motive force – would be severely reduced. However, the opposite is true. It has been proposed that while the pH gradient has been reversed, the transmembrane electrical potential is greatly increased. This increase in charge causes the production of greater amounts of ATP by each translocated proton when driven through an ATPase. Research in this area is ongoing.

==Applications and future research==
Alkaliphiles promise several interesting uses for biotechnology and future research. Alkaliphilic methods of regulating pH and producing ATP are of interest in the scientific community. However, perhaps the greatest area of interest from alkaliphiles lies in their enzymes: alkaline proteases; starch-degrading enzymes; cellulases; lipases; xylanases; pectinases; chitinases and their metabolites, including: 2-phenylamine; carotenoids; siderophores; cholic acid derivatives and organic acids. It is hoped that further research into alkaliphilic enzymes will allow scientists to harvest alkaliphiles&#x27; enzymes for use in basic conditions. Research aimed at discovering alkaliphile-produced antibiotics showed some success, yet has been held at bay by the fact that some products produced at high pH are unstable and unusable at a physiological pH range.

==Examples==
Examples of alkaliphiles include &quot;Halorhodospira halochloris&quot;, &quot;Natronomonas pharaonis&quot;, and &quot;Thiohalospira alkaliphila&quot;.
