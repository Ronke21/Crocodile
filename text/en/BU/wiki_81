<text>WGN (720 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station in Chicago, Illinois, featuring a talk radio format. WGN&#x27;s studios are in the Chicago Loop, while the transmitter is in Elk Grove Village. WGN also features broadcasts of Chicago Blackhawks hockey and Northwestern University football and basketball.

Since 2022, WGN is the only radio station owned by Nexstar Media Group, which primarily owns television stations (and is the largest owner of television stations in the U.S.). It was founded in 1922 as WDAP. In 1924 it was acquired by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, whose &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Newspaper&quot; slogan served as the basis for the WGN call sign, and later the call sign of a television superstation.

WGN is a clear channel, Class A station, broadcasting with the maximum power of 50,000 watts, and using a non-directional antenna. During daytime hours, near-perfect ground conductivity gives WGN at least secondary coverage to almost two-thirds of Illinois (as far south as Springfield) as well as large slices of Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan and Iowa. During nighttime skywave hours, with a good radio, it is audible over most of the Eastern and Central United States and Central Canada. The station also streams its programming on its website and supplies podcasts as well. WGN was previously responsible for the activation of the Chicago metropolitan area Emergency Alert System when hazardous weather alerts, disaster area declarations, and child abductions are issued; this is currently handled by WLS.

==History==
===WDAP===
The station first signed on the air on May 19, 1922, among the earliest stations in Chicago. It was randomly issued the call sign WDAP, from a sequential roster of available call signs, to Mid West Radio Central, Inc. This corporation was headed by Thorne Donnelley and Elliott Jenkins.

WDAP was originally located in the Wrigley Building. The studios were moved to the Drake Hotel the following July. In mid-1923 ownership was transferred to the Board of Trade, and the next year the Whitestone Company, managers of the Drake Hotel, took control.

===Chicago Tribune===
The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; acquired WDAP, and on June 1, 1924, the call sign was changed to WGN. The call letters came from &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Newspaper&quot;, a slogan used since 1911.

This was the second &quot;Tribune&quot;-affiliated radio station to hold the WGN call letters. The original WGN began operating on the evening of March 29, 1924, after the newspaper took over programming of the former WJAZ. The WGN call sign had been assigned to a Great Lakes vessel, &quot;SS Carl D. Bradley&quot;. However the ship&#x27;s skipper (and namesake) agreed to relinquish it in order to free it for adoption by the newspaper. The ship&#x27;s call sign was changed to KFSI.

===Shows and programming===
Early programming was noted for its creativity and innovation. It included live music, political debates, comedy routines, and some of radio&#x27;s first sporting event broadcasts, including the 1924 Indianapolis 500, and a live broadcast of the 1925 Scopes Trial from Dayton, Tennessee. Wallace M Rogerson conducted the Keep Fit to Music programme. In 1926, WGN broadcast &quot;Sam &amp; Henry&quot;, a daily serial with comic elements created and performed by Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll. After a dispute with the station in 1927, Gosden and Correll took the program&#x27;s concept and announcer Bill Hay across town to WMAQ and created the first syndicated radio show, &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;.

By the fall of 1928, the owners of the Tribune company and its sister publication, &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine, controlled two stations in addition to WGN in the Chicago area: WLIB and WTAS. On September 1, 1928, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) ruled that this was two stations too many, and ordered that their operations be consolidated. WTAS was deleted, and the other two stations were merged with a dual call letter assignment of WGN-WLIB, although the latter call sign would be rarely if ever used. On May 15, 1933, after the FRC requested that stations using only one of their assigned call letters drop those that were no longer in regular use, WLIB was eliminated and the station reverted to just WGN.

===CBS and Mutual Broadcasting System===

On November 1, 1931, WGN&#x27;s network affiliation changed from NBC to CBS as a result of NBC&#x27;s purchase of a half-interest in WMAQ, which then became Chicago&#x27;s NBC station. During this period, Count Cutelli installed one of the most advanced sound effects system to date into the WGN studios, the same system used in Hollywood films.

In 1934, WGN became a founding member of the Mutual Broadcasting System. WGN joined with WOR in New York City, WXYZ in Detroit and WLW in Cincinnati to form the network, a rival to NBC and CBS. During the &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;, Mutual was the home of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; and &quot;The Shadow&quot;. For many years, it was a national broadcaster for Major League Baseball, the National Football League and Notre Dame football.

In the fall of 1937, WGN was one of several Chicago radio stations to donate airtime to Chicago Public Schools for a pioneering program in which the school district provided elementary school students with distance education amid a polio outbreak-related school closure.

In 1939, Carole Mathews, the &quot;Miss Chicago&quot; of 1938, launched a WGN radio program entitled &quot;Breakfast Time with Carole Mathews&quot;. It ended later that year when she left the station for an acting career in Hollywood.

===FM and TV stations===
In May 1940, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced the establishment, effective January 1, 1941, of an FM radio band operating on 40 channels spanning 42–50 MHz. In July 1941, WGN was given tentative permission to operate FM station W59C on 45.9 MHz, pending the outcome of an FCC review whether newspaper ownership of radio stations should be restricted. Effective November 1, 1943, the FCC modified its policy for FM call signs, and the station&#x27;s call letters were changed to WGNB.

On June 27, 1945, the FCC announced the reassignment of the FM band to 80 channels from 88 to 106 MHz, which was soon expanded to 100 channels from 88 to 108 MHz. For most of its broadcasts on the new band, WGNB was located on 98.7 MHz. Its schedule was primarily a simulcast of the AM station, with some FM-only music shows broadcast as well. But with few people owning FM radio receivers in that era, management did not think WGNB would become profitable. Therefore, WGN, Inc. turned in WGNB&#x27;s license for cancellation, and the station was deleted on May 28, 1953. The next year another Chicago station, WFMT, moved to the vacated 98.7 assignment.

In 1946, the Tribune Company applied to the FCC for a construction permit to build a television station. On April 5, 1948, WGN-TV Channel 9 signed on the air. Because CBS, NBC and ABC had their own network stations in Chicago, WGN-TV became an independent television station, responsible for most of its own programming or airing old movies and syndicated TV shows.

===Change in ownership===
After McCormick died from pneumonia-related complications on April 1, 1955, ownership of WGN-AM-TV, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and the News Syndicate Company properties transferred to the McCormick-Patterson Trust, assigned to the Robert R. McCormick Tribune Foundation in the names of the non-familial heirs of McCormick (whose two marriages never produced any children) and familial heirs of Patterson. (The trust was dissolved in January 1975, with a majority of the trust&#x27;s former beneficiaries, including descendants of the McCormick and Patterson families, owning stock in the restructured Tribune Company entity – which assumed oversight of all properties previously overseen by the trust – afterward.)

In November 1958, WGN became the first radio station in Chicago to broadcast helicopter traffic reports featuring Police Officer Leonard Baldy. Flying Officer Baldy was killed in a helicopter crash, while on duty, on May 2, 1960. Eleven years later, WGN suffered another helicopter-related tragedy when Flying Officer Irv Hayden and his pilot were killed on August 10, 1971, after their helicopter struck a utility pole in the Chicago suburb of Bellwood.

===Move to North Center===
In 1961, the WGN radio and television stations moved to a studio facility on West Bradley Place in the North Center neighborhood, a move undertaken for civil defense concerns to provide the station a safe base to broadcast in case of a hostile attack targeting downtown Chicago. WGN radio moved back to North Michigan Avenue in 1986, relocating its operations to a studio in the Pioneer Court extension (WGN-TV remained at the Bradley Place facility, where that station operates to this day). The former WGN annex onto Tribune Tower is now used as a retail space containing Dylan&#x27;s Candy Bar.

Over many decades, WGN was a &quot;full service&quot; radio station. The station played small amounts of music during the mornings and afternoon hours, moderate amounts of music on weekends during the day, aired midday and evening talk shows, and sports among other features. The station aired middle of the road (MOR) music until the 1970s, when its switched to more of an adult contemporary-type sound. Music programming was phased out during the 1980s, and by 1990, the station&#x27;s lineup mainly consisted of talk shows.

===Past personalities===
Some former personalities on WGN include longtime morning hosts Wally Phillips, Bob Collins, Spike O&#x27;Dell, Paul Harvey and Roy Leonard. Orion Samuelson had been the station&#x27;s farm reporter since 1960, he retired in 2020. Late-night hosts over the years have included Franklyn MacCormack, Ed &quot;Chicago Eddie&quot; Schwartz, and the husband-and-wife team of Steve King and Johnnie Putman.

The Sousa Archives and Center for American Music at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign holds the WGN Radio Station Studio Orchestra Music Library and Records, 1925–1956, which consists of scripts, programs, production notes, correspondence, music library rental records, sheet music manuscripts, and music scores with annotations that document the WGN Studio Symphonic Orchestra from 1925 to 1956.

===Controversial management===
WGN continues to recover from the controversial rule of former Tribune head Randy Michaels, who resigned under pressure in 2010 amid allegations of inappropriate and sexist behavior in the workplace, and former WGN Program Director Kevin Metheny. Industry observers described Metheny&#x27;s tenure as one that nearly destroyed the venerable WGN, with staff moves that included replacing a popular evening host with radio rookie Jim Laski, a Chicago politician and convicted felon.

Metheny and Laski were both fired weeks after Michaels was forced to resign by a Tribune board of directors facing spiraling losses at the hands of Michaels&#x27; management style. In 2005, Tom Langmyer was appointed as vice president and general manager of WGN.

On April 30, 2008, the station entered into a three-year deal to broadcast Chicago Blackhawks hockey games through the 2010–2011 season.

===New ownership===
On April 1, 2007, Chicago-based real estate investor Sam Zell announced plans to purchase the Tribune Company in an $8.2-billion leveraged buyout that gave Tribune employees stock and effective ownership of the company. The transaction and concurring privatization of the company was completed upon termination of Tribune stock at the close of trading on December 20, 2007. Prior to the sale&#x27;s closure, WGN-TV was one of two commercial television stations in the Chicago market, not counting network-owned stations, to have never been involved in an ownership transaction (along with WCIU-TV, which has been owned by Weigel Broadcasting since its February 1964 sign-on). On December 8, 2008, Tribune filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing a debt load of around $13 billion – making it the largest media bankruptcy in American corporate history – that it accrued from the Zell buyout and related privatization costs as well as a sharp downturn in revenue from newspaper advertising. After a protracted four-year process, on December 31, 2012, Tribune formally exited from bankruptcy under the control of its senior debt holders, Oaktree Capital Management, JPMorgan Chase and Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co.

On July 10, 2013, Tribune announced plans to split off its broadcasting and newspaper interests into two separate companies. WGN-TV and WGN Radio would remain with the original entity, which was renamed Tribune Media and was restructured to focus on the company&#x27;s broadcasting, digital and real estate properties; the newspaper division – which, in addition to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, included publications such as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot; and the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; – was spun off into the standalone entity Tribune Publishing (known as Tronc from June 2016 until the company reverted to its former name in October 2018). The split was completed on August 4, 2014, ending the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s joint ownership with WGN-TV and WGN Radio after 66 and 94 years, respectively. However, WGN-TV continues to maintain a content partnership with the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

===Programming changes===
In October 2008, WGN-TV began to provide forecasts for WGN radio (prepared by Tom Skilling and other members of the sister television station&#x27;s weather staff), after it ended a ten-year forecast partnership with The Weather Channel. That year, morning host Spike O&#x27;Dell retired from radio; WGN then moved the station&#x27;s midday host at the time, John Williams to the morning slot. Williams&#x27; former timeslot, 1-4 p.m. was left vacant for several months, with the station&#x27;s other radio hosts filling in on a rotating basis – including weekend host Nick Digilio, and Bob Sirott, who formerly hosted &quot;The Noon Show&quot; on the same station, in addition to a weekend program that is pre-recorded with his wife, Marianne Murciano (Sirott was also a prominent news anchor at NBC owned-and-operated station WMAQ-TV, channel 5, and later at Fox-owned WFLD, channel 32).

In March 2009, longtime Chicago radio host Garry Meier was given an audition for the 1-4 p.m. slot. Meier hosted four shows, which is believed to have caused a surge in interest among younger people, who traditionally rarely listened to WGN. Chicago media message boards exploded with traffic and posts, many excited over a possible permanent Meier presence on the station. After the four Meier auditions, Jerry Springer was given a four-day stint as &quot;guest host&quot;, followed by Rita Cosby a few weeks later. On April 2, 2009, WGN announced that Meier would join the station full-time as host of a program in the 1-4 p.m. slot (airing most weekdays when the program is not pre-empted by Chicago Cubs broadcasts); his first official show occurred that same day. On May 22, 2009, WGN announced the cancellation of &quot;The Kathy and Judy Show&quot; effective after that day&#x27;s broadcast. The final show was largely a retrospective of the program&#x27;s 20 years on WGN radio; this occurred shortly after the replacement of much of the station&#x27;s weekend lineup.

On June 15, 2009, the station announced that Greg Jarrett would become its new morning-drive host starting on June 22, with John Williams being shifted to &quot;Kathy and Judy&quot;″s former late morning timeslot. In June 2010, WGN announced the hiring of longtime Cincinnati-based host Mike McConnell from WLW for the late morning (8:30 a.m.-12:30 pm) slot, shifting Williams back to his original midday time slot (now from 12:30-3:00 pm) on August 9, 2010.

Coinciding with the hire of Jarrett, WGN dropped its &quot;News/Talk 720&quot; brand and began identifying itself simply as &quot;Chicago&#x27;s WGN Radio 720&quot;. This new identity was implemented in all station promos, and used by all on-air talent. On August 13, 2010, the station&#x27;s branding changed again to &quot;News 720 WGN&quot;. In November, after the firing of controversial program director Kevin Metheny, Tom Langmyer instructed staff to identify the station as &quot;720 WGN&quot;. Weekend hosts Jerry Agar and the &quot;News Junkie&quot; Sean Wasson left the station, in a shift towards more general and less controversial talk programming.

On December 2, 2011, WGN announced that Jonathon Brandmeier was named the new morning drive time host, effective December 9. With Brandmeier&#x27;s addition to WGN radio&#x27;s weekday lineup, the morning drive timeslot shifted to 5:30-9 a.m., followed by Mike McConnell from 9 a.m.-12 p.m., John Williams from 12-3 p.m., and Garry Meier from 3-7 p.m. News anchor Steve Bertrand moved to mornings with Brandmeier and Jim Gudas shifted to the midday/afternoon slot. Former morning host Greg Jarrett was released from the station. Overnight hosts Steve King and Johnnie Putman left WGN on December 9 after a week-long series of live &quot;Farewell Celebration&quot; shows. Bill Leff took over the midnight to 5:30 a.m. slot on December 12. 2011.

In 2012, John Williams announced his departure from the station upon the December 31 expiration of his contract (leaving on December 21, 2012), to concentrate exclusively on his program on WCCO in Minneapolis instead of splitting time between stations. In October 2012, then back into Tribune Tower in October 2012. On December 17, 2012, WGN Radio executives announced that the long-running program &quot;Extension 720&quot;, hosted by Dr. Milton J. Rosenberg, would end its 39-year run three days later on December 20.
In June 2013, Tribune Broadcasting CEO Larry Wert hired Jimmy DeCastro as WGN radio&#x27;s president and general manager. In addition, Bob Sirott and Marianne Murciano&#x27;s program moved to the weekday lineup and Steve Cochran was announced to be returning to WGN. The changes are an attempt to shift WGN closer to the programming format it had prior to Kevin Metheney and Randy Michaels&#x27; tenure with WGN and Tribune, while placing more emphasis on new media; this included the move of Mike McConnell&#x27;s program to the station&#x27;s secondary Internet radio station WGN Plus (formerly WGN-2) until the remainder of his contract was bought out around October 10, 2013, the move of Jonathon Brandmeier&#x27;s morning show to a new station branded &quot;The G&quot; (subsequently rebranded as an additional Internet-only station, &quot;WGN.FM&quot;) in favor of Cochran, and increased synergy with WGN-TV (including the replacement of WGN radio&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Chicago&quot; slogan with WGN-TV&#x27;s longtime slogan, &quot;Chicago&#x27;s Very Own&quot;). On May 21, WGN Radio announced that their schedule would change again effective May 27, 2014, which included the return of John Williams to the station; he would host his program from Minneapolis, where he continued to do an afternoon show for WCCO. His time slot announced was 10:00 a.m. to noon, which moved then mid morning hosts Bill Leff and Wendy Snyder to the afternoon drive from 3:00-7:00 pm. Garry Meier would be moved to WGN.FM, with Steve Cochran&#x27;s morning show getting expended by 1 hour, and Bob Sirott and Marianne Murciano still having their noon-3:00 p.m. show.

===Chicago Cubs leave WGN===
On June 5, 2014, the Chicago Cubs announced that radio broadcasts of its games would move from WGN to WBBM for the 2015 season under a seven-year deal. The deal ended the team&#x27;s 90-year association with WGN.

On November 20, 2014, Chicago media blogger Robert Feder reported that WGN management planned to end operation of both WGWG-LP and internet station WGN.FM on December 31, 2014. Jonathan Brandmeier and Garry Meier were released and their programs canceled immediately, with repeat shows airing through the end of December. While Brandmeier was reportedly not under contract with Tribune Media at the time of his release, Meier&#x27;s contract with Tribune continued through September 2015.

On December 31, 2014, the WGN.FM website was redirected to the WGN Plus website, where Tribune offers various digital media content. WGWG-LP began an interim simulcast of WGN radio at 10 p.m. on December 31, 2014. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that the simulcast would continue through January 2015, after which Chicago-based Weigel Broadcasting was expected to assume operation of 87.7 FM; Weigel eventually began programming what is now WRME-LD on February 23, 2015.

On October 5, 2016, Jimmy DeCastro announced he was planning to leave WGN at the end of the month. He told Robert Feder &quot;I&#x27;ve done everything I can to respect and build on the legacy of this amazing place, and I believe I accomplished everything I set out to do.&quot; At the time of his leaving he had spent 3 years serving as the President and general manager of WGN. His last day at WGN was October 31. He said he plans to focus on The Content Factory, his Evanston-based national syndication and new media company, and to expand into the area of sports representation. Larry Wert has said he has not decided on naming a successor to DeCastro, so for now the sales and programming operations will report directly to Wert.

On July 25, 2017, it was reported that WGN would leave Tribune Tower in 2018 and relocate to a new studio and office across the Chicago River. The station began using its new studios on Wacker Drive for news reports in May 2018, with the final show originating from Tribune Tower on June 18, 2018.

===Chicago White Sox broadcasts===
On February 14, 2018, WGN was named the new flagship station of the Chicago White Sox, who were left without a station after Cumulus Media voided their contract to air on WLS as part of their Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The agreement was for three years, and the team moved to WMVP in the 2022 season.

===Acquisition of Tribune by Nexstar===
Tribune Media was acquired by Nexstar Media Group for $4.1 billion in September 2019, marking the first time since 1924 that WGN radio would not be owned by any iteration of the Tribune Company. The sale made WGN the only radio property owned by Nexstar, which primarily owns television stations; in an interview with &quot;Crain&#x27;s Chicago Business&quot; in December 2018, shortly after the deal was announced, Nexstar CEO Perry Sook stated that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction to radio&quot; and that there were no immediate plans to sell WGN radio, adding that he did not expect Nexstar to acquire additional radio stations.

Under Nexstar, several changes were made to the station&#x27;s lineup, management, and branding. Bob Sirott was hired to replace Steve Cochran during morning drive hours, longtime mid-day duo Bill Leff and Wendy Snyder were ousted, and at a later date, evening host Justin Kaufmann was let go as well. These staffing changes were made over the course of months after Sean Compton began to oversee radio operations as Nexstar&#x27;s Executive Vice President of WGN America, WGN Radio &amp; Director of Content Acquisition. Morning producer Mary Boyle was appointed general manager of the station after former Station Manager Todd Manley was terminated on the first day of Nexstar&#x27;s takeover. Veteran Chicago News Anchor Bill Kurtis was replaced in his role as voiceover talent by New York-based voiceover artist Steve Kamer. Similarly, new radio jingles from JAM Creative Productions and sister company PAMS of Dallas were introduced to the station. Cuts from JAM jingle packages &quot;Top News, Talktrax, Talking Points, Non-Stop Power, You&#x27;ll Like Our Style, Follow The Leader&quot;, &quot;Variety Pack&quot;, &quot;Nothing But Class&quot;, &quot;Ameritalk&quot;, and (rarely) &quot;The Only One&quot; are regularly featured in station identifications, sounders, and promotions. WGN also dropped hourly news updates from ABC News Radio and instead is supplying national news updates for WGN America&#x27;s national newscast, &quot;NewsNation&quot; with WGN newscasters and audio from Nexstar-owned television stations.

==Programming==
Local hosts on WGN include morning host Bob Sirott along with John Williams, John Records Landecker, and Rollye James.

WGN is one of the few talk stations in the U.S. to broadcast all local talk shows during the day and evening. In recent years, it has added some nationally syndicated talk shows at night. Monday through Friday, it carries &quot;The Other Side of Midnight with Frank Morano&quot; from Red Apple Media during late night hours. On Sundays it runs &quot;Sunday Night Live with Bill Cunningham&quot; from WLW in Cincinnati. WGN was the longtime Chicago outlet for Paul Harvey from 1951 until his death on February 28, 2009. Harvey&#x27;s news and commentary shows were carried nationally by ABC Radio, although he was based in Chicago and the programs aired locally on WGN.

WGN airs local news headlines, weather forecasts supplied by WGN-TV, traffic reports and sports headlines every half-hour on weekdays, and every hour nights and weekends. Also during weekdays, the radio station simulcasts the first two hours of the &quot;WGN Morning News&quot;. The station used ABC News Radio for national news reports as the network&#x27;s Chicago affiliate. On September 1, 2020, WGN Radio dropped ABC News Radio in favor of being an &quot;audio news hub&quot; for the co-owned &quot;NewsNation&quot; TV channel.

===Sports teams===
WGN serves as the flagship radio outlet for Chicago Blackhawks hockey, Northwestern Wildcats football, and Northwestern Wildcats men&#x27;s basketball. For the 2018 and 2019 seasons, WGN was the flagship station for Chicago White Sox baseball. WLS previously had the contract to carry the White Sox, but its parent company, Cumulus Media, ran into financial problems and gave up the rights to White Sox broadcasts. With the 2020 season, WMVP became the White Sox flagship radio outlet. As of 2024, WGN continues to air overflow White Sox games if the Chicago Bears are playing on WMVP.

WGN had a long association with the MLB Chicago Cubs from 1925 to 2014, the last 56 years of that period as the exclusive flagship station. Following the 2014 season, Cubs radio broadcasts moved to WBBM. (They are currently heard on WSCR, co-owned with WBBM.)

Shortly after Nexstar took control of WGN, the station began to broadcast national NFL play-by-play on Sunday afternoons from Compass Media Networks.

== Broadcast coverage ==
WGN (AM) transmits a non-directional signal from a 195° (longer than half-wave) 740-foot tower in Elk Grove Village. Its daytime signal stretches across five states: Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan. At night its signal spreads north to Hudson Bay, south to the Gulf of Mexico, west to Colorado, and east to the Atlantic Ocean.

<doc id="605275" wikidata="Q4871598" url="?curid=605275" title="Battle of Longewala">
<text>The Battle of Longewala (4–7 December 1971) was one of the first major engagements in the western sector during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, fought between assaulting Pakistani forces and Indian defenders at the Indian border post of Longewala, in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan. The battle was fought between 120 Indian soldiers accompanied by four Hawker Hunter and three HAL Marut fighter-bombers and 2,000–7,000 Pakistani soldiers accompanied by 30–100 tanks.

A company of the Indian Army&#x27;s 23rd Battalion, Punjab Regiment, commanded by Major Kuldip Singh Chandpuri an Indian Army officer, was left with the choice of either attempting to hold out until reinforced, or fleeing on foot from a Pakistani mechanized infantry force. Choosing the former, Chandpuri ensured that all his assets were correctly deployed and made the best use of his strong defensive position, as well as weaknesses created by errors in enemy tactics. He was also fortunate that an Indian Air Force forward air controller was able to secure and direct aircraft in support of the post&#x27;s defence until reinforcements arrived six hours later.

The Pakistani commanders made several questionable decisions, including a failure of their strategic intelligence to foresee the availability of Indian fighter-bombers in the Longewala area, exercising operational mobility with little or no route reconnaissance, and conducting a tactical frontal assault with no engineer reconnaissance. That led to the Pakistani brigade group being left extremely vulnerable to air attack and vehicles becoming bogged in terrain unsuitable for the movement of armoured vehicles, as they tried to deploy off a single track and were more susceptible to enemy fire since they used external fuel storage in tactical combat and attempted to execute a night attack over unfamiliar terrain, and infantry was surprised by obstacles to troop movement, which caused confusion and stalling the attack during the crucial hours of darkness, when the assaulting infantry still had a measure of concealment from Indian small arms and infantry support weapon fire.

== Background ==
The main thrust of the Indian Army during the 1971 war was directed towards the eastern theatre, with the western sector envisioned as a holding operation to prevent the Pakistan Army from achieving any success that would allow the President of Pakistan, Yahya Khan, any bargaining tool to trade against the captured territories in the east. By the last week of November 1971, the Indian Army had launched offensive manoeuvres at Atgram against Pakistani border posts and communications centres along the eastern border. The Mukti Bahini also launched an offensive against Jessore at this time. It was clear to Islamabad by this time that open conflict was inevitable, and that East Pakistan was indefensible in the long run. Yahya Khan chose at this point to try to protect Pakistan&#x27;s integrity and to hold India by Ayub Khan&#x27;s strategy—&quot;The defence of East Pakistan lies in the West&quot;.

== Prelude ==
=== The Western sector ===

Khan&#x27;s policy made the assumption that an open conflict with India would not last long due to international pressure, and that since East Pakistan was undefendable, the war effort should be concentrated on occupying as much Indian territory as possible as a bargaining tool at the negotiating table. The initial plans for the offensive called for at least temporary air dominance by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) under which Khan&#x27;s troops could conduct a lightning campaign deep into Western India before digging in and consolidating their positions. The PAF launched pre-emptive strikes on the evening of 3 December that led to the formal commencement of hostilities in the western theatre. The city of Rahim Yar Khan, close to the international border, formed a critical communication centre for Khan&#x27;s forces and, situated on the Sindh–Punjab railway, remained a vulnerable link in Khan&#x27;s logistics. The fall of Rahim Yar Khan to Indian forces would cut off the railway as well as road link between Sindh and West Punjab, starving Khan&#x27;s forces of fuel and ammunition delivered to Karachi.

Indian battle plans called for a strike by the 12th Indian Division across the border towards Islamgarh through Sarkari Tala, subsequently advancing through Baghla to secure Rahim Yar Khan. This would destabilise the Pakistani defences in the Punjab and Jammu &amp; Kashmir Sector, allowing the planned Indian offensive in the Shakargarh sector to sweep the Pakistani forces trapped there.

Pakistan, which envisaged the Punjab as an operational centre, had a strong intelligence network in the area and planned to counter its own comparatively weak strength on the ground with a pre-emptive strike through Kishangarh towards the divisional headquarters south of Ramgarh. Longewala, which was originally a Border Security Force (BSF) post but was later taken over by a company of the Punjab Regiment prior to the war, formed a strategic point en route to capturing vast tracts of land and also a pivotal theatre of war in engaging India on the western front.

=== Tactical plan ===
Pakistan&#x27;s tactical plan was based on the assumption that an attack in the area would help their 1st Armoured Division&#x27;s task in the Sri Ganganagar area. Pakistan High command also felt that it was important to protect the north–south road link which they felt was vulnerable, as it was close to the border. A combined arms plan was decided upon. This involved two infantry brigades and two armoured regiments. A separate division, the 18th Division, was formed for this purpose. The 18th Division&#x27;s operation orders required one infantry brigade (206th) with an armoured regiment (38th Cavalry) to capture and establish a firm base at Longewala, a junction on the Indian road system, and the 51st Infantry Brigade and the 22nd Cavalry (Pakistan Army Armoured Corps) to operate beyond Longewala to capture Jaisalmer.

The Pakistani plan was to reach Longewala, Ramgarh and Jaisalmer. The plan was far-fetched from the start, if only because it called for a night attack to be conducted over terrain that was not preceded by route or engineer reconnaissance, and the armoured troops were therefore unaware the ground could not support rapid movement towards the objective. As the day unfolded, Longewala would stand out as one of the biggest losses for Pakistan, despite overwhelming superiority before commencement of the battle, largely due to the vehicles becoming bogged down in soft sand.

=== Indian defensive planning ===
On the Indian side, the post was held by A Company, 23rd Battalion, Punjab Regiment, led by Major Kuldip Singh Chandpuri, the defences occupying a high sand dune which dominated the area that was largely intractable to vehicles. The post was surrounded by a barbed wire fence of three strands. The rest of the battalion was located at Sadhewala, to the north-east. Chandpuri commanded an infantry company reinforced by a section each of medium machine guns (MMGs) and L16 81mm mortars, and one Jonga-mounted M40 recoilless rifle (RCL). His two other recoilless rifle teams of the anti-tank section were under training at battalion headquarters. Chandpuri also had under his command a four-man team of the camel Border Security Force division.

The Longewala post had no armoured vehicles, but artillery support was available from a battery of the 170 Field Regiment, tasked with direct support of the battalion, and the 168 Field Regiment, which had been deployed to the area in secrecy just a day earlier. The direct support battery was attached to the 168 Field Regiment and served as its &quot;Sierra&quot; Battery. Immediately after PAF strikes on Indian airfields on 3 December, Chandpuri dispatched a 20-man-strong patrol under Second Lieutenant Dharam Veer to Boundary Pillar (BP) 638, on the border. This patrol was to play an important part in detecting the advances of Pakistani forces.

== Battle ==

During the night of the 4th, Dharam Veer&#x27;s platoon, while on a patrol, detected noises across the border that suggested a large number of armoured vehicles approaching. These were soon confirmed by reports—from the Army&#x27;s air observation post aircraft flown by Major Atma Singh—in the area of a armoured column on the track leading to the post advancing in the general direction of the Longewala post. Directing Dharam Veer Bhakri&#x27;s patrol to trail the advancing armoured column, Chandpuri contacted battalion headquarters, requesting urgent reinforcements and armour and artillery support. Battalion headquarters gave him the choice of staying put and containing the attack as much as possible, or carrying out a tactical retreat to Ramgarh, as reinforcements would not be available that night. Despite his command having all the transportation to retreat back on time, he chose to stay and fight back the advancing enemy.
The Pakistani forces began their attack at 12:30 am. As the offensive approached the lone outpost, Pakistani artillery opened up across the border with medium artillery, killing five of the ten camels from the BSF detachment. As the column of 45 tanks neared the post, Indian defences, lacking the time to lay a prepared minefield, laid a hasty anti-tank minefield as the enemy advanced, one infantryman being killed in the process. The Indian infantry held their fire until the leading Pakistani tanks had approached to within before firing their PIATs. They accounted for the first two tanks on the track with their Jonga-mounted 106 mm M40 recoilless rifle, with one of its crew being killed during the engagement. This weapon proved quite effective because it was able to engage the thinner top armour of the Pakistani tanks from its elevated position, firing at often stationary, bogged-down vehicles. 

In all, the post defenders claimed 12 tanks destroyed or damaged. The initial Pakistani attack stalled almost immediately when the infantry discovered the barbed wire which had not been spotted in the night, and interpreted it as signifying a minefield. Firing for the Indian RCL crews was made easier by the flames of fires when the spare fuel tanks on the Pakistani tanks, intended to supplement their internal capacity for the advance to Jaisalmer, exploded, providing ample light for Indians located on higher ground, and creating a dense, acrid smoke screen at ground level for the Pakistani infantry, adding to the confusion. Two hours were lost as Pakistani sappers were brought up, only to discover there was no minefield. However, at this time, Pakistani infantry were required to make another attack, from a different direction, but in the dawn light. The Pakistani advance then attempted to surround the post two hours later by vehicles getting off the road, but many vehicles, particularly armoured personnel carriers and tanks, in trying to soften up the Indian defenders before attacking, became bogged down in the soft sand of the area surrounding the post. Throughout the engagement, Chandpuri continued to direct the supporting artillery fire.

Although massively outnumbering the Indian defenders and having surrounded them, the Pakistani troops were unable to advance over open terrain on a full-moon night, under small arms and mortar fire from the outpost. This encouraged the Indians not to give up their strong defensive position, frustrating the Pakistani commanders. As dawn arrived, the Pakistan forces had still not taken the post, and were now faced with doing so in full daylight.

In the morning, the Indian Air Force was finally able to direct the newly assembled 122 Squadron under the command of WC Donald Melvyn Conquest comprising HAL HF-24 Maruts and Hawker Hunter aircraft to assist the post; they were not outfitted with night-vision equipment, and so had to wait until dawn. With daylight, however, the IAF was able to operate effectively, with the strike aircraft being guided to targets by the airborne Forward Air Controller (FAC), Singh, in a HAL Krishak observation aircraft. The Indian aircraft attacked the Pakistani ground troops with 16 Matra T-10 rockets and 30 mm ADEN cannons on each aircraft. Without support from the Pakistan Air Force, which was busy elsewhere, the tanks and other armoured vehicles were easy targets for the IAF&#x27;s Hunters. The range of the 12.7 mm anti-aircraft heavy machine guns mounted on the tanks was limited and therefore ineffective against the Indian jets. Indian air attacks were made easier by the barren terrain. Many IAF officers later described the attack as a &quot;turkey shoot&quot;, signifying the lopsidedness.

By noon the next day, the assault had ended completely, having cost Pakistan 36 tanks 22 of which were destroyed by aircraft fire, 12 by ground anti-tank fire, and 2 captured after being abandoned, with a total of around 100 vehicles destroyed or damaged in the desert around the post. The Pakistani forces were forced to withdraw when Indian tanks from the division&#x27;s cavalry regiment, the 20th Lancers, commanded by Colonel Bawa Guruvachan Singh, along with the 17th Battalion, Rajputana Rifles, launched their counter-offensive to end the six-hour engagement. Longewala had proved to be one of the defining moments in the war.

== Aftermath ==
Since the Indians were on the defensive, they managed to inflict heavy losses on the Pakistanis: 200 soldiers killed, 36 tanks destroyed or abandoned, and 500 additional vehicles lost. The Pakistani judicial commission set up at the end of war recommended the commander of 18th Division, Major General Mustafa, be tried for negligence.

Notwithstanding the Indian victory, there were intelligence and strategic failures on both sides. India&#x27;s intelligence service failed to provide warning of such a large armoured force in the western sector. Moreover, the defending post was not heavily armed. Finally, they did not push home their advantage and destroy the fleeing Pakistani tanks while the IAF had them on the run. They did, however, destroy or capture some 36 tanks, one of the most disproportionate tank losses for one side in a single battle after World War II.

The Pakistani troops, meanwhile, had underestimated the post&#x27;s defensive capability due to the difficulty of approach over sand, conducting the attack at night and in full-moon light, against stiff resistance from a well-prepared defensive position located on a dominant height. Attacking with virtually no air cover, they took too long to close for an assault on the position, and failed to anticipate the availability of Indian close air support. Given that Pakistan&#x27;s Sherman tanks and T-59/Type 59 Chinese tanks were slow on the sandy Thar Desert, some military analysts have opined that the attack may have been poorly planned and executed, given the terrain. Some Pakistani tanks suffered engine failure due to overheating in trying to extricate themselves, and were abandoned. The open desert battleground provided little to no cover for the tanks and infantry from air attacks. The plan to capture Longewala may have been good in conception, but failed due to lack of air cover. As a result, two tank regiments failed to take Longewala.

For his part, the Indian company commander, Chandpuri, was decorated with India&#x27;s second-highest gallantry award – the Maha Vir Chakra. Several other awards were earned by members of the defending company and the battalion&#x27;s commander. On the other hand, the Pakistani divisional commander was dismissed from service.

British media reported on the defence of Longewala; James Hatter compared the Battle of Longewala to Battle of Thermopylae in his article &quot;Taking on the enemy at Longewala&quot;, describing it as the deciding moment of the 1971 war. Similarly, Field Marshal R. M. Carver, the Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom) at the time, visited Longewala a few weeks after the war to learn the details of the battle from Chandpuri.

In 2008, the battle was the subject of disagreement, some officers of the time ascribing all the combat success to the IAF. This led to Chandpuri suing for the token amount of one rupee.

== In popular culture ==
The Battle of Longewala was depicted in the 1997 Hindi film &quot;Border&quot;, which was directed by J. P. Dutta and starred Sunny Deol as Major Kuldeep Singh, Jackie Shroff as Wing Commander M.S. Bawa, Sunil Shetty as Assistant Commandant Bhairon Singh (BSF), and Akshaye Khanna as Dharam Veer. The main criticism of the movie was that it showed Indian forces being in a terrible position before any sort of help came from the IAF.

India has built the &quot;Longewala War Memorial&quot; at Longewala, and the &quot;Sadhewala War Memorial&quot; 15 km north-east of Longewala, which are part of Bharat Ranbhoomi Darshan initiative of the Indian Military which entails 77 battleground war memorials in border area including Siachen base camp, Kargil, Galwan, Pangong Tso, Rezang La, Doklam, Bum La, Cho La, Kibithu, etc. This will boost border tourism, patriotism, local infrastructure and economy while reversing civilian outward migration from these remote locations.

<text>Hans Matheson (born 7 August 1975) is a Scottish actor and musician. In a wide-ranging film and television career he has taken lead roles in diverse films such as &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, &quot;The Tudors&quot;, &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;, &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; and &quot;300: Rise of an Empire&quot;. In addition to acting, Matheson sings and plays guitar, violin and harmonica, and released an album of his songs in 2019.

==Biography==
Matheson was born in Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland. His parents were Sheena, a therapist, and Iain (Ado), a folk musician and painter. His late younger brother, William Matheson, was also an actor. The family soon moved to Kent, where he has since been based, though with regular visits back to the north of Scotland. He disliked school and prompted by his mother enrolled and studied at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, London.

His first screen appearance was as a youth being interviewed by the police in an episode of &quot;The Bill&quot; in 1995; he was then cast in other UK TV dramas before he made his feature film debut as Johnny Silver in Jez Butterworth&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Mojo&quot;. He had created the same role in the stage premiere at the Royal Court Theatre in July 1995. He followed the film &quot;Mojo&quot; with &quot;Stella Does Tricks&quot;, playing a young male prostitute hooked on drugs who befriends Stella, a 15 year old prostitute.

Matheson then played Marius in Bille August&#x27;s film version of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, appearing alongside Liam Neeson, Geoffrey Rush and Claire Danes, where he &quot;was determined to play him as a heartfelt revolutionary, demanding power for the people&quot;. When he went to New York it was the first time he had left the UK in what he described shortly after as &quot;an unbelievable turn of events&quot;. The same year, Matheson played guitar for the role of Luke Shand, a youthful rocker helping to invigorate an old band in the film &quot;Still Crazy&quot;.

He continued with a leading role in the British hit &quot;Tube Tales&quot;, which led to his first commercialized film, &quot;Bodywork&quot;, starring as a market trader framed for murder, with Beth Winslet, Charlotte Coleman, and Clive Russell. In 2000 he starred in &quot;Canone Inverso&quot; set in the 1930s, as Jeno Varga, a young man who falls in love with a pianist; he learnt the violin for this role. Following &quot;Canone Inverso&quot;, he played Mordred in the American TV film &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;. In his next film he played Tomas in the Norwegian-Danish feature &quot;I Am Dina&quot;, released in 2002, and based upon &quot;Dinas Bok&quot;.

Matheson, still relatively unknown, landed the central role of Yuri Zhivago in Giacomo Campiotti&#x27;s 2002 adaptation of Boris Pasternak&#x27;s novel, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; after a long search by its producers. The actor visited Pasternak&#x27;s niece in Oxford, and on reading some of the Russian poetry (in translation by his sister) was &quot;inspired beyond belief&quot;; and saw it as a &quot;great opportunity to play a wonderful character with such a huge range of emotions&quot;. Despite inevitable comparisons with the 1965 Lean film, his portrayal - &quot;intense, playful, assured and able to convey a very effective sense of trouble brewing&quot; was praised, and another critic commended the &quot;outstanding performances&quot;, noting how &quot;Matheson&#x27;s sunken eyes capture the toll Zhivago&#x27;s travails exact upon him, both spiritually and physically&quot;.

Matheson played a private in the trenches in the 2002 horror war film &quot;Deathwatch&quot;, then in early 2004 he starred as an alcoholic in rehab in the television docu-film &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, which he later described as &quot;his proudest role&quot;. While some critics objected to the mix of drama and documentary, and of professional and amateur actors, one described Matheson&#x27;s performance as &quot;as affecting as it was understated&quot;, adding &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen anyone command the small screen so effectively in a long time. In 2006, Matheson co-starred as a lighthouse-keeper who has a romance with murder mystery author Demi Moore in the film &quot;Half Light&quot;. He then portrayed the Earl of Essex in a BBC production about Queen Elizabeth I of England called &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot;, broadcast in the US in 2005 and the UK in 2006. For this role, he sought to emulate the swagger of Marc Bolan, listening a lot to Bolan and Kurt Cobain (for his aggression) in the dressing room; he added &quot;I really, really loved playing this character ...with Essex I felt I had to constantly come outside of my safety zone, which was very liberating for me&quot;. Another period drama followed when he appeared as Archbishop Thomas Cranmer in the second season of the Showtime series &quot;The Tudors&quot; in 2008.

The same year Matheson played Alec Stoke-d&#x27;Urberville, &quot;calculating and spoilt, but also friendly and charming&quot; in the four-part BBC adaptation of &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;. His was not the one-note villain, rather a damaged and misguided individual; &quot;I tried to find something in his story. I don&#x27;t think that he ever intended to hurt Tess and I think he believed he loved her, but in reality it was more of an obsession&quot;, Matheson commented later. The Thomas Hardy Society review found his Alec &quot;intelligently portrayed... an amoral, nouveau-riche, deracinated figure&quot;, while another critic added that the &quot;relationship between Tess and Alec is extremely well portrayed&quot;.

The following year he was the Home Secretary Lord Coward, alongside Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2009). Matheson then played Argive archer Ixas in the 2010 &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; remake.

Described in Sight and Sound as &quot;neatly but not lavishly mounted&quot; with Matheson &quot;at ease as the Doubting Thomas minister&quot;, he starred in &quot;The Christmas Candle&quot; as Reverend David Richmond. He considered the film more as a &quot;romantic comedy&quot;, and not a message of Christian faith, and was drawn to the idea of an authority figure, vicar, who humbly realises that there is much more for him to learn.

He had a supporting role as Aeschylus in &quot;300: Rise of an Empire&quot;, which required him to get fit in about ten weeks through hard-core training. In 2015 he was cast in the lead role of John Blackwood (Johnny Jackson) a &quot;flawed&quot; but &quot;lovable rogue&quot;, who is seeking redemption from actions committed in his past in the ITV series &quot;Jericho&quot;, which aired in January 2016 in the UK; but the drama was not continued after its first series.

==Approach to acting==
In an interview with the actor in 2015, Olivia Sharpe noted that he had often played the dark hero, and that getting &quot;into the psyche of a character and show their many facets is the mark of a great actor, which Hans undoubtedly is, although he modestly admits that there have been many roles he would sooner forget&quot;. Matheson admitted that he had occasionally taken jobs that weren&#x27;t his first choice in order to make ends meet. Time constraints when filming were a problem, &quot;you miss process; process is where results and creative things happen and you discover. The whole point of the job for me is discovering new things; that is what is exciting. If you are forced into a situation where you just have to come up with something, you will probably give something… not safe, but just something that you can rely on because there is just not the opportunity to explore together and try things&quot;. He acknowledged that he was occasionally nervous when performing, wishing that he could be in control of himself, adding that in acting one has to &quot;let go&quot; and that &quot;you can&#x27;t guarantee what happens&quot;. He also found that the best actors have difficulties with a poor script: &quot;My dad once asked me: &#x27;What is the most difficult thing about being an actor?&#x27; and I told him that it&#x27;s all about trying to make bad writing work. It&#x27;s quite humbling to realise that you&#x27;re only as good as the story you&#x27;re telling&quot;.

On two of his most important roles, Zhivago and Essex, he commented in 2014 &quot;When I played Zhivago, I thought I&#x27;m never going to play a character that&#x27;s going to give me so much to play with. I just loved it so much, the whole process from beginning to end, reading the book, everything. But then this has been the same. I can&#x27;t think of two more extreme characters than Zhivago and Essex so it&#x27;s going to be difficult to follow those&quot;.

An early interviewer noted that Matheson was ambivalent about becoming famous, and in 2002 he again expressed his concern at becoming &quot;a media face, someone who&#x27;s well known by people he doesn&#x27;t know&quot;. Seeing acting more as a vocation than a career, he stated that &quot;You&#x27;ve got to realise that it&#x27;s not everything, making films&quot;, and that what he does in his life should have some meaning to him, not just a way to pay the rent; &quot;...my music is really more essential to me for my soul&quot;. In 2013 he professed that despite the time pressures of filming his was &quot;a fun job. I don&#x27;t know how, but sometimes it seems that they squeeze every last moment, and it is a shame, as it would be a lot more fun&quot;.

<text>OS-tans are &quot;moe&quot; anthropomorphic personifications of popular operating systems, originating on the Japanese imageboard Futaba Channel. The designs of the OS-tans, which were created by various amateur Japanese artists, are typically female; for example, the personifications of Microsoft Windows operating systems are often depicted as sisters of varying ages. The &quot;-tan&quot; element in the term is a hypocoristic suffix in Japanese that implies extremely youthful endearment.

Though initially appearing only in fan works, the OS-tans proved popular enough that Microsoft branches in Asian countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Japan used the OS-tan personification concept as the basis for advertising campaigns for Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Silverlight, respectively.

==History==
The concept of the OS-tan is reported to have begun as a personification of the common perception of Windows Me (Released in 2000 by Microsoft as the 9x counterpart to Windows 2000) as unstable and prone to frequent crashes. Discussions on Futaba Channel likened this to the stereotype of a fickle, troublesome girl and as this personification expanded Me-tan was created and followed by the other characters. One of the early works to predominantly feature the OS-tan was an interactive Flash animation showing a possible intro to an imaginary anime show known as &quot;Trouble Windows&quot;. It was first published on 2004-04-19 and appears to have quickly spread worldwide, its first known appearance outside of Futaba Channel being on the site Misfile. However, it may have spread more widely after the flash animation was uploaded to YouTube in 2005.

==Commercial products==
Ohzora Publishing produced one book based on OS-tan characters, titled . It includes illustrations by over 25 contributors. It also includes 95-tan, ME-tan, XP-tan figures, titled OS Girl 95, OS Girl me, OS Girl XP respectively, but include a molded space for 2k-tan (named OS Girl 2K).

ME-tan, 2K-tan, XP-tan were designed by GUHICO of Stranger Workshop, while 95-tan was designed by Fujisaki Shiro from H.B.Company.

Parthenon Production Limited, company had commercialized Pink Company&#x27;s OS-tan products.

MALINO from Deja Vu ArtWorks produced the Me Document and Shared Folder! trilogy, which were sold in digital format.

The Japanese version of Windows 7 Ultimate DSP Edition includes the unofficial Nanami Madobe mascot. This inspired Microsoft Taiwan to launch an official mascot for Microsoft Silverlight, Hikaru. This was followed up by giving Hikaru &quot;sisters&quot;, Lei, Aoi, and Yu.

A special package of the Japanese Windows 7 Ultimate DSP Edition, called the Touch Mouse Artist Edition or Touch Mouse Limited Edition Artist Series, came with an animated tutorial Windows theme (with custom sounds and three desktop backgrounds) featuring Madobe Nanami.

==&quot;Tan&quot; suffix==
The Japanese suffix is a mispronunciation of , an informal, intimate, and diminutive honorific suffix for a person, used for friends, family, and pets. In this case, the mispronunciation is used intentionally to achieve the contrived cute or charming effect that is commonly associated with its use by young children and is also sometimes added to the names of non-mascot characters. The personifications as a whole are commonly simply called mascots or mascot characters, and as such the &quot;-tan&quot; suffix itself means nothing outside its role as an honorific and its implications of cuteness. Normal suffixes, including &quot;-san&quot;, &quot;-chan&quot;, and &quot;-kun&quot; are also used in the name of some OS-tan, depending on the character and the speaker&#x27;s preference; the suffix may indeed be omitted entirely.

==Classic OS-tans==
=== MS-DOS ===
MS-DOS-tan is most commonly represented as a shy schoolgirl, with black or dark grey hair in pigtails decorated with &quot;DOS&quot;-shaped hair ties; her hair ties are usually blue, but are sometimes depicted in the colors of the MS DOS prompt logo as shown in Windows. She wears round glasses, a white button-down blouse with a light blue skirt and suspenders. She carries around a keyboard, and is usually peeking around corners.

=== Windows 3.1 ===
Windows 3.1-tan is depicted as a gothic girl with a cat named &quot;DOS-nuko&quot; who represents MS-DOS 6.22. Some depictions of her are cheerful or deadpan. She has long white hair with red eyes, a purple bow on her hair, a lavender gothic dress and a purple bow on her chest with a &quot;3.1&quot; brooch. Her cat can transform into a cat girl with a nurse outfit. This specific design is called &quot;Grandma&quot;, but she mostly looks young. 3.1-tan is called &quot;oobaba-sama&quot; which means &quot;Grandma&quot;. 

=== Windows 95 ===
Windows 95-tan is depicted as a Yamato nadeshiko who fought a battle with the Mac-tans in the 1990&#x27;s and has retired. She was aware of developments of the Internet and multimedia, but however, she is unfamiliar with developments after Windows 95 such as the USB. She has long brown or orange hair, brown or pink eyes, and a bow of the Windows logo, a kimono of the hana256.bmp wallpaper in the Japanese version of Windows 95 and black sandals. She is often depicted as a motherly and kind woman. 

=== Windows 98 ===
Windows 98-tan is a shy girl with an appearance of a middle school-aged person. She also has a mecha box, just like Windows 98SE-tan. She is 98SE-tan&#x27;s sister. She has a dark history notebook. She has a blue bob cut, a golden 98 hair clip, blue eyes, a sleeveless white shirt and a blue or black skirt, blue or black thigh highs and brown or black shoes. She also has blue or black gloves.

Windows 98SE-tan is depicted as a girl with an appearance of a middle-school-aged person who is prone to aggression and holds a can opener with her. She is a fan of professional wrestling. She has a mecha box, which is inspired by Vulcan from Zatch Bell. She has periwinkle or blue hair, a side ponytail with a cherry shaped hair tie. She has a green or teal sailor uniform.

=== Windows 2000 ===
Windows 2000-tan is depicted as a brilliant, smart, and reliable girl. She is efficient at her work and can handle many tasks at the same time. She has a blue bob cut with metallic cat ears and glasses, a blue coat with a swimsuit of the windows logo, blue boots and sometimes depicted with a charger tail. She is often called 2K instead of 2000.

An alternate design of 2K-tan, known as Nyake, has a blue bob cut with real cat ears, a white tail, wears a pair of blue paw gloves and shoes, a red animal collar with a bell, a blue one piece bathing suit, and sometimes wears glasses.

=== Windows Me ===
Windows Me-tan is a clumsy girl and tries her best in everything, but as a result, she always fails, but is always cheerful. She is the first OS-tan in the Futaba Channel, being created on August 6, 2003. She has mint green braids with an ahoge, a blue maid dress, with an orange or red bow on the chest with the Windows Me system restore icon. She often carries a leek with her and her favorite food is a Japanese roll cake. 2K-tan is her guardian.

==New generation OS-tans==
=== Windows XP ===
Windows XP Home-Tan is the twin sister of Windows XP Professional-Tan. She has a green ponytail with a metallic XP ornament on both sides, a green tracksuit, and glasses. She is a fujoshi that reads and writes yaoi comics.

Windows XP Professional-tan does her job without a hitch and is a good sleeper, but however, she is a very gluttonous eater because of the amount of HDD and RAM Windows XP required. She was created by XP Kaki-Aki, also known as Nac. She has dark hair with a XP hair pin, and ribbons. She wears a white and blue school girl outfit. Her human name is Saseko. The earliest design for a Windows XP character is a gynoid with a ponytail and glasses. Later, XP Kaki-Aki made a design with down hair, blue eyes, a blue bikini top that has &quot;XP&quot; and a blue skirt, blue thigh highs and one glove. The design changed after Windows XP SP2 was released.

Windows XP Media Center-tan is depicted as a blonde-haired woman with cat-eared orange headphones, glasses, and a green and orange stylized serafuku that bears a slight similarity to Saseko. She usually wears a pendant bearing a Media Center icon over her chest, and has been depicted carrying a remote on occasion. Her disposition is often portrayed as cheerful, although images with a more nonchalant look exist as well.

=== Windows Vista ===
There have been multiple depictions of a Vista-tan, and there is no agreed upon version, however, the most-known popular design is Chiivistan, a green haired girl with blue eyes, a black penguin coat that is see through, black shapewear, black thigh-highs, white collars, and black or white boots. She wears a collar bearing the Windows shield, and is sometimes seen having a scepter. There are two separate variations of Chiivistan in terms of appearance; one of these is that of a young girl in a slightly more conservative outfit, while the other is a more matured girl bearing physical maturity comparable to XP-tan.

The lesser-known designs are Vistake, a girl with silver hair, red eyes, a screw on her forehead, a red and white sailor fuku outfit, red and white striped stockings, and is sometimes seen having a scythe. Her sister is Visbou, a girl with gray short hair, red eyes, a blue ninja outfit, and a red scarf.

===Windows 7===
Akiba PC reported that the first 7777 copies of Japanese Windows 7 Ultimate DSP editions include special wallpaper and sound sets for a character called , voiced by Nana Mizuki. Her name is a wordplay; 窓辺 &quot;(Romanji:&quot; &quot;Madobe)&quot; meaning &quot;by the window&quot; or &quot;window sill&quot; and ななみ &quot;(Romanji: Nanami)&quot; being a variation of a certain pronunciation of the word &quot;seven&quot; in Japanese. The character was designed by Wakaba. The premium set includes a Windows 7 theme featuring 3 Nanami wallpapers, 19 event sound sets, CD with 5 extra Nanami sounds. Regular DSP edition includes a digest Windows 7 theme including a Nanami wallpaper, an event sound set; the preorder users can also download an extra Nanami wallpaper and 6 event sound sets. This makes it the first OS-tan marketed by the company producing the operating system. In addition, the character also got its own Twitter account.

During the initial sales event of the Windows 7 DSP edition, the official profile of the character has also been revealed. It shows Madobe Nanami was born in 1992-04-06 (release date of Windows 3.1) 17 years of age (at the time of release), who lives in Chiyoda, Tokyo. Nanami is among an extended family of 16 members, and she has elder brother named Goichi (吾一), elder sister named Mutsumi (むつみ), mother named Mikaho (美佳穗) from Madobe (窓辺) family, father named Kyuuhachi (究八) from Shirato (白戸) family. Nanami and her cousin Claudia Madobe (クロード(蔵人)) later appeared in Microsoft&#x27;s Cloud Girl comic strip.

===Windows 8===
The Japanese Windows 8 Pro DSP editions were released in Madobe Yū (or Yuu, ) and Madobe Ai () editions by Windows Navi+ (Techno-Alliance Corp.). Both versions (4,000 units per character, thus 8,000 total) include a Microsoft Wedge touch mouse with the Windows 8 logo, character-specific Windows theme (three theme pack wallpapers, event sounds in the respective character&#x27;s voice), picture password images. In addition, Limited Akihabara Editions (444 units per character, 888 total), sold in Tokyo&#x27;s Akihabara shopping district, include Madobe Ai/Yū edition of Microsoft Wedge Touch Mouse, an alternate character-specific event sound samples and theme pack and an alternate wallpaper for its respective character. Nipponbashi versions (500 units per character), sold in Nipponbashi in Osaka, include Microsoft Wedge touch mouse (with Ai and Yū decal), three theme pack wall papers (two common and one character-specific), and Yū or Ai event sounds. The Nipponbashi packages include different art. The 32/64-bit version availability depends on retailer.

Asuka Nishi voices the short-haired Yū, while Nao Tamura voices the long-haired Ai.

The Windows 8 Can Edition from Unitcom (available for the first 2,888 copies) included a notepad, T-shirt, two-way mouse pad, pocket media case, smart phone stand cleaning, two-way PC cleaner, Yū and Ai badges, and a freeze blanket.

The extended fictional Madobe family tree detailed that Yū is the older sister, and their parents are Eiichi () from the Netsu (根津) family and Shii () from the Madobe family. Yū and Ai were said to have a birthdate of 18 November 1996 (Windows CE&#x27;s release date) with age 15, with height of 152 cm. This conflicts with other back-story materials suggesting that Ai is the younger sister.

MasatakaP and Electrocutica produced a Windows 8 music video titled &quot;Through the Window&quot;, featuring Madobe characters Nanami, Yū (in silhouette), and Claudia. The video was presented as the opening to Microsoft&#x27;s keynote on the second day of Windows Developer Days in Japan.

In 2012 and 2013, Windows Navi+ (Techno-Alliance Corp.) also created separate Twitter accounts for Ai and Yū, respectively.

Two theme songs for Yū and Ai – &quot;Mir8cle Days&quot; () and &quot;Donna Mirai Demo&quot; () were unveiled on 15 June 2013, and sold as a CD bundled with Windows 8 Pro DSP Edition, sold at TwinBox Akihabara.

===Windows 8.1===
The Japanese Windows 8.1 Pro DSP edition Madobe Family version by Windows Navi+ (Techno-Alliance Corp.) is a limited (1000 units) version of Windows 8.1 Pro 32/64-bit edition with three types of Madobe family picture password wallpapers, Madobe character voices (Nanami, Yū, Ai, Claudia), Madobe family complete edition Windows theme pack, previously unpublished Madobe family designs, Final Pasocom Data Hikkoshi 9+ licence key, Skype three-month free trial, historical Windows logo stickers (XP, Vista, 7, 8). Other editions include a Memorial Pack version without voice, theme pack, stickers (6191 units); a 64-bit Windows Memorial Pack version with a Sculpt Mobile Mouse with Nanami decor (810 units). These editions were available for preorder on 2013-10-04 with release date on 2013-10-18. As part of the market launch, a Facebook draw of 8 followers took place when follower count reaches 80001; and total Twitter follower count for Yū and Ai reach 8001, where winners receive Yū- and Ai-themed prizes.

Additional types of Windows 8.1 Pro DSP edition Madobe family theme packs were also sold by Ark (TowerHill), ZOA Corporation, Tsukumo (Project White), Dospara, Buy More (Unit.com), Big Camera (Sofmap), and PC One. These versions include two types of wallpapers (Christmas, New Year), theme pack with system voices.

===Windows 10===
The name of the Windows 10 mascot was officially introduced as Tōko (or Touko) Madobe on 31 July 2015. As confirmed on the character&#x27;s official Facebook page, her name is a homonym for one of the readings for the Japanese word for &#x27;ten&#x27;: . Her name was chosen by fans through an online poll. According to her fictional profile, her origins are the Madobe family and she is set 100 years in the future. She likes online gaming and supporting others. Her personal traits are being an excellent student, and expanding her knowledge on technology. Her manager often worries since she is a bit spontaneous. She also enjoys cheering on people who are working hard and doing their best. She has a part-time job at the Akibano Custom Computer Company where she is a rookie. This level of back story is rather unusual for OS-tan.

===Windows 11 ===

Although Microsoft Japan officially produced a series of OS-tans as part of marketing campaigns for earlier versions of Windows, Windows 11 has not received an official OS-tan. Since its release, there has been no new character from Microsoft Japan or Windows Navi+ to represent the operating system. This is likely because Windows Navi+, the campaign responsible for the Madobe characters, was primarily an advertising initiative, which appears to have been discontinued after the release of the Windows 10 Creators Update in 2017. The domain has since been replaced by a VPN information site in 2023 with the domain now offline (as of January 2025).

A fan-made character named Ichika Madobe or 11-chan has since gained popularity but has never been endorsed by Microsoft or Windows Navi+ as an official character. As a result, Ichika is not considered part of the official Madobe family. Her rising popularity can be attributed to fan adoption, with increased visibility following an Instagram reel posted by the official Windows account in 2024.

==Linux-tans==
===Linux===
Linux-tan is typically portrayed as having light skin, long hime-cut blueish or purple hair, red or pinkish eyes, a loose, sleeveless blue dress with gold accents, flipper-shaped shoes, a spear with multiple ribbons attached near the spearhead, and a large helmet with a penguin bill-like visor, gnu horns, and a row of gear teeth running down the middle. This design often incorporated logos from Linux-related projects, such as the KDE &quot;K&quot; stamped on her helmet, the GNOME footprint logo printed on her dress, and the names of different Linux bootloaders emblazoned on the spear&#x27;s ribbons.

==Supporting characters==
Because of heavy associations between operating systems and their supporting programs, such as anti-virus clients and Web browsers, many supporting characters have been created to personify the of these applications. Some examples are:
* Microsoft Bing: Nanako, Nanae, Nanao, Nanami, Nana
* Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge: Inori Aizawa (IE-tan)
* Microsoft Silverlight: Hikaru Aizawa
* Microsoft Azure: Claudia Madobe
* Mozilla Firefox: Firefox-tan
* Mozilla Thunderbird: Thunderbird-tan

==Critical reception==
&quot;Wired News&quot; rated OS-tan among the &quot;Lamest Technology Mascots Ever&quot;, yet &quot;strangely compelling&quot;.

The influence of &quot;OS-tan&quot; would spark similar phenomena such as &quot;Console-tan&quot;, based on video game consoles.

<text>&quot;The Crepes of Wrath&quot; is the eleventh episode of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on April 15, 1990. It was written by George Meyer, Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti, and directed by Wes Archer and Milton Gray.

Bart is sent to France on a student exchange trip, where his hosts treat him like a slave. Meanwhile, an Albanian student temporarily lives with the rest of the Simpson family, and shows great interest in Homer&#x27;s work at the nuclear power plant.

The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. In 1997, David Bauder from &quot;TV Guide&quot; named it the greatest episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and the 17th-greatest episode of any television series.

==Plot==
At the Simpson family&#x27;s house, Homer injures his back after tripping on Bart&#x27;s skateboard and falling down the stairs. As punishment, Marge makes Bart clean his room, where he discovers a cherry bomb. At school the next day, Bart flushes the cherry bomb down a toilet in the boys&#x27; restroom while Principal Skinner&#x27;s mother, Agnes, is using the adjacent girls&#x27; restroom. The resulting explosion blows Agnes off the toilet seat, enraging Principal Skinner.

Skinner aims to punish Bart beyond suspension or expulsion; he proposes to Homer and Marge that Bart enter the school&#x27;s student exchange program, spending three months in France. When Bart is told he will stay in a lovely French château, he agrees to Skinner&#x27;s plan, much to Homer and Skinner&#x27;s delight. During Bart&#x27;s time in France, the Simpsons host a student from Albania named Adil Hoxha.

When Bart arrives in France, he is taken to a dilapidated farmhouse in a vineyard. His hosts are winemakers César and Ugolin, who treat him like a slave; they force Bart to carry buckets of water, pick and crush hundreds of grapes, and taste wine contaminated with antifreeze. The winemakers give Bart insufficient portions of food and force him to sleep on the floor.

Adil arrives in Springfield and impresses Marge and Homer with his polite manners and help with household chores. Homer grants Adil&#x27;s request to go on a tour of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. On the tour, Adil takes many photographs, which he transmits to Albania with a fax machine hidden in Bart&#x27;s treehouse; unbeknownst to Skinner or the Simpsons, Adil is an Albanian spy sent to obtain blueprints of the power plant&#x27;s reactor.

When the winemakers send Bart to town to buy a case of antifreeze, Bart attempts to ask a policeman for help, but he does not speak any English and hands Bart a piece of candy instead. Bart eats the candy, but expresses frustration that he has not learned any French since his arrival. Then, Bart finds himself speaking fluent French, suddenly realizing he had learned French all along. With his newfound skill, he goes back to the officer and tells him about his hosts&#x27; illegal activities; they are arrested and Bart becomes a hero.

In Springfield, Adil is caught spying by the FBI and deported to Albania in exchange for the return of an American spy (also a child) captured there. Bart returns home with gifts for his family, who embrace him and compliment him on his newfound ability to speak French.

==Production==
&quot;The Crepes of Wrath&quot; was the first episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; for which George Meyer was credited as a writer, and he wrote it together with Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. The episode was inspired by the French movie &quot;Manon of the Spring&quot;. The writers were trying to figure out which country the foreign exchange student should come from when they decided on Albania. They had not seen many uses of the country on television and decided to make the episode a tribute to actor John Belushi, who has Albanian roots. The writers did not know much about the country and could not think of a good name for the boy, so they gave him the surname Hoxha after the former leader of Albania, Enver Hoxha. They used real Albanian in the scene where Adil says goodbye to his family, and they tried to get the actual language right at Sam Simon&#x27;s instigation. They also used real French in the scenes of Bart in France. The writers did some research on a certain airport in France for the shots of Bart at the airport in Paris. Principal Skinner&#x27;s mother, Agnes Skinner, made her first appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in this episode, although her voice and personality were a bit different from what the viewers became used to in the later episodes of the show.
César and Ugolin are named after the peasants from the 1986 French language films &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; and &quot;Manon des Sources&quot;. Bart&#x27;s French gift to Maggie is a reference to &quot;Le Ballon Rouge&quot;, a short French children&#x27;s film. On the way to the chateau, Bart and Ugolin cycle past scenes depicted in several famous paintings, notably &quot;Bassin aux nymphéas&quot; by Claude Monet, &quot;Champ de blé aux corbeaux&quot; by Vincent van Gogh, &quot;Le rêve&quot; by Henri Rousseau and &quot;Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; by Édouard Manet.

A similar scandal involving the use of anti-freeze in wine emerged from Austria and West Germany in 1985.

Because the show received separate dub tracks for traditional French-speaking versus Canadian French-speaking territories, the scene involving Bart seeking a gendarme&#x27;s help was slightly altered. In the &quot;France French&quot; dub, Bart and the policeman both speak the same language, thus the impasse is that Bart initially seeks help about his two-month obligation to his host family and the policeman minimizes the matter, but then Bart gets inspiration to stress the wine poisoning to get help. In the Canadian French dub, Bart speaks Quebecois slang that the French gendarme does not understand, and Bart initially mutters, &quot;I thought they spoke French in France.&quot; Thus Bart figures out he must speak to the officer in stereotypical Parisian French to make himself understood.

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, &quot;The Crepes of Wrath&quot; finished 29th for the week with a Nielsen rating of 15.9, the second highest rated show on Fox. &quot;The Crepes of Wrath&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, said the episode was a &quot;Tour de Force&quot; and that this was &quot;perhaps the first episode to make the viewer&#x27;s jaw drop at the audacity and invention of the series&#x27; makers&quot;.

In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck rated this episode a (of 5), adding: &quot;while the laughs are a bit dry in this episode, the over-the-top plot is indicative of zaniness to come&quot;. Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that &quot;it&#x27;s clear that the writers had started to find their groove by the time this episode was produced. From start to finish, &#x27;Crepes&#x27; offered a solid experience, as the show began to feature more style and subtlety.&quot; Scott Collura at Hollywood Video praised the episode in a review, saying &quot;it is one of the best of the first season.&quot;

In 1997, David Bauder from &quot;TV Guide&quot; named this episode the greatest episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and the 17th greatest episode of any television show of all time. In 2006, IGN listed &quot;The Crepes of Wrath&quot; as the best episode of the first season, saying it &quot;features a strong central storyline, with Bart being shipped off to France as an exchange student and being forced to work for two unscrupulous winemakers [who] mix antifreeze in their wine&quot;. The episode&#x27;s reference to &quot;Le Ballon Rouge&quot; was named the third greatest film reference in the history of the show by Nathan Ditum of &quot;Total Film&quot;.

In &quot;Planet Simpson&quot;, author Chris Turner notes that many of the episode&#x27;s French characters and settings are derived largely from American stereotypes of France, writing &quot;[Caeser and Ugolin] are perfect embodiments of the stereotypical Frenchman so loathed in the United States.&quot;

<doc id="605299" wikidata="Q70428" url="?curid=605299" title="Karsk">
<text>Karsk (also called kask) is Norwegian and Swedish cocktail (from the Trøndelag region) containing coffee together with moonshine and sometimes a spoon of sugar (enthusiasts often consider moonshine exclusively to be appropriate as an added component, as it has no inherent taste like other alcoholic beverages). Broader, it can also be found in other parts of Scandinavia.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;karsk&quot; is derived from the Old Norse adjective , meaning healthy, vigorous or agile.

==Origin==
The precise origin of &quot;karsk&quot; is unknown, however it appears to have been a popular drink in the Swedish Bohuslän district in the early 1800s. By the latter half of the century, its popularity spread across Norway. It was and still is especially popular in rural areas, although city-folk also enjoy it. It is firmly embedded as a part of the culture in Trøndelag, and according to former Norwegian Minister of Culture Trond Giske &quot;Everyone who has grown up in Trøndelag, has had Karsk at some point&quot;.

==Variations==
In English-speaking countries, the variant with vodka instead of moonshine is sometimes called Russian coffee, though Russian coffee can also refer to a variant served with whipped cream.

In Norway, the term karsk is predominantly used in the mid-region of the country (Trøndelag, roughly corresponding to the county of Trøndelag), while it may be referred to with other terms in other parts of the country. For instance, it may also be referred to as kaffedoktor (&quot;Coffee doctor&quot;) or knikt (Hedmark dialect for knekt (jack/knave)); both these are for instance popular designations in the counties of Hedmark and Oppland (merged to Innlandet after 1 January 2020). In Northern Norway it may also be referred to as rotar, though some would use these terms (kaffedoktor and rotar) exclusively about a variety where sugar is added with the coffee. 

In Sweden it is called kask, kaffekask (&quot;strong coffee&quot;) or kaffegök and is mainly drunk in the central and northern parts. Even the Southeastern dialect of Finnish has an expression for the beverage, there called kaffeplörö or kaffeblörö.

In Denmark this type of drink is usually called a kaffepunch and traditionally consists of nothing but coffee with schnapps.

The mixing ratio varies.

==Notable karsk aficionados==
* Trond Giske, Norwegian politician
* Petter Northug, Norwegian cross-country skier
* Bjarne Brøndbo, Norwegian musician

===As an NBC affiliate (1948–1995)===

As the only television station that was built from the ground up by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, WBZ-TV began operations 10 a.m. at June 9, 1948, with test patterns. The station&#x27;s dedicatory program aired at 6:30 p.m. and featured remarks from the Very Rev. Edwin Van Etten, Archbishop Richard Cushing, Rabbi Joshua L. Liebman, Boston Mayor James Michael Curley, Boston Chamber of Commerce president C. Lawrence Muench, and Governor Robert F. Bradford. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the exact day the station would launch, all of the messages were prerecorded and one of the speakers (Liebman) had died before the program aired. The dedication was followed by the station&#x27;s first news broadcast, hosted by Arch MacDonald.

The station was from its inception associated with the NBC television network, owing to WBZ radio (1030 AM)&#x27;s longtime affiliation with NBC&#x27;s radio networks. At its sign-on, WBZ-TV became the first commercial television station to begin operations in the New England region. The station originally operated from inside the Hotel Bradford alongside its radio sister; its current home was not completed at the time, although master control and its self-supporting tower over the building were in use at sign-on. The WBZ stations would not move into what was then known as the Westinghouse Broadcasting Center until June 17, 1948, when the building was opened.

The station was knocked off the air on August 31, 1954, when Hurricane Carol destroyed its transmitter tower. A temporary transmitter was installed using a short, makeshift tower at the studio site and later on the original tower of WEEI-FM (now WBGB) in Malden. In 1957, WBZ-TV began broadcasting from a tower in Needham, along with WBZ-FM at 106.7 FM (now WMJX). The tower site is now owned by American Tower Corporation, and is used by several Boston-area television stations, including WGBH-TV (channel 2) and WCVB-TV (channel 5).

Channel 4 was in danger of losing its NBC affiliation when Westinghouse balked at NBC&#x27;s initial offer to trade sister stations KYW radio and WPTZ television (now KYW-TV) in Philadelphia, in exchange for WTAM-AM-FM and WNBK television (now WKYC-TV) in Cleveland. In response, NBC threatened to pull its programming from both WBZ-TV and WPTZ unless Westinghouse agreed to the trade. The swap was made in February 1956, and Westinghouse immediately complained to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the U.S. Department of Justice about NBC&#x27;s extortion. The threat reemerged in 1960 after NBC announced it would swap the Philadelphia stations in exchange for a competing Boston outlet, then-CBS affiliate WNAC-TV (channel 7, now defunct) and its sister radio stations, from RKO General. Approval of the RKO-NBC deal would have potentially made WBZ-TV an ABC affiliate, completing a three-way swap of network affiliations in Boston. However, in 1964, the FCC nullified the NBC-RKO trade and ordered the NBC-Westinghouse swap reversed without NBC realizing any profit on the deal. WBZ-TV retained its NBC affiliation as a result of the canceled sale.

WBZ-TV (sometimes informally referred to as &quot;BZ&quot; both on- and off-air) was a pioneer in Boston television. In 1948, it began live broadcasts of Boston&#x27;s two Major League Baseball teams, the Red Sox and the Braves, broadcasts that at first were split with WNAC-TV. It was also the first Boston station to have daily newscasts, starting with the station&#x27;s very first night on the air. On October 12, 1957, WBZ-TV broadcast a half-hour special program on Sputnik 1, featuring a motion picture of the final stage of its rocket crossing the pre-dawn sky of Baltimore, shot by sister station WJZ-TV. The station was the first in the Boston market to employ a female reporter (Betty Adams), the first to employ a Black full-time reporter (Terry Carter), the first to have an all-female news team (Shelby Scott and Gail Harris), the first to have a Black full-time nightly news anchor (Liz Walker), and the first to air a minority affairs program.

===Switch to CBS (1995–present)===

In 1994, sister station WJZ-TV in Baltimore lost its affiliation with ABC after that network announced a deal with the E.W. Scripps Company to switch three of Scripps&#x27; television stations—including its Baltimore outlet, WMAR-TV—to ABC as a condition of retaining its network affiliations with WEWS-TV in Cleveland and WXYZ-TV in Detroit; CBS intended to affiliate with those two stations, as it was about to lose its longtime affiliates in those markets to Fox due to a deal with New World Communications. Westinghouse felt betrayed by ABC&#x27;s decision, and as a safeguard began shopping for affiliation deals for the entire Group W television unit. Group W eventually struck an agreement to switch WBZ-TV, KYW-TV and WJZ-TV to CBS (Westinghouse&#x27;s two other stations, KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh and KPIX in San Francisco, were already CBS affiliates). The Boston market&#x27;s third network affiliation switch took place on January 2, 1995. The NBC affiliation went to the former CBS affiliate, WHDH-TV (channel 7). After a 47-year relationship with NBC, channel 4 became the third station in Boston to align with CBS. The network had originally affiliated with WNAC-TV in 1948, then moved to channel 5 (the original WHDH-TV) in 1961; it then returned to WNAC-TV (predecessor to the current WHDH) in 1972 and remained on channel 7 until the switch.

When Westinghouse merged with CBS outright on November 24, 1995, WBZ-TV became a CBS-owned-and-operated station (and has remained so ever since). As a condition of the merger, CBS had to sell WPRI-TV (channel 12) in Providence, Rhode Island, which was acquired by CBS earlier that year. Channel 4 provides at least grade B signal coverage to all of Rhode Island, and city-grade coverage within Providence itself as well as Fall River and New Bedford. At the time, the FCC normally did not allow common ownership of two stations with overlapping signals, and would not even consider a waiver for stations with overlapping city-grade signals. In 1996, WBZ-TV became the first former Group W television station to drop the classic Group W font.

After the 2000 acquisition of CBS by its former subsidiary, Viacom, which effectively made the station locally owned because Viacom&#x27;s parent National Amusements is based in the suburbs of Boston, WBZ-TV&#x27;s operations were merged with that of Boston&#x27;s UPN affiliate, WSBK-TV; concurrently, WBZ-TV also took over the operations of WLWC, the UPN affiliate in nearby Providence, which had been run out of WSBK-TV. Today, the operations of WBZ-TV and WSBK-TV are co-located at WBZ&#x27;s studios in Brighton. WLWC was sold in 2006 to the Four Points Media Group, a holding company owned by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management; it, along with the other Four Points stations, has since been acquired by Sinclair Broadcast Group (WLWC would subsequently be sold to OTA Broadcasting and Ion Media).

On February 2, 2017, CBS agreed to sell CBS Radio to Entercom, then the fourth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States, the sale was conducted using a Reverse Morris Trust so that it would be tax-free. While CBS shareholders retained a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom was the surviving entity, separating WBZ (AM) and its sister radio stations from WBZ-TV. The sale was completed on November 17, 2017; under the terms of a settlement with the Justice Department, WBZ (AM) was then divested to iHeartMedia.

==Logos and imaging==

In the early 1960s, WBZ unveiled a new stylized &quot;4&quot; logo, using a distinctive font that had been designed especially for Group W. The logo became italicized in 1987, but remained the same font. It kept this logo for over 30 years until it unveiled its first &quot;News 4 New England&quot; logo in September 1996, a year and a half after the switch from NBC to CBS. The old logo was the longest-used numeric logo in New England television history until WCVB&#x27;s stylized &quot;5&quot; crossed the 31-year mark in 2003.

The &quot;Circle 4&quot; logo that replaced the original &quot;News 4&quot; logo in 1998 was often referred to on-air by WBZ sports anchor Bob Lobel as &quot;The Circle 4 Ranch&quot;. In 2004, WBZ began using CBS&#x27;s standardized branding, becoming &quot;CBS 4&quot;. In 2007, it dropped the standardized logo and reverted to being known as just &quot;WBZ&quot;, using a new logo with WBZ lettering and the CBS eye contained within a series of squares. CBS would extend the logo design to then-sister radio station WBZ (1030 AM) in 2010. Alongside the introduction of a new set and the CBS O&amp;O graphics package in 2011, WBZ introduced a logo combining the 2004 &quot;CBS 4&quot; logo with the squared WBZ lettering below it. However, the &quot;squares&quot; logo continued to be used as a secondary logo during the early 2010s, including certain promotions and on monitors in the station&#x27;s news set.

On March 31, 2023, WBZ debuted the &quot;CBS News&quot; graphics and music package, following other CBS owned and operated stations. The morning newscast was the last time the &quot;CBS 4/WBZ&quot; logo was used to identify the station; for the afternoon newscasts, the &quot;CBS News&quot; graphics debuted, with WBZ call letters in a black box and the &quot;CBS News Boston&quot; logo beside it.

==Programming==
===Past programming preemptions and deferrals===
As an NBC affiliate, the station was known to preempt several hours of network programming per day—a common practice among Group W television stations affiliated with NBC and CBS. This was significant, since WBZ-TV was NBC&#x27;s third-largest affiliate, and second-largest in the Eastern Time Zone. It primarily preempted several of the network&#x27;s morning programs, with most preempted programs appearing on independent stations in the area, including future sister station WSBK-TV and WQTV (now WBPX-TV). In addition, programs preempted by WBZ-TV could be seen on NBC&#x27;s Providence affiliate WJAR, which provides a city-grade signal to the Boston area. In January 1983, when &quot;People Are Talking&quot; expanded to one hour, WBZ-TV dropped the NBC soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;, which moved first to WQTV, then to Worcester-based WHLL-TV (now WUTF-TV), and finally, in the early 1990s, Lawrence-licensed WMFP. The station also dropped some Saturday morning cartoons in 1990 (which also aired on WHLL), two years before NBC abandoned such programming in favor of a Saturday edition of the morning news show &quot;Today&quot; and live-action series aimed at teenagers such as &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;.

NBC has traditionally been less tolerant of preemptions than the other networks and had to find alternate independent stations to air the various programs that WBZ-TV did not air. Despite this, NBC was generally satisfied with WBZ-TV, which was one of NBC&#x27;s strongest affiliates. As a sidebar, Philadelphia sister station KYW-TV (NBC&#x27;s largest affiliate at the time) also heavily preempted NBC programming, but it spent most of the 1980s and 1990s as NBC&#x27;s weakest major-market affiliate.

===&quot;Bob Emery&quot; and &quot;Boomtown&quot;===
The station also broadcast many locally produced programs over the years. One of the most beloved was the long-running &quot;Big Brother Bob Emery&quot; show, hosted by veteran radio performer Bob Emery, who first did the show on Boston-area radio in 1921 and who in 1947 hosted the first five-times-a-week children&#x27;s show on network television on DuMont. For nearly two decades, from 1956 to 1974, Rex Trailer hosted a popular weekend morning children&#x27;s show called &quot;Boomtown&quot;. For part of that time, &quot;Boomtown&quot; originated from an outdoor &quot;western town&quot; set built next to WBZ-TV&#x27;s studios. In 2005, WBZ aired a special documentary film directed by Michael Bavaro titled &quot;Rex Trailer&#x27;s Boomtown&quot; featuring old clips and interviews with childhood fans such as Jay Leno, Steven Wright, Tom Bergeron and Jimmy Tingle. The broadcast master is now part of the permanent collection at the Museum of Television &amp; Radio in New York City.

===&quot;Evening Magazine&quot;===
In April 1977, &quot;Evening Magazine&quot; premiered on the station. A weeknight magazine series that originated on San Francisco sister station KPIX-TV, it expanded to Group W&#x27;s other stations in the late 1970s, before it began to be distributed to stations not owned by Westinghouse as &quot;PM Magazine&quot;. On WBZ, the original hosting teams were Robin Young and Marty Sender (1977–1980); Sender and Candace Hasey (1980–1981); and Sender and Sara Edwards (1981–1982). Later, Edwards and Barry Nolan became the longest running pair to host the program (1982–1989), before Jim Watkins replaced Nolan permanently in October 1989 (guests hosts had joined Edwards for a few months prior to Watkins&#x27; arrival). &quot;Evening&quot; enjoyed an over-13-year run, the last nine of which had it compete directly with WCVB&#x27;s newsmagazine &quot;Chronicle&quot;. In September 1990, due to a decline in the franchise&#x27;s popularity and tabloid TV magazines heralding bigger ratings and revenue, Group W canceled &quot;Evening/PM&quot;, with the last WBZ broadcast airing on December 17 of that year.

The program was originally replaced in the weeknight 7:30 slot by &quot;Family Feud&quot; from December 18, 1990, through mid-January 1991. With action in the Gulf War reaching a breaking point at that time, the station decided to begin airing expanded coverage of the war at 7:30 pm, in an ongoing series titled &quot;Crisis in the Gulf: The 7:30 Report&quot;. Anchored by Jack Williams and Liz Walker, it served as a comprehensive update on the war until peace was called on February 27, 1991. Station management elected to keep the newscast going, but now as a newsmagazine that specialized in investigative reports. Now with Randy Price as the principal anchor, the title was shortened to &quot;The 7:30 Report&quot;. The show continued on for another year and a half. Then, from September 1992 until September 2009, WBZ aired &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;—which it had acquired from WHDH-TV—at 7:30 p.m. (that show has been syndicated by CBS since 2006).

===&quot;People Are Talking&quot;===
&quot;People Are Talking&quot;, which ran from 1980 to 1993, was a live early-afternoon talk show that aired on WBZ, as it did on some other Westinghouse stations (notably Baltimore, whose version of the program was at one time co-hosted by Oprah Winfrey). In Boston, it was originally hosted by Nancy Merrill and later by Buzz Luttrell, but the best-known host was the program&#x27;s last, Tom Bergeron.

===Miscellaneous===
WBZ-TV carried &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; during its first nationally syndicated year (1986–1987), airing the show weekdays at 9 am. Despite its overnight success, channel 4 had little interest in keeping the show as a part of its schedule, in part because the station had to give priority to the upcoming Group W-distributed talk show, &quot;The Wil Shriner Show&quot;, in the fall of 1987. &quot;Oprah&quot; moved to a 5 p.m. weekday time slot on WCVB-TV, where it became an institution (later moving to 4 p.m. in 1994) for the balance of its run, ending in 2011. In October 2009, WBZ-TV became the Boston outlet for the game shows &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and moved &quot;The Insider&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; to sister-station WSBK-TV. Previously, both aforementioned game shows aired on WSBK-TV since 2001, and on WHDH prior to then.

===Lottery===
WBZ-TV was a local television pioneer in lottery. It was the first station, in 1975, to air official lottery drawing results from the Massachusetts Lottery. During the station&#x27;s 6 p.m. newscast, graphic slides featuring the Lottery and The Numbers Game logos would appear with the nightly results from the Boston and Tri-State (Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont) regions. This would continue in varied forms, usually as the newscast went to commercial break, for almost a decade.

In the spring of 1984, WBZ introduced local live lottery drawings. In response to the Mass Lottery&#x27;s second major game, &quot;Megabuck$&quot;, WBZ, in conjunction, created &quot;Lottery Live&quot;, a series of live and hosted minute-long machine studio drawings. Done in the style of a game show format (albeit truncated), it was not only meant to let viewers see the process of lottery results, but to generate excitement and interest into the Lottery. Hosted by &quot;Evening Magazine&quot; contributor and &quot;4 Today&quot; host Tom Bergeron, &quot;Lottery Live&quot; aired the daily &quot;Numbers Game&quot; following the last main segment of &quot;Evening&quot; at 7:55 p.m. weeknights. Twice a week, during the NBC prime time lineup at 9:58 pm, the &quot;Megabuck$&quot; drawings would air. Bergeron was known for wearing a tuxedo during &quot;Megabuck$&quot; drawings that he nicknamed the &quot;mega tux&quot;. The &quot;Numbers Game&quot; also aired Saturdays at 7:55 pm. Beginning on May 1, 1987 (a few months before &quot;Lottery Live&quot; ended its original WBZ run), a new state sweepstakes, &quot;Mass Millions&quot;, was introduced, and was televised on &quot;Lottery Live&quot; each Friday. Substitute hosts during the original WBZ run of &quot;Lottery Live&quot; included &quot;Evening Magazine&quot; reporter Steve Aveson (later of New England Cable News) and WBZ radio personality Ron Robin.

The station holds the record for having the longest initial involvement with the Lottery (12 years), culminating in its decision to release the lottery rights to another station in 1987. Both WCVB and WNEV (present-day WHDH) were in the running for picking up the rights; in the end, the torch was passed to WNEV, who saw the acquisition as helping their station revenues and key ratings periods (that station&#x27;s newscasts were continually in third place). Channel 7 continued the &quot;Lottery Live&quot; title and format with different hosts, upon its move on August 31, 1987. WNEV/WHDH aired &quot;Lottery Live&quot; for seven seasons, until new ownership terminated the contract, upon which WCVB had their turn to air the games (from 1994 to 1998).

Eleven years after leaving its original station, &quot;Lottery Live&quot; returned to WBZ on May 20, 1998, with longtime host Dawn Hayes (from the WNEV/WHDH era) still at the helm. By this time, in addition to &quot;The Numbers Game&quot; still airing six nights a week at 7:53 pm, late-night airings (during the 11 p.m. newscast) drew &quot;Megabuck$&quot;, &quot;Mass Million$&quot;, &quot;Mass Ca$h&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Big Game&quot; (1996) on individual nights. Due to new limited contracts permitting the local stations to carry &quot;Lottery Live&quot; for only three years at a time, WBZ moved the games to sister station WSBK-TV in 2001.

===Special events===
From 2003 through 2016, WBZ produced coverage of the Boston Pops Orchestra&#x27;s annual Fourth of July concert at the Hatch Memorial Shell. In the event&#x27;s first decade on the station, the 10 pm. ET hour of the show was broadcast nationally by CBS – featuring the Pops&#x27; signature performances of the 1812 Overture and &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;, as well as the fireworks over the Charles River. Live coverage of the event was broadcast in high-definition for the first time beginning in 2007.

CBS ended its national broadcast of the event following the 2012 concert; Boston Pops executive producer David G. Mugar believed CBS made this decision due to poor ratings, due primarily to NBC counterprogramming the Boston Pops&#x27; live broadcast with an encore broadcast of its competing Fourth of July special from New York City. In 2016 (which also marked Mugar&#x27;s retirement), CBS resumed network coverage of the concert, airing the final two hours, with the entire concert continuing to air locally on WBZ.

On March 7, 2017, it was announced that the telecast would move to Bloomberg Television in 2017, as part of a new sponsorship deal between the Boston Pops, Eaton Vance, and Bloomberg L.P. The 2018 edition was simulcast by WHDH.

===Sports===
WBZ-TV has aired local sporting events over the years, that have originated either in-house, or through NBC or CBS. Besides the Braves (from 1948 until the team moved to Milwaukee before the 1953 season) and the Red Sox (1948–1957, 1972–1974, and a handful of games in 2003 and 2004, along with certain games aired nationally on NBC from 1948 to 1989), WBZ-TV also broadcast the Boston Celtics from 1972 to 1985 (and again from 1990 to 1994 through NBC&#x27;s broadcast contract with the NBA).

In 1981, WBZ-TV was the first Boston television station to broadcast live wire-to-wire coverage of the Boston Marathon; the station continued to do so every year through 2022, and was the only Boston station to do so starting in 2007 (WCVB-TV and WHDH-TV also carried the race in its entirety during much of the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s). Marathon coverage would move to WCVB-TV in 2023.

The station has long been associated with the New England Patriots of the National Football League, an association that began in 1965 after NBC&#x27;s acquisition of rights to the American Football League, of which the Patriots were a part of then. After WBZ&#x27;s switch to CBS, Patriots regular season games would not air on the station again until 1998, when CBS acquired the television rights to the NFL&#x27;s present AFC. Since then, the majority of Patriots regular season games have aired on WBZ, and in 2009, the station became the Patriots&#x27; &quot;official&quot; station, gaining rights to preseason games and airing the weekly program &quot;Patriots All Access&quot;. Three of the Patriots&#x27; Super Bowl appearances—XX, XXXVIII and LIII (including the team&#x27;s wins in the latter two)—were televised by WBZ.

In April 2021, the station announced that WBZ-TV and its sister station WSBK-TV would air New England Revolution matches throughout the 2021 season; most matches were aired on WSBK, with select matches (including, in 2021, the season opener) airing on WBZ-TV. WBZ and WSBK lost the local rights to Revolution matches in 2023, when all MLS broadcasts shift to MLS Season Pass, a new subscription service hosted on Apple TV.

===News operation===
WBZ-TV presently broadcasts 34 hours, 35 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 4 hours, 35 minutes each weekday; 4 hours, 5 minutes on Saturdays; and 5 hours, 5 minutes on Sundays). WBZ operates a Bell LongRanger 206LIV helicopter for newsgathering called &quot;Sky Eye&quot;. In addition to its main studios, the station operates two other news bureaus. The &quot;Worcester Bureau&quot; is located in the Worcester Plaza office tower at 440–446 Main Street in that city. The &quot;New Hampshire Bureau&quot; is located on Elm Street in Manchester. The station&#x27;s weather radar is located at Worcester Regional Airport. Along with other CBS-owned stations, WBZ offers a web-only &quot;@ Your Desk&quot; newscast available live and on-demand. WBZ produces a weeknight 8 p.m. newscast for sister station WSBK.

Although the station tends to rank No. 1 in daytime and prime time ratings, Channel 4&#x27;s local news ratings have suffered since the switch in network affiliations. This is partly because at the time of the switch, CBS was well behind NBC in the network ratings. Taken as a whole, its local newscasts are the lowest rated of Boston&#x27;s &quot;Big 3&quot; affiliates, having dipped behind a resurgent WHDH-TV as well.

In the mid-1960s, it adopted the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format that had been pioneered at Philadelphia sister station KYW-TV. WBZ was the first Boston station to have a regularly-scheduled late afternoon news program. In the 1970s, the station aired &quot;First 4 News&quot; at 5:30 pm, anchored initially by Jack Williams and Pat Mitchell, then by Gail Harris. On July 21, 1979, a new format premiered in this time slot: &quot;Live on 4&quot;, a more informal program mixing elements of a daytime talk show with those of a traditional newscast, went on to become a trendsetter in the Boston market in the 1980s. First anchored by Gail Harris and Chris Marrou, it later had hosting assumed by many other WBZ staff members, including entertainment reporter Joyce Kulhawik and news anchor Chris Conangla in the mid-1980s. &quot;Live on 4&quot; gave a loose preview of the news to be covered more in depth at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. with featuring stories on lifestyle, health and entertainment topics, along with live, in-studio guests.

At one point, WCVB considered launching a competing program that was similarly structured (to be anchored by Peter Mehegan and Mary Richardson, who later became the long-running anchor team on &quot;Chronicle&quot;), but it was WNEV who made three attempts at a &quot;Live on 4&quot;-inspired show. First, it premiered the two-hour live talk/magazine show &quot;Look&quot; in the fall of 1982 (renamed &quot;New England Afternoon&quot; in its second and final year), it failed in the Nielsen ratings and was canceled in 1984. Three years later, WNEV tried the even more news-oriented copy &quot;New England News: Live at Five&quot;, which essentially became Boston&#x27;s first proper 5 p.m. newscast, although it still featured the informal structure of &quot;Live on 4&quot;. Although this competitor to &quot;Live on 4&quot; drew high ratings, the format ended after only a year, due to the departure of its creator, anchor Dave Wright. From 1988 to 1991, WNEV (which became WHDH-TV in 1990) ran a 5 p.m. newscast with a regular hard-news format.

In the early 1980s, WBZ-TV lost its longtime spot as Boston&#x27;s highest-rated news station to WCVB, but even then placed a strong second for more than a decade. Its evening news team—consisting of anchors Jack Williams and Liz Walker, the late meteorologist Bruce Schwoegler, and sportscaster Bob Lobel—was the longest-running news team in New England from 1981 until Walker moved to the noon newscast in 2000. Other personalities who came to channel 4 during this time were political reporter John Henning and Kulhawik. Williams remained at WBZ until his retirement in June 2015, Walker gave up anchoring duties in 2005 and hosted a Sunday morning talk show for several years before leaving the station in October 2008.

With syndicated news and tabloid programming becoming more the norm in the late 1980s and early 1990s, &quot;Live on 4&quot;, like &quot;Evening Magazine&quot;, was starting to become of lesser importance to Group W. In 1991, after a 12-year-run, &quot;Live on 4&quot; was dropped after WBZ-TV acquired &quot;A Current Affair&quot; for the 5:30 p.m. time slot (the program previously aired on WFXT). WBZ launched a 5 p.m. newscast at that time. When &quot;ACA&quot; moved to WCVB&#x27;s late night schedule in the fall of 1993 (later moving to WHDH&#x27;s daytime lineup in 1994), WBZ switched their late afternoon newscast to 5:30 pm, and began airing the freshman syndicated series &quot;American Journal&quot; (with WBZ alumnus Nancy Glass as anchor) at its 5 p.m. lead-in. &quot;American Journal&quot; would itself move to WCVB starting in its second season.

During the 1994–95 season, WBZ dropped late afternoon news altogether, airing &quot;The Maury Povich Show&quot; at 5 p.m. instead. By the summer of 1995, the station&#x27;s news had fallen to third place for the very first time, thanks in part to WHDH and WCVB&#x27;s full-hour 5 p.m. news accounting for their ratings dominance. In response, WBZ began airing two hours of news between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. that fall, with the end time of the news block later being scaled back to 6:30 p.m. in 1997 (to accommodate the move of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; to 6:30 pm, and the station picking up &quot;Extra&quot; for 7 pm). The 90-minute 5 p.m. news remained originally until June 2004, when WBZ launched a 4 p.m. newscast for the first time (to complete with WHDH&#x27;s newscast in the same timeslot). The 4 p.m. newscast was an hour long; the 5 p.m. hour was then given to &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, a scheduling prompted by a contractual prohibition on scheduling &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; directly against &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, as well as the success of a similar move by Philadelphia sister station KYW-TV.

Channel 4 changed its news and station branding continuously in the decade following the affiliation switch; after having changed from its longstanding brand of &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; to &quot;WBZ News 4&quot; in 1993 (prior to the switch), the newscasts were rebranded to &quot;News 4 New England&quot; in 1996 and &quot;WBZ 4 News&quot; in 2000. On February 1, 2004, WBZ rebranded itself as &quot;CBS 4&quot;, the move was officially made in an attempt to alleviate lingering confusion from the 1995 affiliation swap, though the branding brought the station in line with other CBS-owned stations. The &quot;CBS 4&quot; branding was phased out during the first quarter of 2007 and in February 2007, the station&#x27;s newscast title was reverted from &quot;CBS 4 News&quot; to &quot;WBZ News&quot;. The rebranding was completed on February 4, 2007, during the station&#x27;s coverage of the Super Bowl. This made WBZ-TV the first station owned by CBS to depart from CBS&#x27;s standardization, and one of a handful of CBS-owned stations to brand with its call letters rather than the CBS name. General manager Ed Piette told &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; that he decided to ditch the &quot;CBS 4&quot; branding when he arrived in Boston for his first day of work and a cabbie asked him, &quot;Whatever happened to WBZ?&quot; The move was done in the hopes of re-emphasizing WBZ-TV&#x27;s local identity and trading on the call letters&#x27; then eight-decade history in Boston—a strategy that worked well when Piette was general manager at Minneapolis–Saint Paul sister station WCCO-TV. The logo that was used for the &quot;CBS 4&quot; branding returned to the station in December 2011, but the station still brands with its call letters to this day.

In January 2006, attempting to bolster its local news ratings, WBZ reinstated its 5 p.m. news (with &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; moving back to 3 pm) as part of a &quot;mega-block&quot; of news, and dismissed its former lead anchor Josh Binswanger, leading to the return of longtime anchor Jack Williams to the evening newscasts. In addition, Ed Carroll&#x27;s contract was not renewed and in October 2005 the station hired Ken Barlow from KARE in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to replace him as chief meteorologist. The 4 p.m. newscast was discontinued later in 2006.

In late August 2006, WBZ-TV hired anchor Chris May from WHDH-TV, pairing him with Sara Underwood as anchors of the station&#x27;s weekday 5 p.m. newscast. May subsequently moved to Philadelphia sister station KYW-TV, where he would remain until 2015. Underwood&#x27;s contract with the station was not renewed and she left the station on March 4, 2008. In January 2007, the station launched Project Mass, a commitment to cover the community&#x27;s top concerns in government, transit, healthcare, education, finance and the environment. The initiative kicked off with an online town meeting. WBZ&#x27;s on-air staff continued to change in late 2007, when longtime morning anchor Scott Wahle was reassigned and replaced by former WFXT anchor David Wade. In January 2008, longtime morning and midday meteorologist Barry Burbank was reassigned to the weekend programs. He was replaced by meteorologist Todd Gutner. On February 29, 2008, it was reported that the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike caused a significant loss in viewers during the late news. WBZ-TV finished with an average of 157,800 total viewers, down from 177,800 viewers in 2007.

On April 1, 2008, CBS&#x27;s owned-and-operated television stations division ordered widespread budget cuts and staff layoffs from its stations. As a result of the budget cuts, roughly 30 staffers were released from WBZ-TV and WSBK-TV, including longtime sports director Bob Lobel, entertainment reporter Joyce Kulhawik, and WSBK anchor Scott Wahle. Lobel left channel 4 on May 16, 2008, while Kulhawik and Wahle left on May 29, 2008, and May 30, 2008, respectively. Steve Burton would become the new sports director, while the position that Kulhawik held was eliminated. Jack Williams filled in for the 9 p.m. spot in the interim. On June 6, 2008, weekend anchor/reporter Kate Merrill was appointed as 9 p.m. anchor on WSBK, along with general assignment reporting duties for the weekday 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. newscasts. Lobel subsequently served as a guest co-host on then-sister station WODS&#x27; morning show in late 2008 and a guest sports anchor on WBZ radio in January 2009. Even with the budget cuts at CBS, WBZ-TV&#x27;s 11 p.m. newscast was number one in its time slot in the 2007–08 season (it has since slipped back to second place).

On September 15, 2008, the station was in the process of upgrading its news set for high definition broadcasts. During that time, all newscasts originated from the on-air area of the newsroom. The renovations lasted for at least six weeks. On December 11, 2008, WBZ and sister station WSBK-TV respectively became the fourth and fifth stations in the Boston market (behind WCVB, WHDH and WLVI) to begin broadcasting its newscasts in high definition. On May 19, 2009, WBZ/WSBK and Fox-owned WFXT entered into a Local News Service agreement that allows the stations to share local news video, along with a helicopter for traffic reports and breaking news. The helicopter originally used as part of the sharing agreement (which WFXT and WBZ/WSBK stopped using in 2013) was later involved in a crash that killed two people in Seattle on March 18, 2014, while on loan by Helicopters, Inc. for use by KOMO-TV during technical upgrades to that station&#x27;s own helicopter.

On December 12, 2011, WBZ debuted a new news set, replacing one that had been used for nearly a decade, it features LED lighting, a dedicated weather area, and 16 high definition monitors. The new look, plus a greater emphasis on &quot;hard news&quot; coverage, are changes which the station believed would help regain viewership it had lost to rival station WCVB. Susan Walker, a broadcast professor at the Boston University, criticized the station&#x27;s concurrent adoption of a standard graphics and branding scheme similar to its sister stations, which she believed put too much emphasis on WBZ being a CBS station, rather than branding itself as a local station.

WBZ-TV launched a streaming news service, CBSN Boston (now CBS News Boston) on September 24, 2019, as part of a rollout of similar services (each localized versions of the national CBSN service) across the CBS-owned stations.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
The CBS subchannel is offered in ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) format from the transmitter of WUNI.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WBZ-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 30, using virtual channel 4.

As part of the SAFER Act, WBZ temporarily kept its analog channel on the air until July 12 to broadcast information regarding the transition to digital television.

In 2015, CBS and Weigel Broadcasting&#x27;s Decades network was added to 4.2 upon its launch.

<text>A counsel or a counsellor at law is a person who gives advice and deals with various issues, particularly in legal matters. It is a title often used interchangeably with the title of &quot;lawyer&quot;.

The word &quot;counsel&quot; can also mean advice given outside of the context of the legal profession.

==UK and Ireland==
The legal system in England uses the term &quot;counsel&quot; as an approximate synonym for a barrister-at-law, but not for a solicitor, and may apply it to mean either a single person who pleads a cause, or collectively, the body of barristers engaged in a case.

The difference between &quot;Barrister&quot; and &quot;Counsel&quot; is subtle. In England and Wales, &quot;Barrister&quot; is a professional title awarded by one of the four Inns of Court, and is used in a barrister&#x27;s private, academic or professional capacity. &quot;Counsel&quot; is used to refer to a barrister who is instructed on a particular case. It is customary to use the third person when addressing a barrister instructed on a case: &quot;Counsel is asked to advise&quot; rather than &quot;You are asked to advise&quot;.

The legal term &quot;counsellor&quot;, or more fully, &quot;counsellor-at-law&quot;, became practically obsolete in England, but continued in use locally in Ireland, as an equivalent to &quot;barrister&quot;, where a &quot;Senior Counsel&quot; (S.C.) is equivalent to the UK King&#x27;s Counsel (K.C.)

After they have graduated from University with a law degree, they become a &#x27;junior counsel&#x27;, their work normally is completing most of the paperwork in cases (such as drafting legal documents). After about 10 to 15 years of practising as a junior counsel, a barrister may apply to become a senior counsel. This is sometimes called &quot;taking silk&quot; this because the senior counsel&#x27;s gown was traditionally made of silk. A senior counsel may have the letters SC after his/her name.

==North America==

In the United States of America, the term &quot;counselor-at-law&quot; designates, specifically, an attorney admitted to practice in all courts of law; but as the United States legal system makes no formal division of the legal profession into two classes, as in the United Kingdom, most US citizens use the term loosely in the same sense as &quot;lawyer&quot;, meaning one who is versed in (or practicing) law.

In the United States and Canada, many large and midsize law firms have lawyers with the job title of &quot;counsel&quot;, &quot;special counsel&quot; or &quot;of counsel&quot;. These lawyers are employees of the firm like associates, although some firms have an independent contractor relationship with them. But unlike associates, and more like partners, they generally have their own clients, manage their own files, and may supervise associates.

==Non-legal usage==
The word &quot;counsel&quot; also means advice given by a professional (psychology and social sciences, religious, academic, etc.) regarding the judgment or conduct of another.

<text>The Venerable often shortened to Venerable is a style, title, or epithet used in some Christian churches. The holy person that is titled &quot;the venerable&quot; is often accorded by their spiritual perfection and wisdom.

== Catholic ==
In the Catholic Church, after a deceased Catholic has been declared a servant of God by a bishop and proposed for beatification by the pope, such a servant of God may next be declared venerable (&quot;heroic in virtue&quot;) during the investigation and process leading to possible canonization as a saint. A declaration that a person is venerable is not a pronouncement of their presence in Heaven. The pronouncement means it is considered likely that they are in heaven, but it is possible the person could still be in purgatory. Before one is considered venerable, one must be declared by a proclamation, approved by the pope, to have lived a life that was &quot;heroic in virtue&quot; (the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance). The next steps are beatification, which normally requires a miracle by the intercession of the candidate, from which point the person is referred to as &quot;The Blessed&quot;. The blessed declaration implies the person is in Heaven, experiencing the beatific vision, but this is not a requirement. The canonization is consummated when the person intercedes in a miracle (normally, this is their second intercession) and is declared a saint. Exceptional canonizations exist. The declaration of sainthood is definitive only to the extent that the Catholic Church claims the person died in the state of grace and already enjoys beatific vision. For example, Popes Pius XII and John Paul II were both declared venerable by Pope Benedict XVI in December 2009, and John Paul II was declared a saint in 2014.

Other examples of venerables are Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, Princess Louise of France, Francis Libermann, and Mother Mary Potter.

The 7th/8th-century English monk St Bede was called venerable soon after his death and is still often called &quot;the Venerable Bede&quot; or &quot;Bede the Venerable&quot; despite having been canonized in 1899.

This is also the honorific used for hermits of the Carthusian order in place of the usual term of &quot;reverend&quot;.

== Anglican ==
In the Anglican Communion, &quot;The Venerable&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;the Ven.&quot;) is the style usually given to an archdeacon.

== Eastern Orthodoxy ==
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the term &quot;venerable&quot; is commonly used as the English-language translation of the title given to monastic saints (, ; both Greek and Slavonic forms are masculine).

A monastic saint who was martyred for the Orthodox faith is referred to as a &quot;venerable martyr&quot;.

In the 20th century, some English-language Orthodox sources began to use the term &quot;venerable&quot; to refer to a righteous person who was a candidate for glorification (canonization), most famously in the case of John of Shanghai and San Francisco. This has not altered the original usage of the term in reference to monastic saints.

<doc id="605312" wikidata="Q5480249" url="?curid=605312" title="Francis Blackburne">
<text>Francis Blackburne PC (Ire) KS (11 November 1782 – 17 September 1867) was an Irish judge and eventually became Lord Chancellor of Ireland.

==Background==
Born at Great Footstown in County Meath, he was the son of Richard Blackburne of Great Footstown and nephew of Anthony Blackburne, Deputy Lieutenant and High Sheriff of Meath. His mother, Elizabeth, was the daughter of Francis Hopkins (1724–1778) of Gillstown, County Meath and Darvistown, County Westmeath, a first cousin of Sir Francis Hopkins M.P., 1st Baronet of Athboy, County Meath; they were two of the great-grandsons of Ezekiel Hopkins, Bishop of Derry during the Siege of Derry, by his second wife, Araminta, daughter of John Robartes, 1st Earl of Radnor.

Blackburne was educated in Dublin at the school of Rev. William White before entering Trinity College Dublin in 1798, later winning a scholarship, gold medal (1803) and other distinctions. He finally graduated in 1806 (M.A.) and was a member of the Old Historical Society.

==Judicial career==

He was called to the Irish Bar in 1805 and practised with great success on the home circuit. He was noted for his mastery of all branches of the Law, and his great powers of mental concentration. Blackburne was nominated a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1822, and administered the Insurrection Act in Limerick for two years, effectually restoring order in the district. In 1826, he became the King&#x27;s Third Serjeant-at-law and in 1830 was advanced to the Second Serjeant.

A year later, he was appointed Attorney-General for Ireland in the Whig administration of Earl Grey &#x27;though known to be a tory ... with a view to the Irish administration having a broad political base&#x27; and on this occasion was sworn of the Privy Council of Ireland.

He held the post as Attorney-General until 1834; he was readmitted in 1841 and after serving for a year, became Master of the Rolls in Ireland. As Attorney General he clashed with Daniel O&#x27;Connell, with whom his relations were always bad, when he insisted, against O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s wishes, on the appointment of Abraham Brewster as Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (in effect, a deputy to Brewster himself). Blackburne&#x27;s statement that he &quot;would not tolerate a refusal to ratify the appointment&quot;, is an indication of the influence which could then be wielded by a strong Attorney General. In 1845, he was chosen as Chief Justice of the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench.

Blackburne was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland in February 1852, but was replaced in October. After a break of four years, he became Lord Justice of Appeal in Chancery in Ireland. In 1858, &quot;he was invited by Lord Derby again to become lord chancellor, but he declined on account of his advanced age and failing health. He changed his mind, however, and decided to accept Derby&#x27;s offer but was told that the position had been offered to and accepted by Joseph Napier&quot;.

He was bitterly disappointed, referring to the decision as &quot;a harsh and cruel blow&quot; and a poor reward for the sacrifices he had made. In 1866, he began a second term as Lord Chancellor, which ended with his death in the next year.

Blackburne prosecuted Daniel O&#x27;Connell (who regarded him as a personal enemy) and presided at the trial of William Smith O&#x27;Brien. From 1851, he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dublin.

A devoted member of the Church of Ireland, he opposed any measure hostile to its interests, arguing that an attack on the Church was an attack on the Union itself.

==Family==
In 1809, he married Jane Martley, daughter of William Martley of Ballyfallen, County Meath and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Rothwell of Berford, County Meath. They were the parents of six sons and three daughters, of whom only five outlived their father. Blackburne bought Rathfarnham Castle in 1852, where his family continued to reside for three generations. Their son Edward Blackburne (1823–1902) inherited Rathfarnham.

<doc id="605313" wikidata="Q1995765" url="?curid=605313" title="History of Montreal">
<text>Montreal was established in 1642 in what is now the province of Quebec, Canada. At the time of European contact the area was inhabited by the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, a discrete and distinct group of Iroquoian-speaking indigenous people. They spoke Laurentian. Jacques Cartier became the first European to reach the area now known as Montreal in 1535 when he entered the village of &quot;Hochelaga&quot; on the Island of Montreal while in search of a passage to Asia during the Age of Exploration. Seventy years later, Samuel de Champlain unsuccessfully tried to create a fur trading post but the Mohawk of the Iroquois defended what they had been using as their hunting grounds.

A fortress named Ville Marie was built in 1642 as part of a project to create a French colonial empire. Ville Marie became a centre for the fur trade and French expansion into New France until 1760, when it was surrendered to the British army, following the Montreal Campaign. British immigration expanded the city. The city&#x27;s golden era of fur trading began with the advent of the locally owned North West Company.

Montreal was incorporated as a city in 1832. The city&#x27;s growth was spurred by the opening of the Lachine Canal and Montreal was the capital of the United Province of Canada from 1844 to 1849. Growth continued and by 1860 Montreal was the largest city in British North America and the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Canada. Annexation of neighbouring towns between 1883 and 1918 changed Montreal back to a mostly Francophone city. The Great Depression in Canada brought unemployment to the city, but this waned in the mid-1930s, and skyscrapers began to be built.

World War II brought protests against conscription and caused the Conscription Crisis of 1944. Montreal&#x27;s population surpassed one million in the early 1950s. A new metro system was added, Montreal&#x27;s harbour was expanded, and the St. Lawrence Seaway was opened during this time. More skyscrapers were built along with museums. Montreal&#x27;s international status was cemented by Expo 67 and the 1976 Summer Olympics. A major league baseball team, the Expos, played in Montreal from 1969 to 2004 when the team relocated to Washington, DC. Historically, business and finance in Montreal were under the control of Anglophones. With the rise of Quebec nationalism in the 1970s, many institutions relocated their headquarters to Toronto.

==Pre-contact==

The area known today as Montreal had been inhabited by indigenous peoples for some 8,000 years, while the oldest known artifact found in Montreal proper is about 4,000 years old. By about 1000 A.D., nomadic Iroquoian and other peoples around the Great Lakes began to adopt the cultivation of maize and more settled lifestyles. Some settled along the fertile St. Lawrence River, where fishing and hunting in nearby forests supported a full diet. By the 14th century, the people had built fortified villages similar to those described by Cartier on his later visit.

Historians and anthropologists have had many theories about the people encountered by Cartier, as well as the reasons for their disappearance from the valley about 1580. Since the 1950s, archaeological and linguistic comparative studies have established many facts about the people. They are now called the St. Lawrence Iroquoians and recognized by scholars as distinct from other Iroquoian-language people, such as the Huron or Iroquois of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, although sharing some cultural characteristics. Their language has been called Laurentian, a distinct branch of the family.

==Montreal during the French colonial period==
The first European to reach the area was Jacques Cartier on October 2, 1535. Cartier visited the villages of &quot;Hochelaga&quot; (on Montreal Island) and &quot;Stadacona&quot; (near modern Quebec City), and noted others in the valley which he did not name. He recorded about 200 words of the people&#x27;s language.

Seventy years after Cartier, explorer Samuel de Champlain travelled to Hochelaga, but the village no longer existed, nor was there sign of any human habitation in the valley. At times historians theorized that the people migrated west to the Great Lakes (or were pushed out by conflict with other tribes, including the Huron), or suffered infectious disease. Since the 1950s, other theories have been proposed. The Mohawk had most to gain by moving up from New York into the &quot;Tadoussac&quot; area, at the confluence of the Saguenay and St. Lawrence rivers, which was controlled by local &quot;Montagnais&quot;.

Champlain decided to establish a fur trading post at Place Royal on the Island of Montreal, but the Mohawk, based mostly in present-day New York, successfully defended what had by then become their hunting grounds and paths for their war parties. It was not until 1639 that the French created a permanent settlement on the Island of Montreal, started by tax collector Jérôme le Royer de la Dauversière. Under the authority of the Roman Catholic &quot;Société Notre-Dame de Montréal&quot;, missionaries Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, Jeanne Mance and a few French colonists set up a mission named Ville Marie on May 17, 1642, as part of a project to create a colony dedicated to the Virgin Mary. In 1644, Jeanne Mance founded the Hôtel-Dieu, the first hospital in North America north of Mexico.

Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve was governor of the colony and on January 4, 1648, he granted Pierre Gadois (who was in his fifties) the first concession of land - some . In 1650, Grou family, the lineage of historian Lionel Groulx, arrived from Rouen, France, and established a land holding known as Coulée Grou which is today encompassed by the borough Rivière-des-Prairies–Pointe-aux-Trembles. In November 1653, another 140 Frenchmen arrived to enlarge the settlement.

By 1651, Ville-Marie had been reduced to less than 50 inhabitants by repeated attacks by the Mohawk. Maisonneuve returned to France that year to recruit 100 men to bolster the failing colony. He had already decided that should he fail to recruit these settlers, he would abandon Ville-Marie and move everyone back downriver to Quebec City. (Even 10 years after its founding, the people of Quebec City still thought of Montreal as &quot;une folle entreprise&quot; - a crazy undertaking.) These recruits arrived on 16 November 1653 and essentially guaranteed the evolution of Ville Marie and of all New France. In 1653 Marguerite Bourgeoys arrived to serve as a teacher. She founded Montreal&#x27;s first school that year, as well as the Congrégation de Notre-Dame, which became mostly a teaching order. In 1663, the Sulpician seminary became the new Seigneur of the island.

The first water well was dug in 1658 by settler Jacques Archambault, on the orders of Maisonneuve.

Ville Marie would become a centre for the fur trade and the town was fortified in 1725. The French and Iroquois Wars threatened the survival of Ville-Marie until a peace treaty (see the &quot;Great Peace of Montreal&quot;) was signed at Montreal in 1701. With the Great Peace, Montreal and the surrounding &quot;seigneuries&quot; (Terrebonne, Lachenaie, Boucherville, Lachine, Longueuil, ...) could develop without the fear of Iroquois raids.

Though Quebec was the capital and thus the centre of government activity, Montreal also served a key administrative function in New France. Along with Quebec and Trois-Rivières, Montreal was considered a district of the colony. Before the cour de la jurisdiction royale was established in 1693, the seminary of St Sulpice had administered justice. Montreal also had a local governor who represented the governor general and a commissaire de la marine who acted as the intendant&#x27;s representative. 
While most government positions were appointed, Montreal and the other districts did have some element of democracy, if only briefly. Syndics were elected representatives who attended meetings of the council of Quebec and the Sovereign Council. However, the syndics had little authority and could only raise the concerns of their district&#x27;s residents. This office existed from 1647 until it was eliminated in the 1670s due to government fears over the potential formation of political factions; in lieu of syndics, citizens brought their issues to the commissaire de la marine. Because of their importance to Montreal and New France, merchants were allowed to establish chambers of commerce called bourses and meet regularly to discuss their concerns. A bourse would have collectively chosen a representative to address these issues with the governor and commissaire de la marine.

===Population of Montreal===

The Population of the Island of the Montreal during French rule consisted of both native peoples and the French. When the first census was conducted in the colony in 1666, the French population was 659 with an estimated native population of 1000. According to the sources, this was the only point when the native population was higher than the French population on the Island of Montreal. By 1716, the French population had grown to 4,409 people while the native population was 1,177. The French Population of Montreal began slowly through migration. In 1642 a party of 50 Frenchmen representing the Societe de Notre Dame de Montreal pour la conversion des Sauvages de la Nouvelle France set foot on the island that the Compagnie des Cent Associes donated. The initial settlement had 150 individuals in the first ten years; few remained for long because the site of Montreal was vulnerable to Iroquois attacks. Migration to Montreal increased thereafter; between 1653 and 1659, 200 persons arrived. Eventually approximately 1200 to 1500 migrants settled on the island of Montreal between 1642 and 1714; 75% remained and half of them came before 1670. Migrants came from different regions of France: 65 percent of the migrants were rural; 25 percent of the migrants were from the largest cities of France; 10 percent from smaller urban communities. 

These migrants came from different groups the largest of which were indentured servants, they were half of the males, excluding those still in service that potentially could go home. By 1681, indentured labour had seen its heyday in both the colony and in Montreal, only religious communities and the richest supported engages who performed agricultural labour. Another prominent group of French migrants was soldiers who accounted for a fifth of all migrants. Soldiers who came in the early part of the colony&#x27;s history became the notable residents of Ville-Marie, and eventually Montreal. Migrants from a miscellaneous background, who paid their own way to the colony, were an additional fifth of the migrants to Montreal. Women also came to the colony, ¾ of all women were single, and looking for a husband, these were truly permanent residents since single women and whole families did not intend to return to France. The thirty-one girls who arrived in Montreal with the 1653 and 1659 married within the year, some within weeks of landing. Between 1646 and 1717, 178 French girls were married on the Island of Montreal, 20 percent of the overall permanent settlers. During this period the merchant population was relatively small, a hundred came. This was because Quebec City was the primary place for merchants to migrate to; all the merchants who came to Montreal were related to a resident or another merchant.

During the 17th century there were drastic changes in the demographics of Montreal. In 1666, 56 percent of the population were newcomers to Montreal; by 1681, 66% of Montreal was native-born. There was a male to female sex ratio of 163:100 in 1666, by 1681 it was 133:100. Although, the population of Montreal was still dominated by males, the female population grew. The rural proportion represented two-thirds in the first 40 years. However, by 1715-1730 the urban proportion was about 45 percent. Data from 1681 to 1739 show that the point of equilibrium was reached around 1695, with males accounting for 51.6 percent of the population. This percent of the population was maintained until 1710, through migration that was predominantly male. The infant mortality rates in Montreal grew from 9.8% in 1676 to 18.0% to 1706–1715. Illegitimacy rate for Montreal was 1.87 percent higher than the rest of colony due to the status of the Montreal as a garrison town; some unwed mothers from the countryside would abandon their children in the town. Despite some differences in the pattern of population in comparison to the rest of the colony, Montreal&#x27;s population developed at approximately the same rhythm as that of the whole colony. In the 18th century, the population grew at an even rate of 2.5 percent per annum until 1725 when the growth rate decreased to 0.7 percent per annum.

===Economy of Montreal===
In the 17th century, Montreal acted as a point of trans-shipment and a stopover on the passage to the interior. Due to the rapids upriver from Montreal, free sailing through the Saint-Laurence ended in Montreal. Portages inland were then taken. This effectively made Montreal a major distribution centre rather than a mere trading post. Pelts and merchandise were stocked for distribution inland and out. Montreal lacked moorings in the 17th century, forcing trans-Atlantic vessels with larger capacity to unload at Quebec. Goods from Quebec had to be transported by river between the two towns until the construction of a road in 1735. Montreal remained subservient to Quebec due to its isolation. Trade between Montreal and France remained indirect.

Not long after its establishment, Montreal provided for its own subsistence. However, the colony was still dependent on France for a range of finished products, iron, and salt. Montreal&#x27;s principal import, before the end of the 17th century, was finished fabric. The seigneurs of Montreal who owned large flock organized the manufacture and sale of their wool to compensate for the imports. To the contrary, in the early 18th century, for peasants who kept their own sheep and grew flax, production was limited to their own needs. This led to few weavers and a left no more than 5% of textiles sold in Montreal to be manufactured locally. Louise Dechene states: &quot;There was no market-oriented production of fabrics and, understandably no import of raw materials.&quot;

Guns, shot, bullets, and powder represented 15% of imported cargo. The presence of guns meant that colonies retained the services of blacksmiths, or arquebusiers, to repair guns, manufacture bullets, and perform other duties to relieve dependence on imports. 4-5% of imports were kettles. The kettle at this time took the form of an &quot;easily transportable large copper cauldron&quot;. Knives, scissors, and awls had to be imported. Local production of these items did not begin until approximately 1660. By 1720, all iron tools could be purchased exclusively from colonial blacksmiths. Small stocks of glassware, porcelain, and china were imported as well.

Soon after the founding of the Montreal, when the population numbered 8, the Company of One Hundred Associates gave the city&#x27;s trading rights up to the colonial merchants. The colonial merchants at Montreal formed the &quot;Communaute des Habitants&quot;. Both Indians and Coureurs de Bois supplied furs. The company remained profitable until the Iroquois Wars, where it slipped into semi-bankruptcy. In 1664, The Communaute des Habitants&quot; at Montreal was taken over by the French West India Company. The &quot;compagnie de la colonie&quot; (as the French West India Company were referred to) had significant scale of operations and capital. While the Iroquois Wars did limit trade for a time the Natives were still a lot of trade to be had with them. For example, the Island of Montreal did not have a large native population, but 80,000 natives lived within an 800-kilometre radius of Montreal. 

These natives would come to Montreal on occasion to participate in economic activity. One of these occasions happened every August, as Montreal welcomed hundreds of member of various nations to an annual fur fair which dwindled after 1680; as many as 500 to 1000 natives would attend to get better prices than the voyageurs would offer, and the governor would meet them for a ceremony. They would stay outside of town until late September. There were also some natives who lived on the island and in the settlement of Montreal as permanent residents. There were a couple missions founded in Montreal for natives, such as the 1671 La Montagne Mission by the Sulpicians and the Jesuit at Sault-Saint-Louis (Kahnawake). The mission population rose in the 18th century through natural increase and some newcomers; between 1735 and 1752, Kahnawake contained about 1000 people, as did Lac-des-deux-Montagnes. Montreal had some natives residing within the settlement, even if it was temporary, the Jesuits recorded 76 baptisms in 1643 of native children, and this continued to be recorded until 1653. Despite the presence of natives in the settlement of Montreal there seems to be very little intermixing with only seven registered mixed marriages in Montreal, though the number of actually mixed marriages was probably slightly higher. Native slaves were also a reality in Montreal, there were about 50 or so slaves recorded on the island of Montreal in 1716. Therefore, the presence of Natives was definitely necessary for trade, but the Natives were never really integrated into the city of Montreal itself.

Very little information exists on how the colony of Montreal obtained foodstuffs before 1663. The town of Montreal was too small to act as an important internal market. Though habitants came to Montreal to sell their goods (such as eggs, chickens, vegetables, and other goods), it was never a regional distribution centre for grain. Furthermore, despite a surplus of unsold wheat at the colony, flour and lard were still regularly imported to feed French troops during the seventeenth century. The ineffective use of the wheat surplus remained a contentious issue for the habitants in Montreal and the royalty in France. An intendant explained that:
&quot;The habitants do not grow hemp because they get nothing for it. Wool is plentiful, but there is no market. They have enough to ensure their subsistence, but since they are all in the same position, the cannot make any money, and this prevents them from meeting other needs and keeps them so poor in winter that we have been told that there are men and women who wander about practically naked.&quot;
In the eighteenth century, Montreal was central to the illegal trade of furs. The illegal fur trade can be defined as the &quot;export of furs to any destination other than France&quot;. French merchants carried furs were carried down the Richelieu River to English, Dutch, and the converted Jesuit Iroquois at Albany. The contraband was buried outside the walls of Montreal at the request of merchants in order to avoid more loyal French eyes. Furs were traded illegally between Quebec and Albany, however these instances were less extensive than the illegal trade between Quebec and France or Boston. Some estimates place the furs being illegally traded from Montreal to roughly half or two-thirds of total fur-production at the beginning of the 1700s. Later in the century, records appear to be silent. The presence of English supplies amongst the Iroquois during the period, among other reasons, is given as proof of a continued existence of the illegal fur trade between colonies.

===The design of Montreal===
The organization and building of towns in New France attempted to continue the history of France and had similar designs to the homes and buildings of France. Originally with the lack of stone and the plentiful number of lumber cites like Montreal were almost completely made with wooden buildings designed in the French style. These buildings completely relied on the use of classic French building techniques and many of the craftsmen refused to use anything other than sawn and squared lumber. This caused the natives such as the Iroquoians to view the building methods of the colonists as odd as almost all of their building was done with unfinished materials such as branches, bark and tree trunks. The buildings in the city of Montreal remained wooden until the year 1664 when Louis XIV declared the colony an officially recognized province.

This declaration led to the introduction of ‘king’s engineers’ to New France and to Montreal. This led to actual city layout planning and a shift to stone buildings as well. The government of Montreal helped plan the layout of the city; several aspects of the design of the city in the French colonial period are still present. The Sulpicians, who became the seigneurs of Montreal in 1663, perhaps played the largest role in the early formation of the city. The Sulpicians helped design Montreal&#x27;s chequerboard city plan decided upon in 1671 and with the help of the king&#x27;s engineers the establishment of stone buildings also began. For example, Father Superior of the Sulpicians Dollier de Casson and surveyor Bénigne Basset originally planned Rue Notre Dame to be the main street of Montreal in 1672. The designers themselves were all similar to the Father Superior not architects by profession and so the engineers worked closely with the religious order to design and build Montreal. Casson for example also designed the Old Sulpician Seminary, the oldest standing building in Montreal and home to the oldest gardens in North America, in 1684. 
The lack of architects led to the lack of classical metropolitan form common in France and so many buildings had more basic designs. The workers did improve however and as stonemasons became more skilled and stone more available stone buildings became more common. Stonemasons became the men in charge when in came to building as their resource was of the highest demand and what ever could be done without stone was, this had some unfortunate side effects though as fires in Montreal became common. When more stone was used, the issue arose of cracking as the cold and heat expansion stressed the stone this led to the discovery of a basic plan, which worked for the environment and uniformity in buildings. The roofs in Montreal were designed to be of a sharp pitch and they were topped not with slate, which common in France, but were uncommon in Montreal, and they used cedar shingles and the cheaper method of Canadian-style sheet metal roofing. The Château Ramezay, which was built in 1705 as the residence for then-Governor Claude de Ramezay was built with these building styles.

Canadian-specific architecture in Montreal began to evolve and form after the fire ordinances in 1721, as wood was removed as much as possible from dwellings and left buildings almost completely stone. This also eliminated the common wooden fashionable extras and designs common in France. This caused only churches truly to have any form of decoration on them and caused many of the colonial buildings to be plain. This lack of artistic expression to demonstrate wealth caused many of the wealthy simply to build larger buildings to demonstrate their greatness. This caused a large boom in the demand for stone and an increase in the size of Montreal.

===French military history of Montreal===

In 1645, a fort was established on the island of Montreal and this was the beginning of Montreal&#x27;s military history. The fort was key and effective in repelling the raids of the Iroquois and would become a station for soldiers for years to come. After the arrival of Maisonneuve in the Second Foundation in 1653, Montreal became a front for activity throughout New France and a key launching point for expeditions into the frontier. Montreal did not become reinforced however until after the establishment of New France as a province and the welcoming of the ‘king’s engineers’ who came with the military reinforcements. Many of the expeditions who went out to explore Ontario and the Ohio River Valley would start in Montreal, but much of the time in the beginning they would not make it far or they would be forced to return by hostile native forces.
During the early 1700s, many military expeditions left from Montreal to finally deal with the Hostile natives and to strengthen alliances with the Native allies. This led to one of the most significant events to occur in Montreal during this period was the Great Peace of 1701. The conference took place in August and was between the French and representatives of thirty-nine different Aboriginal nations. For the conference an estimated 2000-3000 people (including roughly 1300 native delegates) entered a theatre south of Pointe-à-Callière to listen to speeches given by French leaders and native chiefs. The French engaged in many Aboriginal gestures of peace, including the burying of hatchets, the exchange of wampum belts, and the use of peace pipes. While the French signed their names using their alphabet, the Aboriginal leaders notably used totem symbols to sign the treaty.

The Great Peace resulted in an end to the Iroquois Wars and, according to historian Gilles Havard, &quot;ostensibly (brought) peace to the vast territory extending from Acadia in the East to the Mississippi in the west, and from James Bay in the north to Missouri in the south&quot;. The French had hoped to form a military frontier with their Native allies along the borders on New France against the advancing British colonies. The military thus established many forts along the ‘borders’ down the Ohio Valley into New Orleans. Many of these such as Detroit relied on Montreal to reinforce them with supplies and military men furthering Montreal&#x27;s military involvement and development.

Due to the importance of Montreal to New France the city walls, a double wall 6.4 metres tall and over three kilometres long was erected in 1737 (after twenty years of construction) to protect the city. Only some of the base of the wall remains today. This helped make Montreal the most militarily capable town in New France, and so when the seven years war started Montreal was declared the military headquarters for operations in the North American Theatre. As the military headquarters, the number of military men in Montreal began to increase and the town itself was further expanded and stressed Montreal for supplies.

In 1757 the number of soldiers and natives stationed in Montreal had gotten so great that Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil the Governor of New France realized they needed to take action on a campaign or the army and the town would begin to suffer from starvation. This led to the great campaign of 1757 and with his large force of native allies and the bronzed soldiery of France General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm moved the large force out of Montreal and left a garrison in its place, relieving the pressure on the city to supply the military slightly. Montcalm was very successful in his military efforts keeping spirits in Montreal high and the people hopeful. After his victory at Carillon, Montcalm returned to Montreal; having just defeated 16,000 British forces Montcalm seemed to be in a good position. This would prove false, because of Montcalm&#x27;s lack of troops in comparison to the British. Learning of an invasion coming over the Saint Laurence, Montcalm took his forces to reinforce Quebec City. Montcalm would die there and Quebec City would be lost, which caused a major shock in Montreal as it now seemed they were doomed and though the city was also briefly established as the capital, but with three British armies headed for it, the town would not last long. In September 1760, the French forces finally capitulated to the British and the French colonial rule ended in Montreal.

==British rule and the American Revolution==
Ville-Marie remained a French settlement until 1760, when Pierre de Rigaud, marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial surrendered it to the British army under Jeffery Amherst after a two month campaign. With Great Britain&#x27;s victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Treaty of Paris in 1763 marked its end, with the French being forced to cede Canada and all its dependencies to the other nation.

As a British colony, and with immigration no longer limited to members of the Roman Catholic religion, the city began to grow from British immigration. American Revolutionists under General Richard Montgomery briefly captured the city during the 1775 invasion of Canada but left when it became obvious they could not hold Canada. Often having suffered loss of property and personal attacks during hostilities, thousands of English-speaking Loyalists migrated to Canada from the American colonies during and after the American Revolution. In 1782, John Molson estimated the population of the city at 6,000. The government provided most with land, settling them in what became Upper Canada (Ontario) to the west, as well as Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to the east. The first Protestant church in Montreal was St. Gabriel&#x27;s, established by a Presbyterian missionary in 1792. With 19th-century immigration, more and more English-speaking merchants and residents continued to arrive in what had by then become known as Montreal. Soon the main language of commerce in the city was English. The golden era of fur trading began in the city with the advent of the locally owned North West Company, the main rival to the primarily British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The first machine shop in Montreal, owned by one George Platt, was in operation before 1809. The census of 1821 numbered 18,767 residents.

The town&#x27;s population was majority Francophones until around the 1830s. From the 1830s, to about 1865, it was inhabited by a majority of Anglophones, most of recent immigration from the British Isles or other parts of British North America. Fire destroyed one quarter of the town on May 18, 1765.

===Scottish contributions===

Scottish immigrants constructed Montreal&#x27;s first bridge across the Saint Lawrence River and founded many of the city&#x27;s great industries, including Henry Morgan&#x27;s department store Morgan&#x27;s, the first in Canada, incorporated within the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in the 1970s; the Bank of Montreal; Redpath Sugar; and both of Canada&#x27;s national railroads. The city boomed as railways were built to New England, Toronto, and the west, and factories were established along the Lachine Canal. Many buildings from this time period are concentrated in the area known today as Old Montreal. Noted for their philanthropic work, Scots established and funded numerous Montreal institutions, such as McGill University, the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec, the High School of Montreal, and the Royal Victoria Hospital.

==The City of Montreal==

Montreal was incorporated as a city in 1832. The city&#x27;s growth was spurred by the opening of the Lachine Canal, which permitted ships to pass by the unnavigable Lachine Rapids south of the island. As the capital of the United Province of Canada from 1844 to 1849, Montreal attracted more English-speaking immigrants: Late Loyalists, Irish, Scottish, and English. The population of Montreal grew from 40,000 in 1841 to 57,000 a decade later.

Riots led by Tories led to the burning of the Provincial Parliament. Rather than rebuild, the government chose Toronto as the new capital of the colony. In Montreal the Anglophone community continued to build McGill, one of Canada&#x27;s first universities, and the wealthy continued to build large mansions at the foot of Mount Royal as the suburbs expanded.

Long before the Royal Military College of Canada was established in 1876, there were proposals for military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a 3-month-long military course in Montreal in 1865 at the School of Military Instruction in Montreal. Established by Militia General Order in 1865, the school enabled Officers of Militia or Candidates for Commission or promotion in the Militia to learn Military duties, drill and discipline, to command a Company at Battalion Drill, to Drill a Company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company&#x27;s Officer. The school was retained at Confederation, in 1867. In 1868, The School of Artillery was formed in Montreal.

===American Civil War===
Montréal&#x27;s status as a major inland port with direct connections to Britain and France made it a valuable asset for both sides of the American Civil War. While Confederate troops secured arms and supplies from the friendly British, Union soldiers and agents spied on their activity while similarly arranging for weapons shipments from France. John Wilkes Booth spent some time in Montréal prior to assassinating President Lincoln, and in one case was said to have drunkenly gallivanted throughout the city telling anyone who would listen of his plan to kill Lincoln. Almost all took him to be a fool. After the War, President of the Confederacy Jefferson Davis stayed at a manor house located at the current site of The Bay on Sainte-Catherine&#x27;s Street West; a plaque commemorating the site was installed on the West wall of the building, on Union Avenue, in 1957 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The plaque was removed in 2017.

===Industrialization===

The Lachine Canal and major new businesses linked the established port of Montreal with continental markets and led to rapid industrialization during the mid-19th century. The economic boom attracted French Canadian labourers from the surrounding countryside to factories in satellite cities such as Saint-Henri and Maisonneuve. Irish immigrants settled in tough working-class neighbourhoods such as Pointe-Saint-Charles and Griffintown, making English and French linguistic groups roughly equal in size. The growing city also attracted immigrants from Italy, and Eastern Europe.

In 1852, Montreal had 58,000 inhabitants and by 1860, Montreal was the largest city in British North America, and it was the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Canada. From 1861 to the Great Depression of 1930, Montreal developed in what some historians call its Golden Age. Saint Jacques Street became the most important economic centre of the Dominion of Canada. The Canadian Pacific Railway made its headquarters there in 1880, and the Canadian National Railway in 1919. At the time of its construction in 1928, the new head office of the Royal Bank of Canada at 360 St. James Street was the tallest building in the British Empire. With the annexation of neighbouring towns between 1883 and 1918, Montreal became a mostly Francophone city again. The tradition of alternating between a francophone and an anglophone mayor began, lasting until 1914.

Montreal shared control of the Canadian securities market with Toronto from the 1850s to the 1970s causing a persistent rivalry between the two. The financiers were Anglophones. However both cities were overshadowed by London and later New York, for they had easy access to these much larger financial centres.

==1914–1939 ==

Montrealers volunteered to serve in the army in the early days of World War I, but most French Montrealers opposed mandatory conscription and enlistment fell off. After the war, the Prohibition movement in the United States turned Montreal into a destination for Americans looking for alcohol. Americans went to Montreal for its drinking, gambling, and prostitution, unrivalled in North America at this time, which earned the city the nickname &quot;Sin City&quot;.

Montreal had a population of 618,000 in 1921, growing to 903,000 in 1941.

The twenties saw many changes in the city and the introduction of new technologies continued to have a prominent impact. The introduction of the car in large numbers began to transform the nature of the city. The world&#x27;s first commercial radio station, XWA began broadcasting in 1920. A huge mooring mast for dirigibles was constructed in St. Hubert in anticipation of trans-Atlantic lighter-than-air passenger service, but only one craft, the R-100, visited in 1930 and the service never developed. However, Montreal became the eastern hub of the Trans-Canada Airway in 1939.

Film production became a part of the city activity. Associated Screen News of Canada in Montreal produced two notable newsreel series, &quot;Kinograms&quot; in the twenties and &quot;Canadian Cameo&quot; from 1932 to 1953. The making of documentary films grew tremendously during World War II with the creation of the National Film Board of Canada, in Montreal, in 1939. By 1945 it was one of the major film production studios in the world with a staff of nearly 800 and over 500 films to its credit including the very popular, &quot;The World in Action&quot; and &quot;Canada Carries On&quot;, series of monthly propaganda films. Other developments in the cultural field included the founding of Université de Montréal in 1919 and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra in 1934. The Montreal Forum, built in 1924 became the home ice rink of the fabled Montreal Canadiens hockey team.

Dr. Wilder Penfield, with a grant from the US Rockefeller Foundation founded the Montreal Neurological Institute at the Royal Victoria Hospital (Montreal), in 1934 to study and treat epilepsy and other neurological diseases. Research into the design of nuclear weapons was conducted at the Montreal Laboratory of the National Research Council of Canada during World War II.

===Great Depression===

Unemployment was high during the Great Depression in Canada in the 1930s. Canada began to recover from the Great Depression in the mid-1930s, and real estate developers began to build skyscrapers, changing Montreal&#x27;s skyline. The Sun Life Building, built in 1931, was for a time the tallest building in the British Commonwealth. During World War II its vaults were used as the hiding place for the gold bullion of the Bank of England and the British Crown Jewels.

With so many men unemployed women had to scrimp on spending to meet the reduced family budget. About a fourth of the workforce were women, but most women were housewives. Denyse Baillargeon uses oral histories to discover how Montreal housewives handled shortages of money and resources during the depression years. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbours for outgrown items, and kept the house colder. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. These strategies, Baillargeon finds, show that women&#x27;s domestic labour—cooking, cleaning, budgeting, shopping, childcare—was essential to the economic maintenance of the family and offered room for economies. Most of her informants also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbours in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid—extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans—to help cousins and in-laws. Half of the Catholic women defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births—the number of births nationwide fell from 250,000 in 1930 to about 228,000 and did not recover until 1940.

===Second World War===

Canada declared war on Germany in September 1939, and the result was an economic boom that ended the last traces of depression. Mayor Camillien Houde protested against conscription. He urged Montrealers to ignore the federal government&#x27;s registry of all men and women because he believed it would lead to conscription. The federal government at Ottawa, considering Houde&#x27;s actions treasonable, incarcerated him in a prison camp in Petawawa, Ontario, for over four years, from 1940 until 1944. That year the government instituted conscription in order to expand the armed forces to confront the Axis Powers. (see Conscription Crisis of 1944).

==The Quiet Revolution and the modernization of Montreal==
By the beginning of the 1960s, a new political movement was rising in Quebec. The newly elected Liberal government of Jean Lesage made reforms that helped francophone Quebecers gain more influence in politics and in the economy, thus changing the city. More francophones began to own businesses as Montreal became the centre of French culture in North America.

From 1962 to 1964, four of Montreal&#x27;s ten tallest buildings were completed: Tour de la Bourse, Place Ville-Marie, the CIBC Building and CIL House. Montreal gained an increased international status due to the World&#x27;s Fair of 1967, known as Expo 67, for which innovative construction such as Habitat was completed. During the 1960s, mayor Jean Drapeau carried upgraded infrastructure throughout the city, such as the construction of the Montreal Metro, while the provincial government built much of what is today&#x27;s highway system. Like many other North American cities during these years, Montreal had developed so rapidly that its infrastructure was lagging behind its needs.

In 1969, a police strike resulted in 16 hours of unrest, known as the Murray Hill riot. Police were motivated to strike because of difficult working conditions caused by disarming separatist-planted bombs and patrolling frequent protests and wanting higher pay. The National Assembly of Quebec passed an emergency law forcing the police back to work. By the time order was restored, 108 people had been arrested.

The 1976 Summer Olympics, officially known as the &quot;Games of the XXI Olympiad&quot;, held in Montreal, was the first Olympics in Canada. The Games helped introduce Quebec and Canada to the rest of the world. The entire province of Quebec prepared for the games and associated activities, generating a resurgence of interest in amateur athletics across the province. The spirit of Québec nationalism helped motivate the organizers; however, the city went $1 billion into debt.

==Quebec Independence Movement ==

At the end of the 1960s, the independence movement in Quebec was in full swing due to a constitutional debate between the Ottawa and Quebec governments. Radical groups formed, most notably the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ). In October 1970, members of the FLQ&#x27;s &quot;Liberation Cell&quot; kidnapped and murdered Pierre Laporte, a minister in the National Assembly, and also kidnapped James Cross, a British diplomat, who was later released. The Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau, ordered the military occupation of Montreal and invoked the War Measures Act, giving unprecedented peacetime powers to police. The social unrest and related events became known as the October Crisis of 1970.

Sovereignty was addressed through the ballot box. The Parti Québécois held two referendums on the question, in 1980 and in 1995. During those decades, about 300,000 English-speaking Quebecers left Quebec. The uncertain political climate caused substantial social and economic impacts, as a significant number of Montrealers, mostly Anglophone, took their businesses and migrated to other provinces. The extent of the transition was greater than the norm for major urban centres. With the passage of Bill 101 in 1977, the government gave primacy to French as the only official language for all levels of government in Quebec, the main language of business and culture, and the exclusive language for public signage and business communication. In the rest of Canada, the government adopted a bilingual policy, producing all government materials in both French and English. The success of the separatist Parti Québécois caused uncertainty over Quebec&#x27;s economic future, leading to an exodus of corporate headquarters to Toronto and Calgary.

In recent years, Quebecois Independence has had a surge of popularity as the Bloc Québécois, the leading Quebecois separatist party, won 7.7% of the vote in the 2019 election which is a 63% increase from the 2015 election.

==Economic recovery==
During the 1980s and early 1990s, Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth than many other major Canadian cities. By the late 1990s, however, Montreal&#x27;s economic climate had improved, as new firms and institutions began to fill the traditional business and financial niches.

As the city celebrated its 350th anniversary in 1992, construction began on two new skyscrapers: 1000 de La Gauchetière and 1250 René-Lévesque. Montreal&#x27;s improving economic conditions allowed further enhancements of the city infrastructure, with the expansion of the metro system, construction of new skyscrapers, and the development of new highways, including the start of a ring road around the island. The city attracted several international organisations that moved their secretariats into Montreal&#x27;s Quartier International: International Air Transport Association (IATA), International Council of Societies of Industrial Design (Icsid), International Council of Graphic Design Associations (Icograda), International Bureau for Children&#x27;s Rights (IBCR), International Centre for the Prevention of Crime (ICPC) and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS). With developments such as Centre de Commerce Mondial (World Trade Centre), Quartier International, Square Cartier, and proposed revitalization of the harbourfront, Montreal is regaining its international position as a world-class city.

==Merger and demerger==
The concept of having one municipal government for the island of Montreal was first proposed by Jean Drapeau in the 1960s. The idea was strongly opposed in many suburbs, although Rivière-des-Prairies, Saraguay (Saraguay) and Ville Saint Michel (now the Saint-Michel neighbourhood) were annexed to Montreal between 1963 and 1968. Pointe-aux-Trembles was annexed in 1982.

In 2001, the provincial government announced a plan to merge major cities with their suburbs. As of January 1, 2002, the entire Island of Montreal, home to 1.8 million people, as well as the several outlying islands that were also part of the Montreal Urban Community, were merged into a new &quot;megacity&quot;. Some 27 suburbs as well as the former city were folded into several boroughs, named after their former cities or (in the case of parts of the former Montreal) districts.

During the 2003 provincial elections, the winning Liberal Party had promised to submit the mergers to referendums. On June 20, 2004, a number of the former cities voted to demerge from Montreal and regain their municipal status, although not with all the powers they once had. The following voted to demerge: Baie-d&#x27;Urfé, Beaconsfield, Côte Saint-Luc, Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Dorval, the uninhabited L&#x27;Île-Dorval, Hampstead, Kirkland, Montréal-Est, Montreal West, Mount Royal, Pointe-Claire, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Senneville, and Westmount. The demergers were effective on January 1, 2006.

Anjou, LaSalle, L&#x27;Île-Bizard, Pierrefonds, Roxboro, Sainte-Geneviève, and Saint-Laurent had majority votes in favour of demerger, but their turnout of voters was insufficient to meet the requirements for the decision, so those former municipalities remained part of Montreal. No referendum was held in Lachine, Montréal-Nord, Outremont, Saint Leonard, or Verdun - nor in any of the boroughs that were part of the former city of Montreal.

The Island of Montreal now has 16 municipalities (the city of Montreal proper plus 15 independent municipalities). The post-demerger city of Montreal (divided into 19 boroughs) has a territory of and a population of 1,583,590 inhabitants (based on 2001 census figures). Compared with the pre-merger city of Montreal, this is a net increase of 96.8% in land area, and 52.3% in population.

The city of Montreal with its current boundaries now has nearly as many inhabitants as the former unified city of Montreal (the recreated suburban municipalities are less densely populated than the core city), but population growth is expected to be slower for some time. Analysts note that the overwhelming majority of industrial sites are located in the territory of the post-demerger city of Montreal. The current city of Montreal is about half the size of the post-1998 merger city of Toronto (both in terms of land area and population).

The 15 recreated suburban municipalities have fewer government powers than they did before the merger. A joint board covering the entire Island of Montreal, in which the city of Montreal has the upper hand, retains many powers.

Despite the demerger referendums held in 2004, controversy continues as some politicians note the cost of demerging. Several studies show that the recreated municipalities will incur substantial financial costs, which will require them to increase taxes (an unanticipated result for the generally wealthier English-speaking municipalities that had voted for demerger). Proponents of the demergers contest the results of such studies. They note that reports from other merged municipalities across the country that show that, contrary to their primary raison d&#x27;être, the fiscal and societal costs of mega-municipalities far exceed any projected benefit.

==Origin of the name==

During the early 18th century, the name of the island came to be used as the name of the town. Two 1744 maps by Nicolas Bellin identified the island as Isle de Montréal and the town as Ville-Marie; but a 1726 map refers to the town as &quot;la ville de Montréal&quot;. The name Ville-Marie soon fell into disuse. Today it is used to refer to the Montreal borough that includes downtown.

In the modern Mohawk language, Montreal is called &quot;Tiohtià:ke&quot;. In Algonquin, it is called &quot;Moniang&quot;.

<doc id="605318" wikidata="Q2046571" url="?curid=605318" title="Benjamin O. Davis Sr.">
<text>Benjamin Oliver Davis Sr. (July 1, 1877 – November 26, 1970) was a career officer in the United States Army. One of the few black officers in an era when American society was largely segregated, in 1940 he was promoted to brigadier general, the army&#x27;s first African American general officer.

A native of Washington, D.C., Davis attended M Street High School, where he obtained his first military experience by participating in the school&#x27;s corps of cadets program. During his senior year, he also enrolled in courses at Howard University, which enabled him to play on the school&#x27;s football team. After his 1898 graduation, Davis served briefly as a second lieutenant in the District of Columbia National Guard before joining the 8th U.S. Volunteer Infantry for the Spanish–American War and receiving his commission as a first lieutenant. After the war, Davis was discharged from the volunteers and joined the regular army as a private. He soon became a non-commissioned officer, and in 1901 passed the commissioning exam and received appointment as a second lieutenant of Cavalry.

Davis served in the Philippine–American War and World War I, in which he demonstrated noteworthy leadership and administrative ability, but found himself frequently shunted to less than desirable assignments as his career progressed. In addition to receiving less prestigious assignments such as professor of military science at historically black colleges because of segregation in the army, as one of only a handful of black officers he also experienced delays in promotions and disapproval of recommendations for professional education such as the United States Army Command and General Staff College. Despite these challenges, Davis worked within the army&#x27;s white hierarchy to attain a record of superior technical and tactical proficiency as he slowly rose through the ranks. He was promoted to colonel in 1930, and commanded the New York National Guard&#x27;s 369th Infantry Regiment (later the 369th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment) from 1938 to 1940.

Though he was near retirement, political considerations during the 1940 United States presidential election, the need to obtain the support of black citizens for U.S. involvement in World War II and Davis&#x27;s own long record of accomplishments led to his promotion to brigadier general. He commanded 4th Cavalry Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division during its organization and training, and also served as acting division commander. He attained the mandatory retirement age of 64 in 1941, but remained on active duty to perform wartime inspections of black units and offer observations and recommendations on policies including racial integration.

Davis retired in 1948 and resided in Washington, D.C. He was a member of the American Battle Monuments Commission from 1953 to 1961. Davis later moved to Chicago to reside with one of his daughters. He died at Great Lakes Naval Hospital on November 26, 1970. Davis was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Davis&#x27;s children included Benjamin O. Davis Jr., the first black general in the United States Air Force.

==Early life and education==
Davis said he was born in Washington, D.C., on July 1, 1877, the third child of Louis P. H. Davis and Henrietta (née Stewart) Davis. Called &quot;Ollie&quot; as a boy, he was raised in the LeDroit Park neighborhood of Washington and attended the Lucretia Mott School.

Davis attended M Street High School in Washington, where he played baseball and football, and was captain of the football team. He also participated in the cadet program, in which city high schools organized military units that competed against each other in marksmanship, drill and ceremony, and other soldier skills. Davis attained the rank of captain as commander of Cadet Company B. During his senior year of high school he took courses at Howard University and played on the school&#x27;s football team. His father, a messenger for the Interior Department, and his mother, a nurse, urged him to enroll in college after high school.

==Early career==
While in high school, Davis received his commission as a second lieutenant in the District of Columbia National Guard&#x27;s Company D, 1st Separate Battalion. After graduating from high school in 1898, Davis planned to enter full-time military service. He applied for admission to the United States Military Academy, and his father hoped the contacts he had made in his government position would enable him to secure an appointment through President William McKinley&#x27;s administration, but the senior Davis was informed that appointing a black cadet was not feasible at that time.

In June 1898, Captain Jesse M. Lee of the 9th United States Volunteer Infantry Regiment, an African American unit raised for the Spanish–American War, recruited Davis and considered him for an officer&#x27;s commission. Davis passed the required physical exam, but Lee withdrew his offer because of Davis&#x27;s youth. He subsequently offered Davis a non-commissioned officer&#x27;s appointment, which Davis rejected. Captain Robertson Palmer, a white officer in the African American 8th U.S. Volunteer Infantry, subsequently offered Davis a commission if Davis helped him recruit the sixty soldiers necessary to man the company Palmer was slated to command. Palmer and Davis quickly recruited their company, and on July 13, 1898, Davis was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 8th U.S. Volunteer Infantry&#x27;s Company G. He was soon appointed as his battalion&#x27;s adjutant, in addition to duty as officer in charge of prisoners awaiting court-martial, and was stationed at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and Chickamauga Park, Georgia, from October 1898 until the regiment was disbanded in March 1899.

Davis was mustered out of the United States Volunteers on March 6, 1899. His parents hoped he would attend college, but on June 18, 1899, he enlisted as a private in Troop I, 9th Cavalry Regiment. Assigned to Fort Duchesne, Utah, he served first as the troop&#x27;s clerk and later as the 3rd Squadron&#x27;s sergeant major. Davis later recounted that among his reading was &quot;Three Roads to a Commission in the U.S. Army&quot; by William P. Burnham, which included details on being commissioned from the ranks, so he continued to pursue his ambition of becoming a regular army officer. In late 1900, Davis&#x27;s unit was commanded by Lieutenant Charles Young, one of a handful of African American officers serving in the U.S. military at that time. Young encouraged Davis and tutored him in the subjects covered on the officer candidate test, especially mathematics, which had been Young&#x27;s weakest subject while a student at the United States Military Academy. In early 1901 Davis passed the physical exam and the battery of tests that were administered at Fort Leavenworth. On February 2, 1901, Davis was commissioned a second lieutenant of Cavalry.

In the spring of 1901, Troop I was posted overseas to serve in the Philippine–American War. In August 1901, Davis assumed officer&#x27;s duties when he was assigned to Troop F, 10th Cavalry. Davis spent a year on the island of Panay as his new regiment fought Filipino insurgents. In September 1901, Troop F was split into separate detachments, with Davis being placed in charge of approximately 25 men who garrisoned the town of Lambunao. While in the Philippines, Davis demonstrated an innate ability to learn foreign languages by becoming fluent in both Spanish and the local Visayan language. He received an &quot;excellent&quot; rating on his first officer evaluation report, and his regimental commander, Colonel Samuel Whiteside, later told Davis that several of the regiment&#x27;s white officers thought so highly of him that they attempted to have him assigned to their units. While Davis was not known for developing personal or emotional bonds with his soldiers, they still regarded him highly, with most describing him as stern with respect to military discipline, but well liked.

Troop F returned to the U.S. in August 1902, and Davis was stationed at Fort Washakie, Wyoming, where he also served for several months with Troop M. He subsequently served as regimental adjutant and commander of several details that performed special duties, including ordnance, engineering, signal, and recruiting. Davis also led several hunting parties on which the garrison relied to supplement their food rations. In organizing hunting parties, Davis endeavored to ensure that each soldier got to participate at least once in order to train them on soldier skills including tracking and land navigation. As Davis&#x27;s service in Wyoming continued, his additional duties included at different times post exchange officer, civilian education officer for enlisted men, and adjutant, quartermaster, and commissary of the Fort Washakie post. He consistently excelled in these assignments, with his efficiency reports routinely indicating his superior management and administrative abilities. Davis also participated in professional development activities including study of the &quot;Cavalry Drill Regulations&quot; and &quot;Small Arms Firing Regulations&quot;, in which he attained such a high level of proficiency during instruction that he was exempted from final testing.

==Continued career==
Davis was promoted to first lieutenant on February 28, 1905. In April 1905, he was assigned to the 10th Cavalry Regiment at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. In September 1905, Davis was assigned as professor of military science and tactics at Wilberforce College, a traditionally black institution of higher learning. Davis disliked the assignment because Wilberforce was a Methodist institution, and he was not religious. When the school&#x27;s president, Joshua H. Jones, questioned Davis&#x27;s absence from church on the first Sunday after arriving at Wilberforce, Davis stated that he had no intention of attending. He also told Jones that if he was unhappy about Davis&#x27;s decision, he should request Davis&#x27;s reassignment, since Davis preferred to serve with his regiment.

Davis and Jones continued to quarrel, with Davis violating protocol through activities including keeping alcoholic beverages in his home, and Jones refusing to allow Davis to teach military science more than three hours per week. The dispute eventually reached the United States Department of War, where investigating officers concluded that Davis had legitimate complaints, but that many of the problems between the two men stemmed from Davis making &quot;excessive demands&quot; of Jones. Davis&#x27;s additional duties while at Wilberforce including serving as the regular army inspector and evaluator of training for the District of Columbia National Guard&#x27;s 1st Separate Battalion. Davis visited the battalion annually during its summer training period so he could provide instruction, supervise training, and inspect readiness. D.C. National Guard leaders appreciated Davis&#x27;s attention and proficiency, and continued to solicit the War Department for his support. As a result, his assignment at Wilberforce and his additional duty with the 1st Separate Battalion were extended for a year after he had completed the usual three-year tour in 1908.

After completing his Wilberforce assignment, Davis served briefly with the 9th Cavalry until November 1909, when he was posted as U.S. military attaché in Liberia. Recommended for the post by U.S. ambassador Ernest A. Lyon, on whom Davis had previously made a favorable impression, in Liberia Davis was responsible for training Liberia&#x27;s military forces as part of a larger U.S. effort to prevent invasion by the European powers during the period of African colonization. Davis&#x27;s judgment was that Liberia&#x27;s military was inept, and that it lacked a coherent command and control structure. Among the events he witnessed was a mutiny in which soldiers threatened Liberia&#x27;s Secretary of War over nonpayment of wages. He also observed Liberia&#x27;s military employ unconventional methods, including subduing a rebellious tribe by starving it into submission. Davis suggested reorganizing Liberia&#x27;s military under an American cadre of two officers and three noncommissioned officers. The proposal was not accepted, but Liberia&#x27;s government subsequently offered Davis an appointment in their military. Davis declined after obtaining a U.S. Department of War opinion that he could not constitutionally serve both countries.

The country&#x27;s climate and the food and water that were then available in Liberia caused Davis to become ill, and in 1911 he requested reassignment. He returned to the United States in November 1911, and in January 1912 was assigned to Troop I, 9th Cavalry, stationed at Fort D.A. Russell, Wyoming. In 1913, the 9th Cavalry was assigned to patrol the Mexican-United States border between Hachita, New Mexico, and Nogales, Arizona, to prevent the cross-border raids that were taking place during the Mexican Revolution, and Davis was assigned to command the regiment&#x27;s Troop B.

In February 1915, Davis was again assigned to Wilberforce College as professor of military science and tactics, and he was promoted to captain in December 1915. In early 1917, Davis requested reassignment to a troop unit, arguing that the circumstances at the college, chiefly friction between its president and him over issues including student discipline, left him unable to perform his duties effectively. The War Department reassigned Davis, but also made its displeasure with Wilberforce&#x27;s president known by not assigning a replacement.

==Later career==
In 1917, Davis was assigned to the 9th Cavalry at Fort Stotsenburg, Philippine Islands. As the army expanded for World War I, Davis was promoted to temporary major in 1917 and temporary lieutenant colonel in 1918. During this posting to the Philippines, Davis successively commanded the regiment&#x27;s Supply Troop, served as post quartermaster, commanded 3rd Squadron and then 1st Squadron, and served as post provost marshal.

After returning to the United States in 1920, Davis returned to his permanent rank of captain, but was soon afterwards promoted to permanent lieutenant colonel. He was then assigned to the traditionally black Tuskegee Institute as professor of military science and tactics. Davis commanded the school&#x27;s Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps program, and was responsible for providing instruction in basic infantry subjects while developing discipline in participants and increasing public awareness of the program. Davis received above-average annual evaluations while in this assignment, and after an inspection at Tuskegee, Fourth Corps Area commander David C. Shanks noted he was favorably impressed with both the ROTC program and Davis&#x27;s leadership.

In 1924, Davis was posted to duty as senior instructor with 2nd Battalion, 372nd Infantry Regiment, an African American unit of the Ohio National Guard, in Cleveland, Ohio. As senior instructor, Davis supervised the development of plans for individual and collective training and oversaw the battalion&#x27;s officers and noncommissioned officers as they provided instruction to the soldiers of their companies. In September 1929, Davis returned to Wilberforce College as professor of military science and tactics and commander of the school&#x27;s ROTC program. In 1930, he was promoted to colonel. In 1931, Davis was again assigned to Tuskegee Institute as professor of military science and tactics and commander of the ROTC program. During the summer months of 1930 to 1933, Davis escorted pilgrimages of black World War I Gold Star mothers and widows to the burial places of their loved ones in Europe. His work on this effort was recognized with letters of commendation from the Secretary of War and the army&#x27;s Quartermaster General.

In April 1938, Davis was assigned as senior instructor of the 369th Regiment a unit of the New York National Guard. Davis served in this assignment only briefly, because in May, Governor Herbert H. Lehman commissioned him as a colonel in the National Guard and appointed him to command the regiment. He took command in July, and led his all-black regiment during its individual and collective training, including annual summer encampments. While he was in command, the 369th Infantry was reorganized as the 369th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment.

==General officer==
With the U.S. military beginning to expand in expectation of entering World War II, several black leaders advocated for the increased enlistment of black soldiers as well as opportunities for commissions and leadership roles that had previously been denied to them. These advocates also pushed for Davis to be promoted to brigadier general. Army leaders did not include Davis on a list of colonels slated for promotion in late 1940, claiming that he was too close to the mandatory retirement age of 64. With President Franklin D. Roosevelt recognizing the need to attract black voters to his campaign for a third term, in late October he reconsidered the decision not to promote Davis and recommended him for advancement to brigadier general, with Roosevelt&#x27;s staff making the claim that Davis had been inadvertently omitted from the original list. Davis was promoted on October 25, 1940, becoming the first African American general officer in the United States Army.

In January 1941, Davis became commanding general of 4th Cavalry Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas. Davis oversaw the brigade&#x27;s preparations for entry into the war, including individual and collective training, and non-commissioned and commissioned officer selection and education. He also served as acting division commander during the absence of his superior, Major General Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. When Davis departed this assignment several months later, Allen attested to Davis&#x27;s superior leadership when he reported to the War Department that 4th Brigade had made a slow start in getting organized and trained, but was finishing strong and would soon be prepared for combat.

In June 1941, General George C. Marshall, the army&#x27;s chief of staff, inquired whether Davis was willing to continue serving beyond his mandatory retirement date in July. Marshall&#x27;s plan was for Davis to serve as an assistant to the army&#x27;s inspector general, with specific responsibility for identifying and resolving concerns arising from the expanded use of segregated black units. Davis accepted, retired on July 31, and was recalled to active duty on August 1. From 1941 to 1944, Davis conducted inspection tours of African American units throughout the army, including visits to the European theater of the war from September to November 1942 and July to November 1944. While serving in the Office of the Inspector General, Davis also served on the Advisory Committee on Negro Troop Policies, where he made recommendations on issues including how many black troops would be enlisted, how many would be trained as officers, and how black units would be employed. In mid-1943, he was assigned as military aide to both outgoing President Edwin Barclay and President-elect William Tubman during a Liberian state visit to the United States.

On November 10, 1944, Davis was reassigned as special assistant to Lieutenant General John C. H. Lee, commander of Communications Zone, European Theater of Operations. While serving in the European Theater of Operations, Davis continued his work to resolve issues related to the employment of black units, including advocating for the greater use of black soldiers as replacement troops for units in combat. After serving in the European Theater of Operations for more than a year, in November 1945 Davis returned to Washington, D.C. In February 1946, he was assigned as assistant to the army&#x27;s inspector general. In July 1947, he was appointed United States special representative to Liberia&#x27;s centennial celebration with the personal rank of ambassador. In October 1947, he was assigned as special assistant to the Secretary of the Army. In this posting, he was responsible for policy review and recommendations with respect to the role of African Americans in the army, including plans for desegregation.

==Retirement and death==
On July 20, 1948, Davis retired in a White House ceremony presided over by President Harry S. Truman. On July 26, 1948, President Truman issued Executive Order 9981 which abolished racial discrimination in the United States armed forces. In retirement, Davis resided in Washington, D.C. From July 1953 to June 1961, he served as a member of the American Battle Monuments Commission. As a member of the commission, he made numerous trips around the United States and to Europe to commemorate veterans and dedicate monuments and memorials. His efforts were a significant part of planning, constructing, and dedicating six military cemeteries in Europe.

Davis later moved to Chicago, where he resided with his daughter Elnora. Davis died at Great Lakes Naval Hospital on November 26, 1970. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 2, Grave E-478-B.

==Race relations and desegregation==
Some historians, including Russell Weigley, regard Davis as a significant figure not for his personal accomplishments, since the army often relegated him to assignments considered less than prestigious, but because his prominence represented an indicator of forward movement for African Americans with respect to equality and desegregation.

Historian Jeffrey L. Jones assessed Davis&#x27;s legacy with respect to race relations as an individual willing to accept a behind the scenes role that enabled him to indirectly advocate for greater equality in the military and society as a whole. Exploited by U.S. military and political leaders during World War II, Davis was aware of the political considerations that helped him ascend to the general officer ranks, but accepted the exploitation because he saw an opportunity to make progress in the country&#x27;s treatment of black people. Once the war ended, Davis was no longer needed, so he was pushed into retirement.

Many of the changes Davis advocated during World War II were considered only temporary by army leaders, but were eventually codified after President Truman moved to desegregate the military. Davis&#x27;s willingness to work within the white hierarchy that then controlled American life, and his subsequent non-participation in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s left him as a less prominent historical figure than he otherwise might have been, but the incremental progress he helped achieve left the army well-positioned for later progress.

==Legacy==
In 1943, Davis was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D. from Atlanta University. The District of Columbia home in which Davis lived during his retirement, 1721 S Street NW, is part of Cultural Tourism DC&#x27;s African American Heritage Trail.

In 1993, Davis was inducted into the Fort Leavenworth Hall of Fame. The hall was created in 1969 and recognizes outstanding soldiers who were stationed at Fort Leavenworth and contributed significantly to the army&#x27;s history, heritage and traditions. In 1997, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32-cent stamp honoring Davis.

In 2003, the Ohio Historical Society emplaced a marker at Wilberforce University to commemorate Davis&#x27;s career. The plaque&#x27;s front and back detail several of his accomplishments, including his service at Wilberforce, regimental command, and promotion to brigadier general.

Benjamin O. Davis Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 311 in Richton Park, Illinois, is named for both the senior and junior Davises.

Davis served at Fort D. A. Russell, Wyoming (now Francis E. Warren Air Force Base) early in his career. In 2022, the base&#x27;s 90th Missile Wing dedicated the officer&#x27;s housing in which Davis resided, Quarters 64, to Davis&#x27;s memory and conducted a ceremony including the unveiling of a commemorative plaque.

==Personal life==
Davis married Elnora Dickerson in 1902. Their daughter Olive was born in 1905, and was the wife of George W. Streator, the editor of &quot;The Pilot&quot;, the magazine of the National Maritime Union. A son, Benjamin O. Davis Jr., was born in 1912. In early 1916, a second daughter was born, but Elnora died a few days later from complications of childbirth; daughter Elnora was named for her. The younger Elnora Davis was the wife of James A. McClendon.

In 1919 Davis married Sarah &quot;Sadie&quot; Overton, an English professor at Wilberforce University. They were married until her death in 1966.

<text>KMOX (1120 AM) is a commercial radio station in St. Louis, Missouri. Owned by Audacy, Inc., it is a 50,000 watt Class A clear-channel station with a non-directional signal. The KMOX studios and offices are on Olive Street at Tucker Boulevard in the Park Pacific Building in St. Louis. KMOX refers to itself as &quot;NewsRadio 1120 - The Voice of St. Louis&quot;. It is considered the first U.S. station to program all talk shows around the clock.

KMOX&#x27;s transmitter is located off Route 162 in Pontoon Beach, Illinois. With a good radio, KMOX&#x27;s nighttime signal can be heard across most of the United States and into Mexico and Canada. However, it is strongest in the Central United States. Its daytime signal provides at least secondary coverage to most of Eastern Missouri and much of Southern Illinois. The station is also heard on KEZK&#x27;s HD2 subchannel and translator 98.7 K254CR. Along with WIL-FM, KMOX is responsible for the activation of the Greater St. Louis Emergency Alert System for hazardous weather, disaster declarations, etc., and is the EAS primary entry point for eastern Missouri and southern Illinois.

==Programming==
KMOX airs a talk radio format with blocks of news every morning and in weekday afternoon drive time. Two local talk shows are heard during the day: &quot;Charlie &amp; Amy&quot; (Charlie Brennan and Amy Marxkors) in late mornings and &quot;The Dave Glover Show&quot; in early afternoons. In the evening, the station airs a local sports show, &quot;Sports Open Line&quot; with Matt Pauley, along with repeats of &quot;Charlie &amp; Amy&quot; and &quot;The Dave Glover Show&quot;. Three nationally syndicated shows run overnight, &quot;Our American Stories with Lee Habeeb&quot;, &quot;The Other Side of Midnight with Frank Morano&quot; and &quot;America in the Morning with John Trout&quot;.

On weekend mornings, all-news blocks start the schedule, followed by programs on money, health, car repair, home improvement and old time radio dramas and comedies. Some weekend shows are paid brokered programming. KMOX is the flagship station of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team and the St. Louis University Billikens men&#x27;s basketball team.

KMOX has a large team of local newscasters and reporters, and airs updates from CBS News Radio at the beginning of most hours. KMOX also has an agreement to share news gathering and weather information with KMOV, the CBS television network affiliate for St. Louis. At one time, KMOX and KMOV (formerly KMOX-TV) were sister stations, both owned by CBS.

==History==
===Early years===

KMOX was started in the early 1920s by a group of businessmen who formed a company known as &quot;The Voice of St. Louis, Inc.&quot; The station&#x27;s owners wanted the call sign KVSL, for &quot;Voice of St. Louis&quot;. The owners also applied for KMO, with MO the abbreviation for Missouri, but those call letters had been in use by another station since 1922, KMO (now KKMO) in Tacoma, Washington. KMOX signed on the air on December 24, 1925. The &quot;X&quot; was added because the starting date was Christmas Eve, or Xmas Eve.

In 1927, the station gave prominent coverage to the Charles Lindbergh flight across the Atlantic in his plane The Spirit of St. Louis. That same year, KMOX became one of the first 16 affiliates of the CBS Radio Network.

Following the establishment of the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), stations were initially issued a series of temporary authorizations starting on May 3, 1927. In addition, stations were informed that if they wanted to continue operating, they needed to file a formal license application by January 15, 1928, as the first step in determining whether they met the new &quot;public interest, convenience, or necessity&quot; standard. On May 25, 1928, the FRC issued General Order 32, which notified 164 stations, including KFQA, also in St. Louis, that &quot;From an examination of your application for future license it does not find that public interest, convenience, or necessity would be served by granting it.&quot; KFQA proposed that instead of maintaining its own transmitting facility, it would share the facilities of an existing station. The FRC initially disapproved of this proposal, and ordered KFQA deleted, but eventually relented, and assigned KMOX to be operated under the dual call sign of KMOX-KFQA.

On November 11, 1928, the FRC made a major reallocation of station transmitting frequencies, as part of a reorganization resulting from its implementation of General Order 40. KMOX was designated a clear-channel station on 1090 kHz. In mid-1930, the dual call sign operation as KMOX-KFQA ended, and the station&#x27;s call sign reverted to just KMOX.

===CBS ownership===
CBS bought KMOX and began the process of getting approval to build a 50,000-watt transmitter tower. When completed, KMOX had a signal that could be heard at night through much of the Central United States. In the early days of radio, KMOX broadcasts had been picked up in Scotland, New Zealand, the Arctic Circle and South Africa.

In 1933, KMOX covered the first post-Prohibition shipment of Budweiser beer leaving the Anheuser-Busch St. Louis brewery for the White House, a story carried nationally by CBS. Through the &quot;Golden Age of Radio,&quot; KMOX carried the CBS schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts. The studios and offices were housed in the Merchandise Mart Building on Washington Street.

On March 29, 1941, KMOX moved from 1090 to 1120 kHz, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA). The agreement required most stations to move their frequencies.

===TV and FM stations===
CBS had planned to have a corporate-owned and operated television station in St. Louis, to pair with KMOX. In 1957, the network originally won an FCC construction permit to build a new station on Channel 11, the last remaining commercial VHF channel in St. Louis. After being approached with an offer, CBS decided in August of that year to instead buy the existing KWK-TV for $4 million. KWK-TV was owned by a group including the publisher of the &quot;St. Louis Globe-Democrat&quot;.

CBS took control of KWK-TV&#x27;s operations that March, and changed its call letters to KMOX-TV, sharing the call sign with AM 1120. The original Viacom purchased KMOX-TV from CBS in 1986. Because of an FCC regulation in place then that prohibited TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different ownership, from sharing the same call sign, Channel 4 changed to KMOV.

KMOX added an FM station on February 12, 1962. It broadcast at 103.3 MHz and mostly simulcast the AM station. By the late 1960s, KMOX-FM was separately programmed, airing an easy listening format, then later shifted to Top 40 as KHTR in 1982, and is currently classic hits KLOU, owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.

In July 1968, CBS opened a new studio and office facility in downtown St. Louis to house KMOX-AM-FM-TV, which until that point had been operating from separate locations. The radio stations had been headquartered near Forest Park. KMOX-TV moved from Cole Street into the new facility, known as One Memorial Drive.

===Talk radio pioneer===
As network programming shifted from radio to television in the 1950s, KMOX switched to a full service format of talk shows, news, and middle of the road (later adult contemporary) music. In 1955, Robert Hyland Jr. became KMOX&#x27;s general manager, a role he held for nearly forty years. It was Hyland who leveraged KMOX&#x27;s relationship with the St. Louis Cardinals, signing many lucrative advertising contracts with local businesses.

Hyland made the decision in 1960 to eliminate the station&#x27;s afternoon music programming, the last of the non-talk shows. That made KMOX the first full-time talk radio station in the country, helping keep KMOX dominance in the St. Louis radio market for many decades. On February 29, 1960, Jack Buck hosted the first &quot;At Your Service&quot; program, which included an interview with former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. That program, like the sports and talk shows that soon followed, pioneered a format for radio featuring news maker interviews, guest appearances, and calls from listeners.

After Hyland died in 1992, Rod Zimmerman was named general manager. He departed in 1998 to manage CBS station WBBM Radio in Chicago.

KMOX picked up &quot;Costas Coast to Coast&quot; in 1994. Also, in July of that year Bob Costas began hosting a sports call-in show on the station.

Karen Carroll was general manager from 1998 until 2003, when Tom Langmyer was promoted to the top position. Langmyer left in 2005 to become vice president/general manager of WGN Radio in Chicago. Dave Ervin managed the station from 2005 to 2008. Becky Domyan later became the Vice President and Market Manager for KMOX and sister stations KEZK and KYKY.

KMOX started broadcasting in HD Radio in May 2006. For many years, KMOX broadcast using C-QUAM&#x27;s AM Stereo technology, but stereo transmissions ended in the spring of 2000.

On January 30, 2012, Jon Grayson&#x27;s &quot;Overnight America&quot;, based at KMOX, and also airing on CBS stations WCCO in Minneapolis and KDKA in Pittsburgh, became a nationally syndicated program with several dozen stations airing it across the country. The syndication was discontinued in 2017, but the show continued to air late nights on KMOX for several more years.

===Entercom/Audacy ownership===
On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on November 17. The Entercom acquisition ended KMOX&#x27;s 88 years of CBS ownership.

KMOX held the distinction of holding the record for consecutive number one Arbitron ratings books in the United States. The station was consistently the top rated radio station in St. Louis since the ratings service began in 1972 until 2010, when WARH took over the top spot in the Arbs. KMOX remains the top rated AM station, consistently in the top ten in the Nielsen ratings for St. Louis.

KMOX carried &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; weekdays for several decades. The program was sometimes pre-empted by St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; afternoon baseball games. Limbaugh was one of the few non-local shows broadcast on the station. It was syndicated by Premiere Networks, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia. KMOX also began carrying two non-local shows overnight, &quot;Our American Stories with Lee Habeeb&quot; and &quot;America in the Morning&quot;. Habeeb is a programmer with the Salem Radio Network. &quot;America in the Morning&quot; is supplied by Westwood One, a subsidiary of Cumulus Media.

For the past 21 years, KMOX has hosted a holiday radio program every year. KMOX personalities perform an old-time radio show in front of a live audience. Some years, the script is from &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.
On March 22, 2021, KMOX added an FM translator on 98.7 MHz, K254CR. It was formerly used for KFTK (AM), then temporarily for KFTK-FM. This translator provides coverage to the city of St. Louis and adjacent communities. KMOX added The Dave Glover Show to the schedule, which aired on KFTK for the previous two years. Following Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s death, the station launched a new, local show hosted by longtime news reporter Carol Daniel in its midday timeslot.

===Sports===

KMOX has had a long history of broadcasting sports. In 1926, it aired the Cardinals-Yankees World Series, and starting the next season the station began airing St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; games.

During the 1930s and 1940s, KMOX was one of several St. Louis stations broadcasting both the Cardinals and St. Louis Browns baseball games. KMOX lost broadcasting rights in 1948 when a new Cardinals radio network was formed by the team, but by the 1950s, it became the flagship station of that network (in part due to its clear channel status).

KMOX&#x27;s most famous sports broadcaster was Jack Buck, who was the station&#x27;s year-round sports director during the years he was also calling baseball and football for the CBS radio and television networks. Another famous announcer was Harry Caray, who did play-by-play for Cardinals&#x27; baseball from 1945 through 1969. Dan Kelly was hired in 1968 to broadcast the new Blues hockey team and became the voice of hockey in the city until his death in 1989: his son John is the team&#x27;s TV commentator today. Bill Wilkerson, the station&#x27;s football caller, was the first black man to be the lead announcer for an NFL team when he took over commentary duties for the football Cardinals in 1973: three years later, he would assume the same position for Mizzou football, where once again he would be one of the first black primary broadcasters in major college athletics, only leaving the post in 1993 when he was poached by KTRS. Bob Costas did play-by-play on KMOX for the Spirits of St. Louis of the American Basketball Association from 1974 until the ABA-NBA merger in June 1976.

At times, the station&#x27;s emphasis had shifted away from broadcasting St. Louis professional sports teams. In 2000, the St. Louis Blues hockey team moved to KTRS after having been on KMOX for all but three of the team&#x27;s 33 seasons (1967–2000), but the games returned starting in the 2006–07 season. The St. Louis Blues moved to WXOS starting in the 2019–2020 season. In 2006, the Cardinals&#x27; broadcasts moved to KTRS after 52 seasons on KMOX (1954–2005) after the team purchased controlling interest in KTRS. On September 1, 2010, the Cardinals announced the return of broadcasts to KMOX, starting in the 2011 baseball season.

KMOX aired University of Missouri Tigers football and basketball games for many years, and was the flagship of their radio network until the 1990s. In 2011, the Tigers moved to KTRS.

The station continues to host sports programming such as &quot;Sports Open Line&quot;. Matt Pauley is the main host.

<text>Thomas O&#x27;Hagan, 1st Baron O&#x27;Hagan, KP, PC (Ire), QC (29 May 18121 February 1885), was an Irish lawyer and judge. He served as Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1868 to 1874 and again from 1880 to 1881.

==Background and education==
O&#x27;Hagan was born in Belfast, the son of Edward O&#x27;Hagan, a merchant, and his wife Mary Bell, daughter of Captain Thomas Bell. He was educated at Royal Belfast Academical Institution, being in his day the only Catholic in the school. In 1836 he was called to the Irish Bar.

==Career==
Between 1838 and 1841 O&#x27;Hagan was the editor of &quot;The Newry Examiner&quot;. In 1840 he moved to Dublin, where he appeared for the repeal party in many political trials, becoming an Irish Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1849. His advocacy of a continuance of the Union with Great Britain, and his appointment as Solicitor-General for Ireland in 1860 and Attorney-General for Ireland in the following year, lost him the support of the Nationalist party, but he was returned to Parliament as Liberal Member of Parliament for Tralee in 1863. In 1865 he was appointed a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland), and in 1868 became Lord Chancellor of Ireland in William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s first administration.

O&#x27;Hagan was the first Roman Catholic to hold the chancellorship since the reign of James II, an Act of Parliament admitting Roman Catholics to the position having been passed in 1867. In 1870 he was created Baron O&#x27;Hagan, of Tullahogue in the County of Tyrone, and held office until the resignation of the ministry in 1874. In 1880 he again became Lord Chancellor on Gladstone&#x27;s return to office, but resigned in 1881.

His tenure as Lord Chancellor saw several major legislative reforms in Ireland, of which the most notable was the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870, providing compensation for tenants in the event of eviction. His first term as Chancellor was also notable for his continual clashes with the other judge of appeal, Jonathan Christian, a bitter-tongued man with a deep contempt for most of his judicial colleagues, including O&#x27;Hagan, who he regarded as lazy and unqualified. Christian even published a letter in &quot;The Times&quot; attacking O&#x27;Hagan and his highly regarded Scottish colleague Lord Blackburn, who had voted to reverse one of his judgments. O&#x27;Hagan for his part seems to have regarded Christian as little more than a nuisance, but on taking up office for his second term, he did not hide his relief that Christian had retired.

On his retirement from office Lord O&#x27;Hagan was in 1882 appointed a Knight of St Patrick, having become Vice Chancellor of the Royal University of Ireland the previous year. He was president of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland between 1867 and 1870.

==Personal life==
Lord O&#x27;Hagan married firstly in 1836 Mary Teeling, daughter of Charles Hamilton Teeling of Belfast. They had a son Charles who died 1896 in Dublin, and two daughters, Frances and Madeline. Mary died in 1868.

He married secondly in 1871 Alice Towneley, daughter and co-heiress of Colonel Charles Towneley of Towneley Park, Burnley, Lancashire, and Lady Caroline Molyneux, daughter of The 2nd Earl of Sefton. They had two sons, Thomas and Maurice, each of whom in turn inherited the title and changed the family name to Towneley-O&#x27;Hagan, and two daughters, Kathleen (who lived to be almost 100) and Mary, who married General Sir Charles Monro, 1st Baronet. Alice inherited the family home, Towneley Park, from her father, but found it too expensive to keep up and sold it to Burnley Corporation in 1901. She died on 20 November 1921.

After the death of John Towneley in 1878, O&#x27;Hagan inherited the Towneley family trustee position at the British Museum.

Lord O&#x27;Hagan died at Hereford House, London, in February 1885, aged 72, and was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin. He was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son, Thomas (1878–1900), and then by another son, Maurice Herbert Towneley (born 1882).

The Liberal Unionist editor of the Belfast &quot;Northern Whig&quot;, Thomas Macknight, who had been a personal friend of O&#x27;Hagan, states in his memoir ULSTER AS IT IS (London, 1896) that he believed O&#x27;Hagan would have opposed William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s conversion to Irish Home Rule had he not died when he did.

O&#x27;Hagan&#x27;s sister Mary was Abbess of the Poor Clare convent at Newry and later at Kenmare. Her biography was written by her protege MF Cusack (1839–1899), &quot;the Nun of Kenmare&quot;.

<doc id="605328" wikidata="Q36934" url="?curid=605328" title="Urartian language">
<text>Urartian or Vannic is an extinct Hurro-Urartian language which was spoken by the inhabitants of the ancient kingdom of Urartu (&quot;Biaini&quot; or &quot;Biainili&quot; in Urartian), which was centered on the region around Lake Van and had its capital, Tushpa, near the site of the modern town of Van in the Armenian highlands, now in the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey. Its past prevalence is unknown. While some believe it was probably dominant around Lake Van and in the areas along the upper Zab valley, others believe it was spoken by a relatively small population who comprised a ruling class.

First attested in the 9th century BCE, Urartian ceased to be written after the fall of the Urartian state in 585 BCE and presumably became extinct due to the fall of Urartu. It must have had long contact with, and been gradually totally replaced by, an early form of Armenian, although it is only in the 5th century CE that the first written examples of Armenian appear.

==Classification==
Urartian is an ergative, agglutinative language, which belongs to the Hurro-Urartian family, whose only other known member is Hurrian. It survives in many cuneiform inscriptions found in the territory of the Kingdom of Urartu. There have been claims of a separate autochthonous script of &quot;Urartian hieroglyphs&quot; but they remain unsubstantiated.

Urartian is closely related to Hurrian, a somewhat better documented language attested for an earlier, non-overlapping period, approximately from 2000 BCE to 1200 BCE, written by native speakers until about 1350 BCE. The two languages must have developed quite independently from approximately 2000 BCE onwards. Although Urartian is not a direct continuation of any of the attested dialects of Hurrian, many of its features are best explained as innovative developments with respect to Hurrian as it is known from the preceding millennium. The closeness holds especially true of the so-called Old Hurrian dialect, known above all from Hurro-Hittite bilingual texts.

The external connections of the Hurro-Urartian languages are disputed. There exist various proposals for a genetic relationship to other language families, e.g. Northeast Caucasian languages, Indo-European languages, or Kartvelian languages, but none of these are generally accepted.

Indo-European, namely Armenian and Anatolian, as well as Iranian and possibly Paleo-Balkan, etymologies have been proposed for many Urartian personal and topographic names, such as the names of kings Arame and Argishti, regions such as Diauehi and Uelikulqi, cities such as Arzashkun, geographical features like the Arșania River, as well as some Urartian vocabulary and grammar. Surviving texts of the language are written in a variant of the cuneiform script called Neo-Assyrian.

==Decipherment==
The German scholar Friedrich Eduard Schulz, who discovered the Urartian inscriptions of the Lake Van region in 1826, made copies of several cuneiform inscriptions at Tushpa, but made no attempt at decipherment. Schulz&#x27;s drawings, published posthumously in 1840 in the &quot;Journal Asiatique&quot;, were crucial in forwarding the decipherment of Mesopotamian cuneiform by Edward Hincks.

After the decipherment of Assyrian cuneiform in the 1850s, Schulz&#x27;s drawings became the basis of the decipherment of the Urartian language. It soon became clear that it was unrelated to any known language, and attempts at decipherment based on known languages of the region failed. The script was deciphered in 1882 by A. H. Sayce. The oldest of these inscriptions is from the time of Sarduri I of Urartu.

Decipherment only made progress after World War I, with the discovery of Urartian-Assyrian bilingual inscriptions at Kelišin and Topzawä.

In 1963, a grammar of Urartian was published by G. A. Melikishvili in Russian, appearing in German translation in 1971. In the 1970s, the genetic relation with Hurrian was established by I. M. Diakonoff.

== Corpus ==
The oldest recorded texts originate from the reign of Sarduri I, from the late 9th century BCE. Texts were produced until the fall of the realm of Urartu, approximately 200 years later.

Approximately two hundred inscriptions written in the Urartian language, which adopted and modified the cuneiform script, have been discovered to date.

==Writing==

=== Cuneiform ===
Urartian cuneiform is a standardized simplification of Neo-Assyrian cuneiform.
Unlike in Assyrian, each sign only expresses a single sound value.
The sign &quot;gi&quot; has the special function of expressing a hiatus, e.g. &quot;u-gi-iš-ti&quot; for &quot;Uīšdi&quot;. A variant script with non-overlapping wedges was in use for rock inscriptions.

===Hieroglyphs===
Urartian was also rarely written in the &quot;Anatolian hieroglyphs&quot; used for the Luwian language. Evidence for this is restricted to Altıntepe.

There are suggestions that besides the Luwian hieroglyphic inscriptions, Urartu also had a native hieroglyphic script.
The inscription corpus is too sparse to substantiate the hypothesis. It remains unclear whether the symbols in question form a coherent writing system, or represent just a multiplicity of uncoordinated expressions of proto-writing or ad-hoc drawings.
What can be identified with a certain confidence are two symbols or &quot;hieroglyphs&quot; found on vessels, representing certain units of measurement: for &quot;aqarqi&quot; and for &quot;ṭerusi&quot;. This is known because some vessels were labelled both in cuneiform and with these symbols.

==Phonology==

Hachikian (2010) gives the following consonants for Urartian inferred both from Urartian writing as well as loans into neighboring languages, mainly Armenian:

The three-way laryngeal contrast for stops and affricates was faithfully represented in Urartian writing, except for the “emphatic” /pʼ/ which the Semitic-based cuneiform writing system did not have a distinct symbol for. Their values are confirmed by loans in Armenian. Urartian voiceless stops and affricates were loaned as voiceless aspirates in Armenian, while Urartian “emphatic” stops are found as unaspirated voiceless stops in Armenian. E.g., Urartian &quot;ul-ṭu&quot; ‘camel’ ↦ Armenian ուղտ &quot;ułt&quot;, Urartian &quot;ṣu-(ú-)pa-&quot; ‘Sophene (toponym)’ ↦ Armenian Ծոփ- &quot;Copʰ-&quot;. Contrasting the last example with Urartian &quot;ṭu-uš-pa-&quot; ‘Tushpa (toponym)’ ↦ Armenian Տոսպ &quot;Tosp&quot;, Hachikian (2010) reconstructs an “emphasis” distinction in the bilabial position.

The cuneiform signs usually transliterated with ‹s, z, ṣ› were not fricatives, but affricates, as again shown by loans in Armenian. E.g., Urartian &quot;ṣa-ri&quot; ‘orchard’ ↦ Armenian ծառ &quot;caṙ&quot; ‘tree’, Urartian &quot;al-zi-&quot; ‘Arzanene (toponym)’ ↦ Armenian Աղձնի- &quot;Ałʒni-&quot;. Urartian ‹š› was loaned into Armenian as /s/: Urartian &quot;ša-ni&quot; ‘kettle’ ↦ Armenian սան &quot;san&quot; ().

The precise phonetics of emphasis is not recoverable. It possibly may have been ejectivization or glottalization /pʼ, tʼ, t͡sʼ, kʼ/ as in Semitic languages of the time and the nearby endemic languages of the Caucasus, or just plain unaspirated (and unvoiced) as in Armenian, in either case, contrasting fully with the respective aspirated and voiced series. Near front vowels, /g/ was palatalized and probably merged with, or at least became perceptibly close to, /j/. A distinct /v/ is suggested by variant spellings alternating between and and by the toponym rendered in Armenian as Վան &quot;Van&quot; ‘Van’ and written &quot;bi-a-i-ni-&quot; in Urartian.

Hachikian (2010) also suggests and . For a phonemic distinct from , there is limited evidence from the Greek rendering of the toponym Κομμαγηνή &quot;Kommagēnḗ&quot; ‘Commagene’ for Urartian &quot;qu-ma-ḫa-&quot;; thus, and were not orthograpically distinguished.

The script distinguishes the vowels &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot;. Hachikian believes that there was an /o/ as well, as reflected in loans such as the rendition of Urartian &quot;ṭu-uš-pa-&quot; ‘Tushpa (toponym)’ as Armenian Տոսպ &quot;Tosp&quot; and Greek Θοσπ- &quot;Thosp-&quot;. There may have been phonemic vowel length, but it is not consistently expressed in the script. Word-finally, the distinction between &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot; is not maintained, so many scholars transcribe the graphically vacillating vowel as a schwa: &quot;ə&quot;, while some preserve a non-reduced vowel (usually opting for &quot;i&quot;). The full form of the vowel appears when suffixes are added to the word and the vowel is no longer in the last syllable: &quot;Argištə&quot; &quot;Argišti&quot; - &quot;Argištešə&quot; &quot;by Argišti (ergative case)&quot;. This vowel reduction also suggests that stress was commonly on the next-to-the-last syllable.

In the morphonology, various morpheme combinations trigger syncope: *&quot;ar-it-u-mə&quot; → &quot;artumə&quot;, *&quot;zaditumə&quot; → &quot;zatumə&quot;, *&quot;ebani-ne-lə&quot; → &quot;ebanelə&quot;, *&quot;turul(e)yə&quot; →&quot; tul(e)yə&quot;.

==Morphology==

===Nominal morphology===

==== Nouns ====
The morphemes which may occur in a noun follow a strict order: 
===== Stem =====
All nouns appear to end in a so-called thematic vowel - most frequently &quot;-i&quot; or &quot;-e&quot;, but &quot;-a&quot; and &quot;-u&quot; also occur. They may also end in a derivational suffix. Notable derivational suffixes are &quot;-ḫə&quot;, forming adjectives of belonging (e.g. &quot;Abiliane-ḫə&quot; &quot;of the tribe Abiliani&quot;, &quot;Argište-ḫə&quot; &quot;son of Argišti&quot;) and &quot;-šə&quot;, forming abstract nouns (e.g. &quot;alsui-šə&quot; &quot;greatness&quot;, &quot;ardi-šə&quot; &quot;order&quot;, &quot;arniu-šə&quot; &quot;deed&quot;).

===== Article =====
The forms of the so-called &quot;article&quot; are &quot;-nə&quot; (non-reduced form &quot;-ne-&quot;) for the singular, &quot;-ne-lə&quot; for the plural in the absolutive case and &quot;-na-&quot; for the other forms of the plural. They are referred to as &quot;anaphoric suffixes&quot; and can be compared to definite articles, although their use does not always seem to match that description exactly. They also obligatorily precede agreement suffixes added through Suffixaufnahme: e.g. &quot;Argište-šə Menua-ḫi-ne-šə&quot; &quot;Argišti (ergative), son of Menua (ergative)&quot;. The plural form can also serve as a general plural marker in non-absolutive cases: &quot;arniuši-na-nə&quot; &quot;by the deeds&quot;.

===== Possessive suffixes =====
The well-attested possessive suffixes are the ones of the first person singular &quot;-ukə&quot; (in non-reduced form sometimes &quot;-uka-&quot;) and of the 3rd person singular &quot;-i(yə)-&quot; (in non-reduced form sometimes &quot;-iya-&quot;): e.g. &quot;ebani-uka-nə&quot; &quot;from my country&quot;, &quot;ebani-yə&quot; &quot;his country&quot;.

===== Number and case suffixes =====
The plural is expressed, above all, through the use of the plural &quot;article&quot; (&quot;-ne-lə&quot; in the absolutive case, &quot;-na-&quot; preceding the case suffix in the oblique cases), but some of the case suffixes also differ in form between the singular and the plural. Therefore, separate plural version of the case suffixes are indicated below separately. The nature of the absolutive and ergative cases is as in other ergative languages (more details in the section &quot;Syntax&quot; below).

Since the &quot;complete&quot; plural forms also include the plural definite article, they appear as &quot;-ne-lə&quot;, &quot;-na-šə&quot;, &quot;-na-wə&quot;, &quot;na-(e)də&quot; or &quot;na-š-tə&quot;, etc.

===== Suffixaufnahme =====
A phenomenon typical of Urartian is Suffixaufnahme - a process in which dependent modifiers of a noun (including genitive case modifiers) agree with the head noun by absorbing its case suffixes. The copied suffixes must be preceded by the article (also agreeing in number with the head). Examples: &quot;Ḫaldi-i-na-wə šešti-na-wə&quot; &quot;for the gates (dative) of [god] Ḫaldi (dative)&quot;, &quot;Argište-šə Menua-ḫi-ne-šə&quot; &quot;Argišti (ergative), son of Menua (ergative)&quot;.

==== Pronouns ====
The known personal pronouns are those of the first and third person singular.

&lt;br&gt;
The first person singular has two different forms for the absolutive case: &quot;ištidə&quot; as the absolutive subject of an intransitive verb, and &quot;šukə&quot; as the absolutive object of a transitive verb. The ergative form is &quot;iešə&quot;. Judging from correspondences with Hurrian, &quot;šu-&quot; should be the base for the &quot;regular&quot; case forms. An enclitic dative case suffix for the first person singular is attested as &quot;-mə&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
The third person singular has the absolutive form &quot;manə&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
As for possessive pronouns, besides the possessive suffixes (1st singular &quot;-uka-&quot; and 3rd singular &quot;-iya-&quot;) that were adduced above, Urartian also makes use of possessive adjectives formed with the suffix &quot;-(u)sə&quot;: 1st singular &quot;šusə&quot;, 3rd singular &quot;masə&quot;.

The encoding of pronominal ergative and absolutive participants in a verb action within the verb is treated in the section on &quot;Verbal morphology&quot; below.

Demonstrative pronouns are &quot;i-nə&quot; (plural base &quot;i-&quot;, followed by article and case forms) and &quot;ina-nə&quot; (plural base &quot;ina-&quot;, followed by article and case forms). A relative pronoun is &quot;alə&quot;.

===Verbal morphology===

The paradigm of the verb is only partially known. As with the noun, the morphemes that a verb may contain come in a certain sequence that can be formalized as the following &quot;verb chain&quot;: 

The meaning of the root complements is unclear. The valency markers express whether the verb is intransitive or transitive. The modal suffix appears in several marked moods (but not in the indicative). The other person suffixes express mostly the absolutive subject or object. It is not clear if and how tense or aspect were signalled.

==== Valency markers ====
The valency markers are &quot;-a-&quot; (rarely &quot;-i-&quot;) for intransitivity and &quot;-u-&quot; for transitivity: for example &quot;nun-a-də&quot; &quot;I came&quot; vs &quot;šidišt-u-nə&quot; &quot;he built&quot;. A verb that is usually transitive can be converted to intransitivity with the suffix &quot;-ul-&quot; before the intransitive valency marker: &quot;aš-ul-a-bə&quot; &quot;was occupied&quot; (vs &quot;aš-u-bə&quot; &quot;I put in [a garrison]&quot;).

==== Person suffixes ====
The person suffixes express the persons of the absolutive subject/object and the ergative subject. When both subject and object are present, a single transitive suffix may expresses a unique combination of persons (e.g. the combination of ergative 3rd singular and absolutive 3rd singular is marked with the suffix &quot;-nə&quot;). The following chart lists the currently ascertained endings, along with gaps for those not yet ascertained (the ellipsis marks the place of the valency vowel):

Examples: &quot;ušt-a-də&quot; &quot;I marched forth&quot;; &quot;nun-a-bə&quot; &quot;he came&quot;; &quot;aš-u-bə&quot; &quot;I put-it in&quot;; &quot;šidišt-u-nə&quot; &quot;he built-it&quot;; &quot;ar-u-mə&quot; &quot;he gave [it] to me&quot;, &quot;kuy-it-u-nə&quot; &quot;they dedicated-it&quot;.

As the paradigm shows, the person suffixes added after the valency vowel express mostly the person of &quot;absolutive&quot; subject/object, both in intransitive and in transitive verbs. The picture is complicated by the fact that the absolutive third person singular is expressed by a different suffix depending on whether the ergative subject is in the first or third person. An additional detail is that when the first-person singular dative suffix &quot;-mə&quot; is added, the third-person singular absolutive suffix &quot;-nə&quot; is dropped. 

The encoding of the person of the absolutive subject/object is present, even though it is also explicitly mentioned in the sentence: e.g. &quot;argište-šə inə arə šu-nə&quot; &quot;Argišti established(-it) this granary&quot;. An exceptional verb is &quot;man-&quot; &quot;to be&quot;, in that it has a transitive valency vowel, and takes no absolutive suffix for the third person singular: &quot;man-u&quot; &quot;it was&quot; vs &quot;man-u-lə&quot; &quot;they were&quot;.

==== Mood marking ====
The imperative is formed by the addition of the suffix &quot;-ə&quot; to the root: e.g. &quot;ar-ə&quot; &quot;give!&quot;.

The jussive or third person imperative is formed by the addition of the suffix &quot;-in-&quot; in the slot of the valency vowel, whereas the persons are marked in the usual way, following an epenthetic vowel &quot;-[i]-&quot;:e.g. &quot;ar-in-[i]-nə&quot; &quot;may he give it&quot;, &quot;ḫa-it-in-nə&quot; &quot;may they take it&quot;.

The modal suffix &quot;-l-&quot;, added between the valency vowel and the person suffixes, participates in the construction of several modal forms:

1. An optative form, also regularly used in clauses introduced with &quot;ašə&quot; &quot;when&quot;, is constructed by &quot;-l-&quot; followed by &quot;-ə&quot; (&quot;-i&quot; in non-reduced form) - the following absolutive person suffix is optional, and the ergative subject is apparently not signalled at all: e.g. &quot;qapqar-u-l-i-nə&quot; &quot;I wanted to besiege-it [the city]&quot;, &quot;urp-u-l-i-nə&quot; or &quot;urp-u-l-ə&quot; &quot;he shall slaughter&quot;.

2. A conditional is expressed by a graphically similar form, which is interpreted by Wilhelm (2008) as &quot;-l-&quot; followed by &quot;-(e)yə&quot;: an example of its use is &quot;alu-šə tu-l-(e)yə&quot; &quot;whoever destroys it&quot;.

3. A desiderative, which may express the wish of either the speaker or the agent, is expressed by &quot;-l-&quot; followed by a suffix &quot;-anə&quot;. The valency marker is replaced by &quot;-i-&quot;: e.g. &quot;ard-i-l-anə&quot; &quot;I want him to give …&quot;, &quot;ḫa-i-l-anə&quot; &quot;it wants to take/conquer …&quot;.

Negation is expressed by the particle &quot;ui&quot;, preceding the verb. A prohibitative particle, also preceding the verb, is &quot;mi&quot;. &quot;mi&quot; is also the conjunction &quot;but&quot;, whereas &quot;e&#x27;ə&quot; is &quot;and (also)&quot;, and &quot;unə&quot; is &quot;or&quot;.

==== Non-finite forms ====
Participles from intransitive verbs are formed with the suffix &quot;-urə&quot;, added to the root, and have an active meaning (e.g. &quot;ušt-u-rə&quot; &quot;who has marched forth&quot;). Participles from transitive verbs are formed with the suffix &quot;-aurə&quot;, and have a passive meaning (e.g. &quot;šidaurə&quot; &quot;which is built&quot;). It is possible that &quot;-umə&quot; is the ending of an infinitive or a verb noun, although that is not entirely clear.

==Syntax==

Urartian is an ergative language, meaning that the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are expressed identically, with the so-called absolutive case, whereas the subject of a transitive verb is expressed with a special ergative case. Examples are: &quot;Argištə nun-a-bi&quot; &quot;Argišti came&quot; vs &quot;Argište-šə arə šu-nə&quot; &quot;Argišti established a granary&quot;. Within the limited number of known forms, no exceptions from the ergative pattern are known.

The word order is usually verb-final, and, more specifically, SOV (where S refers to the ergative agent), but the rule is not rigid and components are occasionally re-arranged for expressive purposes. For example, names of gods are often placed first, even though they are in oblique cases: &quot;Ḫaldi-ə ewri-ə inə E2 Argište-šə Menuaḫini-šə šidišt-u-nə&quot; &quot;For Ḫaldi the lord Argišti, son of Menua, built this temple.&quot; Verbs can be placed sentence-initially in vivid narratives: &quot;ušt-a-də Mana-idə ebanə at-u-bə&quot; &quot;Forth I marched towards Mana, and I consumed the land.&quot; 

Nominal modifiers usually follow their heads (&quot;erelə tarayə&quot; &quot;great king&quot;), but deictic pronouns such as &quot;inə&quot; precede them, and genitives may either precede or follow them. Urartian generally uses postpositions (e.g. &quot;ed(i)-i-nə&quot; &quot;for&quot;, &quot;ed(i)-i-a&quot; - both originally case forms of &quot;edi&quot; &quot;person, body&quot; - &quot;pei&quot; &quot;under&quot;, etc..) which govern certain cases (often ablative-instrumental). There is only one attested preposition, &quot;parə&quot; &quot;to(wards)&quot;. Subordinate clauses are introduced by particles such as &quot;iu&quot; &quot;when&quot;, &quot;ašə&quot; &quot;when&quot;, &quot;alə&quot; &quot;that which&quot;.

==Language sample==
The sample below is from inscription 372 by Menua, son of Ishpuini, based on G. A. Melikishvili&#x27;s corpus of Urartian Cuneiform Inscriptions.

For each sentence, the transliteration is given first, the morphological transcription second, the translation third.






==Shared lexicon with Armenian==

Diakonoff (1985) and Greppin (1991) present etymologies of several Old Armenian words as having a possible Hurro-Urartian origin. Contemporary linguists, such as Hrach Martirosyan, have rejected many of the Hurro-Urartian origins for these words and instead suggest native Armenian etymologies, leaving the possibility that these words may have been loaned into Hurro-Urartian from Armenian, and not vice versa.

*&quot;&quot; &quot;field&quot; from Hurrian &quot;awari&quot; &quot;field&quot; (however, alternate theories suggest that this is an Armenian word from Proto-Indo-European or a Sumerian loan);
*&quot;&quot; &quot;slave girl&quot; from Hurrian &quot;al(l)a(e)ḫḫenne&quot;;
*&quot;&quot; &quot;eagle&quot; from Urartian &quot;Arṣiba&quot;, a proper name with a presumed meaning of &quot;eagle&quot; (more recent scholarship suggests that this is an Armenian word from Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot; which was loaned into Urartian);
*&quot;&quot; &quot;field&quot; from Hurrian &quot;arde&quot; &quot;town&quot; (rejected by Diakonoff and Fournet);
*&quot;&quot; &quot;to reveal one&#x27;s ancestry&quot; from Hurrian &quot;ašti&quot; &quot;woman, wife&quot;;
*&quot;&quot; &quot;tree&quot; from Urartian &quot;ṣârə&quot; &quot;garden&quot; (an alternate etymology suggests that this is an Armenian word from Proto-Indo-European );
*&quot;&quot; (cf. Armenian &quot;Covinar&quot;) &quot;sea&quot; from Urartian &quot;ṣûǝ&quot; &quot;(inland) sea&quot; (an alternate theory suggests that this comes from a Proto-Indo-European );
*&quot;&quot; &quot;grain&quot; from Hurrian &quot;kade&quot; &quot;barley&quot; (rejected by Diakonoff; closer to Greek &quot;kodomeýs&quot; &quot;barley-roaster&quot;);
*&quot;&quot; ~ &quot;&quot; &quot;pine&quot; from Hurrian &quot;māḫri&quot; &quot;fir, juniper&quot;;
*&quot;&quot; &quot;dig, excavate&quot; from Urartian &quot;pile&quot; &quot;canal&quot;, Hurrian &quot;pilli&quot; (rejected by Diakonoff, others have suggested an origin stemming from Proto-Indo-European *bel- (“to dig, cut off?”);
*&quot;&quot; ~ &quot;&quot; &quot;plum&quot; from Hurrian *&quot;s̄all-orə&quot; or Urartian *&quot;šaluri&quot; (cf. Akkadian &quot;šallūru&quot; &quot;plum&quot;);
*&quot;&quot; &quot;kettle&quot; from Urartian &quot;sane&quot; &quot;kettle, pot&quot;;
*&quot;&quot; &quot;sword&quot;, from Urartian &quot;šure&quot; &quot;sword&quot;, Hurrian &quot;šawri&quot; &quot;weapon, spear&quot; (considered doubtful by Diakonoff, contemporary linguists believe this is an Armenian word from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;sharp&quot;);
*&quot;&quot; &quot;spring water&quot; from Hurrian &quot;tarman(l)i&quot; &quot;spring&quot; (an alternate etymology suggests that at least ǰur has an Armenian etymology from Proto-Indo-European );
*&quot;&quot; &quot;camel&quot; from Hurrian &quot;uḷtu&quot; &quot;camel&quot;;
*&quot;&quot; &quot;to destroy&quot; from Urartian &quot;harhar-š-&quot; &quot;to destroy&quot;;
*&quot;&quot; &quot;apple&quot; from Hurrian &quot;ḫinzuri&quot; &quot;apple&quot; (itself from Akkadian &quot;hašhūru&quot;, &quot;šahšūru&quot;).
Arnaud Fournet, Hrach Martirosyan, and Armen Petrosyan propose additional borrowed words of Armenian origin loaned into Urartian and vice versa, including grammatical words and parts of speech, such as Urartian &quot;eue&quot; (&quot;and&quot;), attested in the earliest Urartian texts and likely a loan from Armenian (compare to Armenian &quot;ew&quot; (եւ), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot;). Other loans from Armenian into Urartian include personal names, toponyms, and names of deities.

<text>Clarke University is a private Catholic university in Dubuque, Iowa. It was founded in 1843 as St. Mary&#x27;s Female Academy by Mother Mary Frances Clarke, foundress of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

The campus sits on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River and downtown Dubuque. Clarke offers undergraduate degrees in 19 academic departments with over 40 majors and programs. The university also provides graduate master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees and enrolls approximately 1,200 students.

==History==
What is now known as Clarke University was established in 1843 as St. Mary&#x27;s Female Academy by Irish emigrant Mother Mary Frances Clarke, the founder of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It was one of the first such schools for women built west of the Mississippi River.

In 1881, St. Mary&#x27;s moved to its present location atop Dubuque&#x27;s Seminary Hill (Clarke Drive) and was renamed Mount St. Joseph Academy and College. The college became a liberal arts school in 1901, and the first bachelor&#x27;s degree was awarded in 1904. In 1910, Mt. St. Joseph was chartered by the state of Iowa, becoming a four-year college by 1913. The North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools accredited Mount St. Joseph in 1918. The academy portion of the school closed in 1928 and the college was renamed Clarke College to honor Mary Frances Clarke and her vision for the college written in 1884 to her community of sisters, almost all of whom were instructors: &quot;Let us…keep our schools progressive with the times in which we live…In teaching, we must…endeavor to make [students] think.&quot;

On May 17, 1984, the school experienced a disastrous fire that destroyed four of its main buildings, including the Sacred Heart Chapel. The next day, students hung a large banner reading &quot;Clarke Lives!&quot; on the campus to show solidarity following the disaster. Soon after, the school launched a major reconstruction project to replace the destroyed buildings. By 1986, a new library, music performance hall, chapel, bookstore, administrative offices, and central atrium were dedicated. The massive, glass-enclosed Wahlert Atrium built following the fire has since become the main symbol of the school.

Joanne Burrows, (SC) began her term as president on July 1, 2006, replacing the long-serving Catherine Dunn. On May 12, 2010, she announced that the college would be renamed Clarke University. In 2019 she was succeeded by Thom D. Chesney. After leading the university through the COVID-19 pandemic, Chesney resigned to take a personal sabbatical. The university&#x27;s 17th president is Fletcher Lamkin.

==Campus==
Clarke sits on a campus located atop a prominent hill in Dubuque. The college consists of 16 buildings, an athletic field, and features large, grassy knolls along the south and east sides of campus for areas of study and recreation. The grounds are bounded by West Locust Street on the south, Clarke Crest Court on the north, Clarke Crest Drive on the east, and North Grandview Avenue on the west. Clarke Drive is the &quot;main street&quot; through the campus, bisecting it into &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot; sides. Of Clarke&#x27;s 16 buildings, 15 are located along Clarke Drive, making it a very walkable campus.

== Athletics ==
The Clarke athletic teams are called the Pride. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Heart of America Athletic Conference (HAAC) since the 2016–17 academic year, after spending a season as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) during the 2015–16 school year (as well as during the 2006–07 school year when the school re-joined the NAIA). The Pride previously competed in the defunct Midwest Collegiate Conference (MCC) from 2007–08 to 2014–15 (when the conference dissolved), which they were a member on a previous stint from 1988–89 to 1995–96. Clarke was also a member of the defunct Northern Illinois-Iowa Conference (NIIC) of the NCAA Division III ranks from 1996–97 to 2005–06.

Clarke University women&#x27;s basketball team was the 2022-23 NAIA national champion, defeating defending champion Thomas Moore University 63-52. 

==Transportation==
The University is located west of downtown Dubuque and served by The Jule transit system. The &quot;Orange Route&quot; stops on Clarke Drive and Locust Street connecting the university to downtown Dubuque.

<text>Compulsory arbitration is arbitration of labor disputes which laws of some communities force the two sides, labor and management, to undergo. These laws mostly apply when the possibility of a strike seriously affects the public interest. Some labor contracts make specific provisions for compulsory arbitration should the two sides fail to reach agreement through the regular system of collective bargaining.

==Compulsory arbitration in Australia==
The Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 introduced the rule of law in industrial relations for Australia by establishing the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.

Since 1906 Australia has enforced a system of compulsory arbitration between employers and employees. This statutory system of arbitration, the Industrial Relations Court or Commission, and the Harvester court case underpin the Australian industrial relations system.

This system has been amended since 1983. The former Liberal Party government, led by John Howard, sought to further modify it through WorkChoices. The former Labor government, during the Rudd-Gillard era, sought to re-establish regulation surrounding compulsory arbitration of Australia&#x27;s industrial relations regime through other means.

<doc id="605344" wikidata="Q708661" url="?curid=605344" title="Lindenstraße">
<text>Lindenstraße (literally &quot;Linden Street&quot;) was a long-running German television drama series, broadcast by Das Erste. The first episode aired on 8 December 1985 and since then new episodes were broadcast weekly until 2020. Its last timeslot on Das Erste was Sundays at 18:50. The events of the Sunday episode usually take place on the Thursday before the show. This is a result of the original plan having been to show each episode on a Thursday night. Before the start of the series the programme&#x27;s timeslot was switched to Sunday evening, but Thursday remained the day on which the events are normally shown as taking place, because the original concept of dramatizing the events of daily life as experienced by a group of characters on an ordinary weekday has continued unchanged. Exceptions are the so-called holiday episodes where the events take place on such special occasions as Christmas and Easter; also on important election days (especially general elections to the German Bundestag).

Setting the pace for other soap operas in Germany, the first episodes were mostly met with poor reviews. However, &quot;Lindenstraße&quot; soon became one of the most successful shows on German television.

On 16 November 2018 it was announced that the ARD television programme conference had decided – on cost grounds, despite the programme&#x27;s continuing to attract between two and three million viewers weekly – not to extend its contract with the show&#x27;s producers, &quot;Geißendörfer Film- und Fernsehproduktion&quot;, and that the series would therefore come to an end, after 35 years, in March 2020.

== Development ==

The creator of &quot;Lindenstraße&quot; is Hans W. Geißendörfer, whose company &quot;Geißendörfer Film- und Fernsehproduktion GmbH&quot; (GFF - &quot;Geißendörfer film and TV productions&quot;) still produces the series today. In the beginning, Geißendörfer also directed the series. It is set in Munich, but filmed at the WDR studios in Cologne-Bocklemünd, where an entire outdoor street mock-up of the eponymous Lindenstraße was built. An actual street named &#x27;Lindenstraße&#x27; exists in Munich&#x27;s Harlaching district, but it has nothing to do with the series&#x27; fictional street.

The show is based on the long-running British soap &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, from which it borrows its main premise (the everyday life of a number of neighbours). It tackles topics such as racism, cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, disabilities (both physical and mental), and homosexuality. In 1987, it gained attention for showing the first gay kiss on German television. The show is also known for its prompt incorporation of real-life events and current topics.

United States television actor Larry Hagman made a cameo appearance on &quot;Lindenstraße&quot; on 19 February 2006.

Geißendörfer wrote and directed the first 31 episodes himself. Now, there are different directors that take turns in about 10-episode blocks. The current directors are Herwig Fischer, Kerstin Krause, Dominikus Probst and Iain Dilthey.

There have been many different writers of the show throughout the years. Currently, three authors share the responsibility of writing the episodes: Michael Meisheit, who has been writing for Lindenstraße since 1997, and Irene Fischer, who has been writing for Lindenstraße since 1999. She has also been playing a main character in the series since 1987. In 2013, Geißendörfer&#x27;s daughter Hana Geißendörfer joined the team and the first episodes written by her aired in late April.

== Setting ==
The series is set in the Lindenstraße, a fictional street in Munich. The resident families Beimer-Schiller, Beimer-Ziegler and Zenker, as well as couples without children and communes are very prominent characters in the show. There is also a doctor&#x27;s office, currently run by Dr. Iris Brooks. In the past, it has been run by Dr. Ernesto Stadler, Dr. Carsten Flöter and his stepfather Dr. Ludwig Dressler. There is also a Greek restaurant &quot;Akropolis&quot; and a supermarket.

There are also a few shops in the &quot;Kastanienstraße&quot; (literally &quot;Chestnut Street&quot;), which is at one end of the Lindenstraße. There is an organic food shop called &quot;1 A Bio&quot; (It used to be the chocolate store &quot;Kakao&quot; and the gourmet food shop called &quot;Alimentari&quot;. There is also a café called &quot;Café Bayer&quot; and a travel agency called &quot;Träwel und Iwends&quot; (a pun on the German pronunciation of Travel and Events) as well as the car shop &quot;Die Werkstatt&quot;. There are also several minor characters who live on this street.

On the other end of the Lindenstraße, one can find the &quot;Ulrike-Böss-Straße&quot;. In it is a movie theater (&quot;Astor&quot;), the &quot;Café George&quot; and a hair salon.

== Cast ==
Due to the frequency of social problem topics treated in the series, a high proportion of the characters come from minority groups of diverse kind or live in patchwork relationships. From the Greek Restaurant with its family and a Vietnamese which were there from the beginning, characters and whole families with migration background have come and gone from Italy, Turkey, Eastern Europe etc. The current cast counts three male homosexuals, two of them living in marriage with an adopted son, and one female homosexual with a test-tube baby. There&#x27;s a homeless man, a man in a wheelchair, a child with Down syndrome and so on.

Fans of the series have proclaimed in mild jest that a &quot;normal&quot; family wouldn&#x27;t survive the Lindenstraße. As if to prove this, the model bavarian family Stadler which moved to the street in September 2008 has only one member, the contrarian Grandfather, remaining in the street as of early 2013. He &quot;occupies&quot; a room in a commune otherwise populated by twens. His son, the family father, fled the street after the family mother had a love-affair with his brother. The mother then broke up with the brother and started a new affair with a young immigrant from the Balkans who hid his visa-less family in an apartment in the same house. The younger family daughter, who became a teenage mother after a Lindenstraße resident of her age purposely broke a condom, fell in love with the same immigrant and left the street in shock after finding out that he preferred her mother over herself. The mother and the immigrant then left the street together. The older teenage daughter had more luck and married a widely liked Lindenstraße resident in Las Vegas with whom she started a successful business in the street, only to suddenly die from a food poisoning originating in the Greek restaurant in February 2013.

<doc id="605363" wikidata="Q243469" url="?curid=605363" title="Notochord">
<text>The notochord is an elastic, rod-like structure found in chordates. In chordate vertebrates the notochord is an embryonic structure that disintegrates, as the vertebrae develop, to become the nucleus pulposus in the intervertebral discs of the vertebral column. In non-vertebrate chordates a notochord persists. 

The notochord is derived from the embryonic mesoderm and consists of an inner core of vacuolated cells filled with glycoproteins, covered by two helical collagen-elastin sheaths. It lies longitudinally along the rostral-caudal (head to tail) axis of the body, dorsal to the gut tube, and ventral to the dorsal nerve cord. Some chordate invertebrates, such as tunicates, develop a notochord during the larval stage but lose it through subsequent stages into adulthood.

The notochord is important for signaling the dorso-ventral patterning of cells coming from the mesodermal progenitors. This helps form the precursors needed for certain organs and the embryo to develop. In summary, the notochord plays essential roles in embryonic development.

The notochord provides a directional reference to the surrounding tissue as a midline structure during embryonic development, acts as a precursor for vertebrae and a primitive axial endoskeleton. In aquatic animals it can facilitate tail motion when swimming.

== Presence ==
In cephalochordates (lancelets), the notochord persists throughout life as the main structural support of the body.

In tunicates, the notochord is present only in the larval stage, becoming completely absent in the adult animal, and the notochord is not vacuolated.

In all vertebrates other than the hagfish, the notochord is present only during early embryonic development and is later replaced by the bony and/or cartilaginous vertebral column, with its original structure being integrated into the intervertebral discs as the nucleus pulposus.

== Structure ==
The notochord is a long, rod-like midline structure that develops dorsal to the gut tube and ventral to the neural tube. The notochord is composed primarily of a glycoproteins core that is encased in a sheath of collagen fibers. This is wound into two opposing helices. The glycoproteins are stored in vacuolated, turgid cells, which are covered with caveolae on their cell surface. The angle between these fibers determines whether increased pressure in the core will result in shortening and thickening versus lengthening and thinning.

Alternating contraction of muscle fibers attached to each side of the notochord result in a side-to-side motion resembling stern sculling, which allows locomotion. The stiffened notochord prevents movement through telescoping motion such as that of an earthworm.

==Role in signaling and development==
The notochord plays a key role in signaling and coordinating development. Embryos of modern vertebrates form transient notochord structures during gastrulation. The notochord is found ventral to the neural tube.

Notogenesis is the development of the notochord by epiblasts that form the floor of the amnion cavity. The progenitor notochord is derived from cells migrating from the primitive node and pit. The notochord forms during gastrulation and soon after induces the formation of the neural plate (neurulation), synchronizing the development of the neural tube. On the ventral aspect of the neural groove, an axial thickening of the endoderm takes place. (In bipedal chordates, e.g. humans, this surface is properly referred to as the anterior surface). This thickening appears as a furrow (the chordal furrow) the margins of which anastomose (come into contact), and so convert it into a solid rod of polygonal-shaped cells (the notochord) which is then separated from the endoderm.

In vertebrates, it extends throughout the entire length of the future vertebral column, and reaches as far as the anterior end of the midbrain, where it ends in a hook-like extremity in the region of the future dorsum sellae of the sphenoid bone. Initially, it exists between the neural tube and the endoderm of the yolk-sac; soon, the notochord becomes separated from them by the mesoderm, which grows medially and surrounds it. From the mesoderm surrounding the neural tube and notochord, the skull, vertebral column, and the membranes of the brain and medulla spinalis are developed. Because it originates from the primitive node and is ultimately positioned with the mesodermal space, it is considered to be derived from mesoderm.

A postembryonic vestige of the notochord is found in the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. Isolated notochordal remnants may escape their lineage-specific destination in the nucleus pulposus and instead attach to the outer surfaces of the vertebral bodies, from which notochordal cells largely regress.

=== In amphibians and fish ===
During development of amphibians and fish, the notochord induces development of the hypochord through secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor. The hypochord is a transient structure ventral to the notochord, and is primarily responsible for correct development of the dorsal aorta.

&quot;Notochord flexion&quot;, when the notochord bends to form a part of the developing caudal fin, is a hallmark of an early growth stage of some fish.

=== In humans ===
By the age of 4, all notochord residue is replaced by a population of chondrocyte-like cells of unclear origin. Persistence of notochordal cells within the vertebra may cause a pathologic condition: persistent notochordal canal. If the notochord and the nasopharynx do not separate properly during embryonic development, a depression (Tornwaldt bursa) or Tornwaldt cyst may form. The cells are the likely precursors to a rare cancer called chordoma.

== Neurology ==
Research into the notochord has played a key role in understanding the development of the central nervous system. By transplanting and expressing a second notochord near the dorsal neural tube, 180 degrees opposite of the normal notochord location, one can induce the formation of motor neurons in the dorsal tube. Motor neuron formation generally occurs in the ventral neural tube, while the dorsal tube generally forms sensory cells.

The notochord secretes a protein called sonic hedgehog (SHH), a key morphogen regulating organogenesis and having a critical role in signaling the development of motor neurons. The secretion of SHH by the notochord establishes the ventral pole of the dorsal-ventral axis in the developing embryo.

==Evolution in chordates==

The notochord is the defining feature (synapomorphy) of chordates, and was present throughout life in many of the earliest chordates. Although the stomochord of hemichordates was once thought to be homologous or from a common lineal origin, it is now viewed as analogous, convergent, or from a different lineal origin. Pikaia appears to have a proto-notochord, and notochords are present in several basal chordates such as Haikouella, Haikouichthys, and Myllokunmingia, all from the Cambrian.

The Ordovician oceans included many diverse species of Agnatha and early Gnathostomata which possessed notochords, either with attached bony elements or without, most notably the conodonts, placoderms, and ostracoderms. Even after the evolution of the vertebral column in chondrichthyes and osteichthyes, these taxa remained common and are well represented in the fossils record. Several species (see list below) have reverted to the primitive state, retaining the notochord into adulthood, though the reasons for this are not well understood.

Scenarios for the evolutionary origin of the notochord were comprehensively reviewed by Annona, Holland, and D&#x27;Aniello (2015). They point out that, although many of these ideas have not been well supported by advances in molecular phylogenetics and developmental genetics, two of them have actually been revived under the stimulus of modern molecular approaches (the first proposes that the notochord evolved &quot;de novo&quot; in chordates, and the second derives it from a homologous structure, the axochord, that was present in annelid-like ancestors of the chordates). Deciding between these two scenarios (or possibly another yet to be proposed) should be facilitated by much more thorough studies of gene regulatory networks in a wide spectrum of animals.

=== Post-embryonic retention ===
In most vertebrates, the notochord develops into secondary structures. In other chordates, the notochord is retained as an essential anatomical structure. The evolution of the notochord within the phylum Chordata is considered in detail by Holland and Somorjai (2020). Vertebrates now have spines so they do not need a notochord. 

The following organisms retain a post-embryonic notochord:
* Acipenseriformes (paddlefish and sturgeon)
* Lancelet (Amphioxus)
* Tunicate (larval stage only)
* Hagfish
* Lamprey
* Coelacanth
* African lungfish
* Tadpoles
* Ostracoderms (extinct)

=== Within lancelets ===
The notochord of the lancelet (amphioxus) protrudes beyond the anterior end of the neural tube. This projection serves a second purpose in allowing the animal to burrow within the sediment of shallow waters. There, amphioxus is a filter feeder and spends most of its life partially submerged within the sediment.

<text>The Devil You Know is an album by the industrial alternative rock band Econoline Crush. It was released in Canada in June 1997 by EMI, and in the United States in March 1998 by Restless Records. While they are still only popular in Canada for the most part, this album helped to increase Econoline Crush&#x27;s exposure in the United States more than their previous album.

Tracks 12 through 22 of the album are silent; track 23 consists of a Biblical passage (I Corinthians 13:4-8) recited in Japanese.

==Touring and promotion==
Econoline Crush spent a year on the road supporting the record. They performed with artists such as Green Day, Foo Fighters, The Tea Party, Alice Cooper, and Kiss. When opening for Kiss in Edmonton during their 1997 reunion tour, the band were left devastated when the crowd of 18,000 started chanting &quot;We want Kiss&quot; only a few songs into their set.

==Appearances in other media==
Remixes of &quot;Sparkle and Shine&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Now&quot;, and &quot;Surefire&quot; were featured in the PlayStation game &quot;Sled Storm&quot;. &quot;All That You Are&quot; was used in the pilot episode of Sci-Fi Channel&#x27;s &quot;Being Human&quot;.

==Reception==
Greg Prato of AllMusic called &quot;The Devil You Know&quot; &quot;their best album yet.&quot; He commented that &quot;It could very well prove to be their big U.S. breakthrough (they&#x27;re already stars in Canada)&quot; and believed the music on the album was characterized by &quot;buzzing guitars, frenetic drumming, vocals that alternate between sung and screamed, and subtle electronic experiments.&quot;

==Track listing==
All songs by Trevor Hurst, Robbie Morfitt and Daniel Yaremko except as noted.

Tracks 12 through 22 of the album are silent; track 23 consists of a Biblical passage (I Corinthians 13:4-8) recited in Japanese.

The Japanese version of the CD includes 2 bonus tracks, &quot;Home (Remix)&quot; and &quot;Wicked&quot;.

<doc id="605376" wikidata="Q750593" url="?curid=605376" title="Paradise Lost (band)">
<text>Paradise Lost are an English gothic metal band. Formed in Halifax, West Yorkshire, in 1988, they are considered to be among the pioneers of the death-doom genre, and regarded as the main influence for the later gothic metal movement. As of 2005, Paradise Lost have sold over two million albums worldwide.

Their line-up has remained stable for such a long-standing heavy metal band, consisting of singer Nick Holmes, guitarists Greg Mackintosh and Aaron Aedy, and bassist Steve Edmondson. Holmes and Mackintosh are the principal composers, with almost all of the band&#x27;s songs credited to them. During the years, the band has only changed drummers.
== History ==
=== Early years and Peaceville Records (1988–1991) ===
After their formation in 1988, Paradise Lost released three cassette demos, &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, &quot;Frozen Illusion&quot;, and &quot;Plains of Desolation&quot;, before being signed to Peaceville Records in 1989. They recorded their debut album, &quot;Lost Paradise&quot;, at Academy Music Studio in December of that year. The album was released in February 1990.

In November 1990, Paradise Lost returned to Academy Music Studio to record their second album, &quot;Gothic&quot;, which was released in March 1991. The band began to move away from the death/doom sound of their previous releases by adding keyboards and female vocal accompaniments.

=== Music for Nations (1992–1998) ===
Paradise Lost left Peaceville and were signed to the Music for Nations label and released &quot;Shades of God&quot; in July 1992. The band&#x27;s musical approach continued to evolve with this album as evidenced by the addition of quieter passages in the song&#x27;s compositions, the softening of vocalist Nick Holmes&#x27;s death grunt, and Gregor Mackintosh&#x27;s incorporation of acoustic guitar to his sound. The album contained the song &quot;As I Die&quot;, later released as a single/EP.

In the summer of 1993, the band recorded their fourth album, &quot;Icon,&quot; released in September of the same year. The band continued to develop their sound away from their doom roots and more towards the dynamics and sound of &quot;As I Die&quot; from their previous album. On &quot;Icon&quot;, Nick Holmes abandoned his death grunt and started using a &quot;James Hetfield-style bark&quot;. It was after this album, in December 1994, that original member Matthew Archer quit and was replaced by drummer Lee Morris.

The band entered the studio in January 1995 to record their fifth and most successful album, &quot;Draconian Times&quot;, which was released in June 1995. Mackintosh says about &quot;Draconian Times&quot;, &quot;that it&#x27;s the album by which everything else we do gets judged. Rightly so, as it&#x27;s the backbone of our career and sound&quot;. The album charted in the Top 20 album chart in a number of countries including the UK and Germany.

Following the success of &quot;Draconian Times&quot;, and after four years of continuous touring, the band began to get bored with their signature sound and started to experiment with Depeche Mode-esque synth-pop and electronica. This new direction shaped their next album &quot;One Second,&quot; released in 1997, and was most epitomised by the lead single, &quot;Say Just Words&quot;. The album was one of the band&#x27;s most successful releases, particularly in Northern Europe, cracking the German, Swedish, and Finnish top ten charts.

=== EMI (1999–2001) ===
The band moved to EMI Electrola in Germany for its next album, &quot;Host&quot;, released in 1999, on which they continued to experiment with new sounds, appearing to shed their metal roots. While this album continued to alienate their traditional fanbase in places like the UK, it was their highest charting album in Germany, entering at number 4 on the Album Chart.

On the next album, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Believe in Nothing&quot;, Paradise Lost continued this synth direction but adding rock elements to the music, forcibly by EMI at the time. Due to the loss of creative control, Mackintosh said that the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t really exist for him&quot;.

=== GUN Records (2002–2005) ===
In May 2002, the band signed to GUN Records, and on the album that followed, &quot;Symbol of Life&quot;, the metallic roots of the band began to resurface; the band decided to work with producer Rhys Fulber to reestablish their metal sound. The album included guest musicians Devin Townsend, Jamie Muhoberac, and Lee Dorrian.

In March 2004, Lee Morris left the band due to &quot;personal and musical differences&quot; and was replaced by Jeff Singer.

Paradise Lost released &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, their tenth album, in 2005, also on GUN Records.

=== Century Media (2006–2016) ===
The eleventh album, &quot;In Requiem&quot;, was released in the spring of 2007 on Century Media; it was generally well-accepted and highly rated by both critics and fans, pleased to see the band returning to their heavier, gothic metal sound similar to that of earlier albums like &quot;Draconian Times&quot;. The full-length was preceded by a single, &quot;The Enemy&quot; and on the single, Singer was finally listed as a permanent band member. In a recent video interview, Mackintosh and Holmes revealed that Singer had already auditioned for the band when Archer left, but they chose Morris instead because Singer &quot;had a pink drumkit&quot;.

In November 2007, Century Media released the DVD &quot;Over the Madness&quot;, which documents the impact Paradise Lost has had on gothic metal and provides insight into the mindset and workings of the band. Disc 2 includes further interviews, rehearsal footage, plus backstage and memorabilia sections.

On 13 August 2008, drummer Jeff Singer announced his departure from the band on the Paradise Lost official website. He wanted to be with his family, had an upcoming job, and the then-upcoming South American tour would interfere with that. As a result, Paradise Lost had to cancel the South American tour dates that they had planned. Soon after, on 28 August 2008, the Paradise Lost official website announced that the cancelled South American tour has been reconfirmed and that Mark Heron from Oceansize would take over on drums.

At the beginning of 2009, Paradise Lost recorded an album with producer Jens Bogren at Fascination Street Studios in Örebro, Sweden. At the time there was no full-time replacement for Jeff Singer and drums were played by Swedish drummer Peter Damin. On 16 March 2009, when recording for the album was already finished, the band recruited Adrian Erlandsson (At the Gates, ex-Cradle of Filth) as a full-time drummer for the band.

On 18 June 2009, Paradise Lost officially announced &quot;Faith Divides Us – Death Unites Us&quot; as the title of their album to be released on Century Media Records on 25 September 2009 in Germany, on 28 September 2009 in the rest of Europe and on 6 October 2009 in the US.

Paradise Lost headlined the Jägermeister Stage at Ozzfest 2010 on 18 September 2010.

In late 2011, Paradise Lost began recording its 13th studio album &quot;Tragic Idol&quot; in The Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire. The album was released on 23 April 2012.. Adrian Erlandsson was unable to play a few live shows for this album so the band got Jeff Singer again to fill in.

Paradise Lost performed some of their songs at the &quot;Metal Hammer Golden Gods&quot; awards with Cristina Scabbia on Paradise Lost&#x27;s song &quot;Say Just Words&quot; and with Gus G. of a Black Sabbath cover, &quot;Into the Void&quot;.

On 15 August 2013, the cover and artwork were released for their compilation album of b-sides titled &quot;Tragic Illusion 25&quot;. From September to October 2014, some of the songs from the album were released, such as a new song entitled &quot;Loneliness Remains&quot;, and older songs that were remade such as &quot;Our Savior 2013&quot; from &quot;Lost Paradise&quot; and the self-titled song &quot;Gothic 2013&quot; from &quot;Gothic&quot;. The album was released on 5 November 2013.

On 27 October 2013, it was announced that the writing for the 14th studio album will begin after their 25th-anniversary tour and the recording to the album will start in June 2014. On 29 December 2014, it was revealed that &quot;The Plague Within&quot; would be the title for upcoming album. On 26 January 2015, the release date for 2 June 2015 was announced, along with the producer, Jaime Gomez Arellano and the recording location of Orgone Studios, London. Speaking to Rock Sins, Nick Holmes stated that the new album would have elements of all previous Paradise Lost material including a return to the death/doom of their early output, stating that &quot;there&#x27;s some songs that could&#x27;ve been written in 1989, a couple of really old school doom/death songs which are gonna surprise a couple of people when they hear it&quot;. &quot;The Plague Within&quot; is considered by many traditional fans to be their best and most complete album in many years, as well as being a true return to their signature sound.

=== Nuclear Blast (2016–present) ===
On 1 September 2017, Paradise Lost released their 15th studio album, &quot;Medusa.&quot; The band continued their return to a much heavier, more doomier sound. Singer Nick Holmes said &quot;...definitely our heaviest album; the heaviest we&#x27;ve done&quot;. Medusa was well received by fans and critics alike.

2018 marked the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary and was celebrated through select dates around UK and mainland Europe, including their first gig in the hometown of Halifax, as well as a South and North American tour with Solstafir and The Atlas Moth. In November 2019, Decibel Books issued the band&#x27;s authorised biography, &quot;No Celebration: The Official Story of Paradise Lost&quot;. The book was authored by American journalist David E. Gehlke.

In March 2020, Nuclear Blast announced the release of the group&#x27;s 16th studio album, &quot;Obsidian&quot;, on 15 May. Nick Holmes described it as &quot;one of the most eclectic albums we have done in some time, we have miserable songs, sad songs, slow songs and faster songs. Did I mention miserable?&quot;. First single, &quot;Fall from Grace&quot; premiered on 20 March, along with a music video. The next year, the band released a live album titled &quot;At the Mill&quot;; while the album was recorded live, the band played with no audience due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 7 September 2022, drummer Waltteri Väyrynen was announced to have departed from the band, who found a temporary replacement in drummer Guido Montanarini. Montanarini also performs with Paradise Lost guitarist/keyboardist Gregor Mackintosh in the band Strigoi. Väyrynen since joined Opeth as their permanent drummer.

In October 2022, Mackintosh and Holmes announced the formation of Host, a synth-pop side-project that is &quot;taking the concept of what we attempted to do on the Paradise Lost album &quot;Host&quot; but approaching it in a modern context&quot;. A music video for the single &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Sky&quot; was uploaded to the label&#x27;s YouTube page on 21 October 2022. Their debut album, entitled &quot;IX&quot;, was released on 24 February 2023 via Nuclear Blast.

On 24 March 2023, Paradise Lost announced on their Facebook page that touring drummer Guido Montanarini had become an official member of the band.

In a November 2023 interview with Portugal&#x27;s Metal Global, frontman Nick Holmes said that Paradise Lost have been working on new material for the follow-up to &quot;Obsidian&quot;: &quot;Hopefully at the beginning of next year, we can have a few months downtime so we can actually get working more on the album. But we&#x27;ve got a few songs done. I think we&#x27;ve got a few songs done; we need to review them. So, yeah, we&#x27;ll hopefully write an album next year, anyway. Whether it&#x27;s gonna be recorded [next year], I don&#x27;t know, but hopefully at least written&quot;.

== Style and influences ==
Originally coming from death metal, Paradise Lost exerted a decisive influence on the development of death doom and gothic metal in the early 1990s, with their 1991 album &quot;Gothic&quot; being considered style-defining and name-giving for the latter genre. The apparent influence of the band&#x27;s early releases has been observed in the work of Anathema, Cathedral and Winter. Other bands that have cited Paradise Lost as an influence (or have covered them) include My Dying Bride, Anathema, The Gathering, Amorphis, Cradle of Filth, Katatonia, Moonspell, Lacuna Coil, HIM, Nightwish and many others.

Guitarist Aaron Aedy said, &quot;In Bradford we used to go to a number of clubs where one minute they&#x27;d be playing serious gothic music, and the next minute they&#x27;d have on Kreator or something&quot;. Nick Holmes cited Iron Maiden&#x27;s singer Bruce Dickinson in his main influences along with Metallica for their &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; album. Holmes said that the band&#x27;s early influences were Black Sabbath and Dead Can Dance: &quot;the old Black Sabbath, that&#x27;s, to me, the inspiration for when we started the band&quot;. Guitarist Mackintosh said that he took inspiration from &quot;Tony Iommi a lot&quot; and also &quot;Johnny Marr [...] Jimi Hendrix and classic music&quot;, mixing all these styles with metal music and rock music. Mackintosh also stated that gothic rock was an influence, citing bands like &quot;Southern Death Cult and early Sisters of Mercy, Siouxsie and the Banshees, early Cure&quot;. The band was also influenced by sludge metal band the Melvins, which influenced the band&#x27;s extremely slow tempos. Vocalist Nick Holmes said, &quot;we liked the idea of combining the sort of slower Sabbath riffage, but making it even slower to get the whole doom metal thing going. But honestly, we were so obsessed with the death metal stuff in those days that we didn&#x27;t really venture that far outside our own musical field&quot;.

The band experienced a considerable shift in style between 1997 and 2002, on their albums &quot;One Second&quot; through &quot;Symbol of Life&quot;; &quot;One Second&quot; saw the heavy use of electronics and keyboards and Holmes using clean vocals, with &quot;Host&quot; moving even more towards synthpop / dark wave. &quot;Believe in Nothing&quot; moved the band to a more alternative rock direction, with &quot;Symbol of Life&quot; re-establishing a heavier gothic metal tone. Both Mackintosh and Holmes expressed ambivalence about this period of the band, citing personal problems within the band at the time.

<text>Harold Edward &quot;Red&quot; Grange (June 13, 1903 – January 28, 1991), nicknamed &quot;the Galloping Ghost&quot; and &quot;the Wheaton Iceman&quot;, was an American professional football halfback who played for the Chicago Bears and the short-lived New York Yankees. His signing with the Bears helped legitimize the National Football League (NFL).

Playing college football for the Illinois Fighting Illini, Grange was a three-time consensus All-American and led his team to a national championship in 1923. He was the only unanimous All-American selection in 1924, making him the first player in college football history to receive that honor. The same year, Grange became the first recipient of the Chicago Tribune Silver Football award as the Big Ten Conference&#x27;s most valuable player. In 2008, Grange was named the best college football player of all time by ESPN, and in 2011, he was named the Greatest Big Ten Icon by the Big Ten Network.

Shortly after his final college game in 1925, Grange joined the Bears and the NFL, embarking on a barnstorming tour that raised professional football&#x27;s profile across the country. When his rookie contract expired, he and agent C. C. Pyle formed the American Football League in 1926, with Grange playing for the Yankees. The league lasted just one year before shutting down and the Yankees were assimilated into the NFL. Grange suffered a serious knee injury in 1927 that prevented him from playing the following season, and he returned to the Bears in 1929. He remained with the team until he ended his playing career in 1934, from which he became a backfield coach for the Bears for three seasons.

He is a charter member of both the College and Pro Football Halls of Fame.

==Early life==
Red Grange was born on June 13, 1903, in Forksville, Pennsylvania, a village of about 200 people among lumber camps. His father, Lyle, was the foreman of three lumber camps. His mother died when he was just five years old. For several years, the Grange family lived with relatives until they could finally afford a home of their own in Wheaton, Illinois. In Wheaton, Lyle became the chief of police.

In four years at Wheaton High School, Grange earned 16 varsity letters in football, baseball, basketball, and track; he scored 75 touchdowns and 532 points for the football team. As a high school junior, Grange scored 36 touchdowns and led Wheaton High School to an undefeated season. In his senior year, his team won every game but one in which they lost 39–0 to Scott High School in Toledo, Ohio. Knocked out in this game, Grange remained unconscious for two days, having difficulty speaking when he awoke. Grange was also an all-state track and field runner. In 1920, he was a state champion in the high jump and placed third and fourth in the 100-yard dash and the 220-yard dash, respectively. In 1921, he won the state title in both the long jump and the 100-yard dash, and in 1922, he placed third in the 100-yard dash and won the 220-yard dash. In a 1974 interview with American Heritage Grange stated that he ran the 100-yard dash in 9.8 seconds [at the time this was just one-fifth of a second off the world (and American) records].

To help the family earn money, he took a part-time job as an ice toter for $37.50 per week, a job which helped him to build his core strength and from which he got the nicknames &quot;Ice Man&quot; and &quot;the Wheaton Ice Man.&quot;

==University of Illinois==

After graduation, Grange enrolled at the University of Illinois, where he joined the Zeta Psi fraternity. At first he had planned to compete only in basketball and track, but changed his mind once he arrived and joined coach Bob Zuppke&#x27;s Fighting Illini football team. Grange was the roommate of college basketball player and future college basketball coach John Mauer. Grange also modeled for local men&#x27;s clothing store, Jos. Kuhn and Co., as a floor model, common for Illini athletes at the time, and was an amateur boxer.

Grange played for the team from 1923 to 1925. In his first collegiate football game, he scored three touchdowns against Nebraska. In seven games as a sophomore, he ran for 723 yards and scored 12 touchdowns, and led Illinois to an undefeated season and the Helms Athletic Foundation national championship. His younger brother Garland also played football for the school.

He drew national attention for his performance in the October 18, 1924, game against Michigan, in the grand opening game of the new Memorial Stadium, built as a memorial to Illini students and alumni who had died in World War I. The Michigan Wolverines entered the game as favorites, having won a national title the previous year. Grange returned the opening kickoff for a 95-yard touchdown. He then scored three more touchdowns on runs of 67, 56, and 44 yards, all in the first 12 minutes of the game. In the second half, Grange scored a fifth touchdown on an 11-yard run and also threw a 20-yard touchdown pass. To top it off, playing defense, he intercepted two passes. Michigan coach Fielding Yost said, &quot;All Grange can do is run,&quot; to which Zuppke, referring to a famed opera star of the age, responded, &quot;And all Galli-Curci can do is sing.&quot;

The game inspired Grantland Rice to write this poetic description:
A streak of fire, a breath of flame&lt;br&gt;
Eluding all who reach and clutch;&lt;br&gt;
A gray ghost thrown into the game&lt;br&gt;
That rival hands may never touch;&lt;br&gt;
A rubber bounding, blasting soul&lt;br&gt;
Whose destination is the goal — Red Grange of Illinois!
Chicago sportswriter Warren Brown nicknamed Grange &quot;The Galloping Ghost&quot;. When asked in a 1974 interview, &quot;Was it Grantland Rice who dubbed you the Galloping Ghost?&quot; Grange replied, &quot;No, it was Warren Brown, who was a great writer with the &quot;Chicago American&quot; in those days.&quot;

===1925 season===

Before the 1925 season, Grange was approached by Champaign movie theater owner C. C. Pyle, who asked, &quot;How would you like to make one hundred thousand dollars, maybe even a million?&quot; After Grange agreed, he was told to stay in contact but remain silent on their meeting. Grange and Pyle eventually came to an agreement that they would split all proceeds 60–40, with Pyle paying all promotional expenses out of his share.

Pyle traveled to Chicago to meet Chicago Bears owners George Halas and Edward Sternaman to outline a professional contract for Grange, organizing a barnstorming tour that spanned 19 games and 67 days, including games in Florida. As part of their agreement, the Bears received 50 percent of the ticket gate, while Pyle and Grange got the other half. Pyle returned to Champaign shortly afterwards and let Grange know that arrangements had been made for him to join the Bears after his last game playing for Illinois.

Considering Grange&#x27;s popularity, rumors began surrounding his future after completing his senior year, including professional football and acting. A petition was also created to convince him to run for the Republican Party&#x27;s at-large nomination for the 70th United States Congress; although he was only 22 years old at the time, supporters argued he would be within six months of the minimum age of 25 when the Congress opened in December 1927. Despite the speculation, Grange and those connected with him tried to dodge any inquiries that might affect his college athlete eligibility; when approached about a career in pro football, he denied it. He also turned down a potential college coaching career owing to low pay.

Featuring a roster of mostly sophomores and backups, the Illini opened the season 1–3, including losing 14–0 in the season opener to Nebraska for their first loss at Memorial Stadium. This was followed by a 16–13 win over Butler and two straight losses to Iowa and Michigan; although Grange was contained against Nebraska and Michigan, he scored two touchdowns against Butler and on the opening kickoff against Iowa. During the Michigan game, Zuppke moved Grange to quarterback, but was a &quot;marked man&quot; in the defeat.
In the Illini&#x27;s next game against the University of Pennsylvania, they faced a Quaker team considered one of the best in the eastern United States. In front of 60,000 fans, Grange recorded a career-high 237 yards through deep mud and scored three touchdowns; Penn struggled to keep up, prompting some Illinois lineman to call &quot;Illinois rules the East!&quot; prior to each play. On one play, Grange debuted the flea flicker, a trick play designed by Zuppke in which fullback Earl Britton received the snap from a fake field goal formation, which he threw to right end Chuck Kassel, who lateraled back to Grange and ran for the score. As Illinois won 24–2, Laurence Stallings, a famed war correspondent for the &quot;New York World&quot;, said, &quot;This story&#x27;s too big for me. I can&#x27;t write it.&quot;

Columnist Damon Runyon wrote in his game recap, &quot;This man Red Grange of Illinois is three or four men, and a horse rolled into one for football purposes. He is Jack Dempsey, Babe Ruth, Al Jolson, Paavo Nurmi and Man o&#x27;War. Put them all together. They spell Grange.&quot; When the team returned the next Monday, a contingent of 20,000 that included students and the mayors of Urbana and Champaign greeted them; when Grange tried to dodge the crowd, he was spotted and carried to his fraternity house. After the game, his number 77 was retired by the University of Illinois.

Against the Chicago Maroons, Grange recorded –8 total rushing yards and 64 all-purpose yards in abysmal conditions. The following week against Wabash, he only appeared in the fourth quarter to call signals and did not record stats, as the backups played much of the game.

Grange&#x27;s final college game came against Ohio State in Columbus. Before the game, the &quot;Champaign News-Gazette&quot; conducted an interview with Grange and confronted him about signing a professional contract, which he firmly denied before leaving. In Columbus, Grange restricted himself to his hotel room to avoid the media, including having a teammate impersonate him for a pre-game parade. NFL President Joseph Carr, who had owned the local NFL team Columbus Panhandles, considered attending the game before he was hospitalized with appendicitis. In front of 85,000 fans, Grange recorded 113 rushing yards on 21 carries and 42 passing yards on nine throws as Illinois won 14–9.

In his 20-game college career, Grange ran for 3,362 yards, caught 14 passes for 253 yards, and completed 40 of 82 passes for 575 yards. Of his 31 touchdowns, 16 were from at least 20 yards, with nine from more than 50 yards. He scored at least one touchdown in every game he played but the Nebraska game. He earned All-America recognition three consecutive years and appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on October 5, 1925.

===Statistics===
In 2002, the NCAA published &quot;NCAA Football&#x27;s Finest,&quot; researched and compiled by the NCAA Statistics Service. For Grange they published the following statistics:

==Professional career==

After the 1925 Ohio State game, Grange formally announced his intention to sign with the Chicago Bears, but other NFL teams also expressed interest in signing him. The Rochester Jeffersons made a last-ditch effort to sign him at a salary of $5,000 per game, but were unable to do so, a key factor in the team&#x27;s demise. The New York Giants also reportedly offered $40,000 to him, a claim denied by team executive Harry March while owner Tim Mara noted the NFL did not allow college players to sign with teams and also had limits on how much money a team could offer. Still, Mara visited Chicago the same day that Grange signed with the Bears and secured a game against them in December.

Grange&#x27;s decision was vilified by those in college football; at the time, professional football was viewed as a commercialized, weaker brand of its college counterpart. Head coaches Amos Alonzo Stagg and Yost of the University of Chicago, University of Michigan, University of Illinois athletic director George Huff, and Zuppke were noted opponents. Yost once commented, &quot;I&#x27;d be glad to see Grange do anything else except play professional football.&quot; During their return to their hotel from the Ohio State game, Zuppke repeatedly ordered their taxi driver to take various routes to prolong the ride and allow him to convince Grange to reconsider his decision. In response, Grange questioned why he should not be allowed to be paid for playing football if Zuppke was receiving pay as a coach. The two would not meet again until an Illini team banquet weeks later; during his speech, Zuppke openly criticized Grange, prompting an incensed Grange to leave. In January 1926, Herbert Reed of &quot;The Outlook&quot; wrote an article titled &quot;De-Granging Football&quot; that used Grange&#x27;s surname as a verb: to &quot;grange&quot; a game means to exploit it.

On November 22, he formally hired Pyle as his agent and signed with the Bears. The contract earned him a salary and share of gate receipts that amounted to $100,000, during an era when typical league salaries were less than $100/game. Prior to joining his new teammates, he attended the Bears&#x27; game against the Green Bay Packers at Cubs Park, a game they won 21–0. Former Yale player Tim Callahan also announced he had secured Grange for a December Florida league he had organized.

Grange is the last player to play both college football and in the NFL in the same season. In 1926, the NFL passed the &quot;Red Grange Rule&quot; to forbid further players from doing the same, along with requiring NFL hopefuls&#x27; graduating classes to have left college, though both clauses would be tested in various instances. In 1930, the Bears signed Notre Dame fullback Joe Savoldi although he had withdrawn from school and been kicked off the team, a violation of the Grange Rule&#x27;s graduating class prerequisite. The Bears argued that since Savoldi had been expelled, he was technically no longer a member of his Class of 1931; the team would be fined $1,000 for each game Savoldi played in. The NFL also maintained the rule prohibiting players from appearing in college and NFL games in the same season when TCU running back Kenneth Davis attempted to join the league after being suspended one game into his senior year in 1986.

===The barnstorming tour===
====December tour====

Grange made his National Football League debut on November 26, Thanksgiving Day, against the Chicago Cardinals. With only three days of practice in the Bears&#x27; T formation (he had played in the single wing offense in college), he recorded 92 rushing yards and an interception in the scoreless tie. A crowd of 40,000 attended the game. In the next game against the Columbus Tigers, he threw a touchdown pass and recorded 171 yards as the Bears won 14–7. Shortly after, Britton signed with the Bears, reuniting him with Grange.

In December, the Bears&#x27; schedule grew with eight games between December 2 and 13, including three against local all-star teams. The first game, against the Donnelly All-Stars at Sportsman&#x27;s Park in St. Louis, saw Grange score four touchdowns in a 39–6 blowout. On December 5, he scored two touchdowns including the game-winner against the Frankford Yellow Jackets. The next day, between 65,000 and 73,000 people showed up at the Polo Grounds to watch Grange, helping save the Giants&#x27; franchise from financial debt. Grange scored a touchdown on a 35-yard interception return in the Bears&#x27; 19–7 victory. Offensively, he ran for 53 yards on 11 carries, caught a 23-yard pass, and completed two of three passes for 32 yards. Before their next game against a Washington, D.C. all-star team, Pyle and Grange elected to remain in New York to promote themselves, receiving various endorsements.

In Washington, D.C., the Bears visited President Calvin Coolidge; when he was introduced to the team and shook hands with Grange, Coolidge responded, &quot;Glad to meet you. I always did like animal acts.&quot; Although the Bears defeated Washington 19–0, Grange recorded only 16 rushing yards, no receiving and return yards, failed to complete a pass attempt (including one interception), and missed a field goal.

Despite the victories, the grueling schedule led to a rise in injuries. Grange had been hit in the left arm during the Giants game, causing it to swell by the team&#x27;s next game against the Providence Steam Roller. The pain from the injury was too great for Grange, who could not bring himself to return a punt and allowed it to sail over his head; he was eventually pulled in the 9–6 loss. The match was widely criticized by fans and media, with one article commenting the &quot;Grange bubble appears dangerously near the bursting point. Beneath the withering, pitiless spotlight of publicity, the red-headed youngster&#x27;s fame may melt away like some of his own ice, leaving only a little dank, malodorous saw-dust.&quot; College football figures proclaimed the game as evidence of professional football&#x27;s inferiority; referee E. J. O&#x27;Brien described it as a &quot;dismal failure.&quot; However, others like Princeton and Yale University players Herbert Treat and Carl Flanders defended the sport and the Bears. Flanders added that, in his view, professional football had &quot;a bright future.&quot;

&quot;I was booed for the first time in my football career in the Boston game,&quot; Grange wrote in his autobiography. &quot;It made me aware of something I had never thought of before—that the public&#x27;s attitude toward a professional football player is quite different from the manner in which they view a college gridder. A pro&#x27;s performance is evaluated much more critically and he is less likely to be forgiven when a mistake is made. A pro must deliver, or else.&quot;

Following the game, Grange hired E. B. Cooley as his personal doctor. Cooley was the father of Grange&#x27;s friend and personal adviser Marion &quot;Doc&quot; Cooley, who was serving the position alongside their university classmate Dinty Moore. At Grange&#x27;s father&#x27;s request, his close friend Lyman &quot;Beans&quot; DeWolf also joined the team as a confidant.

The Bears&#x27; next game against a Pittsburgh all-star group saw the team in poor condition; before kickoff, former All-American Bo McMillin visited the team in the locker room and advised Grange to not play upon seeing his arm. At the start, only ten players were on the field, forcing Halas to choose between two injured linemen to serve as the required 11th man; center George Trafton was selected as he was able to at least stand and walk. Trainer Andy Lotshaw, who had never played football, was called upon to play tackle. Twelve minutes into the game, Grange attempted to block for halfback Johnny Mohardt, but suffered a torn ligament and a broken blood vessel in his arm, the latter of which resulted in artery hemorrhaging. The Bears ultimately lost 24–0.

With Grange hurt, Chicago canceled a game against an all-star team in Cleveland, prompting the organizer to sue for breach of contract. Although Grange expressed confidence in playing the next game against the Detroit Panthers, he was forced to miss it after a blood clot developed in his arm; the Bears lost 21–0. The final game of the December tour against the Giants ended in a 9–0 defeat. &quot;No other team before or since has ever attempted such a grueling schedule as the 1925 Bears and I&#x27;m sure never will,&quot; Grange wrote in his autobiography.

In ten games, the Bears went 5–4–1.

====January tour====
On December 21, the Bears traveled to Florida to play in Callahan&#x27;s Florida league. To avoid further injuries like in the first tour, the team elected to have week-long breaks between stretches in which they played games on consecutive days. In their first game four days later against a Coral Gables, Florida team, Grange scored the lone touchdown and recorded 89 rushing yards in the 7–0 win.

In the days leading to the next game against the Tampa Cardinals on January 1, 1926, rumors surfaced of Grange participating in a boxing match, but he did not accept. The evening before the game, Grange, driving a car accompanied by golfers Jim Barnes and Johnny Farrell and Olympic swimmer Helen Wainwright, was arrested for speeding at (the speed limit was ). The four were released after Grange gave the police officer $25. In the Bears&#x27; 17–3 victory over the Cardinals, he scored on a 70-yard touchdown run.

Before departing Tampa, Grange and Pyle invested $17,000 apiece in real estate to capitalize on the Florida land boom of the 1920s, but hurricanes led to the period&#x27;s end. The day after the Cardinals game, the Bears played a Jacksonville team featuring former Stanford All-American Ernie Nevers. Although Nevers excelled in the game, Grange threw a 30-yard touchdown pass in the 19–6 win.

Following a one-week rest period, the Bears took on a Southern-based all-star team in New Orleans. Grange had 136 rushing yards and a touchdown, along with a 51-yard punt return that was nullified by a holding penalty, as the Bears shut out New Orleans 14–0. Afterwards, the team went to Los Angeles to play the Los Angeles Wildcats, led by Washington Huskies football star George &quot;Wildcat&quot; Wilson, an admirer of Grange who agreed to participate as the game offered the chance to play against him. Wilson would also lead future opponents on the tour in San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle. With approximately 65,000 in attendance at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Bears defeated the Tigers 17–7 as Grange scored a touchdown. The Bears followed by winning 14–0 against a team in San Diego, a game in which Grange considered himself &quot;listless throughout&quot; until he recorded a two-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. Against the San Francisco Tigers in Kezar Stadium, he was limited to 41 rushing yards and threw an interception in the 14–9 loss.

In Portland, Grange and Britton combined for five touchdowns, including three by the latter. Grange threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Laurie Walquist and ran 45 yards for a second, but exited the 60–3 win before halftime after getting hurt in a pile-up.

On January 31, a day after the Portland game, the Bears played the Seattle All-Stars. Grange scored two touchdowns (36-yard run and 31-yard pass) and recorded 99 rushing yards in the 34–0 victory, while Wilson and teammate Rollie Corbett suffered injuries; the latter broke his leg, leading to Grange, Pyle, and Wilson establishing a fund to support him. The three donated $50 each.

The Bears went 8–1 in the late December and January tour. Immediately following the Seattle game, Pyle issued Grange&#x27;s final rookie check of $50,000. In his rookie season, Grange made approximately $125,000. &quot;Charlie had kept his word. Now I thought I could go on to make it a million,&quot; Grange wrote in his autobiography.

====Impact on professional football====
Grange&#x27;s barnstorming tours are generally considered to have saved the NFL and professional football, though detractors have criticized this narrative considering his injuries and unimpressive performances.

In a February 1926 article, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Don Maxwell wrote that although Grange was typically outperformed by his teammates while attendance for the Florida games was poor and organizers lost money, his star status drew interest, especially on the West Coast, and the money he made was more than he &quot;could have made in any other business in the same period.&quot; On the other hand, in 1991, Vito Stellino of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; compared Grange&#x27;s decision to join the NFL to Herschel Walker electing to sign with the newly formed United States Football League in the 1980s; although Walker was a popular name, the USFL ultimately collapsed. Stellino instead suggested television helped grow the NFL, while Grange&#x27;s legend was &quot;too embedded into the American sports psyche to disprove now. Anyway, it&#x27;s a better story than the reality.&quot;

According to football historian John M. Carroll, critics believed the tours created the notion that professional football was a circus led by certain superstars, which posed a risk to such players should they decide to play while injured. Others feared games could be fixed to favor the star players, with Brooklyn Dodgers owner/player Shipwreck Kelly alleging he had reached an agreement with Halas and the Bears to let Grange make a long run in a 1934 postseason exhibition game. However, Carroll also added Grange helped expedite the NFL&#x27;s growth:

In 1985, Grange emphasized the tours&#x27; importance to the NFL but noted that the league offered little support to the players from the era: &quot;I complained a few times, because we had guys in hospitals, guys who had had amputations because of football injuries. Guys who had problems. I thought the game could have done something for them, but it never did. As far as I know, pro football hasn&#x27;t done anything for anybody except lately, and that&#x27;s mostly for itself. I never made a real stink about it, but I was sad for the oldtimers.&quot;

===New York Yankees and the American Football League===

After the January tour, Pyle approached George Halas and Dutch Sternaman about buying an interest in the Bears, but was turned down. In response, he and Grange attempted to form their own team, the New York Yankees, and gain entry into the NFL. Although they acquired a five-year lease to play at Yankee Stadium, Mara intervened as he felt the Yankees infringed on his Giants&#x27; territorial rights.

To challenge the NFL, Grange and Pyle formed the nine-team American Football League. Wilson, who had been approached by Pyle about becoming his client, joined the league as a member of the Wildcats, while Grange&#x27;s Bears teammates Mohardt and Joey Sternaman played for the Chicago Bulls. In 1926, the Yankees went 9–5 to finish second in the standings.

After the season, the team embarked on a ten-game barnstorming tour to Texas and California alongside Wilson&#x27;s Wildcats. In late December, in what Grange wrote was &quot;about the only memorable part of the tour&quot;, he and his teammates were arrested in Dallas for disturbing the peace and reportedly being intoxicated, the latter of which the group denied; Grange explained the incident transpired when the team visited a hotel at 4 AM after being recommended the spot as a nightlife location by a local policeman. After the players were ordered by the hotel manager to leave the lobby for the noise they were creating, the police confronted them and the ensuing argument led to officers throwing teammate Pooley Hubert. They were eventually arrested and jailed, but were released after paying $10 as they had to play a game in Beaumont that day.

The AFL shut down after one season and the Yankees were added to the NFL. On October 17, 1927, the Yankees were shut out 12–0 by the Bears in Chicago. With a minute remaining in the game, Grange suffered a severe knee injury when he was hit by center George Trafton while trying to catch a pass from Eddie Tryon. As he landed, Grange&#x27;s cleat caught in the field, causing him to twist his knee when Trafton fell on him. Revealed to be a torn tendon, he underwent a diathermy to treat it after water started to form. The injury ultimately affected Grange&#x27;s speed and running ability, though he remained serviceable for the rest of his career. &quot;After it happened, I was just another halfback,&quot; Grange commented.

Four weeks after the Bears game, Grange returned against the Cardinals at quarterback to honor his contract. Although his injury worsened, the Yankees won 20–6 and he ultimately finished the season. After the year, he and the Yankees participated in another barnstorming tour against West Coast teams led by Wilson and Benny Friedman. Grange explained his decision to keep playing in his autobiography: &quot;At the young age of twenty-four, I refused to believe that I couldn&#x27;t bounce back to my old form. I was positive I could play myself back into shape. But those additional games only served to further aggravate my condition and, when the tour was ended, it became apparent I had done irreparable damage to the knee. For the first time since I was hurt, nearly four months before, I began worrying over the possibility that I might be through as a football player.&quot;

===Later career===
The contract between Pyle and Grange expired in January 1928, but Grange decided not to renew due to his injury and withdrew his stake in the Yankees. Without Grange, the Yankees went 4–8–1 before shutting down for financial reasons. Grange missed the entire 1928 season before returning to the Bears for 1929.

The two highlights of Grange&#x27;s later NFL years came in consecutive championship games. In the unofficial 1932 championship, Grange caught the game-winning touchdown pass from Bronko Nagurski. It was argued the pass was illegal. In the 1933 championship, Grange made a touchdown-saving tackle that saved the game and the title for the Bears.

He was a very modest person, who insisted that even the ordinary plumber or electrician knows more about his craft than he does. He said he could not explain how he did what he did on the field of play, and that he just followed his instincts.

Upon ending his playing career in 1934, Grange became the backfield coach for the Bears. Although Halas had offered him the team&#x27;s head coaching position, he declined as he &quot;never had any ambition to be a head coach in either the professional or college ranks.&quot; He remained in the position until 1937.

== Acting career ==

Pyle realized that as the greatest football star of his era, Grange could attract moviegoers, as well as sports fans. In 1926, he made his cinematic debut in the silent film &quot;One Minute to Play&quot;; Grange described the production process as &quot;the worst drudgery I&#x27;d ever experienced&quot;. Due to California&#x27;s summer heat and the story taking place in the Midwest during autumn, the studio struggled to find extras willing to dress in warmer clothing. As such, Pyle promoted the movie&#x27;s climactic final game between the school of Grange&#x27;s character Red Wade and that of the antagonist George Wilson, who had played against Grange on the barnstorming tour, as a genuine exhibition game with fans dressed in fall attire being granted free admission. The movie and Grange&#x27;s performance received positive reviews, with one &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; movie critic writing, &quot;If you&#x27;ve never seen Red Grange play football, now&#x27;s your chance, for he plays it like every thing in this picture.&quot;

Although &quot;The Minneapolis Star&quot; Agnes Taafee criticized various scenes for their lack of realism, she praised Grange&#x27;s performance. Film Booking Offices of America head Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. also asked Grange to consider retiring from football to enter acting full-time, but he declined.

The following year, he appeared in &quot;A Racing Romeo&quot; (1927). An auto racing-themed film, Grange had requested to perform his own racing stunts but Cliff Bergere was hired to take his place. The movie ultimately flopped at the box office, which Grange speculated was due to weaker promotion than with &quot;One Minute to Play&quot;. While sitting out the 1928 season to heal his knee injury, he and father Lyle joined Chicago film distributor Frank Zambreno on a nationwide vaudeville tour titled &quot;C&#x27;Mon Red&quot;.

Grange also starred in a 12-part serial series &quot;The Galloping Ghost&quot; in 1931. He performed his own stunts for the serial, including vehicular chases and fight scenes, in what he wrote was &quot;The most strenuous work I have ever done in my life&quot;. With the rise of sound film, Grange struggled to adapt to having speaking roles.

In his autobiography, Grange wrote of his acting career: &quot;I&#x27;ve always felt it represents one of the most memorable and worth-while chapters in my life. When I first reported for work in the film capital back in 1926, I was a shy, bashful, small-town boy despite the national prominence I had achieved for my football playing. Facing cameras, live audiences in the theaters, and mixing with all the stimulating people connected with show business did something for me. It gave me confidence and poise and made me feel a little bit more like a man of the world.&quot;

=== Filmography ===

==Later life==

Grange departed professional football in 1937 and earned a living in a variety of jobs including motivational speaker and sports announcer. In 1937 he was sued for damages by May Battaglia who claimed permanent injury after being struck by Grange who had run a red light. In the 1950s, he announced Bears games for CBS television and college football (including the Sugar Bowl) for NBC. Grange married his wife Margaret, nicknamed Muggs, in 1941, and they were together until his death in 1991. She was a flight attendant, and they met on a plane. The couple had no children.

During the 1940s, he was an insurance broker in Chicago. In December 1944, he was voted president of the United States Football League, a newly formed &quot;gridiron world series&quot; with plans to begin the following year. However, he left his position in June 1945 and the league subsequently folded without playing a game after the NFL expanded into its targeted markets. Grange also led the National Girls Baseball League as its president from 1947 to his resignation in 1949.

In 1950, he was elected as a Republican to the Board of Trustees of University of the Illinois, on which he served from 1951 until 1955.

His autobiography, &quot;The Red Grange Story&quot;, was first published in 1953. The book was written &quot;as told to&quot; Ira Morton, a syndicated newspaper columnist from Chicago. Grange developed Parkinson&#x27;s disease in his last year of life and died on January 28, 1991, in Lake Wales, Florida.

==Legacy==

To commemorate college football&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 1969, the Football Writers Association of America chose an all-time All-America team. Grange was the only unanimous choice. 30 years later in 1999, he was ranked number 80 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. In 2008, Grange was also ranked #1 on ESPN&#x27;s Top 25 Players In College Football History list.

In honor of his achievements at the University of Illinois, the school erected a 12-ft statue of Grange at the start of the 2009 football season. In 2011, Grange was announced as number one on the &quot;Big Ten Icons&quot; series presented by the Big Ten Network.

In 1931, Grange visited Abington Senior High School in Abington, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. Shortly thereafter, the school adopted his nickname for the mascot in his honor, the Galloping Ghost.

Wheaton Warrenville South High School&#x27;s football field is named in his honor and the team is referred to as the Wheaton Warrenville South Red Grange Tigers. Annually, the Wheaton Warrenville South Boys Track and Field team hosts the Red Grange Invitational in honor of Grange&#x27;s achievements in track and field.

On January 15, 1978, at Super Bowl XII, Grange became the first person other than the game referee to toss the coin at a Super Bowl.

Every December, a junior college bowl game is held in his honor known as the Red Grange Bowl, in his home state of Illinois.

<text>Earth 2150, also known as Earth 2150: Escape from the Blue Planet, is a real-time strategy game, originally published in 2000 by SSI and Polish developer Reality Pump and a sequel to &quot;Earth 2140&quot;. &quot;2150&quot; was one of the first commercial full-3D games of its kind. A sequel to &quot;Earth 2150&quot;, &quot;Earth 2160&quot;, was published in August 2005. The game also has two stand-alone expansion packs: &quot;Earth 2150: The Moon Project&quot;, and &quot;Earth 2150: Lost Souls&quot;.

==Story==
It is the 22nd century, after years of war and famine of unfathomable level, the world is returning to normal. 12 states of the previous United States have joined to form the United Civilized States (UCS). While in Asia, a new empire was being created under the Iron Fist of the Khans, these Mongol descendants gave themselves a name meant to conjure up an association with a glorious former age: the Eurasian Dynasty (ED). The UCS now relied upon robots for all their needs, even their military is controlled by machines. GOLAN, the leader of the UCS military forces had recently been altered by order of the current President, leading to a number of glitches throughout the system. One of these caused it to underestimate the Eurasian Dynasty&#x27;s defensive capacities, causing it to initiate the movement of a large force to occupy the British Isles. This mistake resulted in another violent war, lasting almost a decade, but GOLAN managed to gain the upper hand against the battle-hardened Khans and so the ED resorted to the usage of advanced atomic weaponry. The ED attacked an encampment of UCS forces at the North Pole with a massive strike involving newly developed and untested atomic weaponry in an attempt to put a decisive end to the hostilities. The catastrophic resulting explosions pushed the Earth out of regular orbit and towards the Sun. Aware that the Earth&#x27;s orbit has become unstable, a third faction living peacefully on the moon known as the Lunar Corporation (LC) joins the war in an attempt to defeat or reconcile both sides for the common good of humanity. The objective of the game is to collect enough resources to build an Evacuation Ship, allowing the player&#x27;s people to journey to Mars and escape the looming apocalypse, foreshadowing &quot;Earth 2160&quot;.

==Factions==
&quot;Earth 2150&quot; consists of 3 unique factions:

United Civilized States: This faction is a demarchy that controls North and South America. The name implies that the United States gradually expanded its borders to include all of the Americas. The United Civilized States (UCS) is a highly technologically based faction and have come to use robots to replace people in as many positions as possible. The UCS scientists created, under the supervision of President Jonathan Swamp, NEO and GOLAN; a huge step in technological advances, GOLAN was essentially leader of the UCS military, while NEO was interested in politics. It was a machine capable of matching and potentially far surpassing any organic general. It controlled the entire UCS army including all the military robots. These bipedal robots, or mecha, are just as effective as a human-piloted vehicle. The UCS has a robotic theme to its structures and vehicles. They have exclusive access to powerful weapons such as grenade launchers, shadow generators, and plasma cannons. Other technologies include reverse-engineered anti-gravity propulsion systems from a crashed UFO, and modified 105 and 120mm cannons stolen from the ED. UCS vehicles include Tiger, Panther, Jaguar and Spider Mechs, Gargoyle, Bat and Dragon aircraft. UCS units are typically slow and expensive but durable and pack high firepower.

Eurasian Dynasty: Essentially a revitalized Mongol Empire based in Russia and Mongolia, the Eurasian Dynasty (ED) use primitive (by 22nd Century standards) technology such as tanks and helicopters. As such, the ED has the most basic methods of power generation and needlessly complicated resource-gathering. Basic ED units are armed with machine guns, 105 mm cannons, and rocket launchers, while more advanced vehicles can be equipped with laser &amp; ion cannons (developed in response to the UCS&#x27; habit of AIs) as well as nuclear missiles. The ED has an industrial, Soviet-reminiscent theme to the design of its structures and vehicles. Some vehicles are the Pamir (reverse-engineered M1A2 Abrams tanks with a one-man crew), Kruszchev and Volga tanks, Ural &quot;defense tanks&quot; (actually, large, dual-hardpoint tanks), Cossack, Grozny, Thor and Khan helicopters, as well as the most powerful navy. ED units are typically individually weak but cheap and able to be produced in large numbers.

Lunar Corporation: The Lunar Corporation (LC) is a matriarchy faction of space colonists who colonized the Moon and cut themselves off from Earth soon after the 3rd World War. Normally a pacifist faction, the matriarchal LC are forced to head to Earth in order to secure minerals to build their Evacuation Ship (due to the Moon&#x27;s general lack of accessible resources, in real life as well as in the game). The Lunar Corporation is by far the most advanced of the three factions, utilizing solar power as well as antigravity vehicles (explained, in the game, as a result of researching extraterrestrial technologies). Because of this, they do not build trenches or dig tunnels like the UCS and ED. Also, instead of constructing buildings like the other two factions, the Lunar Corporation is able to &quot;transport&quot; them from orbit to the battlefield. In combat, they use exotic weapons such as electro-cannons and sonic weapons (originally a mining equipment). LC units are typically fast and technologically advanced, but fragile. In the single-player campaign, the forces of the LC are further bolstered by the solitary alien craft known as the Fang, a gift from the UCS in exchange for an alliance. Although losing this one-of-a-kind unit means instant failure, the Fang&#x27;s weapon is capable of easily decimating any opponent it comes across—that is, until its ammo runs out.

==Reception==
The PC version received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Brian Wright of &quot;GamePro&quot; was positive to its gameplay, graphics, soundtrack, and sound effects, but concluded that its complexity makes the game more suitable for hardcore players rather than the casual ones.

In the German market, the game debuted in 22nd place on Media Control&#x27;s computer game sales rankings for November 1999. It took 25th and 23rd in the first and second halves of December, respectively, before dropping to 27th in January 2000 and 44th in February. The game&#x27;s sales in the German region had surpassed 60,000 units by May, a performance that publisher Topware Interactive considered acceptable, according to &quot;PC Player&quot;″s Udo Hoffman. However, he noted that the game had been overshadowed by competitors &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun&quot; and &quot;Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings&quot;, and remarked that &quot;in retrospect, the date of publication was poorly chosen&quot;. David Fioretti of the German retailer PC Fun cited the game&#x27;s numerous bugs and Topware&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;cheap brand&quot; as further reasons for its failure to achieve hit status.

The game was a commercial failure in the U.S. &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot;″s Mark Asher reported in early September 2000 that the game had sold 23,163 units and earned revenues of $873,855 in the country. He felt that this performance &quot;can&#x27;t be classified as a hit&quot;, and with journalist Tom Chick explaining that it &quot;didn&#x27;t even hit PC Data&#x27;s charts&quot;.

The game won the award for Best Multiplayer Game at the &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot; Computer Game Awards for 2000.

<text>In law, a motion to set aside judgment is an application to overturn or set aside a court&#x27;s judgment, verdict or other final ruling in a case. Such a motion is proposed by a party who is dissatisfied with the result of a case. Motions may be made at any time after entry of judgment, and in some circumstances years after the case has been closed by the courts. Generally the motion cannot be based on grounds which were previously considered when deciding a motion for new trial or on an appeal of the judgment, thus the motion can only be granted in unusual circumstances, such as when the judgment was procured by fraud which could not have been discovered at the time of the trial, or if the court entering the judgment lacked the jurisdiction to do so.

Motions to set aside judgments entered in civil cases in the United States district courts are governed by Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The rule is quite straightforward; its court room application is mostly exactly as stated.

Motions to set aside judgment in criminal cases are rare: in U.S. jurisprudence the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; is the usual method of attacking a criminal conviction after the right of appeal has been exhausted.

<text>Das Erste (; &quot;The First&quot;) is the flagship national television channel of the ARD association of public broadcasting corporations in Germany. &quot;Das Erste&quot; is jointly operated by the nine regional public broadcasting corporations that are members of the ARD.

The channel was officially launched on Christmas Day, 25 December 1952 as &quot;NWDR-Fernsehen&quot; and renamed to &quot;Deutsches Fernsehen&quot; in 1954. Since 1996, the official brand is &quot;Das Erste&quot;; the full name Erstes Deutsches Fernsehen (&quot;First German Television&quot;) is still used before every major news edition. In colloquial speech, the station is usually called &quot;Erstes Programm&quot; (&quot;First Channel&quot;), or by its metonym, &quot;ARD&quot;.

==History==

The channel&#x27;s first experimental broadcast was on 27 November 1950 as the TV channel of the then NWDR, which in 1956 split into NDR and WDR. The regular NWDR television service started on 25 December 1952. Nationwide transmission began on 1 November 1954 within the ARD framework, under the name &quot;Deutsches Fernsehen&quot; (&quot;German Television&quot;). It was West Germany&#x27;s only television channel before the establishment of ZDF in 1963.

The new channel consisted of jointly-produced shows such as the nightly news programme &quot;Tagesschau&quot; (on the air since 26 December 1952), as well as broadcasts produced individually by ARD member stations. The programs were coordinated by the &quot;Programmdirektion&quot; based in Munich. Besides several entertaining shows, ARD went political in 1957 when it launched its first political TV magazine, Panorama. Germany&#x27;s first political TV show adopted the slogan &quot;What is being talked about and what should be talked about&quot; and pictured all aspects of postwar West German society—including conflict-laden topics, scandals, and other taboo topics, such as former Nazis who had held important roles.

ARD nevertheless produced a provisional second TV channel () from 1 June 1961 until ZDF started its transmissions on 1 April 1963. Colour television was introduced on 25 August 1967. Since 1 September 1995, Das Erste has broadcast 24 hours a day.

The channel&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Erstes Deutsches Fernsehen&quot; (&quot;First German Television&quot;) on 1 October 1984. At the same time, a new corporate design was introduced, designed by Hans Bacher, along with new CGI idents produced by Cranston/Csuri Productions in Columbus, Ohio. The previous logo, with stylized waves, was replaced by a new logo showing a stylized number &quot;1&quot; which is still in use today. It changed its name to &quot;Das Erste&quot; on 1 January 1997, but the long name &quot;Erstes Deutsches Fernsehen&quot; is still used for some purposes (e.g. the introduction to the main editions of the &quot;Tagesschau&quot;). Informally, it is also known under the metonym &quot;ARD&quot; among viewers.

In addition to its SD broadcast, a 720p50 HD version of the channel, &quot;Das Erste HD&quot;, is also broadcast. Broadcast of &quot;Das Erste HD&quot; began in February 2010 with the coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. &quot;Das Erste HD&quot; is available via satellite (DVB-S2 on Astra 19.2°E), cable (all cable providers in Germany and some providers throughout Europe), IPTV (MagentaTV), encoded using H.264 AVC, and on digital terrestrial television in 1080p50, encoded using H.265 HEVC.

==Member broadcasting organizations==
All nine of Germany&#x27;s regional public-broadcasting organizations contribute to the output of Das Erste and broadcast its programming in a common schedule.

===Time assigned===
Each regional member of ARD contributes programming to the channel&#x27;s schedule in proportion to the population of the area it serves. , the time allocations as percentage shares of total broadcast hours were:

==Broadcasting==
Before 1990, Das Erste was only distributed in West Germany, and was almost exclusively broadcast using transmitters owned by the Deutsche Bundespost. However, the transmitters were powerful enough that Das Erste [[Signal overspill|had a gigantic reach and could be accessed freely in neighboring countries and also in [[East Germany]], where the channel recorded audiences much larger than the [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]] (the former public broadcaster).Exceptions for the signal included [[Dresden]], located in a deep valley in southeastern East Germany, and the area around [[Rügen]] island. Indeed, Das Erste&#x27;s broadcasts, particularly the newscasts, were far more popular in East Germany than those of state broadcaster [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]]. One popular nickname for ARD in East Germany was &quot;Außer Rügen und Dresden&quot; (except Rügen and Dresden).

On 15 December 1990,following the [[German reunification|reunification]], programming from ARD was distributed by [[Deutsche Post of the GDR]] for the first time. The GDR-transmitters were later taken over by the Bundespost and merged organizationally with the West German transmitters. The transmitters of the Bundespost were transferred to [[Deutsche Telekom]] in 1995, and then in turn to [[T-Systems]] in 2000.
Between 2002 and 2008 the transmission facilities in Germany were successively converted from the analogue terrestrial [[PAL]] standard to the new digital terrestrial [[DVB-T]] television standard.

Das Erste is available throughout Europe on [[free-to-air]] digital [[satellite television]] via Astra, as well as on many [[cable television|cable]] providers. Transmission via the Hot Bird satellite was stopped on 1 April 2017.

<text>Grigol Peradze (; 13 September 1899 – 6 December 1942) was a prominent Georgian ecclesiastic figure, philologist, theologian, historian, and professor of patristics in the interwar period.

After providing help to Jews in Poland, he was arrested and sent to Auschwitz, where he was ultimately killed. He was canonized by the Eastern Orthodox Church as a martyr in 1995 and is celebrated on December 6.

== Life and works ==
Grigol Peradze was born in the village of Bakurtsikhe, in what is now the Kakheti region, in Eastern Georgia. The second of three sons of Romanoz Peradze, the local Orthodox priest, and the former Mariam Samadalashvili. Young Grigol was named in honor of the 11th-century Georgian Saint Gregory of Khandzta – Grigol being the cognate of Gregory. His father died when he was six, and the family moved to Tiflis (now Tbilisi), then the provincial capital, and later that of independent Georgia. He attended an Orthodox parochial school, and from 1913 Tbilisi Theological Seminary.

In 1918 Peradze graduated near the top of his class, and afterwards studied at the Tbilisi State University until 1921. In the years 1919–21 he also served in the army. He fought against the Bolsheviks in defense of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. Later, for a short time he was a teacher in a small village near Gori.

On 25 February 1921 Georgia was occupied by Soviet Russia. Grigol Peradze went into exile in Germany in November the same year. However, he would retain the fallen government&#x27;s passport for the rest of his life. Unlike many who left after the Soviet takeover, Peradze had actually secured legal permission to leave the country through the efforts of one of his former professors. Despite this, he was twice refused permission to return to Georgia in 1921 and 1927. Upon the last rejection he wrote &quot;do not know why. I do not belong to political parties. I have not worked against the Soviet government. My goal was always and is the service of our science and culture.&quot; Thus, he became effectively a stateless person, traveling on a Nansen passport. After the annexation of Georgia, he was threatened with imprisonment, so the Georgian Orthodox Church sent Grigoli to the village of Mankhi in Kakheti as a teacher.

In ordinary times Peradze would have studied in Russia; this route was now closed to him, and other talented students; the Church sought to send students to come to Germany. At a local council of the Church held at Gelati in 1921, it was decided to send Peradze to continue further studies abroad. He was encouraged by his mentor, Cornelius Kekelidze, and the head of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Catholicos-Patriarch Ambrose. This was done with the help of German Kartvelologist Arthur Leist and the head of the Oriental mission in Potsdam, Johannes Lepsius, through the German ambassador to Georgia. Grigol was able to study in Berlin and later Bonn. In 1926 he graduated from the University of Bonn (Germany). In December 1927 he received a PhD degree in history (the title of his PhD thesis was &quot;History of the Georgian Monasticism from its creation until 1064&quot;).

From 1927 to 1932 Peradze was an associate professor at the University of Bonn. From 1933 to 1942 he was a professor of patrology at the Faculty of Orthodox Theology of Warsaw University, in Poland. In the spring of 1927 Peradze spent time researching manuscripts in the British Museum and the Bodleian Library at Oxford.

Around Christmas in 1930 Peradze became seriously ill, and pledged that he would devote himself to God if he recovered. On 18 April 1931 Peradze was tonsured a monk at Holy Wisdom Greek Orthodox Cathedral in London, followed the next day by being named a hierodeacon. Five weeks later, on 24 May, he was ordained a priest at St. Stephen&#x27;s Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Paris. In 1931 he became the first regular priest of the Georgian St. Nino Orthodox Church in Paris, which had been established by laymen in 1929, where he celebrated his first liturgy on 31 May. In the same year he began to publish a Georgian scientific journal titled &quot;Jvari Vazisa&quot; (&quot;Cross of Vine&quot;). On 5 January 1934, again at Holy Wisdom, he was raised to the rank of archimandrite in recognition of his pastoral work with the Georgian community.

In the 1930s, Peradze discovered numerous important written manuscripts of Georgian Christian culture in Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Germany, and Austria (Georgian manuscripts of the Typicon of the Georgian Petritsoni Monastery (Bachkovo, Bulgaria), the so-called Tischendorf manuscripts of the Apagae of the Monastery of the Holy Cross at the University Library in the University of Leipzig, Germany, etc.). During this time, Peradze lived in a small apartment in Warsaw&#x27;s Praga District at Brukowa 22 Street (today Okrzei Street), where he kept his large collection of Georgian antiquities.

The invasion of Poland by German troops in 1939 made Peradze&#x27;s position precarious. For him, being in solidarity with Jews in peril went without saying; and he helped wherever he could. Nor did he hesitate to visit the imprisoned Polish Metropolitan Dionysius. These activities were viewed with growing suspicion by the Nazi occupiers, and Peradze&#x27;s fruitful ecclesiastic and scientific activities were brought to an end in 1942 when, on 4 May, he was arrested by the Gestapo. On 6 December 1942 Peradze was killed in the Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz (Oświęcim) when he took the blame for the murder of a German officer to spare his fellow prisoners, or, according to another report, when he entered a gas chamber in the place of a Jewish prisoner who had a large family.

Peradze is commemorated by his memorial chapel in Warsaw, a museum in his hometown, memorial plaques at the University of Warsaw and on St. George&#x27;s Church, Bakurtsikhe, where he was baptized.
His main fields of scientific activity were the history of the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church, source studies of the history of Georgia and the Georgian Church, patrology, history of Georgian literature, Rustavelology, etc.

Grigol Peradze was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church in September 1995. The feast day for St. Grigol is 6 December (or 23 November, Old Style). In 2013, he was posthumously awarded the title and Order of the National Hero of Georgia.

<text>Northeast Iowa Community College (NICC) is a public community college with two main campuses in Iowa, one in Calmar and one in Peosta. The college serves the Iowa counties of Allamakee, Chickasaw, Clayton, Fayette, Howard, Winneshiek, Dubuque, and Delaware counties. It also includes sections of Bremer, Buchanan, Jones, Jackson, and Mitchell counties. NICC also has a satellite campus in downtown Dubuque, Iowa.

Originally, the school was known as Northeast Iowa Technical Institute (NITI). The school became a community college in 1988 and was renamed. The school is authorized by the Iowa Board of Education to award the Associate in Arts, Associate in Science, and Associate in Applied Science degrees as well as the GED. It offers programs in a number of vocational fields, as well as transfer programs for students wishing to continue their education at four-year institutions. The school had worked with the University of Dubuque to provide a transfer option for students looking to transfer to four-year programs. The Peosta Campus houses the National Education Center for Agricultural Safety (NECAS), a nationally accredited agricultural training center.

As part of a three-day Midwestern bus tour, President Barack Obama traveled to the college with members of his cabinet to host the White House Rural Economic Forum on August 16, 2011. The college also hosted President Donald Trump for an economic roundtable in July 2018.

<text>The Rockefeller University is a private biomedical research and graduate-only university in New York City, New York. It focuses primarily on the biological and medical sciences and provides doctoral and postdoctoral education. It is classified as a &quot;Special Focus – Research Institution&quot;. Rockefeller is the oldest biomedical research institute in the United States.

The university is located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, between 63rd and 68th streets on York Avenue. Richard P. Lifton became the university&#x27;s eleventh president on September 1, 2016. The Rockefeller University Press publishes the &quot;Journal of Experimental Medicine&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Cell Biology&quot;, and &quot;The Journal of General Physiology&quot;.

In 2018, the faculty included 82 tenured and tenure-track members, including 37 members of the National Academy of Sciences, 17 members of the National Academy of Medicine, seven Lasker Award recipients, and five Nobel laureates. As of March 2022, a total of 26 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with Rockefeller University.

==History==

The Rockefeller University was founded in June 1901 as The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research—often called simply The Rockefeller Institute—by John D. Rockefeller, who had founded the University of Chicago in 1889, upon advice by his adviser Frederick T. Gates and action taken in March 1901 by his son, John D. Rockefeller Jr. Greatly elevating the prestige of American science and medicine, it was America&#x27;s first biomedical institute, like France&#x27;s Pasteur Institute (1888) and Germany&#x27;s Robert Koch Institute (1891). The Rockefeller Foundation, a philanthropic organization, founded in 1913, is a separate entity, but had close connections mediated by prominent figures holding dual positions.
The first director of laboratories was Simon Flexner, who supervised the development of research capacity at the institute, whose staff made major discoveries in basic research and medicine. While a student at Johns Hopkins University, Flexner had studied under the institute&#x27;s first scientific director, William H. Welch, first dean of Hopkins&#x27; medical school and known as the dean of American medicine. Flexner retired in 1935 and was succeeded by Herbert Gasser. He was succeeded in 1953 by Detlev Bronk, who broadened The Rockefeller Institute into a university that began awarding the PhD degree in 1954. In 1965 The Rockefeller Institute&#x27;s name was changed to The Rockefeller University.

For its first six decades, the institute focused on basic research to develop basic science, on applied research as biomedical engineering, and, since 1910—when The Rockefeller Hospital opened on its campus as America&#x27;s first facility for clinical research—on clinical science. The Rockefeller Hospital&#x27;s first director Rufus Cole retired in 1937 and was succeeded by Thomas Milton Rivers. As director of The Rockefeller Institute&#x27;s virology laboratory, he established virology as an independent field apart from bacteriology.

In the 1940s, it hosted a &quot;scientific team that overturned medical dogma&quot; and &quot;became the first to demonstrate that genes were made of DNA.&quot;

===Rockefeller family===
Rockefeller Sr visited the university just once, at the urging of Rockefeller Jr, who was enthusiastic about the institute. Rockefeller Jr and his youngest son David visited more often. David Rockefeller joined the board of trustees in 1940, was its chairman from 1950 to 1975, chaired the board&#x27;s executive committee from 1975 to 1995, became honorary chairman and life trustee, and remained active as a philanthropist until his death.

===Institutional changes===
Rockefeller Institute Hospital was renamed Rockefeller University Hospital.

===Archives===
The archives of Rockefeller University are at the Rockefeller Archive Center, established in 1974 as part of the university and organized as an independent foundation since 2008.

==Organization and administration==
===Governance===
*More than 71 heads of laboratories
*200 research and clinical scientists
*210 postdoctoral investigators
*1,050 clinicians, technicians, administrative and support staff

To foster an interdisciplinary atmosphere among its laboratories, faculty members are grouped into one or more of ten interconnecting research areas:
==Academics==
===Graduate degree programs===
Rockefeller University admitted its first graduate students in 1955. Today, about 255 graduate students are enrolled in the program, which offers doctoral degrees in the biomedical sciences, chemistry, and biophysics. The university&#x27;s organization on the basis of laboratories rather than a hierarchical departmental structure extends to the graduate program, where laboratory research is the primary focus and students can meet degree requirements by participating in any combination of courses. In partnership with neighboring Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Weill Cornell Medicine, Rockefeller participates in the Tri-Institutional MD–PhD Program as well as a Tri-Institutional chemical biology Ph.D. program.

===Contemporary research===

Rockefeller ranks highly in the CWTS Leiden Ranking, an international ranking of research impact. 
Rockefeller faculty have made contributions to breakthroughs in biomedical sciences. Michael W. Young was one of several scientists who located genes that regulate the sleep–wake cycle in 1984. In 1994, Jeffrey M. Friedman’s laboratory discovered leptin, a gene that influences appetite and weight. Charles David Allis helped identify the first enzyme that modifies histones in 1996, providing early evidence that the DNA packaging material plays a crucial role in gene regulation. In 1998, Roderick MacKinnon’s laboratory elucidated the structure and mechanism of a potassium channel, explaining how electrical signals are conveyed across cell membranes. Titia de Lange was part of a team that found how telomeres protect chromosome ends, shedding light on the role of genome instability in cancer in 1999. Robert B. Darnell led research that defined the molecular basis of fragile X syndrome, the second leading cause of intellectual disability, in 2001. Vincent A. Fischetti was part of a group that developed a powerful agent that can target and wipe out anthrax bacteria in 2002. Charles M. Rice helped produce an infectious form of the hepatitis C virus in laboratory cultures of human cells in 2005, leading directly to three new classes of hepatitis C drugs. Elaine Fuchs helped define the stem cells that can initiate squamous cell carcinoma in 2011, and also characterized the signaling pathways that drive malignancy. In 2013, Leslie B. Vosshall’s laboratory identified a gene in mosquitoes that is responsible for their attraction to humans and their sensitivity to the insect repellent DEET. Ali Brivanlou&#x27;s laboratory developed a method to grow embryos outside the uterus for up to 13 days in 2016, allowing scientists to study the earliest events of human development.

In 2020, many Rockefeller scientists shifted the focus of their research in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Michel C. Nussenzweig pioneered a method to isolate and clone antibodies from people who successfully recovered from COVID-19 to design a treatment that prevents people from developing severe disease. Jean-Laurent Casanova identified genetic mutations that are responsible for a subset of unexpectedly severe cases of COVID-19.

==Campus and student life==

Founder&#x27;s Hall was the first building on Rockefeller&#x27;s campus, built between 1903 and 1906. It housed the nation&#x27;s first major biomedical research laboratory and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974. Caspary Auditorium, a 40-foot-high, 90-foot round geodesic dome, was built in 1957 and hosts a variety of concert series and lectures. The completion of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation–David Rockefeller River Campus in 2019, built along the East River over FDR Drive, added two acres to Rockefeller&#x27;s footprint. Rockefeller&#x27;s campus houses a childcare center for researchers and other university employees.

Graduate students are offered subsidized housing on campus and receive an annual stipend. Student groups include People at Rockefeller Identifying as Sexual/Gender Minorities (PRISM), Women in Science at Rockefeller (WISeR), and the Science and Education Policy Association (SEPA). The student-run publication &quot;Natural Selections&quot; is produced monthly.

== Promotion of women in science and outreach activities ==

The Rockefeller University established a Women in Science initiative in 1998 to address the underrepresentation of women in the field. It is founded mainly by female philanthropists. The program includes scholarships and an entrepreneurship found to help increase the low number of female researchers that commercialize their discoveries. In 2004 Rockefeller&#x27;s professor Paul Greengard donated the full amount of his Nobel Prize to establish the Pearl Meister Greengard Prize given annually to a woman scientist in the field of biology.

Rockefeller also host diverse initiatives to promote science and culture: Parents &amp; Science Initiative, The RockEDU Science Outreach for K-12 students and teachers that includes lab experience and professional development and The Lewis Thomas Prize for writing about science is given annually.

In addition, Rockefeller hosts the Peggy Rockefeller Concerts and in collaboration with Cornell University and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center it hosts the Tri-Institutional Noon concert Series.

In 2012, Rockefeller began participating in Open House New York&#x27;s OHNY Weekend.

===Individual affiliates===
Notable figures to emerge from the institution include Alexis Carrel, Peyton Rous, Hideyo Noguchi, Thomas Milton Rivers, Richard Shope, Thomas Francis Jr, Oswald T. Avery, Frederick Griffith, Colin MacLeod, Maclyn McCarty, Rebecca Lancefield, Wendell Meredith Stanley, René Dubos, Ashton Carter, and Cornelius P. Rhoads. Others attained eminence before being drawn to the university. Joshua Lederberg, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958, served as president of the university from 1978 to 1990. Paul Nurse, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2001, was president from 2003 to 2010. (Before Nurse&#x27;s tenure, Thomas Sakmar was acting-president from 2002.) Barry Coller, who invented the Abciximab, currently serves as the Vice President for Medical Affairs. In all, as of October 2020, 38 Nobel Prize recipients have been associated with the university. In the mid-1970s, the university attracted a few prominent academicians in the humanities, such as Saul Kripke.

==Controversy==
Reginald Archibald, an endocrinologist at the university from 1948 to 1982, allegedly abused dozens or hundreds of boys during his time at the university while studying growth problems in children, including molestation and photographing them naked. Officials at Rockefeller University knew of the legitimacy of the claims for years before notifying the public. The university and hospital issued a statement confirming that Archibald had &quot;engaged in certain inappropriate conduct during patient examinations&quot; and that they &quot;deeply regret[ted]&quot; any &quot;pain and suffering&quot; the former patients felt. New York State passed a law known as the Child Victims Act, which created a one-year window for civil suits brought by former child victims, allowing them to make cases against the university.

<doc id="605476" wikidata="Q7600483" url="?curid=605476" title="Stapleton, Staten Island">
<text>Stapleton is a neighborhood in northeastern Staten Island in New York City, United States. It is located along the waterfront of Upper New York Bay, roughly bounded on the north by Tompkinsville at Grant Street, on the south by Clifton at Vanderbilt Avenue, and on the west by St. Paul&#x27;s Avenue and Van Duzer Street, which form the border with the community of Grymes Hill.

Stapleton is one of the older waterfront neighborhoods of the borough, built in the 1830s on land once owned by the Vanderbilt family. It was a long-time commercial center of the island, but has struggled to revive after several decades of neglect following the 1964 construction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which shifted the commercial development of the island to its interior.

Stapleton is part of Staten Island Community District 1 and its ZIP Code is 10304. Stapleton is patrolled by the 120th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
The neighborhood was the site of the farm where Cornelius Vanderbilt grew up, at the location of the present-day Paramount Theater building on Bay Street (the theater itself having closed in the early 1980s). In the early 19th century it became the commercial center of Southfield Township. In 1832 William J. Staples, a merchant from Manhattan for whom the neighborhood is named, as well as Minthorne Tompkins, the son of Vice President Daniel D. Tompkins, acquired land from the Vanderbilts and laid out the streets. Staples and Tompkins started a ferry service from the neighborhood waterfront to Manhattan and began advertising their new village in 1836.

Seaman&#x27;s Retreat, a hospital for sailors entering New York Harbor, opened in 1832 and later became Bayley Seton Hospital, the largest employer in the neighborhood until the Sisters of Charity, an order of Roman Catholic nuns which operated the facility, closed it in 2004. (The property is sometimes reckoned as being in Clifton, Stapleton&#x27;s neighbor to the south.) It was also for many years the site of a United States Public Health Service hospital.

The neighborhood was the location of several springs which led to the establishment of several German-American breweries in the middle 19th century. The last brewery closed in 1963.

In 1884, Stapleton was incorporated as the village of Edgewater. The old Village Hall still stands, located in Tappen Park. In 1884, the Staten Island Railway extended its track from the neighborhood northward to St. George, with a stop at Stapleton station. Direct ferry service from the neighborhood to Manhattan was halted two years later in 1886.

=== 20th century ===
Between 1929 and 1931, Stapleton had its own NFL pro football team, the Staten Island Stapletons. In their last two years they were known as the Staten Island Stapes. This professional American football team was founded in 1915 and played in the National Football League from 1929 to 1932. Jack Shapiro, who was a blocking back for the Stapletons, was the shortest player in NFL history.

In 1963, I.S.49, which sits across from the Stapleton Houses, opened. The Houses, a housing project sponsored by the State of New York, had opened two years earlier; at eight stories high, its buildings are the tallest within any such project on Staten Island, and is the largest New York City Housing Authority project in the borough.

===Waterfront===
The city built piers in 1920, but they were never fully exploited. From 1937 to 1942 several of the piers were used as the first Foreign Trade Zone in the United States. From 1942 to 1945, they became the Staten Island Terminal facility of the Army&#x27;s New York Port of Embarkation. The U.S. Coast Guard operated their Section Base 2 there from the early 1920s until 1967, when they moved to Governors Island. After World War II, the piers once again became a foreign trade zone, but their use declined and most of the piers were demolished by the 1970s. The last, used for fishing, was removed when the U.S. Navy proposed to build a base in Stapleton in the 1980s.

In 1983, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman selected Stapleton to be the homeport for a naval unit headed by the battleship , as part of the dispersal of the navy during a military build up ordered by President Ronald Reagan. This proposal became highly controversial throughout Staten Island when analysis of the proposal showed a net loss of civilian jobs on Staten Island (mainly due to expected job-seekers among naval dependents, but also due to a loss of businesses forced out by the naval presence). It was also controversial because of the belief that the Tomahawk cruise missiles aboard the Iowa and an accompanying Aegis cruiser would, in at least some cases, be carrying nuclear warheads.

Following years of debate, which slowed development of the base, the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a major cutback in military spending, and the still incomplete base was cancelled in 1993. Shortly thereafter, a plan was floated to build a race-track on the site, to be primarily used by NASCAR. The plan was quickly forgotten. Also headquartered at the site is one of three fireboats, FDNY Marine company 9. The site is now also used as part of the annual Fleet Week in New York City. After sitting empty for a couple of years, the base site was used by a bagel manufacturer briefly. Then a proposal was made to have a movie studio occupy a portion of the site. For never-explained reasons the city administration opposed this, and finally some of the civil courts took over a small part of the site, leaving most unused while various proposals were made for housing, parkland, and an educational complex, among others.

On October 26, 2006, the New York City Council approved a massive redevelopment plan for the site. It will be transformed into a new community with 350 housing units, restaurants, parks, a recreation center and farmers&#x27; market. The City Council pushed the project through its final regulatory hurdle when it approved the $66 million blueprint for the former Navy base. The city will use the money and an additional $1.1 million state grant to create streets, utilities and a mile-long waterfront esplanade while soliciting proposals from private developers to build on six sites—three residential and three commercial—across the base. City officials have said infrastructure work could begin in early 2007 with a projected completion date of 2009. Demolition of the old Navy buildings began in late 2011.

On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy threw the tanker &quot;John B. Caddell&quot; ashore on a vacant part of Front Street.

==Demographics==
For census purposes, the New York City government classifies Stapleton as part of a larger neighborhood tabulation area called Stapleton-Rosebank. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Stapleton-Rosebank was 26,453, a change of 2,405 (9.1%) from the 24,048 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 37.5% (9,910) White, 19.3% (5,097) African American, 0.3% (72) Native American, 9.7% (2,565) Asian, 0% (12) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (102) from other races, and 1.6% (427) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 31.3% (8,268) of the population.

The entirety of Community District 1, which comprises Stapleton and other neighborhoods on the North Shore, had 181,484 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.0 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 24% are between the ages of between 0–17, 27% between 25–44, and 26% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 13% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 1 was $48,018, though the median income in Stapleton individually was $58,373. In 2018, an estimated 21% of Stapleton and the North Shore residents lived in poverty, compared to 17% in all of Staten Island and 20% in all of New York City. One in fourteen residents (7%) were unemployed, compared to 6% in Staten Island and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 51% in Stapleton and the North Shore, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 49% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Stapleton and the North Shore are considered high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

===Culture===
The portions of the neighborhood around the Stapleton Houses have been predominantly Black for a while (though there has always been a noticeable White and Hispanic presence), while the areas further away have been a little bit more diverse. The overall neighborhood has seen a decrease in the White population, which reflects the overall trend of Whites moving back towards the city center (as well as those moving to newer suburbs further out). The local school, P.S. 14 (which has since become P.S. 78 due to P.S. 14&#x27;s failing as a school) has seen a large increase in the Hispanic population, with the 2011–2012 school year being the first one in which Hispanics have made up the majority of the student body. This is reflective of the overall increase in the Hispanic population in the area.

==Community==

Stapleton, like much of the North Shore, has two major coexisting cultural spheres: that based in the old, standalone homes that have been in the area since the Victorian era, and that based in the public housing projects. As such, it is just as common to find Spanish bodegas and vibrant street art as winding roads, used book stores, and coffee shops.

Popular places for the performance of local music include The Full Cup, located on Van Duzer Street, and the Bay Street Saloon and Dock Street, both of which operate on Bay Street. In October 1980, the Paramount Theater began hosting acts such as The B-52s, Talking Heads, Squeeze, the Dead Kennedys, Burning Spear and the Ramones, but it ceased functioning as a concert hall by the late 1980s. Other former venues include Beer Goggles and Martini Red, which is now known as The Hop Shoppe. The NYC Arts Cypher is located on Broad Street, and occasionally hosts hip-hop concerts, which distinguishes it from most other local venues, which cater mainly to rock and alternative bands.

In recent years, the extreme sports scene has boomed on Staten Island. In July 2012, 5050 Skatepark was opened on Front Street across from the Homeport. 5050 Skatepark is New York City&#x27;s only indoor skatepark, and one of the few skateparks open to BMX bikes, skateboarder, scooters, and rollerblades.

The neighborhood also has a diverse selection of restaurants, including an American-style diner, a Gastropub, as well as Sri Lankan, Mexican, and Italian eateries. Chain restaurants also have a presence.

=== Points of interest ===
In 1801, the local Union American Methodist Episcopal church was founded in the neighborhood. It still stands at 43 Tompkins Avenue and has a very active congregation, most of whom are descendants of former slaves on Staten Island. The church is the oldest African-American church in the borough and one of four which predate the 20th century.

Edgewater Village Hall and Tappen Park, the old village hall of Stapleton, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

In addition to the Edgewater Village Hall and Tappen Park, the Boardman–Mitchell House, Houses at 364 and 390 Van Duzer Street, and St. Paul&#x27;s Memorial Church and Rectory are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Police and crime==
Stapleton and the North Shore are patrolled by the 120th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 78 Richmond Terrace. The 120th Precinct ranked 12th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. , with a non-fatal assault rate of 94 per 100,000 people, Stapleton and the North Shore&#x27;s rate of violent crimes per capita is more than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 719 per 100,000 people is higher than that of the city as a whole.

The 120th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 83.3% between 1990 and 2022. The precinct reported seven murders, 14 rapes, 118 robberies, 384 felony assaults, 124 burglaries, 338 grand larcenies, and 136 grand larcenies auto in 2022.

==Fire safety==
Stapleton is served by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY)&#x27;s Engine Co. 153/Ladder Co. 77, located at 74 Broad Street.

==Health==
, preterm births and births to teenage mothers are more common in Stapleton and the North Shore than in other places citywide. In Stapleton and the North Shore, there were 96 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 87 per 1,000 citywide), and 22.6 births to teenage mothers per 1,000 live births (compared to 19.3 per 1,000 citywide).

<text>Behavioral neuroscience, also known as biological psychology, biopsychology, or psychobiology, is part of the broad, interdisciplinary field of neuroscience, with its primary focus being on the biological and neural substrates underlying human experiences and behaviors, as in our psychology. Derived from an earlier field known as physiological psychology, behavioral neuroscience applies the principles of biology to study the physiological, genetic, and developmental mechanisms of behavior in humans and other animals. Behavioral neuroscientists examine the biological bases of behavior through research that involves neuroanatomical substrates, environmental and genetic factors, effects of lesions and electrical stimulation, developmental processes, recording electrical activity, neurotransmitters, hormonal influences, chemical components, and the effects of drugs. Important topics of consideration for neuroscientific research in behavior include learning and memory, sensory processes, motivation and emotion, as well as genetic and molecular substrates concerning the biological bases of behavior. Subdivisions of behavioral neuroscience include the field of cognitive neuroscience, which emphasizes the biological processes underlying human cognition. Behavioral and cognitive neuroscience are both concerned with the neuronal and biological bases of psychology, with a particular emphasis on either cognition or behavior depending on the field.

==History==
Behavioral neuroscience as a scientific discipline emerged from a variety of scientific and philosophical traditions in the 18th and 19th centuries. René Descartes proposed physical models to explain animal as well as human behavior. Descartes suggested that the pineal gland, a midline unpaired structure in the brain of many organisms, was the point of contact between mind and body. Descartes also elaborated on a theory in which the pneumatics of bodily fluids could explain reflexes and other motor behavior. This theory was inspired by moving statues in a garden in Paris.

Other philosophers also helped give birth to psychology. One of the earliest textbooks in the new field, &quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot; by William James, argues that the scientific study of psychology should be grounded in an understanding of biology.
The emergence of psychology and behavioral neuroscience as legitimate sciences can be traced from the emergence of physiology from anatomy, particularly neuroanatomy. Physiologists conducted experiments on living organisms, a practice that was distrusted by the dominant anatomists of the 18th and 19th centuries. The influential work of Claude Bernard, Charles Bell, and William Harvey helped to convince the scientific community that reliable data could be obtained from living subjects.

Even before the 18th and 19th centuries, behavioral neuroscience was beginning to take form as far back as 1700 B.C. The question that seems to continually arise is: what is the connection between the mind and body? The debate is formally referred to as the mind-body problem. There are two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem; monism and dualism. Plato and Aristotle are two of several philosophers who participated in this debate. Plato believed that the brain was where all mental thought and processes happened. In contrast, Aristotle believed the brain served the purpose of cooling down the emotions derived from the heart. The mind-body problem was a stepping stone toward attempting to understand the connection between the mind and body.

Another debate arose about localization of function or functional specialization versus equipotentiality which played a significant role in the development in behavioral neuroscience. As a result of localization of function research, many famous people found within psychology have come to various different conclusions. Wilder Penfield was able to develop a map of the cerebral cortex through studying epileptic patients along with Rassmussen. Research on localization of function has led behavioral neuroscientists to a better understanding of which parts of the brain control behavior. This is best exemplified through the case study of Phineas Gage.

The term &quot;psychobiology&quot; has been used in a variety of contexts, emphasizing the importance of biology, which is the discipline that studies organic, neural and cellular modifications in behavior, plasticity in neuroscience, and biological diseases in all aspects, in addition, biology focuses and analyzes behavior and all the subjects it is concerned about, from a scientific point of view. In this context, psychology helps as a complementary, but important discipline in the neurobiological sciences. The role of psychology in this questions is that of a social tool that backs up the main or strongest biological science. The term &quot;psychobiology&quot; was first used in its modern sense by Knight Dunlap in his book &quot;An Outline of Psychobiology (1914)&quot;. Dunlap also was the founder and editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;Psychobiology&quot;. In the announcement of that journal, Dunlap writes that the journal will publish research &quot;...bearing on the interconnection of mental and physiological functions&quot;, which describes the field of behavioral neuroscience even in its modern sense.

Neuroscience is considered a relatively new discipline, with the first conference for the Society of Neuroscience occurring in 1971. The meeting was held to merge different fields focused on studying the nervous system (ex. neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, physiological psychology, neuroendocrinology, clinical neurology, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, etc.) by creating one interdisciplinary field. In 1983, the &quot;Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology&quot;, published by the American Psychological Association, was split into two separate journals: &quot;Behavioral Neuroscience&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Comparative Psychology&quot;. The author of the journal at the time gave reasoning for this separation, with one being that behavioral neuroscience is the broader contemporary advancement of physiological psychology. Furthermore, in all animals, the nervous system is the organ of behavior. Therefore, every biological and behavioral variable that influences behavior must go through the nervous system to do so. Present-day research in behavioral neuroscience studies all biological variables which act through the nervous system and relate to behavior.

==Relationship to other fields of psychology and biology==
In many cases, humans may serve as experimental subjects in behavioral neuroscience experiments; however, a great deal of the experimental literature in behavioral neuroscience comes from the study of non-human species, most frequently rats, mice, and monkeys. As a result, a critical assumption in behavioral neuroscience is that organisms share biological and behavioral similarities, enough to permit extrapolations across species. This allies behavioral neuroscience closely with comparative psychology, ethology, evolutionary biology, and neurobiology. Behavioral neuroscience also has paradigmatic and methodological similarities to neuropsychology, which relies heavily on the study of the behavior of humans with nervous system dysfunction (i.e., a non-experimentally based biological manipulation). Synonyms for behavioral neuroscience include biopsychology, biological psychology, and psychobiology. Physiological psychology is a subfield of behavioral neuroscience, with an appropriately narrower definition.

== Research methods ==

The distinguishing characteristic of a behavioral neuroscience experiment is that either the independent variable of the experiment is biological, or some dependent variable is biological. In other words, the nervous system of the organism under study is permanently or temporarily altered, or some aspect of the nervous system is measured (usually to be related to a behavioral variable).

===Disabling or decreasing neural function===

* Lesions – A classic method in which a brain-region of interest is naturally or intentionally destroyed to observe any resulting changes such as degraded or enhanced performance on some behavioral measure. Lesions can be placed with relatively high accuracy &quot;Thanks to a variety of brain &#x27;atlases&#x27; which provide a map of brain regions in 3-dimensional&quot; stereotactic coordinates.
**Surgical lesions – Neural tissue is destroyed by removing it surgically.
** Electrolytic lesions – Neural tissue is destroyed through the application of electrical shock trauma.
** Chemical lesions – Neural tissue is destroyed by the infusion of a neurotoxin.
** Temporary lesions – Neural tissue is temporarily disabled by cooling or by the use of anesthetics such as tetrodotoxin.
* Transcranial magnetic stimulation – A new technique usually used with human subjects in which a magnetic coil applied to the scalp causes unsystematic electrical activity in nearby cortical neurons which can be experimentally analyzed as a functional lesion.
* Synthetic ligand injection – A receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand (RASSL) or Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD), permits spatial and temporal control of G protein signaling in vivo. These systems utilize G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) engineered to respond exclusively to synthetic small molecules ligands, like clozapine N-oxide (CNO), and not to their natural ligand(s). RASSL&#x27;s represent a GPCR-based chemogenetic tool. These synthetic ligands upon activation can decrease neural function by G-protein activation. This can with Potassium attenuating neural activity.
* Optogenetic inhibition – A light activated inhibitory protein is expressed in cells of interest. Powerful millisecond timescale neuronal inhibition is instigated upon stimulation by the appropriate frequency of light delivered via fiber optics or implanted LEDs in the case of vertebrates, or via external illumination for small, sufficiently translucent invertebrates. Bacterial Halorhodopsins or Proton pumps are the two classes of proteins used for inhibitory optogenetics, achieving inhibition by increasing cytoplasmic levels of halides () or decreasing the cytoplasmic concentration of protons, respectively.

=== Enhancing neural function ===

* Electrical stimulation – A classic method in which neural activity is enhanced by application of a small electric current (too small to cause significant cell death).
* Psychopharmacological manipulations – A chemical receptor antagonist induces neural activity by interfering with neurotransmission. Antagonists can be delivered systemically (such as by intravenous injection) or locally (intracerebrally) during a surgical procedure into the ventricles or into specific brain structures. For example, NMDA antagonist AP5 has been shown to inhibit the initiation of long term potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission (in rodent fear conditioning) which is believed to be a vital mechanism in learning and memory.
* Synthetic Ligand Injection – Likewise, Gq-DREADDs can be used to modulate cellular function by innervation of brain regions such as Hippocampus. This innervation results in the amplification of γ-rhythms, which increases motor activity.
* Transcranial magnetic stimulation – In some cases (for example, studies of motor cortex), this technique can be analyzed as having a stimulatory effect (rather than as a functional lesion).
* Optogenetic excitation – A light activated excitatory protein is expressed in select cells. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light activated cation channel, was the first bacterial opsin shown to excite neurons in response to light, though a number of new excitatory optogenetic tools have now been generated by improving and imparting novel properties to ChR2.

=== Measuring neural activity ===
* Optical techniques – Optical methods for recording neuronal activity rely on methods that modify the optical properties of neurons in response to the cellular events associated with action potentials or neurotransmitter release.
**Voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs) were among the earliest method for optically detecting neuronal activity. VSDs commonly changed their fluorescent properties in response to a voltage change across the neuron&#x27;s membrane, rendering membrane sub-threshold and supra-threshold (action potentials) electrical activity detectable. Genetically encoded voltage sensitive fluorescent proteins have also been developed.
** Calcium imaging relies on dyes or genetically encoded proteins that fluoresce upon binding to the calcium that is transiently present during an action potential.
** Synapto-pHluorin is a technique that relies on a fusion protein that combines a synaptic vesicle membrane protein and a pH sensitive fluorescent protein. Upon synaptic vesicle release, the chimeric protein is exposed to the higher pH of the synaptic cleft, causing a measurable change in fluorescence.
* Single-unit recording – A method whereby an electrode is introduced into the brain of a living animal to detect electrical activity that is generated by the neurons adjacent to the electrode tip. Normally this is performed with sedated animals but sometimes it is performed on awake animals engaged in a behavioral event, such as a thirsty rat whisking a particular sandpaper grade previously paired with water in order to measure the corresponding patterns of neuronal firing at the decision point.
* Multielectrode recording – The use of a bundle of fine electrodes to record the simultaneous activity of up to hundreds of neurons.
* Functional magnetic resonance imaging – fMRI, a technique most frequently applied on human subjects, in which changes in cerebral blood flow can be detected in an MRI apparatus and are taken to indicate relative activity of larger scale brain regions (i.e., on the order of hundreds of thousands of neurons).
*Positron emission tomography - PET detects particles called photons using a 3-D nuclear medicine examination. These particles are emitted by injections of radioisotopes such as fluorine. PET imaging reveal the pathological processes which predict anatomic changes making it important for detecting, diagnosing and characterising many pathologies.
* Electroencephalography – EEG, and the derivative technique of event-related potentials, in which scalp electrodes monitor the average activity of neurons in the cortex (again, used most frequently with human subjects). This technique uses different types of electrodes for recording systems such as needle electrodes and saline-based electrodes. EEG allows for the investigation of mental disorders, sleep disorders and physiology. It can monitor brain development and cognitive engagement.
* Functional neuroanatomy – A more complex counterpart of phrenology. The expression of some anatomical marker is taken to reflect neural activity. For example, the expression of immediate early genes is thought to be caused by vigorous neural activity. Likewise, the injection of 2-deoxyglucose prior to some behavioral task can be followed by anatomical localization of that chemical; it is taken up by neurons that are electrically active.
* Magnetoencephalography – MEG shows the functioning of the human brain through the measurement of electromagnetic activity. Measuring the magnetic fields created by the electric current flowing within the neurons identifies brain activity associated with various human functions in real time, with millimeter spatial accuracy. Clinicians can noninvasively obtain data to help them assess neurological disorders and plan surgical treatments.

=== Genetic techniques ===

* QTL mapping – The influence of a gene in some behavior can be statistically inferred by studying inbred strains of some species, most commonly mice. The recent sequencing of the genome of many species, most notably mice, has facilitated this technique.
* Selective breeding – Organisms, often mice, may be bred selectively among inbred strains to create a recombinant congenic strain. This might be done to isolate an experimentally interesting stretch of DNA derived from one strain on the background genome of another strain to allow stronger inferences about the role of that stretch of DNA.
* Genetic engineering – The genome may also be experimentally-manipulated; for example, knockout mice can be engineered to lack a particular gene, or a gene may be expressed in a strain which does not normally do so (the &#x27;transgenic&#x27;). Advanced techniques may also permit the expression or suppression of a gene to occur by injection of some regulating chemical.

=== Quantifying behavior ===

* Markerless pose estimation – The advancement of computer vision techniques in recent years have allowed for precise quantifications of animal movements without needing to fit physical markers onto the subject. On high-speed video captured in a behavioral assay, keypoints from the subject can be extracted frame-by-frame, which is often useful to analyze in tandem with neural recordings/manipulations. Analyses can be conducted on how keypoints (i.e. parts of the animal) move within different phases of a particular behavior (on a short timescale), or throughout an animal&#x27;s behavioral repertoire (longer timescale). These keypoint changes can be compared with corresponding changes in neural activity. A machine learning approach can also be used to identify specific behaviors (e.g. forward walking, turning, grooming, courtship, etc.), and quantify the dynamics of transitions between behaviors.

== Other research methods ==

Computational models - Using a computer to formulate real-world problems to develop solutions. Although this method is often focused in computer science, it has begun to move towards other areas of study. For example, psychology is one of these areas. Computational models allow researchers in psychology to enhance their understanding of the functions and developments in nervous systems. Examples of methods include the modelling of neurons, networks and brain systems and theoretical analysis. Computational methods have a wide variety of roles including clarifying experiments, hypothesis testing and generating new insights. These techniques play an increasing role in the advancement of biological psychology.

=== Limitations and advantages ===

Different manipulations have advantages and limitations. Neural tissue destroyed as a primary consequence of a surgery, electric shock or neurotoxin can confound the results so that the physical trauma masks changes in the fundamental neurophysiological processes of interest.
For example, when using an electrolytic probe to create a purposeful lesion in a distinct region of the rat brain, surrounding tissue can be affected: so, a change in behavior exhibited by the experimental group post-surgery is to some degree a result of damage to surrounding neural tissue, rather than by a lesion of a distinct brain region. Most genetic manipulation techniques are also considered permanent. Temporary lesions can be achieved with advanced in genetic manipulations, for example, certain genes can now be switched on and off with diet. Pharmacological manipulations also allow blocking of certain neurotransmitters temporarily as the function returns to its previous state after the drug has been metabolized.

== Topic areas ==

In general, behavioral neuroscientists study various neuronal and biological processes underlying behavior, though limited by the need to use nonhuman animals. As a result, the bulk of literature in behavioral neuroscience deals with experiences and mental processes that are shared across different animal models such as:

*Sensation and perception
*Motivated behavior (hunger, thirst, sex)
*Control of movement
*Learning and memory
*Sleep and biological rhythms
*Emotion

However, with increasing technical sophistication and with the development of more precise noninvasive methods that can be applied to human subjects, behavioral neuroscientists are beginning to contribute to other classical topic areas of psychology, philosophy, and linguistics, such as:

*Language
*Reasoning and decision making
*Consciousness

Behavioral neuroscience has also had a strong history of contributing to the understanding of medical disorders, including those that fall under the purview of clinical psychology and biological psychopathology (also known as abnormal psychology). Although animal models do not exist for all mental illnesses, the field has contributed important therapeutic data on a variety of conditions, including:

*Parkinson&#x27;s disease, a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs motor skills and speech.
*Huntington&#x27;s disease, a rare inherited neurological disorder whose most obvious symptoms are abnormal body movements and a lack of coordination. It also affects a number of mental abilities and some aspects of personality.
*Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, a neurodegenerative disease that, in its most common form, is found in people over the age of 65 and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration, together with declining activities of daily living and by neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes.
*Clinical depression, a common psychiatric disorder, characterized by a persistent lowering of mood, loss of interest in usual activities and diminished ability to experience pleasure.
*Schizophrenia, a psychiatric diagnosis that describes a mental illness characterized by impairments in the perception or expression of reality, most commonly manifesting as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions or disorganized speech and thinking in the context of significant social or occupational dysfunction.
*Autism, a brain development disorder that impairs social interaction and communication, and causes restricted and repetitive behavior, all starting before a child is three years old.
*Anxiety, a physiological state characterized by cognitive, somatic, emotional, and behavioral components. These components combine to create the feelings that are typically recognized as fear, apprehension, or worry.
*Drug abuse, including alcoholism.

=== Research on topic areas ===

==== Cognition ====

Behavioral neuroscientists conduct research on various cognitive processes through the use of different neuroimaging techniques. Examples of cognitive research might involve examination of neural correlates during emotional information processing, such as one study that analyzed the relationship between subjective affect and neural reactivity during sustained processing of positive (savoring) and negative (rumination) emotion. The aim of the study was to analyze whether repetitive positive thinking (seen as being beneficial) and repetitive negative thinking (significantly related to worse mental health) would have similar underlying neural mechanisms. Researchers found that the individuals who had a more intense positive affect during savoring, were also the same individuals who had a more intense negative affect during rumination. fMRI data showed similar activations in brain regions during both rumination and savoring, suggesting shared neural mechanisms between the two types of repetitive thinking. The results of the study suggest there are similarities, both subjectively and mechanistically, with repetitive thinking about positive and negative emotions. This overall suggests shared neural mechanisms by which sustained emotional processing of both positive and negative information occurs.

==== Stress ====
Research within the field of behavioral neuroscience involves looking at the complex neuroanatomy underlying different emotional processes, such as stress. Godoy et al. (2018) did so by providing an in-depth analyzation of the neurobiological underpinnings of the stress response. The article features on an overview on the historical development of stress research and its importance leading up to research related to both physical and psychological stressors today. The authors explored various significators of stress and their corresponding neuroanatomical processing, along with the temporal dynamics of both acute and chronic stress and its effects on the brain. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive scientific overview of stress through a neurobiological lens, highlighting the importance of our current knowledge in stress-related research areas today.

<text>The Ogdensburg Agreement was an agreement concluded between Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Heuvelton near Ogdensburg, New York on August 17, 1940. It outlined a permanent plan for mutual defense overseas between the United States and Canada and established the Permanent Joint Board of Defense.

==History and Rationale==
Although Canada and the United States had long been economic partners, Canada had always considered the United Kingdom as its primary military partner. While Canada had been granted independence in its foreign policy from Britain in 1931, Canada&#x27;s membership in the Commonwealth of Nations, the strength of the British Empire, and the historic and cultural ties between them made a military alliance with the United States seem unnecessary. Most Canadians believed that Britain could provide for all of Canada&#x27;s defence needs.

Canada had declared war on Nazi Germany shortly after the Second World War began in early September 1939 but the United States remained neutral. By mid-1940, the situation in Europe had grown dire; Germany&#x27;s military successes had led to the occupation of most of Europe, and most importantly, France, which surrendered in June 1940. With Germany in control or allied with nearly all of continental Europe, it began to develop plans for an invasion of the British Isles. Germany&#x27;s seemingly unstoppable military, its submarine campaign against British merchant shipping, and its neutrality pact with the Soviet Union, convinced many, including American President Franklin Roosevelt, that Britain itself would soon be invaded or forced to surrender.

By July 1940, Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, along with a growing number of Canadians, was becoming increasingly concerned that Britain would fall and that Canada, with its small population and abundant natural resources, would become Germany&#x27;s next target. In addition to transferring its gold reserves to Canada at the beginning of the war, the British government had also prepared a contingency plan (which was largely kept secret to avoid hurting morale) to evacuate the Royal family, the government and as many critical military and scientific personnel to Canada as possible if the British Isles fell to Germany. These factors only increased concerns that Germany would eventually target Canada for its next conquest.
Both Canada and the United States recognized this threat. Subsequently, it was the United States that initiated preliminary military discussions that became formative in July 1940. On August 18, Roosevelt and King met inland from the border town of Ogdensburg, New York. Roosevelt outlined his plan to create a joint board to oversee the defence of both nations, not just for the duration of the current crisis, but as a permanent body. King immediately agreed, and the Permanent Joint Board on Defence was created.

Most Canadians supported this agreement, which was soon known as the Ogdensburg Agreement, as they deemed it necessary not only for security purposes but also to improve relations with the United States (it was also hoped that the agreement would help pull the United States into the war). However, some Canadians, most notably former Conservative prime minister Arthur Meighen were furious - they argued that by signing this agreement, Canada was not only abandoning Britain but was effectively placing itself under the control of the United States. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was also angry, stating that &quot;all these transactions will be judged [at the end of the war] in a mood different to that prevailing while the issue still hangs in the balance.&quot; King&#x27;s government recognized these concerns; Canadian negotiators resolutely refused to give the United States control of Canada&#x27;s forces, and rejected proposals to integrate much of the country&#x27;s defences into Washington&#x27;s Northeast and Northwest Defence Commands. King&#x27;s approach satisfied most Canadians - although co-operation with the United States was essential, it did not mean abandoning Canada&#x27;s national interests.

==Since World War II==
The agreement inaugurated closer Canadian-United States military co-operation and established the Permanent Joint Board of Defence, which remains as the senior advisory body on continental security and which is composed of two national sections made up of diplomatic and military representatives. For seven decades its meetings have served as a window on Canada-U.S.A. Defence relations. Canadian-U.S.A. military cooperation was further enhanced by the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 but the Board continued to serve in an important capacity for bilateral military relations and coordination.

Initially, it was argued that Ogdensburg Agreement involved Canada abandoning Britain in favour of the United States on matters of defence. However, the creation of the NATO in 1949 (which linked Canada and the United States into a collective security agreement with Britain and Western Europe) helped to alleviate these concerns.

The Board has examined virtually every important joint defence measure undertaken since the end of World War II, including construction of the Distant Early Warning Line of radars and the creation of the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) in 1958.

<doc id="605482" wikidata="Q4900205" url="?curid=605482" title="Beyond the Veil (comics)">
<text>Beyond the Veil is the title of the supernatural themed story created by writer and illustrator Rick Law. Originating in 1995 as a black and white comic series published in &quot;This Prophecy&quot;.

== Story ==
A contemporary fantasy, &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot; follows a male character (whose appearance is speculated to be based on the artist) who, after finding a pair of rose colored glasses, proceeds to &quot;see things&quot;, experiencing visions and other manifestations that may be related to the end of the world. The visions progress, and the character struggles with his new foreknowledge and (as he starts to experience the phenomena outside of wearing the glasses) the question of whether this &quot;sight&quot; is a product of the glasses, or if they are merely a catalyst for his new &quot;vision.&quot;

== Philosophy ==
The series heavily explores spiritual themes, attributable to the author&#x27;s professed Christian faith. The title is expressive of the concept that there is a spiritual realm or dimension that exists parallel to this one.

<text>Baix Penedès () is a comarca in the Penedès region, in Catalonia, Spain. The area has been settled since the times of the Iberians, with ancient ruins remaining in Banyeres at &quot;Can Canyís&quot;, at the village of &quot;Guàrdies&quot; and in Calafell at the villages of &quot;Toixoneres&quot; and &quot;la Ciutadella&quot; (&quot;The Citadel&quot;). The capital is El Vendrell.

== Municipalities ==

== Castellers ==
Baix Penedès has one of the longest-lived traditions of castellers in Catalonia. (Castellers practice the traditional Catalan art/sport of making human pyramids.) The comarcal capital, el Vendrell, has a monument dedicated to castellers.

The most important competitions of Castellers in the comarca occur each year as part of the August festival in honor of the Virgin Mary at Bisbal and on the fourth Sunday of August at L&#x27;Arboç, with castellers from all over Catalonia.

== People from Baix Penedès ==
Among the most important historical figures from Baix Penedès are:

*Àngel Guimerà (1845–1924): writer. Guimerà was originally from the Canary Islands, but his mother was from el Vendrell, and he eventually settled there in his ancestral home, &quot;cal Guimerà&quot;.
*Pablo Casals (1876–1973): cellist and composer. The house-museum &quot;vila Casals&quot; is at Sant Salvador, as is a concert hall, l&quot;&#x27;Auditori Pau Casals&quot;.
*Aureli Maria Escarré (1908–1968): abbot of Montserrat. Since 1978, there has been a monument to him in his home village of l&#x27;Arboç, where his ancestral home is on the main street.
*Andreu Nin (1892–1937) dissident Communist revolutionary in the Spanish Civil War)

<doc id="605484" wikidata="Q444995" url="?curid=605484" title="Sarah Orne Jewett">
<text>Theodora Sarah Orne Jewett (September 3, 1849 – June 24, 1909) was an American novelist, short story writer and poet, best known for her local color works set along or near the southern coast of Maine. Jewett is recognized as an important practitioner of American literary regionalism.

==Early life==
Sarah Orne Jewett was born in South Berwick, Maine, on September 3, 1849. Her family had been residents of New England for many generations.
Jewett&#x27;s father, Theodore Herman Jewett, was a doctor specializing in &quot;obstetrics and diseases of women and children,&quot; and Jewett often accompanied him on his rounds, becoming acquainted with the sights and sounds of her native land and its people. Her mother was Caroline Frances (Perry). As treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, a condition that developed in her early childhood, Jewett was sent on frequent walks and through them also developed a love of nature. In later life, Jewett often visited Boston, where she was acquainted with many of the most influential literary figures of her day; but she always returned to South Berwick, small seaports near which were the inspiration for the towns of &quot;Deephaven&quot; and &quot;Dunnet Landing&quot; in her stories.

Jewett was educated at Miss Olive Rayne&#x27;s school and then at Berwick Academy, graduating in 1866. She supplemented her education with reading in her extensive family library. Jewett was &quot;never overtly religious&quot;, but after she joined the Episcopal church in 1871, she explored less conventional religious ideas. For example, her friendship with Harvard law professor Theophilus Parsons stimulated an interest in the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, an eighteenth-century Swedish scientist and theologian, who believed that the Divine &quot;was present in innumerable, joined forms — a concept underlying Jewett&#x27;s belief in individual responsibility.&quot;

==Career==

In 1868 at age 18, Jewett published her first important story, &quot;Jenny Garrow&#x27;s Lovers,&quot; in &quot;The Flag of Our Union&quot;, and her reputation grew throughout the 1870s and 1880s. Jewett used the pen name &quot;Alice Eliot&quot; or &quot;A. C. Eliot&quot; for her early stories. Her literary importance arises from her careful, if subdued, vignettes of country life that reflect a contemporary interest in local color rather than in plot. Jewett possessed a keen descriptive gift that William Dean Howells called &quot;an uncommon feeling for talk — I hear your people.&quot; Jewett made her reputation with the novella &quot;The Country of the Pointed Firs&quot; (1896). &quot;A Country Doctor&quot; (1884), a novel reflecting her father and her early ambitions for a medical career, and &quot;A White Heron&quot; (1886), a collection of short stories that are among her finest work. Some of Jewett&#x27;s poetry was collected in &quot;Verses&quot; (1916), and she also wrote three children&#x27;s books. Willa Cather described Jewett as a significant influence on her development as a writer, and &quot;feminist critics have since championed her writing for its rich account of women&#x27;s lives and voices.&quot; Cather dedicated her 1913 novel &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;, based upon memories of her childhood in Nebraska, to Jewett. In 1901 Bowdoin College conferred an honorary doctorate of literature on Jewett, the first woman to be granted an honorary degree by Bowdoin. In Jewett&#x27;s obituary in 1909, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; remarked on the strength that lay in &quot;the detail of her work, in fine touches, in simplicity.&quot;

==Personal life==
 Jewett&#x27;s works featuring relationships between women often mirrored her own life and friendships. Jewett&#x27;s letters and diaries reveal that as a young woman, Jewett had close relationships with several women, including Grace Gordon, Kate Birckhead, Georgie Halliburton, Ella Walworth, and Ellen Mason. For instance, from evidence in her diary, Jewett appears to have had an intense crush on Kate Birckhead. Jewett later established a close friendship with writer Annie Adams Fields (1834–1915) and her husband, publisher James T. Fields, editor of the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. 

After the sudden death of James Fields in 1881, Jewett paid a condolence visit to Annie Fields. Fields found solace in subsequent visits from Jewett and their relationship grew. Jewett and Fields began living together in what was then termed a &quot;Boston marriage&quot; in Fields&#x27;s homes in Manchester-by-the-Sea, MA, and at 148 Charles Street in Boston. Though some scholars have offered a cautious appraisal of the nature of the relationship between Jewett and Fields, modern scholarship documents evidence that Jewett and Fields considered themselves married in a relationship lasting until Jewett&#x27;s death nearly thirty years later. Jewett and Fields exchanged rings and vows, and on the one-year anniversary of their vows, Jewett wrote a poem, &quot;Do You Remember, Darling,&quot; depicting her commitment to and love of Fields.

Jewett and Fields socialized with other women in &quot;Boston marriages.&quot; Both women &quot;found friendship, humor, and literary encouragement&quot; in one another&#x27;s company, traveling to Europe together and hosting &quot;American and European literati.&quot; In France Jewett met Thérèse Blanc-Bentzon with whom she had long corresponded and who translated some of her stories for publication in France. Jewett&#x27;s poetry, much of it unpublished, includes approximately thirty love poems or fragments of poems written to women which illustrate the intensity of her feelings toward them. Jewett also wrote about romantic attachments between women in her novel &quot;Deephaven&quot; (1877), which described her relationship with Annie Adams Fields, and in her short story &quot;Martha&#x27;s Lady&quot; (1897). 

On September 3, 1902, Jewett was injured in a carriage accident that all but ended her writing career. She was paralyzed by a stroke in March 1909, and she died in her South Berwick home after suffering another stroke on June 24, 1909. 

Annie Adams Fields published her correspondence with Jewett in 1911. Women in Boston marriages in the 19th century most often kept their correspondence private or destroyed it, so the survival and publication of Jewett and Fields&#x27; letters provides rare documentation of one of the most famous Boston marriages of the time. Fields edited the correspondence to remove more personal information leading some biographers to describe Jewett and Fields&#x27;s relationship as a friendship, but the correspondence depicts their deep love for each other. 

==Jewett House==
The Sarah Orne Jewett House, the Georgian home of the Jewett family, built in 1774 and overlooking Central Square at South Berwick, is a National Historic Landmark and Historic New England museum. Jewett and her sister Mary inherited the house in 1887.

<text>Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System, or Nachos, is instructional software for teaching undergraduate, and potentially graduate level operating systems courses. It was developed at the University of California, Berkeley, designed by Thomas Anderson, and is used by numerous schools around the world.

Originally written in C++ for MIPS, Nachos runs as a user-process on a host operating system. A MIPS simulator executes the code for any user programs running on top of the Nachos operating system. Ports of the Nachos code exist for a variety of architectures.

In addition to the Nachos code, a number of assignments are provided with the Nachos system. The goal of Nachos is to introduce students to concepts in operating system design and implementation by requiring them to implement significant pieces of functionality within the Nachos system.

In Nachos&#x27; case, Operating System simulator simply means that you can run an OS (a guest OS) on top of another one (the host OS), similar to Bochs/VMware. It features emulation for:
* A CPU (a MIPS CPU)
* A hard drive 
* An interrupt controller, timer, and misc. other components
which are there to run the Nachos user space applications. That means that you can write programs for Nachos, compile them with a real compiler (an old gcc compiler that produces code for MIPS) and run them. The Nachos kernel instead is compiled to the platform of the Host OS and thus runs natively on the Host OS&#x27; CPU.

Nachos version 3.4 has been the stable, commonly used version of Nachos for many years. Nachos version 4.0 has existed as a beta since approximately 1996.

==Implementation==
Nachos has various modules implementing the functionality of a basic operating system. The wrapper functions for various system calls of the OS kernel are generally implemented in a manner similar to that of the UNIX system calls
. Various parts of the OS are instantiated as objects using the native code. For example, a class codice_1is used as the master class of the simulated machine. It contains various objects, such as codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, etc. which are defined to simulate various hardware aspects.

===Major components===
NachOS Machine - Nachos simulates a machine that roughly approximates the MIPS architecture. The machine has registers, memory and a CPU. The Nachos/MIPS machine is implemented by the Machine object, an instance of which is created when Nachos starts up. It contains methods like Run, ReadRegister, WriteRegister, etc. It also defines an interrupt object to handle interrupts. Timer and statistics are also implemented in this.

NachOS Threads - In NachOS a thread class is defined. A thread has an associated state with it which may be ready, running, blocked or just created. The thread object has various methods like PutThreadToSleep, YieldCPU, ThreadFork, ThreadStackAllocate, etc. Each thread runs at a virtual address space.

NachOS UserPrograms - Nachos runs user programs in their own private address space. Nachos can run any MIPS binary, assuming that it restricts itself to only making system calls that Nachos understands. In Unix, &quot;a.out&quot; files are stored in &quot;coff&quot; format. Nachos requires that executables be in the simpler &quot;Noff&quot; format. To convert binaries of one format to the other, use the coff2noff program.

==Successors==
As Nachos has not been in active development for a number of years, and possesses a number of recognized flaws (particularly with regards to portability: Nachos relies on MIPS assembly code, and requires porting to run on x86 architecture), successor projects have been initiated. In 2004, Stanford University created Pintos, a Nachos-inspired system written in C and designed to run on actual x86 hardware. In 2000, Dan Hettena at UC Berkeley ported Nachos to Java as Nachos 5.0j, in an effort to make Nachos more portable, more accessible to undergraduates, and less susceptible to subtle bugs in student code that had in earlier versions often dominated student project development time. Another Java-based version was created by Professor Peter Druschel at Rice University. It was later adapted by Professor Eugene Stark at Stony Brook University in 2003 and applied in the operating systems course. At Graz University of Technology (Austria), a system called SWEB (&quot;Schon wieder ein Betriebssystem&quot;) has been implemented and is used to teach operating system principles.

<doc id="605486" wikidata="Q3079112" url="?curid=605486" title="Chequamegon–Nicolet National Forest">
<text>The Chequamegon–Nicolet National Forest (; the &quot;q&quot; is silent) is a U.S. National Forest in northern Wisconsin in the United States. Due to logging in the early part of the 20th century, very little old growth forest remains. Some of the trees there were planted by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. The national forest land trees and vegetation are part of the North Woods Ecoregion that prevails throughout the upper Great Lakes region.

Legally two separate national forests—the Chequamegon National Forest and the Nicolet National Forest—the areas were established by presidential proclamations in 1933 and have been managed as one unit since 1998.

The Chequamegon National Forest comprises three units in the north-central part of the state totaling . In descending order of forestland area, it is located in parts of Bayfield, Ashland, Price, Sawyer, Taylor, and Vilas counties. Forest headquarters are in Park Falls. There are local ranger district offices in Glidden, Hayward, Medford, Park Falls, and Washburn. Moquah Barrens Research Natural Area is located with the Chequamegon. Lying within the Chequamegon are two officially designated wilderness areas of the National Wilderness Preservation System. These are the Porcupine Lake Wilderness and the Rainbow Lake Wilderness.

The Nicolet National Forest covers of northeastern Wisconsin. It is located in parts of Forest, Oconto, Florence, Vilas, Langlade, and Oneida counties. The forest headquarters are in Rhinelander. There are local ranger district offices in Eagle River, Florence, Lakewood, and Laona. Bose Lake Hemlock Hardwoods and the Franklin Lake Campground are located in the Nicolet. Lying within the Nicolet are three wildernesses—the Blackjack Springs Wilderness, the Headwaters Wilderness, and the Whisker Lake Wilderness.

==Flora, fauna, and funga==
Remote areas of uplands, bogs, wetlands, muskegs, rivers, streams, pine savannas, meadows and many glacial lakes are found throughout these forests. Native tree species include &quot;Acer saccharum&quot; (sugar maple), &quot;Acer rubrum&quot; (red maple), and &quot;Acer spicatum&quot; (mountain maple), white, red, and black oaks, aspen, beech, basswood, sumac, and paper, yellow, and river birch. Coniferous trees, including red, white, and jack pine, white spruce and balsam fir are abundant due to a dense second growth. Eastern hemlock are also present as this is the westernmost limit of its distribution. Tamarack/black spruce bogs, cedar swamps and alder thickets are common. Blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, serviceberries, ferns, mosses, cattails, and mushrooms also grow here, as well as many more shrubs and wildflowers.

White-tailed deer are numerous and are hit by motorists on roads in northern Wisconsin year-round. Black bears, foxes, raccoons, rabbits, beavers, river otters, squirrels, chipmunks, pheasants, grouse and wild turkeys are popular game in the woods. Elk and wolves(Wolves have not been reintroduced to Wisconsin ) have been reintroduced and there have been sightings of moose and pine marten. Bird species include northern cardinal, blue jay, Canada jay, common raven, boreal and black-capped chickadees, black-backed and pileated woodpeckers, red-winged blackbirds, owls, ducks, common loons, bald eagles, evening grosbeaks, red and white-winged crossbills and many species of thrushes, sparrows and warblers. Brook trout, rainbow trout, and brown trout are found in many miles of excellent streams. Walleye, small and largemouth bass, crappie, northern pike, and many species of panfish make the area&#x27;s lakes famous for freshwater fishing. A record making muskellunge, Wisconsin&#x27;s state fish, was caught in these waters. The beauty, heritage, and recreational opportunities of these forests draw thousands of tourists to the Chequamegon–Nicolet area every year.

These national forests are best known for recreation, including camping, hiking, fishing, cross country skiing, and snowmobiling.

Clam Lake in Chequamegon National Forest was also home to one of the two extremely low frequency antennae in the United States.

<text>The Sisterhood of Our Lady of the Good Death () is a small Afro-Catholic religious group in the state of Bahia, Brazil.

Founded in the early 19th century as a Church-sponsored beneficent Sisterhood for female African slaves and former slaves, it became one of the oldest and most respected worship groups for Candomblé, the major African-based religion in Brazil. Presently reduced to about thirty members (from 200 or so at its height), most of them over fifty, it still attracts worshipers every year, especially at its August festival.

==History==
The history of the &quot;Irmandade da Boa Morte&quot; (&quot;Sisterhood of the Good Death&quot;), a religious confraternity devoted to the Assumption of the Virgin, is part of the history of mass abduction of blacks from the African coast to the cane-growing catchment area around the port of Salvador, Bahia, known as the &quot;Recôncavo Baiano&quot;. Iberian adventurers built several towns in this area, one of them being Cachoeira, which was the second most important economic center in Bahia for three centuries.

===Origin of confraternities===
Confraternities proliferated during the 19th century, when the country was independent but still lived under the regime of slavery. For each profession, race and nation — because the African slaves and their descendants came from different places with different cultures — a separate &quot;irmandade&quot; was founded. There were confraternities for the rich, poor, musicians, blacks, whites, etc. There were almost none for women and in the male confraternities women entered as dependents to ensure they would receive benefits from the corporation after the death of their husbands. For the confraternity to operate, says historian João José Reis, a church had to welcome it and its statutes had to be approved by an ecclesiastical authority.

In a patriarchal society marked by racial and ethnic differences, the confraternity is made up exclusively of black women, which gives this Afro-Catholic manifestation — as some consider it — a certain fame. It is known both as an expression of Brazilian baroque Catholicism, with its distinctive street processions, and for its tendency to include in religious festivals profane rituals punctuated by a lot of samba and banqueting.

Besides the gender and race of the confraternity&#x27;s members, their status as former slaves and descendants of slaves is an important social characteristic without which it would be difficult to understand many aspects of the confraternity&#x27;s religious commitments. The former slaves have demonstrated enormous adroitness in worshiping in the religion of those in power without letting go of their ancestral beliefs, as well as in the ways they defend the interests of their followers and represent them socially and politically.

===Date of foundation===
No one really knows in what year the Sisterhood of the Good Death was founded. Odorico speculates that the organized devotion began in 1820 in the Church of Rosário in Barroquinha, a borough of Salvador; and that &quot;Gêges&quot; (blacks of the Ewe and Fon ethnicities) who moved from there to Cachoeira were responsible for organizing it. Others speak of that period too, but disagree about the nation of the pioneers, saying they were freed Ketus (ethnic Yorubas). It seems that the membership of the confraternity had a variety of ethnic origins and that they numbered more than a hundred in the first years.

Historically, the year 1820 makes sense. Since early in the nineteenth century, progress had been afoot in the Recôncavo and new agricultural and industrial techniques were introduced there. While the sugar economy was experiencing difficulties, tobacco gained new strength when it attracted the interest of German capital following the political independence of Brazil. The opening of motorized shipping lines strengthened the breeze of economic renewal, stimulating the integration of the Recôncavo with the provincial capital and increasing trade. This in turn encouraged the formation of strong links between black slaves in many cities, especially Salvador and Cachoeira.

Jeferson Bacelar notes that the 1820s, especially the first three years of the decade, were marked by a process of agitation and excitement among the people of Bahia, many of whom - regardless of social class - were involved in a struggle for Independence that was marked by a strong anti-Portuguese spirit and armed skirmishes. The easing of tension between masters and slaves elicited by this momentary “unity” contributed to the permanent removal of blacks to the cities of the Recôncavo, where slaveowners were very interested in solving the conflict and, to defend their interests, armed the slaves and used them against the Portuguese. This exceptional state of affairs resulted in a large number of religious and civil initiatives by the slaves, among them, perhaps, the Irmandade da Boa Morte. Antônio Moraes Ribeiro&#x27;s research associates the confraternity&#x27;s emergence from the slave quarters with the abolitionist atmosphere after the brutally crushed revolt of Muslim slaves in Bahia in 1835. Perhaps that is the origin of the clearly Islamic touch to the confraternity&#x27;s very beautiful traditional clothes. As Raul Lody notes, the costume&#x27;s impressiveness is heightened by the use of a turban. Antônio Moraes believes that one of the probable leaders of the Islamic Revolt, Luiza Mahim, was personally involved in the founding of the confraternity after her flight from Salvador to the Recôncavo.

The early nineteenth century narrative for formation holds more credence when looking at correspondences for the time. One such correspondence from 1854 comes from a local deputy who wrote to the justice department requesting reinforcements to handle the Festival of Our Lady of the Good Death which was set to take place in Salvador. This correspondence shows that by 1854 the Order must have had a considerable following and was well known in the time if police were asking for reinforcements over a month before the festival was set to take place.

===From Church to Church===
Luiz Cláudio Nascimento, an historian from Cachoeira, says that the first liturgies of the black Sisterhood were held in the Church of the Third Order of Carmo, traditionally used by the local elites. Later the sisters moved to the Church of Santa Bárbara in the Santa Casa de Misericórdia hospital, where there are images of Our Lady of Glory and Our Lady of the Good Death. From there they moved to the Church of Amparo (which was demolished in 1946 and replaced by a middle class housing project). They left that church for the Parish Church (&quot;Igreja Matriz&quot;), and then went to the Church of Ajuda.

Many confraternities built their own churches. This was the case of the Church of Rosário in Barroquinha. The Sisterhood of Good Death maintained close contact with this church and its confraternity.

===Social role===
The religious confraternities of the 19th century — like the secular ones such as the Society for the Protection of the Handicapped, a case studied by the anthropologist Julio Braga — did more than revere Catholic saints and the &quot;orixás&quot;, or Afro-Brazilian divinities, of their members. While they outwardly met ecclesiastical and legal requirements, they become exclusive guilds that worked behind the scenes for the interests of their members. As respected organizations of solidarity, they were at the same time living expressions of inter-ethnic exchange and an ambiguous instrument of social control, whose participants were creative &quot;managers&quot;.

The confraternity always made its members contribute. One-off membership and annual fees, alms collected and other forms of income were used for a variety of purposes: purchases of freedom from slavery, festivals, religious obligations, payments for masses, charity, clothing. In the case of Boa Morte, whose members were relatively poor and almost all elderly—from 50 to 70 years old—the funds raised during members&#x27; lifetimes were always meant to pay for a decent funeral, whose preparations, given the dual religious activities of its members, required both rigor and understanding, besides being a nest-egg for the burial. Funds also paid for burial plots for individual members because most cemeteries restricted black burials in white cemeteries. The sisters also typically set aside some small amount of funds for the family of the deceased.

More recently, confraternities, and especially the Order of Our Lady of the Good Death, have been considered among the first examples of feminism in Brazil and the traditions that carry on today have been associated with the early roots of Brazilian feminism. The Order has spoken out on a number of social issues including poverty, police violence, and racial and gender equality and continues to act as a grassroots movement for social issues in Bahia. The sisters have also pushed issues of African resilience from their early years and have made it their mission to assure that all black lives could be filled with dignity. In 2018, activist and Rio de Janeiro city council member Marielle Franco, who was known for her work on social issues such as reproductive rights, police brutality, and gender equality, was assassinated in Rio de Janeiro. The Order’s festival that year honored her legacy and other black women who had fought for equal rights as they have honored individuals in this way for decades.

== Candomblé ==
In time the Sisterhood has lessened its connection to the Catholic Church and has become a landmark of Candomblé, the main African-based religion of Brazil. Candomblé is a spiritist religion, that worships a complex pantheon of deities or guardian spirits, the &quot;Orixás&quot;. At Candomblé rituals, the Orixás are invoked and &quot;incorporate&quot; in the officiating priests.

Due to their secret nature the inner rites of the Sisterhood, linked to the worship of the Orixás, have still not been the object of an ethnographic interpretation. What has been studied is the exterior part of the worship, which uses almost entirely Catholic symbols, appropriated by Afro-Brazilian religion. The high point of the Sisterhood&#x27;s activities is the Festival of Our Lady of the Good Death, held every year in Cachoeira.

===Origins of the Festival===
The Sisterhood&#x27;s Festival brings together elements of Candomblé worship with an ancient Christian festival, the Assumption of the Virgin, whose origins are in the Orient. The festival reached Rome in the 7th century, spread through the Catholic world over the next two centuries, and was eventually brought from Portugal to Brazil, where it was known as the festival of Our Lady of August.

Devotion to the Good Death was just as common in colonial and imperial Brazil as the confraternities. It has always been a popular cult. In the Church of Our Lady of Rosário in Barroquinha it became stronger and more consistent. There was considerable Gêge-Nagô presence there and the celebrations described by writers like Silva Campos were similar to contemporary practices in Cachoeira. One of the most respected candomblé centers in Bahia originated there; founded in the 18th century, the &quot;Casa Branca center in Engenho Velho da Federação&quot; in Salvador has been studied by Renato da Silveira.

===Peculiar interpretation===
The Sisterhood&#x27;s version of the Festival became a popular devotion with racial features as the Sisterhood gathered mainly black and mixed-race women, and acquired a unique interpretation with its own characteristics. For that reason the group has always caused conflict with church authorities.

Candomblé lent elements of its belief system to a practice that was originally Catholic, as well as socio-historical components of the hard reality of slavery, of a captivity that made martyrs of those in the diaspora.

Veneration of Our Lady of the Good Death came to have social significance as it allowed slaves to gather, maintain their religiosity in a hostile environment and shape a corporate instrument for defending and valuing of individuals. It became, for all of these reasons, an unrivaled means of celebrating life.

===The Festivities===
At the beginning of August a long schedule of public events brings people from everywhere to Cachoeira, to what Moraes Ribeiro considers the most representative living document of Brazilian, baroque, Ibero-African religiosity. Suppers, parades, masses, processions, &quot;samba-de-roda&quot; (a traditional form of playing and dancing the samba in a circle) put the confraternity in the center of events in this provincial city and, ultimately, in the main newspapers and news networks of the capital.

The first day of the festival begins of the Friday closest to August 15 which is the traditional day of the Feast of the Assumption. The sisters, wearing all white, carry a reclining statue of Our Lady of the Good Death throughout the streets of Cachoeira in a quite procession and place the statue at the foot of the altar in their chapel. The procession shares the joint task of commemorating Mary and individuals who died in the last year. After the procession, the sisters hold confession and serve a holy dinner of white meats since they refrain from red meat on the day of the festival. The significance of the color white is linked to both Mary’s purity and to the Candomblé deity Oxalá who is associated with the dawn and the creation of the universe. The second day of the festival, the sisters of the Order spend the day preparing the food for the days of feasting which will take place in the latter half of the festival. In the evening, there is a mourning or funerary mass for Mary held in the chapel followed by a procession through the streets with the statue of Our Lady of the Good Death which acts as a recreation of the burial of Mary. During this procession, the sisters wear white clothing with black sashes and carry crosses along with the statue. After the procession, the sisters return the statue of Our Lady of the Good Death to the museum where it resides the rest of the year and remove the statue of Our Lady of Glory from the museum to be used in the festivities of the next day.

The third day of the festival is meant to celebrate the Catholic celebration of the Feast of the Assumption and marks the final traditional Catholic day of celebration. The Feast of the Assumption is celebrated each year by Catholics worldwide to celebrate the assumption, or total transfer of body and soul, of Mary into heaven after her death which is where the Order got the term “Good Death.” The day marks a turning point in the festival, going from a somber ritual to a joyous mass celebrating the assumption of Mary. This mass is followed by a parade through the streets with the statue of Our Lady of Glory and is orchestrated by one of the local bands that plays during the procession. In celebration, the sisters wear red satin sashes and bring out their finest attire and jewelry. After the parade and mass, the food that they prepared the day before is completed and a feast is held for the members of the town and visitors who travelled to watch the celebration. Beginning that evening, the sisters and others begin to dance the samba to show their faith to Mary and the other saints while also bringing in traditional Candomblé practices. This specific and traditional mix of African music and African dance goes back decades and was noted by government officials as far back as 1864 in Salvador, Brazil where the Order of the Good Death originated.

Candomblé traditions are incorporated in several ways during the festivities. The procession accompanied by music ties back to Candomblé traditions and celebrations. Many of the foods and drinks served in the days following the Feast of the Assumption have Candomblé and Brazilian roots including cachaca or sugarcane rum and caruru which is a blend of okra, nuts, and shrimp. Dancing the Samba during the latter half of the festival ties back to Candomblé traditions. The full festivities end when the sisters go to the river and make an offering of food and flowers which also is an action rooted in the Candomblé tradition.

==Hierarchy and worship==

Like all confraternities of Bahia, the Boa Morte has an internal hierarchy that administers the everyday devotions of its members. The leadership is made up of four sisters, responsible for organizing the public festival in August. They are replaced each year. At the top, in the most prominent position of the Irmandade da Boa Morte, is the Perpetual Judge, who is the eldest member. There follow the posts of Attorney General, Provider, Treasurer and Scribe; the first is at the head of religious and profane activities.

===Novitiate===
Novices must be attached to a candomblé center in the area—usually Gêge, Ketu or Nagô-Batá—and must profess religious syncretism. They go through an initiation that has a preparatory phase of three years during which they are known as &quot;sisters of the purse&quot; and their vocation is tested. Once they are accepted they can take positions of leadership and rise in the confraternity&#x27;s hierarchy every three years.

They all share the tasks of cooking, collecting funds, organizing ceremonial suppers, processions and the funerals of members according to religious precepts and unwritten statutory regulations. Elections are held each year. Votes are cast with grains of corn and beans; the former indicates a nay and the latter a favorable vote. As application of hierarchical differences and the rules regarding each position, all the sisters are on the same footing as servants of Our Lady. Besides being sisters in their devotion to her, they are sometimes sisters in candomblé and are almost always &quot;relatives&quot;—Africans and their descendants in Brazil broadened the concept of kinship to include all those who are of the same nation.

==Syncretism and cultural interchange==
African ancestry was reworked within Bahian religious institutions and the lay confraternities end up serving this process of cultural intercourse. The belief system has absorbed the values of the dominant culture in a functional and creative way so that, in the name of life, complex processes of syncretism and cultural appropriation take place. One example is the descent of Our Lady herself to the confraternity every seven years to direct the celebrations in person through the Attorney-General and celebrate among the living the relativity of death. Other examples are found in the symbols of clothing and food, where there is constant reference to the links between this world (&quot;Aiyê&quot;) and the other (&quot;Orun&quot;).

==Namesake==
The Order of the Good Death, a death acceptance organization founded in 2011, took its name from the Order of Our Lady of the Good Death.

<text>The Emergency Managers Weather Information Network (EMWIN) is a system for distributing a live stream of weather information in the United States. The backbone of the system is operated via satellite by the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS), but data are transmitted over radio repeaters by the NWS, citizens, and other organizations in many regions, and information can also be downloaded via the Internet. Local VHF/UHF radio rebroadcasts and older-generation EMWIN satellite systems operate at the speeds of 1200 and 9600 baud. EMWIN data consists of textual observational and forecast information, including a limited number of cloud and radar images. The new EMWIN, labeled EMWIN-N, began being upgraded in 2009. The upgrade continues through 2011 to ready older GOES satellites to provide a higher speed of 19.2 kbit/s. The data broadcasts are monetarily free with both local rebroadcasts and satellite feeds. EMWIN via Twitter may be done by anyone to spread information on all types of emergencies to virtually unlimited numbers of people in real time also.

EMWIN weather data is primarily transmitted over GOES satellites that observe the United States. The new satellites are the GOES-R series, and are designated GOES 16 and GOES 17.

On February 13, 2017 it suffered a service disruption.

<text>Pandiatonicism is a musical technique of using the diatonic (as opposed to the chromatic) scale without the limitations of functional tonality. Music using this technique is pandiatonic.

==History==
The term &quot;pandiatonicism&quot; was coined by Nicolas Slonimsky in the second edition of &quot;Music since 1900&quot; to describe chord formations of any number up to all seven degrees of the diatonic scale, &quot;used freely in democratic equality&quot;. Triads with added notes such as the sixth, seventh, or second (added tone chords) are the most common,) while the &quot;most elementary form&quot; is a nonharmonic bass. According to Slonimsky&#x27;s definition,
&quot;Pan-diatonicism&quot; sanctions the simultaneous use of any or all seven tones of the diatonic scale, with the bass determining the harmony. The chord-building remains tertian, with the seventh, ninth, or thirteenth chords being treated as consonances functionally equivalent to the fundamental triad. (The eleventh chord is shunned in tonic harmony because of its quartal connotations.) Pan-diatonicism, as consolidation of tonality, is the favorite technique of NEO-CLASSICISM .

Pandiatonic music typically uses the diatonic notes freely in dissonant combinations without conventional resolutions and/or without standard chord progressions, but always with a strong sense of tonality due to the absence of chromatics. &quot;Pandiatonicism possesses both tonal and modal aspects, with a distinct preference for major keys&quot;. Characteristic examples include the opening of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3, Alfredo Casella&#x27;s &quot;Valse diatonique&quot;, and Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Pulcinella&quot;. &quot;The functional importance of the primary triads...remains undiminished in pandiatonic harmony&quot;. An opposed point of view holds that pandiatonicism does not project a clear and stable tonic. Pandiatonicism is also referred to as &quot;white-note music,&quot; though in fact occasional accidentals may be present. Other composers who employed the technique are Maurice Ravel, Paul Hindemith, Darius Milhaud, Aaron Copland, and Roy Harris. Pandiatonicism is also employed in jazz (e.g., added sixth ninth chord) and in Henry Cowell&#x27;s tone clusters.

Slonimsky later came to regard pandiatonicism as a diatonic counterpart of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique, whereby melodies may be made up of seven different notes of the diatonic scale, and then be inverted, retrograded, or both. According to this system, &quot;strict pandiatonic counterpoint&quot; may use progressions of seven different notes in each voice, with no vertical duplication.

The term has been criticized as one of many by which, &quot;Stravinsky&#x27;s music, everywhere and at once, is made to represent or encompass every conceivable technique&quot;, and that has, &quot;become so vague a concept that it has very little meaning or use&quot;. Pandiatonic music is usually defined by what it is not, &quot;by the absence of traditional elements&quot;: chromatic, atonal, twelve-tone, functional, clear tonic, and/or traditional dissonance resolutions. &quot;It has been applied...to diatonic music lacking harmonic consistency [or]...centricity&quot;. Slonimsky himself, making fun of the definition, quoted a professor calling pandiatonicism &quot;C-major that sounds like hell&quot;.

Examples of pandiatonicism include the harmonies Aaron Copland used in his populist work, &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot;, and the minimalist music by Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and the later works of John Adams. William Mann describes The Beatles&#x27; &quot;This Boy&quot; as, &quot;harmonically...one of their most intriguing, with its chains of pandiatonic clusters&quot;.

<doc id="605501" wikidata="Q1129576" url="?curid=605501" title="Free-radical theory of aging">
<text>The free radical theory of aging states that organisms age because cells accumulate free radical damage over time. A free radical is any atom or molecule that has a single unpaired electron in an outer shell. While a few free radicals such as melanin are not chemically reactive, most biologically relevant free radicals are highly reactive. For most biological structures, free radical damage is closely associated with oxidative damage. Antioxidants are reducing agents, and limit oxidative damage to biological structures by passivating them from free radicals.

Strictly speaking, the free radical theory is only concerned with free radicals such as superoxide ( O2− ), but it has since been expanded to encompass oxidative damage from other reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), or peroxynitrite (OONO−).

Denham Harman first proposed the free radical theory of aging in the 1950s, and in the 1970s extended the idea to implicate mitochondrial production of ROS.

In some model organisms, such as yeast and &quot;Drosophila&quot;, there is evidence that reducing oxidative damage can extend lifespan. However, in mice, only 1 of the 18 genetic alterations (SOD-1 deletion) that block antioxidant defences, shortened lifespan. Similarly, in roundworms (&quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;), blocking the production of the naturally occurring antioxidant superoxide dismutase has been shown to &quot;increase&quot; lifespan. Whether reducing oxidative damage below normal levels is sufficient to extend lifespan remains an open and controversial question.

== Background ==
The free radical theory of aging was conceived by Denham Harman in the 1950s, when prevailing scientific opinion held that free radicals were too unstable to exist in biological systems. This was also before anyone invoked free radicals as a cause of degenerative diseases. Two sources inspired Harman: 1) the rate of living theory, which holds that lifespan is an inverse function of metabolic rate which in turn is proportional to oxygen consumption, and 2) Rebeca Gerschman&#x27;s observation that hyperbaric oxygen toxicity and radiation toxicity could be explained by the same underlying phenomenon: oxygen free radicals. Noting that radiation causes &quot;mutation, cancer and aging&quot;, Harman argued that oxygen free radicals produced during normal respiration would cause cumulative damage which would eventually lead to organismal loss of functionality, and ultimately death.

In later years, the free radical theory was expanded to include not only aging &quot;per se&quot;, but also age-related diseases. Free radical damage within cells has been linked to a range of disorders including cancer, arthritis, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and diabetes. There has been some evidence to suggest that free radicals and some reactive nitrogen species trigger and increase cell death mechanisms within the body such as apoptosis and in extreme cases necrosis.

In 1972, Harman modified his original theory. In its current form, this theory proposes that reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are produced in the mitochondria, causes damage to certain macromolecules including lipids, proteins and most importantly mitochondrial DNA. This damage then causes mutations which lead to an increase of ROS production and greatly enhance the accumulation of free radicals within cells. This mitochondrial theory has been more widely accepted that it could play a major role in contributing to the aging process.

Since Harman first proposed the free radical theory of aging, there have been continual modifications and extensions to his original theory.

==Processes==

Free radicals are atoms or molecules containing unpaired electrons. Electrons normally exist in pairs in specific orbitals in atoms or molecules. Free radicals, which contain only a single electron in any orbital, are usually unstable toward losing or picking up an extra electron, so that all electrons in the atom or molecule will be paired.

The unpaired electron does not imply charge; free radicals can be positively charged, negatively charged, or neutral.

Damage occurs when the free radical encounters another molecule and seeks to find another electron to pair its unpaired electron. The free radical often pulls an electron off a neighboring molecule, causing the affected molecule to become a free radical itself. The new free radical can then pull an electron off the next molecule, and a chemical chain reaction of radical production occurs. The free radicals produced in such reactions often terminate by removing an electron from a molecule which becomes changed or cannot function without it, especially in biology. Such an event causes damage to the molecule, and thus to the cell that contains it (since the molecule often becomes dysfunctional).

The chain reaction caused by free radicals can lead to cross-linking of atomic structures. In cases where the free radical-induced chain reaction involves base pair molecules in a strand of DNA, the DNA can become cross-linked.

Oxidative free radicals, such as the hydroxyl radical and the superoxide radical, can cause DNA damages, and such damages have been proposed to play a key role in the aging of crucial tissues. DNA damage can result in reduced gene expression, cell death and ultimately tissue dysfunction.

DNA cross-linking can in turn lead to various effects of aging, especially cancer. Other cross-linking can occur between fat and protein molecules, which leads to wrinkles. Free radicals can oxidize LDL, and this is a key event in the formation of plaque in arteries, leading to heart disease and stroke. These are examples of how the free-radical theory of aging has been used to neatly &quot;explain&quot; the origin of many chronic diseases.

Free radicals that are thought to be involved in the process of aging include superoxide and nitric oxide. Specifically, an increase in superoxide affects aging whereas a decrease in nitric oxide formation, or its bioavailability, does the same.

Antioxidants are helpful in reducing and preventing damage from free radical reactions because of their ability to donate electrons which neutralize the radical without forming another. Vitamin C, for example, can lose an electron to a free radical and remain stable itself by passing its unstable electron around the antioxidant molecule.

== Modifications of the theory ==
One of the main criticisms of the free radical theory of aging is directed at the suggestion that free radicals are responsible for the damage of biomolecules, thus being a major reason for cellular senescence and organismal aging. Several modifications have been proposed to integrate current research into the overall theory.

=== Mitochondria ===
The mitochondrial theory of aging was first proposed in 1978, and two years later, the mitochondrial free-radical theory of aging was introduced. The theory implicates the mitochondria as the chief target of radical damage, since there is a known chemical mechanism by which mitochondria can produce ROS, mitochondrial components such as mtDNA are not as well protected as nuclear DNA, and by studies comparing damage to nuclear and mtDNA that demonstrate higher levels of radical damage on the mitochondrial molecules. Electrons may escape from metabolic processes in the mitochondria like the Electron transport chain, and these electrons may in turn react with water to form ROS such as the superoxide radical, or via an indirect route the hydroxyl radical. These radicals then damage the mitochondria&#x27;s DNA and proteins, and these damage components in turn are more liable to produce ROS byproducts. Thus a positive feedback loop of oxidative stress is established that, over time, can lead to the deterioration of cells and later organs and the entire body.

This theory has been widely debated and it is still unclear how ROS induced mtDNA mutations develop. Conte et al. suggest iron-substituted zinc fingers may generate free radicals due to the zinc finger proximity to DNA and thus lead to DNA damage.

Afanas&#x27;ev suggests the superoxide dismutation activity of CuZnSOD demonstrates an important link between life span and free radicals. The link between CuZnSOD and life span was demonstrated by Perez et al. who indicated mice life span was affected by the deletion of the Sod1 gene which encodes CuZnSOD.

Contrary to the usually observed association between mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and a decline in longevity, Yee et al. recently observed increased longevity mediated by mtROS signaling in an apoptosis pathway. This serves to support the possibility that observed correlations between ROS damage and aging are not necessarily indicative of the causal involvement of ROS in the aging process but are more likely due to their modulating signal transduction pathways that are part of cellular responses to the aging process.

===Epigenetic oxidative redox shift===
Brewer proposed a theory which integrates the free radical theory of aging with the insulin signalling effects in aging. Brewer&#x27;s theory suggests &quot;sedentary behaviour associated with age triggers an oxidized redox shift and impaired mitochondrial function&quot;. This mitochondrial impairment leads to more sedentary behaviour and accelerated aging.

===Metabolic stability===
The metabolic stability theory of aging suggests it is the cells ability to maintain stable concentration of ROS which is the primary determinant of lifespan. This theory criticizes the free radical theory because it ignores that ROS are specific signalling molecules which are necessary for maintaining normal cell functions.

=== Mitohormesis ===
Oxidative stress may promote life expectancy of &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; by inducing a secondary response to initially increased levels of ROS. In mammals, the question of the net effect of reactive oxygen species on aging is even less clear. Recent epidemiological findings support the process of mitohormesis in humans, and even suggest that the intake of exogenous antioxidants may increase disease prevalence in humans (according to the theory, because they prevent the stimulation of the organism&#x27;s natural response to the oxidant compounds which not only neutralizes them but provides other benefits as well).

==Challenges==

===Birds===

Among birds, parrots live about five times longer than quail. ROS production in heart, skeletal muscle, liver and intact erythrocytes was found to be similar in parrots and quail and showed no correspondence with longevity difference. These findings were concluded to cast doubt on the robustness of the oxidative stress theory of aging.

<doc id="605506" wikidata="Q3098600" url="?curid=605506" title="Gary Owens">
<text>Gary Owens (born Gary Bernard Altman; May 10, 1934 – February 12, 2015) was an American disc jockey, voice actor, announcer and radio personality. His polished baritone speaking voice generally offered deadpan recitations of total nonsense, which he frequently demonstrated as the announcer on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. Owens was equally proficient in straight or silly assignments and was frequently heard on television and radio as well as in commercials.

He was best known, aside from being the announcer on &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, for providing the voices of the titular superhero on &quot;Space Ghost&quot; and of Blue Falcon in &quot;Dynomutt, Dog Wonder&quot;. He also played himself in a cameo appearance on &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; in 1998. Owens&#x27; first cartoon-voice acting was performing the voice of Roger Ramjet on the &quot;Roger Ramjet&quot; cartoons. He later served as announcer of Antenna TV.

==Early life==
Owens was born in Mitchell, South Dakota, the son of Venetta Clark Altman, an educator and county auditor, and Bernard Joseph Altman, a county treasurer and sheriff.

==Career==

===1950s===
Owens started his radio career in 1952 as a news reporter at KORN in Mitchell, South Dakota, and two years later was promoted to news director. In 1956, he left KORN for a newscaster job at KMA, Shenandoah, Iowa, before moving on to a disc jockey job at KOIL, Omaha, Nebraska. He also worked in Dallas, New Orleans, St. Louis, and at KIMN in Denver before relocating to California in 1959, working at KROY in Sacramento and KEWB in Oakland before finally settling in Los Angeles.

===1960s===
Owens moved to KEWB&#x27;s sister station 980 KFWB in Los Angeles in 1961. From there, he joined the staff of 710 KMPC in 1962, where he remained for the next two decades, replacing previous afternoon host Johnny Grant, working the 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. shift Monday through Friday. A gifted punster, Owens became known for his surrealistic humor. Among his trademarks were daily appearances by &quot;The Story Lady&quot; (played by Joan Gerber); the Rumor of the Day; myriad varieties of &quot;The Nurney Song&quot;; and the introduction of the nonsense word &quot;insegrevious&quot;, which was briefly included in the Funk &amp; Wagnalls Dictionary.

His regular on-air radio terms included &quot;krenellemuffin&quot;, as in &quot;We&#x27;ll be back in just a krenellemuffin.&quot; Gary always credited his radio engineer at the end of his broadcast: &quot;I&#x27;d like to thank my engineer, Wayne Doo, for creebling at the turntables&quot; (referring to KMPC engineer Wayne DuBois). He also created the previously non-existent colors &quot;veister&quot; and &quot;krelb&quot;.

In the early 1960s, like punster-TV star comic colleagues Ernie Kovacs, Steve Allen, and Jonathan Winters, Owens created a few comic characters of his own, such as the gruff old man Earl C. Festoon and his wife Phoebe Festoon, the stuffy old businessman Endocrine J. Sternwallow, and the goofy good ol&#x27; boy, Merle Clyde Gumpf. Another character was crotchety old cantankerous Mergenthaler Waisleywillow.

Owens also did amusing radio promotions, such as sending in for &quot;Yours&quot;, which turned out to be a postcard from him at the radio station which simply said &quot;Yours&quot; on it; autographed pictures of the Harbor Freeway in Los Angeles; and his famous &quot;Moo Cow Report&quot;, in which Gary and his character Earl C. Festoon would describe where cows were moving inbound on the crowded freeways of Los Angeles.

During this time Owens was also known as &quot;Superbeard&quot;, because like his contemporary radio icon Wolfman Jack, he sported a goatee-beard, Hawaiian shirts, baggy Bermuda shorts, and his &quot;1941 wide necktie with a hula girl on it&quot;. Often during these comedy sketches on the air, he would have the assistance of other radio comics, most notably Bob Arbogast (known as &quot;Arbo&quot; to his fans), Stan Ross (of &quot;Drowning in the Surf&quot; fame in 1963), and Jim &quot;Weather Eyes&quot; Hawthorne.

Owens appeared on eight episodes of the 1966-67 television series &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;.

Owens also did his famous &quot;Good Evening Kiss&quot; on KMPC when he was on from 9 p.m. to midnight, by saying, &quot;Now I&#x27;ll just snuggle up to a nice warm microphone, and &quot;embracemoi&quot;&quot;, making a big wet kiss sound effect followed by the sound effect of a gong striking. In 1966, Owens collaborated with Bob Arbogast, June Foray, Daws Butler, Paul Frees, and others on a comedy spoof record album titled &quot;Sunday Morning With the Funnies&quot; with the Jimmy Haskell Orchestra on Reprise Records.

During this period, Owens became more widely known as the voice of the eponymous television cartoon characters in &quot;Roger Ramjet&quot; and &quot;Space Ghost&quot;; the excitable narrator/announcer from &quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot;; and perhaps most well-known, as the hand-on-the-ear announcer in the booth on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, all the while continuing his show on KMPC. He also hosted its daily game show spin-off, &quot;Letters to Laugh-In&quot;, during its brief run in 1969.

Capitalizing on Owens&#x27; &quot;Laugh-In&quot; fame, Mel Blanc Audiomedia, an audio production company based in Beverly Hills, developed and marketed &quot;The Gary Owens Special Report&quot;, a 260-episode package of syndicated radio comedy shows.

Owens appeared in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; pilots in a sketch called &quot;The Man from Alphabet&quot; as the title character, a bumbling spy in a trench coat who, with the help of a young paperboy called H.B., tried to catch the villainous Digby Dropout and his henchman Dunce using clues from H.B.&#x27;s &quot;Alphabet Book&quot;. Initially, the Man was also to have had a chief, &quot;Teacher&quot;. The segments were created by &quot;Sesame Street&quot; executive producer David Connell and referenced such tongue-in-cheek spy series as &quot;Get Smart&quot; and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;. Despite the advance publicity, and Connell&#x27;s investment in the series, &quot;The Man from Alphabet&quot; proved to be a failure with test audiences. The Man from Alphabet&#x27;s constant bungling and problem-solving attempts confused kids and the lessons never came across. H.B.&#x27;s role as the true problem-solver was not clearly understood, a fact exacerbated by the child actor&#x27;s stilted delivery and poor diction. As assessed by Edward L. Palmer, &quot;The amount of truly effective educational content, relative to our goals, is virtual nil.&quot; After reviewing the test results, producer Connell advised that the segments be shelved, referring to them as &quot;Connell&#x27;s Folly&quot;. The segments never aired on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

Owens was a scriptwriter for Jay Ward Productions, appeared in many series for Walt Disney, and did over 30,000 commercials. He was also a guest star on &quot;The Munsters&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, and &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;.

During the late 1960s, when the films of 1930s comedians such as the Marx Brothers, W. C. Fields, and Mae West were finding a new audience, Owens narrated phonograph records containing sound clips from the films.

Owens appeared as the racing correspondent in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Love Bug&quot; (1968).

===1970s===
In 1972, he released the comedy LP &quot;Put Your Head On My Finger&quot; for the MGM-Pride label.

In 1973, Owens wrote &quot;The (What to Do While You&#x27;re Holding the) Phone Book&quot; (), a comedic look at the history of the telephone, and appeared in the first season of &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, in the episode titled &quot;Twenty Million Alibis&quot;, playing the role of Gary Michaels.

On the live album &quot;Uptown Rulers&quot; by the funk band The Meters, Owens can be heard on the first track introducing the band. The live recording took place on March 24, 1975, at Paul and Linda McCartney&#x27;s release party for the &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; album held aboard the .

Owens did the humorous news blurbs that are interspersed throughout the 1975 film &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot;. In 1976–77, he hosted the first season of the nighttime version of &quot;The Gong Show&quot;; he was replaced by the show&#x27;s creator, Chuck Barris. In that same year, Owens became the voice of a new cartoon character, the Blue Falcon, a character who fought crime in fictional Big City with the &quot;help&quot; of his clumsy sidekick, Dynomutt, also known as &quot;Dynomutt, Dog Wonder&quot;. The series was a parody of Batman, specifically the live-action version starring Adam West. It was not uncommon to see the Blue Falcon use various &quot;falcon gadgets&quot;, much like Batman used various &quot;Bat-Equipment&quot; items. The falcon belt was used in a similar fashion to Batman&#x27;s utility belt with an endless supply of weapons and other devices. Owens would provide the voice of the Blue Falcon from 1976 through 1977 in 20 half-hour episodes. The 1977 episodes were broken into two parts that ran 11 minutes each — 16 episodes in 1976 and four in 1977. Also, he narrated &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Space Race&quot; in 1978 and announced for Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World, starting in 1979.

===1980s===
Owens received a Hollywood Walk of Fame Star in 1980, between those of Walt Disney and Betty White. On August 30, 1983, Owens emceed the unveiling ceremony for the Hollywood Walk of Fame Star for The Three Stooges. Owens, a long-time friend of the Stooges, had been a major driving force in helping the Stooges get the Star. The ceremony was featured on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;.

In the 1980s, he announced on jazz radio station KKJZ (then KKGO-FM) in Long Beach, California.

On the weekend of September 12–13, 1981, Owens substituted for his old KEWB station partner Casey Kasem on &quot;American Top 40&quot;. This was his only appearance on radio&#x27;s first nationally syndicated countdown show. In that same year, Watermark Inc. chose Owens to replace Murray &quot;The K&quot; Kaufman as permanent host of &quot;Soundtrack Of The Sixties&quot;, an oldies retrospective show that ran in syndication through 1984. Immediately afterward, he hosted Creative Radio&#x27;s &quot;Gary Owens&#x27; Supertracks&quot;, which was an oldies retrospective show similar to &quot;Soundtrack Of The Sixties&quot;, except it presented the fifties, sixties, and seventies.

He was the narrator of Walt Disney World&#x27;s EPCOT Center pavilion, World of Motion, which operated between 1982 and 1996. His television special was &quot;The Roots of Goofy&quot;, which aired from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s.
Owens moved from KMPC to another Los Angeles station, 1150 KPRZ, in 1982, hosting mornings at the &quot;Music of Your Life&quot; adult standards station. Owens in the morning and Dick Whittinghill in afternoon drive was an inversion of Owens&#x27; KMPC years.

When Roger Barkley surprisingly walked out of the long-running &quot;Lohman and Barkley Show&quot; on KFI in Los Angeles, Owens briefly teamed with Al Lohman for the successful morning commute show. Jeff Gehringer was brought on as producer. The program ended after the station changed its format to all-talk.

Owens had a bit part as an emcee for &quot;Pimp of the Year&quot;, a dream scene in the 1988 comedy &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Git You Sucka&quot;.

Owens also co-starred in a number of documentaries about dinosaurs in the 1980s alongside Chicago&#x27;s Eric Boardman. These documentaries were distributed by the Midwich Entertainment group for the Disney Channel before it went from being a premium pay channel on cable to a standard channel.

Owens guest starred on one episode of &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot;

From 1987 to 1992, Owens was the voice of Lt. Dirk Niblick of the Math Brigade, the protagonist of an animated series which was part of PBS&#x27;s &quot;Square One TV&quot;.

Owens was the voice narrator on the ABC Saturday morning animated series &quot;Mighty Orbots&quot; in 1984.

In 1989 Owens appeared in &quot;Night Court&quot;, season 7 episode 7, entitled &quot;Auntie Maim&quot;. Owens played DJ Bobby Bumgartner.

===1990s===
In the late 1990s, Owens hosted the morning show on the Music of Your Life radio network, where he later had the evening shift and hosted a weekend afternoon show until 2006. He also announced pre-recorded station IDs for Parksville, British Columbia radio station CHPQ-FM (The Lounge), and for humorist Gary Burbank&#x27;s long-running afternoon show on WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio (Burbank took his stage name from Owens). Owens was also the announcer for &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; from 1995 to 1997, the last three years of Bob Saget&#x27;s hosting tenure, replacing Ernie Anderson.

The cartoon &quot;SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron&quot; featured Owens as the voice of Commander Ulysses Feral, a police chief constantly butting heads with the two main protagonists.

Owens guest starred on &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; as the voice of Powdered Toast Man.

He lent his voice as the narrator for the 1992 voiced CD-ROM version of Sierra On-Line&#x27;s &quot;Space Quest IV&quot;. He again assumed the role in the series&#x27; final installment, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Space Quest 6&quot;.

From 1994 to 1995, Owens narrated the opening and interstitial bumpers of &quot;Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad&quot;.

In 1998, he appeared on &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; (episode: &quot;Good Will Haunting&quot;; Season 3, Episode 6) as &quot;Guy Who Thinks He&#x27;s Gary Owens&quot;.

===Last years===
In 2004, Owens co-wrote a book titled &quot;How to Make a Million Dollars With Your Voice (Or Lose Your Tonsils Trying)&quot;. In his last years, Owens was the promotional announcing voice for Antenna TV, an over-the-air digital network dedicated to classic shows of the past, like &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, &quot;The Monkees&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot; and &quot;Gidget&quot;.

==Personal life==
Owens married Arleta Markell on June 26, 1956; they remained married for nearly sixty years until his death in February 2015. Together they had two sons, Scott and Chris.

==Death==
Owens died on February 12, 2015, at age 80, from complications due to Type 1 diabetes, a condition with which he was first diagnosed at the age of eight.

==Trademarks==
When appearing &quot;in character&quot; on camera as &quot;Gary Owens, the announcer&quot;, Owens held his right hand up to his right ear while speaking into a gimbaled boom microphone. This was done in imitation of the announcers in the early days of radio, who had to rely upon the acoustic feedback of their cupped hand to hear how they sounded to the audience. Owens used this as a running gag and gave various outlandish reasons for this pose: On his KMPC radio show in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he claimed that this was because a piece of shrapnel took off his ear during the war; sometimes it would come loose and he had to hold it on; at other times he said that he was given a wooden ear, and was keeping the termites warm. This gag was later parodied by Les Lye on the Canadian children&#x27;s sketch-comedy show &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot;.

Owens coined the phrase &quot;Beautiful downtown Burbank&quot;, which was later used on &quot;Laugh-In&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

His trademark self-introduction was &quot;This is Gary Owens, friend of those who want no friends, going places and losing things&quot;, or occasionally, &quot;Hello, and also hi; but not necessarily in that order&quot;, as a shorter version.

==&quot;Blast from the Past&quot;==
In 2001, TV Land released two computer games titled &quot;Blast from the Past&quot;, hosted by Owens and featuring other TV celebrities including Florence Henderson, Ed Asner, Davy Jones, Bob Denver, Don Adams, Barbara Eden, Todd Bridges, Alan Young, and Marion Ross, among others. The games spoofed a game show and the prize for winners was an interview with the chosen celebrity the contestant selected at the start of the game. (Players can choose Owens as a celebrity if they wish).

<text>A flower car is a type of vehicle used in the funeral industry of the United States, frequently under the Cadillac brand. It is used to carry flowers for the burial service, or sometimes to carry the coffin under a bed of flowers. Built on the same commercial chassis as a hearse, the flower car has half-height rear bodywork on the rear similar to a pickup truck bed. The bed contains a liner to hold the flowers, normally built of stainless steel to resist rust. Some flower cars have a raised, flat tonneau cover across the bed at the top, upon which the flowers sit; the center portion sometimes is designed to raise and lower, hydraulically or by hand. If the flower car is designed to carry a casket, it will be stored under the tonneau cover in the space beneath, behind the opening rear gate.

In the early years of the automobile, open-topped luxury cars were used for this purpose, but as enclosed vehicles became the norm, specially built vehicles began to be used for this purpose from approximately the 1930s onward. Not every funeral provider owned a flower car; they were a luxury item offered as an extra-cost option for extravagant funerals. The quantities built were low; it is estimated that fewer than a dozen were built each year by each coachbuilder in the funeral market.

Flower cars are still manufactured, but in ever decreasing numbers. Old flower cars are considered collectible due to their rarity, especially by collectors of hearses and other &quot;professional cars&quot;.
