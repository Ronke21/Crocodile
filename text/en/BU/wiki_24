<text>is shoot &#x27;em up arcade video game designed by Yoshiki Okamoto and released by Konami in 1983. &quot;Gyruss&quot; was initially licensed to Centuri in the United States for dedicated machines, before Konami released their own self-distributed conversion kits for the game. Parker Brothers released contemporary ports for home systems. An enhanced version for the Family Computer Disk System was released in 1988, which was released to the North American Nintendo Entertainment System in early 1989.

The gameplay is similar to that of &quot;Galaga&quot; in a tube shooter format, with the player&#x27;s ship facing into the screen and able to move around the perimeter of an implicit circle. Stars come into view at the centre of the screen and fly outward, giving the impression of the player&#x27;s ship moving through space.

&quot;Gyruss&quot; is the second and last game Yoshiki Okamoto designed for Konami, after &quot;Time Pilot&quot;. Due to pay disputes, he was fired after the release of this game, and he soon joined Capcom, where he wrote &quot;1942&quot; and produced &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;.

==Gameplay==

The graphics are displayed using one-point perspective, with the vanishing point in the center of the screen. The player&#x27;s ship is restricted to a circumference around the edge of the screen and may move in either direction along this path. All shots from the player converge at the vanishing point.

The majority of enemies are spaceships, which must be destroyed to complete a level. They appear either from the centre of the screen or from one of the edges, and move in swirling patterns. They can shoot the player&#x27;s ship or destroy it by contact. They hover near the centre of the screen after completing their deployment pattern, and occasionally fly outwards and shoot at the player. If not destroyed by the player, the enemy ships gradually fly away one by one.

There are also several other types of enemies: satellites, asteroids, and laser beam generators. These appear intermittently and soon disappear of their own accord if not destroyed by the player.

Satellites materialise in a group of three just in front of the player after the ordinary enemy ships have finished deployment. They gyrate in small circles and shoot at the player. If the player has the basic weapon when the satellites appear the middle one will be a sun-like object. If destroyed, the player&#x27;s ship gets a better weapon. If the better weapon has already been gained then all satellites are identical.

Asteroids fly straight outwards from the centre of the screen at regular intervals. They cannot be destroyed, but a small points bonus is given for shooting at them.

Laser beam generators occasionally fly straight outwards from the centre of the screen. They consist of two generator segments with a laser beam between them; destroying either generator deactivates the beam. The player&#x27;s ship is destroyed by contact with either the generators or the beam.

The player begins the game &quot;2 WARPS TO NEPTUNE&quot;. After completing each level, the player is one warp closer to a planet. Each time a planet is reached, the player&#x27;s ship is seen flying towards it and then a short bonus round is played, where the player can shoot enemy ships for bonus points without worrying about being destroyed by them. Each enemy destroyed in the bonus stage scores 100 or 10,000 for all 40. After reaching Neptune, the player is then three warps from Uranus, and progresses through Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and finally Earth, taking three warps to reach each planet, then repeats thereafter. At stage 1 and every 10th stage thereafter, the enemies do not fire on the player when entering the screen.

After completing Earth&#x27;s bonus stage, the player must travel through the fast &quot;3 WARPS TO NEPTUNE&quot; level before they can return to the start of the game.

Extra lives will be given at certain point thresholds, varying from one machine to another, but when the player&#x27;s score is higher than 999,990 points, they can no longer obtain score-based extra lives.

==Music==
The game&#x27;s background music is an electronic, uptempo arrangement of J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565&quot;; this particular track is similar to &quot;Toccata&quot;, a rock arrangement by the UK-based instrumentalist group Sky. &quot;Gyruss&quot; uses stereo sound, which according to the bonus material for &quot;Konami Arcade Classics&quot;, was achieved by utilizing discrete audio circuits.

The audio system consists of five 3-voice General Instrument AY-3-8910A sound chips.

==Ports==
Parker Brothers released contemporary ports for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit computers, ColecoVision, and Commodore 64. A version for the ZX Spectrum was coded but never released.

&quot;Gyruss&quot; was remade for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America, released by Konami&#x27;s subsidiary Ultra Games. These versions include several major revisions:

# The player can use a super phaser attack in addition to the normal guns, which cost energy.
# There are additional enemies, including boss fights when the player reaches each planet.
# Bonus stages after each planet&#x27;s boss is defeated, for a chance to gain additional powerups.
# There is a definite ending to the game. In the NES version, it&#x27;s a brief text about the Universe being at peace. In the FDS version, there is a full ending sequence with credits.
# In addition to the satellites providing the usual double guns and bonus points, they can also provide extra phasers, a smart bomb, and even an extra life.
# Instead of the arcade&#x27;s 24 stages, there are 39, including Venus, Mercury, and the Sun.
# The player can enter the Konami code at the title screen for extra lives, but it must be entered in reverse (A-B-A-B-right-left-right-left-down-down-up-up).

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Gyruss&quot; on their July 1, 1983 issue as being the seventh most-successful table arcade unit of the month. &quot;Computer Games&quot; magazine gave the ColecoVision and home computer conversions an A− rating, calling it a &quot;very good adaptation of the &quot;Galaga&quot;-in-the-round arcade game&quot;.

==Legacy==
The Famicom version of the game is included in the Majesco Entertainment TV Game &quot;Konami Collector&#x27;s Series: Arcade Advanced&quot; and was released for Japanese mobile phones in 2004.

&quot;Gyruss&quot; is included in the compilation &quot;Konami 80&#x27;s Arcade Gallery&quot;, released for both the arcade and PlayStation (known as &quot;Konami 80&#x27;s AC Special&quot; in western arcades and &quot;Konami Arcade Classics&quot; in the North American PlayStation version). It is also part of &quot;Konami Collector&#x27;s Series: Arcade Advanced&quot; for the Game Boy Advance.

The &quot;Konami Live!&quot; Plug and Play PC controller includes an emulated on;ine &quot;Gyruss&quot;, as well as five other Konami titles.

&quot;Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 2&quot; contains a remix of the &quot;Gyruss&quot; music as a playable song.

===Clones===
A bootleg arcade version exists with the name &quot;Venus&quot;.

&quot;Gyruss&quot; was cloned as a mini-game in the games &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; (named &quot;They Crawled from Uranus&quot;) and &quot;&quot;.

===Record===
The film &quot;Cannon Arm And the Arcade Quest&quot; directed by Mads Hedegaard follows the current world record holder Kim &quot;Kanonarm&quot; Köbke and friends in Kim&#x27;s attempt to set a new world record. Kim &quot;Kanonarm&quot; Köbke sets the record of 70,736,950 during a game of 62 hours and 23 minutes in the summer of 2019.

<doc id="592282" wikidata="Q1759163" url="?curid=592282" title="Star One (band)">
<text>Star One (also referred to as Arjen Anthony Lucassen&#x27;s Star One) is a Dutch progressive metal supergroup/side-project of Arjen Anthony Lucassen of Ayreon fame.

The band has released three albums to date: their first in 2002, their second in 2010, and most recently a third in 2022, plus a live album in 2003, and features four different singers: Russell Allen (Symphony X), Damian Wilson (Threshold, Headspace, Arena), Dan Swanö (Edge of Sanity, Nightingale), and Floor Jansen (After Forever, ReVamp, Nightwish).

Unlike Ayreon, the Star One albums do not follow one storyline; instead, each song is a different story with a sci-fi concept, most of the tracks based on existing movies and series. The band takes its name from the second season finale of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;. The band includes four singers alternating in all the songs, not including Lucassen, who sings occasionally, plays all guitars and keyboards and writes and composes all the songs. The third studio album deviates from this, having a different guest singer on each track.

== History ==
=== Origins and first album (2002–2003) ===
Star One was born out of the remnants of an abandoned collaboration between Lucassen and Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson. 
Dickinson proposed the idea and the two exchanged ideas and put together four songs, Lucassen writing the music and Dickinson writing the lyrics.
The project was abandoned however after Lucassen mentioned the project on the internet and Dickinson&#x27;s manager called off negotiations. 
Instead of completely abandoning the material that had already been produced, Lucassen decided to put his own lyrics to the music and created Star One.

When asked on the &quot;Ask Arjen Anything&quot; channel of communication if there would be another Star One album, Lucassen simply stated &quot;Probably&quot;. However, he later declared:

&quot;&quot;Space Metal&quot; was really magic. I am afraid that I will fail to capture the same atmosphere and actually ruin it! I am actually against sequels; you cannot repeat the same atmosphere and feeling like you had with the first album.&quot;

=== Second album (2009–2010) ===
In an interview conducted by Ragnarok Radio in October 2009 Arjen stated Star One is &quot;definitely not dead.&quot;

In October 2009 in another interview, with Lebmetal.com, Arjen said he was working on what might become another Star One album: &quot;In the meantime I will be working on a new, heavier album. Possible a new Star One album, but then again things never work out the way I plan them&quot;, and in a November 2009 interview with Lagrossradio.com, Arjen stated that he was definitely working on a new Star One album and that he had already written and recorded a song.

In March 2010, a &quot;demo listening party&quot; was held where several members of the arjenlucassen.com messageboard were allowed to listen to the first (only instrumental) demos for the new Star One album.
In August of the same year, Arjen revealed the title of this second album, &quot;Victims of the Modern Age&quot;, and announced that it was ready. The album was released in October 2010.

In a Q&amp;A in August 2018, Lucassen stated that returning to Star One was &quot;always an option, it&#x27;s the same as with all my other projects. [...] For Star One, I have to be in a certain mood, because it&#x27;s based on guitar riffs.&quot; He confirmed that his next project would not be a Star One album, as his latest work, the Ayreon album &quot;The Source&quot;, was already heavy-oriented, and stated that if a new Star One album came to be, it would probably be with different singers.

=== Third album (2020–present) ===
After releasing the Ayreon album &quot;Transitus&quot; in September 2020, Lucassen stated in several comments in social media that he was working on a third Star One album. On 9 February 2021 he published a video announcement, confirming this, and said that music is basically ready at this point and he&#x27;s working on lyrics at the moment. He also promised a &quot;big change&quot;: instead of having four singers for the whole album, each track will have its own separate singer. In October 2021, it was announced that the name of album would be &quot;Revel in Time&quot; along with the release date. The album was released on 18 February 2022.

== Music ==
The music of Star One is heavier than that of Lucassen&#x27;s progressive rock/metal opera project Ayreon, drawing influences from 1970s space rock and blending them with modern progressive metal. Lucassen explained that the songwriting was different in that Star One songs are built on guitar riffs whereas Ayreon songs stem primarily off chord arrangements. However, similarities still exist mainly in the song arrangements, the multi-layered vocals, and the use of synthesizers and Hammond organs as part of the main instrumentation.

<doc id="592285" wikidata="Q155500" url="?curid=592285" title="5535 Annefrank">
<text>5535 Annefrank ( ), provisional designation , is a stony Florian asteroid and suspected contact binary from the inner asteroid belt, approximately 4.5 kilometers in diameter. It was used as a target to practice the flyby technique that the Stardust space probe would later use on the comet Wild 2.

The asteroid was discovered 23 March 1942, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. It was named after Anne Frank, a victim of the Holocaust.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Annefrank&quot; is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest collisional populations of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.1–2.4 AU once every 3 years and 3 months (1,202 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic.

The body&#x27;s observation arc begins at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1978, with its identification as , 36 years after its official discovery observation at Heidelberg.

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;Annefrank&quot; has been characterized as a common S-type asteroid.

=== Diameter, albedo and shape ===

On 2 November 2002, the Stardust space probe flew past &quot;Annefrank&quot; at a distance of 3079 km. Its images show the asteroid to be 6.6 × 5.0 × 3.4 km, twice as big as previously thought, and its main body shaped like a triangular prism with several visible impact craters. From the photographs, the albedo of &quot;Annefrank&quot; was computed to be between 0.18 and 0.24. Preliminary analysis of the Stardust imagery suggests that &quot;Annefrank&quot; may be a contact binary, although other possible explanations exist for its observed shape.

=== Rotation and poles ===

In October 2006, ground-based photometric observations were used in an attempt to measure &quot;Annefrank&quot;″s rotational period. Analysis of the ambiguous lightcurve gave a period of hours and a brightness variation of 0.25 magnitude with two alternative period solutions of 12 and 22.8 hours, respectively ().

In January 2014, photometric observations at the Palomar Transient Factory gave a rotation period of and hours with an amplitude of 0.17 and 0.20 magnitude, respectively ().

The lightcurve data suggests that &quot;Annefrank&quot; is not Lambertian, meaning that surface features, such as shadows from boulders and craters, play a role in the object&#x27;s perceived brightness and not just the asteroid&#x27;s relative size when seen from that orientation.

The body&#x27;s shortest axis is approximately aligned perpendicular to its orbital plane.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after Anne Frank, the German-Dutch-Jewish diarist who died in a Nazi concentration camp during the Second World War. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 14 May 1995 ().

<text>Charles Victor Cherbuliez (; 19 July 1829 – 1 or 2 July 1899) was a Swiss, and then (1879) French novelist and author. He was born at Geneva, Switzerland and died at Combs-la-Ville. He was the eleventh member elected to occupy seat 3 of the Académie Française in 1881.

==Biography==
Cherbuliez was born at Geneva, where his father, André Cherbuliez (1795–1874), was a classical professor at the Université de Genève. He was descended from a family of Protestant refugees, and many years later Victor Cherbuliez resumed his French nationality, taking advantage of an act passed in the early days of the Revolution. Geneva was the scene of his early education; thence he proceeded to Paris, and afterwards to the universities of Bonn and Berlin.

Cherbuliez returned to his native town and engaged in the profession of teaching. After his resumption of French citizenship he was elected a member of the Académie Française (1881), and having received the Legion of Honour in 1870, he was promoted to be officer of the order in 1892.

==Work==
Cherbuliez was a voluminous and successful writer of fiction. His first book, originally published in 1860, reappeared in 1864 under the title of &quot;Un Cheval de Phidias&quot;: it is a romantic study of art in the golden age of Athens. He went on to produce a series of novels.

Most of these novels first appeared in the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;, such as &quot;Le Comte Kostia&quot; (1863). Cherbuliez also contributed a number of political and learned articles to the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;, usually printed with the pseudonym G Valbert. Many of these have been published in collected form under the titles &quot;L&#x27;Allemagne politique&quot; (1870), &quot;L&#x27;Espagne politique&quot; (1874), &quot;Profils étrangers&quot; (1889), &quot;L&#x27;Art et la nature&quot; (1892), etc. The volume &quot;Etudes de littérature et d&#x27;art&quot; (1873) includes articles for the most part reprinted from &quot;Le Temps&quot;.

<doc id="592295" wikidata="Q208494" url="?curid=592295" title="Industrial metal">
<text>Industrial metal is the fusion of heavy metal and industrial music, typically employing repeating metal guitar riffs, sampling, synthesizer or sequencer lines, and distorted vocals. Prominent industrial metal acts include Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, Fear Factory, Rammstein, KMFDM, and Godflesh.

Industrial metal developed in the late 1980s, as industrial and metal began to fuse into a common genre. Industrial metal did well in the early 1990s, particularly in North America, with the success of groups such as Nine Inch Nails, but its popularity began to fade in the latter half of the 1990s.

==History==

===Early innovators===
Though electric guitars had been used by industrial artists since the early days of the genre, archetypal industrial groups such as Throbbing Gristle displayed a strong anti-rock stance. British post-punk band Killing Joke pioneered the crossing over between styles and was an influence on major acts associated with industrial metal such as Ministry, Godflesh, and Nine Inch Nails. Another pioneer industrial rock group, Big Black, also impacted some later groups.

By the late 1980s industrial and heavy metal began to fuse into a common genre, with Godflesh&#x27;s self-titled EP and Ministry&#x27;s &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot; at the forefront. Godflesh was founded by former Napalm Death guitarist Justin Broadrick. Drawing from a wide array of influences—power electronics forefathers Whitehouse, noise rock band Swans, ambient music creator Brian Eno and fellow Birmingham hard rockers Black Sabbath—the Godflesh sound was once described as &quot;&quot;Pornography&quot;-era The Cure on Quaaludes&quot;. Though not a top seller, Godflesh nonetheless became an influential act, their name mentioned by Korn, Metallica, Danzig, Faith No More, and Fear Factory.

Ministry emerged from the scene surrounding Wax Trax! Records, a Chicago indie label dedicated to industrial music. Ministry&#x27;s initial foray into guitar rock happened during a recording session of &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot; on Southern Studios, in London. The band&#x27;s frontman, the Cuban-born Al Jourgensen, explained this transition:

Jourgensen seemed particularly fond of thrash metal. After the release of &quot;Land&quot;, he recruited guitarist Mike Scaccia from Texas thrashers Rigor Mortis. On one occasion, Jourgensen told the press that Sepultura was his favorite band. He also expressed the desire to produce a Metallica album. Jourgensen&#x27;s interest in dance-oriented electronic music did not entirely fade, however; he also formed the side-project Revolting Cocks, a more electronic body music-inflected collaboration with Richard23 of Front 242.

German band KMFDM was another seminal industrial metal group. Although not a metal fan, KMFDM leader Sascha Konietzko&#x27;s &quot;infatuation with ripping off metal licks&quot; stemmed from his experiments with E-mu&#x27;s Emax sampler in late 1986. He told &quot;Guitar World&quot; that,
A Swiss trio, The Young Gods, brushed with the style on their second album, &quot;L&#x27;Eau Rouge&quot; (1989). Prior to its release, singer Franz Treichler declared:

Canadian thrash metal band Malhavoc became one of the earlier acts of the genre when they began to mix extreme metal with industrial music in the late 1980s.

Pigface, formed by Martin Atkins and including Ministry drummer Bill Rieflin, emerged as an industrial metal collective of sorts, participating with many figures from the noise rock and industrial worlds. Nine Inch Nails, the &quot;one-man-band&quot; formed by Trent Reznor, brought the genre to mainstream audiences with albums such as the Grammy-winning &quot;Broken&quot; and the best-selling &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, accompanied by their groundbreaking performance at Woodstock &#x27;94. The rivethead subculture also developed at this time, along with the so-called &quot;coldwave&quot; subgenre, which encompassed Chemlab, 16 Volt, and Acumen Nation. Some electro-industrial groups adopted industrial metal techniques in this period, including Skinny Puppy (on their &quot;Rabies&quot;, co-produced by Jourgensen), and Front Line Assembly.

British band Pitchshifter, formed in 1989 by brothers Jon and Mark Clayden, also started as an industrial metal band. The band later included elements of drum and bass. Frontman JS mentions:
===Industrial thrash and death metal===

Industrial metal&#x27;s popularity led a number of successful thrash metal groups, including Megadeth, Sepultura, and Anthrax, to request remixes by &quot;industrial&quot; artists. Some musicians emerging from the death metal scene, such as Fear Factory, Nailbomb, Autokrator and Meathook Seed, also began to experiment with industrial. Fear Factory, from Los Angeles, were initially influenced by the Earache roster (namely Godflesh, Napalm Death and Bolt Thrower). The German band Oomph! after their second album &quot;Sperm&quot; started to play industrial metal combined with elements of death metal and groove metal until the album &quot;Plastik&quot;. Sepultura singer Max Cavalera&#x27;s Nailbomb, a collaboration with Alex Newport, also practiced a combination of extreme metal and industrial production techniques. A lesser-known example of industrial death metal is Meathook Seed, made up of members of Napalm Death and the Florida death metal group Obituary. An industrial music fan, Obituary guitarist Trevor Peres suggested drum machines for &quot;The End Complete&quot;, Obituary&#x27;s most successful album. The other band members&#x27; refusal led him to form Meathook Seed.

===Industrial black metal===

In the early years of the 21st century, groups from the black metal scene began to incorporate elements of industrial music. Mysticum, formed in 1991, was the first of these groups. DHG (Dødheimsgard), Thorns from Norway and Blut Aus Nord, N.K.V.D. and Blacklodge from France, have been acclaimed for their incorporation of industrial elements. Other industrial black metal musicians include Aborym, and ...And Oceans. In addition, The Kovenant, Mortiis and Ulver emerged from the Norwegian black metal scene, but later chose to experiment with industrial music.

=== Progressive industrial metal ===
Several artists with their roots in progressive music, though not often associated with industrial metal scene, also incorporated industrial textures into their music. Later-era King Crimson, whose 2000s albums were referred as &quot;industrial art metal&quot;, and OSI can be named as examples of progressive industrial metal. Several acts associated with extreme metal subgenres also mix progressive and avant-garde metal with industrial, those include the Hungarian experimental metal act Thy Catafalque, Blut aus Nord and Norwegian band Shining with their critically acclaimed &quot;Blackjazz&quot; album, which blended progressive rock, black metal, free jazz and industrial. Canadian artist Devin Townsend, the founder of industrial thrash metal band Strapping Young Lad, later fused industrial with progressive metal during his prolific solo career. Danish band The Interbeing have also fused industrial with progressive metal.

=== Coldwave ===

Coldwave is a subgenre of industrial metal originating in the 1990s. It has its roots in acts like Nine Inch Nails and Ministry. The style focuses on heavier, punk-based guitars, sampled hard rock-like guitars, synthesizer accompaniment, and acid house elements. Lyrical content is typically cyberpunk-oriented with pop music sensibilities, although it can vary.

Chemlab&#x27;s 1993 album Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar is often considered the album that defined the coldwave style.

Artists like the aforementioned Chemlab, 16 Volt and Acumen Nation exemplified this genre.

The coldwave style began to wane rapidly when industrial music in general started to lose popularity in the latter half of the 1990s-early 2000&#x27;s. Many artists within the genre moved on to different styles that included; Hard rock, heavy metal, nu metal, cyber metal, synth-metal, synth-rock, and synth-pop among other genres.

Coldwave today is a small, niche scene within industrial music. Very few bands today describe themselves or are described as coldwave. Bands like Cyanotic and Medicant Downline are perhaps the exception.

Despite sharing the same name as the French genre, it is otherwise unrelated.

===Cyber metal===

Cyber metal is a subgenre of industrial metal which incorporates numerous elements found predominantly in EBM and Aggrotech, including the use of more melodic and less repetitive riffs, in opposition to mostly metallic and mechanical sound of industrial music, first coined by Fear Factory in the mid-90s. The Kovenant was the first band to develop cyber metal with some of its more well-known aspects: harsh vocals, extreme guitar melodies, and symphonic keyboards. A wave of other bands described as cyber metal would follow, including Deathstars, Mnemic, Sybreed, Turmion Kätilöt, Illidiance, Cypecore, Mechina, and Neurotech.

===Commercial rise===

Industrial metal blossomed in the early 1990s, particularly in North America, where it would eventually sell close to 35 million units. It first became a commercial force in 1992 when Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Broken&quot; and Ministry&#x27;s &quot;Psalm 69&quot; went platinum in America, though the latter took three years to reach that status. Both groups were nominated for the Best Metal Performance in the 1992 Grammy Awards, with Nine Inch Nails winning. Two years later, Nine Inch Nails released &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, which debuted at No. 2, and would eventually go quadruple-platinum. This record is considered by &quot;AllMusic&quot; as &quot;one of the bleakest multi-platinum albums ever&quot;.

Following Nine Inch Nails&#x27; success, Marilyn Manson, led by a protégé of Reznor&#x27;s, came to prominence. The group&#x27;s live performance and its transgressive appeal was often more commented on than their music.

Industrial metal reached its commercial zenith in the latter half of the 1990s – according to the RIAA databases, its top-selling artists sold around 17.5 million units combined. Records by major industrial metal artists routinely debuted on the top spots of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart: Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe&quot; (No. 5), Marilyn Manson&#x27;s &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; (No. 3), and Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;The Fragile&quot; (No. 1). A number of industrial metal albums performed well on Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Heatseekers&quot; chart: Filter&#x27;s &quot;Short Bus&quot; (No. 3), Stabbing Westward&#x27;s &quot;Wither Blister Burn + Peel&quot; (No. 1), Rammstein&#x27;s &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; (No. 2), Orgy&#x27;s &quot;Candyass&quot; (No. 1), and Static-X&#x27;s &quot;Wisconsin Death Trip&quot; (No. 1).

During this era, Trent Reznor was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the most influential Americans of 1997. The genre&#x27;s popularity was such that established glam metal groups, including Guns N&#x27; Roses and Mötley Crüe, began to dabble in the style. Figures from the hip hop scene also began to seek out collaborations with and remixes from industrial metal musicians.

When industrial metal climbed the charts of the late 1990s, its sudden popularity was met with negative reactions from the early innovators of industrial music. Peter Christopherson told &quot;The Wire&quot; that he no longer felt any kinship with the industrial scene: &quot;this is not me, this is not what I&#x27;m about&quot;. Lustmord, a prominent early industrial musician, declared that &quot;Ministry just doesn&#x27;t interest [him]&quot; and &quot;[he has] no time for all this rock and roll shit they&#x27;re doing now.&quot; Skinny Puppy frontman Nivek Ogre dismissed Nine Inch Nails as &quot;cock rock&quot; but have since patched things up and have even performed on stage together.

Industrial metal suffered a critical backlash at the turn of the millennium. In an April 2000 review for the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot;, Jim DeRogatis dismissed Nine Inch Nails&#x27; new music as a &quot;generic brand of industrial thrash&quot; and accused Ministry of repeating an act that &quot;was old by 1992&quot;. Although &quot;The Fragile&quot; reached the top spot of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and went on to earn double platinum status, DeRogatis considered it a &quot;flop&quot; nonetheless.
Around this time, veteran industrial metal artists (Ministry, Godflesh, and White Zombie) began to repudiate the industrial label. Sales remained high throughout 2000–2005; at least 10 million records were sold during that time frame. Many groups began to take influence from hip hop and electronic music, in addition to industrial metal. As a result, acts like Powerman 5000 are often described as industrial metal as well as nu metal.

==Film and video==
Several industrial metal groups have produced eye-catching videos. These include Godflesh&#x27;s collaboration with Andres Serrano, Aidan Hughes&#x27;s graphics for KMFDM, Nine Inch Nails&#x27; work with Mark Romanek, Rob Zombie&#x27;s visual work for White Zombie (for which he received the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hard Rock Video), and Marilyn Manson&#x27;s output with Richard Kern and Floria Sigismondi. NIN later collaborated with Bill Viola for live accompaniment. Trent Reznor also produced the soundtracks for the films &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; and &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, and served as &quot;musical consultant&quot; for &quot;Man on Fire&quot;. Rob Zombie has directed three films. In 2009, Marilyn Manson was in the process of directing &quot;&quot;. The movie has since languished in development hell. Other films that have included prominent contributions from industrial metal artists include &quot;The Crow&quot;, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, &quot;Hideaway&quot;, &quot;(Mortal Kombat&quot;/&quot;1997 sequel)&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Blair Witch&quot; and &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;.

==Controversy==
Its emphasis on transgressive themes has made a few industrial metal groups vulnerable to attack from American social conservatives. For example, Sen. Bob Dole, then head of the Republican Party, sharply criticized Time Warner after a meeting between Michael J. Fuchs (head of the Warner Music Group), William Bennett, and C. Delores Tucker, at which Tucker and Bennett demanded that Fuchs read lyrics from NIN&#x27;s &quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot;. A year later, Bennett, Tucker, and Joseph Lieberman launched a similar campaign against MCA Records for their distribution of Marilyn Manson&#x27;s music. Many of his concerts were cancelled by authorities after this uproar. In addition, Dennis Cooper cited Ministry&#x27;s video for &quot;Just One Fix&quot;, which featured footage of William S. Burroughs, as an early example of heroin chic. Some initial reports claimed that Columbine High School shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were Marilyn Manson fans. In fact, they preferred KMFDM and Rammstein. Asa Coon, another school shooter, was a Manson fan.
Manson, a former journalist, published a detailed response to the controversy following the Columbine shootings in an article published in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. It concluded:

Sascha Konietzko reported that KMFDM was &quot;sick and appalled&quot; by the shootings, issuing a statement the following day saying:
Rammstein stated that they &quot;have no lyrical content or political beliefs that could have possibly influenced such behavior&quot;. Rammstein have also been controversial for their use of Nazi imagery, including footage shot by Leni Riefenstahl for &quot;Olympia&quot; in their video for &quot;Stripped&quot;. Alec Empire, a German digital hardcore musician, declared that &quot;[Rammstein is] successful for all the wrong reasons. I think they&#x27;re not a fascist band at all, but I think in Germany there&#x27;s a lot of misunderstanding and that&#x27;s why they sell records and I think that&#x27;s dangerous.&quot; In response to the controversy, Rammstein stated that &quot;We are not Nazis, Neo-Nazis, or any other kind of Nazi. We are against racism, bigotry or any other type of discrimination.&quot; The band went on to create the song &quot;Links 2-3-4&quot;, released in 2001, which responded to the Nazi allegations by insinuating that they reside left on the political spectrum.

<text>The Girl Next Door is a 2004 American romantic comedy film directed by Luke Greenfield. It follows a high school senior who falls in love for the first time with the girl next door, but finds the situation becoming complicated after he learns that she is a former pornographic actress. It stars Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert, Timothy Olyphant, James Remar, Chris Marquette, and Paul Dano. The film received mixed reviews and low theatrical attendance at the time, but over time has gained cult film status.

==Plot==

Ambitious high school senior Matthew Kidman has been accepted to Georgetown University but cannot afford the tuition. As class president, he has raised $25,000 in order to bring a brilliant Cambodian student, Samnang, to study in the United States, but otherwise feels there is nothing exciting to remember from his high school years. His friends Eli (aspiring filmmaker and obsessed with porn) and Klitz (timid and socially awkward) are not receptive to his suggestions that they take some risks and get crazy before they graduate.

Matthew’s life changes when the beautiful Danielle moves in next door. After he catches her undressing, Danielle takes Matthew on a drive through town. Danielle persuades Matthew to undress in the street, steals his clothes, and drives off as revenge for watching her undress.

Matthew and Danielle go on to bond through a series of flirtatious dares. At a raucous party thrown by a classmate, Matthew finally finds the courage to kiss Danielle. The following day, Matthew&#x27;s reverie is shattered when Eli informs him that Danielle is a former adult film actress.

On Eli&#x27;s advice, Matthew takes Danielle to a motel and tries to treat her like a sex worker. Danielle, insulted, abruptly ends their relationship. Believing that her past can’t be outrun, she resigns to give up her attempts at normalcy and return to the adult industry. Matthew, Eli, and Klitz search for Danielle at an adult film convention in Las Vegas where Kelly, an adult film producer and Danielle&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, menacingly warns Matthew not to interfere with his business. Matthew ignores him, convincing Danielle to leave porn for good.

Days later, an enraged Kelly abducts Matthew from school and physically attacks him, saying that Danielle’s failure to film has cost him $30,000. Kelly offers to let Matthew erase his debt by stealing an award from the home of his former business partner, Hugo Posh. After Matthew enters the house, Kelly calls the police and leaves the scene. Matthew narrowly escapes and rushes to an important scholarship award dinner. High on ecstasy that Kelly tricked him into taking, he improvises a sentimental speech. Although he endears himself to Danielle, he does not win the scholarship.

Kelly exacts further revenge by posing as Matthew&#x27;s student advisor and stealing the money raised for Samnang. Matthew fears that he will be implicated in the fraud. He turns to Danielle for help, and she calls Hugo Posh; they agree to make a pornographic film on prom night with Danielle&#x27;s former colleagues and Matthew&#x27;s classmates as actors. Eli directs the production, and when no one else is able to perform an important scene, Klitz finds the confidence to undertake it. They celebrate the successful shoot; Matthew and Danielle make love for the first time.

The next morning, Eli calls Matthew, informing him that the tape has been stolen. Matthew enters his house to find Kelly in possession of the tape and talking with his parents and principal. Kelly demands Matthew&#x27;s half of the eventual profits. When Matthew refuses, Kelly plays the tape for the group, who are surprised to find that Matthew and his friends have made a modern sexual education film. Although initially skeptical, they realize that Matthew&#x27;s film could work. Having failed again to destroy Matthew’s life, Kelly finally admits defeat and shows a grudging respect for Matthew.

Hugo Posh and Matthew make millions, and Posh pays for Samnang&#x27;s travel to the U.S. Matthew sends Kelly some luxury cigars as a gift, ending their rivalry, while Eli becomes a successful filmmaker. Klitz attends college and is pleased to learn that his classmates are impressed with his scene in the film. Matthew attends Georgetown and brings Danielle to DC with him.

==Cast==
==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $14,589,444 in the US, plus $15,821,739 outside the US, for a combined gross of $30,411,183.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 56% approval rating based on 159 reviews, with an average rating of 5.60/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;The movie borrows heavily from &quot;Risky Business&quot;, though Hirsch and Cuthbert are appealing leads.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average average score of 47 based on 32 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Sheri Linden of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called it a &quot;Sharp, vivacious comedy.&quot; 
Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;An entertaining affair whose wild-card creativity never ceases to surprise.&quot;
Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B− grade and wrote: &quot;&quot;Risky Business&quot; had a great opening act and then descended into contrivances. This genial cardboard knockoff is contrived from the start but gets better as it goes along.&quot;

Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; gave it a mixed review, criticizing it for being &quot;recycled&quot; comparing it to &quot;Risky Business&quot;, &quot;American Pie&quot;, and 1980s Brat Pack romances, and calling the script &quot;shamelessly derivative&quot;. He describes the lead actors as &quot;attractive but bland&quot; but praised the supporting cast, especially the &quot;scene-stealing turn&quot; by Olyphant. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;[o]ffers a view of pornography that is nonjudgmental, even celebratory, but at the same time its premise – that Danielle must be rescued from the shame and degradation of her old job – suggests a more traditional, disapproving point of view. Instead of addressing this contradiction, the movie is happy to wallow in it, which would be fine if it had any real pleasure to offer.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half stars out of four, describing it as a &quot;nasty piece of business&quot; and faulted the studio for marketing the film as a teen comedy.

<text>6489 Golevka is an Apollo, Mars-crosser, and Alinda asteroid discovered in 1991 by Eleanor F. Helin.

Its name has a complicated origin. In 1995, Golevka was studied simultaneously by three radar observatories across the world: Goldstone in California, Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope in Ukraine (Yevpatoria is sometimes romanized as Evpatoria) and Kashima in Japan. &#x27;Golevka&#x27; comes from the first few letters of each observatory&#x27;s name; it was proposed by the discoverer following a suggestion by Alexander L. Zaitsev.

Golevka is a small object, measuring 0.6 × 1.4 km. The radar observations revealed that it has a very strange, angular shape that looks different depending on the direction. In 2003 the Yarkovsky effect was first observed at work by high-precision radar observations of Golevka. Between 1991 and 2003, the small force of the Yarkovsky effect caused a shift of from what would be expected based on only gravitational interactions. This helped evaluate the asteroid&#x27;s bulk density (2.7 ± 0.5 g/cm3) and mass (2.10 kg).
Golevka approaches Earth to in 2046, 0.10 AU in 2069, and 0.11 AU in 2092. On the other hand, Golevka&#x27;s collision probability with any planet is negligible for at least the next nine centuries. Its orbit is strikingly similar to that of 4179 Toutatis in eccentricity, semi-major axis, and inclination. However, Toutatis is better known due to a close approach to Earth in 2004.

<text>The British Rail Class 14 is a type of small diesel-hydraulic locomotive built in the mid-1960s. Twenty-six of these 0-6-0 locomotives were ordered in January 1963, to be built at British Railways&#x27; Swindon Works. The anticipated work for this class was trip working movements between local yards and short-distance freight trains. The good all-around visibility from the cab and dual controls also made them capable of being used for shunting duties. The order was expanded from 26 to 56 in mid-1963, before work had started on the first order. They were numbered D9500-D9555.

==Technical details==
In July 1964, the first of a class of 56 locomotives appeared from Swindon Works. These were later designated as TOPS Class 14 by British Railways. They are known as &#x27;Teddy Bears&#x27; by enthusiasts, following a comment by Swindon Works&#x27; erecting shop foreman George Cole who quipped &quot;We&#x27;ve built &quot;The Great Bear&quot;, now we&#x27;re going to build a &#x27;Teddy Bear&#x27;!&quot;

In outline they have a cab offset from the centre with bonnets at each end, with a fixed 0-6-0 wheel configuration rather than bogies as seen on all the other Type 1 classes. The locomotives were powered by a Paxman 6-cylinder Ventura 6YJXL engine with a Napier turbocharger producing , connected to a Voith L217U hydraulic transmission and Hunslet final drive. The axles were connected by coupling rods and driven by a jackshaft located under the cab, between the second and third axles. The plate frames were of 1 inch steel and deep buffer beams almost to rail level. One was of similar thickness to the frames, the other of 5 inch thick steel to act as ballast and to even out weight distribution.

==Operations and preservation==
Originally all were allocated to depots on the Western Region of British Railways, but in January 1967 twenty were sent to Hull (Dairycoates) on the Eastern Region (ER), followed by thirteen more later the same year. At Hull they were intended for work around the docks, but the tasks were beyond the capabilities of a single locomotive; and since two locomotives required two sets of crew, they were not popular with the region. In 1968, all 33 ER locomotives were placed in storage, and were subsequently withdrawn on 1 April that year.

The Class 14s, like many other early diesel types, had an extremely short life with British Railways – in this case not because of poor reliability, but because many of its envisaged duties disappeared on the BR network as a result of the Beeching cuts. BR started to dispose of members of the class from mid 1968, and the entire class had been sold to industry or scrapped by the end of 1970. In their new careers in industry, many had a working life two to three times longer than that with British Railways. The industries in which they were employed, such as coal mining, declined during the 1970s and the class again became surplus to requirements. Several have since found a third lease of life on preserved lines where they are ideal for both light passenger work and with works trains on the maintenance of permanent way.

Unusually, D9504 was leased in 2005 from its preservation group and found itself in revenue-earning service on the newest mainline in the UK – High Speed 1 (known as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link during construction) – mainly in marshalling and stabling the 450 metre, 22-wagon concrete-pumping train on the final stretch to St. Pancras Station.

D9524 was re-engined under the ownership of BP Grangemouth. It was later re-engined again under the ownership of the Scottish RPS who, following BR practice, gave it the number 14901. It now operates with a Rolls-Royce DV8TCE (640 bhp) power unit.

The last of the class to be built, D9555, was the final locomotive constructed for British Railways at Swindon Works, in 1965; today it is privately owned and operates on the Dean Forest Railway, Gloucestershire – its original route.

In July 2014, the East Lancashire Railway hosted ten preserved members of the class as a celebration of the 50 years since their entry into service.

==Models==
Hattons Model Railways commissioned Danish company Heljan to produce a limited run in OO gauge in three liveries. Since then, they have announced plans for further examples, still in limited numbers, but in a wider variety of liveries.

In 2010, Graham Farish introduced a BR blue Class 14 in British N gauge.

Minerva Model Railways announced the production of a ready-to-run O gauge (7mm Finescale) model in May 2019. Delivery commenced in February 2022 following delays due to incorrect cab colour on the initial supplies.

In 2011 a 7 1/4&quot; gauge model of D9522 won best locomotive and best model in show at the national model engineering exhibition in Harrogate.

<doc id="592305" wikidata="Q347372" url="?curid=592305" title="Louis Jules Mancini, Duke of Nevers">
<text>Louis Jules Mancini, 4th (and last) [[Duke of Nevers]] (&quot;Louis Jules Barbon&quot;; 16 December 1716 – 25 February 1798) was a French diplomat and writer.

The Duke was the sixth member elected to occupy seat No. 4 of the Académie française in 1742. In England, he was styled &quot;Duke of Nivernois&quot;. 

==Biography==
Mancini was born in Paris, son of Philippe Jules François Mancini (the 3rd duke of Nevers from 1707 until his death in 1768), and his wife, Anna Maria Spinola, whom he married in 1709. His father, Philippe, was a great-nephew of Cardinal Mazarin and a great-grandson of the famous beauty Gabrièlle de Rochechouart de Mortemart, sister of Madame de Montespan.

Mancini was educated at Lycée Louis le Grand before he joined the French Army serving in the Italian campaigns (1733) and in Bohemia (1740); but, he had to give up soldiering on account of weak health. In 1738, he sold property including the château de Druyes to Louis Damas, Marquis of Anlezy.

He was subsequently French Ambassador to Rome (1748–1752), Berlin (1755–1756) and London, where he negotiated the Treaty of Paris (10 February 1763). From 1787 to 1789 he was a member of the Council of State. He chose not to emigrate during the Revolution, which led to the loss of all his money and he was imprisoned in 1793. He regained his liberty after the fall of Maximilien Robespierre, and died in Paris on 25 February 1798.

In 1743 the Duke was elected to the Académie française for a poem entitled &quot;Délie&quot;, and from 1763 he devoted the greater part of his time to the administration of his Burgundian estates in Nevers as well as to &quot;Belles-lettres&quot;. He wrote a great deal and with great facility; but his writings nowadays are generally considered to be of little value, his &quot;Fables&quot; being his best work. His &quot;Œuvres complètes&quot; were published in Paris in 1796; an edition of his &quot;Œuvres posthumes&quot; was brought out in Paris by Nicolas-Louis François de Neufchâteau in 1807, and his &quot;Correspondance secrète&quot; was published in Paris by De Lescure in 1866.
==Marriage==
At the age of fourteen, he was married to Hélène Phélypeaux de Pontchartrain (1715–1781), daughter of Jérôme Phélypeaux, Count of Pontchartrain.

==Children==

#unnamed Mancini (1737)
# Princess Hélène Mancini (1740–1780) married Louis Marie Foucquet de Belle-Isle, Count of Gisors (1732–1758), son of the Duke of Belle-Isle, himself son of Nicolas Fouquet who purchased Belle-Isle; married again to Charles Louis, Count of Marsan, brother of the Duchess of Bouillon without issue;
# Princess Adélaïde Diane Mancini (1742–1808) married Louis Hercule Timoléon de Cossé, Duke of Brissac. 
# Prince Jules Frédéric Mancini, styled &quot;Count of Nevers&quot; (1745–1753), died in infancy. 
# Prince Louis Mancini (1748–1748), died in infancy.

Styled &quot;Prince de Vergagne&quot; whilst heir to his father&#x27;s titles, he was also a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and a Knight of the Golden Fleece and of the Holy Spirit. The dukedom became extinct upon his death.

<text>John Nichols Dalton (July 11, 1931July 30, 1986) was an American politician who served as the 63rd governor of Virginia, from 1978 to 1982. Dalton won the office with 55.9% of the vote, defeating Democrat Henry E. Howell Jr. and Independent Alan R. Ogden. Dalton had previously served as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia.

==Biography==

Born in Emporia, Virginia, Dalton graduated from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, and the University of Virginia Law School. He served in both houses of the General Assembly (Virginia House of Delegates, 1966–1972, Senate of Virginia, 1973). Dalton was the 32nd Lieutenant Governor from 1974 to 1978. As governor, he pursued policies of limited government. He also settled the federal lawsuit on the desegregation of Virginia&#x27;s institutions of higher education.

Dalton was the adopted son of Theodore Roosevelt Dalton, his uncle, who was the Republican candidate for governor in 1953 and 1957. As a young man his next-door neighbor was Charlotte Giesen, first Republican woman elected to the House of Delegates. Dalton died at 55 of lung cancer. He is buried at Sunrise Burial Park in Radford.

His personal papers, including those from his time as governor, are held by the Special Collections Research Center at the College of William &amp; Mary. His executive papers from his time as governor are held by the Library of Virginia. Dalton Intermediate School, in Radford, Virginia, is named after the former governor. Dalton Hall, a building at Radford University that houses dining facilities, and the university bookstore is named for Dalton.

Dalton&#x27;s son-in-law, Steve Baril, sought the 2005 Republican nomination for attorney general of Virginia.

<doc id="592309" wikidata="Q979488" url="?curid=592309" title="Wilson's plover">
<text>Wilson&#x27;s plover (Anarhynchus wilsonia) is a small bird of the family Charadriidae.

It was named after the Scottish-American ornithologist Alexander Wilson by his friend George Ord in 1814.

Wilson&#x27;s plover is a coastal wader which breeds on both coasts of the Americas from the equator northwards. Its range extends north to include much of the U.S. eastern seaboard, and the Pacific coast of Mexico on the west.

==Range and habitat==
It is a partial migrant. Birds leave the United States, except Florida, to winter south in Brazil. Some Mexican birds leave in winter for Peru. Furthermore, a small resident population is known from Brazil, it being named as a new subspecies, &quot;brasiliensis&quot;, in 2008. In 2012 it was established that this is a junior synonym, and the correct name for the subspecies is &quot;crassirostris&quot;. This also means that one of the subspecies of the greater sand plover had to be renamed.
This strictly coastal plover nests on a bare scrape on sandy beaches or sandbars.

==Description==
The breeding male has a black breast band, lores and forecrown, and a rufous mask. Females and non-breeding males have a similar plumage, but the black of the breeding male is replaced by brown or rufous. Non-breeders have a greyer tint to the head and breast band.
Immature birds are similar to the female, but the breast band is often incomplete. The adult&#x27;s upper parts are mainly dark grey, with a short white wing bar and white tail sides. The underparts are white except for a breast band, and the legs are pink, brighter when breeding. The dark bill is large and heavy for a plover of this size. The call is a high weak whistle.

Measurements:

* Length: 6.3-7.9 in (16-20 cm)
* Weight: 1.9-2.5 oz (55-70 g)
* Wingspan: 19 in (48.2 cm)

==Diet==
Wilson&#x27;s plovers forage for food on beaches, usually by sight, moving slowly across the beach. They have a liking for crabs, but will also eat insects and marine worms.

<doc id="592311" wikidata="Q223041" url="?curid=592311" title="International Tennis Federation">
<text>The International Tennis Federation (ITF) is the governing body of world tennis, wheelchair tennis, and beach tennis. It was founded in 1913 as the International Lawn Tennis Federation by twelve national tennis associations. there are 211 national and six regional associations that make up the ITF&#x27;s membership.

The ITF&#x27;s governance responsibilities include maintaining and enforcing the rules of tennis, regulating international team competitions, promoting the game, and preserving the sport&#x27;s integrity via anti-doping and anti-corruption programs. The ITF partners with the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) to govern professional tennis.

The ITF organizes annual team competitions for men (Davis Cup), women (Billie Jean King Cup), and mixed teams (Hopman Cup), as well as tennis and wheelchair tennis events at the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games on behalf of the International Olympic Committee. The ITF sanctions circuits that span age ranges (junior, professional men and women, and seniors) as well as disciplines (wheelchair tennis; beach tennis). In addition to these circuits, the ITF also maintains rankings for juniors, seniors, wheelchair and beach tennis.

== History ==

Duane Williams, an American who lived in Switzerland, is generally recognized as the initiator and driving force behind the foundation of the International Tennis Federation. He died in the sinking of the . Originally called the &quot;International Lawn Tennis Federation&quot; (ILTF) it held its inaugural conference at the headquarters of the (USFSA), in Paris, France on 1 March 1913 which was attended by 12 national associations. Three other countries could not attend but had requested to become a member. The 15 founding countries were: Australasia (Australia and New Zealand), Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Canada, Norway, and the United States were also invited but declined to join. Voting rights were divided based on the perceived importance of the individual countries, with Great Britain&#x27;s Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) receiving the maximum six votes.

The LTA was given the perpetual right to organize the World Grass Championships, which led to a refusal by the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) to join the ILTF as they were of the opinion that this title should be given to the Davis Cup. France received permission to stage the World Hard Court Championships until 1916 and additionally a World Covered Court Championships was founded. The USLTA joined in 1923 on the basis of two compromises: the title &#x27;World Championships&#x27; would be abolished, and wording would be &#x27;for ever in the English language&#x27;. The World Championships were replaced by a new category of Official Championships for the main tournaments in Australia, France, England, and the United States; now known as the four Majors or Grand Slam events. In 1924, the ILTF became the officially recognised organisation with authority to control lawn tennis throughout the world, with official &quot;ILTF Rules of Tennis&quot;.

In 1939 the ILTF had 59 member nations. Its funds were moved to London, England during World War II and from that time onward the ITF has been run from there. It was based at Wimbledon until 1987, when it moved to Barons Court, next door to Queen&#x27;s Club. It then moved again in 1998 to the Bank of England Sports Ground, Roehampton, its current base of operations. In 1977 the word &#x27;Lawn&#x27; was dropped from the name of the organization, in recognition of the fact that most tennis events were no longer played on grass.

In reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the ITF cancelled all events in Russia. The ITF also excluded Russia from international team events, which include the Davis Cup, the Billie Jean King Cup, and the ATP Cup, and suspended the Russian Tennis Federation. However, the ATP and the WTA refused to yield to international pressure to ban individual players from competition. Russian players will carry on, but not play under the Russian national flag.

== Publications ==
Its official annual is &quot;The ITF Year&quot;, describing the activities of the ITF over the last 12 months. This replaced &quot;World of Tennis&quot;, which was the ITF official annual from 1981 through 2001. In addition, it publishes an official magazine three times a year.

== Structure ==
=== National and regional associations ===

As of 2017, there are 211 national associations affiliated with the ITF, of which 148 are voting members and 63 are associate members. The criteria for allocating votes (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 12) to each voting member are: performance in ITF team competitions; professional (ATP/WTA), junior, and wheelchair rankings of individuals; track record in organizing international tournaments; and contribution to ITF infrastructure. For example, France garners 12 votes, Canada has 9, Egypt has 5, Pakistan has 3, and Botswana has 1 vote.

Regional associations were created in July 1975 as six &quot;supra-national associations&quot; (Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, South America, and Australia) with the aim to decrease the gap between the ILTF and the national associations. These evolved into the current regional associations:
: Asian Tennis Federation (ATF) – 44 members
: Central American &amp; Caribbean Tennis Confederation (COTECC) – 33 members
: Confederation of African Tennis (CAT) – 52 members
: Oceania Tennis Federation (OTF) – 20 members
: South America Tennis Confederation (COSAT) – 10 members
: Tennis Europe (TE) – 50 members (Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Tennis Europe suspended from membership both the Russian Tennis Federation and the Belarus Tennis Federation.)
: ITF members with no regional affiliation (Canada and the United States)

=== Board of directors ===
The ITF President and Board of Directors are elected every four years by the national associations. Candidates are nominated by the national associations, and may serve up to twelve years.
=== List of presidents ===
The following people have served as president of the ITF:
== Governance ==
The ITF is the world governing body for the sport of tennis. Its governance includes the following responsibilities: make, amend, and enforce the Rules of Tennis; regulate international team competitions; promote the game of tennis; and preserve the integrity of tennis.

By its own constitution, the ITF guarantees that the official Rules of Tennis &quot;shall be for ever in the English language&quot;. A committee within the ITF periodically makes rule amendment recommendations to the board of directors. The Rules of Tennis encompass the manner of play and scoring, in-game coaching, and the technical specifications of equipment (e.g. ball, racket, net, court) and other technology (e.g. player analysis technology). The Rules cover tennis, wheelchair tennis, and beach tennis.

Through the Tennis Anti-Doping Program, the ITF implements the World Anti-Doping Code (from the World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA) for tennis. National associations must implement the code within its national jurisdiction, report violations up to the ITF and WADA, and report annually about all testing conducted. The Tennis Anti-Doping Program began in 1993, and applies to all players who play in ITF-sanctioned competitions, as well as tournaments on the ATP Tour and WTA Tour. In 2015, 2514 samples were collected from men and 1919 samples were collected from women; 2256 samples were collected during tennis tournaments (&quot;in-competition&quot;) and 2177 were collected at other times (&quot;out-of-competition&quot;).

The Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) is a joint initiative of the primary governing bodies in tennis: the ITF, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA), and the Grand Slam Board. Formed in 2008 in response to betting-related corruption challenges, the TIU&#x27;s mandate is to protect tennis from &quot;all forms of betting-related corrupt practices&quot;. As with the anti-doping efforts, national associations are charged with the responsibility of enforcing a code of conduct and reporting any violations.

== Competitions ==

=== Team competitions ===
The ITF operates the two major annual international team competitions in the sport, the Davis Cup for men and the Billie Jean King Cup for women. It also sanctions the Hopman Cup, an annual mixed-gender team tournament. The ITF also organizes tennis and wheelchair tennis events every four years at the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games on behalf of the International Olympic Committee.

==== Davis Cup ====


The Davis Cup, named after its founder Dwight F. Davis, is an annual team event organized by the ITF (since 1979 when it replaced the Committee of Davis Cup Nations as event organiser) in men&#x27;s tennis contested between teams from competing countries in a knock-out format. The first Davis Cup took place in 1900, prior to the formation of the ITF. Since 2019, the tournament has ended with the Davis Cup Finals, an 18-team event (being reduced to 16 effective in 2022) held at a single site in which teams are divided into groups for round-robin pool play. Eight teams advance to the quarterfinals, with all subsequent ties held in a standard knockout format. From 1981 to 2018, the tournament was divided into a 16-nation World Group, and zone groups (Americas; Europe/Africa; and Asia/Oceania) which compete in three or four tiers. Starting in 2019, the Davis Cup introduced a new format for its top level. The World Group was expanded to two levels, World Group I and World Group II, each consisting of 24 teams (reducing to 16 from 2022), with lower levels remaining intact. Each year, successful teams are may be promoted up one level, while unsuccessful teams are relegated down one level. Davis Cup rounds are contested four times per year, scheduled to minimize disruption with the ATP Tour to encourage participation. In each round, a combination of singles and doubles matches are contested to determine the winners. In 2020, 142 nations participated, making it the largest annual international team competition in sport.

==== Billie Jean King Cup ====
The Billie Jean King Cup is an annual team event organized by the ITF in women&#x27;s tennis, similar in format to the Davis Cup. It was launched in 1963 as the Federation Cup to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the ITF, renamed the Fed Cup in 1995, and renamed again to honor tennis great Billie Jean King in 2020. The current format, adopted in 2020, is similar to that now used for the Davis Cup, with nations being divided into zone groups (Americas; Europe/Africa; and Asia/Oceania) which compete in two or three tiers, with the top tier being the 12-team Billie Jean King Cup Finals. The Finals are conducted in a similar manner as those of the Davis Cup, with pool play followed by knockout semifinals and finals. The winner and runner-up of the Finals automatically qualify for the next season&#x27;s Finals. Teams ranked 3–10 advance to the next season&#x27;s Billie Jean King Cup Qualifiers, where they play against the winners of the previous season&#x27;s Billie Jean King Cup Play-offs. The play-offs in turn involve the losing teams from the Qualifiers and winning teams from the top-level zone groups. Like the Davis Cup, the rules of promotion and relegation are almost the same each year. Billie Jean King Cup rounds are contested three times per year, scheduled to minimize disruption with the WTA Tour to encourage participation. In each round, a combination of singles and doubles matches are contested to determine the winners. In 2020, 116 nations participated, making it the largest annual international team competition in women&#x27;s sport.

==== Hopman Cup ====
The Hopman Cup is an annual team event which is contested by mixed-gender national teams. The first tournament was held in 1989, and the event has been sanctioned by the ITF since 1997. The tournament is held over one week at the start of the tennis season (late December or early January) in Australia. Each year, eight nations are selected to compete, with one female and one male invited to attend. Two pools of four teams each play matches in a round-robin format, with the top team from each pool qualifying for the final.

==== Olympics and Paralympics ====
Tennis (lawn tennis) was part of the Summer Olympic Games program from the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics, but was dropped after the 1924 Summer Olympics due to disputes between the ITF and the International Olympic Committee over allowing amateur players to compete. After two appearances as a demonstration sport in 1968 and 1984, it returned as a full medal sport at the 1988 Summer Olympics and has been played at every edition of the Games since then.

Wheelchair tennis was first contested at the Summer Paralympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1988, with two events being held (Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Singles). It became an official medal-awarding sport in 1992 and has been competed at every Summer Paralympics since then. Four events were held from 1992 to 2000, with quad events (mixed gender) in both singles and doubles added in 2004.

=== Individual competitions ===
The ITF sanctions the Grand Slam tennis tournaments as well as circuits which span age ranges (junior, professional, and seniors) as well as disciplines (wheelchair tennis; beach tennis). In addition to these circuits, the ITF also maintains rankings for juniors, seniors, wheelchair, and beach tennis.

==== Grand Slam tournaments ====

The ITF organizes and sanctions the &#x27;Official Tennis Championships of the International Tennis Federation&#x27;, commonly known as the Grand Slam events: the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. It is a member of the Grand Slam Committee.

==== Professional circuit ====

The ITF organizes introductory (&quot;apprentice&quot; level) professional circuits for both men and women as a bridge between junior tournaments and playing on the higher-profile tours organized by the ATP and WTA, respectively. Professional circuit tournaments are open to all tennis players aged 14 and over based on merit, and offer both prize money and world ranking points for main draw match victories. The tournaments are owned or sanctioned by the national associations and approved by the ITF.

Although circuits were introduced to men&#x27;s tennis in 1976, the ITF assumed responsibility for developing them in 1990. From then until 2006, four-week satellite tournaments were run, where participants were required to compete in the entire series. In 1998, single-week ITF Futures tournaments were introduced, although they are scheduled in two or three-week geographic clusters. As of 2016, over 600 ITF Futures tournaments in 77 countries were held, with prize funds ranging from US$10,000 to US$25,000. ITF Futures tournaments represent the third tier of men&#x27;s tournaments, below the mid-level ATP Challenger Tour and the top-level ATP World Tour.

The ITF assumed responsibility for an apprentice-level women&#x27;s circuit in 1984. As of 2016, the ITF Women&#x27;s Circuit includes over 500 tournaments in 65 countries, with prize funds ranging from US$10,000 to US$100,000. The ITF Women&#x27;s Circuit is the third tier in women&#x27;s tennis, below the mid-level WTA 125 tournaments and the top-level WTA Tour.

==== Junior circuit ====
Starting in 1977, the ITF has organized a series of international tennis tournaments for junior players. Tournaments have various grades: Grade A (the highest; junior Grand Slams and some others), Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, Grade 4, and Grade 5 (the lowest). Depending on the grade of tournament, players earn points toward the ITF Junior World Rankings. In 2004, the ITF introduced combined junior rankings rather than maintaining separate singles and doubles rankings for juniors in an effort to encourage doubles play. As of 2015, the junior circuit includes 400 tournaments in 121 countries, open to players who are between their 13th and 19th birthdays.

In order to help high-ranking junior girls transition from the junior circuit to the professional circuit, the ITF began the Girls Junior Exempt Project in 1997. Under this program, girls ranked in the top 10 at the end of the year are given direct entry into the main draw of three events on the ITF professional circuit the following year. In 2006, this project was extended for boys under similar rules.

==== Seniors circuit ====
The ITF World Tennis Masters Tour was renamed in August 2022 (previously ITF Seniors Tour). The ITF World Tennis Masters Tour provides a range of team and individual singles, doubles and mixed doubles events for each five-year age increment from 30+ to 90+.
The ITF World Tennis Masters Tour Circuit has over 380 tournaments in more than 72 countries. There are six (6) tournament grades. The entry level tournament grade is MT100, followed by MT200, MT400, MT700, MT1000 and World Championships. MT700, MT1000 and World Championships are amongst the elite tournaments on the World Tour attracting some of the very best tennis players globally including but not limited to former ATP players.

Previously, tournaments were classified into various grades, with Grade A being the highest and Grade 5 being the lowest. Rankings were maintained in a series of age groups where the starting ages advance five years at a time (e.g. 35 years and older; 40 years and older) up to the 85 years and older group. World championships began in 1981. In 1993, the world championships were divided into two age ranges, and in 2015 it was further divided into three age ranges. As of 2015, the ranges are Young Seniors (35 to 49); Seniors (50 to 64); and Super-Seniors (65 to 85).

==== Wheelchair circuit ====
The first circuit for wheelchair tennis, formed in 1980 by the National Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis, had ten tournaments. Beginning in 1992, the Wheelchair Tennis Tour began with eleven events, organized by the International Wheelchair Tennis Federation (IWTF) which merged with the ITF six years later. As of 2016, the wheelchair tennis circuit includes over 160 events in over 40 countries. This includes tournaments ranging from Futures (the lowest level) up to the Grand Slams.

==== Beach tennis circuit ====
In 2008, the ITF assumed responsibility for the development of beach tennis and launched the Beach Tennis Tour (BTT). This tour started with 14 tournaments, but has grown to nearly 300 tournaments by 2015. The most prestigious of these are the ITF Beach Tennis World Team Championship, ITF Beach Tennis World Championships, European Beach Tennis Championships, and the ITF Pan American Championships. Like the other ITF circuits, tournaments are sanctioned by the ITF and primarily organized by national associations. The ITF also maintains a system of rankings for beach tennis players.

== Awards and rankings ==
=== World champions ===
The ITF designates a World Champion in several disciplines each year based on performances throughout the year, emphasizing the Grand Slam tournaments, and also considering team events such as the Davis Cup and Fed Cup. Singles champions were first named in 1978. In later years, World Champion awards were added for doubles, juniors (using a combined singles and doubles ranking), and wheelchair players.

Although the selection of World Champions generally agree with the year-end ATP and WTA rankings, this is not always the case. For example, Jennifer Capriati was designated as the World Champion in 2001, after winning the Australian Open and French Open and finishing the year ranked number two. Lindsay Davenport, on the other hand, finished the year ranked number one, but her best performances at majors were two semifinal appearances.

=== Philippe Chatrier Award ===

The Philippe Chatrier Award is an annual ITF award to recognise individuals or organisations who have made outstanding contributions to tennis globally, both on and off the court. The award, introduced in 1996, is considered to be the ITF&#x27;s highest accolade and is named after the former French tennis player Philippe Chatrier, who was President of the governing body between 1977 and 1991.

=== National rankings ===
The ITF maintains rankings of nations in both women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s tennis based solely on recent performances in the Billie Jean King Cup and Davis Cup, respectively. These rankings are used to seed teams at the start of each year in their respective groups.

The women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s rankings are calculated using a similar method. In both cases, a nation&#x27;s points are a weighted sum of points earned over the past four years. Points are earned by victorious nations depending on the group (e.g. World Group versus Zonal Groups), the round (e.g. final versus first round), and the ranking of the opponent being played. For the men&#x27;s ranking only, additional bonus points are awarded for winning on an opponent&#x27;s home ground. Points earned in the last 12 months are weighted at 100%, but points earned two years (75%), three years (50%), and four years (25%) ago are weighted less.

== Player rating and registration ==

=== ITN ===
The &quot;International Tennis Number&quot; (ITN) is an international tennis rating system that gives tennis players a number that represents their general level of play. Players are rated from ITN 1 (ATP or WTA standard or equivalent) to 10 (starter players).

Conversion charts have been developed linking the ITN to other existing rating systems in ITF tennis nations and in time it is hoped that every tennis player worldwide will have a rating.

Below ITN 10 there are 3 further categories linked to the slower balls:
* 10.1 for players using green balls on the full-size court
* 10.2 for players using orange balls on the 18-metre court
* 10.3 for players using red balls on the 11-metre court

Once players can ‘serve, rally and score’ they should have a rating to help them find players of a similar level to play with.

=== IPIN ===
In late 2004 the ITF initiated a new IPIN (International Player Identification Number) programme that requires all players who play in ITF Pro Circuit tournaments to register online. The use of IPIN has since been extended to include the ITF Junior, Seniors, and Wheelchair Circuits. A player&#x27;s IPIN, which is 3 letters followed by 7 numbers, is assigned upon registration and will not change during the course of his or her career. Once registered, players can use the IPIN website to enter and withdraw from ITF tournaments, access tournament information and updates, and see details relating to any code of conduct offenses. Annual IPIN registration fees vary depending on the ITF circuit chosen by the player.

== Integrity ==
The ITF administers the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme (TADP) on behalf of the sport and as a WADA signatory. It also administered the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program (TACP) until 2020 via its operationally independent integrity division called the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU). In 2021, the TIU was transferred out of the ITF into the new International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) following a comprehensive review of corruption in the sport. From 2022, it is intended that the TADP will also be transferred over to the ITIA.

== Fine of the Tunisian Tennis Federation ==
Tunisian player Malek Jaziri and Israeli player Amir Weintraub were scheduled to play each other at the 2013 Tashkent Challenger in October 2013, however Jaziri withdrew from the competition. According to Jaziri&#x27;s brother, Jaziri had been ordered to withdraw from the competition.

The Association of Tennis Professionals investigated and found that Jaziri had done nothing wrong and that the Tunisian Tennis Federation&#x27;s interference with the game had constituted a breach of the ITF Constitution. Consequently, Tunisia was suspended from the 2014 Davis Cup competition. ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti said, &quot;There is no room for prejudice of any kind in sport or in society. The ITF Board decided to send a strong message to the Tunisian Tennis Federation that this kind of action will not be tolerated.&quot;

== Fine of the Israel Tennis Association ==
A Davis Cup game between the Israeli national tennis team and the Belgian national tennis team was scheduled in Antwerp for 14 September 2013. Because the match was scheduled for Yom Kippur, the Israeli team requested to postpone the match by one day. The Belgian national tennis team declined to postpone the game.

The International Tennis Federation intervened and postponed the match by one day. It also fined the Israel Tennis Association more than $13,000 for the inconvenience of rescheduling.

<text>Austrian cuisine consists of many different local or regional cuisines. In addition to Viennese cuisine, which is predominantly based on the cooking traditions of the Habsburg Empire, there are independent regional traditions in all the states of Austria.

The Austrian cuisine shares similarities with its neighboring countries in Central Europe, but particularly with the cuisines of Hungary, Bavaria, Bohemia and Northern Italy. Dishes and preparation methods have often been adopted, integrated, adapted or mixed.

The Austrian cuisine is internationally known above all for its pastries such as the Kaiserschmarrn, the Apple strudel, as well as for the Tafelspitz and the Wiener schnitzel.
== Mealtimes ==
Breakfast is of the &quot;continental&quot; type, usually consisting of bread rolls with either jam or cold meats and cheese, like most of european cuisine and it is accompanied by coffee, tea or juice. The midday meal was traditionally the main meal of the day, but in modern times as Austrians work longer hours further from home this is no longer the case. The main meal is now often taken in the evening.

A mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack of a slice of bread topped with cheese or ham is referred to as a &quot;Jause&quot;; a more substantial version akin to a British &quot;ploughman&#x27;s lunch&quot; is called a &quot;Brettljause&quot; after the wooden board on which it is traditionally served.

=== Popular dishes of Vienna ===
* &quot;Rindsuppe&quot; (beef soup), a clear soup with golden colour
* &quot;Tafelspitz&quot;, beef boiled in broth (soup), often served with apple and horseradish and chives sauce
* &quot;Gulasch&quot; (goulash), a hotpot similar to Hungarian &quot;pörkölt.&quot; Austrian goulash is often eaten with rolls, bread or dumplings (&quot;Semmelknödel&quot;)
* &quot;Beuschel&quot;, a ragout containing lungs and heart
* &quot;Liptauer&quot;, a spicy cheese spread, eaten on a slice of bread
* &quot;Selchfleisch&quot;, meat that is smoked, then cooked, served with Sauerkraut and dumplings
* &quot;Powidl&quot;, a thick sweet jam made from plums
* &quot;Apfelstrudel&quot;, apple strudel
* &quot;Topfenstrudel&quot;, cream cheese strudel
* &quot;Millirahmstrudel&quot;, milk-cream strudel
* &quot;Palatschinken&quot;, pancakes similar to French crêpes, filled with jam and sprinkled with sugar or other toppings. They are also served in savoury versions, such as with spinach and cheese.
* &quot;Kaiserschmarrn&quot;, soft, fluffy pancake ripped into bites and slightly roasted in a pan, served with compote, applesauce or stewed plums.
* &quot;Germknödel&quot;, a fluffy yeast dough dumpling filled with plum jam (&quot;Powidl&quot;), garnished with melted butter and a mix of poppy seeds and powdered sugar, sometimes served with vanilla cream
* &quot;Marillenknödel&quot;, a dumpling stuffed with an apricot and covered with streusel and powdered sugar. The dough is made of potatoes or Topfen.
* &quot;Saftgulasch&quot; (juicy stew), also known as Austrian or Viennese goulash, is an Austrian twist on the traditional Hungarian dish. The characteristics of the Saftgulash is that it is prepared exclusively with lean beef and a large quantity of onions, at least two thirds of the quantity of meat used. No other vegetables are added and it must be slow cooked for at least three hours. The end result is a thick dark brown sauce with very tender pieces of beef.
* &quot;Wurstsemmel&quot; (ham rolls), basically sliced bread rolls containing a slice of ham, or sausage (Leberkäse), or also ham and cheese
* &quot;Krautfleisch&quot; or &quot;Szegediner Krautfleisch&quot; is a ragout of Austrian cuisine - prepared from pork and Sauerkraut.
* &quot;Krautspatzle,&quot; a dish consisting mainly of small noodles (spatzle) and cabbage.

==Meat==
The most popular meats in Austria are beef, pork, chicken, turkey and goose. The prominent Wiener Schnitzel is traditionally made of veal. Pork in particular is used extensively, with many dishes using offal and parts such as the snout and trotters.

Austrian butchers use a number of special cuts of meat, including &quot;Tafelspitz&quot; (beef), and &quot;Fledermaus&quot; (pork). Fledermaus (German for &quot;bat&quot;) is a cut of pork from the ham bone that resembles the winged animal. It is described as &quot;very juicy, somewhat fatty, and crossed by tendons&quot;; the latter fact makes it suitable for steaming, braising or frying after tenderization in a marinade.

Austrian cuisine has many different sausages, like &quot;Frankfurter&quot;, &quot;Käsekrainer&quot;, &quot;Debreziner&quot; (originating from Debrecen in Hungary), or &quot;Burenwurst&quot;, &quot;Blunzn&quot; made out of pig-blood and &quot;Grüne Würstl&quot;—green sausages. Green means raw in this context—the sausages are air dried and are consumed boiled. Bacon in Austria is called &quot;Speck&quot;, bacon can be smoked, raw, salted, spiced, etc. Bacon is used in many traditional recipes as a salty spice. &quot;Leberkäse&quot; is a loaf of corned beef, pork and bacon—it contains neither liver nor cheese despite the name. &quot;Vanillerostbraten&quot; is a garlicky beef dish.

=== Game ===
Austria has an old hunting tradition since there are many woods across the country. In the autumn season many restaurants in Austria traditionally offer game on their menu along with seasonal vegetables and fruits like pumpkins from Styria. Usual game are:

*Deer (venison): &quot;Hirsch&quot;
*Wild boar: &quot;Wildschwein&quot;
*Roe deer: &quot;Reh&quot;
*Fallow deer: &quot;Damhirsch&quot;
*Brown hare: &quot;Hase/Feldhase&quot;
*Common pheasant: &quot;Fasan&quot;
*Duck: &quot;Ente&quot;
*Grey partridge: &quot;Rebhuhn&quot;

The German names of game animals followed by &quot;-braten&quot; signifies a dish of roast game: &quot;Hirschbraten&quot; is roast venison.

== Sweets ==

=== Cakes ===

Austrian cakes and pastries are a well-known feature of its cuisine. Perhaps the most famous is the Sachertorte, a chocolate cake with apricot jam filling, traditionally eaten with whipped cream. Among the cakes with the longest tradition is the Linzer Torte. Other favourites include the caramel-flavoured Dobostorte and the delicately layered Esterhazy Torte, named in honour of Prince Esterházy (both originating from Hungary during the Austro-Hungarian empire), as well as a number of cakes made with fresh fruit and cream. Punschkrapfen is a classical Austrian pastry, a cake filled with cake crumbs, nougat chocolate, apricot jam and then soaked with rum. Tirolerkuchen is a hazelnut and chocolate coffee cake. Mohr im Hemd, while traditionally something closer to a chocolate custard, is now generally prepared as a steamed cake.
These cakes are typically complex and difficult to make. They can be eaten at a café or bought by the slice from a bakery. A &quot;Konditorei&quot; is a specialist cake-maker, and the designations &quot;Café-Konditorei&quot; and &quot;Bäckerei-Konditorei&quot; are common indicators that the café or bakery in question specialises in this field.

=== Desserts ===
Austrian desserts are usually slightly less complicated than the elaborate cakes described above. The most famous of these is the &quot;Apfelstrudel&quot; (apple strudel), layers of thin pastry surrounding a filling of apple, usually with cinnamon and raisins. Other strudels are also popular, such as those filled with sweetened curd cheese called &quot;Topfen&quot;, sour cherry (&quot;Weichselstrudel&quot;), sweet cherry and poppy seed strudel (&quot;Mohnstrudel&quot;).

Another favourite is &quot;Kaiserschmarr&#x27;n&quot;, a rich fluffy sweet thick pancake made with raisins and other fruits, broken into pieces and served with a fruit compote (traditionally made of plums called &quot;Zwetschkenröster&quot; ()) for dipping, while a speciality of Salzburg is the meringue-like &quot;Salzburger Nocken&quot;. The Danish pastry is said to originate from Vienna and in Denmark is called &quot;wienerbrød&quot; (Viennese bread). The Danish pastry uses a dough in the classic cuisine referred to as &quot;Viennese Dough&quot;, made of thin layers of butter and flour dough, imported to Denmark by Austrian bakers hired during a strike among the workers in Danish bakeries in 1850.

== Drinks ==
=== Coffee ===
Austria is credited in popular legend with introducing coffee to Europe after bags of coffee beans were left behind by the retreating Turkish army after the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Although the first coffeehouses had appeared in Europe some years earlier, the Viennese café tradition became an important part of the city&#x27;s identity.

Coffee is served in a variety of styles, particularly in the Viennese coffee houses. An Austrian &quot;Mokka&quot; or &quot;kleiner Schwarzer&quot; is similar to espresso, but is extracted more slowly. Other styles are prepared from the &quot;Mokka&quot;:

*&quot;großer Schwarzer&quot; – a double &quot;Mokka&quot;
*&quot;kleiner Brauner&quot; or &quot;großer Brauner&quot; – single or double &quot;Mokka&quot; plus milk
*&quot;Verlängerter&quot; – &quot;lengthened&quot; (i.e., diluted) &quot;Mokka&quot; with more water plus milk
*&quot;Melange&quot; – half &quot;Mokka&quot;, half heated milk, often topped with foamed milk
*&quot;Franziskaner&quot; – &quot;Melange&quot; topped with whipped cream and foamed milk
*&quot;Kapuziner&quot; – &quot;kleiner Schwarzer&quot; plus whipped cream
*&quot;Einspänner&quot; – &quot;großer Schwarzer&quot; topped with whipped cream
*&quot;Wiener Eiskaffee&quot; – iced &quot;Mokka&quot; with vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream

Italian styles such as cappuccino, espresso and Latte are also commonly served.

Traditionally, coffee is served with a glass of still water.

Drinking coffee together is an important social activity in Austrian culture. It is quite common for Austrians to invite friends or neighbours over for coffee and cake. This routine activity can be compared to the British afternoon tea tradition. It is also very common to go to a coffeehouse while dating.

=== Hot chocolate ===

Viennese hot chocolate is very rich, containing heavy cream in addition to chocolate, and sometimes thickened further with egg yolk.

=== Soft drinks ===

Almdudler is an Austrian soft drink based on mountain herbs and with a flavour reminiscent of sambucus beverages. It is considered the &quot;national drink of Austria&quot;, and is popularly used as a mixer with white wine or water. While Red Bull is popular all across the West, the energy drink company started in Austria. The headquarters of the Red Bull company are located at Fuschl am See near Salzburg.

Skiwasser is a traditional Austrian beverage, made by mixing water, raspberry syrup, and lemon juice. Skiwasser originated in Austrian Tyrol, offered in winter ski huts and lodges. It is usually non-alcoholic, but alcoholic variations have been created.

=== Beer ===

Beer is generally sold in the following sizes: 0.2 litre (a &quot;Pfiff&quot;), 0.33 litre (a &quot;Seidel&quot;, &quot;kleines Bier&quot; or &quot;Glas Bier&quot;) and 0.5 litre (a &quot;Krügerl&quot; or &quot;großes Bier&quot; or &quot;Hoibe&quot;). At festivals one litre &quot;Maß&quot; and two litre &quot;Doppelmaß&quot; in the Bavarian style are also sometimes dispensed. The most popular types of beer are pale lager (known as &quot;Märzen&quot; in Austria), naturally cloudy &quot;Zwicklbier&quot;, and wheat beer. At holidays like Christmas and Easter bock beer is also available.

Austrian beers are typically in the pale lager style, with the exceptions noted above. A dark amber &quot;Vienna Style&quot; lager was pioneered in the city during the 19th century but is no longer common there.

=== Wine ===
Wine is principally cultivated in the east of Austria. The most important wine-producing areas are in Lower Austria, Burgenland, Styria, and Vienna. The Grüner Veltliner grape provides some of Austria&#x27;s most notable white wines; Zweigelt is the most widely planted red wine grape. Southern Burgenland is a region that mainly grows red grapes; the &quot;Seewinkel&quot; area, east of the Neusiedler See in Burgenland&#x27;s north, has more mixed wine cultures and is famous for its sweet wines. Wine is even grown within the city limits of Vienna – the only European capital where this is true – and some is even produced under the auspices of the city council.

Young wine (i.e., wine produced from grapes of the most recent harvest) is called &quot;Heuriger&quot; and gives its name to inns in Vienna and its surroundings, which serve &quot;Heuriger&quot; wine along with food. In Styria, Carinthia and Burgenland, the &quot;Heuriger&quot; inns are known as &quot;Buschenschanken&quot;.

=== Other alcoholic drinks ===

In Upper Austria, Burgenland, Lower Austria, Styria and Carinthia, &quot;Most&quot;, the fresh juice of grapes or apples is produced, while &quot;Sturm&quot; (&quot;storm&quot;), a semi-fermented grape juice is drunk after the grape harvest. &quot;Most&quot; and &quot;Sturm&quot; are pre-stages of wine.

At the close of a meal, sometimes schnapps (fruit brandy), typically of up to 60% alcohol, is drunk. In Austria schnaps is made from a variety of fruits, for example apricots, rowanberries, gentiana roots, various herbs and even flowers. The produce of small private schnaps distilleries, of which there are around 20,000 in Austria, is known as &quot;Selberbrennter&quot; or &quot;Hausbrand&quot;.

== Snack food ==
For food consumed in between meals there are many types of open sandwiches called &quot;belegte Brote&quot;, or different kinds of sausage with mustard, ketchup and bread, as well as sliced sausage, &quot;Leberkäse&quot; rolls or &quot;Schnitzelsemmeln&quot; (rolls filled with schnitzel).

Traditionally one can get a &quot;Wurstsemmel&quot; (a roll filled, usually, with Extrawurst, a special kind of thinly sliced sausage, often with a slice of cheese and a pickle or cornichon) at a butcher or at the delicatessen counter in a supermarket.

There are also other common yet informal delicacies that are typical of Austrian food. For example, the &quot;Bosna&quot; or Bosner (a spiced bratwurst in a hot dog roll), is an integral part of the menu at Austria&#x27;s typical fast-food restaurant, the sausage stand (Würstelstand). Most Austrian sausages contain pork.

== Regional cuisine ==

=== Lower Austria ===

In Lower Austria, local delicacies such as Waldviertel poppies, Marchfeld asparagus and Wachau apricots are cultivated. Famous are the &quot;Marillenknödel&quot;: small dumplings filled with apricots and warm butter-fried breadcrumbs on it. Their influence can be felt in the local cuisine, for example in poppy seed noodles &quot;Mohnnudeln&quot;. Game dishes are very common. Lower Austria is striking for the differences within its regional cuisine due to its size and the variety of its landscape.

=== Burgenland ===

Burgenland&#x27;s cuisine has been influenced by Hungarian cuisine owing to its former position within the Hungarian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Dishes consist mainly of fish, chicken or pork. Potatoes are the most common side dish, for example, crushed potatoes with onions called &quot;Greste Krumpian&quot; (= Geröstete Kartoffeln, which comes from &quot;geröstet&quot;, meaning &quot;roasted&quot;, and the Hungarian term &quot;krumpli&quot; for potatoes). Because of Hungarian influence, Burgenlandish dishes are often spicier than elsewhere in Austria, often indicated with the terms &quot;Zigeuner...&quot; (&quot;Gypsy&quot;) or &quot;Serbisch...&quot; (&quot;Serbian&quot;). Polenta is a popular side-dish within Burgenland&#x27;s Croatian minority. On St Martin&#x27;s Day (November 11) a &quot;Martinigans&quot; (St Martin&#x27;s goose) is often prepared, and carp is a typical Christmas dish.

=== Styria ===
Styrian taverns where local winemakers serve their new wine, local cold food and homemade cakes are called Buschenschank. They are famous for their Brettljause, a cold hors d&#x27;oeuvre served on a wooden board, typical with &quot;Verhackertes&quot; (a spread made from finely chopped raw white bacon), different types of cold meat (&quot;Gselchtes&quot;: salted and smoked meat, &quot;Schweinsbraten&quot;: roast pork, air-dried sausages, &quot;Speck&quot;: ham) grated horseradish, hard-boiled eggs, meat paste, Liptauer, pumpkin seed spread, vegetables, pickles and cheese with sourdough bread, also &quot;Käferbohnensalat&quot; (runner bean salad) with pumpkin seed oil is typical. Schilcher, a very dry rosé, is the regional style of wine found in Western Styria. A typically Styrian delicacy is pumpkin seed oil, which lends itself particularly to salads on account of its nutty flavour. Many kinds of pumpkin dishes are also very popular. &quot;Heidensterz&quot;, resembling a dry, almost crumbly version of grits made from buckwheat flour, is a local dish enjoyed in cold weather. Especially in autumn, game dishes are very common.

=== Carinthia ===

Carinthia&#x27;s many lakes mean that fish is a popular main course. Grain, dairy produce and meat are important ingredients in Carinthian cuisine. Carinthian &quot;Kasnudeln&quot; (noodle dough pockets filled with quark and mint) and smaller &quot;Schlickkrapfen&quot; (mainly with a meat filling) are well-known local delicacies. &quot;Klachlsuppe&quot; (pig&#x27;s trotter soup) and &quot;Reindling&quot; (yeast-dough pastry/cake filled with a mix of cinnamon, sugar, walnuts and raisins) are also produced locally.

=== Upper Austria ===

Various types of dumplings are an important part of Upper Austrian cuisine, as they are in neighbouring Bavaria and Bohemia. &quot;Linzer Torte&quot;, a cake that includes ground almonds or nuts and redcurrant jam, is a popular dessert from the city of Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. &quot;Linzeraugen&quot; are fine, soft biscuits filled with redcurrant jam called &quot;Ribiselmarmelade&quot;, which has a sharp flavour.

=== Salzburg ===

&quot;Kasnocken&quot; (cheese dumplings) are a popular meal, as are freshwater fish, particularly trout, served in various ways. Salzburger Nockerl (a meringue-like dish) is a well-known local dessert.

=== Tyrol ===

Tyrolean bacon and all sorts of dumplings including &quot;Speckknödel&quot; (dumplings with pieces of bacon) and &quot;Spinatknödel&quot; (made of spinach) are an important part of the local cuisine. Tyrolean cuisine is very simple because in earlier times Tyroleans were not very rich, farming on mountains and in valleys in the middle of the Alpine Region. Tyrolean food often contains milk, cheese, flour and lard.

=== Vorarlberg ===

The cuisine of Vorarlberg has been influenced by the Alemannic cuisine of neighbouring Switzerland and Swabia. Cheese and cheese products play a major role in the cuisine, with &quot;Käsknöpfle&quot; and &quot;Kässpätzle&quot; (egg noodles prepared with cheese) being popular dishes. Other delicacies include &quot;Krautspätzle&quot; (sauerkraut noodles), &quot;Käsdönnala&quot; (similar to a quiche), &quot;Schupfnudla&quot; (made from a dough mixing potato and flour), &quot;Frittatensuppe&quot; (pancake soup), &quot;Öpfelküachle&quot; (apple cake) and &quot;Funkaküachle&quot; (cake traditionally eaten on the first Sunday of Lent).

<text>Philip Lutley Sclater (4 November 1829 – 27 June 1913) was an English lawyer and zoologist. In zoology, he was an expert ornithologist, and identified the main zoogeographic regions of the world. He was Secretary of the Zoological Society of London for 42 years, from 1860 to 1902.

== Early life ==
Sclater was born at Tangier Park, in Wootton St Lawrence, Hampshire, where his father William Lutley Sclater had a country house. George Sclater-Booth, 1st Baron Basing was Philip&#x27;s elder brother. Philip grew up at Hoddington House where he took an early interest in birds. He was educated in school at Twyford and at thirteen went to Winchester College and later Corpus Christi College, Oxford where he studied scientific ornithology under Hugh Edwin Strickland.

In 1851 he began to study law and was admitted a Fellow of Corpus Christi College. In 1856 he travelled to America and visited Lake Superior and the upper St. Croix River, canoeing down it to the Mississippi. Sclater wrote about this in &quot;Illustrated travels&quot;. In Philadelphia he met Spencer Baird, John Cassin and Joseph Leidy at the Academy of Natural Sciences. After returning to England, he practised law for several years and attended meetings of the Zoological Society of London.

== Career ==
In 1858, Sclater published a paper in the &quot;Proceedings of the Linnean Society&quot;, setting up six zoological regions which he called the Palaearctic, Aethiopian, Indian, Australasian, Nearctic, and Neotropical. These zoogeographic regions are still in use. He also developed the theory of Lemuria during 1864 to explain zoological coincidences relating Madagascar to India.

In 1874 he became private secretary to his brother George Sclater-Booth, MP (later Lord Basing). He was offered a permanent position in civil service but he declined. In 1875, he became President of the Biological Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which he joined in 1847 as a member. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1873.

Sclater was the founder and first editor of &quot;The Ibis&quot;, the journal of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union. He was Secretary of the Zoological Society of London from 1860 to 1902. He was briefly succeeded by his son, before the Council of the Society made a long-term appointment.

In 1901 he described the okapi to western scientists although he never saw one alive. His office at 11 Hanover Square became a meeting place for all naturalists in London. Travellers and residents shared notes with him and he corresponded with thousands.

His collection of birds grew to nine thousand and these he transferred to the British Museum in 1886. At around the same time the museum was augmented by the collections of Gould, Salvin and Godman, Hume, and others to become the largest in the world.
Among Sclater&#x27;s more important books were &quot;Exotic Ornithology&quot; (1866–69) and &quot;Nomenclator Avium&quot; (1873), both with Osbert Salvin; &quot;Argentine Ornithology&quot; (1888–89), with W.H. Hudson; and &quot;The Book of Antelopes&quot; (1894–1900) with Oldfield Thomas.

In June 1901 he received an honorary doctorate of Science (D.Sc.) from the University of Oxford.

==Family==
On 16 October 1862 Sclater married Jane Anne Eliza Hunter Blair, daughter of Sir David Hunter-Blair, 3rd Baronet; the couple had a daughter and four sons. Their eldest son, William Lutley Sclater, was also an ornithologist. Their third son, Captain Guy Lutley Sclater, died on 26 November 1914, aged 45, in the accidental explosion that sank HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot;. Philip Sclater is buried in Odiham Cemetery.

*Dusky-billed parrotlet (the name &quot;Psittacula sclateri&quot; Gray, 1859, is currently viewed as a subspecies of &quot;Forpus modestus&quot; Cabanis, 1848).
*Sclater&#x27;s monal (&quot;Lopophorus sclateri&quot;)
*Erect-crested penguin (&quot;Eudyptes sclateri&quot;)
*Ecuadorian cacique (&quot;Cacicus sclateri&quot;)
*Mexican chickadee (&quot;Poecile sclateri&quot;)
*Bay-vented cotinga (&quot;Doliornis sclateri&quot;)
*Sclater&#x27;s antwren (&quot;Myrmotherula sclateri&quot;)
*Sclater&#x27;s lark (&quot;Spizocorys sclateri&quot;)
*Sclater&#x27;s cassowary (&quot;Casuarius sclateri&quot;) ... now usually considered conspecific with the Dwarf Cassowary.
*Colombian longtail snake (&quot;Enuliophis sclateri&quot; )

Although eclipsed by his contemporaries (like Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace), Sclater may be considered as a precursor of biogeography and even pattern cladistics. For instance he writes in 1858 that &quot;...little or no attention is given to the fact that two or more of these given geographical divisions may have much closer relations to each other than to any third ...&quot;.

<text>Gregory Macalister Mathews CBE FRSE FZS FLS (10 September 1876 – 27 March 1949) was an Australian-born amateur ornithologist who spent most of his later life in England.

==Life==

He was born in Biamble in New South Wales the son of Robert H. Mathews. He was educated at The King&#x27;s School, Parramatta.

Mathews made his fortune in mining shares and moved to England in 1902. In 1910, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were William Eagle Clarke, Ramsay Heatley Traquair, John Alexander Harvie-Brown and William Evans.

==Ornithology==

Mathews was a controversial figure in Australian ornithology. He was responsible for bringing trinomial nomenclature into local taxonomy, however he was regarded as an extreme splitter. He recognised large numbers of subspecies on scant evidence and few notes. The extinct Lord Howe Pigeon was described by Mathews in 1915, using a painting as a guide. At the time, he named it &quot;Raperia godmanae&quot; for Alice Mary Godman.

His approach drew a hostile response from Archibald James Campbell, a leading Australian figure in birds at the time. He later began splitting genera. Dominic Serventy foretold that although a great many of these subspecies ceased to be recognised, future research would have to resort to the use of some of them if and when evidence supported their distinct status.

He was Chairman of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Club from 1935 to 1938. He was made CBE in 1939 for his services to ornithology.

Mathews described &quot;M. s. musgravei&quot;, currently recognised as a subspecies of the splendid fairy-wren, in 1922, as a new species of bird.

In 1939, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union and served as its president from 1946–1947. Mathews built up a collection of 30,000 bird skins and a library of 5,000 books on ornithology. He donated his ornithological library to the National Library of Australia in 1939.

In 1939, Matthews donated a small collection of Aboriginal ethnographic items from Australia to the British Museum.

==Family==

He married Mrs Marian Wynne, a widow.

He died in Winchester on 27 March 1949.

==Publications==
Mathews contributed numerous papers to the ornithological literature, especially on avian taxonomy and nomenclature, as well as founding, funding, editing and being the principal contributor to the journal &quot;The Austral Avian Record&quot;. Monographic or book-length works authored or coauthored by him include:
* 1908 – &quot;The Handlist of the Birds of Australia&quot;. (Based on &quot;A Handlist of Birds&quot; by Bowdler Sharpe).

<doc id="592358" wikidata="Q735026" url="?curid=592358" title="Brian Houghton Hodgson">
<text>Brian Houghton Hodgson (1 February 1801 – 23 May 1894) was a pioneer naturalist and ethnologist working in India and Nepal where he was a British Resident. He described numerous species of birds and mammals from the Himalayas, and several birds were named after him by others such as Edward Blyth. He was a scholar of Newar Buddhism and wrote extensively on a range of topics relating to linguistics and religion. He was an opponent of the British proposal to introduce English as the official medium of instruction in Indian schools.

==Early life==

Hodgson was the second of seven children of Brian Hodgson (1766–1858) and his wife Catherine (1776–1851), and was born at Lower Beech, Prestbury, Cheshire. His father lost money in a bad bank investment and had to sell their home at Lower Beech. A great-aunt married to Beilby Porteus, the Bishop of London, helped them but the financial difficulties were great. Hodgson&#x27;s father worked as a warden of the Martello towers and in 1820 was barrack-master at Canterbury. Brian (the son) studied at Macclesfield Grammar School until 1814 and the next two years at Richmond, Surrey under the tutelage of Daniel Delafosse. He was nominated for the Bengal civil service by the East India Company director James Pattison. He went to study at the East India Company College and showed an aptitude for languages. An early influence was Thomas Malthus who was a family friend and a staff member at the college. At the end of his first term in May 1816, he obtained a prize for Bengali. He graduated in December 1817 as a gold medallist.

==India==
At the age of seventeen (1818) he travelled to India as a writer in the British East India Company. His talent for languages such as Sanskrit and especially Persian was to prove useful for his career. He was posted as Assistant Commissioner in the Kumaon region during 1819–20 reporting to George William Traill. The Kumaon region had been annexed from Nepal and in 1820 he was made assistant to the resident in Nepal, but he took up a position of acting deputy secretary in the Persian department of the Foreign office in Calcutta. Ill health made him prefer to go back into the hills of Nepal. He took up position in 1824 as postmaster and later assistant resident in 1825. In January 1833 he became the British Resident at Kathmandu. He continued to suffer from ill health and gave up meat and alcohol in 1837. He studied the Nepalese people, producing a number of papers on their languages, literature and religion. In 1853 he made a brief visit to England and the Netherlands. He married Anne Scott in the British Embassy at the Hague. She died in 1868. In 1870 he married Susan Townshend of Derry. In 1838 he was made Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur by the French government.

==Nepal politics==

Hodgson sensed the resentment of Nepal following annexation of a large part of her lands and believed that the situation could be improved by encouraging commerce with Tibet and by making use of the local manpower in the British military. He initially followed his predecessor in co-operating with Bhimsen Thapa, a minister, but later shifted allegiance to the young King Rajendra and sought to interact directly with the King. Hodgson later supported Bhimsen&#x27;s opponents Rana Jang Pande and Krishna Ram Mishra. In July 1837 King Rajendra&#x27;s infant son was found dead. Bhimsen was suspected and Hodgson recommended that he be held in custody and this led to widespread anti-British sentiment which was used by the King as well as Rana Jang Pande. Hodgson then became sympathetic to the Brahmin family of the Poudyals who were rivals of the Mishras. In 1839, Bhimsen Thapa committed suicide while still in custody. The nobility felt threatened by Rana Jang Pande and there was considerable instability with an army mutiny that threatened even the British Residency. Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of India, wanted to settle the issue but troops had already been mobilised to Afghanistan and Hodgson had to negotiate through diplomacy. Hodgson was then able to set up Krishna Ram and Ranga Nath Poudyal as ministers to the Nepal king. In 1842, Hodgson provided refuge to an Indian merchant Kashinath from Benares who was sought by King Rajendra for recovery of some dues. When the King went to seize Kashinath, Hodgson put a hand around him and declared that the King would have to take both of them prisoner and this led to a clash. Hodgson chose not to inform the new governor-general, Lord Ellenborough, about the incident. Ellenborough&#x27;s letter to Hodgson declared that no Resident would act contrary to the views of Government or extend privileges of British subjects beyond limits assigned to them. Ellenborough sought his removal from Kathmandu.

==Return to England==

Hodgson resigned in 1844 when Lord Ellenborough posted Henry Montgomery Lawrence as Resident to Nepal and transferred Hodgson as Assistant Sub-commissioner to Simla. He then returned to England for a short period. During this time, Lord Ellenborough was himself dismissed. Hodgson visited his sister Fanny who had become Baroness Nahuys and was living in Holland. In 1845 he settled in Darjeeling and continued his studies of the peoples of northern India for thirteen years. Joseph Dalton Hooker visited him during this period and wrote back to Charles Darwin with information obtained from Hodgson on the introduced species and hybrids. Hodgson&#x27;s son Henry was sent to tutor the son-in-law of Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal. In 1857 he influenced Viscount Canning to accept Jung Bahadur Rana&#x27;s help in &#x27;suppressing&#x27; the Indian Rebellion of 1857. In the summer of 1858, he returned to England and would not visit India again. He lived initially at Dursley in Gloucestershire but in 1867 moved to Alderley in the Cotswolds.

==Ethnology and anthropology==
During his posting in Nepal, Hodgson became proficient in Nepali and Newari. Hodgson was financially pressed until 1837, but he maintained a group of research assistants at his expense. He collected Buddhist texts in Sanskrit and Pali and studied them with his friend Pandit Amritananda. He believed that there were four schools of Buddhism and wrongly assumed that the Sanskrit texts were older than those in Pali. He however became an expert on Hinayana philosophy. Hodgson had a keen interest in the culture of the people of the Himalayan regions. He believed that racial affinities could be identified on the basis of linguistics and he was influenced by the works of William Jones, Friedrich Schlegel, Johann Blumenbach and Jame Prichard. From his studies he believed that the &#x27;Aboriginal&#x27; populations of the Himalayas were not &#x27;Aryans&#x27; or &#x27;Caucasians&#x27;, but the &#x27;Tamulian&#x27;, who he claimed were unique to India. Hodgson obtained copies of ancient Buddhist texts, the Kahgyur and the Stangyur. One copy was gifted to him by the Grand Lama. These were rare Tibetan works based on old Sanskrit writings (brought originally from the area of the Buddha&#x27;s personal teachings in Magadha or Bihar in India) and he was able to offer them to the Asiatic Society and the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland in 1838. The Russian government purchased part of the same book for £2000 around the same time.

In 1837 Hodgson collected the first Sanskrit text of the Lotus Sutra and sent it to translator Eugène Burnouf of the Collége de France, Paris.

==Educational reform==
During his service in India, Hodgson was a strong proponent of education in the local languages and opposed both the use of English as a medium of instruction as advocated by Lord Macaulay as well as the orientalist view that supported the use of Arabic, Persian or Sanskrit. From 1835 to 1839, Hodgson, William Adam, Frederick Shore and William Campbell wrote against Macaulay&#x27;s idea of education in the English medium. Hodgson wrote a series of essays for the journal of the Serampore Mission &quot;The Friend of India&quot; that argued for the education in the vernacular. The essays were republished in 1880 in his &quot;Miscellaneous Essays Relating to Indian Subjects&quot;.
==Ornithology and natural history==

Hodgson studied all aspects of natural history around him including material from Nepal, Sikkim and Bengal. He amassed a large collection of birds and mammal skins which he later donated to the British Museum. As a result of an order by the Nepalese court he was unable to travel outside Kathmandu while living there and he therefore employed local hunters to collect his specimens for him. He described a species of antelope which was named after him, the Tibetan Antelope &quot;Pantholops hodgsonii&quot;. He also described the pygmy hog which he gave the scientific name of &quot;Porcula salvania&quot;, the species name derived from the Sal forest (&quot;van&quot; in Sanskrit) habitat where it was found. He also discovered 39 species of mammals and 124 species of birds which had not been described previously, 79 of the bird species were described himself. The zoological collections presented to the British Museum by Hodgson in 1843 and 1858 contained 10,499 specimens. In addition to these, the collection also included an enormous number of drawings and coloured sketches of Indian animals by three native artists under his supervision. These sketches include anatomical details and Hodgson may have learned dissection and anatomy from Archibald Campbell. One of them was Raj Man Singh, but many of the paintings are unsigned. Most of them were subsequently transferred to the Zoological Society of London and the Natural History Museum.

His studies were recognised and the Royal Asiatic Society made him a member in 1828 and the Linnean Society of London elected him as a fellow in 1835. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1877. The Zoological Society of London sent him their diploma as a corresponding member. The Société Asiatique de Paris and the Museum d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle also honoured him. Around 1837 he planned an illustrated work on the birds and mammals of Nepal. The Museum d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle de Paris and other learned bodies came forward as supporters, three hundred and thirty subscribers registered in India, and in July 1837 he was able to write to his father that the means of publication were secured: &quot;I make sure of three hundred and fifty to four hundred subscribers, and if we say 10 per copy of the work, this list should cover all expenses. Granted my first drawings were stiff and bad, but the new series may challenge comparison with any in existence.&quot; He hoped to finish the work in 1840.

In 1845, he presented 259 bird skins to the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle upon Tyne.

After retiring to Darjeeling he took a renewed interest in natural history. During the spring of 1848 he was visited by Sir Joseph Hooker. He wrote to his sister Fanny:

He wrote in 1849 on the physical geography of the Himalayan region, looking at the patterns of river-flows, the distributions and affinities of various species of mammals, birds and plants while also looking at the origins of the people inhabiting different regions.

Allan Octavian Hume said of him:
Many birds of the Himalayan region were first formally described and given a binomial name by Hodgson. The list of world birds maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee credits Hodgson as the authority for 29 genera and 77 species.

Charles Darwin in his &quot;Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication&quot;, when discussing the origin of the domestic dog, mentions that Hodgson succeeded in taming the young of the race &quot;primaevus&quot; of the dhole or Indian wild dog (&quot;Cuon alpinus&quot;), and in making them as fond of him and as intelligent as ordinary dogs. Darwin also cited a 1847 article by Hodgson on the varieties of sheep and goats in the Himalayas.

==Personal life and death==

In 1839 he wrote to his sister Fanny that he did not eat meat or drink wine and preferred Indian food habits after his ill health in 1837. Due to his strict vegetarian diet he required the nickname &quot;Hermit of the Himalayas&quot;.

During his life in India, Hodgson fathered two children (Henry, who died in Darjeeling in 1856, and Sarah, who died in Holland in 1851; a third child possibly died young) with a Kashmiri (possibly, although recorded as a &quot;Newari&quot;) Muslim woman, Mehrunnisha, who lived with him from 1830 until her death around 1843. Worried about the abuse and discrimination in India of &#x27;mixed-race&#x27; children, he had his children sent to Holland to live with his sister Fanny, but both died young. He married Anne Scott in 1853 who lived in Darjeeling until her death in January 1868. He moved to England in 1858 and lived at Dursley, Gloucestershire, and then at Alderley (1867, where his neighbours included Marianne North). In 1869 he married Susan, daughter of Rev. Chambré Townshend of Derry, who outlived him. He had no children from his marriages. He died at his home on Dover Street in London on 23 May 1894 and was buried at Alderley churchyard in Gloucestershire.

Hodgson refers to the ornithologist Samuel Tickell as his brother-in-law. Tickell&#x27;s sister Mary Rosa was married to Brian&#x27;s brother William Edward John Hodgson (1805 – 12 June 1838). Mary returned to England after the death of William Hodgson and married Lumisden Strange in February 1840.

==Honours==
Hodgson was awarded the DCL, &quot;honoris causa&quot; by Oxford University in 1889. His friend Joseph Hooker named the genus &quot;Hodgsonia&quot; (Cucurbitaceae), &quot;Magnolia hodgsonii&quot;, and a species of rhododendron, &quot;Rhododendron hodgsoni&quot;, after him. Several species of bird including Hodgson&#x27;s hawk-eagle, Hodgson&#x27;s hawk-cuckoo, Hodgson&#x27;s bushchat, Hodgson&#x27;s redstart, Hodgson&#x27;s frogmouth and Hodgson&#x27;s treecreeper are named after him. Other animals named after him include the Hodgson&#x27;s bat, Hodgson&#x27;s giant flying squirrel, Hodgson&#x27;s brown-toothed shrew and Hodgson&#x27;s rat snake.

He is commemorated in the scientific name of the snake species &quot;Elaphe hodgsoni&quot; (synonyms: &quot;Gonyosoma hodgsoni&quot;, &quot;Orthriophis hodgsoni)&quot; and the plant genus &quot;Hodgsonia&quot; Hook.f. &amp; Thomson (1854) (Cucurbitaceae).

<doc id="592359" wikidata="Q1182666" url="?curid=592359" title="Defiance Campaign">
<text>The Defiance Campaign against Unjust Laws was presented by the African National Congress (ANC) at a conference held in Bloemfontein, South Africa in December 1951. The Campaign had roots in events leading up the conference. The demonstrations, taking place in 1952, were the first &quot;large-scale, multi-racial political mobilization against apartheid laws under a common leadership&quot;.

== Background ==
In 1948, the National Party (NP) won the election in South Africa and began to impose apartheid measures against Black people, Indians and any people of mixed race. The NP restricted political power to white people only and allocated areas of South Africa for different races of people. Workers, trade unionists and others spoke out on 6 October 1949 against these apartheid measures and began to discuss a possible political strike. In December of that year, leaders in the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL), such as Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo, took power. The African National Congress (ANC) also &quot;adopts the Programme of Action&quot; on 17 December, which advocated a more militant approach to protesting apartheid.

In 1950, the ANC started promoting demonstrations, mass action, boycotts, strikes and acts of civil disobedience. During this time, 8,000 black people were arrested &quot;for defying apartheid laws and regulations&quot;. The South African Indian Congress (SAIC) worked in partnership with the ANC. The NP used the Population Registration Act to ensure that individuals were permanently classified by race and only allowed to live in areas specified by the Group Areas Act. On 26 June 1950, the National Day of Protest took place. The ANC asked that people not go to work as an act of protest. As a result of the protest, many people lost their jobs and the ANC set up a fund to help them.

== The Campaign ==
The Defiance Campaign was launched on 26 June 1952, the date that became the yearly National Day of Protest and Mourning. The South African police were alerted about the action and were armed and prepared. In major South African cities, people and organizations performed acts of defiance and civil disobedience. The protests were largely non-violent on the parts of the participants, many of whom wore tri-color armbands signifying the ANC. Black volunteers burned their pass books. Other black volunteers would go into places that were considered &quot;whites-only,&quot; which was then against the law. These volunteers were arrested, with the most arrests (over 2,000 people) being made in October 1952. When protesters were arrested, they would not defend themselves in court, &quot;leading to large-scale imprisonment&quot;. Others who were offered fines as an alternative choice to go to prison. The mass imprisonment, it was hoped, would overwhelm the government.

The South African government labelled the protests as acts of anarchy, communism and disorder. The Nationalist newspaper, the &quot;Oosterlig&quot;, wrote that the protesters &quot;find prison a pleasant abode. These people only understand the lash.&quot; Police often used batons to force protesters to submit. On 9 November 1952, police fired on a group of black protesters in Kimberley killing 14 and injuring 39. Other orders to shoot demonstrators &quot;on sight&quot; were issued by the South African Minister of Justice, Charles Swart. Arrests of peaceful protestors &quot;disgusted a section of white public opinion&quot;. In July 1952, there were raids of ANC and SAIC offices.

As a result of the protests, the NP started &quot;imposing stiff penalties for protesting discriminatory laws&quot; and then they created the Public Safety Act. The goals of the Defiance Campaign were not met, but the protests &quot;demonstrated large-scale and growing opposition to apartheid&quot;. The United Nations took note and called the apartheid policy a &quot;threat to peace&quot;.

In the middle of April 1953, Chief Albert Luthuli, the President-General of the ANC, proclaimed that the Defiance Campaign would be called off so that the resistance groups could reorganize taking into consideration the new political climate in South Africa.

The Defiance Campaigns, including bus boycotts in South Africa, served as an inspiration to Civil Rights Activists in the United States. Albert Luthuli was tried for treason, was assaulted and deposed of his chieftaincy of his Zulu clan. Mandela took over the ANC after Luthuli.

Apartheid was finally ended in the early 1990s, as marked by the 1994 South African general election, the first South African election held using universal adult suffrage.

==Defiance Campaign in Port Elizabeth==
The Red Location is one of the oldest settled black townships of Port Elizabeth, Nelson Mandela Bay, South Africa. It derives its name from a cluster of corrugated iron barrack buildings, which are rusted a deep red colour. The Red Location consisted of three different locations namely the Gubbs Location, Coopers Kloof and Strangers Location. These locations were overcrowded and not in good condition.

On 26 July 1952, Florence Matomela joined many others in a Defiance Campaign against the Apartheid pass laws at the New Brighton Railway Station which also included Govan Mbeki, Raymond Mhlaba and Vuyisile Mini and other men. She was one of the first women arrested.

Key role players of this Defiance Campaign included:

===Nosipho Dastile===
Nosipho Dastile (1938–2009) was a well known political figure and founder of the United Democratic Front. She was the first president of the Uitenhage Women&#x27;s Organisation and was the chairperson of the ANC Women&#x27;s League in Uitenhage, after the unbanning of liberation movements in the 1990s.

===Lilian Diedericks===
Lillian Diedericks (1925–2021) was born in Port Elizabeth near the railway line in Red Location.

She was an active shop steward and founding member of the Federation of South African Women in 1954. Her family was forced out of New Brighton during the 1940s. She was also one of the four women who led the Women&#x27;s March on the Union buildings to oppose the pass laws in 1956.

===Nontuthuzelo Mabala===
Nontuthuzelo Mabala marched against the pass laws in 1956. She was jailed at the age of 24 for six years for the role she played in the struggle against Apartheid.

===Florence Matomela===

Florence Matomela (1910–1969) was a South African anti-pass law activist, communist, civil rights campaigner, ANC veteran, teacher and mother who dedicated her life to fighting against Apartheid laws in South Africa. Matomela was the provincial organiser of the African National Congress Women&#x27;s League (ANCWL) and vice-president of the Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW) in the mid 1950s.

===Veronica Sobukwe===

Veronica Sobukwe (27 July 1927 – 15 August 2018), spouse of Robert Sobukwe, played an integral role in the Defiance Campaign. Her family was constantly harassed by the police.

===Honours===
The ANC&#x27;s Regional Headquarters in Nelson Mandela Bay was renamed Florence Matomela House in November 2012. Angie Motshekga, the Minister of Basic Education and President of the ANC Women&#x27;s League, described Florence Matomela in the Florence Mathomela Memorial Lecture as having battled the &#x27;triple oppression&#x27; of colonial, patriarchal and class domination. The Red Location Museum in New Brighton held a year-long exhibition dedicated to these women of the liberation struggle, by paying tribute to Florence Matomela, Nontuthuzelo Mabala, Veronica Sobukwe, Lilian Diedricks and Nosipho Dastile.

<doc id="592365" wikidata="Q1622710" url="?curid=592365" title="Hodgson">
<text>Hodgson is a surname. In Britain, the Hodgson surname was the 173rd most common (766 per million) in 1881 and the 206th most common (650 per million) in 1998. In the United States of America, Hodgson was the 3753rd most popular surname (30 per million) in the 1990 census.

==Origin and meaning==
Hodgson is a patronymic surname, thought by some to mean &quot;son of Hodge&quot;, with Hodge being a Middle English personal name usually representing a pet-form of the name Roger. However, Geoffrey Hodgson shows that both distribution of the name and DNA suggest a Norse-Irish origin, making “son of Oddgeir” a more likely derivation.

==Variants==
The Hodson surname is less common and generally derives from Hodgson. Other probable variants of Hodgson include Hodgeson, Hodgshon, Hodshon, Hodgin, Hodgins, Hodgen, Hodgens, Hodghson, Hodgon and Hodgeon. In the North of England the &quot;s&quot; is often silent in the pronunciation of Hodgson. This accounts for variants such as Hodgin, Hodgen, Hodgon and Hodgeon.

==Coat of arms==
The Hodgsons of Hebburn, a mine-owning Catholic family living in the North East of England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (Surtees 1820, vol. 2, pp. 77, 319, James 1974, Hodgson 2008), bore a heraldic coat of arms, blazoned as &quot;per chevron, embattled or and azure, three martlets counterchanged&quot;. This same coat of arms is associated with several other Hodgson families, including the Hodgsons of West Keal in Lincolnshire, the Hodgsons of Bascodyke in Cumberland (Hodgson 1925), the Hodshons of Amsterdam, and with Thomas Hodgson (1738–1817) a Liverpool merchant and slave trader, and the owner of a mill in Caton, Lancashire (Hodgson 2008).

==Border Reivers and Hodgson clans==
For centuries before James VI&#x27;s assentation to the throne of England (Union of the Crowns), the remote Anglo-Scottish borderland region had been the lair of unruly clans and gangs of robbers that were largely beyond the reach of the law. A peculiar form of clan organisation grew up in this area. This was the land of the Border Reivers. These clans had a legal system distinct from that of the majority of England and Scotland (Robb 2018). The suppression of this legal system led to a generalised breakdown of Reiver society (Robb 2018). They would steal goods, cattle and women from across the nominal border.

Some Hodgsons in Cumberland were themselves a clan organisation (Fraser 1971). The border clans were eventually subjected by state authorities. Many were forced or obliged to emigrate to North America in the 18th century (Fischer 1989). Many Hodgsons emigrated in this period.

<doc id="592366" wikidata="Q4786261" url="?curid=592366" title="Archibald Campbell Jordan">
<text>Archibald Campbell Mzolisa &quot;A.C.&quot; Jordan (30 October 1906 – 20 October 1968) was a novelist, literary historian and intellectual pioneer of African studies in South Africa.

==Early life==
He was born at the Mbokothwane Mission in the Tsolo district, Pondoland (later Transkei), the son of an Anglican church minister. Jordan trained as a teacher at St John&#x27;s College, Mthatha, completed his junior certificate at Lovedale College, Alice, and then won a scholarship to Fort Hare University College. His literary and linguistic training consisted in a BA Degree (1934), followed by a Master&#x27;s thesis, submitted to the University of Cape Town (UCT) in 1942, entitled &quot;Some features of the phonetic and grammatical structure of Baca&quot; (Bhaca), which was an important early contribution to the study of non-standard Nguni languages, specifically, of a Tekela Nguni language. This was followed in 1957 by a doctoral degree dissertation &quot;A Phonological and Grammatical Study of Literary Xhosa.

==Writing career==
While teaching in Kroonstad (in the then Orange Free State Province) between 1934 and 1944 Jordan mastered Sotho, became president of the African Teachers&#x27; Association, and started his writing career with the publication of poetry in the newspaper &quot;Imvo Zabantsundu&quot;. He also started work on his classic Xhosa novel, &quot;Ingqumbo Yeminyanya&quot; (1940), later translated by the author and his wife, Phyllis Ntantala-Jordan, into English as &quot;The Wrath of the Ancestors&quot; (1980). This novel, considered as one of the masterpieces of Xhosa writing and South African literature, was translated into Afrikaans as &quot;Die Toorn van die Voorvaders&quot;, published in 1990, and a Dutch translation, &quot;De Wraak van het Voorgeslacht&quot;, appearing in the classic African Writers Series in the Netherlands in 1999. The novel tells a gripping epic-tragic tale of the conflicting forces of Western education and Xhosa traditional beliefs amongst the &quot;School people&quot; and the &quot;Ochre people&quot; of the Mpondomise people.

After a brief stint as senior lecturer in Bantu languages at the Fort Hare University College, beginning 1944, Jordan was appointed senior lecturer in African languages at the University of Cape Town (UCT) in 1946. He worked in that capacity until September 1961.

While at UCT he began a new method of teaching Xhosa to non-mother tongue speakers, which he published as &quot;A Practical Course in Xhosa&quot; (1966).

In 1961 Jordan was offered a Carnegie bursary to do research in the United States, but was refused a passport by the South African government. As a result of political pressure, Jordan was forced to leave South Africa on an exit permit. He settled in America where he was appointed professor in African Languages and Literature at the University of California, Los Angeles, and later moved, in similar capacity, to the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In 1968, Jordan died in Madison, after a long illness.

One eminent South African scholar who studied Xhosa under Jordan&#x27;s guidance was the writer and academic, Vernon February. Decades later he still testified to the enormous influence Jordan had on those students, and the inspiring and vital knowledge he imparted about Xhosa culture and language. Similarly, Carol Eastman recounted, in Johannesburg, at the &quot;Sociolinguistics in Africa&quot; conference organised by Bob Herbert, her inspiration for African culture and language instilled by Jordan when he taught her Xhosa at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 1960s. She said there was a &quot;quiet sadness&quot; about Jordan, living as he was in exile, very far from home.

Jordan&#x27;s other important publications include a book of short stories entitled &quot;Kwezo Mpindo zeTsitsa&quot;, published in 1973 as &quot;Tales from Southern Africa&quot;, and an important pioneering critical study, entitled &quot;Towards an African Literature: The Emergence of Literary Form in Xhosa&quot; (1972).

== Legacy ==
For his creative works, his pioneering research and his sustained efforts at preserving and recording in his writing the culture and history of the Xhosa people of the Eastern Cape, the University of Port Elizabeth currently known as Nelson Mandela University (NMU) posthumously bestowed on Jordan an honorary doctorate in literature, on 24 April 2004. 

He was awarded posthumously the Order of Ikhamanga in Gold in 2005.

In 2015 the University of Cape Town renamed the Arts Block after Jordan in recognition of his work.

<text>&quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale&quot; is one of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer. In the order of the Tales, it comes after The Physician&#x27;s Tale and before The Shipman&#x27;s Tale; it is prompted by the Host&#x27;s desire to hear something positive after the physician&#x27;s depressing tale. The initiates his Prologue—briefly accounting his methods of swindling people—and then proceeds to tell a moral tale.

The tale itself is an extended exemplum. Setting out to kill Death, three young men encounter an Old Man who says they will find him under a nearby tree. When they arrive they discover a hoard of treasure and decide to stay with it until nightfall and carry it away under the cover of night. Out of greed, they murder one another. The tale and prologue are primarily concerned with what the Pardoner says is his &quot;theme&quot;: &quot;Radix malorum est cupiditas&quot; (&quot;Greed is the root of [all] evils&quot;).

==Frame==
In the order of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, the Pardoner&#x27;s Prologue and Tale are preceded by &quot;The Physician&#x27;s Tale&quot;. This is a harrowing tale about a judge who plots with a &quot;churl [low fellow]&quot; to abduct a beautiful young woman. Rather than allow her to be raped, her father beheads her. The invitation for the Pardoner to tell a tale comes after the Host declares his dissatisfaction with the depressing tale, and declares:
The Host then asks the Pardoner to &quot;telle us som myrthe or japes [joke, jest] right anon&quot;. However, the pilgrims—aware of pardoners&#x27; notoriety for telling lewd tales and in anticipation of hearing something objectionable—voice their desire for no ribaldry, but instead want a moral tale.

==Synopsis==

===Prologue===
The prologue takes the form of a literary confession in the same manner as The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Prologue. However, rather than an apology for his vices, the Pardoner boasts of his duping of his victims, for whom he has nothing but contempt. He says that his &quot;theme&quot;—biblical text for a sermon—is (&quot;Greed is the root of [all] evils&quot;, 1 Timothy 6.10). He explains that his false credentials consist of official letters from high-ranking church officials and a superficial use of a few Latin words; then he will produce some &quot;relics&quot;, and claim that among them is a bone which has miraculous powers when dipped into a well and a for which:

But he will warn that any person that &quot;hath doon synne horrible&quot; will not be able to benefit from these relics. The Pardoner says to the pilgrims that by these tricks he has acquired a considerable sum of money of a hundred marks (£66 13s. 4d., about ten times the salary of the average schoolmaster) a year. He goes on to relate how he stands like a cleric at the pulpit, and preaches against avarice only to gain the congregation&#x27;s money; he does not care for the correction of sin or for their souls. Against anyone that offends either him or other pardoners, he will &quot;stynge hym with my tonge smerte&quot;. Although he is guilty of avarice himself, he reiterates that his theme is always &quot;Radix malorum ...&quot; and that he can nonetheless preach so that others turn away from the vice and repent—though his &quot;principal entente&quot; is for personal gain. The Pardoner explains that he then offers many anecdotes to the &quot;lewed [ignorant, unlearned] people&quot;.; from long experience he can tell who are the worst sinners (because of their guilty expressions) and thus who are most eager buyers of his fake relics. He scorns the thought of living in poverty while he preaches; he desires &quot;moneie, wolle [wool], chese, and whete&quot; and does not care whether it were from the poorest widow in the village, even should her children starve for famine. Yet, he concludes to the pilgrims, though he may be a &quot;ful vicious man&quot;, he can tell a moral tale and proceeds.

===Tale===
The tale is set in Flanders at an indeterminate time, and opens with three young men who spend their time patronizing brothels and taverns while playing at eating, drinking, rioting, and gambling; this day they are engaged in blaspheming in a tavern. The Pardoner condemns each of these &quot;tavern sins&quot; in turn—gluttony, drinking, gambling, and swearing—with support from the Christian scriptures, before proceeding with the tale. The rioters hear a bell signalling a burial; upon inquiry they are told the funeral is that of an old drinking friend of theirs who the night before has been killed by a &quot;privee theef&quot; known as Death, who has also killed a thousand others in a nearby community. The men set out to avenge their friend and kill Death. An ancient man they brusquely query tells them that he has asked Death to take him but has failed (no one wishes to trade their youth for his great age). He then says they can find Death at the foot of an oak tree and also warns them &quot;God save you, Who redeemed all humankind, And mend your ways!&quot;. When the men arrive at the tree, they find a large hoard of nine bushels of gold florins coins and forget about their quest to kill Death. They decide to take the coins to their homes at night for if any see them with the treasure by day, they would be accused of robbery and hanged. The three men draw straws to see who among them should fetch wine and food while the other two wait under the tree. The youngest of the three men draws the shortest straw and departs; while he is away, the remaining two plot to overpower and both stab him upon his return. However, the one who leaves for town plots to kill the other two to keep the treasure all for himself and does not repent: he purchases rat poison and laces the wine. When he returns with the food and drink, the other two kill him and then consume the poisoned wine, dying slow and painful deaths.

Having completed his tale, the Pardoner—forgetful of his remarks during the prologue—falls into the habit of appealing [to an audience] for gold and silver so that the pilgrims may receive pardons for their sins. The Host responds that he would sooner castrate the Pardoner than kiss his relics. At this point the Knight intervenes and urges them to make peace.

==Sources and composition==
The prologue—taking the form of a literary confession—was most probably modelled on that of &quot;Faus Semblaunt&quot; in the medieval French poem &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot;. The tale of the three rioters is a version of a folk tale with a &quot;remarkably wide range&quot; and has numerous analogues: ancient Buddhist, Persian, and African. The Dove&#x27;s tale from Night 152 of the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; about the wealthy merchant from Sindah and the two swindlers who poison one another is also very similar to this story.

==Analysis==
The relationship between tellers and tale is distinctly significant in &quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The Pardoner is an enigmatic character, portrayed as grotesque in the General Prologue. He is seemingly aware of his sin – it is not clear why he tells the pilgrims about his sin in the prologue before his tale commences. His preaching is correct and the results of his methods, despite their corruption, are good. The Pardoner&#x27;s confession is similar to that of the Wife of Bath in that there is a revelation of details buried within the prologue.

Chaucer describes the Pardoner as an excellent speaker in his portrait of the character in the General Prologue to &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, which inherently reflects the quality of the narrative attributed to him.

The old man who appears before the rioters has been the subject of considerable debate. Many people and scholars reference him as &quot;death in person&quot;, &quot;the Wandering Jew&quot;, &quot;Old Age itself&quot;, and &quot;Death&#x27;s messenger&quot;. W. J. B. Owen points out that &quot;He is seeking Death; and that Death or his agent should find death is contrary to all the logic of allegory.&quot; Owen argues that a character is merely an old man and not a symbol of mortality.

The Old Man in &quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale&quot; is often written off as one who does not provide any sort of substance to the play. However, critic Alfred David denies such claims and asserts the possibility that the Old Man in &quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale&quot; is meant to symbolise more than unambiguous death, &quot;the old man&#x27;s identity does not admit a simple, unambiguous, and definitive answer such as Death or Death&#x27;s Messenger&quot;. David goes on to assert that the Old Man may actually symbolise the &quot;Wandering Jew&quot; as defined to be a symbol of death that will supposedly roam the Earth until the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. One may compare this notion to the symbol and character of the Old Man in &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
&quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale&quot; finds itself widely debated among those in the literary world. The question of Chaucer&#x27;s motivation in writing the tale, as well as potential social comments made within it, have been the subject of controversy. Gregory W. Gross in &quot;Modern Language Studies&quot; concludes that The Pardoner finds himself publicly shamed by the Host&#x27;s reprimand at the end of the tale. There is an &quot;undertone&quot; of exclusion at this point in the work that, perhaps, leads to the question of the sexuality of The Pardoner and the social boundaries at hand. To reaffirm his claim, Gross points out the ridicule and &quot;laughter&quot; on behalf of the other pilgrims. Perhaps Chaucer is looking upon the Pardoner with a &quot;compassionate eye&quot;, as the Host offers a kiss at the end of the tale. According to Gross, this could simply be the poet&#x27;s way of easing the tension in the room, thus a sign of &quot;compassion&quot; towards the embarrassment of the Pardoner on behalf of the poet. Ultimately, it is plausible that Chaucer makes a societal statement long before his time that serves as a literary teaching moment in modern time.

In further analysis, psychological patterns of the character of the Pardoner are frequently analysed by readers and critics alike. In 1961, critic Eric W. Stockton defined the psychology-based research of the character, &quot;The psychology of the Pardoner has perhaps gotten in the way of the task of interpreting the stories&#x27; meaning. This is indeed an age of psychology.&quot; As Stockton states, the character has largely been overanalysed, especially amidst mid-century advances in psychoanalysis in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Character of the teller==
The religious climate at the time that Chaucer wrote this piece was pre-Reformation. Therefore, the Sacraments were still largely considered, as explained by St. Augustine, &quot;outward and visible s of an inward and invisible grace&quot;. The suggestion that outward appearances are reliable indicators of internal character was not considered radical or improper among contemporary audiences. Indeed, the vivid depiction of the Pardoner&#x27;s hair, those locks &quot;yellow as wax But smoothe as a strike of flex &quot;, does little to improve the reader&#x27;s opinion of his moral character.

Chaucer develops his description and analysis of the Pardoner throughout &quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale&quot; using suggestive analogies that provide the reader with the perception of a man of extreme sexual and spiritual poverty, willingly admitting that he abuses his authority and sells fake relics. &quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale&quot; matches the unctuous nature of the Pardoner in many ways. Eugene Vance illustrates one parallel effectively fostered by Chaucer&#x27;s sexual innuendos. He writes: &quot;The kneeling posture to which the Pardoner summons the pilgrims would place their noses right before his deficient crotch.&quot;

In addition, Vance expands upon this comparison, identifying a sexual innuendo implicit in the Pardoner&#x27;s many relics. &quot;The pardoner conspires to set himself up as a moveable shrine endowed with relics unsurpassed by those of anyone else in England.&quot; Yet, of course, the relics are all fakes, creating a suggestion of both the Pardoner&#x27;s impotence and his spiritual ill-worth.

==General themes==
Though the Pardoner preaches against greed, the irony of the character is based in the Pardoner&#x27;s hypocritical actions. He admits extortion of the poor, pocketing of indulgences, and failure to abide by teachings against jealousy and avarice. He also admits quite openly that he tricks the most guilty sinners into buying his spurious relics and does not really care what happens to the souls of those he has swindled.

The Pardoner is also deceptive in how he carries out his job. Instead of selling genuine relics, the bones he carries belong to pigs, not departed saints. The cross he carries appears to be studded with precious stones that are, in fact, bits of common metal. This irony could be an indication to Chaucer&#x27;s dislike for religious profit—a pervasive late medieval theme hinging on anti-clericalism. Chaucer&#x27;s use of subtle literary techniques, such as satire, seem to convey this message.

However, the Pardoner might also be seen as a reinforcement of the Apostolic Authority of the priesthood, which, according to the Catholic Church, functions fully even when the one possessing that authority is in a state of mortal sin, which in this case is supported by how the corrupt Pardoner is able to tell a morally intact tale and turn others from his same sin. Thomas Aquinas, an influential theologian of the late medieval period, had a philosophy concerning how God was able to work through evil people and deeds to accomplish good ends. Chaucer may have also been referencing a doctrine of St. Augustine of Hippo concerning the Donatist heresy of fourth and fifth century Northern Africa in which Augustine argued that a priest&#x27;s ability to perform valid sacraments was not invalidated by his own sin. Thus, it is possible that with the Pardoner, Chaucer was criticising the administrative and economic practices of the Church while simultaneously affirming his support for its religious authority and dogma.

In the General Prologue of the Tales, the Pardoner is introduced with these lines:

&lt;poem&gt;
With hym ther rood a gentil Pardoner
Of Rouncivale, his freend and his compeer,
That streight was comen fro the court of Rome.
Ful loude he soong &quot;Com hider, love, to me!&quot;
This Somonour bar to hym a stif burdoun ...
A voys he hadde as smal as hath a goot.
No berd hadde he, ne nevere sholde have;
As smothe it was as it were late shave.
I trowe he were a geldyng or a mare.&lt;/poem&gt;

The last three lines indicate that the narrator thought the Pardoner to be either a eunuch (&quot;geldyng&quot;) or a homosexual.

<text>Towel Day is celebrated every year on 25 May as a tribute to the author Douglas Adams by his fans. On this day, fans openly carry a towel with them, as described in Adams&#x27; &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, to demonstrate their appreciation for the books and the author. The commemoration was first held 25 May 2001, two weeks after Adams&#x27; death on 11 May.

== Origin ==
The importance of the towel was introduced in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; original radio series in 1978. The follow-up book explained the importance of towels in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; universe in Chapter 3, using much of the same wording as the original radio series:

The original article that began Towel Day was posted by a D. Clyde Williamson, a contributor at &quot;System Toolbox&quot;, a short-lived System Administration website affiliated with &quot;Binary Freedom&quot;, an open source forum. To promote the group&#x27;s proposed memorial event, System Toolbox&#x27;s site director, Chris Campbell, created the towelday.org website. The idea was shared by Slashdot in a post that reminded people to bring their towels on May 25. Towel Day was an immediate success among fans and many people sent in pictures of themselves with their towels. Campbell ran the Towel Day website for several years before transferring it. It is now maintained by an anonymous group of Douglas Adams&#x27; fans.

== Recognition ==

Several news sources around the world have mentioned Towel Day, including the Norwegian newspaper &quot;Aftenposten&quot; and the television news show &quot;NRK Nyheter&quot;, and National Public Radio, Los Angeles.

In May 2010, an online petition was created asking Google to recognize Towel Day with either a Google Doodle or by returning search results in the Vogon language for a day. As of 10 September 2014, the petition had received 5,373 signatures; however, the petition website is now defunct. On 11 March 2013, Google published an official Doodle in recognition of what would have been Douglas Adams’ 61st birthday.

=== 2010 ===
In Canada, &quot;Volt&quot;, a French/English television show, created a skit in which Towel Day was explained and featured.

In Ecuador, Radio City, a BBC affiliated radio station, interviewed one of the organizers of Towel Day in Toronto to introduce their listeners to Towel Day. The interview was in Spanish and English.

=== 2011 ===
In the United Kingdom, Planet Rock aired an &quot;Alternative Thought Of The Day&quot; by David Haddock about Towel Day and Siren FM broadcast &quot;Dean Wilkinson &amp; the Importance of International Towel Day&quot;.

=== 2012 ===
In January 2012, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; listed Towel Day as one of ten cult literary traditions.

=== 2013 ===
In recognition of Towel Day, the Norwegian public transportation company Kolumbus gave away a limited number of special towels to customers. Each towel contained an RFID chip that allows a free ride on their buses and boats. In Washington, D.C., the Chevy Chase branch of the District of Columbia Public Library offered prizes for those who wore a towel to the library on Towel Day.

=== 2015 ===

On Towel Day 2015, Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti sent a &quot;Towel Day greeting&quot; and read aloud a sample from &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide To The Galaxy&quot; from the International Space Station.

=== 2016 ===
Towel Day was celebrated by Briton Tim Peake on the International Space Station.

As Towel Day 2016 fell during the RIPE 72 meeting, the RIPE NCC distributed a beach towel printed with an IPv6 subnet chart (from their training materials).

=== 2018 ===
The first SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket launch used a Tesla Roadster as a test payload, emblazoned with the words &quot;DON&#x27;T PANIC!&quot;, a reference to the phrase from &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. In the glove compartment of the car was a copy of the book and a towel.

=== 2019 ===
In the year 2019, Towel Day was celebrated by Don&#x27;t Panic Labs in Nebraska, U.S., by organizing a donation drive called the &quot;Towel Day Drive&quot; where people were asked to donate new or extremely gently used towels to the &quot;People&#x27;s City Mission&quot;. Many people also donated money to buy towels.

<doc id="592371" wikidata="Q2342500" url="?curid=592371" title="DVD+R DL">
<text>DVD+R DL (DL stands for Double Layer) also called DVD+R9, is a derivative of the DVD+R format created by the DVD+RW Alliance. Its use was first demonstrated in October 2003. DVD+R DL discs employ two recordable dye layers, each capable of storing nearly the 4.7 GB capacity of a single-layer disc, almost doubling the total disc capacity to 8.5 GB. Discs can be read in many DVD devices (older units are less compatible) and can only be created using DVD+R DL and Super Multi drives. 

DL drives started appearing on the market during mid-2004, at prices comparable to those of existing single-layer drives. DL media is up to twice as expensive as single-layer media. The latest DL drives write double layer discs at a slower rate (up to 12×) than current single-layer discs (up to 24×).

== Dual-layer recording ==
Dual-layer recording allows DVD-R and DVD+R discs to store significantly more data, up to 8.5 gigabytes per disc, compared with 4.7 gigabytes for single-layer discs. DVD-R DL was developed for the DVD Forum by Pioneer Corporation, while DVD+R DL was developed for the DVD+RW Alliance by Philips and Mitsubishi Kagaku Media (MKM).

A dual-layer disc differs from its usual DVD counterpart by employing a second physical layer within the disc itself. The drive with dual-layer capability accesses the second layer by shining the laser through the first semi-transparent layer. The layer change can exhibit a noticeable pause in some DVD players, up to several seconds. This caused some viewers to worry that their dual-layer discs were damaged or defective. Studios began listing a standard message explaining this pausing effect on all dual-layer disc packaging.

DVD recordable discs supporting this technology are backward compatible with some existing DVD players and DVD-ROM drives. Many current DVD recorders support dual-layer technology, and the price is now comparable to that of single-layer drives, though the blank media remain more expensive. The transfer rates reached by dual-layer media for both reading and recording speeds are still well below those of single-layer media.

There are two modes for dual-layer orientation, &quot;parallel track path&quot; (PTP) and &quot;opposite track path&quot; (OTP). In PTP mode, used for DVD-ROM, both layers start recording at the inside diameter (ID) with the lead-in and end at the outside diameter (OD) with the lead-out. Sectors are sequenced from the beginning of the first layer to the end of the first layer, then the beginning of the second layer to the end of the second layer. In OTP mode, the second layer is read from the outside of the disk. 

For DVD-Video a variation of the technique is employed. DVD-Video is always recorded in OTP mode, but the video data is read from the beginning of the first layer towards the end of the first layer, when this ends (not necessarily at the end of the track) then reading is transferred to the second layer, but the video data commences from the same physical location that the first layer ends back towards the &quot;beginning&quot; of the second layer. This means that the &#x27;start&#x27; of the second layer may not have any recorded material present. This is to minimize the time that the video player takes to locate and focus on the second layer and thus provide the shortest possible pause in the content as the layer changes.

A common misconception is that the disc spins first in one direction, and then another, either for PTP or OTP recording, when in fact DVD-Writers always spin a disc in the clockwise direction. A simpler way to understand what&#x27;s written above is to think of the little hole in the centre of the DVD as the &quot;inside&quot; and the rim of the DVD as the &quot;outside&quot;. Since dual-layer DVDs have two data layers, placed one on top of the other – Layer 0 (L0) and Layer 1 (L1), there are two ways in which these two layers may be written to - L0, inside to outside and then L1 inside to outside again (PTP), or L0 inside to outside and then L1 outside to inside (OTP). OTP is usually used for DVD-Video, to prevent the inherent delay that PTP involves: in PTP, the laser head moves from the outside edge of the DVD to the inside to start reading L1 when it reaches the end of L0. This results in the video skipping or freezing up for some time as the laser head repositions itself and the system waits to start receiving data again.

== Recordable DVD capacity comparison ==
For comparison, the table below shows storage capacities of the four most common DVD recordable media, excluding DVD-RAM. (SL) stands for standard single-layer discs, while DL denotes the dual-layer variants. See articles on the formats in question for information on compatibility issues.

<doc id="592373" wikidata="Q266594" url="?curid=592373" title="Efate">
<text>Efate () is an island in the Pacific Ocean which is part of the Shefa Province in Vanuatu. It is also known as Île Vate.

== Geography ==

It is the most populous (approx. 66,000) island in Vanuatu. Efate&#x27;s land area of makes it Vanuatu&#x27;s third largest island. Its geological past was heavily volcanic, meaning that a lava shelf surrounds much of the island. Most inhabitants of Efate live in Port Vila, the national capital. Its highest mountain is Mount McDonald with a height of .

== History ==
Captain James Cook named it Sandwich Island &quot;in honour of my noble patron, the Earl of Sandwich&quot; on his 1774 voyage on .

During World War II, Efate served an important role as a United States military base.

On March 13, 2015, Port Vila, the island&#x27;s largest human settlement and the capital of Vanuatu, bore extensive damage from Cyclone Pam. In December 2024, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake reportedly damaged almost every single house on Efate, resulting in 19 fatalities. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that 116,000 people had been directly affected by the earthquake, equivalent to a third of Vanuatu&#x27;s population.

==Politics==
Efate became an independent commune in 1889 when residents declared the region as Franceville. However, by 1890 the commune was broken up.

Efate is governed by both the Port Vila Municipality and the Shefa Provincial Council, whose governance is the town limits of Port Vila only, and rural Efate and the outer Efate Islands, respectively.

The Island outside of Port Vila is represented in Parliament by the five-seat riding of Efate. Port Vila has its own five-seat riding. These ten MPs are elected through Single non-transferable voting.

== Small Islands off Efate ==

Around Efate lie many small islands, among them are Eretoka (Hat) Island, Lelepa, Nguna, Pele, Ekapum Lep, Erueti Lep, Ekapum Rik, Iriwiti Lep, Hideaway Island, Ifira Island, and Emao. Eretoka Island is a small island that, when seen from a distance looks like a floppy hat. This is where the famous Chief Roi Mata, along with his 20 wives and many other servants, were buried. Nguna, Pele and Emao are stratovolcanoes, which may form the rim of a volcanic caldera to their north.

== &quot;Survivor&quot; ==
Efate was used as the location for three seasons of the reality game show, &quot;Survivor&quot;. The island was used for season 9 of the American edition of &quot;Survivor&quot; (titled &quot;&quot;), season 2 of &quot;Australian Survivor&quot; (titled &quot;Australian Celebrity Survivor: Vanuatu&quot;) and season 6 of the French edition (titled &quot;Koh-Lanta: Vanuatu&quot;). Much of the &quot;Survivor: Vanuatu&quot; and &quot;Australian Celebrity Survivor&quot; was filmed approximately 30 minutes from Port Vila near Mangililu and Gideon&#x27;s Landing, the latter of which is now a commonly visited tourist attraction.

==Tourism==

The capital of Port Vila is the hub of tourism in Vanuatu receiving approximately 60 000 tourists annually by air transport, cruise ships and the yachting community. Due to the British and French influence both cuisines are readily available in the capital. Budget dining include the scattered Chinese eateries across Vila and the Mummas Market downtown. Outside of Port Vila a more rustic destination awaits, with most people living a traditional lifestyle: cooking island food or &#x27;aelan kakae&#x27;, tending their gardens daily as subsistence agriculture is the dominant economy in Vanuatu, and swimming at the beach.

Port Vila services the domestic carrier Air Vanuatu which goes to the outer islands of Vanuatu. Popular destinations such as Tanna and Santo can be reached daily from Port Vila, while more remote locations can be reached on a less regular basis. The island is served by Bauerfield International Airport.

Efate offers a range of tourism attractions and activities including Mele Cascades, Eton Beach, Tanalilui Road Markets, Round Island Tour, Buggy Fun Rental, Diving and Sunset Cruises.

<text>Nicolas François de Neufchâteau (; 17 April 175010 January 1828) was a French statesman, poet, and agricultural scientist.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Born at Saffais, in Meurthe-et-Moselle, the son of a schoolteacher, he studied at the college of Neufchâteau in the Vosges. At the age of fourteen he published a volume of poetry which obtained the interest of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire. When only sixteen, he was elected member of some of the main academies of France. In 1783 he was named &quot;procureur-général&quot; to the council of Saint Domingue.
He had previously been engaged on a translation of Ariosto, which he finished before his return to France five years afterwards, but it was destroyed during the shipwreck which occurred during his voyage home.

===Revolution===
During the French Revolution, Neufchâteau was elected deputy supplant to the National Assembly, charged with the organization of the &quot;département&quot; of the Vosges, and elected later to the Legislative Assembly, of which he first became secretary and then president.
In 1793 he was imprisoned on account of his supposed political sentiments, as they were deduced from his drama &quot;Paméla ou la vertu récompensée&quot; (Théâtre de la Nation, 1 August 1793), but was released the following year with the start of the Thermidorian Reaction.

===Directory and Napoleon===
In 1797, he became Minister of the Interior, distinguishing himself by his thorough administration. It is Neufchâteau who initiated the French system of inland navigation. He inaugurated the museum of the Louvre and was one of the promoters of the Exposition des produits de l&#x27;industrie française, the first universal exhibition of industrial products. He replaced Lazare Carnot as a member of the French Directory, a position he held between 9 September 1797, and 23 April 1798.

From 1804 to 1806 he was president of the Sénat conservateur, coinciding with the establishment of the First Empire — his office implied that he was the one to solicit Napoleon Bonaparte to assume the title of Emperor. In 1803, he was admitted to the Académie française, and in 1808 he received the dignity of count. Retiring from public life in 1814, after the Bourbon Restoration, he occupied himself chiefly with the study of agriculture until his death.

==Works==
Neufchâteau had multiple accomplishments, and interested himself in a great variety of subjects, but his fame rests mostly on what he did as a statesman for the encouragement and development of the industries of France. His late poetical productions are not judged to be as original as his youth &quot;oeuvre&quot;.
He was a noted grammarian and literary critic, as is witnessed by his editions of the &quot;Lettres provinciales&quot; and &quot;Pensées&quot; of Blaise Pascal (Paris, 1822 and 1826) and Alain-René Lesage&#x27;s &quot;Gil Blas&quot; (Paris, 1820). He was also the author of a large number of works on agriculture.

<doc id="592392" wikidata="Q325374" url="?curid=592392" title="Phil Mickelson">
<text>Philip Alfred Mickelson (born June 16, 1970) is an American professional golfer who currently plays in the LIV Golf League. He has won 45 events on the PGA Tour, including six major championships: three Masters titles (2004, 2006, 2010), two PGA Championships (2005, 2021), and one Open Championship (2013). With his win at the 2021 PGA Championship, Mickelson became the oldest major championship winner in history at the age of 50 years, 11 months, and 7 days. He is nicknamed &quot;Lefty&quot;, as he plays left-handed.

Mickelson is one of 17 players in the history of golf to win at least three of the four majors. He has won every major except the U.S. Open, in which he has finished runner-up a record six times. In 2022, Mickelson became the only golfer who has won 3 (or more) of the 4 majors to join the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour, leaving his PGA Tour membership of 30 years.
Mickelson has spent more than 25 consecutive years in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Ranking. He has spent over 700 weeks in the top 10, has reached a career-high world ranking of No. 2 several times and is a life member of the PGA Tour. Although naturally right-handed, he is known for his left-handed swing, having learned it by mirroring his right-handed father&#x27;s swing. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Early life==
Philip Alfred Mickelson was born on June 16, 1970, in San Diego, California, to parents Philip Mickelson Sr., an airline pilot and former naval aviator, and Mary Santos. He was raised there and in Scottsdale, Arizona. Mickelson has Portuguese, Swedish, and Sicilian ancestry. His maternal grandfather, Alfred Santos (also Mickelson&#x27;s middle name) was a caddie at Pebble Beach Golf Links and took Phil to play golf as a child.

Although otherwise right-handed, he played golf left-handed since he learned by watching his right-handed father swing, mirroring his style. Mickelson began golf under his father&#x27;s instruction before starting school. Phil Sr.&#x27;s work schedule as a commercial pilot allowed them to play together several times a week and young Phil honed his creative short game on an extensive practice area in their San Diego backyard. Mickelson graduated from the University of San Diego High School in 1988.

==Amateur career==
Mickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States; he captured three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments.

Mickelson was the second collegiate golfer to earn first-team All-American honors all four years. In 1990, he also became the first with a left-handed swing to win the U.S. Amateur title, defeating high school teammate Manny Zerman 5 and 4 in the 36-hole final at Cherry Hills, south of Denver. Mickelson secured perhaps his greatest achievement as an amateur in January 1991, winning his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, in Tucson, making him one of the few golfers to win a PGA Tour event as an amateur in the history of the PGA Tour. At age 20, he was only the sixth amateur to win a tour event and the first in over five years after Scott Verplank at the Western Open in August 1985. Other players to accomplish this feat include Doug Sanders (1956 Canadian Open) and Gene Littler (1954 San Diego Open). With five holes remaining, Mickelson led by a stroke, but made a triple-bogey and was then three strokes behind. The leaders ahead of him then stumbled, and he birdied 16 and 18 to win by a stroke. It was the most recent win by an amateur at a PGA Tour event until 2024, at The American Express, with Nick Dunlap taking the title.

That April, Mickelson was the low amateur at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. With his two-year PGA Tour exemption from the Tucson win, he played in several tour events in 1992 while an amateur but failed to make a cut.

==Professional career==
===1992–2003: Trying for first major win===
Mickelson graduated from ASU in June 1992 and quickly turned professional. He bypassed the tour&#x27;s qualifying process (Q-School) because of his 1991 win in Tucson, which earned him a two-year exemption. In 1992, Mickelson hired Jim &quot;Bones&quot; Mackay as his caddy. He won many PGA Tour tournaments during this period, including the Byron Nelson Golf Classic and the World Series of Golf in 1996, the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in 1998, the Colonial National Invitation in 2000, and the Greater Hartford Open in 2001 and again in 2002.

He appeared as himself in a non-speaking role in the 1996 film &quot;Tin Cup&quot;, starring Kevin Costner. His 2000 Buick Invitational win ended Tiger Woods&#x27;s streak of six consecutive victories on the PGA Tour. After the win, Mickelson said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be the bad guy. I wasn&#x27;t trying to end the streak per se. I was just trying to win the golf tournament.&quot; Although he had performed very well in the majors up to the end of the 2003 season (17 top-ten finishes, and six second- or third-place finishes between 1999 and 2003), Mickelson&#x27;s inability to win any of them led to him frequently being described as the &quot;best player never to win a major&quot;.

===2004–2006: First three major wins===

Mickelson&#x27;s first major championship win came in his thirteenth year on the PGA Tour in 2004, when he secured victory in the Masters with an birdie putt on the final hole. Ernie Els was the runner-up at a stroke back; the two played in different pairs in the final round and had traded birdies and eagles on the back nine. In addition to getting the &quot;majors monkey&quot; off his back, Mickelson was now only the third golfer with a left-handed swing to win a major; the others being New Zealander Sir Bob Charles, who won The Open Championship in 1963, and Canadian Mike Weir, who won The Masters in 2003. (Like Mickelson, Weir is a right-hander who plays left-handed.) A fourth left-handed winner is natural southpaw Bubba Watson, the Masters champion in 2012 and 2014.

Prior to the Ryder Cup in 2004, Mickelson was dropped from his long-standing contract with Titleist/Acushnet Golf after an incident when he left a voicemail message for a Callaway Golf executive. In it, he praised their driver and golf ball and thanked them for their help in getting some equipment for his brother. This message was played to all of their salesmen, and eventually found its way back to Titleist. He was then let out of his multi-year deal with Titleist 16 months early and signed on with Callaway Golf. He endured a great deal of ridicule and scrutiny from the press and fellow Ryder Cup members for his equipment change so close to the Ryder Cup matches. He faltered at the 2004 Ryder Cup with a record but refused to blame the sudden change in equipment or his practice methods for his performance.

In November 2004, Mickelson tallied his career-low for an 18-hole round: a 59 at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf at Poipu Bay Golf Course in Hawaii. The following year, Mickelson captured his second major at the PGA Championship at Baltusrol in a Monday final-round conclusion due to inclement weather the previous day. On the 18th hole, Mickelson hit one of his trademark soft pitches from deep greenside rough to within of the cup and made his birdie to finish at a 4-under-par total of 276, one shot ahead of Steve Elkington and Thomas Bjørn. Mickelson captured his third major title the following spring at the Masters. He won his second green jacket after shooting a 3-under-par final round, winning by two strokes over runner-up Tim Clark. This win propelled him to 2nd place in the Official World Golf Ranking (his career best), behind Woods, and ahead of Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen.

===2006: Collapse on final hole at the U.S. Open===
After winning two majors in a row heading into the U.S. Open at Winged Foot, Mickelson was bidding to join Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods as the only players to win three consecutive majors (not necessarily in the same calendar year). Mickelson was the joint leader going into the final round, but he was part of a wild finish to the tournament, in which he made major mistakes on the final hole and ended up in a tie for second place at +6 (286), one shot behind Geoff Ogilvy.

Mickelson bogeyed the 16th hole. On the 17th hole, with the lead at +4, he missed the fairway to the left, and his drive finished inside a garbage can, from which he was granted a free drop; he parred the hole. He had a one-shot lead and was in the last group going into the final hole.

Needing a par on the 18th hole for a one-shot victory, Mickelson continued with his aggressive style of play and chose to hit a driver off the tee; he hit his shot well left of the fairway (he had hit only two of thirteen fairways previously in the round). The ball bounced off a corporate hospitality tent and settled in an area of trampled-down grass that was enclosed with trees. He decided to go for the green with his second shot, rather than play it safe and pitch out into the fairway. His ball then hit a tree and did not advance more than . His next shot plugged into the left greenside bunker. He was unable to get up and down from there, resulting in a double bogey and costing him a chance of winning the championship outright or getting into an 18-hole playoff with Ogilvy.

After his disappointing finish, Mickelson said: &quot;I&#x27;m still in shock. I still can&#x27;t believe I did that. This one hurts more than any tournament because I had it won. Congratulations to Geoff Ogilvy on some great play. I want to thank all the people that supported me. The only thing I can say is I&#x27;m sorry.&quot; He was even more candid when he said: &quot;I just can&#x27;t believe I did that. I&#x27;m such an idiot.&quot;

===2006–2008===
During the third round of the 2006 Ford Championship at Doral, Mickelson gave a spectator $200 after his wayward tee shot at the par-5 10th broke the man&#x27;s watch. Mickelson also has shown other signs of appreciation. In 2007 after hearing the story of retired NFL player, Conrad Dobler, and his family on ESPN explaining their struggles to pay medical bills, Mickelson volunteered to pay tuition for Holli Dobler, Conrad Dobler&#x27;s daughter, at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.

Frustrated with his driving accuracy, Mickelson made the decision in April 2007 to leave longtime swing coach, Rick Smith. He then began working with Butch Harmon, a former coach of Tiger Woods and Greg Norman. On May 13, Mickelson came from a stroke back on the final round to shoot a three-under 69 to win The Players Championship with an 11-under-par 277.

In the U.S. Open at Oakmont in June, Mickelson missed the cut (by a stroke) for the first time in 31 majors after shooting 11 over par for 36 holes. He had been hampered by a wrist injury that was incurred while practicing in the thick rough at Oakmont a few weeks before the tournament.

On September 3, 2007, Mickelson won the Deutsche Bank Championship, which is the second FedEx Cup playoff event. On the final day, he was paired with Tiger Woods, who ended up finishing two strokes behind Mickelson in a tie for second. It was the first time that Mickelson was able to beat Woods while the two stars were paired together on the final day of a tournament. The next day Mickelson announced that he would not be competing in the third FedEx Cup playoff event. The day before his withdrawal, Mickelson said during a television interview that PGA Tour Commissioner, Tim Finchem, had not responded to advice he had given him on undisclosed issues.

In 2008, Mickelson won the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial with a −14, one shot ahead of Tim Clark and Rod Pampling. Mickelson shot a first-round 65 to start off the tournament at −5. He ended the day tied with Brett Wetterich, two shots behind leader, Johnson Wagner. Mickelson shot a second-round 68, and the third round 65, overall, being −12 for the first three rounds. On the final hole, after an absolutely horrendous tee shot, he was in thick rough with trees in his way. Many players would have punched out and taken their chances at making par from the fairway with a good wedge shot. Instead, Mickelson pulled out a high-lofted wedge and hit his approach shot over a tree, landing on the green where he one-putted for the win.

In a &quot;Men&#x27;s Vogue&quot; article, Mickelson recounted his effort to lose with the help of trainer Sean Cochran. &quot;Once the younger players started to come on tour, he realized that he had to start working out to maintain longevity in his career,&quot; Cochran said. Mickelson&#x27;s regimen consisted of increasing flexibility and power, eating five smaller meals a day, aerobic training, and carrying his own golf bag.

Mickelson was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 2008.

===2009===
Mickelson won his first 2009 tour event when he defended his title at the Northern Trust Open at Riviera, one stroke ahead of Steve Stricker. The victory was Mickelson&#x27;s 35th on tour; he surpassed Vijay Singh for second place on the current PGA Tour wins list. A month later, he won his 36th, and his first World Golf Championship, at the WGC-CA Championship with a one-stroke win over Nick Watney.

On May 20, it was announced that his wife Amy was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Mickelson announced that he would suspend his PGA Tour schedule indefinitely. She would begin treatment with major surgery as early as the following two weeks. Mickelson was scheduled to play the HP Byron Nelson Championship May 21–24, and to defend his title May 28–31 at the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial, but withdrew from both events. During the final round of the 2009 BMW PGA Championship, fellow golfer and family friend John Daly wore bright pink trousers in support of Mickelson&#x27;s wife. Also, the next Saturday, at the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial, a &quot;Pink Out&quot; event was hosted, and the PGA Tour players all wore pink that day, to support the Mickelson family.

On May 31, Mickelson announced that he would return to play on the PGA Tour in June at the St. Jude Classic and the U.S. Open, since he had heard from the doctors treating his wife that her cancer had been detected in an early stage. Mickelson shot a final round 70 at the 2009 U.S. Open and recorded his fifth runner-up finish at the U.S. Open. He shared the lead after an eagle at the 13th hole, but fell back with bogeys on 15 and 17; Lucas Glover captured the championship.

On July 6, it was announced that his mother Mary was diagnosed with breast cancer and would have surgery at the same hospital where his wife was treated. After hearing the news that his mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer, Mickelson took another leave of absence from the tour, missing The Open Championship at Turnberry. On July 28, Mickelson announced he would return in August at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, the week before the PGA Championship at Hazeltine National Golf Club.

In September, Mickelson won The Tour Championship for the second time in his career. He entered the final round four strokes off the lead, but shot a final round 65 to win the event by three strokes over Tiger Woods. With the win, Mickelson finished the season second behind Woods in the 2009 FedEx Cup standings.

On November 8, Mickelson won the WGC-HSBC Champions by one shot over Ernie Els in Shanghai.

===2010: Third Masters win===
In 2010, Mickelson won the Masters Tournament on April 11 with a 16-under-par performance, giving him a three-stroke win over Lee Westwood. The win marked the third Masters victory for Mickelson and his fourth major championship overall. Critical to Mickelson&#x27;s win was a dramatic run in the third round on Saturday in which Mickelson, trailing leader Westwood by five strokes as he prepared his approach shot to the 13th green, proceeded to make eagle, then to hole-out for eagle from 141 yards at the next hole, the par-4 14th, then on the next, the par-5 15th, to miss eagle from 81 yards by mere inches. After tapping in for birdie at 15, Mickelson, at −12, led Westwood, at −11, who had bogeyed the 12th hole and failed to capitalize on the par-5 13th, settling for par.

Westwood recaptured a one-stroke lead by the end of the round, but the momentum carried forward for Mickelson into round 4, where he posted a bogey-free 67 to Westwood&#x27;s 71. No other pursuer was able to keep pace to the end, though K. J. Choi and Anthony Kim made notable charges. For good measure, Mickelson birdied the final hole and memorably greeted his waiting wife, Amy, with a prolonged hug and kiss.

For many fans, Mickelson&#x27;s finish in the tournament was especially poignant, given that Amy had been suffering from breast cancer during the preceding year. Mary Mickelson, Phil&#x27;s mother, was also dealing with cancer. CBS Sports announcer Jim Nantz&#x27;s call of the final birdie putt, &quot;That&#x27;s a win for the family,&quot; was seen by many as capturing the moment well.

Tiger Woods had a dramatic return to competitive play after a scandal-ridden 20-week absence; he was in close contention throughout for the lead and finished tied with Choi for 4th at −11. Mickelson and others showed exciting play over the weekend, and the 2010 Masters had strong television ratings in the United States, ranking third all-time to Woods&#x27;s historic wins in 1997 and 2001. Mickelson&#x27;s win left him second only to Woods in major championships among his competitive contemporaries, moving him ahead of Ernie Els, Vijay Singh, and Pádraig Harrington, with three major championships each.

====Remainder of 2010====
Mickelson, one of the favorites for the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, shot 75 and 66 on Thursday and Friday to sit two shots off the lead. However, two weekend scores of 73 gave him a T4 finish. During the remainder of the 2010 season, Mickelson had multiple opportunities to become the number one player in the world rankings following the travails of Tiger Woods. However, a string of disappointing finishes by Mickelson saw the number one spot eventually go to Englishman Lee Westwood.

In the days leading up to the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits, Mickelson announced he had been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. He added that he had started medical treatment and had become a vegetarian in hopes of aiding his recovery. He maintained that both his short- and long-term prognosis were good, that the condition should have no long-term effect on his golfing career, and that he felt well. He also stated that the arthritis may go into permanent remission after one year of medical treatment. He went on to finish the championship T12, five shots behind winner Martin Kaymer.

===2011===
Mickelson started his 2011 season at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course. He shot and was tied for the 54 hole lead with Bill Haas. Mickelson needed to hole out on the 18th hole for eagle from 74 yards to force a playoff with Bubba Watson. He hit it to 4 feet and Watson won the tournament.

On April 3, Mickelson won the Shell Houston Open with a 20-under-par, three-stroke win over Scott Verplank. Mickelson rose to No. 3 in the world ranking, while Tiger Woods fell to No. 7. Mickelson had not been ranked above Woods since the week prior to the 1997 Masters Tournament.

At The Open Championship, Mickelson recorded just his second top-ten finish in 18 tournaments by tying for second with Dustin Johnson. His front nine 30 put him briefly in a tie for the lead with eventual champion Darren Clarke. However, putting problems caused him to fade from contention toward the end, to finish in a tie for second place.

===2012: 40th career PGA Tour win ===
Mickelson made his 2012 debut at the Humana Challenge and finished tied for 49th. He missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open after shooting rounds of 77 and 68. In the final round of the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, Mickelson rallied from six shots back, winning the tournament by two strokes with a final-round score of 8-under 64 and a four-round total of 269. The win marked his 40th career victory on the PGA Tour. The following week at Riviera Country Club, Mickelson lost the Northern Trust Open in a three-way playoff. He had held the lead or a share of it from day one until the back nine on Sunday when Bill Haas posted the clubhouse lead at seven under par. Mickelson holed a 27-foot birdie putt on the final regulation hole to force a playoff alongside Haas and Keegan Bradley. Haas however won the playoff with a 40-foot birdie putt on the second playoff hole. The second-place finish moved Mickelson back into the world&#x27;s top 10.

Mickelson finished tied for third at the Masters. After opening the tournament with a two-over-par 74, he shot 68–66 in the next two rounds and ended up one stroke behind leader Peter Hanson by Saturday night. Mickelson had a poor start to his fourth round, scoring a triple-bogey when he hit his ball far to the left of the green on the par-3 4th hole, hitting the stand and landing in a bamboo plant. This ended up being Mickelson&#x27;s only score over par in the whole round, and he ended with a score of eight-under overall. Earlier in the tournament, he received widespread praise for being present to watch Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Gary Player hit the ceremonial opening tee-shots, nearly seven hours before Mickelson&#x27;s own tee time.

Mickelson made a charge during the final round at the HP Byron Nelson Championship, but bogeyed the 17th and 18th, finishing T-7th. He then withdrew from the Memorial Tournament, citing mental fatigue, after a first-round 79. Mickelson was paired with Tiger Woods and Bubba Watson at the U.S. Open. He fought to make the cut and finished T-65th. After taking a couple of weeks off, he played in the Greenbrier Classic. Putting problems meant a second straight missed cut at the Greenbrier and a third missed cut at 2012 Open Championship, shooting 73-78 (11 over par). He finished T-43rd at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. He then finished T-36th at the PGA Championship.

To start the 2012 FedEx Cup Playoffs, Mickelson finished T38 at The Barclays, +1 for the tournament. He tied with Tiger Woods, Zach Johnson, and five other players. In this tournament, he started using the claw putting grip on the greens. At the next event, the Deutsche Bank Championship, he finished the tournament with a −14, tied for 4th with Dustin Johnson. At the BMW Championship, Mickelson posted a −16 for the first three rounds, one of those rounds being a −8, 64. On the final day, Mickelson shot a −2, 70, to finish tied for 2nd, with Lee Westwood, two shots behind leader, and back-to-back winner, Rory McIlroy. At the Tour Championship, he ended up finishing tied for 15th. He went on to have a 3–1 record at the Ryder Cup; however, the USA team lost the event.

===2013===
Mickelson began the 2013 season in January by playing in the Humana Challenge, where he finished T37 at −17. His next event was the following week in his home event near San Diego at the Farmers Insurance Open. Mickelson endured a disappointing tournament, finishing T51, shooting all four rounds in the 70s.

In the first round of the Waste Management Phoenix Open, Mickelson tied his career-low round of 60. He made seven birdies in his first nine holes and needed a birdie on the 18th hole to equal the PGA Tour record of 59. However, his 25-foot birdie putt on the final hole lipped out, resulting in him missing out by a single shot on making only the sixth round of 59 in PGA Tour history. Mickelson led the tournament wire-to-wire and completed a four-shot win over Brandt Snedeker for his 41st PGA Tour victory and 3rd Phoenix Open title. Mickelson&#x27;s score of 28-under-par tied Mark Calcavecchia&#x27;s tournament scoring record. He also moved back inside the world&#x27;s top 10 after falling down as far as number 22.

====Sixth runner-up finish at the U.S. Open====
At the U.S. Open at Merion, Mickelson entered the final round leading by one stroke after rounds of over the first three days, but he started the final round by three-putting the 3rd and 5th holes for double-bogeys to fall out of the lead. He regained the lead at the par-4 10th when he holed his second shot from the rough for an eagle. However, a misjudgment at the short par-3 13th saw him fly the green and make a bogey to slip one behind leader Justin Rose. Another bogey followed at the 15th, before narrowly missing a birdie putt on the 16th that would have tied Rose. Mickelson could not make a birdie at the 17th and after a blocked drive on the 18th, he could not hole his pitch from short of the green, which led to a final bogey.

Mickelson ended up finishing tied for second with Jason Day, two strokes behind Justin Rose. It was the sixth runner-up finish of Mickelson&#x27;s career at the U.S. Open, an event record and only behind Jack Nicklaus&#x27;s seven runner-up finishes at The Open Championship. After the event, Mickelson called the loss heartbreaking and said &quot;this is tough to swallow after coming so close... I felt like this was as good an opportunity I could ask for and to not get it... it hurts.&quot; It was also Father&#x27;s Day, which happened to be his birthday.

====Fifth major title at the Open Championship====
The week before The Open Championship, Mickelson warmed up for the event by winning his first tournament on British soil at the Scottish Open on July 14, after a sudden-death playoff against Branden Grace. After this victory, Mickelson spoke of his confidence ahead of his participation in the following week&#x27;s major championship. Mickelson said: &quot;I&#x27;ve never felt more excited going into The Open. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better way to get ready for a major than playing well the week before and getting into contention. Coming out on top just gives me more confidence.&quot;

The following week, Mickelson won his fifth major title on July 21 at the Open Championship (often referred to as the British Open) Muirfield Golf Links in Scotland; the Open Championship is the oldest of the four major tournaments in professional golf. This was the first time in history that anyone had won both the Scottish Open and The Open Championship in the same year. Mickelson birdied four of the last six holes in a brilliant final round of 66 to win the title by three strokes. He shed tears on the 18th green after completing his round. Mickelson later said: &quot;I played arguably the best round of my career, and shot the round of my life. The range of emotions I feel are as far apart as possible after losing the U.S. Open. But you have to be resilient in this game.&quot; In an interview before the 2015 Open, Mickelson said, &quot;Two years removed from that win, I still can&#x27;t believe how much it means to me.&quot;

===2014 and 2015: Inconsistent form and close calls in majors===

Mickelson missed the cut at the Masters for the first time since 1997. He failed to contend at the U.S. Open at Pinehurst in his first bid to complete the career grand slam. Mickelson&#x27;s lone top-10 of the PGA Tour season came at the year&#x27;s final major, the PGA Championship at Valhalla. Mickelson shot rounds of 69-67-67-66 to finish solo second, one shot behind world number one Rory McIlroy.

Prior to the 2015 Masters, Mickelson&#x27;s best finish in 2015 was a tie for 17th. At the Masters, Mickelson shot rounds of to finish tied for second with Justin Rose, four shots behind champion Jordan Spieth. The second-place finish was Mickelson&#x27;s tenth such finish in a major, placing him second all-time only to Jack Nicklaus in that regard.

At The Open Championship, Mickelson shot rounds of and was eight shots behind, outside the top forty. In the final round, Mickelson birdied the 15th hole to move to 10 under and within two of the lead. After a missed birdie putt on 16, Mickelson hit his drive on the infamous Road Hole (17th) at the famed Old Course at St Andrews onto a second-floor balcony of the Old Course Hotel. The out-of-bounds drive lead to a triple-bogey 7 that sent Mickelson tumbling out of contention.

Later in the year, it was announced that Mickelson would leave longtime swing coach Butch Harmon, feeling as though he needed to hear a new perspective on things.

===2016: New swing coach===
After leaving Butch Harmon, Mickelson hired Andrew Getson of Grayhawk Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona, to serve as his new swing coach. The two worked together heavily in the 2015 offseason to get Mickelson&#x27;s swing back.

Under Getson&#x27;s guidance, Mickelson made his 2016 debut at the CareerBuilder Challenge. He shot rounds of to finish in a tie for third place at 21-under-par. It was only Mickelson&#x27;s fifth top-five finish since his win at the 2013 Open Championship. The third-place finish was Mickelson&#x27;s highest finish in his first worldwide start of a calendar year since he won the same event to begin the 2004 season.

At the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, Mickelson shot rounds of to finish in solo second place, a shot behind Vaughn Taylor. Mickelson lipped out a five-foot birdie putt to force a playoff on the 72nd hole. He entered the final round with a two-stroke lead, his first 54-hole lead since the 2013 U.S. Open and was seeking to end a winless drought dating back 52 worldwide events to the 2013 Open Championship.

Mickelson shot a 63 in the opening round of The Open Championship at Royal Troon. The round set a new course record and matched the previous major championship record for lowest round. Mickelson had a birdie putt that narrowly missed on the final hole to set a new major championship scoring record of 62. He followed this up with a 69 in the second round for a 10 under par total and a one-shot lead over Henrik Stenson going into the weekend. In the third round, Mickelson shot a one-under 70 for a total of 11 under par to enter the final round one shot back of Stenson. Despite Mickelson&#x27;s bogey-free 65 in the final round, Stenson shot 63 to win by three shots. Mickelson finished 11 strokes clear of 3rd place, a major championship record for a runner-up. Mickelson&#x27;s 267 total set a record score for a runner-up in the British Open, and only trails Mickelson&#x27;s 266 at the 2001 PGA Championship as the lowest total by a runner-up in major championship history.

===2017: Recovery from surgeries===
In the fall of 2016, Mickelson had two sports hernia surgeries. Those in the golf community expected him to miss much time recovering, however his unexpected return at the CareerBuilder Challenge was a triumphant one, leading to a T-21 finish. The next week, in San Diego, he narrowly missed an eagle putt on the 18th hole on Sunday that would have got him to 8-under par instead posting −7 to finish T14 at the Farmers Insurance Open. The following week, at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, which he has won three times, he surged into contention following a Saturday 65. He played his first nine holes in 4-under 32 and sending his name to the top of the leaderboard. However, his charge faltered with bogeys at 11, 12, 14, 15, and a double bogey at the driveable 17th hole. He stumbled with a final round 71, still earning a T-16 finish, for his sixth straight top-25 finish on tour.

Mickelson came close to winning again at the FedEx St. Jude Classic where he had finished in second place the previous year to Daniel Berger. He started the final round four strokes behind leaders but he quickly played himself into contention. Following a birdie at the 10th hole he vaulted to the top of leaderboard but found trouble on the 12th hole. His tee shot carried out of bounds and his fourth shot hit the water, so he had to make a long putt to salvage triple-bogey. He managed to get one shot back, but he finished three shots behind winner Berger, in ninth place, for the second straight year.

Two weeks later he withdrew from the U.S. Open to attend his daughter&#x27;s high school graduation. A week later, his longtime caddie Jim (Bones) Mackay left Mickelson in a mutual agreement. Mickelson then missed the cut at both The Open Championship and the PGA Championship.

On September 6, days after posting his best finish of the season of T6 at the Dell Technologies Championship, Mickelson was named as a captain&#x27;s pick for the Presidents Cup. This maintained a streak of 23 consecutive USA teams in the Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup, dating back to 1994.

===2018–2019: Winless streak ends===
On March 4, 2018, Mickelson ended a winless drought that dated back to 2013, by capturing his third WGC championship at the WGC-Mexico Championship, with a final-round score of 66 and a total score of −16. Mickelson birdied two of his last four holes and had a lengthy putt to win outright on the 72nd hole, but tied with Justin Thomas. He defeated Thomas on the first extra hole of a sudden-death playoff with a par. After Thomas had flown the green, Mickelson had a birdie to win the playoff which lipped out. Thomas however could not get up and down for par, meaning Mickelson claimed the championship. The win was Mickelson&#x27;s 43rd on the PGA Tour and his first since winning the 2013 Open Championship. He also became the oldest winner of a WGC event, at age 47.

In the third round of the 2018 U.S. Open, Mickelson incurred a two-stroke penalty in a controversial incident on the 13th hole when he hit his ball with intent while it was still moving. He ended up shooting 81 (+11). His former coach Butch Harmon thought Mickelson should have been disqualified.

Mickelson was a captain&#x27;s pick for Team USA at the 2018 Ryder Cup, held in Paris between September 28 and 30. Paired with Bryson DeChambeau in the Friday afternoon foursomes, they lost 5 and 4 to Europe&#x27;s Sergio García and Alex Norén. In the Sunday singles match, Mickelson lost 4 and 2 to Francesco Molinari, as Team USA slumped to a 17.5 to 10.5 defeat.

On November 23, 2018, Mickelson won the pay-per-view event, Capital One&#x27;s The Match. This was a $9,000,000 winner-takes-all match against Tiger Woods at Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas. Mickelson needed four extra holes to beat Woods, which he did by holing a four-foot putt after Woods missed a seven-foot putt on the 22nd hole.

In his third start of the 2019 calendar year, Mickelson won the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, shooting a bogey-free final round 65 to defeat Paul Casey by three strokes. The win was Mickelson&#x27;s 44th career title on the PGA Tour, and his fifth at Pebble Beach, tying Mark O&#x27;Meara for most victories in the event. At 48 years of age, he also became the oldest winner of that event.

===2020: PGA Tour season and PGA Tour Champions debut===

In December 2019, Mickelson announced via Twitter that &quot;after turning down opportunities to go to the Middle East for many years&quot; he would play in the 2020 Saudi International tournament on the European Tour and would miss Waste Management Phoenix Open for the first time since 1989. However, his decision to visit and play in Saudi Arabia was widely criticized for ignoring the continuous human rights abuses in the nation. Mickelson went on to finish the February 2020 event tied for third.

Mickelson finished 3rd at the 2020 AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and tied for 2nd in the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational. Mickelson was the first player over 50 to finish in the top five of a World Golf Championship event. He was ultimately eliminated from the FedEx Cup Playoffs following The Northern Trust at TPC Boston in August 2020. One week later, Mickelson made his debut on the PGA Tour Champions. He won the Charles Schwab Series at Ozarks National in his first tournament after becoming eligible for PGA Tour Champions on his 50th birthday on June 16, 2020. He was the 20th player to win their debut tournament on tour. Mickelson&#x27;s 191 stroke total tied the PGA Tour Champions all-time record for a three-day event.

In October 2020, Mickelson won the Dominion Energy Charity Classic in Virginia. It was his second win in as many starts on the PGA Tour Champions.

===2021: The oldest major champion===
In February 2021, Mickelson was attempting to become the first player in PGA Tour Champions history to win his first three tournaments on tour. However, he fell short in the Cologuard Classic, finishing in a T-20 position with a score of 4 under par.

In May 2021, Mickelson held the 54-hole lead at the PGA Championship at the Kiawah Island Golf Resort in South Carolina, leading Brooks Koepka by one shot with one day to play. He shot a final-round 73 to capture the tournament, defeating Koepka and Louis Oosthuizen by two strokes, becoming the oldest major champion; at 50. As Mickelson walked down the fairway following an excellent second shot from the left rough on the 18th hole, thousands of fans engulfed him, with him walking towards the hole constantly tipping his hat and giving the thumbs up to the crowd as they cheered. However, the massive tumult of people meant playing partner Brooks Koepka was stranded in the sea of people, and with difficulties, he managed to reach the green to finish the hole. Mickelson eventually emerged from the crowd and two-putted for par, finishing the tournament at 6-under, besting the field by two strokes.

In October 2021, Mickelson won for the third time in four career starts on the PGA Tour Champions. Mickelson shot a final round 4-under-par 68 to win the inaugural Constellation Furyk &amp; Friends over Miguel Ángel Jiménez in Jacksonville, Florida.

In November 2021, Mickelson won the season-ending Charles Schwab Cup Championship in Phoenix, Arizona, with a final round six-under par 65. This victory was Mickelson&#x27;s fourth win in six career starts on PGA Tour Champions.

===2022: LIV Golf===
Mickelson told a journalist that despite Saudi Arabians being &quot;scary motherfuckers&quot; who had murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi and executed gay people, he supported the Saudi-backed LIV Golf because it offered an opportunity to reshape the PGA Tour. In response to these comments, Mickelson lost sponsors Amstel Light and KPMG. Mickelson announced he would be stepping away from golf to spend time with his family and would miss the 2022 Masters Tournament. In May, he also decided to withdraw from the PGA Championship which he won in 2021. On June 6, 2022, LIV Golf CEO Greg Norman announced that Mickelson will play in the first event on the LIV Golf Invitational Series beginning on June 9, 2022. On June 9, 2022, the first day of the LIV Golf Invitational London, the PGA Tour suspended Mickelson and 16 other current and former tour members for participating in a conflicting event without permission from the tour.

===2023===
At the 2023 Masters Tournament, Mickelson made what many viewed as the performance of the tournament, beginning the final day ten shots off of the lead, and finishing in tied second. Shooting a 65, Mickelson equaled his lowest score at Augusta almost 27 years ago. In the last seven holes, he scored five birdies and two pars.

==Playing style ==
As a competitor, Mickelson&#x27;s playing style is described by many as &quot;aggressive&quot; and highly social. His strategy toward difficult shots (bad lies, obstructions) would tend to be considered risky.

Mickelson has also been characterized by his powerful and sometimes inaccurate driver, but his excellent short game draws the most positive reviews, most of all his daring &quot;Phil flop&quot; shot in which a big swing with a high-lofted wedge against a tight lie flies a ball high into the air for a short distance.

In his prime, Mickelson was usually in the top 10 in scoring, and he led the PGA Tour in birdie average as recently as 2013.

==Earnings and endorsements==
Although ranked second on the PGA Tour&#x27;s all-time money list of tournament prize money won, Mickelson earns far more from endorsements than from prize money. According to one estimate of 2011 earnings (comprising salary, winnings, bonuses, endorsements, and appearances), Mickelson was then the second-highest paid athlete in the United States, earning an income of over $62 million, $53 million of which came from endorsements. In 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Mickelson&#x27;s annual income was $51 million. Major companies which Mickelson currently endorses are ExxonMobil (Mickelson and wife Amy started a teacher sponsorship fund with the company), Rolex, and Mizzen+Main. Mickelson&#x27;s sponsorship with Callaway Golf is currently &quot;paused&quot; and will be re-evaluated at a later date. After being diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2010, Mickelson was treated with Enbrel and began endorsing the drug. He has been previously sponsored by Titleist, KPMG, Workday, Bearing Point, Barclays, Amstel Light and Ford.

In 2022, Mickelson lost a significant number of sponsors including KPMG, Amstel Light, and Workday after comments he made about the Saudi-backed golf league, LIV Golf. In an interview, he stated that Saudis are &quot;scary motherfuckers to get involved with... We know they killed [&quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter and U.S. resident Jamal] Khashoggi and have a horrible record on human rights. They execute people over there for being gay. Knowing all of this, why would I even consider it? Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates.&quot;

==Business==
As a businessman, Mickelson is the co-founder of For Wellness with Dave Phillips, who is Jon Rahm&#x27;s coach and also co-founder of the Titleist Performance Institute. For Wellness sells functional food and beverage products, including the supplement that Mickelson adds to his coffee 

==Insider trading settlement==

On May 30, 2014, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the FBI and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were investigating Mickelson and associates of his for insider trading in Clorox and Dean Foods stock. Mickelson denied any wrongdoing. The initial investigation concluded without any charges related to Clorox. However, Mickelson was still under investigation for trades in Dean Foods from which he profited more than $931,000. On May 19, 2016, Mickelson was named as a relief defendant in a SEC complaint alleging insider trading but avoided criminal charges in a parallel case brought in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York. The action results from trades in Dean Foods in 2012 in conjunction with confidential information provided by Thomas Davis, a former director of Dean Foods Company, who tipped his friend and &quot;professional sports bettor&quot; Billy Walters.

The SEC alleged that Walters told Mickelson material, nonpublic information about Dean Foods, and the SEC fined Mickelson the equivalent of the $931,000 profit he made from trading Dean Foods stock as well as interest of $105,000. In 2017, Walters was convicted of making $40 million on Davis&#x27;s private information from 2008 to 2014 by a federal jury. At that time, it was also noted that Mickelson had &quot;once owed nearly $2 million in gambling debts to&quot; Walters.

<text>Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson (1390s – 4 May 1436) was a Swedish nobleman, rebel leader and military leader of German ancestry. He was the leader of the Engelbrekt rebellion in 1434 against Eric of Pomerania, king of the Kalmar Union.

==Biography==
Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson was the owner of a mine and ironworks in the historic mining region of Bergslagen. He was from the parish of Norberg (&quot;Norbergs socken&quot;) in Västmanland. His family originally came from Germany, having migrated to Sweden in the 1360s. The family coat of arms shows three half-lilies formed into a triangle.

Engelbrekt was dissatisfied by the numerous offences of the Danish local bailiffs and heavy taxation. In 1434 he started a rebellion with the support of mine workers and peasants from his home area. The background was the widespread discontent against the king&#x27;s bailiff in Västerås, , who was blamed for the distress that mining men suffered under his rule. Following formal complaints made by Engelbrekt on the behalf of the mining men an inquiry was made by Erik of Pomerania which eventually found that Jösse&#x27;s actions were criminal. Despite this Jösse was not replaced which led to a large host of peasants going to Västerås to protest. While the Riksråd intervened to peacefully resolve the protests, no actions were taken against the bailiff. In the spring of 1433 the protests escalated into violence and Dalecarlians besieged the bailiff&#x27;s castle. The Riksråd fired Jösse and replaced him with Hans von Eberstein. However, Engelbrekt was not satisfied since Jösse had not been prosecuted for his admitted crimes. A host of dalecarlians and västmanlanders destroyed the castles of Borganäs and Köpingshus. At this point, many nobles joined the rebels. The rebellion grew into a massive force sweeping the country. The uprising took place against the background of the Kalmar Union.

In 1435 Engelbrekt was appointed , Commander in chief, at a &quot;Riksdag&quot; in Arboga that is often considered the first &quot;Riksdag&quot; in Sweden. However, he was not able to withstand the Swedish nobility, who wanted to exploit the rebellion. He was somewhat forced into the background. The nobility and clergy decided to support Karl Knutsson Bonde, who in 1436 supplanted Engelbrekt as Rikshövitsman. Jösse Eriksson returned to Sweden the same year, but was lynched by peasants in Motala after presenting him to the local thing who condemned him to death.

==Death==
On 4 May 1436 Engelbrekt was murdered at , an islet in Lake Hjälmaren, by the aristocrat , who lived in the nearby Göksholm Castle. Måns&#x27;s father had been involved in a legal dispute with Engelbrekt regarding an illegal burning of a ship. The killing is considered by some historians to have been an assassination. Engelbrekt was buried in Örebro at Saint Nicholas Church.

Måns Bengtsson was a Swedish knight and chief judge in the traditional Swedish province of Närke. He was a member of the family Natt och Dag, a family from Östergötland which belongs to the Swedish noble class.

==Aftermath==

Over the next few decades Engelbrekt became a national hero, depicted as a public protector and an opponent of the Kalmar Union. His rebellion came to be seen as the start of the Swedish national awakening, which would triumph in the following century with the victory of King Gustav Vasa (reigned 1523–1560). Engelbrekt himself had no such ideas, which must have been anachronistic at the time; however his rebellion gave peasants a voice in Swedish politics which they never lost afterwards. The Engelbrekt rebellion caused the unity of the Kalmar Union to erode, leading to the expulsion of Danish forces from Sweden. Although later Danish kings regained influence over Sweden, the rebellion had set a precedent for Swedish claims to sovereignty.

==Legacy==
*A bronze statue representing Engelbrekt by Swedish sculptor Carl Gustaf Qvarnström was unveiled in Örebro in 1865.

*A statue of Engelbrekt is atop a pillar located outside of Stockholm City Hall.
*Carl Georg Starbäck published the novel &quot;Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson&quot; in two parts in 1868–69.
*Gustaf Wilhelm Gumælius published the poem &quot;Engelbrekt&quot; in 1858.

*August Strindberg included Engelbrekt in the 1899 five-act play &quot;Saga of the Folkungs&quot; (&quot;Folkungasagan&quot;).
*Engelbrekt became the subject of &quot;Engelbrekt&quot; (1928), an opera by the Swedish composer Natanael Berg (1879–1957).
*Engelbrekt Parish and Engelbrekt Church in the Diocese of Stockholm are named in his honor.

<doc id="592436" wikidata="Q2164733" url="?curid=592436" title="Ted Lindsay">
<text>Robert Blake Theodore Lindsay (July 29, 1925 – March 4, 2019) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who played as a forward for the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Black Hawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). Lindsay scored over 800 points in his Hockey Hall of Fame career, won the Art Ross Trophy in 1950, and won the Stanley Cup four times. Often referred to as &quot;Terrible Ted&quot;, Lindsay helped to organize the first attempt at a Players&#x27; Association in the late 1950s, an action which led to his trade to Chicago. In 2017, Lindsay was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history. Ted played a pivotal role in improving the lives of NHL players.1976-77 head coach Hillsdale College Chargers

==Playing career==
Lindsay was born in Renfrew, Ontario. His father, Bert Lindsay, had been a professional player himself, playing goaltender for the Renfrew Millionaires, Victoria Aristocrats, and Toronto Arenas. Lindsay played amateur hockey in Kirkland Lake before joining the St. Michael&#x27;s Majors in Toronto. In 1944 he played for the Memorial Cup champion Oshawa Generals.

Lindsay&#x27;s performance in the Ontario Hockey Association Junior A League (now the Ontario Hockey League) earned him an invitation to try out with the Detroit Red Wings of the NHL and he made his big league debut in 1944 at the age of 19. Lindsay played only one game in the AHL, with the Indianapolis Capitals, during the 1944–45 AHL season.

Having played amateur in Toronto, yet playing for Detroit, earned him the enmity of Toronto&#x27;s owner Conn Smythe with whom he would feud for the length of his career.

Playing left wing with centre Sid Abel and right winger Gordie Howe, on what the media and fans dubbed the &quot;Production Line&quot;, Lindsay became one of the NHL&#x27;s premier players. Although small in stature compared to most players in the league, he was a fierce competitor who earned the nickname &quot;Terrible Ted&quot; for his toughness. His rough play caused the NHL to develop penalties for &#x27;elbowing&#x27; and &#x27;kneeing&#x27; to discourage hitting between players using elbows and knees.

In the 1949–50 season, he won the Art Ross Trophy as the league&#x27;s leading scorer with 78 points and his team won the Stanley Cup. Over the next five years, he helped Detroit win three more championships and appeared with Howe on the cover of a March 1957 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; issue. Lindsay was the first player to lift the Stanley Cup and skate it around the rink, starting the tradition.

===Players&#x27; union===
That same year, Lindsay attended the annual pension plan meeting as the representative of the Red Wings players, where he found that the plan was kept secret. Later that year when he attended a promotion with football and baseball players, he found out that conditions in the other sports&#x27; pro leagues were much better. He was introduced to the lawyers for the players of the other leagues and became convinced that only through an association could the players&#x27; conditions be improved.

At a time when teams owned their players for their entire careers, the players began demanding such basics as a minimum salary and a properly funded pension plan. While team owners were getting rich with sold-out arena game after game, players were earning a pittance and many needed summer jobs to make a living. Almost all of these men had no more than a high school education and had been playing hockey as a profession all their working lives. Superstars in the 1950s earned less than $25,000 a year and when their playing days were over, they had nothing to fall back on and had to accept whatever work they could get to survive.

Lindsay and star defenceman Doug Harvey of the Montreal Canadiens led a small group to organize the first National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association. In secret, all of the players at the time were contacted and asked for their support to form an &quot;association&quot;, not a &quot;union&quot;, which was considered going too far. Support was nearly unanimous.

Lindsay worked doggedly for the cause and many fellow players who supported the association were benched or sent to obscurity in the minor leagues. He and Harvey then became convinced that only a union could win the demands, and set up a schedule to get players&#x27; support on record to be certified as a union. In a defiant gesture, the Toronto Maple Leafs and Detroit Red Wings were targeted for certification votes. While Montreal&#x27;s ownership was not opposing a union, Toronto&#x27;s Conn Smythe was adamantly against it. In the United States, the four teams were controlled or under obligations to the Norris syndicate. Despite Smythe&#x27;s efforts, the Toronto Maple Leafs players unanimously voted to organize. Next was the turn of Detroit to organize, and the Norrises would fight back.

When asked about the formation of the NHLPA, Lindsay said &quot;Actually, we don&#x27;t have many grievances. We just felt we should have an organization of this kind.&quot; Lindsay, one of the league&#x27;s top players, was first stripped of his captaincy, then was traded to the struggling Chicago Black Hawks. Jack Adams then planted rumors about Lindsay and false defamatory comments by him against his old team in the press, and showed a fake contract to the press, showing an inflated annual salary. The ruse worked and the Red Wings players rejected the union. Harvey suffered a similar fate, being traded from Montreal to the New York Rangers.

Lindsay initiated an anti-trust lawsuit against the league, alleging a monopoly since 1926. The players had a strong case, that could be easily proved with an exposure of the Norris syndicate&#x27;s operations, and Frank Calder&#x27;s efforts against the American Hockey Association (AHA) in 1926 and 1932, ironically involving James E. Norris on the AHA side. Also, the various Norris arenas were hiding revenues through ticket scalping and under-reporting arena capacities and actual ticket sales. Rather than face the lawsuit in court, the NHL, in an out-of-court settlement in February 1958, agreed to most of the players&#x27; demands, although the pension plan was not exposed until 1989, showing a surplus of $25 million. Although a union was not formed in 1958, a permanent union would be formed in 1967.

Part of the problem of organizing the players was confusion about the type of association they were forming. The NHLPA had applied, in Canada, to the Ontario Labour Relations Board for certification, but the OLRB had no experience with workers like hockey players. NHLPA members negotiated individual contracts and wanted to continue to bargain this way. The matter of the NHLPA being an actual union, where the members were bound together and fought for collective agreements, was unclear. The NHLPA legal counsel, Milton Mound, addressed this, saying that the players would negotiate on matters common to all players (pensions, allowances) but retained the right to individual contracts. The League, and especially Conn Smythe, argued that players were forming a &quot;trade union&quot; and were no better than &quot;commies&quot; and would lose things like individual bonuses. He believed that hockey players were in the business of being &quot;independent contractors&quot; and had no right or reason for a collective organization.

The confusion worried both the employer and the employee. The situation was exacerbated by the certification process. The OLRB was taking time, and no one knew how this transnational association would work, or how it would be recognized by the US National Labor Relations Board. In fact, the NLRB asked the NHLPA to withdraw its unfair labor practices charge on November 20, 1957, arguing it did not have jurisdiction. This was followed by the Montreal Canadiens players&#x27; rejection of the association in early January 1958.

The OLRB resumed meeting on January 7, but both the League and the players were concerned. The NHL was convinced that the ORLB was not going to dismiss the application, regardless of how they ruled on the union versus association issue, and the players were worried (given the setbacks in Detroit and Montreal) that they didn&#x27;t have grounds to form an association (especially since they didn&#x27;t want to be a traditional &quot;union&quot;).

The players and owners both felt pressure to conclude something, so they gathered, without lawyers, for a 13-hour meeting in the boardroom of the Biltmore Hotel in Palm Beach, just after the regular NHL winter meetings. In an out-of-court settlement on February 5, 1958, the NHL promised:

* a $7000 minimum wage (which was, in actuality, the unofficial League norm),
* an increase in pension benefits,
* increased hospitalization benefits,
* a limit on the number of exhibition games,
* the player shall be the sole judge of his physical fitness to play after injury.

&quot;The fundamental question at the root of the NHLPA failure was whether players really were laborers who could form a trade union. Seemingly caught in a space both commercial and non-commercial, players felt uneasy locating themselves wholly within either. This in itself reflected the success of the owners in using cultural formations to restrain their labor force. Led by Conn Smythe, the league appealed to cultural bonds of loyalty and tradition as justifications for retaining the existing economic structure of labor-management relations, long after other industries had been forced by the state to move toward formal, union-led collective bargaining arrangements.&quot;

For his role in establishing the original Players&#x27; Association, the Lester B. Pearson Award was later renamed to the Ted Lindsay Award in his honor. In 1995, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation produced the hockey movie &quot;Net Worth&quot; that depicts Lindsay&#x27;s battle to create the NHL Players&#x27; Association, based on the Lindsay chapters in the book of the same name.

The actions of the Red Wings, while maintaining control over the players, hindered their on-ice record. Jack Adams was fired in 1961. Lindsay played in Chicago for three years before retiring in 1960. Four years later, the 39-year-old Lindsay was enticed into making a comeback by his former linemate, Abel, who was now coach and general manager of the Red Wings. He played just one season, helping Detroit to its first regular season championship since his trade seven years earlier.

===Retirement and legacy===
The Red Wings did not have enough room on their roster to protect Lindsay in the 1965 interleague draft. He wished to retire as a Red Wing, and he and Abel planned to have him hide on the retired list for the 1965–66 season in anticipation of having him return for a &quot;Last Hurrah&quot; season the next year. However, when Maple Leafs owner Stafford Smythe got wind of this gambit, he pressured the league into vetoing it, forcing Lindsay to stay retired.
In his 1,068 career regular season games, Lindsay scored 379 goals and had 472 assists for 851 points. He played 133 playoff games in addition and recorded 47 goals and 96 points. He was voted to the first All-Star team eight times and the second team on one occasion. In 1966 he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, but refused to attend the men-only ceremony since he was not allowed to bring his wife and children. The rules were changed the following year, allowing women to attend. On November 10, 1991, the Detroit Red Wings honored his contribution to the team by retiring his sweater No. 7. In 1998, he was ranked number 21 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.

In 1972, NBC paid the NHL for the rights to broadcast games on national TV in the U.S. Lindsay was hired to do the color analysis, along with Tim Ryan, who did the play-by-play. Lindsay&#x27;s rough features, the legacy of the many cuts and stitches he accumulated during his playing days, were visible whenever he appeared on camera.

In 1977, Lindsay was named general manager of the Red Wings, who were struggling just to make the playoffs. Soon after taking over as general manager, he appeared in television commercials promoting the slogan &quot;Aggressive hockey is back in town&quot;. For his efforts, he was voted the NHL&#x27;s executive of the year. A year later, the Red Wings made the playoffs for the first time in nine years and won a playoff series for the first time in 12 years. Late in the 1979-80 season, he named himself head coach. He started the 1980-81 season on the bench but was forced out after a 3-14-3 start.

Lindsay was an &quot;Honored Member&quot; of the Detroit Red Wings Alumni Association, and was active in its efforts to raise money for children&#x27;s charities in Metro Detroit. He attended the Special Olympics Sports Celebrities Festival in Toronto in December 2008.

On October 18, 2008, the Red Wings commemorated Lindsay&#x27;s career with an original statue commissioned by artist Omri Amrany, who also created the Gordie Howe statue, on the Joe Louis Arena concourse.

The Ted Lindsay Foundation was founded in 2001 to fund research into a cure for autism. As of 2019, the foundation has raised over $3.4 million to fund autism research and provide a network of support to families of those with autism. His foundation donated over $100,000 to the Thoughtful House Center for Children in 2007.

On April 29, 2010, the NHL Players&#x27; Association announced that the Lester B. Pearson Award would be reintroduced as the Ted Lindsay Award for his skill, tenacity, leadership, and role in establishing the original Players&#x27; Association. The award is given annually to the NHL&#x27;s most outstanding player in the regular season as judged by the members of the Players&#x27; Association.

Lindsay was a third cousin to Bob Errey, who won back-to-back Stanley Cups with the Pittsburgh Penguins in the early 1990s as well as being a distant relative of brothers Bert and Con Corbeau, both of whom were on Stanley Cup-winning teams.

Lindsay was selected to Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2002, and was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2009. In April 2018, Oakland University awarded Lindsay an honorary doctor of humanities degree.

Lindsay died on March 4, 2019, at his home in Oakland, Michigan.

Lindsay was remembered during the Red Wings&#x27; game on March 7, 2019, where they played the New York Rangers. Every seat had a commemorative number 7 on it, and the Red Wings won 3–2 in a close game that ended in a shootout. A public visitation was held on March 8 at Little Caesars Arena in honor of Lindsay.

<doc id="592437" wikidata="Q5249498" url="?curid=592437" title="Declassification">
<text>Declassification is the process of ceasing a protective classification, often under the principle of freedom of information. Procedures for declassification vary by country. Papers may be withheld without being classified as secret, and eventually made available.

==United Kingdom==
Classified information has been governed by various Official Secrets Acts, the latest being the Official Secrets Act 1989. Until 1989 requested information was routinely kept secret invoking the public interest defence; this was largely removed by the 1989 Act. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 largely requires information to be disclosed unless there are good reasons for secrecy.

Confidential government papers such as the yearly cabinet papers used routinely to be withheld formally, although not necessarily classified as secret, for 30 years under the thirty year rule, and released usually on a New Year&#x27;s Day; freedom of information legislation has relaxed this rigid approach.

==United States==

Executive Order 13526 establishes the mechanisms for most declassifications, within the laws passed by Congress. The originating agency assigns a declassification date, by default 25 years. After 25 years, declassification review is automatic with nine narrow exceptions that allow information to remain as classified. At 50 years, there are two exceptions, and classifications beyond 75 years require special permission. Because of changes in policy and circumstances, agencies are expected to actively review documents that have been classified for fewer than 25 years. They must also respond to Mandatory Declassification Review and Freedom of Information Act requests. The National Archives and Records Administration houses the National Declassification Center to coordinate reviews and Information Security Oversight Office to promulgate rules and enforce quality measures across all agencies. NARA reviews documents on behalf of defunct agencies and permanently stores declassified documents for public inspection. The Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel has representatives from several agencies.

<doc id="592438" wikidata="Q2496436" url="?curid=592438" title="Fetal hemoglobin">
<text>Fetal hemoglobin, or foetal haemoglobin (also hemoglobin F, HbF, or α2γ2) is the main oxygen carrier protein in the human fetus. HemoglobinF is found in fetal red blood cells, and is involved in transporting oxygen from the mother&#x27;s bloodstream to organs and tissues in the fetus. It is produced at around 6weeks of pregnancy and the levels remain high after birth until the baby is roughly 2–4months old. HemoglobinF has a different composition than adult forms of hemoglobin, allowing it to bind (or attach to) oxygen more strongly; this in turn enables the developing fetus to retrieve oxygen from the mother&#x27;s bloodstream, which occurs through the placenta found in the mother&#x27;s uterus.

In the newborn, levels of hemoglobin F gradually decrease and reach adult levels (less than 1% of total hemoglobin) usually within the first year, as adult forms of hemoglobin begin to be produced. Diseases such as beta thalassemias, which affect components of the adult hemoglobin, can delay this process, and cause hemoglobin F levels to be higher than normal. In sickle cell anemia, increasing the production of hemoglobin F has been used as a treatment to relieve some of the symptoms.

==Structure and genetics==
Hemoglobin F, like adult hemoglobin (hemoglobin A and hemoglobin A2), has four subunits or chains. Each subunit contains a heme group with an iron element which is key in allowing the binding and unbinding of oxygen. As such, hemoglobin F can adopt two states: oxyhemoglobin (bound to oxygen) and deoxyhemoglobin (without oxygen). As hemoglobin F has 4 heme groups, it can bind to up to four oxygen molecules. It is composed of two α (alpha) subunits and two γ (gamma) subunits, whereas hemoglobin A (97% of total hemoglobin in adults) is composed of two α and two β (beta) subunits.

In humans, the α subunit is encoded on chromosome 16 and the γ subunit is encoded on chromosome 11. There are two very similar genes that code for the α subunit, &quot;HBA1&quot; and &quot;HBA2&quot;. The protein that they produce is identical, but they differ in gene regulatory regions that determine when or how much of the protein is produced. This leads to HBA1 and HBA2 contributing 40% and 60%, respectively, of the total α subunits produced. As a consequence, mutations on the &quot;HBA2&quot; gene are expected to have a stronger effect than mutations on the &quot;HBA1&quot; gene. 
There are also two similar copies of the gene coding for the γ subunit, &quot;HBG1&quot; and &quot;HBG2&quot;, but the protein produced is slightly different, just in one protein unit: &quot;HBG1&quot; codes for the protein form with an alanine at position 136, whereas &quot;HBG2&quot; codes for a glycine
BCL11A and ZBTB7A are major repressor proteins of hemoglobin F production, by binding to the gene coding for the γ subunit at their promoter region. This happens naturally as the newborn baby starts to switch from producing hemoglobin F to producing hemoglobin A.
Some genetic diseases can take place due to mutations to genes coding for components of hemoglobin F. Mutations to &quot;HBA1&quot; and &quot;HBA2&quot; genes can cause alpha-thalassemia and mutations to the promoter regions of &quot;HBG1&quot; and &quot;HBG2&quot; can cause hemoglobin F to still be produced after the switch to hemoglobin A should have occurred, which is called hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin.

==Production==
During the first 3 months of pregnancy, the main form of hemoglobin in the embryo/fetus is embryonic hemoglobin, which has 3 variants depending on the types of subunits it contains. The production of hemoglobin F starts from week 6, but it&#x27;s only from 3 months onwards that it becomes the main type found in fetal red blood cells.
The switch to produce adult forms of hemoglobin (essentially hemoglobin A) starts at around 40 weeks of gestation, which is close to the expected time of birth. At birth, hemoglobin F accounts for 50-95% of the infant&#x27;s hemoglobin and at around 6 months after birth, hemoglobin A becomes the predominant type. By the time the baby is one year old, the proportions of different types of hemoglobin are expected to approximate the adult levels, with hemoglobin F reduced to very low levels. The small proportion of red blood cells containing hemoglobin F are called F-cells, which also contain other types of hemoglobin.

In healthy adults, the composition of hemoglobin is hemoglobin A (~97%), hemoglobin A2 (2.2 - 3.5%) and hemoglobin F (&lt;1%).

Certain genetic abnormalities can cause the switch to adult hemoglobin synthesis to fail, resulting in a condition known as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin.

==Binding to oxygen==

===Factors affecting oxygen affinity===
The four hemes, which are the oxygen-binding parts of hemoglobin, are similar between hemoglobin F and other types of hemoglobin, including hemoglobin A. Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having γ subunits (instead of β, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) and it enhances hemoglobin&#x27;s ability to release oxygen. 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult β subunit has more positive charges than the fetal γ subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG. Due to the preference of 2,3-BPG for hemoglobin A, hemoglobin F binds to oxygen with more affinity, in average.

===Even higher oxygen affinity – hemoglobin Barts (four γ subunits)===
Hemoglobin Barts is an abnormal form of hemoglobin produced in hemoglobin Barts syndrome or alpha-thalassemia major, the most severe form of alpha-thalassemia. Alpha-thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder and one of the most common hemoglobin-related diseases, affecting the production of α subunits from hemoglobin. Depending on how many genes coding for the α subunit are impacted (between one and four), patients with this disease can have reduced to no production of the α subunit of the hemoglobin. As a consequence, less hemoglobin is available and this affects oxygen supply to the tissues. 
Hemoglobin Barts syndrome manifests when all four genes coding for α subunit are deleted. This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of α subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four γ subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn&#x27;t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen. While hemoglobin Barts is very efficient at binding oxygen, it doesn&#x27;t release oxygen to the organs and tissues. The disease is fatal for the fetus or newborn unless early diagnosis and intervention is carried out during pregnancy, and the child will be dependent on lifelong blood transfusions.

===Quantification of oxygen binding=== 
To quantify how strongly a certain type of hemoglobin binds to oxygen (or its affinity for oxygen), a parameter called P50 is often used. In a given situation, P50 can be understood as the partial pressure of oxygen at which Hb is 50% saturated. For example, Hemoglobin F has a lower P50 than hemoglobin A. This means that if we have the same amount of hemoglobin F and hemoglobin A in the blood and add oxygen to it, half of hemoglobin F will bind to oxygen before half of hemoglobin A manages to do so. Therefore, a lower P50 means stronger binding or higher affinity for oxygen.

For reference, the P50 of fetal hemoglobin is roughly 19 mmHg (a measure of pressure), whereas adult hemoglobin is approximately 26.8 mmHg (see Blood gas tension).

==Oxygen exchange in the womb==
During pregnancy, the mother&#x27;s circulatory system delivers oxygen and nutrients to the fetus and carries away nutrient-depleted blood enriched with carbon dioxide. The maternal and fetal blood circulations are separate and the exchange of molecules occurs through the placenta, in a region called intervillous space which is located in between maternal and fetal blood vessels.

Focusing on oxygen exchange, there are three important aspects that allow oxygen to pass from the maternal circulation into the fetal circulation. Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin (see &quot;Factors affecting oxygen affinity&quot;). Secondly, the mother&#x27;s bloodstream is richer in oxygen than that of the fetus, so oxygen naturally flows towards the fetal circulation by diffusion. The final factor is related to the effects of pH on maternal and fetal hemoglobin. As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and this favors the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin. At the same time, the decrease in carbon dioxide in fetal blood makes it more alkaline and favors the uptake of oxygen. This is called the Bohr effect or Haldane effect, which also happens in the air exchange in the lungs. All of these three factors are present simultaneously and cooperate to improve the fetus’ access to oxygen from the mother.

==F-cells==
F-cells are the subpopulation of red blood cells that contain hemoglobin F, in amongst other types of hemoglobin. While common in fetuses, in normal adults, only around 3-7% of red blood cells contain hemoglobin F. The low percentage of F-cells in adults owes to two factors: very low levels of hemoglobin F being present and its tendency to be produced only in a subset of cells rather than evenly distributed amongst all red blood cells. In fact, there is a positive correlation between the levels of hemoglobin F and number of F-cells, with patients with higher percentages of hemoglobin F also having a higher proportion of F-cells. Despite the correlations between hemoglobin F levels and F-cell numbers, usually they are determined by direct measurements. While the amount of hemoglobin F is calculated using cell lysates, which are fluids with contents of cells that were broken open, F-cell numbers are done by counting intact red blood cells.

Due to the correlation between the amount of hemoglobin F and F-cells, F-cell numbers are higher in some inherited hemoglobin disorders, including beta-thalassemia, sickle cell anemia and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. Additionally, some acquired conditions can also have higher F-cell numbers, such as acute erythropoietic stress (response to poor oxygenation which includes very rapid synthesis of new red blood cells) and pregnancy.
F-cells have similar mass of haemoglobin per cell compared to red blood cells without haemoglobin F, which is measured mean cell haemoglobin values (MCH).

==Conditions with high hemoglobin F==

===During pregnancy===
There is a significant increase in hemoglobin F levels during early pregnancy. However, it&#x27;s not clear whether these levels are stable or decrease as the pregnancy goes on, as different sources reported different results.
The increase in hemoglobin F then induces a 3 to 7 fold increase in the number of F-cells in pregnant women, which was observed between the 23rd to 31st week of gestation.
However, as to the reason of the increase in hemoglobin F levels in pregnant women, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be conclusive evidence. While an early study suggested that maternal red blood cells switch on hemoglobin F production during pregnancy, more recent literature suggested that the increase in haemoglobin F could be, at least in part, due to fetal red blood cells being transferred to the maternal circulation.

Presence of high levels of hemoglobin F in pregnant women can impact the growth of the fetus, as fetal red blood cells struggle to compete for the oxygen from the mother&#x27;s circulation. This is because instead of competing with hemoglobin A, which has a weaker association to oxygen than hemoglobin F, it becomes a competition between fetal and maternal hemoglobin F which have similar affinities for oxygen. As a result, women with hemoglobin F as &gt;70% of total hemoglobin are much more likely to have fetuses that are small for their gestational age compared women with &lt;70% hemoglobin F (at a rate of 100% compared to 8%, respectively).

===Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH)===

This is a rare benign genetic disease where production of hemoglobin F persists after twelve months of life and into the adulthood. As a result, hemoglobin F is present in a higher number of adult red blood cells than normal.
It doesn&#x27;t present symptoms and is usually discovered when screening for other blood-related diseases. 
In this condition, the genes coding for the γ subunit (HBG1 and HBG2) are not suppressed shortly before birth. This can happen when a mutation occurs in the promoter region of HBG1 and HBG2, preventing the binding of BCL11A and ZBTB7A proteins. These proteins would normally bind and suppress the production of γ subunits and as they can&#x27;t bind due to the mutation, γ subunits continue to be produced. There are two types of patients with HPFH: either with one normal copy of the gene and one disease form or with two disease copies. Whereas normal adults have less than 1% of hemoglobin F, patients with only one disease gene have 5-30%. Patients with two disease copies can have hemoglobin F in up to 100% of red blood cells. 
As other diseases such as sickle cell disease could also cause a higher level of hemoglobin F to be present, it can sometimes be misdiagnosed.

===Delta beta-thalassemia===

Delta beta-thalassemia is a rare genetic blood disorder in which the production of both δ and β subunits are reduced or absent. In these cases, the production of the γ subunit increases to compensate for the loss of δ and β subunits, resulting in a higher amount of hemoglobin F present in the blood. Normally, people have two sets of genes for producing δ and β subunits. People with only one set of working genes don&#x27;t get any symptoms and in the rarely reported cases where both sets of genes are affected, the patients only experienced mild symptoms.

==Clinical significance==

===Treatment of sickle-cell disease===

The discovery that hemoglobin F alleviated the symptoms of sickle cell disease occurred in 1948. Janet Watson observed that red blood cells from infants with the disease took longer to sickle and did not deform as much compared to their mother&#x27;s cells, which carried the disease trait. Later, it was noted that patients with sickle cell trait as well as hereditary persistence of hemoglobin F (HPFH) didn&#x27;t have symptoms. Additionally, in sickle cell patients, F-cells were found to be more long living than non-F cells as they contain hemoglobin F.

When fetal hemoglobin production is switched off after birth, normal children begin producing adult hemoglobin (HbA). Children with sickle-cell disease begin producing a defective form of hemoglobin called hemoglobin S instead, which form chains that cause red blood cells to change their shape from round to sickle-shaped.
These defective red blood cells have a much shorter life span than normal red blood cells (10–20 days compared to up to 120 days). They also have a greater tendency to clump together and block small blood vessels, preventing blood supply to tissues and organs. This leads to the so-called &quot;vaso-occlusive crisis&quot;, which is a hallmark of the disease.
If fetal hemoglobin remains relatively high after birth, the number of painful episodes decreases in patients with sickle-cell disease and they have a better prognosis.
Fetal hemoglobin&#x27;s role in reducing disease severity comes from its ability to disrupt the formation of hemoglobin S chains within red blood cells. 
Interestingly, while higher levels of hemoglobin F were associated with improvement of some symptoms, including the frequency of painful episodes, leg ulcers and the general severity of the disease, it had no correlation to others. A few examples are priapism, stroke and systemic blood pressure. As hemoglobin F are only produced by some red blood cells, in different quantities, only a subpopulation of cells are protected against sickling. It could be that the symptoms that high hemoglobin F doesn&#x27;t prevent are quite sensitive to the rupture of the sickled non-F cells.

Hydroxyurea is a chemical that promotes the production of fetal hemoglobin and reduces the premature rupturing of red blood cells. Combination therapy with hydroxyurea and recombinant erythropoietin — rather than treatment with hydroxyurea alone — has been shown to further elevate hemoglobin F levels and to promote the development of HbF-containing F-cells.

===Hemoglobin F as a marker for cancers===
There have been some studies evaluating the possibility of using hemoglobin F as an indicator of the prognosis for cancer. It has been suggested that elevated concentrations of haemoglobin F can be found in main kinds of solid tumours and blood cancers.
Examples include acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myeloid leukemia in children, where higher concentrations of hemoglobin F were associated with a worse outcome, including a higher risk of relapse or death.
Other cancer types where higher hemoglobin F levels have been observed are transitional cell cancer, colorectal carcinoma
and various types of blastomas. In fact, in several types of blastomas, including neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma (affecting the nerve cells and the eyes, respectively), F-cells were found in newly formed blood vessels and spaces in between tumour cells. Clusters of F-cells were also present in the bone marrow of some of these patients.
Interestingly, hemoglobin F is not directly produced by tumour cells, but seems to be induced by the biological environment of the cancer in nearby blood cells. A reason suggested for this increase in hemoglobin F is that it may favor cancer growth by providing better oxygen supply to the developing cancerous cells. In adults, increased hemoglobin F production is thought to be caused by factors leading to the activation of the gene coding for the γ subunit, such as DNA demethylation (which can activate normally silent genes and is a hallmark of cancer).

<text>A playback singer, as they are usually known in South Asian cinema, or ghost singer in Western cinema, is a singer whose performance is pre-recorded for use in films. Playback singers record songs for soundtracks, and the performers lip-sync the songs for cameras; the actual singer does not appear on the screen. Generally, to synchronize with the emotional situation of the song or complete movie, the playback singer is given the idea of all those so that the singer can interpret by taking the right moves in their vocals. 

==South Asia==
South Asian films produced in the Indian subcontinent frequently use this technique. A majority of Indian films as well as Pakistani films typically include six or seven songs. After &quot;Alam Ara&quot; (1931), the first Indian talkie film, for many years singers made dual recordings for a film, one during the shoot, and later in the recording studio, until 1952 or 1953. Popular playback singers in India enjoy the same status as popular actors and music directors and receive wide public admiration. Most of the playback singers are initially trained in classical music, but they later often expand their range.

Mohammed Rafi and Ahmed Rushdi are regarded as two of the most influential playback singers in South Asia. The sisters Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle, who have mainly worked in Hindi films, are two of the best-known and most prolific playback singers in India. In 2011, &quot;Guinness&quot; officially acknowledged Bhosle as the most recorded artist in music history.

==Hollywood==
The practice is also employed in Hollywood musicals, where such performers are known as ghost singers, though less frequently in other genres. Notable Hollywood performances include Anita Ellis as the voice of Rita Hayworth&#x27;s title character in &quot;Gilda&quot; (1946). Both Ellis&#x27;s and Hayworth&#x27;s performances were so impressive that audiences did not know that the latter&#x27;s voice had been dubbed. Called &quot;the sexiest voice of 1946&quot;, Ellis&#x27;s identity was not publicized; Hayworth was instead credited on the soundtrack. 

There have been other uses of ghost singing in Hollywood, including Marni Nixon in &quot;West Side Story&quot; for Natalie Wood&#x27;s portrayal of Maria, in &quot;The King and I&quot; for Deborah Kerr&#x27;s Anna Leonowens, and for Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s Eliza in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;; Bill Lee singing for John Kerr&#x27;s Lieutenant Cable in &quot;South Pacific&quot; and for Christopher Plummer&#x27;s Captain von Trapp in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, Lindsay Ridgeway for Ashley Peldon&#x27;s character as Darla Dimple in the animated film &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;, Claudia Brücken providing the singing voice for Erika Heynatz&#x27;s character as Elsa Lichtmann in &quot;L.A. Noire&quot;, and Betty Noyes singing for Debbie Reynolds in &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, a film in which ghost singing is a major plot point.

<text>Spiritual Shouter Baptist Liberation Day is an annual public holiday celebrated in Trinidad and Tobago on 30 March. The holiday commemorates the repeal on 30 March 1951 of the 1917 Shouter Prohibition Ordinance that prohibited the activities of the Shouter or Spiritual Baptist faith.

Trinidad and Tobago is the only country in the world that celebrates a public holiday for the Spiritual Baptist faith.

It is a very important event for the Spiritual Baptists in Trinidad.

<text>Olive Thomas (born Oliva R. Duffy; October 20, 1894 – September 10, 1920) was an American silent-film actress, art model, and photo model.

Thomas began her career as an illustrator&#x27;s model in 1914, and moved on to the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; the following year. During her time as a Ziegfeld girl, she also appeared in the more risqué show &quot;The Midnight Frolic&quot;. In 1916, she began a successful career in silent films and would appear in more than 20 features over the course of her four-year film career. That year, she married actor Jack Pickford, the younger brother of fellow silent-film star Mary Pickford.

On September 10, 1920, Thomas died in Paris five days after ingesting her husband&#x27;s syphilis medication, mercury dichloride, that brought on acute nephritis. Although her death was ruled accidental, news of her hospitalization and subsequent death were the subject of speculation in the press. Thomas&#x27;s death is considered one of the first major Hollywood scandals.

==Early life==
Oliva R. Duffy was born in Charleroi, Pennsylvania, but often claimed her birth name was Oliveretta Elaine Duffy. She was the eldest of three children born to Rena and James Duffy, both of whom were of Irish descent. She had two brothers, James (born 1896) and William (born 1899), both of whom she later helped to secure work in the film industry; after serving in the United States Marine Corps in France during World War I, William worked as a cameraman and James worked as an assistant director. At the time of her death, both brothers were employed by Selznick Productions.

Her father, James Duffy, was a steelworker and died in a work-related accident in 1906. After his death, the family moved to McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, a small mill town. Oliva and her brothers often stayed with their grandparents while their mother Rena worked in a local factory. Rena Duffy later married Harry M. Van Kirk, a worker on the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. Their only child together, daughter Harriet, was born in 1914 and died in a car accident in 1931.

Oliva left school at 15 to help support her siblings. She got a job selling gingham at Joseph Horne&#x27;s department store for per week (). At 16 in April 1911, she married Bernard Krug Thomas in McKees Rocks. During the two-year marriage, she reportedly worked as a clerk in Kaufmann&#x27;s, a major department store in Pittsburgh. After their separation in 1913, Oliva moved to New York City and lived with a family member. She later found work in a Harlem department store.

==Career==

===Modeling===
In 1914, Thomas entered and subsequently won the &quot;Most Beautiful Girl in New York City&quot; contest held by Howard Chandler Christy, a commercial artist. Winning the contest helped establish her career as an artists&#x27; model, and she would later pose for Harrison Fisher, Raphael Kirchner, Penrhyn Stanlaws, and Haskell Coffin. Thomas was featured on many magazine covers, including that of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;.

===Stage===
Fisher wrote a letter of recommendation to Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., resulting in Thomas&#x27; being hired for the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. However, Thomas later disputed this, claiming she &quot;walked right up and asked for the job&quot;. She made her stage debut in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1915&quot; on June 21, 1915. Thomas&#x27; popularity in the &quot;Follies&quot; led to her being cast in Ziegfeld&#x27;s more risqué &quot;Midnight Frolic&quot; show. The &quot;Frolic&quot; was staged after hours in the roof garden of the New Amsterdam Theatre. It was primarily a show for famous male patrons who had plenty of money to bestow on the beautiful young female performers. Thomas received expensive gifts from her admirers; it was rumored that German Ambassador Albrecht von Bernstorff had given her a $10,000 string of pearls.

During her time in &quot;The Follies&quot;, Thomas began an affair with Florenz Ziegfeld. Ziegfeld, who was married to actress Billie Burke, had affairs with other Ziegfeld girls, including Lillian Lorraine and Marilyn Miller (who later married Thomas&#x27; widower Jack Pickford). Thomas ended the affair with Ziegfeld after he refused to leave Burke to marry her.
Thomas continued modeling while appearing in the Follies. Alberto Vargas, Florenz Ziegfeld’s artist-in-residence who painted many stars of the Ziegfeld stage, immortalized Thomas in the portrait he painted of her from memory after her death and titled it &quot;Memory of Olive Thomas or The Lotus Eater&quot; (as noted on the label he placed on the back of the completed work). &quot;Lotus Eater&quot; was a reference to Lotus-eaters of Greek mythology. The portrait depicts Thomas nude from the waist up, covering her left breast with her left hand while holding a rose with her right above her upraised face. The painting remained in his personal collection until his death in 1982 and was sold by his estate to a private collector in 1986. Vargas called Thomas &quot;one of the most beautiful brunettes that Ziegfeld ever glorified.

===Silent films===
In July 1916, Thomas signed with the International Film Company. She made her on-screen debut in Episode 10 of &quot;Beatrice Fairfax&quot;, a film serial. In 1917, she made her full-length feature debut in &quot;A Girl Like That&quot; for Paramount Pictures.

That same year, she signed with Triangle Pictures. Shortly after, news broke of her engagement to actor Jack Pickford, whom she had married a year prior. Thomas and Pickford, who was the younger brother of Mary Pickford, kept the marriage secret because Thomas did not want people to think her success in film was due to her association with the Pickfords. Her first film for Triangle, &quot;Madcap Madge&quot;, was released in June 1917. Thomas&#x27;s popularity at Triangle grew with performances in &quot;Indiscreet Corrine&quot; (1917) and &quot;Limousine Life&quot; (1918). In 1919, she portrayed a French girl who poses as a boy in &quot;Toton the Apache&quot;. Thomas later said that she felt her work in &quot;Toton&quot; was &quot;the first real thing I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot; She made her final film for Triangle, &quot;The Follies Girl&quot;, that same year.

After leaving Triangle, Thomas signed with Myron Selznick&#x27;s Selznick Pictures Company in December 1918 for a salary of $2,500 a week. She hoped for more serious roles, believing that with her husband signed to the same company, she would have more influence. Her first film for Selznick, &quot;Upstairs and Down&quot; (1919), proved successful and established her image as a &quot;baby vamp&quot;. She followed with roles in &quot;Love&#x27;s Prisoner&quot; and &quot;Out Yonder&quot;, both in 1919. In 1920&#x27;s &quot;The Flapper&quot;, Thomas played a teenage schoolgirl who yearns for excitement beyond her small Florida town. Thomas was the first actress to portray a lead character who was a flapper, and the film was the first of its kind to portray the flapper lifestyle. Frances Marion, who wrote the scenario, was responsible for bringing the term into the American vernacular. &quot;The Flapper&quot; proved to be popular and became one of Thomas&#x27;s most successful films. On October 4, 1920, Thomas&#x27;s final film, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;, was released.

==Personal life==
Thomas&#x27;s first marriage was to Bernard Krug Thomas, a man she met at age 15 while living in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. They married on April 1, 1911, and lived with his parents in McKees Rocks for the first six months of their marriage, then moved into their own apartment. Krug Thomas worked as a clerk at the Pressed Steel Car Company while Olive took care of the home. In 1913, the couple separated and Olive moved to New York City to pursue a career as a model. She was granted a divorce on September 25, 1915, on the grounds of desertion and cruelty. In 1931, Bernard Krug Thomas gave an interview to &quot;The Pittsburg Press&quot;, detailing his marriage to Olive, implying that a cause of the demise of their marriage was her ambition and a desire to both obtain a life of &quot;luxury&quot; and &quot;improve her station&quot;.

In late 1916, Thomas met actor Jack Pickford, brother of one of the most successful silent stars, Mary Pickford, at a beach cafe on the Santa Monica Pier. Both Thomas and Pickford were known for their partying. Screenwriter Frances Marion remarked, &quot;I had seen her often at the Pickford home, for she was engaged to Mary&#x27;s brother, Jack. Two innocent-looking children, they were the gayest, wildest brats who ever stirred the stardust on Broadway. Both were talented, but they were much more interested in playing the roulette of life than in concentrating on their careers.&quot; Thomas eloped with Pickford on October 25, 1916, in New Jersey. None of their family was present, with actor Thomas Meighan as their only witness. Although the couple never had their own children, in 1920 they adopted Thomas&#x27;s six-year-old nephew, the son of one of her brothers, after his mother died.

By most accounts, Thomas was the love of Pickford&#x27;s life. However, the marriage was tumultuous and filled with highly-charged conflict, followed by lavish making up through the exchange of expensive gifts. Pickford&#x27;s family did not always approve of Thomas, but most of the family did attend her funeral. In Mary Pickford&#x27;s 1955 autobiography &quot;Sunshine and Shadow&quot;, she wrote:I regret to say that none of us approved of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from &quot;the Follies&quot;. She and Jack were madly in love with one another, but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.

==Death==
For several years, Thomas and Pickford had intended to vacation together. Both were constantly traveling and had little time to spend together. With their marriage on the rocks, the couple decided to take a second honeymoon. In August 1920, the pair headed for Paris, hoping to combine a vacation with some film preparations.

On the night of September 5, 1920, they went out for a night of entertainment and partying at the famous bistros in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris. Returning to their suite in the Hotel Ritz around 3 a.m., Pickford either fell asleep or was outside the bedroom. An intoxicated and tired Thomas ingested a mercury bichloride solution, a topical medication that had been prescribed to Pickford to treat sores caused by his chronic syphilis. While accounts vary, authorities speculated that Thomas thought the flask contained either drinking water or a sleeping tonic. The medication&#x27;s label was in French, which may have added to her confusion. After drinking the liquid she screamed, &quot;Oh, my God!&quot; and Pickford rushed to assist her. She was taken to the American Hospital in the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine, where Pickford and his former brother-in-law Owen Moore remained at her side until she died five days later.

===Controversy and death ruling===
While Thomas lay in the American Hospital dying, the press began reporting on the various rumors that began to arise about the circumstances of the incident. Some papers reported that Thomas had attempted suicide after having a fight with Pickford over his alleged infidelities, while others said she attempted suicide after discovering Pickford had given her syphilis. There were rumors that Thomas was plagued by a drug addiction, that she and Pickford had been involved in &quot;champagne and cocaine orgies,&quot; or that Pickford tricked her into drinking poison in an attempt to murder her to collect her insurance money. Owen Moore, who accompanied Pickford and Thomas in Paris, denied the rumors, saying that Thomas was not suicidal and that she and Pickford had not fought that evening. Jack Pickford also denied the rumors, stating, &quot;Olive and I were the greatest pals on Earth. Her death is a ghastly mistake.&quot;

On September 13, 1920, Pickford gave his account of that night to the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot;:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o&#x27;clock in the morning. I had already booked airplane seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.&lt;br&gt;Suddenly she shrieked: &#x27;My God.&#x27; I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me to find out what was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: &#x27;Poison.&#x27; It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, &#x27;O, my God, I&#x27;m poisoned.&#x27; I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.&lt;br&gt;Nine o&#x27;clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn&#x27;t want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.&lt;br&gt;She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. &#x27;It&#x27;s all a mistake, darling Jack,&#x27; she said. But I knew she was dying.&lt;br&gt;She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: &#x27;Pretty weak, but I&#x27;ll be all right in a little while, don&#x27;t worry, darling.&#x27; Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.

After Thomas&#x27;s death, the police initiated an investigation, and an autopsy was performed, which attributed the death to acute nephritis caused by mercury bichloride absorption. On September 13, 1920, her death was ruled accidental by the Paris physician who conducted her autopsy.

===Funeral===
Jack Pickford brought Thomas&#x27;s body back to the United States. Several accounts state that Pickford tried to commit suicide en route but was talked out of it. In her autobiography, Mary Pickford recalls her brother&#x27;s disclosure that he had made such an attempt during the return trip:

On September 29, 1920, an Episcopal funeral service for Thomas was held at St. Thomas Episcopal Church in New York City. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, police escorts were needed at the event, as the church was crowded with &quot;hundreds&quot; of fellow actors and other invited attendees, as well as a horde of curious onlookers. Several women were reported to have fainted during the ceremony, and several men had their hats crushed in the rush to view the casket. Thomas is interred in a crypt at the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx.

===Estate===
Thomas did not leave a will upon her death. Her estate, which was later valued at $27,644, () was split between her mother, her two brothers, and husband Jack Pickford. Pickford later relinquished his right to a portion of the money, choosing instead to give his share to Thomas&#x27;s mother.

On November 22, 1920, the bulk of Thomas&#x27;s personal property was auctioned off in an estate sale, which netted approximately $30,000. Lewis Selznick bought Thomas&#x27;s town car for an undisclosed sum. Mabel Normand bought a 20-piece toilet set, a 14-karat gold cigarette case, and three pieces of jewelry, including a sapphire pin.

==Aftermath==
The press coverage of Olive Thomas&#x27;s death was one of the first examples of the media sensationalism related to a major Hollywood star. Her death has been cited as one of the first major Hollywood scandals.

Other scandals around the time—including the Fatty Arbuckle trial in 1921, the murder of William Desmond Taylor in 1922, and the drug-related death of Wallace Reid in 1923—caused many religious and morality groups to label Hollywood as &quot;immoral&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* A legend that Thomas’s ghost haunts the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City arose in the years following her death.
* In 2004, with funding from Timeline Films, and with the help of Hugh Hefner and his film preservation organization, Sarah J. Baker premiered her documentary on Olive Thomas&#x27;s life, titled &quot;Olive Thomas: Everybody&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;.
* In 2007, Michelle Vogel wrote a biography titled, &quot;Olive Thomas: The Life and Death of a Silent Film Beauty&quot;, published by McFarland Publishing Company.
* &quot;Ghostlight&quot;, a musical about the life of Olive Thomas, was written by Matthew Martin and Tim Realbuto. &quot;Ghostlight&quot; opened in New York City at the Signature Theatre on September 26, 2011, and was presented by the New York Musical Theatre Festival. It starred Drama Desk Award winner Rachel York as Billie Burke, Tony nominee Michael Hayden as Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., Tony Award winner Daisy Eagan as Molly Cook, Kimberly Faye Greenberg as Fanny Brice, Matt Leisy as Jack Pickford, and newcomer Rachael Fogle in the leading role of Olive Thomas.
* In 2015, novelist Laini Giles released a fictionalized biography of Olive titled &quot;The Forgotten Flapper&quot;. Based completely on factual information, it goes from her poor roots in Pennsylvania to her death, and is narrated by her ghost, now haunting the New Amsterdam Theatre.

<doc id="592447" wikidata="Q272146" url="?curid=592447" title="Michael Porter">
<text>Michael Eugene Porter (born May 23, 1947) is an American businessman and professor at Harvard Business School. He was one of the founders of the consulting firm The Monitor Group (now part of Deloitte) and FSG, a social impact consultancy. He is credited with creating Porter&#x27;s five forces analysis, a widely-used management framework. He is generally regarded as the father of the modern strategy field. He is also regarded as one of the world&#x27;s most influential thinkers on management and competitiveness as well as one of the most influential business strategists. His work has been recognized by governments, non-governmental organizations and universities.

==Early life and education==
Michael Porter&#x27;s father was a civil engineer and Georgia Tech graduate who had also gone on to a career as an army officer. During Porter&#x27;s childhood, his family moved around the United States, and to France and Canada. This contributed to Porter&#x27;s interest in understanding the economic development of regions and countries, and the differences in economic outcomes and competitiveness across different regions.

Porter said in an interview that he first became interested in competition through sports. He was on the NCAA championship golf squad at Princeton and also played football, baseball and basketball growing up.

Porter received a BSE with high honors in aerospace and mechanical engineering from Princeton University in 1969, where he graduated first in his class and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Tau Beta Pi. He received an MBA with high distinction in 1971 from Harvard Business School (HBS), where he was a George F. Baker Scholar, and a PhD in business economics from Harvard University in 1973. Porter credits Harvard professor Roland &quot;Chris&quot; Christensen with inspiring him and encouraging him to speak up during class. Porter reached the top of his class by his second year at HBS.

==Career==
Porter developed the Porter five forces analysis framework for analyzing industries, inspired by classes in industrial organization economics that he took at Harvard.

During his career, Porter has emphasized that the essence of strategy is about making choices. He has delivered public speaking based on the importance of strategy formulation and has served as a consultant to many governments and NGOs devising strategy formulations.

Porter is the author of 20 books and numerous articles including &quot;Competitive Strategy&quot;, &quot;Competitive Advantage&quot;, &quot;Competitive Advantage of Nations&quot;, and &quot;On Competition&quot;, and is the most cited author in business and economics.

===Competition among nations===
==== Competitive Advantage ====
Porter wrote &quot;The Competitive Advantage of Nations&quot; in 1990. The book is based on studies of ten nations and argues that a key to national wealth and advantage was the productivity of firms and workers collectively, and that the national and regional environment supports that productivity. He proposed the &quot;diamond&quot; framework, a mutually-reinforcing system of four factors that determine national advantage: factor conditions; demand conditions; related or supporting industries; and firm strategy, structure and rivalry. Information, incentives, and infrastructure were also key to that productivity.

During April 2014, Porter discussed how the US ranks relative to other countries on a comprehensive scorecard called &quot;The Social Progress Index&quot;, an effort which he co-authored. This scorecard rated the US on a comprehensive set of metrics; overall, the US placed 16th.

Michael Porter defined the two ways in which an organization can achieve competitive advantage over its rivals: cost advantage and differentiation advantage. Cost advantage is when a business provides the same products and services as its competitors, albeit at a lesser cost. Differentiation advantage is when a business provides better products and services as its competitors. In Porter&#x27;s view, strategic management should be concerned with building and sustaining competitive advantage. He originally developed the Porter&#x27;s Five Forces in 1979 which is still widely used as a model to analyse the industry and to estimate whether it would be profitable and ideal enough to enter the industry after carefully examining the bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, threat of new entrants, competition among existing firms and threat of substitutes. He first wrote and published about Porter&#x27;s Five Forces in a 1979 article &quot;How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy&quot; and has further explained about the Five Forces in his 1980 article &quot;Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors.&quot;

Porter introduced the concept of competitive advantage in 1985. which later went onto become one of the key concepts in management science at present. He also published a book titled &quot;Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance&quot; in order to explain the concept of competitive advantage and the book which later went onto become a bestseller also focuses on value chain concept.

==== Value chain ====
Porter introduced the concept of value chain analysis in his 1985 book, &quot;Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance&quot;. The value chain comprises each of the activities, from design through distribution, that a company performs to produce a product; these activities are viewed as the “basic units of competitive advantage&quot;.

===Health care===
Porter has focused on addressing pressing problems in health care delivery in the US and other countries. His book, &quot;Redefining Health Care&quot; (written with Elizabeth Teisberg), develops a new strategic framework for transforming the value delivered by the health care system, with implications for providers, health plans, employers, and government, among other actors. The book received the James A. Hamilton award of the American College of Healthcare Executives in 2007 for book of the year. His &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; research article, &quot;A Strategy for Health Care ReformToward a Value-Based System&quot; (July 2009), lays out a health reform strategy for the US. His work on health care is employed to address the health care delivery problems in developing countries, in collaboration with Dr. Jim Yong Kim, Dr. Kevin J. Bozic, and others at the Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health.

===Consulting===
Porter acting as a consultant to business, government, and the social sector. He has been a strategy advisor to US and international companies, including Caterpillar, Procter &amp; Gamble, Scotts Miracle-Gro, Royal Dutch Shell, and Taiwan Semiconductor. The Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administración of Venezuela was influenced under the guidance of Porter, taught American business administration. Porter has served on two public boards of directors, those of Thermo Fisher Scientific and Parametric Technology Corporation. He influence economic policy, working with the Executive Branch and with Congress, and has led national economic-strategy programs in other countries. , he was working with the presidents of Rwanda and South Korea.

In 1983, Porter co-founded the Monitor Group, a strategy-consulting firm acquired by Deloitte Consulting in 2013 through a structured bankruptcy proceeding.

===Non-profit===
Michael Porter has founded four major non-profit organizations: Initiative for a Competitive Inner City – ICIC, founded in 1994, and which he still chairs, which addresses economic development in distressed urban communities; the Center for Effective Philanthropy, which creates rigorous tools for measuring foundation effectiveness; FSG Social Impact Advisors, a leading non-profit strategy firm which he co-founded with Mark Kramer, serving NGOs, corporations, and foundations in the area of creating social value; and International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurements (ICHOM), which he co-founded in 2012 with Stefan Larsson and Martin Ingvar. ICHOM supports the key strategic agenda items in Porter&#x27;s Value-Based Health Care Delivery framework by working with patients and leading healthcare providers to create a global standard for measuring health outcomes. He also currently serves on the Board of Trustees of Princeton University.

=== Politics ===
An analysis by Porter in collaboration with Katherine Gehl frames the US two-party system as a duopoly, a business best described as a &quot;political industry&quot;, that competes in ways that serve the parties&#x27; interests rather than the public good. Gehl and Porter published a Harvard Business School report on the topic, &quot;Why Competition in the Politics Industry is Failing America&quot; (2017), and later a book, &quot;The Politics Industry: How Political Innovation Can Break Partisan Gridlock and Save Our Democrac&quot;y (2020).

==Honors and awards==
In 2000, Michael Porter was appointed Bishop William Lawrence University Professor at Harvard, the university&#x27;s highest recognition awarded to Harvard faculty. He is a six-time winner of the McKinsey Award for the best &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; article of the year.

==Criticisms==
Porter&#x27;s work has received criticism from peers within academia for inconsistent logical argument in his assertions. 
Porter&#x27;s conclusions have been critiqued as &quot;lacking in empirical support&quot; and as &quot;justified with selective case studies&quot;. These critiques assert that Porter fails to credit original creators of his postulates originating from pure microeconomic theory.

== Legacy ==
He has written numerous books on modern competitive strategy for business. His concepts and theories with regards to strategic management, such as Porter&#x27;s Five Forces, Porter&#x27;s Diamond model, Porter&#x27;s Generic Strategies and Porter&#x27;s Value Chain, are widely taught in universities.

Porter stated in a 2010 interview: &quot;What I&#x27;ve come to see as probably my greatest gift is the ability to take an extraordinarily complex, integrated, multidimensional problem and get arms around it conceptually in a way that helps, that informs and empowers practitioners to actually do things.&quot;

<text>Walter Maxfield Lea (February 10, 1874 – January 10, 1936) was a Prince Edward Island politician.

A farmer and livestock breeder by profession, Lea was born in Tryon, the son of William C. Lea and Annie Murphy. He was elected to the provincial House of Assembly in 1915 as a Liberal and became commissioner of agriculture in 1919. In 1930 Lea became premier when his predecessor was appointed to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island but the Great Depression took a toll on the government&#x27;s popularity and he lost the election the next year to the rival Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island.

Lea rebuilt the party while in opposition and in 1935 the Liberals won all 30 seats in the legislature, the first time such a thing had ever happened in the British Empire. Lea had been ill during the campaign, however, and died in office at the Prince Edward Island Hospital in Charlottetown on January 10, 1936.

He married Helena Esma Maude Mary Rodgerson in 1899. His daughter Marion married Walter Fitz-Alan Stewart.

<text>Pierre-Simon Ballanche (4 August 1776 – 12 June 1847) was a French writer and counterrevolutionary philosopher, who elaborated a theology of progress that possessed considerable influence in French literary circles in the beginning of the nineteenth century. He was the ninth member elected to occupy seat 4 of the Académie française in 1842.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Born in Lyon, Ballanche was seventeen when his imagination was marked for life by the horrors of the French Revolution. In 1793, the city&#x27;s royalist revolt against the authority of the revolutionary Convention ended with guillotining or summary execution of about 700 people. This, and an unhappy love affair early in life, left him with an abidingly tragic view of life as sanctified suffering, a view that he embodied in his works, of which the best known was an unfinished multi-part work entitled &quot;Essais de palingénésie sociale&quot; (&quot;Essays on Social Palingenesis&quot;). &quot;Palingenesis&quot; was a term by which Ballanche referred to the successive regenerations of the society, and he incorporated a progressive vision of Christianity in his work even as he insisted reverently that Christianity was forever immutable.

===Career===
Ballanche first earned his living as a printer. His first published work was &quot;Du sentiment considéré dans son rapport avec la littérature&quot; (1802), a work in the vein of Chateaubriand&#x27;s recently published &quot;Génie du christianisme&quot;. He made the acquaintance of Julie Récamier in 1812, and moved to Paris shortly thereafter, where he attended regularly her salon at l&#x27;Abbaye-aux-Bois.

In works like &quot;Antigone&quot; (1814), &quot;Essais sur les institutions sociales&quot; (&quot;Essay on Social Institutions&quot;, 1818), &quot;Le Vieillard et le jeune homme&quot; (&quot;The Old Man and the Youth&quot;, 1819), &quot;L&#x27;Homme sans nom&quot; (&quot;The Man without a Name&quot;, 1820) and &quot;Élégie&quot; (&quot;Elegy&quot;, 1820), he developed the idea that the French Revolution was endowed with a divine significance. Such a view was common enough in counterrevolutionary circles. But unlike religious thinkers who conferred upon the Church the task of interpreting this significance, Ballanche developed a theory of language. In Ballanche&#x27;s view, to name something was in some way to participate in creation. For Ballanche, this creative power of speech had the same essence as poetry, and he developed a poetics of the symbol that played a role in the thinking of those who gave birth to a new vision of the poet and of poetry that soon came to be known as romanticism.

Ballanche&#x27;s life work, never finished, is generally known as &quot;Palingénésie&quot;. The idea of this &quot;great work&quot; germinated in him in the 1820s, and he announced what was intended to be a vast philosophico-poetic epic of the past, present and future in its opening volume, &quot;Prolégomènes&quot;, published in 1827. There he described his ambition to write &quot;the true history of the human race&quot;. The first volume dealt with Greece in &quot;Orphée&quot; (&quot;Orpheus&quot;, 1829), and the second, never finished, with the Roman Republic in &quot;Formule générale de l&#x27;histoire de tous les peuples appliquée à l&#x27;histoire du peuple romain&quot; (&quot;General Formula of the History of All Peoples Applied to the History of the Roman People&quot;), fragments of which were published in reviews from 1829 to 1834. The third and final volume, which was never finished, was first announced to be &quot;La Ville des expiations&quot; (&quot;The City of Expiations&quot;), though Ballanche published &quot;La Vision d&#x27;Hébal&quot; (&quot;Hébal&#x27;s Vision&quot;, 1831). Because Ballanche&#x27;s thought continued to develop in the 1830s and 1840s he changed plans for the work many times, and the history of his works is enormously complicated and confusing.

In a sense, this was because of Ballanche&#x27;s awareness of the difficulty of the task he had set himself. He never worked out his system to his own satisfaction. The turbulence of nineteenth-century French history constantly gave him new food for thought. It is possible, however, to sketch the elements of his fundamental vision.

===Philosophy===

Ballanche&#x27;s highly original system was a working out of the notion of &quot;progress through ordeals&quot;. In a sense, his thought is a secular version of Fall and Redemption, adapted to a theological progressivism – an &quot;optimistic theory of original sin and its consequences&quot;, in the words of Paul Bénichou, who has written extensively on Ballanche&#x27;s historical importance in &quot;Le Sacre de l&#x27;écrivain&quot; (1973), &quot;Le Temps des prophètes&quot; (1977) and &quot;Le Grand Œuvre de Ballanche&quot;, &quot;Revue d&#x27;histoire littéraire de la France&quot; (Sept.-Oct. 1975), collected in &quot;Variétés critiques&quot; (1996).

For Ballanche, a particular form of political authority – Louis XVI, for example – could be doomed to fall without being contemptible. The historical vision that he was developing, and which he expressed in a symbolic language that many found difficult, was one in which a past epoch could possess its own rightness and legitimacy, even as it had lost the right to continue.

Ballanche compared himself to Janus, the two-headed god of mythology, because he looked simultaneously in two different directions. His tragic view of history embraced change, while regarding the means by which it was accomplished as the source of an endless need for future expiation.

==Legacy==
Ballanche occupied – and continues to occupy – an uneasy borderland between progressive and counterrevolutionary camps. He dreamed of himself, timidly, as the one who could reconcile them. But this was not to be: his view of the social order as supernatural in character was not intelligible (or not acceptable) to those on the left, and his willingness to acknowledge the legitimacy of radical change did not endear him to those on the right.

<text>Robert Barton Englund (born June 6, 1947) is an American actor and director. Englund is best known for playing the villain Freddy Krueger in the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; franchise and Willie in the &quot;V&quot; television franchise (1983–1985). Englund has received multiple accolades and honors, including a Saturn Award, a Fangoria Chainsaw Award, as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Classically trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Englund began his career as a stage actor in regional theatre and made his film debut in &quot;Buster and Billie&quot; (1974), followed by supporting roles in films such as &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; (1976), &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1976), and &quot;Big Wednesday&quot; (1978). Englund had his breakthrough as the resistance fighter Willie in the miniseries &quot;V&quot; in 1983. Following his performance in the original &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984), he became closely associated with the horror film genre, and is widely regarded as one of its iconic actors. He reprised his role as Freddy in seven sequels, as well as the horror anthology series &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot; (1988–1990).

==Early life==
Englund was born on June 6, 1947, in Glendale, California, the son of Janis (née MacDonald) and Clyde Kent Englund, an aeronautics engineer who helped develop the Lockheed U-2 airplane. He is of part Swedish and Scottish ancestry. Englund began studying acting at the age of twelve, accompanying a friend to a children&#x27;s theater program at California State University, Northridge.

While in high school, he attended &quot;Cranbrook Theatre School&quot; (organized by the Cranbrook Educational Community) in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. He then attended UCLA for three years, before dropping out and transferring to Michigan&#x27;s Oakland University, where he trained at the Meadow Brook Theater, at the time a branch of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

Englund had five successful years performing in regional theater including plays by Shakespeare and Bernard Shaw. He married for the first time in 1966 to a nurse Elizabeth Gardner. Shortly afterward, he returned to the West Coast in search of film work, and landed a supporting role in the film &quot;Buster and Billie&quot;, directed by Daniel Petrie.

==Career==
In 1976, Englund auditioned for the roles of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker in &quot;Star Wars.&quot; While he didn&#x27;t get either part, he suggested Mark Hamill for the role of Luke. Englund appeared in the 1977 film &quot;Eaten Alive&quot; directed by Tobe Hooper. He then played Ranger in &quot;Galaxy of Terror,&quot; produced by Roger Corman, which was released in 1981. Since then, Englund has made over 100 appearances on film and television. In his early film roles, Englund was usually cast as a nerd or a redneck, and he first gained attention in the role of Visitor technician and resistance fighter Willie in the 1983 miniseries &quot;V,&quot; as well as the 1984 sequel &quot;V: The Final Battle,&quot; and &quot;V: The Series,&quot; in which he was a regular cast member.

Englund went against type when he accepted the role of Freddy Krueger, the psychopathic burn victim and child murderer in Wes Craven&#x27;s hugely successful &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; in 1984. He reprised his role as Freddy Krueger in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1985), &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; (1987), &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot; (1988), &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child&quot; (1989), &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot; (1991), &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot; (1994) and &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; (2003). His association with the genre led him to top-billed roles in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1989), &quot;The Mangler&quot; (1995) – another film directed by Tobe Hooper, and &quot;2001 Maniacs&quot; (2005).
Englund&#x27;s portrayal of Freddy Krueger is notable for its longevity, with Englund playing the same character in eight consecutive films. Englund has said that he enjoys the role of Freddy as it gives him a break from always acting out the nice guy; indeed, many people who have worked with Englund attest to his congeniality. Makeup artists responsible for the Krueger makeup have commented that Englund was so friendly and talkative that it made the lengthy makeup application slightly more challenging.

Englund&#x27;s TV appearances include starring in the short-lived series &quot;Nightmare Cafe&quot; (1992), in which he played Blackie, the mysterious proprietor of the title cafe, and reprising his role of &quot;Freddy Krueger&quot; in the series &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares – A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Series&quot;. His guest roles include the science fiction series &quot;Babylon 5,&quot; one episode of the show &quot;MacGyver&quot; as Tim Wexler, &quot;Masters of Horror,&quot; &quot;MadTV,&quot; &quot;Sliders,&quot; and &quot;Knight Rider,&quot; where he appeared as a phantom haunting a film studio, and &quot;Walking Tall: The Series&quot; as well as a guest star spot on the hit TV show &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;.

His work in voice-over animation includes magician Felix Faust in &quot;Justice League,&quot; The Riddler on &quot;The Batman,&quot; The Vulture on &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man,&quot; and as Dormammu on &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show.&quot; On the TV witch drama &quot;Charmed&quot; (Episode: &quot;Size Matters&quot;), he appeared as a demon who used the services of a lackey to lure people into a decrepit household (where he lived in the walls) and shrank them down to action figure size. He also appeared on an episode of &quot;Married... with Children&quot; as The Devil. Another appearance was in a 2010 season episode of the television spy send-up &quot;Chuck&quot;, as a scientist who created a fear-inducing nerve toxin, a similar character to the Scarecrow, one of Batman&#x27;s enemies in the DC Comics (A character he later portrayed in the video game &quot;Injustice 2&quot;).

Englund performed as host of the Horror Hall of Fame awards show three times, from 1990 to 1992.
Englund made his directorial debut with the 1988 horror film &quot;976-EVIL&quot;, co-written by future Oscar winner Brian Helgeland and starring Stephen Geoffreys. During production, Englund met set decorator Nancy Booth, whom he married. His second feature, &quot;Killer Pad,&quot; was released direct-to-DVD in 2008. During July 2013, he was in pre-production to direct &quot;The Vij&quot;, about a young priest who is led by an evil genie to commit murder, and who falls in love with an old witch who is not what she seems.

Englund also directed 2 episodes of “Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares”. The first was “Cabin Fever” and the second “Monkey Dreams”.

His memoir, &quot;Hollywood Monster: A Walk Down Elm Street with the Man of Your Dreams,&quot; which Alan Goldsher transcribed from his dictations, was published by Pocket Books on October 13, 2009.

He had also starred in the web series &quot;Fear Clinic&quot;, where he appeared in five episodes as Dr. Andover.

Englund noted he would welcome a guest appearance in the ABC revival of &quot;V&quot; in an interview with Todd Sokolove from &quot;Forces of Geek&quot;. But the series was canceled before he could make such a guest appearance.

In January 2010, it was announced that Englund would return as Jackson Roth for the sequel to Dee Snider&#x27;s &quot;Strangeland,&quot; titled &quot;Strangeland II: Disciple.&quot; However, as of December 2010, no specific dates or plans had been made regarding the project.

Englund made a guest appearance in &quot;The Death of the Queen Bee&quot; episode of &quot;Bones,&quot; appearing as a quirky janitor at protagonist Dr. Temperance Brennan&#x27;s old high school. His character, a friend of Brennan&#x27;s, and situation were introduced as &quot;very creepy... it&#x27;s like Freddy creepy.&quot; Englund was a special guest at the 2010 Streamy Awards, and also appeared as a special guest of the CA Weekend of Horrors on October 8, 2010.

Englund appeared on the Creation Entertainment Weekend of Horrors in May 2010. In May 2010, he was signed for the American independent thriller &quot;Inkubus.&quot;
Englund appeared as himself in the &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; Zombies map, &quot;Call of the Dead&quot; as one of the playable characters, and acted out the part of a Halloween-themed serial killer in the 2010s revival of &quot;Hawaii Five-0.&quot; He also took part in a Halloween &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot; for Channel 4 in 2012. He also appeared in &quot;Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer&quot; and &quot;Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon&quot;.

Although the character of Freddy Krueger is regarded as one of the most terrifying in cinema history, Englund is often described by fellow actors and film crews as being extremely friendly and appreciative of his fans, many admitting that his portrayal of Krueger frightened them as children.

He starred in &quot;The Last Showing&quot; and &quot;Fear Clinic&quot;, the latter was released on October 22, 2014, at the Screamfest Film Festival. Englund was also a special guest at Shock Comic Con on Valentine&#x27;s Day 2015. In February 2016, Englund hosted a &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; marathon on El Rey Network.

Englund was featured in the 2019 documentary &quot;Scream, Queen! My Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, which examines the LGBT themes of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and the life of actor Mark Patton.

As of 2020, Englund has been hosting the Travel Channel show &quot;True Terror with Robert Englund&quot;, which showcases scary but true stories about the supernatural or strange.

In 2022, Englund appeared in the fourth season of the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot; as Pennhurst Mental Hospital patient Victor Creel. In keeping with the series&#x27; 1980&#x27;s setting and homages, the character&#x27;s first appearance includes a nod to Englund&#x27;s most famous character.

<text>An ephod (; or ) was a type of apron that, according to the Hebrew Bible, was worn by the High Priest of Israel, an artifact and an object to be revered in ancient Israelite culture, and was closely connected with oracular practices and priestly ritual.

In the Books of Samuel and Books of Chronicles, David is described as wearing an ephod when dancing in the presence of the Ark of the Covenant (2 Samuel 6:14, 1 Chronicles 15:27) and one is described as standing in the sanctuary at Nob, with a sword behind it (1 Samuel 21:9). In the book of Exodus and the Book of Leviticus, one is described as being created for the High Priest to wear as part of his official vestments (Exodus 28:4+, 29:5, 39:2+; Leviticus 8:7).

==Description==
In the Bible, in the contexts where it is worn, the ephod is usually described as being linen, but did not constitute complete clothing of any kind, as the Books of Samuel describe. 1 Chronicles 15 states that David was &quot;clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark... [and] David also wore an ephod of linen,&quot; and 2 Samuel 6:14 that &quot;David was wearing a linen ephod&quot;. There appears to have been a strong religious and ceremonial implication to wearing an ephod, since the 85 priests at Nob are specifically identified as being the type of people who wore an ephod; though the Masoretic Text here describes them as being &quot;linen ephods&quot; (1 Samuel 22:18) the word &quot;linen&quot; is not present in the Septuagint version of the passage, nor is it present when the Septuagint describes David and Samuel as girding themselves with an ephod. Therefore, some textual scholars regard its presence in the Masoretic Text as a later editorial gloss.

==Wearing and composition==
A passage in the Book of Exodus describes the Ephod as an elaborate garment worn by the high priest, and upon which the Priestly breastplate containing the Urim and Thummim rested. According to this description, the Ephod was woven out of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet threads, was made of fine linen and was embroidered with skillful work in gold thread (). Gideon is additionally described as creating an ephod made up of 1700 shekels of gold (). Tractate Yoma 72a argues that each of the textures was combined in six threads with a seventh of gold leaf, making 28 threads to the texture in total.

The biblical description (Exodus 28:16, 39:9) continues describing the size of the breastplate which is affixed to the front of the ephod as a square measuring one span by one span (the width of an outstretched hand from little finger tip to outstretched thumb tip). Stating that it was held together by a girdle, and had two shoulder straps which were fastened to the front of the ephod by golden rings, to which the breastplate was attached by golden chains (). From this description, it appears to have been something like an apron or skirt with braces, though Rashi argued that it was like a woman&#x27;s riding girdle. The biblical description also adds that there were two engraved gems over the shoulder straps like epaulettes made from &quot;shoham&quot;. This is thought by scholars to mean malachite, by Jewish tradition to mean heliodor, and in the King James Version translated as &quot;onyx&quot;, and with the names of the 12 tribes written upon them; the classical rabbinical sources differ as to the order in which the tribes were named on the jewels (Sotah 36a).

==Origins==
Critical textual scholars attribute the description of the Ephod in Exodus to the priestly source and a date later than the other mentions of the ephod; biblical scholars believe that the ephod may have evolved into this highly ceremonial form from more primitive beginnings (the simple linen form described in the Books of Samuel), much like how the highly liturgical maniple evolved from an ordinary handkerchief.

==Extended uses==

Besides its use as a garment, an Ephod was also used for oracular purposes, in conjunction with Urim and Thummim; the Books of Samuel imply that whenever Saul or David wished to question God via oracular methods, they asked a priest for the ephod. Since the oracular process is considered by scholars to have been one of cleromancy, with the Urim and Thummim being the objects which were drawn as lots, the ephod is considered by scholars to have been some form of container for the Urim and Thummim; to harmonise this with the descriptions of the ephod as a garment, it is necessary to conclude that the ephod must have originally been some sort of pocket, which the priests &quot;girded&quot; to themselves. However, the biblical text states the Urim and Thummim were placed in the breastplate, not the ephod, in Leviticus 8:8. The integration of the stones in the breastplate, as well as the Hebrew usage of Urim as &quot;lights,&quot; suggest that the Urim and Thummim may have been a type of ocular device through which the priest would look when receiving divine communication.

The object at Nob, which must have been somewhat freestanding since another object was kept behind it, and the objects made by Gideon and by Micah from molten gold, logically cannot have just been garments. The object made by Gideon is plainly described as having been worshipped, and therefore the cult image of a deity, while the object made by Micah is closely associated with a teraphim, and the ephod and teraphim are described interchangeably with the Hebrew terms &quot;pesel&quot; and &quot;massekah&quot;, meaning &quot;graven image&quot;, and &quot;molten image&quot;, respectively.

Even the ephods used for oracular purposes were not necessarily just pieces of cloth, as they are not described as being worn, but carried (though some translations render 1 Samuel 2:28 as &quot;wear an ephod&#x27;&quot; rather than &quot;carry an ephod&quot;); the Hebrew term used in these passages for &quot;carry&quot; specifically implies that the ephod was carried either in the hand or on the shoulder. The conclusion thus is that the ephod in these cases referred to a portable idol the lots were cast in front of. Some scholars have suggested that the connection between the idol and the garment is that the idol was originally clothed in a linen garment, and the term ephod gradually came to describe the idol as a whole.

According to the Talmud, the wearing of the ephod atoned for the sin of idolatry on the part of the Israelites.

Gideon went on to make an ephod out of the gold won in battle; according to Ginzberg&#x27;s &quot;The Legends of the Jews&quot;: &quot;In the high priest&#x27;s breastplate, Joseph was represented among the twelve tribes by Ephraim alone, not by Manasseh, too. To wipe out this slight upon his own tribe, Gideon made an ephod bearing the name of Manasseh. He consecrated it to God, but after his death homage was paid to it as an idol. In those days the Israelites were so addicted to the worship of Beelzebub that they constantly carried small images of this god with them in their pockets, and every now and then they were in the habit of bringing the image forth and kissing it fervently.&quot; According to the Bible, this action eventually caused the whole of Israel to turn away from God yet again and the ruin of Gideon and his family. Gideon had 70 sons from the many women he took as wives. He also had a Shechemite concubine who bore him a son he named Abimelech, which means &quot;my father is king&quot; ().

==In apocryphal literature==

According to the ancient apocryphal &quot;Lives of the Prophets&quot;, after the death of Zechariah ben Jehoiada, the priests of the Temple could no longer see the apparitions of the angel of the Lord, make divinations with the Ephod, or give responses from the Holy of Holies.

<doc id="592456" wikidata="Q656530" url="?curid=592456" title="This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours">
<text>This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours is the fifth studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 14 September 1998 by Epic Records.

Like its 1996 predecessor &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;, &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; was a commercial and critical success. The album debuted at number 1 in the UK Albums Chart, selling 136,000 copies, going Gold in the first week. It sold well in the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia, and represented a change in the sound from the furious alternative rock sound to a more melodic and tender approach. By March 1999 the album was Triple Platinum in the UK alone and since its release it has sold more than five million copies worldwide. It earned the band further nominations and accolades at the BRIT Awards in 1999. This is their first album whose lyrics were solely written by bassist Nicky Wire; and not featured any contribution from the late rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards.

== Music and lyrics ==

The title is a quotation taken from a speech given by Aneurin Bevan, a Labour Party politician from Wales. Its working title was simply &quot;Manic Street Preachers&quot;. The cover photograph was taken on Black Rock Sands near Porthmadog, Wales.

It was the first Manics album to feature lyrics solely by Nicky Wire, while all the music was written by the duo of James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore. &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; shows considerably less hard rock influence than their previous efforts and finds the band experimenting with sound and production techniques. It features cleaner guitar sounds in general and the increased use of additional instrumentation such as strings, keyboards and both real and programmed percussion. &quot;Clash&quot; magazine described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;a glacial distillation of the anthemic rock that had served them so well two years previous&quot;, an approach further developed on 2004&#x27;s &quot;Lifeblood&quot;.

In an interview Dave Eringa admitted that: &quot;James was piling on the pressure at the time. He&#x27;s got this idea that I work best under pressure; it&#x27;s about putting me under as much as he can all the time!&quot;. After recording &quot;If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next&quot;, he also said that the song went through a four-month gestation period.

Eringa said that even in the week of release he was nervous: &quot;You get midweek chart positions and sales figures all week, and it was my first chance of a possible Number One, which is such an exciting thing. Every day it was just getting worse and worse; I was becoming more and more psychotic. If it had been released the same week as a Nirvana record or an Oasis record, you&#x27;d just have to put your hands up and say &#x27;c&#x27;est la vie&#x27; – but the horror of losing out to Steps would have been unbelievable!&quot;. James Dean Bradfield has cited John Frusciante as the main influence for the intro riff of &quot;My Little Empire&quot;.

== Release ==

The album was preceded by the single &quot;If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next&quot;, released on 24 August 1998, which debuted at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, their first single to do so. The album itself was released on 14 September 1998, and its sales were such that a spokesperson for Virgin Megastores claimed it to be the biggest selling album of the year. It reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, becoming their only album to do so until &quot;The Ultra Vivid Lament&quot; reached the same position in 2021. Like the preceding single, &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; prevented Steps from topping the chart; &quot;One for Sorrow&quot; was held off at No. 2 by &quot;If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next&quot; while the album &quot;Step One&quot; was also relegated to No. 2. The album remained at the top of the albums chart for three weeks, selling around 250,000 copies in those three weeks. The album has been certified Triple Platinum in the UK and spent a total time of 75 weeks on the UK Albums Chart Top 100.

Apart from the lead single, the album presented another three singles, with the second one being &quot;The Everlasting&quot;, issued on 30 November 1998. &quot;You Stole the Sun from My Heart&quot; was released on 8 March 1999 and was nominated for Best British Single at the 2000 BRIT Awards. The final single from the album, issued on 5 July 1999, was &quot;Tsunami&quot;, which was inspired by the Silent Twins, June and Jennifer Gibbons, who gave up speaking when they were young, became involved in crime and ended up being sent to Broadmoor Hospital. Both singles &quot;The Everlasting&quot; and &quot;Tsunami&quot; peaked at number 11, while &quot;You Stole the Sun from My Heart&quot; ended up peaking at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart. In Japan, the band released another single, &quot;Nobody Loved You&quot;, on 9 December 1998.

Around the world the album was as successful as it was in the UK. In Sweden the album managed to remain in the chart for a total of 43 weeks, debuting at number 2, and peaking at number one in its second week. In Finland the album sold enough to stay in the charts for 32 weeks, peaking at number one, securing the top spot for two consecutive weeks. In Ireland the album also debuted at number one and charted within the top 20 in Norway, New Zealand, Denmark, Austria and Australia. It was the number one album in Europe&#x27;s for two weeks, and it has been certified Platinum (one million copies) by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. The album&#x27;s success ensured that by 1999 the band had sold more than three million albums worldwide. To the present day &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; has sold more than five million copies since its release.

On 7 December 2018, &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; was re-released as a &#x27;20 Year Collector&#x27;s Edition&#x27; on streaming services, as well as physically on three CDs and two LPs. As well as being remastered, the track listing was revised, with &quot;Nobody Loved You&quot; replaced by the former B-side &quot;Prologue to History&quot;. The CD and streaming releases also include various demos, B-sides and remixes.

== Controversy ==

The album&#x27;s final track, &quot;S.Y.M.M.&quot; is an initialism for &quot;South Yorkshire Mass Murderer&quot;. The title is a reference to actions of South Yorkshire Police in the Hillsborough disaster of 1989, in which 97 people died in a human crush during an association football match at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield. Although he admitted to not having heard the song, the title was criticised by South Yorkshire&#x27;s then Assistant Chief Constable, Ian Daines as &quot;offensive&quot; and &quot;bad taste&quot;. At the time of the album&#x27;s release, the actions of the police were the subject of a long-running and ongoing private prosecution by the Hillsborough Families Support Group. However the track was praised by Jimmy McGovern, who is name-checked in the song itself. McGovern stated that he felt the sentiment of the song was &quot;brilliant&quot; and that he was taken back by the &quot;power&quot; of the lyrics, adding &quot;I&#x27;ve heard those sentiments (how do you sleep at night, etc) expressed by many of the Hillsborough families&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
The album was generally well received by critics.

&quot;NME&quot; awarded the album with a 7/10, stating: &quot;No longer is James Dean Bradfield required to turn metrical somersaults in order to translate screeds of vituperative prose into the realm of the performable. Nicky&#x27;s opaque verses lend themselves more readily to poetic contemplation, and James responds with his most incontrovertibly delicate vocals, singing as opposed to lacerating his larynx in the quest for empathy.&quot;

Sputnikmusic wrote in 2014 that the album was &quot;the most indecisive piece of works [sic] in the Manic&#x27;s [sic] canon. Technically proficient and brilliantly written in spats&quot;, finishing with: &quot;Still, This Is My Truth&#x27;s spot as one of the bands [sic] weakest releases is often overstated, if only because the rot was just beginning and the future predicted a bigger storm to come.&quot;

Sarah Zupko, writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, said that the album was her &quot;album of the year so far&quot;, stating that &quot;The Manic Street Preachers are also one of the few groups capable of integrating orchestral instruments in a way that still produces great rock music (check out the cello in &quot;My Little Empire&quot;), always avoiding the schmaltzy elevator music that can result when some rock musos get a hold of an orchestra. Meanwhile, they manage to infuse some quite dour lyrics with some of the most haunting melodies in rock this side of Radiohead. Bradfield and Moore seldom choose the obvious chords, arrangements and melodies, resulting in music that is heads- and- tails above almost any band on the planet.&quot;

&quot;The Independent&quot; gave the album a positive review, saying that: &quot;In their first album as a true trio, the Manics deliver another slab of anthemic rock that manages to be gloomy yet uplifting. Their recent hit single is one of the more joyous moments here, but they also offer class introspection.&quot;

AllMusic praised the album, calling it &quot;a strangely effective fusion of string-drenched, sweeping arena rock and impassioned, brutally honest punk&quot;, noting that it contains &quot;a searing passion and intelligence that is unmatched among their peers on either side of the ocean – and, in doing so, it emphasizes the Manics&#x27; uniqueness as one of the few bands of the &#x27;90s that can deliver albums as bracing intellectually as they are sonically.&quot;

Among less positive comments &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a C−, concluding with: &quot;Their best efforts, particularly the 1994 screed called Holy Bible, were triumphs of sheer will and caustic attitude. Sadly, the albums made after his [Edwards&#x27;] departure prove the Preachers were, after all, a James gang. How else to explain such treacly dreck on This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours as &quot;You Stole the Sun From My Heart&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Tender and You&#x27;re Tired.&quot; This is my truth: The album is lucky to get a C−&quot;.

=== Awards ===

The album won Best British Album, and the band Best British Group, at the 1999 BRIT Awards. The album was nominated for the 1999 Mercury Prize, but just like the previous album it failed to win the award. In the NME Awards in 1999, the band won every single big prize, Best Band, Best Album, Best Live Act, Best Single and Best Video.

=== Accolades ===

The album was a critical success; on end-of-the-year critics lists it achieved the following accolades:

* It achieved number 14 in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Albums of the Year 1998.
* A spot in &quot;Q&quot; Magazine&#x27;s Albums of 1998.
* Placed at number 29 in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; End of Year Critic List for 1998.
* &quot;NME&quot; listed &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; as the 24th best album of 1998.
* &quot;Melody Maker&quot; also listed &quot;If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next&quot; as the sixth best single of the year.
* &quot;NME&quot; also named &quot;If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next&quot; the fifth best single of the year.

Reflecting on the album, &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; in 2008 said that &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; is &quot;sad&quot; and is a &quot;stately, tender lament to their past&quot; stating that: &quot;Just as the Holy Bible was Richey&#x27;s, this is Nicky&#x27;s more than anything; confused where Richey was focused, afraid of loneliness while Richey embraced it. You can&#x27;t escape the idea that he almost feels guilty for what they&#x27;d turned into, and that imbues This Is My Truth, Tell Me Yours with a sadness and longing that wasn&#x27;t immediately evident on its initial release.&quot;

Looking back on the catalogue of the band, &quot;Clash&quot; stated the following about the record: &quot;Misfiring album closer and Hillsborough referencing &#x27;S.Y.M.M.&#x27; was a rare error, brushing up against eternal favourites &#x27;You Stole The Sun From My Heart&#x27; and &#x27;Tsunami&#x27; and the delicate shimmer of &#x27;Black Dog on My Shoulder&#x27;, which more than make up for it. Although a little close to AOR with the preference for mid-paced melancholia, the Manics were now making grown up, actually rather beautiful music. Which, of course, couldn&#x27;t last.&quot;

The album is ranked number 987 in &quot;All-Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (3rd edition, 2000).

<doc id="592469" wikidata="Q5195069" url="?curid=592469" title="Current Population Survey">
<text>The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a monthly survey of about 60,000 U.S. households conducted by the United States Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS uses the data to publish reports early each month called the Employment Situation. This report provides estimates of the unemployment rate and the numbers of employed and unemployed people in the United States based on the CPS. A readable Employment Situation Summary is provided monthly. Annual estimates include employment and unemployment in large metropolitan areas. Researchers can use some CPS microdata to investigate these or other topics.

The survey asks about the employment status of each member of the household 15 years of age or older as of a particular calendar week. Based on responses to questions on work and job search activities, each person 16 years and over in a sample household is classified as employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force.

The CPS began in 1940, and responsibility for conducting the CPS was given to the Census Bureau in 1942. In 1994 the CPS was redesigned. CPS is a survey that is: employment-focused, enumerator-conducted, continuous, and cross-sectional. The BLS increased the sample size by 10,000 as of July 2001. The sample represents the civilian noninstitutional population.

==Methodology==
Approximately 60,000 households are eligible for the CPS. Sample households are selected by a multistage stratified statistical sampling scheme. A household is interviewed for 4 successive months, then not interviewed for 8 months, then returned to the sample for 4 months after that. An adult member of each household provides information for all members of the household.

As part of the demographic sample survey redesign, the CPS is redesigned once a decade, after the decennial census. The most recent CPS sample redesign began in April 2014.

Respondents are generally asked about their employment as of the week of the month that includes the 12th. To avoid holidays, this reference week is sometimes adjusted. All respondents are asked about the same week.

==Employment classification==

People are classified as employed if they did any work at all as paid employees during the reference week; worked in their own business, profession, or on their own farm; or worked without pay at least 15 hours in a family business or farm. People are also counted as employed if they were temporarily absent from their jobs because of illness, bad weather, vacation, labor-management disputes, or personal reasons.
People are classified as unemployed if they meet all of the following criteria: 
* They were not employed during the reference week
* They were available for work at that time
* They made specific efforts to find employment during the 4-week period ending with the reference week. (The exception to this category covers persons laid off from a job and expecting recall)

The unemployment data derived from the household survey doesn&#x27;t relate or depend on the eligibility of the worker to receive unemployment insurance benefits.

Those who are not classified as employed or unemployed are not counted as part of the labor force. These people—those who have no job and are not looking for one—are counted as &quot;not in the labor force&quot;. Many who are not in the labor force are going to school or are retired. Family responsibilities keep others out of the labor force. &quot;Discouraged workers&quot; are a subset of those who are &quot;not in the labor force&quot;.

==1994 revisions==
In 1994 the administration and questions in the CPS were overhauled. Prior to 1994, the alternate measures of unemployment had different names because the BLS drastically revised the questions in the CPS and renamed the measures: U3 and U4 were eliminated; the official rate U5 remained the same measure but was renamed U3; U6 and U7 were revised and renamed U5 and U6.

CPS-based measures of unemployment before 1994:
* U-1 Persons unemployed 15 weeks or longer, as a percent of the civilian labor force
* U-2 Job losers, as a percent of the civilian labor force
* U-3 Unemployed persons aged 25 and older, as a percent of the civilian labor force aged 25 and older (the unemployment rate for persons 25 and older)
* U-4 Unemployed persons seeking full-time jobs, as a percent of the full-time labor force (the unemployment rate for full-time workers)
* U-5 Total unemployed persons, as a percent of the civilian labor force (official unemployment rate)
* U-6 Total persons seeking full-time jobs, plus one-half of persons seeking part-time jobs, plus one-half of persons employed part-time for economic reasons, as a percent of the civilian labor force less one-half of the part-time labor force
* U-7 Total persons seeking full-time jobs, plus one-half of persons seeking part-time jobs, plus one-half of persons employed part-time for economic reasons, plus discouraged workers, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus discouraged workers less one-half of the part-time labor force

CPS-based measures of unemployment after 1994:
* U-1 Persons unemployed 15 weeks or longer, as a percent of the civilian labor force
* U-2 Job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs, as a percent of the civilian labor force
* U-3 Total unemployed, as a percent of the civilian labor force (official unemployment rate)
* U-4 Total unemployed plus discouraged workers, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus discouraged workers
* U-5 Total unemployed, plus discouraged workers, plus all other marginally attached workers, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all marginally attached workers
* U-6 Total unemployed, plus all marginally attached workers, plus total employed part-time for economic reasons, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all marginally attached workers

Marginally attached workers are persons who currently are neither working nor looking for work but indicate that they want and are available for a job and have looked for work in the recent past. In addition, marginally attached workers have actively sought work in the past 12 months (e.g. they replied to a &quot;wanted&quot; ad) but have not actively sought work in the past 4 weeks.

Discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached, have given a job-market related reason for not currently looking for a job (e.g. they believe that no work was available). This group is about 50 percent smaller than the marginally attached group.&quot; Persons employed part-time for economic reasons are those who want full-time work and are available to take a full-time job; they are sometimes said to be underemployed.

==Data available==
The CPS reports:
* Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population 16 years and over by age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, family relationship, and Vietnam-era veteran status.
* Employed persons by occupation, industry, and class of worker, hours of work, full- or part-time status, and reasons for working part-time.
* Employed multiple jobholders by occupation, industry, numbers of jobs held, and full- or part-time status of multiple jobs.
* Unemployed persons by occupation, industry, class of worker of last job, duration of unemployment, reason for unemployment, and methods used to find employment.
* Discouraged workers and other persons not in the labor force.
* Special topics such as the labor force status of particular subgroups of the population (e g., women maintaining families, working women with children, displaced workers, and disabled veterans).
* Work experience, occupational mobility, job tenure, educational attainment, and school enrollment of workers.
* Information on weekly and hourly earnings by detailed demographic group, occupation, education, union affiliation, and full- and part-time employment status.
The survey also reports the labor force participation rate, which is the labor force as a percentage of the population, and the ratio of the employed to the total population of the United States.

Although the primary purpose of the CPS is to record employment information, the survey fulfills a secondary role in providing demographic information about the United States population. CPS microdata for the period since 1962 are freely available through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.

==CPS Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC)- the March Supplement==
Since 1948, the CPS has included supplemental questions (at first, in April; later, in March) on income received in the previous calendar year, which are used to estimate the data on income and work experience. These data are the source of the annual Census Bureau report on income, poverty, and health insurance coverage.

Other regular or occasional survey supplement topics, in various months and years, have included after-tax money income, benefits that are not cash, displaced workers, job tenure, occupational mobility, temporary and contingent work, adult education, volunteering, tobacco use, food availability, fertility, and information about veterans.

<doc id="592471" wikidata="Q236442" url="?curid=592471" title="Juliette Récamier">
<text>Jeanne Françoise Julie Adélaïde Récamier (; 3 December 1777 – 11 May 1849), known as Juliette (), was a French socialite whose salon drew people from the leading literary and political circles of early 19th-century Paris. An icon of neoclassicism, Récamier cultivated a public persona as a great beauty, and her fame quickly spread across Europe. She befriended many intellectuals, sat for the finest artists of the age, and spurned an offer of marriage from Prince Augustus of Prussia.

==Family and education==
A native of Lyon, she was the only child of notary and King&#x27;s counsellor Jean Bernard and his wife, the former Julie Matton. In 1784, her father was named receiver of finance under Calonne. She was briefly educated at the Couvent de la Déserte in Lyon, until her family moved to Paris. The name &quot;Juliette&quot; came about as a diminutive of &quot;Julie&quot;. Beautiful, accomplished, and possessing a love of literature, Récamier was described as shy and modest by nature.

==Early marriage==
At the age of fifteen, she was married on 24 April 1793 to Jacques-Rose Récamier (1751–1830), a banker nearly thirty years her senior and a relative of the gourmet Brillat-Savarin. In relaying the news to a friend of his impending marriage to Juliette, Jacques wrote:


A rumour arose that her husband was, in fact, her natural father who married her to make her his heir. Their marriage occurred at the height of the revolutionary terror and, if he were guillotined, she would inherit his money. Although many biographers have given credence to this theory, it is unproven and discounted by several historians. Curiously, however, Jacques once wrote to a friend that his relations with Madame Bernard may have been more than platonic:

The marriage was never consummated, and Récamier remained a virgin until at least the age of forty. A rumour was initiated by writer Prosper Mérimée that she suffered from a physical condition which made the act of sexual intercourse painful. This, however, did not inhibit her charm, as many individuals including François-René de Chateaubriand were said to have had intense emotional relationships with her. Chateaubriand was a constant visitor of her salon and, in a manner, master of the house.

==European celebrity==

From the earliest days of the French Consulate to almost the end of the July Monarchy, Récamier&#x27;s salon in Paris was one of the chief resorts of literary and political society that followed what was fashionable. The habitués of her house included many former royalists, with others, such as General Jean Bernadotte and General Jean Victor Moreau, more or less disaffected to the government. This circumstance, together with her refusal to act as lady-in-waiting to Empress consort Joséphine de Beauharnais and her friendship for Germaine de Staël, brought her under suspicion. In 1800 Jacques-Louis David began his portrait of her, but left it unfinished on learning François Gérard had been commissioned to paint a portrait before he had.

It was through Germaine de Staël that Récamier became acquainted with Benjamin Constant, a Swiss-French political activist and writer, whose political equivocations during the last days of the First French Empire and the first of the Bourbon Restoration have been attributed to her persuasions. She was eventually exiled from Paris by the orders of Napoleon. After a short stay at her native Lyon, she proceeded to Rome, and finally to Naples. There she was on exceedingly good terms with Joachim Murat and his wife Caroline Bonaparte, who were then intriguing with the Bourbons. She persuaded Constant to plead the claims of Murat in a memorandum addressed to the Congress of Vienna, and also induced him to take up a decided attitude in opposition to Napoleon&#x27;s return during the Hundred Days.

==Later years==

Récamier&#x27;s husband had sustained heavy financial losses in 1805, and she visited Germaine de Staël at Coppet in Switzerland. There was a project for her divorce, in order that she might marry Prince Augustus of Prussia, but, though her husband was willing, it was not arranged. In her later days she lost most of what was left of her fortune; but she continued to receive visitors in her apartment at Abbaye-aux-Bois, a 17th-century convent (demolished in 1907) situated at 16 rue de Sèvres in Paris, to which she retired in 1819.

Despite old age, ill-health, partial blindness, and reduced circumstances, Récamier never lost her attractiveness, though at least one man who met her, artist Guillaume Gavarni, opined that she &quot;stank of the lower middle class.&quot; And although she numbered among her admirers Mathieu de Montmorency, Lucien Bonaparte, Prince Augustus of Prussia (whose marriage proposal she rejected), Pierre-Simon Ballanche, Jean-Jacques Ampère, and Benjamin Constant, none of them obtained over her so great an influence as did Chateaubriand, though she suffered much from his imperious temper. If she had any genuine affection, it seems to have been for the baron de Barante, whom she met at Coppet.

In 1849, Récamier died in Paris of cholera at the age of 71 and was buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre in Montmartre, at the time a village north of Paris.

==Cultural legacy==
A type of sofa or chaise longue on which she liked to recline, the &quot;récamier&quot;, was named after her.

She was the subject of two silent films. A 1920 German film &quot;Madame Récamier&quot; starring Fern Andra and a 1928 French film &quot;Madame Récamier&quot;.

<doc id="592474" wikidata="Q7870178" url="?curid=592474" title="USS Higbee">
<text>USS &quot;Higbee&quot; (DD/DDR-806) was a in the United States Navy during World War II. She was the first U.S. warship named for a female member of the U.S. Navy, being named for Chief Nurse Lenah S. Higbee (1874–1941), a pioneering Navy nurse who served as Superintendent of the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps during World War I.

&quot;Higbee&quot; was launched 13 November 1944 by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. A. M. Wheaton, sister of the late Mrs. Higbee; and commissioned on 27 January 1945.

==World War II==

&quot;Higbee&quot; immediately sailed to Boston, where she was converted to a radar picket destroyer. After shakedown in the Caribbean, she sailed for the Pacific on 24 May, joining Carrier Task Force 38 less than 400 miles from Tokyo Bay on 19 July. &quot;Leaping Lenah&quot;, as she had been dubbed by her crew, screened the carriers as their planes launched heavy air attacks against the Japanese mainland until the end of hostilities on 15 August. She helped clear Japanese mine fields and supported the occupation forces for the following seven months, finally returning to San Diego on 11 April 1946. The post-war years saw &quot;Higbee&quot; make two peacetime Western Pacific cruises as well as participate in fleet exercises and tactical training maneuvers during both these cruises and off the West Coast. On her second WestPac cruise, &quot;Higbee&quot; escorted the heavy cruiser as they paid official visits to the recently constituted governments of India and Pakistan in the summer of 1948.

==Korean War==
When Communist troops plunged into South Korea in June 1950, &quot;Higbee&quot;, redesignated DDR-806 on 18 March 1949, was immediately deployed to the Korean coast with the 7th Fleet. Most of her Korean War duty came in screening the Fast Carrier Task Force 77 as their jets launched raids against Communist positions and supply lines. On 15 September she formed part of the shore bombardment and screening group for the amphibious operation at Inchon. &quot;Higbee&quot; returned to San Diego on 8 February 1951. In two subsequent stints in Korea, she continued to screen the carrier task force and carry out shore bombardment of enemy positions. In order to protect against the possibility of Communist Chinese invasion of Nationalist China, &quot;Higbee&quot; also participated in patrol of Formosa Straits. Returning to the States on 30 June 1953, she entered the Long Beach Yard for a six-month modernization which saw major structural alterations made, including an enlarged Combat Information Center, new height-finding radar, and an improved anti-aircraft battery.

==Peacetime duties==
The radar picket destroyer&#x27;s peacetime duty then fell into a pattern of six-month WestPac cruises alternating with upkeep and training out of San Diego. Operating with the 7th Fleet on her WestPac cruises, &quot;Higbee&quot; visited Australian and South Pacific ports frequently as well as engaging in fleet maneuvers with units of SEATO navies. Her home port was changed to Yokosuka, Japan, on 21 May 1960. From there &quot;Higbee&quot; continued to cruise in the Pacific and along the China coast to strengthen American force in Asia. After two years duty in Japan, &quot;Higbee&quot; returned to her new home port, San Francisco, on 4 September 1962. On 1 April 1963 the destroyer entered the shipyard there for a fleet rehabilitation and modernization (FRAM) overhaul designed to improve her fighting capabilities and lengthen her life span as an active member of the fleet. &quot;Higbee&quot; was redesignated DD-806 on 1 June 1963.

==Vietnam War==

Ready for action on 3 January 1964, &quot;Higbee&quot; trained on the West Coast until departing for Japan on 30 June and reached her new homeport, Yokosuka, on 18 July. During the Gulf of Tonkin Incident in August, the destroyer screened carriers of Task Force 77 (TF 77) in the South China Sea. In February 1965 &quot;Higbee&quot; supported the 9th Marine Brigade at Da Nang, Vietnam. In May she participated in Project Gemini recovery in the Western Pacific. On 1 September &quot;Higbee&quot; helped to rescue the crew from &quot;Arsinoe&quot; after the French tanker had grounded off Scarborough Shoals in the South China Sea. The remainder of September was spent in naval gunfire support off South Vietnam. On the return voyage to home port, the ship saw short duty as Station Ship Hong Kong. While in Hong Kong, Princess Margaret was piped aboard the ship.
While operating northeast of Luzon in late January 1966, &quot;Higbee&quot; sighted the Soviet hydrographic ship &quot;Gidrifon&quot;. Returning to South Vietnam in April, &quot;Higbee&quot; bombarded enemy positions near Cape St. Jacques and the mouth of the Saigon River. On 17 June she departed Yokosuka for the West Coast, arrived Long Beach, her new home port, on 2 July and operated out of there into 1967. In November 1966, &quot;Higbee&quot; and her squadron had R&amp;R in Acapulco, Mexico, where Bob Hope did an unscheduled servicemen&#x27;s show for the crews. The first half of 1967 was spent in the yards at Mare Island for a major refit before returning to the Vietnam theater. On 19 April 1972 &quot;Higbee&quot; became the first US warship to be bombed during the Vietnam War, when two VPAF (also known as the NVAF-North Vietnamese Air Force) MiG-17s from the 923rd Fighter Regiment attacked, one of which, piloted by Le Xuan Di, dropped a 250 kilogram (500 lb) bomb onto &quot;Higbee&quot;″s rear 5-inch gun mount, destroying it.

The 5-inch gun crew had been outside their turret, due to a misfire within the mount, when the air attack occurred, which resulted in the wounding of four US sailors. The second MiG-17 flown by Nguyen Van Bay B (the &quot;B&quot; to differentiate from the more famous ace pilot Nguyen Van Bay) went on to bomb the light cruiser USS &quot;Oklahoma City&quot;, causing only minor damage. &quot;Higbee&quot; was repaired at Subic Bay in the Philippines, with the wrecked gun mount removed, to be replaced later and the structural damage repaired.

Although there were no official aircraft losses reported by either side during the aerial attack, witnesses aboard accompanying USN vessel&#x27;s deploying defensive measures, claimed one of the attacking MiGs with a hit by a surface-to-air missile fired from the cruiser USS &quot;Sterett&quot;.

==Post-war fate==
&quot;Higbee&quot;&#x27;s first peacetime duty was as a member of Destroyer Squadron 27 homeported in Long Beach, California. Her later years (after May, 1975) were spent as a Naval Reserve Force destroyer homeported in Long Beach, CA and Seattle, WA, as a unit of DesRon 37. In 1978 Higbee had the highest score for NGFS (Naval Gunfire Support) of any ship in the US Navy and was featured in Surface Warfare magazine for this distinction.
&quot;Higbee&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Navy list on 15 July 1979. &quot;Higbee&quot; was sunk as a target on 24 April 1986, around west of San Diego at .

One of her anchors is on display outside of Naval Station Mayport&#x27;s medical building.

==Honors==
&quot;Higbee&quot; earned one battle star for her service in World War II and seven battle stars for her service in the Korean War.

<doc id="592475" wikidata="Q1875953" url="?curid=592475" title="Cornelius Vanderbilt III">
<text>Brigadier General Cornelius &quot;Neily&quot; Vanderbilt III (September 5, 1873 – March 1, 1942) was an American military officer, inventor, engineer, and yachtsman. He was a member of the Vanderbilt family.

==Early life==
Born in New York City to Cornelius Vanderbilt II and Alice Claypoole Gwynne, he was educated by private tutors and at St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire. Vanderbilt attended Yale University and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1895. Against his father&#x27;s wishes, in August 1896 he married Grace Graham Wilson, the youngest child of New York banker Richard Thornton Wilson Sr., and Melissa Clementine Johnston. As a consequence, his father disinherited him. Vanderbilt continued to study at Yale, and earned a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in 1898 and a Master of Engineering degree in mechanical engineering in 1899.

==Inheritance==
Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1899 Vanderbilt received $500,000 in cash and the income from a $1 million trust fund. The bulk of his father&#x27;s $70 million estate went to Vanderbilt&#x27;s brother Alfred, who then transferred $6 million to Vanderbilt. However, as a result of his parents&#x27; attitude towards his marriage, it would be 27 years after his father&#x27;s death before he finally reconciled with his aging mother. Vanderbilt and his wife Grace remained married until his death and had two children, Cornelius IV (1898–1974), who would marry seven times, and Grace (September 25, 1899 – January 28, 1964).

==Interests==
Neily Vanderbilt was an inveterate tinkerer with all things mechanical and patented more than thirty inventions for improving locomotives and freight cars, including several which brought him a significant royalty income. Some of the most important were a corrugated firebox for locomotives that resulted in a substantial increase in fuel efficiency, a cylindrical styled tank car for the transport of bulk oil, and a revolutionary type of locomotive tender. In addition, on his travels to London and Paris he saw the potential for adapting their subway systems for use in New York City and partnered with August Belmont Jr. to establish the Interborough Rapid Transit Company for the construction of the city&#x27;s first subway.

In 1906 he was admitted as an hereditary member of the Rhode Island Society of the Cincinnati by right of his descent from Surgeon Henry Collins Flagg of the Continental Army.

==Yachting==
As with other members of the Vanderbilt family, yachting was one of Vanderbilt&#x27;s favorite pastimes as an escape from a busy life that included a seat on the boards of directors of a number of major American corporations. He was a member of the nine-member syndicate that built the yacht &quot;Reliance&quot;, the largest racing yacht in history with a crew of 70, for the successful defense of the America&#x27;s Cup in 1903.

He was commodore of the New York Yacht Club from 1906 to 1908. In 1910, he skippered his 65-foot sloop &quot;Aurora&quot; to victory in the New York Yacht Club&#x27;s race for the King Edward VII Cup in Newport, RI.

Prior to the First World War, Vanderbilt&#x27;s personal yacht was the &quot;North Star&quot; in which he and his family toured Europe and hosted many distinguished guests including King Edward VII, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Czar Nicholas II. The &quot;North Star&quot; was in British waters at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and was seized by the British government for use as a hospital ship with the promise it would be returned after the war. The &quot;North Star&quot; was damaged in action and was used after the war as a merchant ship trading with China.

On April 29, 1930, Vanderbilt&#x27;s yacht, the &quot;Winchester&quot;, was set ablaze following an explosion. No one was injured as the crew were all eating in the galley, up front, but her owner&#x27;s suite and guest suites sustained $500,000 of damage.

==Military service==

In 1901, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 12th Infantry Regiment of the New York National Guard and he remained a member of the National Guard for 33 years. He was promoted to first lieutenant in December 1902 and served as an aide-de-camp to the Governor of New York from September 1903 to December 1904. He was promoted to captain in June 1907 and served as an aide to the division commander from October 1908 until being promoted to lieutenant colonel and inspector general in June 1912.

Along with most of the National Guard, Vanderbilt was mobilized on 30 June 1916 and served on the Mexican border.

When the United States declared war on Germany and entered World War I in April 1917. Vanderbilt was promoted to colonel on 20 July and placed in command of the 22nd Engineer Regiment of the New York National Guard. The regiment was re-designated as the 102nd Engineer Regiment on 1 October 1917 and became part of the newly organized 27th Division, which was composed of activated units of the New York National Guard. The 27th Division departed New York for Camp Wadsworth in Spartanburg, South Carolina in September 1917 and was shipped overseas to France in May and June 1918.

In July 1918, shortly after his arrival in France, Vanderbilt was promoted to brigadier general. Shortly thereafter, he returned from France to the United States and was assigned to Camp Lewis in Washington state, where he arrived on August 20 and assumed command of the 25th Brigade, which was part of the 13th Division of which he was acting commander from August 20 to September 11, 1918. As most new recruits and draftees were being sent to France to replace casualties, the 13th Division never reached full strength until November 1, 1918, which was just nine days before the armistice with Germany which ended hostilities, and, therefore, it was never sent overseas. General Vanderbilt was reassigned on December 20, 1918, and was discharged from the army on January 3, 1919.

===Military awards===
For his services during the war, General Vanderbilt was decorated with the Army Distinguished Service Medal by the War Department and the New York State Conspicuous Service Cross (recipient #190). He was also made a commander of the Order of the Crown of Belgium and was awarded that country&#x27;s Croix de Guerre. The government of France invested him as a Commander of the Legion of Honor. He was also a recipient of the Mexican Border Service Medal and World War I Victory Medal.

His citation for the Army Distinguished Service Medal, awarded in 1919, is as follows:

&quot;The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Brigadier General Cornelius Vanderbilt, United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. As Commanding Officer, 102d Engineers, and as Engineer Officer of the 27th Division, General Vanderbilt&#x27;s marked qualities of leadership and thorough training and instruction developed a high state of military efficiency in his command, as demonstrated throughout its entire service.&quot;

===Post war service===
After the war, Vanderbilt remained active in the New York National Guard and Organized Reserve. He commanded the 77th Infantry Division of the Organized Reserve Corps from May 1922 to January 1929, and from November 1929 until relinquishing command in January 1935.

==Postwar life==

Following the First World War, Vanderbilt and his wife frequently returned to Europe, becoming friends and guests of numerous members of European royalty including former Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and his brother, Prince Henry of Prussia, King Albert I of Belgium, Crown Prince Olav of Norway, Queen Marie of Romania, Reza Pahlavi of Iran, and every British monarch since Queen Victoria.

==Residences==
In 1914, Vanderbilt inherited a spacious mansion located at 640 Fifth Avenue in New York City from his uncle George Washington Vanderbilt II. Built in 1880 by William Henry Vanderbilt, the mansion was originally one of two sharing that block designed with identical exteriors and together known as the &quot;Twin Mansions.&quot; It was to be his permanent residence for the rest of his life, because although he sold the mansion in 1940 to members of the Astor family, he and his family retained occupancy of the house for three years after his death in 1942. Neily&#x27;s wife Grace lived there until 1944, when she moved into the William Starr Miller House at 1048 Fifth Avenue which still stands today as the Neue Galerie.

Vanderbilt also had a summer residence in Newport, Rhode Island named Beaulieu which was designed by Calvert Vaux. The mansion is located on fashionable Bellevue Avenue and is adjacent to the Marble House which was built by Vanderbilt&#x27;s uncle William K. Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt&#x27;s widow retained Beaulieu as her summer residence until her death, after which it was sold to Ambassador Wiley T. Buchanan, Jr. (1913-1986).

==Death==
Brigadier General Cornelius Vanderbilt III died aboard his yacht from a cerebral hemorrhage while vacationing in Miami Beach, Florida in 1942.

Grace Vanderbilt died on January 7, 1953. She was entombed beside her husband in the Vanderbilt Family Mausoleum in New Dorp on Staten Island, New York.

<doc id="592476" wikidata="Q315147" url="?curid=592476" title="Andrei Platonov">
<text>Andrei Platonovich Platonov (; []; – 5 January 1951) was a Soviet Russian novelist, short story writer, philosopher, playwright, and poet. Although Platonov regarded himself as a communist, his principal works remained unpublished in his lifetime because of their skeptical attitude toward collectivization of agriculture (1929–1940) and other Stalinist policies, as well as for their experimental, avant-garde form infused with existentialism which was not in line with the dominant socialist realism doctrine. His famous works include the novels &quot;Chevengur&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Foundation Pit &quot; (1930).

==Early life and education==
Platonov was born in the settlement of Yamskaya Sloboda on the outskirts of Voronezh in the Chernozem Region of Central Russia. 
His father was a metal fitter (and amateur inventor) employed in the railroad workshops and his mother was the daughter of a watchmaker. 
He attended a local parish school and completed his primary education at a four-year city school and began work at age thirteen, with such jobs as an office clerk at a local insurance company, smelter at a pipe factory, assistant machinist, warehouseman, and the railroad. 
Following the 1917 Revolution, he studied electrical technology at Voronezh Polytechnic Institute. 
When Civil War broke out in 1918 Platonov assisted his father on trains delivering troops and supplies and clearing snow.

==Early career==
Meanwhile, Platonov had begun to write poems, submitting them to papers in Moscow and elsewhere. He was also a prolific contributor to local periodicals. These included &#x27; (&quot;Railroad&quot;), the paper of the local railway workers&#x27; union; the Voronezh Region Communist Party newspapers &#x27; (&quot;Red countryside&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;Voronezh commune&quot;); and &#x27;, the nationwide journal of the &quot;Smithy&quot; group of proletarian writers.

From 1918 through 1921, his most intensive period as a writer, he published dozens of poems (an anthology appeared in 1922), several stories, and hundreds of articles and essays, adopting in 1920 the pen-name Platonov by which he is best-known. With remarkable energy and intellectual precocity, he wrote confidently across a range of topics including literature, art, cultural life, science, philosophy, religion, education, politics, the civil war, foreign relations, economics, technology, famine and land reclamation, and others. It was not unusual around 1920 to see two or three pieces by Platonov, on quite different subjects, appear daily in the press.

He has also been involved with the local Proletcult movement, joined the Union of Communist Journalists in March 1920, and worked as an editor at &quot;&quot; (&quot;Red countryside&quot;), and the paper of the local railway workers&#x27; union. in August 1920, Platonov was elected to the interim board of the newly-formed Voronezh Union of Proletarian Writers and attended the First Congress of Proletarian Writers in Moscow in October 1920, organized by the Smithy group. He regularly read his poetry and gave critical talks at various club meetings.

In July 1920, Platonov was admitted to the Communist Party as a candidate member on the recommendation of his friend Litvin (Molotov). He attended Party meetings, but was expelled from the Party on 30 October 1921 as an &quot;unstable element&quot;. Later, he said the reason was &quot;juvenile&quot;. He may have quit the party in dismay of the New Economic Policy (NEP). like a number of other worker writers (many of whom he had met through &quot;Kuznitsa&quot; and at the 1920 writers&#x27; congress). Troubled by the famine of 1921, he openly and controversially criticized the behaviour (and privileges) of local communists. In spring, 1924 Platonov applied for re-admission to the Party, offering reassurance that he had remained a communist and a Marxist, but he was denied then as on the next two occasions.

In 1921 Platonov married Maria Aleksandrovna Kashintseva (1903–1983); they had a son, Platon, in 1922, and a daughter, Maria, in 1944.

In 1922, in the wake of the devastating drought and famine of 1921, Platonov abandoned writing to work on electrification and land reclamation for the Voronezh Provincial Land Administration and later for the central government. &quot;I could no longer be occupied with a contemplative activity like literature&quot;, he recalled later. For the next years, he worked as an engineer and administrator, organizing the digging of ponds and wells, draining of swampland, and building a hydroelectric plant.

== &quot;Chevengur&quot;, &quot;The Foundation Pit&quot; and &quot;For Future Use&quot; ==
When he returned to writing prose in 1926, a number of critics and readers noted the appearance of a major and original literary voice. Moving to Moscow in 1927, he became, for the first time, a professional writer, working with a number of leading magazines.

Between 1926 and 1930, the period from NEP to the first five-year plan (1928–1932), Platonov produced his two major works, the novels &quot;Chevengur&quot; and &quot;The Foundation Pit&quot;. With their implicit criticism of the system, neither was then accepted for publication although one section of &quot;Chevengur&quot; appeared in a magazine. The two novels were only published in the USSR during the late 1980s.

In the 1930s, Platonov worked with the Soviet philosopher Mikhail Lifshitz, who edited &quot;The Literary Critic&quot; (&quot;Literaturny Kritik&quot;), a Moscow magazine followed by Marxist philosophers around the world. Another of the magazine&#x27;s contributors was the theoretician György Lukács and Platonov built upon connections with the two philosophers. A turning point in his life and career as a writer came with the publication in March 1931 of &quot;For Future Use&quot; (″Vprok″ in Russian), a novella that chronicled the forced collectivisation of agriculture during the First Five Year Plan.

According to archival evidence (OGPU informer&#x27;s report, 11 July 1931), Stalin read &quot;For Future Use&quot; carefully after its publication, adding marginal comments about the author (&quot;fool, idiot, scoundrel&quot;) and his literary style (&quot;this isn&#x27;t Russian but some incomprehensible nonsense&quot;) to his copy of the magazine. In a note to the publishers, the &quot;Krasnaya nov&quot; monthly, Stalin described Platonov as &quot;an agent of our enemies&quot; and suggested in a postscript that the author and other &quot;numbskulls&quot; (i.e. the editors) should be punished in such a way that the punishment served them &quot;for future use&quot;.

In 1933, an OGPU official Shivarov wrote a special report on Platonov. Attached were versions of &quot;The Sea of Youth&quot;, the play &quot;14 Red Huts&quot; and the unfinished &quot;Technical Novel&quot;. The report described &quot;For Future Use&quot; as &quot;a satire on the organizing of collective farms,&quot; and commented that Platonov&#x27;s subsequent work revealed the &quot;deepening anti-Soviet attitudes&quot; of the writer.

== Official support and censure ==
In 1934, Maksim Gorky arranged for Platonov to be included in a &quot;writers&#x27; brigade&quot; sent to Central Asia with the intention of publishing a collective work in celebration of ten years of Soviet Turkmenistan. (Earlier that year, a collective work by over 30 Soviet writers had been published about the construction of the White Sea Canal.) Platonov’s contribution to the Turkmen volume was a short story titled “&quot;Takyr&quot;” (or “&quot;Salt-flats&quot;”) about the liberation of a Persian slave girl. Platonov returned to Turkmenistan in 1935 and this was the basis for his novella &quot;Soul&quot; (or &quot;Dzhan&quot;). &quot;Dzhan&quot; is about a “non-Russian” economist from Central Asia, who leaves Moscow to help his lost, nomadic nation called &quot;Dzhan,&quot; of rejects and outcasts possessing nothing but their souls. A censored text was first published in 1966; a complete, uncensored text only in 1999.

In the mid-1930s Platonov was again invited to contribute to a collective volume, about rail workers. He wrote two stories: &quot;Immortality&quot;, which was highly praised, and &quot;Among Animals and Plants&quot;, which was severely criticized and eventually published only in a heavily edited and far weaker version.

In August 1936, &quot;The Literary Critic&quot; published &quot;Immortality&quot; with a note explaining the difficulties the author had faced when proposing the story to other periodicals. The following year, this publication came under criticism in &quot;Krasnaya Nov&quot;, damaging Platonov&#x27;s reputation. In 1939, the story was republished in the intended collective volume, &quot;Fictional representations of Railway Transport&quot; (1939) dedicated to the heroes of the Soviet railroad system.

Platonov published eight more books, fiction and essays, between 1937 and his death in 1951.

== Stalin&#x27;s ambivalence and Platonov&#x27;s son==
Stalin was ambivalent about Platonov&#x27;s worth as a writer. The same informer&#x27;s report in July 1931 claimed that he also referred to the writer as &quot;brilliant, a prophet&quot;. For his part, Platonov made hostile remarks about Trotsky, Rykov, and Bukharin but not about Stalin, to whom he wrote letters on several occasions. &quot;Is Platonov here?&quot; asked Stalin at the meeting with Soviet writers held in Moscow at Gorky&#x27;s villa in October 1932 when the Soviet leader first called writers &quot;engineers of the human soul&quot;.

In January 1937, Platonov contributed to an issue of &quot;Literaturnaya gazeta&quot; in which the accused at the second Moscow Show Trial (Radek, Pyatakov and others) were denounced and condemned by 30 well-known writers, including Boris Pasternak. His short text &quot;To overcome evil&quot; is included in his collected works. It has been suggested that it contains coded criticism of the regime.

In May 1938, during the Great Terror, Platonov&#x27;s son was arrested as a &quot;terrorist&quot; and &quot;spy&quot;. Aged 15 years old, Platon was sentenced in September 1938 to ten years imprisonment and was sent to a corrective labour camp, where he contracted tuberculosis. Thanks to efforts by Platonov and his acquaintances (including Mikhail Sholokhov), Platon was released and returned home in October 1940, but he was terminally ill and died in January 1943. Platonov himself contracted the disease while nursing his son.

During the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945), Platonov served as a war correspondent for the military newspaper &quot;The Red Star&quot; and published a number of short stories about what he witnessed at the front. The war marked a slight upturn in Platonov&#x27;s literary fortunes: he was again permitted to publish in major literary journals, and some of these war stories, notwithstanding Platonov&#x27;s typical idiosyncratic language and metaphysics, were well received. However, towards the end of the war, Platonov&#x27;s health worsened, and in 1944 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. In 1946, his last published short story, &quot;The Return,&quot; was slammed in &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot; as a &quot;slander&quot; against Soviet culture. His last publications were two collections of folklore. After his death in 1951, Vasily Grossman spoke at his funeral.

==Legacy==

Platonov&#x27;s influence on later Russian writers is considerable. Some - but not all - of his work was published or republished during the 1960s&#x27; Khrushchev Thaw.

In journalism, stories, and poetry written during the first post-revolutionary years (1918–1922), Platonov interwove ideas about human mastery over nature with scepticism about triumphant human consciousness and will, and sentimental and even erotic love of physical things with fear and attendant abhorrence of matter. Platonov viewed the world as embodying at the same time the opposing principles of spirit and matter, reason and emotion, nature and machine.

He wrote of factories, machines, and technology as both enticing and dreadful. His aim was to turn industry over to machines, in order to &quot;transfer man from the realm of material production to a higher sphere of life.&quot; Thus, in Platonov&#x27;s vision of the coming &quot;golden age&quot; machines are both enemy and savior. Modern technologies, Platonov asserted paradoxically (though echoing a paradox characteristic of Marxism), would enable humanity to be &quot;freed from the oppression of matter.&quot;

Platonov&#x27;s writing, it has also been argued, has strong ties to the works of earlier Russian authors like Fyodor Dostoevsky. He also uses much Christian symbolism, including a prominent and discernible influence from a wide range of contemporary and ancient philosophers, including the Russian philosopher Nikolai Fedorov.

His &quot;Foundation Pit&quot; uses a combination of peasant language with ideological and political terms to create a sense of meaninglessness, aided by the abrupt and sometimes fantastic events of the plot. Joseph Brodsky considers the work deeply suspicious of the meaning of language, especially political language. This exploration of meaninglessness is a hallmark of existentialism and absurdism. Brodsky commented, &quot;Woe to the people into whose language Andrei Platonov can be translated.&quot;

Elif Batuman ranked &quot;Soul&quot; as one of her four favorite 20th century Russian works. (Batuman is author of &quot;The Possessed: Adventures With Russian Books and the People Who Read Them&quot; and was Pulitzer Prize finalist for her novel &quot;The Idiot&quot;.)

Novelist Tatyana Tolstaya wrote, &quot;Andrei Platonov is an extraordinary writer, perhaps the most brilliant Russian writer of the twentieth century&quot;.

Each year in Voronezh the literature exhibition is held in honour of Platonov, during which people read from the stage some of his works.

==The style and subject matter==
One of the most striking distinguishing features of Platonov&#x27;s work is the original language, which has no analogues in world literature. It is often called &quot;primitive&quot;, &quot;ungainly&quot;, &quot;homemade&quot;.

Platonov actively uses the technique of ostraneny, his prose is replete with lexical and grammatical &quot;errors&quot; characteristic of children&#x27;s speech.

Yuri Levin highlights Platonov&#x27;s characteristic techniques:

* syntactically incorrect constructions, such as verb+place circumstance. «&quot;Think on head&quot;», «&quot;answered... from his dry mouth&quot;», «&quot;recognized the desire to live into this fenced-off distance&quot;».
* redundancy, pleonasm. «&quot;Voschev... opened the door to space&quot;», «&quot;his body was thin inside the clothes&quot;».
* extremely generalized vocabulary. &quot;Nature&quot;, &quot;place&quot;, &quot;space&quot; instead of specific landscape descriptions. «&quot;Prushevsky looked around the empty area of the nearest nature&quot;», «&quot;an old tree grew... in bright weather&quot;».
* active use of subordinate clauses about the cause (“Nastya ... hovered around the rushing men, because she wanted to”), as well as subordinate clauses about purpose (“It&#x27;s time to eat for the day&#x27;s work”). Moreover, they are often superfluous or logically unmotivated.
* active use of typical Soviet bureaucracies, often in an ironic way (“confiscate her affection”), but rarely.

According to the researcher Levin, with the help of these turns, Platonov forms a &quot;panteleological&quot; space of the text, where &quot;everything is connected with everything&quot;, and all events unfold among a single &quot;nature&quot;.

In the works of Andrey Platonov, form and content form a single, indissoluble whole, that is, the very language of Platonov&#x27;s works is their content.

Among the key motives of Platonov&#x27;s work is the theme of death and its overcoming. Anatoly Ryasov writes about Platonov&#x27;s &quot; metaphysics of death». Platonov in his youth came under the influence of Nikolai Fedorov and repeatedly refers to the idea of raising the dead. In the minds of his characters, it is associated with the coming arrival of communism.

==Tribute==
Asteroid 3620 Platonov discovered in 1981 by Soviet astronomer L. G. Karachkina was named after Platonov.

<text>Pluvialis is a genus of plovers, a group of wading birds comprising four species that breed in the temperate or Arctic Northern Hemisphere.

In breeding plumage, they all have largely black underparts, and golden or silvery upperparts. They have relatively short bills and feed mainly on insects, worms or other invertebrates, depending on habitat, which are obtained by a run-and-pause technique, rather than the steady probing of some other wader groups. They hunt by sight, rather than by feel as do longer-billed waders.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Pluvialis&quot; was described by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the European golden plover (&quot;Pluvialis apricaria&quot;) as the type species. The genus name is Latin and means relating to rain, from &quot;pluvia&quot;, &quot;rain&quot;. It was believed that they flocked when rain was imminent.

The genus contains four species:
The American and Pacific golden plovers were formerly considered conspecific as &quot;lesser golden plover&quot;.

<text>Conventional weapons or conventional arms are weapons whose damaging impact comes from kinetic, incendiary, or explosive energy. They stand in contrast to weapons of mass destruction (&quot;e.g.,&quot; nuclear, biological, radiological, and chemical weapons).

== Proscription ==

Conventional weapons include small arms, defensive shields, light weapons, sea and land mines, as well as bombs, shells, rockets, missiles, and cluster munitions. These weapons use explosive material based on chemical energy, as opposed to nuclear energy in nuclear weapons. Conventional weapons are also contrasted with weapons of mass destruction and improvised weapons.

The Geneva Conventions govern the acceptable use of conventional weapons in war. Certain of the weapons are regulated or prohibited under the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Others are prohibited under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, the Ottawa Treaty (also known as the Mine Ban Treaty), and Arms Trade Treaty.

<doc id="592480" wikidata="Q2498092" url="?curid=592480" title="Right to Censor">
<text>The Right to Censor (frequently referred to as RTC) was a villainous professional wrestling stable in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as WWE) from mid-2000 to mid 2001. The group was a parody of the Parents Television Council (PTC), which was protesting the level of violence and sexual content in WWF programming, and threatening to boycott several of their sponsors.

Throughout the stable&#x27;s existence, the team had held the WWF Tag Team Championship (Buchanan and Goodfather) and the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship (Ivory). The group feuded with several WWF wrestlers such as The Undertaker and The Rock. Right to Censor was ultimately dismantled by The Undertaker in April 2001, two months before its final dissolution.

==Characters==
The Right to Censor gimmick was a parody of the Parents Television Council (PTC) which actively campaigned against the company’s product in 1999. Its uniform was a white button up shirt and black tie, with black slacks for the men (although Val Venis wore white slacks on occasion) and a long black skirt for the women. Eventually Ivory, the only woman officially recruited to the group, was forced to adopt the black slacks out of necessity, due to the skirt limiting her in-ring abilities.

Entrances of RTC members were accompanied not by the standard musical theme but by the sound of shrill alarms and buzzers, with an underlying swing jazz beat, along with a monotone voice repeating the word &quot;warning&quot; over and over again.

==History==

===Formation and feuds===
The group was formed in July 2000 when wrestler Steven Richards began to randomly appear on WWF programming to cover up the bodies of scantily clad women or remove &quot;hardcore&quot; weapons such as tables from matches. He apparently took offense to the Acolytes&#x27; rowdy reputation and disapproved of the Dudleys&#x27; use of tables. He was eventually joined by Bull Buchanan, The Goodfather (formerly the Godfather), Val Venis, and Ivory. The group temporarily forced The Kat into its fold, but The Kat and the WWF parted ways before that storyline could completely play itself out. Before being forced into the group, The Kat was starting a group called Right to Nudity, which was to play on The Kat&#x27;s infamous pay-per-view stunt where she appeared completely topless. Her group was what brought her to Right to Censor&#x27;s attention.

The Right to Censor came out victorious in at least one match of every pay-per-view they participated in from mid-2000 to early 2001. At SummerSlam on August 27, Richards, Buchanan, and The Goodfather won a 6-man tag match against Too Cool (Grandmaster Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty) and Rikishi. At the next pay-per-view, Unforgiven on September 24, the RTC (now with Val Venis) won an 8-man tag match against the APA and the Dudley Boyz. Even though The Goodfather and Bull Buchanan lost the Dudley Invitational at No Mercy on October 22, Venis and Richards managed to defeat Chyna and Mr. Ass in a tag match. When WWF Women&#x27;s Champion Ivory joined the group, she won 3 pay-per-view matches in a row for the group. She defeated Lita in a title match at Survivor Series on November 19 while The Goodfather and Buchanan lost a Survivor Series Elimination Match. The next month, at Armageddon on December 10, Ivory came out victorious once again in a triple-threat title match against Molly Holly and Trish Stratus, and Val Venis also was victorious over Chyna. Meanwhile, Buchanan and The Goodfather continued the losing streak when they lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to Edge and Christian in a Fatal Four-Way tag match. At the Royal Rumble on January 21, 2001, Ivory once again retained her title by defeating Chyna; on the other hand, Buchanan, The Goodfather, and Venis all failed in their attempt to win the Royal Rumble Match. The followed month at No Way Out on February 25, it marked the last time the RTC won a match at a pay-per-view when Steven Richards defeated Jerry Lawler.

The group had a moderate level of success, with Buchanan and The Goodfather holding the WWF Tag Team Championship and Ivory capturing the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship before entering into a high-profile feud with Chyna.

===Split and future===
WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1 was the symbolic end of the Right to Censor, as the stable lost all of the matches they were scheduled to participate in, Buchanan, Venis, and The Goodfather lost a 6-man tag match against the APA and Tazz while Ivory lost her title to Chyna.

On the April 26 episode of &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot;, Richards, Buchanan, Val Venis, and The Goodfather faced The Undertaker in a 4-on-1 handicap match. The group was finally disbanded when Steven Richards was hit with the Last Ride by The Undertaker. The Goodfather, Buchanan and Val Venis all walked out and left him lying in the ring. The group&#x27;s last match was contested on the May 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, when Buchanan, The Goodfather and Ivory lost to Steve Blackman, Grand Master Sexay and Trish Stratus in a tag match. Then Ivory and Richards made an appearance for Memphis Championship Wrestling losing to Rodrageous and Victoria on June 14, 2001. Following this match, RTC was officially disbanded, with Ivory appearing for the last time under the Right to Censor gimmick on the June 16 episode of &quot;Metal&quot;. 

Ivory and Richards returned as members of The Alliance during the Invasion angle while Venis and Goodfather returned at the 2002 Royal Rumble under their old personas. Steven Richards adopted a psychotic gimmick while Bull Buchanan was briefly rebranded as B2 (B-Squared) in 2002 and made a bodyguard for John Cena before departing the WWE in January 2003. The rest of the group reverted to their previous personas before the advent of the faction. Godfather was released in 2002 (and later inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2016), Ivory in 2005 (inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2018), Richards in 2008 and Venis in 2009.

The Right to Censor gimmick returned for one night at the 2022 Royal Rumble, when Ivory made a guest appearance in the women&#x27;s Royal Rumble match. Ivory&#x27;s participation primarily consisted of her cutting a promo deriding the roster&#x27;s unladylike behaviour; she lasted thirty seconds in the match before being eliminated by Rhea Ripley. Buchanan&#x27;s son, Benjamin, who wrestles as Brooks Jensen, is now signed with the company and, as of 2025, currently performs in its NXT developmental brand.

The righttocensor.com domain remained active for 19 years even after the group&#x27;s dissolution; until mid-2002, the address redirected to WWF&#x27;s/WWE&#x27;s Superstars website, before WWE lost the domain to squatters. For unknown reasons, an unknown individual acquired the former website&#x27;s domain in July 2020 and redirects the righttocensor.com domain to rival All Elite Wrestling (AEW)&#x27;s website. As of May 2024, the domain returned to squatters and contains advertisements for various unrelated services.

<text>A refrigerant is a working fluid used in the cooling, heating, or reverse cooling/heating cycles of air conditioning systems and heat pumps, where they undergo a repeated phase transition from a liquid to a gas and back again. Refrigerants are heavily regulated because of their toxicity and flammability, as well as the contribution of CFC and HCFC refrigerants to ozone depletion and the contribution of HFC refrigerants to climate change.

Refrigerants are used in a direct expansion (DX) circulating system to transfer energy from one environment to another, typically from inside a building to outside or vice versa. These can be air conditioner cooling only systems, cooling &amp; heating reverse DX systems, or heat pump and heating only DX cycles. Refrigerants can carry 10 times more energy per kg than water, and 50 times more than air.

Refrigerants are controlled substances that are classified by international safety regulations ISO 817/5149, AHRAE 34/15 &amp; BS EN 378 due to high pressures (), extreme temperatures ( to over ), flammability (A1 class non-flammable, A2/A2L class flammable and A3 class extremely flammable/explosive) and toxicity (B1-low, B2-medium &amp; B3-high). The regulations relate to situations where these refrigerants are released into the atmosphere in the event of an accidental leak, not while circulated. Due to these regulations, most refrigerants may only be handled by qualified/certified engineers for the relevant classes (in the UK, C&amp;G 2079 for A1-class and C&amp;G 6187-2 for A2/A2L &amp; A3-class refrigerants). Due to their non-flammability, non-explosivity, and non-toxicity, A1 class refrigerants have been used in open systems (where they are consumed when used rather than circulated) like fire extinguishers, inhalers, computer rooms, and insulation since 1928.

== History ==

The first air conditioners and refrigerators employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, sulfur dioxide, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked.

In 1928 Thomas Midgley Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, &quot;Freon&quot; (R-12). The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont (now Chemours) for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. Following the discovery of better synthesis methods, CFCs such as R-11, R-12, R-123 and R-502 dominated the market.

=== Phasing out of CFCs ===

In the mid-1970s, scientists discovered that CFCs were causing major damage to the ozone layer that protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation, and to the ozone holes over polar regions. This led to the signing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987 which aimed to phase out CFCs and HCFC but did not address the contributions that HFCs made to climate change. The adoption of HCFCs such as R-22, and R-123 was accelerated and so were used in most U.S. homes in air conditioners and in chillers from the 1980s as they have a dramatically lower Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) than CFCs, but their ODP was still not zero which led to their eventual phase-out.

Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) such as R-134a, R-407A, R-407C, R-404A, R-410A (a 50/50 blend of R-125/R-32) and R-507 were promoted as replacements for CFCs and HCFCs in the 1990s and 2000s. HFCs were not ozone-depleting but did have global warming potentials (GWPs) thousands of times greater than CO2 with atmospheric lifetimes that can extend for decades. This in turn, starting from the 2010s, led to the adoption in new equipment of Hydrocarbon and HFO (hydrofluoroolefin) refrigerants R-32, R-290, R-600a, R-454B, R-1234yf, R-514A, R-744 (), R-1234ze(E) and R-1233zd(E), which have both an ODP of zero and a lower GWP. Hydrocarbons and are sometimes called natural refrigerants because they can be found in nature.

The environmental organization Greenpeace provided funding to a former East German refrigerator company to research alternative ozone- and climate-safe refrigerants in 1992. The company developed a hydrocarbon mixture of propane and isobutane, or pure isobutane, called &quot;Greenfreeze&quot;, but as a condition of the contract with Greenpeace could not patent the technology, which led to widespread adoption by other firms. Policy and political influence by corporate executives resisted change however, citing the flammability and explosive properties of the refrigerants, and DuPont together with other companies blocked them in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA.

Beginning on 14 November 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency restricted the sale, possession and use of refrigerants to only licensed technicians, per rules under sections 608 and 609 of the Clean Air Act. In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal.

In 1996 Eurammon, a European non-profit initiative for natural refrigerants, was established and comprises European companies, institutions, and industry experts.

In 1997, FCs and HFCs were included in the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change.

In 2000 in the UK, the Ozone Regulations came into force which banned the use of ozone-depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a &quot;top-up&quot; fluid for maintenance from 2010 for virgin fluid and from 2015 for recycled fluid.

=== Addressing greenhouse gases ===
With growing interest in natural refrigerants as alternatives to synthetic refrigerants such as CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to create a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. Four years later, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. It is estimated that almost 75 percent of the refrigeration and air conditioning sector has the potential to be converted to natural refrigerants.

In 2006, the EU adopted a Regulation on fluorinated greenhouse gases (FCs and HFCs) to encourage to transition to natural refrigerants (such as hydrocarbons). It was reported in 2010 that some refrigerants are being used as recreational drugs, leading to an extremely dangerous phenomenon known as inhalant abuse.

From 2011 the European Union started to phase out refrigerants with a global warming potential (GWP) of more than 150 in automotive air conditioning (GWP = 100-year warming potential of one kilogram of a gas relative to one kilogram of CO2) such as the refrigerant HFC-134a (known as R-134a in North America) which has a GWP of 1526. In the same year the EPA decided in favour of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture.

A 2018 study by the nonprofit organization &quot;Drawdown&quot; put proper refrigerant management and disposal at the very top of the list of climate impact solutions, with an impact equivalent to eliminating over 17 years of US carbon dioxide emissions.

In 2019 it was estimated that CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs were responsible for about 10% of direct radiative forcing from all long-lived anthropogenic greenhouse gases. and in the same year the UNEP published new voluntary guidelines, however many countries have not yet ratified the Kigali Amendment.

From early 2020 HFCs (including R-404A, R-134a, and R-410A) are being superseded: Residential air-conditioning systems and heat pumps are increasingly using R-32. This still has a GWP of more than 600. Progressive devices use refrigerants with almost no climate impact, namely R-290 (propane), R-600a (isobutane), or R-1234yf (less flammable, in cars). In commercial refrigeration also (R-744) can be used.

==Requirements and desirable properties==
A refrigerant needs to have: a boiling point that is somewhat below the target temperature (although boiling point can be adjusted by adjusting the pressure appropriately), a high heat of vaporization, a moderate density in liquid form, a relatively high density in gaseous form (which can also be adjusted by setting pressure appropriately), and a high critical temperature. Working pressures should ideally be containable by copper tubing, a commonly available material. Extremely high pressures should be avoided.

The ideal refrigerant would be: non-corrosive, non-toxic, non-flammable, with no ozone depletion and global warming potential. It should preferably be natural with well-studied and low environmental impact. Newer refrigerants address the issue of the damage that CFCs caused to the ozone layer and the contribution that HCFCs make to climate change, but some do raise issues relating to toxicity and/or flammability.

==Common refrigerants==
===Refrigerants with very low climate impact===
With increasing regulations, refrigerants with a very low global warming potential are expected to play a dominant role in the 21st century, in particular, R-290 and R-1234yf. Starting from almost no market share in 2018, low GWPO devices are gaining market share in 2022.

== Refrigerant reclamation and disposal ==

Coolant and refrigerants are found throughout the industrialized world, in homes, offices, and factories, in devices such as refrigerators, air conditioners, central air conditioning systems (HVAC), freezers, and dehumidifiers. When these units are serviced, there is a risk that refrigerant gas will be vented into the atmosphere either accidentally or intentionally, hence the creation of technician training and certification programs in order to ensure that the material is conserved and managed safely. Mistreatment of these gases has been shown to deplete the ozone layer and is suspected to contribute to global warming.

With the exception of isobutane and propane (R600a, R441A, and R290), ammonia and CO2 under Section 608 of the United States&#x27; Clean Air Act it is illegal to knowingly release any refrigerants into the atmosphere.

Refrigerant reclamation is the act of processing used refrigerant gas that has previously been used in some type of refrigeration loop such that it meets specifications for new refrigerant gas. In the United States, the Clean Air Act of 1990 requires that used refrigerant be processed by a certified reclaimer, which must be licensed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the material must be recovered and delivered to the reclaimer by EPA-certified technicians.

== Classification of refrigerants ==
Refrigerants may be divided into three classes according to their manner of absorption or extraction of heat from the substances to be refrigerated:
* Class 1: This class includes refrigerants that cool by phase change (typically boiling), using the refrigerant&#x27;s latent heat.
* Class 2: These refrigerants cool by temperature change or &#x27;sensible heat&#x27;, the quantity of heat being the specific heat capacity x the temperature change. They are air, calcium chloride brine, sodium chloride brine, alcohol, and similar nonfreezing solutions. The purpose of Class 2 refrigerants is to receive a reduction of temperature from Class 1 refrigerants and convey this lower temperature to the area to be cooled.
* Class 3: This group consists of solutions that contain absorbed vapors of liquefiable agents or refrigerating media. These solutions function by the nature of their ability to carry liquefiable vapors, which produce a cooling effect by the absorption of their heat of solution. They can also be classified into many categories.

===R numbering system===

The R- numbering system was developed by DuPont (which owned the Freon trademark), and systematically identifies the molecular structure of refrigerants made with a single halogenated hydrocarbon. ASHRAE has since set guidelines for the numbering system as follows:

R-X1X2X3X4

*X1 = Number of unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds (omit if zero)
*X2 = Number of carbon atoms minus 1 (omit if zero)
*X3 = Number of hydrogen atoms plus 1
*X4 = Number of fluorine atoms

====Series====
* R-xx Methane Series
* R-1xx Ethane Series
* R-2xx Propane Series
* R-4xx Zeotropic blend
* R-5xx Azeotropic blend
* R-6xx Saturated hydrocarbons (except for propane which is R-290)
* R-7xx Inorganic Compounds with a molar mass &lt; 100
* R-7xxx Inorganic Compounds with a molar mass ≥ 100

====Ethane Derived Chains====
* Number Only Most symmetrical isomer
* Lower Case Suffix (a, b, c, etc.) indicates increasingly unsymmetrical isomers

====Propane Derived Chains====
* Number Only If only one isomer exists; otherwise:
* First lower case suffix (a-f):
** a Suffix Cl2 central carbon substitution
** b Suffix Cl, F central carbon substitution
** c Suffix F2 central carbon substitution
**d Suffix Cl, H central carbon substitution
**e Suffix F, H central carbon substitution
** f Suffix H2 central carbon substitution
* 2nd Lower Case Suffix (a, b, c, etc.) Indicates increasingly unsymmetrical isomers

====Propene derivatives====
* First lower case suffix (x, y, z):
**x Suffix Cl substitution on central atom
** y Suffix F substitution on central atom
**z Suffix H substitution on central atom
* Second lower case suffix (a-f):
**a Suffix =CCl2 methylene substitution
** b Suffix =CClF methylene substitution
**c Suffix =CF2 methylene substitution
** d Suffix =CHCl methylene substitution
**e Suffix =CHF methylene substitution
**f Suffix =CH2 methylene substitution

====Blends====
* Upper Case Suffix (A, B, C, etc.) Same blend with different compositions of refrigerants

====Miscellaneous====
* R-Cxxx Cyclic compound
* R-Exxx Ether group is present
* R-CExxx Cyclic compound with an ether group
* R-4xx/5xx + Upper Case Suffix (A, B, C, etc.) Same blend with different composition of refrigerants
* R-6xx + Lower Case Letter Indicates increasingly unsymmetrical isomers
* 7xx/7xxx + Upper Case Letter Same molar mass, different compound
* R-xxxxB# Bromine is present with the number after B indicating how many bromine atoms
* R-xxxxI# Iodine is present with the number after I indicating how many iodine atoms
* R-xxx(E) Trans Molecule
* R-xxx(Z) Cis Molecule

For example, R-134a has 2 carbon atoms, 2 hydrogen atoms, and 4 fluorine atoms, an empirical formula of tetrafluoroethane. The &quot;a&quot; suffix indicates that the isomer is unbalanced by one atom, giving 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane. R-134 (without the &quot;a&quot; suffix) would have a molecular structure of 1,1,2,2-Tetrafluoroethane.

The same numbers are used with an R- prefix for generic refrigerants, with a &quot;Propellant&quot; prefix (e.g., &quot;Propellant 12&quot;) for the same chemical used as a propellant for an aerosol spray, and with trade names for the compounds, such as &quot;Freon 12&quot;. Recently, a practice of using abbreviations HFC- for hydrofluorocarbons, CFC- for chlorofluorocarbons, and HCFC- for hydrochlorofluorocarbons has arisen, because of the regulatory differences among these groups.

==Refrigerant safety==
ASHRAE Standard 34, &quot;Designation and Safety Classification of Refrigerants&quot;, assigns safety classifications to refrigerants based upon toxicity and flammability.

Using safety information provided by producers, ASHRAE assigns a capital letter to indicate toxicity and a number to indicate flammability. The letter &quot;A&quot; is the least toxic and the number 1 is the least flammable.

<text>Lenah H. Sutcliffe Higbee (May 18, 1874 – January 10, 1941) was a pioneering Canadian-born United States Navy military nurse, who served as Superintendent of the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps during World War I. She was the first woman to be awarded the Navy Cross.

==Early life and education==
Higbee was born Lenah H. Sutcliffe in Chatham, New Brunswick, Canada, on 18 May 1874. She completed nurses&#x27; training at the New York Post-Graduate Hospital in 1899 and entered private practice soon thereafter. Lenah Higbee took postgraduate training at Fordham Hospital, New York in 1908.

In 1899, she married retired Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel John H. Higbee. His first wife Isabel Higbee had died in 1898. John Higbee had served as a Marine Corps officer from 1861 to 1898. He died in April 1908 and was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

== Career ==
In October 1908, she joined the newly established U.S. Navy Nurse Corps as one of its first twenty members. These nurses, who came to be called &quot;The Sacred Twenty&quot;, were the first women to formally serve as members of the Navy. The Navy required its first Nurse Corps candidates to be between 22 and 44 years old and also unmarried. As a 34-year-old widow, Higbee met these requirements.

She was promoted to Chief Nurse in 1909. Lenah Higbee became Chief Nurse at Norfolk Naval Hospital in April 1909.

In January 1911, Higbee became the second Superintendent of the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps. For her achievements in leading the Corps through the First World War, Chief Nurse Higbee was the first woman awarded the Navy Cross. Navy nurses Marie Louise Hidell, Lillian M. Murphy and Edna E. Place were also awarded the Navy Cross in 1920 for their World War I service, but these women all received the award posthumously after having succumbed to the Spanish flu, which they contracted while caring for hospital patients.
===Navy Cross citation===
==Later life and death==
She resigned from the position of Superintendent and retired from the Navy on 23 November 1922.

Higbee died at Winter Park, Florida, on 10 January 1941 and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

==Legacy==
The US Navy has named two ships in her honor;
* , a commissioned in 1945, as the first U.S. Navy warship to bear the name of one of its female members.
* , an guided missile destroyer, commissioned 13 May 2023.

<doc id="592497" wikidata="Q13426919" url="?curid=592497" title="Vanellus">
<text>Vanellus is the genus of waders which provisionally contains all lapwings except red-kneed dotterel, &quot;Erythrogonys cinctus&quot;. The name &quot;vanellus&quot; is Latin for &quot;little fan&quot;, &quot;vanellus&quot; being the diminutive of &quot;vannus&quot; (&quot;winnowing fan&quot;). The name is in reference to the sound lapwings&#x27; wings make in flight.

==Description==
These long-legged waders mostly have strongly patterned plumage. Although the most familiar Eurasian lapwing, &quot;Vanellus vanellus&quot; (northern lapwing), has a wispy crest, only two other species do so. Red or yellow facial wattles are a more typical decoration.

Only northern, sociable, white-tailed, grey-headed and brown-chested lapwings are truly migratory species. The Andean lapwing moves downhill in winter.

Spur-winged, blacksmith, river, southern, Andean and pied lapwings are boldly patterned, red-eyed species with a spurred carpal (wrist) joint.

Many species have wattles which can be small (black-headed, spot-breasted, red-wattled and banded lapwings) or large (white-crowned, African wattled, yellow-wattled, Javan, and masked lapwings). The latter species are the largest of the plover family, since several exceed .

==Systematics==
The genus &quot;Vanellus&quot; was erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The name was derived by tautonymy from the original binomial name of the northern lapwing &quot;Tringa vanellus&quot; introduced by Linnaeus in 1758. &quot;Vanellus&quot; is the Medieval Latin for a &quot;lapwing&quot;. It is a diminutive of the Latin &quot;vanus&quot; meaning &quot;winnowing&quot; or &quot;fan&quot;.

The systematics of &quot;Vanellus&quot; have hitherto resisted clear resolution. Essentially, no major revision can be brought to agree with another, and up to 19 genera were at one time recognized for the 24 lapwing species. While it might be desirable to split up this large and diverse genus a bit, the morphological characters are a confusing mix of apomorphic and plesiomorphic traits in any one species, with few relationships readily apparent. Molecular data has been found to provide even less sufficient resolution, though the lapwings have not yet been as thoroughly studied under this aspect as other Charadriiformes.

The only thing that can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that according to the DNA sequence data one group of 5 species seems to stand out. These are wattle-less lapwings which were separated as &quot;Anitibyx&quot;, &quot;Belonopterus&quot;, &quot;Hoplopterus&quot; (in the narrow sense) and &quot;Ptiloscelys&quot;. They are visually very dissimilar, but it is notable that their distribution forms a clean band through the tropical regions of the world except Australia; they might conceivably form a clade. The only species among them that is migratory is the Andean lapwing (&quot;V. resplendens&quot;), which as noted above cannot be allied with the truly migratory lapwings on these grounds. However, if these were to be split off, for one thing it is almost certain that other lineages would also require separation; the new genus&#x27; name would probably be &quot;Hoplopterus&quot;, which is the longest- and most widely used alternative lapwing genus.

Alternatively placed in Ptiloscelys or &quot;Belonopterus&quot;:
* Andean lapwing, &quot;Vanellus resplendens&quot;

====Prehistoric species====
Species known only from fossil or subfossil remains include:
* †&quot;Vanellus madagascariensis&quot; (14th century Madagascar)
* †&quot;Vanellus liffyae&quot; (Late Pliocene of central Australia)
* †&quot;Vanellus lilloi&quot; (Middle/Late Pleistocene of Centinela del Mar, Argentina)
* †&quot;Vanellus downsi&quot; (Late Pleistocene of Rancho La Brea, USA)
* †&quot;Vanellus edmundi&quot; (Late Pleistocene of Talalra, Peru)

The last three of these seem to be very closely related to the southern lapwing and all were placed in &quot;Belonopterus&quot; by the describing authors. If &quot;Viator picis&quot;, also from the Late Pleistocene of Talara, does not belong to an entirely extinct lineage, it might belong to that group too; it seems too large to be closely related to the smallish pied lapwing.

Neither the Early Oligocene &quot;Dolicopterus&quot; from Ronzon, France nor the supposed mid-Oligocene lapwing &quot;&quot;Vanellus&quot; selysii&quot; of Rupelmonde (Belgium) unquestionably belong here. While their age suggests that they may indeed represent some ancient lapwings, the fossil remains have not been studied for many decades and a review is seriously overdue.

<doc id="592505" wikidata="Q1509884" url="?curid=592505" title="Padding (cryptography)">
<text>In cryptography, padding is any of a number of distinct practices which all include adding data to the beginning, middle, or end of a message prior to encryption. In classical cryptography, padding may include adding nonsense phrases to a message to obscure the fact that many messages end in predictable ways, e.g. &quot;sincerely yours&quot;.

==Classical cryptography==
Official messages often start and end in predictable ways: &quot;My dear ambassador, Weather report, Sincerely yours&quot;, etc. The primary use of padding with classical ciphers is to prevent the cryptanalyst from using that predictability to find known plaintext that aids in breaking the encryption. Random length padding also prevents an attacker from knowing the exact length of the plaintext message.

A famous example of classical padding which caused a great misunderstanding is &quot;the world wonders&quot; incident, which nearly caused an Allied loss at the World War II Battle off Samar, part of the larger Battle of Leyte Gulf. In that example, Admiral Chester Nimitz, the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet in WWII, sent the following message to Admiral Bull Halsey, commander of Task Force Thirty Four (the main Allied fleet) at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, on October 25, 1944:

With padding (bolded) and metadata added, the message became:

Halsey&#x27;s radio operator mistook some of the padding for the message and so Admiral Halsey ended up reading the following message:

Admiral Halsey interpreted the padding phrase &quot;the world wonders&quot; as a sarcastic reprimand, which caused him to have an emotional outburst and then lock himself in his bridge and sulk for an hour before he moved his forces to assist at the Battle off Samar. Halsey&#x27;s radio operator should have been tipped off by the letters &quot;RR&quot; that &quot;the world wonders&quot; was padding; all other radio operators who received Admiral Nimitz&#x27;s message correctly removed both padding phrases.

Many classical ciphers arrange the plaintext into particular patterns (e.g., squares, rectangles, etc.) and if the plaintext does not exactly fit, it is often necessary to supply additional letters to fill out the pattern. Using nonsense letters for this purpose has a side benefit of making some kinds of cryptanalysis more difficult.
==Symmetric cryptography==

===Hash functions===
Most modern cryptographic hash functions process messages in fixed-length blocks; all but the earliest hash functions include some sort of padding scheme. It is critical for cryptographic hash functions to employ termination schemes that prevent a hash from being vulnerable to length extension attacks.

Many padding schemes are based on appending predictable data to the final block. For example, the pad could be derived from the total length of the message. This kind of padding scheme is commonly applied to hash algorithms that use the Merkle–Damgård construction such as MD-5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 family such as SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, and SHA-512/256

===Block cipher mode of operation===
Cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode is an example of block cipher mode of operation. Some block cipher modes (CBC and PCBC essentially) for symmetric-key encryption algorithms require plain text input that is a multiple of the block size, so messages may have to be padded to bring them to this length.
There is currently a shift to use streaming mode of operation instead of block mode of operation. An example of streaming mode encryption is the counter mode of operation. Streaming modes of operation can encrypt and decrypt messages of any size and therefore do not require padding. More intricate ways of ending a message such as ciphertext stealing or residual block termination avoid the need for padding.

A disadvantage of padding is that it makes the plain text of the message susceptible to padding oracle attacks. Padding oracle attacks allow the attacker to gain knowledge of the plain text without attacking the block cipher primitive itself. Padding oracle attacks can be avoided by making sure that an attacker cannot gain knowledge about the removal of the padding bytes. This can be accomplished by verifying a message authentication code (MAC) or digital signature &quot;before&quot; removal of the padding bytes, or by switching to a streaming mode of operation.

====Bit padding====
Bit padding can be applied to messages of any size.

A single &#x27;1&#x27; bit is added to the message and then as many &#x27;0&#x27; bits as required (possibly none) are added. The number of &#x27;0&#x27; bits added will depend on the block boundary to which the message needs to be extended. In bit terms this is &quot;1000 ... 0000&quot;.

This method can be used to pad messages which are any number of bits long, not necessarily a whole number of bytes long. For example, a message of 23 bits that is padded with 9 bits in order to fill a 32-bit block:

 ... | 1011 1001 1101 0100 0010 0111 0000 0000 |

This padding is the first step of a two-step padding scheme used in many hash functions including MD5 and SHA. In this context, it is specified by RFC1321 step 3.1.

This padding scheme is defined by ISO/IEC 9797-1 as Padding Method 2.

====Byte padding====

Byte padding can be applied to messages that can be encoded as an integral number of bytes.

=====ANSI X9.23=====

In ANSI X9.23, between 1 and 8 bytes are always added as padding. The block is padded with random bytes (although many implementations use 00) and the last byte of the block is set to the number of bytes added.

Example:
In the following example the block size is 8 bytes, and padding is required for 4 bytes (in hexadecimal format)

 ... | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD | DD DD DD DD 00 00 00 04 |

=====ISO 10126=====

ISO 10126 (withdrawn, 2007) specifies that the padding should be done at the end of that last block with random bytes, and the padding boundary should be specified by the last byte.

Example:
In the following example the block size is 8 bytes and padding is required for 4 bytes

 ... | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD | DD DD DD DD 81 A6 23 04 |

=====PKCS#5 and PKCS#7=====
PKCS#7 is described in RFC 5652.

Padding is in whole bytes. The value of each added byte is the number of bytes that are added, i.e. bytes, each of value are added. The number of bytes added will depend on the block boundary to which the message needs to be extended.

The padding will be one of:

 01
 02 02
 03 03 03
 04 04 04 04
 05 05 05 05 05
 06 06 06 06 06 06
 etc.

This padding method (as well as the previous two) is well-defined if and only if is less than 256.

Example:
In the following example, the block size is 8 bytes and padding is required for 4 bytes

 ... | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD | DD DD DD DD 04 04 04 04 |

If the length of the original data is an integer multiple of the block size , then an extra block of bytes with value is added. This is necessary so the deciphering algorithm can determine with certainty whether the last byte of the last block is a pad byte indicating the number of padding bytes added or part of the plaintext message. Consider a plaintext message that is an integer multiple of bytes with the last byte of plaintext being 01. With no additional information, the deciphering algorithm will not be able to determine whether the last byte is a plaintext byte or a pad byte. However, by adding bytes each of value after the 01 plaintext byte, the deciphering algorithm can always treat the last byte as a pad byte and strip the appropriate number of pad bytes off the end of the ciphertext; said number of bytes to be stripped based on the value of the last byte.

PKCS#5 padding is identical to PKCS#7 padding, except that it has only been defined for block ciphers that use a 64-bit (8-byte) block size. In practice, the two can be used interchangeably.

The maximum block size is 255, as it is the biggest number a byte can contain.

=====ISO/IEC 7816-4=====

ISO/IEC 7816-4:2005 is identical to the bit padding scheme, applied to a plain text of &quot;N&quot; bytes. This means in practice that the first byte is a mandatory byte valued &#x27;80&#x27; (Hexadecimal) followed, if needed, by 0 to &quot;N&quot; − 1 bytes set to &#x27;00&#x27;, until the end of the block is reached. ISO/IEC 7816-4 itself is a communication standard for smart cards containing a file system, and in itself does not contain any cryptographic specifications.

Example:
In the following example the block size is 8 bytes and padding is required for 4 bytes

 ... | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD | DD DD DD DD 80 00 00 00 |

The next example shows a padding of just one byte

 ... | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD 80 |

=====Zero padding=====

All the bytes that are required to be padded are padded with zero. The zero padding scheme has not been standardized for encryption, although it is specified for hashes and MACs as Padding Method 1 in ISO/IEC 10118-1 and ISO/IEC 9797-1.

Example:
In the following example the block size is 8 bytes and padding is required for 4 bytes

 ... | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD | DD DD DD DD 00 00 00 00 |

Zero padding may not be reversible if the original file ends with one or more zero bytes, making it impossible to distinguish between plaintext data bytes and padding bytes. It may be used when the length of the message can be derived out-of-band. It is often applied to binary encoded strings (null-terminated string) as the null character can usually be stripped off as whitespace.

Zero padding is sometimes also referred to as &quot;null padding&quot; or &quot;zero byte padding&quot;. Some implementations may add an additional block of zero bytes if the plaintext is already divisible by the block size.

==Public key cryptography==
In public key cryptography, padding is the process of preparing a message for encryption or signing using a specification or scheme such as PKCS#1 v2.2, OAEP, PSS, PSSR, IEEE P1363 EMSA2 and EMSA5. A modern form of padding for asymmetric primitives is OAEP applied to the RSA algorithm, when it is used to encrypt a limited number of bytes.

The operation is referred to as &quot;padding&quot; because originally, random material was simply appended to the message to make it long enough for the primitive. This form of padding is not secure and is therefore no longer applied. A modern padding scheme aims to ensure that the attacker cannot manipulate the plaintext to exploit the mathematical structure of the primitive and will usually be accompanied by a proof, often in the random oracle model, that breaking the padding scheme is as hard as solving the hard problem underlying the primitive.

==Traffic analysis and protection via padding==

Even if perfect cryptographic routines are used, the attacker can gain knowledge of the amount of traffic that was generated. The attacker might not know what Alice and Bob were talking about, but can know that they &quot;were&quot; talking and &quot;how much&quot; they talked. In some circumstances this leakage can be highly compromising. Consider for example when a military is organising a secret attack against another nation: it may suffice to alert the other nation for them to know merely that there &quot;is&quot; a lot of secret activity going on.

As another example, when encrypting Voice Over IP streams that use variable bit rate encoding, the number of bits per unit of time is not obscured, and this can be exploited to guess spoken phrases. Similarly, the burst patterns that common video encoders produce are often sufficient to identify the streaming video a user is watching uniquely. Even the &quot;total size&quot; of an object alone, such as a website, file, software package download, or online video, can uniquely identify an object, if the attacker knows or can guess a known set the object comes from. The side-channel of encrypted content length was used to extract passwords from HTTPS communications in the well-known CRIME and BREACH attacks.

Padding an encrypted message can make traffic analysis harder by obscuring the true length of its payload. The choice of length to pad a message to may be made either deterministically or randomly; each approach has strengths and weaknesses that apply in different contexts.

===Randomized padding===

A random number of additional padding bits or bytes may be appended to the end of a message, together with an indication at the end how much padding was added. If the amount of padding is chosen as a uniform random number between 0 and some maximum M, for example, then an eavesdropper will be unable to determine the message&#x27;s length precisely within that range. If the maximum padding M is small compared to the message&#x27;s total size, then this padding will not add much overhead, but the padding will obscure only the least-significant bits of the object&#x27;s total length, leaving the approximate length of large objects readily observable and hence still potentially uniquely identifiable by their length. If the maximum padding M is comparable to the size of the payload, in contrast, an eavesdropper&#x27;s uncertainty about the message&#x27;s true payload size is much larger, at the cost that padding may add up to 100% overhead ( blow-up) to the message.

In addition, in common scenarios in which an eavesdropper has the opportunity to see &quot;many&quot; successive messages from the same sender, and those messages are similar in ways the attacker knows or can guess, then the eavesdropper can use statistical techniques to decrease and eventually even eliminate the benefit of randomized padding. For example, suppose a user&#x27;s application regularly sends messages of the same length, and the eavesdropper knows or can guess fact based on fingerprinting the user&#x27;s application for example. Alternatively, an active attacker might be able to &quot;induce&quot; an endpoint to send messages regularly, such as if the victim is a public server. In such cases, the eavesdropper can simply compute the average over many observations to determine the length of the regular message&#x27;s payload.

===Deterministic padding===

A deterministic padding scheme always pads a message payload of a given length to form an encrypted message of a particular corresponding output length. When many payload lengths map to the same padded output length, an eavesdropper cannot distinguish or learn any information about the payload&#x27;s true length within one of these length &quot;buckets&quot;, even after many observations of the identical-length messages being transmitted. In this respect, deterministic padding schemes have the advantage of not leaking any additional information with each successive message of the same payload size.

On the other hand, suppose an eavesdropper can benefit from learning about &quot;small&quot; variations in payload size, such as plus or minus just one byte in a password-guessing attack for example. If the message sender is unlucky enough to send many messages whose payload lengths vary by only one byte, and that length is exactly on the border between two of the deterministic padding classes, then these plus-or-minus one payload lengths will consistently yield different padded lengths as well (plus-or-minus one block for example), leaking exactly the fine-grained information the attacker desires. Against such risks, randomized padding can offer more protection by independently obscuring the least-significant bits of message lengths.

Common deterministic padding methods include padding to a constant block size and padding to the next-larger power of two. Like randomized padding with a small maximum amount &quot;M&quot;, however, padding deterministically to a block size much smaller than the message payload obscures only the least-significant bits of the messages true length, leaving the messages&#x27;s true approximate length largely unprotected. Padding messages to a power of two (or any other fixed base) reduces the maximum amount of information that the message can leak via its length from to . Padding to a power of two increases message size overhead by up to 100%, however, and padding to powers of larger integer bases increase maximum overhead further.

The PADMÉ scheme, proposed for padded uniform random blobs or PURBs, deterministically pads messages to lengths representable as a floating point number whose mantissa is no longer (i.e., contains no more significant bits) than its exponent. This length constraint ensures that a message leaks at most bits of information via its length, like padding to a power of two, but incurs much less overhead of at most 12% for tiny messages and decreasing gradually with message size.

<text>A sinking fund is a fund established by an economic entity by setting aside revenue over a period of time to fund a future capital expense, or repayment of a long-term debt.

In North America and elsewhere where it is common for government entities and private corporations to raise funds through the issue of bonds, the term is normally used in this context. However, in the United Kingdom and elsewhere where the issue of bonds (other than government bonds) is unusual, and where long-term leasehold tenancies are common, the term is only normally used in the context of replacement or renewal of capital assets, particularly the common parts of buildings.

==Historical context==

=== Great Britain ===

The sinking fund was first used in Great Britain in the 18th century to reduce national debt. While used by Robert Walpole in 1716 and effectively in the 1720s and early 1730s, it originated in the commercial tax syndicates of the Italian peninsula of the 14th century, where its function was to retire redeemable public debt of those cities.

The fund received whatever surplus occurred in the national Budget each year. However, the problem was that the fund was rarely given any priority in government strategy. The result of this was that the funds were often raided by the Treasury when they needed funds quickly.

In 1772, the nonconformist minister Richard Price published a pamphlet on methods of reducing the national debt. The pamphlet caught the interest of William Pitt the Younger, who drafted a proposal to reform the &quot;Sinking Fund&quot; in 1786. Lord North recommended &quot;the Creation of a Fund, to be appropriated, and invariably applied, under proper Direction, in the gradual Diminution of the Debt&quot;. Pitt&#x27;s way of securing &quot;proper Direction&quot; was to introduce legislation that prevented ministers from raiding the fund in crises. He also increased taxes to ensure that a £1 million surplus could be used to reduce the national debt. The legislation also placed administration of the fund in the hands of &quot;Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt&quot;.

The scheme worked well between 1786 and 1793 with the Commissioners receiving £8 million and reinvesting it to reduce the debt by more than £10 million. However, the outbreak of war with France in 1793 &quot;destroyed the rationale of the Sinking Fund&quot; (Eric Evans). The fund was abandoned by Lord Liverpool&#x27;s government only in the 1820s.

=== United States ===
A federal Sinking Fund Commission was established by the 1st United States Congress.

Sinking funds were also seen commonly in investment in the 19th century in the United States, especially with highly invested markets like railroads. An example would be the Central Pacific Railroad Company, which challenged the constitutionality of mandatory sinking funds for companies in the case &quot;In re Sinking Funds Cases&quot; in 1878.

==Modern context – bond repayment==
In modern finance, a sinking fund is, generally, a method by which an organization sets aside money over time to retire its indebtedness. More specifically, it is a fund into which money can be deposited, so that over time preferred stock, debentures or stocks can be retired. See also &quot;sinking fund provision&quot; under Bond (finance)#Features.

In some US states, Michigan for example, school districts may ask the voters to approve a taxation for the purpose of establishing a sinking fund. The State Treasury Department has strict guidelines for expenditure of fund dollars with the penalty for misuse being an eternal ban on ever seeking the tax levy again.

===Types===
A sinking fund may operate in one or more of the following ways:
# The firm may repurchase a fraction of the outstanding bonds in the open market each year.
# The firm may repurchase a fraction of outstanding bonds at a special call price associated with the sinking fund provision (they are callable bonds).
# The firm has the option to repurchase the bonds at either the market price or the sinking fund price, whichever is lower. To allocate the burden of the sinking fund call fairly among bondholders, the bonds chosen for the call are selected at random based on serial number. The firm can only repurchase a limited fraction of the bond issue at the sinking fund price. At best some indentures allow firms to use a &quot;doubling option&quot;, which allows repurchase of double the required number of bonds at the sinking fund price.
# A less common provision is to call for periodic payments to a trustee, with the payments invested so that the accumulated sum can be used for retirement of the entire issue at maturity: instead of the debt amortizing over the life, the debt remains outstanding and a matching asset accrues. In this way a fund is built up with the intention of paying off the debt in full at a specified future date instead of directly paying the debt down over time. This method was popular in the 1980s-90&#x27;s in the UK household mortgage market.

===Benefits and drawbacks===
For the organization retiring debt, it has the benefit that the principal of the debt or at least part of it, will be available when due, so that the organization does not need to pay a large amount of money when due, and thus a heavy disruption to the financial position of the organization can be avoided. For the creditors, the fund reduces the risk the organization will default due to financial hardship caused by the large payment, when the principal is due: it reduces credit risk.

However, if the bonds are callable, this comes at a cost to creditors, because the organization has an option on the bonds:

* The firm will choose to buy back discount bonds (selling below par) at their market price,
* while exercising its option to buy back premium bonds (selling above par) at par.

Therefore, if interest rates fall and bond prices rise, a firm will benefit from the sinking fund provision that enables it to repurchase its bonds at below-market prices. In this case, the firm&#x27;s gain is the bondholder&#x27;s loss – thus callable bonds will typically be issued at a higher coupon rate, reflecting the value of the option.

==Modern context – capital expenditure==

Sinking funds can also be used to set aside money for purposes of replacing capital equipment as it becomes obsolete, or major maintenance or renewal of elements of a fixed asset, typically a building.

Historically, the term &quot;sinking fund&quot; was only used to refer to replacement of an asset and &quot;reserve fund&quot; was used for major maintenance or renewal. However, since the mid 2010&#x27;s the terms are now used interchangeably in the United Kingdom.

===Other applications===
Though the term is often associated to business situations, it has gained popularity as a term people use when they use zero-based budgeting or cash envelope budgeting. In this application, the term &quot;sinking fund&quot; represents a type of category in a person&#x27;s budget that they allocate money towards for future expenses including those that are long-term and short-term. Money is often allocated towards these sinking funds and can be taken out at any time.

<doc id="592507" wikidata="Q4348725" url="?curid=592507" title="Diet of Finland">
<text>The Diet of Finland (Finnish &quot;Suomen maapäivät&quot;, later &quot;valtiopäivät&quot;; Swedish &quot;Finlands Lantdagar&quot;), was the legislative assembly of the Grand Duchy of Finland from 1809 to 1906 and the recipient of the powers of the Swedish Riksdag of the Estates. (The term &quot;valtiopäivät&quot; today means an annual session of the Parliament of Finland, while in Swedish &quot;Riksdagen&quot; is now the name for both the Parliament and its sessions.)

== Åbo Lantdag ==

The first States of Finland were held in Helsinki in 1616. Other assemblies &quot;(Åbo lantdag)&quot; were held in Turku, for example in 1676. The assembly was called together by Axel Julius De la Gardie. The estate of peasants was chaired by Heikki Heikinpoika Vaanila.

== The Porvoo Diet ==

During the Finnish War between Sweden and Russia, the four Estates of occupied Finland (Nobility, Clergy, Bourgeoisie and Peasants) were assembled at Porvoo (Borgå) by Tsar Alexander I, the new Grand Duke of Finland, between 25 March and 19 July 1809. The central event at Porvoo was the taking of the sovereign pledge and the oaths of the Estates in Porvoo Cathedral on 29 March. Each of the Estates swore an oath of allegiance, committing themselves to accepting the Emperor as Grand Duke of Finland, and to keeping the constitution and the form of government unchanged. Alexander I subsequently promised to govern Finland in accordance with its laws. This was thought to mean that the emperor confirmed the Swedish Instrument of Government of 1772 as the constitution of Finland, although it was also interpreted to mean that all existing codes and statutes were to be respected. The Diet required that it be convened again after the Finnish War, which separated Finland from Sweden, was concluded. On 17 September that year, the conflict was settled by the Treaty of Fredrikshamn, but it was another 54 years before the Finnish Estates were called to assemble again.

== The Estates convene again ==

Not until June 1863, after the Crimean War had taken place, did Alexander II call the Estates again. The opening ceremony was held on 18 September and the Emperor made his declaration promising to introduce changes to the constitution, including having the Diet meet regularly. The Diet duly met again in January 1867, when it passed a law on its own procedures. The Diet was to meet at least every fifth year, but in practice it met every third year. 

In the elections for the Diet of 1872, members of the two language-based parties, the Fennomans and the Svecomans, gained more ground at the expense of the liberals. After the assassination of Alexander II the special position of Finland in the Russian empire was put in danger. Alexander III announced that the Finnish monetary, customs and postal systems were to be incorporated into their imperial counterparts. At the Diet of 1882 the Governor General announced that the Diet would have the right to submit bills, but only the Emperor would be able to initiate changes in the constitution or in the Military of the Grand Duchy of Finland.

== The first period of oppression ==

In 1899 Grand Duke Nicholas II signed what came to be known as the February Manifesto. The powers of the diet regarding Finland&#x27;s internal affairs were weakened and transferred to the Russian ministers. The legal committee of the diet of 1899 adopted the opinion that the manifesto was not legally valid in Finland.

== Reform ==
The unrest during the Russo-Japanese War resulted in a general strike in Finland in October 1905. The most immediate result was the emperor&#x27;s manifesto that cancelled all illegal regulations. A parliament based on universal and equal suffrage was also promised. An extraordinary session of the diet in December 1905 was called to implement the parliamentary reforms. The proposal was presented to the emperor on 15 March 1906 and after his approval it was submitted to the estates on 9 May. The reforms came to force on 1 October 1906. The diet was reformed from a legislative assembly of four estates into a unicameral parliament of 200 members. At the same time universal suffrage was introduced, which gave all men and women, 24 years or older, the right to vote and stand for election. Acts on the right of parliament to monitor members of the government, on the freedom of speech, assembly and association, and freedom of the press were also introduced. These reforms established the hallmarks of today&#x27;s Parliament of Finland. The first election to the new parliament was arranged in 1907.

== Composition and procedure 1869–1906 ==

From 1869 to 1906, the Diet of Finland was tetracameral, being composed as follows:
* Nobility: 201 seats; the heads of noble families had the right either to sit in person or to name a family member as a representative.
* Clergy: 40 seats; included bishops, priests elected from each bishopric, and elected representatives of university personnel and other senior teachers.
* Bourgeoisie: 30–70 seats; these were the representatives of the people living in cities, but only men with taxable wealth were eligible to vote. The number of seats rose when the number of such men grew.
* Peasants: 70 seats; elected through indirect elections in which only peasants who owned land, about 4.5 per cent of the rural population in the early 1900s, could vote. Each municipality in a given rural district chose at least one elector, and these electors together chose the representative for their district.

Normally, all four chambers debated separately, and in the whole history of the Diet there were only two joint sessions, at which voting was not permitted. At least three of the four chambers had to pass a bill before it could be approved by the Emperor. Consensus was sought through joint committees. Any bill affecting the privileges of an estate could be passed only with the consent of that estate. All four chambers had to agree in order to modify constitutional laws.

== Sessions and meeting places of the Diet ==

* 1809 (January to July);
* 1863–1864 (September 1863 to April 1864);
* 1867 (January to May);
* 1872 (February to June);
* 1877–1878; (January 1877 to January 1878);
* 1882 (January to June);
* 1885 (January to May);
* 1888 (January to May);
* 1891 (January to May);
* 1894 (January to June);
* 1897 (January to June);
* 1899 (January to May);
* 1900 (January to June);
* 1904–1905 (December 1904 to April 1905);
* 1906 (January to September);

The Diet of Finland, and the four estates of which it was composed, met in a number of different locations during its existence. In the 1860s, all the estates met in the Finnish House of Nobility. The Nobility of Finland continued to meet there until 1906, but the three commoner estates later met in other locations, such as in 1888, when they met in the new building of the Ateneum Art Museum. From 1891 until the parliamentary reform of 1906 the three commoner estates of Clergy, Bourgeoisie and Peasants met in the newly built House of the Estates (Finnish &quot;Säätytalo&quot;, Swedish &quot;Ständerhuset&quot;). However, the meeting rooms of the house were too small for the 200-member unicameral parliament. The house has since seen sporadic use by the state, and regular use by scientific and scholarly organizations.

<text>Arnaud George Watson Massy (; 6 July 1877 – 16 April 1950) was one of France&#x27;s most successful professional golfers, most notable for winning the 1907 Open Championship.

==Early life==
Massy was born in Biarritz, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France. The son of a sheep farmer, he worked on a sardine boat and supplemented his income by caddying at the new Biarritz golf course where a great many of the best professional golfers from Britain came to practice during the off-season in the warm climate of southern France. Blessed with natural abilities, he learned from these pro golfers and in 1898 traveled to North Berwick, Scotland to develop his skills for a professional career.

==Golf career==
In 1906, Massy won the first edition of the French Open played at a Paris course. The following year he won it again, defeating a strong contingent of British players including the great Harry Vardon. But Massy wasn&#x27;t through, he followed up his French national championship by becoming the first non-Briton to win The Open Championship (British Open). His victory raised the profile of the game in his native France, and with three other major players, he put on exhibition matches in various European cities that contributed significantly to the increased popularity of golf on the continent.

In 1910, Massy won the inaugural Belgian Open and in 1911 was the runner-up at the Open Championship to Harry Vardon. That year, Massy completed his book on golfing that was successfully published in France then translated into English for the British market. In 1912, he won the first Spanish Open ever played.

In 1913 he played in the France–United States Professional Match. In 1926 he won an exhibition match against Bobby Jones in France.

Massy&#x27;s golfing career had to be put on hold as a result of World War I. While serving in the French army he was wounded at Verdun but at war&#x27;s end was able to return to golfing. At age 41, he had lost four prime years and struggled to compete. Remarkably, in 1925 at age 48, he won the French Open for the fourth time and then won back-to-back Spanish Opens in 1927–28. When his career finally wound down he worked as a pro at courses in England, France and Morocco. Married to a British woman, Janet Henderson, originally from North Berwick, East Lothian, he lived in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the 1920s and early 1930s.

==Death and legacy==
Massy retired in Étretat, Seine-Maritime in Upper Normandy where he died in 1950 in poverty. He remains the only French golfer to ever have won any of the four men&#x27;s major championships. He was also the only golfer from continental Europe to win a men&#x27;s major championship before Seve Ballesteros won The Open Championship in 1979.

He is buried in Newington Cemetery in Edinburgh, where a new headstone was recently erected by the European Golf Association, Golf Collectors and The R&amp;A. However shortly after the ceremony it was discovered that the actual burial site was located nearby in the cemetery. Despite this discrepancy, the headstone remains in its incorrect location. There is a plaque commemorating him fixed on the wall of the house he originally lived in North Berwick, East Lothian, in Forth Street there.

<doc id="592509" wikidata="Q2457646" url="?curid=592509" title="Diet of Porvoo">
<text>The Diet of Porvoo (, or unhistorically ; ; ), was the summoned legislative assembly to establish the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1809 and the heir of the powers of the Swedish Riksdag of the Estates. The session of the Diet lasted from March to July 1809.

During the Finnish War between Sweden and Russia, the four Estates of Russian-occupied Finland (nobility, clergy, burghers and peasants) were assembled in Porvoo &quot;(Borgå)&quot; by Tsar Alexander I, the new Grand Prince of Finland, between 25 March and 19 July 1809.

Finnish historians disagree on whether the Diet of Porvoo was the first meeting of The Estates in the history of Finland or a traditional &quot;landtag&quot; where the eight easternmost regions of Sweden were transferred under the authority of the Emperor of Russia. According to the interpretation of the Finnish constitution born later in the 19th century, the state of Finland was born at the Diet of Porvoo. The historian Henrika Tandefelt claims that the Porvoo Diet could not have been a &quot;riksdag&quot; (&quot;meeting of the state&quot;) as there was no state to speak of at the time.

== Preparation ==
The acting Governor-General of Finland Göran Magnus Sprengtporten made a plan for the government of Finland, which the Emperor confirmed on 1 December 1808. The delegation of the Estates in Finland had already sworn their loyalty to the Emperor in Saint Petersburg in the autumn. The delegation was told that the Emperor would be assembling a diet. Sprengtporten was given the task of preparing for the diet. The Estates received an invitation to attend the diet in Porvoo on 1 February 1809.

The decision to hold the diet in Porvoo was influenced by the still ongoing Finnish War and that the cities of Turku and Hämeenlinna were located too far away from the border to Russia. There had been a large fire in Helsinki in the previous year and there were no suitable premises for the diet in the city, neither were there any in Loviisa. So Porvoo was chosen as the location of the diet, which was opened at the Porvoo Cathedral. The main lecture hall of the Borgå Gymnasium acted as the main hall of the diet. The estate of the clergy also worked at the gymnasium. The estates of the nobility and the bourgeoisie were assembled at the Porvoo Town Hall and the estate of the peasants at the house of the lawspeaker Anders Fabian Orraeus.

== Events ==
The central event at Porvoo was the sovereign pledge and the oaths of the Estates in Porvoo Cathedral on 29 March. All of the Estates swore their oaths of allegiance, committing themselves to accepting the Emperor as Grand Prince of Finland as the true authority and to keep the constitution and the form of government unchanged. Alexander I subsequently promised to govern Finland in accordance with its laws and let the Finnish keep their religion and rights. This was thought to essentially mean that the emperor confirmed the Swedish Instrument of Government from 1772 as the constitution of Finland, although it was also interpreted to simply mean respecting other, &quot;subordinate laws&quot; - existing codes and other statutes.

The diet had required that it would be convened again after the Finnish War, which separated Finland from Sweden, had been concluded. On 17 September, the conflict was settled by the Treaty of Fredrikshamn, but it would take five decades for the Finnish Estates to be called again.

== Sovereign&#x27;s pledge ==

The Finnish translation of the sovereign&#x27;s pledge given by Alexander I in old-style Finnish read as follows:
&quot;Me Alexander I... Suuri Ruhtinas Suomen maasa... : Wakutus-Kirja... Annettu Borgåsa sinä 15/27 päiwänä Maaliskuusa 1809.&quot;

(ME ALEXANDER I., Jumalan Armosta, Kejsari ja Itsewaldias yli koko Ryssänmaan. Suuri Ruhtinas Suomen maasa Teemme tiettäwäxi: Että sitte kuin ME Sen Korkeimman edeskatsomisesta olemma ottanet Suuren Ruhtinan maan Suomen hallituxemme ala, olemma ME tämän kautta tahtoneet wahvistaa ja kiinittää Maasa olevan Christillisen Opin ja perustus- lait niin myös niitä wapauxia ja oikeuxia, kuin kukin Sääty nimitetysä Suuresa Ruh- tinan maasa erinomattain, ja kaikki sen Asuwaiset yhteisesti, niin ylhäiset kuin alhaiset tähän saakka Constitutionin eli säättämisen jälkeen owat nautinneet: Lupaamme myös pitää kaikkia niitä etuja ja asetuxia wahwana ja järkähtämättämänä heidän täydellisä woimasansa. Suuremmaxi wisseydexi olemma ME tämän Wakutus-Kirjan MEIDÄN omalla kädellämme ala kirjoittaneet. Annettu Borgåsa sinä 15/27* päiwänä Maalis- Kuusa 1809.

Pääkirja on korkiammasti omalla kädellä alakirjoitetu

ALEXANDER.)

English translation:
&quot;We Alexander I... Grand Duke in Finland... Pledge... Given in Borgå on the 15th/27th day of March in 1809.&quot;

(WE ALEXANDER I, by the Grace of God, Emperor and Autocrat over the entire country of Russia, Grand Duke in Finland, do hereby make it known: That as WE by the providence of The Highest One have taken the Grand Duchy of Finland under our government, have WE hereby wanted to strengthen and fasten the Christian doctrine and constitutional laws in the country, as well as those liberties and rights as the each estate in the aforementioned Grand Duchy, and all its inhabitants in general, the nobles along with the commoners have thus far enjoyed under the Constitution: We also promise to upkeep all these privileges and statures in their full authority. For greater confirmation have WE signed this pledge by OUR own hand. Given at Borgå on the 15th/27th day of March in 1809.

The pledge has been signed by own hand

ALEXANDER.)

== Participants ==
The Diet of Porvoo had participants from different estates as follows:

* Nobility: 75 representatives, chairman lantmarskalk count Robert Wilhelm De Geer.
* Clergy: 8 representatives, chairman bishop of Turku Jakob Tengström
* Burghers: 20 representatives, chairman merchant Kristian Trapp, Turku 
* Peasants: 31 representatives, chairman Pehr Klockars Nykarleby

Out of 205 noble families, 130 were not represented in the diet, and 60 of the representatives did not attend the opening ceremony. The burghers were represented mainly by merchants.

== Later interpretations ==
The Finns interpreted the Emperor&#x27;s oath and the oath of loyalty of the Estates as a non-unilateral act that neither party, whether it be the people of Finland or the Emperor, could not unilaterally dissolve. The Russians also did not question the status of the state of Finland before the late 19th century. Their interpretation was that the Emperor could not have promised the Finns a position that would have contradicted his authority.

There has been a lot of controversy about why Finland was granted an autonomous position at the Diet of Porvoo. The reasons relating to foreign politics and national security were clearly present when the status of Finland changed. Finland had been conquered to make it into an outpost of Russia and a western protective zone for Saint Petersburg. With the autonomy, the Finns could be more easily made to favour their new ruler. The still underdeveloped Russian government also lacked the framework to which the corresponding elements in Finland could have been merged into.

During the rise of Finnish nationalism later in the 19th century, it was claimed that the Diet implied that a treaty between states had been signed at the Diet between Finland and Russia. According to Emeritus Professor Osmo Jussila of the Helsinki University, it is true that Alexander said that Finland had been raised to the status of a nation among nations, but the claim of a treaty between equals was simply a device invented for the political realities of the struggle for independence.

The meeting of the Estates in Porvoo in 1809 has been a point of question ever since the late 19th century in both politics and history. For example, according to Leo Mechelin, the connection between Finland and Russia was only a personal union between sovereign states, but many Finnish and especially Russian researchers have seen the special position of Finland as based on the Emperor&#x27;s goodwill which meant he could also have dissolved it.

The Finnish term &quot;valtiopäivät&quot; (&quot;state days&quot;) is also an established name for the event, but nowadays many historians speak of &quot;maapäivät&quot; (&quot;land days&quot;), which is a direct translation from the Swedish term &quot;&quot;Borgå lantdag&quot;. There has also been a mention that the Swedish term &quot;riksdag&quot;&quot; could not have been used as there was no state to speak of.

<doc id="592513" wikidata="Q841960" url="?curid=592513" title="Superlubricity">
<text>Superlubricity is a regime of relative motion in which friction vanishes or very nearly vanishes. However, the definition of &quot;vanishing&quot; friction level is not clear, which makes the term vague. As an &quot;ad hoc&quot; definition, a kinetic coefficient of friction less than 0.01 can be adopted. This definition also requires further discussion and clarification.

Superlubricity may occur when two crystalline surfaces slide over each other in dry incommensurate contact. This was first described in the early 1980s for Frenkel–Kontorova models and is called the Aubry transition. It has been extensively studied as a mathematical model, in atomistic simulations and in a range of experimental systems.

This effect, also called structural lubricity, was verified between two graphite surfaces in 2004.
The atoms in graphite are oriented in a hexagonal manner and form an atomic hill-and-valley landscape, which looks like an egg-crate. When the two graphite surfaces are in registry (every 60 degrees), the friction force is high. When the two surfaces are rotated out of registry, the friction is greatly reduced. This is like two egg-crates which can slide over each other more easily when they are &quot;twisted&quot; with respect to each other.

Observation of superlubricity in microscale graphite structures was reported in 2012, by shearing a square graphite mesa a few micrometers across, and observing the self-retraction of the sheared layer. Such effects were also theoretically described for a model of graphene and nickel layers. This observation, which is reproducible even under ambient conditions, shifts interest in superlubricity from a primarily academic topic, accessible only under highly idealized conditions, to one with practical implications for micro and nanomechanical devices.

A state of ultralow friction can also be achieved when a sharp tip slides over a flat surface and the applied load is below a certain threshold. Such a &quot;superlubric&quot; threshold depends on the tip-surface interaction and the stiffness of the materials in contact, as described by the Tomlinson model.
The threshold can be significantly increased by exciting the sliding system at its resonance frequency, which suggests a practical way to limit wear in nanoelectromechanical systems.

Superlubricity was also observed between a gold AFM tip and Teflon substrate due to repulsive Van der Waals forces and hydrogen-bonded layer formed by glycerol on the steel surfaces. Formation of the hydrogen-bonded layer was also shown to lead to superlubricity between quartz glass surfaces lubricated by biological liquid obtained from mucilage of Brasenia schreberi. Other mechanisms of superlubricity may include: (a) thermodynamic repulsion due to a layer of free or grafted macromolecules between the bodies so that the entropy of the intermediate layer decreases at small distances due to stronger confinement; (b) electrical repulsion due to external electrical voltage; (c) repulsion due to electrical double layer; (d) repulsion due to thermal fluctuations.

The similarity of the term &quot;superlubricity&quot; with terms such as superconductivity and superfluidity is misleading; other energy dissipation mechanisms can lead to a finite (normally small) friction force. Superlubricity is more analogous to phenomena such as superelasticity, in which substances such as Nitinol have very low, but nonzero, elastic moduli; supercooling, in which substances remain liquid until a lower-than-normal temperature; super black, which reflects very little light; giant magnetoresistance, in which very large but finite magnetoresistance effects are observed in alternating nonmagnetic and ferromagnetic layers; superhard materials, which are diamond or nearly as hard as diamond; and superlensing, which have a resolution which, while finer than the diffraction limit, is still finite.

==Macroscale==

In 2015, researchers first obtained evidence for superlubricity at microscales. The experiments were supported by computational studies. The Mira supercomputer simulated up to 1.2 million atoms for dry environments and up to 10 million atoms for humid environments. The researchers used LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) code to carry out reactive molecular dynamics simulations. The researchers optimized LAMMPS and its implementation of ReaxFF by adding OpenMP threading, replacing MPI point-to-point communication with MPI collectives in key algorithms, and leveraging MPI I/O. These enhancements doubled performance. 

== Applications ==
Friction is known to be a major consumer of energy; for instance in a detailed study it was found that it may lead to one third of the energy losses in new automobile engines. Superlubricious coatings could reduce this. Potential applications include computer hard drives, wind turbine gears, and mechanical rotating seals for microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical systems.

<text>Pieter Boddaert (1730 – 6 May 1795) was a Dutch physician and naturalist.

==Early life, family and education==
Boddaert was the son of a Middelburg jurist and poet by the same name (1694–1760). The younger Pieter obtained his M.D. at the University of Utrecht in 1764.

==Career==
He became a lecturer on natural history at his alma mater, University of Utrecht. Fourteen letters survive of his correspondence with Carl Linnaeus between 1768 and 1775. He was a friend of Albert Schlosser, whose cabinet of &quot;curiosities&quot; of natural history he described.

In 1783 he published 50 copies of an identification key of Edmé-Louis Daubenton&#x27;s &quot;Planches enluminées&quot;, the colored plates of illustrations for the comte de Buffon&#x27;s monumental &quot;Histoire Naturelle&quot; (published 1749–1789), assigning binomial scientific names to the plates. As many of these were the first Linnaean scientific names to be proposed, they remain in use. In 2017 the world list of birds maintained by Frank Gill and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union included 190 taxa for which Boddaert is cited as the authority. Of these 112 are treated as species and 78 as subspecies. One species, the hoopoe starling, is now extinct.

In 1784 he published &quot;Elenchus Animalium&quot;, a &quot;directory of animals&quot; that included the first binomial names for a number of mammals, including the Quagga and the Tarpan.

==Honors and awards==
Boddaert is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of South American snake, &quot;Mastigodryas boddaerti&quot;.

<doc id="592524" wikidata="Q7777181" url="?curid=592524" title="The world wonders">
<text>&quot;The world wonders&quot; is a phrase which rose to notoriety following its use during World War II when it appeared as part of a decoded message sent by Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, to Admiral William Halsey Jr. at the height of the Battle of Leyte Gulf on October 25, 1944. The words, intended to be without meaning, were added as security padding in an encrypted message to hinder Japanese attempts at cryptanalysis, but were mistakenly included in the decoded text given to Halsey. Halsey interpreted the phrase as a harsh and sarcastic rebuke, and as a consequence dropped his futile pursuit of a decoy Japanese carrier task force, and, belatedly, reversed some of his ships in a fruitless effort to aid United States forces in the Battle off Samar.

==Encryption strategy==
During World War II, both basic and (for the time) sophisticated encryption ciphers were used. Some of these ciphers could be compromised through the recognition of predictable elements in the messages. For instance, messages might contain predictable intros or salutations such as &quot;Dear&quot; or &quot;Sincerely&quot;. Today, this kind of vulnerability is referred to as a known-plaintext attack. At Bletchley Park, the Allies&#x27; codebreakers referred to these predictable elements as &quot;cribs&quot;, British schoolboy slang for a hidden cheat-sheet smuggled into a test or exam. Cribs, based on educated guesses about parts of the plaintext (German messages, for instance, often ended with the words &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;), were an invaluable part of the Allies&#x27; own code-breaking strategies.

To combat pattern recognition in encrypted messages, methods such as adding unique, non-relevant padding phrases were employed. For example, the US Navy during World War II might transform a simple message like &quot;Halsey: Come home. - CINCPAC&quot; into &quot;Road less taken nn Halsey: Come home. - CINCPAC rr bacon and eggs&quot; for encrypted transmission. The padding, marked by two-character words, was added before encoding and removed after decoding.

World War II was a pivotal period in the evolution of modern cryptography. While the ciphers of that era were vulnerable to techniques like known-plaintext attacks, the field has since advanced significantly, and modern ciphers are designed to be resistant to such vulnerabilities.

==Background==

On October 20, 1944, United States troops invaded the island of Leyte as part of a strategy aimed at isolating Japan from the resource-rich territory it had occupied in South East Asia, and in particular depriving its forces and industry of vital oil supplies. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) mobilized nearly all of its remaining major naval vessels in an attempt to defeat the Allied invasion. In the ensuing Battle of Leyte Gulf the Japanese intended to use ships commanded by Vice-Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, &quot;Northern Force&quot;, to lure the main American covering forces away from Leyte, thus allowing the main IJN forces, &quot;Southern Force&quot; and &quot;Center Force&quot;, led by the 18-inch gunned super-battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;, the largest and most powerful ship afloat, to attack the invasion force in a pincer movement. Northern Force would be built around the four aircraft carriers of the 3rd Carrier Division (—the last survivor of the six carriers that had attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941—and the light carriers , , and ), but these would have very few aircraft or trained aircrew, serving merely as &quot;bait&quot;.

Halsey, in command of the mobile naval forces covering the invasion&#x27;s northern flank, fell for the ruse, and convinced that Northern Force constituted the main Japanese threat, proceeded northward in pursuit with the carriers of 3rd Fleet and a powerful force of battleships, designated Task Force 34. This left the landing beaches covered only by sixteen escort carriers with about 450 aircraft from the 7th Fleet. On the morning of the 25th a strong Japanese force of battleships slipped through the San Bernardino Strait headed toward the American landing forces, prompting their commander, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, to send a desperate plaintext message asking for support.

==Nimitz&#x27;s message==
When Nimitz, at CINCPAC headquarters in Hawaii, saw Kinkaid&#x27;s plea for help he sent a message to Halsey, simply asking for the current location of Task Force 34, which due to a previous misunderstanding, was unclear:

With the addition of metadata including routing and classification information, as well as the padding at the head and tail, the entire plaintext message to be encoded and transmitted to Halsey was:

U.S. Navy procedure called for the padding to be added to the start and end of the message, which were vulnerable to cryptanalysis due to the use of common phrases and words (such as &quot;Yours sincerely&quot;) in those sections. The words chosen for padding should have been obviously irrelevant to the actual message, however Nimitz&#x27;s enciphering clerk used a phrase that &quot;[just] popped into my head&quot;. Historians note similarity to Lord Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; about the eponymous battle, which was also fought on October 25 (of 1854), as the poem twice contains the phrase &quot;All the world wonder’d&quot;.
While decrypting and transcribing the message, Halsey&#x27;s radio officer properly removed the leading phrase, but the trailing phrase looked appropriate and he seems to have thought it was intended and so left it in before passing it on to Halsey, who read it as:

The structure tagging (the &#x27;RR&#x27;s) should have made clear that the phrase was in fact padding. In all the ships and stations that received the message, only the decoder on Halsey&#x27;s flagship, , failed to delete both padding phrases.

==Consequences==
The message (and its trailing padding) became infamous, and created some ill feeling, since it appeared to be a harsh criticism by Nimitz of Halsey&#x27;s decision to pursue the decoy carriers and leave the landings uncovered. &quot;I was stunned as if I had been struck in the face&quot;, Halsey later recalled. &quot;The paper rattled in my hands, I snatched off my cap, threw it on the deck, and shouted something I am ashamed to remember&quot;, letting out an anguished sob. RADM Robert Carney, Halsey&#x27;s chief of staff (who had argued strongly in favor of pursuing the carriers), witnessed Halsey&#x27;s emotional outburst and reportedly grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him, shouting, &quot;Stop it! What the hell&#x27;s the matter with you? Pull yourself together!&quot; Recognizing his failure, Halsey ordered his fleet south, however the chase north had exhausted the fuel of his light escorts and more time was wasted refueling while Taffy 3 (Task Unit 77.4.3, commanded by Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague) was fighting for its life. Halsey returned to Samar with his two fastest battleships, three light cruisers and eight destroyers, but he arrived too late to have any impact on the battle.

<text>USS &quot;Watseka&quot; (YTM-387) was a medium harbor tug of the &quot;YTM-192&quot; class in the service of the United States Navy during World War II. The Naval Historical Center lists the namesake as: &quot;Possibly a variant spelling of Watsaghika, a former village of the Iruwaitsu Shasta Indian tribe of northern California, at the extreme west end of Scott Valley.&quot;

&quot;Watseka&quot; was purchased in 1943 from Ira S. Bushey and Sons of Brooklyn, New York, and assigned to the 8th Naval District, New Orleans, Louisiana, as YT-387. On 15 May 1944, her designation was changed from YT-387 to YTB-387. While in reserve, she was redesignated YTM-387 in February 1962.

Placed in reserve, out of service, and berthed with the Columbia River, Oregon, group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet from March 1946, she was subsequently sold on 1 July 1972. As a civilian tug, she operated under the names &quot;Deborah W&quot;, &quot;Beaver&quot;, &quot;Seahorse&quot;, &quot;SB IX&quot;, &quot;Seahorse&quot;, and &quot;Glen Cove&quot;.

<text>In cryptography, FEAL (the Fast data Encipherment Algorithm) is a block cipher proposed as an alternative to the Data Encryption Standard (DES), and designed to be much faster in software. The Feistel based algorithm was first published in 1987 by Akihiro Shimizu and Shoji Miyaguchi from NTT. The cipher is susceptible to various forms of cryptanalysis, and has acted as a catalyst in the discovery of differential and linear cryptanalysis.

There have been several different revisions of FEAL, though all are Feistel ciphers, and make use of the same basic round function and operate on a 64-bit block. One of the earliest designs is now termed FEAL-4, which has four rounds and a 64-bit key. 
Problems were found with FEAL-4 from the start: Bert den Boer related a weakness in an unpublished rump session at the same conference where the cipher was first presented. A later paper (den Boer, 1988) describes an attack requiring 100–10000 chosen plaintexts, and Sean Murphy (1990) found an improvement that needs only 20 chosen plaintexts. Murphy and den Boer&#x27;s methods contain elements similar to those used in differential cryptanalysis.

The designers countered by doubling the number of rounds, FEAL-8 (Shimizu and Miyaguchi, 1988). However, eight rounds also proved to be insufficient — in 1989, at the Securicom conference, Eli Biham and Adi Shamir described a differential attack on the cipher, mentioned in (Miyaguchi, 1989). Gilbert and Chassé (1990) subsequently published a statistical attack similar to differential cryptanalysis which requires 10000 pairs of chosen plaintexts.

In response, the designers introduced a variable-round cipher, FEAL-N (Miyaguchi, 1990), where &quot;N&quot; was chosen by the user, together with FEAL-NX, which had a larger 128-bit key. Biham and Shamir&#x27;s differential cryptanalysis (1991) showed that both FEAL-N and FEAL-NX could be broken faster than exhaustive search for N ≤ 31. Later attacks, precursors to linear cryptanalysis, could break versions under the known plaintext assumption, first (Tardy-Corfdir and Gilbert, 1991) and then (Matsui and Yamagishi, 1992), the latter breaking FEAL-4 with 5 known plaintexts, FEAL-6 with 100, and FEAL-8 with 215.

In 1994, Ohta and Aoki presented a linear cryptanalytic attack against FEAL-8 that required 212 known plaintexts.

<doc id="592534" wikidata="Q3135518" url="?curid=592534" title="Hikōtei Jidai">
<text>is a manga by Hayao Miyazaki. A fifteen-page, all-watercolor work, it was published in &quot;Model Graphix&quot;, a monthly magazine about scale models, in three parts as a part of &quot;Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s Daydream Data Notes&quot; series. Like other manga in this series, &quot;Hikōtei Jidai&quot; is a manifestation of his love for old planes. It is filled with aircraft from the 1920s (heavily modified by Miyazaki) and their technical details, as well as with the men (good-hearted and silly) who love them. The manga received a film adaptation titled &quot;Porco Rosso&quot; in 1992.

&quot;Hikōtei Jidai&quot; was published as a book in 1992 by Dainippon Kaiga. It has about sixty pages and includes the manga, several airplane vignettes, resin-kit models of aircraft, photos of some real counterparts of the floatplanes which appeared in the film, and some interviews with Miyazaki regarding airplane model kits.

==Differences from &quot;Porco Rosso&quot;==
Compared with the anime version, the manga is much more light-hearted. Other than being a &quot;retired Italian Air Force pilot&quot;, Porco&#x27;s past is not discussed, although the rise of fascism and the sentiment against it are mentioned. Gina doesn&#x27;t appear at all, and Porco is much more lighthearted. Still, the basic story line and its charm are carried over into the anime.

For the dogfight between Porco and Donald Chuck (the character was renamed Donald Curtiss in the anime), Miyazaki wrote: &quot;If this were animation, I might be able to convey the grandeur of this life-or-death battle. But this is a comic. I have no choice but to rely on the imagination of you, good readers.&quot; (At the time, the &quot;Porco Rosso&quot; anime had not yet been announced.)

Mamma Aiuto, who Porco saves in Part One, is also the name of a seaplane pirate gang in the movie. It is also Italian for &quot;Help, mom!&quot;

==The story==
It&#x27;s the 1920s over the Adriatic Sea. Air pirates with their seaplanes plague the sea, attacking ships, robbing money, and kidnapping women. Enter an Italian bounty hunter, Porco Rosso. Flying his red seaplane, he is the best in the business. He is a very dashing fellow and women love him. There is, however, one peculiarity about himhe is a pig.

;Part One
Porco Rosso saves a girl from the air pirates, the Mamma Aiuto gang.

;Part Two
Porco is shot down by an American, Donald Chuck. Porco takes his plane to Milan-based Piccolo, SPA, for repairs. Fio, a 17-year-old girl, redesigns and improves his plane.

;Part Three
Porco and Chuck have a great air battle for Fio and for Italian pride.

==Legacy==
&quot;Hikōtei Jidai&quot; was the basis for Miyazaki&#x27;s 1993 anime film &quot;Porco Rosso&quot;. In addition, the Disney television series &quot;TaleSpin&quot; also took inspiration from &quot;Hikōtei Jidai&quot;.

<text>René Primevère Lesson (20 March 1794 – 28 April 1849) was a French surgeon, naturalist, ornithologist, and herpetologist.

== Biography ==
Lesson was born at Rochefort, and entered the Naval Medical School in Rochefort at the age of sixteen. He served in the French Navy during the Napoleonic Wars; in 1811, he was third surgeon on the frigate &quot;Saale&quot;, and in 1813, was second surgeon on the &quot;Regulus&quot;.

In 1816, Lesson changed his classification to pharmacist. He served on Duperrey&#x27;s round-the-world voyage of &quot;La Coquille&quot; (1822–1825), of which he collected natural history specimens with his fellow surgeon Prosper Garnot and officer Dumont d&#x27;Urville. During his visits to the Moluccas and New Guinea, Lesson became the first naturalist to see birds of paradise in the wild.

On returning to Paris, he spent seven years preparing the section on vertebrates for the official account of the expedition: &quot;&quot;Voyage autour du monde entrepris par ordre du Gouvernement sur la corvette La Coquille&quot; (published from 1826 to 1839). During this time period, he also produced &quot;Manuel d&#x27;Ornithologie&quot; (1828), &quot;Traité d&#x27;Ornithologie&quot; (1831), &quot;Centurie Zoologique&quot; (1830–1832) and &quot;Illustrations de Zoologie&quot; (1832–35). Lesson also published several monographs on hummingbirds and one book on birds of paradise:
* &quot;Histoire naturelle des oiseaux-mouches. ouvrage orné de planches&quot;... (1829–1831).
* &quot;Histoire naturelle des Colibris suivie d&#x27;un supplement a l&#x27;histoire naturelle des oiseaux-mouches&quot; (1831–32).
* &quot;Les trochilidées ou les colibris et les oiseaux-mouches&quot; (1832).
* &quot;Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de paradis et des épimaques; ouvrage orné de planches, dessinées et gravées par les meilleurs artistes&quot; (1835).

In the field of herpetology he described many new species of amphibians and reptiles.

On 3 February 1827, he married the artist and scientific illustrator Clémence Dumont de Sainte-Croix. Dumont de Sainte-Croix along with her sister Zoë Dumont de Sainte-Croix illustrated plates in Lesson&#x27;s publications.

From 1831, he served as a professor of pharmacy, and following a series of promotions, became the top-ranking naval pharmacist at Rochefort (1835). His experience as a ship&#x27;s surgeon resulted in his two-volume &quot;Manuel d&#x27;histoire naturelle medicale, et de pharmacographie&quot;&quot; (1833), intended as a handbook for naval surgeons.

He became a corresponding member of the &quot;Académie de Médecine&quot; in 1828, later becoming a correspondent of the &quot;Académie des Sciences&quot; (1833). He received the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; in 1847.

In 1847, Lesson presented a division of human races based on simple color terms: White for Caucasians, Dusky for South Asians, Orange for Austronesians, Yellow for East Asians, Red for Indigenous Americans, and Black for Africans. This model achieved moderate use among ethnologists.

René Primevère Lesson is sometimes confused with his brother, Pierre Adolphe Lesson (1805–1888), who participated on the &quot;Astrolabe&quot; expedition (as the &quot;Coquille&quot; had been renamed) in 1826–29, under the command of Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville.

==Lesson and the idea that counting in New Zealand proceeded by elevens==

On his return from his voyage on the &quot;Coquille&quot; in 1825, Lesson published a French translation of &quot;Du Grand Océan, de ses îles et de ses côtes&quot; written by the German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso. In the article, von Chamisso had claimed that the number system of New Zealand was based on twenty: &quot;…de l&#x27;E. de la mer du Sud … c&#x27;est là qu&#x27;on trouve premierement le système arithmétique fondé sur un échelle de vingt, comme dans la Nouvelle-Zélande (2)...&quot; […east of the South Sea … is where we first find the arithmetic system based on a scale of twenty, as in New Zealand (2)...]. Lesson inserted the footnote (2) to mark this claim as an error: &quot;(2) Erreur. Le système arithmétique des Zélandais est undécimal, et les Anglais sont les premiers qui ont propagé cette fausse idée. (L.)&quot; [(2) Error. The Zealander arithmetic system is undecimal, and the English are the first to propagate this misconception. (L).]&quot; The term &quot;undécimal&quot; was possibly a printer&#x27;s error that conjoined the phrase &quot;un decimal,&quot; which would have correctly identified the New Zealand number system as decimal. Undecimal was interpreted to mean &quot;counting by elevens,&quot; as a parallel construction to the term &quot;duodecimal&quot; for twelve-based counting. The mention of &quot;the English&quot; likely referred to Samuel Lee and Thomas Kendall, as their 1820 grammar of the New Zealand language had been von Chamisso&#x27;s source.

Regardless of whether his 1825 use of &quot;undécimal&quot; originated as a printer&#x27;s error or not, over the next several years, Lesson and his friend and shipmate Jules de Blosseville would deliberately embellish and attempt to establish as fact the idea that New Zealand had a base 11 number system. The idea was published in 1826 by the Italian geographer Adriano Balbi as the contents of a letter he received from Lesson, a missive that added an elevens-based numerical vocabulary (including terms meaning eleven squared and cubed) and details of its purported collection from New Zealand informants. It was again mentioned in 1826 by the Hungarian astronomer Franz Xaver von Zach, who reported it thirdhand as a letter written by Blosseville: &quot;M. Nell de Bréanté écrit que, d&#x27;après les communications qu&#x27;il a reçues de M. de Blosseville, ... [en Nouvelle-Zélande], on a trouvé en usage un système de numération &quot;undécimal&quot;&quot; [Mr. Nell de Bréauté writes that, according to the communications he has received from M. de Blosseville, ... [in New Zealand], a system of &quot;undecimal&quot; numbering was found in use]. Lesson was also likely to have authored an undated, anonymous essay found among and published with the papers of the Prussian linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt in 1839. The essay contains the most extensive detail of the known sources, mentioning Thomas Kendall by name and listing several North Island locations where the alleged informants were supposedly from, matters that would have been known to Lesson from his work and 1824 visit to that island.

==Honours==
Lessonia is a genus of large kelp native to the southern Pacific Ocean and named in René Lesson&#x27;s honour, in 1825. Then &quot;Lessoniopsis&quot; (a brown algae) in 1903 was also named.

<text>William Hooker (born June 18, 1946) is an American drummer and composer.

==Early life and education==
Hooker was born in New Britain, Connecticut, on June 18, 1946. He began to play the drums at the age of 12. In high school, he played in a rock band, then switched to jazz. After graduating from Central Connecticut College, Hooker moved to California and became interested in free jazz.

==Career==
Hooker moved to New York City in the mid-1970s and was part of the loft jazz scene, playing with musicians such as saxophonists David Murray and David S. Ware. His first recording as a leader was in 1976. His music was too radical to be commercially successful, and Hooker took other jobs to earn a living. This changed after he received praise for a 1988 recording, and he made frequent appearances at the Knitting Factory from early the following decade. Hooker was a founding member of the Text of Light, a musician&#x27;s collective that released seven albums between 2004 and 2010.

Hooker has led several bands, including a drums–trumpet–saxophone trio and an organ trio. They usually do not feature a bass, &quot;because of the intensity and volume of his drumming&quot;. He has also been the drummer in duos with guitarists, including Elliott Sharp and Thurston Moore. Hooker&#x27;s playing and recordings have embraced a wide range and combination of musics, including free jazz, noise rock, electronics, contemporary classical, and experimental electronic.
The &quot;Down Beat&quot; reviewer of Hooker&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Of Flowers&quot; album wrote &quot;Hooker uses history to enliven a suite of music that bounds through subgenres and percussive ideas&quot;.

&quot;He is an elemental drummer of considerable force, equally at home in free-form jazz and avant-garde rock circles; he also experiments with electronics and turntables&quot;.

<doc id="592554" wikidata="Q324505" url="?curid=592554" title="Alphonso Jackson">
<text>Alphonso R. Jackson (born September 9, 1945) served as the 13th United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). He was nominated by President George W. Bush on August 28, 2004, and confirmed by the Senate on August 31, 2004. Jackson announced his resignation on March 31, 2008.

==Early life and career==
Jackson was born on September 9, 1945, in Marshall, Texas, and grew up in South Dallas as the youngest of 12 children in the family. His mother was a midwife, while his father sometimes worked as many as three jobs—as a foundry worker, janitor, and landscaper—to make ends meet.

===Education===
Jackson attended Truman State University, where he studied political science. He went on to earn a master&#x27;s degree in education administration from the school in 1969. But instead of taking a teaching job, Jackson enrolled in the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.

In March 1965, Jackson, then a college freshman, participated in the first of the civil rights Selma to Montgomery marches, which became known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;.

===Early career===
Jackson began his professional career in St. Louis as an assistant professor at the University of Missouri – St. Louis. In 1977, he was named the city&#x27;s director of public safety. He became executive director of the St. Louis Housing Authority four years later, a job he held until 1983. He left it to work as a consultant to a St. Louis accounting firm and intensified his political activities. Active in both Democratic and Republican circles in the city for many years, he even ran for a spot as St. Louis&#x27;s municipal revenue collector. He also worked for the U.S. Senate campaign of Jack Danforth, a Republican. His rising profile earned him the attention of officials in Washington, and in 1987, he was made the director of the U.S. Department of Public and Assisted Housing for Washington, D.C.

===Dallas Housing Authority===
In 1989, Jackson was tapped to take over the Housing Authority of the City of Dallas as its president and chief executive officer. He was the first African American to lead the formerly troubled agency, which had become the target of discrimination lawsuits. In his seven years on the job, Jackson was credited with fixing the problems within the Dallas Housing Authority (DHA) and improving conditions for the city&#x27;s poorest residents, who turned to it for help in a time of need. He worked to improve the run-down buildings and unsafe conditions that had become standard in the city&#x27;s aging public-housing units and also arranged deals that improved neighborhood conditions. He managed to find funds for a commercial development project, for example, that brought the first supermarket back to a struggling West Dallas neighborhood in several years.

Jackson&#x27;s seven-year stint in Dallas was not without its challenges. In 1995 the DHA began implementing a U.S. District Court order that came about after a mid-1980s challenge to desegregate the city&#x27;s public-housing units. The court order called for 3,200 low-income families to be placed in neighborhoods that were predominantly white, and the agency drew up a plan for new units to be built in a section of North Dallas that was predominantly white. The townhouses or duplexes would house just 75 families, but some 2,000 local homeowners organized to fight it.

===Private sector===
In the end, Jackson left the public sector when Central Southwest Power, now American Electric Power offered him the vice president of corporate resources for CSW Energy and International in Dallas, Texas in 1996. In 1998, he became president and COO of American Electric Power-Texas, an Austin-based subsidiary of American Electric Power, a $13 billion utility company. Jackson was responsible for the company&#x27;s operations in South and West Texas.

===Return to public sector===
With a new Republican administration in the White House, Jackson was a likely contender for a federal appointment, especially since he had known George W. Bush, the former Texas governor, since 1989, when both lived in the same Dallas neighborhood. In early 2001, Jackson&#x27;s name was approved by Congress to serve as the deputy secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), a post that essentially made him second-in-command and chief operating officer of the cabinet department, working under HUD Secretary Mel Martínez.

Jackson succeeded Martínez as Secretary in August 2004, and served until resigning in March 2008. 

After Jackson&#x27;s public service in Washington, DC, as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, he was the distinguished university professor and director of the Center for Public Policy and Leadership at Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia, from 2008 to 2012. Hampton University&#x27;s Center for Public Policy focuses on making its university research relevant to real-world problems. No other Historically Black University houses such a center.

===Current career===
In 2012, Jackson became vice-chairman of consumer &amp; community banking with JPMorgan Chase in New York City.

==Affiliations==
An expert on public housing and urban issues, Jackson has been asked to serve on a number of national and state commissions, most notably the General Services Commission of the State of Texas, where he served as chairman; the National Commission on America&#x27;s Urban Families, and the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing. He has served on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, The Nature Conservancy of Texas, Vice Chairman of United Way Campaign(Dallas, Texas), Zale-Lipshy University Hospital, The Cotton Bowl Football Classic, Central Power &amp; Light Company, West Texas Utilities and JPMorgan Chase (formerly Texas Commerce Bank).

Jackson currently serves on the United States Department of State Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board, Howard University&#x27;s Board of Trustees and the Ford&#x27;s Theatre Society Board of Trustees.
Also, he is a member and serves on the board of directors, The Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, Incorporated, and is a member of the United States Institute of Peace International Advisory Council.

==Awards and honors==
The Aspen Institute – Aspen Fellow; The National Boys and Girls Clubs of America – Chairman&#x27;s Award; The National Academy of Achievement – Golden Plate Award; American Family Life Assurance Company (AFLAC) – Lifetime Achievement Award; The Jewish National Fund, New York – National Tree of Life Award; Truman State University – Distinguished Alumni Award; Washington University in St. Louis – Distinguished Alumni Award.

In December 2017, Jackson was chosen to receive the Horatio Alger Award for 2018. The Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans recognizes people who have overcome personal challenges to achieve personal and professional success.

== Honorary degrees ==
Benedict College, Hampton University, Harris-Stowe State University; Hiram College; Morehouse College; North Carolina A&amp;T State University; Paine College; Tuskegee University; Texas College; Texas Southern University

== Secretary of Housing and Urban Development ==

Jackson first joined the Bush administration in June 2001 as the deputy secretary and chief operating officer of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. As deputy secretary, Jackson managed the day-to-day operations of HUD, which had an annual budget of over $30 billion. After HUD Secretary Mel Martínez left the administration to campaign for the November 2004 election for a U.S. Senate seat in Florida, Jackson became acting secretary of HUD. He was nominated by President George W. Bush on August 28, 2004, to take that position on a permanent basis, and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on August 31, 2004. Jackson was the fourth African American to hold that post. On March 31, 2008, Jackson announced his resignation, effective April 18 of that year.

=== HUD Removal from High Risk List ===
For the first time in 13 years, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) removed HUD from the government&#x27;s &quot; high-risk&quot; list. GAO&#x27;s report recognized HUD&#x27;s progress under Secretary Jackson&#x27;s leadership in implementing management controls that led to significant improvements to HUD departments and programs.

Jackson stated, &quot; HUD serves the nation best when all its programs are working effectively and efficiently. GAO&#x27;s removal of a high risk designation shines a bright light on our efforts over the past six years to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and well.&quot;

=== Reduction in homelessness ===

During Jackson&#x27;s tenure at HUD, HUD announced an 11.5% reduction in the number of persons reported as chronically homeless by Continuums of Care (CoCs) during a one-day count. Over 1,500 cities and counties reported a combined decrease of over 20,000 fewer chronically homeless persons between 2005 and 2006.

One important tool in this effort was HUD&#x27;s first-ever Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. This groundbreaking survey of homelessness found that 704,000 people nationwide sought shelter at least once in a three-month period. Through the data collection for the report, and the subsequent analysis of that data, HUD learned a great deal about the demographics of homelessness. Prior to the report, according to Jackson, HUD had a hard time figuring out if national or local programs were working and a tough time just trying to figure out where the homeless might be on a given night.

===Increase in minority contracting===

Jackson increased minority, women, and small business contracting substantially during his tenure. In 2003, the year before Jackson was named secretary, 14 percent—or $134 million—of the Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s contracts went to black-owned firms, officials say. By 2007, black-owned businesses were receiving 25 percent of the department&#x27;s contracts, or $195.6 million. Jackson promoted such statistics, saying that &quot;a good bottom line with small and minority businesses helps to build a stronger America.&quot;

This accomplishment led to a federal investigation and caused some to think Jackson was wrongly targeted because of his efforts. Indeed, some of his supporters deride the scrutiny of his casual friendships as a racist effort to undermine a prominent black official and several respected black businessmen, noting that no one has been charged with a crime.

Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, said he believed the investigation was fueled by officials determined to derail Jackson&#x27;s efforts to expand affirmative action. &quot;Is there something wrong with trying to make sure African-Americans participate in the contracting program with the American government?&quot; asked Mr. Clyburn.

On April 30, 2010, the Justice Department announced it would not be pursuing charges against Jackson. Jackson&#x27;s lawyers noted that a lawyer at the Justice Department&#x27;s public integrity unit told them that it was closing its investigation. One lawyer for Jackson stated that the Justice Department had been unable to find evidence that Jackson received any benefit in exchange for his office&#x27;s recommendations and that &quot;when that quid pro quo is missing, it takes away any motivation for improper steering.&quot;

===Local housing authorities===

====Philadelphia====

In March 2008, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported on a series of emails in early 2007 between HUD assistant secretaries Kim Kendrick and Orlando J. Cabrera that suggested that HUD leadership sought to punish Carl R. Greene, the director of the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA). On the date these e-mails were sent, HUD notified the housing authority that it had been found in violation of rules requiring that 5 percent of housing be accessible to disabled residents. The department later argued that because the authority refused to acknowledge it was in violation and to agree to a specific remedy, it was in violation of a broader agreement that put $50 million in federal funding in jeopardy. Greene, who later was forced to resign from the Philadelphia Housing Authority due to numerous accusations of wrongdoings, asserted that the HUD actions were in retaliation against PHA because Greene had refused to turn over property to Universal Community Homes, a development company founded by Kenny Gamble; Greene said that Universal had not performed as promised. Gamble complained to Jackson about the situation in 2006.

A federal judge later ruled for HUD that Jackson did not treat Philadelphia differently than other local housing agencies. On October 16, 2008, the Philadelphia Housing Authority signed a ten-year agreement with HUD. PHA said that over the next four years, it would make sure 760 units of housing were upgraded to be fully accessible for people with disabilities.

====Government contracts====
On April 28, 2006, Jackson spoke at a meeting in Dallas and addressed the subject of government contracting. He recounted that a prospective HUD contractor had made a &quot;heck of a proposal&quot; and was selected upon the basis of that proposal, but upon thanking Jackson for being selected the bidder, mentioned that he did not like President Bush. As a result, Jackson said, the bidder who had criticized Bush did not receive the contract: &quot;Brother, you have a disconnect—the President is elected, I was selected. You wouldn&#x27;t be getting the contract unless I was sitting here. If you have a problem with the President, don&#x27;t tell the secretary.&quot; Jackson told the crowd, &quot;He didn&#x27;t get the contract. Why should I reward someone who doesn&#x27;t like the president, so they can use funds to try to campaign against the President? Logic says they don&#x27;t get the contract. That&#x27;s the way I believe.&quot;

After Jackson&#x27;s comment, Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) called for an investigation and Jackson to resign. The investigation found &quot;no evidence that a contract was canceled, rescinded, terminated or not issued.&quot;

===Countrywide Financial loan===
In June 2008, Conde Nast Portfolio reported that Jackson, along with several other politicians and government officials, including former Cabinet Secretarys, Donna Shalala and Henry Cisneros, Senators Chris Dodd and Kent Conrad, United Nations Ambassador Richard Holbrooke had all received below-rate loans from Countrywide Financial as part of the company&#x27;s &quot;V.I.P.&quot; program. One loan was issued to refinance Jackson&#x27;s townhouse in Virginia, while another was for the purchase of a vacation home on a South Carolina golf course. Jackson denied knowledge of any discounts on the loans.

According to the financial writer, David Fiderer, the source for the &quot;Portfolio&quot; magazine article, a former Countrywide employee, offered no written backup and made up some facts to bolster the story. Portfolio, desperate to uncover a &quot;scandal&quot;, took his word for it. In fact, there was written documentation disproving the assertions. But since the employee did not reveal that information, Portfolio was able to maintain plausible deniability. Nothing in the paperwork suggested that anyone was paying a below-market interest rate on his loan. &quot;The Countrywide Lineup.&quot;
The US Senate Select Committee on Ethics found in 2009 that there was &quot;evidence on the record that the discounts offered to V.I.P.s and F.O.A.s were not the best deals that were available at Countrywide or in the marketplace at large.&quot; The committee further noted, &quot;participation in the V.I.P. or F.O.A. programs did not necessarily mean that borrowers received the best financial deal available either from Countrywide or other lenders.&quot; The report concluded, however, that the V.I.P. program did seem to have an appearance that the program offered discounts to participants.

<text>Windows Installer XML Toolset (WiX, pronounced &quot;wicks&quot;) is a free software toolset that builds Windows Installer packages from XML. It consists of a command-line environment that developers may integrate into their build processes to build MSI and MSM packages. WiX was the first Microsoft project to be released under an open-source license, the Common Public License. It was also the first Microsoft project to be hosted on an external website.

After its release in 2004, Microsoft has used WiX to package Office 2007, SQL Server 2005, Visual Studio 2005/2008, and other products.

WiX includes Votive, a Visual Studio add-in that allows creating and building WiX setup projects using the Visual Studio IDE. Votive supports syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for source files and adds a WiX setup project type to Visual Studio.

==History==
WiX was the first Microsoft project to be released under an open-source license, the Common Public License. Initially hosted on SourceForge, it was also the first Microsoft project to be hosted externally.

On June 6, 2010, WiX moved from SourceForge to CodePlex. On August 14, 2012, Microsoft transferred the WiX copyright to the Microsoft-sponsored Outercurve Foundation. At the same time, the license was changed from the Common Public License to the Microsoft Reciprocal License. On May 4, 2016, WiX was transferred to the .NET Foundation.

Since Visual Studio 2012, the traditional setup project type has been removed from Visual Studio (available only as an extension since Visual Studio 2013). WiX is a recommended alternative.

==Functions==
WiX is a toolset designed to build Windows Installer (.msi) packages using the command line. It comes with the following tools:

* Candle: compiles source files into object files
* Light: combines object files into a .msi file
* Lit: creates libraries that can be linked by Light.exe
* Dark: decompiles a .msi file into WiX code
* Heat: creates a WiX source file
* Pyro: creates Patch files (.msp) without needing the Windows Installer SDK
* Burn: coordinates dependency installer
