<text>Alice Louise Waters (born April 28, 1944) is an American chef, restaurateur, food writer, and author. In 1971, she opened Chez Panisse, a restaurant in Berkeley, California, famous for its role in creating the farm-to-table movement and for pioneering California cuisine.

Waters has authored the books &quot;Chez Panisse Cooking&quot; (with Paul Bertolli), &quot;The Art of Simple Food I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;, and &quot;40 Years of Chez Panisse&quot;. Her memoir, &quot;Coming to my Senses: The Making of a Counterculture Cook&quot;, was published in September 2017 and released in paperback in May 2018.

Waters created the Chez Panisse Foundation in 1996 and the Edible Schoolyard program at the Martin Luther King Middle School in Berkeley. She is a national public policy advocate for universal access to healthy, organic foods. Her influence in the fields of organic foods and nutrition inspired Michelle Obama&#x27;s White House organic vegetable garden program.

== Background ==
Waters was born in Chatham Borough, New Jersey, on April 28, 1944, to Charles Allen Waters, a Rutgers University graduate who was a management consultant and Margaret Waters, a homemaker. Waters graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, receiving a degree in French cultural studies in 1967. While at Berkeley, she studied abroad in France, where she says she &quot;lived at the bottom of a market street&quot; and &quot;took everything in by osmosis&quot;.

She brought this style of food preparation back to Berkeley, where she opened her first Provence-style restaurant with a friend. She claims that food is a way of life and not just something to eat.

== Political involvement ==
During her time at Berkeley, Waters became active in the Free Speech Movement, which was sweeping across the campus.

Waters worked on the congressional campaign of Robert Scheer, an anti-Vietnam War politician. She often cooked for and entertained her fellow campaigners.

== Additional influences ==
Waters eventually returned to Europe, where she first trained at a Montessori school in London. Principles of the Montessori method, which emphasize practical and hands-on activities for children, are evident in Waters&#x27;s idea of &quot;edible education&quot; and her Edible Schoolyard, which engages children in the preparation of fruits and vegetables that they tend to with the supervision of their teachers.

After training in London, Waters next traveled to Turkey, which she credits with influencing her approach to hospitality and deepening her respect for local communities. In his book &quot;Alice Waters and Chez Panisse&quot;, Thomas McNamee recounts Waters&#x27;s experience in Turkey, where a young Turkish boy shared tea and a small bit of cheese with Waters and her traveling companions, even though he had very little. This small act of kindness had an effect on Waters&#x27;s approach to hospitality and generosity in her own restaurant.

From Turkey, Waters then returned to France, where she embarked upon a year-long journey. Her travels solidified her love of all things food and French and inspired her to return to California and open Chez Panisse.

Waters counts Elizabeth David, the English cookbook author and writer, as one of her influences. She also credits Richard Olney, an American authority on French food who spent much of his life living in France, with influencing her simple, rustic cuisine.

Olney introduced Waters to Lucien and Lulu Peyraud, owners of the Domaine Tempier vineyard in Provence. Lulu Peyraud&#x27;s vineyard cooking significantly influenced Waters&#x27;s cooking and her menus at Chez Panisse. In her foreword to Olney&#x27;s book, &quot;Lulu&#x27;s Provençal Table&quot;, Waters wrote: &quot;Lucien and Lulu&#x27;s warmhearted enthusiasm for life, their love for the pleasures of the table, their deep connection to the beautiful earth of the South of France – these were things I had seen at the movies. But this was for real. I felt immediately as if I had come home to second family.&quot;

In addition, Waters has said that she learned Chinese cooking from Cecilia Chiang, and the two became lifelong friends. Waters has said that what Chiang did to popularize Chinese cuisine in America is what Julia Child did for French cuisine.

The Shree Thaker Bhojanalay is where Waters is reported to have eaten a jowar bhakri for the first time.

== Chez Panisse ==

=== Background ===
In 1971, Waters opened Chez Panisse, which she named for a favorite character in a trilogy of Marcel Pagnol films. From the beginning, the restaurant was a collaborative effort. One notable collaboration was with Jeremiah Tower, who helped create some of the recipes that she later published under her name. Tower took the organic ingredients and melded them into a more refined menu. Chez Panisse was intended to serve primarily as a place where Waters could entertain her friends. Realizing the difficulty in sourcing fresh, high-quality ingredients, Waters began building a network of local farmers, artisans, and producers, and continues to source the restaurant&#x27;s ingredients through her local network. Waters opened the upstairs Chez Panisse Café, a concept championed by Tower, in 1980. Café serves an a la carte menu for lunch and dinner. In 1984, Waters opened Café Fanny, named after her daughter, between the wine shop of Kermit Lynch and Acme Bread. Café Fanny, which served breakfast and lunch in a casual, European-café setting, closed in 2012.
Then Waters mainly focused on the importance of organic farmers. Through Chez Panisse foundation, the project called Edible Schoolyard was organized in order to make an environment for the students to learn how to grow their own food and prepare it.

=== Dedication to organic food ===
Central to the operations and philosophy of Chez Panisse is Waters&#x27;s and the restaurant&#x27;s dedication to using organic ingredients. Waters has become a crusader for organic foods, believing that they are both better for the environment and for people&#x27;s health in addition to tasting superior to commercially grown, non-organic foods.

Waters became an organic devotee almost by accident, claiming that what she was originally after was taste. She says: &quot;When I opened up Chez Panisse, I was only thinking about taste. And in doing that, I ended up at the doorstep of [organic farmers].&quot;

Waters&#x27;s current organic food agenda includes reforming the USDA school lunch program to include organic, local fruits and vegetables and changing the way America eats, but her passion for organics started at her restaurant, where she discovered that organic ingredients were the essential element necessary to create delicious food.

== Activism and public policy influence ==
Waters&#x27;s effort to promote fresh, sustainable food grown by local farms has extended into her work as a food activist and humanitarian. Waters has always been an outspoken supporter of the restaurant&#x27;s approach to food, cooking, and supporting the local community, but has more recently formalized her efforts through the Chez Panisse Foundation.

In celebration of the restaurant&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 1996, Waters founded the Chez Panisse Foundation, whose mission is to transform public education by using food to teach, nurture, and empower young people. In particular, the foundation has worked with the Berkeley Unified School District to develop a public school curriculum that is integrated with the school dining services and incorporates growing, cooking, and sharing food at the table into the school day in order to build a humane and sustainable future for the school&#x27;s students.

The Chez Panisse Foundation is a publicly supported 501(c)(3) organization.

== Edible Schoolyard and Edible Education ==
The primary work of the Chez Panisse Foundation has been to establish and sustain the Edible Schoolyard program at Berkeley&#x27;s Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School. The Edible Schoolyard was established in 1995 and is a organic garden and kitchen classroom. Students at the middle school are involved in growing, harvesting, and preparing the foods from the garden, with the aim of promoting the environmental and social well-being of the school community.

Waters&#x27;s work at the Edible Schoolyard has also developed into her School Lunch Initiative, which has the broader goal of bringing school children into a new relationship with food by making a healthy, fresh, sustainable meal a part of the school day. The School Lunch Initiative is a collaborative project with the Center for Ecoliteracy, also in Berkeley, and is also the topic of a series of studies through the Center for Weight and Health, at UC Berkeley.

The School Lunch Initiative is focused on bringing wholesome school lunch to the 10,000 students in the Berkeley Unified School District. In 2005, the Chez Panisse Foundation provided a grant to Berkeley schools to hire Ann Cooper as the director of Nutrition Services for the district. Cooper and the foundation eliminated almost all processed foods from the district and introduced organic fruits and vegetables to the daily menu, all while staying within the district&#x27;s budget. Waters&#x27;s vision is to teach subjects such as history, science, and art through the vehicle of food.

In September 2010, the Center for Weight and Health at UC Berkeley, Center for Ecoliteracy, and Chez Panisse Foundation released an evaluation report on the School Lunch Initiative. The report tracked elementary and middle school students over three years to determine the effects of the School Lunch Initiative on children&#x27;s eating habits and knowledge. The report found that students in schools with highly developed School Lunch Initiative components ate more daily servings of fruit and vegetables than students in schools with lesser developed programs, and that they scored higher on food knowledge assessments. Schools with highly developed School Lunch Initiative components integrated kitchen and garden classes into the school curriculum, in addition to overhauling the school lunch program.

Although the work of the Chez Panisse Foundation has focused primarily on the Berkeley Unified School District, Waters has become a vocal and familiar advocate for school lunch reform and activism at the national level, as well. She encouraged President Bill Clinton to plant a White House garden. In 2009, she appeared on the CBS television program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, and made a public call for President Obama to plant an organic garden at the White House to catalyze change in the US food system. Michelle Obama, in conjunction with her anti-obesity campaign Let&#x27;s Move!, planted the White House organic vegetable garden that year. An article in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; states that:

=== Edible Schoolyard affiliate programs ===
In addition to the Edible Schoolyard in Berkeley, there are five affiliate Edible Schoolyard programs around the country. These include Edible Schoolyards in New Orleans, New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Greensboro, North Carolina.

=== Other advocacy projects ===
, Waters is working to extend free school meals to all public school children in the United States. She hopes to expand programs like the Edible Schoolyard and the School Lunch Initiative in order to reach schools across the US. She supported the 2010 Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act, and believes that providing all public school students with free food in school would build the foundation for a healthier and more sustainable food culture in the US.

In 2003, Waters helped create the Yale Sustainable Food Project, which aims to make sustainable food an important part of university-level education. The project maintains an on-campus organic farm and integrates organic, local products into the university&#x27;s dining program 

In 2006, Waters oversaw the creation of the Rome Sustainable Food Project at the American Academy in Rome, which aims to provide a replicable model of simple, sustainable and seasonal food for other like-minded institutions, and which operates an internship program.

== Slow Food ==
Since 2002, Waters has served as a vice president of Slow Food International, an organization dedicated to preserving local food traditions, protecting biodiversity, promoting small-scale quality products around the world. She was drawn to the Slow Food movement because of its work in passing food knowledge and traditions to future generations.

<text>New Civil Engineer is the monthly magazine for members of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE), the UK chartered body that oversees the practice of civil engineering in the UK. First published in May 1972, it is today published by Metropolis. Under its previous publisher, Ascential, who, as Emap, acquired the title and editorial control from the ICE in 1995, the ICE regularly discussed the magazine&#x27;s content through an editorial advisory board and a supervisory board.

Available in print and online after the appropriate subscription has been taken out (it is free for members of the ICE), the magazine is aimed at professionals in the civil engineering industry. It contains industry news and analysis, letters from subscribers, a directory of companies, with listings arranged by companies’ areas of work, and an appointments section. It also occasionally has details of university courses and graduate positions.

In 2013 it had a net circulation of more than 50,000 per issue. Two years later, this had dropped to 42,805, of which some 39,000 related to copies distributed to ICE members. Previously printed on a weekly basis the magazine switched to a monthly format in December 2015.
&quot;New Civil Engineer&quot; was a co-founder of the British Construction Industry Awards.

In January 2017, Ascential announced its intention to sell 13 titles including &quot;New Civil Engineer&quot;; the 13 &quot;heritage titles&quot; were to be &quot;hived off into a separate business while buyers are sought.&quot; The brands were purchased by Metropolis International Ltd (owner of the &quot;Property Week&quot; title since 2013) in a £23.5m cash deal, announced on 1 June 2017.

Jacqueline Whitelaw was the magazine&#x27;s deputy editor from 1998 to 2009.

<doc id="599674" wikidata="Q1129321" url="?curid=599674" title="Antheridium">
<text>An antheridium is a haploid structure or organ producing and containing male gametes (called &quot;antherozoids&quot; or sperm). The plural form is antheridia, and a structure containing one or more antheridia is called an androecium. The androecium is also the collective term for the stamens of flowering plants.

Antheridia are present in the gametophyte phase of cryptogams like bryophytes and ferns. Many algae and some fungi, for example, ascomycetes and water moulds, also have antheridia during their reproductive stages. In gymnosperms and angiosperms, the male gametophytes have been reduced to pollen grains, and in most of these, the antheridia have been reduced to a single generative cell within the pollen grain. During pollination, this generative cell divides and gives rise to sperm cells.

The female counterpart to the antheridium in cryptogams is the archegonium, and in flowering plants is the gynoecium.

An antheridium typically consists of sterile cells and spermatogenous tissue. The sterile cells may form a central support structure or surround the spermatogenous tissue as a protective jacket. The spermatogenous cells give rise to spermatids via mitotic cell division. In some bryophytes, the antheridium is borne on an antheridiophore, a stalk-like structure that carries the antheridium at its apex.

<doc id="599676" wikidata="Q1307153" url="?curid=599676" title="The Rules of Attraction">
<text>The Rules of Attraction is a satirical black comedy novel by Bret Easton Ellis published in 1987. The novel follows a handful of rowdy and often promiscuous, spoiled bohemian students at a liberal arts college in 1980s New Hampshire, including three who develop a love triangle. The novel is written in first person narrative, and the story is told from the points of view of various characters.

The book was adapted into a film of the same name in 2002. Ellis has remarked that among film adaptations of his books, &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; came closest to capturing his sensibility and recreating the world of his novels.

==Plot summary==
The novel is written in the first-person, continuing the aesthetic of Ellis&#x27; earlier &quot;Less than Zero&quot;, and is told from the points of view of multiple characters. The main narrators are three students: Paul, Sean, and Lauren. A number of other characters also provide first-hand accounts throughout the story, which takes place at the fictional Camden College, a liberal arts school on the East Coast of the United States. The three main characters (who rarely attend class) end up in a love triangle within a sequence of drug runs, &quot;Dressed to Get Screwed&quot; parties, and &quot;End of the World&quot; parties.

The story begins and ends midway through a sentence (the first word in the book being &#x27;and&#x27;, the last words are &#x27;and she&#x27;) in order to give the effect that it begins somewhere closer to the middle, rather than at a true beginning (in medias res). Another interpretation is that the story has neither a beginning nor an ending, signifying the endless cycle of in which the characters of the novel engage. This is sometimes mistaken by readers as a typographical error or the result of a missing page, but was purposely written by Ellis.

==Characters==

===Sean Bateman===
Sean is a 21-year-old student from a wealthy family. He is very promiscuous and a heavy substance abuser, as well as a drug dealer in the employ of Rupert Guest. He becomes romantically involved with Lauren, a relationship he considers to be true love. It is also implied that Sean is bisexual, as he apparently becomes involved in a sexual relationship with Paul. However, whether these encounters are real or simply a product of Paul&#x27;s imagination is left ambiguous; Paul narrates sexual incidents between himself and Sean, while such incidents are absent from Sean&#x27;s own narration.

Sean is very bitter, cynical, and rather dim-witted, and is prone to self-loathing as well. He is also heavily implied to be somewhat of a sociopath, showing incredibly impulsive behavior (sleeping with Lauren&#x27;s friend Judy, and at one point, breaking a box of singles he owns for no reason at all) and having no consideration for other people. He attempts suicide at multiple points in the book, first by hanging, then by slashing his wrist with a dull razor, and then by overdose after a falling out with Lauren. A major subplot in the novel is Sean&#x27;s debt to Rupert, a violent drug dealer who often threatens to kill him. The character is the brother of the notorious Patrick Bateman and has also appeared in Ellis&#x27;s other novels, &quot;American Psycho&quot;, &quot;The Informers&quot; and &quot;Glamorama&quot;.

===Lauren Hynde===
Lauren is a painter and poet who has sexual relations with several boys on campus, all the while pining for Victor, her boyfriend who left Camden and headed to Europe. She is often depressed and very emotional. She is in her senior year at Camden.
At the beginning of the novel, it is revealed that Lauren lost her virginity at a party during her freshman year at Camden, where she got so intoxicated that she passed out in bed with another student only to awaken and find herself being raped by a pair of townies. She becomes romantically involved with Sean Bateman halfway through the book, even though she holds Sean in contempt and considers the relationship nothing but a way to pass the time before Victor comes back from Europe. She was also in a relationship with Paul before the events of the book take place. In &quot;Glamorama&quot;, the character is revealed to have died shortly after the end of this novel. Her place is then taken by a body double who becomes reacquainted with Victor after having become a successful model and actress.

===Paul Denton===
Paul is a young bisexual man who used to date Lauren. He is extremely attracted to Sean and claims that in bed Sean is &quot;crazed, an untamed animal, it was almost scary&quot; yet these thoroughly described accounts are entirely absent from Sean&#x27;s entries. For example, the night Paul writes an account of his and Sean&#x27;s first sexual encounter after the two talk in Paul&#x27;s bedroom, Sean writes in his own account that he simply went home after talking to Paul, the two entries therefore lying in contradiction to one another. However, the true details of this relationship remain ambiguous and open to the reader&#x27;s interpretation. Paul also had relationships with two other important characters, Mitchell and Richard (Dick). Paul is highly intelligent and passionate, but is not above obscuring these facts in the course of seduction. Several characters in the book remark upon his physical attractiveness, brought out by Roman features and soft blond hair. Paul&#x27;s relationship with his mother, Eve, is complex; she yearns to reach out to him but is led towards iciness by Paul&#x27;s flippancy, which in turn feeds their animosity.

===Supporting characters===
*Victor Johnson – Lauren&#x27;s boyfriend. Victor took the term off to backpack through Europe. During his time in Europe, he sleeps with many people and abuses many drugs. His entries consist of long diatribes listing his adventures, including a search for a girl named Jaime, who he claims to love. Lauren yearns for him, anxiously awaiting his return, and when he does come back to New Hampshire, he is not interested in seeing her at all. He is the main character in Ellis&#x27; later novel, &quot;Glamorama&quot;.
*Clay – The protagonist of &quot;Less than Zero&quot;, aka &quot;the guy from L.A.&quot;, who narrates one chapter of the novel. His trademark lines begin &quot;People are afraid to ...&quot;. Still unhappy while at Camden, Clay longs to return home to L.A.; he wishes the reverse in &quot;Less than Zero&quot;.
*Rupert Guest – A violent drug dealer and Sean&#x27;s supplier. A major subplot in the book is Sean&#x27;s debt to him.
*Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Jared – An old friend of Paul Denton&#x27;s who attends Sarah Lawrence College. They are friends with benefits.
*Patrick Bateman – Sean&#x27;s older brother, an investment banker who is much more focused and successful than Sean. The brothers loathe each other for their very different outlooks on and approaches to life. He narrates a chapter of the novel and returns as the main character of Ellis&#x27;s follow-up novel, &quot;American Psycho&quot;, in which it is revealed that he is a serial killer or believes himself to be one.
*Sean&#x27;s admirer – An unnamed student (although her name is probably Mary) who sends Sean anonymous love letters. Her entries in the book are all italicized letters to Sean. She hopes to reveal herself to Sean at the Dressed To Get Screwed Party midway through the book, but when she sees him leave with Lauren, she is heartbroken and commits suicide in a bathtub by slashing her wrists.
*Bertrand – Sean&#x27;s French roommate, whom he despises. Sean continuously refers to him as &quot;The Frog.&quot; He pines for Lauren and narrates one section of the book entirely in French. He also appears in &quot;Glamorama&quot; with an intense hatred for Victor from the anguish he had caused Lauren.
*Stuart – A student who moves into the room across from Paul Denton. He previously had a crush on Paul when they shared a drama class, from which Stuart subsequently withdrew after he botched a scene with Paul. He later hopes to run into Paul after he moves across the hall, and hopes (unsuccessfully) to see him at the Dressed to Get Screwed Party. He also has a friend named Dennis.
*Mitchell Allen – A previous fling of Paul&#x27;s who has reverted into the closet. He later reappears in Ellis&#x27; &quot;Lunar Park&quot;.
*Roxanne - A friend of Lauren&#x27;s who, like Sean, gets drugs from Rupert. Roxanne dates Rupert during the novel and Sean states that he was also seeing her at one point.
*Judy - A friend of Lauren&#x27;s who sleeps with Sean after a party, which ruins Sean and Lauren&#x27;s relationship.

==Setting of the novel==
The story is set at Camden College, a fictional liberal arts college in northeastern New Hampshire that is based on Ellis&#x27; &quot;alma mater&quot;, Bennington College. The novel&#x27;s &quot;Dress To Get Screwed&quot; parties are based on Bennington&#x27;s infamous real-life &quot;Dress To Get Laid&quot; parties, held every semester, or, later, only in the fall, since the 1970s at least. In many ways, Camden mirrors Ellis&#x27; alma mater, Bennington College, and Hampden College, the setting of Donna Tartt&#x27;s novel &quot;The Secret History&quot;. Both books contain cross-references to each other&#x27;s story lines and characters, as well as mention of actual campus buildings. Tartt mentions the suicide of a freshman girl in passing, while Ellis repeatedly mentions a group of classics majors who &quot;dress like undertakers&quot; and are suspected of staging pagan rituals and slaying farmers in the countryside (a reference to &quot;The Secret History&quot;). There is also mention of a &quot;nice girl from Rockaway&quot; in one of Lauren&#x27;s narrations. This is possibly Alex from Jill Eisenstadt&#x27;s novel &quot;From Rockaway&quot;, who attended Camden College in the novel.

==Film==

&quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; was adapted into a film of the same name in 2002. It was directed by Roger Avary and starred James Van Der Beek as Sean, Shannyn Sossamon as Lauren, Ian Somerhalder as Paul, and Kip Pardue as Victor.

<text>Gyeongbokgung (), also known as Gyeongbok Palace or Gyeongbokgung Palace, was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. Built in 1395, it is located in northern Seoul, South Korea. The largest of the Five Grand Palaces built by the Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung served as the home of the royal/imperial family and the seat of government.

Gyeongbokgung continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the premises were destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (1592–1598) and abandoned for two centuries. However, in the 19th century, all of the palace&#x27;s 7,700 rooms were restored under the leadership of Prince Regent Heungseon during the reign of King Gojong. Some 500 buildings were restored on a site of over 40 hectares. The architectural principles of ancient Korea were incorporated into the tradition and appearance of the Joseon royal court.

In the early 20th century, much of the palace was systematically destroyed by Imperial Japan during its occupation of Korea. On January 21, 1963, it was designated as a cultural property. Since the 1990s, the walled palace complex is gradually being restored to its original form. It also houses the National Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum within the premises of the complex.

==Overview==
Gyeongbokgung, located in north of Gwanghwamun Square, was built three years after the Joseon dynasty was founded and it served as its main palace. With the mountain Bugaksan behind it and the Street of Six Ministries (today&#x27;s Sejongno) outside Gwanghwamun Gate, the main entrance to the palace, Gyeongbokgung was situated in the heart of the Korean capital city. It was steadily expanded before being reduced to ashes during the Japanese invasion of 1592.

For the next 273 years the palace grounds were left derelict until being rebuilt in 1867 under the leadership of Regent Heungseon Daewongun. The restoration was completed on a grand scale, with 330 buildings crowded together in a labyrinthine configuration. Within the palace walls were the Outer Court (&quot;oejeon&quot;), offices for the king and state officials, and the Inner Court (&quot;naejeon&quot;), which included living quarters for the royal family as well as gardens for leisure. Within its extensive precincts were other palaces, large and small, including &quot;Junggung&quot; (the Queen&#x27;s residence) and &quot;Donggung&quot; (the Crown Prince&#x27;s residence).

Due to its status as the symbol of national sovereignty, Gyeongbokgung was extensively damaged during the Japanese occupation of the early 20th century. In 1911, ownership of land at the palace was transferred to the Japanese governor-general. In 1915, on the pretext of holding an exhibition, more than 90% of the buildings were torn down. Following the exhibition, the Japanese leveled whatever still remained and built their colonial headquarters, the Government-General Building (1916–26), on the site. Only a handful of iconic structures survived, including the Throne Hall and Gyeonghoeru Pavilion.

Restoration efforts have been ongoing since 1990. The Government-General Building was removed in 1996 and Heungnyemun Gate (2001) and Gwanghwamun Gate (2006–2010) were reconstructed in their original locations and forms. Reconstructions of the Inner Court and Crown Prince&#x27;s residence have also been completed.

The current total area is .

==History==

===14th–16th centuries===

Gyeongbokgung was originally constructed in 1394 by King Taejo, the first king and the founder of the Joseon dynasty, and its name was conceived by an influential government minister named Jeong Do-jeon. Afterwards, the palace was continuously expanded during the reign of King Taejong and King Sejong the Great. It was severely damaged by fire in 1553, and its costly restoration, ordered by King Myeongjong, was completed in the following year.

However, four decades later, Gyeongbokgung was burnt to the ground during the Japanese invasions of Korea of 1592–1598 when Koreans angry at the court of King Seonjo for evacuating Seoul torched the royal residence. The royal court was moved to the palace Changdeokgung. Gyeongbokgung site was left in ruins for the next three centuries.

===19th century===
In 1867, during the regency of Daewongun, the palace buildings were reconstructed and formed a massive complex with 330 buildings and 5,792 rooms. Standing on 4,657,576 square feet (432,703 square meters) of land, Gyeongbokgung again became an iconic symbol for both the Korean nation and the Korean royal family. In 1894, the Japanese occupied the palace and forced Gojong to establish a pro-Japanese government. In 1895, after the assassination of Empress Myeongseong by Japanese agents, her husband, Emperor Gojong, left the palace. The Imperial Family never returned to Gyeongbokgung.

===20th–21st centuries===

In 1915, it was used as the site for the Joseon Industrial Exhibition with new exhibition buildings being erected in the grounds.

Starting from 1911, the colonial government of the Empire of Japan systemically demolished all but 10 buildings during the Japanese occupation of Korea and hosted numerous exhibitions in Gyeongbokgung, ongoing demotion was opposed by Yanagi Sōetsu. In 1926, the government constructed the massive Japanese General Government Building in front of the throne hall, , in order to eradicate the symbol and heritage of the Joseon dynasty. Gwanghwamun Gate, the main and south gate of Gyeongbokgung, was relocated by the Japanese to the east of the palace. A further exhibition, the Chosun Exhibition, followed in 1929.

The palace faced further damage when the wooden structure of the relocated Gwanghwamun Gate was completely destroyed amid the devastation of the Korean War.

Gyeongbokgung&#x27;s original 19th-century palace buildings that survived both the Japanese rule of Colonial Korea and the Korean War include: 
*Geunjeongjeon (the Imperial Throne Hall) — National Treasure No. 223.
*Gyeonghoeru Pavilion — National Treasure No. 224.
*Hyangwonjeong Pavilion; Jagyeongjeon Hall; Jibokjae Hall; Sajeongjeon Hall; and Sujeongjeon Hall.

Modern archaeological surveys have brought 330 building foundations to light.

====Restoration====
In 1989, the South Korean government started a 40-year initiative to rebuild the hundreds of structures that were destroyed by the colonial government of the Empire of Japan, during the period of occupied Colonial Korea (1910–1945).

In 1995, the Japanese General Government Building, after many controversial debates about its fate, was demolished in order to reconstruct Heungnyemun Gate and its cloisters. The National Museum of Korea, then located on the palace grounds, were moved to temporary accommodations in December 1996, before being relocated to a new building in Yongsan District in 2005.

By the end of 2009, it was estimated that approximately 40 percent of the structures that were standing before the Japanese occupation of Korea were restored or reconstructed. As a part of phase 5 of the Gyeongbokgung restoration initiative, Gwanghwamun, the main gate to the palace, was restored to its original design. Another 20-year restoration project is planned by the South Korean government to restore Gyeongbokgung to its former status.

==Buildings==

===Gwanghwamun===
Gwanghwamun () is the main gate of Gyeongbokgung.

===Geunjeongjeon===

Geunjeongjeon (), also known as Geunjeongjeon Hall, is the throne hall where the king formally granted audiences to his officials, gave declarations of national importance, and greeted foreign envoys and ambassadors during the Joseon period. The building was designated as Korea&#x27;s National Treasure No. 223 on January 8, 1985. 
Geunjeongmun (), aligned and located directly to the south of Geunjeongjeon, is the main gate to the courtyard and to Geunjeongjeon. The gate is divided into three separate aisles, and only the king was allowed to walk through the center.

Geunjeongjeon was originally constructed in 1395 during the reign of King Taejo, but was burned down in 1592 when the Japanese invaded Korea. The present building was built in 1867 when Gyeongbokgung was being reconstructed. The name Geunjeongjeon, created by the minister Jeong Do-jeon, means &quot;diligent governance hall&quot;.

Constructed mainly of wood, Geunjeongjeon sits on the center of a large rectangular courtyard, on top of a two-tiered stone platform. This two-tiered platform is lined with detailed balustrades and is decorated with numerous sculptures depicting imaginary and real animals, such as dragons and phoenixes. The stone-paved courtyard is lined with two rows of rank stones, called &quot;pumgyeseok&quot; (), indicating where the court officials are to stand according to their ranks. The whole courtyard is fully enclosed by wooden cloisters.

===Sajeongjeon===
Sajeongjeon (), also called Sajeongjeon Hall, is a building used as the main executive office by the king during the Joseon Dynasty. Located behind Geunjeongjeon Hall, the king carried out his executive duties and held meetings with the top government officials in Sajeongjeon.

Two separate side buildings, Cheonchujeon () and Manchunjeon (), flank the west and east of Sajeongjeon, and while Sajeongjeon is not equipped with a heating system, these buildings are equipped with Ondols for their use in the colder months.

===Gyeonghoeru===
Gyeonghoeru (), also known as Gyeonghoeru Pavilion, is a hall used to hold important and special state banquets during the Joseon Dynasty. It is registered as Korea&#x27;s National Treasure No. 224 on January 8, 1985.

The first Gyeonghoeru was constructed in 1412, the 12th year of the reign of King Taejong, but was burned down during the Japanese invasions of Korea in 1592. The present building was constructed in 1867 (the 4th year of the reign of King Gojong) on an island of an artificial, rectangular lake that is 128 m wide and 113 m across.

Constructed mainly of wood and stone, Gyeonghoeru has a form where the wooden structure of the building sits on top of 48 massive stone pillars, with wooden stairs connecting the second floor to the first floor. The outer perimeters of Gyeonghoeru are supported by square pillars while the inner columns are cylindrical; they were placed thus to represent the idea of Yin &amp; Yang. When Gyeonghoeru was originally built in 1412, these stone pillars were decorated with sculptures depicting dragons rising to the sky, but these details were not reproduced when the building was rebuilt in the 19th century. Three stone bridges connect the building to the palace grounds, and corners of the balustrades around the island are decorated with sculptures depicting twelve Zodiac animals.

Gyeonghoeru used to be represented on the 10,000 won Korean banknotes (1983–2002 Series).

===Sujeongjeon===
Sujeongjeon (), a building located to the south of Gyeonghoeru, was constructed in 1867 and used by the cabinet of the Joseon dynasty.
It is Korea&#x27;s Treasure No. 1760, where Jiphyeonjeon Hall was located during King Sejong&#x27;s reign. The historical and architectural value is high because it is the only building that remains in the outer space corresponding to the west side of Geunjeongjeon Hall.

===Gangnyeongjeon===

Gangnyeongjeon (), also called Gangnyeongjeon Hall, is a building used as the king&#x27;s main residing quarters. First constructed in 1395, the fourth year of King Taejo, the building contains the king&#x27;s bed-chamber. Destroyed during the Japanese invasions of Korea in 1592, the building was rebuilt when Gyeongbokgung was reconstructed in 1867, but it was again burned down by a major fire in November 1876 and had to be restored in 1888 following the orders of King Gojong.

However, when Huijeongdang of Changdeokgung Palace was burned down by a fire in 1917, the Japanese government dismembered the building and used its construction materials to restore Huijeongdang in 1920. Current Gangnyeongjeon was built in 1994, meticulously restoring the building to its original specifications and design.

Gangnyeongjeon consists of corridors and fourteen rectangular chambers, each seven chambers located to the left and right side of the building in a layout out like a checkerboard. The king used the central chamber while the court attendants occupied the remaining side chambers to protect, assist, and to receive orders. The building rests on top of a tall stone foundation, and a stone deck or veranda is located in front of the building.

The noted feature of the building is an absence of a top white roof ridge called &quot;yongmaru&quot; () in Korean. Many theories exist to explain the absence, of which a prominent one states that, since the king was symbolized as the dragon during the Joseon dynasty, the &quot;yongmaru&quot;, which contains the letter dragon or &quot;yong&quot; (龍), cannot rest on top of the king when he is asleep.

===Gyotaejeon===
Gyotaejeon (), also called Gyotaejeon Hall, is a building used as the main residing quarters by the queen during the Joseon Dynasty. The building is located behind Gangnyeongjeon, the king&#x27;s quarters, and contains the queen&#x27;s bed chamber. It was first constructed in around 1440, the 22nd year of King Sejong the Great.

King Sejong, who was noted to have a frail health later in his reign, decided to carry out his executive duties in Gangnyeongjeon, where his bed-chamber is located, instead of Sajeongjeon. Since this decision meant many government officials routinely needed to visit and intrude Gangnyeongjeon, King Sejong had Gyotaejeon built in consideration of his wife the queen&#x27;s privacy.

The building was burned down in 1592 when the Japanese invaded Korea, but was reconstructed in 1867. Nevertheless, when Daejojeon of Changdeokgung Palace was burned down by a fire in 1917, the Japanese government disassembled the building and recycled its construction materials to restore Daejojeon. The current building was reconstructed in 1994 according to its original design and specifications. The building, like Gangnyeongjeon, does not have a top roof ridge called &quot;yongmaru&quot;.

Amisan (), a famous garden created from an artificial mound, is located behind Gyotaejeon. Four hexagonal chimneys, constructed around 1869 in orange bricks and decorative roof tiles, adorn Amisan without showing their utilitarian function and are notable examples of formative art created during the Joseon Dynasty. The chimneys were registered as Korea&#x27;s Treasure No. 811 on January 8, 1985.

===Hyangwonjeong===
Hyangwonjeong (), or Hyangwonjeong Pavilion, is a small, two-story hexagonal pavilion built around 1873 by the order of King Gojong when Geoncheonggung residence was built to the north within Gyeongbokgung.

The pavilion was constructed on an artificial island of a lake named Hyangwonji (), and a bridge named Chwihyanggyo () connects it to the palace grounds. The name &quot;Hyangwonjeong&quot; is loosely translated as &quot;Pavilion of Far-Reaching Fragrance&quot;, while &quot;Chwihyanggyo&quot; is &quot;Bridge Intoxicated with Fragrance&quot;.

The bridge Chwihyanggyo was originally located on the north side of the island and was the longest bridge constructed purely of wood during the Joseon dynasty; however, it was destroyed during the Korean War. The bridge was reconstructed in its present form on the south side of the island in 1953, but is now relocated to its original location on the north side.

===Jagyeongjeon===
Jagyeongjeon (), also called Jagyeongjeon Hall, is a building used as the main residing quarters by Queen Sinjeong (), the mother of King Heonjong. First constructed in 1865, it was burned down twice by a fire but was reconstructed in 1888. Jagyeongjeon is the only royal residing quarters in Gyeongbokgung that survived the demolition campaigns of the Japanese government during the Japanese occupation of Korea.

The chimneys of Jagyeongjeon are decorated with ten signs of longevity to wish for a long life for the late queen, while the west walls of the Jagyeongjeon compound are adorned with floral designs. The protruding southeast part of Jagyeongjeon, named Cheongyeollu (), is designed to provide a cooler space during the summer, while the northwest part of Jagyeongjeon, named Bogandang (), is designed for the winter months. The eastern part of Jagyeogjeon, named Hyeopgyeongdang () and distinguished by the building&#x27;s lower height, was used by the late queen&#x27;s assistants.

The building and the decorative walls were registered as Korea&#x27;s Treasure No. 809 on January 8, 1985.

===Jibokjae===
Jibokjae (), located next to Geoncheonggung Residence, is a two-story private library used by King Gojong. In 1876, a major fire occurred in Gyeongbokgung, and King Gojong, for a brief period, moved and resided in Changdeokgung Palace. He eventually moved back to Gyeongbokgung in 1888, but he had the pre-existing Jibokjae building disassembled and moved from Changdeokgung to the present location in 1891. Its name, &quot;Jibokjae&quot;, translates loosely in English as the &quot;Hall of Collecting Jade&quot;.

The building uniquely shows heavy influence of Chinese architecture instead of traditional Korean palace architecture. Its side walls were entirely constructed in brick, a method commonly employed by the contemporary Chinese, and its roof formations, interior screens, and columns also show Chinese influences. Its architecture possibly was meant to give it an exotic appearance.

Jibokjae is flanked by Parujeong (), an octagonal two-story pavilion, to the left and Hyeopgildang () to the right. Parujeong was constructed to store books, while Hyeopgildang served as a part of Jibokjae. Both of the buildings are internally connected to Jibokjae.

Bohyeondang () and Gahoejeong (), buildings that also formed a library complex to the south of Jibokjae, were demolished by the Japanese government in the early 20th century.

===Taewonjeon===
Taewonjeon (), or Taewonjeon Shrine, is an ancestral shrine originally built in 1868 to house a portrait of King Taejo, the founder of the Joseon dynasty, and to perform rites to the deceased royalties. Completely destroyed by the Japanese government in the early 20th century, the shrine was accurately restored to its former design in 2005.

===Donggung===

Donggung (), located south of the Hyangwonjeong pavilion, were the living quarters for the crown prince and his wife. The four main buildings of the compound were Jaseondang and Bihyeongak, Chunbang (the lecture hall, where the prince received the preparatory education in order to become a future monarch), as well as Gyebang (the security building).

In the 19th century, the future Emperor Sunjong lived in the compound. Donggung was razed to the ground during the Japanese occupation. The restoration work started in 1999 but only Jaseondang and Bihyeongak were restored.
In 2020, the Royal Palaces and Tombs Center (hereinafter RPTC) of the Cultural Heritage Administration (CHA) announced its plans to restore the Donggung area to its original layout. The restoration work of the remaining buildings began in March 2020 and was planned to be completed in late January 2023.

===Geoncheonggung===
Geoncheonggung (), also known as Geoncheonggung Residence, was a private royal residence built by King Gojong within the palace grounds in 1873.

King Gojong resided in Geoncheonggung from 1888 and the residence was continuously expanded, but on October 8, 1895, Empress Myeongseong, the wife of King Gojong, was brutally assassinated by the Japanese agents at the residence. Her body was burned and buried near the residence.

Haunted by the experiences of the incident, the king left the palace in January 1896 and never again returned to the residence. Demolished completely by the Japanese government in 1909, the residence was accurately reconstructed to its former design and opened to the public in 2007.

===Governor-General&#x27;s Residence (dismantled)===
The back garden of Gyeongbokgung used to contain the main part of the Japanese Governor-General&#x27;s residence, that was built in the early 20th century during the Japanese occupation. With the establishment of the Republic of Korea in 1948, President Syngman Rhee used it as his office and residence. In 1993, after President Kim Young-sam&#x27;s civilian administration was launched, the Japanese Governor-General&#x27;s residence in the Cheongwadae compound was dismantled to remove a major symbol of the Japanese colonialism.

==Tourism==
In 2011 a survey was conducted by the Seoul Development Institute, which included 800 residents and 103 urban planners and architects. 39 percent of residents voted the palace as the most scenic location in Seoul, following Namsan and Han River in the top spots.

As of April 2024, It is open from 9 am to 5 pm in January, February, November, and December, from 10 am to 6 pm in March, April, May, September, and October, and from 9 am to 6:30 pm in June, July, and August.

===Events===
In a poll of nearly 2,000 foreign visitors, conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in November 2011, stated that watching the changing of the guards at the main gate Gwanghwamun is their third favorite activity in Seoul. The royal changing of the guard ceremony is held in front of the main gate every hour from 10:00 to 15:00.
There are many tourists wearing hanbok while visiting Gyeongbokgung and there are also a number of rental shops nearby selling hanbok and other traditional Korean clothing.

At Gyeongbokgung, in a program called &quot;Suragan Tasting Sympathy&quot;, visitors can experience royal food and watch traditional performances.

On selected days from April to October, Gyeongbokgung offers special &#x27;nighttime viewing&#x27; sessions from 7PM to 10PM. 4,500 tickets are offered each session which could be reserved online or purchased on-site (ID required). However, on-site tickets are available &quot;only&quot; for foreigners and senior citizens age 65 and over, for which 500 and 50 tickets are allocated respectively. In 2019, Gyeongbokgung held 71 nighttime viewing sessions.

From September 1, 2022 to November 6, 2022, Gyeongbokgung offers special &#x27;nighttime viewing&#x27; sessions from 7PM to 9:30PM The admission fee is 3,000 won. Online reservations and on-site reservations are available, and up to two tickets are available per person.

===Changing of the royal guard===
During the Joseon Dynasty, royal guards were in charge of guarding and patrolling the gates of the capital and royal palaces. They played roles by dividing the day and night shifts. Each shift in working hours took place.

Today, the changing ceremony of the royal guard () in front of Gwanghwamun is recreated just like the Joseon Dynasty. It takes place twice a day.

===Access===
Today, Gyeongbokgung is open to the public and houses the National Folk Museum of Korea, the National Palace Museum of Korea, and traditional Korean gardens.

<text>Dicentra (Greek &quot;dís&quot; &quot;twice&quot;, &quot;kéntron&quot; &quot;spur&quot;), known collectively as the bleeding-hearts, is a genus containing eight species of herbaceous flowering perennial plants with unique, &quot;heart&quot;-shaped flowers and finely divided foliage. The species are, primarily, native to North America, although several are found in temperate East Asia.

==Description and growth requirements ==
Flowers have two tiny sepals and four petals. The flowers are bisymmetric: the two outer petals are spurred or pouched at the base and curved outwards or backwards at the tip, and the two inner ones with or without a crest at the tip. In &quot;Dicentra&quot;, all leaves are in a basal rosette, and flowers are on leafless stalks. In other genera with bisymmetric heart-shaped flowers (&quot;Lamprocapnos&quot;, &quot;Dactylicapnos&quot;, &quot;Ichtyoselmis&quot;, &quot;Ehrendorferia&quot;), leaves grow on stems as well as from the root. Each of the two compound stamens is composed of one median and two lateral half stamens fused together. The stamens and pistil are held between the inner petals. 

Native to Northeastern Asia, the Pacific Northwest, as well as parts of the eastern United States, &quot;Dicentra&quot; almost universally prefer growing in cool, temperate, wet forests with excellent drainage, often growing side-by-side with ferns, &quot;Hosta&quot;, mosses, and other shade- or dappled-light-loving species, depending on location and region. While &quot;Dicentra&quot; will bloom in filtered light or shade, if grown in poorly-drained soil and intense lighting, they will not bloom or thrive.

Seeds with elaiosomes are borne in long capsules.

All parts of &quot;Dicentra&quot; are poisonous if ingested.

==Taxonomy==
===Current species===
The genus &quot;Dicentra&quot; includes plants whose flowers and leaves grow on stems directly from the roots. Species with branching stems used to be included in the genus, but have now been moved to other genera.
===Former species===
The genera &quot;Dactylicapnos&quot;, &quot;Ichtyoselmis&quot;, &quot;Ehrendorferia&quot; and &quot;Lamprocapnos&quot; were previously included as subgenera in &quot;Dicentra&quot;, but have been shown not to belong in this genus (see for example Flora of China)

* &quot;Dactylicapnos&quot; (14 species of herbaceous climbers with yellow flowers, Himalaya to SW China)
** &quot;Dactylicapnos burmanica&quot; 
** &quot;Dactylicapnos grandifoliolata&quot; (&quot;Dicentra paucinervia&quot; )
** &quot;Dactylicapnos lichiangensis&quot; 
** &quot;Dactylicapnos macrocapnos&quot; 
** &quot;Dactylicapnos roylei&quot; 
** &quot;Dactylicapnos scandens&quot; 
** &quot;Dactylicapnos schneideri&quot; 
** &quot;Dactylicapnos gaoligongshanensis&quot; 
** &quot;Dactylicapnos torulosa&quot; (&quot;Dicentra wolfdietheri&quot; )
** &quot;Dactylicapnos cordata&quot; 
*&quot;Ehrendorferia&quot; (2 species of erect robust herbaceous perennials with yellow or cream erect flowers, Western N America)
** &quot;Ehrendorferia ochroleuca&quot; =&quot;Dicentra ochroleuca&quot; 
** &quot;Ehrendorferia chrysantha&quot; Golden Ear-drops=&quot;Dicentra chrysantha&quot; 
*&quot;Ichtyoselmis&quot; (1 species of large herbaceous perennial with serrate leaflets and large drooping cream flowers, China, Burma)
** &quot;Ichtyoselmis macrantha&quot; 
*&quot;Lamprocapnos&quot; (1 species of herbaceous perennial with large pink flowers in horizontal racemes, NE China, Korea)
** &quot;Lamprocapnos spectabilis&quot; bleeding heart=&quot;Dicentra spectabilis&quot; 

==Cultivation==

There are several hybrids and cultivars involving &quot;Dicentra eximia&quot;, &quot;Dicentra formosa&quot;, and &quot;Dicentra peregrina&quot;, including (those marked have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit):-

*&quot;Dicentra&quot; &#x27;Aurora&#x27; — &quot;Dicentra formosa&quot; × &quot;Dicentra eximia&quot; — white flowers
*&quot;D. formosa&quot; &#x27;Bacchanal&#x27; () — deep red
*&quot;Dicentra&quot; &#x27;Ivory Hearts&#x27; — &quot;Dicentra peregrina&quot; × &quot;Dicentra eximia&quot; &#x27;Alba&#x27; — white
*&quot;Dicentra&quot; &#x27;King of Hearts&#x27; — &quot;Dicentra peregrina&quot; × (&quot;Dicentra formosa&quot; subsp. &quot;oregana&quot; × &quot;Dicentra eximia&quot;)
*&quot;D. formosa&quot; &#x27;Langtrees&#x27; () 
*&quot;Dicentra&quot; &#x27;Luxuriant&#x27; () — &quot;Dicentra formosa&quot; × &quot;Dicentra eximia&quot; × &quot;Dicentra peregrina&quot;

*&quot;Dicentra&quot; &#x27;Stuart Boothman&#x27; ()

Hybrids involving &quot;Dicentra peregrina&quot; are often intolerant of hot, humid climates and sun, like the species itself.

<doc id="599691" wikidata="Q312763" url="?curid=599691" title="Muhammad XII of Granada">
<text>Abu Abdallah Muhammad XII (; –1533), known in Europe as Boabdil, was the 22nd and last Nasrid ruler of the Emirate of Granada in Iberia.

==Sultan==

Muhammad XII was the son of Abu l-Hasan Ali, Sultan of the Emirate of Granada whom he succeeded in 1482, as a result of both court intrigue and unrest amongst the population at large.

Muhammad XII soon sought to gain prestige by invading Castile, but was taken prisoner at Lucena in 1483. Muhammad&#x27;s father was then restored as ruler of Granada, to be replaced in 1485 by his uncle Muhammad XIII, also known as Abdullah ez Zagal.

Muhammad obtained his freedom and Christian support to recover his throne in 1487, by consenting to hold Granada as a tributary kingdom under the Catholic monarchs. He further undertook not to intervene in the Siege of Málaga, in which Málaga was taken by the Christians.

Following the fall of Málaga and Baza in 1487, Almuñécar, Salobreña and Almería were taken by the Christians the following year. By the beginning of 1491, Granada was the only Muslim-governed city in Iberia.

==Surrender of Granada==

In 1491, Muhammad XII was summoned by Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon to surrender the city of Granada, which was besieged by the Castilians. Eventually, on 2 January 1492, Granada was surrendered. The royal procession moved from Santa Fe to a place a little more than a mile from Granada, where Ferdinand took up his position by the banks of the Genil. A private letter written by an eyewitness to the Bishop of León only six days after the event recorded the scene:


The Moorish sultan, with about eighty or a hundred on horseback and very well dressed, went forth to kiss the hand of their Highnesses. According to the final capitulation the key to Granada will pass into Spanish hands without Muhammad XII having to kiss the hands of Los Reyes, as the Spanish royal couple Isabella and Fernando became known. The indomitable mother of Muhammad XII insisted on sparing her son this final humiliation of kissing the hand of Isabella.

Christopher Columbus seems to have been present; he refers to the surrender:

After your Highnesses ended the war of the Moors who reigned in Europe, and finished the war of the great city of Granada, where this present year 1492 on the 2nd January I saw the royal banners of Your Highnesses planted by force of arms on the towers of the Alhambra.

==Exile==
Legend has it that as Muhammad XII went into exile, he reached a rocky prominence which gave a last view of the city. Here he reined in his horse and viewed for the last time the Alhambra and the green valley that spread below. The place where this allegedly took place is today known as the Suspiro del Moro, &quot;the Moor&#x27;s sigh&quot;. Muhammad mourned his loss, and continued his journey to exile accompanied by his mother—who is supposed to have snapped, &quot;Weep, weep like a woman, over what you couldn&#x27;t defend like a man.&quot;

Muhammad XII was given an estate in Laujar de Andarax, Las Alpujarras, a mountainous area between the Sierra Nevada and the Mediterranean Sea. He crossed the Mediterranean in exile, departing in October 1493 from Adra and landing in Cazaza. He settled in Fes, accompanied by an entourage of 1,130 courtiers and servants. Large numbers of the Muslim population of Granada had already fled to North Africa, taking advantage of a clause in the articles of surrender that permitted free passage.

===Letter to the Marinid Sultan of Morocco===
Shortly after his surrender, Muhammad Boabdil sent a long letter to the Marinid rulers of Morocco asking for refuge. The letter begins with a long poem praising the Marinids, followed by a prose passage where he laments his defeat and asks forgiveness for past wrongdoings of his forefathers against the Marinids. The entire text was reported by al-Maqqari:
===North African exile and death===
The 17th-century historian Al-Maqqari wrote that Muhammad XII crossed the Mediterranean to Melilla then went to Fes where he built a palace. He stayed there until his death in 1518 or 1533. He is said to have been buried in a small domed tomb near a &quot;musalla&quot; (place of prayer), located outside of Bab Mahrouk in Fes. Muhammad XII was survived by two sons; Yusef and Ahmed. Al-Maqqari met with his descendants in 1618 in Fes; they lived in a state of poverty and relied on the Zakat.

An alternative final resting place for Muhammad XII is suggested by the late nineteenth century Arabist M.C. Brosselard, who translated a lengthy prescription in Andalusian script on a three-foot long onyx slab held in the town museum of Tlemcen. This epitaph marked the tomb of the exiled king &quot;our lord Abu-Abdullah&quot; who died in Tlemcen in May 1494, aged thirty-four. The conflict between places and dates of death may arise from confusion between Muhammad XII and his uncle El Zagal, who also died in North African exile.

Spanish chronicler Luis del Mármol Carvajal wrote &quot;Muhammad XII died near the Oued el Assouad (Black River) at ford told Waqûba during the war between the Marinids and the Saadians&quot;, placing his death in 1536. This source is also taken by Louis de Chénier, a diplomat of King Louis XVI of France, in his &quot;Historical research on the Moors and History of the Empire of Morocco&quot; published in Paris in 1787.

==Muhammad XII in popular culture==

* He is a main character in John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;The Conquest of Granada&quot;, a heroic drama in two parts, 1672.
* He is mentioned often by Washington Irving in &quot;Tales of the Alhambra&quot; (1832), particularly in the chapter &quot;Mementos of Boabdil.&quot;
* He was the subject of the three-act opera &quot;Boabdil, der letzte Maurenkönig&quot;, Op. 49, written in 1892 by the Jewish-German-Polish composer Moritz Moszkowski.
* Spanish composer Gaspar Cassadó wrote the &quot;Lamento de Boabdil&quot; for cello and piano, in memory of the king.
* Spanish composer Antón García Abril wrote the &#x27;Elegía a la pérdida de la Alhambra&#x27; from his song cycle &quot;Canciones del Jardin Secreto&quot; for voice and piano; it is set to text (in Andalusian Arabic) that is attributed to Boabdil, in which he laments the loss of the Alhambra.
* Abu Abdallah appears as the main character in &quot;De Ongelukkige&quot; published in 1915 by Dutch author Louis Couperus. This novel covers the last decade of Abu Abdallah&#x27;s reign as ruler of the Emirate of Granada.
* In the 1931 anthology &quot;If It Had Happened Otherwise&quot;, the alternate history scenario &quot;If the Moors in Spain Had Won&quot; by Philip Guedalla has the premise of Boabdil winning the war against the Spanish, and his kingdom persisting into the 20th century.
* He figures in the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II: Discovery&quot; for the iOS and Nintendo DS, as an ally of the Assassins.
* He is portrayed by Khalid Abdalla in the film &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; (2016).
* Andalusian singer-songwriter and poet dedicated a song to Muhammad XII in his album &quot;Crónicas Granadinas&quot;, entitled &quot;Caída del Rey Chico&quot;.
* Salman Rushdie&#x27;s book, &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Last Sigh&quot;, also features consistent references to Muhammad XII.
* He appears as a character in &quot;Leo Africanus&quot; by Amin Maalouf.
* Louis Aragon&#x27;s book &quot;Le Fou d&#x27;Elsa&quot; renders a dramatized and poetic version of the story of Granada&#x27;s capture, which includes Muhammad XII as one of the two main characters present in the novel, (Majnun being the other. Elsa, whom it could be argued is the second major character, is absent from the book.).
* Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV) produced a drama in 1980, based on the novel &quot;Shaheen&quot; by Nasim Hijazi. In this drama Abu Abdullah Mohammad XII was played by Shakeel Ahmed.
* Also in 1980 (22 November until 7 February 1981), he appeared in the comics supplement to the Portuguese newspaper &quot;A Capital&quot; in a 12-page comics story on the conquest of Granada with Boabdil as the main character, &quot;Luz do Oriente&quot; (&quot;Light of the Orient&quot;). The script was by popular literature writer and bookman Jorge Magalhães and the drawing was by Portuguese-Guinean sculptor, painter and comic book artist Augusto Trigo.
* Boabdil appeared as main character in the Spanish eight-episode serial &quot;Requiem por Granada&quot; (1991). In this serial, he was played by Manuel Bandera. Young Boabdil was played by Lucas Martín.
* Boabdil appeared as a main character in season two of the Spanish TV Series &quot;Isabel&quot; (2013). In this show, he was played by Álex Martínez.
* He appeared as a main character in the novel &quot;Court of Lions&quot; (2017) by Jane Johnson.
* He appears as a character in G. Willow Wilson’s novel, &quot;The Bird King&quot; (2019), which is set during 1491 and the arrival of the Spanish Inquisition. The protagonist Fatima is his concubine.
* Nathaniel Mackey&#x27;s poem &quot;Sigh of the Moor&quot; in &quot;Splay Anthem&quot; is built around the motif of Boabdil’s abdication.
* Keith Bradbury&#x27;s novel &quot;Let the Dead Hold Your Hand&quot; features the story of Boabdil and the search to find his final resting place.
* He appears in &quot;The Queen’s Vow&quot;, a novel of Isabella of Castile by C.W. Gortner.
* He appears in the E. T. A. Hoffmann short story &quot;Das Sanctus&quot; (or &quot;The Sanctus&quot;) as the antagonist.

<doc id="599709" wikidata="Q1454719" url="?curid=599709" title="Karyogamy">
<text>Karyogamy is the final step in the process of fusing together two haploid eukaryotic cells, and refers specifically to the fusion of the two nuclei. Before karyogamy, each haploid cell has one complete copy of the organism&#x27;s genome. In order for karyogamy to occur, the cell membrane and cytoplasm of each cell must fuse with the other in a process known as plasmogamy. Once within the joined cell membrane, the nuclei are referred to as pronuclei. Once the cell membranes, cytoplasm, and pronuclei fuse, the resulting single cell is diploid, containing two copies of the genome. This diploid cell, called a zygote or zygospore can then enter meiosis (a process of chromosome duplication, recombination, and division, to produce four new haploid cells), or continue to divide by mitosis. Mammalian fertilization uses a comparable process to combine haploid sperm and egg cells (gametes) to create a diploid fertilized egg.

The term karyogamy comes from the Greek &quot;karyo-&quot; (from κάρυον &quot;karyon&quot;) &#x27;nut&#x27; and γάμος &quot;gamos&quot; &#x27;marriage&#x27;.

== Importance in haploid organisms ==

Haploid organisms such as fungi, yeast, and algae can have complex cell cycles, in which the choice between sexual or asexual reproduction is fluid, and often influenced by the environment. Some organisms, in addition to their usual haploid state, can also exist as diploid for a short time, allowing genetic recombination to occur. Karyogamy can occur within either mode of reproduction: during the sexual cycle or in somatic (non-reproductive) cells.

Thus, karyogamy is the key step in bringing together two sets of different genetic material which can recombine during meiosis. In haploid organisms that lack sexual cycles, karyogamy can also be an important source of genetic variation during the process of forming somatic diploid cells. Formation of somatic diploids circumvents the process of gamete formation during the sexual reproduction cycle and instead creates variation within the somatic cells of an already developed organism, such as a fungus.

==Role in sexual reproduction==

The role of karyogamy in sexual reproduction can be demonstrated most simply by single-celled haploid organisms such as the algae of genus &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot; or the yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;. Such organisms exist normally in a haploid state, containing only one set of chromosomes per cell. However, the mechanism remains largely the same among all haploid eukaryotes.

When subjected to environmental stress, such as nitrogen starvation in the case of &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot;, cells are induced to form gametes. Gamete formation in single-celled haploid organisms such as yeast is called sporulation, resulting in many cellular changes that increase resistance to stress. Gamete formation in multicellular fungi occurs in the gametangia, an organ specialized for such a process, usually by meiosis. When opposite mating types meet, they are induced to leave the vegetative cycle and enter the mating cycle. In yeast, there are two mating types, a and α. In fungi, there can be two, four, or even up to 10,000 mating types, depending on the species. Mate recognition in the simplest eukaryotes is achieved through pheromone signaling, which induces shmoo formation (a projection of the cell) and begins the process of microtubule organization and migration. Pheromones used in mating type recognition are often peptides, but sometimes trisporic acid or other molecules, recognized by cellular receptors on the opposite cell. Notably, pheromone signaling is absent in higher fungi such as mushrooms.

The cell membranes and cytoplasm of these haploid cells then fuse together in a process known as plasmogamy. This results in a single cell with two nuclei, known as pronuclei. The pronuclei then fuse together in a well regulated process known as karyogamy. This creates a diploid cell known as a zygote, or a zygospore, which can then enter meiosis, a process of chromosome duplication, recombination, and cell division, to create four new haploid gamete cells. One possible advantage of sexual reproduction is that it results in more genetic variability, providing the opportunity for adaptation through natural selection. Another advantage is efficient recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiosis. Thus, karyogamy is the key step in bringing together a variety of genetic material in order to ensure recombination in meiosis.

The Amoebozoa is a large group of mostly single-celled species that have recently been determined to have the machinery for karyogamy and meiosis. Since the Amoeboza branched off early from the eukaryotic family tree, this finding suggests that karyogamy and meiosis were present early in eukaryotic evolution.

==Cellular mechanisms==

===Pronuclear migration===

The ultimate goal of karyogamy is fusion of the two haploid nuclei. The first step in this process is the movement of the two pronuclei toward each other, which occurs directly after plasmogamy. Each pronucleus has a spindle pole body that is embedded in the nuclear envelope and serves as an attachment point for microtubules. Microtubules, an important fiber-like component of the cytoskeleton, emerge at the spindle pole body. The attachment point to the spindle pole body marks the minus end, and the plus end extends into the cytoplasm. The plus end has normal roles in mitotic division, but during nuclear congression, the plus ends are redirected. The microtubule plus ends attach to the opposite pronucleus, resulting in the pulling of the two pronuclei toward each other.

Microtubule movement is mediated by a family of motor proteins known as kinesins, such as Kar3 in yeast. Accessory proteins, such as Spc72 in yeast, act as a glue, connecting the motor protein, spindle pole body and microtubule in a structure known as the half-bridge. Other proteins, such as Kar9 and Bim1 in yeast, attach to the plus end of the microtubules. They are activated by pheromone signals to attach to the shmoo tip. A shmoo is a projection of the cellular membrane which is the site of initial cell fusion in plasmogamy. After plasmogamy, the microtubule plus ends continue to grow towards the opposite pronucleus. It is thought that the growing plus end of the microtubule attaches directly to the motor protein of the opposite pronucleus, triggering a reorganization of the proteins at the half-bridge. The force necessary for migration occurs directly in response to this interaction.

Two models of nuclear congression have been proposed: the sliding cross-bridge, and the plus end model. In the sliding cross-bridge model, the microtubules run antiparallel to each other for the entire distance between the two pronuclei, forming cross-links to each other, and each attaching to the opposite nucleus at the plus end. This is the favored model. The alternative model proposes that the plus ends contact each other midway between the two pronuclei and only overlap slightly. In either model, it is believed that microtubule shortening occurs at the plus end and requires Kar3p (in yeast), a member of a family of kinesin-like proteins.

Microtubule organization in the cytoskeleton has been shown to be essential for proper nuclear congression during karyogamy. Defective microtubule organization causes total failure of karyogamy, but does not totally interrupt meiosis and spore production in yeast. The failure occurs because the process of nuclear congression cannot occur without functional microtubules. Thus, the pronuclei do not approach close enough to each other to fuse together, and their genetic material remains separated.

===Pronuclear fusion (karyogamy)===
Merging of the nuclear envelopes of the pi occurs in three steps: fusion of the outer membrane, fusion of the inner membrane, and fusion of the spindle pole bodies. In yeast, several members of the Kar family of proteins, as well as a protamine, are required for the fusion of nuclear membranes. The protamine Prm3 is located on the outer surface of each nuclear membrane, and is required for the fusion of the outer membrane. The exact mechanism is not known. Kar5, a kinesin-like protein, is necessary to expand the distance between the outer and inner membranes in a phenomenon known as bridge expansion. Kar8 and Kar2 are thought to be necessary to the fusing of the inner membranes.
As described above, the reorganization of accessory and motor proteins during pronuclear migration also serves to orient the spindle pole bodies in the correct direction for efficient nuclear congression. Nuclear congression can still take place without this pre-orientation of spindle pole bodies, but it is slower. Ultimately the two pronuclei combine the contents of their nucleoplasms and form a single envelope around the result.

==Role in somatic diploids==
Although fungi are normally haploid, diploid cells can arise by two mechanisms. The first is a failure of the mitotic spindle during regular cell division, and does not involve karyogamy. The resulting cell can only be genetically homozygous since it is produced from one haploid cell. The second mechanism, involving karyogamy of somatic cells, can produce heterozygous diploids if the two nuclei differ in genetic information. The formation of somatic diploids is generally rare, and is thought to occur because of a mutation in the karyogamy repressor gene (KR).

There are, however, a few fungi that exist mostly in the diploid state. One example is Candida albicans, a fungus that lives in the gastrointestinal tracts of many warm blooded animals, including humans. Although usually innocuous, &quot;C. albicans&quot; can turn pathogenic and is a particular problem in immunosuppressed patients. Unlike with most other fungi, diploid cells of different mating types fuse to create tetraploid cells which subsequently return to the diploid state by losing chromosomes.

== Similarities to and differences from mammalian fertilization ==
Mammals, including humans, also combine genetic material from two sources - father and mother - in fertilization. This process is similar to karyogamy. As with karyogamy, microtubules play an important part in fertilization and are necessary for the joining of the sperm and egg (oocyte) DNA. Drugs such as griseofulvin that interfere with microtubules prevent the fusion of the sperm and egg pronuclei. The gene KAR2 which plays a large role in karyogamy has a mammalian analog called Bib/GRP78. In both cases, genetic material is combined to create a diploid cell that has greater genetic diversity than either original source. Instead of fusing in the same way as lower eukaryotes do in karyogamy, the sperm nucleus vesiculates and its DNA decondenses. The sperm centriole acts as a microtubule organizing center and forms an aster which extends throughout the egg until contacting the egg&#x27;s nucleus. The two pronuclei migrate toward each other and then fuse to form a diploid cell.

<text>Mission Beach is a community built on a sandbar between the Pacific Ocean and Mission Bay. It is part of the city of San Diego, California.

Mission Beach spans nearly two miles of ocean front. It is bounded by the San Diego River estuary on the south, Mission Bay Park on the east, and the community of Pacific Beach on the north. A boardwalk runs along the beaches on both the ocean and bay sides of the community. The main artery through Mission Beach is Mission Boulevard. The community is divided into South Mission and North Mission. At the south end of the beach on the ocean side is a jetty; on the bay side is a park with grass, parking and a walking path.

== Land ==
Many residential structures in Mission Beach were built in the 1930s and &#x27;40s as summer cottages and some date as early as the 1920s. The rare airplane bungalow on Manhattan Court was built in 1924. Because of problems to work out with developing on sand, Mission Beach developed later than the neighboring communities of Ocean Beach to the south and Pacific Beach to the north. As a result of a new official subdivision in 1914, encouraged by land sales in those next-door communities and a new wooden bridge linking Mission Beach with Ocean Beach, John D. Spreckels offered small lots for sale. As a result, Mission Beach is the most densely developed residential community in San Diego with a land use designation across the majority of its land area of 36 dwelling units per acre. It also has the smallest lots in the city, ranging from to . Few have been consolidated to form larger lots. Many of the structures within the community have been redeveloped into two-story homes. The wooden bridge to Ocean Beach was closed to traffic in 1950 and demolished in 1951.

== History ==

Attractions near Mission Beach include SeaWorld in Mission Bay Park and the historic amusement park Belmont Park in South Mission Beach. Belmont Park was originally built as the Mission Beach Amusement Center by John D. Spreckels in 1925 to stimulate real estate sales and to promote his electric railway. Belmont Park now features the original wooden Giant Dipper Roller Coaster as well as newer rides such as the FlowRider at Wave House, Vertical Plunge, Krazy Kars, Tilt-a-Whirl, Liberty Carousel, Crazy Submarine, The Beach Blaster, and The Chaos.

Designed by architect Frank Walter Stevenson, The Mission Beach Plunge in Belmont Park, a -by- saltwater swimming pool, opened in May 1925 as the Natatorium. The Plunge building enclosing the pool was styled after the Spanish Renaissance architecture of San Diego&#x27;s Balboa Park structures. The changing rooms appear in the Tom Cruise film &quot;Top Gun&quot;. Celebrities who once swam at the Plunge include Esther Williams and Johnny Weissmuller. The roof of the building rolled open to make it both an indoor and outdoor pool. The Mission Beach Plunge (now using fresh water) and the Giant Dipper are the only remaining attractions left from Spreckels&#x27; original park; the other structures were razed in the late 1980s. The Plunge was saved from demolition after the Save Mission Beach Plunge Committee of residents put a measure to save the pool on the ballot, which was approved unanimously in 1987 by San Diego voters. The Plunge closed in 2014 because of disrepair. Plans to rebuild the Plunge were approved in January 2016. The pool reopened in July 2019.

=== Landfill ===
Also nearby, immediately east of SeaWorld, is an unlined landfill. From 1957 to 1962 large amounts of industrial waste, including millions of gallons of chromic, hydrofluoric, nitric, sulfuric, and hydrochloric acids, dichromate, cyanide, and carbon tetrachloride, were deposited into this landfill. No remediation efforts have occurred.

== Activities ==
Mission Beach offers opportunities to participate in sunbathing, horseshoes, surfing, bicycling, skateboarding, Frisbee tossing, and other outdoor activities. A local skating club, &quot;Skate This!,&quot; performs for free on weekends, executing trick skating and dancing on both rollerblades and traditional skates. It is a well known, popular location for engaging in sports, including beach volleyball and basketball, with courts available for both.

There is a public recreation center on Santa Clara Place on the bay side of Mission Beach. At the south end of Belmont Park is the Wave House Athletic Club, a full-service beachside fitness center, complete with cardio equipment, weights, fitness classes, aquatic classes in the Plunge, and beach Bootcamps.

Mission Beach includes Mariner&#x27;s Point, the original site of the over-the-line softball-on-the-beach tournament.

Thong bikinis are technically illegal on Mission Beach, but lifeguards and local police do not typically enforce the ban on such swimwear. The consumption of alcoholic beverages on the beach is illegal as of April 2008. Nudity is not allowed.

Many beachgoers are local college and university students, but both tourists and permanent residents of the beach and other areas are also frequent visitors to the beach. Weekly and monthly rentals are available during the summer months.

<text>Marta Sahagún (; born Marta María Sahagún Jiménez (10 April 1953) served as the First Lady of Mexico from 2 July 2001, when she married President Vicente Fox, until he left office on 30 November 2006. Her tenure was marked by her outspoken views and active role in her husband&#x27;s administration, in contrast to previous First Ladies of Mexico, as well as several controversies regarding her nonprofit Vamos México foundation and her family&#x27;s business dealings.

== Early life and teaching ==
Sahagún was born in Zamora, Michoacán, the second of six children, to Dr. Alberto Sahagún de la Parra, who founded Zamora’s San José Hospital and a nursing school, and Ana Teresa Jiménez Vargas. For some years she worked as an English teacher at the Universidad Lasallista Benavente. Her first marriage was to veterinarian Manuel Bribiesca Godoy, with whom she ran a veterinary wholesale supplies business in Celaya, Guanajuato. They had three children: Manuel, Jorge Alberto and Fernando. They separated in 1998 and divorced in 2000.

==Political career==
Sahagún has been an active member of the National Action Party since 1988. She unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Celaya and met Vicente Fox, who named her as his spokeswoman for his government in Guanajuato. Sahagún continued to serve as his press secretary during his successful presidential campaign and for his first year in office. Sahagún married Fox in 2001.

In September 2001, Sahagún created the Vamos México (Let’s Go Mexico) foundation, which allocates funds to help marginalized people of the country and other organizations such as the Legion of Christ. Vamos México was inaugurated with a concert by Elton John in Chapultepec Castle, which drew criticism for using a national monument for a private function. The foundation came under national and international scrutiny after an investigation by The Financial Times found that less than half of the foundation&#x27;s donations went toward charitable efforts. &quot;The Financial Times&quot; criticized the foundation&#x27;s lack of transparency in the management of its resources, the source of its donations and its high overhead costs, despite its access to presidential staff, resources and donated office space. The federal auditor also opened an investigation into whether the national lottery and the president&#x27;s office had improperly channeled public funds into the foundation. The lottery&#x27;s then-director, Laura Valdés, is the sister of a board member of Vamos México.

In response, Vamos México bought full-page ads in Mexican newspapers with a pie chart breakdown of its expenses, which added up to 103.26 percent.

Despite her popularity with the public, Sahagún was criticized by legislators and media for using her position as First Lady to set up a future run for the presidency. She was also criticized for her spending habits, including her publicly funded staff of 38, with the top 11 employees costing a total of $782,000 a year.

Despite admitting her interest in the presidency, Sahagún confirmed in 2004 that she would not become a candidate for president and would retire to her and her husband&#x27;s ranch, although she added, &quot;Mexico is ready to be governed by a woman.&quot;

== Controversies ==

=== Conflict with &quot;Proceso&quot; and Olga Wornat ===

In 2003, Argentine journalist Olga Wornat published &quot;La Jefa: Vida pública y privada de Marta Sahagún de Fox&quot; (&quot;The Chief: The Public and Private Life of Marta Sahagun de Fox&quot;), a book about Marta Sahagún and her sons. Federal deputy Ricardo Sheffield Padilla asked the federal government to investigate the claims of corruption raised by Wornat. In 2005, Wornat published a second book about Sahagún and her sons, &quot;Crónicas Malditas&quot; (&quot;Accursed Chronicles&quot;), which investigated the sources of their immense fortune. The Mexican magazine Proceso also published an article the same year about the dissolution of Sahagún&#x27;s first marriage (including claims of domestic violence against her then-husband) and about the &quot;suspicious&quot; businesses of Sahagún&#x27;s sons.

On May 3, 2005, Marta Sahagún filed a civil lawsuit before the Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Distrito Federal (Supreme Tribunal of Justice of the Federal District) against Wornat and &quot;Proceso&quot; for &quot;moral damages&quot; and breach of privacy. Sahagún’s son Manuel Bibriesca Sahagún filed a separate lawsuit against Wornat, who had received death threats since her books were published and had been placed under house arrest by a federal judge.

On November 27, 2005, &quot;Proceso&quot; published an article titled &quot;Amistades Peligrosas&quot; (&quot;Dangerous Friendships&quot;), wherein Raquenel Villanueva, a prominent lawyer for drug kingpins, said she had met Fernando Bribiesca Sahagún with her client Jaime Valdez Martínez in 2003. The Procuraduría General de la República considers Valdez a representative of drug cartel leader Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán.

=== The Bribiesca sons ===

Sahagún and her sons have been repeatedly accused of using her influence to promote their business interests. Partly as a result of the revelations of journalist Olga Wornat, the Mexican Chamber of Deputies launched investigations into the activities of Sahagun’s sons. In mid-2006, a commission of the Chamber of Deputies, chaired by Deputy Jesús González Schmal, allegedly found evidence that would prove multiple shady dealings in the affairs of Sahagun’s children and decided to raise a complaint with the Attorney General&#x27;s Office. Upon hearing the report, Sahagún held a press conference at the official residence of Los Pinos to harshly criticize the commission and González Schmal, claiming that it was lies and a publicity stunt against her.

Mexican journalist Anabel Hernández, in her books &quot;Fin de fiesta en Los Pinos&quot; (2006) and &quot;Narcoland&quot; (2012) contributed to increasing criticism of Sahagún and her sons by investigating the Bribiescas’ alleged influence peddling and their links to drug cartels.

Manuel and Jorge Bribiesca Sahagún reportedly played a key role in facilitating multimillion-dollar contracts with state-owned Pemex on behalf of Oceanografia, an oil services company that was later accused of defrauding Citigroup and Banamex of at least $400 million.

In 2012, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an arrest warrant for Manuel Bribiesca on charges of fraud in relation to the Oceanografia case.

<text>H. James Palmer (August 26, 1851 – December 22, 1939) was the 11th premier of Prince Edward Island and the son of former colonial Premier Edward Palmer.

Born in Charlottetown, Palmer was educated at Prince of Wales College and then at King&#x27;s College in Windsor, Nova Scotia.

He was called to the bar in 1876 and became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1878. Palmer entered the provincial legislature as a Liberal upon winning a seat in the election of 1900. He served as Attorney-General at various times except between 1904 and 1908 when he was out of office. In May 1911 he became premier when Francis Longworth Haszard was appointed to the Supreme Court of the province. At the time, members of the legislature who became Premier were required to resign their seats and run for re-election in a by-election. Palmer did so but was defeated in the December by-election. He resigned as premier and returned to his law practice. The loss of Palmer&#x27;s seat also caused the Liberal government to lose their majority in the legislature and the lieutenant governor asked the leader of the opposition, John A. Mathieson, to form a new government.

<text>The Sri Lanka hanging parrot (Loriculus beryllinus) is a small parrot which is a resident endemic breeder in Sri Lanka.

==Description==
The Sri Lanka hanging parrot is a small hanging parrot that is 13 cm long with a short tail. The adult has a red crown and rump. The nape and back have on orange tint. The chin and throat are pale blue. The beak is red and the irises are white.

Immature birds lack the orange hue to the back, have a duller rump, and have only a hint of orange on the crown. They have a faint blue throat. They have orange beaks and brown irises.

==Behaviour==
Sri Lanka hanging parrot is less gregarious than some of its relatives, and is usually alone or in small groups outside the breeding season. Its flight is swift and direct, and the call is a sharp whistled &quot;twiwittwit..twitwitwit&quot;. It undergoes local movements, driven mainly by the availability of the fruit, seeds, buds and blossoms that make up its diet.

Sri Lanka hanging parrot is a bird of open forest. It is strictly arboreal, never descending to the ground. It nests in holes in trees, laying 2–3 eggs.Females are involved in building the nest while males mostly remain close, observing the females.Breeding season includes the first part of the year and sometimes July-september.

==In culture==
In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as &quot;Gira Maliththa&quot; - ගිරාමලිත්තා or &quot;Pol Girwa&quot; - පොල් ගිරවා in Sinhala language. The hanging parrot appears in a 15 cent Sri Lankan postage stamp. This bird also appears on the 1000 Sri Lankan rupee bank note (2010 series).

<doc id="599724" wikidata="Q2277355" url="?curid=599724" title="Thomas Pitt">
<text>Thomas Pitt (5 July 1653 – 28 April 1726) was an English merchant, colonial administrator and politician who served as the president of Fort St. George from 1698 to 1709. Born in Blandford Forum, Dorset, he eventually went to the Indian subcontinent in the service of the English East India Company (EIC) and rose to a senior position in the Presidency of Fort St. George, administering the EIC&#x27;s affairs within the region. After a lucrative career in India, Pitt returned to England and entered into a political career, being elected six times to the Parliament of Great Britain. His descendants would go on to found a political dynasty, with Pitt&#x27;s grandson and great-grandson both serving as Prime Minister of Great Britain. 

==Early life==
Pitt was born at Blandford Forum, Dorset, the second son of Rev. John Pitt (1610–1672), Rector of Blandford St Mary (whose mural monument survives in that church), by his wife Sarah Jay. His second cousin was the poet Rev. Christopher Pitt (1699–1748) whose mural monument survives in the church of St Peter and St Paul, Blandford Forum, displaying the arms of Pitt: &quot;Sable, a fesse chequy argent and azure between three bezants&quot;. The earliest prominent ancestor of his family was John Pitt (died 1602) a mercer from Blandford Forum and Clerk of the Exchequer who received a grant of arms, from whose younger son, Thomas Pitt of Blandford (father of Rev. John Pitt), the Pitts of Boconnoc were descended. The eldest son of John Pitt (died 1602) was Sir William Pitt (1636), MP for Wareham, who founded the senior line of Pitt of Stratfield Saye in Hampshire, many of whose descendants served as an MP for Wareham and in 1776 acquired the title Baron Rivers.

==In the Mughal Empire==
In 1674, Pitt went to India with the East India Company, and soon began trading for himself as an &quot;interloper&quot; in defiance of the East India Company&#x27;s legal monopoly on Indian trade. Upon his return to England, he was fined £400 for his actions, although by that time he was already very wealthy and could easily afford the fine. He then proceeded to buy the manor of Stratford, Wiltshire and its surrounding borough of Old Sarum. With that acquisition he gained a seat in the House of Commons, as it was a rotten borough, although his first seat was as the member for Salisbury in the Convention Parliament of 1689. The purchase of Old Sarum would have a significant effect on English history, as the seat would pass to Pitt&#x27;s rather influential descendants. Pitt returned to India and eventually was hired by the East India Company.

In August 1698, Pitt arrived at Madras as the President of the East India Company and was entrusted to negotiate an end to the Child&#x27;s War with the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. In August 1699, he had been appointed as the Governor of Fort St. George and in the same year helped the Danes defeat Tanjore. In 1702, when the fort was besieged by Daud Khan of the Carnatic, the Mughal Empire&#x27;s local subedar (lieutenant), Pitt was instructed to seek peace. He later bought out some of the Carnatic region. He began garrisoning East India Company forts by raising regiments of local sepoys by hiring from Hindu warrior castes, arming them with the latest weapons and deploying them under the command of English officers to save Madras, his base of operations, from further Mughal harassment.

== President of Madras ==

Pitt became the President of Madras on 7 July 1698 and remained in his post till 1709.

In 1698, a new company called &quot;English Company Trading to the East Indies&quot; was floated by English merchants with Whiggish affiliations with a capital of £2 million. In August 1699, one John Pitt arrived at Madras and claimed that he had been appointed as the Governor of Fort St George by the new Company on behalf of the Stuarts. However, the Government in England passed an order that the authorities were to receive orders from no-one save those appointed by King William III.

On 4 December 1700, the Government of Fort St George banned cock-fighting and other traditional games, regarding it as the foremost reason for the poverty of the inhabitants of Madras.

Pitt&#x27;s term of office is known as the &#x27;Golden Age of Madras&#x27;. He fortified the walls of Black Town and organised an accurate survey of the city. Pitt is best known for the acquisition of the &quot;Five New Towns&quot;: Tiruvatiyoor, Kathiwakam, Nungambakkam, Vyasarpady and Sathangadu.

== Later career ==
In need of money after making gifts to his family, he gave up his seat in parliament in 1716 in favour of the position of governor of Jamaica. However, his finances were restored by the sale of a large diamond (later known as the Regent Diamond) and he resigned the position the following year without ever going there. He was soon re-elected to parliament to represent Thirsk, and thereafter Old Sarum for the last time, finally quitting parliament in 1726.

==Marriage and children==
On 1 January 1679/80 Pitt married Jane Innes, a daughter of James Innes of Reid Hall, Moray, by his wife Sarah Vincent. Jane was a niece of Matthias Vincent, one of Pitt&#x27;s business associates. By his wife he had at least four sons and two daughters, including:
*Robert Pitt (1680–1727), of Boconnoc, eldest son, the father of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham (1708–1778) (&quot;Pitt the Elder&quot;), Prime Minister of Great Britain, the father of William Pitt the Younger (1759–1806), also Prime Minister.
*Thomas Pitt, 1st Earl of Londonderry (c. 1688 – 1729), 2nd son, a twin with his fractionally younger brother William, based on an entry to the baptismal records of St Lawrence, Stratford-sub-Castle, Wiltshire.
*William Pitt, 3rd son, a twin who probably died in infancy.
*Col. John Pitt (1698–1754), 4th son, a distinguished soldier.
*Essex Pitt, eldest daughter, who married Charles Cholmondeley (1684–1759).
*Lucy Pitt, 2nd daughter, who married James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope, a soldier and statesmen who served as chief minister during the early years of the reign of King George I.

==Pitt&#x27;s diamond==
Pitt purchased a uncut diamond from an Indian merchant named Jamchand in Madras in 1701. According to legend, the diamond had been originally found by an enslaved man in the Kollur Mine near the Krishna River and was concealed by the slave in a leg wound, which he suffered while fleeing the siege of Golconda. The slave then made to the Indian coast, where he met an English sea captain and offered him 50% of all profits made on the sale of the diamond in exchange for safe passage out of India. However, the sea captain killed the slave and sold the diamond to Jamchand.

Pitt bought the diamond for 48,000 pagodas or £20,400, and sent it back to England in 1702 concealed inside his eldest son Robert&#x27;s shoe. For two years from 1704–1706, the jeweller Harris laboured in London to hew a cushion brilliant from the rough stone. Several secondary stones were produced from the cut that were sold to Tsar Peter the Great of Russia. After many attempts to sell it to various European royals, including Louis XIV of France, Pitt and his sons went with the diamond to Calais in 1717. With John Law acting as agent, it was sold that year to the French regent, Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, for £135,000, becoming one of the crown jewels of France. Today, &quot;Le Régent&quot;, as it came to be known, remains in the French Royal Treasury at the Louvre, where it has been on display since 1887.

Pitt owned a piece of land called a copyhold, and the lord of this land was entitled to Pitt&#x27;s most valuable possession after his death. If he had not sold the diamond, it would have been confiscated as a heriot, a form of death duty.

His association with the jewel earned him the nickname &quot;Diamond&quot; Pitt.

==Properties==
Pitt took a lease in 1686 on Mawarden (or Marwarden) Court, at Stratford-sub-Castle north of Salisbury, and bought lands in the area which were within Old Sarum borough. His descendants would continue as lessees until 1805. A bold inscription on the tower of St Lawrence&#x27;s church, next to the house, records that he paid for the tower to be rebuilt in 1711; and he also provided furnishings and plate for the church.
With the money received in 1717 for his famous diamond, he began to consolidate his properties. Besides Mawarden Court and the Down at Blandford, he acquired Boconnoc in Cornwall from Lord Mohun&#x27;s widow in 1717, and subsequently Kynaston in Dorset, Bradock, Treskillard and Brannell in Cornwall, Woodyates on the border of Dorset and Wiltshire, Abbot&#x27;s Ann in Hampshire (where he rebuilt the church) and, subsequently his favourite residence, Swallowfield Park in Berkshire, where he died in 1726.

<text>Carole Bayer Sager (born Carol Bayer on March 8, 1944) is an American lyricist, singer, songwriter, and painter.

==Early life and career==
Carole Bayer was born in New York City, to Anita Nathan Bayer and Eli Bayer. Her family was Jewish. She graduated from New York University, where she majored in English, dramatic arts, and speech. She had already written her first pop hit, &quot;A Groovy Kind of Love&quot;, with Toni Wine, while still a student at New York City&#x27;s High School of Music and Art. It was recorded by the British invasion band The Mindbenders, whose version was a worldwide hit, reaching number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This song was later recorded by Sonny &amp; Cher, Petula Clark, and Phil Collins, whose rendition for the film &quot;Buster&quot; reached number one on both the UK Singles Chart and &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1988.

==Solo albums==
Bayer Sager&#x27;s first recording as a singer was the 1977 album &quot;Carole Bayer Sager&quot;, produced by Brooks Arthur. It included the hit single &quot;You&#x27;re Moving Out Today&quot;, a song which she co-wrote with Bette Midler and Bruce Roberts. The single became a 1977 Australian number one single and also reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart in June 1977. Paul Buckmaster provided horn and string arrangements for the album. The album also included Bayer Sager&#x27;s versions of two songs previously recorded by Melissa Manchester – &quot;Home to Myself&quot; and the oft-covered &quot;Come in from the Rain&quot;. It went platinum in Japan and Australia.

It was followed by &quot;...Too&quot; in 1978, also produced by Brooks Arthur, which included all-star cameos by the likes of Michael McDonald, Alice Cooper and Manchester. It also included the first recording of &quot;It&#x27;s the Falling in Love&quot; which subsequently would be covered by Michael Jackson on his 1979 multi-platinum album &quot;Off the Wall&quot;.

In 1981, she recorded &quot;Sometimes Late at Night&quot;, which was co-produced by future husband Burt Bacharach with Brooks Arthur, and included the single &quot;Stronger Than Before&quot;, later recorded by Chaka Khan and Dionne Warwick. The song became Bayer Sager&#x27;s only song to hit Billboard&#x27;s American Top 40 as a performer, peaking at number 30. The track &quot;Just Friends&quot; featured a vocal cameo from Michael Jackson, who also co-produced the track with Bacharach, while Neil Diamond also co-produced and played guitar on the track &quot;On The Way To The Sky&quot; which he also recorded as the title track of his concurrent album &quot;On the Way to the Sky&quot;.

==Songwriting==
Bayer Sager had many hits during the 1970s. She co-wrote many songs with Melissa Manchester that appeared on Manchester&#x27;s solo albums of the period, including &quot;Come in from the Rain&quot; and &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;, which would go on to be covered by many other artists. She also worked with Australian songwriter Peter Allen, crafting hits such as &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Leave While I&#x27;m in Love&quot; &quot;You and Me (We Wanted It All)&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Out Loud&quot;. She also scored major hits collaborating with Albert Hammond (&quot;When I Need You&quot;) and Bruce Roberts (&quot;You&#x27;re the Only One&quot;).

With Marvin Hamlisch and Neil Simon, she wrote the lyrics for the 1978 stage musical &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot;, which was loosely based on her relationship with Hamlisch. The musical ran for over three years on Broadway. She also wrote the lyrics, whilst Hamlisch composed the music, for &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot;, the Bond theme sung by Carly Simon in the film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977).

Many of Bayer Sager&#x27;s 1980s songs were co-written with her husband at the time, composer Burt Bacharach. She executive-produced the eponymous solo album for June Pointer, of The Pointer Sisters, in 1989.
Bayer Sager has won an Academy Award (out of six nominations), a Grammy Award (out of nine nominations) and two Golden Globe Awards (out of seven nominations). She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987. Bayer Sager won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1982 for &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Theme (Best That You Can Do)&quot;, theme song to the romantic comedy &quot;Arthur&quot;.

Bayer Sager received the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1987 for the song &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;, which she co-wrote with Bacharach. This song was originally written for the 1982 film &quot;Night Shift&quot;, for which it was recorded by Rod Stewart. The song was popularized in a 1986 cover version by Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight and Elton John.

Her song with David Foster, &quot;The Prayer&quot;, originally recorded by Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli, won the Golden Globe, and is often performed at weddings and funerals.

She was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Bayer Sager received the New York University Steinhardt Distinguished Alumni award in 2006. She received the 2019 &quot;Johnny Mercer Award&quot; from the Songwriters Hall of Fame during their 50th-anniversary induction ceremony. She was the sixth female songwriter to ever be awarded this honor.

She occasionally collaborated with Neil Sedaka, with 11 songs co-written between the two.

Alongside Bruce Roberts and Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds, Bayer Sager co-wrote &quot;Stronger Together&quot;, sung by Jessica Sanchez. The song was played after Hillary Clinton&#x27;s speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. The song is named after the slogan that the Clinton campaign used as a show of uniting behind the Democratic nominee.

In 2018, she co-wrote the song &quot;Living in the Moment&quot; for the film &quot;Book Club&quot;, recorded by Katharine McPhee, as well as two songs on Barbra Streisand&#x27;s album &quot;Walls&quot;: &quot;Better Angels&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s on My Mind&quot;. She contributed lyrics to &quot;Ghost Town&quot; on Kanye West&#x27;s album &quot;Ye&quot;.

In April 2020, Lady Gaga closed out her &quot;One World: Together at Home&quot; concert with a new rendition of &quot;The Prayer&quot;, co-performed with Dion, Bocelli, John Legend and classical pianist Lang Lang. The performance helped raise $127 million for the World Health Organization battling COVID-19 cases in America.

In May 2022, she was honored with a BMI Icon award at the 70th Annual BMI Pop Awards 

==Visual art==
Sager is an accomplished visual artist whose work includes large-scale photorealistic paintings.

==Personal life==
She married record-producer Andrew Sager in 1970, and they divorced in 1978. Bayer Sager was involved in a romantic relationship with composer Marvin Hamlisch in the late 1970s. On April 3, 1982, she married composer and pianist Burt Bacharach after over a year&#x27;s cohabitation. In December 1985 the couple adopted an infant son, whom they named Cristopher Elton Bacharach. Bacharach and Sager divorced in 1991.

Since June 1996, Bayer Sager has been married to Robert Daly, former chairman of Warner Brothers and former chairman / CEO of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, and currently chairman of the American Film Institute (AFI). They live in Los Angeles.

In October 2016, Bayer Sager published her memoir, &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song: A Memoir&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster). She also narrated the audiobook version.

<text>The vernal hanging parrot (Loriculus vernalis) is a small parrot which is a resident breeder in the Indian subcontinent and some other areas of Southeast Asia. It undergoes local movements, driven mainly by the availability of the fruit, seeds, buds and blossoms that make up its diet. They frequent the banyan tree for the fruit and plantain trees for the nectar from the flowers.

This is a small, mainly green hanging parrot, only 14 cm long with a short tail. The adult male has a red rump and bill, and blue throat patch. The female has a green patch. Vernal hanging parrot is a bird of dry jungle and cultivation. It nests in holes in trees, laying 2-4 white eggs. Immature birds have a duller rump, and lack the throat patch. Vernal hanging parrot is less gregarious than some of its relatives, and is usually in small groups outside the breeding season. Its flight is swift and direct, and the call is a raucous chattering.

In Sri Lanka, it is replaced by the very similar endemic Sri Lanka hanging parrot, (&quot;L. beryllinus&quot;).

==Breeding==
Vernal hanging parrots nest in tree cavities. The nests are lined with fragments of leaves. There are usually three eggs in a clutch. The eggs are white in color. The female incubates the eggs for 20 days and the chicks leave the nest about 33 days from hatching.

<text>The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC; , CRSNG) is the major federal agency responsible for funding natural sciences and engineering research in Canada. NSERC directly funds university professors and students as well as Canadian companies to perform research and training. With funding from the Government of Canada, NSERC supports the research of over 41,000 students, trainees and professors at universities and colleges in Canada with an annual budget of CA$1.1 billion in 2015. Its current director is Alejandro Adem.

NSERC, combined with the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), forms the major source of federal government funding to post-secondary research. These bodies are sometimes collectively referred to as the &quot;Tri-Council&quot; or &quot;Tri-Agency&quot;.

==History==
NSERC came into existence on 1 May 1978 under the &quot;Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Act&quot;, which was passed in an omnibus manner by the government of Pierre Elliot Trudeau. University-based research had previously been supported through the National Research Council of Canada. It reports to Parliament through the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. It is governed by a Council composed of its president and up to 18 members appointed from the private and public sectors and an executive team of eight persons. 

=== President ===
Past presidents include Gordon M. MacNabb (1978-1986), Arthur W. May (1986-1990), Peter Morand (1990-1995), Tom Brzustowski (1995-2005), Suzanne Fortier (2006-2013), and B. Mario Pinto (2014-2018). On 25 June 2019, Alejandro Adem was appointed President of NSERC, effective October 1, 2019.

==Grants and awards==

===Professors===
NSERC offers research funding for programs and projects covering every discipline of the sciences and engineering. In 1989, NSERC started a Chairs for Women in Science and Engineering (CWSE) program, with Dr. Monique Frize selected as the first Chair. In 1996, the program was restructured to support one Chair in each of the following five regions: Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, Prairies, and British Columbia/Yukon and in 2006 a CWSE National Network was created, which facilitates collaborations among the sitting Chairs. The NSERC Chair for Women in Science and Engineering for the B.C./Yukon region operates under the name Westcoast Women in Engineering, Science, and Technology (WWEST). Past CWSE Chairs include Dr. Elizabeth Cannon (1997), Dr. Claire Deschênes (1997), Dr. Monique Frize (1997), Dr. Maria Klawe (1997), Dr. Florence-Mary Williams (1997), Dr. Anne Condon (2002), Dr. Valerie Davidson (2002), Dr. Cecilia Moloney (2002), Dr. Julita Vassileva (2004), Dr. Nadia Ghazzali (2006), Dr. Elizabeth Croft (2010), Dr. Annemieke Farenhorst (2011), Dr. Catherine Mavriplis (2011), and Dr. Lesley Shannon (2015). As of 2023, the current regional CWSE Chairs are Dr. Tamara Franz-Odendaal (Atlantic), Dr. Eve Langelier (Quebec), Dr. Shohini Ghose (Ontario), Dr. Laleh Behjat (Prairies), and Dr. Jennifer Jakobi (B.C./Yukon).

NSERC&#x27;s newest program, launched in 2023, is Chair for Inclusion in Science and Engineering (CISE). Beginning in Atlantic Canada, the current A-CISE co-chairs are Dr. Svetlana Barkanova, a physicist with Grenfell Campus, Memorial University, Dr. Stephanie MacQuarrie, Professor of Organic Chemistry Cape Breton University, and physicist Dr. Kevin Hewitt of Dalhousie University. These Atlantic Chairs &quot;aim to reach a broad range of underrepresented groups, including women and gender minorities, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities, racialized groups and members of LGBTQ communities, with a particular focus on First Nations and French communities, African Nova Scotians and remote and rural areas.&quot;

===Students and fellows===
NSERC provides awards, scholarships, and fellowships to graduate and undergraduate students for scientific research.

===Partnership programs===
NSERC has Research Partnerships Programs to help foster collaborations between university researchers, colleges and other sectors (including government and industry) to develop new knowledge and expertise, transfer it to Canadian-based organizations and meet the objectives of the Government of Canada’s Science &amp; Technology Strategy on innovation.

In February 2021, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that NSERC partnered with Huawei in which the company contributed over CAN $4.8 million in funding for research.

NSERC is also a sponsor of Women in Science and Engineering Atlantic Region (WISEatlantic) &quot;primarily engaged in inspiring youth to consider science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) careers and making them aware of the diversity that exists within these fields&quot; and Women in Science and Engineering Newfoundland and Labrador (WISE NL).

<doc id="599738" wikidata="Q851478" url="?curid=599738" title="Rubber duck">
<text>A rubber duck or a rubber duckie is a toy shaped like a duck, that is usually yellow with a flat base. It may be made of rubber or rubber-like material such as vinyl plastic. Rubber ducks were invented in the late 19th century when it became possible to more easily shape rubber, and are believed to improve developmental skills in children during water play.

The yellow rubber duck has achieved an iconic status in Western pop culture and is often symbolically linked to bathing. Various novelty variations of the toy are produced, and many organisations use yellow rubber ducks in rubber duck races for fundraising worldwide.

==History==
The history of the rubber duck is linked to the emergence of rubber manufacturing in the late 19th century. The earliest rubber ducks were made from harder rubber when manufacturers began using Charles Goodyear&#x27;s invention, vulcanized rubber. Consequently, these solid rubber ducks were not capable of floating and were instead intended as chew toys.

Sculptor Peter Ganine created a sculpture of a duck in the 1940s. He then patented it and reproduced it as a floating toy, of which over 50 million were sold.

Besides the ubiquitous yellow rubber duck with which most people are familiar, there have been numerous novelty variations on the basic theme, including character ducks representing professions, politicians, or celebrities, a concept introduced by Mark Boldt&#x27;s Rubba Ducks. There are also ducks that glow in the dark, quack, change color, have interior LED illumination, or include a wind-up mechanism that enables them to &quot;swim&quot;. In 2001, &quot;The Sun&quot;, a British tabloid reported that Queen Elizabeth II had a rubber duck in her bathroom that wore an inflatable crown. The duck was spotted by a workman who was repainting her bathroom. The story prompted sales of rubber ducks in the United Kingdom to increase by 80% for a short period.

Rubber ducks are collected by enthusiasts. The 2011 Guinness World Record for World&#x27;s Largest Rubber Duck Collection stood at 5,631 different rubber ducks, and was awarded to Charlotte Lee. In 2013, the rubber duck was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame, a museum in Rochester, New York, along with the game of chess. Toys are selected based on factors like icon-status, longevity, and innovation.

== In popular culture ==

Ernie, a popular Muppet from the television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, has performed the song &quot;Rubber Duckie&quot; multiple times since the series began. Ernie frequently spoke to his duck and carried it with him in other segments of the show. On a special occasion, Little Richard performed the song.

C. W. McCall&#x27;s hit song &quot;Convoy&quot; (and the movie and novel it inspired) are narrated from the viewpoint of a character who replaced the bulldog hood ornament on his Mack truck with a bathtub toy and used the on-air handle of &quot;Rubber Duck&quot;.

The Akron RubberDucks minor league baseball team, formerly known as the &quot;Aeros&quot;, officially adopted the nickname on October 29, 2013. The nickname pays tribute to the city&#x27;s history in the rubber industry, particularly as the birthplace of companies such as Goodyear, Firestone, B.F. Goodrich, and General Tire.

===Protest symbol===
Rubber ducks have also become a protest symbol simultaneously in Belgrade, Brazil, and Moscow in 2017, and in Bangkok in 2020.

===World&#x27;s largest rubber duck===
The world&#x27;s largest rubber duck was created by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman in 2007, measuring and weighing about . Since 2007, several ducks of various sizes created by Hofman have been on display in countries and territories such as Amsterdam, Netherlands; Lommel, Belgium; Osaka, Japan; Sydney, Australia; São Paulo, Brazil; Hong Kong, China; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and Seoul, Korea; until 14 November 2014, and went on display in the United States after 20 October 2013.

In 2013, China&#x27;s &quot;Great Firewall&quot; blocked searches for &quot;big yellow duck&quot; because Chinese activists were photo-shopping the &quot;Rubber Duck&quot; sculpture into the Tank Man photo of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. If the term &quot;Big Yellow Duck&quot; were searched, a message appeared stating that according to relevant laws, statutes, and policies, the results of the search could not be shown.

=== Races ===

Rubber duck races, also known as derby duck races, have been used as a method of fundraising for organizations worldwide. People donate money to the organization by sponsoring a duck. At the end of the fundraising drive, all of the ducks are dumped into a waterway, with the first to float past the finish line winning a prize for its sponsor.

==Scientific studies==
===Oceanography===

During a Pacific storm on 10 January 1992, three 40-foot (12 m) containers holding 28,800 Friendly Floatees plastic bathtub toys from a Chinese factory were washed off a ship, containing 7,200 each of blue turtles, yellow ducks, red beavers, and green frogs. Two-thirds of the toys floated south and landed three months later on the shores of Indonesia, Australia, and South America. The remaining 10,000 toys headed north to Alaska and then completed a full circle back near Japan, caught up in the same North Pacific Gyre current as the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Many of the toys then entered the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia and were trapped in the Arctic ice. They moved through the ice at a rate of one mile (1.6 km) per day, and in 2000 they were sighted in the North Atlantic. The movement of the toys had been monitored by American oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer. Bleached by sun and seawater, the ducks and beavers had faded to white, but the turtles and frogs had kept their original colors.

Between July and December 2003, The First Years Inc. offered a $100 US savings bond reward to anybody who recovered a Floatee in New England, Canada or Iceland. More of the toys were recovered in 2004 than in any of the preceding three years. However, still more of these toys were predicted to have headed eastward past Greenland and make landfall on the southwestern shores of the United Kingdom in 2007.

These toys were the subject of Donovan Hohn&#x27;s 2011 book &quot;Moby-Duck: The True Story of 28,800 Bath Toys Lost at Sea&quot;.

===Glacial melting===

In August 2008, NASA&#x27;S Jet Propulsion Laboratory undertook studies of Greenland&#x27;s Jacobshavn Isbræ to determine how interior glacial meltflow during the summer influenced its movement. A sophisticated football-sized probe that had a GPS device, pressure sensor, thermometer and accelerometer was lowered by rope into one of the glacier&#x27;s moulins. The probe&#x27;s equipment was designed to find structures such as waterfalls inside the ice. Unfortunately the probe went silent, so ninety rubber ducks marked in English, Danish, and Inuit with the text &quot;science experiment&quot; and &quot;reward&quot;, along with an email address to contact if found, were also put into the moulins and it was hoped that the ducks would eventually exit and be found by hunters or fishermen around Baffin Bay. As of 2012, none of the ducks were found or returned, possibly due to being trapped in large aquifers later discovered inside the ice.

===Germ study===

A 2019 article in the scientific journal &quot;Environmental Science: Water Research &amp; Technology&quot; details how rubber ducks were used to expand knowledge on how potable water interacts with flexible plastic materials in relation to microbial and nutrient contamination. Particularly how these microbes could affect potentially vulnerable end users. The bathroom, despite being the place for the family to bathe and become clean, is surprisingly good at creating the perfect conditions for microbial growth and so the researchers wished to see if these soft plastic toys could potentially pose a risk. They determined that, although some bacteria and microbes can be absorbed into the toys, only under specific laboratory conditions did they become dangerous to human beings and so are largely safe.

<text>Refused (also known as the Refused) is a Swedish hardcore punk band originating from Umeå and formed in 1991. Refused is composed of vocalist Dennis Lyxzén, guitarist Kristofer Steen, drummer David Sandström, and bassist Magnus Flagge. Guitarist Jon Brännström was a member from 1994, through reunions, until he was fired in late-2014. Their lyrics are often of a non-conformist and politically far-left nature and were for a time associated with the straight edge subculture.

The band released their debut album &quot;This Just Might Be... the Truth&quot; in 1994. They followed this up with &quot;Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent&quot; (1996) and five EPs. In 1998, the band released &quot;The Shape of Punk to Come&quot;, which expanded their sound with jazz and electronic influences, but was initially poorly received commercially and critically. The group shortly after disbanded during their subsequent tour. Despite limited contemporary success, Refused were influential on the development of rock music in subsequent decades.

In 2012, the band reformed and commenced a reunion tour, and later released further albums &quot;Freedom&quot; (2015) and &quot;War Music&quot; (2019).

==History==
===Early years (1991–1997)===

Refused formed in early 1991 with Dennis Lyxzén (former frontman of the straight edge band Step Forward) on vocals, David Sandström on drums, Pär Hansson on guitar, and Jonas Lindgren on bass. They formed with the aim of playing outside of their hometown and releasing a 7&quot; record (the latter which never happened). They released their first demo, &quot;Refused&quot;, the same year. With an already altered lineup (including Kristofer Steen joining from local band Abhinanda with Pär Hansson going the other way) the band released their first studio album, &quot;This Just Might Be... the Truth&quot;, in 1994. A month later, they released the &quot;Everlasting&quot; EP.

Refused&#x27;s final line-up consisted of Dennis Lyxzén, David Sandström, Kristofer Steen, and Jon Brännström, but the band never found a permanent bass player, switching up to 12 bassists until their original break-up. In June 1996, they released &quot;Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent&quot; through Victory Records. The album had a style that steered towards the metallic hardcore genre and included a fanzine explaining their political ideas. For this record, they toured with Snapcase. Later on, they did it in support of Millencolin in the United States and with Mindjive in Europe.

===&quot;The Shape of Punk to Come&quot; and disbandment (1998)===
Their third album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Shape of Punk to Come&quot;, incorporated diverse sounds outside of the strict hardcore realm, such as electronica, jazz, and ambient. Initially, the album was both a commercial and critical failure, with little media coverage and mixed reception from fans and critics alike; some even refused to rate it because of its stylistic divergence.

The United States tour to support the album was cancelled halfway. They were joined by Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Frodus and only completed eight shows in half-empty basements and coffeehouses, finishing in a chaotic performance in a basement of Harrisonburg, Virginia that, after four songs, was shut down by police. They described these concerts as &quot;emotionally devastating&quot; and &quot;an awful experience&quot;, which finally led to their break-up after a rough internal fight in Atlanta, Georgia. Other factors to their disbandment were a depletion of creative energy and band members wanting different things. There was also conflict between Dennis and the rest of the band.

Refused announced their demise through a strongly-worded open letter titled &quot;Refused Are Fucking Dead&quot; on their label Burning Heart&#x27;s website.

===After breakup (1999–2009)===
The story of Refused&#x27;s last show soon became popular, as well as &quot;The Shape of Punk to Come&quot;. A year after its release, the album shot up from 1,400 to 21,000 units sold in the United States. In 2000, it went up to 28,000. From then on, many notable artists started to praise the band and newcomers cited them as an influence.

Lead singer Dennis Lyxzén went on to form The (International) Noise Conspiracy soon thereafter, while the other members, as well as venturing into their own projects, formed the group TEXT.

In 2007 Lyxzén and Sandström briefly reformed their Refused side project, Final Exit, which existed in the mid-late 1990s and originally consisted of members of Refused and Abhinanda, with each member taking a different role to that which they had in their main bands (e.g., David on vocals and Dennis on bass guitar).

As of May 2008, Dennis Lyxzén and David Sandström formed a new straightforward hardcore band under the name AC4.

Kristofer Steen moved to Orange County, California and attended film school there. He made a documentary on the band&#x27;s last year in existence called &quot;Refused Are Fucking Dead&quot;, which was released in 2006. Then, he began working on operas in Sweden.

===Rumours (2010–2011)===
In March 2010, Epitaph Records put up the old Refused website online with the words &quot;Coming Soon.&quot; Rumours spread across the Internet about what the new website could indicate, including speculation of a reunion. Citing an anonymous source &quot;close to the situation,&quot; &quot;Punknews.org&quot; unofficially announced that the band would perform at European music festivals in 2010. Dennis Lyxzén denied claims of a Refused reformation as he and David Sandström were busy with AC4. The new band website was later announced to be a promotional site for a reissue of Refused&#x27;s final album, &quot;The Shape of Punk to Come&quot;. The reissue, released on 8 June 2010, is a three-disc set with an unreleased live album recorded in 1998 and the &quot;Refused Are Fucking Dead&quot; DVD documentary in addition to the full original album.

In November 2011, multiple posters said to be for the upcoming 2012 Coachella Festival appeared on several Internet sites, and the line-ups included Refused. This started new rumours of a long-awaited reunion.

=== Reunions, Brännström&#x27;s firing and &quot;Freedom&quot; (2012–2017) ===
During BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Punk Show&quot; on 2 January 2012, Mike Davies stated that Refused, along with At the Drive-In would be reforming in 2012. On 9 January 2012, Refused announced a reunion to perform at the 2012 Coachella Festival. This was controversial because of the band&#x27;s original explicit declaration to never reunite.

On 29 February, Refused played a secret show in Umeå, their first live performance since 1998. Refused played numerous European festivals on the Reunion Tour, including Way Out West in Gothenburg, Primavera Sound in Barcelona and Download Festival in England. They appeared for the first time on TV in America on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; on 18 July 2012 and toured Australia for the first time in November. Refused ended their reunion on 15 December 2012 with a hometown show in Umeå.

On 22 February 2013, Refused were awarded the &quot;Special Prize for Music Exports&quot; by the Swedish Minister of Trade. Lyxzén and Sandström chose to criticize Sweden&#x27;s current government at the ceremony, instead thanking the efforts of popular education, in particular Workers&#x27; Educational Association (ABF) and youth centers (in Sweden associated with social democracy) while Jon Brännström chose to not accept the prize on his behalf later stating he wished they &quot;[...] had said no to the prize and instead held a press conference about why we had turned it down&quot;.

On 31 October 2014, Jon Brännström wrote on Refused&#x27;s Facebook page that he was fired from the band and no longer considered them friends. The band responded by stating that they fired him in 2013 &quot;because he did not share our passion for the band.&quot; 

On 25 November 2014, the band announced that they would perform their first shows in three years at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, Groezrock and Amnesia Rockfest in the summer of 2015. They also headlined Punk Rock Bowling in Las Vegas in May 2015. Around the same time, rumours surfaced of a new album being recorded for release in 2015 after ...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead&#x27;s Autrey Fulbright II posted a photo on Instagram claiming that Lyxzén had been in the studio recording vocals for the album.

On 27 April 2015, Refused announced their fourth studio album, &quot;Freedom&quot;, to be released in June 2015 via Epitaph Records. The album was produced primarily by Nick Launay and featured two songs produced by Shellback. The opening track &quot;Elektra&quot; was released as the lead single.

On 20 November 2017, members of Refused revealed on social media that the band has been in the studio working on their next album.

===&quot;Servants of Death&quot;, &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot; and &quot;War Music&quot; (2018-present)===
In May 2018, the band released the &quot;Servants of Death&quot; EP which contained a new song, a b-side and four live songs. It was originally released on vinyl in 2016 as part of Record Store Day.

On 2 July 2019, it was announced that Refused would be partnering with video game developer CD Projekt Red, creating and recording original music for then-upcoming video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;. The members of Refused provided music for a fictitious band in the in-game universe, punk rock group SAMURAI; which includes fictitious musician and terrorist Johnny Silverhand, portrayed and voiced by Keanu Reeves; while Lyxzén provided vocals on the music tracks for both Johnny and Kerry Eurodyne. The announcement was made alongside the release of &quot;Chippin&#x27; In&quot; on streaming services, the first single to be revealed for the project. 
On 23 August 2019, a new song called &quot;Never Fade Away&quot; came out.

On 2 August 2019, the band released &quot;Blood Red&quot; from their forthcoming album &quot;War Music&quot;. The album was released on October 18 of that year, followed by a UK tour alongside Thrice and Gouge Away. 

A five-track EP &quot;The Malignant Fire&quot; was released on 20 November 2020. It featured single &quot;Born on the Outs&quot;, three other new songs, as well as &quot;Malfire&quot; from &quot;War Music&quot;.

In March 2024, Refused announced their first show in four years, at the Rosendal Garden Party in Stockholm. It was advertised as &quot;their last festival performance in Sweden. Ever&quot;. However, it was cancelled the day before because frontman Dennis Lyxzén suffered a massive heart attack. On 10 September 2024, the band announced US dates for a 2025 farewell tour alongside a tribute album for &quot;The Shape of Punk to Come&quot;. 

==Musical style, lyrics, and influences==
Refused started as a &quot;fresh-faced positive hardcore band&quot; and their music became increasingly progressive and radical, as did their lyrics. The record &quot;This Just Might Be... the Truth&quot; was characterized for its &quot;massive hardcore sound&quot;, mostly influenced by various bands from the New York hardcore scene (such as Earth Crisis). On their follow-up,&quot; Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent&quot;, the band had a heavier, more intricate style, which is generally attributed to their Slayer inspiration, and Lyxzén adopted screaming vocals rather than shouting. With the third album, &quot;The Shape of Punk to Come&quot;, &quot;came the leap into the unknown&quot; as the band mixed their previous style with unorthodox chord progressions, sampling, &quot;ambient textures, jazz breakdowns&quot;, electronica and monologues, and other deviations from the hardcore punk music.

Refused&#x27;s lyrics focus on far-left politics, drawing on anarchism, socialism, among other ideologies. By the time of their first album, the band already had a strong anti-establishment profile. The group&#x27;s members were all vegan straight edge until their last show in 1998 and a couple of their songs dealt with these topics. Today, some of them no longer follow these lifestyles. In their live performances, vocalist Lyxzén usually delivers political speeches between songs. Before the Umeå hardcore phenomenon went into full bloom, the band was seen as part of the scene centered around youth-oriented venue Galaxen, along with the punk-rock scene as well as metal bands such as Meshuggah.

Refused have cited bands and artists as inflluences, including Fugazi, Slayer, Born Against, and ManLiftingBanner. Lyxzén has also cited Ian Svenonius&#x27;s projects (The Make-Up, The Nation of Ulysses and Cupid Car Club) as personal influences, while Sandström has drawn from Snapcase.

==Legacy==
Refused profoundly affected the development of rock music at the turn of the twenty-first century, despite the fact that very few people supported them when they were active. According to &quot;Vice&quot;, they &quot;stood at the nexus of modern punk, incorporating all of its subgenres into one scattered but neat package&quot;, putting &quot;the risk back into punk and hardcore by making it unexpected again.&quot; David Anthony of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described &quot;The Shape of Punk to Come&quot; as &quot;an undisputed classic that served as a rallying cry for bands longing to incorporate sounds from outside the walls of aggressive music.&quot; Author Gabriel Kuhn states that Refused &quot;became the flagship of a remarkably strong vegan straight edge movement that engulfed Sweden throughout the 1990s&quot; with &quot;witty manifestos&quot; and &quot;performances&quot; that &quot;challenged many of the scene&#x27;s standards&quot;.

Among the artists who cite Refused as an influence are Linkin Park, Duff McKagan of Velvet Revolver and Guns N&#x27; Roses, Sum 41, Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus of Blink-182, AFI, Papa Roach, Tim McIlrath of Rise Against, Underoath, Enter Shikari, the Used, Every Time I Die, Norma Jean, Showbread, La Dispute, Nick Hipa of As I Lay Dying, Derek E. Miller of Poison the Well and Sleigh Bells, Geoff Rickly of Thursday, United Nations and No Devotion, Marcos Curiel of P.O.D. and Daylight Division, Jeremy Bolm of Hesitation Wounds and Touché Amoré, Zachary Garren of Dance Gavin Dance and Strawberry Girls, Chris Teti of the World Is a Beautiful Place &amp; I Am No Longer Afraid to Die, the New Transit Direction, the Bloody Beetroots, Justin Beck of Glassjaw and Sons of Abraham, Robin Staps of the Ocean, the Bled, Thomas Williams of Stray from the Path, Brandon Kellum of American Standards, and Jonathan Boulet. The song &quot;H. Ledger&quot; from letlive.&#x27;s album &quot;Fake History&quot; is a &quot;homage&quot; to Refused because the band felt that they &quot;didn&#x27;t receive proper recognition until they were no longer active.&quot; British musician Frank Turner stated that &quot;The Shape of Punk to Come&quot; &quot;shaped my musical path as a musician for a long time&quot; and his group, Million Dead, took their name from a line in the Refused&#x27;s song &quot;The Apollo Programme was a Hoax&quot;. Pop punk band Paramore were inspired by the song &quot;Liberation Frequency&quot; and quoted a line of it on their 2007 song &quot;Born for This&quot;.

Other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for their work are Anthrax, Steve Aoki, and Ben Weinman of the Dillinger Escape Plan.

<text>John Alexander Mathieson (May 19, 1863 – January 7, 1947) was a politician and jurist of Prince Edward Island, Canada, and the 12th premier.

Mathieson was born in Harrington and graduated from Prince of Wales College. He was a schoolmaster and lawyer before entering politics with his election to the province&#x27;s legislature as a Conservative in 1900. He represented the district of 4th Kings in his first term in the legislature, then shifted to 5th Kings in 1904.

Mathieson sat on the opposition benches, becoming Leader of the Opposition and of the Conservative Party in 1903. In December 1911, the Liberal government resigned when Premier H. James Palmer was defeated in a by-election which also caused the governing Liberals to lose their majority in the legislature. The Lieutenant-Governor of Prince Edward Island asked Mathieson as leader of the opposition to form a government, which he did, going on to win a mandate in the 1912 general election.

Mathieson&#x27;s government pressed the federal government to fulfill the terms on which Prince Edward Island joined Canadian Confederation in 1873. He succeeded in persuading Ottawa to provide an improved annual subsidy to the province and, in 1915, Ottawa announced the creation of a year-round ferry service to connect the island to the mainland. The ferries began operating between PEI and New Brunswick in 1917.

The province was also at risk of losing representation in the House of Commons of Canada due to population shifts. PEI had six MPs when it joined confederation in 1873, this was reduced to four and was to be cut further as a result of the 1911 census. Mathieson persuaded the federal government to agree to an amendment to the British North America Act guaranteeing the province a minimum of four MPs in perpetuity.

In 1917, Premier Mathieson left politics to accept an appointment as Chief Justice and served in that position until he retired in 1943.

<doc id="599745" wikidata="Q181678" url="?curid=599745" title="Dolph Lundgren">
<text>Hans &quot;Dolph&quot; Lundgren (, ; born 3 November 1957) is a Swedish actor, filmmaker, and martial artist. Lundgren made his acting debut in 1985 with a cameo in the James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;. Also that year, he had his breakthrough in Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, in which he played the lead villain as the imposing Soviet boxer Ivan Drago.

Lundgren went on to play lead roles in over 80 action-oriented films including &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; (1987), &quot;Red Scorpion&quot; (1988), &quot;The Punisher&quot; (1989), &quot;I Come in Peace&quot; (1990), &quot;Showdown in Little Tokyo&quot; (1991), &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; (1993), &quot;Men of War&quot; (1994), &quot;Silent Trigger&quot; (1996), and &quot;Blackjack&quot; (1998). He continued playing villainous roles, most notably as Sergeant Andrew Scott in three &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; films (1992–2012), co-starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Moving into the 2000s, Lundgren mostly appeared in direct-to-video films. During this time, Lundgren started directing and starring in his own films; these are &quot;The Defender&quot; (2004), &quot;The Mechanik&quot; (2005), &quot;Missionary Man&quot; (2007), and &quot;Command Performance&quot; (2009).

Lundgren returned to prominence in 2010 with the role of Gunner Jensen in Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s &quot;The Expendables&quot; alongside an all-action star cast. He reprised his role in its sequels. He has since appeared in the well-received films &quot;Aquaman&quot; (2018), &quot;Castle Falls&quot; (2021), which he also directed, &quot;Don&#x27;t Kill It&quot; (2017), and &quot;Showdown at the Grand&quot; (2023), among others. He returned to the role of Ivan Drago in &quot;Creed II&quot; (2018). In television, he has appeared in &quot;SAF3&quot; (2013–2014) and &quot;Arrow&quot; (2016–2017). His voice acting work includes &quot;Seal Team&quot; (2021) and &quot;&quot; (2022).

Lundgren received a degree in chemical engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology in the early 1980s and a master&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering from the University of Sydney in 1982. He has been practicing martial arts since the age of 16, earning the rank of 4th dan black belt in Kyokushin karate, and becoming the European champion in 1980 and 1981.

==Early life==
Hans Lundgren was born in Spånga, Stockholm County, Sweden to Sigrid Birgitta ( Tjerneld; 1932–1992), a language teacher, and Karl Hugo Johan Lundgren (1923–2000), an engineer (M.Sc.) and economist (MBA) for the Swedish government. He lived in Spånga until the age of 13, when he moved to his grandparents&#x27; home in Nyland, Ångermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters, Katarina and Annika and an elder brother Johan. Lundgren claims his father was physically abusive and took out his own personal frustrations on his wife and son. He has stated that, during his tirades, his father would call him a &quot;loser&quot;, which motivated him later as he grew more ambitious to prove himself. But he also said, &quot;I still love my father, no matter what happened. There are many things about him I still admire. As a child, I was probably too much like him, very stubborn—perhaps that&#x27;s what he couldn&#x27;t deal with.&quot; He has cited his troubled relationship with his father as the reason he developed a desire to participate in heavy contact sports such as boxing and karate.

Lundgren has said that, as a child, he was insecure and suffered from allergies, describing himself as a &quot;runt&quot;. He showed a keen interest in drumming and had aspirations to become a rock star. At age seven, he tried judo and Gōjū-ryū. He took up Kyokushin karate at the age of 10, and began lifting weights as a teenager. Lundgren stated that &quot;My dad always told me that if I wanted to make something special with my life, I had to go to America.&quot; After graduating from high school with straight A&#x27;s, he spent time in the United States in the 1970s on various academic scholarships, studying chemical engineering at Washington State University 1976–1977, and Clemson University prior to serving his mandatory one year in the Swedish Coastal Artillery at the Coastal Ranger School. In the late 1970s, he enrolled at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and graduated in the early 1980s with a degree in chemical engineering.

Amidst his years of studying, Lundgren honed his karate skills by training in a dojo for five years, and attained a black belt in Kyokushin by the late 1970s. He captained the Swedish Kyokushin karate team, and was a challenger at the 1979 World Open Tournament (arranged by the Kyokushin Karate Organization). He won the European championships in 1980 and 1981, and a full-contact karate tournament in Australia in 1982. In 1982, Lundgren graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering from the University of Sydney. During his time in Sydney, he earned a living as a bouncer in a nightclub in the notorious King&#x27;s Cross area.

Lundgren was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to MIT in 1983. However, while preparing for the move to Boston, he was spotted in the nightclub where he worked in Sydney and was hired by Grace Jones as a bodyguard, and the two became lovers. He moved with Jones to New York City, where he dabbled in modeling at the Zoli Agency but was described as &quot;a bit too tall and muscular for a model&#x27;s size 40&quot;. He earned a living as a bouncer at the Manhattan nightclub The Limelight, which was housed in the former Episcopal Church of the Holy Communion, working with Chazz Palminteri. In the daytime, he studied drama at the Warren Robertson Theatre Workshop and has said that &quot;my time in New York City opened up my adolescent Swedish eyes to a multitude of different people and lifestyles, mostly in the arts. I hung out with Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Iman, and Steve Rubell, danced at Studio 54, and studied acting with Andie MacDowell and Tom Hulce.&quot; Friends told him he should be in movies. He quit studying at MIT after two weeks to pursue acting. Lundgren said after being exposed to the entertainment business, he found it more attractive and rewarding than chemical engineering, so he decided to pursue a career in acting.

==Career==

=== 1980s to 1990s: breakthrough and action film star ===
Lundgren made his film debut in the 1985 James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, Roger Moore&#x27;s final film as 007, in the minor role of Venz, a KGB assassin. His former lover Grace Jones, who portrayed the villain May Day, personally recommended him. According to Lundgren, Moore said of him, &quot;Dolph is larger than Denmark.&quot;

Upon learning that Sylvester Stallone was seeking an imposing fighter to play Soviet boxer Ivan Drago in &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (1985), Lundgren sent videos and pictures of himself to a distant contact of Stallone, eventually reaching him. Lundgren tried out for the role, but as he himself has stated, he was initially turned down because he was too tall. Lundgren eventually beat 5,000 other hopefuls to land his breakout role opposite Stallone, Carl Weathers, and Brigitte Nielsen. To improve his physique and athletic abilities, he trained intensely in bodybuilding and boxing for five months before the film was shot. Lundgren said: &quot;We trained six days a week—weights in the morning for about an hour, then boxing in the afternoon. We did a split of chest and back one day and then shoulders, legs, and arms the next. We boxed for an hour and a half, practiced the fight choreography, and did bag work and abs.&quot; He weighed 240 pounds during filming, but in the film he was billed at 260 pounds, one shipping above of Drago, &quot;He&#x27;s a exceptional 250 pounds of merciless fighting machine, Drago is listed come to behold 270 pounds, the best that Soviet science &amp; medicine can create&quot;. His character&#x27;s lines &quot;If he dies, he dies&quot; and &quot;I must break you&quot; are amongst the best known of the &quot;Rocky&quot; series, and have often been cited in popular culture. Lundgren hit Stallone so hard during the filming of a fight scene that Stallone was in intensive care in the St. John&#x27;s Hospital for nine days with a blood pressure of 290, due to swelling of the pericardial sac around his heart. Lundgren later fought in a real boxing match against former UFC fighter Oleg Taktarov, and lost via decision. Lundgren has highlighted the premiere of &quot;Rocky IV&quot; at the Mann Village Theatre, in Westwood, Los Angeles, as the moment which changed his life, remarking: &quot;I walked in to a Westwood movie theater as Grace Jones&#x27; boyfriend and walked out ninety minutes later as the movie star Dolph Lundgren. I was shell-shocked for years from the mind-boggling and daunting experience of being a student-athlete from tiny Sweden suddenly having to live up a new action-star persona.&quot;

In 1987, Lundgren released on home media a workout video called &quot;Maximum Potential&quot;, and he also got his first lead role as He-Man in &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;, based on the popular children&#x27;s toyline and cartoon, directed by Gary Goddard. Lundgren weighed his all-time heaviest during the filming at 280 pounds. The film was a critical failure and viewed as far too violent for a family picture. It is referred to as a &quot;flop&quot; by &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, and has a 13% &quot;rotten&quot; rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Lundgren was criticized for being too wooden as a leading man, and it was dismissed as &quot;a glossy fantasy starring monosyllabic Dolph Lundgren&quot;.

In 1988, he starred in Joseph Zito&#x27;s &quot;Red Scorpion&quot;. Lundgren plays a Soviet KGB agent who is sent to an African country to assassinate the leader of an anti-communist rebel movement, but eventually switches sides. The film was poorly received and has an 17% &quot;rotten&quot; rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;Dolph Lundgren&#x27;s pectorals are the real stars of &quot;Red Scorpion,&quot; an action-adventure movie set in the fictional African country of Mombaka. Filmed from below so that one has the sense of peering up at a massive kinetic sculpture, his glistening torso, which over the course of the film is subjected to assorted tortures, is the movie&#x27;s primary visual focus whenever the action slows down. And since Mr. Lundgren remains stone-faced, rarely speaking except to issue commands in a surprisingly hesitant monotone, his heaving chest actually communicates more emotion than his mumbling lips.&quot;

In 1989, Lundgren then starred as Marvel Comics adaptation &quot;The Punisher&quot; playing the title role. Directed by Mark Goldblatt, the film changes some details of the character&#x27;s origin, and eliminates the signature skull logo. These elements troubled fans of the comic book upon its release and were dismissive. Also initial reviews found it to be a trashy comic book film. The film had a troubled release as the studios who made it were changed ownership. While the film was theatrically released internationally, the film went direct-to-video in the US. However over the years the film developed a cult with some who think it&#x27;s the best adaptation of the comic. The film was re-evaluated with a much more positive outlook who find Lundgren&#x27;s performance solid as a ghostly and soul depraved vigilante.

In 1990, Lundgren starred in Craig R. Baxley&#x27;s sci-fi thriller &quot;I Come in Peace&quot; (also known as &quot;Dark Angel&quot;) opposite Brian Benben, Betsy Brantley, Matthias Hues, and Jay Bilas. Lundgren plays a tough Houston cop with an inner sensitivity, who does not let the rules of police procedure prevent him pursuing his mission to wipe out a gang of drug dealers who killed his partner. Lundgren said of his role: &quot;What attracted me to Dark Angel is that I get to do more than just action. There&#x27;s some romance, some comedy, some drama. I actually have some clever dialogue in this one. I get to act.&quot;

In 1991, Lundgren starred in Manny Coto&#x27;s action film &quot;Cover Up&quot; opposite Louis Gossett Jr. Lundgren portrays a US Marine veteran turned reporter, who finds his own life in jeopardy after stumbling across a political cover-up. In Mark L. Lester&#x27;s martial arts action film &quot;Showdown in Little Tokyo&quot;, he and Brandon Lee play police officers investigating the yakuza. The film received a mainly negative reception from critics and was criticized for its violence; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;violent, but spiritless.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Lundgren can hold his own with other action leads as an actor and could easily be Van Damme-marketable if only he&#x27;d devote as much attention to quality control as he does to pectoral development.&quot; David J. Fox of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, however, described the film as a &quot;class act&quot;, and some retrospective critics find it to be entertaining for its genre.

In 1992, Lundgren starred in the sci-fi action picture &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; directed by Roland Emmerich. Lundgren (as Sergeant Andrew Scott) and Jean-Claude Van Damme (as Luc Deveraux) play U.S. soldiers who died during the Vietnam War, only to be later reanimated in a secret Army project to be sent on missions as GR operatives. At the 1992 Cannes Film Festival, Van Damme and Lundgren were involved in a verbal altercation that almost turned physical, but it was believed to have only been a publicity stunt. &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; opened in theatres on 10 July 1992, a moderate success domestically with $36,299,898 in US ticket sales, but a major blockbuster worldwide, making over $65 million overseas, which earned the film a total of $102 million worldwide, on a $23 million budget. Despite being a box office hit, it was not well-received; mainstream critics dismissed the movie as a &quot;Terminator 2&quot; rip-off. Film critic Roger Ebert said: &quot;it must be fairly thankless to play lunks who have to fight for the entire length of a movie while exchanging monosyllabic idiocies&quot;, and included &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; in his book &quot;I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie&quot;.

In 1993, Lundgren starred opposite Kristian Alfonso and George Segal in Vic Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;Joshua Tree&quot;. Lundgren plays Wellman Anthony Santee, a former racecar driver who is framed by police officer Frank Severance (Segal) for the murder of a highway patrolman. Much of the film was filmed in the Alabama Hills of the Sierra Nevada and the desert of the Joshua Tree National Park of southeast California.

In 1994, Lundgren starred in Bruce Malmuth&#x27;s &quot;Pentathlon&quot; as an East German Olympic gold medalist pentathlete on the run from an abusive coach. Lundgren trained with the U.S. pentathlon team in preparation for the role, which later led to him being selected to serve as the (non-competing) Team Leader of the 1996 U.S. Olympic Modern Pentathlon team during the Atlanta Games, to promote the image of the sport and to coordinate planning and other details between the team and the United States Olympic Committee. The film was seen negatively by most critics; &quot;Film Review&quot; said it was &quot;appallingly acted and monotonous&quot; and Video Movie Guide 2002 described it as a &quot;silly Cold War thriller&quot;.

Later in 1994, Lundgren appeared in Perry Lang&#x27;s &quot;Men of War&quot; (scripted by John Sayles) alongside Charlotte Lewis and BD Wong, as Nick Gunar, a former Special Ops soldier who leads a group of mercenaries to a treasure island in the South China Sea. The film was well received by some critics. One author said &quot;&quot;Men of War&quot; invokes the most vividly remembered fighting in a foreign land of recent Western history. This innovation, associating the muscle image with the Vietnam experience, is carried over into other contemporary muscle films.&quot; Another said, &quot;fine performances by an all-star Dolph Lundgren as a mercenary assigned to &#x27;convince&#x27; a cast in this offbeat and disturbing film.&quot;

In 1995, Lundgren appeared in Robert Longo&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, co-starring Keanu Reeves. The film portrays screenwriter William Gibson&#x27;s dystopian cyberpunk view of the future with the world dominated by megacorporations and with strong East Asian influences. Reeves plays the title character, a man with a cybernetic brain implant designed to store information. Lundgren plays Karl Honig, a Jesus-obsessed hitman and street preacher who wears a robe and carries a shepherd&#x27;s staff. Critical response was negative overall; Roger Ebert said, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic is one of the great gestures of recent cinema, a movie which doesn&#x27;t deserve one nanosecond of serious analysis.&quot; The film was a financial disappointment, grossing $19,075,720 in the domestic American market against its $26m budget. The cloak worn by Lundgren in the film is now located in the lobby of the Famous Players Coliseum in Mississauga, Ontario, it was his last theatrical release film until 2010. Later in 1995, Lundgren appeared in Ted Kotcheff&#x27;s &quot;The Shooter&quot;, an action drama in which he plays Michael Dane, a U.S. Marshall who gets caught up in politics when he is hired to solve the assassination of a Cuban ambassador.

=== 1996 to 2009: subsequent films and directorial efforts ===
In 1996, Lundgren starred in Russell Mulcahy&#x27;s &quot;Silent Trigger&quot;, playing a former Special Forces agent who joins a secretive government agency as an assassin. The Motion Picture Guide to the films of 1997 said, &quot;this stylish but empty thriller gives square-jawed Dolph Lundgren another shot at straight-to-video immortality&quot;.

In 1997, Lundgren starred in Frédéric Forestier&#x27;s &quot;The Peacekeeper&quot;, playing Major Frank Cross of the US Air Force and the only man who can prevent the president being assassinated and with the ability to thwart an imminent nuclear holocaust. The film co-starred Michael Sarrazin, Montel Williams, Roy Scheider and Christopher Heyerdahl, and was shot on location in Montreal. The film was praised for its exciting action sequences. Doug Pratt described the first half of the film as &quot;excellent&quot; and described Lundgren&#x27;s character as &quot;tenacious&quot;, although Robert Cettl wrote &quot;the Peacekeeper trades on the presence of B-movie action star Dolph Lundgren, an actor who never became as popular as his action contemporaries Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal.&quot;

In 1998, he appeared in Jean-Marc Piché&#x27;s action/supernatural horror film &quot;The Minion&quot; alongside Françoise Robertson Lundgren portrays Lukas Sadorov, a middle eastern templar and member of an order who are charged with guarding the gateway to Hell that, if opened, will unleash all evil. The DVD and Video Guide of 2005 described the film as being &quot;possibly one of the worst films ever&quot;. Later in 1998, Lundgren appeared alongside Bruce Payne and Claire Stansfield in &quot;Sweepers&quot; as Christian Erickson, a leading demolition expert and head of an elite team of specialists, trained to disarm mine fields in a humanitarian minesweeping operation in Angola. The Video Guide to 2002 said, &quot;that noise you hear isn&#x27;t the numerous on-screen explosions but action star Lundgren&#x27;s career hitting rock bottom.&quot; He also featured in the TV pilot &quot;Blackjack&quot; (directed by John Woo) as a former US Marshal who becomes the bodyguard and detective of a young supermodel (Kam Heskin), who becomes the target of a psychotic assassin (Phillip MacKenzie). One review described the narrative as &quot;laughably stupid&quot;, while the DVD and Video Guide to 2005 said, &quot;dull, lightweight, made-for-TV action fully to a satisfying climax&quot;.

In 1999, Lundgren played a mercenary in Isaac Florentine&#x27;s &quot;Bridge of Dragons,&quot; a military pilot in Anthony Hickox&#x27;s &quot;Storm Catcher,&quot; and a cop who&#x27;s a former boxer in &quot;Jill Rips&quot;, also directed by Hickox, based on a 1987 novel by Scottish writer Frederic Lindsay.

In 2000, Lundgren starred in &quot;The Last Warrior&quot; as Captain Nick Preston under director Sheldon Lettich. In Damian Lee&#x27;s &quot;Agent Red&quot; (also known as &quot;Captured&quot;), co-starring Alexander Kuznetsov and Natalie Radford and Randolph Mantooth, Lundgren plays a soldier trapped on a submarine during the Cold War who must work with his wife, a virologist, to prevent a terrorist chemical attack against the United States. After the film was completed, producer Andrew Stevens thought it was too poor to be released and multiple people had to be hired to at least make the film half-competent. The film was very poorly received, given its &quot;shoestring budget&quot;; the DVD and Film Guide of 2005 wrote, &quot;low-budget mess stars Dolph Lundgren as a navy special operations commander trying to keep a deadly virus out of the hands of terrorists. This subpar effort sinks to the bottom of the ocean in a tidal wave of cliche.&quot; During an interview on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Jay Leno in May 2008, &quot;Gladiator&quot; director Ridley Scott said Lundgren had been considered for the part of undefeated fighter Tigris of Gaul in 2000, but was eventually rejected because &quot;as an actor, he just didn&#x27;t fit in with what we were trying to achieve&quot;.

In 2001, Lundgren starred in &quot;Hidden Agenda&quot;, directed by Marc S. Grenier. He plays Jason Price, an ex-FBI agent who protects a witness. In 2003, Lundgren featured in Sidney J. Furie&#x27;s &quot;Detention&quot;.

In 2004, Lundgren appeared opposite Polly Shannon in &quot;Direct Action&quot; under Sidney J. Furie, portraying Sergeant Frank Gannon, an officer who has spent the last three years on the Direct Action Unit (DAU) task force, fighting gang crime and corruption and after he leaves he is hunted down by former colleagues for betraying the brotherhood. That year, he played a role in Ed Bye&#x27;s comedy &quot;Fat Slags.&quot; His next starring role was in the science fiction picture &quot;Retrograde.&quot; In it, Lundgren plays a man who is in a group of genetically unique people who travel back in time to prevent the discovery of meteors containing deadly bacteria.&quot;

In 2004, Lundgren made his directorial debut with &quot;The Defender&quot;, when he replaced Sidney J. Furie, who was sick during pre-production. Lundgren also stars, playing the bodyguard of the head of the National Security Agency during a war on terror.

In 2005, Lundgren starred and directed his second picture &quot;The Mechanik&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Russian Specialist&quot;), playing a retired Russian Special Forces hitman caught in the crossfire with Russian mobsters. Sky Movies remarked that &quot;The Mechanik&quot; is &quot;hardcore death-dealing from the Nordic leviathan&quot; and said that &quot;&quot;The Mechanik&quot; delivers all the no-nonsense gunplay you&#x27;d want of a Friday night&quot;.

In 2006, Lundgren played gladiator Brixos in the Italian-made historical/biblical drama, &quot;The Inquiry&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;inchiesta&quot;) a remake of a 1986 film by the same name, in an ensemble that includes Daniele Liotti, Mónica Cruz, Max von Sydow, F. Murray Abraham and Ornella Muti. Set in AD 35 in the Roman Empire, the story follows a fictional Roman general named Titus Valerius Taurus, a veteran of campaigns in Germania, who is sent to Judea by the emperor Tiberius to investigate the possibility of the divinity of the recently crucified Jesus. The film, shot on location in Tunisia and Bulgaria, premiered at the Capri, Hollywood and the Los Angeles Italia Film Festival.
In 2007, Lundgren directed and starred in the Mongolia-based action adventure, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;. Lundgren plays a mercenary hired by a group of fortune hunters to act as their guide and bodyguard. The film, a Canadian-Chinese production, was shot on location in Inner Mongolia. Later in 2007, Lundgren wrote, directed and starred in the modern western film, &quot;Missionary Man&quot; alongside Charles Solomon Jr. Lundgren plays a lone, Bible-preaching stranger named Ryder who comes into a small Texas town on his 1970&#x27;s Harley-Davidson motorcycle to attend the funeral of his good friend J.J., a local Native American carpenter, only to later get mixed up in a series of brawls with a local gang. According to Lundgren, it had long been a desire of his to direct a western, having long been a fan of Clint Eastwood and John Wayne, yet he did not want to spend the time and money building an old western town and hiring horses, so decided to set it in modern times with a motorbike. The film, shot on location in Waxahachie, south of Dallas, Texas, was specially screened at the 2008 AFI Dallas Film Festival.

In 2008, Lundgren starred in the direct-to-video action flick &quot;Direct Contact&quot;. He plays an ex-US Special forces operative on a rescue mission. This was followed by another direct to video film &quot;Command Performance&quot; (2009), a hostage action drama in which Lundgren, a proficient musician in real life, plays a rock drummer forced to face terrorists at a concert. The film co-starred Canadian pop singer Melissa Smith, playing a world-famous pop singer in the film and his own daughter, Ida, on her screen debut, who played one of the daughters of the Russian president. The story was inspired by a concert Madonna put on for Russian President Vladimir Putin, although Lundgren has also likened the pop singer to Britney Spears. The film premiered at the Ischia Global Film &amp; Music Festival on 18 July 2009.

In 2009, The Dolph Lundgren Scholarship was instituted in his name, which is awarded to the student with the best grades at Ådalsskolan in Kramfors, the school where he himself studied. Lundgren then reunited with Jean-Claude Van Damme in &quot;Universal Soldier: Regeneration&quot;, where he plays Andrew Scott&#x27;s clone. The film was released theatrically in the Middle East and Southeast Asia and directly to video in the United States and other parts of the world. Since its release, the film has received better than average reviews for a straight-to-DVD franchise sequel, with film critic Brian Orndorf giving the film a B, calling it &quot;moody, pleasingly quick-draw, and knows when to quit, making the &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; brand name bizarrely vital once again.&quot; &quot;Dread Central&quot; gave it three out of five knives, saying: &quot;there is almost nothing but solid b-level action until the credits roll.&quot; On the negative side, Pablo Villaça said in his review that while he praised Van Damme&#x27;s performance, he criticized that of Lundgren and described the film &quot;dull in concept and execution&quot;.

Later in 2009, Lundgren directed and starred as a businessman whose shady past as a KGB special agent is discovered in the hit-man thriller &quot;Icarus&quot; (retitled in the US and the UK as &quot;The Killing Machine&quot;).

===2010 to present day: return to prominence and current projects ===

In 2010, Lundgren made a guest star appearance on the TV series &quot;Chuck&quot; in the fourth-season premiere episode, &quot;Chuck Versus the Anniversary&quot;, as Russian spy Marco, with references to &quot;Rocky IV&quot;&#x27;s Ivan Drago. He then played a drug-addled assassin in the ensemble action film &quot;The Expendables&quot;, in a cast which includes popular action stars such as Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, and Randy Couture as a group of elite mercenaries, tasked with a mission to overthrow a Latin American dictator. It was described by Lundgren as &quot;an old-school, kick-ass action movie where people are fighting with knives and shooting at each other.&quot; The film received mixed reviews from critics but was very successful commercially, opening at number one at the box office in the United States, the United Kingdom China and India.

Lundgren was one of three hosts for the 2010 Melodifestivalen, where the Swedish contribution to the Eurovision Song Contest is selected. In the first installation on 6 February, Lundgren co-hosted the competition together with comedian Christine Meltzer and performer Måns Zelmerlöw. Lundgren&#x27;s appearance was hailed by critics and audience, particularly his rendition of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot;.

Lundgren played the lead role in Uwe Boll&#x27;s &quot;In the Name of the King 2: Two Worlds&quot;, and had supporting roles in Jonas Åkerlund&#x27;s &quot;Small Apartments&quot; and a thriller called &quot;Stash House&quot;. Principal photography for &quot;Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning&quot; began on 9 May 2011 in Louisiana, and filming wrapped on &quot;One in the Chamber&quot; (co-starring Cuba Gooding Jr.) around the same time. &quot;The Expendables 2&quot; entered principal photography in late September/early October 2011, with Lundgren reprising his role as Gunner Jensen. Filming wrapped in January 2012, and it was released by Lionsgate on 17 August later that year.

In 2013, Lundgren starred alongside Steve Austin in &quot;The Package&quot;. Directed by Jesse Johnson, principal photography wrapped in March 2012, and the film was released on 9 February 2013. For a direct-to-DVD film, &quot;The Package&quot; was not a financial success. In its first week of release, the film debuted at no. 81; grossing $1,469 at the domestic box office. He starred in a number of other films later that year, including &quot;Legendary&quot;, &quot;Battle of the Damned&quot;, &quot;Ambushed&quot;, and &quot;Blood of Redemption&quot;.

In 2014, Lundgren co-starred opposite Cung Le in the action film &quot;Puncture Wounds&quot;, and reprised his role as Gunner Jensen for the third time in &quot;The Expendables 3&quot;. He then wrote, produced, and starred alongside Tony Jaa and Ron Perlman in &quot;Skin Trade&quot;, an action thriller about human trafficking. Principal photography started on 2 February 2014 in Thailand, and wrapped in Vancouver; April the same year. The film received a limited theatrical release, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release on 25 August 2015. In February, he filmed a cameo for the Coen brothers&#x27; 2016 comedy film &quot;Hail, Caesar!&quot;, portraying a Soviet submarine captain.
On 21 January 2015, Lundgren started filming straight-to-video film &quot;Shark Lake&quot; on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. This was followed by a further six weeks of filming in the &quot;Reno-Tahoe area&quot;. In the film, he portrays Clint Gray, a black-market dealer of exotic species responsible for releasing a dangerous shark into Lake Tahoe. Directed by Jerry Dugan, the film&#x27;s budget was $2 million. On 23 May, straight-to-video film &quot;War Pigs&quot; premiered at the GI Film Festival. In the film, Lundgren co-starred (alongside Luke Goss) as Captain Hans Picault, a French Legionnaire who trains a U.S. Army Infantry group to go behind enemy lines and exterminate the Nazis. In August 2015, he started filming &quot;Kindergarten Cop 2&quot; in Ontario, Canada, a straight-to-video sequel to the 1990 comedy film that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. He portrays Agent Reed, a law enforcement officer who must go undercover as a kindergarten teacher, in order to recover a missing flash drive from the Federal Witness Protection Program. Throughout that year, he starred in a number of other straight-to-video films, including the crime thriller &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Dead&quot; and the prison film &quot;Riot&quot;. He starred in the music video of Imagine Dragons&#x27;s Believer, which was released on 7 March 2017. In August 2017, he portrayed the future version of Gil Shepard in the Syfy film &quot;Sharknado 5: Global Swarming&quot;.

In 2018, &quot;Black Water,&quot; an action thriller, directed by Pasha Patriki was released. Also starred Van Damme, this was their fifth collaboration between both actors as well as the first time they appear together as on-screen allies. Lundgren reprised his role of Ivan Drago from &quot;Rocky IV&quot; in &quot;Creed II&quot;, the 2018 sequel to &quot;Creed&quot;. He played an older, impoverished Drago in the film, which also introduces the character&#x27;s son, Viktor. This marked the beginning of what &quot;New York&quot; has described as Lundgren&#x27;s &quot;comeback.&quot; Also that year, Lundgren appeared in the DC Extended Universe film &quot;Aquaman&quot;, from director James Wan, as the underwater king Nereus. Later in 2021, Lundgren starred and directed in the 2021 action film &quot;Castle Falls&quot; as Richard Ericson, in his first feature film as directed in nearly 12 years.

In 2022, Lundgren starred in a series of Old Spice advertisements to promote a new antiperspirant line of deodorant spray. The advertisements depicted the 65 year old actor as a young adult doing an &quot;80s action movie spoof.&quot; He would later appear in FanDuel&#x27;s &quot;Powerful Hunch&quot; campaign.

==Training and diet==
Although Lundgren has never competed as a professional bodybuilder, he has been closely associated with bodybuilding and fitness since his role as Drago in the mid-1980s. Bodybuilding.com said, &quot;Looking like a man in his 30s rather than his 50s, Lundgren is the poster boy of precise nutrition, supplementation and exercise application that he has practiced for over 35 years&quot;. In an interview with them, he claimed to often train up to six days a week, usually one-hour sessions completed in the morning, saying that &quot;it&#x27;s just one hour a day, and then you can enjoy the other 23 hours&quot;. Although he had begun lifting weights as a teenager, he cites co-star Sylvester Stallone as the man who got him into serious bodybuilding for a period in the 1980s after he arrived in the U.S. Stallone had a lasting influence on his fitness regimen and diet, ensuring that he ate a much higher percentage of protein and split his food intake between five or six smaller meals a day. In 2023, he said in an interview that he took anabolic steroids off and on from the mid-&#x27;80s to the mid-&#x27;90s. Lundgren has professed never to have been &quot;super strong&quot;, saying that, &quot;I&#x27;m too tall and my arms are long. I think back then [&quot;Rocky IV&quot;] I was working with around 300 pounds on the bench and squat.&quot;

In a January 2011 interview with &quot;GQ&quot;, he announced he was working on releasing his own range of vitamins and supplements. He wrote an autobiographical fitness book, &quot;Train Like an Action Hero: Be Fit Forever&quot;, published in Sweden (by Bonnier Fakta) on 9 August 2011, offering tips he learned over the years to work out in various situations (with a busy schedule and a lot of traveling). It also discusses a detailed account of his earlier life and troubles. He cites a better quality of life as having inspired him to maintain his physical fitness.

When in Los Angeles, he trains at the Equinox Gym in Westwood and previously at home in Marbella, Spain, he trained at the Qi Sport Gym in Puerto Banús. Lundgren also spars and practices karate aside from weight lifting. He cites dead lifting and squats as the best exercises for muscle building. Lundgren is not a heavy drinker, but has professed on many occasions to being fond of tequila and cocktails, citing his knowledge in chemical engineering as &quot;making really good drinks&quot;.

==Personal life==
Lundgren splits his time between Stockholm and Los Angeles. He speaks Swedish and English fluently, as well as smaller amounts of French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, but is not fluent in those five languages as has often been reported.

He is an avid football fan. He supported Everton when he lived in Europe, but developed more of an interest in international football tournaments (such as the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup) after moving to Los Angeles.

During the 1980s, Lundgren had relationships with Jamaican singer Grace Jones and American model Paula Barbieri. While Lundgren was completing a master&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering on an exchange program with the University of Sydney in Australia, Jones spotted him at a dance club and hired him as a bodyguard. Lundgren was whisked off to the United States, where he completed his final thesis.

In 1994, he married Anette Qviberg (b. 1966), a jewellery designer and fashion stylist, in Marbella. The couple decided they liked Marbella so much that they rented accommodations there for years, before eventually buying a family home there. They have two daughters: Ida Sigrid Lundgren (b. 1996) and Greta Eveline Lundgren (b. 2001), both born in Stockholm. Lundgren and Qviberg cited the reason for living outside Hollywood was to give their children as normal a childhood as possible. In early May 2009, three masked burglars reportedly broke into Lundgren&#x27;s Marbella home. The burglars tied up and threatened his wife, but fled when they found a family photo and realized that the house was owned by Lundgren. Lundgren later stated he believed the intruders to be Eastern European and had asked contacts in Bulgaria to investigate them, but to no avail. After the incident, Lundgren&#x27;s elder daughter, Ida, suffered from PTSD. His wife was the &quot;most traumatized&quot;, and they divorced in 2011.

Lundgren was in a relationship with Jenny Sandersson from 2011 to 2017. Lundgren became engaged to Norwegian personal trainer Emma Krokdal, nearly 40 years his junior, in June 2020. They married at their villa in Mykonos on July 13, 2023.

In May 2023, Lundgren revealed that he had been battling kidney cancer since 2015.

In February 2024, Lundgren and his wife, Emma Krokdal, officially became US citizens.

<text>Li Jingfang GCVO (李經方; 1854 – 28 September 1934), also known as Li Ching-fong, was a Chinese statesman during the Qing dynasty. Being the nephew and adopted son of the late statesman Li Hongzhang, he served in his adoptive father&#x27;s secretariat in his youth. In 1882, Li Jingfang obtained the second highest degree in the imperial examinations and subsequently obtained appointment in the Qing foreign service because of his knowledge of English. In 1886–89, he worked as a secretary to the Qing legation in London and in 1890-92 he served as the Qing minister to Japan. He is mostly known for having signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Shimonoseki in Li Hongzhang&#x27;s stead in 1895. He was appointed as an Honorary Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order by Queen Victoria in 1896 and was promoted to a Honorary Knight Grand Cross a few years later in 1909. He also served as the Chinese Minister to London in 1909–1910.

== Life ==
Li Jingfang was originally the son of Li Zhaoqing, the sixth younger brother of Li Hongzhang. In 1862, Li Hongzhang was over 40 years old and still had no children, so Li Zhaoqing adopted Li Jingfang to Li Hongzhang, who referred to him as his &quot;eldest son.&quot;

In 1877, Li Jingfang and his eldest younger brother Li Jingshu studied at the Viceroy of Zhili&#x27;s Office in Tianjin under the tutelage of Hong Rukui. In 1890, he was appointed Resident Minister to Japan. In 1894, the Sino-Japanese Yellow Sea Battle (Battle of the Yalu River) broke out, and Li Jingfang returned to China.

In 1895, Li Jingfang accompanied Li Hongzhang to Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture in Japan to negotiate the Treaty of Shimonoseki. As the Qing government&#x27;s plenipotentiary, he was responsible for &quot;handing over Taiwan&quot; and was thus known as the &quot;Taiwan Cession Envoy&quot;. On June 1, Li Jingfang arrived in Taiwan on the German steamship Gerechtigkeit. On June 2, accompanied by translators Lu Yongming and Tao Dajun, he signed the &quot;Taiwan Handover Document&quot; with Admiral Kabayama Sukenori, the first Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, off the coast of Cape Santiago in Keelung. The document stipulated that &quot;all forts, arsenals, and public property belonging to the various ports and prefectures of the entire island of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands&quot; would be handed over to Japan. Li Jingfang chose to conduct the sovereignty handover on board a Japanese warship off the coast of Keelung to avoid angry locals. Kabayama had asked Li &quot;why not go ashore to sign it,&quot; to which Li replied, &quot;The Taiwanese people are very resentful and I am afraid of being assassinated.&quot;

In 1905, Li Jingfang was appointed Minister of Commerce by the Qing government. In 1907, he became Resident Minister to Britain. In 1911, he was transferred to the post of Left Vice-Minister of Posts and Communications. After much effort to negotiate with foreigners, Li Jingfang was appointed the first Director-General of the Chinese General Postal Administration.

<doc id="599747" wikidata="Q733809" url="?curid=599747" title="Fair-share scheduling">
<text>Fair-share scheduling is a scheduling algorithm for computer operating systems in which the CPU usage is equally distributed among system users or groups, as opposed to equal distribution of resources among processes.

One common method of logically implementing the fair-share scheduling strategy is to recursively apply the round-robin scheduling strategy at each level of abstraction (processes, users, groups, etc.) The time quantum required by round-robin is arbitrary, as any equal division of time will produce the same results.

This was first developed by Judy Kay and Piers Lauder through their research at the University of Sydney in the 1980s.

For example, if four users (A, B, C, D) are concurrently executing one process each, the scheduler will logically divide the available CPU cycles such that each user gets 25% of the whole (100% / 4 = 25%). If user B starts a second process, each user will still receive 25% of the total cycles, but each of user B&#x27;s processes will now be attributed 12.5% of the total CPU cycles each, totalling user B&#x27;s fair share of 25%. On the other hand, if a new user starts a process on the system, the scheduler will reapportion the available CPU cycles such that each user gets 20% of the whole (100% / 5 = 20%).

Another layer of abstraction allows us to partition users into groups, and apply the fair share algorithm to the groups as well. In this case, the available CPU cycles are divided first among the groups, then among the users within the groups, and then among the processes for that user. For example, if there are three groups (1,2,3) containing three, two, and four users respectively, the available CPU cycles will be distributed as follows:

100% / 3 groups = 33.3% per group&lt;br&gt;
Group 1: (33.3% / 3 users) = 11.1% per user&lt;br&gt;
Group 2: (33.3% / 2 users) = 16.7% per user&lt;br&gt;
Group 3: (33.3% / 4 users) = 8.3% per user

<text>Hanging parrots are birds in the genus Loriculus, a group of small parrots from tropical southern Asia.

About long, hanging parrots are mostly green plumaged and short-tailed. Often head coloring helps to identify individual species. They are unique among birds for their ability to sleep upside down.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Loriculus&quot; was introduced in 1849 by the English zoologist Edward Blyth for the blue-crowned hanging parrot. The name is a diminutive of the genus &quot;Lorius&quot; that was introduced by Nicholas Aylward Vigors for the lorys in 1825.

Fifteen species are recognised:

<text>Crown College is one of the residential colleges that makes up the University of California, Santa Cruz, United States.

Despite its thematic grounding in natural science and technology, like at all UCSC colleges, Crown students major in subjects across all disciplines. Crown has a favorable reputation for academically focused students, possibly due to both its reputation as a science college and its secluded location on the Santa Cruz campus. Because of its strong academic roots, Crown College is regarded as one of the quieter colleges on the campus. It is very close to Upper Campus, which is often frequented by hikers and mountain bikers.

Residents of the college are informally known as &quot;Crownies.&quot;

== History and campus ==

Crown was founded in 1967 when the Chancellor Dean E. McHenry invited biologist Kenneth V. Thimann to come to Santa Cruz and head what would become Crown College and to build the science faculty at UCSC.

Located on the upper northern side of campus by Merrill College, Crown also borders the newly constructed Colleges Nine and Ten. Crown is made up of eight three-floor residence halls as well as having about half of the Crown-Merrill apartment buildings. The UCSC fire station is located at Crown.

Because of its strong science-related roots and continuing tradition, all of the student residence buildings have science-related themes and names: Gauss House, Galen House, Rutherford House, Harvey and Maxwell Houses, Leonardo House, Galileo House, and Descartes House.

Since 2009, Crown College started the popular College game of Humans vs Zombies attracting up to one hundred students when they meet, this is also the location where the UCSC zombie defense council will be formed.

== Students and faculty ==
=== Student demographics ===
In the third week census of the fall of 2006, the 1,463 undergraduates affiliated with Crown included 449 new and 1,014 returning students. Their ethnic composition was 2.5% African American, 1.2% Native American, 22.8% Asian, 10.0% Latino, 4.0% Chicano, 4.4% Filipino, 45.7% Euro-American, 2.2% Other, and 7.2% Unidentified. The average gender representation during the 2005–06 academic year was 42% female and 58% male. Crown was the only college at UCSC with a predominantly male enrollment, with the whole campus having a 54% to 46% female majority.

=== Notable Crown fellows ===
Several of the fellows of Crown College have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences or are otherwise notable for their academic work. 
*Sandra M. Faber – Professor of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics noted for invention of Cold dark matter theory and fundamental work in the field of Galaxy formation and evolution; member of the NAS; member of the AAAS (elected 1989)
*David Haussler – Professor of Biomolecular Engineering noted for work on the human genome and development of the UCSC Genome Browser as part of the Human Genome Project; member of the AAAS (elected 2006)
*Douglas N. C. Lin – Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics; member of the AAAS (elected 2002)(Publications at Scientific Commons)
*Harry Noller – Professor of Biology noted for RNA research; member of the AAAS (elected 1969)
*Joel Primack – Professor of Physics, noted cosmologist; renowned for Cold Dark Matter Theory proposed along with Sandra Faber (see above) and Sir Martin Rees
*Kenneth V. Thimann – Founding Provost notable for his research in biology; in 1934, obtained and isolated pure auxin, an important plant-growth hormone and, with several coworkers, proved that auxin promotes cell elongation, formation of roots, and growth of buds, discoveries that led to the development of a widely used synthetic auxin, 2,4-D. Use of this chemical prevents the premature falling of fruit and stimulates cut stems to grow abundant roots. Because high concentrations of auxins are toxic to most plants, synthetic auxins are effective weed killers. This research was used in the subsequent development of the herbicide Agent Orange.
*Stephen Thorsett – Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics and Dean of Physical and Biological Science known for work on properties of compact stars
*Stanford E. Woosley – Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics noted for his work on supernova gamma ray bursts; member of the NAS and AAAS (elected 2001)
*Judit Moschkovich – Professor on Social Sciences Division, Education Department

<doc id="599759" wikidata="Q7375806" url="?curid=599759" title="Rubber Duckie">
<text>&quot;Rubber Duckie&quot; is a song sung by the Muppet character Ernie (performed by Jim Henson) on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. The song is named after Ernie&#x27;s toy, a rubber duck affectionately named Rubber Duckie.

The song, written by Jeff Moss and arranged by Joe Raposo, was first heard by children watching an episode of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; on February 25, 1970. It was popular enough to be recorded and released as a 45 rpm single and became a surprise mainstream hit, peaking at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on September 26, 1970, and at No. 10 in Australia.

It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Recording for Children in 1971 but lost out to the album &quot;The Sesame Street Book &amp; Record&quot;, which contained the song. The song had follow-ups &quot;Do De Rubber Duck&quot;, &quot;D-U-C-K-I-E&quot; and &quot;The Honker Duckie Dinger Jamboree&quot; was the centerpiece of 1988&#x27;s &quot;Put Down the Duckie&quot;, performed by Hoots the Owl but also featuring Ernie.

==Composition==
The song is written in the key of B-flat major.

==Other recordings and performances==

In 1971, one of The Irish Rovers sings the song in one sketch as part of one of the episodes of &quot;The Irish Rovers Show&quot;. Little Richard performed a rock-and-roll version of the song as a guest on a 1994 episode of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Bob McGrath recorded the song in his album &quot;Bob&#x27;s Favorite Street Songs&quot;. The song made a brief appearance in a scene in &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady&quot;, and during an episode of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; Daveed Diggs, in costume as Mr. Noodle&#x27;s Brother Mr. Noodle, performed a hip-hop infused version on Sesame Street&#x27;s YouTube channel and it’s just like Shake a Tail Feather and When I See an Elephant Fly.

Little Richard also performed a rockabilly-tinged version of the song, which can also be found on Sesame Street&#x27;s official YouTube channel. 

Stride pianist Dick Wellstood included a performance of the song on his 1974 live album &quot;Walkin&#x27; with Wellstood&quot;. Jane Krakowski sings the song on her live album &quot;The Laziest Gal in Town&quot;.

A 2017 re-recorded version of the song features guest appearances by Tori Kelly, James Corden, Sia, Jason Derulo, Anthony Mackie and Daveed Diggs.

<doc id="599776" wikidata="Q6158239" url="?curid=599776" title="Japanese Iraq Reconstruction and Support Group">
<text>The Japanese Iraq Reconstruction and Support Group, also known as the , was a battalion-sized, largely humanitarian contingent of the Japan Self-Defense Forces that was sent to Samawah, Southern Iraq in early January 2004 and withdrawn by late July 2006. However, the last JASDF forces left Kuwait on December 18, 2008. Approximately 5,500 Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force members were present in Samawah between 2004 and 2006.

Their duties had included tasks such as water purification, reconstruction and reestablishment of public facilities, including medical facilities known as Public Health Centers, for the Iraqi people. While legally required to remain within noncombat zones, GSDF records revealed that Japanese troops were present in areas of active hostilities.

==Background==
The Koizumi administration originally ordered the controversial formation and deployment of the JIRSG at the request of the United States. This marks a significant turning point in Japan&#x27;s history, as it represents the first foreign deployment of Japanese troops since the end of World War II, excluding those deployments conducted under United Nations auspices. Public opinion regarding the deployment was sharply divided, especially given that Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan prohibits the use of military forces unless for self-defence purposes (operating in Iraq seemed, at best, tenuously connected to that mission).

In order to legalize the deployment of Japanese forces in Samawah, the Koizumi administration legislated the Humanitarian Relief and Iraqi Reconstruction Special Measures Law on December 9, 2003, in the Diet, even though the opposition firmly opposed it.

Two Japanese diplomats were shot and killed near Tikrit, Iraq on November 29, 2003, while preparations for the deployment were in their final stages.

On April 8, 2004, three Japanese- a journalist and two aid workers- were kidnapped, but they were released several days later on April 15. The following day, another two Japanese- an aid worker and a journalist- were kidnapped and released within 24 hours. The kidnappers of the original three had threatened to burn the hostages alive if Japanese troops were not removed from Iraq within three days. A spokeswoman for the Islamic Clerics Committee, which negotiated their release, said that growing public calls in Japan for the SDF troops to be withdrawn from Iraq led to the release of three Japanese.

In a statement released on July 20, 2004, Al Zarqawi warned Japan, Poland and Bulgaria to withdraw their troops, demanding that the Japanese government: &#x27;...do what the Philippines has done...&#x27;, and threatening that: &#x27;Lines of cars laden with explosives are awaiting you...&#x27; if the demands were not met.

The body of a Japanese backpacker, Shosei Koda, was found in Baghdad on October 30, 2004, several days after he had been kidnapped. His captors had promised to execute him unless Japanese troops were withdrawn. According to Channel NewsAsia, the killing renewed domestic pressure on Prime Minister Koizumi to bring the contingent home.

One Japanese private security guard, Akihiko Saito, was killed in an ambush on his convoy on May 25, 2005.

==Significance==
Analysts differ as to the political ramifications of the deployment. One view is that it represents the emergence of Japan as a close military ally of the United States, strategically positioned as a counterweight to China&#x27;s growing regional power. This position asserts that the Iraq deployment offers a constitutional model for future overseas deployment in circumvention of Article 9. Another interpretation is that the deployment is entirely symbolic as it comes at little financial or human cost to the Koizumi administration, has a negligible effect on the strategic situation in Iraq, and is simply aimed at maintaining positive relations with the U.S. so as to perpetuate a favorable economic relationship.

At the height of the deployment, on September 19, 2005, a senior Defense Agency official succinctly gave his opinion on the future prospects for overseas Japanese military deployments, drawing on his opinion of the Iraq mission: &quot;It isn’t worth it&quot;. Analysts said that the restrictive rules of engagement and reliance on the constant protection of others effectively renders meaningful Japanese participation in international operations impossible for the foreseeable future.

One opposition member had said that the JIRSG deployment &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if it really were for humanitarian reasons. But it is first and foremost a show of support to the U.S. The U.S. invaded Iraq without a U.N. resolution, and Japan is now aiding in that act.&quot;

Since the beginning of the war in Iraq, the city of Samawah has continuously been a relatively stable city, in what is probably the most peaceful and sparsely populated province of non-Kurdish Iraq.

The first elements of the contingent arrived in Kuwait on January 9 and January 17, 2004, after an advance team from the Japanese Air Self-Defense Forces (JASDF) assessed the security situation in Samawah in late December 2003 and to Kuwait for the arrival of other JSDF forces to Iraq. The first JGSDF troops arrived at the Dutch military base in Samawah on January 19.

Prime Minister Koizumi decided on December 8, 2005 to renew the contingent&#x27;s mandate for another year, despite a poll by the Asahi newspaper which found that 69% of respondents were against renewing the mandate, up from 55% in January. A total of nine JIRSG scheduled rotations took place between 2004 and 2006.

Protection for the unit was provided primarily by Australian and Dutch troops, as the Japanese soldiers were prohibited from engaging Iraqi guerrillas unless they came under fire. However, a small number of Japanese Special Forces Group, Western Army Infantry Regiment, and 1st Airborne Brigade soldiers were deployed to provide protection. Mortars and rockets were lobbed at the Japanese camp several times, causing no damage or injuries.

==Withdrawal==
Although Defense Agency officials initially denied a report that the JSDF would be withdrawing from Iraq, they eventually confirmed that the contingent would leave Iraq by March 2006. Officials, however, subsequently insisted that any withdrawal would hinge on the ability of the Iraqis to form a new government by the end of 2006. A united Iraqi government was established in May 2006, and Koizumi subsequently announced that forces could be withdrawn as early as the end of July given the completion of the mission.

Koizumi announced on June 20, 2006, that the Japanese contingent would be withdrawn within &#x27;several dozen days&#x27;, however he suggested expanding airborne logistical support from southern parts of the country to Baghdad in place of the ground force.

On June 25, the first batch of the 600-member contingent began to withdraw from Samawah to Kuwait. The last 220 troops left Iraq by July 18. And the JIRSG base in Samawah was planned to be the new headquarters of the 2nd Brigade, 10th Division of the Iraqi Army.

Although all Japanese soldiers have left Iraq, JASDF forces continue to play a minor support role. As of November 2006, JASDF transport aircraft were assisting coalition forces by airlifting materials and personnel between Iraq and Kuwait. The airlift mission was extended until July 31, 2007, at which point it was extended again for another two years. As of November 26, 2008, 671.1 tons of supplies have been transported since March 2004.

Due to rising anti-Iraq war sentiment from the opposition, the Japanese government announced that its JASDF forces in Kuwait would withdraw soon, though it was announced that the withdrawal was due to the improving security situation and the nearing expiration of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1790, which allowed multinational forces to stay in Iraq until December 2008. The last JASDF forces left Kuwait on December 18, 2008.

===Legacy===
On April 17, 2008, the Nagoya High Court ruled that the dispatch of troops was partly unconstitutional.

<doc id="599784" wikidata="Q593582" url="?curid=599784" title="Greater honeyguide">
<text>The greater honeyguide (Indicator indicator) is a bird in the family Indicatoridae, paleotropical near passerine birds related to the woodpeckers. Its English and scientific names refer to its habit of guiding people to bee colonies. Claims that it also guides non-human animals are disputed.

The greater honeyguide is a resident breeder in sub-Saharan Africa. It is found in a variety of habitats that have trees, especially dry open woodland, but not in the West African jungle.

==Description==
The greater honeyguide has bold white patches on the sides of the tail and is about long and weighs about . The male has a black throat, pink bill, dark grey-brown upperparts and white underparts. The wings are streaked whitish, and the shoulder patch is yellow.
The female is duller, has a blackish bill, and her throat is black. Immature birds have olive-brown upperparts with a white rump, yellow throat and upper breast.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The greater honeyguide is known to guide people to the nests of wild bees. A guiding bird attracts a person&#x27;s attention with wavering, chattering tya&#x27; notes compounded with peeps or pipes&quot;, sounds it also gives in aggression. The guiding bird flies toward an occupied nest (greater honeyguides know the sites of many bees&#x27; nests in their territories) and then stops nearby the nest. Honey-hunters then do a final search for the bee colony, and if deemed suitable, harvest honey from the bee colony through the use of fire and smoke to subdue the bees, and axes and machetes to expose the colony. After harvesting the honey, the honeyguide eats wax that is left.

One study found that use of honeyguides by the Boran people of East Africa reduces their search time for honey by approximately two-thirds. Because of this benefit, the Boran use a specific loud whistle, known as the &quot;fuulido&quot;, when a search for honey is about to begin. The &quot;fuulido&quot; doubles the encounter rate with honeyguides. In northern Tanzania, Honeyguides increased the Hadza&#x27;s rate of finding bee nests by 560%, and led men to significantly higher yielding nests than those found without honeyguides. Another study of the Yao honey-hunters in northern Mozambique showed that the honeyguides responded to the traditional &quot;brrrr-hmm&quot; call of the honey-hunters. The chances of finding a bee-hive were greatly increased when the traditional call was used. That study reported anecdotes from Yao honey-hunters that adult but not juvenile honeyguides respond to the specific honey-hunting calls.

In African folklore, it is frequently noted that the honeyguide should be thanked with a gift of honey; if not, it may lead its follower to a lion, bull elephant, or venomous snake as punishment. However, “others maintain that honeycomb spoils the bird, and leave it to find its own bits of comb”. While many depictions of the human-honeyguide mutualism emphasize honey-hunters graciously repaying the birds with piles of wax left in a conspicuous location, such behavior is not universal. The Hadza people of northern Tanzania frequently burn, bury, or hide the wax that lays with the intent of keeping the bird hungry, and more likely to guide again. Some greater honeyguides have stopped this guiding behavior, or mutualism, in parts of Kenya, due to a loss of response from people in the area.

=== Possible guiding of animals ===

Many sources say that this species also guides honey badgers. Sparrman noted in the 18th century that indigenous Africans reported this interaction, but Friedmann adds that no biologist has seen it. Friedmann quotes reports that greater honeyguides guide baboons and speculates that the behavior evolved in relation to these species before the appearance of humanity. However, they state,

In addition to that listed by Friedmann (1955:41-47), the only recent record is of a greater honeyguide giving its guiding call to baboons at Wankie Game Reserve, Zimbabwe (C. J. Vernon, pers. comm.). However, Vernon did not see a positive response by the baboons to the honeyguide. No additional records of honeyguides and ratels have been reported since Friedmann (1955) and the first-hand accounts given in his review in support of this association are all of incomplete guiding sequences. No biologist has ever reported this association.

Honeyguides are thought to guide other animals, a behavior that may have evolved with &quot;early human&quot;. Later studies estimate that interaction between honeyguides and honey badgers likely occurs, &quot;but is highly localized or extremely difficult to observe, or both&quot;. It has also been acknowledged that bee colonies are seasonally very common in Africa and ratels probably have no trouble finding them.

Another argument against guiding of non-human animals is that near cities, where Africans increasingly buy sugar rather than hunting for wild honey, guiding behavior is disappearing. Ultimately, it may disappear everywhere.

===Diet===
The greater honeyguide feeds primarily on the contents of bee colonies: beeswax, eggs, larvae and pupae; and waxworms. It enters bees&#x27; nests while the bees are torpid in the early morning, feeds at abandoned hives and scavenges at hives robbed by people or other large animals, notably the honey badger.
It frequently associates with other honeyguides at bees&#x27; nests; immatures dominate adults, and immatures of this species dominate all others.

===Reproduction===
The greater honeyguide is a brood parasite. It lays white eggs in series of 3 to 7, for a total of 10 to 20 in a year. Each egg is laid in a different nest of a bird of another species, including some woodpeckers, barbets, kingfishers, bee-eaters, wood hoopoes, starlings, and large swallows. It is common for the female greater honeyguide to break the host&#x27;s eggs when laying her own. All the species parasitized nest in holes, covered nests, or deep cup nests. The chick has a membranous hook on the bill that it uses, while still blind and featherless, to kill the host&#x27;s young outright or by repeated wounds.

<doc id="599786" wikidata="Q3564751" url="?curid=599786" title="WNEP-TV">
<text>WNEP-TV (channel 16) is a television station licensed to Scranton, Pennsylvania, United States, serving as the ABC affiliate for Northeastern Pennsylvania. Owned by Tegna Inc., the station maintains studios on Montage Mountain Road in Moosic. Through a channel sharing agreement with PBS member WVIA-TV (channel 44), the two stations transmit using WNEP-TV&#x27;s spectrum from an antenna at Penobscot Knob near Mountain Top.

WNEP-TV operates a digital replacement translator on UHF channel 22 that is licensed to Waymart with a transmitter in Forest City. It exists because wind turbines run by NextEra Energy Resources at the Waymart Wind Farm interfere with the transmission of full-power television signals.

==History==

===WILK-TV and WARM-TV===
There were originally two ABC network affiliates in northeastern Pennsylvania. WILK-TV, operating on channel 34 and owned by WILK radio took to the air from Wilkes-Barre on September 15, 1953. It was followed by Scranton-licensed WARM-TV, broadcasting on channel 16 and owned by future Governor William Scranton along with WARM radio, in February 1954. During the late 1950s, WILK-TV was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.

WILK wanted to get a head start on the other local stations when it signed on in 1953, going on the air at 2 p.m. rather than the 3 pm sign on that the other stations did. The engineers got the signal ready by noon and decided to take a break. However, at lunch, they turned on the station to inspect their handiwork, only to find the signal was dead. They rushed back and were able to establish the link by 1:50 p.m., 10 minutes before sign-on.

Getting a signal from ABC headquarters in New York City was a challenge in the early days with no access to satellites. As a result, WILK set up a microwave tower in Effort, about east of Wilkes-Barre. From there, the network signal was bounced to the Penobscot Knob transmitter site. Often, station engineers had to adjust the Effort transmitter to accept a signal from WFIL-TV (now ABC O&amp;O WPVI-TV) in Philadelphia if they were unable to receive the New York feed.

WILK-TV and WARM-TV were both losing money, in large part because their network, ABC, was not on an equal footing with NBC and CBS (and would not be until the 1970s). However, they stayed on the air because they were owned by well-respected local radio stations.

===Merger and transition===
By 1955, however, it was obvious that Scranton and Wilkes-Barre were going to be a single television market. In late 1957, WILK-TV and WARM-TV agreed to merge into a single ABC station for Northeastern Pennsylvania. The merged station, then as now, operated under WILK-TV&#x27;s license, but used WARM-TV&#x27;s channel 16 in order to provide wider signal coverage at less cost—no small consideration given the station&#x27;s vast and mostly mountainous coverage area. Transcontinent Television Corporation, a Buffalo, New York–based media firm, acquired a 60 percent interest in the merged station; the remaining shares were split between the WARM and WILK groups, with William Scranton as chairman. The merged station, WNEP-TV, was licensed to Scranton, and split operations between WILK-TV&#x27;s former facility in Wilkes-Barre and a new studio in Scranton. In 1962, WNEP-TV consolidated its operations at a new studio near Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport in Avoca. WILK-TV&#x27;s transmitter site at Penobscot Knob was retained by WNEP-TV, and the WARM-TV transmitter was donated a decade later to the area&#x27;s PBS member station, WVIA-TV (channel 44).

Meanwhile, the WILK-TV facility was repurposed as a satellite repeater of WNEP-TV until late summer 1958. The channel 34 assignment was later reallocated to Binghamton, New York, to be occupied by ABC affiliate WBJA-TV (now WIVT) beginning in 1962.

Despite a power boost to 1.5 million watts, and an increased coverage area—expanded to 15 counties in northeastern Pennsylvania—WNEP-TV bounced back and forth in the ratings for most of the next two decades. It was never able to achieve any consistency because of the bitter rivalry between Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. Viewers in Wilkes-Barre thought it was a Scranton station, while viewers in Scranton thought it was a Wilkes-Barre station. It was also hobbled by being an affiliate of the smallest and weakest network of the time. Indeed, WNEP&#x27;s launch made Scranton–Wilkes-Barre the smallest market in Pennsylvania with full service from all three networks.

Transcontinent exited broadcasting in 1964 and sold several of its stations, including WNEP-TV, to Taft Broadcasting. When Taft purchased Philadelphia independent station WIBF-TV (channel 29, now WTXF-TV) in 1969, it sought a waiver to keep both stations. Channel 16&#x27;s Grade B signal reaches the Lehigh Valley, which is part of the Philadelphia market. WNEP-TV had also operated an outlying translator on channel 7 in Allentown for many years. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) normally did not allow one company to own two stations with overlapping coverage areas. While it initially granted the waiver, it reversed itself four years later and forced Taft to sell channel 16. A group of WNEP-TV station employees and executives formed NEP Communications, which bought the station from Taft in late 1973.

Soon after NEP took over the station, news director Elden Hale decided to take a regional approach. He billed the station as serving &quot;Northeastern and Central Pennsylvania&quot;, and stepped up coverage of the remote portions of the market. These areas had largely been ignored by the other stations in town. He also added the area&#x27;s first news helicopter. This approach quickly paid off. In November 1976, WNEP surged to first place for the first time in a decade. After briefly falling back to second it returned to number one in 1978, around the same time ABC became the nation&#x27;s number one network. Apart from a brief period in the mid-1990s when WBRE-TV passed it, it has been number one ever since. NEP also established a remote production company, which operated as an adjunct to WNEP-TV.

The New York Times Company bought the station in 1985. WNEP moved to its current studios in Moosic in 1989; the facility is similar to the building the Times Company built for then-sister station WHNT-TV in Huntsville, Alabama, but on a larger scale. NEP Communications retained the production unit, which became NEP Broadcasting; the company provided remote broadcast facilities for the Olympics, FIFA World Cup and the Academy Awards, as well as a studio production facility in New York City.

On January 4, 2007, the station, along with the rest of the Times Company&#x27;s television division, was sold to Oak Hill Capital Partners in a $575 million transaction. Oak Hill formed Local TV as a holding company for its stations.

On July 1, 2013, Local TV announced that its 19 stations would be acquired by the Tribune Company for $2.75 billion; Tribune owns &quot;The Morning Call&quot; in Allentown. Although Allentown is part of the Philadelphia television market, WNEP has long claimed the Lehigh Valley as part of its coverage area. The FCC ruled that Tribune could not keep WNEP due to its ban on newspaper-television cross-ownership within a single market, &quot;The Morning Call&quot; serving a city within WNEP&#x27;s coverage area (although Tribune has maintained cross-ownership waivers for its newspaper-television station combinations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and Hartford). Tribune spun off WNEP-TV to Dreamcatcher Broadcasting, an unrelated company owned by former Tribune Company executive Ed Wilson. However, Tribune will operate the station and provide other services under a shared services agreement, and will hold an option to buy back WNEP outright in the future. The sale was completed on December 27. Tribune later announced on July 10, 2013, that it would spin off its newspapers (including &quot;The Morning Call&quot;) into a separate company, the Tribune Publishing Company, in 2014, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. The split was completed in August 2014, though as of yet Tribune has not announced plans to acquire Dreamcatcher outright.

===Analog broadcast tower collapse===
WNEP-TV&#x27;s transmission tower broadcasting the analog signal on channel 16 collapsed on December 16, 2007, due to severe ice, winds, and snow at the transmitter location on Penobscot Knob. The tower collapse also destroyed the transmitter building. No one was injured during the incident. WCLH&#x27;s FM antenna and transmitter, which was co-located on WNEP&#x27;s analog TV tower, was also destroyed during the incident. Transmission of the digital signal on channel 49 was restored after a brief interruption of power to the tower supporting the digital transmitter and antenna. WNEP&#x27;s signal on local cable systems and satellite was restored later that day. WNEP-TV partially restored its analog over the air TV signal by January 1, 2008 by broadcasting from the nearby American Tower on Penobscot Knob supporting the WNEP-DT antenna as well as WOLF-TV/DT&#x27;s antenna.

As the WNEP-TV analog broadcast tower collapsed on December 16, 2007, one of the falling guy wires supporting the WNEP-TV tower damaged the neighboring tower broadcasting WVIA-TV (analog and digital) and WVIA-FM by shearing off the top section of the WVIA tower supporting the antenna for the analog and digital TV signals. The antenna for WVIA-FM remained intact, as it is located on the lower section of the shared WVIA-FM-TV tower. The WVIA-TV analog signal on channel 44 was temporarily put off the air until service was restored through a back-up tower on Penobscot Knob. The collapse of WNEP-TV&#x27;s analog tower also severed power to the transmitters for CBS affiliate WYOU (channel 22) and NBC affiliate WBRE-TV (channel 28), putting those stations off the air for a time.

On June 12, 2009, WNEP was to operate on a new tower which had been completed, though the antenna had not arrived in a timely fashion. Their goal was to have the new facility operating by August 2009, but it was delayed a few months. On December 5, 2009, WNEP turned off channel 49 and moved to channel 50. Moving to channel 50 was necessary so it could alleviate possible interference from Telemundo O&amp;O WWSI in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which at the time broadcast on UHF channel 49.

On February 15, 2010, the channel 49 facility was put back into use by WNEP on a temporary basis with FCC approval to accommodate WVIA-TV, which had suffered a partial tower collapse and electrical fire which had destroyed WVIA&#x27;s transmitter building and the equipment within.

===Aborted sale to Sinclair Broadcast Group===
On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group—which has operated Fox affiliate WOLF-TV (channel 56), CW affiliate WSWB (channel 38) and MyNetworkTV affiliate WQMY (channel 53) since October 2014—entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. The complicated SSA relationships that Sinclair has in the Scranton–Wilkes-Barre market with WOLF, WSWB and WQMY – the former two of which are currently the only legal television duopoly in the market – created an ownership entanglement, as WNEP and WOLF rank among the market&#x27;s four highest-rated stations, and the market has too few independently owned full-power stations to permit a second legal duopoly in any event. (Sinclair CEO Christopher Ripley cited Scranton–Wilkes–Barre as one of three markets, out of fourteen where ownership conflicts exist between the two groups, where the proposed acquisition would likely result in divestitures). To alleviate some of the regulatory issues that the deal incurred by selling certain stations to both independent and affiliated third-party companies, on April 24, 2018, Sinclair announced that it would sell the non-license assets of WOLF-TV, WQMY, and WSWB and the full assets of eight other stations – Sinclair-operated KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City, WRLH-TV in Richmond, KDSM-TV in Des Moines and WXLV-TV in Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point, and Tribune-owned WPMT in Harrisburg and WXMI in Grand Rapids – to Standard Media Group (an independent broadcast holding company formed by private equity firm Standard General to assume ownership of and absolve ownership conflicts involving the aforementioned stations) for $441.1 million. Sinclair concurrently exercised its option to buy WOLF-TV and WQMY to allow Standard Media Group – the latter of which, for regulatory purposes, would have continued to be licensed as a satellite of WOLF-TV – to acquire the stations outright; Standard would concurrently acquire the WOLF-TV license, which is permitted under FCC ownership regulations as WSWB is not ranked as one of the top-four stations in the market.

On July 18, 2018, the FCC voted to have the Sinclair–Tribune acquisition reviewed by an administrative law judge amid &quot;serious concerns&quot; about Sinclair&#x27;s forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties. Three weeks later on August 9, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, intending to seek other M&amp;A opportunities. Tribune also filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Antitrust Division over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties, and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell.

===Sale to Nexstar Media Group and resale to Tegna Inc.===
On December 3, 2018, Irving, Texas–based Nexstar Media Group—which has owned NBC affiliate WBRE-TV since 1997 and operated CBS affiliate WYOU-TV since 1996 (running the latter through a shared services agreement with Mission Broadcasting since 1998 after selling the license to acquire WBRE through a grandfathered LMA)—announced it would acquire the assets of Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. Nexstar was precluded from acquiring WNEP directly or indirectly, as FCC regulations prohibit common ownership of more than two stations in the same media market, or two or more of the four highest-rated stations in the market. (Furthermore, any attempt by Nexstar to assume the operations of WNEP through local marketing or shared services agreements would have been subject to regulatory hurdles that could have delayed completion of the FCC and Justice Department&#x27;s review and approval process for the acquisition.) As such, Nexstar was required to sell either WNEP or both WBRE and WYOU (separately as it would break the grandfathered LMA) to separate, unrelated companies to address the ownership conflict. On January 31, 2019, Nexstar announced that WNEP, along with WTKR and WGNT in Norfolk, Virginia, would be sold to independent third parties in order to address ownership conflicts involving existing Nexstar properties in both markets. On March 20, 2019, McLean, Virginia-based Tegna Inc. announced it would purchase WNEP from Nexstar upon consummation of the merger, as part of the company&#x27;s sale of nineteen Nexstar- and Tribune-operated stations to Tegna and the E. W. Scripps Company (the latter of which would acquire New York City&#x27;s WPIX, which would later be re-acquired by Nexstar) in separate deals worth $1.32 billion; along with Harrisburg sister station WPMT (which was also acquired by Tegna as part of the spin-offs). This made WNEP among the first television properties in Pennsylvania for Tegna. The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16, and was completed three days later.

==Local programming==
Many of the programs aired on WNEP have been in-house productions rather than syndicated shows. The most popular of these was a children&#x27;s program called &quot;The Land of Hatchy Milatchy&quot;. One of the hosts during its long run, Miss Judy (who replaced original host Nancy Berg in the 1960s), would tell children where to find their birthday gift live on the air. The show was the inspiration for a scene in the 18th episode of the second season of the TV series &quot;The Office&quot;, in which Michael Scott shows footage of him appearing as a child on a show called &quot;Fundle Bundle&quot;, hosted by &quot;Miss Trudy&quot;.

Another program, &quot;Uncle Ted&#x27;s Ghoul School&quot;, once employed Bill O&#x27;Reilly as a writer. He was also a reporter at the station for a brief period during the mid-1970s. WNEP also served as the local affiliate for the &quot;Bowling for Dollars&quot; and &quot;Dialing for Dollars&quot; formats, producing local versions of each.

Today, WNEP produces two in-house programs: &quot;Pennsylvania Outdoor Life&quot;, a show about hunting and fishing in Pennsylvania, and &quot;Home &amp; Backyard&quot;, a show about do-it-yourself home improvements, cooking and gardening. &quot;Pennsylvania Outdoor Life&quot; airs Sundays at 11 a.m. and &quot;Home &amp; Backyard&quot; airs Saturdays at 10 a.m. on WNEP. The station also participates in several local charity events, including the &quot;MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot; (which ended in 2014) and Scranton&#x27;s annual Santa Parade.

===News operation===
The station is best known for its local newscasts which are among the highest rated in the United States. It runs their newscasts under the branding of &quot;Newswatch 16&quot;. WNEP has led the ratings in northeastern Pennsylvania for most of the last 40 years and according to Nielsen data attracts more viewers than the other stations in the market combined. In 2000, the weekday morning program earned shares between 50 and 60 meaning that 50 to 60% of televisions in the market were tuned to this station. Their on-air personalities are well known in the area. Chief Meteorologist Tom Clark had been with the station since 1981 and was one of the region&#x27;s most popular broadcasters. He retired, and his final broadcast was on December 31, 2016. His wife Noreen, who was a meteorologist for the weekend news, had been with the station since 1982. She retired in April 2018. Marisa Burke, a native of nearby Danville, had been with the station since 1984 and solo anchored the noon news and co-anchored the weeknight 6 o&#x27;clock newscast with Scott Schaffer. She retired from WNEP on October 28, 2016.

WNEP-TV presently broadcasts 41 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours each weekday, 4 hours on Saturdays and four hours on Sundays). Recurring features of news broadcasts include the station&#x27;s scale model train set in the background of its weather deck and garden and the viewer response segment &quot;Talkback 16&quot;.

Like most stations at the time, WNEP aired local news at 6 and 11 p.m. It added a noon newscast, titled at first &quot;Midday 16&quot;, beginning January 12, 1981. A half-hour 5 p.m. newscast was added in September 1987, beating WYOU-TV&#x27;s 5:30 p.m. &quot;First News&quot; as the earliest evening option for news.

Fox requested most of its affiliates to air local news in 1990. However, area Fox affiliate WOLF-TV (then channel 38) did not have a studio large enough for an in-house news department. To satisfy this, WNEP began producing a nightly 10 o&#x27;clock newscast on WOLF-TV in 1991, known as &quot;Newswatch 16 at 10 on Fox 38&quot;. When the Fox affiliation moved from channel 38 to channel 56, the 10 o&#x27;clock news switched stations as well. It then became known as &quot;Fox 56 News at 10&quot; with a secondary title of &quot;Newswatch 16 at 10 on Fox 56&quot;. WNEP aired this broadcast from a secondary set at its studios.

The station runs a secondary service, known as &quot;WNEP 2&quot; (formerly &quot;Newswatch 16 Anytime&quot; and before that &quot;Newswatch 16 on Adelphia 63&quot;), on its second digital subchannel and area cable systems. This channel currently airs Antenna TV programming along with other local programming. WNEP was the only media outlet in the market to utilize a helicopter, known as &quot;Skycam 16&quot;, for news gathering purposes. The helicopter was operational from 1984 until being decommissioned in February 2009. The station airs the Pennsylvania Lottery televised nighttime drawings live seven nights a week, Mega Millions drawing Tuesdays and Fridays, and the live Powerball drawing on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

In March 2009, its weekday morning news at 6 added another two hours (7–9 a.m.) seen on WNEP 2. Also in March, the station started up-converting its news programs to 720p widescreen format becoming the first one in the area to make such a change. WNEP announced on August 6, 2009, that they would begin broadcasting a 4 p.m. newscast on September 8, known as &quot;Newswatch 16 at 4&quot;. In November 2009, after being unable to reach an agreement with WNEP on a contract extension, WOLF announced its intention to turn to WBRE to produce an hour-long 10 p.m. newscast beginning January 1, 2010. WNEP then announced that it would begin a 10 p.m. newscast on WNEP 2 on the same date.

On February 10, 2011, starting with the 4 p.m. newscast, WNEP premiered a new HD-ready set (newscasts remained in widescreen standard definition). On July 9, 2011, WNEP began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition starting with the 6 p.m. newscast, becoming the first station in the Scranton–Wilkes-Barre market to begin offering local newscasts in high definition. In early September 2011, WNEP expanded its 4 pm newscast to a full hour with an additional half-hour at 4:30 p.m.

Since 1994, the station has used as its new theme song an updated version of Al Ham&#x27;s &quot;Move Closer to Your World&quot;, which is composed by Cliff Schwarz. From 1979 to 1994, the station used the original theme, which is currently used by ABC O&amp;O WPVI-TV in Philadelphia. Following its purchase by Tegna, a Change.org petition was started asking viewers to sign the petition to ask Tegna not to drop the song in favor of Tegna&#x27;s proprietary &quot;C Clarity&quot; theme. On March 4, 2020, the station began using Tegna&#x27;s standardized news graphics but retained the Schwarz version of &quot;Move Closer to Your World&quot; as its theme as opposed to using &quot;C Clarity&quot;, seen somewhat as a compromise.

====Notable former on-air staff====
* Bill O&#x27;Reilly – reporter (1970s); former host of &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; on Fox News Channel
* Dan Patrick – reporter (1970s); later became sportscaster with KHOU in Houston; now Lieutenant Governor of Texas

==In popular culture==
A live interview by WNEP reporter Sofia Ojeda (later with Houston NBC affiliate KPRC-TV) on August 1, 2014, at the Wayne County Fair made a social-media sensation of 5-year-old Noah Ritter. WNEP&#x27;s video was later &quot;songified&quot; by The Gregory Brothers into the song &quot;Apparently.&quot;

John Oliver from HBO&#x27;s &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; mentioned the conflict of viewers over the station&#x27;s scale model train set in the background of its weather deck and garden (including &#x27;agree/disagree&#x27; comments on the station&#x27;s viewer comment line, which air in the newscasts&#x27; &quot;Talkback 16&quot; segment). This resulted in the show building a larger-scale train set for the station with the landmarks of Scranton and the surrounding area exaggerated. Though the station accepted it, it proved to be too large for the weather deck/garden, and was donated to Scranton&#x27;s Electric City Trolley Museum for display beginning in late September 2017, with some modifications (including its tunnel now being presented as Oliver&#x27;s mouth wide open rather than that of area native P. J. Carlesimo).

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
&lt;section begin=subs /&gt;

&lt;section end=subs /&gt;
The station became a charter affiliate of Antenna TV upon its launch on January 1, 2011. The network is carried on digital subchannel 16.2, replacing RTV on that subchannel.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WNEP-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 16, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 49, using virtual channel 16.

===Translators===
WNEP serves one of the largest coverage areas east of the Mississippi River. This area is very mountainous meaning that some areas cannot get a clear signal from the main transmitter on physical channel 21. As a result, it operates one of the largest translator systems of any station in the Eastern Time Zone.

W20EI-D and W29EU-D are owned by WVIA but broadcast the full WNEP/WVIA multiplex.

==Out-of-market coverage==

WNEP was carried for many years on the two cable providers in the Lehigh Valley until it was declared part of the Philadelphia (WPVI) market in January 2013. From then on both Service Electric and RCN decided to drop WNEP due to the inability to broadcast duplicate programming from two ABC affiliates. Many viewers in the Lehigh Valley now rely on an over-the-air signal from WNEP-TV&#x27;s Allentown translator.

In New York State, WNEP is carried on Charter Spectrum in Highland Lake in Sullivan County, which are part of the New York City market.

<text>The Bathtub refers to the underground foundation area at the site of the World Trade Center and accompanying buildings in New York City. The term bathtub is something of a misnomer, as the area does not hold any water; rather the purpose of its design is to keep water out. The name is more so used to describe its shape of a deep basin with high walls, like a bathtub.

==Description==

The Bathtub, built in 1967–1968, encompasses a large, roughly rectangular excavation down to bedrock surrounded by reinforced concrete walls, intended to serve as dams to prevent water intrusion from the nearby Hudson River (North River). It enclosed nearly the entire original World Trade Center. The World Trade Center site was located on man-made water-clogged landfill that had accumulated over centuries, providing an extension of land out onto the Hudson River from the original Manhattan shoreline, with bedrock located below. Manually removing water from this area would have severely altered the water levels surrounding the World Trade Center site and thus would have jeopardized the foundations of nearby buildings, causing them to sink. This is why the Bathtub method was used.

The Bathtub contains a site, including seven basement levels, the downtown terminal of the PATH rapid transit line, and the preexisting New York City Subway&#x27;s IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line (). The South Tower of the World Trade Center was actually built around the PATH tubes that passed through the foundation area, thus service was uninterrupted throughout the whole of the construction period. The waterproof walls were thick and high.

The excavated material that was dug up to build the bathtub was again used as landfill to construct Battery Park City, and the same method was also used to construct the foundation area of the Willis Tower in Chicago.

There are several structures that penetrate the Bathtub wall: DWV, utility systems, and PATH trains. Today, a passageway leads between Brookfield Place and the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.

==Problems==

Once constructed, the bathtub walls relied on the presence of the basement floors of the WTC to give lateral support. When these were partially destroyed following the collapse of the Twin Towers during the September 11 attacks, it was feared that removing the resulting debris pile could weaken the walls and cause them to fail, endangering workers and possibly compromising other buildings and flooding a significant portion of the subway system. During the recovery and clean-up operation, dangerous degradation of the walls was discovered, prompting an emergency operation to install tiebacks to the bedrock to shore up the bathtub walls. Excavation of a new Bathtub was conducted between 2006 and 2008, with the new Bathtub reaching underground.

<text>Alfred Whitford (Fred) Lerdahl (born March 10, 1943) is an American music theorist and composer. Best known for his work on musical grammar, cognition, rhythmic theory and pitch space, he and the linguist Ray Jackendoff developed the Chomsky-inspired generative theory of tonal music. 

Lerdahl has written numerous orchestral and chamber works, three of which were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize for Music: &quot;Time after Time&quot; in 2001, String Quartet No. 3 in 2010, and &quot;Arches&quot; in 2011. He is a Professor Emeritus of Musical Composition at Columbia University.

== Life ==
Alfred Whitford &quot;Fred&quot; Lerdahl was born on March 10, 1943, in Madison, Wisconsin.

Lerdahl studied with James Ming at Lawrence University, where he earned his BMus in 1965, and with Milton Babbitt, Edward T. Cone, and Earl Kim at Princeton University, where he earned his MFA in 1967. At Tanglewood he studied with Arthur Berger in 1964 and Roger Sessions in 1966. He then studied with Wolfgang Fortner at the Hochschule für Musik in Freiburg/Breisgau in 1968–69, on a Fulbright Scholarship. From 1991 to 2018 Lerdahl was Fritz Reiner Professor of Musical Composition at Columbia University; previously he taught at the University of Michigan, Harvard University, and the University of California at Berkeley. Lerdahl was awarded an honorary doctorate from Lawrence University in 1999. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Lerdahl&#x27;s maternal uncle was the astronomer Albert Whitford.
Lerdahl has written three books: &quot;A Generative Theory of Tonal Music&quot; (1983, second edition 1996, with linguist Ray Jackendoff, MIT Press), &quot;Tonal Pitch Space&quot; (2001, Oxford University Press), and &quot;Composition and Cognition&quot; (2019, University of California Press). He has also written numerous articles on music theory, music cognition, computer-assisted composition, and other topics.

Lerdahl&#x27;s music is published by Schott, and Bridge Records is producing an ongoing series of recordings of it. Lerdahl&#x27;s students include composers Christopher Buchenholz, Zosha Di Castri, R. Luke DuBois, John Halle, Huck Hodge, Arthur Kampela, Alex Mincek, Paul Moravec, Matthew Ricketts, Allen Shearer, Kate Soper, Tyshawn Sorey, Christopher Trapani, Carl Voss, Wang Lu, Eric Wubbels, and Nina C. Young; and music theorists Elizabeth Margulis and David Temperley.

==Music==
Lerdahl&#x27;s influences include the German classics, Sibelius, Schoenberg, Bartók, Stravinsky, Carter, Messiaen, and Ligeti. He has said he &quot;always sought musical forms of [his] own invention&quot;, and to discover the appropriate form for the intended expression. In &quot;Fanfare&quot;, Robert Carl wrote: &quot;Lerdahl is a profoundly musical composer, engaged in all his work in a rigorous and respectful dialogue with tradition, eager to imbue his pieces with the maximum of both information and clarity.&quot; Of Lerdahl&#x27;s composition &quot;Waves&quot;, Phillip Scott wrote, &quot;&quot;Waves&quot; is an orchestral scherzo. It conjures up (rather than depicts) the motion and the sense of waves, not merely of the oceanic variety but also those found on graphs: sound waves, heartbeats, and so on. It begins with a surge of activity and never lets up in its cascading scales and rapid figuration. Unlike Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La mer&quot;, whose deep-sea swells it recalls only fleetingly, it has no moments of repose.&quot;

<doc id="599798" wikidata="Q1230882" url="?curid=599798" title="Charioteer of Delphi">
<text>The Charioteer of Delphi, also known as &quot;Heniokhos&quot; (, the rein-holder), is a statue surviving from Ancient Greece, and an example of ancient bronze sculpture. The life-size (1.8m) statue of a chariot driver was found in 1896 at the Sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi. It is now in the Delphi Archaeological Museum.

==Background==
The statue was set up at Delphi, Greece to commemorate one of two victories of the tyrant Polyzalus of Gela in Sicily and his chariot in the Pythian Games of either 478 or 474 BC, which were held at Delphi in honor of Pythean Apollo. It has also been suggested that the complex was actually commemorating the victory of Polyzalos&#x27; brother, Hieron, at the same games in analogy to his ex voto after his victory at the Olympic Games. 

It was originally part of a larger group of statuary, including the chariot, at least four horses and possibly two grooms. Some fragments of the horses were found with the statue. The masterpiece has been associated with the sculptor Pythagoras of Rhegion who lived and worked in Sicily, Magna Graeci, as well as with the sculptor Calamis. The Sicilian cities were very wealthy compared with most of the cities of mainland Greece, and their rulers could afford the most magnificent offerings to the gods, as well as the best horses and drivers. It is however unlikely that the statue itself comes from Sicily. The name of the sculptor is unknown, but for stylistic reasons it is believed that the statue was cast in Athens. It has certain similarities of detail to the statue known as the Piraeus Apollo, which is known to be of Athenian origin.

An inscription on the limestone base of the statue shows that it was dedicated by Polyzalus, the tyrant of Gela, a Greek colony in Sicily, as a tribute to Apollo for helping him win the chariot race. The inscription, which is written in hexameter, reads: [...Π]ολύζαλος μ&#x27;ἀνέθηκ[ε... τ]ὸν ἄεξ εὐόνυμ&#x27;Ἀπόλλ[ον], which is reconstructed to read &quot;Polyzalus dedicated me. ... Make him prosper, honoured Apollo.&quot;

==Design and completeness==

Most bronze statues from ancient times have long been melted down for their raw materials or were naturally corroded, but the Charioteer survived because it was buried under a rock-fall at Delphi, which probably destroyed the site in 373 B.C. Some freestanding bronze statues, however, including the charioteer, have been rediscovered in the 20th century. On discovery the figure exhibited a bluish appearance which correlates with Plutarch&#x27;s description of the Spartan Monument from Delphi having an &quot;unusual blue and glossy patina, due to peculiarities of the air inside the sanctuary.&quot; After a century of indoor exposure the Charioteer has turned greenish, although the lower torso still preserves a bluish coloration. The statue remains mostly intact except that his left forearm and some details on the head are missing including the copper inlays on the lips and most of the silver eyelashes and headband. The statue is one of the few Greek bronzes to preserve the inlaid glass eyes. Greek bronzes were cast in sections and then assembled. When discovered, the statue was in three pieces—head and upper torso, lower torso, and right arm.

The figure is of a young man, as is shown by his soft side-curls. Like modern jockeys, chariot racers were chosen for their lightness, but also needed to be tall, so they were frequently teenagers. It seems that it represents a teenager from a noble family of his time; aristocratic chariot racers selected their drivers from glorious noble families in the Panhellenic Games. The Charioteer wears the customary long tunic (the &quot;xystís&quot;), reaching down to his ankles. A wide belt tightens the tunic high above the waist, while two other bands pass as suspenders over the shoulders, under the arms and criss-cross in the back. This is the &quot;analavos&quot; which keeps the garment from billowing in the wind during the race. The deep vertical pleats in the lower part of the tunic emphasize the Charioteer’s solid posture, resembling also the fluting of an Ionic column. On the upper part of the body, however, the pleats are wavy, diagonal or curved. This contrast in the garment representation is also followed by the body’s contrapuntal posture, so that the statue does not show any rigidity, but looks perfectly mobile and almost real. The entire statue is as if it is animated by a gradual shift to the right starting from the solid stance of the feet and progressing sequentially through the body passing the hips, chest and head to end up at its gaze. The hands are spread out holding the reins, with the long and thin fingers tightening – together with the reins – a cylindrical object, the riding crop. 

The Charioteer is not portrayed during the race, as in this case his movement would be more intense, but in the end of the race, after his victory, when – being calm and full of happiness – he makes the victory lap in the hippodrome. His attractive gemstone eyes evoke what Classical period Greeks called ethos and greatness. His motion is instantaneous, but also eternal. In spite of the great victory, there are no shouts, but a inner power. The face and the body do not have any instability; those have a great self-confidence.

Unusually for this era, the Charioteer is clothed head to foot. Most athletes at this time would have competed, and been depicted nude. The young man would have been of a lower status than his master Polyzalos, and Honour and Fleming have speculated that he may have been a household slave whom it was not appropriate to depict in the nude.

==Style==
Stylistically, the &quot;Charioteer&quot; is classed as &quot;Early Classical&quot; or &quot;Severe&quot; (see Greek art). The statue is more naturalistic than the kouroi of the Archaic period, but the pose is still very rigid when compared with later works of the Classical period. One departure from the Archaic style is that the head is inclined slightly to one side. The naturalistic rendering of his feet was greatly admired in ancient times. The introverted expression does away with the old &#x27;Archaic smile&#x27;.

==In popular culture==
In about 1907, some ten years after the discovery of the &quot;Charioteer&quot;, Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo, a Spanish artist-designer based in Venice, created a finely pleated silk dress that he named the Delphos gown after the statue, whose robes it closely resembled. These gowns are considered important pieces of early 20th century fashion and art objects in their own right. A Delphos gown was, in 2003, the only fashion garment in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

<text>Spellbinder () is a 1995 English-language fantasy adventure science fiction children&#x27;s television series, co-produced between Australia and Poland, and filmed in both countries. The series follows the adventures of Sydney high-schooler Paul Reynolds (Zbych Trofimiuk) as he is accidentally stranded in a parallel world where the industrial revolution never happened. Only a small number of people there have technology – the &quot;Spellbinders&quot; – and they pretend it is magic and use it to rule over everyone else, manipulating people&#x27;s fear and ignorance. Paul, with the help of a local girl called Riana (Gosia Piotrowska), uses his wits and his own knowledge of science to survive, whilst his high-school friends try to rescue him.

The series has 26 episodes of 30 minutes each, and was produced by Film Australia and Telewizja Polska, in association with the Australian Children&#x27;s Television Foundation (ACTF), who provide accompanying educational material for the series.

&quot;Spellbinder&quot; was shot on location in Australia (Sydney, and the Blue Mountains), and in Poland where most scenes of the parallel world were filmed in Kraków-Częstochowa Upland, Ogrodzieniec, Zawiercie, Czocha Castle, and Książ. Czocha Castle was used as the Spellbinder&#x27;s castle with Książ Castle serving for certain interior shots. The ruins of Ogrodzieniec Castle were used as the ruins of the Old Spellbinder&#x27;s castle.

&quot;Spellbinder&quot; won the Australian Film Institute&#x27;s Award for Best Children&#x27;s Television Drama in 1996. The series was also novelised by the creators, Mark Shirrefs and John Thomson, as &quot;Spellbinder Book 1: Riana&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Spellbinder Book 2: Paul&#x27;s World&quot;.

&quot;Spellbinder&quot; was followed by a second series, called &quot;&quot;, in which Heather Mitchell and Rafał Zwierz reprised their roles as the Spellbinder Ashka and her apprentice Gryvon respectively.

==Synopsis==
A group of teenagers go on a school camp in the Blue Mountains in Australia. While at the camp, Paul Reynolds accidentally goes into a parallel universe. This other world is inhabited by a more hierarchical and technologically different society, ruled by a group of people known as &quot;Spellbinders&quot;. Paul meets a girl there named Riana, and they become friends.

The Spellbinders have discovered the power to create and manipulate static electricity. They fly in gigantic copper-coloured machines that utilise large rotating orange crystals, presumably creating some form of magnetic levitation. The Spellbinders often use their power for good, but some abuse this power and use their discoveries for malevolence. One such malevolent Spellbinder is Ashka, who often manages to hide her true nature. Common people are often &quot;banished&quot; for their misdeeds, and sometimes Spellbinders are banished, also, if they are proven to have done wrong.

There is tension from Paul&#x27;s forays into the land of the Spellbinders and his attempts to return to his own universe, and also from conversations Paul has with his friends across the barrier between the two universes. Paul and Riana&#x27;s escapes also add tension, as do the interactions between Spellbinders.

Paul is eventually able to travel back home, but he is forced to take Riana with him in order to save her. Later, when Paul is able to take Riana back home, the Spellbinder Ashka follows Paul as he later returns home. Ashka seeks the unwitting help of Paul&#x27;s father in making her a new high-tech &#x27;flying suit&#x27; to replace her power suit in order to make her more powerful than the other Spellbinders.

However, Paul manages to expose her scheme and defeat Ashka, who is returned as an outcast to the Spellbinder world, while Riana becomes the new apprentice to Correon. In order to keep the Spellbinder world safe from the more advanced people from &quot;modern&quot; world, the gateway between the two universes is closed permanently.

==Cast and characters==

===Main===
* Zbych Trofimiuk as Paul Reynolds – a teenage boy from Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. His life was normal until a prank at a camp went wrong and he ended up in the land of the Spellbinders. At first, Paul was unsure of how to react to the new world, but he settled in quite quickly and was able to discover Ashka&#x27;s plot to rule the Spellbinders. Paul has some rough military skills, which, combined with the scientific knowledge from his father, makes him able to defeat Ashka.
* Gosia Piotrowska as Riana – she lives in the Spellbinder world. Her life was normal until the arrival of Paul. Despite getting off to a somewhat rocky start (Paul being mistaken for a Marauder), however Riana realises that Paul is not a Marauder after he rescues her from drowning in a river and returns her belongings. Riana quickly becomes Paul&#x27;s friend. She has very good survival skills and can use bolas and a spear. Riana cares very much for her family and is upset when she realises that they may be in danger. In Paul&#x27;s world, Riana is able to use some of her survival skills to help a newfound friend, and is known as &quot;Paul&#x27;s cousin from Iceland&quot;. Due to her role in Ashka&#x27;s defeat, Correon rewards Riana by making her his apprentice.
* Brian Rooney as Alex Katsonis – Paul&#x27;s best friend who knows the truth about what happened to Paul and tries his best to bring him back. In the course of the series, he also develops a relationship with his classmate Katrina, even though they are basically as opposite as they can be. Alex has an older brother, who is a mechanic but gets fired for unspecified reasons.
* Michela Noonan as Katrina Muggleton – brought up by strict parents, Katrina is academically smart at school but has tendencies of naivete. Believing that the Mount Lara lights do exist, she travels up to the cave and is the only other person to both see and believe Paul&#x27;s disappearance. She realises that the radios can be used to communicate and is able to succeed in helping to bring Paul home. In the second half of the season, Katrina becomes a friend to Riana, taking her shopping and introducing her to the trends of fashion. However, Katrina is easily tricked by Ashka into helping her.
* Heather Mitchell as Ashka – a Spellbinder. She mistakes Paul for a Marauder at first, throwing a power bolt at him, then, she realises, much to her surprise, that he is unaffected (the rubber soles of his sneakers insulated him) and chases after him. When she meets Paul at the castle and learns about fireworks, she blackmails Paul into giving her the secret of gunpowder, by holding the life of Riana and her family over his head. Paul tricks her twice and Ashka winds up in Paul&#x27;s world. In Paul&#x27;s world, Ashka is unfamiliar with all the new sights and sounds and this proves to be a slight disadvantage, however she winds up working with Paul&#x27;s father and creating a new power suit to take over the Spellbinder world. Ashka is ruthless and intimidating, and has the ability to create lies on the spot. Ashka misuses her power and authority for her own gain, and this leads to her downfall.
* Andrew McFarlane as Brian Reynolds – Paul&#x27;s spunk father. A scientist, Brian is usually more wrapped up in his work than his family, but eventually settles down. He refuses to believe that Paul is in another world. Even after Paul returns home, Brian instead believes his son is suffering a trauma. A single father, he shows a romantic interest in Ashka, not realising she is a Spellbinder or that she plans to overthrow the Regents. He helps her create a new power suit. He realises Paul has been telling the truth when he meets Riana and opens his eyes to Ashka&#x27;s true nature after she threatens Paul. When he realises his mistake, however, his knowledge helps bring Ashka down.
* Krzysztof Kumor as Correon – a Spellbinder and senior Regent. His studies are on how to repair flying ships and power suits. At first, he does not believe Paul and his claims about where he comes from. When he meets Riana, however, and she shows him the technology from Paul&#x27;s world via his camcorder, Correon realises that Paul is telling the truth and teams up with Paul and Riana to get Paul home. He calls Ashka a liar and is challenged by her, but he loses (because Ashka, desperate to get rid of Correon, cheated by having Gryvon sabotage his power suit.) and is stripped of his position and sent to the Wastelands where he is rescued by Zander (a supposed Marauder). Correon also reveals Ashka&#x27;s true nature to the Regents, by showing them Paul&#x27;s camera, which shows them Ashka&#x27;s actual motives. Correon is then reinstated as Spellbinder and senior Regent. He also is the one who introduces the Regents to a &quot;Marauder&quot; and plays a part in Ashka&#x27;s downfall in the Spellbinder world.
* Rafał Zwierz as Gryvon – Ashka&#x27;s apprentice. The son of the Clayhill Summoner and Ashka&#x27;s co-conspirator, Gryvon is selfish and sycophantic, and follows Ashka&#x27;s orders to the full. He is stripped of his apprenticeship after Ashka escapes and is punished by having to help repair Riana&#x27;s family cottage, which was burnt by Ashka. Despite the fact he is no longer an apprentice, he still assists Ashka in her plans, but in the end he is exiled just like her.

===Recurring===
* Joachim Lamża as Lukan, Spellbinder Regent
* Hanna Dunowska as Marna, Spellbinder Regent
* Piotr Adamczyk as Zander, a native boy of the Spellbinder world who is banished for making a flying toy (with Paul&#x27;s help), he later becomes a Marauder. He is the first of the Marauders to discover that the old Spellbinders were responsible for the Darkness and not the Marauders. Correon introduces him to the Regents as a real Marauder. He is impressed by Paul&#x27;s scientific knowledge on flight.
* Julia Biczysko as Arla, Riana&#x27;s younger sister
* Stanislaw Brejdygant as the Clayhill Summoner. He is Gryvon&#x27;s father and is in charge of keeping things order in Clayhill (the village where Riana and her family live). When Paul arrives in the Land of the Spellbinders, he is the first person Paul meets. The Summoner mistakes Paul for a Marauder, and Paul accidentally steals his eyestone. He is unaware of Gryvon helping Ashka in her plan to rule the Spellbinders, and is shocked when she threatens to burn his village.
* Erland Buchan as Jal, Riana&#x27;s younger brother

* Sława Michalewska as Maran, Riana&#x27;s mother. She does not trust Paul at first (having him sleep in the barn), but she eventually trusts him after he saves Jal from drowning via CPR. After Paul steals a power suit from the castle, Maran allows the Summoner to detain him. However, after hearing of Ashka&#x27;s plans for her family, Maran has a change of heart and helps Paul escape by drugging the Summoner and his men with a sleeping drug she slipped into their tea.

* Laurence Breuls as Smithy

==The Spellbinder&#x27;s world==

=== Conceptualization ===
The Spellbinder World was conceptualized as a speculative exercise of what might occur if a teenager was transported to a world in which the Industrial Revolution did not happen. To create a sense of mystery, series creators Mark Shirrefs and John Thomson, &quot;came up with the idea of the Spellbinders who kept control of their world by controlling knowledge&quot;. They decided that the Spellbinder world was undergoing a partially self-inflicted dark age following a civilizational collapse triggered by a man made ecological disaster. Series creators specify that the Spellbinders decision to control knowledge was because this world had almost been destroyed hundreds of years earlier by massive experiments with electromagnetism - like the dangers we face with nuclear power, and they feared that if knowledge got out of control, it would happen again. Of course, this also meant that they led privileged lives and privilege is hard to give up. The people Paul encounters in this world belong to a medieval-like society ruled by a group of magician-knights known as Spellbinders, who use ancient high-technology to rule over an ignorant serf population on the remaining inhabitable territory.

=== History ===
Very little is revealed about the history of the Spellbinder&#x27;s world. At some point in the distant past, a disaster befell the planet, leaving their land surrounded by a wasteland where nothing can survive. They refer to this disaster as &quot;the Darkness,&quot; and the ancestors of a group called the Marauders (raiders who live on the outskirts of their society, bordering on the wastelands) are blamed for the past catastrophe. Ancient Spellbinders were the ones actually responsible for the disaster, brought about by their own intellectual arrogance and desire for increasingly powerful weapons. Paul, the visitor from our world, speculates that &quot;the Darkness&quot; may have been the result of a nuclear winter, although this is not further elaborated upon. Regent Correon, with Paul&#x27;s help, discovers an ancient book that describes an experiment of the ancient Spellbinders that went horribly wrong, but this book is destroyed by Ashka before more can be learned.

The Spellbinder world appears to have entered technological stagnation following the disaster. The spellbinders rely and appear to understand some of their ancient technology, however their everyday lives were relatively simple by the standards of Paul&#x27;s world.

Paul&#x27;s visit may have changed the balance of power in the Spellbinder world. Regent Correon invites Riana to be his new apprentice, and Ashka and Gryvon are punished by being sent to a labour camp (as seen in &quot;&quot;) for their abuse of power. Although Correon was previously only interested in rediscovering the secrets of the Ancient Spellbinders, he now seems sympathetic to the problems of the people outside his castle, even deciding to share the Spellbinder&#x27;s knowledge with everyone outside the castle. The rigid hierarchy that defines the Spellbinder society may therefore be weakening, as Correon believes that &#x27;things must change around here&#x27;. However, Paul decides that future contact between the two worlds should be avoided in order to prevent Riana&#x27;s world from being exploited by his own.
The Spellbinder&#x27;s control least 10 settlements like Clayhill. They have two castles, one ruined in &quot;the Darkness.&quot;

=== Geography ===

There is limited information about the geography of the broader Spellbinder World. The country overseen by the spellbinders is relatively small, comprising an approximate area of 20,000 kilometres bordered by a vast, desert called the wasteland. The territory seems to have a largely continental climate, mostly forested with some mountains with some land dedicated to agriculture.

=== Government and Politics ===
The Spellbinder World is a feudalistic, authoritarian oligarchic technocracy, in which an elite group of technical experts, known as spellbinders rule over a technologically illiterate peasant population. The Spellbinders are, in turn, overseen by a committee of three Regents who reside in the Spellbinder castle. The regents appear to have absolute power, though they are subject to a Spellbinder Code and some rule of law. 

The Regents are indifferent to the plight of the people outside their castle, enforce a very rigid code of laws designed to protect their hegemony. They banish anyone who discovers or applies the principles of science. The basis of their power over the people is their technology, and they are ruthless in their desire to prevent anyone else from understanding it.

The Spellbinders are beset with internal conflict due to the deterioration of their technology. Because there are only a limited number of power suits and flying ships still in operation, only a select few can be Spellbinders at any given time. At one point, a major dispute is legally settled by a ritualised duel in which Spellbinders fire power bolts at each other; such duels were noted to be somewhat archaic, however. The loser of such a match is stripped of their Spellbinder status and exiled to the wastelands to die. The same punishment is also given to anyone who violates the law against engineering.

The period following &quot;the Darkness&quot; appears to have been a period of extended peace. There do not seem to be any other political entities in competition with the Spellbinders for authority. In fact, conflict was so uncommon that people in the spellbinder world considered the concept of war completely alien, with one person asking Paul &quot;what is a war?&quot;

There are two known factions in the Spellbinder world. In addition to the Spellbinders and their subjects, there is a group of raiders known as the Marauders. People who are banished to the wastelands are sometimes saved by, and then join the Marauders. It is unclear what the Spellbinders knew about the Marauders, prior to the events of &quot;Spellbinder.&quot; It seems that the Spellbinders considered the Marauders a powerful faction, with unknown technology, operating out of the wasteland. The Spellbinders also believed the Marauders were responsible for the events that lead to the &quot;Darkness.&quot; In reality, the Marauders were a collection of banished subjects who settled in a complex rock formation known as the &quot;Labyrinth.&quot;

=== Society ===
The Spellbinder World has a different class system than medieval societies in Paul&#x27;s Dimension. The Spellbinder world appears to operate according to a largely manorialistic system of land ownership. Pesants work the land and pay tribute to the Spellbinders.

The Spellbinders play an analogous roles to knights. Spellbinders take on squires, known as apprentices, who are given more privilege and respect than non-spellbinders. Apprentices learn all the secrets of the Spellbinder world and have to swear an oath to secrecy. If they break the oath, they are banished. However, they appear not to be given the hidden knowledge or access to a power suit until they are elevated to the rank of spellbinder, or if a spellbinder dies. Spellbinders and Apprentices are differentiated from the rest of society by their red and white tunics.

Villages appear to be administered by a local bailiff known as a Summoner. Summoners were permitted to use some spellbinder technology apparently to communicate with the Spellbinders. They were the only people, aside from Spellbinders, permitted to use eyestones or to approach summoning towers. This seemed to be a highly esteemed role, with Summoners taking on a somewhat higher social status than other non-spellbinders. Summoners are also responsible for recommending candidates for apprenticing. While exceptionally bright non-spellbinders are taken on as apprentices there is some degree of nepotism involved in the process though, as Gryvon is clearly only chosen to be an apprentice because his father is the Summoner of Clayhill.

Non-spellbinders who work in the castle as servants and guards are also distinguished by their uniforms. While it is said that working in the castle is a high honour, it is unclear whether servants get any additional privileges and based on Ashka&#x27;s behaviour with them, it is acceptable for Spellbinders to abuse them.

=== Economy ===
The economy of the spellbinder world appears to be largely agrarian. The Spellbinders actively discourage innovation of any kind, forbidding even rudimentary engineering. Consequently, there is no industry to speak of. They do not seem to have any monetary system and operate a barter economy, called “swapping”. Members of the different villages meet regularly at a market in Rivertown.

=== Science and Culture ===

The Spellbinder society appears to have diverged from Paul’s world, for two reasons. Firstly, the Spellbinders strictly control any knowledge they consider dangerous and forbid engineering and technology use by non-spellbinders. Second, the Spellbinder world has a unique resource known as power stones. Power stones are a kind of naturally occurring capacitor that are able of holding a large electrical charge. Experimentation with these stones seems to have allowed Spellbinders to develop sophisticated knowledge of electromagnetism, without the energy generating infrastructure necessary in Paul’s world. Consequently, they do not seem to have undergone the same trajectory of technological development that occurred in Paul’s world. They do not seem to have any knowledge of steam power or combustion, though the existence of flying ships and summoning towers would suggest they have some facility with industrial metallurgy.

As a result, the Spellbinder world seems to have developed high-technology without undergoing the same Industrial Revolution that occurred in Paul’s world. These had widespread effects on the Spellbinder World. Without combustion and with the aid of early flight, the Spellbinder world did not develop roads or other travel infrastructure. There do not seem to be any roads in the Spellbinder world and Riana considers roads a completely foreign concept. The Spellbinders also appear to have no knowledge of indoor plumbing, with their baths being filled manually, and Ashka asking Paul&#x27;s father &quot;where&#x27;s the outhouse.&quot; The Spellbinders also have no knowledge of gunpowder.

By contrast, the Spellbinders have sophisticated knowledge of electrical engineering and electromagnetism. Spellbinders developed electromagnetic power suits, long-distance radio communication, and metallic ships that used powerful magnetic fields in order to fly. The Spellbinders also have an advanced understanding of astronomy; Regent Coreon both knew about and had a Heliocentric model of the solar system in his rooms. It is unclear, however, what knowledge contemporary Spellbinders have about their own technology, with Regent Coreon noting that much of his activities are dedicated to re-learning lost Spellbinder knowledge. He notes most of their knowledge, particularly of power suits and flying machines was lost after a civilizational collapse. Their flying ships and power suits are falling into disarray as they frantically search to rediscover the knowledge lost to them.

The people of the Spellbinder world are ignorant of the true nature of the Spellbinders&#x27; technology. To them, their power suits and flying ships are magic. The Spellbinders exploit this belief in order to maintain control over the people and use them for labour.

==Spellbinder technology==

===Power suits===
The power suit is the central piece of Spellbinder technology. It is powered by a set of power stones, which can be recharged in the castle complex. By rubbing the cuffs of the suit together, a Spellbinder can generate and discharge a power bolt. In combat, the power suit can be worn with a small shield capable of deflecting power bolts. Although the technology is never fully explained, it is implied that the power suit increases the voltage of energy stored within the power stones and releases it in the form of static electricity. Curiously, while usually capable of immobilising or causing injury to anyone on the receiving end of a bolt, Paul survived a bolt impact unscathed at one point; a feat he put down to the rubber soles of his footwear insulating him and preventing the bolt from grounding through him.

Because the suit&#x27;s copper circuitry is mounted outside the suit, it is easily disabled by splashing it with water, causing a short circuit. The new power suit (named &#x27;Prototype KX4&#x27;) created by Brian in Paul&#x27;s world is able to repel the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, allowing it to fly. Its circuitry has also been sealed against being shorted out by exposure to water and power bolts are generated and discharged with the press of a button on the suit&#x27;s gauntlet, rather than striking wrist plates together to generate the static electricity. The keypad on the suit&#x27;s gauntlet can also control machines, such as a television and even an elevator. The new power suit however has a weakness of strong magnetic fields, just like the power suits in the Land of the Spellbinders.

===Power stones===
Power stones are the primary power source for Spellbinder technology. 
Spellbinders mine power stones. They are used to generate the power bolts released by power suits, and they are also used to create the magnetic fields that power flying ships. They are generally small, rectangular stones with an amber-hue, although the power stones found in flying ships are much larger. Power stones can be recharged by infusing them with electricity, which is done in the lower levels of the Spellbinders&#x27; castle. There is no analogous substance in Paul’s world.

===Summoning towers===
Summoning towers are large metal towers that resemble electrical transformers and radio towers. The primary purpose of the summoning tower is to contact the Spellbinders when they are needed. An eyestone is placed into a cradle at the base of the tower, which presumably amplifies the signal it generates. The summoning towers also produce a magnetic field used to give flying ships their &#x27;lift&#x27; (as evidenced when Paul shorts the main power stone in the castle, causing all flying ships to crash) and can be used as a landing pad for the flying ships.

===Eyestones===
Spellbinders communicate with each other with a handheld device called an eyestone. The device has an outer lattice bearing the Spellbinder insignia, and opens to reveal a small circuit board. An eyestone creates a weak radio signal, similar to a walkie-talkie. For communicating over great distances, an eyestone must be connected to a summoning tower. Village summoners are the only people besides the Spellbinders who are permitted to use eyestones.

===Flying ships===
The Spellbinders travel large distances in their metal flying ships. Unlike aeroplanes, which operate on aerodynamic principles, flying ships generate lift through powerful magnetic fields. Each flying ship is equipped with a pair of large power stones on either side, which rotate slowly as the ship moves. This motion creates a magnetic field powerful enough to repel against another magnetic field created by the summoning towers. Flying ships can be used for transportation and also to dust crops with pesticide. Although the technology that powers them is impressive, flying ships generally move somewhat slowly. By the time of Paul&#x27;s visit to the Spellbinder&#x27;s world, only six remain in operation.

===Compass===
Spellbinders use a small magnetic compass to navigate when travelling on foot or horseback. The compass contains a gyro device that is pulled into motion with a piece of string. The arrow of the compass then moves to detect north.

<doc id="599806" wikidata="Q2314657" url="?curid=599806" title="List of steel producers">
<text>This is a list of the largest steel-producing companies in the world mostly based on the list by the World Steel Association. The list ranks steelmakers by volume of steel production in millions of tons over time and includes all steelmakers with production over 10 million in 2021.

The World Steel Association features a list from its members every year. Due to mergers, year-to-year figures for some producers are not comparable. Not all steel is the same. Some steel is more valuable than other steel, so the volume is not the same as turnover.

Some of the world&#x27;s leading steel producers include China Baowu Group and ArcelorMittal. Notable players from China are HBIS Group, Ansteel Group, and Shagang Group. Japan&#x27;s Nippon Steel Corporation is renowned for quality. POSCO Holdings from South Korea is also a significant contributor. In India, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and SAIL are key players in the steel industry.

Steelmakers from multiple different countries, such as Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States, are included in the list associated with their volumes used as figures.

<doc id="599809" wikidata="Q720254" url="?curid=599809" title="Asado">
<text>() is the technique and the social event of having or attending a barbecue in various South American countries: especially Argentina, Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul), Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay where it is also a traditional event. An &quot;asado&quot; usually consists of beef, pork, chicken, , and ; all of which are cooked using an open fire or a grill, called a parrilla. Usually, red wine and side dishes such as salads accompany the main meats, which are prepared by a designated cook called the asador or parrillero.

==Coal and fire==

Usually the &quot;asador&quot; begins by igniting the charcoal, which is often made of native trees, avoiding pines and eucalyptus as they have strong-smelling resins. In more sophisticated &quot;asados&quot; the charcoal is of a specific tree or made on the coal of recently burned wood, which is also commonplace when having an &quot;asado&quot; in a campfire. In Uruguay, charcoal is not used, but instead direct embers or hot coals.

Cooking can be done &quot;al asador&quot; or &quot;a la parrilla&quot;. In the first case, a fire is lit on the ground or in a fire pit and surrounded by metal crosses (&quot;asadores&quot;) that hold the entire carcass of an animal splayed open to receive the heat from the fire. In the second case, a fire is made and after the charcoal has formed, a grill with the meat is placed over it.

===Embutidos and achuras===
In many &quot;asados&quot;, &quot;chorizos&quot;, &quot;morcillas&quot; (black pudding), &quot;chinchulines&quot; (cow chitterlings), &quot;mollejas&quot; (sweetbreads), and other organs, often accompanied by &quot;provoleta&quot;, would be served first while the cuts that require longer preparations are still on the grill. Sometimes these are served on a charcoal &quot;brasero&quot;. &quot;Chorizos&quot; may be served with &quot;pan felipe&quot; or baguette bread, often called &quot;choripán&quot;.

===Meats===

After appetizers, &quot;costillas&quot; or &quot;asado de tira&quot; (ribs) can be served. Next comes &quot;vacío&quot; (flank steak), &quot;matambre&quot; and possibly chicken and &quot;&quot; (goatling). Dishes such as &quot;pamplona&quot;, pork, and Patagonian lamb are becoming more frequent, particularly in restaurants. An &quot;asado&quot; also includes bread, a simple mixed salad of, for instance, lettuce, tomato, and onions, or it could be accompanied with &quot;verdurajo&quot; (grilled vegetables), a mixture made of potatoes, corn, onion, and eggplant cooked on the grill and seasoned with olive oil and salt. Beer, wine, soft drink, and other beverages are common. Dessert is usually fresh fruit.
Another traditional form to mainly roast the meat, used in Patagonia, is with the whole animal (especially lamb and pork) in a wood stick nailed in the ground and exposed to the heat of live coals, called &quot;asado al palo&quot;.

The meat for an &quot;asado&quot; is not marinated, the only preparation being the application of salt before or during the cooking period. Also, the heat and distance from the coals are controlled to provide a slow cooking; it usually takes around two hours to cook &quot;asado&quot;. Further, grease from the meat is not encouraged to fall on the coals and create smoke which would adversely flavour the meat. In some &quot;asados&quot; the area directly under the meat is kept clear of coals.

The &quot;asado&quot; is usually placed in a tray to be immediately served, but it can also be placed on a brasero right on the table to keep the meat warm. &quot;Chimichurri&quot;, a sauce of chopped parsley, dried oregano, garlic, salt, black pepper, onion, and paprika with olive oil, or &quot;salsa criolla&quot;, a sauce of tomato and onion in vinegar, are common accompaniments to an &quot;asado&quot;, where they are traditionally used on the offal, but not the steaks.

Food is often accompanied by salads, which in &quot;asado&quot; gatherings are traditionally made by women on site or brought to the &quot;asado&quot; from their homes while the men focus on the meats. Salad Olivier (&quot;ensalada rusa&quot;) is one of the most common salads served at &quot;asados&quot;. In Paraguay chipa guasu, sopa paraguaya and boiled manioc as a side dish are also served.

== Variations ==
In Chile, the normal version &quot;cordero al palo&quot; (whole roast lamb) is usually accompanied with &quot;pebre&quot;, a fresh dip-style salad made from diced tomatoes, coriander, garlic, and hot peppers. This lamb dish is typical of southern Chile and is served hot accompanied by salads. A whole lamb is tied to a spit and is then roasted perpendicular on a wood fire. The preparation lasts around 5 hours since cooking must be constant and on a low heat.

In Brazil, &quot;asado&quot; is called &quot;&quot;, although the cooking is usually faster. Grilled and salted meat in Brazil is generally called &quot;carne assada&quot; and is often cut into small strips and served on a plate or cutting board in the middle of the table for all to partake. Various grilled meats, pork, sausages and occasionally chicken are also passed around from table to table on a spit and a slice is offered to each person. This is called &quot;rodizio&quot; because each person partakes in turn. Charcoal is predominantly used instead of embers of wood, and Brazilians tend to cook the meat on skewers or grills. The meat of Rozidio is usually seasoned with salt alone.

In Mexico, there is similar tradition of as &quot;parrilladas&quot; or &quot;carne asadas&quot;, which incorporates various marinated cuts of meat, including steaks, chicken, and sausages (&quot;chorizo&quot;, &quot;longaniza&quot;, and &quot;moronga&quot; being especially popular). These are all grilled over wood charcoal. Vegetables are also placed over the grill, especially green onions (&quot;cebollitas&quot;), &quot;nopales&quot;, and corn (elote&quot;).&quot;

Again, in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, some alternatives are the &quot;asado al disco&quot; and &quot;asado al horno de barro&quot;, especially in the countryside. The recipe does not change, only the way of cooking. In the &quot;asado al disco&quot; (the worn-out disc of a plough) is used. Being metallic and concave, three or four metallic legs are welded and with hot coal or lumber below it is easily transformed into an effective grill. Food is put in a spiral, in such a way that the fat naturally slips to the center, preserving the meat for being fried. Bell peppers and onions are usually put next to the edge, so that they gradually release their juices on the meat. The &quot;asado al horno de barro&quot; differs from tradition, as an adobe &quot;horno&quot; (oven, called tatakua in Paraguay) is used. These ovens are a common view in Argentine and Paraguayan &quot;estancias&quot;; their primary function is to bake bread, chipa guasu and sopa paraguaya, but they are well suited for roasting meat. Pork suckling and, less commonly, lamb are served, as they are more unlikely to become dry. Another way of cooking the asado is inside a &quot;chulengo&quot;, an oil barrel (or similar) cut in half, inside which the grill is placed to protect both the meat and fire from heavy winds. This makes the &quot;chulengo&quot; especially useful in the Patagonia region, although it is also used in other areas for practicality and the ability to move it around.

==Similar terms in other cuisines==
South American &quot;asado&quot; should not be confused with &quot;asado&quot; in the Philippines, which refers to two different braised dishes: &quot;asado de carajay&quot;, which is braised meat with vegetables in a savory stew; and pork &quot;asado&quot;, which is a sweet braised version of &quot;char siu&quot;. The equivalent of Latin American &quot;asado&quot; barbecues in Philippine cuisine would be the various &quot;inihaw&quot; dishes (also known as &quot;sinugba&quot; or &quot;inasal&quot;).

In Portugal, a roasted fish dish served with sausages and bacon is also known as &quot;assado&quot;.

In Goa, roast beef is called &quot;assad&quot;, from Portuguese &quot;assado&quot;.

In South Africa, a whole meat carcass cooked with the &quot;al asador&quot; method is called asado spit braai or .

<text>Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin (Saguinus geoffroyi), also known as the Panamanian, red-crested or rufous-naped tamarin, is a tamarin, a type of small monkey, found in Panama and Colombia. It is predominantly black and white, with a reddish nape. Diurnal, Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin spends most of its time in trees, but does come down to the ground occasionally. It lives in groups that most often number between three and five individuals, and generally include one or more adults of each sex. It eats a variety of foods, including insects, plant exudates, fruits and other plant parts. Insects and fruits account for the majority of its diet, but exudates are also important. But since its teeth are not adapted for gouging trees to get to the sap, it can only eat exudates when they are easily available.

Although a variety of reproductive methods are used, the most common is for a single adult female in the group to be reproductively active and to mate with multiple adult males in the group. After a gestation period of about 145 days, she gives birth to either a single infant or twins. Males contribute significantly to care of the infants. Sexual maturity is reached at about 2 years, and it can live up to 13 years. Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin is classified as being &quot;near threatened&quot; by the IUCN.

== Taxonomy ==

Like the other tamarins and marmosets, Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin is a New World monkey classified within the family Callitrichidae. In 2001, Colin Groves included the Callitrichids in the family Cebidae, which also includes capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys, but in 2009 Anthony Rylands and Russell Mittermeier reverted to older classifications which considered Callitrichidae a separate family. It is a member the genus &quot;Saguinus&quot;, the genus containing most tamarins. There are no recognized subspecies. In 1977, Philip Hershkovitz classified Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin as a subspecies of the cotton-top tamarin (&quot;Saguinus oedipus&quot;), which resides exclusively in Colombia, based on fur coloration, cranial and mandibular morphology, and ear size. However, more recent research indicates that the two taxa differ sufficiently to be considered separate species. According to genetic analyses, the two species diverged approximately 1.2 million years ago.

== Physical description ==

In common with other callitrichids (tamarins and marmosets), Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin is a small monkey. With a length of between , excluding the tail, it is the smallest Central American monkey. The tail length is between . Males have an average weight of , and females are slightly larger on average, with an average weight of . The fur on its back is variegated black and yellow, with pale legs, feet and chest. Its face is nearly bare, but the head has reddish fur with a triangle-shaped patch in the front of the head. The tail is chestnut-red and has a black tip.

== Behavior ==

Like all callitrichids, Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin is diurnal and arboreal. Unlike some other New World monkeys, it does come down to the ground occasionally. This is normally done only in special circumstances, such as to acquire certain foods or to get to a tree it cannot otherwise reach. Group size is generally between three and nine monkeys, with three to five being most common. Groups often consist of more than one adult of each sex. Adults of both sexes migrate between groups. Groups show some degree of territorial defense. Population densities on Barro Colorado Island in Panama range between 3.6 and 5.7 monkeys per square kilometer, but in other areas the population density can be as much as 20 to 30 monkeys per square kilometer. On average, Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin ranges 2061 meters per day. Home range size varies between 9.4 hectares and 32 hectares.

Communication occurs both through vocalization and by visual gestures. Vocalizations that have been recorded include whistles, twitters, trills, loud or soft sharp notes, sneezes and long rasps. Body postures and displays that reveal more of the white coloration, such as standing on hind legs and piloerection, tend to be associated with aggression. Females often signal willingness to mate by rapidly coiling their tails.
Unlike squirrels, which often move through the canopy by climbing and descending vertical tree trunks, Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin generally avoids large vertical supports during travel. It prefers to move across thin branches, ascending and descending by long leaps. To the extent Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin uses large vertical supports for travel, it uses them most often for ascending rather than descending.

Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin generally avoids sympatric small and medium size monkey species such as the white-headed capuchin and the Panamanian night monkey. Avoidance is spatial with respect to the capuchin, and temporal in the case of the night monkey, since Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin is only active during daylight hours and the Panamanian night monkey is only active at night. Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin is rarely observed in the vicinity of squirrels, although this appears to be the result of the squirrels avoiding interactions with the larger tamarins. Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin generally attempts to escape when birds of prey approach, regardless of whether the bird presents a true danger. However, the tamarins ignore one bird of prey, the double-toothed kite, which sometimes follows the tamarins in an apparent effort to feed on small animals disturbed by the tamarins.

The diet of Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin is similar to some species of tyrant flycatcher birds in Panama, and they share similar vocalizations. The tamarins may use the flycatcher calls to help find favorable food sources. The flycatchers and tamarins have different patterns of activity, which minimizes competition for similar food sources. The flycatchers are most active shortly after dawn and tend to rest in the middle of the day. The tamarins do not become active until about 45 minutes after full daylight, but remain active for most of the remaining daylight hours until an hour or less before sunset.

=== Diet ===
Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin has a varied diet that includes fruits, insects, exudates (gums and saps), and green plant parts. The diet varies seasonally. A study by Paul Garber estimated that the diet was made up of 40% insects, 38% fruit, 14% exudates (almost entirely from &quot;Anacardium excelsum&quot; cashew trees), and 8% other items. Another study, on Barro Colorado Island, showed 60% fruit, 30% insects and 10% green plant parts, including large amounts of elephant ear tree (&quot;Enterolobium cyclocarpum&quot;) sap. Another study showed a diet about equally split between insects (mostly grasshoppers) and fruit. Unlike marmosets, tamarins do not have dentition adapted for gouging trees, so Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin eats sap only when it is easily accessible. It generally hunts for insects by making quick movements on thin, flexible supports. In contrast, it generally feeds on sap while clinging to large vertical tree trunks.

In one study, Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin drank water from the corollas of &quot;Ochroma limonesis&quot; flowers. However, it is believed to also drink from tree holes, similar to other tamarin species.

== Reproduction ==

Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin can give birth throughout the year, but the birthing peak is from April to June. A single infant or twins can be born, although it is not uncommon for one of the twins to perish within the first few months. The gestation period is believed to be about 145 days, similar to the cottontop tamarin. The interbirth period ranges between 154 and 540 days, with an average of 311 days. The longer interbirth periods occur after twins. Infants weigh between and are born fully furred. The infant&#x27;s fur is colored differently than the parents&#x27;; the infant has black fur on the body and tail, with a beige blaze and white face. The infant coloration reduces the visibility of white, which is associated with aggressive displays by the species.

Both polyandrous and polygynous mating occurs, and males contribute heavily to parental care. But typically, only one adult female in a group is reproductively active, and reproductively active females mate with multiple males if given the opportunity. Males carry and groom infants more than females do. Older siblings may also contribute to infant care, although infants prefer to be carried by their parents than their siblings. Infants become mobile at 2 to 5 weeks, and begin eating solid food at 4 to 7 weeks. They are independent at 10 to 18 weeks and are fully weaned at 15 to 25 weeks. Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin becomes sexually mature at about 2 years, and can live up to 13 years.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin lives in various types of forest, including primary and secondary forest, and dry and moist tropical forest. In Panama, it prefers secondary forests with moderate humidity. It occurs in central and eastern Panama, with the range extending slightly west of the Panama Canal zone and has been observed as far west as Altos de Campana National Park. It is less common on the Atlantic coast of Panama than the Pacific coast, and is only abundant on the Atlantic coast in areas near the Canal zone that have been modified by man. It occurs in Metropolitan Natural Park, an urban park within Panama City. In Colombia, it occurs on the Pacific coast west of the Andes, south to the Rio San Juan. The eastern boundary of its range in Colombia was once thought to be the Rio Atrato, but has been reported further east, including the Las Orquídeas National Natural Park. Older sources sometimes report the species occurring in southern Costa Rica, but these are most likely erroneous.

== Conservation status ==

The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin as being near threatened. The main threat is deforestation, which is causing population declines in some areas despite its ability to adapt to some modifications of its habitat. It is also sometimes hunted and captured for the pet trade in Panama. A 1985 study in Panama concluded that Geoffroy tamarin population densities are higher in areas where human access is limited. Human activity in Panama can have both positive and negative effects on Geoffroy&#x27;s-tamarin populations. While hunting decreases the population, cutting mature forest for agriculture provides more areas of secondary growth, which is beneficial for the tamarin.

<text>Virgil Keel Fox (May 3, 1912 in Princeton, Illinois – October 25, 1980 in Palm Beach, Florida) was an American organist, known especially for his years as organist at Riverside Church in New York City, from 1946 to 1965, and his flamboyant &quot;Heavy Organ&quot; concerts of the music of Bach in the 1970s, staged complete with light shows. His many recordings made on the RCA Victor and Capitol labels, mostly in the 1950s and 1960s, have been remastered and re-released on compact disc in recent years. They continue to be widely available in mainstream music stores.

==Birth and studies==

Virgil Fox was born on May 3, 1912, in Princeton, Illinois, to Miles and Birdie Fox, a farming family. Showing musical talent at an early age, he began playing the organ for church services as a ten-year old as well as at a local movie theater &quot;APOLLO THEATER&quot; owned by his father. Four years later, Fox made his concert debut before an audience of 2,500 at Withrow High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. The program included one of the mainstays of 19th-century organ music: Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Sonata No. 1 in F minor&quot;.

From 1926 to 1930, he studied in Chicago under German-born organist-composer Wilhelm Middelschulte. His other principal teachers were Hugh Price, Louis Robert, and (once he had moved to France) Louis Vierne and Marcel Dupré. He was an alumnus of the Peabody Institute of Music in Baltimore, where he became the first student to complete the course for the Artist&#x27;s Diploma within a year, at age 18. By the age of nineteen, he had already performed for enthusiastic audiences at London&#x27;s Kingsway Hall and New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall.

==Early career==
Beginning in 1936, Fox was organist at Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Baltimore while teaching at Peabody. During August and September, 1938, he played in Great Britain and Germany; Fox was the first non-German organist given permission to perform publicly in the Thomaskirche in Leipzig—a special occasion, since Bach served as cantor of the Thomaskirche until his death in 1750. He also served as head of Peabody&#x27;s Organ Department from 1938 until 1942.

==Military service==
During World War II, Fox enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces and took a leave of absence from Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Baltimore and the Peabody. He was promoted to staff sergeant and played various recitals and services at the request of Eleanor Roosevelt. He served on her Home Hospitality Committee and entertained returning troops who were in Walter Reed Hospital, by playing a piano he pushed around, and joining in with two others. They sang funny and rather raunchy songs to the bedridden. After having played more than 600 concerts while on duty, he was discharged from the Army Air Forces in 1946.

==Riverside Church==

Fox then served as organist at the prominent Riverside Church in New York City, from 1946 to 1965. The church&#x27;s original Hook and Hastings organ installed in 1930 was rebuilt at his insistence by famed organ builder G. Donald Harrison, Master Builder of the Mormon Tabernacle organ plus others. Under his direction, the Riverside organ was expanded to become one of the largest in North America. His hymn accompaniments at Riverside&#x27;s Sunday services and concert performances were widely acclaimed, and fans would wait after church services for hours to meet him.

While serving regularly at Riverside Church, Fox also performed at several other concert venues. As a representative of the U. S. Department of State, he performed at the First International Conference of Sacred Music held in Bern, Switzerland in 1952. In 1962, he also appeared with his fellow organists E. Power Biggs and Catherine Crozier to inaugurate the newly installed organ at Philharmonic Hall in New York City&#x27;s Lincoln Center. Over the years, he was even invited to perform at the White House as a pianist on three separate occasions.

Recordings made during this period brought his playing to larger audiences. They included Fox&#x27;s unique interpretation of works by Bach, Handel, Fibich and Léon Jongen. In 1965, Fox left Riverside Church to devote himself to concertizing full-time.

==Concert tours==
From 1970 until 1978, Fox performed his famous &quot;Heavy Organ&quot; concerts in auditoriums, popular music concert halls, and other nontraditional organ music venues, touring around the United States with a rented electronic Rodgers Touring Organ. Later on he used his own instrument, a massive four-manual, custom-designed Allen Organ (1977–1980). The Heavy Organ concerts exclusively featured works of Johann Sebastian Bach accompanied by a large-scale light show, &quot;Revelation Lights&quot; by David Snyder, that was synchronized with the music, thereby bringing together aural and visual elements. The spectacle attracted enthusiastic audiences numbering in the thousands, but was not without its critics. William F. Buckley was reported by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as saying Fox, &quot;must have figured that it was more important to fill the house with listeners who would hear Bach for the first time than worry about those who would resolve, like me, to have heard Fox for the last time&quot;.

During this period, half of Fox&#x27;s performances were &quot;Heavy Organ&quot; concerts accompanied by &quot;Revelation Lights&quot;, with the virtuoso organist speaking informally to the audiences, and half were traditional classical music. In the latter category, a Fox recital at Lakeland University in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, was typical: he played Julius Reubke&#x27;s monumental &quot;Sonata on the 94th Psalm&quot;, Charles Ives&#x27; &quot;Variations on &quot;America&quot;&quot;, the &quot;Libera Me&quot; movement from Fauré&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, Bach&#x27;s &quot;Adagio and Fugue in a minor&quot;, and Henri Mulet&#x27;s &quot;Thou Art the Rock&quot;, among others. In a rave review, the &quot;Sheboygan Press&quot; critic was effusive in her praise, calling the recital &quot;electrifying&quot;. She reported that the &quot;packed house, cheering and clapping, insisted on three encores that gave the night its stunning climax&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that Fox earned between per performance (equivalent to in 2025, when adjusted for inflation).

Fox also continued to concertize in more traditional concert settings as well. In 1974, he appeared in the inaugural recital of a new Rodgers organ at Carnegie Hall after assisting in its design. In the winter of 1975 he returned to Carnegie Hall and appeared with the American Symphony orchestra under the baton of Richard Westenburg in the Alerbert Schweitzer Centennial Concert. Several years later in 1977 he also performed in a sold-out concert featuring the music of Bach at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.
Fox was one of the rare organists to perform on nationally televised entertainment programs in the 1960s and 1970s, such as &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, and &quot;CBS Camera Three&quot;, bringing organ masterworks to mass audiences as no other organist had done before. In 1975, he was also interviewed by the music critic Robert Sherman on his &quot;Great Artists Series&quot; program on WQXR radio in New York City. His last commercially released recording, though unauthorized, was made at his return (by popular demand) to Riverside Church in concert on May 6, 1979.

In his 50th year of performing on the organ, Fox gave his final public performance with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra on September 26, 1980, although he was racked with pain from metastasized prostate cancer that resulted in his death the following month.

==Music==
Fox always stressed pushing the limits of the instruments available to him, rather than requiring that they, or his playing, be authentic to the era of the music. His style (particularly his taste for fast tempos, intricate registrations, and a willingness to luxuriate in sentimentality) was in contrast to that of many of his contemporaries, such as E. Power Biggs.

Fox was also famous for his musical memory, and could instantly recall over 200 concert works. He played all concerts from memory and very rarely read from written scores even when playing alongside an orchestra.

Many organists, however, strongly criticized Fox for his unconventional interpretations of classical organ music. On his album &quot;Heavy Organ: Bach Live at Winterland&quot;, Fox defended his approach to Bach and organ music in general, in the introduction to the ubiquitous Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, by Johann Sebastian Bach; Virgil always spoke to his audiences about Bach&#x27;s reason for his compositions being his belief in Jesus and everlasting life whenever he performed his music.

For once making a similar speech at one of his recitals, music critic Alan Rich called him &quot;the Liberace of the organ loft&quot;, and severely took him to task in &quot;New York Magazine&quot;.

Despite (or perhaps because of) his controversial approach to organ music, Virgil Fox attained a celebrity status not unlike that of Leonard Bernstein and Glenn Gould. The New York &quot;Times&quot; said of him, 20 years after his death, &quot;Fox could play the pipe organ like nobody&#x27;s business, but that is not all that made him unforgettable to so many people across the country. He made classical organ music appeal even to audiences that normally wouldn&#x27;t be expected to sit still for it.&quot;

==Honors==
Fox was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity. He designed the 1964 Reuter Pipe Organ at Bucknell University and was awarded a Doctorate Degree. He was given Keys to the City in numerous acts of gratitude by Mayors of numerous cities.

==Death and legacy==

Fox had surgery for prostate cancer in December 1975 and later underwent radiation treatments after it was found to have metastasized. He was greatly debilitated and in considerable pain from the disease when he gave his final performance on September 26, 1980, with the Dallas Symphony. Near collapse the morning after the concert, he was rushed back to Florida by private airplane from Texas to be hospitalized near his Palm Beach home, &quot;Casa Lagomar&quot;, and the remainder of his planned concert tour was cancelled. Fox died on October 25, 1980, followed by a private funeral held at Casa Lagomar conducted by his longtime assistant and adopted son, David Snyder. A large-scale public funeral service was subsequently held at the Crystal Cathedral in California, where Fox lay in state. His remains were cremated and his ashes are interred at Pioneer Cemetery, Dover, Illinois, next to his grandparents.

In a sign of continued recognition unusual for a performer (as distinct from a composer), Virgil Fox memorial recitals and concerts have been staged years after his death. In May 1990, for example, a Virgil Fox Memorial Concert was given at the Crystal Cathedral organ by Frederick Swann, who was his successor at Riverside Church. On what would have been Fox&#x27;s 80th birthday, a special tribute in his memory was broadcast by KBYU-FM in Provo, Utah. Entitled &quot;Virgil Fox: American Virtuoso&quot;, the May 3, 1992, radio program, produced almost twelve years after his death, included an excerpt of Swann&#x27;s Crystal Cathedral memorial of 1990 and highlighted a virtuoso performance of Joseph Jongen&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Concertante&quot; by Fox in Tokyo, Japan, recorded fifteen years previously. Also that month, an &quot;Organ Greats Virgil Fox and E. Power Biggs&quot; concert was held at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. In 2012, the centennial year of his birth, a tribute to Fox was included in an organ concert held at a church in Vancouver, Canada. Many of his recordings have been re-mastered and are widely available on compact discs, as well as regularly heard on radio programs featuring organ music, such as &quot;Pipedreams&quot; and &quot;Sacred Classics&quot;.

A compilation of Fox&#x27;s arrangements of organ works by J. S. Bach, George Frideric Handel, Franz Liszt, Camille Saint-Saens and Richard Wagner was published by Alfred Music Publishing in 1994. &quot;At the Organ with Virgil Fox&quot; contains several musical scores of some of Fox&#x27;s most frequently performed works along with his markings, registrations, and transcriptions for students of the organ.

Biographies written about Fox after his death include the controversial &quot;Virgil Fox (The Dish): An Irreverent Biography of the Great American Organist&quot; (2001) by his former manager, Richard Torrence (2001), and &quot;Virgil Fox — His real life... with secrets you never knew&quot; (2020) by David Snyder. The Virgil Fox Society, formed to perpetuate his memory, established the Virgil Fox Scholarship under the auspices of the American Guild of Organists in 2002.

<text>Gap financing is a term mostly associated with mortgage loans or property loans. It is an interim loan given by a bank to a person until they can get money from somewhere else, often so that they are able to buy another house before they sell their own.

== Overview ==
More specifically, gap financing is subordinated temporary financing paid off when the first mortgagee disburses the full amount due under the first mortgage loan. This is normal in a situation involving a permanent “floor-ceiling loan,” where the borrower does not meet a rent-roll requirement, and the first mortgagee funds only a floor amount, agreeing to fund the balance in the event the rent-roll requirement is met within a stated period. In this case, the gap lender is often the construction lender. Where the gap lender has agreed prior to construction to make the gap loan, the document that ties together the construction loan, the gap loan, and the permanent loan is the buy-sell agreement. In this agreement, a special provision is inserted providing that if the permanent lender&#x27;s rent-roll holdback is not fulfilled at the time for the permanent closing, the construction lender agrees to disburse, at a concurrent closing date, funds equal to the amount withheld by the permanent lender pursuant to its commitment. These gap funds are normally evidenced by a promissory note secured by a junior mortgage subject and subordinate in all respects to the permanent loan documentation. The gap documents usually state unequivocally that, in the event the rent-roll requirement is not met during the rent-roll period, the permanent lender still retains the right on demand to purchase the gap note and discharge of record any second mortgage held by the construction lender. The borrower normally assigns to the construction lender all funds that would otherwise be payable to the borrower in the event the rent-roll requirement is met, with the construction lender agreeing to reassign to the borrower all funds that would be payable pursuant to the rent-roll requirement at such time as the gap loan note is paid in full. In addition, the permanent lender usually requires that the temporary lender and borrower agree that no funds will be disbursed under the gap documents, except at the closing of the permanent loan.

Normally, the permanent lender&#x27;s rent-roll requirement involves a period that runs from one to three years. However, the promissory note for the gap loan should be predicated on the possibility that the rent-roll requirement may not be met, and the terms should include a period of four to five years beyond the rent-roll requirement period, with a high enough interest rate to prompt the developer to refinance whenever it becomes feasible to do so. With regard to principal amortization, some gap lenders require none, while others require either partial amortization or amortization to the extent that there is net cash flow to be derived from the project.

Because of its prior position as construction lender, the gap lender usually has sufficient leverage with the permanent lender to receive adequate notice provisions and a right-to-cure period from the permanent lender.

Gap financing can also be used in purchase/rehab lending to fill the &quot;gap&quot; between the borrower&#x27;s down payment, and the amount lent by the 1st lien holder, or rehab lender. Typically rehab lenders will only go to 65-70% ARV (After Repair Value), so if the borrower is bringing 10% into the deal, the gap funder would provide the other 20-25%, and take a 2nd position lien and often a portion of the profit.

<text>Midrand is a town in central Gauteng, South Africa. It is situated in-between Centurion and Sandton. Formerly an independent municipality, Midrand now forms part of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality.

==History==
Midrand was established as a municipality in 1981 (in an area known as &quot;Halfway House&quot;, named after its position between Pretoria and Johannesburg), but ceased to be an independent town in the restructuring of local government that followed the end of apartheid in 1994. It was incorporated in the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality in 2000. It was made part of Region 2 and, as of 2006, when the number of regions were reduced to seven, it forms part of Region A of the City of Johannesburg.

Though no longer an independent town, the name Midrand is still in common use to denote the suburbs around the N1 highway north of the Jukskei River up to the border with the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality (this portion of the N1 highway is also known as the Ben Schoeman Highway). Suburbs that are generally regarded as being in Midrand include among others: Country View, Carlswald, Crowthorne, Ebony Park, Glen Austin, Ivory Park, Kaalfontein, Rabie Ridge, Halfway House, Halfway Gardens, Vorna Valley, Noordwyk, Randjesfontein, Randjespark, Blue Hills, Kyalami Agricultural Holdings and Waterfall City.

In 2010, it was reported that the Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality wished to annex Midrand from the City of Johannesburg, reportedly to boost its income, which was severely strained.

The city is relatively modern, having experienced much growth in the last decade. Many businesses have relocated there due to its proximity to good highway links and its location in the economic centre of Gauteng Province. The development of Midrand has resulted in little break between the outskirts of Johannesburg and those of Pretoria.

== Government ==

The South African Civil Aviation Authority is headquartered in Midrand, as is the Railway Safety Regulator (RSR), and the National Credit Regulator. Midrand is also the location of the African Union&#x27;s Pan-African Parliament and of the NEPAD secretariat.

== Politics ==

== Geography ==
As the name suggests, Midrand lies centrally within the Gauteng province positioned halfway between Johannesburg to the south (27 km) and Pretoria to the north (30 km). It forms the northernmost part of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, bordering two other metropolitan municipalities within Gauteng namely the City of Tshwane to the north and the City of Ekurhuleni to the east. Midrand is flanked by Centurion to the north, Sandton to the south and Thembisa to the east. 

== Landmarks ==
Midrand has the largest conference centre in South Africa which is known as Gallagher Estate which was built on the former site of Halfway House Primary School, which subsequently moved to new grounds near the fire station.

A landmark of Midrand is the Nizamiye Mosque, opened in 2012, the largest mosque in South Africa. The Classical Turkish-style mosque was personally funded by Turkish-born construction tycoon Ali Katircioglu at a cost of R210 million.

The largest single-phase shopping mall built in Africa, The Mall of Africa, is located in the Waterfall City precinct of the town.

It is now also home to the new headquarters for a multinational auditing-finance company, PWC. (Constructed by WSP) Visible, as currently (2018) the only skyscraper in Midrand. It will however be rivaled by its upcoming twin, The Falcon Building. Both the Falcon and PWC are in the same complex as Mall of Africa. Other landmarks include the Boulders Shopping centre, so named after the heritage site housing huge granite rocks which are approximately 3.5-billion years old.

== Business ==
Midrand is a thriving business node, home to the offices of major corporations such as Vodacom, Microsoft, Neotel, and Altech Autopage as well as an array of small and medium enterprises. 

In 2013, Atterbury Properties announced plans to build the Mall of Africa, which would be one of the continent&#x27;s largest. The Mall of Africa is located within the green, mixed-use Waterfall City precinct. The N1 Business Park and International Business Gateway are among the commercial developments in Midrand. The latest industrial development is called Waterfall Logistics Precinct.

== Education ==
The University of South Africa&#x27;s Graduate School of Business Leadership is located in Midrand. The Pearson Institute of Higher Education formerly known as Midrand Graduate Institute, was officially opened on 9 May 1990. A Varsity College campus was established in 2012. Macmillan Education South Africa relocated their offices in June 2017 from Melrose Arch. There are primary and high schools located in several areas.

Midrand lies along the N1 (Ben Schoeman Freeway) which runs through the town in a northerly direction from Johannesburg to Pretoria. Midrand is connected to the N1 by the M39 Allandale Road, M71 New Road, R562 Olifantsfontein Road and the M36 Samrand Road in Centurion. The N3 (Eastern Bypass) lying just south of Midrand, intersects the N1 at the Buccleuch Interchange and runs southwards to Germiston and Durban. 

Midrand is intersected by three regional routes, namely; the R101 (Pretoria Main Road) from Sandton to Centurion and Pretoria, the R55 from Sandton to Centurion and Pretoria and the R562 from Thembisa to Diepsloot. Metropolitan routes within the Greater Johannesburg metropolitan region that intersect in Midrand include the M38 (Modderfontein Road; Allan Road) and M39 (Allandale Road), both connecting the town with Kempton Park to the south-east.

Midrand is the home of Grand Central Airport and also to one of the stations in the Gautrain rapid rail system on the route from Pretoria to Sandton.

<doc id="599829" wikidata="Q688471" url="?curid=599829" title="William I, Count of Nassau-Siegen">
<text>William I of Nassau-Siegen (; 10 April 1487 – 6 October 1559), nicknamed the Elder () or the Rich (), was Count of Nassau-Siegen and half of Diez from 1516 to 1559. He was a descendant of the Ottonian Line of the House of Nassau.

William&#x27;s reign marked a notable period in the history of his house. During his reign, he introduced the Reformation in his territories, and the saw expansion of his county&#x27;s territorial possessions. He promoted the Lutheran faith and played a key role in the political events of his time, including involvement in the Schmalkaldic League and negotiations leading to the Peace of Passau. William advanced the interests of his house through a policy of moderation, and contributed to its success.

A major challenge throughout his reign was the succession dispute over the County of Katzenelnbogen, which was contested by the Landgraviate of Hesse. This dispute was known as the War of the Katzenelnbogen Succession.

William was described as calm and persistent. He maintained firm religious convictions, and was resolute in asserting his rights in the &quot;Katzenelnbogische Erbfolgestreit&quot;. Through his diplomatic skills, he earned numerous mediation assignments within the Holy Roman Empire.

In Dutch history, he is primarily remembered as the father of Prince William the Silent.

==Early years==

William was born in Dillenburg on 10 April 1487 as the fourth and youngest son of Count John V of Nassau-Siegen and Landgravine Elisabeth of Hesse-Marburg. At William&#x27;s baptism, his mother&#x27;s uncle, Archbishop Herman IV of Cologne, was present. William spent most of his youth in Siegen, where he trained himself in the use of weapons, and received a bow at the age of six and a pair of spurs two years later. He and his elder brother Henry often rode horses at the horse fairs and stallion farms of the County of Nassau. William frequently stayed with his parents in the County of Vianden, which was owned by the Nassaus, where he learnt both French and German.

At the age of ten, William he was sent &quot;zu hoff&quot; (to court) in Heidelberg, where he learned Latin and established lasting relations with the Electorate of the Palatinate. In his early youth, he travelled extensively through the German lands, which included a visit to the court of Elector Frederick III the Wise in Saxony, where he formed importance relations for the future.

Since 1499, William&#x27;s eldest brother Henry stayed at the court of their childless uncle Engelbert II of Nassau in Breda and Brussels, where he received further education. Upon Engelbert&#x27;s death in 1504, Henry inherited his possessions in the Netherlands. In the same year, William&#x27;s older brother John died, leaving William as the sole heir of their father.

During the War of the Succession of Landshut (1504–1505), William earned his first military laurels as captain of a Nassau cavalry squadron. At the Imperial Diet in Cologne in 1505, he met Emperor Maximilian I and accompanied Elector Frederick III of Saxony to Arnhem, where he met Walburga of Egmont. In 1506, the marriage was arranged at Siegen with a messenger from Count John III of Egmont, and shortly afterwards the marriage was consummated at Koblenz.

The wedding was attended by Archbishop Herman IV of Cologne, John II of Trier and other guests from the nobility. Henry, the groom&#x27;s brother, had come over from the Netherlands. Shortly before, on 16 February 1506, the &quot;Beilager&quot; of William&#x27;s sisters Elisabeth and Mary, who married the counts and Jobst I of Holstein-Schauenburg-Pinneberg respectively, was celebrated in Dillenburg with the greatest of festivities. The purchase of gold fabric for 747 guilders and silk fabric for 396 guilders at the trade fair in Mainz for these celebrations, as well as the unusually high total expenditure of 13,505 guilders in the accounts of 1505/1506, show that these weddings had been extravagant events. Soon after the wedding, William set up his own court at Dillenburg Castle. There, he laid the foundation stone for the tower facing the valley of Dillenburg on 23 March. In August 1506, he had body armours made for himself and five of his servants in Frankfurt.

==Count of Nassau-Siegen and Diez==
When his father died in 1516, William inherited his properties, including the county. The county covered about 1,600 square kilometres, with about 37,500 inhabitants that lived in 15 cities and 550 villages. The regular income at that time is estimated at less than 50,000 guilders, derived from taxes, service fees, tolls, etc. The county was primarily agricultural. Pigs were raised on the Kalteiche, which benefited from the large oak forests. The county was known for its good horse and cattle breeding in Westerwald, and wool weaving in Herborn. However, the main source of income came from the mountains; from the iron ore of the Sieg and Dill regions. The Counts of Nassau regularly received the iron ore tithes from the mines and smelting rents from the smelters. The latter was levied in various ways, partly as compensation for the fief of the land on which the smelter stood, partly as a tax on the use of the watercourse, which was on loan from the territorial lord. As some of the most important citizens of the state, the hammer smiths of Siegen were granted exemption from feudal duties, and from about 1539, paid 24 raderguilders a year for this instead of the hitherto usual &quot;reisigen Pferdes&quot;. Until 1555, the count himself owned many iron smelters, and in the Dillenburg district he retained his influence even after 1555. Naturally, the counts cared about the welfare of the iron industry, which was the country&#x27;s main source of income. They discussed with the iron workers price regulations, wages and working times as well as trying out new technical processes.

In 1520, the counts united in associations or &quot;Korrespondenzen&quot;, and divided into two large districts of the Netherlands and of the Wetterau. William was put in charge of the Wetterau district. The economic, political and spiritual consequences of this alliance were significant, although not fully understood. The leading position in these &quot;Grafenkorrespondenz&quot; was majorly held by members of the House of Nassau. Of particular importance were certain toll agreements by this &quot;Wetterauer Grafenverein&quot;, which almost foreshadowed a Western toll union. This toll union had already been established in the Wetterau by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and had withstood political and territorial changes. Although in 1354 only half of the County of Nassau belonged to the Wetterau (the Siegerland had been allocated to the district of Westphalia), the entire county benefited from the toll agreements because the count was a member of the &quot;Wetterauer Grafenverein&quot;. Within this toll union, a simple declaration was enough to transport provisions, fruit, grain, oat, meat, wine, butter, cheese and iron freely. The designation of iron as the only non-agricultural product showed this toll union was important to Nassau, and especially to the iron trade from the Siegerland. The expansion of the toll area in 1515 led to the abolition of several Rhine tolls and opened the way for iron from the Siegerland to reach Antwerp and other markets where the people of the Siegerland, as subjects of Nassau, could take advantage of the more favourable market conditions. The expansion of the toll area brought benefits for production, as the import duties for charcoal from the County of Wittgenstein and the &quot;Freier Grund&quot;, which partly belonged to the County of Sayn, were abolished.

The justice system continued in the forms adopted in the 16th century. Periodically, the &quot;Schützen&quot; (town watchers) were responsible for apprehending offenders, confining them either in the tower or, for less severe offences, in the &quot;Hundskrapf&quot;. The most common method of execution was hanging, with the gallows situated near Dillenburg on the &quot;Galgenberg&quot;. The executions were exclusively conducted in Dillenburg. In 1546, one occurred in Ebersbach, as was common in the past, with the participation of &quot;Schultheißen&quot; from Dillenburg. Conversely, &quot;Schultheißen&quot; from Herborn were often involved in the executions in Dillenburg, and were subsequently entertained by the city.
In 1518, William became &quot;Rat und Diener&quot; (counsellor and servant) of the Emperor. In this capacity, he attended Charles V&#x27;s election as Roman King in Frankfurt. William quickly gained prestige and influence. In Charles V&#x27;s war against King Francis I of France in 1521–1522, William served in the Imperial Army. In the summer of 1521, he participated with a cavalry squadron at the Siege of Mézières, led by his brother Henry. When William&#x27;s baby daughter Magdalene was baptised in November 1522, guests at included his friend Count Philip II of Hanau-Münzenberg and his young bride Countess Juliane of Stolberg-Wernigerode.

Because of his prudent administration, William was a beloved ruler among his subjects. This was evident during the German Peasants&#x27; War of 1524–1525 in which violent excesses occurred in numerous places in Germany, but from which Nassau was largely spared. On 18 May 1525, William wrote to his brother Henry in the Netherlands, stating that the whole of southern Germany was ablaze with peasant revolt and that he was very worried about it: &quot;Meine Bauern sind gottlob noch ruhig und zufrieden, aber das Wetter ist allenthalben um mich her.&quot; (&quot;My peasants are thankfully still calm and content, but the bad weather is all around me.&quot;). William helped his threatened fellow princes against the peasants by sending some of them a Nassau auxiliary corps &quot;wider den uffruhr&quot; (&quot;against the revolt&quot;). Nevertheless, he enjoyed a certain respect among the peasants as a just territorial lord. The Hessian &quot;Amtmann&quot; Balthasar Schrautenbach wrote that the Franconian peasants wanted to expel Landgrave Philip I the Magnanimous of Hesse and put William in his place. The peasant writer Sigle is said to have given courage to his people by saying that as soon as the landgrave turned against them, &quot;der reiche Nassau&quot; would come into the country. Thus even then, William was nicknamed the Rich.

William was a cautious large landowner. Whereas his father took great interest in strengthening his position as territorial lord by acquiring the largest possible amount of his own property in farmsteads, meadows and arable land, William strove to expand and complete his land holdings especially around Dillenburg. Through purchase and barter, he not only significantly expanded the large &quot;Herrenwiese&quot; with adjacent other plots of land, but around 1526, he also acquired the land in , which was in private hands of several inhabitants of Dillenburg and Feldbach, in order to build the &quot;zwey Wagen Spur breiten Weg&quot; (&quot;two wagon tracks wide road&quot;) there.

In 1526, Prince John Frederick of Saxony and his father, Elector John the Steadfast of Saxony, visited William in Siegen. He was asked to convey for the prince his marriage proposal to Princess Sibylle of Cleves. Sibylle&#x27;s father, Duke John III of Cleves, was William&#x27;s first cousin.

In 1528, William was concerned about his local industry. He regulated the working hours of iron smelters and banned hammer smiths from working at night. He also ordered iron to be marked before it was sold, creating one of the earliest hallmarks for steel. On 9 October 1528, the Emperor approved his appointment as governor of Luxembourg, but William refused to accept the office.

In 1529, William&#x27;s wife Walburga died and was buried in Siegen. His brother Henry suggested he looked for a new life companion in the highest princely houses and suggested a princess of Lorraine, who brought in a rich marital estate. In the same year, William&#x27;s friend Philip II of Hanau-Münzenberg died. Philip left behind underage children, over whom Willam took custody. There were regular exchanges between William, the widower in Siegen, and Juliane, the widow in Hanau. Matters of faith were also discussed, as Hanau had embraced Martin Luther&#x27;s teachings early on.
On 20 September 1531, the marriage of William and Juliane took place in the hall of Siegen Castle. The marriage was conducted according to the Catholic ritual. The baptism of their eldest son, William, on 4 May 1533 also took place according to Catholic tradition; a full mass with Latin formulas, with the use of salt, which symbolised the doctrine of faith, and with a real exorcism of the devil. Through this marriage, William acquired a quarter of the County of Diez (of which he already owned half) in 1535, which had previously been in possession of the Eppstein family. Lord Eberhard IV of Eppstein-Königstein, brother of William&#x27;s mother-in-law, died childless in 1535. The Eppstein family had gained control of this territory in 1420 through the marriage of Lord Godfrey VII of Eppstein-Münzenberg to Countess Jutta of Nassau-Siegen.

During the era marked by religious and political upheavals, including Luther&#x27;s first published translation of the Bible, the founding of the Society of Jesus by Ignatius of Loyola, and the execution of Thomas More in England, William was involved in numerous mediation assignments. Despite being offered esteemed positions such as commander in the Imperial Army and Imperial &quot;Statthalter&quot; in the Duchy of Württemberg in 1532, as well as the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1533, William declined these honours to maintain his impartiality. He rejected the Order of the Golden Fleece, which Charles V wanted to grant him, due to its requirement for members to adhere the Catholic faith.

On 10 January 1531, the Schmalkaldic League was founded by the Protestant Elector John of Saxony, Duke Ernest I of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Landgrave Philip I of Hesse, Fürst Wolfgang of Anhalt-Köthen, the counts of Mansfeld and several minor Imperial Estates. The threat to Vienna and the imperial homelands by the Turks initially prevented Charles V from acting against the league, and the league forced him to conclude the in 1532. After Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, supported by Philip of Hesse, recaptured his lands in 1534, most members of the &quot;Wetterauer Grafenverein&quot; joined the league, including William. On 10 January 1536, he committed to contribute to, and cooperate with everything the league would decide. Because of the &quot;Katzenelnbogische Erbfolgestreit&quot;, Philip of Hesse protested against William&#x27;s admission into the league.

William issued several decrees for the economical, social and ethical benefit and advancement of his subjects. Despite his country being beset by threats of war throughout his reign, he instructed his officials by various mandates to ensure that the land peace renewed by the Emperor on various Imperial Diets was maintained in his county and that all troublemakers, vagrants and beggars were taken into the strictest custody. The wool purchasing ordinance promulgated by William on 19 May 1536 served to revive domestic wool weaving by strictly prohibiting the sale of sheep wool to foreign buyers and regulating in detail the country&#x27;s trade by weight and price. The ordinance promulgated on 10 December 1538 for artisans, wagoners and day labourers regulated in detail wages and working hours in summer and winter; working hours were set from 4am to 7pm in the summer, and from 5am to 6pm in winter. In the spring, the wagoners were only allowed to use their horses and wagons for arable farming. William was also already thinking about a more generous meat supply for his country. Pig breeding lagged especially in times of poor acorn harvest. In such years, he bought fat pigs from abroad. In 1538, for example, he sent the and an attendant to Lippe to buy pigs.

Due to the &quot;Katzenelnbogische Erbfolgestreit&quot;, the county became increasingly entangled in debt. The shortage of timber and charcoal led to an economic downturn that crippled the iron industry. William issued decrees that demonstrated his thorough knowledge of the industrial situation. In October 1538, he became a shareholder in the &quot;Gewerkschaft&quot; of the famous at near Hilchenbach in Siegerland. He bought the share from Kilian Theis of for 25 Raderguilders. 11 years later, when two other shareholders filed suit against William, he did not rule as sovereign, but let the ordinary mountain court judge. When the court ruled in his favour, the plaintiffs appealed. In the new proceedings, which William again did not interfere with, a judgement was passed against him.

Despite the debts, many baptisms and weddings were celebrated extensively. The most splendid of these baptisms, the ecclesiastical and secular course of which has been preserved for almost all of William&#x27;s children, was that of his third son Louis, born on 10 January 1538, who was baptised by Count palatine Louis V in the presence of Archbishop Herman V of Cologne. The number of guests at this feast was so large that Dillenburg Castle could not accommodate them all.

Times forced William to carefully build up an armament industry. As early as around 1540, he had research conducted in Siegen into whether the iron from Wissenbach could be hammered into sheet iron for body armours and the like. He planned the construction of new &quot;Plattenhämmer&quot; (sheet metal factories), for which he employed sheet metal smiths from the Olpe district on 25 March 1540. The fire outbreak at the small border fortress and the village of Freudenberg in July 1540 boosted these plans. William had the houses hastily rebuilt, while the damaged castle was repaired more slowly.

His diplomatic strength of persuasion earned William another mediating role in 1540 in the succession dispute in the Duchy of Guelders between Emperor Charles V as Duke of Burgundy and Duke Antoine of Lorraine. As Antoine completely disregarded William&#x27;s advice, he then permanently lost the Duchy of Guelders and the County of Zutphen. For the aid granted at the Imperial Diet of Speyer in 1542 against the Turks, William had provided a military contingent. That contingent under &quot;Junker&quot; Johann von Selbach-Crottorf arrived in Raab, Hungary in 1542, but did not get involved in the fighting. For the same purpose William paid a larger sum in 1544.
During the Siege of Saint-Dizier in Champagne in July 1544, René of Chalon, the only son of William&#x27;s eldest brother Henry, was hit in the right shoulder by a musket bullet. He died the next day in the arms of Charles V. In the holographic will drawn up by René, he had stipulated that the eldest son of his uncle William became universal heir to all his properties, unusually bypassing his uncle, because of his Lutheran sympathies. The counsellors of Charles V did object to this succession on the grounds that William had Protestant tendencies. But the Emperor decided to honour René&#x27;s will, albeit on condition that the young heir would be removed from his parental authority and brought up as a Catholic in the Netherlands. William did not hesitate to accept this arrangement, since, like his son in his later career, he was more inclined to consider his dynastic interests than his religious beliefs. On 13 February 1545, Charles V formalised the arrangements.

William did not take part in the war of the Schmalkaldic League against Duke Henry V of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. The growing power of his opponent Philip of Hesse in the league forced William to be wary of violence and was one of the reasons why he did not take part in the Schmalkaldic War against the Emperor, which broke out in 1546. William executed the recruitment of 600 horsemen for the Imperial Army entrusted to him. He thus escaped the punishment inflicted on his cousins from the Walramian Line and the other members of the &quot;Wetterauer Grafenverein&quot;. And although he had by now clearly placed himself on the Protestant side, he still had much influence with the Catholic, that many tried to win favour with Charles V through him. William attended the Imperial Diet in Augsburg in 1548.
William was concerned about the developing relationship between the German princes and King Henry II of France. Henry II invited William to Butzbach in March 1551 to take sides, but William remained steadfast and neutral. As the senior of the House of Nassau, he had to consider both the German possessions and the threatened areas of his son the Prince of Orange located in France, the Principality of Orange itself and in the Franche-Comté. If in a coming dispute the German princes were to prevail with the King of France, Philip of Hesse would seize the County of Katzenelnbogen and Henry II would seize the Principality of Orange and its possessions in the Dauphiné and the Provence, totalling more than 800 cities, villages, castles and farmhouses, which yielded around 57,000 livres a year in annuities. This did not include the Principality of Orange itself. On 3 October 1551, the German princes united in Lochau against the Emperor. They demanded and got a declaration of neutrality from the &quot;Wetterauer Grafenverein&quot;. The only member &quot;not&quot; to sign this declaration was William. He stayed in the mighty fortress of Dillenburg with others troops from Breda, preparing for a Hessian-Saxon attack. Also in Siegen, the city walls were checked and the towers re-equipped. The guilds had to enrol and train the able-bodied men. Nassau was in a high state of alert. Messengers went from Dillenburg and Siegen to Breda with secret messages and coded letters. At the time, it was significant that Magister Wilhelm Knüttel acted simultaneously as secretary to Count William of Nassau and to his eldest son Prince William of Orange; all the threads of Nassau politics were in one hand. Some historians claim that William, because of his knowledge of the French language, was the spokesman for the German princes at Fontainebleau, who, in exchange for his help against the Emperor, assured the French king of sovereign rights as imperial vicar over the bishoprics of Metz, Toul, Verdun and Cambrai, thus relinquishing these cities to France. This claim is based solely on the dubious memoirs of the French marshal de Vieilville, Sire de Scépaux. These were not written until after 1584 and not printed in Paris until 1756–1763, long after the death of Prince William of Orange, to whom and whose house they wished to do harm.

The renewed shepherding ordinance for Dillenburg promulgated by William on 1 February 1552 was, like his father&#x27;s ordinance, intended to protect the fields and forests during communal grazing and limited the maximum number of sheep for anyone who wished to keep sheep in the valley of Dillenburg to 25, instead of the earlier 50. On 12 September 1555, William sold the iron trade of the count&#x27;s iron smelters to the citizens of the city and the subjects of the district of Siegen, with the exception of the iron smelter at Freudenberg, where he reserved for himself an annual iron smelting period of 12 weeks. This was the beginning of a monopoly on the iron trade, almost independent of the territorial lord. The citizens never used the freedoms granted to them to the detriment of the count, nor did the count use his rights to the detriment of his subjects.

William issued a large number of decrees aimed at the moral uplift of his subjects who, despite all previous measures, continued to return to their old vices. Since excessive spending on family celebrations provided particular opportunity for this, William tried to put an end to intemperance at child baptisms, weddings, funerals and guild meetings through strict regulations. To prevent revels and Sunday desecration, residents were obliged to close pubs at a surprisingly early hour, eight o&#x27;clock in summer and seven o&#x27;clock in winter. The count&#x27;s ordinance of 19 December 1555 stipulated &quot;daß über die bestimmte Zeit, wenn abends die Weinglock geläutet ist, kein Wirt länger weder über die Schwell hinaus oder auch sunsten seinen Gästen im Hause Wein reichen oder zapfen soll&quot; (&quot;that after the stipulated time, when in the evening the wine bell is rung, no innkeeper shall serve or tap wine to his guests in the house, nor over the threshold, nor otherwise&quot;), because otherwise &quot;viel Unrats, Mord, Totschlag, Unzucht und alle Untugend gemehret und überhand nimmt, wie neulich ein schrecklich Exempel und Totschlag sich derhalber zugetragen&quot; (&quot;much mischief, murder, manslaughter, fornication and all immorality will increase and prevail, as recently a terrible example and manslaughter took place thereby&quot;). A particularly strict order issued by William on 7 July 1556 was against dancing. Dancing was generally forbidden in the county on Sundays and holidays. For weddings, permission was given by the mayors and bailiffs, and the dance took place in the presence of elders, a councillor, the town clerk or the court clerk at the town hall. Dancing was allowed only with violins and lutes, not on the street with drums, shawms and bagpipes, no longer than two hours in the afternoon and one hour after supper, and all disorderly and immoral jumping, twisting, overturning, arguing and shouting was to be avoided. One ordinance of William that characterised him as a profound and far-sighted sovereign was his ban on marriages between relatives: &quot;Dieweil es etzo unter unseren Untertanen gemein wird, dass die Eltern ihr Kind in Verwandt-, Blutfreundschaft und Schwagerschaft im vierten Glied vermählen, daß doch im Rechte verboten&quot; (&quot;Because it is now customary among our subjects for parents to marry off their child in kinship, blood relationship and consanguinity in the fourth degree, which is forbidden by law&quot;), the friends of both parties, when agreeing on a marriage, &quot;sich erstlich der Sippschaft halben gründlich erkundigen, ob und wie nahe die Personen einander verwandt, und so die Verwandtnis zwischen ihnen im dritten oder vierten Glied bestände, alsdann soll dieselbig Ehe ohn unser Wissen und Willen nicht beteidingt, geschlossen noch zugelassen werden&quot; (&quot;first of all thoroughly inquire into the kinship, whether and how closely the persons are related to each other, and if the kinship between them is in the third or fourth degree, this marriage shall not be concluded or allowed without our knowledge and will&quot;).

=== Introduction of the Reformation ===

Shortly after the beginning of William&#x27;s reign, the Augustinian monk Martin Luther initiated the movement of minds, from which the Protestant Church emerged with his Ninety-five Theses in 1517. Elector Frederick III the Wise of Saxony, Luther&#x27;s patron, and Landgrave Philip I the Magnanimous of Hesse introduced the new doctrine to their realms. The Reformation took hold in Nassau much later. William, through his repeated stays at the court of the Elector of Saxony and his friendship with the young prince and later Elector John Frederick I, had made an early acquaintance with the professor from Wittenberg. In 1518, under the influence of Luther&#x27;s theses, William tried to control the sale of indulgences in his country by having Archbishop Albert of Mainz order his subcommissioner Johann Breydenbach to stop the sale of indulgences, which had begun in Nassau, especially in the Siegerland.

At the Imperial Diet of Worms in 1521, William was an eyewitness to Luther&#x27;s appearance before Emperor Charles V and the Empire. It is not known whether he spoke to the reformer, but he was intensely engaged with Luther&#x27;s ideas. However, he did not yet show any overt adherence to Luther&#x27;s teachings, due to the great influence exerted on him by his brother Henry, a staunch supporter of the Emperor and the Catholic Church.
Shortly after his visit to William in 1526, John Frederick I of Saxony, in a letter dated 16 May from Torgau, sent William some of Luther&#x27;s writings, to make of him, as he wrote, &quot;mit göttlicher Hilfe einen guten Christen&quot; (&quot;with divine help a good Christian&quot;). Only then did he give the new doctrine more space; tightened regulations on church discipline and the prohibition of individual practices of the Catholic Church marked the beginning of a kind of reformation, which left all essential points untouched for the time being. Henry considered it his duty to repeatedly remind his brother of the dangers he was exposing himself and his house to by abandoning the old faith. These warnings, in view of the already three-decade-long &quot;Katzenelnbogische Erbfolgestreit&quot;, in which the Emperor was Nassau&#x27;s most powerful and almost sole supporter, had an effect on William, but neither were they able to dissuade him from his increasingly strong inclination towards Luther&#x27;s doctrine. William had a calm, balanced personality, but also a persistent character. He convinced himself of the truth of the new faith, and embraced it wholeheartedly.
In 1530, William attended the Imperial Diet of Augsburg, where the Protestant princes presented the Emperor their &quot;Bekenntnis&quot; (the &quot;Confessio Augustana&quot;). Also present in the Emperor&#x27;s entourage was William&#x27;s brother Henry. The Henry&#x27;s secretary Alexander Schweis received the protest note for the Emperor. Immediately after William&#x27;s return, were &quot;die religion und kirchengebräuch zue Dillenbergk ... geendert und die meß abgestellt&quot; (&quot;the religion and church customs in Dillenburg ... changed and the mass ended&quot;). He formally introduced the Augsburg Confession and abolished celibacy and mass. William worked cautiously and gradually, forced to do so not only by the necessary consideration with the Emperor and his brother Henry, but also by the ecclesiastical relations in his own county.

At that time the Siegerland had about 20,000 inhabitants and the number of parishes did not exceed 30. The relatively low level of education among the masses and clergy made rapid progress impossible. William initiated religious renewal in the county&#x27;s two main cities, Dillenburg and Siegen, by replacing, in October 1530, the two previous parish priests, who had voluntarily retired in exchange for a mercy salary, with two representatives of the new doctrine. These were Heilman Bruchhausen from Krombach (usually called Heilman Krombach) and Leonhard Wagner from Kreuznach. Heilman Krombach, who had already been in William&#x27;s service as court chaplain since March 1529, became the first minister of the city of Dillenburg. For himself and his family however, William believed it was more beneficial to keep the old faith outwardly. All his sons were still baptised according to Catholic tradition, and he obtained a papal dispensation from Lent in late 1531. William patiently allowed almost all the county&#x27;s clergy to remain in their posts, although, due the incompetence and reprehensible lifestyles of a few, and due to some others having contrary attitude to Lutheran doctrine, they were of little help to the movement. During this time of transition, the lack of suitable clergy in his county became especially noticeable, and William was forced to look for the necessary replacements elsewhere. He received help from the old relations he had established with Saxony. It was mainly through the mediation of Philipp Melanchthon, who maintained a lively correspondence with William&#x27;s counsellor Wilhelm Knüttel, that a pupil of the two great reformers from Wittenberg, Erasmus Sarcerius from Annaberg in Saxony, came to the county as a helper. Sarcerius became not only the actual completionist of the Reformation, but also the new creator of the county&#x27;s school system. With the church orders of 1532 (after the example in Brandenburg-Ansbach) and 1536 (after the church order of Nuremberg), and the church agenda of 1537, Lutheranism was organised in Nassau-Siegen. In 1536, William appointed Sarcerius as rector of the Latin school in Siegen. He was also appointed as court preacher and superintendent in 1537, and as spiritual inspector of the entire county in 1541. During regular synods and church visits, Sarcerius reorganised the church system of the county on a Protestant basis.

In 1543, Melanchton stayed in Siegen. Archbishop Herman V of Cologne, whose brother had married William&#x27;s sister Elisabeth, sought William&#x27;s advice. The archbishop tried in vain to bring the Archbishopric of Cologne to the Reformation. With the Wied Family, the archbishop spent several weeks in Siegen.

In 1548, William had to let Sarcerius go because the Augsburg Interim no longer allowed him to do his work in the spirit of Luther. With the Interim (an imperial decree), the Emperor ruled that the Catholic doctrine was to be upheld until a general council was held and that the Lutheran Imperial Estates were to restore their former religious status within six months. William had to introduce the Interim in his county, which was again subordinated to the Archbishopric of Trier. The Interim evoked strong reluctance in the county, as it did elsewhere. Many parishes were now without pastors; but since the Catholic Church was unable to fill all vacant parishes with its priests, the former Protestant clergy mostly returned to their old posts. This remained so, especially after the Peace of Passau in 1552 abolished the Interim, and the Peace of Augsburg in 1555 granted the Protestant German Imperial Estates freedom of religion and the right to determine the religion of their subjects in their territory ().

=== The &quot;Katzenelnbogische Erbfolgestreit&quot; ===

A major challenge during William&#x27;s reign was the dispute over the succession in the rich County of Katzenelnbogen, known as the &quot;Katzenelnbogische Erbfolgestreit&quot;. This succession dispute between Nassau and the Landgraviate of Hesse lasted for decades, and exerted considerable impact on William&#x27;s country. Substantial resources were expended on numerous legal proceedings, and the rebuilding of Dillenburg Castle into a strong fortress, where soldiers were stationed for years to repel opposition attacks. The County of Katzenelnbogen was situated between the Taunus and the River Lahn and was very rich due to the possession of a large number of Rhine tolls between Mainz and the border of the Netherlands. The county consisted of Rheinfels, Sankt Goar, Braubach, Hohenstein, Darmstadt, Zwingenberg, Rüsselsheim and Umstadt, as well as Eppstein, the district of Driedorf and parts of Diez, Hadamar, Ems, Löhnberg, Camberg, and Wehrheim. The last seven possessions were jointly owned with the Counts of Nassau.
After the death of John V in 1516, his sons Henry and William continued the case with increased vigour. Henry&#x27;s high position and close personal relationship with Charles V as an educator, general and advisor gave the Nassaus a major support in this protracted legal battle. Their legal opponent, the young Landgrave Philip I the Magnanimous of Hesse had an advantage because Hesse had gained control of the entire disputed territory, which gave him a strong position over the small County of Nassau; in addition, powerful imperial princes, such as Elector Frederick III the Wise of Saxony, were on his side as allies.

In 1520, Charles V referred the dispute from the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; to the &quot;Reichshofrat&quot;. This seemed favourable for William, because Alexander Schweis from Herborn, who was Henry&#x27;s secretary, served as a judge in the latter court. Due to Henry&#x27;s great influence on Charles V, the case was discussed at the Imperial Diet of Worms in 1521, but no final decision was made. A commission consisting of the Prince bishops Christoph of Augsburg, George of Bamberg and of Strasbourg was given the task of re-examining the case, which had been handled by the most important legal scholars of the time. The verdict, to which both parties had unconditionally submitted in advance, was handed down in Tübingen on 9 May 1523. It was favourable to William and awarded him almost the entire inheritance. Shortly before, on 17 January 1523, his mother Elisabeth of Hesse-Marburg, the original heiress, died. Charles V openly sided with William, but whatever decrees Charles sent from Burgos – Philip of Hesse ignored them. The Emperor was far away in Spain. In 1527, an imperial commission visited Siegen because of the dispute with Hesse.

The complicated political and religious circumstances of the period, including the wars Charles V had to fight against France and the Turks kept him out of the Holy Roman Empire for a long time. He also fought against the Protestant princes united in the Schmalkaldic League, gradually reducing the Emperor&#x27;s interest in the Nassau cause. Henry died in 1538, and William leaned more openly towards the Protestant side.

In the course of the dispute, armed raids on Dillenburg Castle were repeatedly planned. Shortly after the Tübingen verdict was announced, in June 1523 William feared that Philip had mobilised against him in order to overrun him and drive him out. On 1 September of the same year, he wrote to his brother Henry, saying: &quot;der lantgraf rüst sich ernstlich, thut ein Aufgebot über das andere und lest sich oeffentlich hoeren, er wolle mich verjagen&quot; (&quot;the landgrave is seriously arming himself, issuing one summons after another and is publicly announcing that he wants to expel me&quot;). At the same time, William asked for at least 2,000 guilders, which he needed for defence. Similarly, in 1525 and 1528, Philip again took up arms with Saxony to get the County of Katzenelnbogen permanently in his hands. Then, too, William expected a surprise attack on Dillenburg. William not only had and the Eschenburg occupied with his countrymen to protect his border against Hesse, but also, from about 1525, had Dillenburg Castle put in the strongest state of defence. He had new bastions built and equipped with cannons. Major fortifications had been under construction since 1525, as a letter from Henry dated 2 February 1526 reads:
At that time, construction of the &quot;Hohen Mauer&quot; (high wall) began under the leadership of Utz or Ulrich von Anspach, who had been Burgrave of since 1516. The colossal structure was 300m long and 20m high. In December 1531, the construction of the wall was still being built, when William wrote to his brother that he had only just begun the heavy foundation work for the fortress, which is still entirely unfinished and requires great foresight. On 24 May 1533, he again described to him his difficult situation: because the landgrave &quot;allenthalben an ihn stoße, könnte er nit wohl sicher aus seinem Haus reiten oder gehn&quot; (&quot;collided with him everywhere, he could not safely ride or go out of his house&quot;) and was therefore &quot;zu einem bau und festung höchlich verursacht&quot; (&quot;compelled to a construction and fortification in a high degree&quot;).

Philip regarded William as his worst and greatest enemy and adversary, and in 1535 called him a &quot;papistischen Diener&quot; (papist servant), who, like his brother Henry, was &quot;subservient to the House of Burgundy&quot;, and wanted to deprive him of the largest and best part of his inherited princely land and people. Meanwhile, the protracted court case had cost a lot, and there was no end in sight to the resulting expenditure. Defences and constant preparedness against Hesse&#x27;s threats also eroded the county&#x27;s capital strength. They lacked money for the continuation of the massive construction. On 27 March 1536, William asked for an allowance of 20,000 guilders to purchase gunsmiths, guns, gunpowder, bullets and a sufficient garrison in the castle. The construction, though difficult, had to be completed, otherwise all other armament would be in vain. Henry promised his brother 10,000 guilders, but could only give the 1,600-2,000 guilders in the meanwhile, which could only be spent or invested on munitions and construction, and not on other thing. From 1539, alongside Ulrich von Anspach was artillery master Johann Opferkampf, who at that time not only supervised all the artillery at the castle, but also cast his own cannons from models he made in the count&#x27;s carpentry workshop. In 1547, a cistern was constructed as a precaution for a siege. As of 1529, a fountain stood in the centre of the castle&#x27;s courtyard.
In the autumn of 1551, Dillenburg received threatening news, and feared a new invasion. William wrote to his son Prince William of Orange on 6 December 1551, saying: &quot;one could get from the land of Hesse to Dillenburg in one day&quot;. Johann Opferkampf was hastily sent to the Netherlands to order and recruit 50–60 good soldiers for the castle, and requested money, gunpowder and a gunsmith. His recruitment was successful, as from early 1552 there were 60 Dutch soldiers at Dillenburg Castle, some of whom stayed there until July. At this time, the city church was also included in the fortification system of the castle, and as can still be clearly seen in the oldest images of the city, the cemetery wall was equipped with firing holes. Precautions were also taken for the security of the city at this time. The city account of 1550/51 mentions not only the conclusion of a contract with masons for the extension of the city gate, but also the expenses for four masons who worked on this gate for 74 days, in addition to about 20 residents who broke stones, threw sand and made food, and for wagoners, who brought stones and wood to the construction site with an escort crew of 52 men.

Though William was successful in his role as mediator, he could not easily obtain his rights and inheritance for himself. On several occasions, the opponents met to agree on an amicable settlement, but Philip of Hesse broke his word severally. When Philip returned home after six years of imprisonment in Mechelen, he asked for free passage through the County of Nassau. William granted him hospitality at 10 September 1552, despite everything that had preceded it. Philip offered much in return, but did not keep his promise. There was never a Hessian attack on Dillenburg because of the extremely strong fortification of the castle, with high walls.
After years of fruitless negotiations, an agreement with Hesse was finally reached in Frankfurt on 30 June 1557 through the mediation of Electors Otto Henry of the Palatinate and Augustus of Saxony and the Dukes Christoph of Württemberg and William V of Jülich. Hesse paid 600,000 guilders to Nassau (which was less than 10% of Nassau&#x27;s claims from 1555, recognised by several imperial judgements), but ceded for 150.000 guilders to Nassau: the Hessian share of the County of Diez (¼) (which had been sold by the Lords of Eppstein to the Counts of Katzenelnbogen), the districts of Camberg (¼), Altweilnau, Wehrheim (¼), , Driedorf, as well as half of Hadamar (i.e. Niederhadamar, or ) and the . The castle, city and district of Herborn were freed from the ancient Hessian fealty and came entirely under Nassau. Hesse was to pay 450,000 guilders in cash in such a way that 150,000 guilders was to be paid on 28 December 1557, 45,000 guilders was to be paid annually, from 1559 to 1564, and 30,000 guilders was to be paid in 1565. Hesse fulfilled its payment obligations. It was significant, and it meant recognition of the legal claims of the Counts of Nassau, that they were allowed to use the title Count of Katzenelnbogen and the county&#x27;s coat of arms, which area, however, definitively came to Hesse. The agreement was signed by Philip of Hesse and William, and also by William&#x27;s eldest son Prince William of Orange. It was a provisional agreement; various details were discussed for another year.

In March 1558, the final agreement was signed at the Imperial Diet in Frankfurt. In April of that year, the ceded districts of Driedorf, Ellar, Hadamar and Camberg were transferred by Hesse to Nassau. This ended a dispute that had lasted more than half a century and had cost large sums of money. This could be roughly measured by the fact that Nassau had consulted 54 lawyers for the lawsuits alone. The greatest burden was on William, who was assisted in the final years by his eldest son. For William, the settlement brought with it a considerable enlargement of his territory, giving the area to the right of the River Lahn a considerably greater unity and completion. With the acquisition of Altweilnau, Camberg and Wehrheim across the Lahn, his territory was now bordering the territory of the Walramian Line of the House of Nassau.

The Counts of Nassau had not only fought because of the inheritance, but also as a representative of the Imperial Estates and as an advocate of a rule of law against the emerging power states of absolute princes, of which the Landgraves of Hesse proved to be the typical representatives. The preservation of the Imperial Estates became a life task for the House of Nassau. Without the stronghold Nassau, princely power would have removed the influence of the imperial immediate nobility, clergy and the free imperial cities on the fate of the nation. With that, the Holy Roman Empire would have irrevocably disintegrated. In the dispute over the County of Katzenelnbogen with a much stronger opponent, the Counts of Nassau acquired the strength that later enabled them to withstand the great trials in the Netherlands. Empires of which the counts and other Imperial Estates were the bearers, had become bloodless in the 16th century. The leaders of the counts and lords in this struggle were Counts of Nassau.

To prove his entitlement to this resistance, William&#x27;s counsellor Wilhelm Knüttel, who held office in Siegen, compiled a work on the genealogy of the House of Nassau. Although it does not hold up to modern-day scrutiny, it did have an impact at the time, mainly due to his appeal to the charisma (royal salvation) that had come to Nassau through Roman King Adolf. The Counts of Nassau were helped by similar ideas in a writing prepared by the imperial counsellor Lazarus von Schwendi. The Counts from the County of Nassau were impressed, especially those who had united in the &quot;Wetterauer Grafenverein&quot;.

==Final years, death, and succession==
The resolution of the dispute over the County of Katzenelnbogen, coupled with Landgrave Philip of Hesse&#x27;s decision to partition Hesse, under pressure from his second wife, who he lived with in notorious bigamy, eliminated barriers to reconciliation between Hesse and Nassau. Consequently, the relationship between the two regions improved significantly. However, the County of Nassau suffered severe financial setbacks as a result of this conflict. Despite an annual income of 50,000 guilders, the county was in debt of 512,576 guilders. With annual interest payments of 25,684 consuming half of its income, the county faced financial strain. Although the settlement of Frankfurt mandated that Hesse pay large sums of money in instalments for the County of Katzenelnbogen, these payments fell far short of resolving the county&#x27;s financial issues.

Despite the debts, William continued to host elaborate celebrations at court. One notable celebration was the triple wedding festivities held on 6 June 1559 in Dillenburg, an occasion seldom equalled in the history of the castle and city. His son John married the young Landgravine Elisabeth of Leuchtenberg, and his daughters Anne and Elisabeth married the counts Albert of Nassau-Weilburg and Konrad of Solms-Braunfels respectively.

The feast, as detailed by Gottfried Hatzfeld was funded by a significant cash windfall, resulting from the resolution of the Katzenelnbogen succession dispute, which funded gifts given to Anne and Elisabeth. The event took place against the backdrop of the expanded and exquisitely adorned Dillenburg Castle, which had undergone renovations between 1550 and 1553 to serve as the family&#x27;s residence. The castle&#x27;s architecture was inspired by the Spanish-Burgundian court at the Dutch noble courts, and was praised by Hatzfeld with the words &quot;Wenn es nit hett diesen herren, eines Keysers haus wer es mit ehren&quot; (&quot;if it did not belong to this lord, an Emperor&#x27;s house it would be with honour&quot;).

William outlived the &quot;Friedensschluß&quot; with Hesse by only two years. He died in Dillenburg on 6 October 1559. A day before his death, in his last will, signed at Dillenburg, he recorded that he wished to be buried &quot;in der Kirchen eine, Siegen oder Dillenburg&quot; (&quot;in the church of Siegen or Dillenburg&quot;), according to the wishes of his wife Juliane and his sons John, Louis, Adolf and Henry, without pomp and circumstance, but with a &quot;Leichenpredigt&quot;. The date of his funeral has remained unknown. His biography states that his burial took place in the choir of the Dillenburg parish church, which is the in the . His eldest son could not attend the funeral. William was succeeded by his sons John, Louis, Adolf and Henry. They divided the county in 1560, but John exercised the administration on behalf of his younger brothers. On the extinction of the with the death of Count John III in 1561, the four brothers inherited the . Their father had signed a house treaty with John III for this purpose in 1554.

==Explanation of the nicknames==
===The Elder===
During William&#x27;s lifetime, it was not customary for reigning counts to be numbered as kings were. When a father and son shared the same given name, it was necessary to distinguish between them. In this case, the father was referred to as &quot;Wilhelm der Ältere&quot; (the Elder) and the son as &quot;Wilhelm der Jüngere&quot; (the Younger). This is practice is akin to the modern custom where father and son with the same given name and surname are distinguished by the addition of Sr. (senior) and Jr. (junior) respectively. The younger William later became known as William the Silent, Prince of Orange.

===The Rich===
The origin of the nickname &quot;the Rich&quot; attributed to William I is not definitely known, nor is the timing of when he acquired this epithet. Dutch historian suggests that it may have been due to his large number of children, although William&#x27;s actual wealth was not remarkable. Dutch hagiographies of William the Silent attribute the nickname to his abundance of children, rather than his financial prosperity.

This explanation is challenged by German historian , who asserts that William was already known as &quot;der Reiche Nassau&quot; during the German Peasants&#x27; War in 1524–1525, a time when he had only one daughter, which does not constitute a large family.

Another explanation proposed by German historian Richard Kolb is that contemporaries may have bestowed the title &quot;the Rich&quot; on William, possibly following the Katzenelnbogen inheritance. With an annual income of 50,000 guilders and ownership of numerous iron smelters, farmsteads, meadows, and arable land, William would have been considered wealthy by his subjects.

==Marriages and issue==
===First marriage===
William married Countess Walburga of Egmont ( –7 March 1529) in Koblenz on 29 May 1506. She was the eldest daughter of Count John III of Egmont and Countess Magdalene of Werdenberg.

<text>A floor [[loan]] refers to the minimum amount of money that a lender is willing to lend in order to enable the builder to begin the construction of a building that is to be occupied by tenants. The term is thus closely associated with mortgage and property loans. The rest of the loan&#x27;s balance (called &quot;holdback&quot;) is given to the builder upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the sale or lease of its residential space. For example, a bank may advance 80% of the balance of a property loan to the builder, and release the remaining 20% upon the successful construction lease or sale of the building&#x27;s residential units. This partition of funding means the lower risk for lender.

A word floor is used for more financial terms in financial area and means minimum, e.g. the interest rate floor is the lowest interest rate the lender can offer you to an adjustable (sometimes called variable) rate mortgage.

== Floor to ceiling loan ==

The related term is a floor to ceiling loan. In this type of loan there are two separate funding amounts: first upon satisfactory completion of construction and the second when a building is fully occupied by tenants or cash flows claimed by lender are fulfilled. The additional funds between floor and ceiling needed for construction costs are called &quot;gap&quot;.

<doc id="599837" wikidata="Q1136816" url="?curid=599837" title="Habituation">
<text>Habituation is a form of non-associative learning in which an organism’s non-reinforced response to a stimulus decreases after repeated or prolonged presentations of that stimulus. For example, organisms may habituate to repeated sudden loud noises when they learn that these have no consequences.

Habituation can occur in responses that habituate include those that involve an entire organism or specific biological component systems of an organism. The broad ubiquity of habituation across all forms of life has led to it being called &quot;the simplest, most universal form of learning...as fundamental a characteristic of life as DNA.&quot; Functionally, habituation is thought to free up cognitive resources for other stimuli that are associated with biologically important events by diminishing the response to inconsequential stimuli. 

A progressive decline of a behavior in a habituation procedure may also reflect nonspecific effects such as fatigue, which must be ruled out when the interest is in habituation. Habituation is relevant in psychiatry and psychopathology, as several neuropsychiatric conditions including autism, schizophrenia, migraine, and Tourette syndrome show reduced habituation to a variety of stimulus-types both simple and complex.

== Drug habituation ==
There is an additional connotation to the term &quot;habituation&quot; which applies to psychological dependency on drugs, and is included in several online dictionaries. A team of specialists from the World Health Organization assembled in 1957 to address the problem of drug addiction and adopted the term &quot;drug habituation&quot; to distinguish some drug-use behaviors from drug addiction. According to the WHO lexicon of alcohol and drug terms, habituation is defined as &quot;becoming accustomed to any behavior or condition, including psychoactive substance use&quot;. By 1964, the report of the Surgeon General of the United States on smoking and health included four features that characterize drug habituation according to WHO: 1) &quot;a desire (but not a compulsion) to continue taking the drug for the sense of improved well-being which it engenders&quot;; 2) &quot;little or no tendency to increase the dose&quot;; 3) &quot;some degree of psychic dependence on the effect of the drug, but absence of physical dependence and hence of an abstinence syndrome&quot;; 4) &quot;detrimental effects, if any, primarily on the individual&quot;. However, also in 1964, a committee from the World Health Organization once again convened and decided the definitions of drug habituation and drug addiction were insufficient, replacing the two terms with &quot;drug dependence&quot;. Substance dependence is the preferred term today when describing drug-related disorders, whereas the use of the term drug habituation has declined substantially. This is not to be confused with true habituation to drugs, wherein repeated doses have an increasingly diminished effect, as is often seen in addicts or persons taking painkillers frequently.

==Characteristics==
Habituation as a form of non-associative learning can be distinguished from other behavioral changes (e.g., sensory/neural adaptation, fatigue) by considering the characteristics of habituation that have been identified over several decades of research. The characteristics first described by Thompson and Spencer were updated in 2008 and 2009, to include the following:

Repeated presentation of a stimulus will cause a decrease in reaction to the stimulus. Habituation is also proclaimed to be a form of implicit learning, which is commonly the case with continually repeated stimuli. This characteristic is consistent with the definition of habituation as a procedure, but to confirm habituation as a process, additional characteristics must be demonstrated. Also observed is spontaneous recovery. That is, a habituated response to a stimulus recovers (increases in magnitude) when a significant amount of time (hours, days, weeks) passes between stimulus presentations.

&quot;Potentiation of habituation&quot; is observed when tests of spontaneous recovery are given repeatedly. In this phenomenon, the decrease in responding that follows spontaneous recovery becomes more rapid with each test of spontaneous recovery. Also noted was that an increase in the frequency of stimulus presentation (i.e., shorter interstimulus interval) will increase the rate of habituation. Furthermore, continued exposure to the stimulus after the habituated response has plateaued (i.e., show no further decrement) may have additional effects on subsequent tests of behavior such as delaying spontaneous recovery. The concepts of stimulus generalization and stimulus discrimination will be observed. Habituation to an original stimulus will also occur to other stimuli that are similar to the original stimulus (&quot;stimulus generalization&quot;). The more similar the new stimulus is to the original stimulus, the greater the habituation that will be observed. When a subject shows habituation to a new stimulus that is similar to the original stimulus but not to a stimulus that is different from the original stimulus, then the subject is showing &quot;stimulus discrimination&quot;. (For example, if one was habituated to the taste of lemon, their responding would increase significantly when presented with the taste of lime). Stimulus discrimination can be used to rule out sensory adaptation and fatigue as an alternative explanation of the habituation process.

Another observation mentioned is when a single introduction of a different stimulus late in the habituation procedure when responding to the eliciting stimulus has declined can cause an increase in the habituated response. This increase in responding is temporary and is called &quot;dishabituation&quot; and always occurs to the original eliciting stimulus (not to the added stimulus). Researchers also use evidence of dishabituation to rule out sensory adaptation and fatigue as alternative explanations of the habituation process. Habituation of dishabituation can occur. The amount of dishabituation that occurs as a result of the introduction of a different stimulus can decrease after repeated presentation of the &quot;dishabituating&quot; stimulus.

Some habituation procedures appear to result in a habituation process that last days or weeks. This is considered long-term habituation. It persists over long durations of time (i.e., shows little or no spontaneous recovery). Long-term habituation can be distinguished from short-term habituation which is identified by the nine characteristics listed above.

==Biological mechanisms==
The changes in synaptic transmission that occur during habituation have been well-characterized in the Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex. Habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal and at least, in one species of plants (Mimosa pudica), in isolated neuronally-differentiated cell-lines, as well as in quantum perovskite. The experimental investigation of simple organisms such as the large protozoan &quot;Stentor coeruleus&quot; provides an understanding of the cellular mechanisms that are involved in the habituation process.

===Neuroimaging===
Within psychology, habituation has been studied through different forms of neuroimaging like PET scan and fMRI. Within fMRI, the response that habituates is the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals triggered by stimuli. Decreases of the BOLD signal are interpreted as habituation.

The amygdala is one of the most-studied areas of the brain in relation to habituation. A common approach is to observe the visual processing of facial expressions. A study by Breiter and colleagues used fMRI scans to identify which areas of the brain habituate and at what rate. Their results showed that the human amygdala responds and rapidly habituates preferentially to fearful facial expressions over neutral ones. They also observed significant amygdala signal changes in response to happy faces over neutral faces.

Blackford, Allen, Cowan, and Avery (2012) compared the effect of an extremely inhibited temperament and an extremely uninhibited temperament on habituation. Their study found that over repeated presentations individuals with an uninhibited temperament demonstrated habituation in both the amygdala and hippocampus, whereas participants with an inhibited temperament demonstrated habituation in neither brain region. The researchers suggest that this failure to habituate reflects a social learning deficit in individuals with an extremely inhibited temperament, which is a possible mechanism for a higher risk of social anxiety.

==Debate about learning-status==
Although habituation has been regarded as a learning process by some as early as 1887, its learning status remained controversial up until the 1920s - 1930s. While conceding that reflexes may &quot;relax&quot; or otherwise decrease with repeated stimulation, the &quot;invariance doctrine&quot; stipulated that reflexes should not remain constant and that variable reflexes were a pathological manifestation. Indeed, air pilots who showed habituation of post-rotational nystagmus reflex were sometimes ejected from or not recruited for service for World War I: on the grounds that a variable reflex response indicated either a defective vestibular apparatus or a lack of vigilance. Eventually, however, more research from the medical and scientific communities concluded that stimulus-dependent variability reflexes is clinically normal. The opposition to the considering habituation a form of learning was also based on the assumption that learning processes must produce novel behavioral responses and must occur in the cerebral cortex. Non-associative forms of learning such as habituation (and sensitization) do not produce novel (conditioned) responses but rather diminish a pre-existing (innate) responses and often are shown to depend on peripheral (non-cerebral) synaptic changes in the sensory-motor pathway. Most modern learning theorists, however, consider &quot;any&quot; behavioral change that occurs as a result of experience to be learning, so long as it cannot be accounted for by motor fatigue, sensory adaptation, developmental changes or damage.

Criteria for verifying a response-decline as learning

Importantly, systematic response-declines can be produced by non-learning factors such as sensory adaptation (obstruction of stimulus detection), motor fatigue, or damage. Three diagnostic criteria are used to distinguish response-declines produced by these non-learning factors and response-declines produced by habituation (learning) processes. These are:

# &quot;Recovery by Dishabituation&quot;
# &quot;Sensitivity of Spontaneous Recovery to Rate-of-Stimulation&quot; 
# &quot;Stimulus-specificity&quot;

Early studies relied on the demonstration of 1) Recovery by Dishabituation (the brief recovery of the response to the eliciting stimulus when another stimulus is added) to distinguish habituation from sensory adaptation and fatigue. More recently, 2) &quot;Sensitivity of Spontaneous Recovery to Rate-of-Stimulation&quot; and 3) &quot;Stimulus-specificity&quot; have been used as experimental evidence for the habituation process. Spontaneous Recovery is sensitive to spontaneous recovery, showing recovery that is inversely correlated with the amount of response-decline. This is the opposite of what would be expected if sensory adaptation or motor fatigue were the cause of the response-decline. Sensory adaptation (or neural adaptation) occurs when an organism can no longer detect the stimulus as efficiently as when first presented and motor fatigue occurs when an organism is able to detect the stimulus but can no longer respond efficiently. Stimulus-specificity stipulates that the response-decline is not general (due to motor fatigue) but occurs only to the original stimulus that was repeated. If a response-decline shows 1) dishabituation, 2) spontaneous recovery that is inversely correlated with the extent of decline, and/or 3) stimulus-specificity, then habituation learning is supported.

Despite the ubiquity of habituation and its modern acceptance as a genuine form of learning it has not enjoyed the same focus within research as other forms of learning. On this topic, the animal psychologist James McConnell said &quot;...nobody cares…much about habituation&quot;). It has been suggested that the apathy held towards habituation is due to 1) resistance from traditional learning theorists maintain memory requires reproduction of propositional/linguistic content; 2) resistance from behaviorists who maintain that &quot;true&quot; learning requires the development of a novel response (whereas habituation is a decrease in a pre-existing response); 3) the behavioral measure of habituation (i.e., a response-decline) is very susceptible to confound by non-learning factors (e.g., fatigue) which, therefore, make it more difficult to study).

==Theories==
Various models have been proposed to account for habituation including the Stimulus-Model Comparator theory formulated by Evgeny Sokolov, the Groves and Thompson dual-process theory, and the SOP (Standard Operating Procedures/Sometimes Opponent Process) model formulated by Allan Wagner

=== Stimulus-model comparator theory ===
The stimulus-model comparator theory emerged from the research of Sokolov who used the orienting response as the cornerstone of his studies, and operationally defining the orienting response as EEG activity. Orienting responses are heightened sensitivity experienced by an organism when exposed to a new or changing stimulus. Orienting responses can result in overt, observable behaviors as well as psychophysiological responses such as EEG activity and undergo habituation with repeated presentation of the eliciting stimulus. The Sokolov model assumes that when a stimulus is experienced several times, the nervous system creates a model of the expected stimulus (a stimulus model). With additional presentations of the stimulus, the experienced stimulus is compared with the stimulus model. If the experienced stimulus matches the stimulus model, responding is inhibited. At first the stimulus model is not a very good representation of the presented stimulus, and thus responding continues because of this mismatch. With additional presentations the stimulus model is improved, there is no longer a mismatch, and responding is inhibited causing habituation. However, if the stimulus is changed so that it no longer matches the stimulus model, the orienting response is no longer inhibited. Sokolov locates the stimulus model in the cerebral cortex.

=== Dual-process theory ===
The Groves and Thompson dual-process theory of habituation posits that two separate processes exist in the central nervous system that interacts to produce habituation. The two distinct processes are a habituation process and a sensitization process. The dual-process theory argues that all noticeable stimuli will elicit both of these processes and that the behavioral output will reflect a summation of both processes. The habituation process is decremental, whereas the sensitization process is incremental enhancing the tendency to respond. Thus when the habituation process exceeds the sensitization process behavior shows habituation, but if the sensitization process exceeds the habituation process, behavior shows sensitization. Groves and Thompson hypothesize the existence of two neural pathways: an &quot;S-R pathway&quot; involved with the habituation process, and a &quot;state pathway&quot; involved with sensitization. The state system is seen as equivalent to a general state of arousal.

==Examples of the habituation process in animals and humans==
Habituation has been observed in an enormously wide range of species from motile single-celled organisms such as the amoeba and &quot;Stentor coeruleus&quot; to sea slugs to humans. Habituation processes are adaptive, allowing animals to adjust their innate behaviors to changes in their natural world. A natural animal instinct, for example, is to protect themselves and their territory from any danger and potential predators. An animal needs to respond quickly to the sudden appearance of a predator. What may be less obvious is the importance of defensive responses to the sudden appearance of any new, unfamiliar stimulus, whether it is dangerous or not. An initial defensive response to a new stimulus is important because if an animal fails to respond to a potentially dangerous unknown stimulus, the results could be deadly. Despite this initial, innate defensive response to an unfamiliar stimulus, the response becomes habituated if the stimulus repeatedly occurs but causes no harm. An example of this is the prairie dog habituating to humans. Prairie dogs give alarm calls when they detect a potentially dangerous stimulus. This defensive call occurs when any mammal, snake, or large bird approaches them. However, they habituate to noises, such as human footsteps, that occur repeatedly but result in no harm to them. If prairie dogs never habituate to nonthreatening stimuli, they would be constantly sending out alarm calls and wasting their time and energy. However, the habituation process in prairie dogs may depend on several factors including the particular defensive response. In one study that measured several different responses to the repeated presence of humans, the alarm calls of prairie dogs showed habituation whereas the behavior of escaping into their burrows showed sensitization.

Another example of the importance of habituation in the animal world is provided by a study with harbor seals. In one study researchers measured the responses of harbor seals to underwater calls of different types of killer whales. The seals showed a strong response when they heard the calls of mammal-eating killer whales. However, they did not respond strongly when hearing familiar calls of the local fish-eating population. The seals, therefore, are capable of habituating to the calls of harmless predators, in this case, harmless killer whales. While some researchers prefer to simply describe the adaptive value of observable habituated behavior, others find it useful to infer psychological processes from the observed behavior change. For example, habituation of aggressive responses in male bullfrogs has been explained as &quot;an attentional or learning process that allows animals to form enduring mental representations of the physical properties of a repeated stimulus and to shift their focus of attention away from sources of irrelevant or unimportant stimulation&quot;.

Habituation of innate defensive behaviors is also adaptive in humans, such as habituation of a startle response to a sudden loud noise. But habituation is much more ubiquitous even in humans. An example of habituation that is an essential element of everyone&#x27;s life is the changing response to food as it is repeatedly experienced during a meal. When people eat the same food during a meal, they begin to respond less to the food as they become habituated to the motivating properties of the food and decrease their consumption. Eating less during a meal is usually interpreted as reaching satiety or &quot;getting full&quot;, but experiments suggest that habituation also plays an important role. Many experiments with animals and humans have shown that providing variety in a meal increases the amount that is consumed in a meal, most likely because habituation is stimulus-specific and because variety may introduce dishabituation effects. Food variety also slows the rate of habituation in children and may be an important contributing factor to the recent increases in obesity.

Richard Solomon and John Corbit (1974) proposed the opponent-process theory, arguing that habituation is also found in emotional responses. This theory proposes that not all emotional reactions to a stimulus change in the same way when the stimulus is presented repeatedly: some weaken (decrease) while others are strengthened (increase). The overall effect is that an outside stimulus provokes an emotional reaction that increases rapidly until it is at its most intense. Gradually, the emotional state declines to a level lower than normal and eventually returns to neutral. This pattern coincides with two internal processes referred to as the a-process and b-process. Hence, the opponent-process theory predicts that subjects will show no reaction following a stimulus after a repetition of this same stimulus. It is the after-reaction that is much larger and prolonged than if an initial reaction to a stimulus occurred.

== Relevance to neuropsychiatry ==
Habituation abnormalities have been repeatedly observed in a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), fragile X syndrome, schizophrenia, Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD), Huntington&#x27;s disease (HD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette&#x27;s syndrome (TS), and migraine. In human clinical studies, habituation is most often studied using the acoustic startle reflex; acoustic tones are delivered to participants through headphones and the subsequent eye-blink response is recorded directly by observation or by electromyography (EMG). Depending on the disorder, habituation phenomena have been implicated as a cause, symptom, or therapy. Reduced habituation is the most common habituation phenotype reported across neuropsychiatric disorders although enhanced habituation has been observed in HD and ADHD. It also appears that abnormal habituation is often predictive of symptom severity in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including ASD, PD, and HD. Moreover, there are instances where treatments that normalise the habituation-deficit also improve other associated symptoms. As a therapy, habituation processes have been hypothesized to underlie the efficacy of behavioural therapies (i.e. habit reversal training, exposure therapy) for TS and PTSD, although extinction processes may be operating instead.

==Uses and challenges of the habituation procedure==
Habituation procedures are used by researchers for many reasons. For example, in a study on aggression in female chimpanzees from a group known as the &quot;Kasakela Chimpanzee Community&quot;, researchers habituated the chimpanzees by repeatedly exposing them to the presence of human beings. Their efforts to habituate the chimpanzees before the field researchers studied the animal&#x27;s behavior was necessary in order for them to eventually be able to note the natural behavior of the chimpanzees, instead of simply noting chimpanzee behavior as a response to the presence of the researchers. In another study, Mitumba chimpanzees in the Gombe National Park were habituated for at least four years before the introduction of systematic data collection.

Researchers also use habituation and dishabituation procedures in the laboratory to study the perceptual and cognitive capabilities of human infants. The presentation of a visual stimulus to an infant elicits looking behavior that habituates with repeated presentations of the stimulus. When changes to the habituated stimulus are made (or a new stimulus is introduced), the looking behavior returns (dishabituates). A recent fMRI study revealed that the presentation of a dishabituating stimulus has an observable, physical effect upon the brain. In one study the mental spatial representations of infants were assessed using the phenomenon of dishabituation. Infants were presented repeatedly with an object in the same position on a table. Once the infants habituated to the object (i.e., spent less time looking at it) either the object was spatially moved while the infant remained at the same place near the table or the object was left in the same place but the infant was moved to the opposite side of the table. In both cases, the spatial relationship between the object and the infant had changed, but only in the former case did the object itself move. Would the infants know the difference? Or would they treat both cases as if the object itself moved? The results revealed a return of looking behavior (dishabituation) when the object&#x27;s position was changed, but not when the infant&#x27;s position was changed. Dishabituation indicates that infants perceived a significant change in the stimulus. Therefore, the infants understood when the object itself moved and when it did not. Only when the object itself moved were they interested in it again (dishabituation). When the object remained in the same position as before it was perceived as the same old boring thing (habituation). In general, habituation/dishabituation procedures help researchers determine the way infants perceive their environments.

Habituation is a useful primary tool for then assessing mental processes in the stages of infancy. The purpose for these tests, or paradigms records looking time, which is the baseline measurement. Habituation of looking time helps to assess certain child capabilities such as: memory, sensitivity, and helps the baby recognize certain abstract properties. Habituation is also found to be influenced by unchangeable factors such as infant age, gender, and complexity of the stimulus. (Caron &amp; Caron, 1969; Cohen, DeLoache, &amp; Rissman, 1975; Friedman, Nagy, &amp; Carpenter, 1970; Miller, 1972; Wetherford &amp; Cohen, 1973).

Though there are various challenges that come with habituation. Some infants have preferences for some stimuli based on their static or dynamic properties. Infant dishabituation also is not perceived as a direct measure for mental processes as well. In previous theories of habituation, an infant&#x27;s dishabituation was thought to represent their own realization of the remembered stimulus of stimuli. For example: if infants would be dishabituated to a certain color item to a new item, it would be noticed that they remembered the color and compared the two colors for differences. Also, another challenge that comes with habituation is the dichotomy of novelty vs familiar stimuli. If an infant preferred a novel still, this meant the infant observed the new spatial relation of the object, but not the object itself. If an infant preferred familiarity, the infant would notice the pattern of the stimuli, instead of the actual new stimuli.

The habituation/dishabituation procedure is also used to discover the resolution of perceptual systems. For instance, by habituating someone to one stimulus, and then observing responses to similar ones, one can detect the smallest degree of difference that is detectable.

He is the eldest son of British parents, Moreen Duff Muir (May 4, 1928 – May 18, 2022), a church organist for thirty years originally from Glasgow, Scotland, and composer of church music, and John E.

==Career==

Starting his career as a copywriter at ad agency McCann Erickson in 1974, Thomas became the head writer of the Coca-Cola account in Canada within a year. After watching a Second City stage show in Toronto, and while suffering from self-described &quot;boredom&quot; in his advertising work, he auditioned for the Second City troupe and was chosen as a performer. He was a cast member of the Toronto production of &quot;Godspell&quot;, along with Victor Garber, Martin Short, Eugene Levy, Gilda Radner, and Andrea Martin. Paul Shaffer was the musical director.

He first achieved fame as a cast member of the Canadian TV comedy series &quot;SCTV&quot;, joining &quot;Godspell&quot; castmates Levy, Martin and later Short, plus Rick Moranis, John Candy, Harold Ramis, Catherine O&#x27;Hara and others. Notable characters on the show include Doug McKenzie of beer-swilling brothers Bob and Doug McKenzie, editorialist Bill Needle, Scottish scone-chef/bluesman Angus Crock, motor-mouthed TV ad announcer Harvey K-Tel, Lowery organist/curio pitchman Tex Boil and the &quot;Cruising Gourmet&quot;.

Thomas&#x27;s first film role was in &quot;Home to Stay&quot;, directed by Delbert Mann, in which Thomas played in a scene with Hollywood legend Henry Fonda. He then wrote, co-directed, and starred in the Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie feature film &quot;Strange Brew&quot;. Soon after, he wrote for and acted in &quot;The New Show&quot;, produced by Lorne Michaels during his hiatus from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Short-lived, this show featured a powerhouse writing staff including Thomas along with Buck Henry, George Meyer, Jack Handey, Al Franken, Tom Davis, Valri Bromfield and Steve Martin. Thomas tried his hand at network television hour-long shows in 1986 when he wrote and co-executive produced &quot;Steel Collar Man&quot; for CBS. The pilot was produced but did not go to series.

In 1988, Thomas wrote another hour long show for CBS, &quot;B Men&quot;, which was back ordered, but Thomas took a directing job at Paramount, which caused the network to drop the series.

In 1995 Thomas starred in the ABC television film &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; with Mary Page Keller and Richard Karn.

In 1996, Thomas played the title role in the Fox television film &quot;Mr. Foster&#x27;s Field Trip&quot; aka &quot;Kidz in the Wood&quot; with Julia Duffy.

In 2005, he had a guest stint as Charlize Theron&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Trevor&quot; on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. In 2006, he reprised his voice role in &quot;Brother Bear 2&quot; and appeared as himself in the feature film &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;. He began production on &quot;ArnoldSpeaks.com&quot;, a video blog, as the voice of Arnold Schwarzenegger; Animax Entertainment won an Emmy for a broadband animated series produced for ESPN, &quot;Off Mikes&quot;.

In 2007, Thomas and Rick Moranis reprised their roles as Bob and Doug McKenzie in a one-hour special, &quot;Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie&#x27;s Two-Four Anniversary&quot;, for CBC Television. The show featured cameos from McKenzie celeb fans like Ben Stiller, Dave Foley, Tom Green, Paul Shaffer, Andy Dick, Matt Groening, Barry Pepper, Martin Short, and Geddy Lee. Former Prime Minister of Canada Paul Martin was the host. In 2008, Thomas revived Bob and Doug McKenzie in a new animated series, &quot;Bob &amp; Doug&quot;. While Thomas reprises the character of Doug in the new series, Moranis chose not to voice the character of Bob, which instead is voiced by Dave Coulier. Moranis is, however, involved in the series as an executive producer.

In November 2009, Thomas received an Honorary Doctor of Letters from his alma mater McMaster University and gave the fall convocation speech. In 2010 Animax continued to produce branded entertainment, advertising and digital shorts for corporations like Disney, Warner Brothers, NBC Universal, and Kodak.

<text>In algebraic geometry, Brill–Noether theory, introduced by , is the study of special divisors, certain divisors on a curve that determine more compatible functions than would be predicted. In classical language, special divisors move on the curve in a &quot;larger than expected&quot; linear system of divisors.

Throughout, we consider a projective smooth curve over the complex numbers (or over some other algebraically closed field).

The condition to be a special divisor can be formulated in sheaf cohomology terms, as the non-vanishing of the cohomology of the sheaf of sections of the invertible sheaf or line bundle associated to . This means that, by the Riemann–Roch theorem, the cohomology or space of holomorphic sections is larger than expected.

Alternatively, by Serre duality, the condition is that there exist holomorphic differentials with divisor on the curve.

==Main theorems of Brill–Noether theory==

For a given genus , the moduli space for curves of genus should contain a dense subset parameterizing those curves with the minimum in the way of special divisors. One goal of the theory is to &#x27;count constants&#x27;, for those curves: to predict the dimension of the space of special divisors (up to linear equivalence) of a given degree , as a function of , that &quot;must&quot; be present on a curve of that genus.

The basic statement can be formulated in terms of the Picard variety of a smooth curve , and the subset of corresponding to divisor classes of divisors , with given values of and of in the notation of the Riemann–Roch theorem. There is a lower bound for the dimension of this subscheme in :

:formula_1

called the Brill–Noether number. The formula can be memorized via the mnemonic (using our desired formula_2 and Riemann-Roch) 
:formula_3

For smooth curves and for , the basic results about the space of linear systems on of degree and dimension are as follows.
* George Kempf proved that if then is not empty, and every component has dimension at least .
* William Fulton and Robert Lazarsfeld proved that if then is connected.
* showed that if is generic then is reduced and all components have dimension exactly (so in particular is empty if ).
* David Gieseker proved that if is generic then is smooth. By the connectedness result this implies it is irreducible if .
Other more recent results not necessarily in terms of space of linear systems are:

* Eric Larson (2017) proved that if , , and , the restriction maps formula_4 are of maximal rank, also known as the maximal rank conjecture.

* Eric Larson and Isabel Vogt (2022) proved that if then there is a curve interpolating through general points in if and only if formula_5 except in 4 exceptional cases:

<doc id="599867" wikidata="Q3536830" url="?curid=599867" title="Buckingham Canal">
<text>The Buckingham Canal is a -long fresh water navigation canal, that parallels the Coromandel Coast of South India from Kakinada of Andhra Pradesh to Parangipettai near Chidambaram of Tamil Nadu. The canal connects most of the natural backwaters along the coast to Chennai (Madras) port.

The canal was constructed during British rule, and was an important waterway during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Competition from rail and later road transport diminished its importance, and during the 20th century portions became unusable and badly polluted. More recently there is increased interest in the canal&#x27;s potential to protect coastal communities from flooding by tsunamis and cyclones as well as provide a navigable waterway, and projects have been undertaken to restore and improve the canal.

In the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party&#x27;s 2021 election manifesto, the party promised that the canal will be rehabilitated.

==Construction==

The first segment of the canal was a saltwater navigation canal, constructed in 1806 from Madras to Ennore for a distance of . It was initially called Cochrane&#x27;s Canal, after its principal financier Basil Cochrane. Subsequently, it was extended north to Pulicat Lake, north of Chennai. The canal was taken over by the government of Madras Presidency in 1837 and further extended, ultimately reaching north of Chennai to Gudivada Kalava on the banks of the Krishna River in Andhra Pradesh, and south of Chennai to Marakkanam in Tamil Nadu. It was briefly renamed Lord Clive&#x27;s Canal. However, the section in Chennai was known as Cochrane&#x27;s Canal for much of the 19th century.

During 1877 and 1878, the people of Chennai suffered from the terrible Great Famine and more than six million people perished. The stretch, linking the Adyar and Cooum rivers, was built in 1877–78 at a cost of as a famine relief work. The canal was named the Buckingham Canal in 1878 because the link, was built on the orders of the then Governor, the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos.

The canal lost its importance for many years as a result of the competition of the railways, and regained its importance after the Second World War. One of the works undertaken in the Second Five Year Plan was the development of the Buckingham Canal, including linking the canal with Madras harbour, with a contribution of Rs. 115 lakhs by the Central Government. This work was considered necessary to conserve an existing asset serving as an inter-state waterway supplementing the railway capacity and providing a useful means of transport for large quantities of goods between the States of Andhra and Madras.

==Course of the canal==
The canal runs approximately back from the coastline. It joins up a series of natural backwaters, and fed by tidal waters from the sea through rivers and creeks. The Cooum River connects the canal to the Bay of Bengal in the center of Chennai. The portion north of the Cooum is known as the North Buckingham Canal, and the portion south of the Cooum as the South Buckingham Canal. of the canal is in Andhra Pradesh, and is in Tamil Nadu. Approximately is within the city limits of Chennai.
In Andhra Pradesh it joins the Cammamar Canal at the Krishna delta, just north of Pallipalem which in turn is connected with the canals of the Godavari delta. The complete inter-connected system presents a continuous 400 miles of navigable channel along the coast.

==Decline in usage==
The canal was used to convey goods up and down the coast from Vijayawada to Madras (now Chennai). The cyclones of 1965/1966 and 1976 damaged the canal, and it is little used and no longer well maintained. Within the city of Chennai the canal is badly polluted from sewage and industrial effluents, and the silting up of the canal has left the water stagnant, creating an attractive habitat for malaria-spreading mosquitoes. The North Chennai Thermal Power Station (NCTP) discharges hot water and fly ash into the canal. In agricultural areas south of Chennai, the former tow path along the scenic areas is used for light motorcycle and bicycle traffic. On 1 January 2001 the Government of India launched a project to prevent sewage discharge into the canal and Chennai&#x27;s other waterways, and to dredge the canal to remove accumulated sediment and improve water flow.

Within the city limits of Chennai much of the canal has been used as the route of the elevated Chennai Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS). MRTS stations such as Kotturpuram, Kasturba Nagar and Indira Nagar have encroached on the canal and narrowed the width of the canal to less than 50 meters in a few places.

Buckingham Canal is the most polluted of the three major waterways in the city with nearly 60 per cent of the estimated 55 million litres of untreated sewage being let into it daily, including by Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board.

==Effect of the 2004 tsunami==

Dr. B. Ramalingeswara Rao first identified the buffer zone action of the Buckingham Canal when he visited the coastal areas of . He recommended to the Government to renovate it to mitigate tsunami hazards in the future. Further, he reported in 2005, during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami or also known as the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami , the Buckingham Canal acted as a buffer zone and regulated the tsunami waves on the coastal region over nearly from Pedda Ganjam to Chennai. The canal all along the coast was filled with tsunami water, which overflowed at a few places and receded back to sea within 10-15 min. This helped save the lives of several fishermen, especially in coastal Andhra Pradesh and parts of Chennai city and also helped in clearing of the aquaculture debris. The natural growth of vegetation on either side of the canal, has had an effect in tsunami mitigation; for example in Vakadu Mandal at villages like Pudikappam, Srinivasapuram and Tudipalem, the damage was minimal.

Dr. B. R. Rao further stressed on the extension of the Buckingham Canal up to Vedaranyam in order to protect the Tamil Nadu coast from the fury of tsunamis in future. The maximum magnitude MW 8.5 may occur in future in Sumatra because of its continuous subduction activity.

==Cause of 2014 floods==
Buckingham canal drains water from south Chennai. A 2014 CAG report revealed that a diversion channel from Buckingham canal near Okkiyum Maduvu to the sea (drain project under JNNURM scheme) could have saved south Chennai from flooding. But the government dropped the 100 crore JNNURM scheme, which if completed, would have drained flood water at 3,500 cubic feet per second from southern neighborhoods. The 2014 CAG report said defective planning of flood control projects caused delay and increased cost, defeating the objective of the scheme. &quot;The fact is that alleviation of inundation of flood water in Chennai city remains largely un-achieved,&quot; it said.

==Revamp of the canal==

Revival of Buckingham Canal took shape by government&#x27;s National Waterway 4 (NW-4) declaration in November 2008. Both North Buckingham (Peddaganjam, Ongole-Chennai) and south Buckingham (basin bridge, Chennai - Marakkanam) canal will be developed under the proposed National Waterway 4 by Inland Waterways Authority of India. Periodically, government of Tamil Nadu also takes up dredging and widening of the canal through Water Resources Department, Public Works Department (PWD). With the provisions of State-Center shared Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), PWD has started widening the South Buckingham Canal from Okkiyam Madu to Muttukadu for a stretch of About has been allocated under the JNNURM for integrated development of waterways and macro drainages like Buckingham canal, Otteri Nullah, Virugambakkam – Arumbakkam drain, Cooum and Adyar river. Despite the development, the central section of the canal running through the most congested areas of Chennai, a length of will remain unnavigable due to severe encroachments and construction of the Chennai Mass Rapid Transport System.

On 22 January 2010, Government of Tamil Nadu has reconstituted the &quot;Adayar Poonga Trust&quot; as &quot;Chennai River Restoration Trust&quot; for restoration of Chennai rivers (Adayar river, Cooum river) including the Buckingham Canal.

In 2011 improvements were being undertaken on the stretch between Okkiyam Madu and Muttukadu under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. The canal was being widened to and a U.S.A.-built dredge was being used to deepen the canal to . Also under this project, six small causeways across the canal would be reconstructed into single-lane bridges.

==Bridges connecting ECR and OMR==
In 2018, the Chennai Corporation proposed to construct six bridges across the canal, linking East Coast Road and Old Mahabalipuram Road, along a length of 4.5 kilometers of the canal. They include Venkatesapuram–Elango Nagar (costing 46.3 million), Venkatesapuram–Gandhi Road (costing 46.2 million), Kamarajar Salai–Veeramani Salai (costing 60 million), Maniammai Street–Dr. Ambedkar Salai (costing 96.6 million), Pandian Street–Anna Nagar (costing 62.1 million), and Gandhi Nagar–Pandian Nagar (costing 52.9 million).

<text>Faido (; ) is the capital of the district of Leventina in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino in southern Switzerland.

On 29 January 2006, Faido grew by incorporating the villages of Chiggiogna, Rossura, and Calonico.

On 1 April 2012, Faido grew again when it incorporated the former municipalities of Anzonico, Calpiogna, Campello, Cavagnago, Chironico, Mairengo and Osco.

It grew again on 10 April 2016 when Sobrio was absorbed into the municipality.

==History==
The municipality is first documented in 1171 as &quot;Faedo&quot;. In German it was previously known as &quot;Feit&quot; or &quot;Pfaid&quot;. Crucial for the development of the municipality into a regional center was the location in the middle of the valley and at the foot of the gorge of Mount Piottino. The mountain was a barrier to passenger and goods transport, which required a stop and facilities for travelers. Additionally, under Uri&#x27;s rule (15th–18th century), it was the capital of the Levantina and a key to Uri&#x27;s control of the Ticino. The meetings of the local head of the Levantine (parlamento generale) and the Council of the valley community were held in Faido.

The former &quot;Vicinanza&quot; of Faido (based in Mairengo) consisted of three &quot;Degagna&quot;.

During the Middle Ages the church of San Siro in Mairengo (first mentioned in 1171) was the baptistery of the &quot;Vicinanza&quot;. The village church of S. Andrea in Faido was first mentioned in the 13th century. Following the fire of 1331, it was rebuilt and in 1579 was elevated to a parish church. It was expanded in 1830. The Chapel of St. Bernardino of Siena from 1459 was under the patronage of the Varesi family, which also owned a six-story tower house. In 1607, a Capuchin monastery was founded, which was for a long time the seat of the Seminary of the Capuchins and cultural center. The monastery school was open to boys from the valley. The monastery complex includes the Church of San Francesco, built in 1608, and rebuilt in 1785/86.
The history of the 19th century in the valley, revolved about the Gotthard road (built 1820–30) and the Gotthard Rail Tunnel (1871–1881). The railway encouraged the founding various hotels (including the Hôtel Suisse in 1905) and the spread of crafts and small industries. In 1889, Faido was the first town in Ticino with electric lighting. Like most of the Leventina, many inhabitants emigrated to France, England, Australia and America. However, Faido also experienced an immigration of artisans and the establishment of small industrial enterprises, some of them as branches of government-operated enterprises. Most of these small businesses have since disappeared or moved. Before World War I, the village was, especially with Milanese families, a popular and bustling holiday resort. The Leventiner Hospital S. Croce was built in 1917 on the initiative of the clergy. It is a retirement home since 1992. The current District Hospital was built in 1923 at the request of residents and civic communities of the Levantine. In 1976 Faido fought successfully against the fragmentation of the municipal area by the highway and got a bypass tunnel.

In the spring of 2004, the residents voted for incorporating the surrounding municipalities of Chiggiogna, Osco, Mairengo, Calpiogna, Campello, Rossura, Calonico, Anzonico, Cavagnago, and Sobrio. Most of the municipalities rejected the proposition, and the new municipality consists of Faido, Chiggiogna, Rossura, and Calonico.

The municipality is the district capital and home of the district court of the Leventina. In 2006 Faido merged with Fuso, Chiggiogna, Faido and Rossura. It grew again following the 2012 merger with Anzonico, Calpiogna, Campello, Cavagnago, Chironico, Mairengo and Osco.

<doc id="599870" wikidata="Q84604882" url="?curid=599870" title="Observer bias">
<text>Observer bias is one of the types of detection bias and is defined as any kind of systematic divergence from accurate facts during observation and the recording of data and information in studies. The definition can be further expanded upon to include the systematic difference between what is observed due to variation in observers, and what the true value is.

Observer bias is the tendency of observers to not see what is there, but instead to see what they expect or want to see. This is a common occurrence in the everyday lives of many and is a significant problem that is sometimes encountered in scientific research and studies. Observation is critical to scientific research and activity, and as such, observer bias may be as well. When such biases exist, scientific studies can result in an over- or underestimation of what is true and accurate, which compromises the validity of the findings and results of the study, even if all other designs and procedures in the study were appropriate.

Observational data forms the foundation of a significant body of knowledge. Observation is a method of data collection and falls into the category of qualitative research techniques. There are a number of benefits of observation, including its simplicity as a data collection method and its usefulness for hypotheses. Simultaneously, there are many limitations and disadvantages in the observation process, including the potential lack of reliability, poor validity, and faulty perception. Participants&#x27; observations are widely used in sociological and anthropological studies, while systematic observation is used where researchers need to collect data without participants direct interactions. The most common observation method is naturalistic observation, where subjects are observed in their natural environments with the goal to assess the behaviour in an intervention free and natural setting.

Observer bias is especially probable when the investigator or researcher has vested interests in the outcome of the research or has strong preconceptions. Coupled with ambiguous underlying data and a subjective scoring method, these three factors contribute heavily to the incidence of observer bias.

== Examples ==
Examples of observer bias extend back to the early 1900s. One of the first recorded events of apparent observer bias was seen in 1904, with the case of &quot;Clever Hans&quot;. Clever Hans was a horse whose owner, Wilhem von Olson, claimed could solve arithmetic equations. Von Olson would ask Clever Hans a series of questions involving arithmetic functions, and the horse would appear to answer by tapping its hoof with the numbered answer. This example was investigated by the psychologist Oskar Pfungst, and it was found that when the horse was nearing the correct number of taps, the owner would subconsciously react in a particular way, which signalled to Clever Hans to discontinue his tapping. This only worked, however, when the owner himself knew the answer to the question. This is an example of observer bias, due to the fact that the expectations of von Olson, the horse&#x27;s owner, were the cause of Clever Hans actions and behaviours, resulting in faulty data.

One of the most notorious examples of observer bias is seen in the studies and contributions of Cyril Burt, an English psychologist and geneticist who purported the heritability of IQ. Burt believed, and thus demonstrated through his research because of his observer bias, that children from families with lower socioeconomic status were likely to have lower levels of cognitive abilities when compared with that of children from families with higher socioeconomic status. Such research and findings had considerable impacts on the educational system in England throughout the 1960s, where middle- and upper-class children were sent to elite schools while the children from the lower socioeconomic demographic were sent to schools with less desirable traits. Following Burt&#x27;s death, further research found that the data in Burt&#x27;s studies was fabricated, which was presumed to be a result of his observer bias and the outcomes he was intending to find through his studies.

Another key example of observer bias is a 1963 study, &quot;Psychology of the Scientist: V. Three Experiments in Experimenter Bias&quot;, published by researchers Robert Rosenthal and Kermit L. Fode at the University of North Dakota. In this study, Rosenthal and Fode gave a group of twelve psychology students a total of sixty rats to run in some experiments. The students were told that they either had &quot;maze-bright&quot; rats, who were bred to be exceptionally good at solving mazes, or that they had &quot;maze-dull&quot; rats, who were bred to be poor at solving mazes. They were then asked to run experiments with the rats and collect the data as they usually would. The rats were placed in T-shaped mazes where they had to run down the center and then decide to turn left or turn right. One of the sides of the maze was painted white, while the other was painted dark gray, and it was the rat&#x27;s job to always turn towards the dark gray side of the maze. The rats who turned towards the dark gray side of the maze received a reward, while the rats who turned towards the white side of the maze did not. The students kept track of how many times each rat turned towards the correct (or dark gray) side of the maze, how many times each rat turned towards the incorrect (or white) side of the maze, and how long it took each rat to make a decision. They repeated this experiment ten times per day, all over the course of five days total, and in the end, they found that the &quot;maze-bright&quot; rats were better at both correctly completing the maze and completing the maze in the fastest time. However, there were actually no &quot;maze-bright&quot; or &quot;maze-dull&quot; rats; these rats were all genetically identical to one another and were randomly divided into the two categories. The two groups of students should have gotten the same results for both kinds of rats, but failed to do so because of observer bias. The entire effect of the experiment was caused by their expectations: they expected that the &quot;maze-bright&quot; rats would perform better and that the &quot;maze-dull&quot; rats would perform worse. Rosenthal and Fode concluded that these results were caused by smaller and more subtle biases on the part of the students. The students were unaware of the fact that they were treating the rats differently. It&#x27;s possible that they had slightly different criteria for when the two groups of rats finished the maze, that they had the tendency to hit the stopwatch later for the &quot;maze-dull&quot; rats, or that they were paying more attention to the &quot;maze-bright&quot; rats overall. In this way, the students, or the observers, created what looked like a real result, but what was, in reality, totally false.

== Impact ==
Observational data forms the foundation of a significant body of knowledge. Observer bias can be seen as a significant issue in medical research and treatment. There is greater potential for variance in observations made where subjective judgement is required, when compared with observation of objective data where there is a much lower risk of observer bias.

When there is observer bias present in research and studies, the data collection itself is affected. The findings and results are not accurate representations of reality, due to the influence of the observers&#x27; biases. Although they may not intend to do so, observer bias may result in researchers subconsciously encouraging certain results, which would lead to changes in the findings and outcomes in the study. A researcher that has not taken steps to mitigate observer bias and is being influenced by their own observer bias has a higher probability of making erroneous interpretations, which ultimately will lead to inaccurate results and findings.

Research has shown that in the presence of observer bias in outcome assessment, it is possible for treatment effect estimates to be exaggerated by between a third to two-thirds, symbolising significant implications on the validity of the findings and results of studies and procedures.

== Preventative steps ==

Bias is unfortunately an unavoidable problem in epidemiological and clinical research. However, there are a number of potential strategies and solutions for the reduction of observer bias, specifically in the areas of scientific studies and research across the medical field. The effects that bias has can be reduced through the use of strong operational definitions, along with masking, triangulation, and standardisation of procedures, and the continual monitoring of the objectivity of those conducting the experiments and observations. In market research surveys, researchers have described a framework called bias testing to mitigate researcher bias by empirically testing the survey questions with real-life respondents, and to not lead the respondents, neutral probing and redirecting techniques are used.

Blinded protocols and double-blinded research can act as a corrective lens in terms of reducing observer bias, and thus, to increase the reliability and accuracy of the data collected. Blind trials are often required in order for the attainment of regulatory approval for medical devices and drugs, but are not common practice in empirical studies despite the research supporting its necessity. Double-blinding is done by ensuring both the tester and research participants lack of information that could have a potential influence on their behaviour, while single-blind describes those experiments where information is withheld from the participants that may otherwise skew the results or introduce bias, but the experimenter is entirely aware of and in possession of those facts.

An example of how observer bias can impact on research, and how blinded protocols can impact, can be seen in the trial for an anti-psychotic drug. Researchers that know which of the subjects received the placebo and those that received the trial drugs may later report that the group that received the trial drugs had a calmer disposition, due to the expectations of that outcome. Similarly, if the participants in the trial were not blinded, then they may report how they are feeling differently based on whether they were provided with the placebo or the trial drug.

A further example could be seen at schools. Boys of school-age generally outperform their female peers in science, however there is evidence that this is potentially as a result of how they are taught and treated by their teachers, who have the expectation that the boys have higher performances, and thus subtly encourage them. As such, the observers, being the teachers who conduct tests and evaluate the results, have a bias and preconceived belief that boys will outperform girls, which impacts on their behaviour.

To complement blind or masked protocols and research, further strategies including standardised training for observers and researchers about how to record findings can be useful in the mitigation of observer bias. Clear definition of methodology, tools and the time frames allocated for the collection of findings can assist in adequately training and preparing observers in a standardised manner. Further, identifying any potential conflicts of interest within observers before commencement of the research is essential in ensuring bias is minimised.

Finally, triangulation within research is a method that can be used to increase the findings validity and credibility. Triangulation in research refers to the use of a variety of methods or data sources as a means of developing a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the subject at hand. Triangulation will considerably increase the confidence in a study tremendously. There are a few ways triangulation can occur, including the use of multiple observers, which is a form of reliability in itself called interobserver reliability, measured by the percentage of times that the observers agree.

== Hawthorne effect (observer effect) ==
Observer bias is commonly only identified in the observers, however, there also exists a bias for those being studied. Named after a series of experiments conducted by Elton Mayo between 1924 and 1932, at the Western Electric factory in Hawthorne, Chicago, the Hawthorne effect symbolises where the participants in a study change their behaviour due to the fact that they are being observed.

Within the Hawthorne studies, it was found that the departmental outputs increased each time a change was made, even when the changes made were reverting to the original unfavourable conditions. The subjects in the experiment were told that better lighting would result in improved productivity, and as such, their beliefs about the impact of good lighting had a more significant effect on their behaviour and output than what the actual lighting levels were. Researchers formed the conclusion that the workers were in fact responding to the attention of the supervisors, not the changes in the experimental variables.

To prevent the Hawthorne effect, studies using hidden observation can be useful. However, knowledge of participation in the study would be required by law and is thought to still have the potential to cause the induction of the Hawthorne effect. Further, making responses or study data completely anonymous will result in reducing the likelihood of participants altering their behaviour as a result of being observed as they take part in an experiment or study. Furthermore, conducting research prior to the studies to establish a baseline measure could assist in mitigating the Hawthorne effect from biasing the studies results significantly. With a baseline established, any potential participant bias that arises as a result of being observed can be evaluated. Furthermore, establishing a follow-up period could be of benefit to enable the examination of whether a behaviour or change continues and is sustained beyond the observation period.

<text>Erigeron abajoensis, the Abajo fleabane, is a species of &quot;Erigeron&quot; in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Utah in the western United States, and has been found also in neighboring parts of Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. It grows on sunny, dry, rocky slopes generally at elevations of 2,270 to 3,400 meters (7550–11350 feet).

&quot;Erigeron abajoensis&quot; is a short (5 to 25 cm or 2-10 inches tall) perennial plant. The leaves are narrowly oblanceolate (i.e. with a broad-rounded apex and a tapering base), set with stiff, straight bristles and located at the base of the stem. The flower heads are sometimes produced one at a time, sometimes in groups of 3 or 4. Each head contains as many as 60 blue or pink or white ray florets and many yellow disc florets, all produced in the summer.

The species is named for the Abajo Mountains in southern Utah.

<text>Elizabeth Reid McCombs (née Henderson, 19 November 1873 – 7 June 1935) was a New Zealand politician of the Labour Party who in 1933 became the first woman elected to the New Zealand Parliament. New Zealand women gained the right to vote in 1893, though were not allowed to stand for the House of Representatives until the election of 1919. McCombs had previously contested elections in 1928 and 1931.

==Early years==
McCombs was born in Kaiapoi, North Canterbury, New Zealand. She was one of the nine children of Alice and Daniel Henderson. The family spent some years living in Ashburton, but in about 1882 the family moved to Christchurch. A passion for activism was embedded in her family, as some of her siblings were notable activists themselves. Two of McCombs&#x27; sisters, Stella Henderson and Christina Kirk Henderson, were both in the public eye; Stella writing for a prominent New Zealand newspaper, and Christina advocating for the suffrage movement. 

In 1886, her alcoholic father died, leaving her family in financial difficulty for a time.

==Politics==


McCombs became interested in socialism through the influence of her elder sisters, who were involved in the Progressive Liberal Association, a small socialist-orientated group. One of the Progressive Liberal Association&#x27;s goals was to increase the political rights of women. McCombs herself became involved in the Association, and as an extension of this, with the New Zealand Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, run by prominent New Zealand suffragist Kate Sheppard. McCombs held a number of positions within the Temperance Union throughout her life, including that of national treasurer.

In 1903, McCombs married James McCombs, a strong socialist who had also been involved with the Progressive Liberal Association. They were to have two children, and adopted two more. James McCombs was active in left-wing political circles, and was later to become an MP for the Social Democratic Party. When the Labour Party was founded in 1916, he became its first president. At the same time, Elizabeth McCombs was elected to the party&#x27;s executive, alongside another woman, Sarah Snow.

In 1921, McCombs gained election to the Christchurch City Council, being the second woman to do so. She remained a member of the council until 1935, when she chose to step down. During this time, she was also active in a large number of other organisations, including hospital boards and charities. Her work was recognised in 1926, when she was made a Justice of the peace.

In the 1928 elections, McCombs stood (unsuccessfully) for the Kaiapoi electorate, as the Labour Party&#x27;s first female nominee. In the 1931 elections, she contested the seat of Christchurch North, also unsuccessfully.

=== Parliamentary career ===
On the death in August 1933 of McCombs&#x27; husband James, who had held his parliamentary seat of Lyttelton since 1913, it was suggested that Elizabeth McCombs herself should be the Labour Party&#x27;s new candidate for the Lyttelton seat. Some members of the party were initially hesitant, but she was eventually selected as the Labour candidate. When the 1933 by-election was held on 13 September, McCombs won resoundingly: James had been returned by only 32 votes in the 1931 elections, but Elizabeth received a majority of 2600 votes, electing her the first woman Member of Parliament.

She made her maiden speech on 28 September. 

===Issues===
In parliament, McCombs spoke out on a number of issues, many of which involved women&#x27;s rights and welfare. Among the causes she promoted were:

* Equal pay for women.
* Changes to unemployment policy, which was more generous towards unemployed men than unemployed women.
* Recruitment of women into the police force.
* Raising the age of marriage (then 12 for girls and 14 for boys).
In a 1926 article in Christchurch newspaper &quot;The Press&quot;, McCombs was described as being &quot;impatient with working people, tending to represent their best interests and not necessarily their opinions. She called a deputation representing the unemployed &quot;an illogical crowd&quot; when they said they wanted work but criticised having to work for charitable aid.&quot;

==Illness and death==
Increasingly poor health made it difficult for McCombs to participate fully in politics. She died in Christchurch on 7 June 1935 aged 61, less than two years after entering parliament.

In 1935, she was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Despite her short career in parliament, she demonstrated that women could successfully seek election, and it was not long before a second woman (Catherine Stewart in 1938, elected for Wellington West) entered parliament. In her Lyttelton electorate, she was succeeded by her son Terry McCombs, who was the Minister of Education in the First Labour Government from 1947 to 1949. Terry McCombs held the Lyttelton seat until 1951, concluding a 38-year family hold on the seat.

<text>Beihang University (BUAA; formerly as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics) is a public university in Haidian, Beijing, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

The school was founded as Beijing Aeronautics College () in 1952 by the merger of the aerospace engineering departments from eight elite universities at that time, including Peiyang University, Tsinghua University, Xiamen University, Sichuan University, and Chongqing University. In April 1988, the school was renamed Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. BUAA is dubbed one of the Seven Sons of National Defence.

Beihang University has 1 national laboratory, 9 national key laboratories (including 4 defense technology key laboratories), 6 national engineering centers and 3 Beijing Advanced Innovation Centers. The university has more than 40 research achievements that are the first in China and has won three top national science and technology awards more than 70 times.

== History ==

As the first aerospace higher education institution in New China and the cradle of Red Aeronautical Engineers, Beihang University has been a key national higher education institution since its establishment. Beihang University is one of the first batch of national key universities (1959), among the first batch of 211 project universities (1997) and the first batch of world-class academic construction universities (Class A) (2017), which ranks seventh to has taken the tenth place. It is the key institution of higher education in the five-year plan. This university is a member of the 985 main project university. Also selected for Project Everest, Project 211, Project 111, and Outstanding Engineering Education.

=== Genesis ===
The aviation departments of the eight universities that participated in the founding of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics were: Tsinghua University, Peiyang University, Northwestern Polytechnic College (today&#x27;s Northwestern Polytechnic University), Xiamen University, and the Faculty of North China University. Engineering (today&#x27;s Beijing Institute of Technology), the aviation departments of Southwest Industrial College (now Chongqing University), Sichuan University and Yunnan University.

The aviation departments of China&#x27;s higher education institutions developed relatively late and are weak in strength. Although Feng Ru built the first Chinese airplane in 1909, five years after the Wright brothers, China&#x27;s aviation industry failed to develop due to old thinking and turmoil. Until the September 18 incident and the January 28 Songo War of Resistance, which faced the painful lesson of national subjugation, the Chinese people gradually realized the importance of aviation technology, and the concept of &quot;air rescue of the nation&quot; was born. With this concept in mind, they traveled to Europe and America to learn aviation knowledge from the oceans, and after returning to China, by overcoming many problems and establishing aviation departments, they tried to cultivate Chinese aviation technology talents. The first major of aeronautical engineering in China was the Department of Aeronautical Engineering, which was established by Tsinghua University in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Faculty of Engineering in 1934.

But due to the outbreak of the Japanese War and other reasons in the mid-1940s, there was only Tsinghua University, Peiyang University, and a few universities such as Jiaotong University, Zhejiang University, and Xiamen University established aerospace engineering departments. With the country&#x27;s emphasis and need for the aviation industry after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and with the help of adjustment of colleges and universities across the country since 1951 under the leadership of the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, colleges and aviation departments across the country began to transfer to several colleges.

In March 1951, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made initial adjustments to the main aeronautical engineering departments and subjects of domestic universities: the aeronautical departments of Tsinghua University, Peiyang University, Northwestern Engineering Institute, and Xiamen University were merged to form a faculty. Aeronautical Engineering, Tsinghua University; Department of Aeronautical Engineering of Yunnan University This group was merged into the Department of Aeronautics of Sichuan University; The Aeronautics Department of the former Central Industrial College (then renamed Southwest Industrial College) and the Aeronautics Department of North China University merged to form the Aeronautics Department of Beijing Institute of Technology. On December 10 of the same year, Premier Zhou Enlai convened a meeting to discuss a plan to transition the aviation industry from maintenance to production. Vice Premier Li Fuchun suggested that &quot;building an aviation university is urgent.&quot; Premier Zhou Enlai agreed and gave the order. &quot;I will follow your suggestions.&quot;

In May 1952, in accordance with the directive of Premier Zhu Enlai to establish a specialized aviation university and the decision to establish an aviation faculty in the &quot;Resolution on the Construction of Aviation Industry&quot; issued by the Central Military Commission, the Central Ministry of Education formulated. A plan to adjust teaching groups in colleges and universities across the country, more adjustments were made in the aviation sector. On June 12, the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ministry of Education decided to officially prepare for the establishment of the Beijing Aviation Industry Institute with the approval of the State Finance and Economic Commission and the approval of the Central Military Commission.

On October 24, 1952, the Ministry of Education issued a certificate of approval for the establishment of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Industry (officially known as the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics or Beihang University for short).

<doc id="599912" wikidata="Q1954070" url="?curid=599912" title="Avalon (Roxy Music album)">
<text>Avalon is the eighth and final studio album by the English rock band Roxy Music, released on 28 May 1982 by E.G. Records, and Polydor. It was recorded between 1981 and 1982 at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, and is regarded as the culmination of the smoother, more adult-oriented sound of the band&#x27;s later work. It has been credited with pioneering the sophisti-pop genre.

The first single, &quot;More Than This&quot;, preceded the album and was a top 10 hit in Britain, Australia, and several European countries. &quot;Avalon&quot;, the second single, reached the top 20; &quot;Take a Chance with Me&quot; reached the top 30. In the United States, &quot;More Than This&quot; and &quot;Take a Chance with Me&quot; reached 103 and 104.

&quot;Avalon&quot; is Roxy Music&#x27;s most successful studio album. It stayed at number one on the UK Albums Chart for three weeks, and stayed on the chart for over a year. Although it reached only No. 53 in the US, &quot;Avalon&quot; endured as a sleeper hit and became Roxy Music&#x27;s lone million-selling US record, ultimately receiving platinum certification. While the band has toured periodically since the album&#x27;s release, it remains their most recent studio album to date.

==Background and production==
The Roxy Music singer, Bryan Ferry, started working on the material for &quot;Avalon&quot; while staying at Crumlin Lodge on the west coast of Ireland. Ferry was there with his girlfriend, Lucy Helmore, who would become his wife in 1983. The album cover artwork featured the same lough (lake) that can be seen from the lodge. 

The guitarist, Phil Manzanera, has said about the making of the record, &quot;By the time you get to &quot;Avalon&quot;, 90 per cent of it was being written in the studio. That album was a product of completely changing our working methods,&quot; adding &quot;for the last three albums, quite frankly, there were a lot more drugs around as well, which was good and bad. It created a lot of paranoia and a lot of spaced-out stuff.&quot; Ferry said: &quot;I&#x27;ve often thought I should do an album where the songs are all bound together in the style of &quot;West Side Story&quot;, but it&#x27;s always seemed like too much bother to work that way. So instead, I have these 10 poems, or short stories, that could, with a bit more work, be fashioned into a novel. Avalon is part of the King Arthur legend and is a very romantic thing, when King Arthur dies, the Queens ferry him off to Avalon, which is sort of an enchanted island. It&#x27;s the ultimate romantic fantasy place.&quot;

Manzanera said of the title track, &quot;Avalon&quot;, &quot;When we were recording the third or fourth album in London we&#x27;d often be working in the same studio as Bob Marley, who&#x27;d be downstairs doing all of those famous albums. It just had to rub off somewhere.&quot; Rhett Davies recounted the story of how the song got made: 

&quot;Ferry had stayed up that Saturday night and composed what would be the lyrics to &quot;Avalon.&quot; Then, happenstance would provide &quot;Avalon&quot; with one of its most memorable elements: the interpretive vocal contributions of Yanick Étienne. Sunday was usually a down day at the Power Station, so the studio would let local Haitian bands come in to do demos when there wasn&#x27;t much happening. It was then that Davies and Ferry, on a coffee break in the hallway, heard Etienne singing.

&quot;Bryan and I could hear this girl from the Haitian band next door singing, and we thought, &#x27;Wow! What a voice! We&#x27;ve got to get her singing some backing vocals on &quot;Avalon.&quot;&#x27; That was Yanick Étienne, who didn&#x27;t speak a word of English. She came in with her boyfriend/manager and we described to him what we wanted and she sort of sang the choruses and the [word] &#x27;Avalon&#x27; – the great sound that is on there. Then we said, &#x27;Can she try and do something free at the end?&#x27; and we ran the end of the track and she did absolutely nothing. So I said, &#x27;No, we want her to sing anything that she would want to sing, totally free.&#x27; So the second time we ran the tape, she sang exactly what you hear on the record at the end.

&quot;Bryan then went straight out and re-sang his vocal properly, because he was so inspired by Yanick&#x27;s singing. I remember Bryan&#x27;s manager walked in the room and Bryan was just finishing his vocal. We were doing the playback and I&#x27;d never seen the look on his eyes before. He went, &#x27;Jesus fucking Christ! That is incredible!&#x27; Well, we knew it was a really high point of the evening. I remember going, &#x27;Wow! We have really created something special here.&#x27; That is how I felt. Then we mixed it the next day with Bob [Clearmountain].

&quot;It was one of those turnaround things, where the original track was just about to be thrown in the can. And then suddenly, we did a completely different version of the song that just made the record for me,&quot; Davies concludes. &quot;I thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s it. That completes the record!&#x27; I remember we had dinner a couple nights later, and I asked Bryan, &#x27;What are you going to call the album?&#x27; and he said, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to call it Avalon,&#x27; and I thought, &#x27;Yeah. Of course.&#x27;&quot;

==Artwork==
The artwork was designed by Peter Saville. Although less visually obvious than it had been with past releases, &quot;Avalon&quot; continued the tradition for Roxy Music albums to feature images of women on the cover artwork. Bryan Ferry&#x27;s girlfriend (and soon to be wife) Lucy Helmore appeared on the album cover. 

The scene was captured by photographer Neil Kirk at dawn, looking out over Lough Ugga Beag, Connemara. A robed figure wearing a medieval helmet is pictured from behind facing a body of water. A hooded Merlin Falcon is perched on their gloved hand, evoking King Arthur&#x27;s last journey to the mysterious land of Avalon.

In November 1982, Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry told the &quot;LA Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Don Waller: “(Avalon) is the Isle of Enchantment, a fantasy place, a very romantic place… I thought this was the most romantic, dream-like album I’d ever done. I started working on the songs for &quot;Avalon&quot; on the west coast of Ireland, on the very lake that’s used in the photograph on the album cover&quot;.

==Critical reception==

In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1982 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll, &quot;Avalon&quot; was voted the 11th-best album of the year. In 1989, the album was ranked No. 31 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s&quot;. In 1993, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; included the CD as No. 25 in their 100 Greatest CDs A Love-It-Or-Loathe-It Guide to the Essential Disc Library. In 2000 it was voted number 187 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 307 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Avalon&quot; is the highest entry of four Roxy Music albums that made the list (&quot;Siren&quot; at No. 371, &quot;Country Life&quot; at No. 387 and &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot; at No. 394 being the others); &quot;Avalon&quot; and &quot;Country Life&quot; were dropped from the 2012 revision, but &quot;Avalon&quot; was re-included on the 2020 revision at No. 336. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; named the album the 45th best album of the 1980s.

The album has consistently been praised by critics. Reviewing the album in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Kurt Loder wrote: &quot;&quot;Avalon&quot; takes a long time to kick in, but it finally does, and it&#x27;s a good one. Bryan Ferry stars as a remarkably expressive keyboard player and singer whose familiar mannerisms are subsumed in a rich, benevolent self-assurance. And reed man Andy Mackay shines in a series of cameos (his oboe meditation on Ferry&#x27;s &quot;Tara&quot; is particularly lovely). Ten years after its debut, Roxy Music has mellowed: the occasional stark piano chords in &quot;While My Heart Is Still Beating,&quot; for example, recall the stately mood of &quot;A Song for Europe,&quot; but the sound is softer, dreamier and less determinedly dramatic now. Ferry&#x27;s songwriting, however, has seldom seemed stronger.&quot;

Mark Coleman in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; gave the record four-and-a-half stars out of five, and wrote; &quot;this austere, beautiful set of songs represents a mature peak. The controlled chaotic edge of the early albums is completely gone, and co-founders Manzanera and Mackay provide only skeletal guitar and sax lines. Ferry fills in the details, creating layered synth landscapes around his tragic scenarios and melodic ruminations. &quot;Avalon&quot;&#x27;s pervasive influence on the British pop scene of the &#x27;80s can&#x27;t be overstated. Roxy Music&#x27;s stature is even further enhanced by the absence of a latter-day comeback album. So far, anyway.&quot; &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; rated &quot;Avalon&quot; nine out of ten: &quot;1982&#x27;s &quot;Avalon&quot; remains one of the all-time great makeout infernos, a synthesized version of Al Green&#x27;s &quot;Call Me&quot;, Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Moondance&quot;, and João Gilberto&#x27;s &quot;Amoroso&quot;.&quot;

==2003 and 2024 surround-sound remixes==
In 2003, Virgin reissued &quot;Avalon&quot; on Hybrid Super Audio CD with a new 5.1-channel surround sound remix by the original production team of Rhett Davies (the producer) and Bob Clearmountain (the mixing engineer). The original 1982 stereo mix is left intact and is the same for the CD layer and for the HD layer, allegedly being transferred from analogue master tapes to DSD and processed in DSD throughout the process. The surround part of the HD layer includes the full album in the original running order plus the bonus track &quot;Always Unknowing&quot;, whose original stereo mix is only available on CD on the 4-CD boxed set &quot;The Thrill of It All&quot; and in the 2012 &quot;Roxy Music Complete Recordings&quot; boxed set.

Except for &quot;India&quot;, the short instrumental piece whose original multi-track tape had been lost, all tracks in the surround mix were remixed from multi-track sources, as opposed to two-channel stereo mixes being &#x27;upmixed&#x27; to 5.1 as in some DVD-Video releases. For &quot;India,&quot; the stereo mix is panned clockwise a few times as the track plays, which ends in the rear right channel, from which the saxophone begins the next piece, &quot;While My Heart Is Still Beating,&quot; making up for &quot;India&quot; not being a fully-fledged surround recording. 

The surround mix has roughly the same running times as the ten tracks present in the stereo mix. The main difference is in the stereo image being 360-degrees wide, as opposed to a front image plus rear ambiance, and the levels at which various tracks from the multi-track are mixed into the multi-channel mix. For instance, the guitar parts in &quot;The Main Thing&quot; and &quot;Take a Chance with Me&quot; are noticeably more prominent in the multi-channel mix than in the stereo mix. Guitar, saxophone, synthesizer, and percussion parts are often placed in the rear part of the sound field, while lead vocals tend to stick to the front centre, as opposed to being mixed in dual-mono in front left and right like in the somewhat traditional 2.0 stereo mixing.

In an interview with &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; regarding the surround-sound remix of &quot;Avalon&quot;, Clearmountain stated: &quot;This record probably means more to me than anything I&#x27;ve ever done. I&#x27;ve had more comments and compliments on this album by far than anything else I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;

In 2024, the album received another surround treatment when Bob Clearmountain remixed &quot;Avalon&quot; in Dolby Atmos immersive sound. In the accompanying press release, Bryan Ferry said, “Bob is the great master of the art of mixing, I was very moved when I heard his recent Dolby Atmos mix of Avalon – it sounds amazing.” This digital-only product was only available on Apple Music and Tidal. In November 2024, this version was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Immersive Audio Album, a nod the 2003 release had also received (without winining).

A physical release of the Dolby Atmos mix on a limited Blu-Ray Audio disc (which also includes the original 5.1 mix, however the bonus track &quot;Always Unknowing&quot; has not been included, according to the band&#x27;s wishes) was announced in February 2025, available to anyone who preorders until February 21. On this occasion, it was also explained that the multitracks of &quot;India&quot; had been found and used for the Atmos mix.

<text>Reading Capital () is a 1965 book about the philosopher Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot; by the philosophers Louis Althusser, Étienne Balibar, and Jacques Rancière, the sociologist Roger Establet, and the critic Pierre Macherey. The book was first published in France by François Maspero. An abridged English translation was published in 1970, and an unabridged translation in 2015. The book was influential among intellectuals.

==Summary==

The philosopher Louis Althusser and his co-authors — the philosopher Étienne Balibar, the sociologist Roger Establet, the philosopher Jacques Rancière, and the critic Pierre Macherey — discuss Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot; (1867–1883) and subjects such as the labor theory of value, dialectical materialism, and historical materialism. Rancière notes that his contribution builds on Althusser&#x27;s &quot;For Marx&quot; (1965).He explores the dynamics of capital accumulation, exploitation of workers, and the resulting class struggles. Marx critiques the capitalist mode of production, highlighting its inherent contradictions and tendency toward crises. He predicts that these contradictions will eventually lead to the overthrow of capitalism by the proletariat, paving the way for a classless, communist society. The work is foundational for Marxist theory and socialist movements.

==Publication history==
&quot;Reading Capital&quot; was first published in French by François Maspero in 1965. An abridged French François Maspero edition followed in 1968. An abridged Italian translation was also published. An abridged English translation by Ben Brewster was published in 1970 by New Left Books. An unabridged English translation by Ben Brewster and David Fernbach was published in 2015 by Verso Books.

==Reception==
Together with Althusser&#x27;s &quot;For Marx&quot; (1965), &quot;Reading Capital&quot; drew Althusser to the attention of French intellectuals and attracted a significant international readership. The appearance of &quot;Reading Capital&quot; and &quot;For Marx&quot; in English translation influenced the development of Marxist thought in the Anglophone world throughout the 1970s.

The Marxian economist Harry Cleaver wrote that Althusser and his co-authors provided one of the most politically influential of the philosophical reinterpretations of &quot;Das Kapital&quot; that were made by Marxists in the 1960s and 1970s. However, he considered their influence regrettable, writing that in &quot;For Marx&quot; and &quot;Reading Capital&quot;, Althusser&#x27;s aim was to revitalize dialectical materialism &quot;as an ideology to mediate the widely discredited political practices of the French Communist Party.&quot; He accused Althusser of ignoring working class struggles in favor of an abstract &quot;science of history&quot;, and noted that Althusser himself admitted that &quot;Reading Capital&quot; largely ignored the class struggle.

William S. Lewis described &quot;Reading Capital&quot; as the culmination of the rereading of Marx that Althusser began in 1953. He considered it a theoretically sophisticated text. However, he suggested that the difficulty of the work supported the charge that Althusser aspired to &quot;Leninist vanguardism&quot; and wanted &quot;a small, theoretically sophisticated cadre&quot; to &quot;direct the revolution&quot;, and expressed agreement with the historian Eric Hobsbawm&#x27;s view that the book showed that Althusser was an &quot;extremely selective reader of Marx.&quot;

The economist Alain Lipietz further pointed out that, while &quot;Reading Capital&quot; helped to disengage French Marxism from an oversimplification, determinism and mechanism inherited from the Stalinist period, it also obscured and censored the first chapter of &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, in which Marx analyzed the relationship of commodity and money.

<doc id="599917" wikidata="Q860959" url="?curid=599917" title="Mental image">
<text>In the philosophy of mind, neuroscience, and cognitive science, a mental image is an experience that, on most occasions, significantly resembles the experience of &quot;perceiving&quot; some object, event, or scene but occurs when the relevant object, event, or scene is not actually present to the senses. There are sometimes episodes, particularly on falling asleep (hypnagogic imagery) and waking up (hypnopompic imagery), when the mental imagery may be dynamic, phantasmagoric, and involuntary in character, repeatedly presenting identifiable objects or actions, spilling over from waking events, or defying perception, presenting a kaleidoscopic field, in which no distinct object can be discerned. Mental imagery can sometimes produce the same effects as would be produced by the behavior or experience imagined.

The nature of these experiences, what makes them possible, and their function (if any) have long been subjects of research and controversy in philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, and, more recently, neuroscience. As contemporary researchers use the expression, mental images or imagery can comprise information from any source of sensory input; one may experience auditory images, olfactory images, and so forth. However, the majority of philosophical and scientific investigations of the topic focus on &quot;visual&quot; mental imagery. It has sometimes been assumed that, like humans, some types of animals are capable of experiencing mental images. Due to the fundamentally introspective (reflective) nature of the phenomenon, it has been difficult to assess whether or not non-human animals experience mental imagery.

Philosophers such as George Berkeley and David Hume, and early experimental psychologists such as Wilhelm Wundt and William James, understood ideas in general to be mental images. Today, it is very widely believed that much imagery functions as mental representations (or mental models), playing an important role in memory and thinking. William Brant (2013, p. 12) traces the scientific use of the phrase &quot;mental images&quot; back to John Tyndall&#x27;s 1870 speech called the &quot;Scientific Use of the Imagination&quot;. Some have suggested that images are best understood to be, by definition, a form of inner, mental, or neural representation. Others reject the view that the image experience may be identical with (or directly caused by) any such representation in the mind or the brain, but do not take account of the non-representational forms of imagery.

==Mind&#x27;s eye==
The notion of a &quot;mind&#x27;s eye&quot; goes back at least to Cicero&#x27;s reference to mentis oculi during his discussion of the orator&#x27;s appropriate use of simile.

In this discussion, Cicero observed that allusions to &quot;the Syrtis of his patrimony&quot; and &quot;the Charybdis of his possessions&quot; involved similes that were &quot;too far-fetched&quot;; and he advised the orator to, instead, just speak of &quot;the rock&quot; and &quot;the gulf&quot; (respectively)—on the grounds that &quot;the eyes of the mind are more easily directed to those objects which we have seen, than to those which we have only heard&quot;.

The concept of &quot;the mind&#x27;s eye&quot; first appeared in English in Chaucer&#x27;s (c. 1387) Man of Law&#x27;s Tale in his &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, where he tells us that one of the three men dwelling in a castle was blind, and could only see with &quot;the eyes of his mind&quot;; namely, those eyes &quot;with which all men see after they have become blind&quot;. 

== Physical basis ==
The biological foundation of mental imagery is not fully understood. Studies using fMRI have shown that the lateral geniculate nucleus and the V1 area of the visual cortex are activated during mental imagery tasks. Ratey writes:
The visual pathway is not a one-way street. Higher areas of the brain can also send visual input back to neurons in lower areas of the visual cortex. [...] As humans, we have the ability to see with the mind&#x27;s eye—to have a perceptual experience in the absence of visual input. For example, PET scans have shown that when subjects, seated in a room, imagine they are at their front door starting to walk either to the left or right, activation begins in the visual association cortex, the parietal cortex, and the prefrontal cortex—all higher cognitive processing centers of the brain.

A biological basis for mental imagery is found in the deeper portions of the brain below the neocortex. In a large study with 285 participants, Tabi, Maio, Attaallah, et al. (2022) investigated the association between an established measure of visual mental imagery, Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ) scores, and volumes of brain structures including the hippocampus, amygdala, primary motor cortex, primary visual cortex and the fusiform gyrus. Tabi et al. (2022) found significant positive correlations between visual imagery vividness and the volumes of the hippocampus and primary visual cortex. 

Significant positive correlations were also obtained between VVIQ scores and hippocampal structures including Bilateral CA1, CA3, CA4 and Granule Cell (GC) and Molecular Layer (ML) of the Dentate Gyrus (DG). Follow-up analysis revealed that visual imagery was in particular correlated with the four subfields presented in the above illustration (Tabi et al., 2022).

The thalamus has been found to be discrete to other components in that it processes all forms of perceptional data relayed from both lower and higher components of the brain. Damage to this component can produce permanent perceptual damage, however when damage is inflicted upon the cerebral cortex, the brain adapts to neuroplasticity to amend any occlusions for perception . It can be thought that the neocortex is a sophisticated memory storage warehouse in which data received as an input from sensory systems are compartmentalized via the cerebral cortex. This would essentially allow for shapes to be identified, although given the lack of filtering input produced internally, one may as a consequence, hallucinate—essentially seeing something that isn&#x27;t received as an input externally but rather internal (i.e. an error in the filtering of segmented sensory data from the cerebral cortex may result in one seeing, feeling, hearing or experiencing something that is inconsistent with reality).

Not all people have the same mental imagery ability. For many, when the eyes are closed, the perception of darkness prevails. However, some people are able to perceive colorful, dynamic imagery (McKellar, 1957). The use of hallucinogenic drugs increases the subject&#x27;s ability to consciously access mental imagery including synaestesia (McKellar, 1957).

Furthermore, the pineal gland is a hypothetical candidate for producing a mind&#x27;s eye. Rick Strassman and others have postulated that during near-death experiences (NDEs) and dreaming, the gland might secrete the hallucinogenic chemical &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) to produce internal visuals when external sensory data is . However, this hypothesis has yet to be fully supported with neurochemical evidence and plausible mechanism for DMT production.

The condition where a person lacks mental imagery is called aphantasia. The term was first suggested in a 2015 study.

Common examples of mental images include daydreaming and the mental visualization that occurs while reading a book. Another is of the pictures summoned by athletes during training or before a competition, outlining each step they will take to accomplish their goal. When a musician hears a song, they can sometimes &quot;see&quot; the song notes in their head, as well as hear them with all their tonal qualities. This is considered different from an after-effect, such as an afterimage. Calling up an image in our minds can be a voluntary act, so it can be characterized as being under various degrees of conscious control.

There are several theories as to how mental images are formed in the mind. These include the dual-code theory, the propositional theory, and the functional-equivalency hypothesis. The dual-code theory, created by Allan Paivio in 1971, is the theory that we use two separate codes to represent information in our brains: image codes and verbal codes. Image codes are things like thinking of a picture of a dog when you are thinking of a dog, whereas a verbal code would be to think of the word &quot;dog&quot;. Another example is the difference between thinking of abstract words such as &quot;justice&quot; or &quot;love&quot; and thinking of concrete words like &quot;elephant&quot; or &quot;chair.&quot; When abstract words are thought of, it is easier to think of them in terms of verbal codes—finding words that define them or describe them. With concrete words, it is often easier to use image codes and bring up a picture of a &quot;human&quot; or &quot;chair&quot; in your mind rather than words associated or descriptive of them.

The propositional theory involves storing images in the form of a generic propositional code that stores the meaning of the concept not the image itself. The propositional codes can either be descriptive of the image or symbolic. They are then transferred back into verbal and visual code to form the mental image.

The functional-equivalency hypothesis is that mental images are &quot;internal representations&quot; that work in the same way as the actual perception of physical objects. In other words, the picture of a dog brought to mind when the word &quot;dog&quot; is read is interpreted in the same way as if the person was observing an actual dog before them.

Research has occurred to designate a specific neural correlate of imagery; however, studies show a multitude of results. Most studies published before 2001 suggest neural correlates of visual imagery occur in Brodmann area 17. Auditory performance imagery have been observed in the premotor areas, precunes, and medial Brodmann area 40. Auditory imagery in general occurs across participants in the temporal voice area (TVA), which allows top-down imaging manipulations, processing, and storage of audition functions. Olfactory imagery research shows activation in the anterior piriform cortex and the posterior piriform cortex; experts in olfactory imagery have larger gray matter associated to olfactory areas. Tactile imagery is found to occur in the dorsolateral prefrontal area, inferior frontal gyrus, frontal gyrus, insula, precentral gyrus, and the medial frontal gyrus with basal ganglia activation in the ventral posteriomedial nucleus and putamen (hemisphere activation corresponds to the location of the imagined tactile stimulus). Research in gustatory imagery reveals activation in the anterior insular cortex, frontal operculum, and prefrontal cortex. Novices of a specific form of mental imagery show less gray matter than experts of mental imagery congruent to that form. A meta-analysis of neuroimagery studies revealed significant activation of the bilateral dorsal parietal, interior insula, and left inferior frontal regions of the brain. Causal evidence from neurological patients with brain lesions demonstrates that vivid visual mental imagery is possible even when occipital visual areas are lesioned or disconnected from more anterior cortex. Visual mental imagery can instead be impaired by left temporal damage. Consistent with these findings, a meta-analysis of 27 neuroimaging studies demonstrated imagery-related activity in a region of the left ventral temporal cortex, which was dubbed the Fusiform Imagery Node. An additional Bayesian analysis excluded a role for occipital cortex in visual mental imagery, consistent with the evidence from neurological patients. 

Imagery has been thought to cooccur with perception; however, participants with damaged sense-modality receptors can sometimes perform imagery of said modality receptors. Neuroscience with imagery has been used to communicate with seemingly unconscious individuals through fMRI activation of different neural correlates of imagery, demanding further study into low quality consciousness. A study on one patient with one occipital lobe removed found the horizontal area of their visual mental image was reduced.

==Neural substrates of visual imagery==
Visual imagery is the ability to create mental representations of things, people, and places that are absent from an individual’s visual field. This ability is crucial to problem-solving tasks, memory, and spatial reasoning. Neuroscientists have found that imagery and perception share many of the same neural substrates, or areas of the brain that function similarly during both imagery and perception, such as the visual cortex and higher visual areas. Kosslyn and colleagues (1999) showed that the early visual cortex, Area 17 and Area 18/19, is activated during visual imagery. They found that inhibition of these areas through repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) resulted in impaired visual perception and imagery. Furthermore, research conducted with lesioned patients has revealed that visual imagery and visual perception have the same representational organization. This has been concluded from patients in which impaired perception also experience visual imagery deficits at the same level of the mental representation.

Behrmann and colleagues (1992) describe a patient C.K., who provided evidence challenging the view that visual imagery and visual perception rely on the same representational system. C.K. was a 33-year old man with visual object agnosia acquired after a vehicular accident. This deficit prevented him from being able to recognize objects and copy objects fluidly. Surprisingly, his ability to draw accurate objects from memory indicated his visual imagery was intact and normal. Furthermore, C.K. successfully performed other tasks requiring visual imagery for judgment of size, shape, color, and composition. These findings conflict with previous research as they suggest there is a partial dissociation between visual imagery and visual perception. C.K. exhibited a perceptual deficit that was not associated with a corresponding deficit in visual imagery, indicating that these two processes have systems for mental representations that may not be mediated entirely by the same neural substrates.

Schlegel and colleagues (2013) conducted a functional MRI analysis of regions activated during manipulation of visual imagery. They identified 11 bilateral cortical and subcortical regions that exhibited increased activation when manipulating a visual image compared to when the visual image was just maintained. These regions included the occipital lobe and ventral stream areas, two parietal lobe regions, the posterior parietal cortex and the precuneus lobule, and three frontal lobe regions, the frontal eye fields, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the prefrontal cortex. Due to their suspected involvement in working memory and attention, the authors propose that these parietal and prefrontal regions, and occipital regions, are part of a network involved in mediating the manipulation of visual imagery. These results suggest a top-down activation of visual areas in visual imagery.

Using Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to determine the connectivity of cortical networks, Ishai et al. (2010) demonstrated that activation of the network mediating visual imagery is initiated by prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex activity. Generation of objects from memory resulted in initial activation of the prefrontal and the posterior parietal areas, which then activate earlier visual areas through backward connectivity. Activation of the prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex has also been found to be involved in retrieval of object representations from long-term memory, their maintenance in working memory, and attention during visual imagery. Thus, Ishai et al. suggest that the network mediating visual imagery is composed of attentional mechanisms arising from the posterior parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex.

Vividness of visual imagery is a crucial component of an individual’s ability to perform cognitive tasks requiring imagery. Vividness of visual imagery varies not only between individuals but also within individuals. Dijkstra and colleagues (2017) found that the variation in vividness of visual imagery is dependent on the degree to which the neural substrates of visual imagery overlap with those of visual perception. They found that overlap between imagery and perception in the entire visual cortex, the parietal precuneus lobule, the right parietal cortex, and the medial frontal cortex predicted the vividness of a mental representation. The activated regions beyond the visual areas are believed to drive the imagery-specific processes rather than the visual processes shared with perception. It has been suggested that the precuneus contributes to vividness by selecting important details for imagery. The medial frontal cortex is suspected to be involved in the retrieval and integration of information from the parietal and visual areas during working memory and visual imagery. The right parietal cortex appears to be important in attention, visual inspection, and stabilization of mental representations. Thus, the neural substrates of visual imagery and perception overlap in areas beyond the visual cortex and the degree of this overlap in these areas correlates with the vividness of mental representations during imagery.

==Philosophical ideas==
Mental images are an important topic in classical and modern philosophy, as they are central to the study of knowledge. In the &quot;Republic&quot;, Book VII, Plato has Socrates present the Allegory of the Cave: a prisoner, bound and unable to move, sits with his back to a fire watching the shadows cast on the cave wall in front of him by people carrying objects behind his back. These people and the objects they carry are representations of real things in the world. Unenlightened man is like the prisoner, explains Socrates, a human being making mental images from the sense data that he experiences.

The eighteenth-century philosopher Bishop George Berkeley proposed similar ideas in his theory of idealism. Berkeley stated that reality is equivalent to mental images—our mental images are not a copy of another material reality but that reality itself. Berkeley, however, sharply distinguished between the images that he considered to constitute the external world, and the images of individual imagination. According to Berkeley, only the latter are considered &quot;mental imagery&quot; in the contemporary sense of the term.

The eighteenth century British writer Dr. Samuel Johnson criticized idealism. When asked what he thought about idealism, he is alleged to have replied &quot;I refute it thus!&quot; as he kicked a large rock and his leg rebounded. His point was that the idea that the rock is just another mental image and has no material existence of its own is a poor explanation of the painful sense data he had just experienced.

David Deutsch addresses Johnson&#x27;s objection to idealism in &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot; when he states that, if we judge the value of our mental images of the world by the quality and quantity of the sense data that they can explain, then the most valuable mental image—or theory—that we currently have is that the world has a real independent existence and that humans have successfully evolved by building up and adapting patterns of mental images to explain it. This is an important idea in scientific thought.

Critics of scientific realism ask how the inner perception of mental images actually occurs. This is sometimes called the &quot;homunculus problem&quot; (see also the mind&#x27;s eye). The problem is similar to asking how the images you see on a computer screen exist in the memory of the computer. To scientific materialism, mental images and the perception of them must be brain-states. According to critics, scientific realists cannot explain where the images and their perceiver exist in the brain. To use the analogy of the computer screen, these critics argue that cognitive science and psychology have been unsuccessful in identifying either the component in the brain (i.e., &quot;hardware&quot;) or the mental processes that store these images (i.e. &quot;software&quot;).

==In experimental psychology==

Cognitive psychologists and (later) cognitive neuroscientists have empirically tested some of the philosophical questions related to whether and how the human brain uses mental imagery in cognition.
One theory of the mind that was examined in these experiments was the &quot;brain as serial computer&quot; philosophical metaphor of the 1970s. Psychologist Zenon Pylyshyn theorized that the human mind processes mental images by decomposing them into an underlying mathematical proposition. Roger Shepard and Jacqueline Metzler challenged that view by presenting subjects with 2D line drawings of groups of 3D block &quot;objects&quot; and asking them to determine whether that &quot;object&quot; is the same as a second figure, some of which rotations of the first &quot;object&quot;. Shepard and Metzler proposed that if we decomposed and then mentally re-imaged the objects into basic mathematical propositions, as the then-dominant view of cognition &quot;as a serial digital computer&quot; assumed, then it would be expected that the time it took to determine whether the object is the same or not would be independent of how much the object had been rotated. Shepard and Metzler found the opposite: a linear relationship between the degree of rotation in the mental imagery task and the time it took participants to reach their answer.

This mental rotation finding implied that the human mind—and the human brain—maintains and manipulates mental images as topographic and topological wholes, an implication that was quickly put to test by psychologists. Stephen Kosslyn and colleagues showed in a series of neuroimaging experiments that the mental image of objects like the letter &quot;F&quot; are mapped, maintained and rotated as an image-like whole in areas of the human visual cortex. Moreover, Kosslyn&#x27;s work showed that there are considerable similarities between the neural mappings for imagined stimuli and perceived stimuli. The authors of these studies concluded that, while the neural processes they studied rely on mathematical and computational underpinnings, the brain also seems optimized to handle the sort of mathematics that constantly computes a series of topologically-based images rather than calculating a mathematical model of an object.

Recent studies in neurology and neuropsychology on mental imagery have further questioned the &quot;mind as serial computer&quot; theory, arguing instead that human mental imagery manifests both visually and kinesthetically. For example, several studies have provided evidence that people are slower at rotating line drawings of objects such as hands in directions incompatible with the joints of the human body, and that patients with painful, injured arms are slower at mentally rotating line drawings of the hand from the side of the injured arm.

Some psychologists, including Kosslyn, have argued that such results occur because of interference in the brain between distinct systems in the brain that process the visual and motor mental imagery. Subsequent neuroimaging studies showed that the interference between the motor and visual imagery system could be induced by having participants physically handle actual 3D blocks glued together to form objects similar to those depicted in the line-drawings. Amorim et al. have shown that, when a cylindrical &quot;head&quot; was added to Shepard and Metzler&#x27;s line drawings of 3D block figures, participants were quicker and more accurate at solving mental rotation problems. They argue that motoric embodiment is not just &quot;interference&quot; that inhibits visual mental imagery but is capable of facilitating mental imagery.

As cognitive neuroscience approaches to mental imagery continued, research expanded beyond questions of serial versus parallel or topographic processing to questions of the relationship between mental images and perceptual representations. Both brain imaging (fMRI and ERP) and studies of neuropsychological patients have been used to test the hypothesis that a mental image is the reactivation, from memory, of brain representations normally activated during the perception of an external stimulus. In other words, if perceiving an apple activates contour and location and shape and color representations in the brain’s visual system, then imagining an apple activates some or all of these same representations using information stored in memory. Early evidence for this idea came from neuropsychology. Patients with brain damage that impairs perception in specific ways, for example by damaging shape or color representations, seem to generally to have impaired mental imagery in similar ways. Studies of brain function in normal human brains support this same conclusion, showing activity in the brain’s visual areas while subjects imagined visual objects and scenes.

The previously mentioned and numerous related studies have led to a relative consensus within cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy on the neural status of mental images. In general, researchers agree that, while there is no homunculus inside the head viewing these mental images, our brains do form and maintain mental images as image-like wholes. The problem of exactly how these images are stored and manipulated within the human brain, in particular within language and communication, remains a fertile area of study.

One of the longest-running research topics on the mental image has basis on the fact that people report large individual differences in the vividness of their images. Special questionnaires have been developed to assess such differences, including the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ) developed by David Marks. Laboratory studies have suggested that the subjectively reported variations in imagery vividness are associated with different neural states within the brain and also different cognitive competences such as the ability to accurately recall information presented in pictures Rodway, Gillies and Schepman used a novel long-term change detection task to determine whether participants with low and high vividness scores on the VVIQ2 showed any performance differences. Rodway et al. found that high vividness participants were significantly more accurate at detecting salient changes to pictures compared to low-vividness participants. This replicated an earlier study.

Recent studies have found that individual differences in VVIQ scores can be used to predict changes in a person&#x27;s brain while visualizing different activities. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to study the association between early visual cortex activity relative to the whole brain while participants visualized themselves or another person bench pressing or stair climbing. Reported image vividness correlates significantly with the relative fMRI signal in the visual cortex. Thus, individual differences in the vividness of visual imagery can be measured objectively.

Logie, Pernet, Buonocore and Della Sala (2011) used behavioural and fMRI data for mental rotation from individuals reporting vivid and poor imagery on the VVIQ. Groups differed in brain activation patterns suggesting that the groups performed the same tasks in different ways. These findings help to explain the lack of association previously reported between VVIQ scores and mental rotation performance.

Beyond visual imagery is the Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire which measures seven senses. This form of imagery assessment correlates with the VVIQ for visual imagery and shows how other senses vary dependent on individual differences.

==Training and learning styles==

Some educational theorists have drawn from the idea of mental imagery in their studies of learning styles. Proponents of these theories state that people often have learning processes that emphasize visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems of experience. According to these theorists, teaching in multiple overlapping sensory systems benefits learning, and they encourage teachers to use content and media that integrates well with the visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems whenever possible.

Educational researchers have examined whether the experience of mental imagery affects the degree of learning. For example, imagining playing a five-finger piano exercise (mental practice) resulted in a significant improvement in performance over no mental practice—though not as significant as that produced by physical practice. The authors of the study stated that &quot;mental practice alone seems to be sufficient to promote the modulation of neural circuits involved in the early stages of motor skill learning&quot;.

Imagery training has been effective in a series of studies, mostly in sport where participants are taught formal skills to improve a mental image. Imagery training has also been effective with individuals with low abilities. 

==Visualization and religion==

Mental visualization is used across world religions, particularly as an aid for prayer or meditation.

===Christianity===
===Tibetan traditions===
In general, Vajrayana Buddhism and Bön utilize sophisticated visualization or &quot;imaginal&quot; (in the language of Jean Houston of Transpersonal Psychology) processes in the Tulpa construction of the yidam sadhana, kye-rim, and dzog-rim modes of meditation and in the yantra, thangka, and mandala traditions, where holding the fully realized form in the mind is a prerequisite prior to creating an &#x27;authentic&#x27; new art work that will provide a sacred support or foundation for deity.

== Substitution effects ==
Mental imagery can act as a substitute for the imagined experience: Imagining an experience can evoke similar cognitive, physiological, and behavioral consequences as having the corresponding experience in reality. At least four classes of such effects have been documented.
# Imagined experiences are attributed evidentiary value like physical evidence. 
# Mental practice can instantiate the same performance benefits as physical practice and reduction central neuropathic pain. 
# Imagined consumption of a food can reduce its actual consumption. 
# Imagined goal achievement can reduce motivation for actual goal achievement.

<text>Las Américas International Airport (, or AILA) is an international airport located in Punta Caucedo, near Santo Domingo and Boca Chica in the Dominican Republic. The airport is run by Aeropuertos Dominicanos Siglo XXI (AERODOM), a private corporation based in the Dominican Republic, under a 25-year concession to build, operate, and transfer (BOT) six of the country&#x27;s airports. Las Américas usually receives a wide variety of long-, mid-, and short-haul aircraft. Santo Domingo&#x27;s other airport, La Isabela, is much smaller and used by smaller aircraft only.

The airport is the second-busiest in the country, after Punta Cana International Airport, and one of the largest in the Caribbean, handling 5.490 million passengers in 2023. It is also the busiest cargo hub in the Caribbean and Central America, with 355,000,000 lbs of cargo transported in 2019.

== History ==
Las Américas Airport opened in 1959 as the official airport of Ciudad Trujillo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, with the city subsequently changing its name to Santo Domingo. The official name of the airport was changed in 2002 to &quot;Aeropuerto Internacional Las Américas- José Francisco Peña Gómez (AIJFPG)&quot; but is known as &quot;Las Américas International Airport&quot;, or locally, &quot;Las Américas Airport, AILA or &quot;El Aeropuerto&quot;.

In April 1953, Chicago and Southern Air Lines, a U.S. based air carrier, was operating a weekly Lockheed Constellation service into Ciudad Trujillo with a southbound routing of Memphis - New Orleans - Port-au-Prince - Ciudad Trujillo - San Juan, PR and a northbound routing of San Juan - Ciudad Trujillo - Port-au-Prince - New Orleans - Memphis - St. Louis - Chicago. By 1954, U.S. based Delta Air Lines (which was known as &quot;Delta C&amp;S&quot; at the time following its acquisition and merger with Chicago and Southern Air Lines in May 1953) was serving the Dominican Republic on a daily basis via the then-named General Andrews Airport in Ciudad Trujillo with nonstop flights to San Juan, Puerto Rico and Port au Prince, Haiti operated with Convair 340 twin prop aircraft. The eastbound Delta flights operated a daily routing of Houston - New Orleans - Havana, Cuba - Port-au-Prince - Ciudad Trujillo - San Juan and the westbound Delta flights operated a daily routing of San Juan - Ciudad Trujillo - Port-au-Prince - Havana - New Orleans. Also during the mid-1950s, U.S. based Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was serving Ciudad Trujillo with nonstop flights to New York City, Miami and Port-au-Prince operated with Douglas DC-6 four engine propliners (which the airline called the &quot;Super-6 Clipper&quot;). In 1960, locally based Dominicana de Aviacion, the former flag carrier of the Dominican Republic, was operating scheduled international passenger service nonstop between the airport and Miami with Douglas DC-4 four engine propliners and also nonstop between the airport and San Juan, Puerto Rico with Douglas DC-3 and Curtiss C-46 twin prop aircraft.

By the early and mid-1960s, several airlines were operating international jet service from the airport including Pan Am with Boeing 707 service nonstop to New York City, Miami, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Kingston, Jamaica and Curaçao as well as direct, no change of plane 707 service to Montego Bay, Caracas, Port of Spain, Georgetown, Guyana and Paramaribo while Brazil-based VARIG was operating Sud Aviation Caravelle and Convair 990 jetliner flights nonstop to New York City and Miami as well as direct, no change of plane jet service to Port of Spain, Belém, Fortaleza, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Porto Alegre.

By 1976, the airport was being served by American Airlines with nonstop Boeing 707 and Boeing 747 flights from New York City, Dominicana de Aviacion with nonstop Boeing 727-100, Boeing 727-200, Boeing 707-399C, Boeing 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 (leased aircraft) service from New York City, Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico, Eastern Airlines with nonstop Boeing 727-100 service from San Juan, Puerto Rico as well as direct, no change of plane 727 flights from Cleveland and Miami, Pan Am with nonstop Boeing 707 service from Port au Prince as well as direct, one stop 707 service from Miami, ALM Antillean Airlines with nonstop and direct one stop McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 service from Curaçao, Viasa with nonstop Douglas DC-8 service from Curaçao and direct one stop DC-8 flights from Caracas, and locally based Aerovias Quisqueyana with nonstop Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 service from Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Also in 1976, Aerovias Quisqueyana was operating nonstop Boeing 707 transatlantic service from the airport to Madrid with this flight also providing direct one stop service to Rome.

According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), in 1996 a number of European-based airlines were operating transatlantic flights from the airport including Air France with nonstop Boeing 747 service to Paris, Alitalia with nonstop Boeing 767-300 service to Rome, Condor Airlines with nonstop Boeing 767-300 service to both Cologne/Bonn and Frankfurt, Iberia Airlines with nonstop McDonnell Douglas DC-10 service to Madrid, LTU International Airways with nonstop McDonnell Douglas MD-11 service to Dusseldorf, Martinair with nonstop Boeing 767-300 service to Amsterdam, and TAP Air Portugal with direct one stop Airbus A310 service to Lisbon. Airline service from the airport to South America in 1996 included nonstop Boeing 727-200 flights to Bogota operated by ACES Colombia as well as nonstop McDonnell Douglas DC-10 flights to Lima operated by Iberia Airlines in addition to direct, no change of plane Boeing 737-200 flights also to Lima operated by Copa Airlines via a stop at this air carrier&#x27;s hub in Panama City, Panama.
Also according to the OAG, other airlines operating flights into the airport in 1996 included American Airlines with nonstop Airbus A300-600R, McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11 service from New York City as well as nonstop Airbus A300-600R and Boeing 727-200 service from Miami in addition to direct one stop Airbus A300-600R service from both Boston and Orlando, Continental Airlines with nonstop Boeing 727-200 service from Newark, Trans World Airlines (TWA) with nonstop Boeing 767-200 and Lockheed L-1011 service from New York City, and locally based APA International Air with nonstop Airbus A300 service from both New York City and Miami.

Las Américas was the hub for Dominicana de Aviación, APA International Air, PAWA Dominicana, and a number of other, smaller airlines. Currently Sky High Dominicana and Arajet are based there.

Las Américas also has served as a hub for airlines such as Aeromar Líneas Aéreas Dominicanas, Aero Continente Dominicana and Queen Air.

Recently, the expressway leading from Santo Domingo to the airport (roughly 20 km east of the city center) was expanded and modernised. The airport was also modernised, and two more terminals were added, including 20 more gates. The new expressway crosses a new suspension bridge which spans the Ozama River, connecting traffic into the city&#x27;s Elevated Freeway and Tunnel system onto the city&#x27;s main street, Av. 27 de Febrero. A more scenic route following the coastal shore provides beautiful views of the Caribbean Sea and of the city. This secondary road crosses the Ozama River by means of a floating bridge, connecting traffic onto the Av. George Washington (el Malecón) which leads into the heart of the colonial city.

On 18 April 2007, a new terminal was completed and opened for operations. It can accommodate four Boeing 747s simultaneously. This new terminal has four gates with boarding bridges, an air-conditioning system, and maintenance facilities for aircraft.

==Facilities==

===Terminals===
Las Américas has five gates on the main satellite concourse (A), A2 through A6. Other gate facilities are for the flights departing from a parking in the taxiway. back in the 1960s and 70s the airport used to be much smaller, The original building was half the size of today&#x27;s newest structure but with a still modern look. Concourse B has four gates (B1 through B4) and remote stand (P8). Terminal B now features a co-branded Copa Club operated jointly by United Airlines and Copa Airlines, and a Private Lounge exclusive to members and business people. The average number of daily flights in and out of Las Américas ranges between 68 and 84. JetBlue is the largest airline operating at Las Américas.

===Runway===
Las Américas Airport&#x27;s runway direction is north–south (designated 17–35). This runway is the largest in the country, and one of the largest in the Caribbean. With a length of 3,355 m, it is able to support a Boeing 747. The runway of SDQ was last renovated in June 2008. The old taxi-way was also renovated and converted into a full runway while the old runway was being renovated, then it was converted back into a taxiway after the normal runway was finished. The runway accommodated the Antonov An-225 to supply goods after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.
