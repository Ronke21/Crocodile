<text>In military tactics, close air support (CAS) is defined as aerial warfare actions—often air-to-ground actions such as strafes or airstrikes—by military aircraft against hostile targets in close proximity to friendly forces. A form of fire support, CAS requires detailed integration of each air mission with fire and movement of all forces involved. CAS may be conducted using aerial bombs, glide bombs, missiles, rockets, autocannons, machine guns, and even directed-energy weapons such as lasers.

The requirement for detailed integration because of proximity, fires or movement is the determining factor. CAS may need to be conducted during shaping operations with special forces if the mission requires detailed integration with the fire and movement of those forces. A closely related subset of air interdiction, battlefield air interdiction, denotes interdiction against units with near-term effects on friendly units, but which does not require integration with friendly troop movements. CAS requires excellent coordination with ground forces, typically handled by specialists such as artillery observers, joint terminal attack controllers, and forward air controllers.

World War I was the first conflict to make extensive use of CAS, albeit using relatively primitive methods in contrast to later warfare, though it was made evident that proper coordination between aerial and ground forces via radio made attacks more effective. Several conflicts during the interwar period—including the Polish–Soviet War, the Spanish Civil War, the Iraqi Revolt, and the Chaco War—made notable use of CAS. World War II marked the universal acceptance of the integration of air power into combined arms warfare, with all of the war&#x27;s major combatants having developed effective air-ground coordination techniques by the conflict&#x27;s end. New techniques, such as the use of forward air control to guide CAS aircraft and identifying invasion stripes, also emerged at this time, being heavily shaped by the Italian Campaign and the invasion of Normandy. CAS continued to advance during the conflicts of the Cold War, especially the Korean War and the Vietnam War; major milestones included the introduction of attack helicopters, gunships, and dedicated CAS attack jets.

==History==

===World War I===

The use of aircraft in the close air support of ground forces dates back to World War I, the first conflict to make significant military use of aerial forces. Air warfare, and indeed aviation itself, was still in its infancy – and the direct effect of rifle caliber machine guns and light bombs of World War I aircraft was very limited compared with the power of (for instance) an average fighter bomber of World War II, but CAS aircraft were still able to achieve a powerful psychological impact. The aircraft was a visible and personal enemy – unlike artillery – presenting a personal threat to enemy troops, while providing friendly forces assurance that their superiors were concerned about their situation.

The most successful attacks of 1917–1918 had included planning for co-ordination between aerial and ground units, although it was relatively difficult at this early date to co-ordinate these attacks due to the primitive nature of air-to-ground radio communication. Though most air-power proponents sought independence from ground commanders and hence pushed the importance of interdiction and strategic bombing, they nonetheless recognized the need for close air support.

From the commencement of hostilities in 1914, aviators engaged in sporadic and spontaneous attacks on ground forces, but it was not until 1916 that an air support doctrine was elaborated and dedicated fighters for the job were put into service. By that point, the startling and demoralizing effect that attack from the air could have on the troops in the trenches had been made clear.

At the Battle of the Somme, 18 British armed reconnaissance planes strafed the enemy trenches after conducting surveillance operations. The success of this improvised assault spurred innovation on both sides. In 1917, following the Second Battle of the Aisne, the British debuted the first ground-attack aircraft, a modified F.E 2b fighter carrying bombs and mounted machine-guns. After exhausting their ammunition, the planes returned to base for refueling and rearming before returning to the battle-zone. Other modified planes used in this role were the Airco DH.5 and Sopwith Camel – the latter was particularly successful in this role.

Aircraft support was first integrated into a battle plan on a large scale at the 1917 Battle of Cambrai, where a significantly larger number of tanks were deployed than previously. By that time, effective anti-aircraft tactics were being used by the enemy infantry and pilot casualties were high, although air support was later judged as having been of a critical importance in places where the infantry had got pinned down.

At this time, British doctrine came to recognize two forms of air support; trench strafing (the modern-day doctrine of CAS), and ground strafing (the modern-day doctrine of air interdiction) – attacking tactical ground targets away from the land battle. As well as strafing with machine-guns, planes engaged in such operations were commonly modified with bomb racks; the plane would fly in very low to the ground and release the bombs just above the trenches.
The Germans were also quick to adopt this new form of warfare and were able to deploy aircraft in a similar capacity at Cambrai. While the British used single-seater planes, the Germans preferred the use of heavier two-seaters with an additional machine gunner in the aft cockpit. The Germans adopted the powerful Hannover CL.II and built the first purpose-built ground attack aircraft, the Junkers J.I. During the 1918 German spring offensive, the Germans employed 30 squadrons, or &quot;Schlasta&quot;, of ground attack fighters and were able to achieve some initial tactical success. The British later deployed the Sopwith Salamander as a specialized ground attack aircraft, although it was too late to see much action.

During the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of 1918, CAS aircraft functioned as an important factor in ultimate victory. After the British achieved air superiority over the German aircraft sent to aid the Ottoman Turks, squadrons of S.E 5a&#x27;s and D.H. 4s were sent on wide-ranging attacks against German and Turkish positions near the Jordan river. Combined with a ground assault led by General Edmund Allenby, three Turkish armies soon collapsed into a full rout. In the words of the attacking squadron&#x27;s official report:

===Inter-war period===
The close air support doctrine was further developed in the interwar period. Most theorists advocated the adaptation of fighters or light bombers into the role. During this period, airpower advocates crystallized their views on the role of air-power in warfare. Aviators and ground officers developed largely opposing views on the importance of CAS, views that would frame institutional battles for CAS in the 20th century.

The inter-war period saw the use of CAS in a number of conflicts, including the Polish–Soviet War, the Spanish Civil War, the Iraqi revolt of 1920 and the Gran Chaco War.

The British used air power to great effect in various colonial hotspots in the Middle East and North Africa during the immediate postwar period. The newly formed Royal Air force (RAF) contributed to the defeat of the Afghan military during the Third Anglo-Afghan War by harassing Afghani troops and breaking up their formations. Z Force, an RAF air squadron, was also used to support ground operations during the Somaliland campaign, in which the Darawiish king Diiriye Guure&#x27;s insurgency was defeated. Following from these successes, the decision was made to create a unified RAF Iraq Command to use air power as a more cost-effective way of controlling large areas than the use of conventional land forces. It was effectively used to suppress the Great Iraqi Revolution of 1920 and various other tribal revolts.

During the Spanish Civil War German volunteer aviators of the Condor Legion on the Nationalist side, despite little official support from their government, developed close air support tactics that proved highly influential for subsequent Luftwaffe doctrine.

U.S. Marine Corps Aviation was used as an intervention force in support of U.S. Marine Corps ground forces during the Banana Wars, in places such as Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. Marine Aviators experimented with air-ground tactics and in Haiti and Nicaragua they adopted the tactic of dive bombing.

The observers and participants of these wars would base their CAS strategies on their experience of the conflict. Aviators, who wanted institutional independence from the Army, pushed for a view of air-power centered around interdiction, which would relieve them of the necessity of integrating with ground forces and allow them to operate as an independent military arm. They saw close air support as both the most difficult and most inefficient use of aerial assets.

Close air support was the most difficult mission, requiring identifying and distinguishing between friendly and hostile units. At the same time, targets engaged in combat are dispersed and concealed, reducing the effectiveness of air attacks. They also argued that the CAS mission merely duplicated the abilities of artillery, whereas interdiction provided a unique capability. Ground officers contended there was rarely sufficient artillery available, and the flexibility of aircraft would be ideal for massing firepower at critical points, while producing a greater psychological effect on friendly and hostile forces alike. Moreover, unlike massive, indiscriminate artillery strikes, small aerial bombs would not render ground untrafficable, slowing attacking friendly forces.

Although the prevailing view in official circles was largely indifferent to CAS during the interwar period, its importance was expounded upon by military theorists, such as J. F. C. Fuller and Basil Liddell Hart. Hart, who was an advocate of what later came to be known as &#x27;Blitzkrieg&#x27; tactics, thought that the speed of armoured tanks would render conventional artillery incapable of providing support fire. Instead he proposed that:

===World War II===
====&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;====

As a continental power intent on offensive operations, Germany could not ignore the need for aerial support of ground operations. Though the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, like its counterparts, tended to focus on strategic bombing, it was unique in its willingness to commit forces to CAS. Unlike the Allies, the Germans were not able to develop powerful strategic bombing capabilities, which implied industrial developments they were forbidden to take according to the Treaty of Versailles. In joint exercises with Sweden in 1934, the Germans were first exposed to dive-bombing, which permitted greater accuracy while making attack aircraft more difficult to track by antiaircraft gunners. As a result, Ernst Udet, chief of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s development, initiated procurement of close support dive bombers on the model of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Curtiss Helldiver, resulting in the Henschel Hs 123, which was later replaced by the famous Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot;. Experience in the Spanish Civil War lead to the creation of five ground-attack groups in 1938, four of which would be equipped with &quot;Stukas&quot;. The Luftwaffe matched its material acquisitions with advances in the air-ground coordination. General Wolfram von Richthofen organized a limited number of air liaison detachments that were attached to ground units of the main effort. These detachments existed to pass requests from the ground to the air, and receive reconnaissance reports, but they were not trained to guide aircraft onto targets.

These preparations did not prove fruitful in the invasion of Poland, where the Luftwaffe focused on interdiction and dedicated few assets to close air support. But the value of CAS was demonstrated at the crossing of the Meuse River during the Invasion of France in 1940. General Heinz Guderian, one of the creators of the combined-arms tactical doctrine commonly known as &quot;blitzkrieg&quot;, believed the best way to provide cover for the crossing would be a continuous stream of ground attack aircraft on French defenders. Though few guns were hit, the attacks kept the French under cover and prevented them from manning their guns. Aided by the sirens attached to &quot;Stukas&quot;, the psychological impact was disproportional to the destructive power of close air support (although as often as not, the Stukas were used as tactical bombers instead of close air support, leaving much of the actual work to the older Hs 123 units for the first years of the war). In addition, the reliance on air support over artillery reduced the demand for logistical support through the Ardennes. Though there were difficulties in coordinating air support with the rapid advance, the Germans demonstrated consistently superior CAS tactics to those of the British and French defenders. Later, on the Eastern front, the Germans would devise visual ground signals to mark friendly units and to indicate direction and distance to enemy emplacements.

Despite these accomplishments, German CAS was not perfect and suffered from the same misunderstanding and interservice rivalry that plagued other nations&#x27; air arms, and friendly fire was not uncommon. For example, on the eve of the Meuse offensive, Guderian&#x27;s superior cancelled his CAS plans and called for high-altitude strikes from medium bombers, which would have required halting the offensive until the air strikes were complete. Fortunately for the Germans, his order was issued too late to be implemented, and the Luftwaffe commander followed the schedule he had previously worked out with Guderian. As late as November 1941, the Luftwaffe refused to provide Erwin Rommel with an air liaison officer for the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot;, because it &quot;would be against the best use of the air force as a whole.&quot;

German CAS was also extensively used on the Eastern Front during the period 1941–1943. Their decline was caused by the growing strength of the Red Air Force and the redeployment of assets to defend against American and British strategic bombardment. Luftwaffe&#x27;s loss of air superiority, combined with a declining supply of aircraft and fuel, crippled their ability to provide effective CAS on the western front after 1943.

====RAF and USAAF====

The Royal Air Force (RAF) entered the war woefully unprepared to provide CAS. In 1940 during the Battle of France, the Royal Air Force and Army headquarters in France were located at separate positions, resulting in unreliable communications. After the RAF was withdrawn in May, Army officers had to telephone the War Office in London to arrange for air support. The stunning effectiveness of German air-ground coordination spurred change. On the basis of tests in Northern Ireland in August 1940, Group Captain A. H. Wann RAF and Colonel J.D. Woodall (British Army) issued the Wann-Woodall Report, recommending the creation of a distinct tactical air force liaison officer (known colloquially as &quot;tentacles&quot;) to accompany Army divisions and brigades. Their report spurred the RAF to create an RAF Army Cooperation Command and to develop tentacle equipment and procedures placing an Air Liaison Officer with each brigade.

Although the RAF was working on its CAS doctrine in London, officers in North Africa improvised their own coordination techniques. In October 1941, Sir Arthur Tedder and Arthur Coningham, senior RAF commanders in North Africa, created joint RAF-Army Air Support Control staffs at each corps and armored division headquarters, and placed a Forward Air Support Link at each brigade to forward air support requests. When trained tentacle teams arrived in 1942, they cut response time on support requests to thirty minutes. It was also in the North Africa desert that the cab rank strategy was developed. It used a series of three aircraft, each in turn directed by the pertinent ground control by radio. One aircraft would be attacking, another in flight to the battle area, while a third was being refuelled and rearmed at its base. If the first attack failed to destroy the tactical target, the aircraft in flight would be directed to continue the attack. The first aircraft would land for its own refuelling and rearming once the third had taken off. The CAS tactics developed and refined by the British during the campaign in North Africa served as the basis for the Allied system used to subsequently gain victory in the air over Germany in 1944 and devastate its cities and industries.

The use of forward air control to guide close air support (CAS) aircraft, so as to ensure that their attack hits the intended target and not friendly troops, was first used by the British Desert Air Force in North Africa, but not by the USAAF until operations in Salerno. During the North African Campaign in 1941 the British Army and the Royal Air Force established Forward Air Support Links (FASL), a mobile air support system using ground vehicles. Light reconnaissance aircraft would observe enemy activity and report it by radio to the FASL which was attached at brigade level. The FASL was in communication (a two-way radio link known as a &quot;tentacle&quot;) with the Air Support Control (ASC) Headquarters attached to the corps or armoured division which could summon support through a Rear Air Support Link with the airfields. They also introduced the system of ground direction of air strikes by what was originally termed a &quot;Mobile Fighter Controller&quot; traveling with the forward troops. The controller rode in the &quot;leading tank or armoured car&quot; and directed a &quot;cab rank&quot; of aircraft above the battlefield. This system of close co-operation first used by the Desert Air Force, was steadily refined and perfected, during the campaigns in Italy, Normandy and Germany.
By the time the Italian Campaign had reached Rome, the Allies had established air superiority. They were then able to pre-schedule strikes by fighter-bomber squadrons; however, by the time the aircraft arrived in the strike area, oftentimes the targets, which were usually trucks, had fled. The initial solution to fleeing targets was the British &quot;Rover&quot; system. These were pairings of air controllers and army liaison officers at the front but able to switch communications seamlessly from one brigade to another – hence Rover. Incoming strike aircraft arrived with pre-briefed targets, which they would strike 20 minutes after arriving on station only if the Rovers had not directed them to another more pressing target. Rovers might call on artillery to mark targets with smoke shells, or they might direct the fighters to map grid coordinates, or they might resort to a description of prominent terrain features as guidance. However, one drawback for the Rovers was the constant rotation of pilots, who were there for fortnightly stints, leading to a lack of institutional memory. US commanders, impressed by the British tactics at the Salerno landings, adapted their own doctrine to include many features of the British system.

At the start of the War, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) had, as its principal mission, the doctrine of strategic bombing. This incorporated the unerring belief that unescorted bombers could win the war without the advent of ground troops. This doctrine proved to be fundamentally flawed. However, during the entire course of the war the USAAF top brass clung to this doctrine, and hence operated independently of the rest of the Army. Thus it was initially unprepared to provide CAS, and in fact, had to be dragged &quot;kicking and screaming&quot; into the CAS function with the ground troops. USAAF doctrinal priorities for tactical aviation were, in order, air superiority, isolation of the battlefield via supply interdiction, and thirdly, close air support. Hence, during the North African Campaign, CAS was poorly executed, if at all. So few aerial assets were assigned to U.S. troops that they fired on anything in the air. And in 1943, the USAAF changed their radios to a frequency incompatible with ground radios.

The situation improved during the Italian Campaign, where American and British forces, working in close cooperation, exchanged CAS techniques and ideas. There, the AAF&#x27;s XII Air Support Command and the Fifth U.S. Army shared headquarters, meeting every evening to plan strikes and devising a network of liaisons and radios for communications. However, friendly fire continued to be a concern – pilots did not know recognition signals and regularly bombed friendly units, until an A-36 was shot down in self-defense by Allied tanks. The expectation of losses to friendly fire from the ground during the planned invasion of France prompted the black and white invasion stripes painted on all Allied aircraft from 1944.

In 1944, USAAF commander Lt. Gen. Henry (&quot;Hap&quot;) Arnold acquired 2 groups of A-24 dive bombers, the army version of the Navy&#x27;s SBD-2, in response to the success of the &quot;Stuka&quot; and German CAS. Later, the USAAF developed a modification of the North American P-51 Mustang with dive brakes – the North American A-36 Apache. However, there was no training to match the purchases. Though Gen. Lesley McNair, commander of Army Ground Forces, pushed to change USAAF priorities, the latter failed to provide aircraft for even major training exercises. Six months before the invasion of Normandy, 33 divisions had received no joint air-ground training.

The USAAF saw the greatest innovations in 1944 under General Elwood Quesada, commander of IX Tactical Air Command, supporting the First U.S. Army. He developed the &quot;armored column cover&quot;, where on-call fighter-bombers maintained a high level of availability for important tank advances, allowing armor units to maintain a high tempo of exploitation even when they outran their artillery assets. He also used a modified antiaircraft radar to track friendly attack aircraft to redirect them as necessary, and experimented with assigning fighter pilots to tours as forward air controllers to familiarize them with the ground perspective. In July 1944, Quesada provided VHF aircraft radios to tank crews in Normandy. When the armored units broke out of the Normandy beachhead, tank commanders were able to communicate directly with overhead fighter-bombers. However, despite the innovation, Quesada focused his aircraft on CAS only for major offensives. Typically, both British and American attack aircraft were tasked primarily to interdiction, even though later analysis showed them to be twice as dangerous as CAS.

XIX TAC, under the command of General Otto P. Weyland used similar tactics to support the rapid armored advance of General Patton&#x27;s Third Army in its drive across France. Armed reconnaissance was a major feature of XIX TAC close air support, as the rapid advance left Patton&#x27;s Southern flank open. Such was the close nature of cooperation between the Third Army and XIX TAC that Patton actually counted on XIX TAC to guard his flanks. This close air support from XIX TAC was credited by Patton as having been a key factor in the rapid advance and success of his Third Army.

The American Navy and Marine Corps used CAS in conjunction with or as a substitute for the lack of available artillery or naval gunfire in the Pacific theater. Navy and Marine F6F Hellcats and F4U Corsairs used a variety of ordnance such as conventional bombs, rockets and napalm to dislodge or attack Japanese troops using cave complexes in the latter part of the Second World War.

====Red Air Force====
The Soviet Union&#x27;s Red Air Force quickly recognized the value of ground-support aircraft. As early as the Battles of Khalkhyn Gol in 1939, Soviet aircraft had the task of disrupting enemy ground operations. This use increased markedly after the June 1941 Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. Purpose-built aircraft such as the Ilyushin Il-2 &quot;Sturmovik&quot; proved highly effective in blunting the activity of the &quot;Panzers&quot;. Joseph Stalin paid the Il-2 a great tribute in his own inimitable manner: when a particular production factory fell behind on its deliveries, Stalin sent the following cable to the factory manager: &quot;They are as essential to the Red Army as air and bread&quot;.

===Korean War===

From Navy experiments with the KGW-1 Loon, the Navy designation for the German V-1 flying bomb, Marine Captain Marian Cranford Dalby developed the AN/MPQ-14, a system that enabled radar-guided bomb release at night or in poor weather.

Though the Marine Corps continued its tradition of intimate air–ground cooperation in the Korean War, the newly created United States Air Force (USAF) again moved away from CAS, now to strategic bombers and jet interceptors. Though eventually the Air Force supplied sufficient pilots and forward air controllers to provide battlefield support, coordination was still lacking. Since pilots operated under centralized control, ground controllers were never able to familiarize themselves with pilots, and requests were not processed quickly. Harold K. Johnson, then commander of the 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division (later Army Chief of Staff) commented regarding CAS: &quot;If you want it, you can&#x27;t get it. If you can get it, it can&#x27;t find you. If it can find you, it can&#x27;t identify the target. If it can identify the target, it can&#x27;t hit it. But if it does hit the target, it doesn&#x27;t do a great deal of damage anyway.&quot;

It is unsurprising, then, that MacArthur excluded USAF aircraft from the airspace over the Inchon Landing in September 1950, instead relying on Marine Aircraft Group 33 for CAS. In December 1951, Lt. Gen. James Van Fleet, commander of the Eighth U.S. Army, formally requested the United Nations Commander, Gen. Mark Clark, to permanently attach an attack squadron to each of the four army corps in Korea. Though the request was denied, Clark allocated many more Navy and Air Force aircraft to CAS. Despite the rocky start, the USAF would also work to improve its coordination efforts. It eventually required pilots to serve 80 days as forward air controllers (FACs), which gave them an understanding of the difficulties from the ground perspective and helped cooperation when they returned to the cockpit. The USAF also provided airborne FACs in critical locations. The Army also learned to assist, by suppressing anti-aircraft fire prior to air strikes.

The U.S. Army wanted a dedicated USAF presence on the battlefield to reduce fratricide, or the harm of friendly forces. This preference led to the creation of the air liaison officer (ALO) position. The ALO is an aeronautically rated officer that has spent a tour away from the cockpit, serving as the primary adviser to the ground commander on the capabilities and limitations of airpower. The Korean War revealed important flaws in the application of CAS. Firstly, the USAF preferred interdiction over fire support while the Army regarded support missions as the main concern for air forces. Then, the Army advocated a degree of decentralization for good reactivity, in contrast with the USAF-favored centralization of CAS. The third point dealt with the lack of training and joint culture, which are necessary for an adequate air-ground integration. Finally, USAF aircraft were not designed for CAS: &quot;the advent of jet fighters, too fast to adjust their targets, and strategic bombers, too big to be used on theatre, rendered CAS much harder to implement&quot;.

===Vietnam and the CAS role debate===

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the US Army began to identify a dedicated CAS need for itself. The Howze Board, which studied the question, published a landmark report describing the need for a helicopter-based CAS requirement. However, the Army did not follow the Howze Board recommendation initially. Nevertheless, it did eventually adopt the use of helicopter gunships and attack helicopters in the CAS role.

Though the Army gained more control over its own CAS due to the development of the helicopter gunship and attack helicopter, the Air Force continued to provide fixed-wing CAS for Army units. Over the course of the war, the adaptation of The Tactical Air Control System proved crucial to the improvement of Air Force CAS. Jets replaced propeller-driven aircraft with minimal issues. The assumption of responsibility for the air request net by the Air Force improved communication equipment and procedures, which had long been a problem. Additionally, a major step in satisfying the Army&#x27;s demands for more control over their CAS was the successful implementation of close air support control agencies at the corps level under Air Force control. Other notable adaptations were the usage of airborne Forward Air Controllers (FACs), a role previously dominated by FACs on the ground, and the use of B-52s for CAS.

U.S. Marine Corps Aviation was much more prepared for the application of CAS in the Vietnam War, due to CAS being its central mission. In fact, as late as 1998, Marines were still claiming in their training manuals that &quot;Close air support (CAS) is a Marine Corps innovation.&quot; One of the main debates taking place within the Marine Corps during the war was whether to adopt the helicopter gunship as a part of CAS doctrine and what its adoption would mean for fixed-wing CAS in the Marine Corps. The issue would eventually be put to rest, however, as the helicopter gunship proved crucial in the combat environment of Vietnam.

Though helicopters were initially armed merely as defensive measures to support the landing and extraction of troops, their value in this role led to the modification of early helicopters as dedicated gunship platforms. Though not as fast as fixed-wing aircraft and consequently more vulnerable to anti-aircraft weaponry, helicopters could use terrain for cover, and more importantly, had much greater battlefield persistence owing to their low speeds. The latter made them a natural complement to ground forces in the CAS role. In addition, newly developed anti-tank guided missiles, demonstrated to great effectiveness in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, provided aircraft with an effective ranged anti-tank weapon. These considerations motivated armies to promote the helicopter from a support role to a combat arm. Though the U.S. Army controlled rotary-wing assets, coordination continued to pose a problem. During wargames, field commanders tended to hold back attack helicopters out of fear of air defenses, committing them too late to effectively support ground units. The earlier debate over control over CAS assets was reiterated between ground commanders and aviators. Nevertheless, the US Army incrementally gained increased control over its CAS role.

In the mid-1970s, after Vietnam, the USAF decided to train an enlisted force to handle many of the tasks the ALO was saturated with, to include terminal attack control. Presently, the ALO mainly serves in the liaison role, the intricate details of mission planning and attack guidance left to the enlisted members of the Tactical Air Control Party.

===NATO and AirLand Battle===
Since their 1977 introduction into modern military practice for close air support purposes, General Crosbie E. Saint provided the AH-64 Apache the doctrinal cover for use in AirLand Battle operations such as in the NATO European theatre.

==Aircraft==

Various aircraft can fill close air support roles. Military helicopters are often used for close air support and are so closely integrated with ground operations that in most countries they are operated by the army rather than the air force. Fighters and ground attack aircraft like the A-10 Thunderbolt II provide close air support using rockets, missiles, bombs, and strafing runs.

During the Second World War, a mixture of dive bombers and fighters were used for CAS missions. Dive bombing permitted greater accuracy than level bombing runs, while the rapid altitude change made it more difficult for anti aircraft gunners to track. The Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; is a well known example of a dive bomber built for precision bombing but which was successfully used for CAS. It was fitted with wind-blown sirens on its landing gear to enhance its psychological effect. Some variants of the Stuka were equipped with a pair of &quot;Bordkanone&quot; BK 3,7 cannons mounted in under-wing gun pods, each loaded with two six-round magazines of armour-piercing tungsten carbide-cored ammunition, for anti-tank operations.

Other than the North American A-36 Apache, a P-51 Mustang modified with dive brakes, the Americans and British used no dedicated CAS aircraft in the Second World War, preferring fighters or fighter-bombers that could be pressed into CAS service. While some aircraft, such as the Hawker Typhoon and the P-47 Thunderbolt, performed admirably in that role, there were a number of compromises that prevented most fighters from making effective CAS platforms. Fighters were usually optimized for high-altitude operations without bombs or other external ordnance – flying at low level with bombs quickly expended fuel. Cannons had to be mounted differently for strafing – strafing required a further and lower convergence point than aerial combat did.

Of the Allied powers that fought in the Second World War, the Soviet Union used specifically designed ground attack aircraft more than the UK and US. Such aircraft included the Ilyushin Il-2, the single most produced military aircraft at any point in world history. The Soviet military also frequently deployed the Polikarpov Po-2 biplane as a ground attack aircraft.

The Royal Navy Hawker Sea Fury fighters and the U.S. Vought F4U Corsair and Douglas A-1 Skyraider were operated in a ground attack capacity during the Korean War. Outside of the conflict, there were numerous other occasions that the Sea Fury was used as a ground attack platform. Cuban Sea Furies, operated by the &quot;Fuerza Aérea Revolucionaria&quot; (&quot;Revolutionary Air Force&quot;; FAR), were used to oppose the US-orchestrated Bay of Pigs Invasion to attack incoming transport ships and disembarking ground forces alike. The A-1 Skyraider also saw later use, especially throughout the Vietnam War.

In the Vietnam War, the United States introduced a number of fixed and rotary wing gunships, including several cargo aircraft that were refitted as gun platforms to serve as CAS and air interdiction aircraft. The first of these to emerge was the Douglas AC-47 Spooky, which was converted from the Douglas C-47 Skytrain/Douglas DC-3. Some commentators have remarked on the high effectiveness of the AC-47 in the CAS role. The USAF developed several other platforms following on from the AC-47, including the Fairchild AC-119 and the Lockheed AC-130. The AC-130 has had a particularly lengthy service, being used extensively during the War in Afghanistan, the Iraq War and the US military intervention in Libya during the early twenty-first century. Multiple variants of the AC-130 have been developed and it has continued to be modernised, including the adoption of various new armaments.

Usually close support is thought to be only carried out by fighter-bombers or dedicated ground-attack aircraft, such as the A-10 Thunderbolt II (&quot;Warthog&quot;) or Su-25 (&quot;Frogfoot&quot;) or attack helicopters such as the AH-64 Apache, but even large high-altitude bombers have successfully filled close support roles using precision-guided munitions. During Operation Enduring Freedom, the lack of fighter aircraft forced military planners to rely heavily on US bombers, particularly the B-1B Lancer, to fill the CAS role. Bomber CAS, relying mainly on GPS guided weapons and laser-guided JDAMs has evolved into a devastating tactical employment methodology and has changed US doctrinal thinking regarding CAS in general. With significantly longer loiter times, range, and weapon capacity, bombers can be deployed to bases outside of the immediate battlefield area, with 12-hour missions being commonplace since 2001. After the initial collapse of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, airfields in Afghanistan became available for continuing operations against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. This resulted in a great number of CAS operations being undertaken by aircraft from Belgium (F-16 Fighting Falcon), Denmark (F-16), France (Mirage 2000D), the Netherlands (F-16), Norway (F-16), the United Kingdom (Harrier GR7s, GR9s and Tornado GR4s) and the United States (A-10, F-16, AV-8B Harrier II, F-15E Strike Eagle, F/A-18 Hornet, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, UH-1Y Venom).
The use of information technology to direct and coordinate precision air support has increased the importance of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance in using CAS. Laser, GPS, and battlefield data transfer are routinely used to coordinate with a wide variety of air platforms able to provide CAS. The 2003 joint CAS doctrine reflects the increased use of electronic and optical technology to direct targeted fires for CAS. Air platforms communicating with ground forces can also provide additional aerial-to-ground visual search, ground-convoy escort, and enhancement of command and control (C2), assets which can be particularly important for low intensity conflict.

<doc id="600797" wikidata="Q189212" url="?curid=600797" title="Aboriginal Tent Embassy">
<text>The Aboriginal Tent Embassy is a permanent protest occupation site as a focus for representing the political rights of Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islander people. Established on 26 January (Australia Day) 1972, and celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2022, it is the longest continuous protest for Indigenous land rights in the world.

First established in 1972 under a beach umbrella as a protest against the McMahon government&#x27;s approach to Indigenous Australian land rights, the Aboriginal Tent Embassy is made up of signs and tents. Since 1992 it has been located on the lawn opposite Old Parliament House in Canberra, the Australian capital. It is not considered an official embassy by the Australian Government. The Embassy has been a site of protest and support for grassroots campaigns for the recognition of Indigenous land rights in Australia, Aboriginal deaths in custody, self-determination, and Indigenous sovereignty.

==Background==
Chicka Dixon said that he had attended a political rally in 1946 where the initial idea and inspiration for the Embassy was raised by Jack Patten, President and co-founder of the Aborigines Progressive Association. Patten had called for an Aboriginal mission station to be placed in front of Parliament House, where the eyes of the world could see the plight of the land&#x27;s First Peoples.

In 1967, Australians voted in an historic referendum to amend the Australian Constitution to allow the Commonwealth Government to include Aboriginal people in official population counts for constitutional purposes, and to be able to make separate laws for them; however, young urban Aboriginal people were not happy with progress since then. There had been many years of conservative governments in Australia, and during the 1960s there were also large protests against Australian involvement in the Vietnam War as well as against apartheid in South Africa. This energy was tapped into by Indigenous rights protesters.

On 26 January 1972 (Australia Day), then prime minister William McMahon issued a new policy relating to Aboriginal land use. Under this new legislation by the Coalition government, which had refused to recognise Aboriginal land rights or native title in Australia, Indigenous people would be granted leases. They offered 50-year general-purpose leases for Aboriginal people which would be conditional upon their &quot;intention and ability to make reasonable economic and social use of land&quot;, while reserving for the Crown rights to minerals and forestry.

==1972: establishment ==

On 26 January 1972, four Aboriginal men, Michael Anderson, Billy Craigie, Tony Coorey and Bertie Williams (son of singer Harry Williams; later Kevin &quot;Bert&quot; Johnson), arrived in Canberra from Sydney, to establish an Aboriginal Embassy by planting a beach umbrella on the lawn in front of Parliament House (now Old Parliament House).

Williams suggested calling the tiny protest, at that point just a camp with a few placards, an embassy. The term &quot;embassy&quot; was deliberately chosen to draw attention to the fact Aboriginal people had never ceded sovereignty, and that there had never been any kind of treaty process with the Crown; they were the only cultural group in Australia who did not have an embassy to represent them. Dr Gary Foley later wrote in his 2014 book about the embassy that the term &quot;tent embassy&quot; was intended to serve as a reminder that Aboriginal people were living in substandard conditions, and treated &quot;like aliens in their own land&quot;.

On 6 February 1972 the Aboriginal Tent Embassy presented a list of demands to Parliament:
*Control of the Northern Territory as a State within the Commonwealth of Australia; the parliament in the Northern Territory to be predominantly Aboriginal with native title and mining rights to all land within the Territory.
*Legal title and mining rights to all other presently existing Aboriginal reserve lands and settlements throughout Australia.
*The preservation of all sacred sites throughout Australia.
*Legal title and mining rights to areas in and around all Australian capital cities.
*Compensation money for lands not returnable to take the form of a down-payment of billion and an annual percentage of the gross national income.

Leader of the Australian Labor Party (then in opposition) Gough Whitlam spoke at the Embassy on 8 February 1972, as did Bobbi Sykes and Frank Roberts Jnr, father of theatre director Rhoda Roberts.

The beach umbrella was soon replaced by several tents and Aboriginal people, including activists such as Gary Foley, Isabel Coe, John Newfong, Chicka Dixon, and Gordon Briscoe, and non-Indigenous supporters came from all parts of Australia to join the protest. The occupiers were told by Kep Enderby that they were legally entitled to camp outside Parliament since it was Commonwealth land. Dixon said that he became the &quot;Minister for Defence&quot; and they all assigned themselves portfolios. They painted the gutter &quot;No Parking – Aboriginal Staff Only&quot;, and then introduced the (Aboriginal) flag. Support grew around the world too.

In May 1972, with winter approaching, embassy spokesman Sammy Watson Jnr announced that it would be cutting down its staff to four people over winter. A new accounting system would be introduced, with their bookkeeping open to inspection. Any donations superfluous to the needs of running the embassy would be given to community projects. Watson and Gary Foley said that the aim of the embassy was &quot;to develop awareness among urban Blacks, in particular, of Black nationalism, and to unite all Aborigines despite cultural or language difficulties in the fight for their rights&quot;. They also expressed solidarity with other oppressed groups, and class struggles. Michael Anderson resigned as High Commissioner for the embassy at this time as he wished to turn his attention to a voter registration among Aboriginal people in rural New South Wales.

The demands were rejected, and following an amendment to the &quot;Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance 1932&quot; (which made the occupation a squat which could then be evicted), police moved in without notice on 20 July 1972. They removed the tents and arrested eight people. Three days later, on 23 July, 200 activists returned to the site and were prevented from reoccupying it by 200 police, who dismantled the embassy. Chicka Dixon commented &quot;we decided to fight the coppers, so we armed ourselves with little sticks&quot;. The police did not intervene, and after listening to speeches the crowd dispersed peacefully. The clash was later described by Anderson as &quot;a bloody battle&quot;, which caused 36 police to be taken to hospital and 18 protesters to be sent to jail. A week later on 30 July, around 2000 people turned up, and the tents were re-erected afterwards removed by the protesters, in a peaceful demonstration.

During the first six months of its life in 1972 the Embassy succeeded in uniting Aboriginal people throughout Australia in demanding uniform national land rights, and mobilised widespread non-Indigenous support for the cause. Humour was used to engage ordinary Australians. Other people associated with the Embassy demonstration in 1972 include Gary Williams, Sam Watson (aka Sammy Watson Jnr), Pearl Gibbs, Roberta Sykes, Alana Doolan, Cheryl Buchanan (later partner of poet and activist Lionel Fogarty, and mother of six children), Pat Eatock, Kevin Gilbert, Denis Walker, and Shirley Smith (&quot;Mum Shirl&quot;).

Many of the main participants in the Embassy, including John Newfong, Cheryl Buchanan, Gary Foley and Michael Anderson, also produced Indigenous newspapers, which published alternative information from that found in mainstream newspapers. The Embassy also began to attract attention in the international press such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and BBC News, and comparisons were made with apartheid in South Africa. Some of the protesters in the Aboriginal rights movement had been involved in the Black theatre, and performed street theatre as well as being heard on the stage.

The ACT Supreme Court ruled in September 1972 that the amendment to the &quot;Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance 1932&quot; did not allow for the eviction of the Embassy. A Bill was quickly added to make the Ordinance retrospective, and the Embassy was evicted again the next day, after it had been symbolically re-erected.

==1970s–1990s: temporary relocation==
In October 1973, around 70 Aboriginal protesters staged a sit-in on the steps of Parliament House and the Tent Embassy was re-established. The sit-in ended when Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam agreed to meet with protesters.

On 30 May 1974 the embassy was destroyed in a storm, but its contents were safeguarded by the Department of the Capital Territory, and it was re-established on 30 October by the Organisation of Aboriginal Unity (OAU), who staged a sit-in in at the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and on the steps of Parliament House and temporarily renamed it the Canberra Aboriginal Reserve. They charged Whitlam with forgetting his earlier promises. On 21 November the OAU said that the &quot;mission&quot; would remain on the Parliament House lawns until &quot;The Department of Aboriginal Affairs was abolished; all reserves and land on which blacks were now living were handed back to them in full ownership; compensation for land lost was paid plus a percentage of the annual gross income; an Aboriginal commission was formed to handle Aboriginal affairs and distribute all funds; all budget submissions were met and approved in time to enable all black organisations to function at the requirement of the people&quot;.

In February 1975 Aboriginal activist Charles Perkins negotiated the &quot;temporary&quot; removal of the Embassy with the Government, pending Government action on land rights. In December 1976 the embassy was dismantled after the passing of the &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976&quot; with bipartisan support by the Fraser government, having been introduced by the Whitlam government in mid-1975. The protest site was then relocated to various sites in Canberra until 1992. In March 1976, the Embassy was established in a house in the nearby suburb of Red Hill; however, this closed in 1977. For a short period in 1979, the embassy was re-established by Lyall Munro Jnr, Cecil Patten, and Paul Coe, as the &quot;National Aboriginal Government&quot; on Capital Hill, site of the proposed new Parliament House.

On the 20th anniversary of its founding in 1992, the Aboriginal Tent Embassy was re-established at the original site on the lawns of Old Parliament House. Despite being a continual source of controversy, with many calls for its removal, it has existed on the site since that time.

In 1993, the ashes of the poet Kevin Gilbert, who had been involved in the early days, were buried at the site.

The site of the Tent Embassy was added to the Australian Register of the National Estate in 1995, after being registered in 1987, as the only Aboriginal site in Australia that is recognised nationally as representing political struggle for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

==2000s==

In the leadup to the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Isabel Coe from the Wiradjuri Nation set up a Peace Camp and combined ashes from Canberra&#x27;s sacred fire to the fire at Victoria Park in Camperdown, New South Wales to promote reconciliation. This sacred fire was originally made by Kevin Buzzacott and lit by Wiradjuri man Paul Coe at the embassy in 1998.

The 30th anniversary was celebrated in January 2002, when at which time a group of Aboriginal elders, including Uncle Kevin Buzzacott, reclaimed the sacred totems of the kangaroo and emu (which come with cultural obligations) from the Australian Coat of Arms, which was put on public display in front of the ceremonial fire. Police were called, and Buzzacott was charged with &quot;dishonestly appropriating a bronze coat of arms with the intention of permanently depriving the Commonwealth of its property&quot;. Buzzacott also made an unsuccessful attempt to charge the Australian Government with genocide, but this was turned down by the Attorney-General.

There have been a number of suspicious fires at the site. The most devastating fire took place in June 2003, when 31 years of records were lost. Police again attempted to remove protesters from the site after this.

Some elders of the local Ngunnawal people called for the eviction of the Tent Embassy in 2005, viewing it as an eyesore.

In August 2005, the Federal Government (then the fourth term of the Howard government) announced a review into the Aboriginal Tent Embassy. A non-Indigenous professional mediation firm, Mutual Mediations, was appointed by the Territories Minister, Jim Lloyd, to meet tent residents and Aboriginal leaders to develop a plan. They reached a decision on the Embassy&#x27;s future early in December 2005. The key recommendation was that there should be an &quot;evolving concept of the tent embassy without permanent camping&quot;, with seven other main recommendations which, according to Gary Foley, were designed &quot;to bring the anarchistic embassy site effectively under government control and direction&quot;, which &quot;would be the total antithesis of the concept of the embassy and its significance to Indigenous communities Australia wide&quot;.

===2012: 40th anniversary ===

On Australia Day, 26 January 2012, the Embassy celebrated its fortieth anniversary. The National Congress of Australia&#x27;s First Peoples planned a series of events over two days, to celebrate the struggle for Aboriginal land rights and the theatre of political protest. The ACT Government helped to fund the event, which included coachloads of attendees coming from the country, and a Skype session with Gary Foley on stage. Ghillar Michael Anderson was the only one of the original four founders still alive at this time.

What became known as the Australia Day 2012 protests occurred when Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott went to the Lobby Restaurant, close to the embassy site. That morning Abbott had been asked whether he found the Embassy &quot;still relevant&quot; and he had replied &quot;I think the Indigenous people of Australia can be very proud of the respect in which they are held by every Australian and, yes, I think a lot has changed since then and I think it probably is time to move on from that&quot;.

These comments angered activists since they felt Abbott was proposing that the Embassy should be evicted. Gillard and Abbott were hastily escorted from the restaurant under the protection of police officers, and during the scramble Gillard lost one of her shoes, which was collected by protesters. At first the Embassy posted on its Facebook page that the shoe would be returned only in exchange for stolen land, but the shoe was later returned to her.

==2020s==
In December 2021 and January 2022, &quot;Sovereign Citizens&quot; along with anti-vaxxers, staged rival protests, and set fire to the door of Old Parliament House (now housing the Museum of Australian Democracy), causing more than $4 million worth of damage. Ngunnawal elder Aunty Matilda House-Williams, who was there when the embassy was founded in 1972, condemned the fire and said the protest did not represent the embassy or Canberran Indigenous people. Some of the outsiders have been charged.

===2022: 50th anniversary===
On 26 January 2022, at 50 years old, the Tent Embassy has become the longest continuous protest for Indigenous land rights in the world. Organisers said that the week of the anniversary is a chance for First Nations people to &quot;honour and mourn our past, celebrate our survival and strategise for the next 50 years&quot;.

The day was marked by cultural events and speeches, with a focus on reparatory justice and moving forward in the future. Around 2,500 people, including Ngalan Gilbert, grandson of Kevin Gilbert, attended the main march which finished at the site of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy. At a separate event, a crowd was addressed by the only surviving member of the original embassy, Ghillar Michael Anderson, and early participant Cheryl Buchanan. The film &quot;Ningla A-Na&quot;, a documentary film charting Black activism in South-East Australia made in 1972, was screened at the event.

=== &quot;Ningla A-Na&quot; ===

The film &quot;Ningla A-Na&quot;, a documentary film charting Black activism in South-East Australia made in 1972, documents the events, including the eviction by police. The film, whose title means &quot;hungry for land&quot; (in Arrernte), is held in the National Film and Sound Archive owing to its heritage value. Directed and produced by Alessandro Cavadini (brother of producer Fabio Cavadini, with whom he later made &quot;Protected&quot; (1975), about Palm Island), the film contains interviews with Fred Hollows, Mum Shirl, Bob Maza, Carole Johnson and Paul Coe.

The term &quot;Ningla A-na&quot; was also used for the Black Moratorium marches on 14 July 1972.

===&quot;Still We Rise&quot;===

&quot;Still We Rise&quot; is a feature documentary film about Aboriginal activism of the 1970s and since, marking the 50th anniversary of the Tent Embassy. The film was written and directed by Indigenous filmmaker John Harvey, who is from Sabai in the Torres Strait Islands. It premiered on ABC Television on 8 December 2022. It features interviews with Paul Coe, Gary Foley, Bobbi Sykes, Chicka Dixon, and Denis Walker, and music by King Stingray, Dan Sultan, Miiesha and others. Billy Craigie, Bertie Williams, Tony Coorey, and Ghillar Michael Anderson also appear in the film, which celebrates their activism and asks the question why they are not better known today. It was made by Tamarind Tree Pictures in association with VicScreen, with some financing by Screen Australia, and developed and produced in association with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Harvey was informed by talks with Gary Foley, now an academic and historian. &quot;Still We Rise&quot; has a special screening at ACMI in Melbourne on 18 December 2022 which includes a Q&amp;A with Harvey and Gary Foley, and is freely available to Australian viewers on ABC iview. Harvey has produced and directed several other short films and television series.

==Significance and commentary==
At the time, the Tent Embassy focused international attention on injustices in Australia, which had gone largely unnoticed hitherto.

According to Australian scholar Lynda-June Coe, who is a niece of two of the co-founders, the Aboriginal activist movement traces its origins back to Aboriginal warriors who resisted European colonisation during the frontier wars. Coe also stated that the Tent Embassy serves as a symbol which extends back to the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, as Aboriginal Australians never signed a treaty with European colonists nor ceded any of their land; reflecting on the five decades of the Tent Embassy&#x27;s existence, Coe argued that the aims of the Aboriginal activist movement as they were formulated in the 1970s are still relevant to young Aboriginal people today.

The CEO of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services, Jamie McConnachie, sees the Tent Embassy as a kind of &quot;anchor&quot;, which has &quot;created a sea of activism in their communities and beyond&quot;. Some of these issues include the high proportion of Indigenous Australians in prison, Aboriginal deaths in custody, the age of criminal responsibility in Australia, and the debate around Australia Day.

Ken Wyatt, Minister for Indigenous Australians, said on the occasion of the 50th anniversary in 2022 that he did not think that the embassy was redundant.

Federal MP Linda Burney said on the 50th anniversary that it was just as relevant now as it had ever been:

==Other Aboriginal tent embassies==
In 2012, there were six other tent embassies dotted around the nation.

The Redfern Tent Embassy was set up in 2014 by Lyall Munro Jnr, his wife Jenny Munro, and other activists, to protest against a planned redevelopment of The Block in the Sydney suburb of Redfern.

<text>The Issaquah Alps is the unofficial name for the highlands near Issaquah, Washington, a suburb of Seattle, including Cougar Mountain, Squak Mountain, Tiger Mountain, Taylor Mountain, Rattlesnake Ridge, Rattlesnake Mountain, and Grand Ridge. The term was invented in 1977 by noted nature author Harvey Manning within the pages of his trail guidebook &quot;Footsore 1&quot;, elevating their status from foothills to &quot;Alps&quot; to advocate preservation. Manning himself lived on a developed section of Cougar Mountain in his &quot;200 meter hut&quot;.

In 1979, Harvey Manning helped to found the Issaquah Alps Trails Club to care for the trails and to push for public ownership of the Alps. The IATC, which is headquartered in Issaquah (nicknamed &quot;Trailhead City&quot;), conducts frequent guided hikes throughout the Alps.

The Issaquah Alps follow Interstate 90 from the shore of Lake Washington almost to the western face of the Cascade Range. The hills are composed of andesitic volcanic rock lying on top of older tightly folded rocks from the coastal plain of the North Cascade subcontinent that docked with Washington about 50 million years ago as the entire continent of North America moved west across the ocean. The Alps were heavily eroded by glaciers in the last ice age. The Vashon lobe of the ice sculpted Rattlesnake Ledge, steeply carved the east and west sides of Squak Mountain, and deposited a large erratic on Cougar Mountain, Fantastic Erratic.

Cedar Butte rises abruptly from the moraine between Rattlesnake Ledge and the absolute front of the Cascades. It is sometimes considered part of the Issaquah Alps but it is a relatively young symmetrical volcanic cone and is therefore more closely related to neighboring Mount Washington to the east than the old weathered hills of the majority of the Alps.

<doc id="600805" wikidata="Q1499811" url="?curid=600805" title="Innuendo">
<text>An innuendo is a , or about a person or thing, especially of a denigrating or derogatory nature. It can also be a remark or question, typically disparaging (also called insinuation), that works obliquely by allusion. In the latter sense, the intention is often to insult or accuse someone in such a way that one&#x27;s words, taken literally, are innocent.

According to the &quot;Advanced Oxford Learner&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, an innuendo is &quot;an indirect remark about somebody or something, usually suggesting something bad, mean or rude&quot;, such as:&quot; &quot;innuendos about her private life&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;The song is full of sexual innuendo&quot;.&quot;

==Sexual innuendo==

The term sexual innuendo has acquired a specific meaning, namely that of a &quot;risqué&quot; double entendre by playing on a possibly sexual interpretation of an otherwise innocent uttering. For example: &quot;We need to go deeper&quot; can be seen as either a request for further inquiry or allude to sexual penetration.

==Defamation law==

In the context of defamation law, an innuendo meaning is one which is not directly contained in the words that are illustrated, but which would be understood by those reading it based on specialized knowledge.

==Film, television, and other media==
Comedy film scripts have used innuendo since the beginning of sound film itself. A notable example is the &quot;Carry On&quot; film series (1958–1992) in which innuendo was a staple feature, often including the title of the film itself. British sitcoms and comedy shows such as &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; and &quot;Round the Horne&quot; have also made extensive use of innuendo. Mild sexual innuendo is a staple of British pantomime.

Numerous television programs and animated films targeted at child audiences often use innuendos in an attempt to entertain adolescent/adult audiences without exceeding their network&#x27;s censorship policies. For example, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; employed numerous innuendos over its run, such as alluding to masturbation by naming the fictional fast food chain in the show &quot;Chokey Chicken&quot;. Over 20 percent of the show&#x27;s audience were adults as a result.

On &quot;The Scott Mills Show&quot; on BBC Radio 1, listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with innuendos in a humorous context, a feature known as &quot;Innuendo Bingo&quot;. Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.

<text>Mazes and Monsters, also known as Rona Jaffe&#x27;s Mazes and Monsters, is a 1982 American made-for-television film directed by Steven Hilliard Stern about a group of college students and their interest in a fictitious role-playing game (RPG) of the same name. The film stars Tom Hanks in his first lead acting role.

==Plot==
The film begins &quot;in medias res&quot; with a scene in which a reporter meets with police searching a cavern. He is told a game of &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot; got out of hand.

Robbie Wheeling starts college at Grant University and soon develops a group of friends, all of whom have personal problems and issues. Jay-Jay feels marginalized by his mother, who constantly redecorates his room since she cannot make up her mind about the best look. In his &quot;self-decorating&quot;, he wears a variety of unusual hats. Kate has had a series of failed relationships, and suffers from her father leaving home; Daniel&#x27;s parents reject his dream of becoming a video game designer; and Robbie&#x27;s alcoholic mother and strict father fight constantly, and he is still tormented by the mysterious disappearance of his brother, Hall. They are fans of &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot;, a fantasy role-playing game over which Robbie was kicked out of his last school when he became too obsessed with it. Though he is reluctant, the other three students convince him to start playing again with them.

Through the course of playing the game, Robbie and Kate begin a romantic relationship; he confides in her that he still has nightmares about his missing brother. Eventually, Jay-Jay, upset by feeling left out by his friends, decides to commit suicide in a local cavern. In the process of planning it, he changes his mind and decides the cavern would be better suited to a new &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot; campaign. He kills off his character to force them to start a new campaign, in which he says they will be living out their fantasy. He proposes playing his new game in a disused and condemned cavern, and dismisses the warnings from his friends – who reluctantly agree to participate.

During the actual spelunking, Robbie experiences a psychotic episode involving the last time he saw his brother, and hallucinates that he has slain a monster called a Gorvil. From this point forward, Robbie believes he is actually his character, the cleric Pardieu. This leads him to break off his relationship with Kate (to maintain celibacy) and start drawing maps that will lead him to a sacred place he has seen in his dreams, the Great Hall. In his dream, the Great Hall tells him to go to the Two Towers, and he disappears.

Robbie&#x27;s friends report him to the police while concealing their trip into the caverns. They and police investigators suspect he is deceased. Robbie travels to New York City, where he stabs a mugger whom he imagines to be a monster. He sees blood on his knife, then his bloodied clothes in a window, and breaks out of his delusions long enough to call Kate from a payphone. After he agrees to go to Jay-Jay&#x27;s house, a delusion leads him into the subway. Not finding him at Jay-Jay&#x27;s house, the friends deduce Robbie has equated the Two Towers with the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Robbie believes that by jumping off one of them and casting a spell, he will finally join the Great Hall. After a search, his friends spot him wandering in the South Tower lobby. They fail to get his attention before Robbie proceeds to the elevator and end up on the observation deck. Using the game&#x27;s rules, they succeed in stopping him from jumping, once again pulling him out of his delusion.

The film ends with the friends visiting Robbie at his parents&#x27; estate, hoping to pick up their friendship where they left off. Though he is now in regular counseling, it is implied that Robbie will live out the rest of his life trapped in his imaginary world, believing he is Pardieu, that his friends are their characters, and that he is living at an inn (actually his parents&#x27; home) and paying for his boarding with a coin that &quot;magically&quot; reappears in his pouch each morning. He then tells his shocked friends of a great evil lurking in the forest across the lake, believing that it threatens the lives of the &quot;innkeeper&quot; and his wife. The three, feeling sorry for Robbie and guilty for their role in his psychotic break, decide to engage him in a &quot;game&quot; of &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot;, letting Robbie dictate the events to them. In the end, Kate says, &quot;And so ... we played the game again ... for one last time.&quot;

==Production==

The film was adapted from Rona Jaffe&#x27;s 1981 novel &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot;.

Jaffe based the novel on inaccurate newspaper stories about the disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III from Michigan State University in 1979. Early media accounts overemphasized Egbert&#x27;s participation in fantasy role playing, speculating that his hobby of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; might have been a factor in his disappearance. William Dear, the private investigator hired to investigate the case, explained actual events and the reasons behind the media myth in his 1984 book &quot;The Dungeon Master&quot;. The public had received the novel amidst a climate of uncertainty regarding the new pastime of role-playing games. Jaffe&#x27;s account was read by many as a legitimate depiction of role-playing games, as many of her readers had no prior knowledge of the subject. In fact, in 1985 psychiatrist and anti-television violence activist Thomas Radecki of the National Coalition on Television Violence cited a fictitious letter written by a character in the novel as &quot;proof&quot; that &quot;D&amp;D&quot; had caused the death of gamers.

Like the novel on which it is based, the film touches on the claim that playing role-playing games could be related to psychological problems. At least one protagonist is (or appears to be) suffering from schizophrenia (or some analogous condition).

==Home media==
The film has been available on VHS, DVD, and various streaming services. On September 19, 2022, Plumeria Pictures released a 40th-anniversary Blu-ray, the film&#x27;s first high-definition release.

<text>The Island of Rockall Act 1972 (c. 2) is a British act of Parliament formally incorporating the island of Rockall into the United Kingdom to protect it from Irish and Icelandic claims. The act as originally passed declared that the Island of Rockall was now part of the Scottish county of Inverness-shire (it is now in the Western Isles).

The act has a single effective section, which reads:

It was amended by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 (c. 65) to transfer administrative control to the Western Isles Council when Inverness-shire was abolished.

<doc id="600811" wikidata="Q2908065" url="?curid=600811" title="The Masses Against the Classes">
<text>&quot;The Masses Against the Classes&quot; is a song by British rock band Manic Street Preachers, released as a limited-edition single in January 2000. It was a stand-alone single, not featured on any studio album, and was deleted (removed from wholesale supply) on the day of release. Despite being deleted on the day of release, the single peaked at the top of the UK Singles Chart

==Background==
The title of the song is derived from a quotation from the 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone (&quot;All the world over, I will back the masses against the classes&quot;). The single begins with a Noam Chomsky quotation and ends with a quotation from Albert Camus. The record sleeve features the Cuban flag albeit without the star, a mark of the band&#x27;s socialist political ideology. The band later played in Havana, in February 2001, to a sold-out Karl Marx theatre with Fidel Castro in the audience, whom they met when he arrived just thirty minutes before they were due to play.

==Content==
&quot;The Masses Against the Classes&quot; is considered a return to the alternative rock style of music produced by the band in the early to mid-1990s, while the lyrics reply to criticism of the &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; album, which had featured a softer, more pop-oriented sound. The song was debuted on the festival circuit late in mid-1999.

Martin Power proclaimed &quot;The Masses Against the Classes&quot; a &quot;raucous, guitar-driven slice of pop-punk&quot; that recalled Nirvana&#x27;s 1991 song &quot;On a Plain&quot;. On the style of the song, bassist Nicky Wire commented that an &quot;Iggy and the Stooges vibe&quot; had been sought.

==Release==
The single sold 76,000 copies in its first week and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart on 16 January 2000, and spent 9 weeks on the chart.

The single also reached number seven in Ireland, while in Finland it was a big success, reaching number four and staying on the chart for 4 weeks. In Norway it peaked at number 12 and charted for 2 weeks, and it is the only Manic Street Preachers single to chart in France, where it reached number 157.

The single was released less than two weeks after the large concert at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 31 December 1999, having been promoted that night; the only video for the single is from the live concert. The concert at the Millennium combined with &quot;The Masses Against the Classes&quot; reaching number one as well as the top 20 in three other countries, and the fact that &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; was a commercial and critical success, is frequently pointed as the peak in the Manic Street Preachers&#x27; career.

&quot;The Masses Against the Classes&quot; was released both as a CD single and numbered 10-inch vinyl; each version also featured the songs &quot;Close My Eyes&quot; and a cover of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;. Its first album appearance was on the greatest hits album &quot;Forever Delayed&quot;. A live version of the song has also appeared as a B-side on &quot;Found That Soul&quot;.

A remastered version, which removed the Albert Camus quotation in the outro, was included on the 2022 reissue of the band&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot;.

==Track listing==
All music was written by James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore except where indicated. All lyrics were written by Nicky Wire except where indicated.

<doc id="600816" wikidata="Q14705409" url="?curid=600816" title="Wapack Trail">
<text>The Wapack Trail is one of the oldest public, interstate hiking trails in the United States. Opened in 1923, it follows the Wapack Range north-south for , between Mount Watatic in Ashburnham, Massachusetts, and North Pack Monadnock mountain in Greenfield, New Hampshire. It is designed primarily for day use by hikers, with minimal camping facilities.

The trail passes through the Massachusetts towns of Ashburnham and Ashby, and the New Hampshire towns of New Ipswich, Temple, Sharon, Peterborough, and Greenfield. It also goes over Temple Mountain, and through Miller State Park, Binney Hill Wilderness Preserve, and the Wapack National Wildlife Refuge, as well as numerous privately owned parcels of land. In New Ipswich it skirts Windblown Cross-Country Ski Area, which operated for four decades until closing in 2020.

The trail is overseen by Friends of the Wapack, a non-profit group. Aside from upgrading and maintaining the trail, the group is trying to have the entire length preserved from development.

The southern part of the Wapack Trail overlaps with the northern part of the Midstate Trail.
== History ==
The trail was born in a conversation in the summer of 1922 at the Shattuck Inn in Jaffrey, New Hampshire between Allen Chamberlain, formerly president of the Appalachian Mountain Club, and Jaffrey farmer Albert Annett while overlooking the Wapack Range, then known as the Boundary Mountains. The two talked about the possibility of a skyline trail along the ridge of the Boundary Mountains from Mt. Watatic to North Pack Monadnock. Later, Albert brought the idea to fellow farmers Frank Robbins and Marion Buck of Rindge, New Hampshire. The three started cutting the trail near the end of the summer using hand tools. The trail was opened in 1923. Buck named it by joining the &quot;Wa&quot; from Mt. Watatic and &quot;Pack&quot; from North Pack Monadnock, and soon the Boundary Mountains became known as the Wapack Range.

== Trail running races ==

There are two running races along the trail. A race in May was started in 2007 by Bogie Dumitrescu. It is and goes the whole length of the trail beginning at the northern terminus. A longer out-and-back ultramarathon version starts at the southern terminus and runs all the way to the northern terminus and back. An out and back segment to Binney Pond is added to bring the distance to 50 miles. Slower runners are stopped after .

On Labor Day in early September, a race coordinated by Paul Funch covers the southern part of the trail. It starts at the Windblown cross-country ski area and proceeds to Mount Watatic and back.

<text>Caddyshack II is a 1988 American sports comedy film and a sequel to the 1980 film &quot;Caddyshack&quot;. Directed by Allan Arkush and written by Harold Ramis (who co-wrote and directed the original &quot;Caddyshack&quot;) and PJ Torokvei, it stars Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dyan Cannon, Dina Merrill, Jonathan Silverman, Brian McNamara, Marsha Warfield, Paul Bartel, and Randy Quaid with special appearances by Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd. It tells the story of a wealthy and widowed real estate developer who goes up against Bushwood County Club&#x27;s snobbish president in a golfing tournament.

While the writing of the film is officially credited to Ramis and Torokvei, the first-draft script by Ramis and Torokvei was rewritten by other uncredited writers.

The sequel was panned by critics and is considered one of the worst sequels of all time. However, Kenny Loggins&#x27; &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; which was used as the film&#x27;s theme song was a chart success where it hit #8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Plot==
Kate Hartounian is the teenage daughter of Jack, a wealthy and widowed real estate developer of Armenian and Jewish descent. Eager to improve her social status, Kate befriends the snobbish WASP Miffy Young, who encourages Kate and the rough but charming Jack to join their country club Bushwood, where the gopher still dwells.

When the elitist, old money members of Bushwood meet self-made millionaire Jack, who builds low-income housing in upscale neighborhoods and displays many working class traits, his application to join is rejected. The only member of the club who takes a liking to the lewd, but well-meaning Jack is wealthy widow Elizabeth Pearce. Jack runs afoul of Bushwood&#x27;s arrogant president Chandler Young who declares the Hartounians &quot;are not Bushwood material.&quot; Chandler&#x27;s equally haughty wife Cynthia tries to persuade Jack to build his housing complex away from her neighborhood after her son Todd failed to persuade Jack&#x27;s lawyer Peter Blunt, leading Jack to chase her and the Pierponts with a bulldozer. In addition, Jack wins Chandler, Cynthia, Mr. Jamison, the Pierponts, and each of its &quot;secret slaves&quot; in an auction that involves them working on his construction site. Jack&#x27;s behavior upsets Kate, harming their relationship as she befriends a caddy named Harry.

In retaliation for being blacklisted by the club and Chandler having the construction site being shut down by establishing a Historical Preservation Society, Jack turns to his friend Ty Webb who owns the majority share of Bushwood, but otherwise stays out of the club&#x27;s day-to-day operations. Jack buys Ty&#x27;s stock in the club - making himself majority owner - and turns Bushwood into a gaudy amusement park called Jackie&#x27;s Wacky Golf, angering Chandler and the other club members when they lose at each hole against Peter. Chandler hires a mercenary named Captain Tom Everett to kill Jack after being hooked up by their mutual friend. Kate moves in with Miffy after a heated argument with Jack.

Chandler and Todd threaten Blunt with endless legal motions and filings intended to financially bankrupt Jack. Ty Webb suggests that the dispute between Jack and Chandler be resolved by the two men facing each other in a golf match. If Chandler wins, Jack gives up his construction site and the country club. If Jack wins, he keeps Bushwood and the housing project. Chandler hedges his bet by expecting Everett to kill Jack. Everett botches the first attempt by accidentally blowing up Chandler&#x27;s Rolls-Royce which he mistook for Jack&#x27;s car.

On the day of the golf match, Ty enlists Harry to be Jack&#x27;s caddie following Jack&#x27;s training. Everett&#x27;s mission is derailed by the antics of the gopher. Despite Jack&#x27;s poor performance early in the match, he manages to tie the score before the final hole. While playing the hole, Jack is faced with a 50-foot putt while Chandler faces a simple two-foot putt. Employing advice given to him by Webb before the match, Jack manages to sink the nearly impossible putt. Chandler needs to sink the easy two-foot putt to tie the match.

Meanwhile, Everett accidentally shoots himself in the buttocks with a poison dart. Kate commiserates with Miffy who suggests that she change her last name from Hartounian to Hart. Although she is embarrassed by her father&#x27;s actions, Kate is still loyal to Jack and is bewildered at the thought of changing her family name. Kate attacks Miffy and reconciles with her father during the final hole. Everett fails to eliminate Jack as the gopher steals an explosive golf ball from him. The gopher quietly replaces Chandler&#x27;s ball with the explosive ball. As Chandler putts the ball, it bursts in front of the Young family and Jack wins the match.

Ty encounters Everett who asks him for help removing a poisoned arrow and sucking out the poison. Peter mocks Chandler and Miffy argues with her mother over marrying Chandler while Todd falls unconscious. Jack asks Elizabeth out on a date and she accepts. The gopher pops out of the hole during the celebration and pursues a poodle.

==Cast==
Construction workers portrayed by Andre Rosey Brown, Dennis Bowen, Gary Carlos Cervantes, Kenny D&#x27;Aquila, and Mark Christopher Lawrence.

==Pre-production==
The original &quot;Caddyshack&quot; was a box-office success, making $60 million worldwide on a budget of $4.8 million. Warner Bros. therefore set about to make a sequel. As originally planned, &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; would have reunited Rodney Dangerfield (one of the stars of the original &quot;Caddyshack&quot;) with the director Alan Metter, who had worked with Dangerfield in the comedy film &quot;Back to School&quot; (1986). Dangerfield, who made $35,000 for &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, asked for $7 million – of which $5 million was to be paid in advance – to reprise his Al Czervic role in &quot;Caddyshack II.&quot; Needing a big comedy for the summer of 1988, Warner Bros. agreed to Dangerfield&#x27;s demands and paid Chevy Chase a seven-figure sum to reprise his role of Ty Webb from the original &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (albeit via a glorified cameo).

Jon Peters, executive producer of &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, would produce the sequel with Peter Guber and Neil Canton. The studio invited &quot;Caddyshack&quot; director Harold Ramis, who co-wrote that film with Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney, to write the sequel. (Neither Doyle-Murray nor Kenney were involved in the sequel; &quot;Caddyshack&quot; producer/co-writer Kenney died in August 1980, a month after that film&#x27;s release.)

Ramis later described &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;, which he co-wrote with his &quot;Second City Television&quot; colleague PJ Torokvei, as &quot;terrible.&quot; In an interview with The A.V. Club in 1999, Ramis said that:

Ramis was later quoted as saying that Dangerfield was the only one who expressed an interest in doing a sequel in the first place. Ted Knight had died two years earlier, Bill Murray was not interested in reprising his role as Carl the greenskeeper, and he said Chevy Chase had &quot;already moved on&quot;, although Chase did eventually agree to appear.

Ramis worked on the first draft of &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; in the summer of 1987 with Torokvei. Rodney Dangerfield did not like the script and requested rewrites. Growing disillusioned with the project, Dangerfield reportedly tried to force Warner Bros. to release him from his contract by demanding additional royalties and final-cut rights. In October 1987, less than a month before &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; was scheduled to begin filming and with $2 million already spent by the studio on pre-production, Dangerfield dropped out of the project because he felt it would not be successful. Warner Bros. sued Dangerfield for breach of contract. Early in the hearings, the studio settled with Dangerfield for an undisclosed amount.

The project was put on hold while Warner Bros. looked for a new director, eventually landing upon Allan Arkush. A former protégé of Roger Corman and collaborator with Joe Dante, Arkush directed several motion pictures (including the 1979 cult hit &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot;) before becoming a prolific director of episodic television, with credits including &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, and &quot;Moonlighting&quot;. Arkush was keen to get back into directing films, later recalling, &quot;I had a really successful run on television. &quot;Moonlighting&quot; was a big deal, I was doing &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, working on pilots and I had a deal with Warner Bros. to direct and they said, “Well, there’s another &quot;National Lampoon&quot; movie.” &quot;National Lampoon Goes to College&quot; and I thought, “That sounds like a good idea.” They couldn&#x27;t get it bought. So they asked, “How would you like to make &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;?”

After the offer was made, Arkush rented and watched the original &quot;Caddyshack&quot; and signed on to direct the sequel. He was not aware at the time of the litigation between the studio and Rodney Dangerfield.

==Production==
It was only after agreeing to direct &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; that Allan Arkush realized how much trouble the project was in: production began in late 1987 and Warner Bros. still insisted upon a summer 1988 release, meaning only half a year for principal photography and post-production. Adding to this difficulty was the fact that the project was nowhere near ready to begin filming. Arkush later claimed, “The more I got into it, the more I realized that they didn’t have a script that was in any kind of shape, they didn’t have Bill Murray and now they didn’t have Rodney Dangerfield.” Arkush likened his assignment “to hopping onto a moving ship barreling full steam ahead.”

Screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, who scripted &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), were brought in to overhaul Ramis and Torokvei&#x27;s script (although they would ultimately receive no official credit for doing so). With Rodney Dangerfield out of the picture, the screenplay replaced Al Czervic with Jack Hartounian, a new character to be played by Jackie Mason - like Dangerfield, a Jewish-American Borscht Belt stand-up comedian. After witnessing Mason&#x27;s one-man comedy act on Broadway at the insistence of producer Jon Peters, Allan Arkush was concerned about the comedian&#x27;s suitability for the film: “The thing that occurred to me was that [Mason] didn’t connect with the audience in any sort of personal way. That’s not necessarily a good thing for someone who’s supposed to be your lead. At least when Rodney says, ‘I get no respect,’ there&#x27;s an empathy that he evokes from the audience.” Arkush also stated, &quot;[Mason] is a very funny joke machine and you laugh yourself silly. I needed a comedian who was equally an actor. I went to the producer Jon Peters and told him my fears. He was so convinced that Jackie was a brilliant comedian and could pull it off. Jon looked me in the eye and said, “Don’t turn a Go picture into a development deal.” I should have walked away.&quot; Mason&#x27;s casting in &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; was publicly announced by &quot;Daily Variety&quot; on November 17, 1987. Of his role as Jack Hartounian, Mason said, &quot;What I like about [him] is that he&#x27;s more concerned with the way people treat each other than whether they use the right words in polite society or raise the proper finger to drink a glass of beer.&quot;

Chevy Chase was the only cast member from the original &quot;Caddyshack&quot; to reprise his role (and would publicly announce later that he regretted doing so). Bill Murray refused to reprise his Carl Spackler role, opting to make &quot;Scrooged&quot; (1988) instead. Murray&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; colleague and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; co-star Dan Aykroyd signed on in Murray&#x27;s place, portraying a mercenary/survivalist hired by Chandler (Stack) to kill Jack (Mason). Although playing new characters in the sequel, Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dan Aykroyd, and Jonathan Silverman play roles that are analogous to those played by Dangerfield, Knight, Murray, and Michael O&#x27;Keefe in the first film. Sam Kinison, who had appeared alongside Dangerfield in &quot;Back to School&quot;, was originally intended for Randy Quaid&#x27;s role, but left the production when Dangerfield dropped out.

&quot;Caddyshack II&quot; began filming on January 18, 1988, at the Rolling Hills Country Club in Davie, Florida (where &quot;Caddyshack&quot; had been filmed just under a decade prior). Despite working on the set with a golf pro, Mason could not make a convincing golf swing; he also couldn&#x27;t remember his lines, had no chemistry with his onscreen love interest (played by Dyan Cannon) and his gorging at the craft services table meant the wardrobe department had to keep letting out his pants. Aykroyd angered the producers by insisting on playing his role with a high-pitched, whinnying voice (which Aykroyd claimed was based on the voice of Colonel Oliver North).

Arkush had a bad working relationship with Chevy Chase, who was paid a substantial fee for a relatively minimal role. Arkush later recalled, &quot;It was a big paycheck, which Chevy talked about a lot... I went into this thinking that Chevy was committed to this character, but he wasn’t. On his first day, we were working out the blocking for his scene and I said, ‘How do you want to do this, Chevy?’ And he was just pissed at me and said, ‘Why? Don’t you have any ideas?!’” Arkush claimed that two days later, when filming Chase, Arkush offered suggestions to which Chase replied, “What? Don’t I get any input on this?!” Later, while watching one of his scenes during postproduction, Chase said to Arkush, “Call me when you’ve dubbed the laugh track,” before walking off in disgust.

Industrial Light and Magic supplied the visual effects for the scenes involving the animatronic gopher; vocal effects for the creature were provided by veteran voice-over artist Frank Welker.

==Music==
The music score for &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; was provided by Ira Newborn. The film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;, was performed by Kenny Loggins, who provided original songs (including the hit song &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot;) for the first &quot;Caddyshack.&quot; Kenny Loggins had composed and recorded &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot; for the 1980 &quot;Caddyshack&quot; film, and was asked by film producer Jon Peters to write a theme song for the sequel. 
Initially, according to Loggins, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t so sure when he called about &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;. I was a little skittish about trusting lightning to strike twice in the same place.&quot; Co-written by Loggins and Michael Towers, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; was later included as the opening track of Loggins&#x27; album &quot;Back to Avalon&quot; (1988).

Other singles from the &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; soundtrack include &quot;Power of Persuasion&quot; by The Pointer Sisters; &quot;Go For Yours&quot;, an R&amp;B hit for Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam and &quot;Turn On (The Beat Box)&quot; by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire who performed &quot;Boogie Wonderland&quot; in the original 1980 &quot;Caddyshack&quot; film. The soundtrack was released on Columbia Records.

== Reception ==
&quot;Caddyshack II&quot; was panned by critics and grossed $11,798,302 compared to the original&#x27;s $39 million gross at the box office. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 4% based on 24 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Handicapped by a family friendly PG rating, even the talents of &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;″s all-star comic cast can&#x27;t save it from its lazy, laughless script and uninspired direction.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 7 out of 100 based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C+ on scale of A to F.

Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Caddyshack II&quot;, a feeble follow-up to the 1980 laff riot, is lamer than a duck with bunions, and dumber than grubs. It&#x27;s patronizing and clumsily manipulative, and top banana Jackie Mason is upstaged by the gopher puppet.&quot;

Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said the film was so bad &quot;it makes &quot;Caddyshack I&quot; look like &quot;Godfather II.&quot;&quot;

Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; ended her review of the film with the words, &quot;If [Jackie] Mason hopes to make the kind of segue from stand-up comedy to movies that Mr. Dangerfield did, he and his advisers better think again. &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; is the kind of film that sends careers spiraling downward.&quot;

Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune wrote, &quot;&quot;Caddyshack II&quot; raises the ghost of summer comedies past. It&#x27;s shoddy, lazy and numbingly stupid,&quot; adding, &quot;The comedy is mostly a matter of flatulent animals and falls into swimming pools, and director Allan Arkush (of the engaging &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot;) executes it with an uncharacteristic clumsiness... Given the name heavy cast – Randy Quaid, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd make appearances – it means something that the most fully developed character in the film is a hand puppet gopher.&quot;

The film received four Golden Raspberry Award nominations; it won two. It was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Actor (Mason) and won for Worst Supporting Actor (Aykroyd) and Worst Original Song (&quot;Jack Fresh&quot;). It also won Worst Picture at the 1988 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards.

Harold Ramis recalled, &quot;[PJ] Torokvei and I went to one of the first research screenings in Pasadena, and we literally crawled out of the theater because we didn&#x27;t want anyone to see us.&quot;

Mark Canton, Warner Bros.&#x27; head of production at the time &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; was made, said in 2010, &quot;It was troubled from the beginning because Rodney didn&#x27;t do it. No offense to Jackie Mason, but it just didn’t work. It was well-intentioned and it was a good business move, but it just wasn’t the same.&quot;

On the subject of &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;, Bill Murray remarked, &quot;You know, &quot;Caddyshack&quot; was a great thing. There were some extraordinary people in it, Ted Knight, Rodney Dangerfield, the guy who played the bishop, these are people who have passed away. They were great people, great actors and lots of fun, and it was an unusual thing. Can&#x27;t you be happy with having seen it and watched it? You want it again?&quot;

In his book &quot;My Year of Chevy: One Man&#x27;s Journey Through the Filmography of Chevy Chase&quot; (2013), film critic Mike McGranaghan wrote:

Allan Arkush regretted directing &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;, the experience of which he claimed sent him to therapy. He later said, &quot;You should never make a movie for the wrong reasons. You should only make movies about something where you know no one else can make it better than you... It was my own fault. Everyone who worked on it worked hard and the writers were good. It was great to work with Danny Aykroyd.&quot;

<text>The IBM System/32 (IBM 5320) introduced in January 1975 was a midrange computer with built-in display screen, disk drives, printer, and database report software. It was used primarily by small to midsize businesses for accounting applications. RPG II was the primary programming language for the machine.

==Overview==

The 16-bit single-user System/32, also known as the IBM 5320, was introduced in 1975, and it was the successor to the IBM System/3 model 6 in the IBM midrange computer line. IBM described it as &quot;the first system to incorporate hardware and comprehensive application software.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the &quot;32&quot; as &quot;a compact computer for first‐time users with little or no computer programming experience.&quot; Within 40 months, &quot;the System/32 had surpassed the IBM System/3 as the most installed IBM computer.&quot;

The computer looked like a large office desk with a very small six-line by forty-character display. Having the appearance of a computerized desk, the System/32 was nicknamed the &quot;Bionic Desk&quot; after &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; (bionic man), a popular U.S. TV program when the computer was introduced in 1975. The &quot;32&quot; had a built-in line printer, that directly faced the operator when seated, and could print reports, memos, billing statements, address labels, etc. 

It had been introduced January 7, 1975 and was withdrawn from marketing on October 17, 1984. Migration to the IBM System/34 was generally simple because source code was compatible and programs just needed recompilation.

==Processor==

The System/32 featured a 16-bit processor with a 200ns cycle time known as the &quot;Control Storage Processor&quot; (CSP). Whereas the System/3 used a hardwired processor, the System/32 implemented the System/3 instruction set in microcode. The System/32 processor utilized a vertical microcode format, with each microinstruction occupying 16 bits of control storage. There were 19 different microinstruction opcodes, however certain microinstructions could carry out different operations depending on which bits were set in the rest of the microinstruction, meaning that there were about 70 distinct operations available in total. An optional set of &quot;Scientific Macroinstructions&quot; was also available, which were used to support a Fortran compiler by implementing support for floating point arithmetic in microcode. Some IBM engineers, including Glenn Henry and Frank Soltis, have retrospectively described the System/32&#x27;s microcode as resembling a RISC instruction set.

The System/3 emulation performed poorly, which led IBM to implement performance critical parts of the SCP operating system directly in microcode. The later System/34 and System/36 systems addressed this problem by using two different processors - the System/32 CSP architecture was used exclusively for operating system, I/O control and floating point code, whereas user code ran on the &quot;Main Storage Processor&quot; (MSP) which implemented the System/3 instruction set directly in hardware without microcode. The use of microcode to implement instruction set emulation as well as performance-critical operating system components had some influence on the design of the microcode layers in the later System/38.

==Memory/storage==
It had 16, 24, or 32 kilobytes of main memory, and 4 or 8 kilobytes of control storage. The larger control store was an optional extra, and was needed to support the scientific instruction set.

A single hard drive was available in one of three sizes:
* 5 MB
* 9 MB
* 13 MB

The system included an eight-inch floppy drive that could also read floppies from the IBM 3740 family.

Only one side of the 77-track floppy diskette was used. Each track held 26 128-byte sectors. An extended format was offered by IBM, and it permitted 512 bytes per sector. Even so, that came to an 8-inch floppy holding less than one third of a megabyte.

==System/32 operator==
When keying input data, the operator would be viewing the character display, which was also common to the then current IBM 3740 family of data entry to floppy disk media.

A computer specialist was not required for the operation of System/32.

==System software==
Some terms associated with the System/32&#x27;s software include: 
* SCP (System Control Program) the operating system of the System/32.
* SEU (Source Entry Utility, the programming editor), 
* DFU (Data File Utility, a query and report generator),
* OCL (Operations Control Language, the command-line language), and 
* #LIBRARY (the directory or disk partition in which executable code was stored).

<text>Drummond/North Elmsley is a township in eastern Ontario, Canada in Lanark County. It is situated on the north shore of the Rideau River between the town of Perth and the town of Smiths Falls. It is a predominantly rural municipality. The township offices are located in the hamlet of Port Elmsley.

==History==
The township, covering 366.03 km2, was formed on January 1, 1998, through the merger of Drummond Township and North Elmsley Township.

==Communities==
The township comprises the communities of Armstrong Corners, Balderson, Beveridge Locks, Cook&#x27;s Shore, Craig Shore, Drummond Centre, Ebbs Shore, Elmgrove, Ferguson Falls, Glenview, Innisville, McCreary&#x27;s Shore, McCulloughs Landing, McNaughton Shore, Port Elmsley, Prestonvale, Richardson, Rideau Ferry, Robertson&#x27;s Shore and Wayside.

==Geography and ecology==
The most common landscape is gently rolling Canadian shield, predominantly gneiss. The valleys often have clay or sand deposits from events near the end of the last ice age. At one point near the end of the last ice age, the Champlain Sea flooded the Ottawa valley as far inland as what is now the town of Perth. West of Perth along Highway 7 one can see a remnant of this clay plain. An old shoreline of the Champlain Sea crosses Highway 7 near Ramsay Concession 2 before winding south into Drummond/North Elmsley. North of Perth, this clay plain is occupied by the huge Blueberry Marsh.

The hard rock and thin soil produced distinctive deciduous forests dominated by maple, oak, beech, ash and pine. Southern trees like hickory and butternut are less common. Wetter areas have elm, silver maple and white cedar. Hemlock was much more common in the past, but logging for bark used in tanning has much depleted this species. Only a few large hemlock stands remain, although there are many scattered trees through the remaining forests. Natural forest fires from lightning created some fire barrens in the southern parts of the township. Generally speaking, settlers cleared the deeper pockets of soil, and the clay plains. This produced the distinctive landscape with fields surrounded by forested uplands. The stone piles along the edge of the field illustrate the labour involved in creating agricultural land here. The many outcrops of Canadian shield in fields are also a reminder of just how close to the surface bed rock remains.

The Mississippi River and the Rideau River have extensive areas of wetland. The less flooded areas tend to have silver maple swamp, while lower on the shoreline are marshes and aquatic plants. One of the largest wetlands is the Innisville wetland, a provincially significant wetland that formed upstream from Mississippi Lake. Other familiar wetlands include the Tay Marsh (south of Perth) and The Swale (near Smiths Falls). Both rivers are popular with canoeists and naturalists. Smaller wetlands occur throughout the county; many are produced by beavers. Beaver ponds are an important as they provide habitat for a great many kinds of species, including frogs, turtles, otters, muskrats and migratory waterfowl. Beaver ponds provide a cycle of flooding, from shallow water through to wet meadow, and most phases of pond ecology can be seen driving the township roads.

Owing to its location—the combination of two large rivers, wetlands and forests—the county has a rich array of wildlife, and wildlife viewing is a popular activity. Significant animal species include the black rat snake (now officially renamed the Gray ratsnake by experts on this species) and the Blanding&#x27;s turtle.

==Transportation==
The north-south Ontario Highway 7 passes through the township from Perth towards Carleton Place. The east-west County Road 43 goes between Perth and Smiths Falls.

The Rideau Trail passes through the township twice, between Smiths Falls and Perth and to the south of Perth.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Drummond/North Elmsley had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="600825" wikidata="Q195871" url="?curid=600825" title="G. D. Spradlin">
<text>Gervase Duan Spradlin (August 31, 1920 – July 24, 2011) was an American actor, attorney, and businessman. Known for his distinctive accent and voice, he often played devious authority figures or high ranking military officers. He is credited in over 70 television and film productions, and performed with actors such as Robby Benson, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Garner, Charlton Heston, George C. Scott, Martin Sheen, and Johnny Depp. One of his best known roles was that of Senator Pat Geary in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;.

==Early life==
Spradlin was born on August 31, 1920, in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma. His parents both worked as schoolteachers. Spradlin obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree in Education from the University of Oklahoma. He was a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. He then served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, where he was stationed in China.

After his military service, Spradlin returned to the University of Oklahoma, where he completed a law degree in 1948.

==Career before acting==
Spradlin&#x27;s career as an attorney began in Venezuela. He became an independent oil producer, forming Rouge Oil Company. Before he turned to acting, he was active in local politics, and he campaigned for John F. Kennedy in 1959.

==Acting career==
In 1964, Spradlin joined the Oklahoma Repertory Theatre.

A notable break for Spradlin resulted from his work in television in the 1960s. Casting director Fred Roos had cast Spradlin in television shows such as &quot;I Spy&quot; (as the immediate superior of Pentagon spies Kelly Robinson and Alexander Scott in the episode &quot;Tonia&quot;), &quot;Mannix&quot; (in an uncredited role as Senator Sid Abernathy in the episode &quot;Turn Every Stone&quot;), and &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; (as visiting Colonel Driscoll in the episode &quot;Gomer Pyle Super Chef&quot;). 

He worked with Jack Webb on the series &quot;Dragnet&quot;, playing multiple roles from a safecracker, a pushy conventioneer caught up in a gambling sting, and a low-level con man. In 1968, he appeared as a false police sergeant, Preston C. Densmore, in S10:E13, “The Phony Police Racket”. Spradlin portrayed Commander Maurice E. &quot;Germany&quot; Curts, Communications Officer, U.S. Pacific Fleet, in an uncredited role in &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; in 1970. He was also in the counter-culture film &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; (1970). 

When Roos co-produced &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, he recommended Spradlin for the role of Pat Geary, a corrupt U.S. senator from Nevada, and Spradlin played a senator in the 1976 TV miniseries &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man Book II&quot;. In 1977, he guest-starred along with Ruth Gordon and Mariette Hartley in the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode, &quot;Try and Catch Me&quot;. His film credits included &quot;One on One&quot; (1977) as an authoritarian basketball coach described by Roger Ebert as &quot;a hard-nosed ace recruiter with a heart of Drano&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; as General Corman, the somber officer who assigns Martin Sheen&#x27;s character to the search mission. He played the head football coach B.A. Strother in &quot;North Dallas Forty&quot; (1979), and &quot;Carolina Military Institute&quot; commandant General Durrell in &quot;The Lords of Discipline&quot; (1983).

In 1984, Spradlin played a villainous Southern sheriff in &quot;Tank&quot;. In 1985, Spradlin portrayed President Lyndon B. Johnson in the mini-series &quot;Robert Kennedy and His Times&quot;, based on the book of the same name by presidential historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. In 1986, he again portrayed an American president when he played Andrew Jackson in the television movie &quot;Houston: The Legend of Texas&quot;. Also in 1986, he starred in the miniseries &quot;Dream West&quot;. In 1988, he played Admiral Raymond A. Spruance in the miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;. In 1989, Spradlin played a small role in the film &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; as a divorce lawyer, with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner.

Spradlin played a minister in &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994), a conspirator in the attempted assassination of a state governor in &quot;Nick of Time&quot; (1995), Bishop Dyer in the TV movie &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; (1996), which was adapted from Zane Grey&#x27;s 1912 novel of the same name, and the President of the United States in &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; (1996).

Spradlin retired from acting after &quot;Dick&quot; (1999), in which he played Ben Bradlee. Although lending his likeness, he did not reprise his role as Pat Geary (whose in-game was voiced by Chris Edgerly) in Electronic Arts&#x27; video game adaptation of &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; in 2009.

== Personal life and death ==
Spradlin&#x27;s first wife, Nell, with whom he had two daughters, died in 2000. In 2002, he married Frances Hendrickson.

Spradlin died of natural causes at his cattle ranch in San Luis Obispo, California, on July 24, 2011. He was 90 years old.

<text>Miller State Park is the oldest state-run park in New Hampshire, a state in the New England region of the United States. It is located in the towns of Peterborough and Temple, and is centered on Pack Monadnock, a mountain.

==Description==
The park was established in 1891 when atop Pack Monadnock were donated to New Hampshire. The name &quot;Pack&quot; comes from an Indian word meaning &quot;little&quot; and is used in comparison to nearby Mount Monadnock. Pack Monadnock has a paved auto road to the top and is the former site of two hotels. It has a renovated fire tower at the summit which is staffed seasonally.

The park has expanded over the years with land donations and purchases. Until 1901, cattle were driven by foot from Massachusetts farms for summer grazing on open pasture extending nearly to the summit. Virtually all the pastures are now overgrown with forest, as little farming is done in the region.

The park is named for James Miller, a Peterborough native who was a brigadier general in the United States Army during the War of 1812 and became the first Governor of Arkansas Territory.

The area is popular with hikers. The Wapack Trail runs through the park, crossing over Pack Monadnock.

In 2007, the state created Temple Mountain State Reservation on the south side of NH Route 101 across from the Miller State Park entrance, when it bought around the closed Temple Mountain Ski Area.

<doc id="600835" wikidata="Q767912" url="?curid=600835" title="Canada balsam">
<text>Canada balsam, also called Canada turpentine or balsam of fir, is the oleoresin of the balsam fir tree (&quot;Abies balsamea&quot;) of boreal North America. The resin, dissolved in essential oils, is a viscous, sticky, colourless or yellowish liquid that turns to a transparent yellowish mass when the essential oils have been allowed to evaporate.

Canada balsam is amorphous when dried. It has poor thermal and solvent resistance.

== Uses ==
Due to its high optical quality and the similarity of its refractive index to that of crown glass (&quot;n&quot; = 1.52), purified and filtered Canada balsam was traditionally used in optics as an invisible-when-dry glue for glass, such as lens elements. Other optical elements can be cemented with Canada balsam, such as two prisms bonded to form a beam splitter.

Canada balsam was also commonly used for making permanent microscope slides. From about 1830 molten Canada balsam was used for microscope slides. Canada balsam in solution was then introduced in 1843, becoming popular in the 1850s. In biology, for example, it can be used to conserve microscopic samples by sandwiching the sample between a microscope slide and a glass coverslip, using Canada balsam to glue the arrangement together and enclose the sample to conserve it.

Canada balsam dissolved in xylene is also used for preparing slide mounts. Some workers prefer terpene resin for slide mounts, as it is both less acidic and cheaper than balsam.

Another important application of Canada balsam is in the construction of the Nicol prism. A Nicol prism consists of a calcite crystal cut into two halves. Canada balsam is placed between the two layers. Calcite is an anisotropic crystal and has different refractive indices for rays polarized along directions parallel and perpendicular to its optic axis. These rays with differing refractive indices are known as the ordinary and extraordinary rays. The refractive index for Canada balsam is in between the refractive index for the ordinary and extraordinary rays. Hence the ordinary ray will be totally internally reflected. The emergent ray will be linearly polarized, and traditionally this has been one of the popular ways of producing polarized light.

Some other uses (traditional and current) include:

* In geology, it is used as a common thin section cement and glue and for refractive-index studies and tests, such as the Becke line test;
* To fix scratches in glass (car glass, for instance) as invisibly as possible;
* In oil painting, to achieve glow and facilitate fusion;
* In Buckley&#x27;s cough syrup.

Balsam was phased out as an optical adhesive during World War II, in favour of polyester, epoxy, and urethane-based adhesives. In modern optical manufacturing, UV-cured epoxies are often used to bond lens elements. Synthetic resins have largely replaced organic balsams for use in slide mounts.

<doc id="600837" wikidata="Q7850345" url="?curid=600837" title="Tsutsugaki">
<text>is a Japanese technique of resist dyeing that involves drawing rice-paste designs on cloth, dyeing the cloth, and then washing off the paste.

The rice paste is typically made from sweet rice, which has a high starch content and is therefore rather sticky. The paste is applied through a tube () similar to a piping bag. A related process is to apply the paste through a stencil, a technique known as .

The cloth dyed is typically cotton, and the dye is typically indigo, so the design is usually white on blue. Banners for shops or other purposes are sometimes made in this manner.

The designs are often creatures from Japanese mythology such as the crane or the tortoise, or a family crest, or a name (written in kanji). Flowers and trees are common motifs as well.

<text>Abies balsamea or balsam fir is a North American fir, native to most of eastern and central Canada (Newfoundland west to central Alberta) and the northeastern United States (Minnesota east to Maine, and south in the Appalachian Mountains to West Virginia).

== Description ==
Balsam fir is a small to medium-size evergreen tree typically tall, occasionally reaching a height of . The narrow conic crown consists of dense, dark-green leaves. The bark on young trees is smooth, grey, and with resin blisters (which tend to spray when ruptured), becoming rough and fissured or scaly on old trees. The leaves are flat and needle-like, long, dark green above often with a small patch of stomata near the tip, and two white stomatal bands below, and a slightly notched tip. They are arranged spirally on the shoot, but with the leaf bases twisted so that the leaves appear to be in two more-or-less horizontal rows on either side of the shoot. The needles become shorter and thicker the higher they are on the tree. The seed cones are erect, long, dark purple, ripening brown and disintegrating to release the winged seeds in September.

=== Medicinal ===
For thousands of years Native Americans used balsam fir for medicinal and therapeutic purposes. The needles are eaten directly off the tree by many animals and humans. Higher content dosage is ingested in tea. Balsam fir contains vitamin C, which has been studied for its effects on bacterial and viral infections.

Balsam fir&#x27;s essential oil and some of its compounds have shown efficacy against ticks.

=== Reproduction ===
The male reproductive organs generally develop more rapidly and appear sooner than the female organs. The male organs contain microsporangia which divide to form sporogenous tissue, composed of cells which become archesporial cells. These develop into microspores, or pollen-mother cells, once they are rounded and filled with starch grains. When the microspores undergo meiosis in the spring, four haploid microspores are produced which eventually become pollen grains. Once the male strobilus has matured the microsporangia are exposed at which point the pollen is released.

The female megasporangiate is larger than the male. It contains bracts and megasporophylls, each of which contains two ovules, arranged in a spiral. These then develop a nucellus in which a mother cell is formed. Meiosis occurs and a megaspore is produced as the first cell of the megagametophyte. As cell division takes place the nucleus of the megaspore thickens, and cell differentiation occurs to produce prothallial tissue containing an ovum. The remaining undifferentiated cells then form the endosperm.

When the male structure releases its pollen grains, some fall onto the female strobilus and reach the ovule. At this point the pollen tube begins to generate, and eventually the sperm and egg meet at which point fertilization occurs.

== Varieties ==
There are two varieties:
* &quot;Abies balsamea&quot; var. &quot;balsamea&quot; (balsam fir) – bracts subtending seed scales short, not visible on the closed cones. Most of the species&#x27; range.
* &quot;Abies balsamea&quot; var. &quot;phanerolepis&quot; (bracted balsam fir or Canaan fir) – bracts subtending seed scales longer, visible on the closed cone. The southeast of the species&#x27; range, from southernmost Quebec to West Virginia. The name &quot;Canaan fir&quot; derives from one of its native localities, the Canaan Valley in West Virginia. Some botanists regard this variety as a natural hybrid between balsam fir and Fraser fir (&quot;Abies fraseri&quot;), which occurs further south in the Appalachian mountains. This produces a slight change in color, making it appear similar to a true Fraser Fir.

== Ecology ==
Balsam firs are very shade tolerant, and tend to grow in cool climates, ideally with a mean annual temperature of , with consistent moisture at their roots. They typically grow in the following four forest types:
* Swamp – swamp forest types never completely dry out, so balsam firs have constant access to water. The ground is covered in sphagnum and other mosses. In swamps, balsam firs grow densely and slowly, and are slender.
* Flat – sometimes referred to as &quot;dry swamps&quot;, these areas are better drained than swamps but still retain moisture well. Fern moss covers the ground and there is a possibility of ground rot. In flat areas balsam fir grows fast, tall, and large, mixed with red spruce.
* Hardwood slope – ground rot is common in this well-drained area, and leaf litter covers the forest floor. Balsam firs grow fast, tall, and large along with big hardwood trees such as yellow birch, sugar maple and beech.
* Mountain top – On mountain tops, stands of balsam fir occasionally develop fir waves. They often grow at an elevation of in pure strands, or in association with black spruce, white spruce, white birch, and trembling aspen. The development is similar to that in swamps with slow growth resulting in slender, short trees. Some of the low branches touch the ground, and may grow roots to produce an independent tree.

The foliage is browsed by moose and deer. The seeds are eaten by American red squirrels, grouse, and pine mice; the tree also provides food for crossbills and chickadees, as well as shelter for moose, snowshoe hares, white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse, and other small mammals and songbirds. The needles are eaten by some lepidopteran caterpillars, for example the Io moth (&quot;Automeris io&quot;).

&quot;Abies balsamea&quot; is one of the most cold-hardy trees known, surviving at temperatures as low as (USDA Hardiness Zone 2). Specimens even showed no ill effects when immersed in liquid nitrogen at .

===Conservation status===
It is listed as endangered in Connecticut. This status applies to native populations only.

=== Pests ===
The balsam fir is the preferred main host of the eastern spruce budworm, which is a major destructive pest throughout the eastern United States and Canada. During cyclical population outbreaks, major defoliation of the balsam fir can occur, which may significantly reduce radial growth. This can kill the tree. An outbreak in Quebec in 1957 killed over 75% of balsam fir in some stands.

The needles of balsam fir can be infected by the fungus &quot;Delphinella balsameae&quot;.

== Cultivation ==
===Christmas trees===
Both varieties of the species are very popular as Christmas trees, particularly in the northeastern United States. Balsam firs cut for Christmas are typically grown on large plantations, not taken from the forest. The balsam fir is one of the greatest exports of Quebec and New England. It is celebrated for its rich green needles, natural conical shape, and needle retention after being cut, and it is notably the most fragrant of all Christmas tree varieties.

The balsam fir was used six times for the US Capitol Christmas Tree between 1964 and 2019.

===Horticulture===
&quot;Abies balsamea&quot; is also grown as an ornamental tree for parks and gardens. Very hardy down to or below, it requires a sheltered spot in full sun. The dwarf cultivar &quot;A. balsamea&quot; &#x27;Hudson&#x27; (Hudson fir), grows to only tall by broad, and has distinctive blue-green foliage with pale undersides. It does not bear cones. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Other uses ==

The resin is used to produce Canada balsam, and was traditionally used as a cold remedy and as a glue for glasses, optical instrument components, and for preparing permanent mounts of microscope specimens. Given its use as a traditional remedy and the relatively high ascorbic acid content of its needles, historian Jacques Mathieu has argued that the balsam fir was the &quot;aneda&quot; that cured scurvy during the second expedition into Canada of Jacques Cartier. The wood is milled for framing lumber (part of SPF lumber), siding and pulped for paper manufacture. Balsam fir oil is an EPA approved nontoxic rodent repellent. The balsam fir is also used as an air freshener and as incense.

Prior to the availability of foam rubber and air mattresses, balsam fir boughs were a preferred mattress in places where trees greatly outnumbered campers. Many fir limbs are vertically bowed from alternating periods of downward deformation from snow loading and new growth reaching upward for sunlight. Layers of inverted freshly cut limbs from small trees created a pleasantly fragrant mattress lifting bedding off the wet ground; and the bowed green limbs were springs beneath the soft needles. Upper layers of limbs were placed with the cut ends of the limbs touching the earth to avoid uncomfortably sharp spots and sap.

===Native American ethnobotany===
Native Americans use it for a variety of medicinal purposes.

The Abenaki use the gum for slight itches and as an antiseptic ointment. They stuff the leaves, needles, and wood into pillows as a panacea.

The Algonquin people of Quebec apply a poultice of the gum to open sores, insect bites, boils and infections, use the needles as a sudatory for women after childbirth and for other purposes, use the roots for heart disease, use the needles to make a laxative tea, and use the needles for making poultices.

The Atikamekw chew the sap as a cold remedy, and use the boughs as mats for the tent floor.

The Cree use the pitch for menstrual irregularity, and take an infusion of the bark and sometimes the wood for coughs. They use the pitch and grease used as an ointment for scabies and boils. They apply a poultice of pitch applied to cuts. They also use a decoction of pitch and sturgeon oil used for tuberculosis, and take an infusion of bark for tuberculosis. They also use the boughs to make brush shelters and use the wood to make paddles.

The Innu people grate the inner bark and eat it to benefit their diet.

The Iroquois use a steam from a decoction of branches as a bath for rheumatism and parturition, and ingest a decoction of the plant for rheumatism. They take a compound decoction for colds and coughs, sometimes mixing it with alcohol. They apply a compound decoction of the plant for cuts, sprains, bruises and sores. They apply a poultice of the gum and dried beaver kidneys for cancer. They also take a compound decoction in the early stages of tuberculosis, and they use the plant for bedwetting and gonorrhea.

The Maliseet use the juice of the plant as a laxative, use the pitch in medicines, and use an infusion of the bark, sometimes mixed with spruce and tamarack bark, for gonorrhea. They use the needles and branches as pillows and bedding, the roots as thread, and use the pitch to waterproof seams in canoes.

The Menominee use the inner bark as a seasoner for medicines, take an infusion of the inner bark for chest pain, and use the liquid balsam pressed from the trunk for colds and pulmonary troubles. They also use the inner bark as a poultice for unspecified illnesses. They also apply gum from plant blisters to sores.

The Miꞌkmaq use a poultice of inner bark for an unspecified purpose, use the buds, cones and inner bark for diarrhea, use the gum for burns, colds, fractures, sores and wounds, use the cones for colic, and use the buds as a laxative. They also use the bark used for gonorrhea and buds used as a laxative. They use the boughs to make beds, use the bark to make a beverage, and use the wood for kindling and fuel.

The Ojibwe melt the gum on warm stones and inhale the fumes for headache. They also use a decoction of the root as an herbal steam for rheumatic joints. They also combine the gum with bear&#x27;s grease and use it as an ointment for hair. They use the needle-like leaves in as part of ceremony involving the sweat bath, and use the gum for colds and inhale the leaf smoke for colds. They use the plant as a cough medicine. The gum is used for sores and a compound containing leaves is used as wash. The liquid balsam from bark blisters is used for sore eyes. They boil the resin twice and add it to suet or fat to make a canoe pitch. The bark gum is taken for chest soreness from colds, applied to cuts and sores, and decoction of the bark is used to induce sweating. The bark gum is also taken for gonorrhea.

The Penobscot smear the sap over sores, burns, and cuts.

The Potawatomi use the needles to make pillows, believing that the aroma prevented one from getting a cold. They also use the balsam gum as a salve for sores, and take an infusion of the bark for tuberculosis and other internal afflictions.

<doc id="600846" wikidata="Q753064" url="?curid=600846" title="Mill Ends Park">
<text>Mill Ends Park (sometimes mistakenly called Mill&#x27;s End Park) is an extremely small urban park, consisting of one tree, located in the median strip of SW Naito Parkway next to Tom McCall Waterfront Park along the Willamette River near SW Taylor Street in the downtown core of Portland, Oregon, United States. The park is a small circle across, with a total area of . It was the smallest park in the world, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, which first granted it this recognition in 1971, though the title have been given to a park in Japan, dubbed &#x27;,&#x27; which is .

==History==

In 1948 the site that would become Mill Ends Park was intended to be the site for a light pole. When the pole failed to appear and weeds sprouted in the opening, Dick Fagan, a columnist for &quot;The Oregon Journal&quot;, planted flowers in the hole and named it after his column in the paper, &quot;Mill Ends&quot; (a reference to leftover irregular pieces of wood at lumber mills). Fagan&#x27;s office in the &quot;Journal&quot; building overlooked the median in the middle of the busy thoroughfare that ran in front of the building (then known as SW Front Avenue).

The park was dedicated on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, 1976, as &quot;the only leprechaun colony west of Ireland,&quot; according to Fagan.

===Legend===
Fagan told this story of the park&#x27;s origin: He looked out the window and spotted a leprechaun digging in the hole. He ran down and grabbed the leprechaun, which meant that he had earned a wish. Fagan said he wished for a park of his own, but since he had not specified the size of the park in his wish, the leprechaun gave him the hole. Over the next two decades, Fagan often featured the park and its head leprechaun in his whimsical column. Fagan claimed to be the only person who could see the head leprechaun, Patrick O&#x27;Toole.

Fagan published a threat by O&#x27;Toole about the 11 o&#x27;clock curfew set on all city parks. O&#x27;Toole dared the mayor to try to evict him and his followers from Mill Ends and threatened a leprechaun curse on him should he attempt to do so. Subsequently, no legal action was taken, and the leprechauns were allowed to stay in the park after hours.

According to legend, the leprechauns at Mill Ends Park are only visible to humans at midnight during a full moon on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day -- and even then, only to children bearing four-leaf clovers as gifts. The next St. Patrick&#x27;s Day full moon is March 17, 2041.

===Evolution===
Fagan died of cancer in 1969, but the park lives on, cared for by others. It was named an official city park in 1976.

The small circle has featured many unusual items through the decades, including a swimming pool for butterflies—complete with diving board—a horseshoe, a fragment of the Journal building, and a miniature Ferris wheel, which was delivered by a full-size crane.
On St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, 2001, the park was visited by a tiny leprechaun leaning against his pot of gold and children&#x27;s drawings of four-leaf clovers and leprechauns. The park continues to be the site of St. Patrick&#x27;s Day festivities. The events held here include concerts by Clan Macleay Pipe Band, picnics, and rose plantings by the Junior Rose Festival Court.
In February 2006, the park was temporarily relocated during road construction to a planter outside the World Trade Center Portland, about from its permanent location. It was returned to its home—now named SW Naito Parkway—on March 16, 2007, in true St. Patrick&#x27;s Day style with the Royal Rosarians, bagpipers, and the Fagan family, including Dick&#x27;s widow, Katherine, in attendance. The legend lives on in the Fagan family. One of Fagan&#x27;s sons, Pat Fagan, lives in Gladstone and has enjoyed sharing the park with his own son. &quot;He loves it,&quot; Pat Fagan said. &quot;It&#x27;s still the largest leprechaun colony west of Ireland.&quot;
In December 2011, plastic army men figures and small signs were placed in Mill Ends as a tongue-in-cheek flash mob demonstration for Occupy Portland. One man, Cameron Scott Whitten, was arrested after he was asked by police to move from the sidewalk and refused.

In March 2013, the park&#x27;s tree was stolen. Officials planted a replacement tree, and one day later, a passerby found what appeared to be the stolen tree lying next to the new one.

The next month, officials from Burntwood, England, complained to Guinness, claiming that Mill Ends was not large enough to be a park and that Prince&#x27;s Park, smallest in the UK, should hold the world record since it &quot;has a fence around it&quot; among other features. In response, volunteers erected a fence (several inches tall) around and stationed an &quot;armed guard&quot; in the park.

In 2018, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation installed a miniaturized park sign and planted miniature roses.

In December 2019, the tree was cut down by an unknown vandal. However, the tree was soon replaced.

As of July 2021, the park was &quot;temporarily under construction as part of PBOT&#x27;s Better Naito Forever.&quot;

Construction was completed in January 2022, including a new sign. The park had moved six inches from its previous location during improvements along the Naito Parkway.

The park&#x27;s sole tree went absent during the January 13–16, 2024 North American winter storm, a time when storms felled many trees in Portland. KGW noted that the $29 replacement cost of the tree was up from the $3-5 tree replacement estimate in 2019.

<doc id="600848" wikidata="Q3183526" url="?curid=600848" title="Bilad al-Sham">
<text>Bilad al-Sham (), often referred to as Islamic Syria or simply Syria in English-language sources, was a province of the Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, and Fatimid caliphates. It roughly corresponded with the Byzantine Diocese of the East, conquered by the Muslims in 634–647. Under the Umayyads (661–750), Bilad al-Sham was the metropolitan province of the Caliphate and different localities throughout the province served as the seats of the Umayyad caliphs and princes. 

Bilad al-Sham was first organized into the four &quot;ajnad&quot; (military districts; singular &quot;jund&quot;) of Dimashq (Damascus), Hims (Homs), al-Urdunn (Jordan), and Filastin (Palestine), between 637 and 640 by Caliph Umar following the Muslim conquest. The &quot;jund&quot; of Qinnasrin was created out of the northern part of Hims by caliphs Mu&#x27;awiya I () or Yazid I (). The Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) was made an independent province from the Mesopotamian part of Qinnasrin by Caliph Abd al-Malik in 692. In 786, the &quot;jund&quot; of al-Awasim and al-Thughur were established from the northern frontier region of Qinnasrin by Caliph Harun al-Rashid. As centralized Abbasid rule over Bilad al-Sham collapsed in the 10th century, control over the region was divided by several potentates and the &quot;ajnad&quot; only represented nominal divisions. The Abbasids and the Egypt-based Fatimid Caliphate continued to officially recognize the province and its &quot;ajnad&quot; until the Crusader invasions of the coastal regions in 1099.

==Name==
The name &quot;Bilad al-Sham&quot; in Arabic translates as &quot;the left-hand region&quot;. It was so named from the perspective of the people of the Hejaz (western Arabia), who considered themselves to be facing the rising sun, that the Syrian region was positioned to their left, while to their right was &quot;al-Yaman&quot; (&quot;the right-hand-region&quot;). 

==Geography==
Bilad al-Sham comprised the area of the region of Syria, spanning the modern countries of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine, as well as the regions of Hatay, Gaziantep, and Diyarbakir in modern Turkey. It was bound by the Mediterranean Sea in the west and the Syrian Desert in the east toward Iraq. The western, Mediterranean coastal range were characterized by rolling hills in Palestine in the south, rising to their highest points in Mount Lebanon in the center before becoming considerably lower in the Jabal Ansariya range in the north. Eastward from the coastal range, the ridges of inland Syria become gradually lower, with the exception of Mount Hermon north of the Golan, and include the ranges of the Anti-Lebanon, Jabal al-Ruwaq, and Jabal Bishri. With the termination of the inland ridges begins the mostly level Syrian steppe.

==History==
===Muslim conquest===
Following the consolidation of Islamic hegemony over Arabia and its nomadic Arab tribes in the Ridda wars of 632–633, the caliph (leader of the Muslim community) Abu Bakr () turned the nascent Muslim state&#x27;s goals toward the conquest of Syria. The conquest unfolded in three main phases, according to the historian Fred Donner. In the first phase, Abu Bakr dispatched four armies from Medina in late 633 led by the commanders Amr ibn al-As, Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan, Shurahbil ibn Hasana, all veterans of the Ridda wars, and Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah, a leading companion of Muhammad. Abu Ubayda may not have been dispatched until 636. Each commander was assigned to a different zone, with Amr entrusted over Palestine, Yazid to the Balqa (central Transjordan), Shurahbil to southern Transjordan, and Abu Ubayda to the Ghassanid stomping grounds of the Golan Heights. The Muslim commanders mainly engaged in small-scale skirmishes in the southern Syrian countryside with local garrisons. The goal of the Muslims at the start of the conquest was likely bringing the Arabic-speaking nomadic, semi-nomadic, and settled tribesmen of the southern Syrian desert fringes under their control.

The second phase began with the arrival of Khalid ibn al-Walid and his troops to Syria in 634. Under Khalid&#x27;s supreme command, the Muslim armies besieged and captured the southern Syrian urban centers of Bosra, Damascus, Beisan (Scythopolis), Pella, Gaza, and temporarily, Homs (Emesa) and Baalbek (Hierapolis). Heraclius responded by deploying successive imperial armies against the Muslims. The Byzantines were decisively defeated in the resulting major battles of Ajnadayn in Palestine and Fahl and Yarmouk in Transjordan, all occurring in 634–636. The Muslim battlefield victories effectively ended organized resistance by the Byzantines.

In the third phase, beginning about 637, the Muslim armies quickly occupied the northern Syrian countryside, while steadily conquering individual towns throughout the region whose garrisons held out alone following the breakdown of the imperial defense. Among the towns, a number of which held out until 637 or 638, were Aleppo (Beroea) and Qinnasrin (Chalcis) in the north, Hama, Homs and Baalbek (the latter two possibly for the second time), Damascus possibly for the second time, Jerusalem. Within the next few years, the Mediterranean coastal towns of Beirut, Sidon, Tyre, Caesarea, Antioch, Tripoli and Ascalon were captured by Muslim forces.

===Governorship of Mu&#x27;awiya===
Umar has appointed Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah commander of the Muslim troops in Syria in and governor of the conquered region. He died in the plague of Amwas, which devastated the Muslims at their camp near Jerusalem and caused significant loss of life throughout Syria. Umar replaced him with Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan in the southern districts of Syria and Iyad ibn Ghanm in the northern districts. Yazid died from the plague soon after and was replaced by his brother Mu&#x27;awiya. Umar&#x27;s successor, Caliph Uthman (), gradually expanded Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s governorship to span all of Syria.

As governor, Mu&#x27;awiya, forged strong ties with the old-established Arab tribes of Syria, which, by dint of their long service under the Byzantines, were more politically experienced than the tribesmen of Arabia, who filled the ranks of the Muslim armies. Among the Syrian tribes, the powerful Banu Kalb and their Quda&#x27;a confederacy gained the preeminent position in Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s government. He also accommodated Arab newcomers, most prominently the Kinda of South Arabia. The tribes and commanders of Syria backed Mu&#x27;awiya in his confrontation with Caliph Ali at the Battle of Siffin in 657, which ended in a stalemate and an agreement to arbitrate their dispute. The arbitration talks collapsed and Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s Syrian supporters recognized him as caliph in a ceremony in Jerusalem in 660. Ali was murdered the following year, paving the way for Mu&#x27;awiya to gain control of the rest of the Caliphate.

===Umayyad period===
Syria became the metropolitan province of the Umayyad Caliphate which Mu&#x27;awiya founded and whose capital was at Damascus. Syria&#x27;s history under Umayyad rule was &quot;essentially the history of the Umayyad dynasty&quot;, according to the historians Henri Lammens and Clifford Edmund Bosworth. Mu&#x27;awiya had his son Yazid I, the son of a Kalbi woman, recognized as his successor. Yazid I () was opposed by the people of the Hejaz, whose revolt against him was crushed by Syria&#x27;s troops at the Battle of al-Harra. The Syrians proceeded to besiege Mecca in 683, but withdrew to Syria after Yazid I died. The Meccan leader of the revolt, Ibn al-Zubayr, was recognized as caliph across much of the Muslim empire, while Yazid I&#x27;s son and successor, Mu&#x27;awiya II, succumbed to the plague.

The Kalb and other loyalist tribes elected another Umayyad, Marwan I, as caliph and he moved to secure the dynasty&#x27;s Syrian heartland. With these tribes&#x27; support, he defeated the Qays tribes and other supporters of Ibn al-Zubayr at the Battle of Marj Rahit, north of Damascus, in 684. Under his son and successor, Abd al-Malik (), Syrian troops reconquered the rest of the Caliphate and killed Ibn al-Zubayr in a second siege of Mecca. A standing army composed of the Syrian tribal soldiery was established under this caliph and his sons and successors. Abd al-Malik inaugurated a more Arab–Islamic government in Syria by changing the language of its bureaucracy from Greek to Arabic, switching from Byzantine coinage to a strictly Islamic currency, and building the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, which he may have promoted as an additional center of Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.

Abd al-Malik&#x27;s son and successor, al-Walid I (), ruled with autocratic tendencies and less tolerance for the non-Muslims in Syria and the empire in general, which reached its greatest territorial extent during his reign. He largely demolished the Christian basilica of St. John in Damascus and built in its place the landmark Great Umayyad Mosque. He achieved great popularity among the Syrian Arabs. During his rule and that of his successors, Damascus retained its role as the administrative capital of the empire, but the caliphs increasingly resided in their country estates in the Syrian steppe.

After a period of stagnation, the caliph Hisham () restored the prestige of Umayyad Caliphate through his administrative reforms, state-building and austerity, though the conquests ground to a halt. His successor, al-Walid II, was assassinated, sparking the Third Muslim Civil War. His successor Yazid III died after a few months, followed by the weak rule of Ibrahim. Marwan II took control of the caliphate, crushed his Syrian tribal opponents, and shifted the capital to Harran, outside of Syria, which increased Syrian opposition to his rule.

===Post-Umayyad period===
Al-Sham became much less important under the Abbasid Caliphate, which succeeded the Umayyads in 750. The Abbasids moved the capital first to Kufa, and then to Baghdad and Samarra, all of which were in Iraq, which consequently became their most important province. The mainly Arab Syrians were marginalized by Iranian and Turkish forces who rose to power under the Abbasids, a trend which also expressed itself on a cultural level. From 878 until 905, Syria came under the effective control of the Tulunids of Egypt, but Abbasid control was re-established soon thereafter. It lasted until the 940s, when the province was partitioned between the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo in the north and Ikhshidid-controlled Egypt in the south. In the 960s the Byzantine Empire under Nikephoros II Phokas conquered much of northern Syria, and Aleppo became a Byzantine tributary, while the southern provinces passed to the Fatimid Caliphate after its conquest of Egypt in 969. The division of Syria into northern and southern parts would persist, despite political changes, until the Mamluk conquest in the late 13th century.

==Administrative history==
===Roman–Byzantine precursors===

The &quot;ajnad&quot; were an adaptation of the preexisting administrative system of the Diocese of the East (Byzantine Syria) to suit the nascent Muslim state&#x27;s needs. The Byzantine system, in turn, had been based on that instituted by its Roman predecessor in the aftermath of the First Jewish Revolt in 70 CE and the Bar Kokhba Revolt in 135 CE. To establish closer control over the broadly spread population of Syria following the revolts, the region was subdivided into smaller units centered around an urban center which policed and collected taxes from the surrounding hinterland. By 400 the southern half of Syria was divided between the three Palestines (Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda, and Palaestina Tertia), Phoenice and Arabia.

===Beginnings of Islamic administration===
Following the decisive Muslim victory at Yarmouk in 636, and the occupation of most of the Mediterranean coast and northern Syria in the next two years, the Muslims began to militarily and administratively organize the region for their needs. Caliph Umar, who ruled from Medina, visited the Muslim army&#x27;s principal camp at Jabiya, the former Ghassanid capital, at least once between 637 and 639. From there he personally oversaw the distribution of allowances (&quot;ata&quot;) and rations (&quot;rizq&quot;) to the Muslim soldiery, tax collection from the conquered population, and the appointments to military command. There may have been initial Muslim intentions to establish Jabiya as the permanent, central garrison town of Syria along the lines of those later established in the conquered regions of Iraq (Kufa and Basra), Egypt (Fustat), and Ifriqiya (Kairouan). Those garrison cities developed into major urban centers of the Caliphate. During one of his visits, or by 640 at the latest, the central army camp at Jabiya was disbanded by Umar. Instead, as a result of several factors, &quot;a self-supporting, more flexible&quot; military-administrative system was established, according to the historian Alan Walmsley. 

Unlike Iraq and Egypt where settlement was concentrated along the major rivers of those provinces, Syrian settlement was distributed over an extensive area of mountains, valleys, and plains. The complex geography slowed communications and army movements in the region, necessitating multiple regional centers for efficient administration and defense; according to Walmsley, this was &quot;a principle confirmed by over 500 years of Roman and Byzantine administration&quot;. The change of Muslim military objectives following Yarmouk, when focus shifted to the northern Syrian and Mediterranean fronts, also necessitated the establishment of additional army headquarters and garrisons, such as Homs, diminishing Jabiya&#x27;s centrality. Further reducing troop numbers in Jabiya was the Plague of Amwas in 639, which reduced the garrison there from 24,000 to 4,000. The decrease was likely due to factors in addition to the plague. In late 639 or early 640, a significant number of Muslim troops also left Syria for the conquest of Egypt under Amr&#x27;s command.

Troop numbers in Jabiya could not be restored in the aftermath of the plague and the departure of Muslim troops to other fronts. Unlike in Iraq where there were high levels of Arab tribal immigration, similar immigration into Syria was restricted by the Qurayshite elite in a bid to preserve their pre-established interests in the region. Syria had a substantial, long-standing Arab population, both in the tribes who dominated the steppe and formerly served Byzantium and in the urban Arab communities, particularly those of Damascus and Homs. Not long after Yarmouk, the Arab tribes of Syria were incorporated into the nascent Muslim military structure there. The native tribes had a preference for the established urban centers with which they were long familiarized. Muslim settlement in the urban centers was facilitated by the wide availability of property in the cities in the wake of the conquests, as a result of the exodus of pro-Byzantine, Greek-speaking residents or in property transfers to the Muslims secured in capitulation agreements. Muslim settlement in the hinterland, on the other hand, was limited as the Aramaic-speaking peasantry remained in their villages.

===The &quot;jund&quot; divisions===

Umar divided Syria into the four &quot;ajnad&quot; of Filastin, al-Urdunn, Dimashq, and Hims. The new garrisons were assigned to the urban centers of Lydda, Tiberias, Damascus, and Homs, respectively. In effect, Umar gave his sanction of the existing military situation in Syria, where different army units operated independently on the different fronts. By establishing the &quot;ajnad&quot;, Umar transformed the military structures into provincial governments concerned with the taxation of the local populations and the distribution of collected money and supplies for the troops. During the caliphate of Umar&#x27;s successor Uthman (), supplemental garrisons were established in the respective &quot;ajnad&quot;, especially in the coastal cities. 

During the reign of Mu&#x27;awiya I or Yazid I, Qinnasrin (northern Syria) and the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) were separated from Jund Hims and became Jund Qinnasrin. The separation may have been a response to the influx of northern Arab (Qays and Mudar) immigrant tribesmen to Qinnasrin and the Jazira during Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s governorship and caliphate. In 692 Caliph Abd al-Malik separated the Jazira from Jund Qinnasrin, and it became the independent province of the Jazira. According to Blankinship, this change of status may have been related to the peace settlement reached with the Qays in 691 after the Qays had rebelled against the Umayyads during the Second Muslim Civil War. According to the historian Hugh N. Kennedy, the separation was done at the request of Muhammad ibn Marwan, Abd al-Malik&#x27;s brother and his commander responsible for the Jazira.

In 786 Caliph Harun al-Rashid established Jund al-Awasim out of the northern part of Jund Qinnasrin. It spanned the frontier zone with the Byzantine Empire, extending from the areas immediately south of Antioch, Aleppo, and Manbij and eastward to the Euphrates. Manbij and later Antioch became the capitals of the new &quot;jund&quot;. Jund al-Awasim served as the second defensive line behind the actual frontier zone, the Thughur, which encompassed the far northern Syrian towns of Baghras, Bayas, Duluk, Alexandretta, Cyrrhus, Ra&#x27;ban and Tizin. The Thughur was subdivided into the Cilician or Syrian &quot;al-Thughur al-Sha&#x27;miya&quot; and the Jaziran or Mesopotamian &quot;al-Thughur al-Jaziriya&quot; sectors, roughly separated by the Amanus mountains. Tarsus and Malatya were the most important towns in the Syrian and the Mesopotamian sectors respectively, though the two districts did not have administrative capitals sometimes were under the administrative control of Jund al-Awasim. By the 10th century, the terms &quot;Thughur&quot; and &quot;al-Awasim&quot; were often used interchangeably in the sources.

The governor of the provinces were called or .

* Jund Dimashq (, &quot;military district of Damascus&quot;), with its capital at Damascus, was the largest of the provinces and encompassed much of present-day Lebanon and territories east of the Jordan River known as the al-Balqa region. 
* Jund Filastin (, &quot;military district of Palestine&quot;) stretched from Aqaba on the Red Sea and al-&#x27;Arish in the Sinai in the south to the lower Galilee in the north, encompassing most of the territory of the Byzantine provinces of Palaestina Prima and Palaestina Tertia. The Tulunids expanded the province eastwards and southwards, at the expense of Jund Dimasq, to include regions in modern-day southern Jordan and north-western Saudi Arabia. Ramla was founded in 715 and became both the administrative capital and most important city in Palestine.
* Jund al-Urdunn (, &quot;military district of the Jordan&quot;) corresponded with Palaestina Secunda and covered most of the Galilee and the western part of Peraea in Transjordan. It also included the cities Acre and Tyre on the coast. Tabariyyah (Tiberias) replaced Scythopolis as the new capital of the province.
* Jund Hims (, &quot;military district of Homs&quot;), with its capital at Homs.
* Jund Qinnasrin (, &quot;military district of Qinnasrin&quot;), with its capital at Qinnasrin, was carved out of the northern part of Jund Hims.

===Post-Abbasid rule===
As direct Abbasid rule over the Levant faltered and eventually collapsed in the 10th century, different parts of the region were controlled by several different rulerships. The &quot;ajnad&quot; became nominal divisions with no practical relevance. The administrative system continued to be officially recognized by the Abbasid and Fatimid governments until the Crusader conquests of the western parts of Bilad al-Sham, beginning in 1099. As a geographic expression, &quot;Bilad al-Sham&quot; continued to be used by Arabic-speaking Muslims into the late 19th century, when &quot;Suriyya&quot;, the Arabic word for &quot;Syria&quot;, generally replaced the term in common usage. Leading up to that point, &quot;Suriyya&quot; had been increasingly used in 19th-century Arabic Christian literature and among Europeans.

<doc id="600858" wikidata="Q981328" url="?curid=600858" title="William Wilfred Sullivan">
<text>Sir William Wilfred Sullivan (December 6, 1839 – September 30, 1920) was a Prince Edward Island journalist, politician and jurist, the fourth premier of Prince Edward Island.

A native of Hope River, Sullivan had a career as an assistant editor at the &quot;Charlottetown Herald&quot; as well as a lawyer before being elected to the provincial legislature in 1872 as a Liberal MLA.

A staunch Catholic, Sullivan became leader of the opposition in 1877 to the Protestant coalition government of Louis Henry Davies which had been formed to implement a public, secular school system that denied funding to Roman Catholic separate schools. Sullivan reorganised the Conservative Party and was asked by the lieutenant governor to become premier once Davies&#x27; coalition broke up and became unable to command a majority in the assembly.

Sullivan served as premier for ten years and fought for PEI&#x27;s rights in Canada. He protested the federal government&#x27;s failure to fulfill the terms of confederation on which the island had joined the dominion in 1873. In 1886, he petitioned the Imperial government in London protesting Canada&#x27;s delinquency in respect to promises to ensure communication lines between the island and the rest of the country but the problem remained unresolved until the 1900s.

In 1889, Sullivan was appointed Chief Justice of PEI and served in that position until his retirement in 1917. In 1914 he was made a Knight Bachelor by King George V.

<doc id="600865" wikidata="Q1607335" url="?curid=600865" title="Mitsuru Matsui">
<text>is a Japanese cryptographer and senior researcher for Mitsubishi Electric Company.

==Career==
While researching error-correcting codes in 1990, Matsui was inspired by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir&#x27;s differential cryptanalysis, and discovered the technique of linear cryptanalysis, published in 1993. Differential and linear cryptanalysis are the two major general techniques known for the cryptanalysis of block ciphers.

The following year, Matsui was the first to publicly report an experimental cryptanalysis of DES, using the computing power of twelve workstations over a period of fifty days.

He is also the author of the MISTY-1 and MISTY-2 block ciphers, and contributed to the design of Camellia and KASUMI.

For his achievements, Matsui got the 2012 RSA Conference Award for Excellence in Mathematics.

<doc id="600872" wikidata="Q72283" url="?curid=600872" title="Ludwig Fulda">
<text>Ludwig Anton Salomon Fulda (July 7, 1862 – March 7, 1939) was a German playwright and poet, with a strong social commitment. He lived with Moritz Moszkowski&#x27;s first wife Henriette, née Chaminade, younger sister of pianist and composer Cécile Chaminade.

==Biography==
He was born in the Free City of Frankfurt. He was a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts and the first president of the PEN of Germany (1925–1932). He visited the United States in 1906 on the invitation of the Germanistic Society.

A Jew, he was removed from his work by the Nazis in 1933. Fulda committed suicide in Berlin in 1939 when he was denied entry into the United States.

==Works==
Fulda&#x27;s creations used the relationships of his characters to develop the social and political issues of his time. Fulda&#x27;s works include &quot;Das verlorene Paradies&quot; (1892; translated as &quot;The Lost Paradise&quot;, 1897), &quot;Der Talisman&quot; (1892), &quot;Jugendfreunde&quot; (1897) and &quot;Maskerade&quot; (1904). His novel &quot;Der Seeräuber&quot; was later freely adapted into the play &quot;The Pirate&quot; by S. N. Behrman. Fulda&#x27;s 1901 play, &quot;Die Zwillingsschwester&quot; was adapted into the screenplay by Behrman and Salka Viertel of the American motion picture &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; (1941) starring Greta Garbo. Inspired by the story of Aladdin, he wrote &quot;Aladdin und die Wunderlampe&quot;. He also made numerous translations.

&quot;Jugendfreunde&quot; was adapted in the United States into the 1912 play &quot;Our Wives&quot; by Helen Craft/Kraft and Frank Mandel. That play was adapted into the musical comedy &quot;The Only Girl&quot; by Victor Herbert.

<text>The Georgia Board of Regents oversees the University System of Georgia as part of the state government of Georgia in the United States. The University System of Georgia is composed of all state public institutions of higher education in the state. The Board of Regents also preside over the Georgia Public Library Service.

==History==
The Board was organized on January 1, 1932, to create centralized control over all member institutions. The Board marked the first period that public institutions of higher education were governed and managed under a sole authority. The governor appoints members of the Board, each of whom serve seven years. Today the Board of Regents is composed of 19 members, five of whom are appointed from the state-at-large, and one from each of the state’s 14 congressional districts. The Board elects a chancellor who serves as its chief executive officer and the chief administrative officer of the University System.

==Governing authority==
The Board oversees 26 institutions of higher education: four research universities, four comprehensive universities, 9 state universities, and 9 state colleges. Those numbers grew to 35,000 and 253,000, respectively, in 2006.

Public funding for member institutions is distributed by the Board. In fiscal year 2003, the Board dispensed $1,697,287,628 of funding, authorized by the Georgia General Assembly. In 2006, the budget grew to $5 billion.

==Organization==
The Board consists of 19 voting members, serving seven-year terms. The Governor appoints, subject to Senate confirmation, one from each Congressional district and five at-large members.

The Board appoints a chief executive for the system, known as a chancellor. Former Georgia Governor and United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue became the 14th Chancellor in 2022.

Previous chancellors include Charles Mercer Snelling (1932–1933), Steadman Vincent Sanford (1935-1945), Harmon White Caldwell (1948-1964), Erroll B. Davis Jr. (2006-2011), and Hank Huckaby (2011-2017).

Each individual institution has its own President and senior staff. The system of 26 colleges and universities includes the University of Georgia, the state&#x27;s flagship land-grant, sea-grant, space-grant, and sun-grant research university, Fort Valley State University, a historically black land-grant university, Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, which specializes in coastal and marine environments and became part of the University of Georgia in 2013, the Georgia Institute of Technology, which has a strong emphasis in technology and engineering, Augusta University that includes the Medical College of Georgia, and the Georgia Public Library Service, which distributes state funding to 385 libraries in the state&#x27;s 61 public library systems.

In 2024, Brian Kemp appointed David B. Dove, Dan Murphy, and Deep J. Shah to the board; Sarah-Elizabeth Langford and Jose R. Perez were appointed to the Georgia Board of Economic Development. Simultaneously, Smith was moved from an at-large district to the fifth district; Bradbury was moved from the eleventh to the sixth; and Evans from the sixth to the seventh.

<doc id="600882" wikidata="Q2701573" url="?curid=600882" title="Vitis rotundifolia">
<text>Vitis rotundifolia, or muscadine, is a grapevine species native to the southeastern and south-central United States. The growth range extends from Florida to New Jersey coast, and west to eastern Texas and Oklahoma. It has been extensively cultivated since the 16th century. The plants are well-adapted to their native warm and humid climate; they need fewer chilling hours than better known varieties, and thrive in summer heat.

Muscadine berries may be bronze or dark purple or black when ripe. Wild varieties may stay green through maturity. Muscadines are typically used in making artisan wines, juice, hull pie and jelly. They are rich sources of polyphenols.

In a natural setting, muscadine provides wildlife habitat as shelter, browse, and food for many birds and animals. It is also a larval host for the Nessus Sphinx Moth (&quot;Amphion floridensis&quot;) and the Mournful Sphinx Moth (&quot;Enyo lugubris&quot;).

==Taxonomy and pathology==
Although in the same genus &quot;Vitis&quot; with the other grapevine species, the muscadine species belongs to a separate subgenus, &quot;Muscadinia&quot; (all other grapevine species belong to subgenus &quot;Euvitis&quot;).
Usually the species is divided into three varieties, &quot;Vitis rotundifolia&quot; Michx. var. &quot;rotundifolia&quot; (southeast USA), &quot;Vitis rotundifolia&quot; Michx. var. &quot;munsoniana&quot; (Florida), and &quot;Vitis rotundifolia&quot; Michx. var. &quot;popenoei&quot; (Central America). Some taxonomists have suggested giving the muscadines standing as a separate genus. It has also been suggested that the muscadine varieties be upgraded to species rank and so splitting off &quot;Vitis munsoniana&quot; and &quot;Vitis popenoei&quot; from &quot;Vitis rotundifolia&quot;. All muscadines have 40 chromosomes, rather than 38. They are generally not cross-compatible with &quot;Euvitis&quot; subgenus, and most hybrids between the subgenera. A few are moderately fertile, and have been used in breeding. A commercially available &quot;Euvitis&quot; × &quot;Muscadinia&quot; hybrid is the &quot;Southern Home&quot; cultivar.

Muscadines are hearty grapes with thick and tough skin that protects them from many plant diseases. These grapes nonetheless appear to be susceptible to parasitic nematodes. Some other pests that can be found on the Muscadines are grapevine aphids and grape root borers. However, according to Oscar Liburd, a professor at the University of Florida, pests attacks on the muscadines are not significant.

==Cultivars==

There are about 152 muscadine cultivars grown in the Southern states. These include bronze, black and red varieties and consist of common grapes and patented grapes.

Unlike most cultivated grapevines, many muscadine cultivars are pistillate, requiring a pollenizer to set fruit. A few, such as &#x27;Carlos&#x27; and &#x27;Noble&#x27;, are perfect-flowered, produce fruit with their own pollen, and may also pollinate pistillate cultivars.

Muscadine grape cultivars may have low or inconsistent yields, small berries, flavor and thick skin unsuitable to consumer acceptance, and disease susceptibility. Cultivars tend to be developed either for a limited fresh market or for winemaking. For consumer acceptance, fresh market grapes need to be large, sweet, and with relatively thin skin, whereas those for wine, juice or jelly need high yields of high-sugar, color-stable berries.

Fresh-market cultivars include Black Beauty, Carlos, Cowart, Flowers, Fry, Granny Val, Ison, James, Jumbo, Magnolia, Memory (first found on T.S. Memory&#x27;s farm in 1868 in Whiteville, NC), Mish, Nesbitt, Noble, Scuppernong, Summit, Supreme, and Thomas. Produced by the University of Florida, the cultivar, &#x27;Southern Home&#x27;, contains both subgenera &quot;Muscadinia&quot; and &quot;Euvitis&quot; (more precisely, &quot;V. rotundifolia&quot; × &quot;V. vinifera&quot;) in its background.

Crops can be started in 3–5 years. Commercial yields of 20–45 tonnes per hectare (8–18 tons per acre) are possible. Muscadines grow best in fertile sandy loam and alluvial soils. They grow wild in well-drained bottom lands that are not subject to extended drought or waterlogging. They are also resistant to pests and diseases, including Pierce&#x27;s disease, which can destroy other grape species. Muscadine is one of the grape species most resistant to &quot;Phylloxera&quot;, an insect that can kill roots of grapevines.

===Appellations===
Appellations producing Muscadine wines:
* America (Country Appellation)
* Alabama (State Appellation)
* Arkansas (State Appellation)
* Florida (State Appellation)
* Georgia (State Appellation)
* Louisiana (State Appellation)
* Mississippi (State Appellation)
* North Carolina (State Appellation)
* South Carolina (State Appellation)
* Tennessee (State Appellation)
* Texas (State Appellation)

==Nutrients==
100 grams of muscadine grapes contain the following nutrients according to the USDA:
* Energy: 57 kilocalories
* Fats: 0.47 g
* Carbohydrates: 13.93 g
* Dietary Fiber: 3.9 g
* Protein: 0.81 g
* Calcium: 37 mg
* Phosphorus: 24 mg
* Potassium: 203 mg
* Sodium: 1 mg
* Vitamin C (total ascorbic acid): 6.5 mg
* Riboflavin: 1.5 mg

==Consumer research==
Consumer research indicates that the thick skins and variable in-season quality of fresh muscadine grapes are significant deterrents to retail acceptance.

==Resveratrol and other polyphenols==

One report indicated that muscadine grapes contained high concentrations of resveratrol, but subsequent studies have found no or little resveratrol in muscadine grapes.

Other muscadine polyphenols include anthocyanins, tannins, and various flavonoids.

The rank order of total phenolic content among muscadine components was found to be seeds, higher than skins, higher than leaves, higher than pulp.

<doc id="600883" wikidata="Q315347" url="?curid=600883" title="Peter Lombard">
<text>Peter Lombard (also Peter the Lombard, Pierre Lombard or Petrus Lombardus; 1096 – 21/22 August 1160) was an Italian scholastic theologian, Bishop of Paris, and author of &quot;Four Books of Sentences&quot; which became the standard textbook of theology, for which he earned the accolade &quot;Magister Sententiarum&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Peter Lombard was born in Lumellogno (then a rural commune, now a &quot;quartiere&quot; of Novara, Piedmont), in northwestern Italy, to a poor family. His date of birth was likely between 1095 and 1100.

His education most likely began in Italy at the cathedral schools of Novara and Lucca and at the University of Bologna. The patronage of Odo, bishop of Lucca, who recommended him to Bernard of Clairvaux, allowed him to leave Italy and further his studies at Reims and Paris. Lombard studied first in the cathedral school at Reims, where Magister Alberich and Lutolph of Novara were teaching, and arrived in Paris about 1134, where Bernard recommended him to the canons of the church of St. Victor.

===Professor===
In Paris, where he spent the next decade teaching at the cathedral school of Notre-Dame de Paris, he came into contact with Peter Abelard and Hugh of St. Victor, who were among the leading theologians of the time. There are no proven facts relating to his whereabouts in Paris until 1142, when he became recognized as a teacher and writer. Around 1145, Peter became a &quot;magister&quot;, or professor, at the cathedral school of Notre Dame in Paris. Peter&#x27;s means of earning a living before he began to derive income as a teacher and from his canon&#x27;s prebend is shrouded in uncertainty.

Lombard&#x27;s style of teaching gained quick acknowledgment. It can be surmised that this attention is what prompted the canons of Notre Dame to ask him to join their ranks. He was considered a &quot;celebrated theologian&quot; by 1144. The Parisian school of canons had not included among their number a theologian of high regard for some years. The canons of Notre Dame, to a man, were members of the Capetian dynasty, relatives of families closely aligned to the Capetians by blood or marriage, scions of the Île-de-France or eastern Loire Valley nobility, or relatives of royal officials. In contrast, Peter had no relatives, ecclesiastical connections, and no political patrons in France. It seems that he must have been invited by the canons of Notre Dame solely for his academic merit.

===Priesthood and Bishop of Paris===
He became a subdeacon in 1147. Possibly he was present at the consistory of Paris in 1147, and certainly he attended the Council of Rheims in 1148, held in the presence of Pope Eugenius III to examine Gilbert de la Porrée and Éon de l&#x27;Étoile. Peter was among the signatories of the act condemning Gilbert&#x27;s teachings. At some time after 1150 Peter became a deacon, then archdeacon, maybe as early as 1152. He was ordained priest some time before 1156. On 28 July 1159, on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, he was consecrated bishop of Paris. Walter of St Victor accused Peter of obtaining the office by simony. The more usual story is that Philip, younger brother of Louis VII and archdeacon of Notre-Dame, was elected by the canons but declined in favor of Peter Lombard, his teacher.

Lombard&#x27;s time as bishop was brief. Lombard died on either 21 or 22 August 1160 in Paris. As to his administrative style or objectives little can be ascertained, since he left behind so few episcopal &quot;acta&quot;. He was succeeded by Maurice de Sully, the builder of the Cathedral of Notre Dame. Lombard&#x27;s tomb in the church of Saint-Marcel in Paris was destroyed during the French Revolution, but a transcription of his epitaph survives.

==Writings==

Peter Lombard wrote commentaries on the Psalms and the Pauline epistles; however, his most famous work by far was &quot;Libri Quatuor Sententiarum&quot;, or the &quot;Four Books of Sentences&quot;, which became the standard textbook of theology at the medieval universities. From the 1220s until the 16th century, no work of Christian literature, except for the Bible itself, was commented upon more frequently. Even Thomas Aquinas&#x27; &quot;Summa Theologiae,&quot; written around 1270, would not eclipse the &quot;Sentences&quot; in importance until around the 16th century. All the major medieval thinkers in western Europe, from Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas to William of Ockham and Gabriel Biel, were influenced by it. Even the young Martin Luther still wrote glosses on the &quot;Sentences&quot;, and John Calvin quoted from it over 100 times in his &quot;Institutes&quot;.

The &quot;Four Books of Sentences&quot; formed the framework upon which four centuries of scholastic interpretation of Western Christian dogma was based; however, rather than being a dialectical work itself, the &quot;Four Books of Sentences&quot; is a compilation of biblical texts, together with relevant passages from the Church Fathers and many medieval thinkers. It covered virtually the entire field of Christian theology as it was understood at the time. Peter Lombard&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; stands squarely within the pre-scholastic exegesis of biblical passages, in the tradition of Anselm of Laon who taught through quotations from authorities. It stands out as the first major effort to bring together commentaries on the full range of theological issues, arrange the material in a systematic order, and attempt to reconcile them where they appeared to defend different viewpoints. The &quot;Sentences&quot; starts with the Trinity in Book I, moves on to creation in Book II, treats Christ, the saviour of the fallen creation, in Book III, and deals with the sacraments, which mediate Christ&#x27;s grace, in Book IV.

==Doctrine==
Peter Lombard&#x27;s most famous and most controversial doctrine in the &quot;Sentences&quot; was his identification of charity with the Holy Spirit in Book I, distinction 17. According to this doctrine, when the Christian loves God and his neighbour, this love literally is God; he becomes divine and is taken up into the life of the Trinity. This idea, in its inchoate form, can be extrapolated from certain remarks of Augustine of Hippo (cf. De Trinitate 13.7.11). Although this was never explicitly declared unorthodox, few theologians have been prepared to follow Peter Lombard in this aspect of his teaching. The Council of Trent however, may have condemned this view in an implicit manner, with &quot;The Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; noting that: According to the Council of Trent sanctifying grace is not merely &quot;a&quot; formal cause, but &quot;&quot;the only&quot; formal cause&quot; (&quot;unica causa formalis&quot;) of our justification. By this important decision the Council excluded the error of Butzer and some Catholic theologians (Gropper, Seripando, and Albert Pighius) who maintained that an additional &quot;external favour of God&quot; (&quot;favor Dei externus&quot;) belonged to the essence of justification. The same decree also effectually set aside the opinion of Peter Lombard, that the formal cause of justification (i.e. sanctifying grace) is nothing less than the &quot;Person&quot; of the Holy Ghost, Who is the hypostatic holiness and charity, or the uncreated grace (&quot;gratia increata&quot;). Since justification consists in an interior sanctity and renovation of spirit, its formal cause evidently must be a created grace (&quot;gratia creata&quot;), a permanent quality, a supernatural modification or accident (&quot;accidens&quot;) of the soul.Also in the &quot;Sentences&quot; was the doctrine that marriage was consensual and need not be consummated to be considered perfect, unlike Gratian&#x27;s analysis (see &quot;sponsalia de futuro&quot;). Lombard&#x27;s interpretation was later endorsed by Pope Alexander III, and had a significant impact on Church interpretation of marriage. He emphasized that reciprocal consent of the parties is sufficiently constitutive of an absolutely indissoluble marriage, and is its only cause independent of sexual intercourse.

<text>Heinrich Brandt (8 November 1886, in Feudingen – 9 October 1954, in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt) was a German mathematician who was the first to develop the concept of a groupoid.

Brandt studied at the University of Göttingen and, from 1910 to 1913, at the University of Strasbourg. In 1912 he attained his doctorate; he was a student of Heinrich Martin Weber. From 1913 he was assistant at the University of Karlsruhe (TH). He taught geometry and applied mathematics from 1921 at RWTH Aachen. From 1930 he was the chair for mathematics at the University of Halle.

A Brandt matrix is a computational way of describing the Hecke operator action on theta series as modular forms. The theory was developed in part by Brandt&#x27;s student Martin Eichler. It offers an algorithmic approach for machine computation (in that theta series span spaces of modular forms); the theory is now considered by means of Brandt modules.

<doc id="600890" wikidata="Q5326315" url="?curid=600890" title="Earl of Linlithgow">
<text>Earl of Linlithgow was a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1600 for Alexander Livingston, 7th Lord Livingston, along with the subsidiary title of Lord Livingston and Callendar. In 1695, the Earldom of Linlithgow merged with the junior Earldom of Callendar, which had been created in 1641 for a younger son of the 1st Earl.

The 5th Earl of Linlithgow (and 4th Earl of Callendar) was attainted in 1716 for his participation in the Jacobite Rising of 1715, and all of his peerages were forfeited. The seat of the Earls of Linlithgow was Callendar House in Falkirk, which is now a museum.

*George Livingston, 3rd Earl of Linlithgow (1616-1690)
*George Livingston, 4th Earl of Linlithgow (d. 1695)
*James Livingston, 5th Earl of Linlithgow, 4th Earl of Callendar (d. 1723), married Margaret Hay (d.1723), attainted in 1716
**Children: Lord Livingston (d. 1715) and Anne Livingston (d. 1747), who married the 4th Earl of Kilmarnock (attainted/forfeited 1746), from whom are descended the Earls of Erroll

<text>In computer science, arbitrary-precision arithmetic, also called bignum arithmetic, multiple-precision arithmetic, or sometimes infinite-precision arithmetic, indicates that calculations are performed on numbers whose digits of precision are potentially limited only by the available memory of the host system. This contrasts with the faster fixed-precision arithmetic found in most arithmetic logic unit (ALU) hardware, which typically offers between 8 and 64 bits of precision.

Several modern programming languages have built-in support for bignums, and others have libraries available for arbitrary-precision integer and floating-point math. Rather than storing values as a fixed number of bits related to the size of the processor register, these implementations typically use variable-length arrays of digits.

Arbitrary precision is used in applications where the speed of arithmetic is not a limiting factor, or where precise results with very large numbers are required. It should not be confused with the symbolic computation provided by many computer algebra systems, which represent numbers by expressions such as , and can thus &quot;represent&quot; any computable number with infinite precision.

==Applications==

A common application is public-key cryptography, whose algorithms commonly employ arithmetic with integers having hundreds of digits. Another is in situations where artificial limits and overflows would be inappropriate. It is also useful for checking the results of fixed-precision calculations, and for determining optimal or near-optimal values for coefficients needed in formulae, for example the formula_1 that appears in Gaussian integration.

Arbitrary precision arithmetic is also used to compute fundamental mathematical constants such as π to millions or more digits and to analyze the properties of the digit strings or more generally to investigate the precise behaviour of functions such as the Riemann zeta function where certain questions are difficult to explore via analytical methods. Another example is in rendering fractal images with an extremely high magnification, such as those found in the Mandelbrot set.

Arbitrary-precision arithmetic can also be used to avoid overflow, which is an inherent limitation of fixed-precision arithmetic. Similar to an automobile&#x27;s odometer display which may change from 99999 to 00000, a fixed-precision integer may exhibit &quot;wraparound&quot; if numbers grow too large to represent at the fixed level of precision. Some processors can instead deal with overflow by &quot;saturation,&quot; which means that if a result would be unrepresentable, it is replaced with the nearest representable value. (With 16-bit unsigned saturation, adding any positive amount to 65535 would yield 65535.) Some processors can generate an exception if an arithmetic result exceeds the available precision. Where necessary, the exception can be caught and recovered from—for instance, the operation could be restarted in software using arbitrary-precision arithmetic.

In many cases, the task or the programmer can guarantee that the integer values in a specific application will not grow large enough to cause an overflow. Such guarantees may be based on pragmatic limits: a school attendance program may have a task limit of 4,000 students. A programmer may design the computation so that intermediate results stay within specified precision boundaries.

Some programming languages such as Lisp, Python, Perl, Haskell, Ruby and Raku use, or have an option to use, arbitrary-precision numbers for &quot;all&quot; integer arithmetic. Although this reduces performance, it eliminates the possibility of incorrect results (or exceptions) due to simple overflow. It also makes it possible to guarantee that arithmetic results will be the same on all machines, regardless of any particular machine&#x27;s word size. The exclusive use of arbitrary-precision numbers in a programming language also simplifies the language, because &quot;a number is a number&quot; and there is no need for multiple types to represent different levels of precision.

==Implementation issues==

Arbitrary-precision arithmetic is considerably slower than arithmetic using numbers that fit entirely within processor registers, since the latter are usually implemented in hardware arithmetic whereas the former must be implemented in software. Even if the computer lacks hardware for certain operations (such as integer division, or all floating-point operations) and software is provided instead, it will use number sizes closely related to the available hardware registers: one or two words only. There are exceptions, as certain &quot;variable word length&quot; machines of the 1950s and 1960s, notably the IBM 1620, IBM 1401 and the Honeywell 200 series, could manipulate numbers bound only by available storage, with an extra bit that delimited the value.

Numbers can be stored in a fixed-point format, or in a floating-point format as a significand multiplied by an arbitrary exponent. However, since division almost immediately introduces infinitely repeating sequences of digits (such as 4/7 in decimal, or 1/10 in binary), should this possibility arise then either the representation would be truncated at some satisfactory size or else rational numbers would be used: a large integer for the numerator and for the denominator. But even with the greatest common divisor divided out, arithmetic with rational numbers can become unwieldy very quickly: 1/99 − 1/100 = 1/9900, and if 1/101 is then added, the result is 10001/999900.

The size of arbitrary-precision numbers is limited in practice by the total storage available, and computation time.

Numerous algorithms have been developed to efficiently perform arithmetic operations on numbers stored with arbitrary precision. In particular, supposing that digits are employed, algorithms have been designed to minimize the asymptotic complexity for large .

The simplest algorithms are for addition and subtraction, where one simply adds or subtracts the digits in sequence, carrying as necessary, which yields an algorithm (see big O notation).

Comparison is also very simple. Compare the high-order digits (or machine words) until a difference is found. Comparing the rest of the digits/words is not necessary. The worst case is , but it may complete much faster with operands of similar magnitude.

For multiplication, the most straightforward algorithms used for multiplying numbers by hand (as taught in primary school) require operations, but multiplication algorithms that achieve complexity have been devised, such as the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm, based on fast Fourier transforms, and there are also algorithms with slightly worse complexity but with sometimes superior real-world performance for smaller . The Karatsuba multiplication is such an algorithm.

For division, see division algorithm.

==Pre-set precision==
In some languages such as REXX and ooRexx, the precision of all calculations must be set before doing a calculation. Other languages, such as Python and Ruby, extend the precision automatically to prevent overflow.

==Example==
The calculation of factorials can easily produce very large numbers. This is not a problem for their usage in many formulas (such as Taylor series) because they appear along with other terms, so that—given careful attention to the order of evaluation—intermediate calculation values are not troublesome. If approximate values of factorial numbers are desired, Stirling&#x27;s approximation gives good results using floating-point arithmetic. The largest representable value for a fixed-size integer variable may be exceeded even for relatively small arguments as shown in the table below. Even floating-point numbers are soon outranged, so it may help to recast the calculations in terms of the logarithm of the number.

But if exact values for large factorials are desired, then special software is required, as in the pseudocode that follows, which implements the classic algorithm to calculate 1, 1×2, 1×2×3, 1×2×3×4, etc. the successive factorial numbers.

 constants:
 Limit = 1000 &quot;% Sufficient digits.&quot;
 Base = 10 &quot;% The base of the simulated arithmetic.&quot;
 FactorialLimit = 365 &quot;% Target number to solve, 365!&quot;
 tdigit: Array[0:9] of character = [&quot;0&quot;,&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;,&quot;6&quot;,&quot;7&quot;,&quot;8&quot;,&quot;9&quot;]
 variables:
 digit: Array[1:Limit] of 0..9 &quot;% The big number.&quot;
 carry, d: Integer &quot;% Assistants during multiplication.&quot;
 last: Integer &quot;% Index into the big number&#x27;s digits.&quot;
 text: Array[1:Limit] of character &quot;% Scratchpad for the output.&quot;
 digit[*] := 0 &quot;% Clear the whole array.&quot;
 last := 1 &quot;% The big number starts as a single-digit,&quot;
 digit[1] := 1 &quot;% its only digit is 1.&quot;
 for n := 1 to FactorialLimit: &quot;% Step through producing 1!, 2!, 3!, 4!, etc. &quot;
 carry := 0 &quot;% Start a multiply by n.&quot;
 for i := 1 to last: &quot;% Step along every digit.&quot;
 d := digit[i] * n + carry &quot;% Multiply a single digit.&quot;
 digit[i] := d mod Base &quot;% Keep the low-order digit of the result.&quot;
 carry := d div Base &quot;% Carry over to the next digit.&quot;
 while carry &gt; 0: &quot;% Store the remaining carry in the big number.&quot;
 if last &gt;= Limit: error(&quot;overflow&quot;)
 last := last + 1 &quot;% One more digit.&quot;
 digit[last] := carry mod Base
 carry := carry div Base &quot;% Strip the last digit off the carry.&quot;
 text[*] := &quot; &quot; &quot;% Now prepare the output.&quot;
 for i := 1 to last: &quot;% Translate from binary to text.&quot;
 text[Limit - i + 1] := tdigit[digit[i]] &quot;% Reversing the order.&quot;
 print text[Limit - last + 1:Limit], &quot; = &quot;, n, &quot;!&quot;

With the example in view, a number of details can be discussed. The most important is the choice of the representation of the big number. In this case, only integer values are required for digits, so an array of fixed-width integers is adequate. It is convenient to have successive elements of the array represent higher powers of the base.

The second most important decision is in the choice of the base of arithmetic, here ten. There are many considerations. The scratchpad variable must be able to hold the result of a single-digit multiply &quot;plus the carry&quot; from the prior digit&#x27;s multiply. In base ten, a sixteen-bit integer is certainly adequate as it allows up to 32767. However, this example cheats, in that the value of is not itself limited to a single digit. This has the consequence that the method will fail for or so. In a more general implementation, would also use a multi-digit representation. A second consequence of the shortcut is that after the multi-digit multiply has been completed, the last value of &quot;carry&quot; may need to be carried into multiple higher-order digits, not just one.

There is also the issue of printing the result in base ten, for human consideration. Because the base is already ten, the result could be shown simply by printing the successive digits of array &quot;digit&quot;, but they would appear with the highest-order digit last (so that 123 would appear as &quot;321&quot;). The whole array could be printed in reverse order, but that would present the number with leading zeroes (&quot;00000...000123&quot;) which may not be appreciated, so this implementation builds the representation in a space-padded text variable and then prints that. The first few results (with spacing every fifth digit and annotation added here) are:

This implementation could make more effective use of the computer&#x27;s built in arithmetic. A simple escalation would be to use base 100 (with corresponding changes to the translation process for output), or, with sufficiently wide computer variables (such as 32-bit integers) we could use larger bases, such as 10,000. Working in a power-of-2 base closer to the computer&#x27;s built-in integer operations offers advantages, although conversion to a decimal base for output becomes more difficult. On typical modern computers, additions and multiplications take constant time independent of the values of the operands (so long as the operands fit in single machine words), so there are large gains in packing as much of a bignumber as possible into each element of the digit array. The computer may also offer facilities for splitting a product into a digit and carry without requiring the two operations of &quot;mod&quot; and &quot;div&quot; as in the example, and nearly all arithmetic units provide a &quot;carry flag&quot; which can be exploited in multiple-precision addition and subtraction. This sort of detail is the grist of machine-code programmers, and a suitable assembly-language bignumber routine can run faster than the result of the compilation of a high-level language, which does not provide direct access to such facilities but instead maps the high-level statements to its model of the target machine using an optimizing compiler.

For a single-digit multiply the working variables must be able to hold the value (base−1) + carry, where the maximum value of the carry is (base−1). Similarly, the variables used to index the digit array are themselves limited in width. A simple way to extend the indices would be to deal with the bignumber&#x27;s digits in blocks of some convenient size so that the addressing would be via (block &quot;i&quot;, digit &quot;j&quot;) where &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; would be small integers, or, one could escalate to employing bignumber techniques for the indexing variables. Ultimately, machine storage capacity and execution time impose limits on the problem size.

==History==
IBM&#x27;s first business computer, the IBM 702 (a vacuum-tube machine) of the mid-1950s, implemented integer arithmetic &quot;entirely in hardware&quot; on digit strings of any length from 1 to 511 digits. The earliest widespread software implementation of arbitrary-precision arithmetic was probably that in Maclisp. Later, around 1980, the operating systems VAX/VMS and VM/CMS offered bignum facilities as a collection of string functions in the one case and in the languages EXEC 2 and REXX in the other.

An early widespread implementation was available via the IBM 1620 of 1959–1970. The 1620 was a decimal-digit machine which used discrete transistors, yet it had hardware (that used lookup tables) to perform integer arithmetic on digit strings of a length that could be from two to whatever memory was available. For floating-point arithmetic, the mantissa was restricted to a hundred digits or fewer, and the exponent was restricted to two digits only. The largest memory supplied offered 60 000 digits, however Fortran compilers for the 1620 settled on fixed sizes such as 10, though it could be specified on a control card if the default was not satisfactory.

==Software libraries==
Arbitrary-precision arithmetic in most computer software is implemented by calling an external library that provides data types and subroutines to store numbers with the requested precision and to perform computations.

Different libraries have different ways of representing arbitrary-precision numbers, some libraries work only with integer numbers, others store floating point numbers in a variety of bases (decimal or binary powers). Rather than representing a number as single value, some store numbers as a numerator/denominator pair (rationals) and some can fully represent computable numbers, though only up to some storage limit. Fundamentally, Turing machines cannot represent all real numbers, as the cardinality of formula_2 exceeds the cardinality of formula_3.

<text>Alexander Bannerman Warburton (April 5, 1852 – January 14, 1929) was a politician, jurist and author, who served as the seventh premier of Prince Edward Island, Canada.

Alexander was born in Summerside, the son of James Warburton, who was a member of the provincial assembly. Named after Lieut. Governor, Sir Alexander Bannerman, he was educated in Summerside, at St. Dunstan&#x27;s College, King&#x27;s College in Nova Scotia and the University of Edinburgh. He was called to the bar in 1879. He was a director for the &quot;Patriot&quot; Publishing Company and the Eastern Assurance Company of Canada.

Warburton was first elected to the province&#x27;s House of Assembly in 1891 as a Liberal, and was re-elected in 1893 and 1897. He became premier of the province on October 27, 1897, when his predecessor resigned to move to British Columbia. Warburton only served in the position for eight months until resigning in June 1898 to accept a judicial appointment.

In the 1908 federal election, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), but lost his seat in the 1911 election that defeated the Laurier Liberals. He attempted to return to the House but was again defeated in the 1917 election. In 1920, Warburton returned to the bench as a judge on probate court and held that position until his death.

Warburton wrote two books on the history of the island, &quot;Prince Edward Island, Past and Present&quot; in 1905, and &quot;A History of Prince Edward Island&quot; which was published posthumously in 1923. Prior to entering politics, Warburton started a movement to beautify Charlottetown which resulting in the planting of more than 800 trees along main thoroughfares and in public squares, many of which stand to this day.

<doc id="600901" wikidata="Q142937" url="?curid=600901" title="Ex parte">
<text>In law, ex parte () is a Latin term meaning literally &quot;from/out of the party/faction of&quot; (name of party/faction, often omitted), thus signifying &quot;on behalf of (name)&quot;. An &quot;ex parte&quot; decision is one decided by a judge without requiring all of the parties to the dispute to be present. In English law and its derivatives, namely Australian, New Zealand, Canadian, South African, Indian, and U.S. legal doctrines, &quot;ex parte&quot; means a legal proceeding brought by one party in the absence of and without representation of or notification to the other party.

The term is also used more loosely to refer to improper unilateral contacts with a court, arbitrator, or represented party without notice to the other party or counsel for that party. The phrase was common in the titles of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and judicial review cases until the end of the twentieth century, because those cases were originally brought by the Crown on behalf of the claimant. In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions, the title typically appeared as &quot;R v (Defendant), ex parte (Claimant)&quot;; in the US, this was shortened to &quot;Ex parte&quot; (Claimant). A proceeding in an executive agency to establish a right, such as patent prosecution, can also be &quot;ex parte&quot;.

==Australia==
In Australian law ex parte is used in two senses. The predominant use is to refer to an ex parte hearing, being one which is heard in the absence of one or more parties. Where proceedings are heard ex parte, a high degree of candour is required, including full and fair disclosure of facts adverse to the moving party. A failure to make such disclosure is ordinarily sufficient to warrant discharge of such order as might be made.

The other use means &#x27;on the application of&#x27; when used in the case name where prerogative relief is sought, such as a writ of prohibition, certiorari or mandamus. Thus for example the case name in the &quot;Boilermakers&#x27; case&quot; is &quot;R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers&#x27; Society of Australia&quot; as the case concerned a writ of prohibition that was sought against Kirby, Dunphy and Ashburner, who were judges of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, on the application of the Boilermakers Society of Australia. While the case name is &#x27;ex parte&#x27; it was not heard in the absence of a party, with the judges being represented by D I Menzies QC who also represented the Commonwealth Attorney-General. Similarly the case of &quot;Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally&quot; concerned application of McNally for a writ of prohibition in relation to proceedings in the Federal Court that were commenced by Wakim. Both McNally and Wakim appeared in the High Court. There was however no appearance for the first respondents in the bankruptcy cases, the judges of the Federal Court.

==United States==
In the United States, the availability of &quot;ex parte&quot; orders or decrees from both federal and state courts is sharply limited by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which provide that a person shall not be deprived of any interest in liberty or property without due process of law. In practice this has been interpreted to require adequate notice of the request for judicial relief and an opportunity to be heard concerning the merits of such relief. A court order issued on the basis of an &quot;ex parte&quot; proceeding, therefore, will necessarily be &quot;de bene esse&quot; (temporary and interim in nature), and the person(s) affected by the order must be given an opportunity to contest the appropriateness of the order before it can be made permanent.

There are exceptions to this. The secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which grants the National Security Agency permission to perform certain types of electronic surveillance, operates on a permanent &quot;ex parte&quot; basis. Parties other than the government are not normally permitted to argue in front of the court, though it is possible for the recipients of court orders to challenge them in other ways. This is as directed by statute. Most US states also allow for initial hearings regarding civil protection orders to be done &quot;ex&quot; &quot;parte;&quot; however, a second hearing is usually set a short time later to allow the alleged abuser to answer for the allegations. An article about such restraining orders, authored by Debra Stark and Jessica Choplin, indicated this concept in its title, &quot;Seeing the Wrecking Ball in Motion: Ex Parte Protection Orders and the Realities of Domestic Violence&quot;. The idea is that ex parte orders must be used in a &quot;wrecking ball&quot; type of situation, where giving advance notice to a respondent would allow him or her to cause irreversible damage before the notice takes effect. Stark and Choplin argued that such damage would be possible if ex parte orders were not used for restraining orders, and that the very fact of an order being issued might increase the chance of the respondent causing damage.

The phrase has also traditionally been used in the captions of petitions for the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, which were (and in some jurisdictions, still are) styled as &quot;&quot;Ex parte&quot; Doe,&quot; where Doe was the name of the petitioner who was alleged to be wrongfully held. As the Supreme Court&#x27;s description of nineteenth century practice in &quot;Ex parte Milligan&quot; shows, however, such proceedings were not &quot;ex parte&quot; in any significant sense. The prisoner&#x27;s &quot;ex parte&quot; application sought only an order requiring the person holding the prisoner to appear before the court to justify the prisoner&#x27;s detention; no order requiring the freeing of a prisoner could be given until after the jailer was given the opportunity to contest the prisoner&#x27;s claims at a hearing on the merits.

===State trial courts===

State courts vary in their use of ex parte proceedings (for example, in custody cases, replevin cases and other civil matters), though most have it in one form or another. For example, in the States of California and Illinois, &quot;ex parte&quot; proceedings are available if notice is given before 10 a.m. the previous court day, or even shorter upon showing of emergency need. As most courts in these two states hold law and motion hearings in the early morning, this notice is typically confirmed by facsimile although oral notice may be effective. Some courts in California have procedures to allow opponents to appear telephonically, while other courts do not allow any oral argument and only consider written papers. In California, the party who files an &quot;ex parte&quot; application must file a declaration showing compliance with these requirements, and no relief may be granted absent such declaration. In addition to the notice requirements, an ex parte application must contain an affirmative actual showing in a declaration based on personal knowledge of &quot;irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte&quot;.

== United Kingdom ==
Before the Woolf Reforms, judicial reviews in England were cited &quot;Regina v [The Public Body] ex parte [Person]&quot;, where the person was the one actually bringing the case. The &#x27;Regina&#x27; (or Rex if the monarch is a male) refers to the sovereign in whose name all judicial reviews are brought. This derives from the petition for writs, which were in the name of the Crown. Since the reforms, cases are now named &quot;Rex (on the application of [Person]) v [The Public Body]&quot;.

<text>The title of Viscount Lisle has been created six times in the Peerage of England. The first creation, on 30 October 1451, was for John Talbot, 1st Baron Lisle. Upon the death of his son Thomas at the Battle of Nibley Green in 1470, the viscountcy became extinct and the barony abeyant.

In 1475, the abeyance terminated in favour of Thomas&#x27; sister, Elizabeth Talbot, 3rd Baroness Lisle, wife of Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Lisle. Sir Edward was created Viscount Lisle on 28 June 1483, but the title became extinct on the death of their son John in 1504. The viscounty now passed to John&#x27;s posthumous daughter Elizabeth, whose wardship was granted to Sir Charles Brandon. He contracted to marry her, and was created Viscount Lisle on 15 May 1513 in consequence. Charles Brandon later annulled the contract and married Mary Tudor, Dowager Queen of France, in 1515, surrendering the title Viscount Lisle before 1523. Elizabeth died in 1519 and the barony passed to her aunt, also named Elizabeth Grey. Her husband, Arthur Plantagenet was created Viscount Lisle on 25 April 1523. He continued to hold the title after her death in about 1525. After Arthur Plantagenet&#x27;s death in 1542, the viscountcy went to Elizabeth Grey&#x27;s eldest son by her first marriage, John Dudley, &quot;by the right of his mother&quot;. He was created Viscount Lisle on 12 March 1542, and later rose to be Duke of Northumberland; but he forfeited his titles upon his execution and attainder in 1553.

The final creation of the viscountcy was on 4 May 1605 as a subsidiary title for Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester, grandson of the Duke of Northumberland. It became extinct with the Earldom of Leicester in 1743.

<text>Eyalets (, , ), also known as beylerbeyliks or pashaliks, were the primary administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire.

From 1453 to the beginning of the nineteenth century the Ottoman local government was loosely structured. The empire was at first divided into states called eyalets, presided over by a beylerbey (title equivalent to duke in Turkish and Amir al Umara in Arabic) of three tails (feathers borne on a state officer&#x27;s ceremonial staff). The grand vizier was responsible for nominating all the high officers of state, both in the capital and the states. Between 1861 and 1866, these eyalets were abolished, and the territory was divided for administrative purposes into vilayets (provinces).

The eyalets were subdivided into districts called livas or sanjaks, each of which was under the charge of a pasha of one tail, with the title of mira-lira, or sanjak-bey. These provinces were usually called pashaliks by Europeans. The pasha was invested with powers of absolute government within his province, being the chief of both the military and financial departments, as well as police and criminal justice.At official functions, the order of precedence was Egypt, Baghdad, Abyssinia, Buda, Anatolia, &quot;Mera&#x27;ish&quot;, and the Kapudan Pasha in Asia and Buda, Egypt, Abyssinia, Baghdad, and Rumelia in Europe, with the remainder arranged according to the chronological order of their conquest.

==Names==
The term &quot;eyalet&quot; is sometimes translated province or governorate. Depending on the rank of the governor, they were also sometimes known as &quot;pashaliks&quot; (governed by a &quot;pasha&quot;), &quot;beylerbeyliks&quot; (governed by a &quot;bey&quot; or &quot;beylerbey&quot;), and &quot;kapudanliks&quot; (governed by a &quot;kapudan&quot;).

Pashaluk or Pashalik () is the abstract word derived from pasha, denoting the quality, office or jurisdiction of a pasha or the territory administered by him. In European sources, the word &quot;pashalic&quot; generally referred to the eyalets.

The term &#x27;eyalet&#x27; began to be applied to the largest administrative unit of the Ottoman Empire instead of beglerbegilik from the 1590s onward, and it continued to be used until 1867.

==History==

Murad I instituted the great division of the sultanate into two beylerbeyiliks of Rumelia and Anatolia, in circa 1365. With the eastward expansion of Bayezid&#x27;s realms in the 1390s, a third eyalet, Rûm Eyalet, came into existence, with Amasya its chief town. This became the seat of government of Bayezid&#x27;s youngest son, Mehmed I, and was to remain a residence of princely governors until the 16th century.

In 1395, Bayezid I executed the last Shishmanid Tsar of Bulgaria, and annexed his realm to Rumelia Eyalet. In 1461, Mehmed II expelled the last of the Isfendyarid dynasty from Sinop, awarding him lands thus taxation authority near Bursa in exchange for his hereditary territory. The Isfendyarid principality became a district of Anatolia Eyalet. In 1468, Karaman Eyalet was established, following the annexation of the formerly independent principality of Karaman; Mehmed II appointed his son Mustafa as governor of the new eyalet, with his seat at Konya.

The 16th century saw the greatest increase in the number of eyalets, largely through the conquests of Selim I and Süleyman I, which created the need to incorporate the new territory into the structure of the Empire, and partly through the reorganisation of existing territory. A list dated 1527 shows eight eyalets, with Egypt, Damascus, Diyarbekir and Kurdistan added to the original four. The last eyalet, however, did not survive as an administrative entity. Süleyman&#x27;s conquests in eastern Turkey, Iraq and Hungary also resulted in the creation of new eyalets.

The former principality of Dulkadir became the Dulkadir Eyalet at some time after its annexation in 1522. After the Iranian campaign of 1533–6, the new eyalets of Erzurum, Van, Sharazor and Baghdad guarded the frontier with Iran. In 1541 came the creation of Budin Eyalet from part of the old Kingdom of Hungary. The Eyalet of the Archipelago was created by Süleyman I especially for Hayreddin Barbarossa in 1533, by detaching districts from the shores and islands of the Aegean which had previously been part of the eyalets of Rumelia and Anatolia, and uniting them as an independent eyalet.

In 1580, Bosnia, previously a district of Rumelia, became an eyalet in its own right, presumably in view of its strategically important position on the border with the Habsburgs. Similar considerations led to the creation of the Kanije Eyalet from the districts adjoining this border fortress, which had fallen to the Ottomans in 1600. In the same period, the annexation of the Rumelian districts on the lower Danube and the Black Sea coast, and their addition to territories between the Danube and the Dniepr along the Black Sea, created the Silistra Eyalet. At the same time, on the south-eastern shore of the Black Sea, Trebizond Eyalet came into being. The purpose of this reorganisation, and especially the creation of the eyalet of Özi was presumably to improve the defences of the Black Sea ports against the Cossacks.By 1609, according to the list of Ayn Ali, there were 32 eyalets. Some of these, such as Tripoli, Cyprus or Tunis, were the spoils of conquest. Others, however, were the products of administrative division.

In 1795, the government launched a major reorganization of the provincial administration, with a law decreeing that there would be 28 provinces, each to be governed by a vizer. These were Adana, Aleppo, Anatolia, Baghdad, Basra, Bosnia, Childir, Crete, Constantinople, Damascus, Diyarbekir, Egypt, Erzurum, Habesh, Karaman, Kars, Dulkadir, the Archipelago, Morea, Mosul, Rakka, Rumelia, Sayda, Sharazor, Silistra, Sivas, Trebizond, Tripoli, Van. In practice, however, central control remained weak, and beylerbeyis continued to rule some provinces, instead of vizers.

==Government==
The beylerbeyliks where the timar system was not applied, such as Abyssinia, Algiers, Egypt, Baghdad, Basra and Lahsa, were more autonomous than the others. Instead of collecting provincial revenues through sipahis, the beylerbey transferred fixed annual sums to Constantinople, known as the salyane.

By 1500, the four central eyalets of the Empire, Rumelia, Anatolia, Rum and Karaman, were under direct rule. Wallachia, Moldavia and the Khanate of the Crimea, territories which Mehmed II had brought under his suzerainty, remained in the control of native dynasties tributary to the Sultan. So, too, did the Kingdom of Hungary after the battle of Mohács in 1526.

==List==
From the mid-14th century until the late 16th century, only one new beylerbeylik (Karaman) was established.

===Disappeared before 1609===
The eyalets that existed before 1609 but disappeared include the following:

===Eyalets in 1609===
Conquests of Selim I and Suleyman I in the 16th century required an increase in administrative units. By the end of the latter half of the century there were as many as 42 &quot;eyalets&quot;, as the beylerbeyliks came to be known. The chart below shows the administrative situation as of 1609.

==Modern usage of the term==
Turkish Language Association defines the word &quot;eyalet&quot; as &quot;an administrative division having some kind of administrative independence&quot; and in modern Turkish, the word &quot;eyalet&quot; is used widely in the context of federalism, corresponding to the English word &quot;state&quot;. While the word &quot;eyalet&quot; is out of use in Turkish public administration, replaced long ago by &quot;ils&quot; under a unitary structure, top-level administrative subdivisions of numerous federal states are called &quot;eyalet&quot; in Turkish, such as the states of Australia, Austria, Brazil, Germany, India, Malaysia, Mexico and the United States, sometimes along with the provinces of Argentina, Canada and Pakistan, deferent to the modern definition of the word. Albeit China and Iran are legally unitary states, these countries&#x27; provinces may also occasionally be referred to as &quot;eyalet&quot; in Turkish.

<doc id="600915" wikidata="Q2469270" url="?curid=600915" title="USS Fletcher (DD-992)">
<text>USS &quot;Fletcher&quot; (DD-992), the thirtieth &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer, was part of the first major class of United States Navy surface ships to be powered by gas turbines. She was commissioned in July 1980 and was deployed mainly in the western and southern Pacific, but also voyaged to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. She was the second ship in the U.S. Navy to bear this name but the first to be named after Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher and Frank Jack Fletcher. After her decommissioning in 2004, she was sunk in a torpedo test exercise in 2008.

==Construction==
Designed and built by Ingalls Shipyards of Litton Industries in Pascagoula, Mississippi, &quot;Fletcher&quot; was a member of the first major class of surface ships in the United States Navy to be powered by gas turbine engines. Four General Electric LM2500 gas turbine engines, marine versions of those used in DC-10 aircraft, drove the ship at speeds in excess of 30 knots (56 km/h). Twin controllable reversible pitch propellers provided &quot;Fletcher&quot; with a degree of maneuverability unique among warships of her size.

==History==
Commissioned in July 1980, &quot;Fletcher&quot; was immediately sent to join the Pacific Fleet. Starting in 1982, &quot;Fletcher&quot; made regular deployments to the western and southern Pacific, with some of those extending into the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf areas. During 1994 and 1995, she was modernized with the vertical launch system, giving her a much broader range of capabilities.

A highly versatile multi-mission destroyer, &quot;Fletcher&quot; was capable of operating independently or in company with amphibious or carrier task forces. Her main mission was to operate offensively in a strike warfare or antisubmarine warfare (ASW) role. The Tomahawk weapons systems provided &quot;Fletcher&quot; with long range cruise missile capability for use in tactical strike operations. The ship&#x27;s primary passive ASW sensor was the AN/SQR-19 tactical towed array sonar (TACTAS). Its active sonar together with the Mk 116 underwater fire control system combined as one of the most advanced underwater detection and fire control systems ever developed. The Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) provided the ship with faster and more accurate processing of target information. Integration of the ship&#x27;s digital gun fire control system in the NTDS provided quick reaction in the mission areas of shore bombardment, anti-surface, and anti-aircraft warfare.

&quot;Fletcher&quot; was originally armed with an 8-tube ASROC launcher, but was later upgraded with a sixty-one cell Mk 41 vertical launching system for firing Tomahawk land attack missiles (TLAMs) and anti-submarine rockets (ASROCs). Other weapons included two Mk 45 light weight 5 inch guns, two triple Mk 32 torpedo tubes, and facilities for operating LAMPS helicopters. The ship was also armed with the NATO Sea Sparrow missile system, a short range, surface-to-air defensive weapon; and the Harpoon weapon system, a medium range, surface-to-surface, anti-ship cruise missile. For defense against anti-ship missile, &quot;Fletcher&quot; employed two Mk 15 (PHALANX) 20 mm close-in weapons system, SRBOC chaff, and topside armor in addition to the NATO Sea Sparrow missile system. The AN/SLQ-32 countermeasures set provided &quot;Fletcher&quot; with additional defense against anti-ship missiles through the use of active electronic countermeasures.

Crew comfort and habitability were an integral part of the design. Berthing compartments were spacious and the ship was equipped with amenities not usually found aboard other destroyers, including a crew&#x27;s gymnasium and an improvised library of sorts with several hundred fiction novels. Although &quot;Fletcher&quot; was as large as a World War II cruiser, a high degree of automation permitted a crew of 24 officers and 296 enlisted to operate the ship.

===Deployment in 1983===
On 20 July 1983, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the &quot;Fletcher&quot;, along with seven other vessels in the carrier battle group, left San Diego on Friday 15 July 1983, and were headed for the western Pacific when they were rerouted and ordered to steam for Central America to conduct training and flight operations in areas off the coasts of Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras as part of major military exercises planned for that summer. The other ships in the battle group were the cruiser &quot;Horne&quot;, the guided missile destroyer &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot;, the destroyer &quot;Fife&quot;, the frigate &quot;Marvin Shields&quot;, the oiler &quot;Wichita&quot;, and the support ship &quot;Camden&quot;.

Following the diversion to Central America, &quot;Fletcher&quot;, along with Battle Group Echo, resumed the planned deployment to the Indian Ocean. Following the regular stops at Pearl Harbor and Subic Bay, Philippines, &quot;Fletcher&quot; was tasked with steaming down the coast of Vietnam, just outside territorial waters, to affirm the right-of-way of maritime traffic in international waters. Following the transit of the Straits of Malacca, &quot;Fletcher&quot; spent virtually the entire period in the Indian Ocean on station in the North Arabian Sea, as previously planned port calls were cancelled due to the changing nature of political and operational matters in the Mid-East. The one exception was an unplanned port call in Port Victoria, Seychelles. &quot;Fletcher&quot; returned to San Diego on 29 February 1984.

===Sea Swap in 2003===
On 2 August 2002, USS &quot;Fletcher&quot; departed Pearl Harbor to begin Sea Swap, an experimental program that calls for a &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer to deploy and remain on station for more than 400 days. The original Sea Swap &quot;Fletcher&quot; crew, under the command of Cmdr. Thomas Neal, stopped in Yokosuka, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. While in port Singapore, numerous repairs were accomplished as part of an availability period. &quot;Fletcher&quot; then headed to the Persian Gulf. The original &quot;Fletcher&quot; team sailed the ship to the Persian Gulf and spent the next four months conducting Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO) in support of United Nations sanctions on Iraq. The Sea Swap initiative became a reality in January 2003, when the &quot;Fletcher&quot; crew pulled the ship into Fremantle, Australia, and made preparations to turn it over to the former crew of the USS &quot;Kinkaid (DD-965)&quot;, under the command of CDR Mike Slotsky. After decommissioning &quot;Kinkaid&quot;, they had embarked a flight to Australia ready to turn over and assume command of &quot;Fletcher&quot;. Team &quot;Kinkaid&quot; then made preparations to take &quot;Fletcher&quot; back to the Persian Gulf for their six-month deployment. The original &quot;Fletcher&quot; crew then flew back to Pearl Harbor and disassembled to their new duty stations. Team &quot;Kinkaid&quot; completed a 4-month deployment in the Persian Gulf and participated in Escort Operations and Tomahawk Missile Strikes at the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF); at same time the was decommissioning in San Diego. Team &quot;Oldendorf&quot;, under the command of CDR Charles Gaouette, received the &quot;Fletcher&quot; in Singapore from team &quot;Kinkaid.&quot; Team &quot;Oldendorf&quot; then proceeded to the Persian Gulf and completed their deployment. They then proceeded to Fremantle, Australia for their relief from the crew of . It was being prepared for decommissioning. The crew of the &quot;Elliot&quot;, under the command of CDR John Nolan, then embarked on a flight to Fremantle to receive the &quot;Fletcher&quot; from Team &quot;Oldendorf&quot;. Team &quot;Elliot&quot; was the last crew to embark onboard &quot;Fletcher&quot;. Team &quot;Elliot&quot; then completed a final 4-month deployment in the Persian Gulf in 2004, continuing Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO) in support of &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot;.

===Fate===
&quot;Fletcher&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Navy list 1 October 2004. In 2004, the President requested authority to sell &quot;Fletcher&quot; to Chile; in 2005 her transfer to Pakistan was authorized by the Senate. On 16 July 2008, the U.S. Navy, working with the Royal Australian Navy, sank &quot;Fletcher&quot; as part of a new torpedo test exercise. The Australian submarine HMAS &quot;Waller&quot; test fired a modified live Mk48 Mod7 ADCAP torpedo specifically designed for shallow water operations. The &quot;Fletcher&quot; suffered a direct hit, breaking in half and sinking within minutes. The &quot;Fletcher&#x27;s&quot; final resting place is located at .

<doc id="600918" wikidata="Q2275419" url="?curid=600918" title="Culture of Finland">
<text>The culture of Finland combines indigenous heritage, as represented for example by the country&#x27;s national languages Finnish (a Uralic language) and Swedish (a Germanic language), and the sauna, with common Nordic and European cultural aspects. Because of its history and geographic location, Finland has been influenced by the adjacent areas, various Finnic and Baltic peoples as well as the former dominant powers of Sweden and Russia. Finnish culture is built upon the relatively ascetic environmental realities, traditional livelihoods, and heritage of egalitarianism (e.g. Everyman&#x27;s right, universal suffrage) and the traditionally widespread ideal of self-sufficiency (e.g. predominantly rural lifestyles and modern summer cottages).

There are cultural differences among the various regions of Finland, especially minor differences in dialect. Minorities, some of which have a status recognised by the state, such as the Sami, Swedish-speaking Finns, Karelians, Romani, Jews, and Tatars, maintain their cultural identities within Finland. Many Finns are emotionally connected to the countryside and nature, as large-scale urbanisation is a relatively recent phenomenon.
== Historical overview ==
The Scandinavian ice sheet covered most of northern Europe. Following its recession around 8000 BC, people began arriving in what is today Finland, with a majority presumably traveling from the south and east. Recent archaeological finds also reveal the presence of the north-western Komsa culture in northern Finland to be as old as the earliest discoveries on the Norwegian coast.

What is today Finland belonged to the northeastern Kunda culture until around 5000 BC and the Comb Ceramic culture from about 4200–2000 BC. The Kiukainen culture appeared on the southwestern coast of Finland around 1200 BC.

From 1100 to 1200, the crown of Sweden started to incorporate Finland. However, Novgorod also attempted to gain control. Several wars occurred between 1400 and 1700 where Finland fought against Sweden, Novgorod, the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and imperial Russia. In 1721, the Nystad Peace Treaty was signed, ending Swedish dominance in the Baltic region. In 1809, Finland was annexed by Russia. However from 1809 to 1917, Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy with the Russian Czar as the constitutional monarch. In southeastern Finland, the region of Karelia, where most of the Russo-Swedish conflicts occurred, was influenced by both cultures while remaining peripheral to both epicentres of power. The verses in Finland&#x27;s national epic, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, originate mainly from Karelia and Ingria.

The 19th century brought a feeling of national Romanticism and Nationalism throughout Europe. Finland&#x27;s nationalism also grew, forming cultural identity and making control of the land a priority. Expression of Finnish identity by the University docent, A. I. Arwidsson (1791–1858), became an often quoted Fennoman credo: &quot;Swedes we are not, Russians we do not want to become, let us, therefore, be Finns.&quot; Nationalism heightened and resulted in a declaration of full independence from Russia on 6 December 1917, Finnish Independence Day. Notably, nationalists did not consider the Swedish-speakers members of a different (Swedish) nation; in fact, many Fennomans came from Swedish-speaking families.

== Ethnic groups and languages==

=== Finns ===
The majority ethnic group of Finland is the Finns. Most Finns speak Finnish as their mother tongue. The Finnish language is not an Indo-European language. It belongs to the Uralic language family. Finns are traditionally divided into subgroups (&quot;heimo&quot;) based on their dialect, but these groupings have only minor importance due to 20th-century urbanization and internal migration.

==== Swedish-speaking Finns ====
The largest subculture in Finland is its Swedish-speaking Finns. The political party Swedish People&#x27;s Party (), has traditionally had a small but important part of the Swedish-Finnish culture. The daily newspaper &quot;Hufvudstadsbladet&quot; (&#x27;Capital City Paper&#x27;) is the largest Swedish daily newspaper in Finland and has its headquarters in Helsinki. The Swedish-speaking minority has been the target of harassment and discrimination in Finland. They are still considered the upper-class in Finland, especially in Helsinki, and have earned nicknames, such as &quot;Svenska talande bättre folk&quot; (&#x27;Swedish speaking better people&#x27;). Swedish-Finns are also sometimes referred to as &quot;Ankkalampi&quot; (&quot;Ankdammen&quot; or &#x27;The Duck Pond&#x27;) due to their relatively small number where everybody knows each other. Today, however, most differences are blurred (though rich, powerful Swedish-speaking families still exist) due to mixed marriages and inter-cultural homogenization and communication. The Swedish-Finnish group does have unique traditions distinct from the mainstream Finnish-speaking ones but does not live in a different society. The group has various origins, both from language switching and from immigration.

=== Sami ===

The Lapland region of the North holds the Sami population. Up to around 1500, the Sami were mainly fishermen and trappers, usually in a combination, leading a nomadic lifestyle decided by the migrations of the reindeer. Traditionally, Sami people engaged in fishing, trapping and herding reindeer. They have traditionally organized their societies differently from the Finns due to their nomadic lifestyle. Their native language is not Finnish, but one of the three Sami languages spoken in Finland. However, modern times have brought most Sami to urban areas, where they assimilate to mainstream society and speak Finnish. 10% of Sami continue herding in Northern Finland. Currently, the Sami are a 5% minority in their native Finnish Lapland.

=== Romani ===

Another nomadic group is the Finnish Gypsies who have existed since the 17th century. For centuries Gypsy men were horse traders, whereas in the post-war era they have turned to horse breeding and dealing in automobiles and scrap metal. Women traditionally engage in fortune-telling and handcrafts. Gypsies have been the target of harassment and discrimination in Finland. &quot;A permanent Advisory Commission on Gypsy Affairs was set up in 1968, and in 1970 racial discrimination was outlawed through an addition to the penal code. The law punished blatant acts such as barring Gypsies from restaurants or shops or subjecting them to unusual surveillance by shopkeepers or the police.&quot; Today, financial aid is provided to improve the standard of living for 5,000–6,000 Finnish Gypsies.

== Social beliefs ==

=== Gender equality ===

After examining the position of women around the world, the Washington-based Population Crisis Committee reported in 1988 that Finland, slightly behind top-ranked Sweden and just ahead of the United States, was one of the very best places in which a woman could live. The group reached this conclusion after examining the health, educational, economic, and legal conditions that affect women&#x27;s lives.

When compared with women of other nations, Finnish women, who accounted for just over 50 percent of the population in the mid-1980s, did have a privileged place. They were the first in Europe to gain the franchise, and by the 1980s they routinely constituted about one-third of the membership of the Eduskunta (parliament) and held several ministerial posts. In the 1980s, about 75 percent of adult women worked outside the home; they made up about 48 percent of the workforce. Finnish women were as well educated as their male counterparts, and, in some cases, the number of women studying at the university level, for example, was slightly ahead of the number of men. In addition to an expanding welfare system, which since World War II had come to provide them with substantial assistance in the area of childbearing and child-rearing, women had made notable legislative gains that brought them closer to full equality with men.

In 1972 the was established to advise lawmakers on methods for realizing full legal equality for women. In 1983 legislation arranged that both parents were to have equal rights for custody of their children. A year later, women were granted equal rights in the establishment of their children&#x27;s nationality. Henceforth any child born of a Finnish woman would have Finnish citizenship. After a very heated national debate, legislation was passed in 1985 that gave women an equal right to decide what surname or surnames they and their children would use. These advances were capped by that went into effect in early 1987 forbidding any discrimination based on sex and protecting against this discrimination. Once these laws were passed, Finnish authorities signed the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1986.

In several areas, however, the country&#x27;s small feminist movement maintained that the circumstances in which Finnish women lived needed to be improved. Most striking was the disparity in wages. Although women made up just under half the workforce and had a tradition of working outside the home, they earned only about two-thirds of the wages paid to men. Occupations in which women predominated, such as those of retail and office personnel, were poorly paid in contrast to those in which men constituted the majority. Despite the sexes&#x27; equal educational attainments, and despite a society where sexual differentiation played a smaller role than it did in many other countries, occupational segregation in Finland was marked. In a few of the twenty most common occupations were the two sexes equally represented. Only in occupations relating to agriculture, forestry, and school teaching was a rough parity approached, and as few as 6 percent of Finns worked in jobs where 40 to 60 percent of workers were of the opposite sex. Studies also found that equal educational levels did not—in any category of training—prevent women&#x27;s wages from lagging behind those paid to men. Women tended to occupy lower positions, while males were more often supervisors or managers. This was the case everywhere, whether in schools or universities, in business, in the civil service, or politics at both the local level and the national level.

In addition to occupying a secondary position in the workplace, women had longer workdays because they performed a greater share of household tasks than did men. On the average, their workweek outside the home was several hours shorter than men&#x27;s because a greater number of them were employed only part-time or worked in the service sector, where hours were shorter than they were in manufacturing. Studies have found, however, that women spent about twice as much time on housework as men—about three hours and forty minutes a day, compared with one hour and fifty minutes for men. Men did twice as many household repairs and about an equal amount of shopping, but they devoted only one-third to one-fourth as much time to cleaning, cooking, and caring for children. Given that the bulk of family chores fell to women, and that they were five times more likely than men to head a single-parent family, the shortcomings of Finland&#x27;s child day-care system affected women more than it did men.
The Equality Law that went into effect in 1987 committed the country to achieve full equality for women. In the late 1980s, there was a timetable listing specific goals to be achieved during the remainder of the 20th century. The emphasis was equality for everyone, rather than protection for women. Efforts were undertaken not only to place women in occupations dominated by males but also to bring males into fields traditionally believed to belong to the women&#x27;s sphere, such as child care and elementary school teaching. Another aim was for women to occupy a more equal share of decision-making positions.

Since the 1986 Equality Act, a number of updates have been made. The most recent, the Non-Discrimination Act passed in 2015, prohibited discrimination based on gender identity or gender expression and a gender equality plan requirement was extended to comprehensive schools and employers. It also made pay surveys more precise, a was established, and the independent position of the was strengthened. It has been clarified that in the Equality Act, the phrase &#x27;gender identity&#x27; refers to an individual&#x27;s experience of their own gender, through clothing, behaviour, or by other means.

=== Family structure ===
The Finnish family life is usually understood to be centered on the nuclear family, rather than the extended family. There are usually one or two children in a family. Traditionally, men were the wage-earners and women remained in the home and cared for children. However, since the Second World War, gender roles have changed. Today, both men and women are dual wage-earners. The welfare system allows for generous parental leave with income-based benefits. Finnish parents have the option to take partial or total leave they are entitled to. A majority of mothers opt to take longer leave, up to one year. Finland&#x27;s divorce rate is 51% of marriages being dissolved (Statistics Finland, updated 5/07). Cohabitation is also common. Finland has the highest proportion of quarter lifers, (those in their twenties) who have left the nest (i.e. no longer live with parents) in Europe.

=== Etiquette ===
Finnish people are stereotyped as being very introverted, having little interest in small talk, and being very protective of their personal space. This was the subject of a 2005 book &quot;Finland: Cultural Lone Wolf&quot; by Richard Lewis. In October 2018, the BBC published an article on this subject.

=== Economic equality ===
The Finnish society encourages equality and liberalism with a popular commitment to the ideals of the welfare state; discouraging disparity of wealth and division into social classes. Everyman&#x27;s right (Ministry of Environment, 1999) is a philosophy carried over from ancient times. All citizens have access to public and private lands for agrarian activities or leisure. Finns value being close to nature; the agricultural roots are embedded in the rural lifestyle. Finns are also nationalistic, as opposed to self-identification with ethnicity or clan.

With the emergence of reform, the Compulsory Education Act made education a civil right and available to all citizens, except for tertiary education, which is free of charge, and admissions are based strictly on test scores. The beliefs of the Finns are future employment security necessitating higher education in today&#x27;s increasingly technological world.

== Religion ==

Prior to the Christianization of Finland in the 11th century, Finnish paganism was the primary religion. Song magic and bear worship were distinctive marks of the ancient religion. A contemporary revival of the belief system exists, called &quot;suomenusko&quot;.

Christianity entered Finnish culture in the 12th century. As in 2016, 72.8% of Finns belong to the Evangelical Lutheran Church and 1.1% belong to the Finnish Orthodox Church.

== Holidays and festivals ==
Finnish holidays are similar to the Western Christian calendar and Protestant traditions. Holidays and traditions are a blend of the thousand year old Christian presence and vestiges of old Finnish pagan traditions.

Notable among these is &quot;Juhannus&quot;, the Finnish Midsummer. A majority of Finns retreat to summer cottages (&quot;mökki&quot;) on any one of Finland&#x27;s numerous lakes. Depending on the region, a bonfire at midnight celebrates the summer solstice, and in Åland, the Swedish-originated tradition of dancing around the Maypole is observed. The midsummer traditions also include different versions of pairing magic and folklore in the festivities. Midsummer Day is also Flag Day in Finland.

The Finnish Christmas, &quot;Joulu&quot;, follows traditions of Christmas trees and the Advent calendars. Holidays start on 23 December. Gift giving occurs on Christmas Eve with a visit from Joulupukki (Father Christmas, Santa Claus). Traditional meals are typically only eaten on Christmas followed by sauna. Christmas Day is reserved for a &quot;quiet day&quot; and the holidays end after the 26th, St. Stephen&#x27;s Day (&quot;tapaninpäivä&quot;).

Easter is a combination of Christian and Pagan customs. Either on Palm Sunday or the Holy Saturday, children dress up as witches (&quot;noita&quot;) and go from door to door, giving away daffodil adorned branches of willow in exchange for sweets. This is similar to the celebration of Halloween in some countries (such as the United Kingdom and the United States). Burning Easter bonfires is a Pagan custom meant to keep witches at bay.

Vappu, or May Day is a national holiday, an event for Finns to emphatically welcome spring after several months of little daylight. It can be compared to Mardi Gras with parades and parties. Traditionally, the event begins on the eve of Vappu by former and current students putting on their student caps (graduation cap).

Finnish Independence Day is 6 December and a national holiday.

=== Public holidays ===

All official holidays in Finland are established by acts of Parliament. The official holidays can be divided into Christian and secular holidays. The main Christian holidays are Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Ascension Day, Pentecost, and All Saints&#x27; Day. The secular holidays are New Year&#x27;s Day, May Day, Midsummer Day, and the Independence Day. Christmas is the most extensively celebrated holiday: usually at least 24 to 26 December are holidays.

== Sauna ==

Sauna is a type of dry steam bath practiced widely in Finland. The word is of Proto-Finnish origin (found in Finnic and Sámi languages) dating back 7,000 years. The sauna&#x27;s purpose is to bathe, and the heat (either dry or steam) opens pores in the skin and thoroughly cleanses the body. Cedar or birch branches can be tapped along the body to stimulate blood circulation. The sauna soothes sore and aching muscles. The Finns often use and have used the sauna to recover from hard physical labor. Sauna culture dictates subdued speech and time for thought to soothe the mind. Sauna is not to be rushed as it is essential to spiritual living. The structure of the sauna began as a small log building partially buried in the earth. A &quot;smoke sauna&quot; was used to cure meats in pre-industrial years as well as, to bathe or a sterile environment for childbirth, but this tradition has declined in favor of a modern invention, the continuously heated sauna, which is hotter, cleaner and faster to heat up. In Finnish saunas, temperature is set to about 60–100 °C (sometimes up to 120 °C), and small amounts of water thrown on rocks atop the stove emit steam, which produces a heat sensation. Some Finns prefer the &quot;dry sauna&quot; using very little steam if any. Traditional sauna includes the process of perspiring and cooling several times. A part of the cooling process is a swim in the lake before returning to the sauna for an additional sweat.

Steam baths have been part of European tradition elsewhere as well, but the sauna has survived best in Finland, in addition to Sweden, the Baltic States, Russia, Norway, and parts of the United States and Canada. Moreover, nearly all Finnish houses have either their own sauna or in multistory apartment houses, a timeshare sauna. Public saunas were previously common, but the tradition has declined when saunas have been built nearly everywhere (private homes, municipal swimming halls, hotels, corporate headquarters, gyms, etc.).

== Literature ==
Though Finnish written language could be said to exist since Mikael Agricola translated the New Testament into Finnish in the 16th century as a result of the Protestant Reformation, few notable works of literature were written until the 19th century, which saw the beginning of a Finnish national Romantic Movement. This prompted Elias Lönnrot to collect Finnish and Karelian folk poetry and arrange and publish them as &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the Finnish national epic. The era saw a rise of poets and novelists who wrote in Finnish, notably Aleksis Kivi and Eino Leino. Juhani Aho was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature twelve times.

After Finland became independent there was a rise of modernist writers, most famously Mika Waltari. Frans Eemil Sillanpää was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1939, so far the only Nobel prize-winning Finnish author. The Second World War prompted a return to more national interests in comparison to a more international line of thought, characterized by Väinö Linna. Literature in modern Finland is in a healthy state, with detective stories enjoying a particular boom of popularity. Ilkka Remes, a Finnish author of thrillers, is very popular. Juha Vuorinen has received the Kultapokkari (&#x27;Golden Paperback&#x27;) award for his humorous books, and in all has sold over two million books in Finland.

The works of Tove Jansson has become a staple in modern Finnish culture, her Moomin books has influenced a large media franchise, spawning visual media, art, museums, amusement parks and merchandise (like Moomin mugs) common in the Finnish home.

== Visual arts ==
Innovative functionalist movements have distinguished design of furniture, ceramics, glass, and textiles as well the Finnish architecture. Finnish design combines local artistic themes with tools and materials adapted to demanding northern conditions. Many artists and architects, from Akseli Gallen-Kallela to Alvar Aalto, have designed furniture and tableware during their career.

Forces, shapes, colors, and textures of the northern landscape and the human relationship to nature have strongly influenced also painting, sculpture, and other art forms. This is particularly evident in the representational romantic nationalism that blossomed at the end of the 19th century.

Abstract art movements did not gain a foothold until the 1950s. When Sam Vanni&#x27;s monumental painting &quot;&quot; (1959) won competition for mural in Helsinki, abstract art was considered to be accepted and established in Finland. In recent years, however, graphic artists have experimented with innovative processes of image production and multimedia technologies to create new forms of art that sometimes serve as critiques of society and technology.

The Finnish contemporary art scene became much more visible than before with the establishment of Kiasma, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki in 1998.

== Architecture ==
The architecture of Finland has a notable history spanning over 800 years. As a land of predominating forests, wood provided the natural building material for both housing and public buildings up until the 20th century. The more limited history of stone buildings before the 19th century was realised, however, in various stone churches, castles and fortresses. Finnish architecture has contributed significantly to several styles internationally, such as Jugendstil (or Art Nouveau), Nordic Classicism and Functionalism.

Three of the world&#x27;s most noted figures in architecture history were Finns; Eliel Saarinen was a major influence in Art Nouveau architecture, with such buildings as the Helsinki Central railway station and, following his emigration to the US, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan. His son, Eero Saarinen, though born in Finland is also regarded as an American architect, and created significant pieces of architecture throughout the US, including the TWA Flight Center at New York&#x27;s Kennedy Airport and the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. The works of Finland&#x27;s most noted modernist architect, Alvar Aalto, regarded as one of the major figures in the world history of modern architecture, has had significant worldwide influence; he was instrumental in bringing functionalist architecture to Finland, but also made his reputation for developing a more organic style of modernist architecture. Among his most famous buildings are Viipuri Library, Vyborg and the Baker House dormitory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, US. Aalto is also famous for his work in furniture (e.g. the ) and glassware (e.g. Savoy vase).

== Music ==


=== Folk music ===
Much of the folk music of Finland is influenced by traditional eastern Finnish e.g. Karelian melodies and lyrics, and the western parts of the country were influenced by Nordic dance music. Traditional form of singing, rune-singing i.e. poem singing was preserved better in the eastern Finland, and it was often accompanied by the traditional instrument kantele. This type of music is often seen as more pure form of traditional music, since it lacks Germanic influence. Since Nordic dance music became popular the popularity of the poem singing has been diminishing, but Finnish folk music has undergone a roots revival in recent decades and has become a part of popular music, for example, the group Värttinä.

=== Sami music ===
The people of northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway, the Sami, are known primarily for highly spiritual songs called Joik. The same word sometimes refers to lavlu or vuelie songs, though this is technically incorrect.

=== Classical and opera ===

The first Finnish opera was written by the German composer Fredrik Pacius in 1852. Pacius also wrote &quot;Maamme/Vårt land&quot; (Our Land), Finland&#x27;s national anthem. In the 1890s Finnish nationalism based on the &quot;Kalevala&quot; spread, and Jean Sibelius became famous for his vocal symphony &quot;Kullervo&quot;. He soon received a grant to study &quot;runo&quot; singers in Karelia and continued his rise as the first prominent Finnish musician. In 1899 he composed Finlandia, which played its important role in Finland gaining independence. He remains one of Finland&#x27;s most popular national figures and is a symbol of the nation.

Today, Finland has a very lively classical music scene. Finnish classical music has only existed for about a hundred years. Notable composers include Magnus Lindberg, Kaija Saariaho, Aulis Sallinen, and Einojuhani Rautavaara. The composers are accompanied by a large number of great conductors such as Sakari Oramo, Mikko Franck, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Osmo Vänskä, Jukka-Pekka Saraste, Susanna Mälkki, and Leif Segerstam. Some of the internationally acclaimed Finnish classical musicians are Karita Mattila, Soile Isokoski, Kari Kriikku, Pekka Kuusisto, Réka Szilvay, and Linda Brava.

=== Popular music ===
Modern Finnish popular music includes a renowned heavy metal music scene, in common with other Nordic countries, as well as a number of prominent rock bands, hip hop performers, pop music and dance music acts such as Bomfunk MCs, Darude and Waldo&#x27;s People.
Jazz also plays a role in the Finnish Music scene. Some important Jazz Musicians are the brothers Heikki and Pekka Sarmanto, Jukka Linkola, Keith Hall (UK), Esko Linnavalli and Vladimir Schafranov (Russia). There are numerous Jazz Clubs in Finland, such as Storyville, The Hot Tomato and UMO Jazz Club (UMO is the acronym for Uuden Musiikin Orkesteri, meaning the&quot;New Music Orchestra).
Finnish electronic music such as the Sähkö Recordings record label enjoys underground acclaim. &quot;Iskelmä&quot; (coined directly from the German word &quot;Schlager&quot;, meaning &quot;hit&quot;) is a traditional Finnish word for a light popular song. Finnish popular music also includes various kinds of dance music; tango, a style of Argentine music, is also popular. One of the most productive composers of popular music was Toivo Kärki, and the most famous singer Olavi Virta (1915–1972). Among the lyricists, (1928–2014), Reino Helismaa (died 1965) and Veikko &quot;Vexi&quot; Salmi are a few of the most notable writers. The composer and bandleader Jimi Tenor is well known for his brand of retro-funk music.

=== Dance music ===
Notable Finnish dance and electronic music artists include Jori Hulkkonen, Darude, JS16, , Fanu, , trance duo Super8 &amp; Tab and DJ Orkidea. Finnish dance music is also known for Suomisaundi, a kind of freestyle psychedelic trance that originated in Finland around the mid-1990s.

=== Rock and heavy metal music ===

The Finnish rock music scene emerged in the 1960s, pioneered by artists such as Blues Section and Kirka. In the 1970s Finnish rock musicians started to write their own music instead of translating international hits into Finnish. During the decade some progressive rock groups, such as Tasavallan Presidentti and Wigwam, gained respect abroad but failed to make a commercial breakthrough outside Finland. This was also the fate of the rock and roll group, Hurriganes. The Finnish punk scene produced some internationally respected names including Terveet Kädet in the 1980s. Hanoi Rocks was a pioneering 1980s glam rock act that left perhaps a deeper mark in the history of popular music than any other Finnish group by being an influence for groups such as Guns N&#x27; Roses.

In 1990s Finnish rock and metal music started to gain international fame with such bands as The 69 Eyes, Amorphis, Children of Bodom, Ensiferum, Norther, Wintersun, HIM, Impaled Nazarene, Lordi, Negative, Nightwish, The Rasmus, Sentenced, Sonata Arctica, Stratovarius, and Tarja Turunen, a solo artist, who is popular for mixing classical music with Metal/Rock. In the late 1990s the cello metal group Apocalyptica played Metallica cover versions as cello quartettos and sold half a million records worldwide. Some of the Finland&#x27;s most domestically popular rock groups are CMX and Eppu Normaali. Finland also helped bring Folk Metal music more popularity, through bands such as Turisas and Finntroll.

In the 2000s Finnish rock bands started to sell well internationally. The Rasmus finally captured Europe (and other places, like South America) in the 2000s. Their 2003 album &quot;Dead Letters&quot; sold 1.5 million units worldwide and garnered them eight gold and five platinum albums designations. But so far the most successful Finnish band in the United States has been HIM; they were the first band from Finland to ever sell an album that was certified gold by the RIAA. Most recently, the Finnish hard rock/heavy metal band Lordi won the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest with a record 292 points, giving Finland its first ever victory. Rock bands such as The 69 Eyes and Indica enjoy cult following abroad.

Tuska Open Air Metal Festival, one of the largest open-air heavy metal music festivals in the world, is held annually in Kaisaniemi, Helsinki. Ruisrock and Provinssirock are the most famous rock festivals held in Finland.

== Entertainment and games ==

The first commercial Finnish digital game was published in 1979 and the first globally distributed game in 1986. In 2009, &quot;Angry Birds&quot; of Rovio Entertainment became the big hit. Rovio is a Finnish developer, publisher, distributor of video games and is an entertainment company headquartered in Espoo, Finland. Also, Remedy Entertainment, notable for creating games such as &quot;Max Payne&quot;, &quot;Alan Wake&quot;, &quot;Quantum Break&quot; and &quot;Control&quot;, were established in Espoo.

The throwing game of Mölkky originated in Finland.

== Cinema ==


Finland has a growing film industry with a number of famous directors such as Aki Kaurismäki, Timo Koivusalo, Aleksi Mäkelä and Klaus Härö. Hollywood film director/producer Renny Harlin (born Lauri Mauritz Harjola) was born in Finland.

== Media and communications ==

Finland is one of the most advanced information societies in the world. There are 200 newspapers; 320 popular magazines, 2,100 professional magazines and 67 commercial radio stations, with one nationwide, six national public service radio channels (three in Finnish, two in Swedish, one in Sami); digital radio has three channels. Four national analog television channels (two public services and two commercial) were fully replaced by five public services and three commercial digital television channels on 1 September 2007.
Broadband access is a legal right, and by 2015 over 93% of population was online.

In 2015, 95% of Finns read a newspaper (in print or online) at least once per week – which was the highest value in countries compared by Reuters (including Denmark (87%) UK (73%) and USA (56%). The most read newspaper in Finland is &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot;, with a circulation of 267,000. The media group Sanoma behind &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; also publishes the newspaper &quot;Aamulehti&quot;, tabloid &quot;Ilta-Sanomat&quot; and commerce-oriented &quot;Taloussanomat&quot;. It also owns the Nelonen television channel. Sanoma&#x27;s largest shareholders are Aatos Erkko&#x27;s family foundation and Antti Herlin. The other major publisher Alma Media publishes almost thirty magazines, including tabloid &quot;Iltalehti&quot; and commerce-oriented &quot;Kauppalehti&quot;. Finland has been at the top of the worldwide Press Freedom Index list every year since the publication of the first index by Reporters Without Borders in 2002.

In 2015, there were 765 public libraries, which were visited over 49 million times. Over 10,000 books and 46 daily (4–7 times a week) newspapers were published. 311 movie theatres showed 202 new films.

Finland&#x27;s National Broadcasting Company Yle is an independent state-owned company. It has five television channels and 13 radio channels in two national languages. Yle is funded through a television license and private television broadcasting license fees. Ongoing transformation to digital TV broadcasting is in progress – analog broadcasts ceased on the terrestrial network 31 August 2007 on cable at the end of February 2008. The most popular television channel MTV3 and the most popular radio channel Radio Nova are owned by Nordic Broadcasting (Bonnier and Proventus).

The people of Finland are accustomed to technology and information services. The number of cellular phone subscribers as well as the number of Internet connections per capita in Finland is among the highest in the world. According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Finnish mobile phone penetration exceeded fifty percent of the population as far back as August 1998 – first in the world – and by December 1998 the number of cell phone subscriptions outnumbered fixed-line phone connections. By the end of June 2007, there were 5.78 million cellular phone subscriptions, or 109 percent of the population.

Another fast-growing sector is the use of the Internet. Finland had more than 1.52 million broadband Internet connections by the end of June 2007 (about 287 per 1,000 inhabitants). The Finns are not only connected; they are heavy users of Internet services. All Finnish schools and public libraries have been connected to the Internet for years.

Finland is also internationally known for major demoscene achievements, particularly due to Assembly, the largest annual demo party.

== Cuisine ==

Traditional Finnish cuisine is a combination of European, Fennoscandian and Western Russian elements; table manners are European. The food is generally simple, fresh and healthy. Historically, Finns have relied on the abundant natural resources of their country, drawing sustenance from its vast forests and lakes. When crops failed, survival was sustained through the consumption of fish sourced from the sea and lakes, game hunted from the wilderness, as well as mushrooms and berries gathered from the forests and fields. Meat, berries, milk and ground vegetables are typical ingredients whereas spices are not common due to their historical unavailability. 

Finland is widely renowned for its rich bread culture, exemplified by its diverse range of breads, from sour rye to kalakukko – a &quot;fish rooster&quot; encased in a hearty rye crust. These &quot;roosters&quot; come in many varieties, originally developed as a way to preserve food. The thick rye crust ensured the filling wouldn&#x27;t spoil during long journeys.

Various casseroles based on root vegetables are also a popular staple in Finnish cuisine. Some include lanttulaatikko, made primarily from rutabaga mixed with syrup, breadcrumbs, and often seasoned with spices like nutmeg, porkkanalaatikko, made with carrots, ground pork (sometimes mixed with ground beef), rice, and seasoned with spices like allspice or black pepper, and perunasoselaatikko, made from mashed potatoes mixed with milk, butter, and sometimes eggs. 

Finland imports just 9% of its consumed meat, with a per capita meat consumption of sixty-six kilograms per person, the lowest in Europe. In years past, Finnish food often varied from region to region, most notably between the west and east. In coastal and lakeside villages, fish was a main feature of cooking, whereas, in the eastern and also northern regions, vegetables and game were more common. In Finnish Lapland, reindeer was also important. 

The prototypical breakfast is oatmeal or other continental-style foods such as bread. Lunch is usually a full warm meal, served by a canteen at workplaces. Dinner is eaten at around 17.00 to 18.00 at home, and it is also common to have supper later in the evening.

Modern Finnish cuisine combines country fare and haute cuisine with contemporary continental cooking style. Today, spices are a prominent ingredient in many modern Finnish recipes, having been adopted from the east and west in recent decades.

== Sports ==


Various sporting events are popular in Finland. Pesäpallo (reminiscent of baseball) is the national sport of Finland, although the most popular sports in Finland in terms of media coverage and audience attendance are Formula One, ice hockey, track and field, football and harness racing. However, in terms of actually playing sports, the most popular ones in terms of people registered to a club are football and horse-riding.

The Finnish national ice hockey team is considered one of the best in the world and has won the world championships four times in 1995, 2011, 2019 and 2022. During the past century there has been a rivalry in sporting between Finland and Sweden, mostly in ice hockey and athletics (Finland-Sweden athletics international). Jari Kurri and Teemu Selänne are the two Finnish-born ice hockey players to have scored 500 goals in their NHL careers. Association football is also popular in Finland, with the national football team recently qualifying for the European Football Championships 2021, their first major international tournament. Jari Litmanen and Sami Hyypiä are the most internationally renowned of the Finnish football players.

Relative to its population, Finland has been a top country in the world in automobile racing, measured by international success. Finland has produced three Formula One World Champions – Keke Rosberg (Williams, 1982), Mika Häkkinen (McLaren, 1998 and 1999) and Kimi Räikkönen (Ferrari, 2007). Along with Räikkönen, the other Finnish Formula One driver currently active is Valtteri Bottas. Other notable Finnish Grand Prix drivers include Leo Kinnunen, JJ Lehto, Mika Salo and Heikki Kovalainen. Finland has also produced most of the world&#x27;s best rally drivers, including the ex-WRC World Champion drivers Marcus Grönholm, Juha Kankkunen, Hannu Mikkola, Tommi Mäkinen, Timo Salonen and Ari Vatanen. The only Finn to have won a road racing World Championship, Jarno Saarinen, was killed in 1973 while racing.

Among winter sports, Finland has been the most successful country in ski jumping, with former ski jumper Matti Nykänen being arguably the best ever in that sport. Most notably, he won five Olympic medals (four gold) and nine World Championships medals (five gold). Among currently active Finnish ski jumpers, Janne Ahonen has been the most successful. Kalle Palander is a well-known alpine skiing winner, who won the World Championship and Crystal Ball (twice, in Kitzbühel). Tanja Poutiainen has won an Olympic silver medal for alpine skiing, as well as multiple FIS World Cup races.

Some of the most outstanding athletes from the past include Hannes Kolehmainen (1890–1966), Paavo Nurmi (1897–1973) and Ville Ritola (1896–1982) who won eighteen gold and seven silver Olympic medals in the 1910s and 1920s. They are also considered to be the first of a generation of great Finnish middle and long-distance runners (and subsequently, other great Finnish sportsmen) often named the &quot;Flying Finns&quot;. Another long-distance runner, Lasse Virén (born 1949), won a total of four gold medals during the 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics.

Also, in the past, Riku Kiri, Jouko Ahola and Janne Virtanen have been the greatest strength athletes in the country, participating in the World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition between 1993 and 2000.

The 1952 Summer Olympics, officially known as the &quot;Games of the XV Olympiad&quot;, were held in 1952 in Helsinki, Finland. Other notable sporting events held in Finland include the 1983 and 2005 World Championships in Athletics, among others.

Some of the most popular recreational sports and activities include floorball, Nordic walking, running, cycling and skiing.

== International business ==

Finns are comfortable and adept at working in international contexts, if notably reserved in demeanor. Many Finnish corporations do business throughout the Nordic and Baltic region, as well as globally. There is a strong tradition of professional business etiquette, focused more on relationship-building and effective communications than on superficial protocols and they prefer to speak plainly and openly; however, they do not need personal relationships in order to conduct business. Many major corporations, such as Nokia, actively draw staff from around the globe and may use English as their house language. As English is a required subject, the majority of Finns (70%) have fluency for social and professional settings. Hosting international conferences is an important component of Helsinki&#x27;s economy.

<doc id="600923" wikidata="Q7549605" url="?curid=600923" title="So Why So Sad">
<text>&quot;So Why So Sad&quot; is a song by Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers, jointly released in February 2001 as the first single from their sixth studio album, &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; (2001), alongside &quot;Found That Soul&quot;. All three members of the band—James Dean Bradfield, Sean Moore and Nicky Wire—share the writing credits. The song reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart, one place above &quot;Found That Soul&quot;.

==Background==
The song includes the line &quot;burns an expressway to your skull&quot;, a reference to the final track on Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;EVOL&quot; album and a Buddy Miles song. The song deals mainly with the paradoxical high rates of depression and anxiety experienced by those living in affluence and comfort. It has also been suggested that a reference to the Dead Sea scrolls and the line &quot;dependent on above&quot; imply that there is a religious connection, but there&#x27;s no further support for this outside the chorus. The single version is shorter, with the phrase &quot;So Why, So Why So Sad?&quot; sung only three times instead of four at the end and the drums finish two bars earlier without a fill.

&quot;Exclaim! Canada&quot; called the track &quot;an outstanding pop song&quot; with a production style &quot;scarily similar&quot; to the Beach Boys. It was the only single from &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; to be included on the 2002 compilation &quot;Forever Delayed&quot;, appearing as an edited version.

==Release==
The CD version of &quot;So Why So Sad&quot; includes versions of &quot;Pedestal&quot; and a remix of &quot;So Why So Sad&quot; by Australian outfit the Avalanches, whereas the cassette single includes a live version of &quot;You Stole the Sun from My Heart&quot;. Issued on 26 February 2001, the same day as &quot;Found That Soul&quot;, &quot;So Why So Sad&quot; was the Manic Street Preachers&#x27; first hit since &quot;The Masses Against the Classes&quot; thirteen months earlier. 

The single reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart on 10 March 2001. Spending sixteen weeks on the chart, it is the second-longest charting Manic Street Preachers single in the UK, after &quot;If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next&quot;, which spent seventeen weeks on the chart. In Ireland, it peaked at number 16. In Finland, the single reached number four on the Finnish Singles Chart, spending three weeks on the ranking. In Sweden, it reached number 26, while in the Netherlands, it peaked at number 88. In Germany, it reached number 94.

==Track listings==
All tracks were written and composed by Nick Jones, James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore.

<doc id="600925" wikidata="Q727742" url="?curid=600925" title="Propylene oxide">
<text>Propylene oxide is an acutely toxic and carcinogenic organic compound with the molecular formula C3H6O. This colourless volatile liquid with an odour similar to ether, is produced on a large scale industrially. Its major application is its use for the production of polyether polyols for use in making polyurethane plastics. It is a chiral epoxide, although it is commonly used as a racemic mixture.

This compound is sometimes called 1,2-propylene oxide to distinguish it from its isomer 1,3-propylene oxide, better known as oxetane.

==Production==
Industrial production of propylene oxide starts from propylene. Two general approaches are employed, one involving hydrochlorination and the other involving oxidation. In 2005, about half of the world production was through chlorohydrin technology and one half via oxidation routes. The latter approach is growing in importance.

===Hydrochlorination route===
The traditional route proceeds via the conversion of propene to propylene chlorohydrin according to the following simplified scheme:

The mixture of 1-chloro-2-propanol and 2-chloro-1-propanol is then dehydrochlorinated. For example:

Lime (calcium hydroxide) is often used to absorb the HCl.

===Oxidation of propylene===
The other general route to propylene oxide involves oxidation of propylene with an organic peroxide. The reaction follows this stoichiometry:

:CH3CH=CH2 + RO2H → CH3CHCH2O + ROH

The process is practiced with four hydroperoxides:
*In the Halcon process, &quot;t&quot;-Butyl hydroperoxide derived from oxygenation of isobutane, which affords &quot;t&quot;-butanol. This coproduct can be dehydrated to isobutene, converted to MTBE, an additive for gasoline.
* Ethylbenzene hydroperoxide, derived from oxygenation of ethylbenzene, which affords 1-phenylethanol. This coproduct can be dehydrated to give styrene, a useful monomer.
*Cumene hydroperoxide derived from oxygenation of cumene (isopropylbenzene), which affords cumyl alcohol. Via dehydration and hydrogenation this coproduct can be recycled back to cumene. This technology was commercialized by Sumitomo Chemical.
*Hydrogen peroxide is the oxidant in the hydrogen peroxide to propylene oxide (HPPO) process, catalyzed by a titanium-doped silicalite:
*:C3H6 + H2O2 → C3H6O + H2O

In principle, this process produces only water as a side product. In practice, some ring-opened derivatives of PO are generated.

Propylene oxide is chiral building block that is commercially available in either enantiomeric form ((&quot;R&quot;)-(+) and (&quot;S&quot;)-(–)). The separated enantiomers can be obtained through a Co(III)-salen-catalyzed hydrolytic kinetic resolution of the racemic material.

== Reactions ==
Like other epoxides, PO undergoes ring-opening reactions. With water, propylene glycol is produced. With alcohols, reactions, called hydroxylpropylation, analogous to ethoxylation occur. Grignard reagents add to propylene oxide to give secondary alcohols.

Some other reactions of propylene oxide include:
* Reaction with aluminium oxide at 250–260 °C leads to propionaldehyde and a little acetone.
* Reaction with silver(I) oxide leads to acetic acid.
* Reaction with sodium–mercury amalgam and water leads to isopropanol.

==Uses==
Between 60 and 70% of all propylene oxide is converted to polyether polyols by the process called alkoxylation. These polyols are building blocks in the production of polyurethane plastics. About 20% of propylene oxide is hydrolyzed into propylene glycol, via a process which is accelerated by acid or base catalysis. Other major products are polypropylene glycol, propylene glycol ethers, and propylene carbonate.

===Niche uses===

====Fumigant====
The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of propylene oxide to pasteurize raw almonds beginning on September 1, 2007, in response to two incidents of contamination by &quot;Salmonella&quot; in commercial orchards, one incident occurring in Canada and one in the United States.
Pistachio nuts can also be subjected to propylene oxide to control &quot;Salmonella&quot;.

====Microscopy====
Propylene oxide is commonly used in the preparation of biological samples for electron microscopy, to remove residual ethanol previously used for dehydration. In a typical procedure, the sample is first immersed in a mixture of equal volumes of ethanol and propylene oxide for 5 minutes, and then four times in pure oxide, 10 minutes each.

====Munition====
Propylene oxide is sometimes used in thermobaric munitions as the fuel in fuel–air explosives. In addition to the explosive damage from the blast wave, unexploded propylene oxide can cause additional effects from direct toxicity.

==Safety==
Propylene oxide is both acutely toxic and carcinogenic. Acute exposure causes respiratory tract irritation, eventually leading to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAC/AEGL&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Signs of toxicity after acute exposure include salivation, lacrimation, nasal discharge, gasping, lethargy and hypoactivity, weakness, and incoordination. Propylene oxide is also neurotoxic in rats, and presumably in humans. Propylene oxide alkylates DNA and is considered a mutagen for both animals and humans. Pregnant rats exposed to 500ppm of propylene oxide for less than 8 hours gave birth to litters with significant deformities and weight deficiencies. Similar exposure has also shown to reduce animal fertility. As such, it is a known animal carcinogen and potential human carcinogen, and is included into the List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens.

Propylene oxide is an extremely flammable liquid, and its vapors can form explosive mixtures with air at concentrations as low as 2.3% (Lower Explosive Limit). Propylene oxide vapor is twice as dense as air. When exposed to an open atmosphere, the vapor can accumulate in low-lying areas while spreading out over long distances and reach ignition source, causing flashback or an explosion. When heated, propylene oxide can rapidly self-polymerize and decompose producing other toxic gases such as carbon monoxide and various free radicals. Propylene oxide fires are especially dangerous and difficult for firefighters to extinguish. In a fire, sealed tanks of propylene oxide should be cooled with fire hoses to prevent explosion from self-polymerization. When burning in open air however, water can transport propylene oxide outside of the fire zone which can reignite upon floating to the surface. Additional firefighting measures should be taken to prevent propylene oxide from washing out to nearby drains and sewers contaminating the surrounding environment.

==Natural occurrence==
In 2016 it was reported that propylene oxide was detected in Sagittarius B2, a cloud of gas in the Milky Way weighing three million solar masses. It is the first chiral molecule to be detected in space, albeit with no enantiomeric excess.

<doc id="600929" wikidata="Q5474276" url="?curid=600929" title="Found That Soul">
<text>&quot;Found That Soul&quot; is a single by the Manic Street Preachers, released on 26 February 2001 from the &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; album. Writing credit was shared by all three members of the band, James Dean Bradfield, Sean Moore and Nicky Wire. The song reached number 9 in the UK Singles Chart.

==Launch==

Launched on the same day as &quot;So Why So Sad&quot;, this was the first release by the &quot;Manics&quot; since the number one hit &quot;The Masses Against the Classes&quot; thirteen months earlier. It reached a UK chart position of number 9 on 10 March 2001, in the same week that &quot;So Why So Sad&quot; reached number 8. Fewer than 200 copies separated &quot;Found That Soul&quot; from &quot;So Why So Sad&quot;, placing it one place lower at number 9. Despite making the top ten it wasn&#x27;t included on the band&#x27;s greatest hits album, &quot;Forever Delayed&quot;, making it the band&#x27;s only top ten single at the time of the compilation&#x27;s release not to appear.

The CD also included versions of &quot;Locust Valley&quot; and &quot;Ballad of the Bangkok Novotel,&quot; whereas the 7&quot; included a live version of &quot;The Masses Against the Classes&quot;. &quot;Ballad of the Bangkok Novotel&quot; is entirely sung by Nicky Wire. In Benjamin Millar&#x27;s review of &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; for &quot;The Blurb&quot;, he described &quot;Found That Soul&quot; which &quot;gets us off to a manic and electric start, a sonic attack that makes a huge noise for a three-piece.&quot;

<doc id="600933" wikidata="Q725373" url="?curid=600933" title="Boomer Esiason">
<text>Norman Julius&quot;Boomer&quot;Esiason (; born April 17, 1961) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons, primarily with the Cincinnati Bengals. He played college football for the Maryland Terrapins and was selected in the second round of the 1984 NFL draft by the Bengals, where he spent 10 non-consecutive seasons. Esiason was also a member of the New York Jets and Arizona Cardinals.

Esiason&#x27;s most successful season was in 1988 when he won NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) and led the Bengals to an appearance in Super Bowl XXIII, which ended in a close defeat. He was also named to four Pro Bowls and one first-team All-Pro. After nine years in Cincinnati, Esiason spent three seasons with the Jets and one season with the Cardinals before returning to the Bengals for his final season in 1997.

Since retiring from football, Esiason has worked as a football analyst for CBS Sports on &quot;The NFL Today&quot; and Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; and was previously with ABC, HBO, and Westwood One. He also hosts the morning sports radio program &quot;Boomer and Gio&quot; on WFAN in New York.

==Early life==
Esiason was born and raised in East Islip, New York. He got the &quot;Boomer&quot; nickname before he was born. His mother Irene, reacting to his constant kicking in the womb, called him &quot;Boomer,&quot; and he has kept the name since. Irene, a singer, dancer and piano player, from whom he inherited his blond hair and blue eyes, died at the age of 37, of ovarian cancer when he was seven years old. His father Norman, a veteran of WWII, never remarried, and in spite of a three-hour daily commute to New York City raised Esiason and his two sisters. His father was of Norwegian and Swedish descent; grandmother Nora Ingrid Gulbrandsen was born in Norway and his grandfather Fritz Henning Esiason was born in Sweden. His father was the cousin of Norwegian actress and singer Sølvi Wang.

He attended Timber Point Elementary and East Islip High School, where he graduated in 1979. In high school, he was a three-sport varsity player in football, basketball, and baseball.

==College career==
Esiason played college football at the University of Maryland for head coaches Jerry Claiborne and Bobby Ross and offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen. Maryland was the only college to offer him a scholarship. At Maryland, he set 17 school records. He completed 461 of 850 passes (54.2 percent) for 6,169 yards and 42 touchdowns with 27 interceptions. He was a two-time honorable mention All-American in 1982 and 1983. In his final home game, he threw two third-quarter touchdown passes to lead a comeback victory over No. 3 North Carolina and seal the ACC title. At Maryland, his backup and roommate was future NFL quarterback and head coach Frank Reich. Boomer graduated in 1984 with a B.A., and received the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1999.

==Professional football career==
===Cincinnati Bengals (first stint)===
Esiason was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the second round of the 1984 NFL draft with the 38th overall pick, surprisingly low considering his successful college career. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. was, in Esiason&#x27;s words, &quot;going ballistic&quot; that he was still available in the latter stages of the first round. No quarterbacks were drafted in the first round; Esiason was actually the first quarterback selected, as Steve Young had signed with the L.A. Express of the now-defunct United States Football League. Esiason&#x27;s USFL territorial rights were controlled by the Washington Federals, the worst team in the league.

Esiason&#x27;s teammate from Maryland, defensive end Pete Koch, was taken by the Bengals with the 16th pick in the first round of the same draft. Koch lasted just one season in Cincinnati and five total in the NFL.

At 6&#x27;-5&quot; and 224 pounds, and with a powerful arm, Esiason was the signal caller on one of the most potent offenses of the late 1980s.

Boomer got his first pro start on October 7, 1984, in a home game against the Houston Oilers. On a rainy day, he led the Bengals to a 13–3 win over Houston, and scored the game&#x27;s only touchdown on a three-yard run. He took over for Ken Anderson as the Bengals&#x27; full-time starting quarterback on September 22, 1985, in a 44–41 home loss to the San Diego Chargers and future Hall of Famer Dan Fouts. Although well short of Anderson&#x27;s rushing total of over 2,200 yards, Esiason was surprisingly mobile, rushing for 1,598 yards on 447 attempts and scoring seven touchdowns by this point in his career. He became particularly adept at running the difficult &quot;no huddle&quot; offense devised by Bengals head coach Sam Wyche.

On December 21, 1986, the final game of the 1986 season, Esiason set a team record by throwing five touchdown passes, as the Bengals defeated the New York Jets 52–21. He also set the team single season passing record of 3,959 yards in this game. It was the last game of Bengals&#x27; quarterback Ken Anderson&#x27;s playing career.

After leading Cincinnati to six straight wins to begin the 1988 season, Esiason set a dismal single game team record on October 16 by throwing 5 interceptions in a 27–21 loss to the New England Patriots. The team finished the season 12–4, utilizing the highest scoring offense in the NFL, and securing the organization&#x27;s fifth AFC Central division title. Esiason finished the season as the NFL&#x27;s top rated passer. However, he had sprained his left ankle and the index finger on his throwing hand in the last regular-season game of the season. In the playoffs, Cincinnati, bolstered by rushing, defeated first the Seattle Seahawks and then the Buffalo Bills to reach Super Bowl XXIII, the franchise&#x27;s second appearance in a Super Bowl (after Super Bowl XVI), as they faced off with the team they had lost to the first time around, the San Francisco 49ers.

The Super Bowl was a tight affair that saw a 3–3 halftime score, the first halftime tie in Super Bowl history. Still marred by a sore arm, Esiason threw for 144 yards on 11-of-25 passing with an interception. Cincinnati had their points come on a kickoff return by Stanford Jennings and three field goals by Jim Breech. Bengals cornerback Lewis Billups dropped what seemed like a sure interception in the end zone when they were up 13–6 on a drive that led to a San Francisco touchdown. Despite this, they led 16–13 with three minutes remaining and San Francisco deep in their own territory. The 49ers, led by future Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana, marched 92 yards on their last drive, scoring on a touchdown pass to receiver John Taylor with 34 seconds remaining in the game. A last-ditch pass by Esiason to wide receiver Cris Collinsworth was broken up, resulting in a 20–16 loss for the Bengals.

On October 29, 1989, Esiason tied his own record for touchdown passes in a game with five, as the Bengals demolished the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 56–23. In that same game, the Bengals tied a team record with eight touchdowns.

On October 7, 1990, he threw for 490 yards (a single game team passing record) in a 34–31 victory over the Los Angeles Rams.

===New York Jets===
Before the 1993 season, Esiason was traded to his hometown team, the New York Jets, in exchange for a third round pick that year (which became linebacker Steve Tovar) as well as a conditional second round pick the following year (which did not kick in). The trade reunited Esiason with Bruce Coslet, Esiason&#x27;s mentor as offensive coordinator in Cincinnati, who had been hired by the Jets&#x27; to be their head coach after the Bengals 1988 Super Bowl run. Esiason played three seasons for the Jets, each year under a different head coach: Coslet (1993), Pete Carroll (1994), and Rich Kotite (1995). During his 1995 season with the team, Esiason was seriously injured in a game on October 8 against the Buffalo Bills when rookie Everett McIver was whistled for a false start, and Bruce Smith of the Bills raced around him and caught Esiason under his face mask. Smith was terribly upset about Esiason&#x27;s injury, saying that he hadn&#x27;t heard a whistle blowing the play dead, and Esiason blamed the officials for not whistling until after Smith made contact. That horrific collision gave Esiason a severe concussion, his first as a player. When he returned to the field over a month later, it was coincidentally against the Bills.

Esiason was released by the Jets after the 1995 season.

===Arizona Cardinals===
Esiason signed with the Arizona Cardinals as a free agent in 1996. It was during this season, on November 10, 1996, that he threw for the fifth best passing yardage day in NFL history, with 522 yards in a 37–34 overtime victory over the Washington Redskins. Two weeks later he led a fourth-quarter comeback against the playoff-bound Philadelphia Eagles.

===Cincinnati Bengals (second stint)===
Esiason contemplated retirement in the offseason, but was talked into playing one more season with the Bengals, now with Coslet as coach. He was effective after replacing Jeff Blake midway through the 1997 campaign, throwing for 13 touchdowns against only two interceptions, and garnering a passer rating of 106.9 for the season. The Bengals were 3–8 with Blake under center. With Esiason at quarterback, they won four of their last five games and scored over 30 points four times. Twice they broke 40 points, in a 44–42 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles and in a 41–14 win over the Tennessee Oilers. Esiason debated closely for playing in 1998, since he liked playing for Coslet and QB coach Ken Anderson, stating that a contract offer good enough for him to not refuse would&#x27;ve turned the table for him to return, as he was offered an analyst&#x27;s position on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; for the third year in a row.

On December 21, 1997, Esiason played his last NFL game. He threw two touchdowns on the day, with a 79-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Darnay Scott being his last touchdown pass in a 16–14 victory over the Baltimore Ravens.

==NFL career statistics==


==Records and honors==
Esiason was named to four Pro Bowl games (1986, 1988, 1989, 1993) and holds several NFL career records for left-handed quarterbacks, including most touchdown passes (247), passing yards (37,920), and completions (2,969). He also led the AFC in passing in both 1988 and 1989.

Among the awards he has earned during his career include the NFL Most Valuable Player Award in 1988 (leading the league with a passer rating of 97.4), and the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in 1995 for his charitable work. At his retirement in 1997 he finished in the top 10 all-time in many QB career statistical categories.

Football Nation ranks him as the 25th greatest quarterback of the post-merger era.

Esiason was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame in the Football Category with the Class of 1990. In 2004, he was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame.

In 2023, the Bengals inducted Esiason into their Ring of Honor.

==Entertainment career==

===Television, film and literature===
Esiason has appeared in over 25 commercials including ones for Diet Coke, Wheaties, Reebok, Samsung, Hanes, Doritos and Domino&#x27;s Pizza. He has also appeared in many TV shows and movies, such as &quot;The Game Plan&quot;, &quot;Miss America 1999&quot;, &quot;Spin City&quot;, and &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; among others.

He made two appearances on the game show &quot;Family Feud&quot;. On March 18, 1989, he appeared in the episode &quot;Bengals v. 49ers&quot;, reminiscent of their latest Super Bowl match. In 1993, his second Family Feud appearance came in the episode &quot;NFC v. AFC&quot;.

He authored a children&#x27;s reader in 1995 titled &quot;A Boy Named Boomer&quot; and co-wrote (with Lowell Cauffiel) a 1998 novel titled &quot;Toss&quot;.

He co-hosted the Miss America Pageant with Meredith Vieira on September 19, 1998, and co-hosted with Julie Chen the CBS broadcast of the 2002 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

He and partner Craig Carton served as judges on the May 29, 2011, episode of Iron Chef America.

He has co-hosted &quot;Super Bowl&#x27;s Greatest Commercials&quot; from 2012 to 2023.

He made a cameo appearance as himself on the October 3, 2014, episode of &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;.

In 2015, he became the Commissioner of the FFL (Feline Football League) for &quot;Kitten Bowl II&quot; on the Hallmark Channel, and still holds that position today. He has provided analysis and commentary for all the Kitten Bowls since Kitten Bowl II, which airs during half time of the Super Bowl.

Esiason launched &quot;Game Time With Boomer Esiason&quot;, interviews with sports personalities from the past, on Saturday September 14, 2019.

===Broadcasting===
While still playing, Esiason appeared as a color analyst on the USA Network&#x27;s two-year broadcast of the World League of American Football (WLAF) on Monday nights, partnered with Brad Nessler. After his retirement from playing, he went into broadcasting full-time. He was a color commentator for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; from 1998 to 1999. Following his dismissal by ABC (due primarily to personal conflicts between him and play-by-play announcer Al Michaels), he was hired by the Westwood One radio network to become the lead analyst for radio broadcasts of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; and Super Bowl games. He broadcast every Super Bowl from SB XXXIV in 2000 to SB LII in 2018, a total of 19, which is a broadcast record.

As planned, after broadcasting the &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; game on September 6, 2018, he left Westwood One. He was quoted as saying &quot;I’m going to miss it, but in all reality I kind of have to get part of my life back.&quot; He currently serves as an in-studio analyst &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; on Showtime, and hosts &quot;Boomer and Gio&quot; on WFAN Radio in New York and the CBS Sports Network. In September 2012, CBS Radio announced he was added to their collection of talent to deliver five sports updates per day Monday through Friday. Esiason was also an analyst for &quot;The NFL Today&quot; on CBS television from 2002 through 2023.

Starting in 2013, he began appearing once a week as a guest on &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot; during the NFL season to break down the upcoming weekend&#x27;s NFL action.

===WFAN morning show===
In April 2007, after the firing of Don Imus, CBS Radio gave Esiason a one-week &quot;try-out&quot; as Imus&#x27; replacement on WFAN. The station announced him as the permanent host on August 13, with radio veteran Craig Carton joining as co-host. &quot;Boomer and Carton&quot; officially started on September 4, 2007. As an analyst with Westwood One, Esiason would do the Monday morning show, travel to do the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game and travel back to New York in time to do the Tuesday morning show. The &quot;Boomer and Carton&quot; radio program became the number-one rated morning show in all key demographics in the greater New York listening area and was seen on the MSG Network from 2010 to 2013. On March 8, 2013, both Esiason and Carton worked the radio broadcast of a Brooklyn Nets basketball game. The radio program had been simulcast on the CBS Sports Network since January 2014.

Craig Carton was arrested in September 2017 and charged with operating a concert ticket Ponzi scheme. Carton then resigned from WFAN, leaving Esiason as the sole host of the show, which was rebranded &quot;The Morning Show with Boomer&quot;. Gregg Giannotti joined Boomer as permanent co-host starting on January 2, 2018, with the show rechristened as &quot;Boomer and Gio&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1986, Esiason married his wife, Cheryl. They have two children, son Gunnar and daughter Sydney.

Esiason and his family have lived in the village of Plandome, New York, since at least 1998.

Esiason is an avid ice hockey fan, and a devoted supporter of the New York Rangers. He is also a fan of the New York Mets and New York Knicks. As of 2019, he plays in up to 70 recreational-league hockey games a year. Gunnar and his father are teammates on their local hockey team. Esiason plays in the annual Mikey Strong Charity Hockey game with NHL alumni. His foundation sponsors the annual Guinness Cup Hockey Tournament.

==Boomer Esiason Foundation==
The Boomer Esiason Foundation (BEF) was formed soon after Gunnar&#x27;s diagnosis to fund research to find a cure for cystic fibrosis. The foundation also provides scholarships, transplant grants, hospital grants, and education and awareness of CF to help provide a higher quality of life for people with CF. The foundation has raised in excess of $100 million, and has supported numerous hospitals, including Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital with the Gunnar H Esiason CF/Lung Center and Columbia Presbyterian in NYC with the Gunnar H Esiason Adult CF and Lung Program. In 2018 the foundation awarded over $400,000 in scholarships to almost 100 students. The foundation is located in New York City and runs numerous events around the country. The foundation annually receives four stars from Charity Navigator.

In 1996, Esiason formed a partnership with Cantor Fitzgerald and Howard Lutnick (CEO) as the foundation offices were moved to the North Tower of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan on the 101st floor, which was destroyed in 2001 in the September 11 attacks. All five full-time employees survived, as none were in the building at the time, but &quot;Esiason figured he knew over 100 people personally&quot; who were killed in the attack, including his best friend Tim O&#x27;Brien who was a partner at Cantor.

<text>Earl Landaff, of Thomastown in the County of Tipperary, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1797 for Francis Mathew, 1st Viscount Landaff, who had previously represented County Tipperary in the Irish House of Commons. He had already been created Baron Landaff, of Thomastown in the County of Tipperary, in 1783, and Viscount Landaff, of Thomastown in the County of Tipperary, in 1793, also in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1800 he was elected as one of the 28 original Irish representative peer. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. The titles became extinct on his death in 1833. Thomastown Castle was the childhood home of Father Theobald Mathew, &quot;The Apostle of Temperance&quot;.

The Earls Landaff used the invented courtesy title &quot;Viscount Mathew&quot; for the heir apparent. Despite their territorial designations and the fact that they were in the Peerage of Ireland, the titles all referred to the place in Glamorgan now spelt &quot;Llandaff&quot;. The Mathew family was founded by Sir David Mathew (died 1484), Grand Standard Bearer of England. The Earls Landaff were descended from the branch of the family seated at Radyr, Glamorgan, Wales, descended from Thomas Mathew (died 1470), a younger son of Sir David Mathew. In Llandaff Cathedral, nearby Radyr, there exist three 15th-century and 16th-century Mathew family effigies.

The seat of the Mathew family was Thomastown Castle, County Tipperary long abandoned. The extant ruins form a notable landmark. George Mathew sold his estate at Radyr and moved to Thomastown, gaining ownership of the castle through marriage to Elizabeth Poyntz after the death of her first husband, Thomas Butler, Viscount Thurles, of the Butler family.

==Earls Landaff (1797)==
*Francis Mathew, 1st Earl Landaff (1738–1806)
*Francis James Mathew, 2nd Earl Landaff (1768–1833)

Rejected claimants
*Arnold Harris Mathew, self-styled , also self-styled Count Povoleri di Vicenza (1852–1919).He was founder and first bishop of the Old Roman Catholic Western Orthodox Church in Great Britain, an Old Catholic Church. His episcopal consecration was declared null and void by the Union of Utrecht&#x27;s International Old Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference. He claimed his father, Major Arnold Henry Ochterlony Mathew (d. 1894), to have been the 3rd Earl, on the grounds of his grandfather, Major Arnold Nesbit Mathew, of the Indian Army, having been the eldest son of the 1st Earl Landaff, born five months after his parents&#x27; marriage. This claim has subsequently been concluded to be based on incorrect information, with Arnold Nesbit Mathew (he originally used the name &#x27;Matthews&#x27;, as did his son) being in fact the son of William Richard Matthews, of Down Ampney, Gloucestershire, and his wife Anne.

<text>The Roe River runs from Giant Springs to the Missouri River near Great Falls, Montana, United States. The Roe River is only long at its longest constant point, and had been named as the World&#x27;s Shortest River by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; before Guinness eliminated the category in 2006. Towards its mouth, the Roe is about deep.

According to the latest data, the shortest river in the world is the Reprua, flowing in the Gagra District of the Republic of Abkhazia. Only 18 m (59 ft) long, it is one of the shortest rivers in the world and is said to be one of the coldest rivers on the Black Sea coast.

==History==
A successful campaign to get the Roe River recognized by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the shortest river in the world originated in 1987 with fifth-grade students of teacher Susie Nardlinger at Lincoln Elementary School in Great Falls. The river was unnamed at the time, so the students first had to petition the United States Board on Geographic Names to accept their proposed name, Roe River, then submit their proposal to Guinness. The children&#x27;s name likely came from the Giant Springs Trout Hatchery adjoining the springs and which receives of spring water per minute used in primarily raising rainbow trout from their own &quot;roe&quot; (eggs). In 1988 future NFL football player Dallas Neil, then a student at the school, put in an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; as part of this effort.

Previously, Oregon&#x27;s D River was listed in Guinness World Records as the world&#x27;s shortest river at . This title was contested in 1989 when Guinness named the Roe River as the world&#x27;s shortest. Not to be deterred, the people of Lincoln City submitted a new measurement of the D River to Guinness of about long, when marked at &quot;extreme high tide&quot;.

At that time, Lincoln City&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce described the Roe as a &quot;drainage ditch surveyed for a school project&quot;. Nardlinger shot back that the D was merely an &quot;ocean water backup&quot;, pointed out that there was an alternative fork to the Roe which was only long, and suggested that a new survey be conducted.

Guinness apparently never ruled on the dispute, leaving the claim by the Roe stand, but instead chose to no longer list a shortest river, possibly as a result of this ongoing dispute.

<text>Woolston Eyes is a Site of Special Scientific Interest located in the town of Warrington, England, alongside the Manchester Ship Canal. The eyes themselves are used for the deposition of dredgings from the Ship Canal under a Waste Management Licence issued by the Environment Agency.

The Woolston Eyes Conservation Group manages the site as a nature reserve with access by permit only. The rather strange name for the site is from Anglo-Saxon, &quot;ees&quot; meaning the land near a loop in a river.

==Wildlife==
It is the premier UK site for breeding black-necked grebes and a stronghold for the willow tit, and other breeding birds include little grebe, great crested grebe, shelduck, Eurasian teal, Northern shoveler, water rail, common cuckoo, common kingfisher, common grasshopper warbler and Eurasian reed warbler. Woolston Eyes also supports nationally important wintering numbers of Northern shoveler, Eurasian teal gadwall and common pochard. There are 12 species of herpetofauna recorded, including sand lizard, smooth snake, natterjack toad and all three native British species of newt. It is also home to 21 species of Odonata, dragonflies and damselfies, out of 58 species found in Britain, as well as 26 species of butterfly.

==Management==
Woolston Eyes Conservation Group, a voluntary organisation formed in 1979, manages the rich and varied wildlife of the deposit grounds with the agreement of the Manchester Ship Canal Company. Its aim is to promote the study and conservation of the wildlife and habitat of the area with particular regard to the ornithology. The group undertakes management work to preserve or maximise the ornithological value of the Reserve, provides and maintains hides for the use of the public and permit holders, keeps the paths open and discourages disturbance. The group produces an Annual Report which summarises the work carried out and the results obtained including the scientific study of the flora and fauna of the Reserve. To carry out this work the group raises funds by the sale of Permits, Annual Reports and by applying for grants from various organisations.

A native of Mermaid, Farquharson had been a teacher and then a businessman involved in wholesale and shipping. He was elected to the legislature as a Liberal in 1876 and joined the government of Louis Henry Davies in 1878 until the Davies administration fell the next year. Farquharson sat in opposition until the Liberals won the 1891 election. He became Premier in August 1898 but, in 1901, he was persuaded to run in a by-election to the federal House of Commons since PEI Liberals hoped that as a former Premier, he would be elevated to the Canadian cabinet guaranteeing the island&#x27;s representation in government. Farquharson won the by-election but Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed a westerner to cabinet instead leaving Farquharson on the backbenches until his death in 1903.

During Farquharson&#x27;s premiership the provincial legislature passed the &quot;Prohibition Act&quot; (or &quot;Scott Act&quot;) which implemented a complete ban on alcohol sales and production in the province starting in 1901. It would not be repealed until 1948.

<text>Baron Llangattock, &quot;of the Hendre in the County of Monmouth&quot;, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1892 for John Rolls, of The Hendre in the parish of Llangattock-Vibon-Avel, about 4 miles north-west of Monmouth, Member of Parliament for Monmouthshire from 1880 to 1892. He was succeeded by his eldest son, John Maclean Rolls, the 2nd Baron, who was killed in action at the Battle of the Somme in 1916. As the 2nd Baron was unmarried and his two younger brothers had predeceased him, the title became extinct upon his death. The family estates, including The Hendre in Monmouthshire, passed to the 2nd Baron&#x27;s only sister Eleanor Rolls, a scientist and balloonist. She was the wife of Sir John Courtown Edward Shelley, 6th Baronet (1871–1951), of Castle Goring, who in 1917 assumed by royal licence the additional surname of Rolls, after which she became known as Eleanor Shelley-Rolls. They had no children and The Hendre estate passed to the Harding-Rolls family, descended from Patricia Rolls, sister of the 1st Baron, which resided at The Hendre until 1987.

The Honourable Charles Rolls, third and youngest son of the 1st Baron, was the co-founder of the Rolls-Royce car manufacturing firm.

<doc id="600948" wikidata="Q8053031" url="?curid=600948" title="Yeti (Doctor Who)">
<text>The Yeti are fictional robots from the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. They were originally created by Henry Lincoln and Mervyn Haisman, and first appeared in the 1967 serial &quot;The Abominable Snowmen&quot;, where they encountered the Second Doctor and his companions Jamie and Victoria.

The Yeti resemble the cryptozoological creatures also called the Yeti, with an appearance Radio Times has described as &quot;cuddly but ferocious&quot;, disguising a small spherical device that provides its motive power. The Yeti serve the Great Intelligence, a disembodied entity from another dimension, which first appeared trying to form a physical body so as to conquer the Earth. The Yeti are initially used as a deception to frighten away curious people, but eventually they become an army for the Great Intelligence.

Disagreements arose between Lincoln and Haisman with the BBC in 1968 over a serial introducing another new monster, &quot;The Dominators&quot;, leading to the writers&#x27; departure from the series and the retirement of the Yeti as antagonists. The Yeti have since appeared infrequently in flashbacks or cameo appearances. One did have a part in the 20th anniversary special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;. They also appear in the 1990s &quot;Virgin Missing Adventures&quot; novels and the 1995 Reeltime spin-off production &quot;Downtime&quot;. The Great Intelligence has since returned in Series 7 of the revived series, portrayed by Sir Ian McKellen and Richard E. Grant, without the aid of its Yeti servants.

==Creation==
The Yeti, along with contemporary villains such as the Cybermen and Ice Warriors, were an effort by the production team to create replacement monsters for the Daleks, who creator and part-copyright owner Terry Nation desired to have appear in an American spin-off series. &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;, the last serial of the fourth season, had been intended as a final confrontation between the Doctor and the Daleks. Producer Innes Lloyd had already overseen the creation of the Cybermen by Gerry Davis and Kit Pedler and saw the monsters as an alternative to Daleks. Lloyd later recollected that the need to replace the Daleks also influenced the decision to pick up the Yeti as recurring monsters.

After Henry Lincoln and Mervyn Haisman had spoken with Patrick Troughton, who expressed disappointment in the lack of Earth-bound stories in his first season as the Doctor, Lincoln chose the stories of the yeti as a suitable concept around which to create a serial for the program. Lincoln and Haisman pitched the idea to the Doctor Who offices, where it was formally commissioned. Lloyd and script editor Peter Bryant were impressed with &quot;The Abominable Snowmen&quot; and commissioned Haisman and Lincoln for a second Yeti adventure.

==Physical characteristics==

Martin Baugh designed the Yeti costume; he was also responsible for costumes in their second serial &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;. This serial used different Yeti costumes from those of their debut, which were not considered threatening enough and had deteriorated. The Yeti robots that appear in &quot;The Abominable Snowmen&quot; are large with brown fur and a blackened face. These costumes also have clawed hands and feet, and they house control spheres in their chest, used by the Great Intelligence to remotely operate them.

These original costumes were deemed &#x27;a little too cuddly&#x27; and so when the robots returned in &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; they were redesigned. These Yeti robots appeared more compact and had glowing eyes. Brian Hodgson of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop also developed a Yeti roar for this serial, created by slowing down the sound of a flushing toilet. One of the original Yeti from The Abominable Snowmen appeared briefly as a museum display and, upon being reactivated by a control sphere, transformed into the newer model.

In &quot;The Abominable Snowmen&quot; the control spheres are depicted as capable of seeking out inactive Yeti and crawling into the robots to activate them, emitting a series of whistle-like beeps whilst doing so. If the cavity intended to house the sphere is blocked, as Jamie (Frazer Hines) does with a rock, the sphere ignores that Yeti and falls silent. &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; expanded upon the spheres as a plot device with Professor Edward Travers and, as the serial progresses, the Doctor experimenting upon them. The experiments of both Travers and the Doctor eventually allow the protagonists to control the sphere, and by extension any Yeti it is stored within, using a short-range remote control.

==History==
The Yeti appeared twice in the fifth season of the series as adversaries of the Doctor&#x27;s second incarnation (Patrick Troughton). They are introduced in the 1967 serial &quot;The Abominable Snowmen&quot; guarding a cave near a Buddhist monastery in the Himalayas, scaring or killing travellers. The Yeti robots are protecting a pyramid of spheres that house the Great Intelligence, who has also possessed the body of the High Lama Padmasamabhava (Wolfe Morris) ever since encountering the man on the astral plane some centuries ago. Using Padmasambhava the Great Intelligence moves small Yeti pieces around a chess-like map of the monastery and mountainside. The Great Intelligence intends to create a physical body for itself, but these plans are foiled by the Doctor and his companions. With the Intelligence banished back to the astral plane the Yeti fall dormant. Several Yeti curiosities are taken back to England by Travers (Jack Watling), who had come in the hopes of encountering the real Yeti.

In &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;, aired in 1968 and set forty years after &quot;The Abominable Snowmen&quot;, the Yeti artifacts that Travers brought to England reawaken due to the return of the Great Intelligence. The Yeti then subjugate London and engulf the Underground in web. The only resistance offered is by a band of soldiers, led first by Captain Knight (Ralph Watson) and then by Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney), with scientific support provided by Travers, his daughter Anne Travers (Tina Packer) and later the Doctor. The invasion of the London Underground is revealed as a trap designed to draw in the Doctor so that the Great Intelligence can drain the Doctor&#x27;s mind, but it is again defeated and banished.

During the events of the Second Doctor&#x27;s trial in the climax of season six&#x27;s ten-part long &quot;The War Games&quot;, the Doctor refers to the Yeti as one of many threats that he has defeated during his travels. When in the 1983 serial &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; the Fifth Doctor encounters a retired and amnesiac Lethbridge-Stewart the Yeti are one of many references the Doctor makes to trigger the Brigadier&#x27;s memory. Clips from &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; are also shown in a flashback montage during this serial. A Yeti is also one of the creatures featured in &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; and is encountered by the second Doctor and the Brigadier (Nicholas Courtney) as they cross through the Death Zone. The Brigadier later references the Yeti in the 1989 serial &quot;Battlefield&quot; as one of many alien adversaries that UNIT is prepared for. The Doctor&#x27;s encounters with the Yeti are also referred to in the 2012 TV story &quot;The Snowmen&quot; when the Doctor uses a map of the 1960s London Underground to prove a point in front of a younger Great Intelligence, referencing its later invasion in 1968&#x27;s &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;. The story also serves as a prequel to &quot;The Abominable Snowmen&quot;.

==Other appearances==
As a popular monster the Yeti have appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off media; however, the canonical status of non-televised stories is uncertain. Yeti and the Great Intelligence are featured in the 1995 spin-off video &quot;Downtime&quot;, produced by Reeltime and featuring Victoria Waterfield (Deborah Watling), the Brigadier (Nicholas Courtney) and Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) with a now deceased Professor Travers (Jack Watling) serving as a vessel for the Intelligence. Here the Great Intelligence plans on infecting the Internet so as to use it as a new body, using control spheres to transform humans into Yeti servants. &quot;Downtime&quot; was novelised by Marc Platt as part of Virgin&#x27;s &quot;Missing Adventures&quot; range in 1996.

The Yeti also appear in the 1995 Missing Adventure &quot;Millennial Rites&quot; by Craig Hinton, where the summoning of a creature from the universe to come goes wrong and instead sees the Great Intelligence merged with that entity. This creates an altered London based on contradictory physical laws and populated by demons and sorcerers, forcing altered versions of the Sixth Doctor and his companion Mel (transformed into the Valeyard and a technomancer named Melaphyre) to restore London before the reality tears itself apart. The novel also features the character Anne Travers from &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;. &quot;Millennial Rites&quot; follows the New Adventure &quot;All-Consuming Fire&quot; by Andy Lane, published in 1994, in identifying the Great Intelligence with H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Yog-Sothoth, a being from the universe before this one. The Great Intelligence also appeared in a back-up comic strip in &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot; #31–#34. Yeti robots were also among the monsters to appear in the 1997 video game &quot;Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctors&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==

After the death of co-creator Mervyn Haisman, the Guardian&#x27;s obituary called the Yeti his &#x27;lasting legacy&#x27; to the series, noting how the monsters quickly found popularity among viewers. Their second appearance in &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; was considered such a success by the production team that the sixth season Cybermen serial &quot;The Invasion&quot; was intended as both a follow-up to the second Yeti adventure and a pilot for a new earthbound format for the series. The Third Doctor Jon Pertwee is known for commenting that nothing frightened an audience more than &quot;a Yeti on your loo in Tooting Bec&quot; in reference to the success of the earthbound format, associating the creatures strongly with the new direction of the series.

Paul Cornell, commenting on Fortean themes within the series, mentions that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; is a populist series exploring the public perception of the fantastic and that the Yeti stories are an early example of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; exploring such concepts, which were later explored in several serials produced by Barry Letts in the early 1970s. Media historian James Chapman agrees that &quot;The Abominable Snowmen&quot; is the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial to explore cryptozoology or mythology with an alien grounding, also citing it as having drawn from the gothic horror atmosphere and plot of Hammer&#x27;s 1957 film &quot;The Abominable Snowman&quot;. He reflects that their second outing, in &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;, turned what was merely another monster when in the Himalayas into a nightmare by placing them in the identifiable setting of the London Underground. Chapman concludes that &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; also, by centring the Yeti threat in the London Underground, is part of a horror tradition where a &#x27;chaos world&#x27; is located under the surface the ordinary.

Graham Sleight commented that the voiceless Yeti robots, and similar monsters such as the Autons and the maggots in &quot;The Green Death&quot;, are controlled by another entity and are merely there to provide a threat, leading to the Yeti and similar monsters being less interesting than monsters that could talk or reason with the characters. In contrast, Fraser McAlpine and Nick Page felt that the Yeti being controlled gave them greater menace. McAlpine says this gives the Yeti menace because, being controlled, they can&#x27;t hold any feelings or grudges of their own and act only as the fierce physical agents for whoever can control them. Page reflected that &#x27;the Great Intelligence... always turned off their power when it was not required&#x27;, creating suspense when characters interacted with a seemingly dormant Yeti.

<doc id="600960" wikidata="Q821731" url="?curid=600960" title="Birchwood, Cheshire">
<text>Birchwood is a town and civil parish in the Borough of Warrington, Cheshire, England. The parish had a population of 10,614 at the 2021 census. Located originally in Lancashire, it was built as a new town in the 1970s. Birchwood is made up of three districts: Gorse Covert, Locking Stumps and Oakwood.

== History ==
&quot;The surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and will bear neither horse nor man….. What nature meant by such a useless production &#x27;tis hard to imagine, but the land is entirely to waste&quot; are the words of Daniel Defoe as he rode through Risley in 1724. (Later part of the Risley area was renamed Birchwood as the Warrington &#x27;New town&#x27; development).

In the past, travellers avoided the Risley (Birchwood) area because it of its dangerous mossland, however gradually over time much of the fertile mossland was reclaimed and turned into farmland. With the advent of the Second World War, 927 acres (3.8 km2) of agricultural land was changed into a large Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Risley. The location was chosen because the low lying mist and cloud helped camouflage the factory from the air; according to a local builder: &quot;It was very lonely and misty at night, and that&#x27;s why the factory was constructed there ... it was usually covered with a mist or cloud. It was hard to see it in the day time, you know&quot;. Although the location of the factory was known by the German Luftwaffe, the factory was bombed only once during the war.

A number of bunkers were built (some can still be seen today) to house the munitions, to protect them from potential bombing, and also to segregate the site and reduce the consequences of any accidental explosions during manufacture or storage. Although these bunkers are on the surface, they are covered with soil and turf and so give the impression of being underground.

After the war, the factory no longer had a purpose other than as a storage depot, so in 1956 the north-west of the site was sold to the Atomic Energy Authority. The whole of Warrington borough was designated as a proposed new town in 1968, and subsequently the Warrington and Runcorn Development Corporation bought the site and turned it into the new town of Birchwood.

== Shopping ==
The area&#x27;s principal shopping needs are serviced by Birchwood Shopping Centre, with many shops such as a large Asda store, two cafes and a Greggs. There are also a number of smaller shops in each village of the town. Each one has a local convenience store that meets needs such as bread and milk. Local milk and vegetable delivery services supply houses in the area, as well as the delivery services from the large supermarkets. There are a few farms in the area that sell small quantities of eggs and other local produce directly to local shoppers.

== Transport ==
Birchwood is close to the intersections between the M6 and M62 and the M6 and M56, and the railway station on the Liverpool–Manchester line.

=== Rail ===
Birchwood railway station is operated by Northern with trains stopping bound for Manchester, Liverpool and Warrington Central as well as long-distance services to Norwich which are operated by East Midlands Railway during peak hours only. Trains pass through three times an hour per direction:

* Two suburban trains per hour to Manchester Oxford Road via Irlam
* Two suburban trains per hour to Liverpool Lime Street via Warrington Central
* One fast train per hour to Liverpool Lime Street stopping only at Warrington Central and Liverpool South Parkway en route
* One fast train per hour to Manchester Airport via Manchester Piccadilly

=== Road ===
Birchwood is very close to Junction 11 of the M62, providing access to Liverpool (22 miles/35 km) and Manchester (15 miles/24 km). Junction 11 is notable for the &quot;Encounter&quot; statue (also known as the &quot;Angel of Birchwood&quot;). Birchwood is close to Junction 21 of the M6, giving access to Birmingham (80 miles/128 km). Birchwood is approximately from Warrington town centre (via Birchwood Way) and Leigh (11 miles/18 km) (via Warrington Road).

=== Buses ===
There are six bus routes operating through the Birchwood area, all of which are operated by Warrington&#x27;s Own Buses.

The 17 and 25 operate through all parts of Birchwood to Warrington, with the Gorse Covert SPAR shop (25) or Oakwood Keyes Close (17) acting as termini. The routes differ in the precise routes they take to Warrington bus station, and in their regularity. Service 25 is the main service, The 28E operates the evening services Monday to Saturday going from Warrington bus station to Leigh bus station. The first service starts at 19:00 and the last service is at 23:00 departing at each ends of the line

The 28 also starts at Warrington bus station, then through Birchwood and on to Leigh via Culcheth. The 28A operates the same route but does not go through Birchwood or Oakwood.

A shuttle bus service for workers runs between the railway station and Birchwood Park business park.

== Geography ==
The area east of Birchwood is mainly birch forests and Risley Moss, part of the Mersey Forest. Risley Moss is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The bulk of Birchwood is built on the site of the former ROF Risley Royal Ordnance Factory, with Birchwood Forest Park lying in the centre, in which the old bunkers from the factory form part of the landscape.

== Education ==
Birchwood has three primary schools, one per area, and Birchwood Community High School. Birchwood College is next to the high school.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. The town is served by Cheshire&#x27;s MIX56 radio station broadcasting from Lymm as well as both BBC Radio Merseyside and BBC Radio Manchester. Other radio stations are Heart North West, Smooth North West, Capital North West &amp; Wales, Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool &amp; The North West (formerly Wire FM) and Warrington Radio, a community based station which broadcast from nearby Warrington. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Warrington Guardian&quot;.

== Industry ==
To the north of the Royal Ordnance Factory, Risley was the site chosen for the design offices and headquarters of the Department of ATomic ENergy (DATEN) after the Second World War. Later to become the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), the offices were charged with the manufacture of the nuclear reactors and process plants at Windscale to help build the UK&#x27;s atomic defence. Following on from the weapons program, the Risley offices were responsible for the building of the Magnox and AGR designs of reactor in the UK. In 1971 BNFL was set up from the production division of the UKAEA, and until 2003 its headquarters were at Risley. BNFL&#x27;s headquarters are now at Daresbury Park industrial estate, also near to Warrington.

BNFL (now represented by Sellafield Ltd and Nexia Solutions) maintains a large office of the site, which is something of a nuclear nexus, with AMEC (Formerly NNC), Nuvia (formerly NUKEM Engineering Limited), WS Atkins Design, Environment &amp; Engineering, Nuclear Technologies plc, Serco and Assurance Quintessa (among others) based on Birchwood Park.

WS Atkins has one office in Birchwood, at Chadwick House, containing various business units including Water, Highways and Transportation, Design Solutions, Rail, Nuclear and Faithful+Gould.

<text>Baron Loch, of Drylaw in the County of Midlothian (now part of Edinburgh), was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1895 for the soldier and colonial administrator Sir Henry Loch. He was the son of James Loch, Member of Parliament for Wick Burghs. Lord Loch was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He was a Major-General in the British Army and also held political office as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard in 1924 and between 1929 and 1931. His two sons, the third and fourth Barons, both succeeded to the title. George Henry, 3rd Baron Loch, served in the 11th Hussars and left the army as a major. After his fourth marriage to Sylvia (née Cameron), he was best known as an international riding instructor. The barony became extinct on the death of his brother Spencer in 1991.

<text>Glögg, gløgg or glögi is a spiced, often alcoholic, mulled wine, or spirit of Swedish origin. It is a traditional Swedish drink during winter, especially around Christmas.

==History==
In the Nordic countries, hot wine has been a common drink since at least the 16th century. The original form of glögg, a spiced liquor, was consumed by messengers and postmen who travelled on horseback or skis in cold weather. Since the early 19th century, glögg has been a common winter drink, mixed and warmed with juice, syrup, and sometimes with a smaller quantity of harder spirits or punsch.

Glögg came to Finland from Sweden. The Finnish word &quot;glögi&quot; comes from the Swedish word &quot;glögg&quot;, which in turn comes from the words &quot;glödgat vin&quot; or hot wine. At the end of the 19th century, glögg mixed with wine was drunk, but due to prohibition, consumption of glögg almost stopped completely. When prohibition was lifted in the 1930s glögg was advertised in Fenno-Swedish magazines, and in the 1950s and 60s, the drinking of glögg was a Fenno-Swedish tradition. At the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s, glögg recipes began to also appear in Finnish-language magazines, after which glögg became a Christmas tradition in the whole of Finland.

While mulled wine (&quot;hõõgvein&quot;) was long known and popular in Estonia, Swedish-style glögg (&quot;glögi&quot; in Estonian) spread into Estonia only in the 1980s and 1990s, mostly via Finland, and local commercial production of glögi started in Estonia in 1995.

==Traditions==
Glögg is a traditional Swedish drink during winter, especially around Christmas.

==Recipes==

Glögg recipes vary widely; variations commonly start with white or sweet wine or spirits such as brandy or cognac. The production of glögg begins by boiling water and adding spices to it. After a few minutes of simmering, the mixture is sieved and fruit juice, wine or clear spirits are added. Other versions begin by warming up the wine, alcohol, and sugar (not boiling it) and letting the spices steep in it overnight. The most common spices in glögg are cloves, cinnamon, cardamom and ginger. Other common ingredients can include citrus peel from oranges or lemons, raisins, or almonds.

Glögg can also be made without alcohol by replacing the wine with fruit or berry juices. Ready-made glögg is usually based on grape juice, sometimes also blackcurrant juice, mixed fruit juice, apple juice or wine. There are also stronger, rum-based types of glögg. All glögg is warmed up before use, but if it is wine-based or high in alcohol content, it should not be heated to boiling point. It is common to add whole almonds or raisins to glögg while it is being warmed up or just before drinking.

<text>Arthur Peters (August 29, 1854 – January 29, 1908) was the ninth premier of Prince Edward Island.

Arthur Peters and his brother Frederick Peters (also destined to enter political office) were born in Charlottetown.

Arthur Peters was first elected to the province&#x27;s legislative assembly in 1893 as a Liberal. He became Attorney-General in 1900 and was asked by the lieutenant governor to become premier of the province on December 29, 1901, after his predecessor had resigned to enter federal politics.

Peters attempted to renegotiate the rules governing the island&#x27;s representation in the House of Commons of Canada as the island was losing parliamentary seats as a result of successive censuses. Peters argued the province&#x27;s case before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (though the matter was not resolved during his lifetime) and he also negotiated an increased federal subsidy to the province. Peters died in office on January 29, 1908, at the age of 53.

<text>Francis Longworth Haszard (November 20, 1849 – July 25, 1938) was a Prince Edward Island politician and jurist, the tenth premier of Prince Edward Island. His family had been United Empire Loyalists who left the United States after the American Revolution.

Longworth was born at Bellevue, Lot 49, Prince Edward Island. He studied law, was called to the bar in 1872 and set up practice in Charlottetown. He had been a magistrate in Charlottetown before being elected to the provincial legislature for the first time in 1904 as a Liberal. In 1908, he was asked by the lieutenant governor to become premier after the death of Arthur Peters.

The Liberals had been in power since 1891 and their majority in the legislature had eroded over time. By the time Haszard became premier the Liberals and opposition Conservatives had almost equal strength in the house.

Haszard represented PEI at the Maritime and Inter-Provincial conferences held in 1910 and attempted to obtain a better deal for the province from the federal government. He left politics in 1911 to accept an appointment to the province&#x27;s Supreme Court and as Master of the Rolls. He retired from the bench in 1930.

<doc id="601002" wikidata="Q846779" url="?curid=601002" title="Imperial Bedroom">
<text>Imperial Bedroom is the seventh studio album by the English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello, and his sixth with the Attractions—keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas (no relation). It was released on 2July 1982 through F-Beat Records in the United Kingdom and Columbia Records in the United States. Recording took place at AIR Studios in London from late 1981 to early 1982 with production handled by Geoff Emerick. Placing an emphasis on studio experimentation, the album saw the group use unusual instruments, including harpsichord, accordion and strings arranged by Nieve. Songs were rewritten constantly while Costello tinkered with the recordings, adding numerous overdubs.

Employing a variety of pop styles that embody new wave, baroque pop and art rock, &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; contains an ornately lush production that several commentators compared to the Beatles and Phil Spector&#x27;s wall of sound. The lyrics primarily concern love and relationships, with insight into the emotional problems of individuals. Squeeze&#x27;s Chris Difford co-wrote the lyrics for &quot;Boy With a Problem&quot;. The cover artwork, a painting by Barney Bubbles, is a pastiche of Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Three Musicians&quot;.

Promoted under the tagline &quot;Masterpiece?&quot;, &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; reached number 6 in the UK and number 30 in the US. Its singles, &quot;You Little Fool&quot; and &quot;Man Out of Time&quot;, failed to break the top 50 in the UK. Its commercial performance led Costello to take a new direction with 1983&#x27;s &quot;Punch the Clock&quot;. It was greeted with massive acclaim from music critics and continues to be regarded as one of Costello&#x27;s best works. Reviewers praised the songwriting, production, instrumentation and performances, although its complexity was divisive. &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; has appeared on several best-of lists and has been reissued multiple times with bonus tracks. 

==Background==
By 1981, Elvis Costello had released six studio albums in four years. Following the release of his country covers album &quot;Almost Blue&quot; (1981), the artist was facing diminishing popularity, particularly in America, where &quot;Trust&quot; (1981) and the &quot;Taking Liberties&quot; (1980) collection of outtakes had only reached the top 30; &quot;Armed Forces&quot; (1979) and &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; (1980) both reached number two. He had experimented musically with &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;, &quot;Trust&quot; and &quot;Almost Blue&quot;, and began to write more introspective lyrics than the angry material of his first three albums. However, the weaker commercial performances of these projects caused him to re-evaluate himself as an artist, leading him to take a new direction for his next album.

Costello&#x27;s initial vision for his seventh studio project was to record most of it live with minimal overdubs. He and his backing band the Attractions—keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas (no relation)—spent two weeks rehearsing the material at a remote college in Devon using this method, yielding an eight-track album. Costello eventually settled on using heavy studio experimentation when he found the material sounded too similar to &quot;Trust&quot;.

==Recording and production==

The band regrouped at London&#x27;s AIR Studios in November 1981, where Costello had booked 12 weeks to record the album. He chose former Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick to produce the album, who the artist primarily used to &quot;make his scattershot ideas a reality&quot;; Emerick would be listed on the album sleeve as producing &quot;from an original idea by Elvis Costello, assisted by Jon Jacobs&quot;. It was Costello&#x27;s first album of original material not produced by Nick Lowe, as Costello believed his complex ideas for the record would be too much for the producer; engineer Roger Béchirian did not return either. Lowe later returned to produce 1986&#x27;s &quot;Blood &amp; Chocolate&quot;.

Emerick&#x27;s primary role was to let the musicians take charge of themselves, as a way to &quot;draw things out of the artist&quot;. Costello commented in 1995: &quot;He was used to being thrown an incomprehensible garble of sounds and musical directions and making some sense of it. After working with the Beatles at the height of their psychedelic era, he was used to innovation.&quot; According to the author Tony Clayton-Lea, Emerick transformed the record from a &quot;decent&quot; eight-track demo album into an &quot;aural tour de force&quot;. The album was recorded at the same time as Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Tug of War&quot;, on which Emerick simultaneously served as engineer while George Martin produced; Emerick departed for small periods to work on &quot;Tug of War&quot;—with Jacobs taking over—before resuming work with Costello. The artist later explained that he and McCartney were initially set to have non-conflicting recording schedules but the latter&#x27;s was moved up, forcing Emerick to work between the two.

The new record was Costello&#x27;s first where the songs were not performed live before properly recording. Costello instead drew upon brand new songs, but took some tracks from prior ventures: &quot;Boy With a Problem&quot; originated during the sessions for &quot;Trust&quot;, &quot;Kid About It&quot; from the artist&#x27;s time producing Squeeze&#x27;s &quot;East Side Story&quot; (1981) and &quot;Tears Before Bedtime&quot; during the sessions for &quot;Almost Blue&quot;. Tracks he wrote at home on the piano included &quot;Almost Blue&quot;, &quot;...And in Every Home&quot; and &quot;The Long Honeymoon&quot;. Costello asked Sammy Cahn for input in writing what would become &quot;The Long Honeymoon&quot; but the writer declined, which gave him the motivation to finish writing it himself, while Squeeze&#x27;s Chris Difford co-wrote lyrics for &quot;Boy With a Problem&quot;.
With an emphasis on studio experimentation, songs were constantly being rewritten in the studio; Costello took full control of the environment and concentrated the most on the sound of the recordings. Unlike previous albums, where there was a general production idea, Costello stated that the band treated each song individually. Emerick concurred, stating, &quot;My co-production consisted of abandoning the arrangements that we had carefully worked out.&quot; Bruce Thomas recalled: 


The group utilised unusual instruments, including mellotron, harpsichord, accordion, twelve-string guitar, marimba, strings and trumpets. Once Costello was satisfied with where a track was at, Emerick used his experience to shape them. However, the &quot;idiosyncratic, piecemeal approach&quot; led to each track being led by a specific instrument rather than displaying the Attractions as a creative unit: &quot;Shabby Doll&quot; showcased piano and bass, while &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; showcased drums, which Pete Thomas performed in one take after a heavy night of drinking; Costello stated that Pete&#x27;s performance led him to rewrite the number using the backing track as a guide. A contemporary review from &quot;NME&quot; Richard Cook noted that the guitars were demoted to &quot;mere colouration&quot;, with the keyboards drawing &quot;the predominant melodic shape&quot;. Nieve also played the distorted guitar during the fade of &quot;Tears Before Bedtime&quot; as &quot;a joke&quot;.

The Attractions recorded some tracks without Costello present, such as &quot;Pidgin English&quot; and &quot;Boy With a Problem&quot;. Nieve arranged the majority of the string sections, including three Wagnerian-like French horns for &quot;The Long Honeymoon&quot;, brass and woodwinds for &quot;Pidgin English&quot;, &quot;Philly-style violin&quot; for &quot;Town Cryer&quot; and a full 40-piece orchestra for &quot;...And in Every Home&quot;. Nieve conducted the orchestra himself, while Martin supervised the arrangement as it contained several allusions to his work with the Beatles; Ringo Starr visited the studio during the session. 

The album&#x27;s original working title was &quot;Music to Stop Clocks&quot; before being changed to &quot;This Is a Revolution of the Mind&quot;, a line from James Brown&#x27;s &quot;King Heroin&quot; (1972). Clayton-Lea found this title &quot;would blatantly publicize the health-conscious change of attitude&quot;. It was changed again to &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;—a line from &quot;The Loved Ones&quot; and &quot;Pidgin English&quot;—before settling on &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;, the name of a track Costello wrote and recorded after the sessions wrapped. He later remarked that the chosen title had &quot;just the right combination of splendour and sleaze to fit all the tracks on the album&quot;.

===Later work===
After completing the basic tracks in November 1981, Costello and the Attractions debuted several &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; tracks live during shows throughout late-December. Reviewing the newer numbers during the New Year&#x27;s Eve show, Robert Palmer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented: &quot;Some of them have the harmonic and melodic sophistication of pop standards from the 1930s and 1940s.&quot; On 7January 1982, the band performed with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall in London, mostly playing older hits and songs from &quot;Almost Blue&quot; and &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;.

Costello continued tinkering with the &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; recordings alone throughout early 1982, including experimenting with vocal inflections on &quot;Kid About It&quot;, &quot;Human Hands&quot; and &quot;Pidgin English&quot;. He also overdubbed &quot;vocal groups&quot; onto &quot;Tears Before Bedtime&quot;, &quot;The Loved Ones&quot; and &quot;Town Cryer&quot; as a way to contrast with the more straightforward approaches in &quot;Almost Blue&quot;, &quot;Man Out of Time&quot; and &quot;The Long Honeymoon&quot;. The biographer Graeme Thomson states that he wanted to move away from &quot;having one feel throughout&quot;, a trait that had permeated &quot;Almost Blue&quot;. He also commented that he believed the vocal and instrumental additions set &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; apart from his prior works. The album was completed by March.

==Music and lyrics==

A departure from the artist&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; employs a variety of musical styles, characterised by commentators as new wave, baroque pop, and art rock. Reviewers also found it Beatlesque, and drew comparisons to Tin Pan Alley. AllMusic&#x27;s senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine regarded the songs as an extension of the jazz and pop infatuations explored on &quot;Trust&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Palmer summarised, &quot;the music is a sumptuous mélange of pop styles, from Beatles-baroque to Phil Spector Wall-of-Sound to torch-song intimacy.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Parke Puterbaugh wrote that the album contains a &quot;potent, articulate musical kick&quot; that relates to the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969), the Pretty Things&#x27; &quot;S.F. Sorrow&quot; (1968) and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967). The biographer David Gouldstone says the production makes the songs sound &quot;spontaneous and immediate&quot;, while the author James E. Perone remarks that Costello&#x27;s voice is higher in the mix, presenting a &quot;clearer presentation&quot; of his voice than any of Lowe&#x27;s productions. 

The lyrics on &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; are also a departure from previous albums, wherein every song is primarily concerned with topics of love and relationships, and delve further into the psych of dealing with emotions rather than the &quot;revenge and guilt&quot; fantasies of Costello&#x27;s early work. Gouldstone summarises the album as being about &quot;the emotions, and more specifically the emotional problems, of individuals&quot;, while Perone wrote that the songs &quot;can be fully appreciated as a statement on importance of breaking through the noise and static of life to reach simple clarity and focus&quot;. Puterbaugh compared its &quot;thematic concerns&quot; to the country albums &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; (1975) by Willie Nelson and &quot;The Battle&quot; (1976) by George Jones. Many of the songs, particularly &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; and &quot;Man Out of Time&quot;, represent an embellishment of somber reflection for Costello, having experienced numerous public and personal disturbances over the past five years and having little time for rumination. Gouldstone states that every song on &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; is personal, with somewhat public themes on &quot;Man Out of Time&quot; and &quot;Pidgin English&quot; given personal embodiments. Speaking to Palmer in June 1982, Costello commented that &quot;the more personal songs are either imaginary scenarios, observations of other people, or observations of myself&quot;. The subjects in the songs are far-reaching, representing a wide range of individuals from all levels of society. After having mostly third person narrators on &quot;Trust&quot;, &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; utilises mostly first-person narrators, with third-person ones making appearances on &quot;The Long Honeymoon&quot;, &quot;...And in Every Home&quot; and &quot;You Little Fool&quot;. Despite some of the lyrical content, Costello imagined this to be his most optimistic album to date.

===Side one===
The opening track, &quot;Beyond Belief&quot;, evokes 1960s psychedelia and utilises an unusual song structure, wherein there is melodic contrast from section-to-section and the chorus does not appear until the track&#x27;s outro, to describe a tense relationship study between two mutually mismatched forces. Providing commentary on the confused state of the world, the song sets up a recurring theme where people do not learn from their mistakes. Gouldstone comments that while Costello had previous acted as an observer or outsider, with &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; he now acts in a more positive role than playing a cynical observer. AllMusic&#x27;s Bill Janovitz viewed the track&#x27;s use of vocal layering, effects and instrumentation as resembling and predating techniques of sampling and looping before their widespread use in rock. &quot;Tears Before Bedtime&quot; returns to the &quot;marital claustrophobia&quot; of numerous &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; tracks, concerning a dysfunctional relationship where the characters have given up hope that the fighting will end. Perone finds the song evidence of Costello&#x27;s continued development in aligning moods of the words and music.

&quot;Shabby Doll&quot; is an exploration of the feelings of anger and hate that come with rejection. Taking its title from an old cabaret poster Costello saw in a hotel dining room, the male character describes his female lover as a &quot;shabby doll&quot;—meaning she was once glamorous but is now past her prime—but by the end of the song, the role have reversed and he becomes the &quot;shabby doll&quot;. Like other album tracks, the song displays the artist&#x27;s acknowledgement of distributing blame evenly between men and women that began on &quot;Trust&quot;. Its themes of betrayal are aided by the tension-building instrumentation of the Attractions. &quot;The Long Honeymoon&quot; is a tale of infidelity that employs a Latin-type groove, jazz and lounge inflections on piano and French cabaret-style accordion. Perone likens its arrangement to a 1940s/1950s torch song. Its instrumental middle section boasts a rare guitar solo from Costello. Gouldstone compares its themes to the &quot;Trust&quot; numbers &quot;Big Sister&#x27;s Clothes&quot; and &quot;Shot With His Own Gun&quot;.

Costello felt the partly autobiographical &quot;Man Out of Time&quot; was the &quot;heart&quot; of the album. Bookended by a fast-paced band-led performance with screaming—the initial recorded version—&quot;Man Out of Time&quot; boasts a wall of sound production and excessive wordplay to describe three characters: the narrator, a woman and a man who holds a public position. The details are minimal and obtuse, but Gouldstone interprets it as the narrator&#x27;s plea for the woman to love him after the man has left her; if she does not love him, he loses grasp on reality. AllMusic&#x27;s Rick Anderson opined that the song presents both the &quot;best&quot; and &quot;worst&quot; of the album, but found its &quot;lush and heartbreakingly pretty&quot; production lends the chorus its emotional weight.

&quot;Almost Blue&quot;—titled after his preceding album of country covers—was based on Chet Baker&#x27;s recording of &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot;. The album&#x27;s only track that is not heavily produced, &quot;Almost Blue&quot; is played in a somber jazz and lounge style, emphasising changing harmonies. In &quot;Almost Blue&quot;, the main character is devoid of feeling as he is lost in love, which he brought upon himself, while being in a relationship that has never reached full happiness. Janovitz associated its sorrow quality to Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 1954 &quot;In the Wee Small Hours&quot; and 1958 &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; LPs and overall mood to Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; (1959). In contrast to &quot;Almost Blue&quot;, &quot;...And in Every Home&quot; vaunts the most extravagant production on the album. Its music is led by Nieve&#x27;s orchestral arrangements, which one reviewer likened to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. The lyrics depict stagnant views of relationships, whose individuals&#x27; act in age-inappropriate ways; the characters cheat on their spouses with individuals half their age in an attempt to recapture their youth. Gouldstone interprets it as a study of the waste of lives and marriage destruction. 

===Side two===
Costello described &quot;The Loved Ones&quot; as &quot;the horror of a parade of relations at the fate of a doomed and wasted youth&quot;. A mid-1960s pop number, Perone found its impressionist imagery catches a despised man in the midst of being alienated from society. &quot;Human Hands&quot; is an operatic love song about the desire for human contact, with images of masturbation and prostitution. According to Gouldstone, the narrator&#x27;s seclusion is accentuated through references to the hostility of the outside world. Like &quot;Man Out of Time&quot;, &quot;he needs love to protect him from the chaos surrounding him&quot;, although his repeated attempts result in failure. 

Costello wrote &quot;Kid About It&quot; the morning after John Lennon&#x27;s murder and reflects his mindset following the event. A gospel-inspired waltz with a simple arrangement, AllMusic&#x27;s Stewart Mason compared the track&#x27;s &quot;1950s cool jazz&quot; sound with that of &quot;Almost Blue&quot;. In &quot;Kid About It&quot;, the narrator pleads to his lover but believes she is behaving immaturely and not taking the relationship seriously. Wanting to return to a less complicated time, he is done playing games and wants to fully settle down. For his vocals, Costello sang in his lowest octave and strained on some of the higher notes, which Mason felt added &quot;vulnerability&quot; to the &quot;emotionally open lyrics&quot;. &quot;Little Savage&quot; returns to a more conventional pop/rock song style and structure. The music contrasts with the lyrical theme of the difficulties and failures of relationships, wherein the main character tells his lover his drinking eases the &quot;emotional baggage&quot; of their relationship.
&quot;Boy With a Problem&quot; mixes midcentury torch with contemporary rock and connects prominent lyrical ideals throughout the record, including alcoholism, domestic violence, impotence, relationship dysfunction and lack of self-esteem. The song depicts a marriage going through a tough period, in which the husband is drinking again and both parties are committing acts of violence on one another. The ending gives a sense of hope that she will forgive him. In a stylistic detour, &quot;Pidgin English&quot; echoes 1960s psychedelia to a major extent. Mason observes that the vocals are double-tracked in both stereo channels, giving the appearance of dueling inner dialogues. In an example of &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; focus on breaking free from the static of daily life, the song offers an expansion on the themes of &quot;Human Hands&quot;, with Perone stating that it displays &quot;numerous images of people&#x27;s inability to articulate their emotions in a stream-of-consciousness style and contrasts the resulting confusion with the oft-repeated fade-out phrase &quot;P.S. I love you&quot;. Costello elaborates that &quot;among the colloquialisms and lyrical puzzles of &#x27;Pidgin English&#x27;, there is a longing for the simple words to express love&quot;.

&quot;You Little Fool&quot; is a more straightforward number akin to mid-1960s pop equipped with a harpsichord; the author Mick St. Michael viewed it as &quot;one step&quot; from the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Mother&#x27;s Little Helper&quot; (1966). In a lyric mirroring &quot;Trust&quot; &quot;Big Sister&#x27;s Clothes&quot;, a teenage girl is ready to grow up to adulthood while her parents do not understand her nor approve of her love life. Perone says &quot;You Little Fool&quot; offers a culmination of the album&#x27;s themes of &quot;dejection over the messes people make of their lives&quot;. The final track, &quot;Town Cryer&quot;, is a soft soul ballad that uses Nieve&#x27;s orchestral arrangements to the fullest extent; by the song&#x27;s extended coda, the orchestra overtakes the rest of the band. Costello utilises heavy wordplay to portray a man who has lost at love and has reached his breaking point: he dubs himself a &quot;town crier&quot; and is anxious to make his tears public. Gouldstone argues the introspective tone comes off as a deliberate personal confession. Reviewing &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; on release, &quot;Trouser Press&quot; Scott Isler argued that the line, &quot;love and unhappiness go arm in arm&quot;, perfectly describes the album thematically. Gouldstone contends that if the album itself is a quest to improve satisfaction following the overall dissatisfaction of Costello&#x27;s earlier albums, the LP ends relatively the same as how it started; however, he maintains the journey itself has been &quot;an enriching experience&quot;, and the long fade out of &quot;Town Cryer&quot; allows the listener to process the album as a whole before it ends.

==Artwork and packaging==

The cover artwork, a painting titled &quot;Snakecharmer &amp; Reclining Octopus&quot; by Barney Bubbles (credited to &quot;Sal Forlenza&quot;), is a pastiche of Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Three Musicians&quot; (1921). Costello was taken aback upon seeing the painting for the first time, believing Bubbles had responded to &quot;the more violent and carnal aspects of the songs&quot;. The painting depicts a resting woman with laced hands surrounded by zipper-like creatures—which spell out &quot;Pablo Si&quot;—sitting next to ringmaster-type figure, wearing what Costello interpreted as a tricorn hat. In his book &quot;Let Them All Talk&quot;, Hinton describes the picture as &quot;a violent exercise in harsh red and blues&quot;. The cover won the &quot;Creem&quot; readers&#x27; poll for the best album cover of 1982. The original LP&#x27;s inner sleeve boasted photographs by David Bailey of the entire band in black-and-white. The one of Costello, in which he glares into the camera with his chin resting on his fist, was used as the sleeve photo for the &quot;Man Out of Time&quot; single.

&quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; was Costello&#x27;s first album to include a lyric sheet. In a 1995 interview with the author Peter Doggett, he explained that up until that point, he was uncomfortable with having &quot;little poems&quot; printed on the sleeve, preferring his words to be heard rather than read. Gouldstone interpreted the inclusion as to possibly not be misheard or misinterpreted. The lyrics appear in a continuous flow, without punctuation nor breaks between songs, and in all caps, which was done by Bubbles at Costello&#x27;s instruction as he wanted the final result to be a graphic effect rather than, in his words, &quot;stressing any order or hierarchy on the page&quot;. Speaking to Doggett, he said: &quot;It makes for quite interesting reading. You can make up your own lines, starting in the middle of one song and into the next one.&quot; Eric Klinger of &quot;PopMatters&quot; later argued that the sheet &quot;lent to the air of mystery and challenge to the listening&quot;, making it &quot;even more of an immersive experience&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
Although the album was finished by March 1982, its release was pushed back four months due to financial disputes between F-Beat and Columbia Records. Costello and the Attractions toured Holland and Oceania from April to June as pre-release promotion. Released on 2July 1982, &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; reached number 6 on the UK Albums Chart and number 30 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart; it spent 12 weeks overall in the UK top 100. Elsewhere, it peaked at number 18 in Norway, 30 in Sweden, 37 in New Zealand, 45 in the Netherlands and 49 in Australia. F-Beat also issued a now-rare collectible double promotional LP, titled &quot;A Conversation with Elvis Costello&quot;, featuring album tracks interspersed with comments by the artist on the makings of each track.

The album&#x27;s singles performed poorly. The first, &quot;You Little Fool&quot; backed by the Lowe-produced outtakes &quot;Big Sister&quot; and &quot;The Stamping Ground&quot;, was released in June 1982 and reached number 52 in the UK. The second, &quot;Man Out of Time&quot; backed by an alternate version of &quot;Town Cryer&quot;, was released in late-July and reached number 58; both failed to chart in the US. The label, expecting another success akin to &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, were disappointed with the performance of &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;. Costello later opined that the label&#x27;s choices of singles were poor and &quot;did little&quot; to designate the album&#x27;s change of style from previous records; he felt &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; would have performed well as the first single. The non-album single &quot;From Head to Toe&quot;, a Smokey Robinson cover, was issued in September and performed better than both &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; singles. Clayton-Lea opines that Costello was &quot;swimming against the commercial tide&quot; in the age of New Romantic bands such as Adam and the Ants, Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, the Human League and Soft Cell.

&quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; was promoted under the one-word tagline, &quot;Masterpiece?&quot;, which Thomson says attracted as much positive publicity as it did negative. After refusing to conduct interviews for several years, Costello began speaking with the press again, explaining: &quot;In the beginning [of my career], I did a few interviews, and I didn&#x27;t feel they went very well, so I just stopped doing them.[...] Then when the time went by, and I felt there were some thing that were perhaps necessary to explain, I changed my mind.&quot; According to Thomson, Costello&#x27;s initial refusal did little to help in his diminishing sales numbers, as interviews were essential to album promoting at the time. During a particular interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Greil Marcus, he atoned for an incident that occurred on the American Armed Funk Tour in March 1979, in which he insulting various American musical artists James Brown and Ray Charles, using racial slurs, in a drunken exchange with Stephen Stills. He gave further apologetic comments in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Upon release, &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; was greeted with near universal acclaim. Drawing comparisons to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, Puterbaugh declared in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Costello had written his masterpiece following years of experimentation. &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine&#x27;s Dave McCullough arguing that it sees Costello reach a &quot;kind of peak of peaks&quot;. In a highly positive review for &quot;NME&quot;, Richard Cook proclaimed: &quot;This is pop music organised to an incredible sophistication. However it has been achieved... it sets out parameters of sound that seem to alter within the inner ear: which means that Costello has finally achieved a synthesis of words and music that correlates to the duplicity of each.&quot;
Critics expressed admiration for Costello as a songwriter and artist. Several declared him the finest songwriter in pop music, earning comparisons to Lennon and McCartney, Cole Porter and George Gershwin. &quot;Smash Hits&quot; writer David Hepworth asserted: &quot;Like steel going through butter, the songs are offset by an edge that only a craftsman could manufacture.&quot; Some critics felt &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; pushed Costello to the forefront of musical innovation, despite lacking major commercial appeal. &quot;Record Review&quot; David M. Gotz argued that the artist lacked youth appeal, but his work nonetheless &quot;continues to be a stimulating experience for those who have enough time and sense to listen. [...] But he is definitely writing and performing some of the best songs in pop music.&quot; Isler argued in &quot;Trouser Press&quot; that the album&#x27;s recognition would improve over time, similar to the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966).

Reviewers highlighted the music, lyrics, Nieve&#x27;s piano and orchestral work, and Emerick&#x27;s production, although &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine questioned whether Costello&#x27;s longtime fans would appreciate it compared to the more &quot;rough-edged rock&quot; of Costello&#x27;s Lowe-produced records. Several gave high praise to the Attractions, although some noted the band played a lesser role in the arrangements compared to previous records. Reactions to Costello&#x27;s singing were mostly positive, labelled by some the strongest of his career. Others acknowledged the change in attitude from the artist&#x27;s previous albums, Barry Alfonso of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; describing &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; as &quot;the most benign album he&#x27;s recorded yet, a far cry from the bulk of his material four years ago&quot;.

Critics were, however, divided on &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; complexity. While some argued it made &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; an album that would enjoy repeated listens, others felt its concentration on complexity resulted in a &quot;pretentious&quot; and non-&quot;easy-listening&quot; final product that softened the impact of the songs. Costello&#x27;s lyrical wordplay was viewed as too cumbersome by some, but praised for its vocabulary. Ken Tucker of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; griped that &quot;In song after song, Costello forces you to become nothing more than a picky English teacher, grading his self-conscious compositions.&quot; More negatively, some believed the album was more &quot;artifice than art&quot; and lacked innovation. Bill Carlton of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote that Costello lacked the voice to convey the lyrics in an emotional way, describing the album as &quot;pompous, narrow-minded, pseudo-literary hooey mired in incoherent, desultory musical forms, boring, lifeless melodies and log-jammed lyrics&quot;.

&quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; made appearances on several lists of the year&#x27;s best albums, including number one placements by &quot;Record Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot; on its annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. &quot;NME&quot; placed it number two, behind Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Love&quot;; the publication also placed &quot;Man Out of Time&quot; as one of the year&#x27;s top ten tracks. Additionally, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked it 1982&#x27;s seventh best album, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it in their list of the year&#x27;s top 40 albums, recognising the LP as Costello&#x27;s &quot;most fully realized&quot; and &quot;most compassionate&quot; album to date. &quot;Time&quot; included it in their list of the year&#x27;s best albums.

==Tour and subsequent events==
Costello and the Attractions toured America from July to September 1982. The singer boasted more friendly on-stage demeanor compared to previous tours, including a stunt where he appeared in a full gorilla suit during the encore of the show coinciding with his 28th birthday. The setlists embraced funk and R&amp;B flavours and mostly consisted of material from &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;, &quot;Trust&quot; and &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;, as well as covers and old hits. He received backlash from fans who only wanted to hear older hits, which challenged him; he had previously rejected fan requests. Additionally, the studio craft of &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; meant the tracks, particularly &quot;...And in Every Home&quot;, &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; and &quot;Man Out of Time&quot;, were harder to play live.
Despite the massive critical success of &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;, its modest commercial performance forced Costello to reevaluate his musical style. Columbia, remaining eager for another &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, showed little interest in the artist&#x27;s less-commercial works. By 1982, Costello had garnered a loyal fanbase, largely through his own merits, but knew his heavily artistic and challenging material was doing him more harm than good, so he decided to change direction with his next record. He and the Attractions briefly toured Britain from mid-September to early-October, road-testing several new songs that would appear on 1983&#x27;s &quot;Punch the Clock&quot;.

==Retrospective appraisal==

In later decades, &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; has received acclaim as one of Costello&#x27;s best records, with some proclaiming it his masterpiece. Commentators agreed the record was Costello&#x27;s showcase as a songwriter, standing as the Bob Dylan or Van Morrison of the new wave era, and earning him the respect of musicians and critics who disregarded him as a punk rocker. In his book &quot;Let Them All Talk&quot;, Hinton proclaims &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; as &quot;an album of astonishing vitality and musical optimism&quot; that &quot;remains perhaps his most perfect achievement&quot;, occupying &quot;an aural richness&quot; that would return on 1996&#x27;s &quot;All This Useless Beauty&quot;. Reviewing Costello&#x27;s entire career, Klinger argued that its musical styles predated the artist&#x27;s collaborations with Burt Bacharach, Allen Toussaint and the Brodsky Quartet. On its 40th anniversary, Allison Rapp of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; stated that &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; was one of Costello&#x27;s most mature attempts at wrestling with one&#x27;s existentialism.

The production has been praised for its intricacy, offering a listening experience that rewards repeated listens. Others have argued the album has aged well and highlight its wordplay, and the performances of the Attractions. &quot;Mojo&quot; Mat Snow gave particular praise to Bruce Thomas&#x27;s basslines and compared them to that of Paul McCartney, calling his work &quot;models of dramatic invention&quot;. Bruce himself considered it Costello and the Attractions&#x27; best record: &quot;We were all throwing in musical ideas.&quot; In his book &quot;The Words and Music of Elvis Costello&quot;, Perone contends that the LP demonstrated that the band could thrive in a more musically expansive environment compared to previous albums. Actor Robert Downey Jr. named &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; his favourite album of all time in 2005. Speaking to &quot;Uncut&quot;, he stated: 

&quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; has not been without its detractors, particularly regarding the production. Writing for &quot;Blender&quot; magazine, Douglas Wolk stated that the &quot;hyperdense songwriting&quot; and elaborate orchestrations make for a difficult listening experience, a sentiment echoed by &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;. Others, including &quot;Treblezine&quot; Tyler Parks, have found it &quot;pretentious&quot; and &quot;obsessed with its own virtuosity&quot;, while Jason Mendelsohn of &quot;PopMatters&quot; believed its lush set pieces were the record&#x27;s greatest strength and weakness, becoming so &quot;overwrought&quot; it makes you yearn for the artist&#x27;s simpler works. Costello himself admitted in the 2002 liner notes that the record &quot;is not exactly easy listening as it is&quot;. Gouldstone argues that &quot;whatever your opinion of the production, &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; remains a collection of high-quality songs&quot;.

===Rankings===
&quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; has made appearances on several best-of lists. In 1989, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 38 on its list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. Over two decades later, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 59 in a similar 2012 list. Staff writer Huw Jones stated that the album &quot;affirms Costello as a poet laureate for the counterculture and a restless musical genius all in the space of 50 topsy-turvy minutes&quot;. Three years later, the album was also included by &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; in their list of the 100 best rock albums of the 1980s. In 1998, readers of &quot;Q&quot; magazine named it the 96th greatest album ever. Five years later in 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; at number 166 on list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list.

The album was also voted number 321 in the third edition of writer Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000), and included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Reissues==
&quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; was first released on CD through Columbia and Demon Records in January 1986. Its first extended reissue through Demon in the UK and Rykodisc in the US on CD came in May 1994, which was packaged with a slew of bonus tracks, including various outtakes and tracks recorded during sessions as Matrix Studios in February 1982. The additional material received a positive mention by David Cavanagh in &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; was again reissued by Rhino Records on 19November 2002 as a two-disc set with additional bonus tracks, including material from the initial two-week rehearsals preceding the sessions. The album was later remastered and reissued by UMe on 6November 2015.

<text>The LWS-6 Żubr (PZL.30, &quot;wisent&quot;) was a twin-engined medium bomber designed and produced by the Polish aircraft manufacturer LWS. It was only produced in limited numbers and was used for training purposes as it proved to be inferior to the contemporary PZL.37 &quot;Łoś&quot; medium bomber.

The LWS-6 was originally designed as a 12-passenger airliner during the early 1930s, but was reconfigured to produce bomber instead. During March 1936, the first prototype, designated &quot;PZL.30&quot; (or &quot;PZL.30BI&quot;), performed its maiden flight. The aircraft was accepted for a limited production run by the LWS state factory in Lublin for the Polish Air Force. During 1937, work commenced on a floatplane torpedo bomber variant, designated the &quot;LWS-5&quot;, for the Polish Navy, but work on the prototype was abandoned following setbacks. Export sales were also sought, the Romanian Air Force were reportedly considering buying up to 24 aircraft, however, following the loss of one of the prototypes on 7 November 1936 due to a mid-air structural failure, Romania ordered the rival PZL.37 &quot;Łoś&quot; instead.

During 1938, the LWS-6 was introduced to service with the Polish Air Force, which immediately assigned the type to its training units rather than frontline squadrons. Even so, its service life would be relatively brief on account of the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. Many aircraft were destroyed on the ground, none would be used in combat against Nazi Germany. Several would be captured by both the Soviet Union and Germany, leading to the type being used in secondary roles, such as training and communication, by the Luftwaffe and the Soviet Air Forces. None would survive the conflict.

==Development==
===Origins===
Work on what would become the LWS-6 originally started in 1932 as the &quot;PZL.30&quot;, a 12-passenger airliner. It had been conceived of, and primarily developed by, the Polish aeronautical engineer Zbysław Ciołkosz shortly after having joined the aircraft manufacturer PZL. It had been hoped that the Polish national flag carrier Polskie Linje Lotnicze LOT would procure the PZL.30, particularly as it had been seeking a replacement to its aging Fokker F.VII fleet at that time. While the airline did not outwardly indicate interest in the project, Polish aviation authorities opted to sponsor its development in the hope that LOT would change its mind as it neared completion. Such hopes were in vain, however, as in 1935, LOT opted to purchase American-built Douglas DC-2 airliners instead.

Another avenue for the project had prevented itself in the form of an official requirement for a new medium bomber for the Polish Air Force; Ciołkosz himself proposed producing a bomber derivative of his airliner project. This derivative attracted favourable attention not only from industry but also Polish Air Force officers; in late 1933, a special commission selected the design study for further investigation over several rival proposals. Accordingly, greater resources were promptly directed towards the project. As the detailed design took form, it became clear that the performance of the PZL.30 was unlikely to match that of a more advanced alternative medium bomber already in development at that time, the PZL.37 &quot;Łoś&quot;. However, the Department of Aeronautics identified that, as a result of the substantial differences between the &quot;Łoś&quot; and preceding aircraft, operational conversion would require extensive training, a capacity in which a more affordable auxiliary bomber would likely play a valuable role. Continuing the PZL.30&#x27;s development also enabled the project to act as a fallback option in the eventuality that the more advanced bomber encountered insurmountable technical issues. Thus, the company was instructed to proceed with constructing a single prototype. The design showed influence by French bombers, with spacious flat-sided fuselage with rich glazing.

During March 1936, the first prototype of &quot;PZL.30&quot;, designated &quot;PZL.30BI&quot;, performed its maiden flight; it was piloted by the Polish test pilot Bolesław Orliński. The occasion, which made the aircraft the first Polish twin engined bomber to take flight, occurred only three months prior to the first flight of the prototype &quot;Łoś&quot;. The manufacturer&#x27;s trials were completed by mid-1936, after which the prototype was dispatched to conduct certification and utilisation trials. While these were reportedly trouble-free, the aircraft continue to demonstrate unimpressive performance throughout; it was praised for its spacious interior amongst other things. Despite the PZL.30&#x27;s development having occurred within virtually the same timeframe as the PZL.37, the performance of the PZL.30 was noticeably inferior to its counterpart, being both slower and possessing a considerably smaller bomb load than the &quot;Łoś&quot;, yet incurring a similar per unit cost to produce.

The PZL.30 prototype had been initially powered by a pair of American Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp Junior radial engines, each capable of producing 420 hp. At the urging of the Department of Aeronautics, the company refitted the aircraft with the more powerful Bristol Pegasus VIII radial engines, sourced from the United Kingdom. To reflect this change, which became a condition for the awarding of a production contract, the prototype was redesignated as the &quot;PZL.30BII&quot;. It was flown in September 1936. The aircraft was accepted for a limited production run by the LWS state factory in Lublin, for which Ciołkosz was appointed the technical director and project lead. In older publications there could be found a designation &quot;LWS-4&quot;, but it does not appear in any documents and the aircraft&#x27;s correct designation was &quot;LWS-6&quot;.

===Design changes===
It was planned to produce 16 aircraft for the Polish Air Force, with the designation: LWS-6 &quot;Żubr&quot;. The &quot;Żubr&quot; was given a military code number 71 and the series was to have factory numbers 71.1 to 71.17, but the aircraft were given different code numbers eventually due to secrecy. The production aircraft incorporated further changes, such as a new means of undercarriage retraction; instead of the uncommon arrangement of retracting into the fuselage sides, a more conventional approach of retracting into the engine nacelles was implemented.

Development was hit by the loss of a prototype on 7 November 1936, having crashed at Michałowice shortly following a mid-air structural failure during a demonstration flight. Comprehensive static testing and other investigative techniques were applied to the design to identify the cause, which was determined to have been the de-lamination of the wing&#x27;s plywood skin. Substantial lobbying was also employed, as the aircraft was LWS&#x27;s only active project at the time and its cancellation would have had severe consequences for the company. To remedy the issue, the wing was redesigned with greater reinforcement, but this measure increased the aircraft&#x27;s overall weight, which in turn meant that the LWS-6 had a smaller bomb load than expected while other performance areas were also hampered. The factory proposed to develop new steel construction wing, 300 kg lighter, but it was not implemented.

During 1937, the factory proposed to build a floatplane torpedo bomber variant, designated the &quot;LWS-5&quot;, instead of pursuing development of the LWS-1 (R-XXA) that had been designed by Jerzy Rudlicki. It was supposed to be fitted with two Short floats of the Lublin R-XX prototype. Initially, the Polish Navy exhibited interest in the proposal, and work on the LWS-1 was cancelled despite the progress made; however, numerous problems were encountered in the LWS-5&#x27;s development, leading to work on the prototype being canceled as well. It was evident that the underpowered LWS-5 could not carry an effective offensive load.

As one part of several measures explored to improve the aircraft&#x27;s performance, a modified prototype was produced that featured a double tail fin; it conducted an initial flight near the end of 1937. However, the definitive model that would attain quantity production would only ever use a single tail fin configuration, albeit enlarged from earlier counterparts. During 1938, a series of 15 aircraft were constructed, while deliveries to the Polish Air Force commenced in early 1939.

Aside from the Polish Air Force, the Romanian Air Force showed an interest in the Żubr prototype during 1936 and, at one point, was reportedly considering the purchase of up to 24 aircraft that could have been powered by French-supplied engines. Following the fatal loss of the Pegasus-powered prototype on 7 November 1936, which had resulted the deaths of all on board, including two Romanian officers, Romania placed an order for the rival PZL.37 &quot;Łoś&quot; instead.

==Design==
The LWS-6 Żubr was a conventional high-wing cantilever twin-engined monoplane. It featured an unorthodox mixed construction approach, being largely composed of both metal and wood. The fuselage, which had a rectangular cross-section, was divided into two sections; the forward section had a duralumin structure while the remainder of the structure used welded tubular steel. The upper fuselage had a metallic exterior while a canvas covering was present on both the sides and the bottom. The wings were of wooden construction and had a plywood covering. The main undercarriage retracted into the engine nacelles, only the wheels themselves fully retracted, the legs remaining exposed and thus generating drag event in the retracted position; the aviation author Jerzy Cynk describes the arrangement as &quot;crude&quot; and of &quot;doubtful advantage&quot;. The aircraft was powered by a pair of Bristol Pegasus VIII radial engines, that typically generated up to 670 hp (500 kW), but provide additional power for take-offs of 680 hp (520 kW). These engines drove three-bladed Hamilton Standard metal propellers. The engines were license-manufactured as PZL Pegaz 8.

The LWS-6 was operated by a crew of four: a pilot, commander-bombardier, radio operator and a rear gunner. The bombardier was accommodated in the aircraft&#x27;s glazed nose, the position being provisioned with a forward-facing turret armed with twin machine guns that had a distinctive pointed &quot;beard&quot; directly beneath it. The pilot was seated underneath a sizable canopy in a forward position on the upper fuselage, which was also somewhat offset to the left. Full night-flying instrumentation was provided, along with direction-finding radio and detachable dual controls. The radio operator was seated inside the fuselege. In training role, additional crew member took place in the pilot&#x27;s cockpit on folding seat. The rear gunner operated a semi-retractable upper dorsal turret armed with twin machine guns that elevated to a working position, along with a &quot;trap&quot; ventral position that operated in an identical manner. The bombload was intended to be primarily carried within an internal bomb bay on multi-storey racks; external racks were also tested for an expanded bombing capacity. The aircraft was designed to carry 1200 kg of bombs in the bomb bay (8 bombs 50 or 100 kg), under the fuselage (4 bombs 50 or 100 kg) and under wings (4 bombs 50 kg), but maximum take-off weight limited the load to 440-660 kg.

==Operational history==
Between 1938 and 1939, a total of 15 LWS-6 bombers were delivered to the Polish Air Force. From the outset, the type was considered to be obsolete; instead of being assigned to frontline combat squadrons, the newly-delivered aircraft were allocated to training units, primarily to the 213th Training Bomber Escadrille in Małaszewicze and a training escadrille of the 1st Air Regiment. In Polish service, several shortcomings were identified on the LWS-6, such as the occasional uncommanded retraction of the undercarriage during landing. As a result, some crews would reportedly choose to fly with the undercarriage permanently locked down.

The type was exclusively used for training. Production model of the &quot;Żubr&quot; was considered safe aircraft, with good flight characteristics, and only one crashed before the war due to pilot&#x27;s error, however, without fatal injuries.

During the Invasion of Poland in September 1939, no &quot;Żubr&quot;s were recorded as having been used in actual combat. They were largely grounded, being unsuitable for operations at full-loaded weight from the temporary operational landing fields commonly being used, while flying in a lightened condition would have provided virtually no payload capacity. Several aircraft were destroyed while on the ground, most of them in Małaszewicze, a fate shared with many other training aircraft of the Polish Air Force. The Germans captured several intact LWS-6s, including the twin-tailfin prototype. These aircraft were flown by the Luftwaffe, where the type was used for blind flying training until at least 1942 (among others, in Blindflugschule Schleissheim). As a result, the LWS-6 lasted longer in Luftwaffe service than it did with the Polish Air Force.

The Soviet Union also captured four aircraft during their own invasion of Poland. These were subsequently operated by the Soviet Air Forces for a time as communication aircraft.

==Operators==
* Luftwaffe — operated captured aircraft for training purposes.
* Polish Air Force — used in non-combat roles, primarily training.
* Soviet Air Force — used four captured aircraft for communication.

<doc id="601025" wikidata="Q2555655" url="?curid=601025" title="Minkowski–Bouligand dimension">
<text>In fractal geometry, the Minkowski–Bouligand dimension, also known as Minkowski dimension or box-counting dimension, is a way of determining the fractal dimension of a bounded set formula_1 in a Euclidean space formula_2, or more generally in a metric space formula_3. It is named after the Polish mathematician Hermann Minkowski and the French mathematician Georges Bouligand.

To calculate this dimension for a fractal formula_1, imagine this fractal lying on an evenly spaced grid and count how many boxes are required to cover the set. The box-counting dimension is calculated by seeing how this number changes as we make the grid finer by applying a box-counting algorithm.

Suppose that formula_5 is the number of boxes of side length formula_6 required to cover the set. Then the box-counting dimension is defined as

formula_7

Roughly speaking, this means that the dimension is the exponent formula_8 such that formula_9, which is what one would expect in the trivial case where formula_1 is a smooth space (a manifold) of integer dimension formula_8.

If the above limit does not exist, one may still take the limit superior and limit inferior, which respectively define the upper box dimension and lower box dimension. The upper box dimension is sometimes called the entropy dimension, Kolmogorov dimension, Kolmogorov capacity, limit capacity or upper Minkowski dimension, while the lower box dimension is also called the lower Minkowski dimension.

The upper and lower box dimensions are strongly related to the more popular Hausdorff dimension. Only in very special applications is it important to distinguish between the three (see below). Yet another measure of fractal dimension is the correlation dimension.

== Alternative definitions ==

It is possible to define the box dimensions using balls, with either the covering number or the packing number. The covering number formula_12 is the &quot;minimal&quot; number of open balls of radius formula_6 required to cover the fractal, or in other words, such that their union contains the fractal. We can also consider the intrinsic covering number formula_14, which is defined the same way but with the additional requirement that the centers of the open balls lie in the set &quot;S&quot;. The packing number formula_15 is the &quot;maximal&quot; number of disjoint open balls of radius formula_6 one can situate such that their centers would be in the fractal. While formula_17, formula_18, formula_19 and formula_20 are not exactly identical, they are closely related to each other and give rise to identical definitions of the upper and lower box dimensions. This is easy to show once the following inequalities are proven:

formula_21

These, in turn, follow either by definition or with little effort from the triangle inequality.

The advantage of using balls rather than squares is that this definition generalizes to any metric space. In other words, the box definition is extrinsic – one assumes the fractal space &quot;S&quot; is contained in a Euclidean space, and defines boxes according to the external geometry of the containing space. However, the dimension of &quot;S&quot; should be intrinsic, independent of the environment into which &quot;S&quot; is placed, and the ball definition can be formulated intrinsically. One defines an internal ball as all points of &quot;S&quot; within a certain distance of a chosen center, and one counts such balls to get the dimension. (More precisely, the &quot;N&quot;covering definition is extrinsic, but the other two are intrinsic.)

The advantage of using boxes is that in many cases &quot;N&quot;(&quot;ε&quot;) may be easily calculated explicitly, and that for boxes the covering and packing numbers (defined in an equivalent way) are equal.

The logarithm of the packing and covering numbers are sometimes referred to as &quot;entropy numbers&quot; and are somewhat analogous to the concepts of thermodynamic entropy and information-theoretic entropy, in that they measure the amount of &quot;disorder&quot; in the metric space or fractal at scale &quot;ε&quot; and also measure how many bits or digits one would need to specify a point of the space to accuracy &quot;ε&quot;.

Another equivalent (extrinsic) definition for the box-counting dimension is given by the formula

formula_22

where for each &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0, the set formula_23 is defined to be the &quot;r&quot;-neighborhood of &quot;S&quot;, i.e. the set of all points in formula_24 that are at distance less than &quot;r&quot; from &quot;S&quot; (or equivalently, formula_23 is the union of all the open balls of radius &quot;r&quot; which have a center that is a member of &quot;S&quot;).

== Properties ==
The upper box dimension is finitely stable, i.e. if {&quot;A&quot;1, ..., &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;} is a finite collection of sets, then

formula_26

However, it is not countably stable, i.e. this equality does not hold for an &quot;infinite&quot; sequence of sets. For example, the box dimension of a single point is 0, but the box dimension of the collection of rational numbers in the interval [0, 1] has dimension 1. The Hausdorff dimension by comparison, is countably stable. The lower box dimension, on the other hand, is not even finitely stable.

An interesting property of the upper box dimension not shared with either the lower box dimension or the Hausdorff dimension is the connection to set addition. If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are two sets in a Euclidean space, then &quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot; is formed by taking all the pairs of points &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; where &quot;a&quot; is from &quot;A&quot; and &quot;b&quot; is from &quot;B&quot; and adding &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;. One has

formula_27

== Relations to the Hausdorff dimension ==
The box-counting dimension is one of a number of definitions for dimension that can be applied to fractals. For many well behaved fractals all these dimensions are equal; in particular, these dimensions coincide whenever the fractal satisfies the open set condition (OSC). For example, the Hausdorff dimension, lower box dimension, and upper box dimension of the Cantor set are all equal to log(2)/log(3). However, the definitions are not equivalent.

The box dimensions and the Hausdorff dimension are related by the inequality

formula_28

In general, both inequalities may be strict. The upper box dimension may be bigger than the lower box dimension if the fractal has different behaviour in different scales. For example, examine the set of numbers in the interval [0, 1] satisfying the condition

The digits in the &quot;odd place-intervals&quot;, i.e. between digits 22&quot;n&quot;+1 and 22&quot;n&quot;+2 − 1 are not restricted and may take any value. This fractal has upper box dimension 2/3 and lower box dimension 1/3, a fact which may be easily verified by calculating &quot;N&quot;(&quot;ε&quot;) for formula_29 and noting that their values behave differently for &quot;n&quot; even and odd.

Another example: the set of rational numbers formula_30, a countable set with formula_31, has formula_32 because its closure, formula_33, has dimension 1. In fact, 

formula_34

These examples show that adding a countable set can change box dimension, demonstrating a kind of instability of this dimension.

<text>Illyria is a fictional recurring character created by Joss Whedon for the television series &quot;Angel,&quot; portrayed by Amy Acker. She is credited as a main character in the last third of season 5.

== Plot summary ==
The character is introduced in a story where the main character, Fred Burkle, dies of a mysterious infection, after which her dead body becomes the host of an ancient demon, Illyria, who once ruled the world but now finds she has outlived her kingdom. Subsequent episodes featuring Illyria document her struggle with adapting to the human condition, Fred&#x27;s memories, and the continuing grief of Fred&#x27;s friends and loved ones, who make up the central cast of the show.

&quot;Illyria raises significant questions about how essence and existence are related. This is central to understanding existentialism. Whedon raises many challenges to existentialism through Illyria&#x27;s journey—from the point when she pops into existence at Fred&#x27;s death, to when she &#x27;performs Fred&#x27; as Wesley dies.&quot;

Though the character only appeared in the final episodes of &quot;Angel&quot;″s final season, Illyria appears heavily in various official and unofficial comic book continuations of the show, including licensed fictional crossover stories where Illyria is the only character from the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; television franchise to appear. The character has also been subject to analysis from academics, several of whom frame the story of Fred&#x27;s death using feminist film theory.

== Character history ==

=== Background ===
Illyria is one of the legendary Old Ones, original pure demons from the Primordium Age who ruled territory that included modern-day California. She ruled from her citadel, Vahla ha&#x27;nesh, which corresponds to modern-day Los Angeles. Illyria was eventually defeated and murdered.
Illyria had high status among the Old Ones, such that she still had followers and acolytes in the modern day. When the Old Ones became extinct, Illyria&#x27;s essence was placed in a stone sarcophagus, which was kept in a mystical graveyard known as &quot;The Deeper Well&quot; along with the coffins of other Old Ones. A warrior of good was assigned to guard the Deeper Well to prevent anyone from extracting the coffins, as Old Ones are capable of resurrection. In the 20th century, the Keeper of the Deeper Well was Drogyn the Battlebrand.

Before falling, Illyria planned her resurrection. She hid her temple in a different time plane, rendering it untouchable, until she could return to open the gateway. Illyria&#x27;s army was placed there as well. In the passing centuries, the army was destroyed.

=== Resurrection ===
As pre-ordained, Illyria&#x27;s sarcophagus is teleported to the general area of Los Angeles, but due to continental shifting, it ends up outside the United States of America. Somehow, it is delivered to American soil, but is held up in Customs on its way to Wolfram &amp; Hart. Dr. Sparrow manipulates Charles Gunn into releasing the sarcophagus. Knox, Illyria&#x27;s self-fashioned high priest and the mastermind behind her resurrection, has the sarcophagus delivered to Fred Burkle at Wolfram &amp; Hart&#x27;s science lab. Curiosity draws Fred to the sarcophagus, and upon touching one of the embedded crystals, Illyria&#x27;s essence is released into her body. Illyria&#x27;s spirit acts as an infection, liquifying Fred&#x27;s organs, hardening her skin, and allegedly consuming her soul. After hours of agony, and despite Angel and Spike&#x27;s efforts, Fred&#x27;s body is completely taken over by Illyria, who also absorbs her memories.

With the aid of Knox, Illyria attempts to bring about the destruction of humankind by resurrecting her ancient army. Despite the best efforts of Angel, Spike, and Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, she fights off all three and opens the portal to her army, only to discover it long since destroyed. Lost and without purpose, Illyria agrees to adjust to the modern world with Wesley&#x27;s help.

When Wesley mentions to her Gunn is trapped in a Wolfram &amp; Hart-imposed pseudo-Hell, Illyria opens a portal and rescues Gunn without hesitation, later noting the debt the group owes to her. In the process, she destroys eleven torture units, two troop carriers, an ice cream truck, eight &quot;beautifully maintained&quot; lawns, and &quot;rendered useless&quot; dozens of Wolfram &amp; Hart employees, according to Marcus Hamilton. At this point, her pastimes include talking to plants and training with Spike. Although she criticizes Spike&#x27;s adaptability, declaring adaptation to be a compromise, Illyria enjoys their sparring; at one point, she expresses her desire to keep him as a pet, a strange but true sign of affection.

Eventually, Illyria&#x27;s power becomes extremely unstable, and she is being thrown out of the linear progression of time, as her power seeks to escape its shell. She kills Spike, Wesley, Lorne, and Angel in confusion, but another time jump sees her drag Angel with her, who sees she will soon detonate, causing enough destruction to wipe out the continent. Angel, with foreknowledge of her outbursts, calms Illyria down, and Wesley uses a device to extract a large portion of her power, effectively ending the threat.

As a result of this intervention, Illyria is stripped of much of her strength, as well as her abilities to alter time and talk to plants. She grows bitter and withdrawn. Her primary emotional connection is with Wesley, who continues to help her adjust to the world. After recognizing Wesley&#x27;s feelings for Fred, Illyria wishes to explore her relationship with Wesley in a more sexual or romantic direction; he rejects any possibility of accepting her in Fred&#x27;s form. She also develops a connection with Spike, who treats her with acceptance and dignity.

Illyria is brutally beaten and humiliated by Hamilton, which fuels the Old One&#x27;s rage and motivates her to join the final battle against the Senior Partners. In the &quot;Angel&quot; series finale, &quot;Not Fade Away,&quot; Illyria, Spike, Wesley, Gunn, Lorne, Lindsey, and Angel fight separate groups of demons from the Circle of the Black Thorn. After killing her targets, Illyria seeks out Wesley and finds him dying. Perceiving his imminent death, she comforts Wesley in Fred&#x27;s form. Filled with unexpected and uncontrollable grief, Illyria violently dispatches his killer, Cyvus Vail, shattering his head with a single punch, before meeting the others and declaring a strong desire to &quot;do more violence.&quot; The Senior Partners send their army against the surviving members of Angel&#x27;s team; Illyria joins Angel, Gunn, and Spike in the final battle.

Interviews have revealed that had there been a sixth season of Angel, Illyria would have used Fred&#x27;s appearance more often. This would have led to an identity crisis, according to Joss Whedon.

In the canonical comic &quot;Angel: After the Fall&quot;, it is confirmed Illyria survived the final battle against the Senior Partners.

=== Literature ===
Illyria appears substantially in the comic books published by IDW Publishing following &quot;Angel&quot;″s series finale. Several titles featuring Illyria have nothing or very little to do with the larger &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; franchise. Until the advent of the canonical comics of 2007, most Illyria stories were set during season 5 of &quot;Angel&quot;. The comic book &quot;&quot; (2006) by Peter David depicts Illyria&#x27;s encounters with Fred&#x27;s friends and family, and she begins to cry when she watches home movies of Fred&#x27;s life; she later asserts to Wesley that she feels no regret. Peter David also published an &quot;Illyria&quot; crossover with his own comic book, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;. In volume one of &quot;Fallen Angel Reborn&quot; (2009), set in season 5, Illyria is transported to the dimension of Bete Noire where she attempts to reclaim her lost power; flashbacks depict her battle with the Wolf, the Ram and the Hart as well as other Old Ones; in the present day, she faces the series&#x27; heroine Liandra. Illyria appears on the cover of each issue. In the miniseries &quot;&quot;, she appears in flashbacks and as puppet in the narrative of that story, a sequel to season 5 episode &quot;Smile Time&quot;.

In canonical comics, she first appears in the second issue of &quot;&quot;, the official &quot;Angel&quot; continuation. The spin-off miniseries &quot;Spike: After the Fall&quot; charts Illyria&#x27;s journey between &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; and &quot;Angel: After the Fall&quot;. All &quot;After the Fall&quot; stories are written by Brian Lynch, who receives substantial input from creator Joss Whedon. In &quot;Angel: After the Fall&quot;, Los Angeles has been sent to hell by Wolfram &amp; Hart. Illyria is established as the Demon Lord of Beverly Hills, and working with Spike saves innocents by placing them in Connor&#x27;s care. &quot;Spike: After the Fall&quot; details their acquisition of Lord status. Throughout the series, Illyria features temporary reversions to her Fred state as the hell dimension causes her powers to go out of control. Later, when Gunn (now a vampire) kills the last of her memories of Fred, these stop, and she reverts to her primordial form and begins savaging Los Angeles. Telepathic fish Betta George is able to fill her with Spike and Wesley&#x27;s memories of Fred, and Fred&#x27;s humanity causes her to stop. Though Wolfram and Hart reverts time to before they destroyed Los Angeles, Illyria retains the memories of her experiences like everyone else. Illyria guards a hospitalized Gunn — human once more — in his hospital bed from angry demons, and her new memories of Fred make her crisis of humanity even more apparent. The two depart Los Angeles and encounter an Old One from her past. In IDW&#x27;s ongoing &quot;Angel&quot; series, Illyria attempts to seduce Connor as part of her mating cycle. She fails due to Connor&#x27;s reluctance. At one point she makes clear to Angel that while she&#x27;s not and never will be Fred, like him, she&#x27;s a formerly evil being trying to redeem their past sins.

In the comic &quot;Illyria: Haunted&quot; (2011), Illyria begins having nightmares consisting of Fred&#x27;s memories. She reaches out to an emotionally unavailable Angel and finds no comfort. Illyria then seeks out Spike for advice. He believes she should return to the Deeper Well for answers and comfort. She then, in an unprecedented show of humility, formally asks Spike for help. Spike takes Illyria to Sally, a Frellian demon who grants favors for a price. She sends them to retrieve a charm from a potential suitor of hers, and then opens a portal for Illyria to the Deeper Well. Illyria quickly dispatches the Vastari demons guarding the entrance and enters to find the new guardian is a rare matriarchal demon. The new guardian sends two Yastigilian Hounds to attack Illyria, unaware that Illyria has the knowledge to control them. Illyria explains that they are kindred species. She is granted access to the Deeper Well but is warned not to touch anything. Illyria finds nothing but Gylphs on the wall where her coffin once was and begins smashing things in disappointment. Drawn to a gem on the wall, she touches it and is magically enlightened to her new place in the world, unaware that she has accidentally released a former rival old one, Arsgomor. Illyria attempts to both fight and reason with Arsgomor until he kills one of her new Yastigilian pets. Illyria commands the local plant life to subdue Arsgomor and then degenerates him to a fetal form. She releases this new baby Arsgomor to the new guardian and returns to L.A. with her pet Yastigilian hound, Pancakes. She then uses her restored powers to open a dimensional portal and go traveling.

Subsequent to the above story, the rights to &quot;Angel&quot; characters were transferred from IDW to Dark Horse Comics, which publishes &quot;Buffy&quot;. In &quot;Angel and Faith&quot; (2012), Gunn tells Angel that Illyria is missing but presumed to be safe. She later debuts in &quot;Buffy&quot; in issue sixteen, as part of the &quot;Welcome to the Team&quot; story arc. Mid-battle, Buffy finds herself teleported to Los Angeles, where Illyria introduces herself as part of a council which needs Buffy&#x27;s help due to the consequences of Buffy destroying the seed and stripping the universe of its ambient magic. In a confrontation with the season&#x27;s villain, Severin, Illyria is stripped of her powers—including her ability to time travel—leaving her mortal and stuck in Fred&#x27;s physical appearance. She assists Buffy&#x27;s quest into its final arc, travelling into the Deeper Well alongside Buffy, Willow and Xander. Drawing on her personal experiences in &quot;Angel&quot;, she convinces Severin—whose powers threaten to rip a hole in time itself—to create a new seed, which will restore magic to the universe. Willow points out to Illyria that she is showing very human compassion, which Illyria herself recognizes. The creation of the new seed creates a powerful discharge, vaporizing Illyria and Severin both. In the follow-up series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten&quot;, Buffy expresses regret for Illyria&#x27;s death to the demon Eldre Koh. Koh is surprised by this, and tells Buffy that she does not understand Old Ones, suggesting Illyria may yet survive in some form. Later, in the &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot; book, Angel encounters Fred walking the streets of London. They surmise the recreated Seed attempted to bring Illyria back, and in the event, also brought back Fred. Now both Fred and Illyria are alive and cohabit Fred&#x27;s body.

== Powers and abilities ==

The full scope of Illyria&#x27;s power is unknown, and probably unlimited. When Illyria takes over her new &quot;shell,&quot; she possesses tremendous physical strength, far superior to that of most vampires, demons, or Slayers. Spike likens a blow from Illyria to being hit by a Mack Truck. Her strength, reflexes, and agility make her a formidable hand-to-hand combatant. Illyria uses an ancient fighting style that Spike compares to Tae Kwon Do and (fictional) Brazilian Ninjitsu. Although Spike&#x27;s adaptability gives him an occasional advantage, Illyria dominates their sparring sessions. Her skin is a hardened shell, providing her body with a heavy armor capable of withstanding blows from forged weapons, such as swords or axes. In the episode &quot;Time Bomb&quot;, she managed to single-handedly kill Spike, Wesley, Lorne and Angel in a matter of seconds, a testament of her prowess in combat.

Illyria is aided in combat by her ability to selectively alter time, which allows her to easily dodge both attacks and bullets; she can accomplish a goal and leave an area before her opponent even realizes she has moved. She has only been shown altering the flow of time to produce a slow motion effect, though it is possible that she can alter time in other ways. She can also open interdimensional portals. In the episode &quot;Underneath,&quot; Wesley Wyndam-Pryce comments on her not needing to sleep.

Illyria can alter her physical appearance on a basic level, and she is capable of recreating Fred&#x27;s persona accurately enough to fool Fred&#x27;s parents. She tells Wesley that she can take any form she chooses. Illyria has empathic abilities that allow her to perceive the emotional states of others. She was, for instance, capable of sensing Connor&#x27;s lust for her and Wesley&#x27;s frustration with Angel, as well as his grief over Fred&#x27;s death. Illyria communicates with flora, often spending hours at a time communing with a plant. She is also capable of distinguishing humans (or &quot;primitives&quot;) from demons, vampires, and other non-human life forms.

Illyria retains the insights from her experiences as an Old One, which enable her to effectively analyze the power dynamics, personal motivations, and emotions that influence those around her. She is stronger than Spike and Angel combined (having proven at one point to be able to engage both in battle simultaneously and come out victorious).

In her/its natural form, Illyria is a massive genderless cephalopod-like monster, similar to Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu, with inhuman size and numerous tentacles, with all of her powers at full capacity.

=== Powers diminished ===
After being drained by the Mutari generator, Illyria&#x27;s abilities are significantly diminished. Her physical strength is decreased (although retaining a high level of strength, well above that of Slayers, vampires and the vast majority of demons shown in the series), and she no longer has the ability to open portals or commune with plants. Wesley perceives that Illyria is no longer invulnerable, as she once was (cf. &quot;The Girl in Question&quot;) and she is later beaten unconscious by Marcus Hamilton in &quot;Power Play&quot;. In addition to this, she successfully kills several members of the Circle of the Black Thorn with minimal difficulty. She retains her ability to morph her physical appearance, and also her ability to differentiate between humans and non-humans.

In the series &quot;Angel: After the Fall&quot;, Illyria&#x27;s powers behave erratically and are closer to their full potential. Early in the series, she was shown to hold herself unarmed against a grown dragon at full strength, enduring a blast of fire from its mouth and being swallowed by it without visibly losing her taste for the fight – all this while sporting a stab wound to the torso from Angel which seemed to only offend and irritate as opposed to hurt her. Her ability to alter time, while removed by the Mutari generator, seems to have at least partially returned as a result of the aftermath of L.A.&#x27;s relocation to hell. To what extent this ability can now be used has yet to be seen; during her fight with Angel, he reverted briefly to his former human self (Liam), his puppet self (&quot;Smile Time&quot;) and a baby due to her manipulation of time, but the erratic nature of these shifts seems to indicate that she lacks any real control of her powers. Later in the series, it transpires that the only thing keeping her from her true primordial form in &quot;After the Fall&quot; are the remnants of Fred&#x27;s personality; when Gunn &#x27;kills&#x27; the Fred persona, her true Old One form is unleashed.

Following &quot;After the Fall&quot;, after the Senior Partners reversed time so that the fall never occurred, Illyria was returned to her former late-season 5 levels. In the comic book &quot;Angel: Only Human&quot;, when facing her old enemy Baticus (who had been empowered with the energy drained from Illyria by the Mutari generator) Illyria again regained some of her former power, being able to teleport and freeze time. However, when she left the scene, she lost these powers. Following this, Illyria is depicted as more compassionate in this weakened form, but must sleep at least 20 minutes for every ninety-four-hour period of activity. Subsequent to this, she appears in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine&quot; (with blue-and-black hair) and comments on her full powers having been restored. She later loses her abilities in the same arc, and appears physically identical to Fred Burkle once again, albeit dressed in her standard leather costume.

=== Powers restored ===

Later, in her own IDW miniseries (&quot;Illyria: Haunted&quot;), Illyria visits the Deeper Well and finds a blue gem embedded in a wall of art depicting her true form that causes her to undergo a transformation; her hair is now completely blue, as are her eyes (as opposed to merely her irises), and all her powers are seemingly restored to her. She can once again communicate with and control plant life. Her power is enough to face Arsgomor, another Old One, in her human form and defeat him in battle, going so far as to regress it to an unhatched egg-like form and to effortlessly open doors in space and time.

== Relationships ==
* Spike – After her resurrection, Illyria shares an emerging bond with Spike. Each is on a path from demon to hero, and they share a love of violence. Their sparring sessions are mutually satisfactory; Spike hones his fighting techniques, and Illyria is able to regularly inflict pain and dominate Spike in combat. She, at one point, expresses a desire to keep Spike as a pet. After Illyria&#x27;s powers are diminished, Spike helps her regain confidence and venture into the world again. Their relationship remains non-romantic, but develops into mutual respect. In &quot;After the Fall&quot;, Illyria apparently considers Spike a pet and comes to his defense when Angel attacks him.
* Wesley Wyndam-Pryce – Though their &quot;relationship&quot; is not a true romantic one, the undertones of attraction being based mostly on Fred and Wesley&#x27;s relationship, Wesley wanted to be around the one part of his deceased love and Illyria was influenced by Fred&#x27;s memories. When Wesley dies at the hands of Cyvus Vail, Illyria takes revenge on Cyvus by putting her fist through his skull, killing him instantly. Afterward, Illyria is the one who informs the team about Wesley&#x27;s death and says that she feels grief and wishes &quot;to do more violence&quot; in the series finale&#x27;s final battle. In &quot;After the Fall&quot; issue #9, Illyria takes ownership of Wesley&#x27;s corpse, repeating &quot;You&#x27;re staying with me.&quot;
* Charles Gunn – Possibly due to Illyria&#x27;s memories of Fred she rescues Gunn from Wolfram and Hart&#x27;s holding dimension and also tells him to not die in the finale, as he is &quot;not unpleasant&quot; to her eyes.

== Appearances ==
;&quot;Angel&quot; (2004)
:Illyria was a regular towards the end of the &quot;Angel&quot;&#x27;s fifth season in 2004, first appearing in &quot;A Hole in the World,&quot; replacing Fred. Technically, since she is played by the same actress as Fred, it could be said that she was credited as a regular from her first appearance, but the first instance of the opening sequence showing Amy Acker specifically as Illyria and not Fred is in &quot;Underneath&quot;. Illyria appears in 8 episodes in total.

Illyria has also appeared in &quot;Angel&quot; expanded universe material such as comics, most notably her own one-shot comic &quot;&quot; in 2006.

;&quot;&quot; (2007–2011)
:Central to the &quot;Angel the Fall&quot; storyline, Illyria has appeared in all but the first issue and the &quot;First Night&quot; stories of issues #7-8. She also appears in all four issues of the spin-off comic book series &quot;Spike: After the Fall&quot;, as well as &quot;Angel: Only Human&quot; with Gunn and her own miniseries, &quot;Illyria: Haunted&quot;. She also briefly appears in the first issue of Spike&#x27;s miniseries.

;&quot;Fallen Angel&quot; (2009)
:Illyria appears in the four part comic book series of Peter David&#x27;s &quot;Fallen Angel Reborn&quot; in 2009. According to PAD, &quot;The story is set early in Illyria&#x27;s involvement with Angel &amp; Co. Having been deprived of her power by Wesley, she is drawn to [the town of] Bete Noire as a potential source for not only becoming what she was before, but even achieving her previous status. Remember, what we see of her in &quot;Angel&quot; is not her true appearance.&quot;

;&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine&quot; (2012–2013)
:Illyria debuts in issue 16, &quot;Welcome to the Team, Part One.&quot;

;&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten&quot; (2014–2016)
:In Angel &amp; Faith issue #10 Fred&#x27;s soul was restored with The Return of The Magic. And Illyria was restored in Fred&#x27;s vessel too. In the next issues, Illyria tries to take control of the vessel for revenge of her hominid times.

<text>Iteration marks are characters or punctuation marks that represent a duplicated character or word.

==Chinese==
In Chinese, or (usually appearing as , equivalent to the modern ideograph ) or is used in casual writing to represent a doubled character. However, it is not used in formal writing anymore, and it rarely appeared in printed matter. In a tabulated table or list, vertical repetition can be represented by a ditto mark ().

===History===
Iteration marks have been occasionally used for more than two thousand years in China. The example image shows an inscription in bronze script, a variety of formal writing dating to the Zhou dynasty, that ends with , where the small (&quot;two&quot;) is used as iteration marks in the phrase (&quot;descendants to use and to treasure&quot;).

==Malayo-Polynesian languages==

In Filipino, Indonesian, and Malay, words that are repeated can be shortened with the use of numeral &quot;2&quot;. For example, the Malay (&quot;words&quot;, from single ) can be shortened to , and (&quot;to walk around&quot;, from single ) can be shortened to . The usage of &quot;2&quot; can be also replaced with superscript &quot;&quot; (e.g. for ). The sign may also be used for reduplicated compound words with slight sound changes, for example for (&quot;commotion&quot;). Suffixes may be added after &quot;2&quot;, for example in the word (&quot;Western in nature&quot;, from the basic word (&quot;West&quot;) with the prefix and suffix ).

The use of this mark dates back to the time when these languages were written with Arabic script, specifically the Jawi or Pegon varieties. Using the Arabic numeral , words such as (, butterfly) can be shortened to . The use of Arabic numeral was also adapted to several Brahmi derived scripts of the Malay archipelago, notably Javanese, Sundanese, Lontara, and Makassaran. As the Latin alphabet was introduced to the region, the Western-style Arabic numeral &quot;2&quot; came to be use for Latin-based orthography.

The use of &quot;2&quot; as an iteration mark was official in Indonesia up to 1972, as part of the Republican Spelling System. Its usage was discouraged when the Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System was adopted, and even though it is commonly found in handwriting or old signage, it is considered to be inappropriate for formal writing and documents.

==Japanese==
Japanese has various iteration marks for its three writing systems, namely kanji, hiragana, and katakana, but only the kanji iteration mark () is commonly used today.

In Japanese, iteration marks called , , , or are used to represent a duplicated character representing the same morpheme. For example, , &quot;people&quot;, is usually written , using the kanji for with an iteration mark, , rather than , using the same kanji twice. The use of two kanji in place of an iteration mark is allowed, and in simple cases may be used due to being easier to write.

In contrast, while is written with the iteration mark, as the morpheme is duplicated, is written with the character duplicated, because it represents different morphemes ( and ). Further, while can in principle be written as , cannot be written as , since that would imply repetition of the sound as well as the character. In potentially confusing examples such as this, readings can be disambiguated by writing words out in hiragana, so is often found as or rather than .

Sound changes can occur in duplication, which is not reflected in writing; examples include and being pronounced () or and being pronounced (gemination), though this is also pronounced .

===Kanji===
The formal name of the kanji repetition symbol () is , literally &quot;same character mark&quot;, but it is sometimes called because it looks like the katakana and . This symbol originates from a simplified form of the character , a variant of written in the grass script style.

Although Japanese kanji iteration marks are borrowed from Chinese, the grammatical function of duplication differs, as do the conventions on the use of these characters.

While Japanese does not have a grammatical plural form &quot;per se&quot;, some kanji can be reduplicated to indicate plurality (as a collective noun, not many individuals). This differs from Chinese, which normally repeats characters only for the purposes of adding emphasis, although there are some exceptions (e.g., , , &quot;person&quot;; , , &quot;everybody&quot;).
* ; 

However, for some words duplication may alter the meaning:
* ; 

Using instead of repeating kanji is usually the preferred form, with two restrictions:
* the reading must be the same, possibly with sound change (as above), and
* the repetition must be within a single word.

When the reading is different, the second kanji is often simply written out to avoid confusion. Examples of such include:
* 

The repetition mark is not used in every case where two identical characters appear side by side, but only where the repetition itself is etymologically significant—when the repetition is part of a single word. Where a character ends up appearing twice as part of a compound, it is usually written out in full:

* , from + (&quot;democracy&quot; + &quot;principle&quot;); the abbreviated is only occasionally seen. One notable exception is in signs for – the name of neighborhoods often end in , which is then suffixed with yielding , which is then informally abbreviated to , despite the word break.

Similarly, in certain Chinese borrowings, it is generally preferred to write out both characters, as in ( Chinese multiplication table) or ( dan dan noodles), though in practice is often used.

In vertical writing, the character (Unicode U+303B), a cursive derivative of (&quot;two&quot;, as in Chinese, above), can be employed instead, although this is increasingly rare.

===Kana===
Kana uses different iteration marks; one for hiragana, , and one for katakana, . The hiragana iteration mark is seen in some personal names like or , and it forms part of the formal name of the car company .

Unlike the kanji iteration marks, which do not reflect sound changes, kana iteration marks closely reflect sound, and the kana iteration marks can be combined with the voicing mark to indicate that the repeated syllable should be voiced, for example . If the first syllable is already voiced, for example , the voiced repetition mark still needs to be used: rather than , which would be read as .

While widespread in old Japanese texts, the kana iteration marks are generally not used in modern Japanese outside proper names, though they may appear in informal handwritten texts.

===Repeating multiple characters===
In addition to the single-character iteration marks, there are also two-character-sized repeat marks, which are used to repeat the preceding word or phrase. They are used in vertical writing only, and they are effectively obsolete in modern Japanese. The vertical kana repeat marks (unvoiced) and (voiced) resemble the hiragana character , giving them their name, . They stretch to fill the space typically occupied by two characters, but may indicate a repetition of more than two characters. For example, the duplicated phrase may be repeated as . If a (voiced mark) is added, it applies to the first sound of the repeated word; this is written as . For example, could be written horizontally as ; the voiced iteration mark only applies to the first sound .

In addition to the single-character representations and , Unicode provides the half-character versions , and , which can be stacked to render both voiced and unvoiced repeat marks:

As support for these is limited, the ordinary forward slash and backward slash are occasionally used as substitutes.

Alternatively, multiple single-character iteration marks can be used, as in or . This practice is also uncommon in modern writing, though it is occasionally seen in horizontal writing as a substitute for the vertical repeat mark.

Unlike the single-kana iteration mark, if the first kana is voiced, the unvoiced version alone will repeat the voiced sound.

Further, if are present, then no iteration mark should be used, as in . This is prescribed by the Japanese Ministry of Education in its 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes, rule #6.

==Nuosu==

In the Nuosu language, is used to represent a doubled sound, for example , . It is used in all forms of writing.

==Tangut==

In Tangut manuscripts the sign is sometimes used to represent a doubled character; this sign does not occur in printed texts. In Unicode this character is , in the Ideographic Symbols and Punctuation block.

==Egyptian hieroglyphs==
In Egyptian hieroglyphs, the signs: zp:Z1*Z1   —   , literally meaning &quot;two times&quot;, repeat the previous sign or word.

==Khmer, Thai and Lao==
In Khmer, () as for Thai, () and Lao, () represent a repeated syllable where as it besides the word. This used to be written as numeral two () and the form changed over time. A repeated word could be used either, to demonstrate plurality, to emphasize or to soften the meaning of the original word.

== Ditto mark ==

In English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Czech, Polish and Turkish lists, the ditto mark (″) represents a word repeated from the equivalent position in the line above it; or an evenly-spaced row of ditto marks represents any number of words repeated from above. For example:

* Two pounds of lettuce
* Three   ″      ″ tomatoes
* Four     ″      ″ onions
* One pound  ″ carrots

This is common in handwriting and formerly in typewritten texts.

In Unicode, the ditto mark of Western languages has been defined to be equivalent to the . The separate character is to be used in the CJK scripts only.

The convention in Polish handwriting, Czech, Swedish, and Austrian German is to use a ditto mark on the baseline together with horizontal lines spanning the extent of the word repeated, for example:
* 

== Superscript numeral ==

In western mathematics, the superscript numeral originated as a notation for exponentiation. Over time its meaning expanded to represent repeated function application as well, effectively making it a notation for marking iteration. This sense was eventually borrowed in non mathematical text to represent repeated symbols, especially to mark repeated letters in acronyms. The superscript is occasionally left out, either colloquially or in the formal representation of the acronym, due to either typographic or stylistic concerns. Notable examples include the bus protocol I²C, and the fan-fiction hosting website AO3.

<text>The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority is a UK government research organisation responsible for the development of fusion energy. It is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ).

The authority focuses on United Kingdom and European fusion energy research programmes at Culham in Oxfordshire, including the world&#x27;s most powerful operating fusion device, the Joint European Torus (JET). The research aims to develop fusion power as a commercially viable, environmentally responsible energy source for the future.

A record 59 megajoules of sustained fusion energy was demonstrated by scientists and engineers working on JET in December 2021. In JET&#x27;s final deuterium-tritium experiments (DTE3), high fusion power was consistently produced for 5 seconds, resulting in a ground-breaking record of 69 megajoules using a mere 0.2 milligrams of fuel. JET has now ceased operating and decommissioning has commenced.

United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority owns the Culham Science Centre and has a stake in the Harwell Campus, and is involved in the development of both sites as locations for science and innovation-based business.

On its formation in 1954, the authority was responsible for the United Kingdom&#x27;s entire nuclear programme, both civil and defence, as well as the policing of nuclear sites. It made pioneering developments in nuclear (fission) power, overseeing the development of nuclear technology and performing much scientific research. However, since the early 1970s its areas of work have been gradually reduced, with functions transferred to other government organisations as well as to the private sector.

UKAEA has also been involved in undertaking safety and reliability assessments for outside bodies, due to its long running experience in such work within the nuclear field.

==History==
The authority was established on 19 July 1954 when the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954 received royal assent and gave the authority the power &quot;to produce, use and dispose of atomic energy and carry out research into any matters therewith&quot;.

The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority was formed from the Ministry of Supply, Department of Atomic Energy and inherited its facilities and most of its personnel on its formation.

The first chairman was Sir Edwin Plowden, with board members running the three major divisions:
* Industrial Group: Sir Christopher Hinton
* Research Group: Sir John Cockcroft
* Weapons Group: Sir William Penney

The authority inherited nearly 20,000 employees, which doubled to 41,000 by 1961. Most of the authority&#x27;s early activities were related to the United Kingdom&#x27;s nuclear weapons programme, and the need for plutonium, highly enriched uranium, and materials for hydrogen bombs. Between 1952 and 1958 UKAEA carried out 21 nuclear weapon tests in Australia and the Pacific.

Following the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1971, the authority was split into three, with only research activities remaining with the authority. The Radiochemical Centre Ltd took over production of medical and industrial radioisotopes and was later privatised in 1982 as Amersham plc. British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) took over nuclear fuel and weapons material producing activities: the manufacturing plant at Springfields, the enrichment plant at Capenhurst, the spent-fuel facility at Windscale, and the dual-purpose Calder Hall and Chapelcross military plutonium producing reactors.

The Atomic Energy Authority (Weapons Group) Act 1973 transferred responsibility for management of the UK&#x27;s nuclear deterrent, including the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston, directly to the Ministry of Defence.

In 1982 the authority was involved in the creation of Nirex, to develop and operate radioactive waste disposal facilities in the United Kingdom.

The Atomic Energy Authority Act 1986 put the authority into trading fund mode, requiring it to act and account as though it were a commercial enterprise and become self-financing.

The authority was then split again by the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1995, with the more commercial parts transferred into a public company AEA Technology, which was then floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. The nuclear facilities used for the UK&#x27;s research and development programme, which held large decommissioning liabilities, were retained. The role of the authority became to decommission these nuclear assets and to restore the environment around the sites. From the early 1990s the authority completed more decommissioning work than anyone in Europe, and had considerable success in regenerating former nuclear sites for commercial use.
===21st century===
Following the Energy Act 2004, on 1 April 2005 the UK&#x27;s specialist nuclear police force, the UK Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary, was reconstituted as the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Responsibility for the force was also removed from the authority and transferred to the Civil Nuclear Police Authority. The 2004 Act also established the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), which on 1 April 2005 took ownership and responsibility for the liabilities relating to the cleanup of UK nuclear sites. The authority became a contractor for the NDA for the decommissioning work at Dounreay, Harwell, Windscale, Winfrith and the JET facilities at Culham.

On 1 April 2008, the Authority announced a major re-structuring to meet its decommissioning obligations with the NDA. A new wholly owned subsidiary, UKAEA Limited, was formed with established expertise from the existing company, to focus on nuclear decommissioning and environmental restoration management and consultancy in the United Kingdom and international markets.

At the same time, Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL) was formed out of the existing Authority team at Dounreay and was licensed by the Health and Safety Executive to operate the site and carry out its decommissioning under the Authority&#x27;s management. DSRL became a subsidiary of United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Limited.

In parallel with these changes, the site at Windscale in Cumbria was transferred to Sellafield Ltd, a site licence company under contract to the NDA, following close review and scrutiny by the Health and Safety Executive and environmental and security regulators. The majority of authority employees at the site transferred to Sellafield Ltd.

On 2 February 2009, the authority announced the next stage in restructuring. Research Sites Restoration Limited (RSRL), was formed from the existing teams at Harwell in Oxfordshire and Winfrith in Dorset and licensed by the Health and Safety Executive to operate those sites. RSRL continued the decommissioning programmes for Harwell and Winfrith on behalf of the NDA. RSRL also became a subsidiary of UKAEA Limited.

In October 2009, Babcock International Group plc acquired UKAEA Limited, the nuclear clean-up subsidiary of the authority, including its subsidiary companies DSRL and RSRL.

In 2009 the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy (CCFE) was launched as the new name for the home of United Kingdom fusion research.

In 2014 UKAEA announced the creation of a new branch of research, using expertise gained from the remote handling system created for JET to form a new centre for robotics known as RACE (Remote Applications in Challenging Environments).
The Authority has continued to expand its facilities at Culham in recent years, with the opening of a Materials Research Facility in 2016 and creation of the Oxfordshire Advanced Skills apprentice training centre.

== Current activities ==
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority states its mission as &quot;To lead the delivery of sustainable fusion energy and maximise the scientific and economic benefit.&quot; Its research programmes include a number of laboratories and other facilities at the Culham site.
=== Facilities and programmes ===

==== Culham Centre for Fusion Energy (CCFE) ====

The UK&#x27;s national laboratory for fusion research, CCFE undertakes plasma theory and modelling studies to establish the physics basis for future fusion powerplants. It also studies the materials and engineering technology of tokamak fusion reactors. The centrepiece of CCFE&#x27;s programme is the MAST Upgrade spherical tokamak experiment - the successor to the MAST device - which is expected to begin operation in 2019.

CCFE also operates and maintains the Joint European Torus (JET) for its research partners around Europe, and is a member of the co-ordinated R&amp;D programme led by the EUROfusion consortium.

==== Materials Research Facility ====
UKAEA&#x27;s Materials Research Facility carries out micro-characterisation of radioactive materials for researchers in both fusion energy and nuclear fission. It is open to users from academic and commercial organisations, aiming to bridge the gap between university laboratories and those at nuclear licensed sites. It is part of the National Nuclear Users&#x27; Facility and has received funding from the Henry Royce Institute. On the 14th of October 2022 the Materials Research Facility opened its extension.

==== Oxfordshire Advanced Skills ====
A partnership between United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and the Science &amp; Technology Facilities Council, Oxfordshire Advanced Skills is an apprentice training centre located at Culham Science Centre. It offers training for technicians in engineering and hi-tech disciplines, with the intention of providing employers with highly skilled recruits ready to enter the workplace. Training is provided by the Manufacturing Technology Centre.

==== Remote Applications in Challenging Environments (RACE) ====

RACE is a test facility for robotics and autonomous systems. It grew out of UKAEA&#x27;s remote handling operations at the JET nuclear fusion device, which date back to the 1990s. The UK Government funded the construction of the RACE centre at Culham with the intention of taking the knowledge gained at JET into other industries with &#x27;challenging environments&#x27; where it is difficult for humans to perform work. RACE currently works with organisations in nuclear fusion and fission, with large physics facilities and with autonomous vehicle developers.

==== Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) ====

The £220 million STEP programme aims to accelerate the delivery of fusion power to the energy market. STEP will be a prototype powerplant capable of demonstrating fusion as a viable technology for electricity generation. It uses the compact &#x27;spherical tokamak&#x27; concept developed by UKAEA at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. STEP is currently in a five-year conceptual design phase and is expected to be constructed and operational by 2040.

== H3AT and FTF ==
In December 2017, UKAEA announced plans for two further fusion research centres: Hydrogen-3 Advanced Technology (H3AT) and Fusion Technology Facilities. H3AT, located at Culham, will study the processing and storage of tritium, one of the two fuels expected to supply commercial fusion reactors. The Fusion Technology Facilities, based at both Culham and at a new UKAEA Yorkshire site in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, carries out thermal, mechanical, hydraulic and electromagnetic tests on prototype components to replicate the conditions experienced inside fusion reactors.

<text>In geometry, Pedoe&#x27;s inequality (also Neuberg–Pedoe inequality), named after Daniel Pedoe (1910–1998) and Joseph Jean Baptiste Neuberg (1840–1926), states that if &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are the lengths of the sides of a triangle with area &quot;ƒ&quot;, and &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; are the lengths of the sides of another triangle with area &quot;F&quot;, then

:formula_1

with equality if and only if the two triangles are similar with pairs of corresponding sides (&quot;A, a&quot;), (&quot;B, b&quot;), and (&quot;C, c&quot;).

The expression on the left is not only symmetric under any of the six permutations of the set { (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;a&quot;), (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), (&quot;C&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) } of pairs, but also—perhaps not so obviously—remains the same if &quot;a&quot; is interchanged with &quot;A&quot; and &quot;b&quot; with &quot;B&quot; and &quot;c&quot; with &quot;C&quot;. In other words, it is a symmetric function of the pair of triangles.

Pedoe&#x27;s inequality is a generalization of Weitzenböck&#x27;s inequality, which is the case in which one of the triangles is equilateral.

Pedoe discovered the inequality in 1941 and published it subsequently in several articles. Later he learned that the inequality was already known in the 19th century to Neuberg, who however did not prove that the equality implies the similarity of the two triangles.

==Proof==
By Heron&#x27;s formula, the area of the two triangles can be expressed as:
:formula_2
:formula_3

and then, using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have,
:formula_4
:formula_5
:formula_6
So,
:formula_7
:formula_8 
and the proposition is proven.

Equality holds if and only if formula_9, that is, the two triangles are similar.

<text>The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-141, 107 Stat. 1488 (November 16, 1993), codified at through (also known as RFRA, pronounced &quot;rifra&quot;), is a 1993 United States federal law that &quot;ensures that interests in religious freedom are protected.&quot; The bill was introduced by Congressman Chuck Schumer (D–NY) on March 11, 1993. A companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Ted Kennedy (D-MA) the same day. A unanimous U.S. House and a nearly unanimous U.S. Senate—three senators voted against passage—passed the bill, and President Bill Clinton signed it into law.

The law was passed in response to the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s 1990 decision in &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot;, which held that &quot;neutral laws of general applicability&quot; that burden the free exercise of religion do not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. RFRA requires that strict scrutiny be applied to any law that burdens religious freedom, providing that such a law may only be justified if it is the least restrictive means of pursuing a compelling government interest.

While RFRA initially applied to both state and federal laws, its application to state governments was held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the &quot;City of Boerne v. Flores&quot; decision in 1997, which ruled that the RFRA is not a proper exercise of Congress&#x27;s enforcement power. However, it continues to be applied to the federal government—for instance, in &quot;Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal&quot; (2006) and &quot;Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.&quot; (2014). In response to &quot;City of Boerne v. Flores&quot; and other related RFR issues, twenty-one individual states have passed State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts that apply to state governments and local municipalities.

==Provisions==
This law reinstated the Sherbert Test, which was set forth by &quot;Sherbert v. Verner&quot;, and &quot;Wisconsin v. Yoder&quot;, mandating that strict scrutiny be used when determining whether the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing religious freedom, has been violated. In the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Congress states in its findings that a religiously neutral law can burden a religion just as much as one that was intended to interfere with religion; therefore, the Act states that the &quot;Government shall not substantially burden a person&#x27;s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.&quot;

The law provided an exception if two conditions are met. First, the burden must be necessary for the &quot;furtherance of a compelling government interest.&quot; Under strict scrutiny, a government interest is compelling when it is more than routine and does more than simply improve government efficiency. A compelling interest relates directly to core constitutional issues. The second condition is that the rule must be the least restrictive way in which to further the government interest.

==Background and passage==

The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment states that Congress shall not pass laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion. In the 1960s, the Supreme Court interpreted this as banning laws that burdened a person&#x27;s exercise of religion (e.g. &quot;Sherbert v. Verner&quot;, 374 U.S. 398 (1963); &quot;Wisconsin v. Yoder&quot;, 406 U.S. 205 (1972)). But in the 1980s the Court began to allow legislation that incidentally prohibited religiously mandatory activities as long as the ban was &quot;generally applicable&quot; to all citizens.

But &quot;generally applicable&quot; bans frequently conflicted with Native American religious practice. Often, government projects required acquisition of sacred grounds necessary for Native American rituals. Ritual peyote use infringed on the federal war on drugs. And the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, which Congress had passed to protect tribal religious freedoms, lacked an enforcement mechanism.

These interests collided in &quot;Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association&quot;, 485 U.S. 439 (1988), and &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot;, 494 U.S. 872 (1990).

In &quot;Lyng&quot;, members of the Yurok, Tolowa and Karok tribes argued that the First Amendment should prevent the U.S. Forest Service from constructing a road through sacred land used in ceremonies and prayer. The Supreme Court disagreed, arguing that only government coercion or punishment for religious beliefs would violate the First Amendment.

In &quot;Smith&quot;, the Court upheld the state of Oregon&#x27;s refusal to grant unemployment benefits to two Native Americans fired from their jobs at a rehab clinic after testing positive for mescaline, the main psychoactive compound in the peyote cactus, which they had used in a religious ceremony.

The &quot;Smith&quot; decision outraged the public. Groups representing all points on the political spectrum (from the liberal American Civil Liberties Union to the conservative Traditional Values Coalition) and a wide variety of religions (i.e. the Christian Legal Society, the American Jewish Congress, the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, and the National Association of Evangelicals) agreed that the law required reform, and recommended reinstating the &quot;Sherbert&quot; Test. In response, Congress passed the RFRA, unanimously in the House and 97-to-3 in the Senate. The bill was then signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton.

===Applicability===
The RFRA applies &quot;to all Federal law, and the implementation of that law, whether statutory or otherwise&quot;, including any Federal statutory law adopted after the RFRA&#x27;s date of signing &quot;unless such law explicitly excludes such application.&quot;

According to a federal appeals court ruling on March 7, 2018, the RFRA did not justify discrimination against employees on the basis of their lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender identity in those circumstances. However, on October 15, 2019, federal judge Reed O’Connor said that, because of the RFRA, federally-funded healthcare insurers and providers must be allowed to deny medical treatment and coverage on the basis of the sex, gender identity or termination of pregnancy of the person who is requesting the services, even if the services are medically necessary. Transgender people may be turned down even if the healthcare service they need is not related to their being transgender.

==Challenges and weaknesses==
In 1997, part of this act was overturned by the United States Supreme Court. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio wanted to enlarge a church in Boerne, Texas, but a Boerne ordinance protected the building as a historic landmark and did not permit it to be torn down. The church sued, citing RFRA, and in the resulting case, &quot;City of Boerne v. Flores&quot;, , the Supreme Court struck down the RFRA with respect to its applicability to States (but not Federally), stating that Congress had stepped beyond its power of enforcement provided in the Fourteenth Amendment. In response to the &quot;Boerne&quot; ruling, Congress passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) in 2000, which grants special privileges to religious land owners.

A number of states have passed state RFRAs, applying the rule to the laws of their own state, but the &quot;Smith&quot; case remains the authority in these matters in many states.

The constitutionality of RFRA as applied to the federal government was confirmed on February 21, 2006, as the Supreme Court ruled against the government in &quot;Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal&quot;, , which involved the use of an otherwise illegal substance in a religious ceremony, stating that the federal government must show a compelling state interest in restricting religious conduct.

Post-&quot;Smith&quot;, many members of the Native American Church still had issues using peyote in their ceremonies. This led to the Religious Freedom Act Amendments in 1994, which state, &quot;the use, possession, or transportation of peyote by an Indian for bona fide traditional ceremony purposes in connection with the practice of a traditional Indian religion is lawful, and shall not be prohibited by the United States or any state. No Indian shall be penalized or discriminated against on the basis of such use, possession or transportation.&quot;

&quot;Tanzin v. Tanvir&quot; (2020) determined that RFRA allows for those whose religious rights are adversely affected by federal officers acting in their capacity for the government to seek appropriate remedies, including monetary damages, from those individuals. The case involved three Muslim men, all legal residents of the United States, who had been placed on the No Fly List by FBI agents for refusing to be informants for their fellow Muslim communities.

==Applications and effects==

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act holds the federal government responsible for accepting additional obligations to protect religious exercise. In &quot;O&#x27;Bryan v. Bureau of Prisons&quot;, it was found that the RFRA governs the actions of federal officers and agencies and that the RFRA can be applied to &quot;internal operations of the federal government.&quot; RFRA, in conjunction with President Bill Clinton&#x27;s executive order in 1996, provided more security for sacred sites for Native American religious rites.

As of 1996, the year before the RFRA was found unconstitutional as applied to states, 337 cases had cited RFRA in its three-year time range. It was also found that Jewish, Muslim, and Native American religions, which make up only three percent of religious membership in the U.S., make up 18 percent of the cases involving the free exercise of religion.
The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was a cornerstone for tribes challenging the National Forest Service&#x27;s plans to permit upgrades to Arizona&#x27;s Snowbowl ski resort. Six tribes were involved, including the Navajo, Hopi, Havasupai, and Hualapai. The tribes objected on religious grounds to the plans to use reclaimed water. They felt that this risked infecting the tribal members with &quot;ghost sickness&quot; as the water would be from mortuaries and hospitals. They also felt that the reclaimed water would contaminate the plant life used in ceremonies. In August 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected their RFRA claim.

In the case of &quot;Adams v. Commissioner&quot;, the United States Tax Court rejected the argument of Priscilla M. Lippincott Adams, who was a devout Quaker. She tried to argue that under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, she was exempt from federal income taxes. The U.S. Tax Court rejected her argument and ruled that she was not exempt. The Court stated that &quot;while petitioner&#x27;s religious beliefs are substantially burdened by payment of taxes that fund military expenditures, the Supreme Court has established that uniform, mandatory participation in the Federal income tax system, irrespective of religious belief, is a compelling governmental interest.&quot; In the case of &quot;Miller v. Commissioner&quot;, the taxpayers objected to the use of social security numbers, arguing that such numbers related to the &quot;mark of the beast&quot; from the Bible. In its decision, the U.S. Court discussed the applicability of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, but ruled against the taxpayers.

In &quot;Navajo Nation v. United States Forest Service&quot;, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the use of recycled sewage water in order to manufacture artificial snow in the San Francisco Peaks was not a &quot;substantial burden&quot; on the religious freedom of Native Americans.

The RFRA figured prominently in oral arguments in the case, &quot;Burwell v. Hobby Lobby,&quot; heard by the Supreme Court on March 25, 2014. In a 5–4 decision, Justice Alito declared that nothing about the language of RFRA or the manner in which Congress passed it implied the statutory protections conferred therein were confined solely within the bounds of First Amendment case law as it existed pre-&quot;Smith&quot;.

==20th anniversary==
A day-long symposium was held at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 7, 2013, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. &quot;Restored or Endangered? The State of the Free Exercise of Religion in America&quot; featured three panel discussions and two keynote addresses.

The first keynote address was from Oliver S. Thomas, the former general counsel of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty and the chair of the diverse &quot;Coalition for the Free Exercise of Religion&quot; in the 1990s that worked for the passage of RFRA. The second was from Douglas Laycock, who was an author of RFRA. His address traced the legal history of RFRA and discussed its impact on current debates, including the contraception mandate and same-sex marriage laws.

The panel discussions covered the history and impact of RFRA, religious freedom and the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act, and current and future challenges to the free exercise of religion in a diverse society. The addresses and panel discussions are all available online, as well as a special downloadable resource with more on RFRA, published by the Baptist Joint Committee.

<doc id="601066" wikidata="Q5123597" url="?curid=601066" title="City of Boerne v. Flores">
<text>City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States concerning the scope of Congress&#x27;s power of enforcement under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case also had a significant impact on historic preservation.

In this case, the Court struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), as it applied to the states, stating the statute was an unconstitutional use of Congress&#x27;s enforcement powers. Legal scholars have criticized this case stating that, &quot;Without RFRA, questions of religious freedom will be decided in different ways in different states, and even for different religious groups.&quot; Scholars also stated that, &quot;This places smaller religions at a relative disadvantage- a situation inconsistent with the governing ideal of the Fourteenth Amendment.&quot;

==Facts==
The basis for dispute arose when the Catholic Archbishop of San Antonio, Patrick Flores, applied for a building permit to enlarge the 1923 mission-style St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Boerne, Texas, which was originally built by German residents. The building was located in a historic district and considered a contributing property. Local zoning authorities denied the permit, citing an ordinance governing additions and new construction in a historic district. The archbishop brought suit, challenging the ruling under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. Flores argued that the Boerne, Texas, congregation had outgrown the existing structure, rendering the ruling a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion without a compelling state interest.

==Religious Freedom Restoration Act==
RFRA had been crafted as a direct response to the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot;, when the Court had upheld, against a First Amendment challenge, an Oregon law criminalizing peyote use, which was used in Native American religious rituals. The State of Oregon won on the basis that the drug laws were &quot;non-discriminatory laws of general applicability.&quot;

Religious groups became concerned that this case would be cited as precedent for further regulation of common religious practices and lobbied Congress for legislative protection. RFRA provided a strict scrutiny standard, requiring narrowly tailored regulation serving a compelling government interest in any case substantially burdening the free exercise of religion, regardless of the intent and general applicability of the law.

The RFRA applies to all laws passed by Congress prior to its enactment and to all future laws that are not explicitly exempted. (42 U.S. Code § 2000bb–3) Congress&#x27;s power to do so was not challenged. Congress also applied the law to state and local governments - in this case, the City of Boerne - relying on the Fourteenth Amendment, particularly Section 5: &quot;The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.&quot;

==Result==

===District Court===
The City of Boerne was successful at the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas; the district judge certified the question of the constitutionality of RFRA to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which found the RFRA constitutional. Boerne filed a &quot;certiorari&quot; petition to the Supreme Court. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, among other preservation organizations, filed briefs in support of Boerne.

===Supreme Court===
The Court, in an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, struck down RFRA as it applies to the states as an unconstitutional use of Congress&#x27;s enforcement powers. The Court held that it holds the sole power to define the substantive rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment—a definition to which Congress may not add and from which it may not subtract. Congress could not constitutionally enact RFRA because the law was not designed to have &quot;congruence and proportionality&quot; with the substantive rights that the Court had defined. Although Congress could enact &quot;remedial&quot; or &quot;preventative&quot; legislation to guarantee rights not exactly congruent with those defined by the Court, it could only do so to more effectively prevent, deter, or correct violations of those rights actually guaranteed by the Court. RFRA was seen to be disproportionate in its effects compared to its objective. Justice Kennedy wrote:
Moreover, remedial or prophylactic legislation still had to show &quot;congruence and proportionality&quot; between the end it aimed to reach (that is, the violations it aimed to correct), and the means it chose to reach those ends—that is, the penalties or prohibitions it enacted to prevent or correct those violations. Because RFRA was not reasonably remedial or preventative, it was unconstitutional.

==Implications==
===Congruence and proportionality===
&quot;Boerne&quot; is important for several reasons. One is that it introduced a completely new test for deciding whether Congress had exceeded its Section 5 powers: the &quot;congruence and proportionality&quot; test, a test that has proven to have great importance in the context of the Eleventh Amendment. Another reason was that it explicitly declared that the Court alone has the ability to state which rights are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Still another was that it had First Amendment consequences in that it spelled the end for any legislative attempts to overturn &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot;.

The &quot;congruence and proportionality&quot; requirement replaced the previous theory advanced in &quot;Katzenbach v. Morgan&quot; that the Equal Protection Clause is &quot;a positive grant of legislative power authorizing Congress to exercise its discretion in determining the need for and nature of legislation to secure Fourteenth Amendment guarantees.&quot; Before the 1997 &quot;Boerne&quot; decision, &quot;Katzenbach v. Morgan&quot; was often interpreted as allowing Congress to go beyond, but not fall short of, the Court&#x27;s interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause.
But that is not how the majority opinion in &quot;Boerne&quot; interpreted &quot;Katzenbach&quot;:

The holding of &quot;Boerne&quot; said that only the Court could interpret the Constitution, in order to maintain the &quot;traditional separation of powers between Congress and the Judiciary.&quot; Also, &quot;Boerne&quot; relied on arguments for protecting the rights that pertain to state governments based on &quot;enumerated powers.&quot; The intent of &quot;Boerne&quot; was to prevent &quot;a considerable congressional intrusion into the States&#x27; traditional prerogatives and general authority.&quot; The holding of &quot;Boerne&quot; specifically mentioned the state action doctrine of the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; as a Court interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause that limits the &quot;remedial or preventive&quot; power of Congress.

===Power of enforcement===

&quot;Boerne&quot; introduced the &quot;congruence and proportionality&quot; test for deciding whether Congress had exceeded its Section 5 powers to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. In &quot;Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank&quot; (1999) the Supreme Court explained the connection between the &quot;congruence and proportionality&quot; test and the power of Congress to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment in the following way:

In holding that RFRA could not be justified as &quot;appropriate&quot; enforcement legislation under § 5, the Court emphasized that Congress&#x27; enforcement power is &quot;remedial&quot; in nature. &quot;Id.,&quot; at 519. We recognized that &quot;[l]egislation which deters or remedies constitutional violations can fall within the sweep of Congress&#x27; enforcement power even if in the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and intrudes into &#x27;legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to the States.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Id.,&quot; at 518 (citation omitted). We also noted, however, that&quot; &#x27;[a]s broad as the congressional enforcement power is, it is not unlimited,&#x27;&quot; &quot;ibid.,&quot; and held that &quot;Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is. It has been given the power &#x27;to enforce,&#x27; not the power to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation,&quot; &quot;id.,&quot; at 519. Canvassing the history of the Fourteenth Amendment and case law examining the propriety of Congress&#x27; various voting rights measures, the Court explained:

&quot;While the line between measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and measures that make a substantive change in the governing law is not easy to discern, and Congress must have wide latitude in determining where it lies, the distinction exists and must be observed. There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end. Lacking such a connection, legislation may become substantive in operation and effect.&quot; &quot;Id.,&quot; at 519-520.

We thus held that for Congress to invoke § 5, it must identify conduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s substantive provisions, and must tailor its legislative scheme to remedying or preventing such conduct.

===Constitutionality of the RFRA===
This case has been used to claim that the federal RFRA is unconstitutional. A more precise and accurate phrasing of this claim is that Boerne held the RFRA could not be constitutionally applied to state and local governments. At the federal level, the RFRA remains operative. The constitutionality of one aspect of RFRA as applied to the federal government was confirmed on February 21, 2006, as the Supreme Court ruled against the government in &quot;Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal&quot;, , which involved the use of an otherwise illegal substance in a religious ceremony, stating that the federal government must show a compelling state interest in restricting religious conduct.

===Historic preservation===
The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;City of Boerne&quot; made a significant impact on the states&#x27; abilities to enforce laws, including those pertaining to historic preservation. Under RFRA, an otherwise neutral state law—such as zoning, or historic preservation ordinances—needed to be scrutinized if its enforcement involved a religious group or individual. Therefore, by declaring extension of RFRA to apply against state laws unconstitutional, the ability of the states to establish and maintain historic preservation ordinances was made easier. However, in 2000, Congress enacted the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, in which it used the Spending Clause to require, for localities that receive federal funding, land use laws to accommodate religious freedom, essentially, as if RFRA had been ruled applicable to state law.

<text>John LaGale Horton (April 30, 1925 – November 5, 1960) was an American country, honky tonk and rockabilly musician during the 1950s. He is best known for a series of history-inspired narrative country saga songs that became international hits. His 1959 single &quot;The Battle of New Orleans&quot; was awarded the 1960 Grammy Award for Best Country &amp; Western Recording. The song was awarded the Grammy Hall of Fame Award and in 2001 ranked No. 333 of the Recording Industry Association of America&#x27;s &quot;Songs of the Century&quot;. His first No. 1 country song was in 1959, &quot;When It&#x27;s Springtime in Alaska (It&#x27;s Forty Below)&quot;.

Horton had two successes in 1960 with both &quot;Sink the Bismarck&quot; and &quot;North to Alaska&quot;, the latter used over the opening credits to the John Wayne film of the same name. Horton died in November 1960 at the peak of his fame in a traffic collision, less than two years after his breakthrough. He is a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Horton was born on April 30, 1925, in Los Angeles, the youngest of the five children of the former Ella Claudia Robinson (1892–1966) and John Loly Horton (1889–1959), and raised in Rusk in Cherokee County in East Texas. His family often traveled between east Texas and southern California to work as migrant farm workers. After he graduated from high school in Gallatin, Texas, in 1944, Horton attended Lon Morris Junior College in Jacksonville, Texas, on a basketball scholarship. He later attended Seattle University and briefly Baylor University in Waco, although he did not graduate from any of these institutions.

Horton soon returned to California and got a job in the mail room at Selznick International Pictures, where his future wife, Donna Cook, was working in the studio as a secretary. After a short stint studying geology in Seattle in 1948, Horton went to Alaska to look for gold. During this period he began writing songs. Returning south, he entered and won a talent contest in Henderson, Texas. Encouraged by this result, he returned to California to pursue a music career.

His guest appearances on Cliffie Stone&#x27;s &quot;Hometown Jamboree&quot; on KXLA-AM and KLAC-TV in Pasadena and his own half-hour show &quot;The Singing Fisherman&quot; led to the opportunity to record some songs on the Cormac record label. By the time the company folded in 1952, Horton recorded 10 singles for that label. Fabor Robison, owner of Abbott Records, acquired the master recordings. Around that time, Horton married Donna Cook.

== &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; and early career ==
By this time Horton was appearing regularly on &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;, so he and Donna moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, where the show was recorded. He also signed a contract with Mercury Records and began recording. His first song for that label, &quot;First Train Headin&#x27; South&quot; b/w &quot;(I Wished for an Angel) The Devil Sent Me You&quot; (Mercury 6412), received good reviews. He and his new backup band, the Rowley Trio, began touring under the name The Singing Fisherman and the Rowley Trio in 1952, eventually changing the name to Johnny Horton and the Roadrunners. The group included Horton as lead singer and Jerry Rowley on fiddle as well Rowley&#x27;s wife Evelyn on piano and his sister Vera (Dido) on guitars. The constant touring was hard on Horton&#x27;s marriage, and Donna moved back to Los Angeles. They were soon divorced.

On September 26, 1953, Horton married Billie Jean Jones, widow of Hank Williams, who had died on January 1, 1953. Horton parted ways with the Rowley trio but continued to appear occasionally on &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;. His contract with Mercury expired in late 1954, with his recording of &quot;All for the Love of a Girl&quot; (Mercury 70227) being his bestseller, at 35,000 to 45,000 copies. Horton, himself always an avid fisherman, got a job in a tackle shop and put his music career on hiatus. But by the following year, his new manager and bassist Tillman Franks had obtained Horton a one-year contract with Columbia Records. They traveled to Nashville in a borrowed car for their first recording session. Influenced by the work of Elvis Presley, Horton began adopting a more rockabilly style.

== &quot;Honky-Tonk Man&quot; and later career ==
&quot;Honky-Tonk Man&quot; was recorded on January 11, 1956, at the Bradley Film &amp; Recording Studios in Nashville, one of four songs Horton recorded that day. Session musicians on the recording were Grady Martin and Harold Bradley, as well as Bill Black (at the time Presley&#x27;s bassist). Soon afterwards &quot;Honky-Tonk Man&quot; was released as a single (Columbia label: 4–21504) paired with another song from the same session, &quot;I&#x27;m Ready if You&#x27;re Willing&quot;. They went out on tour, with the band featuring Franks on bass and Tommy Tomlinson on guitar.

&quot;Honky-Tonk Man&quot; was reviewed by the March 10 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot;, which said, &quot;The wine, women and song attractions exert a powerful hold on the singer, he admits. The funky sound and pounding beat in the backing suggest the kind of atmosphere he describes. A very good jukebox record.&quot; Their review of &quot;I&#x27;m Ready if You&#x27;re Willing&quot; was also positive: &quot;Horton sings out this cheerful material with amiable personality. This ever more popular stylist ought to expand his circle of fans with this one.&quot; The song peaked at No. 9 on the C&amp;W Jockey chart (now Hot Country Songs) and at No. 14 on the Best Seller chart.

Horton returned to the studio on May 23, but the &quot;A&quot; side of his next single, &quot;I&#x27;m a One Woman Man&quot; (Columbia 21538), was one of the songs recorded back in January. The &quot;B&quot; side was &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like I Did&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; described &quot;One Woman Man&quot; as a &quot;smart and polished job,&quot; and Horton as &quot;singing with a light, airy touch. Guitar work is just as convincing, adding up to listenable, commercial stuff&quot;. He and his band toured through the United States and Canada to promote the record, which reached No. 7 on the Jockey chart and No. 9 on the Best Seller and Jukebox charts.

&quot;I&#x27;m Coming Home&quot; / &quot;I Got A Hole In My Pirogue&quot; (Columbia 40813) was released around this time as well. On February 9, &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that &quot;not only Southern markets are doing good business with this, but Northern cities report that both country and pop customers are going for this in a big way&quot;. It was again a success on the country charts (No. 11 Jockey, No. 15 Best Seller) but it failed to score the popular music charts.

Later major successes include the song &quot;The Battle of New Orleans&quot; (written by Jimmy Driftwood), which was awarded the 1960 Grammy Award for Best Country &amp; Western Recording. The song was awarded the Grammy Hall of Fame Award and in 2001 ranked No. 333 of the Recording Industry Association of America&#x27;s &quot;Songs of the Century&quot;. Horton had two other successes in 1960 with &quot;Sink the Bismarck&quot; and &quot;North to Alaska&quot; for John Wayne&#x27;s movie, &quot;North to Alaska&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Horton was married twice. His first marriage, to Donna Cook, ended with a divorce granted in Rusk, Texas.

In September 1953, he married Billie Jean Jones, the widow of country-music singer Hank Williams. Billie Jean and Horton had two daughters, Yanina (Nina) and Melody, and Horton adopted Billie Jean&#x27;s daughter Jeri Lynn.

== Death ==
On the night of November 4–5, 1960, Horton and two other band members, Tommy Tomlinson and Tillman Franks, were traveling from the Skyline Club in Austin, Texas to Shreveport when they collided with an oncoming truck on a bridge near Milano in Milam County, Texas. Horton died en route to the hospital, and Tomlinson (1930–1982) was seriously injured; his leg was later amputated. Franks (1920–2006) suffered head injuries, and James Davis, the driver of the truck, sustained a broken ankle and other minor injuries.

The funeral was held in Shreveport on November 8, 1960, officiated by Franks&#x27; younger brother William Derrel &quot;Billy&quot; Franks, a Church of God minister. Johnny Cash performed one of the readings, choosing Chapter 20 from the Gospel of John (Resurrection of Jesus).

Horton is interred at Hillcrest Memorial Park and Mausoleum in Haughton, east of Bossier City in northwestern Louisiana.

== Legacy ==
When Johnny Cash, a good friend of Horton&#x27;s, learned about the accident, he said, &quot;[I] locked myself in one of the hotel&#x27;s barrooms and cried.&quot; Cash dedicated his rendition of &quot;When It&#x27;s Springtime in Alaska (It&#x27;s Forty Below)&quot; to Horton on his album &quot;Personal File&quot;: &quot;Johnny Horton was a good old friend of mine.&quot; Over time, Horton&#x27;s material has been rereleased a number of times, through boxsets and compilations.

Horton was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and posthumously inducted into the Delta Music Museum Hall of Fame in Ferriday, Louisiana.

<text>Rarefaction is the reduction of an item&#x27;s density, the opposite of compression. Like compression, which can travel in waves (sound waves, for instance), rarefaction waves also exist in nature. A common rarefaction wave is the area of low relative pressure following a shock wave (see picture).

Rarefaction waves expand with time (much like sea waves spread out as they reach a beach); in most cases rarefaction waves keep the same overall profile (&#x27;shape&#x27;) at all times throughout the wave&#x27;s movement: it is a &quot;self-similar expansion&quot;. Each part of the wave travels at the local speed of sound, in the local medium. This expansion behaviour contrasts with that of pressure increases, which gets narrower with time until they steepen into shock waves.

==Physical examples==

A natural example of rarefaction occurs in the layers of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Because the atmosphere has mass, most atmospheric matter is nearer to the Earth due to the Earth&#x27;s gravitation. Therefore, air at higher layers of the atmosphere is less dense, or &quot;rarefied&quot;, relative to air at lower layers. Thus, rarefaction can refer either to a reduction in density over space at a single point of time, or a reduction of density over time for one particular area.

Rarefaction can be easily observed by compressing a spring and releasing it. 

==In manufacturing==

Modern construction of guitars is an example of using rarefaction in manufacturing. By forcing the reduction of density (loss of oils and other impurities) in the cellular structure of the soundboard, a rarefied guitar top produces a tonal decompression affecting the sound of the instrument, mimicking aged wood.
