<text>USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NCC-1701-D), or &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D, to distinguish it as the fifth Federation vessel with the same name, is a starship in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; media franchise. Under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, it is the main setting of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987–1994) and the film &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994). It has also been depicted in various spinoffs, films, books, and licensed products.

&quot;The Next Generation&quot; occurs in the 24th century, beginning 78 years after the adventures in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1966–1969). Andrew Probert&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D updates Matt Jefferies&#x27; iconic 1960s &quot;Enterprise&quot; design, depicting a ship supporting a larger crew on a longer mission &quot;to boldly go where no one has gone before.&quot;

==Development and production==

=== Concept ===
Paramount Television Group and &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry announced the development of a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; series in October 1986. Because the &quot;Enterprise&quot; had been &quot;just as important to [the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;] as Kirk, Spock, and McCoy,&quot; the new ship was critical.

Whereas Captain Kirk led a five-year mission, the new crew would be outfitted for a mission of at least 10 years. To sustain such a journey, the new vessel would be twice as long, eight times the volume, and include the crew&#x27;s families. Roddenberry also wanted the ship to depict an improved quality of life for its crew: it would be brighter, less militaristic, and have sleeker and more refined interfaces than the original &quot;Enterprise&quot;. He wanted the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to convey a harmony between science and quality of life.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s registry was originally &quot;NCC-1701-7&quot;. The &quot;7&quot; became a &quot;G&quot; to be consistent with the new USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, with registry NCC-1701-&quot;A&quot;, at the conclusion of &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986). A February 1987 revision to the &quot;Next Generation&quot; writers&#x27; manual specified the show&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot; as the &quot;NCC-1701-D&quot;, carrying a crew of 907 and their families; by March, the crew complement was 1,012 and specified the show occurring 78 years after the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

=== Design ===

Artists Andrew Probert, Rick Sternbach, and Michael Okuda were among the earliest &quot;Next Generation&quot; hires, and they had worked on &quot;Star Trek&quot; films. Probert, a concept artist, focused first on the bridge because that would be a frequent filming location. Roddenberry envisioned the bridge as having a forward viewscreen four times larger than in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and for there to be a conference table on the bridge. As production design continued, the table was shifted to a conference room adjacent to the bridge, and an open bridge design formed. Probert designed a transporter to be near the bridge, but Roddenberry preferred that it be further away so characters could have conversations on their way to the transporter room.

Knowing the bridge would need to match up with the exterior design, Probert pinned up a &quot;what if?&quot; painting he&#x27;d made shortly after finalizing the &quot;Enterprise&quot; redesign for 1979&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; as a referent. Unbeknownst to Probert, story editor David Gerrold took the image to a producers meeting. The producers liked the design and directed Probert to make it the basis for the new vessel. The sleeker lines and rounded contours that informed the interior design also influenced the exterior. The ship&#x27;s many windows are meant to allow the crew to be in touch with their environment.

The new &quot;Enterprise&quot; retains the hallmarks of Matt Jefferies&#x27; design for the original &quot;Enterprise&quot;: a saucer section, engineering section, and a pair of engine nacelles. Probert did this in part to assuage skeptical fans who were concerned about the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; being &quot;replaced&quot;. The design instead shifted placement and proportion: for example, the saucer section was enlarged and the warp nacelles shifted lower. Slanting the nacelle support pylons forward conveyed a sense of intense forward movement. The July 1987 issue of &quot;Starlog&quot; included the first public depictions of the ship.

Probert&#x27;s design did not originally include the ability for the saucer and engineering sections to separate, and producers rejected his initial concepts for incorporating it. Probert said his biggest design challenge was creating a ship that looked as good in two pieces as it did in one piece. He had meant to add landing gear to the saucer&#x27;s underside as he had with the film franchise &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but he got &quot;distracted&quot; and never added them.

=== Sets ===
In October 1986, producers began planning the show&#x27;s sets, including efforts to reuse props and materials from the film franchise. The films&#x27; engineering, sickbay, corridor, crew quarters, and bridge were redressed for &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. To save money in the first season, the observation lounge&#x27;s windows were covered with carpet to become the sickbay; a new lounge set was created for the second season. A multipurpose set that served as the cargo bay, shuttlecraft bay, holodeck, and gymnasium was built from scratch. While the bridge &quot;seems immense,&quot; the set had the same width as the original series bridge and was longer. A lounge set was created in unused soundstage space after the first season: producers realized their existing sets were workspaces, and they wanted an area to depict the crew at rest.

The production crew did everything possible &quot;within reason&quot; both to recreate first-season sets and to imagine futuristic upgrades for the series finale, &quot;All Good Things...&quot; (1994), which presents the ship in three different time periods. Some props and details, such as the first-season conference room starship models, had been saved and were reused for the flashback scenes. Sets for the future scenes reused props from other episodes that posit the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s appearance further in the future.

===Filming models and visual effects===
Producers were aware that audiences had grown accustomed to the cinematic quality of models and effects in the franchise&#x27;s films. They considered using only CGI models and effects, but anxiety about whether the vendor could consistently deliver high-quality work led to that idea&#x27;s rejection. The producers turned to Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), who had worked on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, for the &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; pilot.

In March 1987, an ILM team led by Greg Jein and Ease Owyeung began building filming miniatures based on Probert&#x27;s designs. They created two models for : a model and a model that separated into the saucer and engineering sections. The models were made of fiberglass and cast resin over aluminum frames, and neon lights and incandescents provided the models&#x27; interior lighting. ILM created several stock footage shots and effects, including the &quot;Enterprise&quot; jump to warp. The warp jump was featured in the show&#x27;s opening sequence, but most of the other shots were too static and &quot;didn&#x27;t pan out.&quot; New &quot;Enterprise&quot; shots were created as necessary for each episode, and effects supervisor Robert Legato had over 350 such shots in his library by the seventh season. Legato disliked filming the six-foot model: its size made it hard to shoot for long shots, and its lack of surface details—some of which were drawn with pencil—made it difficult to use in close-ups. Jein supervised construction of a miniature for the third season that was more detailed than the first two.

=== Transition to film ===

Production designer Herman Zimmerman had more freedom for &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994) than he had on previous &quot;Star Trek&quot; films. Producers wanted to ensure &quot;Generations&quot; stayed true to the television series while also taking advantage of the film production&#x27;s scope and budget. Interiors were relit and received several cosmetic changes, such as redesigned consoles, metallic accents, and replacing backlit displays with monitors. Some changes, like enhanced detailing and a redesigned bridge ceiling, were necessitated by the film cameras&#x27; higher resolution. The increased budget allowed for the creation of sophisticated new sets, such as the stellar cartography lab.

John Knoll led ILM&#x27;s visual effects for the film, including an all-CGI warp jump effect for the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. ILM rewired and updated its six-foot &quot;Enterprise&quot; model for the saucer separation sequence. ILM made a saucer section model to &quot;crash&quot; into an planet surface model. An model of the saucer&#x27;s forward edge was used for close-ups of the crashed ship.

=== Return in &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; ===
Despite resistance due to budget and time, &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; executive producer Terry Matalas insisted on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; appearing in the show&#x27;s third season (2023): he said they could not &quot;have a &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; reunion without [...] the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.&quot; There was not much construction information available for production designer Dave Blass and art director Liz Kloczkowski to recreate the bridge set, and they created a wall of set photos and screen captures for reference. Blass hired Denise and Michael Okuda, from the &quot;Next Generation&quot; production team, to assist. Construction of the bridge set took three months and involved approximately 50 people. The large wooden arch in the middle of the bridge was the most difficult part of the build, but remaking the chairs and recreating the carpet was also challenging. Changes in cameras and cinematography required a new approach to lighting the set.

==Depiction==

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; is itself a protagonist in &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. Each episode&#x27;s opening voiceover, which states that &quot;these are the voyages of the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;,&quot; frames the narrative as belonging to the ship rather than the crew. Jonathan Frakes, who played first officer William Riker, said, &quot;When we negotiate our contracts, Paramount&#x27;s company line is that the ship is in fact the star of the show!&quot;

Starfleet commissions the &quot;Galaxy&quot;-class USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; in 2363 under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard. The flagship of the United Federation of Planets, it is on a mission &quot;to boldly go where no one has gone before.&quot; The crew explores the galaxy and makes first contact with several new species, including the Q Continuum and the Borg. A pair of two-part episodes depict a shift in command—to William Riker in &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; and Edward Jellico in &quot;Chain of Command&quot;—but leadership reverts to Picard at the end of both arcs.

In 2371, as depicted in &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;, the Duras sisters attack and heavily damage the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. A warp drive coolant leak causes an explosion that destroys the stardrive section. The saucer section crash lands on the surface of Veridian III. The final two episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;&#x27;s third season (2023) reveal that the saucer section was later recovered from Veridian III, after which Geordi La Forge spent twenty years restoring the vessel as part of his role as curator of the Starfleet Museum. La Forge used parts from another &quot;Galaxy&quot;-class ship to rebuild the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The older &quot;Enterprise&quot; is the only vessel not tied to Starfleet&#x27;s Borg-compromised mainframe, and Picard and his crew use the ship to defeat the Borg threatening Earth. The series finale shows the &quot;Enterprise&quot; has become part of the Starfleet Museum. An alternate universe version of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D appears in the &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; episode &quot;Fully Dilated&quot;.

== Critical reaction ==
&quot;io9&quot; ranked the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D as the fifth best version of the franchise&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot;s, with &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; calling it the third best and SyFy ranking it the second best. Space.com said the &quot;Enterprise&quot; brief appearance is the highlight of the opening scene of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; first episode (2020). &quot;Vulture&quot; described the &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s return in &quot;Picard&quot;&#x27;s third season as &quot;perfect&quot;, and &quot;Collider&quot; compared the crew&#x27;s reunion on the bridge set to &quot;a fever dream.&quot;

== Cultural impact ==
In October 2006, the six-foot &quot;Enterprise&quot; model was auctioned at Christie&#x27;s, along with other models, props, costumes, and set pieces from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Its projected value was $25,000 to $35,000, but the final sale price was $576,000—the most expensive item in the auction.

The computer voice and conversational system on board the Starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; in science fiction TV series and movies, beginning with &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, inspired the Alexa virtual assistant.

<text>The MacRobertson Trophy Air Race (also known as the London to Melbourne Air Race) took place in October 1934 as part of the Melbourne Centenary celebrations. The race was devised by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, Sir Harold Gengoult Smith, and the prize money of £15,000 was provided by Sir Macpherson Robertson, a wealthy Australian confectionery manufacturer, on the conditions that the race be named after his MacRobertson confectionery company, and that it was organised to be as safe as possible. A further condition was that a gold medal be awarded to each pilot who completed the course within 16 days.

== Organisation and rules ==
The race was organised by an Air Race Committee, with representatives from the Australian government, aviation, and Melbourne Centenary authorities. The Royal Aero Club oversaw the event. The race ran from RAF Mildenhall in East Anglia to Flemington Racecourse, Melbourne, approximately . There were five compulsory stops, at Baghdad, Allahabad, Singapore, Darwin, and Charleville, Queensland; otherwise the competitors could choose their own routes. A further 22 optional stops were provided with stocks of fuel and oil provided by Shell and Stanavo. The Royal Aero Club put some effort into persuading the countries along the route to improve the facilities at the stopping points.
The basic rules were: no limit to the size of aircraft or power, no limit to crew size, and no pilot to join the aircraft after it had left England. Aircraft had to carry three days&#x27; rations per crew member, floats (e.g. buoyancy aids or personal flotation devices), smoke signals, and efficient instruments. There were prizes for the outright fastest aircraft (£10,000 and a trophy, £1,500 and £500) and for the best performance on a handicap formula (£2000 and £1000) by any aircraft finishing within 16 days.

The start was set at dawn (6:30) on 20 October 1934. By then, the initial field of over 60 had been reduced to 20, including three purpose-built de Havilland DH.88 Comet racers, two of the new generation of American all-metal airliners, and a mixture of earlier racers, light transports, and old bombers.

First off the line, watched by a crowd of 60,000, were Jim Mollison and his wife Amy Johnson in the Comet &quot;Black Magic&quot;, and they were early leaders in the race until forced to retire at Allahabad with engine trouble. This left the DH.88 &quot;Grosvenor House&quot; flown by Flight lieutenant C. W. A. Scott and Captain Tom Campbell Black well ahead of the rest of field, and they went on to win in a time of less than three days, despite flying the last stage with one engine throttled back because of an oil-pressure indicator giving a faulty low reading. They would have also won the handicap prize, but the race rules stipulated that no aircraft could win more than one prize. For their efforts the Royal Aeronautical Society awarded them the silver medal for Aeronautics.

Significantly, both second and third quickest times were taken by airliners, the KLM Douglas DC-2 PH-AJU &quot;Uiver&quot; (&quot;Stork&quot;) and Roscoe Turner&#x27;s Boeing 247D. Both completed the course in less than a day more than the winner; KLM&#x27;s DC-2 was even flying a regular route with passengers.


During the race, the &quot;Uiver&quot;, low on fuel after the crew had become lost when caught in severe thunderstorms, ended up over Albury, New South Wales. Lyle Ferris, the chief electrical engineer of the post office, went to the power station and signalled &quot;A-L-B-U-R-Y&quot; to the aircraft in Morse code by turning the town street lights on and off. Arthur Newnham, the announcer on radio station 2CO Corowa appealed for cars to line up on the racecourse to light up a makeshift runway.

The &quot;Uiver&quot; landed successfully, and next morning was pulled out of the mud by locals to fly on to Melbourne and win the handicap section of the race, coming second overall. In gratitude KLM made a large donation to Albury District Hospital and Alf Waugh, the Mayor of Albury, was awarded an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau.

Later that year the DC-2, on a flight from The Netherlands to Batavia, crashed in the Syrian desert near Rutbah Wells in western Iraq, killing all seven on board; it is commemorated by a flying replica.

Comet G-ACSR promptly flew film of the race back to Britain setting a round trip record of 13 days 6 hr 43 min.

The race was the basis for a 1991 Australian television miniseries &quot;The Great Air Race&quot;.

<doc id="606052" wikidata="Q7488874" url="?curid=606052" title="Shannon Free Zone">
<text>The Shannon Free Zone is a , international business park adjacent to Shannon Airport, County Clare, in Ireland. It is 18 km from Ennis and 20 km from Limerick. It was established in 1959, as the world&#x27;s first &quot;modern&quot; free-trade zone. Businesses based on the site enjoyed special tax incentives on staff and profits until 2003, which attracted a large number of multinational companies to the area.

==History==
In the late 1950s, Shannon Airport was dependent on transit passengers and refuelling for trans-Atlantic flights. With indicators that commercial aircraft would soon have the range to bypass the airport, the airport&#x27;s then director, Brendan O&#x27;Regan, submitted a proposal for a special manufacturing and tax incentive zone to be created in the vicinity of the airport. This would create employment and promote Shannon Airport as a destination for air traffic in itself. The site adjacent to the airport was established in 1959, with a second zone, Smithstown, following a number of years later. 

The Shannon Free Zone was intended to attract investment in exchange for tax incentives and tariff reductions. It succeeded in attracting foreign investment. While many of these incentives have since ceased, as of 2019, there were reportedly more than 100 international firms employing more than 8,000 people based at the Shannon Free Zone. Companies who have invested at Shannon have included Element Six (formerly DeBeers Industrial Diamonds), GECAS, GE Sensing, Intel, Lufthansa Technik, Zimmer and UCB.

Until 2014, the Shannon Free Zone was managed by Shannon Development, an Irish government agency. As of 2020, it is managed by Shannon Commercial Properties, a commercial semi-state company and part of Shannon Group plc.

Shannon Free Trade Zone has been an example that influenced China&#x27;s Special Economic Zones, and it has been visited by Chinese leaders including Jiang Zemin (in 1980) and later Wen Jiabao and Xi Jinping.

<doc id="606059" wikidata="Q713765" url="?curid=606059" title="Rubin Goldmark">
<text>Rubin Goldmark (August 15, 1872 – March 6, 1936) was an American composer, pianist, and educator. Although in his time he was an often-performed American nationalist composer, his works are seldom played now. Today he is best known as the teacher of other important composers, including Aaron Copland and George Gershwin.

==Early life==

Rubin Goldmark was born in New York City in 1872, a nephew of composer Karl Goldmark, and of Jewish heritage. Goldmark completed his undergraduate studies at City College in New York. After completing his studies in the United States in 1889, Goldmark traveled to Austria, where he studied at the Vienna Conservatory until 1891. There he studied piano and composition, the former with Alfred von Livonius, the latter with Johann Nepomuk Fuchs.

==Return to the United States==
After the conclusion of his studies in Vienna, Goldmark returned to United States. From 1891 to 1893 he taught piano and music theory at the National Conservatory in New York City. While in New York, Goldmark also studied composition with Antonín Dvořák and piano with Rafael Joseffy. Goldmark moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado, hoping to improve his poor health, and was the director of the Colorado Conservatory of Music from 1895 to 1901.
Upon Goldmark&#x27;s return to New York in 1902, he focused much of his energy on teaching. Over the 30-year period that Goldmark remained in New York he gave over five hundred lectures on music, music theory, and composition, while continuing to compose. While Goldmark&#x27;s music lies out of the standard repertoire of the twentieth century, he was highly regarded by his contemporaries. He was also the founder and frequent speaker at The Bohemians, a New York musicians&#x27; club.

==Teaching career==
While Goldmark began his career as a composer and pianist, he is best known for his work as a teacher. When not lecturing, or composing, however, Goldmark taught several private students. Famously, Goldmark taught a fifteen-year-old Aaron Copland and the young George Gershwin. Though Copland was often critical of Goldmark because he found him &quot;too pedantic and academic&quot;, Goldmark gave Copland a strong foundation which Copland would rely upon for the rest of his career (Howard, 252).

The young George Gershwin also turned to Goldmark during the composition of his piano Concerto in F. While his &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; had been orchestrated by Ferde Grofé, he wished to orchestrate his piano concerto himself, and sought Goldmark&#x27;s advice (Howard, 249). Goldmark&#x27;s influence as a teacher extended beyond just Gershwin and Copland. In 1924, Goldmark became the Head of Composition at the recently opened Juilliard School of Music in New York City.

Other notable students include composers Fannie Charles Dillon, Sammy Timberg, Vittorio Giannini, Frederick Jacobi and Alexei Haieff.

==Musical works==
Though seldom performed today, Goldmark&#x27;s music was performed regularly during his lifetime. In fact, his &quot;Negro Rhapsody&quot; was among the most performed pieces in the seven years following World War I. In 1910, he was also awarded the 1909 Paderewski Prize for Chamber Music. His other important works include &quot;Hiawatha&quot;, &quot;The Call of the Plains&quot;, and his &quot;Requiem&quot;. Goldmark&#x27;s nationalism is clearly evident from many of the titles of his works – even the ambiguously titled &quot;Requiem&quot; (perf. 1919) was inspired by Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address. Goldmark&#x27;s other compositions include a string quartet, a piano trio, a violin sonata, several orchestral pieces, piano music, and songs.

<text>XYZ were a short-lived English rock supergroup. The name XYZ is taken from &quot;eX-Yes-Zeppelin&quot; as the group consisted of ex-Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, along with ex-Yes members Chris Squire (bass guitar, vocals, keyboards) and Alan White (drums).

== History ==
The band came together after Squire met Page by chance at a party shortly before Christmas 1980. The group also featured former Greenslade keyboard player and vocalist Dave Lawson. Squire was the main writer for the group. Page believed the band needed a strong vocalist and sought out former Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant. Plant attended a rehearsal on 28 February 1981, but decided not to join the group, citing his dislike for the complexity of the music, and because he was still deeply hurt by the recent death of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s drummer and his long-time friend, John Bonham.

Without a firm commitment from Plant and contractual issues on who should manage the group (Peter Grant or Brian Lane), the band&#x27;s future was in limbo. Squire and White recorded a Christmas single, &quot;Run with the Fox&quot;, in October 1981 before forming Cinema with guitarist Trevor Rabin and keyboardist Tony Kaye. Rabin initially attempted to rework the XYZ material along with his solo songs for the new group. Cinema went on to become a reformation of Yes with the addition of singer Jon Anderson, and the album &quot;90125&quot; was recorded in 1983. It is unclear what of the XYZ material made it to &quot;90125&quot;, but White said in a 2008 interview that &quot;those were the beginning of some songs that ended up on the next Yes album anyway.&quot; White also confirmed the XYZ material was used on &quot;90125&quot; album in a 2012 interview.

In 1984, Jimmy Page joined Yes, including Squire and White, on stage, playing &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot; during a concert in their &quot;9012Live&quot; tour at Westfalenhalle in Dortmund, Germany.

Page has not dismissed the possibility of releasing the XYZ material. Squire supported the idea, but said Page had not discussed the matter with him. Squire died in 2015 and very little has been heard about releasing material, except some speculation in 2020. White also died in 2022, leaving only Page and Lawson as surviving members.

== Demoed material ==
A four-song demo tape of XYZ consisting of two instrumentals and two songs, &quot;Can You See&quot; and &quot;Telephone Secrets&quot; (featuring vocals from Squire), exists and can be found on ROIO trading sites.

*Instrumental: part of one instrumental was reworked and became part of &quot;Mind Drive&quot; on the 1997 Yes album &quot;Keys to Ascension 2&quot; (credited as a band composition).
*Instrumental: part of the other instrumental was used as the intro to The Firm&#x27;s &quot;Fortune Hunter&quot;. About &quot;Fortune Hunter&quot;, Squire explained, &quot;One of the tracks ended up being called &quot;Fortune Hunter&quot; [...] that was a riff that Jimmy brought into the mix anyway. Part of our song &quot;Mind Drive&quot; was also from those sessions as well. [...] Most of the songs were mine. I&#x27;m the only vocalist on it.&quot;
*&quot;Can You See&quot; would resurface as &quot;Can You Imagine&quot; on Yes&#x27; 2001 album &quot;Magnification&quot;.
*&quot;Telephone Secrets&quot; had been rehearsed by Yes in 1980, when they were a trio before working on the &quot;Drama&quot; album. The 2004 CD reissue of &quot;Drama&quot; features among its bonus tracks an instrumental take entitled &quot;Song No. 4 (Satellite)&quot;.

<doc id="606078" wikidata="Q323485" url="?curid=606078" title="Jim Cantalupo">
<text>James Richard Cantalupo (November 14, 1943 – April 19, 2004) was an American businessman. He served as chairman and chief executive officer of McDonald&#x27;s Corporation from 2003 until his sudden death by heart attack at the age of 60.

==Life==

Cantalupo was born in Oak Park, Illinois, the eldest child in a family of Irish and Italian descent. His father was an optometrist and mother a homemaker. Cantalupo earned a degree in accounting from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity.

He married, and had a daughter and son.

==Career==
He became a certified public accountant and worked for Arthur Young for eight years, where McDonald&#x27;s was a client. He was offered the job of controller with a substantial salary increase with the then fast growing McDonald&#x27;s before taking a month to decide, finally joining in 1974. In the same year he was promoted to vice president and senior vice president in 1981. He became president of McDonald&#x27;s International in 1987 and its CEO in 1991. He lost the top job to Jack Greenberg in 1999. McDonald&#x27;s announced his retirement plans in April 2001, but on December 1 Greenberg resigned and Cantalupo agreed to stay on for another year to help with the management transition.

Cantalupo succeeded as CEO and chairman on January 1, 2003. Shareholders were not impressed, thinking that his appointment indicated that the company was &quot;inbred&quot;. However, credit was given to Cantalupo for the company&#x27;s recovery in the succeeding 12 months: &quot;he devised a plan&quot; which included &quot;accelerating the introduction of healthier foods, such as salads&quot;.

Cantalupo previously served on the board of directors of Sears, Roebuck and Company. He was attending a McDonald&#x27;s convention in Orlando, Florida when he was stricken with a heart attack and later died. McDonald&#x27;s Japan CEO Den Fujita died of heart failure two days later.

<doc id="606093" wikidata="Q154204" url="?curid=606093" title="Al-Baqi Cemetery">
<text>Jannat al-Baqī (, &quot;The Baqi&#x27;&quot;, ) is the oldest and first Islamic cemetery of Medina located in the Hejazi region of present-day Saudi Arabia. It is also known as Baqi al-Gharqad (, meaning &quot;Baqiʿ of the Boxthorn&quot;).

Al-Baqi is reportedly founded by Prophet Muhammad and serves as the burial place for many of his relatives and companions, establishing it as one of the two holiest cemeteries in Islamic tradition. Monuments and mosques built on or near al-Baqīʿ were demolished under the Emirate of Diriyah in 1806. After their reconstruction, they were again demolished in 1926 under the Sultanate of Nejd, in accordance with their Wahhabi interpretation of Islamic law regarding idolatry. These demolitions were condemned across the Islamic world, but the Saudi government has rejected calls for reconstruction.

==History==

When Muhammad arrived in Medina from Mecca in September 622 CE, al-Baqi&#x27; was a land covered with boxthorn. According to historical records, after Muhammad’s arrival, the houses of Medina developed near al-Baqi&#x27;, which was therefore considered the public tomb. The bramble growth was cleared, and the place was consecrated to be the future cemetery of the Muslims who died in al-Madina. Additionally, al-Baqi’ was introduced as a location with Nakhl on its east side and houses on its west side. In fact, before its demolition, al-Baqi’ was situated behind the houses in the city.

During the construction of the Prophet’s Mosque on the site he purchased from two orphan children after his migration from Mecca to Medina, As&#x27;ad ibn Zurarah, one of Muhammad&#x27;s companions, died. Muhammad chose the spot to be a cemetery, and As&#x27;ad was the first individual to be buried in al-Baqi&#x27; among the Ansar.

While Muhammad was outside Medina for the Battle of Badr, his daughter Ruqayyah fell ill and died in 624. She was buried in al-Baqi&#x27;. Ruqayyah was the first person from the Ahl al-Bayt (Household of Muhammad) to be buried in this cemetery.

Shortly after Muhammad arrived from Badr, Uthman bin Maz&#x27;oon died in 3 AH (624/625 CE) and was buried in al-Baqi&#x27;. He was considered the first companion of Muhammad from the Muhajirun to be buried in the cemetery. Muhammad also referred to him as the first ‘among us to go to the hereafter,’ and he named the place where Uthman bin Maz’oon is buried as Rawhā.

When his youngest son Ibrahim died, Muhammad commanded that he be buried there as well. He watered the grave and called this place Zawrā. Following his instructions, two of his daughters Zainab and Umm Kulthum, were also buried near the grave of Uthman bin Maz&#x27;oon.

Initially, the third caliph, Uthman, was buried in the large neighbouring Jewish graveyard. The first expansion of al-Baqi&#x27; was carried out by Muawiyah I, the first Umayyad caliph. To honor Uthman, Muawiyah incorporated the extensive Jewish cemetery into al-Baqi’s burial grounds. The Umayyad Caliphate constructed the first dome over Uthman’s grave in al-Baqi’. Over time, numerous domes and structures were built or reconstructed over various graves in al-Baqi’.

===Demolition===
==== First demolition ====
The cemetery was demolished by forces loyal to the Wahhabi-Saudi alliance in 1806 and 1925 (or 1926).

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, during the Wahhabi control over Mecca and Medina in 1806, many religious buildings, including tombs and mosques, were demolished. This demolition occurred both inside and outside al-Baqi, in accordance with the Wahhabi interpretation of Islamic doctrine that forbids idolatry. These structures were razed to the ground due to Wahhabi claims of grave worship.

==== Second demolition====
The House of Saud regained control of the Hijaz in 1924 or 1925. The following year, King Ibn Saud granted permission to destroy the site, with religious authorization provided by Qadi Abd Allah ibn Bulayhid. The demolition began on April 21, 1926 (or 1925) by the &quot;Ikhwan&quot; (&quot;The Brothers&quot;), a Wahabbi religious militia. The demolition included destroying &quot;even the simplest of the gravestones.&quot;. The British convert Eldon Rutter compared the demolition to an earthquake: &quot;All over the cemetery, nothing was to be seen but little indefinite mounds of earth and stones, pieces of timber, iron bars, blocks of stone, and a broken rubble of cement and bricks, strewn about.&quot;

The second demolition was discussed in the &quot;Majles-e Shora-ye Melli&quot; (the National Consultative Assembly of Iran), and a group of representatives was sent to Hijaz to investigate. In recent years (1982), efforts have been made by Iranian religious scholars and political figures to restore the cemetery and its shrines. Both Sunni and Shia communities protested the destruction, and rallies are held annually. The day is regarded as &quot;Yaum-e Gham&quot; (&quot;Day of Sorrow&quot;). Prominent Sunni theologians and intellectuals have condemned the &quot;unfit&quot; situation of the Baqi cemetery. However, the Saudi authorities have ignored all criticism and rejected any requests for the restoration of the tombs and mausoleums.

<doc id="606101" wikidata="Q192188" url="?curid=606101" title="Chagos Archipelago">
<text>The Chagos Archipelago () or Chagos Islands (formerly the Bassas de Chagas, and later the Oil Islands) is a group of seven atolls comprising more than 60 islands in the Indian Ocean about 500 kilometres (310 mi) south of the Maldives archipelago. This chain of islands is the southernmost archipelago of the Chagos–Laccadive Ridge, a long submarine mountain range in the Indian Ocean. In its north are the Salomon Islands, Nelsons Island and Peros Banhos; towards its south-west are the Three Brothers, Eagle Islands, Egmont Islands and Danger Island; southeast of these is Diego Garcia, by far the largest island. All are low-lying atolls, save for a few extremely small instances, set around lagoons.

The Chagos Islands had been home to the Chagossians, a Bourbonnais Creole-speaking people, until the United Kingdom expelled them from the archipelago at the request of the United States between 1967 and 1973 to allow the United States to build Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia, a military base on Diego Garcia, on land leased from the UK military in the British Indian Ocean Territories. Since 1971, only the atoll of Diego Garcia has been inhabited, and only by employees of the US military, including American civilian contracted personnel. Since being expelled, Chagossians, like all others not permitted by the UK or US governments, have been prevented from entering the islands.

From 1715 to 1810, the Chagos Islands were part of France&#x27;s Indian Ocean possessions, administered through Isle de France - which was a colony of France (later renamed as Mauritius). Under the Treaty of Paris (1814), France ceded Isle de France and the Chagos Islands to the United Kingdom. 

In 1965, the United Kingdom split the Chagos Archipelago away from Mauritius, and the islands of Aldabra, Farquhar, and Desroches from the Seychelles, to form the British Indian Ocean Territory. The islands were formally established as an overseas territory of the United Kingdom on 8 November 1965. During UK-US discussions on the Indian Ocean in November 1975, the United Kingdom expressed its intention to return the islands of Aldabra, Farquhar, and Desroches to Seychelles to facilitate its peaceful transition to independence by June 1976. Both the UK and the United States acknowledged that these islands could not be used for defense purposes, as they were populated, and forcibly removing inhabitants, as had occurred in the Chagos Archipelago, would be politically unfeasible. On 18 March 1976, the UK and Seychelles signed an agreement to transfer the islands, which officially returned to Seychelles on its Independence Day, 29 June 1976. The British Indian Ocean Territory now comprises of the Chagos Archipelago only.

Between 1967 and 1973, the entire population of the Chagos Archipelago was either prevented from returning or forcibly removed by the United Kingdom. The main forcible removal of Diego Garcia’s population took place in July and September 1971. Mauritius has since been engaged in a sovereignty dispute with the UK, claiming the Chagos Archipelago as part of Mauritius.

In 2004, the UK amended its exclusion clause to block Mauritius from taking the Chagos dispute to the International Court of Justice. This move ensured that even if Mauritius left the Commonwealth, it could not challenge the UK in court.

On 18 March 2015, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that the UK&#x27;s marine protected area around the Chagos Archipelago violated international law. The tribunal upheld Mauritius&#x27; sovereignty claims, rejecting the UK&#x27;s argument and affirming its binding commitments on fishing and mineral rights.

On 23 June 2017, the UN General Assembly voted to refer the Chagos dispute to the International Court of Justice, which began hearings in 2018. While 17 countries backed Mauritius, the UK insisted the issue should be resolved through bilateral talks. In 2019, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a non-binding advisory opinion stating that the UK &quot;has an obligation to bring to an end its administration of the Chagos Archipelago as rapidly as possible, and that all Member States must co-operate with the United Nations to complete the decolonization of Mauritius&quot;. 

In 2021, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea confirmed for its jurisdiction, in a binding ruling, that the UK has &quot;no sovereignty over the Chagos Islands&quot;, and thus the islands should be handed back to Mauritius.

In August 2021, the Universal Postal Union banned BIOT stamps from being used in the BIOT, a move Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth called a &quot;big step in favour of the recognition of the sovereignty of Mauritius over the Chagos&quot;. 

In October 2024, the British government announced it would hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius subject to finalisation of a treaty. The Chagossian people living in the UK have criticised the deal for not having included the Chagossian community in the decision-making process. A segment of the Chagossian community, particularly those with British citizenship residing in the UK, favor continued British sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, expressing concerns that their interests may not be fully safeguarded under Mauritian administration. However, many Chagossians, including those in Mauritius, support Mauritian sovereignty. The Chagos Refugees Group, the largest Chagossian advocacy organization, has been a leading voice for this position. Its leader, Olivier Bancoult, described the UK&#x27;s decision to return the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius and allow Chagossians to resettle on the outer islands as a significant step and an acknowledgment of past injustices. The deal was put on hold following the 2024 United States presidential election to allow consideration from the new incoming administration. On 27 February 2025, speaking in the Oval Office alongside Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that he was willing to support the agreement to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.

==Geography==
The archipelago is about south of the Maldives, east of the Seychelles, north-east of Rodrigues Island (Mauritius), west of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and north of Amsterdam Island.

The land area of the islands is , the largest island, Diego Garcia, having an area of . The total area, including lagoons within atolls, is more than , of which are accounted by the Great Chagos Bank, the largest acknowledged atoll structure of the world (the completely submerged Saya de Malha Bank is larger, but its status as an atoll is uncertain). The shelf area is , and the Exclusive Economic Zone, which borders the corresponding zone of the Maldives in the north, has an area of (including territorial waters).

The Chagos group is a combination of different coralline rock structures topping a submarine ridge running southwards across the centre of the Indian Ocean, formed by volcanoes above the Réunion hotspot. Unlike the Maldives, there is no clearly discernible pattern in the atoll arrangement, which makes the whole archipelago look somewhat chaotic. Most of the coralline structures of the Chagos are submerged reefs.

The Chagos contain the world&#x27;s largest coral atoll, The Great Chagos Bank, which supports half the total area of good quality reefs in the Indian Ocean. As a result, the ecosystems of the Chagos have so far proven resilient to climate change and environmental disruptions.

The largest individual islands are Diego Garcia (), Eagle (Great Chagos Bank, ), Île Pierre (Peros Banhos, ), Eastern Egmont (Egmont Islands, ), Île du Coin (Peros Banhos, ) and Île Boddam (Salomon Islands, ).

In addition to the seven atolls with dry land reaching at least the high-water mark, there are nine reefs and banks, most of which can be considered permanently submerged atoll structures. The number of atolls in the Chagos Archipelago is given as four or five in most sources, plus two island groups and two single islands, mainly because it is not recognised that the Great Chagos Bank is a huge atoll structure (including those two island groups and two single islands), and because Blenheim Reef, which has islets or cays above or just reaching the high-water mark, is not included. Features are listed in the table from north to south:

===Resources===
The main natural resources of the area are coconuts and fish. The licensing of commercial fishing used to provide an annual income of about US$2 million for the British Indian Ocean Territory authorities. However, licenses have not been given since October 2010; the last expired after the creation of the no-take marine reserve.

All economic activity is concentrated on the largest island of Diego Garcia, where joint UK–US military facilities are located. Construction projects and various services needed to support the military installations are done by military and contract employees from the UK, Mauritius, the Philippines, and the US. There are currently no industrial or agricultural activities on the islands. All the water, food and other essentials of daily life are shipped to the island. An independent feasibility study led to the conclusion that resettlement would be &quot;costly and precarious&quot;. Another feasibility study, commissioned by organisations supporting resettlement, found that resettlement would be possible at a cost to the British taxpayer of £25 million. If the Chagossians return, they plan to re-establish copra production and fishing, and to begin the commercial development of the islands for tourism.

Until October 2010, Skipjack (&quot;Euthynnus pelamis&quot;) and yellowfin tuna (&quot;Thunnus albacares&quot;) were fished for about two months of the year as their year-long migratory route takes them through Chagos waters. While the remoteness of the Chagos offers some protection from extractive activities, legal and illegal fishing have had an impact. There is considerable poaching of turtles and other marine life. Sharks, which play a vital role in balancing the food web of tropical reefs, have suffered sharp declines from illegal fishing for their fins and as bycatch in legal fisheries. Sea cucumbers, which cleanse sand, are poached to feed Asian markets.

===Climate===
The Chagos Archipelago has a tropical oceanic climate; hot and humid but moderated by trade winds.
Climate is characterised by plenty of sunshine, warm temperatures, showers and light breezes.
December through February is considered the rainy season (summer monsoon); typical weather conditions include light west-northwesterly winds and warmer temperatures with more rainfall. June to September is considered the drier season (winter), characterised by moderate south-easterly winds, slightly cooler temperatures and less rainfall. The annual mean rainfall is 2 600 mm (100 inches), varying from 105 mm (4 inches) during August to 350 mm (14 inches) during January.

==History==
===Early history===
According to Southern Maldivian oral tradition, local traders and fishermen were occasionally lost at sea and became stranded in one of the islands of the Chagos. Eventually they were rescued and brought back home. However, these islands were judged to be too far away from the Maldives to be settled permanently by Maldivians. Thus, for many centuries, the Chagos were ignored by their northern neighbours. However, these tales contrast with the historical view that the Maldives has towards the Chagos, as they were considered to be an extension of Maldivian maritime territory. Additionally, the exiled Maldive King Hassan IX (also known as Dom Manoel), while in Cochin, describes himself in his letters patent of 1561 as King of the Maldive islands, including seven of the islands of Pullobay, referring to &quot;Fōlhavahi&quot; or the Chagos, and this letter survives in a Portuguese archive in Lisbon.

In Maldivian lore the whole group is known as &quot;Fōlhavahi&quot; or &quot;Hollhavai&quot; () (the latter name in the Southern Maldives Adduan dialect of Dhivehi). There are no separate names for the different atolls of the Chagos in the Maldivian oral tradition; &quot;Fayhandheeb&quot; is used for the Archipelago as a whole. According to Maldivian history, the Maldives Archipelago consists of Mahaldheeb, Suvaadheebu and Feyhandheeb.

===16th to 19th century===

The first Europeans to become aware of the archipelago were Portuguese explorers. Although the Portuguese navigator Pedro de Mascarenhas (1470 – 23 June 1555) is credited with having encountered the islands during his voyage of 1512–13, there is little corroborative evidence; cartographic analysis points to 1532 or later. Portuguese seafarers named the group Bassas de Chagas, (wounds) referring to the Holy Wounds of the crucifixion of Jesus. They also named some of the atolls, such as Diego Garcia and Peros Banhos Atoll, mentioned as &quot;Pedro dos Banhos&quot; in 1513 by Afonso de Albuquerque. This lonely and isolated group, economically and politically uninteresting to the Portuguese, was never made part of the Portuguese Empire.

The earliest and most interesting description of the Chagos, before coconut trees grew widely on the islands, was written by Manoel Rangel, a castaway from the Portuguese ship &quot;Conceição&quot; which ran aground on the Peros Banhos reefs in 1556.

The oldest known written document claiming the Chagos is attributed to King Hassan IX of the Maldives in the year 1561. The French were the first European colonial power to lay claim to the Chagos after they settled Île Bourbon (now Réunion, in 1665) and Isle de France (now Mauritius, in 1715). The French began issuing permits for companies to establish coconut oil plantations on the Chagos in the 1770s. 

On 27 April 1786 the Chagos Islands and Diego Garcia were claimed for Great Britain. However, the territory was ceded to Britain by treaty only after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, in 1815. The Chagos were governed from Mauritius, which was by that time also a British colony.

In 1793, when the first successful colony was founded on Diego Garcia, the largest island, coconut plantations were established on many of the atolls and isolated islands of the archipelago. The workers were enslaved by the British and not freed until 1840, after which time many of the workers descended from those who had earlier been enslaved. They formed an inter-island culture called &quot;Ilois&quot;, a French Creole word meaning &quot;Islanders&quot;.

Commander Robert Moresby made a survey of the Chagos on behalf of the British Admiralty in 1837–38. After Moresby had taken measurements of most of the atolls and reefs, the archipelago was charted with relative precision for the first time.

Moresby&#x27;s survey of the Atolls of the Maldives was followed by the Chagos Archipelago.(1854) 

Robert Moresby (1794–1854) was a captain of the East India Company&#x27;s Bombay Marine/Indian Navy who distinguished himself as a hydrographer, maritime surveyor and draughtsman. Moresby is best known for conducting the first modern survey of the Red Sea (1829–32).  

After the completion of the Red Sea Survey, Robert Moresby was sent to chart various coral island groups lying across the track of India-to-Cape trade. In 1834–36 Moresby, assisted by Lieutenants Christopher and Young, undertook the difficult cartography of the Maldive Islands, drawing the first accurate maritime charts of this complicated Indian Ocean atoll group (Admiralty Charts). These charts were printed as three separate large maps by the Hydrographic Service of the Royal Navy.

Moresby&#x27;s survey of the Atolls of the Maldives was followed by the Chagos Archipelago. where he conducted &quot;a thorough scientific survey&quot;. He planted 30 breadfruit trees in Diego Garcia Island, the largest of the group. Moresby reported that &quot;there were cats and chickens on the island&quot;. Some of his observations were used by Darwin in his 1842 book &quot;The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs.&quot;

Moresby&#x27;s charts were so good that they were favored by Maldivian pilots navigating through the treacherous waters of their atolls until the 1990s, when satellite images appeared. In the Maldives a channel locally also known as Hanikandu, between Northern Maalhosmadulhu Atoll and &quot;Fasdhūtere&quot; Atoll, is still known as &#x27;Moresby Channel&#x27;.

The British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included Maldives as a protected state.  By the 1800s, the European Oriental Trade had expanded vastly, and since the Maldives straddles the trade routes from Europe and Africa to the East, surveying and charting the Maldivian seas became a most urgent international need. Therefore, when the British Admiralty survey of the Red Sea was completed in 1834, Commander Moresby was dispatched to the Maldives. 

Moresby came to the Maldives in 1835 with special letters to the Radhun from the Governments of Bombay and Ceylon. The purpose of Commander Moresby&#x27;s visit was to survey and chart the Maldivian seas for the British Admiralty.  However, the Radhun viewed Moresby&#x27;s visit with suspicion.  Moresby was bearing a letter from the British government to the Radhun. The letter stated that the survey and charting the reefs, sand banks and the depths of the local seas would facilitate the movements of vessels calling at Male&#x27;, and thereby increase and broaden the local overseas trade. However, when considered in a different perspective there were innumerable issues which could arise because of the British intentions. The reefs and the shallows of the Maldives was her first line of defense. The strategic importance of the topography of the Maldivian reefs, shallows, islands and the atolls of the country has been a closely guarded secret of the Maldivian militia for centuries.

Therefore, if the Maldivian territory was to be charted by the British, this first line of the Maldivian defense system would become obsolete. Mueenuhdeen Radhun&#x27;s defense system would have been made vulnerable. The Radhun worked to prevent Moresby from his survey work, as it represented a threat to the Radhun&#x27;s throne. Furthermore, Moresby&#x27;s inspection of the bastions of Male gave further threat to the Radhun, making the Radhun suspicious of the British intentions. The Radhun not only refused to cooperate with Commander Moresby, but also created all sorts of passive obstructions and Moresby left the Maldives with his intentions unfulfilled.

Ultimately, the situation caused a significant internal political struggle between the Radhun and his rivals, but Moresby was able to complete the first modern survey of the region.

Unauthorized Survey Sparks Tension

One of the most significant incidents occurred in 1834 when Captain Moresby, commissioned by the British East India Company, conducted a survey of the Maldivian archipelago without explicit permission from the local authorities. This unauthorized action, viewed with suspicion and fear by the Maldivian people, highlighted the growing British interest in the region.

The Role of Pro-British Figures

To further their colonial ambitions, the British often supported pro-British figures like Ahmad Dídí, who held considerable influence over Maldivian politics. By backing such individuals, the British were able to indirectly shape the country&#x27;s policies and decisions.

Exploiting Legal Loopholes

The absence of a formal legal framework and defined borders in the Maldives provided an opportunity for the British to redraw the map of the archipelago to suit their strategic interests. One notable example is the exclusion of the Chagos Archipelago from the Maldivian territory, a decision that continues to have geopolitical implications. 

The Enduring Impact

The British colonial legacy, including the imposed map and borders, has had long-lasting consequences for the Maldives. The country continues to grapple with the challenges of asserting its sovereignty and territorial rights, particularly in the context of maritime disputes and resource management.

===20th century===
On 31 August 1903 the Chagos Archipelago was administratively separated from the Seychelles and attached to Mauritius.

Before granting independence to Mauritius, the United Kingdom paid £3 million in compensation to the Mauritius Government and made several undertakings regarding the future status of the Chagos Archipelago. These included a commitment that the archipelago would be returned to Mauritius if it was no longer needed for defence purposes, assurances that Mauritius would retain access to navigational and meteorological facilities as well as fishing rights, and an agreement that any benefits from minerals or oil discovered in or near the Chagos Archipelago would revert to Mauritius. The compensation was intended to support development projects and address the resettlement of the displaced Chagossian community, though its adequacy and distribution have remained subjects of controversy. Various press articles have wrongly suggested that the £3 million payment was for the purchase of the islands from Mauritius, when in fact it was compensation tied to the detachment of the archipelago and broader commitments made by the British government.

On 25 May 1967, less than two years after the agreement with Premier Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Prime Minister Harold Wilson attended a Cabinet Committee meeting alongside the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaries of State for Commonwealth Affairs, Economic Affairs, Defence, and the Home Department. During this meeting, the Commonwealth Secretary noted that at the time of the 1965 agreement, Mauritian ministers were unaware of Britain&#x27;s negotiations with the United States for a financial contribution toward the compensation. Mauritian officials were also informed that there would be no additional contribution from the United States, as this was a matter solely between the U.K. and Mauritius. The British government made it clear that the £3 million was the maximum it could afford and that if Mauritius did not accept the proposal, the U.K. would not proceed with arrangements for granting independence.

During the same meeting, the Secretary of State for Defence stated that when the British Indian Ocean Territory was established, the U.K. had arranged compensation for both Mauritius and the Seychelles for the detachment of islands, with a total budget of approximately £10 million. The United States had agreed to contribute up to half of this amount, with a maximum of £5 million. To avoid potential embarrassment in the U.S. Congress, the U.S. government requested that its financial contribution remain secret. As a result, it was arranged that the U.S. contribution would be concealed by waiving certain payments owed by the U.K. to the U.S. in connection with the development of the Polaris missile program.

On 30 December 1966, the United States and the United Kingdom executed an agreement through an Exchange of Notes which permit the United States Armed Forces to use any island of the BIOT for defence purposes for 50 years, until December 2016, followed by a 20-year optional extension (to 2036) to which both parties must agree by December 2014. , only the atoll of Diego Garcia has been transformed into a military facility.

In 1967 the British Government bought the entire assets and real property of the Seychellois Chagos Agalega Company, which owned all the islands of the BIOT, for £660,000 and administered them as a government enterprise while awaiting US funding of its proposed facilities, with an interim objective of paying for the administrative expenses of the new territory. The plantations, under their previous private ownership and under government administration, proved consistently unprofitable due to the introduction of new oils and lubricants in the international marketplace and the establishment of vast coconut plantations in the East Indies and the Philippines.

Between 1967 and 1973, the population was forcibly removed from the islands and moved to Mauritius and the Seychelles to make way for a joint United States–United Kingdom military base on Diego Garcia. In March 1971, United States naval construction battalions (Seabees), arrived on Diego Garcia to begin the construction of the Communications Station and an airfield. To satisfy the terms of an agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States for an uninhabited island, the plantation on Diego Garcia was closed in October of that year.

The plantation workers and their families were initially deported to the plantations on Peros Banhos and Salomon atolls in the group; those who requested were transported to the Seychelles or Mauritius. In 1972, the UK closed the remaining plantations (all being now uneconomic) of the Chagos, and deported the Ilois who would have faced economic hardship to the Seychelles or Mauritius. The independent Mauritian government refused to accept these further displaced islanders without payment and in 1973, the United Kingdom agreed and gave them an additional £650,000 as reparation payments to resettle the people. Some people were of the view that they were rehoused and employed under worse conditions than other Mauritians. The islands were becoming costly to live in due to industrial moves away from coconut oils and copra fibre markets and the success of larger plantations in the far east.

===2000–present===
In 2002, Diego Garcia was used twice for US rendition flights.

On 13 October 2009, the Cabinet of the Maldives Government decided to see if the Maldives can claim for an extended continental shelf.

On 26 July 2010, the Republic of Maldives submitted to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, in accordance with Article 76, paragraph 8, of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.

On 1 April 2010, the British government announced the establishment of the Chagos Marine Protected Area as the world&#x27;s largest marine reserve. At 640,000 km2, it is larger than France or the U.S. state of California. It doubled the total area of environmental no-take zones worldwide. On 18 March 2015, the Permanent Court of Arbitration unanimously held that the marine protected area (MPA) which the United Kingdom declared around the Chagos Archipelago in April 2010 violates international law. Anerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister of Mauritius, pointed out that it is the first time that the United Kingdom&#x27;s conduct with regard to the Chagos Archipelago has been considered and condemned by any international court or tribunal.

On 20 December 2010 Mauritius initiated proceedings against the United Kingdom under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to challenge the legality of the Chagos Archipelago MPA.

The issue of compensation and repatriation of the former inhabitants of several of the archipelago&#x27;s atolls, exiled since 1973, continued in litigation, and in 2010 it was submitted to the European Court of Human Rights by a group of former residents.

Litigation continued in 2012 regarding the right of return for the displaced islanders and Mauritian sovereignty claims. In addition, advocacy on the Chagossians&#x27; behalf continues both in the United States and in Europe. In 2018, Mauritius took the matter to the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion, against British objections.

In 2014, a Feasibility Study for the Resettlement of the British Indian Ocean Territory was undertaken by the UK Government by consultants from KPMG.

The objectives of the study were to assess costs and sustainability of resettlement over five, ten, and twenty years, evaluate economic self-sufficiency, risks, and environmental implications, explore potential resettlement options ranging from small-scale pilot projects to larger-scale resettlements.

A neutral analysis was undertaken, including consultations with the Chagossian community and environmental assessments.
Options considered included modern lifestyles, subsistence living, eco-villages, and research stations.
Legal, environmental, infrastructure, and economic aspects were analysed.

Large-scale resettlement (1,500 people), medium-scale (500 people), and a pilot scheme (150 people) were proposed.
Diego Garcia was a preferred location due to existing infrastructure, with Ile du Coin and Boddam also being provisional initial candidate sites.

Chagossians expressed a strong preference for permanent resettlement, not temporary visits.
They emphasized the need for modern living standards, environmental conservation, and access to UK-level education and healthcare.

Most islands are low-lying and vulnerable to climate change, with varying suitability for habitation.
Environmental protections and monitoring would be critical.

Employment opportunities could include tourism, fishing, and environmental monitoring.
High-end and eco-tourism were seen as potential revenue generators.

Amendments to BIOT&#x27;s legal framework would be required to facilitate resettlement.
Governance models could draw from other small British Overseas Territories like Pitcairn and Ascension Island.

In November 2016, the United Kingdom restated it would not permit Chagossians to return to the islands.

In July 2021, the Chagos Refugees Group UK submitted a complaint to the Irish government against domain-name speculators Paul Kane and Ethos Capital subsidiary Afilias, seeking repatriation of the .io (&quot;Indian Ocean&quot;) country-code top-level domain and payment of back royalties from the $7 million per year in revenue generated by the domain. While attempts to repatriate top-level domains are not uncommon, this one is notable in that it cites consumer and human rights violations of the OECD&#x27;s 2011 Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises rather than multistakeholder representation under ICANN policy, and because the .IO domain has enjoyed commercial success, particularly among cryptocurrency companies, with more than 270,000 domains registered.

==Sovereignty dispute==

The Chagos had been administered from imperial offices in Mauritius since the 18th century when the French first named the islands. All of the islands forming part of the French colonial territory of Isle de France (as Mauritius was often then known) were ceded to the British in 1810 under the Act of Capitulation. In 1965, in planning before Mauritian independence, the UK split the archipelago from the territory of Mauritius to form the British Indian Ocean Territory, looking to provide the United States with an uninhabited island base, the country&#x27;s main creditor following the turmoil of the Second World War.

United Nations&#x27; resolutions on self-determination deprecated the parcelling up of imperial territories before independence, without its endorsement and local support, mindful of the Partition of India which provided the strong governments sought by the separate factions but failed to ensure a relatively peaceful transfer of power in many places. Mauritius has repeatedly stated that the British claim that the Chagos Archipelago is one of its territories thwarted its claim to what would be widely considered part of the Mauritian colony and also breached UN resolutions. The UK has stated that the Chagos will be assigned to Mauritius once the islands are no longer required for defence purposes.

The island nation of Mauritius claims the Chagos Archipelago (which is coterminous with the BIOT), including Diego Garcia. Maldives states that the UK&#x27;s claim to a 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone around the Chagos Archipelago is invalid as the islands are considered uninhabited. A subsidiary issue is the Mauritian opposition to the 1 April 2010 UK Government&#x27;s declaration that the BIOT is a Marine Protected Area with fishing and extractive industry (including oil and gas exploration) prohibited.

On 16 November 2016, the UK Foreign Office maintained their ban on repatriation of the islands. In response to this decision, the Prime Minister of Mauritius expressed his country&#x27;s plan to advance the sovereignty dispute to the International Court of Justice. The British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson sought Indian assistance for resolving the dispute involving the UK, the US and Mauritius. India has maintained considerable influence in Mauritius through deep cultural and economic ties. India has maintained that the matter of whether or not to proceed with the UN General Assembly move is a decision for the Mauritian government to make.

On 22 June 2017, the UN General Assembly requested the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius. On 25 February 2019, the International Court of Justice advised that in its opinion:

* “at the time of its detachment from Mauritius” the “Chagos Archipelago was clearly an integral part of that non-self-governing territory&quot;;
* the United Kingdom&#x27;s purported detachment of the Chagos Archipelago “was not based on the free and genuine expression of the will of the people concerned&quot;;
* at the time of the purported detachment, “obligations arising under international law and reflected in the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly during the process of decolonization of Mauritius require[d] the United Kingdom, as the administering Power, to respect the territorial integrity of that country, including the Chagos Archipelago&quot;;
* the “detachment” was therefore “unlawful” such that “the process of decolonization of Mauritius was not lawfully completed when Mauritius acceded to independence in 1968&quot;
* “the United Kingdom&#x27;s continued administration of the Chagos Archipelago constitutes a wrongful act entailing the international responsibility of that State”;
* this “unlawful act” is “of a continuing character” and “the United Kingdom is under an obligation to bring to an end its administration of the Chagos Archipelago as rapidly as possible&quot;; and 
* “all Member States [of the United Nations] are under an obligation to co-operate with the United Nations in order to complete the decolonization of Mauritius.”

On 23 June 2017, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) voted in favour of referring the territorial dispute between Mauritius and the United Kingdom to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in order to clarify the legal status of the Chagos Islands archipelago in the Indian Ocean. The motion was approved by a majority vote with 94 voting for and 15 against.

On 22 May 2019, the United Nations General Assembly debated and adopted a resolution that affirmed that the Chagos archipelago “forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius.” The resolution demanded that the UK &quot;withdraw its colonial administration ... unconditionally within a period of no more than six months.&quot; 116 states voted in favour of the resolution, 55 abstained and only 5 countries supported the United Kingdom. During the debate, the Mauritian Prime Minister, Sir Anerood Jugnauth, described the expulsion of Chagossians as &quot;akin to a crime against humanity,&quot; while the United Kingdom continued to assert that it had no doubt about its sovereignty over the archipelago. The Maldives were one of the countries which supported the UK in the General Assembly vote. It stated that, if the Chagos Archipelago became inhabited, the Maldives claim to an extension of its Exclusive Economic Zone would be affected. The resolution&#x27;s immediate consequence was that the UN and other international organisations became bound by UN law to support the decolonisation of the Chagos Islands.

On 25 February 2019, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) delivered an advisory opinion that placing the Archipelago under British administration in 1965 was not based upon the free expression of the inhabitants and that it thus advised that the United Kingdom should relinquish the archipelago, including the strategic United States military base, for the establishment of which approximately 1,500 inhabitants had been deported. The British government rejected any jurisdiction of the court to deliberate these matters.

The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) voted in favour of setting a six-month deadline for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the Chagos Archipelago, which would then be reunified with Mauritius. The motion was approved by a majority vote with 116 voting for and 6 against. Fifty-six states, including France and Germany, abstained.

On 28 January 2021, the United Nation&#x27;s International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) confirmed the International Court of Justice ruling and ordered Britain to hand over the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius. The ITLOS Special Chamber affirmed that: “it is inconceivable that the United Kingdom, whose administration over the Chagos Archipelago constitutes a wrongful act of a continuing character and thus must be brought to an end as rapidly as possible, and yet who has failed to do so, can have any legal interests in permanently disposing of maritime zones around the Chagos Archipelago by delimitation”.

On 14 February 2022, a delegation from Mauritius, including the Mauritian ambassador to the UN, raised the Mauritian flag on the Chagossian atoll of Peros Banhos. The move was done in the context of a scientific survey of Blenheim Reef but was regarded as a formal challenge to British sovereignty over Chagos.

On 3 November 2022, the British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly announced that the UK and Mauritius had decided to begin negotiations on sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory, taking into account the recent international legal proceedings. Both states had agreed to ensure the continued operation of the joint UK/US military base on Diego Garcia. 

Whereas these talks included the resettlement of expelled Chagossians, Cleverly&#x27;s successor as British foreign secretary, David Cameron, later ruled out a return of the islanders.

On 3 October 2024, the UK Government made a joint statement with the Mauritian government that they had negotiated for the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands following two years of negotiation whilst still enabling the running of the American military base on Diego Garcia, thereby ruling out the right of return of the Chagossians to that specific island. The deal has come under criticism as Chagossians were not involved in the negotiations. On the same day, former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed stated that the decision to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, despite the Maldives&#x27; claims, was unacceptable. On 6 October 2024, the Democrats Party of the Maldives expressed concern that Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu’s administration had not been making efforts to assert the Maldives&#x27; claim over the Chagos Archipelago, as promised in the presidential pledge.

There has been a consistent theme of negotiations and decisions about the Chagos Islands being made without directly involving or consulting the Chagossian community. This exclusion from the sovereignty negotiations between the UK and Mauritius has fuelled opposition among Chagossians, who feel their voices have been deliberately ignored in determining the future of their homeland. They demand full inclusion in any discussions or treaties regarding the Chagos Islands.

The Chagossians have been engaged in numerous legal battles over their right to return and the sovereignty of the islands. Legal actions like those initiated by Bernadette Dugasse against the UK government for failing to include Chagossians in sovereignty talks further underscore their opposition to decisions made without their input. This reflects a broader struggle for recognition of their rights and sovereignty over their land.

In 2021, Mauritius amended its Criminal Code through the Criminal Code (Amendment) Act 2021, enacted on 26 November 2021, to introduce Section 76B, which criminalizes actions that misrepresent Mauritius&#x27; sovereignty over any part of its territory. The law applies to individuals acting under the authority, instructions, or financial support (direct or indirect) of a foreign state and imposes penalties of a fine or imprisonment of up to 10 years. Offenses include producing, distributing, or marketing coins, stamps, maps, or official documents that misrepresent Mauritius&#x27; sovereignty, as well as instructing others to do so. A &quot;foreign state&quot; under this provision refers to any country that an international court or tribunal has determined to have no valid claim over any part of Mauritius&#x27; territory.

==Development==
Structures on the islands are located in the joint defence and Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia, although the Plantation house and other structures left behind by the Ilois are still standing, however left abandoned and decaying. Other uninhabited islands, especially in the Salomon Atoll, are common stopping points for long-distance yachtsmen travelling from Southeast Asia to the Red Sea or the coast of Africa, although a permit is required to visit the outer islands.

== People and language ==
=== Chagossians ===

The islanders were known as the Ilois (a French Creole word for &quot;islanders&quot;) and they numbered about 1,000. They were of mixed African, South Indian, Portuguese, English, French and Malay descent and lived very simple, spartan lives in their isolated archipelago working in the coconut and sugar plantations, or in the fishing and small textile industries. Few remains of their culture have been left, although their language is still spoken by some of their descendants in Mauritius.

The inhabitants of Chagos were speaking Chagossian Creole, also known as Ilois creole, a French Creole which has not been properly researched from the linguistic point of view.

The island names are a mixture of Dutch, French, English and Ilois Creole.

The Ilois who inhabited the islands were forcibly removed by the US and British governments during the late 1960s and early 1970s—effectively turning the islands into a military base. While a number of islanders had petitioned for the return of their former homes and their right to return has been recognised by the UN General Assembly, the International Court of Justice, and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the US and UK legal systems have refused to adhere to these decisions, leaving the Chagossians in exile.

===Other===
Diego Garcia is currently the only inhabited island in the Chagos, all of which comprise the British Indian Ocean Territory, usually abbreviated as &quot;BIOT&quot;. The UK considers it an Overseas territory of the United Kingdom, and the Government of the BIOT consists of a Commissioner appointed by the King on the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The Commissioner is assisted by an Administrator and small staff, and is based in London and resident in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. This administration is represented in the Territory by the Officer commanding British Forces on Diego Garcia, the &quot;Brit Rep&quot;. Laws and regulations are promulgated by the Commissioner and enforced in the BIOT by the British Representative.

There are no indigenous peoples living on the island, and the UK represents the Territory internationally. A local government as normally envisioned does not exist. Around 1,700 armed services personnel and 1,500 civilian contractors, mostly American, are stationed on Diego Garcia.

, the islands have a transitory population of about 3,000 including 300 British government personnel, 2,700 United States Army, Navy and Air Force personnel.

The Catholics are pastorally served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Port-Louis, which includes the BIOT.

==Ecology==

The Chagos, together with the Maldives and Lakshadweep, forms the Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago tropical moist forests terrestrial ecoregion. The islands and their surrounding waters are a vast oceanic Environment Preservation and Protection Zone (EPPZ) (Fisheries Conservation and Management Zone (FCMZ) of ), an area twice the size of the UK&#x27;s land surface.

The deep oceanic waters around the Chagos Islands, out to the 200 nautical mile limit, include an exceptional diversity of undersea geological features (such as 6000 m deep trenches, oceanic ridges, and sea mounts). These areas almost certainly harbour many undiscovered and specially adapted species. Although the deepwater habitats surrounding the islands have not been explored or mapped in any detail, work elsewhere in the world has shown that high physical diversity of the sea floor is closely linked to a high diversity of species.

The biodiversity of the Chagos archipelago and its surrounding waters is one of the main reasons it is so special. As of 2010, 76 species that call Chagos home were listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

===Coral===
The reefs host at least 371 species of coral including the endemic brain coral &quot;Ctenella chagius&quot;. Historically, the coral cover was dense and healthy even in deep water on the steep outer reef slopes. Thick stands of branching staghorn coral (&quot;Acropora&quot; sp) previously protected the low-lying islands from wave erosion. Despite the loss of much of the coral in a bleaching event in 1998 the recovery in the Chagos was remarkable and overall coral cover increased year on year to 2014. High water temperatures, however, caused coral bleaching in both 2015 and 2016 which resulted in the death of more than two thirds of corals.

===Fish===

The reefs are also home to at least 784 species of fish that stay near to the shores of the islands including the endemic clownfish (&quot;Amphiprion chagosensis&quot;) and many of the larger wrasse and grouper that have already been lost from over-fishing in other reefs in the region.

As well as the healthy communities of reef fish there are significant populations of pelagic fish such as manta rays (&quot;Manta birostris&quot;), whale sharks, other sharks, and tuna. Shark numbers have dramatically declined as a result of illegal fishing boats that seek to remove their fins and also as accidental by-catch in the two tuna fisheries that used to operate seasonally in the Chagos.

===Birds===
Seventeen species of breeding seabird can be found nesting in huge colonies on many of the islands in the archipelago, and 10 of the islands have been designated Important Bird Areas by BirdLife International. This means that Chagos has the most diverse breeding seabird community in this tropical region. Of particular interest are the large colonies of sooty terns (&quot;Sterna fuscata&quot;), brown and lesser noddies (&quot;Anous stolidus&quot; and &quot;Anous tenuirostris&quot;), wedge-tailed shearwaters (&quot;Puffinus pacificus&quot;) and red-footed boobies (&quot;Sula sula&quot;). Land bird fauna is poor and consists of introduced species and recent natural colonisers. Red fody has been introduced and is now widespread.

===Mammals===
Environments in the Chagos Archipelago provide rich biodiversity and support varieties of cetacean species, such as three populations of blue whales and toothed whales (sperm, pilot, orca, pseudo-orca, risso&#x27;s and other dolphins such as spinners). Dugongs are now locally extinct but once thrived in the archipelago and Sea Cow Island was named after the presence of the species. Donkeys left behind when the Ilois were relocated also roam free.

===Turtles===
The remote islands make perfect undisturbed sites for nests of green (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) and hawksbill (&quot;Eretmochelys imbricata&quot;) turtles. The populations of both species in Chagos are of global significance given the critically endangered status of hawksbills and the endangered status of green turtles on the IUCN Red List. Chagos turtles had been heavily exploited for two centuries but they and their habitats are now well protected by the government of the British Indian Ocean Territory and are recovering well.

===Crustaceans===
The coconut crab (&quot;Birgus latro&quot;) is the world&#x27;s largest terrestrial arthropod, reaching more than a metre in leg span and 3.5–4 kilos in weight. As a juvenile it behaves like a hermit crab and uses empty coconut shells as protection, but as an adult this giant crab climbs trees and can crack through a coconut with its massive claws. Despite its wide global distribution, it is rare in most of the areas in which it is found. The coconut crabs on Chagos constitute one of the most undisturbed populations in the world. An important part of their biology is the long distances their young can travel as larvae. This means the Chagos coconut crabs are a vital source for replenishing other over-exploited populations in the Indian Ocean region.

===Insects===

113 species of insect have been recorded from the Chagos Islands.

===Plants===
The Chagos Islands were colonised by plants once there was sufficient soil to support them—probably less than 4,000 years. Seeds and spores arrived on the emerging islands by wind and sea and from passing seabirds. The native flora of the Chagos Islands is thought to consist of forty-one species of flowering plant and four ferns, as well as a wide variety of mosses, liverworts, fungi and cyanobacteria.

Today the status of the Chagos Islands’ native flora depends very much on past exploitation of particular islands. About 280 species of flowering plant and fern have now been recorded on the islands, but this increase reflects the introduction of non-native plants by humans, either accidentally or deliberately. As some of these non-native species have become invasive and pose a threat to the native ecosystems, plans are being developed to control them. On some islands native forests were felled to plant coconut palms for the production of copra oil. Other islands remain unspoiled and support a wide range of habitats, including unique &quot;Pisonia&quot; forests and large clumps of the gigantic fish poison tree (&quot;Barringtonia asiatica&quot;). Unspoiled islands provide us with the biological information that we need to re-establish the native plant communities on heavily altered islands. These efforts will ultimately help to improve the biodiversity of the Chagos Islands.

==Conservation efforts==

===Past===

Successive UK governments, both Labour and Conservative, have supported environmental conservation of the Chagos. They have committed to treating the whole area as a World Heritage Site. In 2003 the UK government established an Environment (Protection and Preservation) Zone under Article 75 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea extending 200 nautical miles from the islands. On eastern Diego Garcia, the largest island of the Chagos and the site of a UK–US military facility, Britain has designated the very large lagoon and the eastern arm of the atoll and seaward reefs as a &quot;wetland of international importance&quot; under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (the Ramsar Convention).

===Present===
On 1 April 2010 Britain announced the creation of the Chagos Marine Protected Area, the world&#x27;s largest continuous marine protected reserve, with an area of .

This followed an effort led by the Chagos Environment Network, a collaboration of nine leading conservation and scientific organisations seeking to protect the rich biodiversity of the Chagos Archipelago and its surrounding waters. The Chagos Environment Network cites several reasons for supporting a protected area.

The UK government opened a three-month public consultation, which ended after 5 March 2010, on conservation management of the Chagos Islands and its surrounding waters.

On 1 April 2010 the British government Cabinet established the Chagos Archipelago as the world&#x27;s largest marine reserve. At 640,000 km2 it is larger than France or the US state of California. It doubled the total area of environmental no-take zones worldwide. The protection of the marine reserve will be guaranteed for the next five years thanks to the financial support of the Bertarelli Foundation. The setting up of the Marine Reserve would appear to be an attempt to prevent any repatriation by the inhabitants evicted in the 1960s and 1970s. Leaked US cables have shown the FCO suggesting to its US counterparts that setting up a protected no-take zone would make it &quot;difficult, if not impossible&quot; for the islanders to return. The reserve was then created in 2010.

====Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling====
On 18 March 2015 the Permanent Court of Arbitration unanimously held that the marine protected area (MPA) that the UK had declared around the Chagos Archipelago in April 2010 violated international law. Anerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister of Mauritius, pointed out that it was the first time that the UK&#x27;s conduct with regard to the Chagos Archipelago had been considered and condemned by any international court or tribunal. He qualified the ruling as an important milestone in the relentless struggle, at the political, diplomatic and other levels, of successive governments over the years for the effective exercise by Mauritius of its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. The tribunal considered in detail the undertakings given by the United Kingdom to the Mauritian Ministers at the Lancaster House talks in September 1965. The UK had argued that those undertakings were not binding and had no status in international law. The Tribunal firmly rejected that argument, holding that the undertakings became a binding international agreement upon the independence of Mauritius and had bound the UK ever since. It found that the UK&#x27;s commitments towards Mauritius in relation to fishing rights and oil and mineral rights in the Chagos Archipelago were legally binding. The Tribunal also found that the United Kingdom&#x27;s undertaking to return the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius when no longer needed for defence purposes was legally binding. This establishes that, in international law, Mauritius has real, firm and binding rights over the Chagos Archipelago and that the United Kingdom must respect those rights. The Tribunal went on to hold that the United Kingdom had not respected Mauritius’ binding legal rights over the Chagos Archipelago. It considered the events from February 2009 to April 2010, during which time the MPA proposal came into being and was then imposed on Mauritius.

====WikiLeaks cablegate disclosure ====
According to United States diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks, the UK and US wanted to safeguard the strategic value of the Chagos Islands.

WikiLeaks published a cable from the US embassy in London to Washington stating:
HMG would like to establish a marine park or reserve providing comprehensive environmental protection to the reefs and waters of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), a senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) official informed Polcouns on May 12. The official insisted that the establishment of a marine park—the world&#x27;s largest—would in no way impinge on USG use of the BIOT, including Diego Garcia, for military purposes. He agreed that the UK and U.S. should carefully negotiate the details of the marine reserve to assure that U.S. interests were safeguarded and the strategic value of BIOT was upheld. He said that the BIOT&#x27;s former inhabitants would find it difficult, if not impossible, to pursue their claim for resettlement on the islands if the entire Chagos Archipelago were a marine reserve.

<text>La Danse () is an oil-on-canvas painting created by the French artist William-Adolphe Bouguereau in 1856. The painting is currently held in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris.

The work, commissioned in 1855 by Anatole Bartholoni to decorate a living room at his Paris hotel, represents dance in an allegorical manner. Other canvases in the set are held at the United States Embassy in Paris.

The canvas was donated by Captain Peter Moore to the National Museums for the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in 1981. It was then attributed to the Musée du Louvre, which finally assigned it to the Musée d&#x27;Orsay the same year.

<text>The Return of Spring () is an oil painting on canvas by the French painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau created in 1886. It is among the more well-known of his works. It is now in the collection of the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska, and was acquired in 1951 as the gift of Francis T. B. Martin. The painting was brought to Omaha by George W. Lininger shortly after it was completed. Lininger was an art collector and private gallery owner who routinely opened his gallery to the public for no charge. 

The painting was physically attacked twice – in 1890 and in 1976. Both times, damage was minimal. The attackers were offended by the painting&#x27;s overtly sensual nudity.

A replica of the painting appeared in the ballroom scene at the Beaufort home in the 1993 film, &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (though the film takes place in the 1870s, years before the painting was created).

<text>CHNU-DT (channel 66) is a religious independent television station serving southwestern British Columbia, Canada, including Greater Vancouver, Victoria, the Fraser Valley and surrounding areas. Licensed to the Fraser Valley Regional District, the station is owned by ZoomerMedia and is branded on air as [[Joytv]]. CHNU-DT&#x27;s studios are located on 192 Street/Highway 10 in Surrey, and its transmitter is located on Mount Seymour.

==History==

CHNU-TV was licensed in July 2000 by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to Trinity Television Inc. Trinity Television initially requested to assign CFVT as the station&#x27;s call letters (standing for &quot;Fraser Valley Television&quot;); however, this was denied by Industry Canada. The station first signed on the air on September 15, 2001, under the CHNU callsign. In any case, the call letters had not featured prominently in the station&#x27;s on-air branding, as the station opted to use the on-air brand &quot;NOWTV&quot;. CHNU relied on television advertisements and donations from viewers for financial support.

On November 1, 2004, Trinity Television announced that it was selling CHNU and the licence for a yet-to-be-launched and similarly formatted television station in Winnipeg, CIIT-TV, to Rogers Communications, subject to CRTC approval. The financial difficulties Trinity experienced with operating CHNU and getting CIIT on the air, combined with the fact that it could not raise capital from outside investors because of its status as a charitable organization, were the main reasons given for the sale. The deal was approved several months later, finally giving Rogers a broadcast television station in the Vancouver market, where it had lost bids to launch one in the past. At the same time, Rogers received approval to operate a rebroadcast transmitter in Victoria on UHF channel 21, broadcasting at an effective radiated power of 720 watts. In 2006, the transmitter&#x27;s power was increased to 17.2 kilowatts, with the tower height being decreased to compensate.
After acquiring the station from Trinity Television, Rogers announced in late June 2005 that the station would join the Rogers-owned Omni Television system. The Omni brand had previously been associated only with multicultural stations. The rebranding occurred in September of that year, making CHNU the third station in the Omni television system.
On September 28, 2007, Rogers&#x27; purchase of the Citytv stations formerly owned by CHUM Limited was approved (although CTVglobemedia sold off the stations the previous year). As a condition of approval, Rogers had to sell CHNU and CIIT in Winnipeg due to the CRTC&#x27;s restrictions on owning multiple television stations broadcasting in the same language in a single market. Rogers had a one-year grace period to find a buyer. Rogers subsequently announced plans to purchase Vancouver multilingual station CHNM-DT (channel 42), which the company argued would not violate any ownership restrictions under the CRTC&#x27;s exemptions for stations broadcasting in different languages. On October 31, 2007, CHNU was rebranded &quot;CHNU 10&quot; in order to limit viewer confusion because Rogers&#x27; contemporaneous acquisition of CHNM-TV meant that the Omni Television brand would be transferred to that station in 2008.

On November 6, 2007, Rogers announced that CHNU and CIIT would be sold to S-VOX, owner of VisionTV, with no financial deals being released. The deal was approved by the CRTC on March 31, 2008. The sale was finalized on April 30, 2008, and S-VOX assumed control of the station on May 26 of that year. S-VOX soon announced that both CHNU and CIIT would rebrand as &quot;Joytv&quot;. CHNU rebranded on September 1, 2008, using the on-air brand &quot;Joytv 10&quot;.

In June 2009, S-VOX announced it would sell its broadcasting assets, including CHNU, to ZoomerMedia, a company controlled by Moses Znaimer. The sale was approved by the CRTC on March 30, 2010. ZoomerMedia assumed control of S-VOX&#x27;s broadcasting assets on June 30, 2010. ZoomerMedia closed the Joytv system in 2011. The Joytv brand was retained for CHNU, while CIIT was converted into a religious station under the moniker &quot;HopeTV&quot; now currently known as &quot;FaithTV&quot;.

==Programming==

CHNU features a variety of multi-faith programming. The station also formerly aired a very diverse selection of general entertainment syndicated programming, ranging from sitcoms (such as &quot;Reba&quot; and &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;), dramas (such as &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Supernatural&quot;) to classic programs (such as &quot;Matlock&quot; and &quot;Ironside&quot;), which was dropped in the fall of 2017 in favor of a traditional religious format similar to Winnipeg sister station CIIT. The station also airs a sizeable amount of multicultural religious programming as well, particularly centering on the Christian, Islam, Hindu and Sikh faiths.

===Local productions===
====&quot;The Standard&quot;====
&quot;The Standard&quot; was a news and current affairs program that debuted on CHNU in September 2005. The locally produced program focused on national and international issues, but from a religious and spiritual standpoint. Cancelled for the final time in August 2010, reruns of &quot;The Standard&quot; continue to be seen on CHNU, CIIT and Vision TV; it also formerly aired weekly on CFMT in Toronto and Viceland Canada. The final host of the series was Peter Klein, former producer of the CBS newsmagazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot;; previous hosts included Randall Mark, Andrew Dawson, Rafe Mair, Mark Schneider, Russ Froese and Salimah Ebrahim. The field interviewer position was held by Shannon Nelson, and previously Laura-Lynn Tyler.

Following an initial three-year run that included feature interviews with the likes of Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe; Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper; author Salman Rushdie; Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr. Shirin Ebadi; and HRH Prince Edward, the program was cancelled and ended after the June 6, 2008, broadcast; it was subsequently replaced by &quot;The Daily&quot; when S-VOX took over ownership of the station. It was relaunched in September 2009 as a weekly program hosted by Klein. The program was co-created in 2005 by producer Jonathan Roth (who remained as senior producer throughout the program&#x27;s run) and station general manager Terry Mahoney.

====&quot;The Daily&quot;====
&quot;The Daily&quot; was a talk show that debuted on June 9, 2008, hosted by Mark Washington and Laura-Lynn Thompson. &quot;The Daily&quot; was also broadcast nationally on VisionTV. The program was broadcast from facilities at the Shaw Tower in Downtown Vancouver. The program was cancelled on April 15, 2009.

==Technical information==

===Subchannel===
===Spectrum repacking===
In April 2017, Industry Canada posted new channel assignments for stations as a result of spectrum repacking due to the U.S. 600 MHz spectrum auction. In under five years, CHNU-DT will move to channel 24, which as of April 2017, is occupied by K24IC-D, a translator of KBTC-TV in Bellingham, Washington.

===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
The CRTC granted approval for CHNU to broadcast a digital signal on UHF channel 47 with a stronger transmitter from Abbotsford that would cover most of the Lower Mainland, doubling its coverage area in comparison to that of its analogue transmitter. CHNU flash cut its digital signal into operation on UHF channel 47, on August 31, 2011, the official date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts (the allocation was previously occupied by the pre-transition digital signal of Citytv O&amp;O sister CKVU (channel 10)). Digital television receivers display CHNU-DT&#x27;s virtual channel as its analogue-era UHF channel 66, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.

The CRTC also approved a digital transmitter to serve as a rebroadcaster for CHNU on UHF channel 21 in Victoria, also with a greater coverage area. Although the station is based out of Surrey, British Columbia, the transmitter tower was located in Abbotsford and analog broadcasts were at an insufficient power level to be viewed in many Greater Vancouver municipalities, including the city of Vancouver proper. According to the station&#x27;s website, CHNU primarily targets viewers in the Fraser Valley, Vancouver and Victoria.

<doc id="606115" wikidata="Q807398" url="?curid=606115" title="Barbara Dickson">
<text>Barbara Ruth Dickson (born 27 September 1947) is a Scottish singer and actress whose hits include &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; (a chart-topping duet with Elaine Paige), &quot;Answer Me&quot; and &quot;January February&quot;. Dickson has placed fifteen albums on the UK Albums Chart from 1977 to date, and had a number of hit singles, including four which reached the top 20 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper has described her as Scotland&#x27;s best-selling female singer in terms of the numbers of hit chart singles and albums she has achieved in the UK since 1976.

She is also a two-time Olivier Award-winning actress, with roles including Viv Nicholson in the musical &quot;Spend Spend Spend&quot;, and was the original Mrs. Johnstone in Willy Russell&#x27;s long-running musical &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;. On television she starred as Anita Braithwaite in &quot;Band of Gold&quot;.

== Early life ==
Dickson was born in Dunfermline and went to Woodmill High School. She spent her early childhood in Rosyth before her family moved to Dunfermline in the 1950s. Her father was a cook on a tugboat at Rosyth Dockyard and her mother was from Liverpool. She went to Pitcorthie Primary School when she moved to Dunfermline.

==Career==
=== Early years ===
Dickson&#x27;s singing career started in folk clubs around her native Fife in 1964. Her first commercial recording was in 1968. Her early work included albums with Archie Fisher, the first of which, &quot;The Fate O&#x27; Charlie&quot;, a collection of songs from the Jacobite rebellions, was released in 1969. Her first solo album was &quot;Do Right Woman&quot; in 1970.

=== 1970s–1980s ===
She became a well-known face on the British folk circuit of the late 1960s and early 1970s, but changed her career course after meeting Willy Russell. He was at that time a young student running a folk club in Liverpool. He showed Dickson the first draft of what later became the award-winning musical &quot;John, Paul, George, Ringo ... and Bert&quot; and asked her to perform the music. The combination of his writing, the cast (including Antony Sher, Bernard Hill and Trevor Eve, who were unknown at the time) and Dickson&#x27;s idiosyncratic interpretation of Beatles songs made the show highly successful.

The show&#x27;s co-producer, Robert Stigwood, signed Dickson to his record label, RSO Records, for whom she recorded the album &quot;Answer Me&quot;, arranged and produced by Junior Campbell, the title track becoming a top 10 hit in 1976. &quot;John, Paul, George, Ringo … and Bert&quot; also led to her guest residency on &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, which brought Dickson&#x27;s singing to the attention of more than ten million BBC Television viewers every week.

Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice also spotted Dickson in &quot;John, Paul, George, Ringo … and Bert&quot;, and invited her to record &quot;Another Suitcase in Another Hall&quot; from their new musical &quot;Evita&quot;, which became her second hit in 1977. She contributed two tracks to &quot;Scouse the Mouse&quot; a children&#x27;s album (1977) with Ringo Starr and others. During the late 1970s, Dickson also contributed backing vocals to two best-selling albums by the Scottish singer-songwriter Gerry Rafferty: &quot;City to City&quot; (1978) and &quot;Night Owl&quot; (1979). Other solo hits, including &quot;Caravan Song&quot; and &quot;January February&quot;, followed for Dickson in 1980.

An abridged version of the song &quot;Best of Friends&quot;, sung by Dickson, was used as the closing theme for &quot;Andy Robson&quot;, an ITV children&#x27;s television series broadcast during 1982 and 1983. It was never released commercially until 2021 when the full version featured on the Special Edition release of Dickson&#x27;s album &quot;Heartbeats&quot;.

In 1982, Willy Russell invited Dickson to star in his new musical &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; in the pivotal role of the mother, Mrs Johnstone. Although at first reluctant to accept, having never acted before, she accepted, and garnered critical acclaim, as well as the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 1983. She has reprised the role many times, including in 2004 at the Liverpool Empire Theatre.

In 1984, Tim Rice approached Dickson to take part in the recording of the concept album for the musical &quot;Chess&quot; in the role of Svetlana. Dickson&#x27;s songs on the album include &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot;, a duet sung with Elaine Paige. The song was a worldwide hit, and remained at number one on the UK Singles Chart for four weeks. According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, it remains the best-selling female duet.

Starting in 1983, Dickson and her backing band began appearing in musical interludes for the BBC Scotland comedy show &quot;Scotch and Wry&quot;. In 1984, Dickson starred in her own television special for BBC2, in which she travelled around Scotland.

=== 1990s ===
During the 1990s, Dickson appeared in various television dramas, including &quot;Taggart&quot;, &quot;Band of Gold&quot; and &quot;The Missing Postman&quot;. The writer and director Chris Bond created a stage show for Dickson in 1996 called &quot;The Seven Ages of Woman&quot;, which won her the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; Actress of the Year Award. It premiered at the Liverpool Playhouse and toured extensively in 1997 and 1998.

She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1998, when she was surprised by Michael Aspel at the Groucho Club in London.

In 1999, Dickson starred in &quot;Spend Spend Spend&quot;, a new musical by Steve Brown and Justin Greene. The show, based on the rollercoaster life story of pools winner, Viv Nicholson, played in the West End to capacity audiences. For her portrayal of Nicholson, Dickson was awarded Best Actress in a Musical at the 2000 Laurence Olivier Awards. Dickson went on to star in the UK tour of the show.

Further theatre work followed in &quot;Friends Like This&quot;, the Heather Brothers musical &quot;A Slice of Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;Fame&quot;. During 2006, Dickson appeared as the Timekeeper in Alan Ayckbourn and Denis King&#x27;s fantasy musical play &quot;Whenever&quot; for BBC Radio 4. She returned to television in the BBC daytime drama series &quot;Doctors&quot; with her episode, &quot;Mama Sings The Blues&quot;, being broadcast in March 2008.

In 2003, Dickson worked with Russell again, providing backing vocals for his album &quot;Hoovering the Moon&quot;. In 2004, &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot;, featuring some of her most successful recordings, reached number 35 in the UK Albums Chart. Her 2004 album, &quot;Full Circle&quot;, was produced and arranged by Troy Donockley, and saw Dickson returning to her folk roots. In 2006, she issued a collection of the songs of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Change My World&quot;.

=== 21st century ===
Dickson&#x27;s twenty-fourth studio album, &quot;Time and Tide&quot;, was released in January 2008, featuring a mix of contemporary and folk songs, including &quot;Palm Sunday&quot;, which marked Dickson&#x27;s return to songwriting after a break of almost twenty years. A live DVD, &quot;Into the Light&quot;, was released to coincide with the release of &quot;Time and Tide&quot;, and included, as well as some of her best-loved hits, several tracks from her new album. A double live CD, &quot;Barbara Dickson in Concert&quot;, was released in April 2009, and was followed later in the year by her autobiography, &quot;A Shirt Box Full of Songs&quot;.

Between February and March 2011, Dickson undertook a tour of the UK and Ireland to promote her new studio album, &quot;Words Unspoken&quot;. Arranged and produced by Troy Donockley, the album included tracks such as &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, &quot;Jamie Raeburn&quot; and &quot;The Trees They Do Grow High&quot;.

A tribute album to her friend Gerry Rafferty – &quot;To Each And Everyone – The Songs of Gerry Rafferty&quot; – was released in September 2013, and her album, &quot;Winter&quot;, a collection of seasonal favourites, was released in time for Christmas 2014.

2018&#x27;s &quot;Through Line&quot; was followed by &quot;Time Is Going Faster&quot;, Dickson&#x27;s 25th studio album, which spent three months in the Official Folk Album Chart and received widespread acclaim, particularly for her own compositions. The single, &quot;Where Shadows Meet The Light&quot;, marked her first single release since 1995&#x27;s &quot;Love Hurts&quot;. A completely revised and updated paperback edition of Dickson&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;A Shirt Box Full of Songs&quot;, was released to tie-in with the new album, together with an audiobook and Kindle edition.

Her first online show, &quot;Barbara Dickson: Ballads And Blether&quot;, streamed on 20 March 2021 with a limited-edition DVD and CD of the evening available through her official website. The same year, she presented a series of podcasts, &quot;Answer Me Ten... With Barbara Dickson&quot;, in which she interviewed several well-known female singers, including Petula Clark, Toyah, Kiki Dee, Kim Wilde and Eddi Reader.

Between March and April 2022, Dickson and her band toured the UK in support of the album &quot;Time Is Going Faster&quot;. 

In March 2022, Dickson starred in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Road and the Miles to Dundee&quot;, written by Val McDermid and directed by Turan Ali.

==Personal life==
In 1984, Dickson married former actor Oliver Cookson, who went on to work as an Assistant Director in television for the BBC, and has three sons. As of 2015, she and her family had lived in Edinburgh for a number of years. She was awarded an OBE in the Queen&#x27;s New Year Honours in 2002 for her services to Music and Drama.

Interviewed for &quot;Fern Britton Meets&quot; in 2017, Dickson discussed her conversion to Catholicism while living in Richmond during her 30s, and the crisis that she had suffered while appearing in Willy Russell&#x27;s &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; 2004 Liverpool stage production. It resulted in Dickson taking a four-week break from her starring role; once she had sufficiently recuperated, Dickson moved to London&#x27;s West End, when the &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; Liverpool run transferred there. She said that her personal crisis led to many years of stage fright and she withdrew from public performing until therapy helped to work through her anxieties.

<text>L&#x27;Amour et Psyché, enfants is an oil painting executed by the French painter William Adolphe Bouguereau in 1890. It is currently in a private collection. It was displayed in the Salon of Paris in 1890, the year Bouguereau was President of the Société des Artistes Français. The painting features Greek mythological figures Eros and Psyché, sharing an embrace and kiss. Bouguereau was a classical-style painter in the Neoclassical era of art. The painting is characterized by the frothy background the figures delicately stand on. It depicts the beginning of the forbidden romance of Cupid and Psyche, a popular subject at the time of execution.

==Subject Matter==
The resurgence of interest in Classical Greek and Roman mythology of the mid-eighteenth century gave way for the renderings to the story of Cupid and Psyche. The daughter of a King and Queen, Psyche was born with beauty that led to men worshipping her. This angered Venus, Cupid&#x27;s mother and Goddess of Beauty. She sent Cupid to prick her with his arrow, forcing her to fall in love with a hideous creature as revenge. Instead, Cupid scratches himself with his own arrow and falls in love with Psyche. He marries her in secrecy on the condition that she may never see his face. He flees when her curiosity gets the better of her. Psyche roams the earth and underworld in search of her lover. They eventually reunite and she is granted the gift of immortality. Their triumph over adversity from Venus and their differences in mortality makes this theme popular.

Cupid, the Roman interpretation of Eros, is often portrayed as a fantastic, mischievous winged baby with a bow and arrow. Eros, the Greek equivalent, is often depicted in as a young man and Psyche as a young woman. Bouguereau chose to portray the characters of Cupid and Psyche as young children, almost babies. He painted Psyche with butterfly wings, for psyche was the Greek word given to butterflies by Aristotle. Psyche is a symbol to the transformation of the human soul, as she transforms from human to immortal. The decision to paint the characters as children is a reference to their innocence, before the corruption of their affair by Venus. In other paintings, Bouguereau depicted Cupid and Psyche as the more familiar young lovers.

==Composition==

The characters of Cupid and Psyche are fixed onto a long, vertical canvas. Cupid places a leg on a cloud for balance, and similarly balances the frame. Limbs interconnect in soft embraces. Bouguereau catches Cupid and Psyche in an inhale of breath, placing a light peck on Psyche&#x27;s cheek. Her hand almost pushes Cupid away, and she looks down and away from him. The blue cloth floats behind them and onto the surrounding clouds. The focus is on the subjects, who are above the earthly realm and gracefully play in the sky.

The style in which Bouguereau chooses to paint the children is articulated and meaningful. Their white flesh is luminous and rosy, a symbol of their purity. Wings sprout delicately from their shoulders. Bouguereau invokes whimsical elements of childhood and young love through the use of pastels and soft, velvety brushstrokes. The painting is mostly blue, an uncommon color for the portrayal of a love story. By not using pinks and reds, the painter steers away from the theme of forbidden love and towards the idea of young love. The colors are cool and crisp. Bouguereau takes care to accurately portray the pudginess of Cupid and Psyche. The painting is full of texture from the light fabrics, wispy golden hair, and smoothness of their skin.

== Other paintings by Bouguereau on Cupid and Psyche ==
Bouguereau was inspired by the story of Cupid and Psyche several times:
# &quot;Psyché et l&#x27;Amour&quot; (&quot;Psyche and Cupid&quot;, Salon of 1889, No. 260; Exposition Universelle of 1900, No. 242)
# &quot;Psyché&quot; (1892)
# &quot;Le ravissement de Psyché&quot; (&quot;The Abduction of Psyche&quot; or &quot;The Rapture of Psyche&quot;, Salon of 1895, No. 258)

<text>Nymphs and Satyr () is an oil on canvas painting created by the French artist William-Adolphe Bouguereau in 1873. The painting depicts a satyr and a group of nymphs from Greek mythology.

&quot;Nymphs and Satyr&quot; was exhibited in Paris at the 1873 Salon, which opened on 5 May, a year before the Impressionists mounted their first exhibition. It was displayed along with a verse from the ancient Roman poet, Publius Statius: &quot;Conscious of his shaggy hide and from childhood untaught to swim, he dares not trust himself to deep waters.&quot;

One critic called it &quot;the greatest painting of our generation&quot;. Purchased for 35,000 francs by the American art collector and speculator John Wolfe on 26 June, 1873, it was displayed in his mansion for many years alongside other high-style French academic paintings. It was sold at auction in 1888, after which the painting was displayed in the bar of the Hoffman House Hotel, New York City until 1901, when it was bought and stored in a warehouse, the buyer hoping to keep its &#x27;offensive&#x27; content from the public. Robert Sterling Clark discovered the piece in storage and acquired it in 1942. The piece is currently on display at the Clark Art Institute located in Williamstown, Massachusetts.

According to the Clark Institute, in the painting, which is based on the Greek mythology, &quot;a group of nymphs have been surprised, while bathing in a secluded pond, by a lascivious satyr. Some of the nymphs have retreated into the shadows on the right; others, braver than their friends, are trying to dampen the satyr&#x27;s ardor by pulling him into the cold water – one of the satyr&#x27;s hooves is already wet and he clearly wants to go no further. Bouguereau’s working methods were traditional; he made a number of sketches and drawings of carefully posed human figures in complicated interconnected poses, linking them together in this wonderfully rhythmical composition.&quot;

The painting, the largest and one of the most beloved of the Clark collection, was cleaned prior to March 10, 2012, with the help of a grant from the Parnassus Foundation, courtesy of Jane and Raphael Bernstein.

<text>A Day at the Races is a 1937 American comedy film, and the seventh film starring the Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo and Chico), with Allan Jones, Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan and Margaret Dumont. Like their previous Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer feature &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, this film was a major hit.

==Plot==
The Standish Sanitarium, owned by Judy Standish, has fallen on hard times. Banker J.D. Morgan, who owns a nearby race track, hotel and nightclub, holds the mortgage on the sanitarium and is attempting to foreclose on it in order to convert the building into a casino. Tony, Judy&#x27;s faithful employee, suggests asking financial help from the wealthy patient Mrs. Emily Upjohn, who is a hypochondriac, living at the sanitarium. After being pronounced healthy by the sanitarium&#x27;s doctors, Mrs. Upjohn threatens to leave for treatment by Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush. Tony overhears her praise of Hackenbush, who is, unknown to anyone, a horse doctor. Tony gets an idea to invite Hackenbush to run the Sanitarium so Mrs. Upjohn will stay and help Judy financially. Tony contacts Hackenbush in Florida by telegram and when the Doctor arrives he immediately insults the Sanitarium&#x27;s business manager Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore, being Morgan&#x27;s stooge, is suspicious of Hackenbush&#x27;s medical background.

Meanwhile, Judy&#x27;s beau, singer Gil Stewart, who performs at Morgan&#x27;s nightclub, has just spent his life savings on a racehorse named Hi-Hat. He hopes the horse, which he purchased from Morgan, will win a race and the money will allow Judy to save the Sanitarium. The two have a falling out over the horse, but reconcile when Gill admits that he has doubts about Hi-Hat winning. Gil has no money left over to pay for Hi-Hat&#x27;s feed, and he, Tony and Stuffy, Hi-Hat&#x27;s jockey, have to resort to trickery to fend off the Sheriff who has come to collect money for the feed bill. Tony raises some money by scamming Hackenbush in the &quot;Tutsi Fruitsy Ice Cream&quot; scene, selling him a tip on a horse in code—and the numerous books needed to decipher it.

With help from Tony and Stuffy, Hackenbush sabotages Whitmore&#x27;s attempts to out him as a horse doctor, first by crank calling Whitmore until he&#x27;s annoyed, then hiding a blonde floozy from Mrs. Upjohn, and finally disrupting an examination on Mrs. Upjohn by another doctor. The three, plus Gil and Judy hide out in Hi-Hat&#x27;s stable that evening. Upset by the thought of losing the sanitarium, Gil tries to lift Judy&#x27;s spirits with a song. Stuffy helps by leading a community of poor black people into the stable to dance. Morgan, Whitmore and the Sheriff arrive to arrest Hackenbush, with a written letter from the Florida Medical Board confirming that he&#x27;s a horse doctor. Hi-Hat hears Morgan&#x27;s voice and bolts, easily jumping over several obstacles in the way. Judy suggests to Gil that Hi-Hat is a jumper and Gil enters him into the upcoming steeplechase race.

On the day of the race, Hackenbush, Tony and Stuffy delay the start of the race until Gil sneaks in Hi-Hat behind Morgan&#x27;s back. They all use Hi-Hat&#x27;s fear of Morgan to their advantage, using Morgan&#x27;s voice to scare him before the fence. On the last lap, Hi-Hat and Morgan&#x27;s horse wipe out; when they reach the finish line, it appears that Morgan&#x27;s horse has won. Stuffy realizes that the mud-covered horses were switched after the accident, and Morgan&#x27;s jockey was riding Hi-Hat in the finish, thus making Gil&#x27;s horse the winner, and the sanitarium saved. Hackenbush tells the truth to Mrs. Upjohn and proposes to her, promising to &quot;never look at any other horse&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film went through numerous outlines, treatments, drafts, revisions and a total of eighteen different scripts before arriving at its final version. A major portion of the final screenplay was written by Al Boasberg who also contributed to &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, but due to a disagreement with MGM, he chose not to be given any credit for his work. As they had with &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, the Brothers honed the comic material during a pre-production vaudeville tour.

Groucho&#x27;s character was originally named &quot;Quackenbush&quot; but was changed to &quot;Hackenbush&quot; over threats of lawsuits by several real doctors actually named Quackenbush. In &quot;My Life with Groucho: A Son&#x27;s Eye View&quot;, Arthur Marx relates that in his later years, Groucho increasingly referred to himself by the name Hackenbush.

During production, Irving Thalberg, who had brought the Marx Brothers to MGM in 1934, died suddenly in September, 1936 of pneumonia at the age of 37. Thalberg&#x27;s death left the Marxes without a champion at MGM, and the studio never gave the same level of care and attention to the team they had received under Thalberg. As a result, the Marx Brothers&#x27; three later MGM films are generally considered to be vastly inferior to the first two produced by Thalberg.

The original release of &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; presented the water carnival sequence in light brown sepia and the ballet scene with a blue tint.

Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California was used as a filming location for some of the racetrack scenes.

==Music==
The songs in the film, by Bronislaw Kaper, Walter Jurmann, and Gus Kahn, are &quot;On Blue Venetian Waters&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Is Another Day&quot;, and &quot;All God&#x27;s Chillun Got Rhythm&quot; (featuring Ivie Anderson from Duke Ellington&#x27;s orchestra). Two other songs were slated for the film, but ultimately cut. One, &quot;Dr. Hackenbush&quot;, sung by Groucho about &quot;what a great doctor he is&quot; (&quot;No matter what I treat them for they die from something else&quot;) was performed on the pre-filming tour, but was apparently never shot; Groucho later recorded the song separately. The other, &quot;A Message From The Man In The Moon&quot;, sung by Allan Jones, was shot, but was cut at the last minute because the film was too long. The melody is heard during the opening titles, as some incidental music during the Water Carnival scene, and is &quot;reprised&quot; by Groucho during the final scene. The DVD release of the film includes a rediscovered audio recording for the film soundtrack of the song, performed by Allan Jones.

The film&#x27;s Lindy Hop dance sequence is set to the tune of &quot;All God&#x27;s Chillun Got Rhythm&quot;, and featuring Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers, including Willamae Ricker, Snookie Beasley, Ella Gibson, George Greenidge, Dot Miller, Johnny Innis, Norma Miller and Leon James.

&quot;Cosi-Cosa&quot;, a song sung by Allan Jones in &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, makes an instrumental cameo at the opening of the climactic racetrack scene. The tune would be heard again in the Marxes&#x27; final MGM film, &quot;The Big Store&quot; (1941).

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews from critics continued to be positive for the Marx Brothers through their seventh film. John T. McManus of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;comparatively bad Marx,&quot; although still deserving of &quot;a much better than passing grade&quot; because &quot;any Marx brothers motion picture is an improvement upon almost any other sustained screen slapstick.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; declared, &quot;Surefire film fun and up to the usual parity of the madcap Marxes.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote, &quot;Very good! The Marx Brothers are at their best and funniest here.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was also positive, writing that &quot;Groucho, Harpo, and Chico are in full blast again,&quot; and the film &quot;reaches a fever pitch even beyond earlier records.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it a &quot;ridiculous farce, plummed with unique gags, laugh provoking situations, fast action ... The finale sends audiences away grinning and happy.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Night and Day&quot; magazine of London, Graham Greene gave the film a generally good review, summarizing it as &quot;easily the best film to be seen in London&quot;, but he criticized some elements of the film&#x27;s portrayal. Greene observed that the film gave him &quot;a nostalgia for the old cheap rickety sets&quot; rather than the realistic sets, and although he praised Harpo&#x27;s performance as &quot;shin[ing] the brightest&quot;, he complained that the strong realism in O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s acting set up a strong juxtaposition against the &quot;silliness&quot; of the Marx brothers&#x27; antics.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #59
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:
** Flo Marlowe: &quot;Oh, hold me closer! Closer! Closer!&quot;
** Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush: &quot;If I hold you any closer, I&#x27;ll be in back of you.&quot;

:: — Nominated

According to MGM records, the film earned $1,602,000 domestically and $703,000 foreign, but because of its high cost recorded a loss of $543,000.

==Awards==
The dance sequence for &quot;All God&#x27;s Chillun Got Rhythm&quot; was nominated for the short-lived Academy Award for Best Dance Direction, only given from 1935 to 1937.

==In popular culture==
British rock band Queen named their 1976 studio album after the film. Their 1975 studio album was named after &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, the Marx Brothers&#x27; previous film. Groucho sent a handwritten note to the band, congratulating them on their excellent taste.

<text>Photoevaporation is the process where energetic radiation ionises gas and causes it to disperse away from the ionising source. The term is typically used in an astrophysical context where ultraviolet radiation from hot stars acts on clouds of material such as molecular clouds, protoplanetary disks, or planetary atmospheres.

==Molecular clouds==

One of the most obvious manifestations of astrophysical photoevaporation is seen in the eroding structures of molecular clouds that luminous stars are born within.

== Evaporating gaseous globules (EGGs) ==
Evaporating gaseous globules or EGGs were first discovered in the Eagle Nebula. These small cometary globules are being photoevaporated by the stars in the nearby cluster. EGGs are places of ongoing star-formation. 

==Planetary atmospheres==
A planet can be stripped of its atmosphere (or parts of the atmosphere) due to high energy photons and other electromagnetic radiation. If a photon interacts with an atmospheric molecule, the molecule is accelerated and its temperature increased. If sufficient energy is provided, the molecule or atom may reach the escape velocity of the planet and &quot;evaporate&quot; into space. The lower the mass number of the gas, the higher the velocity obtained by interaction with a photon. Thus hydrogen is the gas which is most prone to photoevaporation.

Photoevaporation is the likely cause of the small planet radius gap.

Examples of exoplanets with an evaporating atmosphere are HD 209458 b, HD 189733 b and Gliese 3470 b. Material from a possible evaporating planet around WD J0914+1914 might be responsible for the gaseous disk around this white dwarf.

==Protoplanetary disks==

Protoplanetary disks can be dispersed by stellar wind and heating due to incident electromagnetic radiation. The radiation interacts with matter and thus accelerates it outwards. This effect is only noticeable when there is sufficient radiation strength, such as coming from nearby O and B type stars or when the central protostar commences nuclear fusion.

The disk is composed of gas and dust. The gas, consisting mostly of light elements such as hydrogen and helium, is mainly affected by the effect, causing the ratio between dust and gas to increase.

Radiation from the central star excites particles in the accretion disk. The irradiation of the disk gives rise to a stability length scale known as the gravitational radius (formula_1). Outside of the gravitational radius, particles can become sufficiently excited to escape
the gravity of the disk, and evaporate. After 106 – 107 years, 
the viscous accretion rates fall below the photoevaporation rates at formula_1. 
A gap then opens around formula_1, the inner disk drains onto the central star, 
or spreads to formula_1 and evaporates. An inner hole extending to formula_1 
is produced. Once an inner hole forms, the outer disk is very rapidly cleared.

The formula for the gravitational radius of the disk is
:formula_6
where formula_7 is the ratio of specific heats (= 5/3 for a monatomic gas), formula_8 the universal gravitational constant, formula_9 the mass of the central star, formula_10 the mass of the Sun,
formula_11 the mean weight of the gas, formula_12 Boltzmann constant,
formula_13 is the temperature of the gas and AU the Astronomical Unit.

If we denote the coefficient in the above equation by the Greek letter formula_14 then

         formula_15  ,                                           .                                                                    

where formula_16 is the number of degrees of freedom and we have used the formula: formula_17.

For an atom, such as a hydrogen atom, then formula_18, because an atom can move in three different, orthogonal directions. Consequently, formula_19. If the hydrogen atom is ionized, i.e., it is a proton, and is in a strong magnetic field then formula_20, because the proton can move along the magnetic field and rotate around the field lines. In this case, formula_21. A diatomic molecule, e.g., a hydrogen molecule, has formula_22 and formula_23. For a non-linear triatomic molecule, such as water, formula_24 and formula_25. If &quot;formula_16&quot; becomes very large, then formula_14 approaches zero. This is summarised in the Table 1 , where we see that different gases may have different gravitational radii.

Table 1: Gravitational radius coefficient as a function of the degrees of freedom.

Because of this effect, the presence of massive stars in a star-forming region is thought to have a great effect on planet formation from the disk around a young stellar object, though it is not yet clear if this effect decelerates or accelerates it.

=== Regions containing protoplanetary disks with clear signs of external photoevaporation ===
The most famous region containing photoevaporated protoplanetary disks is the Orion Nebula. They were called bright proplyds and since then the term was used for other regions to describe photoevaporation of protoplanetary disks. They were discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope. There might even be a planetary-mass object in the Orion Nebula that is being photoevaporated by &quot;θ&quot; 1 Ori C. Since then HST did observe other young star clusters and found bright proplyds in the Lagoon Nebula, the Trifid Nebula, Pismis 24 and NGC 1977. After the launch of the Spitzer Space Telescope additional observations revealed dusty cometary tails around young cluster members in NGC 2244, IC 1396 and NGC 2264. These dusty tails are also explained by photoevaporation of the proto-planetary disk. Later similar cometary tails were found with Spitzer in W5. This study concluded that the tails have a likely lifetime of 5 Myrs or less. Additional tails were found with Spitzer in NGC 1977, NGC 6193 and Collinder 69. Other bright proplyd candidates were found in the Carina Nebula with the CTIO 4m and near Sagittarius A* with the VLA. Follow-up observations of a proplyd candidate in the Carina Nebula with Hubble revealed that it is likely an evaporating gaseous globule.

Objects in NGC 3603 and later in Cygnus OB2 were proposed as intermediate massive versions of the bright proplyds found in the Orion Nebula.

<text>Salgótarján (; , German: &quot;Schalgau&quot;) is a city with county rights in Hungary, the capital of Nógrád County, north-eastern Hungary, making it the third smallest county capital based on population. Nearby Salgó Castle is a well-known tourist attraction.

==Location==
At the foot of Karancs mountain, in the Cserhát hills, 250 meters above sea level, north-east from Budapest, west from Miskolc. Salgótarján is surrounded by beautiful forests and hills topped with castle ruins, which are accessible by bus that may be taken from the center of town.

==History==

The town already existed in the Middle Ages, but information on it is scarce possibly because it was a small settlement. The word &quot;salgó&quot; means &quot;shining&quot; in Old Hungarian, while &quot;Tarján&quot; was the name of one of the Hungarian tribes conquering the area.

The castle of Salgó was built in the 13th century on a mountain of volcanic origin. In the 13th century the town already had a church.

After the 1682 siege of the nearby Castle of Fülek (today Fiľakovo, Slovakia) the town was deserted, and new settlers arrived only ten years later, but remained a small village.

Development came in the mid-19th century, when a coal mine was opened nearby. The job opportunities provided by the mine and the developing industry began to attract people. The village grew quickly and was granted town status in 1922. Today visitors can see the remains of the mining industry by visiting the Mine Museum, which is located next to the main entrance of the mine.

In 1950, Salgótarján became the capital of Nógrád County instead of the previous county seat Balassagyarmat, although the county offices did not move there until 1952. In the next twenty years several villages were annexed to the growing city.

The coal mines closed years ago, leaving the city with high unemployment rates.

In 1994, Salgótarján was granted the rank of city with county rights, in accord with a new law stating that all county seats are cities with county rights. (Previously only cities with a population over 50.000 were granted county rights, and Salgótarján was one of only two county seats that had smaller population than 50.000; the other was Szekszárd).

==Places of interest==
The town is near two ruined castles and contains two museums, among other places of interest.
* Plébániatemplom (Cathedral), located opposite the County History Museum, is the main church in the town.
* Nógrádi Történeti Múzeum (county of Nógrád History Museum) is the town&#x27;s principal museum with exhibits about the history of the county. There is a special exhibit on János Balázs, the Romany poet and painter who lived in the city.
* Nógrádi Történeti Múzeum Bányászati Kiállítóhelye (Mining Museum), is the main mining museum in the country, with exhibits about the history of mining in the region. Visitors can view a section of the mine and see mining equipment.
* Somoskő (Šomoška) Castle in the suburb of Somoskő is the better preserved of the two castles. It is situated atop a hill. One of the three original towers is restored. The castle lies on the Slovak side of the border, but it is easily accessible from the Hungarian village of Somoskő.
* Salgó Castle Ruins, in the suburb of Salgóbánya, is 625 meters above sea level, giving it a panoramic view of the area.

==Sport==
The city has an association football club. Salgótarjáni BTC competed in the Nemzeti Bajnokság III.

* László Boldvai, economist and politician

<doc id="606125" wikidata="Q1136344" url="?curid=606125" title="I Know Him So Well">
<text>&quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; is a duet from the concept album and subsequent musical &quot;Chess&quot; by Tim Rice, Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus. It was originally sung by Elaine Paige (as Florence) and Barbara Dickson (as Svetlana). In this duet, two women – Svetlana, the Russian chess champion&#x27;s estranged wife, and Florence, his mistress – express their bittersweet feelings for him and at seeing their relationships fall apart.

==History==
The chorus of the song is based on the chorus of &quot;I Am an A&quot;, a song performed live during Andersson and Ulvaeus&#x27; group ABBA&#x27;s 1977 tour. Although &quot;I Am an A&quot; was never released officially, it circulated on various bootlegs and is readily available on YouTube.

==Original version==
The duet was first released worldwide on the &quot;Chess&quot; double LP, often referred to as a concept album or album musical, in the autumn of 1984. Later it was released as a single by Paige and Dickson, the duet reaching number one in the UK Singles Chart for four weeks in 1985. They laid down their vocals separately and never met during the recording of the song, only for the video and subsequent performances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and the European tours. This recording remains in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the biggest selling UK chart single ever by a female duo. Paige also appeared in the original London West End stage production of &quot;Chess&quot;. The song peaked at number 21 in Australia.

In the United Kingdom on 18 September 2004, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;All-Time Greatest Love Songs&quot; (hosted by Lionel Richie) saw the duet performed live by Paige and Dickson, together for the first time in 20 years, to a rapturous reception. Paige played her solo demo recording of the song on her BBC Radio 2 show, &quot;Elaine Paige on Sunday&quot;.

In January 2011, the Official Charts Company released a list of the top 10 All Time Best Selling Duets in which &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; was placed seventh in the chart.

Paige and Dickson also recorded Spanish-language lyrics for release as &quot;Lo Creo Conocer&quot;. The single was never released though.

==Cissy Houston and Whitney Houston version==
In 1987, a studio version of &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; was recorded as a duet by Cissy Houston and her daughter Whitney Houston for Whitney&#x27;s second album, &quot;Whitney&quot;. It was released as the 6th and final single from &quot;Whitney&quot; on 30 November 1988 in Australia, Germany, Netherlands, and Spain. There was no official music video produced for the Houston duet of song, however there are live performance video-recordings. The song version was included in the North American leg of Houston&#x27;s Moment of Truth World Tour. The single was not promoted as heavily as previous singles from &quot;Whitney&quot;.

===Critical reception===
Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the duet, saying, &quot;The album ends on a graceful, intimate note as Houston is joined by her mother, singer Cissy Houston, on &#x27;I Know Him So Well&#x27;, a ballad from the musical &quot;Chess&quot;.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Vince Alleti criticized the song and production, saying, &quot;Walden covers all these bases, out-schlocking Masser with &#x27;I Know Him So Well&#x27;—a genuine if frankly derivative show tune (from Tim Rice&#x27;s &quot;Chess&quot;) treated here with deadly reverence...&quot; &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; called the duet lifting and praised the mother&#x27;s role: &quot;Mom adds a brief, welcome moment of grainy soulfulness to the album.&quot;

===Chart performance===
This single peaked at number 46 in Germany and in the Netherlands it peaked at number 14.

<text>Evening Mood (Humeur Nocturne) is an 1882 painting by the French academic painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau, now in the collection of the Havana&#x27;s Museum of Fine Arts, in Cuba.

In an article for &quot;Spatial Vision&quot;, Baingio Pinna praises Bouguereau&#x27;s technical skill, writing:The female sensuality is mainly due to the realistic representation of the young woman and to the enveloping transparent veil moving slowly all around her body and, at a more primary phenomenal level, also to the sinusoid wavy lines that seem to dance synergistically and harmonically through their good continuation.

<text>CIIT-DT (channel 35) is a religious independent television station in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, owned by ZoomerMedia. The station&#x27;s studios are located on Osborne Street and Wardlaw Avenue in Winnipeg, and its transmitter is located near Courchaine Road (near Manitoba Provincial Road 200) in southern Winnipeg.

==History==
===Early life===
In February 2002, Trinity Television Inc. was granted a licence for a religious television station in Winnipeg. The station was set to be launched in September 2004 as &quot;NowTV&quot;, to be the second station using that brand, previously used on Trinity&#x27;s Vancouver station, CHNU-TV. However, the station did not launch on that date.
In 2004, before that station&#x27;s launch, Rogers Communications bought Trinity Television and took control of CIIT&#x27;s licence. Under Rogers control, the station was set to be launched again on November 14, 2005, as the fourth Omni Television station, it was later set back again and launched on February 6, 2006, as &quot;Omni 11&quot;. The use of channel 35 marks CIIT as Winnipeg&#x27;s first ever UHF station.

On September 28, 2007, Rogers&#x27; CRTC application to acquire the Citytv stations, including CHMI in Winnipeg, was approved. As a condition of this approval, Rogers had to sell CIIT and CHNU in Vancouver, in order to comply with CRTC restrictions on owning multiple stations in the same language in the same market. Rogers had a one-year grace period to find new owners for both stations.
On November 6, 2007, Rogers Communications announced the sale of CIIT and CHNU to S-VOX. The deal was approved by the CRTC on March 31, 2008. The sale was finalized on April 30, 2008, and S-VOX assumed control of the station on June 30 of that year. Shortly after S-VOX took control of the station, In July 2008, CIIT disaffiliated from the Omni television system and was subsequently rebranded as &quot;CIIT11&quot;. S-VOX soon announced that both CIIT and CHNU would rebrand under a newly created television brand, Joytv. CIIT was rebranded again on September 1, 2008, using the on-air brand &quot;Joytv 11&quot;.

In June 2009, S-VOX announced it would sell its broadcasting assets to ZoomerMedia, a company controlled by Moses Znaimer. The sale was approved by the CRTC on March 30, 2010. ZoomerMedia assumed control of S-VOX&#x27;s broadcasting assets on June 30, 2010.

===As Hope TV/FaithTV===

In late-August 2013, CIIT re-launched as &quot;Hope TV&quot;, dropping the Joytv format and all secular programs in favour of a traditional religious format. Total weekly viewing hours dropped from 84,000 in Fall 2012 to just 28,000 hours in Fall 2013, recovering slightly to 42,000 hours in Fall 2014—but still equivalent to just one percent of the total viewing hours earned by the Winnipeg CTV station, and two percent of the hours earned by both the CBC and Global stations.

In 2017, CIIT was reprimanded by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council for having aired an episode of the time-buy program &quot;Truth of God&quot;, wherein a pastor referred to U.S. lawmakers as &quot;pedophiles&quot; and with homophobic slurs when discussing his objection to bathroom bills.

In September 2018, CIIT was rebranded &quot;FaithTV&quot;.

==Programming==

As part of Omni Television and Joytv, CIIT aired a lineup primarily consisting of faith-based programming (primarily televangelists and religion-oriented talk shows), syndicated sitcoms and dramas, and leftover U.S. prime time programs not picked up by other Canadian networks. Upon its re-launch as Hope TV, all general entertainment programming was dropped in favor of a lineup consisting only of religious programs.

==Technical information==

===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts, CIIT-TV flash cut its digital signal into operation on UHF channel 35.

==Channel placement==
On Shaw and MTS TV, CIIT airs on channel 11, displacing the longtime previous occupant community access channel Shaw TV (the channel first used channel 11 in 1986 after a previous move from channel 13; the station was formerly called VPW 11, later Videon Cable 11 on Videon before being taken over by Shaw, and GWC-TV (Greater Winnipeg Cablevision) before its Shaw takeover). Shaw has moved their service to channel 9. CIIT is also available on Rogers digital cable for viewers in Ontario.

<text>Peros Banhos, Pedro dos Banhos or Baixos de Pêro dos Banhos in old maps, is a formerly inhabited atoll in the Chagos Archipelago of the British Indian Ocean Territory, also claimed by Mauritius.

Île Yeye, located at the northeastern corner of the atoll, is the island of the Chagos Archipelago that is closest to the Maldives.

==Geography==

The atoll has a total area of , but a land area of only , made up by some 32 islets. , most of the remaining surface is occupied by the lagoon, which is connected to the open sea and the reef flat.

Peros Banhos is a medium-sized coralline atoll circled by a regular coral reef, similar to those in the neighboring Maldives. The diameter of the lagoon, known as &quot;Baie de Peros Banhos&quot; in French, is just above 20 km. The circling reef is sunken on its southeastern rim. All islands are flat and sandy and the largest ones are covered with coconut trees.

The largest and most important island in the group is Île du Coin. It was home to the Perch Settlement from where the coconut plantations of the atoll were run. This island was the main port of the atoll and had a jetty to load and unload merchandise.

Île du Coin was the only island that was settled permanently in Peros Banhos. Other important islands in the atoll that had buildings on them and were also occasionally inhabited were Grande Soeur, Île Diamant, Île Manoël and Île Pierre. All these islands were part of the former coconut plantation run from Île du Coin.

Île Yeye, at the northeastern corner of the atoll, is the island of the Chagos that is closest to the Maldives. The distance between Île Yeye and Gan Island (Addu Atoll) is .

There have been some changes in the geography of this atoll since the first maps were published in the mid-19th century. Île St. Brandon, which was covered with coconut trees when the first survey of this atoll was done, is now just a sandbank. On the other hand, in the western rim of Peros Banhos, the island north of Île Verte was only a small sandbank at the time of Commander Robert Moresby&#x27;s Survey in 1837, but now it is a medium-sized island covered with vegetation.

==History==
Peros Banhos was discovered in 1513 by Portuguese navigator Afonso de Albuquerque. The name of this atoll derives from &quot;Pêro dos Banhos&quot;, the name of another Portuguese navigator who died there after his ship ran aground on this atoll.

The earliest and most interesting description of Peros Banhos was written by Manoel Rangel in &quot;«A Tragédia dos Baixos de Pero dos Banhos»&quot;. He was a castaway from the Portuguese ship &quot;Conceição&quot; under captain Francisco Nobre that ran aground and was smashed on the Peros Banhos reefs in 1556.
165 survivors were left on a flat sandy island of Peros Banhos before coconut trees were there; among them were two women and five Catholic priests. Rangel mentions that there were weeds and grasses and that about ten thousand birds lived on that Island. While the birds lasted the castaways survived, but they began to die in great numbers after having eaten most of the bird population.

According to Manoel Rangel there was drinking water to be found by digging shallow wells in the sand. Also many turtles came to lay eggs on the beach of that island.

Since 1756 Île du Coin was home to a population of up to 500 people. Most of the inhabitants, the Ilois, were workers in the coconut plantations and in the oil-producing industry. The Ilois were Christian and there were churches and primary schools in Peros Banhos before the local population was moved away. Their language was a Creole version of French, known as Chagossian Creole. 

There is a small bushy island called Île Diable on the NW of the atoll.

Moresby Island, at the northern end of Peros Banhos Atoll was named after Robert Moresby, a British hydrographer who made the first accurate survey of the Chagos Archipelago in 1837. After Moresby&#x27;s survey, the first detailed map of Peros Banhos Atoll was published by the Hydrographic Service of the Indian Navy.

In 1970, the entire population of Peros Banhos Atoll was expelled by the British Government and sent to live in Mauritius. More recently, the islands have been investigated as a possible location for resettlement, although access is currently prohibited.

In February 2022, exiled islanders made their first unsupervised visit to the island, following international court rulings and a majority vote in the UN General Assembly. Prime Minister of Mauritius, Pravind Jugnauth, said this was not to embarrass the UK, but &quot;merely an exercise of our sovereignty over part of our territory and that is in accordance with international law.&quot;

==Nature Reserve==

The part of the atoll east of a line drawn between the easternmost point of land on Moresby Island (north) and the easternmost point of land on Fouquet Island (south) fall within the Peros Banhos Atoll Strict Nature Reserve. Entry into this and into the other Strict Nature Reserves, and within of the islands therein is prohibited and activities are clearly proscribed by the British Indian Ocean Territory. It has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for sooty terns, of which 14,000 pairs were recorded in a 2004 survey.

Yachtsmen are advised not to even anchor within the limits of the Peros Banhos Atoll Strict Nature Reserve.

==List of islands==
With some 32 islets, the Peros Banhos Atoll encompasses about half of all islands in the Chagos Archipelago. The individual islands and islets are listed clockwise, starting in the south:
Passe de l&#x27;Île Poule is also called &quot;Passe Elisabeth&quot; on older maps.

The islands in the eastern part are part of the Peros Banhos Strict Nature Reserve, except Île De La Passe and Moresby Island.

<text>Marti Webb (born 1943) is an English actress and singer. She appeared on stage in &quot;Evita&quot; before starring in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s one-woman show &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; in 1980. This included her biggest hit single, &quot;Take That Look Off Your Face&quot;, a UK top three hit, with the parent album also reaching the top three.

==Early life and education==
Marti Webb was born in Cricklewood in 1943. Her parents took her to variety shows and pantomimes as a child. Her father played the violin and her mother sang and played the piano. She attended dance lessons from the age of 3 and first performed in public at the age of 7, at the Scala Theatre, London, initially hoping to be a ballerina.

After a school teacher suggested to her parents that her natural talent for singing and dancing should be nurtured, she was educated at the Aida Foster stage school from the age of 12, where she eventually became Head Girl. Her mother had to take an additional job to order to pay for the school fees. While training, she appeared in BBC Schools programmes. Webb later commented that, having come from a normal school, she found it a shock to be asked to perform in front of her classmates.

The first musical she saw was Lionel Bart&#x27;s &quot;Fings Ain&#x27;t Wot They Used T&#x27;Be&quot; as some of her fellow students were performing in it. The school would send students for auditions regularly, which led to an audition for the original London production of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, although she wasn&#x27;t offered a role. She also auditioned for Oscar Hammerstein II for &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, but being overcome by shyness, spoke very quietly and wasn&#x27;t cast in the show.

She was selected to take part in the television programme &quot;Carol Levis&#x27; Junior Discoveries&quot;, which was broadcast from the Hackney Empire, for which she sang &quot;Musetta&#x27;s Waltz&quot; from &quot;La Boheme&quot;.

== Career ==

=== Musical theatre ===

==== West End debut in &quot;Stop the World, I Want to Get Off&quot; ====
Aged 15, she appeared as Moonbeam in the 1959 Manchester production of &quot;Listen to the Wind&quot; by Vivian Ellis whilst still a student, before leaving school to make her West End debut in &quot;Stop the World, I Want to Get Off&quot;, a show that starred and had lyrics by Anthony Newley. She first discovered her belt voice while rehearsing for the show.

Webb performed &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot; as her audition piece, before a group that included Newley, Lionel Bart, Lionel Blair and Alma Cogan. The group shared a joke during her audition which distracted her and at the end of the piece, she grabbed her music and went to leave the stage. Newley had to stop her to ask for another song and she was so embarrassed, she dropped her sheet music across the stage. Newley later remarked that he&#x27;d loved her from that moment on. The company would go out together to watch other shows and performers, including Lotte Lenya and Ethel Merman.

==== First lead in &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; ====
Webb first came to prominence as Ann Pornick in the original London production of &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; opposite Tommy Steele, citing her first leading role as a career highlight. The playwright Beverley Cross&#x27;s father George was the company manager on the production of &quot;Stop the World, I Want to Get Off&quot; and recommended his son audition Webb for the role. She was offered the role after thirteen auditions and later dubbed the singing voice of Julia Foster, her replacement for the film adaptation. Webb later commented of Foster, &quot;She has quite a notable voice, so it&#x27;s not too hard to pick it up.&quot;

She also played Nancy in the first UK tour of &quot;Oliver!&quot; where she met and befriended the show&#x27;s Assistant Stage Manager Cameron Mackintosh, who was to become one of the most prominent musical theatre producers in the world. Lionel Bart, the show&#x27;s composer and lyricist, saw it numerous times whilst the production was in Manchester, where he was working on the notorious flop, &quot;Twang!!&quot;. When it returned to the West End Phil Collins, who later achieved fame with Genesis and had been one of the original Dodgers, rejoined the production to play Noah Claypole. On the production&#x27;s transfer to the West End in April 1967, Barry Humphries played Fagin. In 1968, she appeared opposite Stuart Damon in the first British production of the musical &quot;Grass Roots&quot;, written by Gretchen Cryer and Nancy Ford, which was directed by Anton Rodgers at the Leatherhead Theatre Club.

During the 1970s, Webb carved out a career as a respected, though not yet famous, West End actress and singer. In 1971, she was one of the original company of the London production of &quot;Godspell&quot;, the musical based on the Gospel of Matthew, opposite David Essex, Julie Covington and Jeremy Irons. The original London cast recording of the production includes her performance of &quot;Bless the Lord&quot;. During the show&#x27;s run, Essex formed a band with Jeff Wayne and recruited Webb and Covington as backing singers.

She left &quot;Godspell&quot; to play Nellie Cotterill in the 1973 original London production of &quot;The Card&quot;, a musical written by Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent which chronicled the rise of the title character from washerwoman&#x27;s son to mayor of a Northern British town through initiative, guile and luck.

The production was short-lived but was followed by the 1974 original London production of &quot;The Good Companions&quot;, alongside John Mills, Judi Dench and Christopher Gable in which she played Susie Dean, a member of a touring concert party. She was flown to Manchester to join the show during its tryout when the original actress Celia Bannerman, whose voice had proved unsuitable for the role, left the production.

====&quot;Evita&quot; and &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot;====
After failing to land any stage roles as the decade wore on, by 1978 a somewhat dejected Webb was working in a travel agency and had stopped auditioning. A British lyricist came into the agency and encouraged her to start auditioning again, and within three months she was cast in &quot;Evita&quot;.

In early 1979, Webb was flown to New York to audition for Harold Prince after Gary Bond, then playing Che in the show, suggested her to the producers of &quot;Evita&quot; as a successor to Elaine Paige who was, at the time, expected to transfer to the recreate the role on Broadway. Prince was impressed and persuaded her to cover while Paige holidayed and sign up as a regular alternate for the remainder of Paige&#x27;s contract, performing two shows a week, in preparation for succeeding Paige as the star. This began an arrangement which existed for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run, with Stephanie Lawrence appearing as Webb&#x27;s alternate before succeeding her.

At her original audition, show&#x27;s composer Andrew Lloyd Webber had asked whether she would be interested if he wrote anything he thought appropriate for her voice. Assuming it was a kindly rejection, she was later surprised to be invited for a meal at Mr. Chow, a London restaurant, with Lloyd Webber and the lyricist Don Black to discuss the concept of a song cycle inspired by the story of a friend of the writers who had moved from London to the United States to begin a new life.

Webb was asked to collaborate on the piece when only two songs, the title piece &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Not the End of the World&quot;, had been written, so the rest was created specifically with her voice and character in mind. Black, who became her manager and a close friend, said of her performance, &quot;She was &#x27;the girl&#x27;, and that was it.&quot; Her tendency to, &quot;Talk for hours about the most boring everyday things, like the gas or insurance&quot;, also inspired him in creating the narrative pieces in the song cycle which were letters to the character&#x27;s mum.

She worked on the piece with Lloyd Webber and Black each day before being driven from Sydmonton Court, Lloyd Webber&#x27;s country house, to the Prince Edward Theatre where &quot;Evita&quot; was playing. An album was recorded and it was performed at the 1979 Sydmonton Festival, the composer&#x27;s annual workshop for new works, where a BBC Television producer contracted the collaborators to produce a version for television featuring Webb backed by a band and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. A one-off performance in January 1980 was recorded at the Royalty Theatre, London. Black recalls, &quot;It was fantastic on television because it was almost all filmed in close-up on Marti Webb&#x27;s face. Every eyebrow raised, every look registered. It was a brilliant piece of TV, like one of Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Talking Heads&quot; series, but sung.&quot;

Recorded in the autumn of 1979, the album of &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; was released and the television programme aired in February 1980 just as Webb took over the eponymous role in &quot;Evita&quot;. It was a No. 2 hit in the UK Albums Chart and saw Webb become a household name. The lead single, &quot;Take That Look Off Your Face&quot;, was a similar success, reaching No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart.

Webb has a distinctive, untrained coloratura voice and Lloyd Webber was said to have told her &quot;You sing in my keys&quot;. She agreed, &quot;You write in mine.&quot; She has since regularly performed at his Sydmonton Festival. He produced her second solo album &quot;Won&#x27;t Change Places&quot; (1981) which featured the lead single &quot;Your Ears Should Be Burning Now&quot;.

In January 2014, Webb again performed &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; initially for a week at the St. James Theatre, London, then for a fortnight at the Duchess Theatre.

Contrary to the 2004 revival, the show featured largely the original 1979 album tracks, with a few lyric amendments, plus the song &quot;The Last Man in My Life&quot;, written for the show&#x27;s incarnation as &quot;Song and Dance&quot; in 1982. The production came about after Webb met a commissioning editor for BBC Radio 2 at a concert honouring Don Black in late 2013 at which she&#x27;d performed two songs from the piece. Asked whether she could still do the whole show, she suggested that, with a small band, it could be recorded for radio broadcast. The producer Robert Mackintosh then suggested a week&#x27;s run prior to the recording, the popularity of which led to another three weeks at a second theatre. The recording was broadcast on BBC Radio 2, alongside an interview with Lloyd Webber and Black conducted by Anneka Rice.

Webb later performed the show for two nights at the Kenton Theatre, Henley-on-Thames, in September 2015.

====Work with Don Black====
At the meal to discuss the &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; project, Lloyd Webber asked Don Black, who had maintained parallel careers as a lyricist and as the manager to Matt Monro, to become Webb&#x27;s personal manager, a role he undertook from 1979 until the early 1990s, when he became too busy with work on &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. He found her a new manager and they&#x27;ve remained close: &quot;Uncle Don and Auntie Shirl have always been there for me.&quot;

During 1981 and 1982, Webb recorded her next album, &quot;I&#x27;m Not That Kind of Girl&quot;, which was eventually released in 1983. Although not based on a musical, the album had a running story concerning a woman who is reunited with a former lover. The album culminates with her on the way to their wedding. The songs were composed by David Hentschel and Don Black and were very much in a contemporary pop vein. Phil Collins played drums on the album and Kiki Dee contributed backing vocals. Despite the album&#x27;s strong pedigree in terms of personnel, it failed to chart and was Webb&#x27;s final album on the Polydor label.

In 1985 she scored her next big hit when she recorded a cover version of Black&#x27;s song, &quot;Ben&quot;, which had been originally released by Michael Jackson. It was produced in memory of Ben Hardwick, who died shortly after becoming Britain&#x27;s youngest liver transplant patient and whose story was publicised on the BBC television programme &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;. Andrew Lloyd Webber saw the show and suggested the idea of a charity recording to Black, who mentioned that Webb was recording an album at the time. The single reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart and was included on her 1985 album, &quot;Encore&quot;. 

In 1986, Black wrote lyrics to the theme of the BBC television drama &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot; and the single &quot;Always There&quot; was the result, produced by its composers Simon May and Leslie Osbourne. It became a UK top-20 hit and inspired an album of the same name in which she covered other television themes. The album, which peaked at No. 65 in the UK Albums Chart, was later released on compact disc entitled &quot;Marti Webb Sings Small Screen Themes&quot;. The previous year, Webb had recorded the theme to the ITV television series &quot;To Have and To Hold&quot;, but for contractual reasons, the theme was re-recorded and released by the composer Johnny Worth&#x27;s wife Catherine Stock. Webb, herself, re-recorded it for the &quot;Always There&quot; album.

She presented a BBC Radio 2 documentary about the career of Don Black that was broadcast in early 1995, appeared in a concert tribute to him on his 70th birthday that was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 in August 2008, performed at a BBC Electric Proms event with the lyricist in October 2009 and sang two songs during another concert tribute in 2013.

====Later career====
In 1982 &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; was combined with Lloyd Webber&#x27;s other successful album &quot;Variations&quot;, which had featured his brother, cellist Julian Lloyd Webber, to create the show &quot;Song and Dance.&quot; The first act saw Webb reprise her role as the unnamed girl, a performance for which she was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award. In the second act Wayne Sleep and a dance troupe performed choreographed routines to the music from &quot;Variations&quot;. The pair toured with the show in the latter half of the decade.

In the mid 1980s, she again succeeded Elaine Paige, as Grizabella in the musical &quot;Cats&quot; both in the West End production at the New London Theatre and subsequently on a UK tour. A commemorative roll of honour, marking a century of the Blackpool Opera House, lists significant performers at the theatre between 1889 and 1989, beginning with Wilson Barnett and ending with Webb, due to her time with the show there.

In 1983, alongside Sarah Brightman and Gary Bond, Webb appeared in an early workshop version of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Aspects of Love&quot; at his Sydmonton Festival.

In 1995, at the age of 50, Webb reprised her leading role in a UK tour of &quot;Evita&quot;, opposite Chris Corcoran as Che and Duncan Smith as Peron. Despite some criticism over her age, the popularity of the tour, produced by Robert Stigwood and David Land with the orchestrations, stage design and direction of the original 1978 London production, led to it being extended throughout 1996. The beginning of the tour also saw the release of an album entitled &quot;Music and Songs from Evita&quot; as part of Pickwick Records&#x27; &quot;The Shows Collection&quot; series to which Webb contributed a number of tracks.

Between July and September 1997, Webb appeared in &quot;Divorce Me, Darling&quot;, the sequel to &quot;The Boyfriend&quot;, at the Chichester Festival Theatre. The cast also included her former husband Tim Flavin.

In 2003, she joined the UK touring production of &quot;The King and I&quot;, taking over from Stefanie Powers in the role of Anna Leonowens opposite Ronobir Lahiri as The King. Elaine Paige, Webb&#x27;s predecessor in &quot;Evita&quot; and &quot;Cats&quot; had appeared in the London version of the production three years earlier. Later in 2003, she appeared in the original London stage production of &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; uniquely alternating the role of Mrs Meers with Maureen Lipman, to allow Lipman to care for her terminally ill husband, the English playwright Jack Rosenthal.

At the beginning of the following year, she again reprised her role in &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot;, first for a limited run before the closure of the show in the West End and subsequently on tour. The show had been substantially rewritten for a production starring Denise Van Outen, but a combination of the new and original scores was created specifically for Webb. She appeared in many of the principal venues on the tour, but in other locations the show was performed by Faye Tozer and Patsy Palmer.

In 2007, Webb performed alongside Sheila Ferguson and Rula Lenska in a UK touring production of &quot;Hot Flush&quot;, a new musical about the menopause. She played Helen, a middle-aged widow whose daughter had recently left home. She also appeared on Elaine Paige on Sunday, a show on BBC Radio 2, during which she selected a number of &#x27;Essential Musicals&#x27;.

From September to December 2008, she appeared as Mrs Johnstone in the long-running UK tour of Willy Russell&#x27;s musical &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, succeeding Linda Nolan who left due to illness. The producer of the show, Bill Kenwright had been trying to persuade Webb to play the role for around 20 years and she was only free by chance. As Nolan was ill, she had just a week and a half to rehearse, around half the time normally expected for the rehearsal of such a tour. Birmingham-born Niki Evans was playing the role in the West End at the time, so while the tour visited Birmingham, Webb briefly took over in the London production to allow Evans to play her home city.

Webb starred as Aunt Eller in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, touring the UK throughout 2011. Mark Evans, who had previously appeared in the BBC show , played Curly.

Throughout 2012 Webb appeared as Dorothy Brock, a past-her-prime Prima Donna in a UK tour of &quot;42nd Street&quot;. Dave Willetts and Bruce Montague also toured with the cast.

==== Recent work ====
In 2017, she played Jacqueline in the first UK tour of the musical &quot;La Cage Aux Folles&quot; opposite John Partridge and Adrian Zmed, produced by Bill Kenwright.

In July and August 2018, Webb appeared opposite Tommy Steele in &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; at the London Coliseum.

From January until August 2020, Webb was to have toured with the play &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot;. It was curtailed by the industry-wide shutdown of performances as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and relaunched in 2021.

In March 2022, she performed in &quot;The Unexpected Guest&quot;, as part of the Theatre Royal, Windsor&#x27;s On Air season, which featured semi-staged productions of radio plays. In 2023, she appeared in &quot;A Murder Has Been Arranged&quot; and &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, as part of the same series.

From August to December 2023, she appeared as Celia in a UK tour of &quot;Calendar Girls the Musical&quot;. The production featured a revised score and book and was one of the last shows to be produced by Bill Kenwright.

=== Pantomime ===
Webb has spent many Christmas seasons in pantomime in venues throughout the UK. She was the Principal Boy, Robin Hood, in the 1987 London Palladium pantomime, &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;, alongside Cannon and Ball, John Inman and Barbara Windsor. During her later career, she has played the Fairy Godmother or Wicked Queen characters. In 1997, she was a late replacement for Linda Robson in Cinderella in Croydon, when Robson became ill. She appeared in productions of Cinderella in Bath in 2000 and Malvern in 2001. In 2006 she played the Fairy Godmother in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; at Theatre Royal, Windsor. 

In 2018, Webb joined the cast of &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Windsor, to play Fairy Bowbells, for the early part of the show&#x27;s run. Anita Harris, who had originally been cast in the role, covered for Anne Hegerty&#x27;s Queen Rat while the latter took part in &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; Upon Hegerty&#x27;s return to the UK, Harris resumed the role of the fairy. She returned to the Theatre Royal, Windsor, from November 2019 until January 2020, to perform in the pantomime &quot;Aladdin&quot;, alongside Paul Nicholas.

=== Concert work ===
After completing her run in the London production of Evita, Webb and Gary Bond played a series of concerts featuring Lloyd Webber&#x27;s music. She has since regularly performed in concert alongside her appearances in musicals. She also performed a solo concert at the Warrington Festival in 1985. In 1993, she appeared opposite Michael Barrymore in a summer season at Blackpool Opera House.

Webb co-devised and starred in &quot;The Magic of the Musicals&quot;, a UK concert tour featuring songs from musical theatre, opposite &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; winner Mark Rattray. The show toured twice in 1991, before two follow up tours in 1992. The gold-selling album of the show was co-produced by Webb&#x27;s former husband, sound engineer, Tom Button and her outfits designed by Bruce Oldfield. A performance at the Bristol Hippodrome was also filmed and broadcast on BBC Television. This was followed in 1993 by a North American and Canadian tour and numerous UK versions in the following years. In 1999 Dave Willetts was the co-star, followed by Robert Meadmore in 2002. Webb and Meadmore were joined by Wayne Sleep in 2006.

A live recording of her season of cabaret performances with broadcaster David Jacobs at London&#x27;s Café Royal was released in 1998 as &quot;Marti Webb Sings Gershwin: The Love Songs&quot;. Featuring material from her earlier &quot;Gershwin&quot; recording, the album was co-produced by Webb and West End sound designer Mick Potter.

She has performed her cabaret show on a number of P&amp;O cruise ships, including the MV Arcadia in 2009 and 2010.

In 2016, Webb gave a series of solo concerts. She also performed at &quot;These Are a Few of My Favourite Songs: with Don Black&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall.

From 2016 onwards, Webb has performed a number of cabaret concerts at The Pheasantry, London, including &quot;Dreams Lost, Dreams Found&quot;, a show in which she performed a mixture of the songs with which she is closely associated and those from shows that she did not have the opportunity to appear in. In January 2021, she performed the concerts in Malvern.

=== Television ===
Particularly since coming to fame through &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot;, Webb has regularly performed on British television. In the 70s and 80s she appeared on the BBC TV show, &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, on one occasion performing the song &quot;Sing Us One of the Old Songs, George&quot;, a piece which became her own for the show. Prior to her performance in &quot;Evita&quot;, though, she appeared in the television series &quot;The Songwriters&quot;, about songwriting partnerships. The final episode of the series featured Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice and she first met the pair, briefly, while recording the programme.

In 1982, Webb recorded a second television special, &quot;Marti Webb: Together Again&quot;, which was broadcast on BBC Two. It also featured David Essex, Christopher Gable and Angela Richards.

===Recording===
Webb is often thought to have been a one-hit wonder as the success of &quot;Take That Look Off Your Face&quot; has been much more widespread than much of her other work. However, after &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot;, she recorded a number of solo albums, including some live work, and more recently &quot;Limelight&quot; featuring a mix of her best known material and then latest productions.

As well as the charity recording of &quot;Ben&quot; in 1985, Webb also contributed to a recording of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; in 1987, which was released in aid of those killed in the Hungerford massacre.

In summer 1987, she released &quot;Gershwin&quot; on BBC Records, to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of George Gershwin&#x27;s death.

In 1990, on the last studio collaboration between Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson, the album &quot;Freudiana&quot;, Webb performed two songs: the solo &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Moment Pass&quot; and &quot;No One Can Love You Better Than Me&quot; in which she joined forces with Woolfson, Gary Howard and Kiki Dee. She also performed background vocals on the album&#x27;s closing number, &quot;There But for the Grace of God Go I.&quot;

=== Technique ===
Webb is unusual among musical theatre performers in that she never warms up her voice prior to a performance. She has said she wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a technique for other performers. She tries to eat sensibly and dislikes spending time in air-conditioned environments as they dry out the throat. The line in &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot;, &quot;I long to find a drink that hasn&#x27;t got an ice cube in it,&quot; was included by Don Black in reference to Webb&#x27;s genuine dislike.

==Personal life==
Webb married three times and does not have any children. She was married to the actor Alexander Balfour in London in early 1964, but this later ended in divorce.

She married actor Tim Flavin in New York in April 1985 after a courtship of just two weeks but he had a number of affairs during their marriage which ended in divorce in 1986.

She subsequently married sound engineer Tom Button, some two decades her junior, in New York in January 1992. The couple, who met working on a production of &quot;Cats&quot; in Blackpool in 1989&quot;,&quot; separated some years later.

A keen gardener, during the 1980s, she had a house in Fulham, South West London and a country home in Chichester, West Sussex. She then kept an apartment in Westminster, London, for many years. Since the early 1990s, she has lived in a cottage in Langport, Somerset, which she shared with her mother, Selina, before her death. During the 1970s, she owned a 1967 Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow. Webb was at one time a patron of The Players Music Hall Theatre in London, which specialises in Victorian variety theatre.

Webb appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in May 1982. She selected the &quot;Piano Concerto No.1 in B Flat Minor&quot; by Tchaikovsky; &quot;Una voce poco va&quot; from &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;; &quot;The Swan&quot; from &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot;; &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot; by the Edwin Hawkins Singers; &quot;Layla&quot; by Derek and the Dominos; &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; by Simon &amp; Garfunkel; and &quot;Space Oddity&quot; by David Bowie. Her favourite selection was a recording of &quot;The Dreaded Batter Pudding Hurler of Bexhill-on-Sea&quot; from &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. She also chose to take an illustrated dictionary and piano to her imaginary island.

In early 2014, she said that she had been treated for an aggressive form of bowel cancer in 2006, just a month after the death of her mother. The illness was not made public at the time and in fact Webb returned to the stage, including dancing in a pantomime, just two months after major surgery.

In a 2016 interview, she described herself as being semi-retired.

<doc id="606148" wikidata="Q7440470" url="?curid=606148" title="Seaguy">
<text>Seaguy is a three-volume comic book miniseries written by Grant Morrison with art by Cameron Stewart and published by the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics. The first volume of &quot;Seaguy&quot; was released in three issues beginning on May 19, 2004. The second volume, &quot;Slaves of Mickey Eye&quot;, was released in three issues beginning on April 1, 2009. The third and final volume, &quot;Seaguy Eternal&quot;, is yet to be published.

The story revolves around Seaguy, an unpowered superhero in a scuba suit, and his best friend and sidekick Chubby Da Choona, a talking, cigar-smoking tuna.

==Publication history==
Morrison has expressed on various occasions that Seaguy represents a deliberate effort to move away from conventions of the current era of comics: &quot;I had the idea to develop Seaguy into a weapon I could use to fight back against the trendy and unconvincing &#x27;bad-ass&#x27; cynicism of current comics, most of which are produced by the most un-&#x27;bad-ass&#x27; men you can possibly imagine&quot;. Morrison believes that in this fashion the work represents a new vanguard in the development of comics. Morrison expressed similar sentiments about &quot;Zenith&quot;, one of the earliest series they worked on, when they said that it &quot;was a reaction against torment superheroes&quot;.

&quot;Seaguy&quot; was planned as a trilogy, the second and third volumes were to be entitled &quot;The Slaves of Mickey Eye&quot; and &quot;Seaguy Eternal&quot; respectively, but due to the lower-than-expected sales of the comic, it was thought that the sequels were unlikely to be published. In 2006, a fan reported to a comics rumor column that Morrison was holding DC Comics&#x27; &quot;52&quot; weekly limited series for ransom. They reportedly offered to help write the series as long as they allowed him to go forward on the &quot;Seaguy&quot; sequel.

In April 2008, Morrison said that both sequels would go ahead and gave an overview of the ideas they have about the different parts:

The first sequel, &quot;Seaguy: The Slaves of Mickey Eye&quot;, was released on April 1, 2009 by DC Comics/Vertigo.

Morrison has expanded on the broader themes:

==Plot==
Seaguy is a super-hero who has never really had an adventure and spends his days in New Venice playing chess with Death, watching &quot;Mickey Eye&quot; (a cartoon show about an all-seeing, all-knowing, psychopathic eye, and an obvious spoof on Mickey Mouse) and going to the Mickey Eye amusement park. He constantly expresses his wish to go on adventures and impress a beautiful bearded warrior woman named She-Beard, but he never seems to get around to it because he&#x27;s told the world doesn&#x27;t need heroes anymore. However, when Seaguy and Chubby discover that a new food staple called Xoo is sentient, they decide to protect it from evil forces and bring it home.

Seaguy exists in a seemingly perfect world in which all the super-heroes no longer save lives or do much of anything except ride the rides at the Mickey Eye amusement park. It is public knowledge that all the evil in the world was finally destroyed after a powerful entity called the Anti-Dad was destroyed by all the super-heroes, effectively leaving the heroes without jobs. The style of the book is equal parts dark tragedy and light-hearted whimsy as the main character travels from one adventure to the other, but with each adventure becoming more tragic than the one before it, until Seaguy discovers the secret history of the moon.

==Collected editions==
The first volume has been collected into a trade paperback:
* &quot;Seaguy&quot; (104 pages, 2005, )

<doc id="606149" wikidata="Q285842" url="?curid=606149" title="Meso compound">
<text>A meso compound ormeso isomer is an optically inactive isomer in a set of stereoisomers, at least two of which are optically active. This means that despite containing two or more stereocenters, the molecule is not chiral. A meso compound is superposable on its mirror image (not to be confused with superimposable, as any two objects can be superimposed over one another regardless of whether they are the same). Two objects can be superposed if all aspects of the objects coincide and it does not produce a &quot;(+)&quot; or &quot;(-)&quot; reading when analyzed with a polarimeter. The name is derived from the Greek &quot;mésos&quot; meaning “middle”.

For example, tartaric acid can exist as any of three stereoisomers depicted below in a Fischer projection. Of the four colored pictures at the top of the diagram, the first two represent the meso compound (the 2&quot;R&quot;,3&quot;S&quot; and 2&quot;S&quot;,3&quot;R&quot; isomers are equivalent), followed by the optically active pair of levotartaric acid (L-(&quot;R,R&quot;)-(+)-tartaric acid) and dextrotartaric acid (D-(&quot;S,S&quot;)-(-)-tartaric acid). The meso compound is bisected by an internal plane of symmetry that is not present for the non-meso isomers (indicated by an X). That is, on reflecting the meso compound through a mirror plane perpendicular to the screen, the same stereochemistry is obtained; this is not the case for the non-meso tartaric acid, which generates the other enantiomer. The meso compound must not be confused with a 50:50 racemic mixture of the two optically-active compounds, although neither will rotate light in a polarimeter. 

It is a requirement for two of the stereocenters in a meso compound to have at least two substituents in common (although having this characteristic does not necessarily mean that the compound is meso). For example, in 2,4-pentanediol, both the second and fourth carbon atoms, which are stereocenters, have all four substituents in common. 

Since a meso isomer has a superposable mirror image, a compound with a total of &quot;n&quot; chiral centers cannot attain the theoretical maximum of 2&quot;n&quot; stereoisomers if one of the stereoisomers is meso.

A meso isomer need not have a mirror plane. It may have an inversion or a rotoreflexion symmetry such as S. For example, there are two meso isomers of 1,4-difluoro-2,5-dichlorocyclohexane but neither has a mirror plane, and there are two meso isomers of 1,2,3,4-tetrafluorospiropentane (see figure).

==Cyclic meso compounds==
1,2-substituted cyclopropane has a meso cis-isomer (molecule has a mirror plane) and two trans-enantiomers:

The two cis stereoisomers of 1,2-substituted cyclohexanes behave like meso compounds at room temperature in most cases. At room temperature, most 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexanes undergo rapid ring flipping (exceptions being rings with bulky substituents), and as a result, the two cis stereoisomers behave chemically identically with chiral reagents. At low temperatures, however, this is not the case, as the activation energy for the ring-flip cannot be overcome, and they therefore behave like enantiomers. Also noteworthy is the fact that when a cyclohexane undergoes a ring flip, the absolute configurations of the stereocenters do not change.

<text>Juan Bautista (de) Pomar (c. 1535 – after 1601) was a mestizo descendant of the rulers of prehispanic Texcoco, a historian and writer on prehispanic Aztec history. He is the author of two major works. His Relación de Texcoco was written in response to the Relación geográfica ca.1580.

According to references by Fray Juan de Torquemada, he was born around 1535 at Texcoco. He was the great grandson of Nezahualcoyotl, and was of mixed indigenous and Spanish heritage on his father&#x27;s side. Considered noble by the Spaniards, he was able to obtain one of his great-grandfather&#x27;s royal houses, known as the Nezahualcoyotl, in Texcoco.

Pomar was raised as a Christian but learned Aztec tradition from his mother. He was bilingual and spoke and wrote in both Spanish and the native language of the Aztecs, Nahuatl. He is credited with one of the most important compilations of Nahuatl poetry, &quot;Romances de los señores de Nueva España&quot;.

Pomar&#x27;s major work includes an account of the Aztecs and Tlatelolcas &quot;Relación de Juan Bautista Pomar&quot; completed in 1582. He interviewed aged Nahuas, who recounted memory of the older and lost customs of their people. His account, written at the suggestion of the protomedic of Philip II of Spain, complements with the works of Bernardino de Sahagún and Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitl.

<doc id="606155" wikidata="Q4115119" url="?curid=606155" title="Attention span">
<text>Attention span is the amount of time spent concentrating on a task before becoming distracted. Distractibility occurs when attention is uncontrollably diverted to another activity or sensation. &quot;Attention training&quot; is said to be part of education, particularly in the way students are trained to remain focused on a topic of discussion for extended periods, developing listening and analytical skills in the process.

== By age ==
Measuring humans’ estimated attention span depends on what the attention is being used for. The terms “transient attention” and “selective sustained attention” are used to separate short term and focused attention. Transient attention is a short-term response to a stimulus that temporarily attracts or distracts attention. Researchers disagree on the exact amount of the human transient attention span, whereas selective sustained attention, also known as focused attention, is the level of attention that produces consistent results on a task over time. Common estimates of the attention span of healthy teenagers and adults range 5 hours. This is possible because people can choose repeatedly to re-focus on the same thing. This ability to renew attention permits people to &#x27;pay attention&#x27; to things that last for more than a few minutes, such as lengthy films.

Older children are capable of longer periods of attention than younger children.

For time-on-task measurements, the type of activity used in the test affects the results, as people are generally capable of a longer attention span when they are doing something that they find enjoyable or intrinsically motivating. Attention is also increased if the person is able to perform the task fluently, compared to a person who has difficulty performing the task, or to the same person when they are just learning the task. Fatigue, hunger, noise, and emotional stress reduce the time focused on the task.

A research study that consisted of 10,430 males and females ages 10 to 70 observed sustained attention time across a lifespan. The study required participants to use a cognitive testing website where data was gathered for seven months. The data collected from the study concluded that attention span is not one singular linear equation; at age 15 it is recorded that attention-span-related abilities diverge. Over the course of the study, collected evidence additionally found that, in humans, attention span is at its highest level when a person is in their early 40s, then gradually declines in old age.

==Measurement==
Many different tests on attention span have been used in different populations and in different times. Some tests measure short-term, focused attention abilities (which is typically below normal in people with ADHD), and others provide information about how easily distracted the test-taker is (typically a significant problem in people with ADHD). Tests like the DeGangi&#x27;s &quot;Test of Attention in Infants&quot; (TAI) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV) are commonly used to assess attention-related issues in young children when interviews and observations are inadequate. Older tests, like the Continuous Performance Test and the Porteus Maze Test, have been rejected by some experts. These tests are typically criticized as not actually measuring attention, being inappropriate for some populations, or not providing clinically useful information.

Variability in test scores can be produced by small changes in the testing environment. For example, test-takers will usually remain on task for longer periods of time if the examiner is visibly present in the room than if the examiner is absent.

== Testing ==
In an early study of the influence of temperament on attention span, the mothers of 232 pairs of twins were interviewed periodically about the similarities and differences in behavior displayed by their twins during infancy and early childhood. The results showed that each of the behavioral variables (temper frequency, temper intensity, irritability, crying, and demanding attention) had a significant inverse relationship with attention span. In other words, the twin with longer attention span was better able to remain performing a particular activity without distraction, and was also the less temperamental twin.

One study of 2600 children found that early exposure to television (around age two) is associated with later attention problems such as inattention, impulsiveness, disorganization, and distractibility at age seven. This correlational study does not specify whether viewing television increases attention problems in children, or if children who are naturally prone to inattention are disproportionately attracted to the stimulation of television at young ages, or if there is some other factor, such as parenting skills, associated with this finding.

Another study examining the relations between children’s attention span-persistence in preschool and later academic achievements found that children’s age four attention span-persistence significantly predicted math and reading achievement at age 21 after controlling for achievement levels at age seven, adopted status, child vocabulary skills, gender, and maternal education level. For instance, children who enrolled in formal schooling without the ability to pay attention, remember instructions, and demonstrate self-control have more difficulty in elementary school and throughout high school.

In another study involving 10,000 children (ages eight to 11), fluctuations in attention span were observed during the school day, with higher levels of attention in the afternoon and lower levels in the morning. The study also found that student awareness and productivity increased after a two-day weekend but substantially decreased after summer break.

<text>Franz Artur Viehböck (born 24 August 1960 in Vienna) is an Austrian electrical engineer and cosmonaut, who became the first Austrian to fly in space. He visited the Mir space station in 1991 aboard Soyuz TM-13, returning aboard Soyuz TM-12 after spending just over a week in space.

==Career==

Together with Clemens Lothaller, he was selected for the Soviet-Austrian space project &quot;Austromir 91&quot;. After two years of training he was chosen for the mission, and launched on 2 October 1991 together with the Russian cosmonauts Alexander A. Volkov and the Kazakh Toktar Aubakirov in Soyuz TM-13 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome spaceport.

At the Mir space station he conducted 15 experiments in the fields of space medicine, physics, and space technology, together with the cosmonauts Anatoly Artsebarsky and Sergey Krikalev. Viehböck returned after 7 days and 22 hours with Soyuz TM-12, and landed in Kazakhstan on 10 October.

The following two years he gave numerous lectures on the mission, then went to the United States and worked for Rockwell. When Rockwell was taken over by Boeing he became Director for International Business Development in Vienna. Later he was assigned &quot;Technologiebeauftragter&quot; (technology coordinator) of Lower Austria.

Viehböck resides in Berndorf, Lower Austria. He is married, with his daughter Carina being born during his space mission. Only two other space travellers became parents while on orbit: Mike Fincke and Randolph Bresnik (NASA).

<doc id="606159" wikidata="Q7370388" url="?curid=606159" title="Roth v. United States">
<text>Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957), along with its companion case Alberts v. California, was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which redefined the constitutional test for determining what constitutes obscene material unprotected by the First Amendment. The Court, in an opinion by Justice William J. Brennan Jr. created a test to determine what constituted obscene material: Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the material appeals to a prurient interest in sex, and whether the material was utterly without redeeming social value. Although the Court upheld Roth’s conviction and allowed some obscenity prosecutions, it drastically loosened obscenity laws. The decision dissatisfied both social conservatives who thought that it had gone too far in tolerating sexual imagery, and liberals who felt that it infringed on the rights of consenting adults.

The decision was modified by &quot;Miller v. California&quot; which removed the &quot;utterly without redeeming social value&quot; test, and replaced it with without &quot;serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value&quot;. In that case, Justice Brennan dissented, repudiating his previous position in &quot;Roth&quot;, arguing that states could not ban the sale, advertisement, or distribution of obscene materials to consenting adults.

== Prior history ==
Under the common law rule that prevailed before &quot;Roth&quot;, articulated most famously in the 1868 English case &quot;Regina v Hicklin&quot;, any material that tended to &quot;deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences&quot; was deemed &quot;obscene&quot; and could be banned on that basis. Thus, works by Balzac, Flaubert, James Joyce and D. H. Lawrence were banned based on isolated passages and the effect they might have on children.

Samuel Roth, who ran an adult book-selling business in New York City, was convicted under a federal statute criminalizing the sending of &quot;obscene, lewd, lascivious or filthy&quot; materials through the mail for advertising and selling a publication called &quot;American Aphrodite&quot; (&quot;A Quarterly for the Fancy-Free&quot;) containing literary erotica and nude photography. David Alberts, who ran a mail-order business from Los Angeles, was convicted under a California statute for selling lewd and obscene books. The Court granted &quot;certiorari&quot; and affirmed both convictions.

== Ruling ==
&quot;Roth&quot; came down as a 6–3 decision, with the opinion of the Court authored by William J. Brennan Jr. The Court repudiated the &quot;Hicklin&quot; test and defined obscenity more strictly, as material whose &quot;dominant theme taken as a whole appeals to the interest&quot; of the &quot;average person, applying contemporary community standards.&quot; Only material meeting this test could be banned as &quot;obscene.&quot; However, Brennan reaffirmed that obscenity was not protected by the First Amendment and thus upheld the convictions of Roth and Alberts for publishing and sending obscene material through the mail.

Congress could ban material, &quot;utterly without redeeming social importance,&quot; or in other words, &quot;whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest.&quot;

Chief Justice Earl Warren worried that &quot;broad language used here may eventually be applied to the arts and sciences and freedom of communication generally,&quot; but, agreeing that obscenity is not constitutionally protected, concurred only in the judgment.

Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas, First Amendment &quot;literalists,&quot; dissented in &quot;Roth&quot;, arguing vigorously that the First Amendment protected obscene material.

Justice John Marshall Harlan II dissented in &quot;Roth&quot;, involving a federal statute, but concurred in &quot;Alberts&quot;, involving a state law, on the grounds that while states had broad power to prosecute obscenity, the federal government did not.

== Legacy ==

In &quot;Memoirs v. Massachusetts&quot; (1966), a plurality of the Court further redefined the &quot;Roth&quot; test by holding unprotected only that which is &quot;patently offensive&quot; and &quot;utterly without redeeming social value,&quot; but no opinion in that case could command a majority of the Court either, and the state of the law in the obscenity field remained confused.

Pornography and sexually oriented publications proliferated as a result of the Warren Court&#x27;s holdings, the &quot;Sexual Revolution&quot; of the 1960s flowered, and pressure increasingly came on the Court to allow leeway for state and local governments to crack down on obscenity. During his ill-fated bid to become Chief Justice, Justice Abe Fortas was attacked vigorously in Congress by conservatives such as Strom Thurmond for siding with the Warren Court majority in liberalizing protection for pornography. In his 1968 presidential campaign, Richard Nixon campaigned against the Warren Court, pledging to appoint &quot;strict constructionists&quot; to the Supreme Court.

In &quot;Miller v. California&quot; (1973), a five-person majority agreed for the first time since &quot;Roth&quot; as to a test for determining constitutionally unprotected obscenity, thereby replacing the &quot;Roth&quot; test. By the time &quot;Miller&quot; was considered in 1973, Justice Brennan had abandoned the &quot;Roth&quot; test and argued that &quot;no formulation of this Court, the Congress, or the States can adequately distinguish obscene material unprotected by the First Amendment from protected expression.&quot;

<text>Carantanians (, ) were a Slavic people of the Early Middle Ages (Latin: , or &quot;Slavs called Carantanians&quot;), living in the principality of Carantania, later known as Carinthia, which covered present-day southern Austria and parts of Slovenia. They are considered ancestors of modern Slovenes, particularly Carinthian Slovenes.

In the High Middle Ages, the term Carantanians and Carinthians were used interchangeably and denoted both the inhabitants of the bilingual Slavic-German Duchy of Carinthia, as well as South Slavs living within the borders of the Holy Roman Empire (that is, the ancestors of present-day Slovenes and Istrian Croats).

== Historical background ==
After the disintegration of Samo&#x27;s realm, Alpine Slavs established the Principality of Carantania in the Eastern Alps, which was independent from around 660 to around 745, when it fell under the Bavarian zone of influence and was later incorporated in the Frankish Empire. The formation of the principality and a period of peace made possible the emergence in the 8th century of so-called Carantanian culture. Until around 820, it was ruled as a semi-independent tribal polity. After the anti-Frankish rebellion of Ljudevit Posavski, which was partially supported by Carantanians, the Carantanian principality was transformed into a Frankish march, and later emerged as the feudal Duchy of Carinthia. In the 10th century the Carantanians were significantly influenced by the Bijelo Brdo culture of the Pannonian Slavs.

Carantanians were the first Slavic people to accept Christianity from the West. They were mostly Christianized by Irish missionaries sent by the Archdiocese of Salzburg, among them Modestus, known as the &quot;Apostle of Carantanians&quot;. This process was later described in the memorandum known as the &quot;Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum&quot;, which is thought to have over-emphasized the role of the Church of Salzburg in the Christianization process over similar efforts of the Patriarchate of Aquileia. Several rebellions of the Carantanians against the Christianisations occurred in the late 8th century, which later served as the source of inspiration of the Slovenian Romantic poet France Prešeren in his epic-lyric poem &quot;The Baptism on the Savica&quot;. They were also mentioned in &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; from the 12th century, which alongside other historical sources and archaeological culture, indicates there were perceived as a well-formed Slavic ethnic group. However, with the loss of their independence, their name by the end of the 9th century lost ethnic meaning in favor of the territorial community. Part of them became Germanized and Romanized, while the remaining descendants who preserved their Slavic identity and language are known today as Slovenes.

== Language ==
Little is known of the language of the Carantanians, but it can be supposed that it was still very close to Proto-Slavic. Slovenian linguists have sometimes provisionally called it &quot;Alpine Slavic&quot; (&quot;alpska slovanščina&quot;). The Pre-Slavic toponyms, adopted and Slavicized by the Carantanians, as well as Bavarian records of Alpine Slavic names both help to shed light on the characteristics of the Alpine Slavic language. They were more connected to the West Slavic tribes than the South Slavic tribes according to their preserved characteristics from Proto-Slavic.

From the 8th century onwards the Alpine Slavic language underwent a series of gradual changes and innovations characteristic of South Slavic languages. By roughly the 13th century, Slovene emerged from these innovations.

The Freising Manuscripts, dating from the 10th century, which most surely originate from the region inhabited by the Carantanians, are considered to be the oldest documents in any Slavic language written in Latin alphabet. While still retaining many Proto-Slavic features, the language of the Freising manuscripts already exhibits certain developments characteristic of early Slovene. These texts are considered to be written in a transitional language between Alpine Slavic and modern Slovene.

== Traditions and social organization ==
Not much is known about the social and political organization of the Carantanians. Most probably, they were organized in communal entities known as &quot;župas&quot;. A distinct social stratus known as &quot;kosezes&quot; (&quot;Kasazes&quot; in Latin, in German &quot;Edlinger&quot;, noble people), which were present also in other parts of the Slovene Lands until the High Middle Ages, is thought of having derived from the private army of the Carantanian prince. Medieval documents mention that the people freely elected their leader, but it remains unclear what social category the Medieval Latin name &quot;populus&quot; exactly referred to.

A plaque in Cleveland recognizes that this ritual may have influenced the American Revolution. Thomas Jefferson had initialed a page in his copy of Jean Bodin’s “Republic” describing the unique process of Carantanian commoners having the power of choosing their leader, resembling modern democratic values.

Several traditions, typical of the Carantanians, survived until the end of the Middle Ages, most notably the installation of the dukes of Carinthia, which was carried out until 1414.

<doc id="606167" wikidata="Q11888737" url="?curid=606167" title="Porsche Boxster (986)">
<text>The Porsche 986 is the internal designation for the first generation Boxster, a mid-engine two-seater roadster built by German automobile manufacturer Porsche. Introduced in late 1996, the Boxster, based on the 1993 Boxster Concept, was Porsche&#x27;s first road vehicle to be originally designed as a roadster since the 550 Spyder. The Boxster&#x27;s name is derived from the word &quot;boxer&quot;, referring to the vehicle&#x27;s flat or &quot;boxer&quot; engine, and the name &quot;speedster&quot;, first seen on the 356. 
Powered by a 2.5-litre flat six-cylinder engine, the base model was upgraded to a 2.7-litre engine in the year 2000 and a new Boxster S variant was introduced with a 3.2-litre engine. In 2003, styling and engine output was upgraded on both variants. The 986 was succeeded by the 987 which retained the Boxster roadster and added the Cayman fixed-roof coupé body style. 

The 986 stimulated a commercial turnaround for Porsche, which during the early 1990s had been suffering with an ageing product range and falling sales, and it&#x27;s credited with saving the company. The 986 Boxster was Porsche&#x27;s biggest volume seller from its introduction in 1996 until the introduction of the Cayenne sport utility vehicle in 2003. 
==Development==
In October 1991, following a visit to the Tokyo Motor Show, Porsche began to devise solutions to succeed the poor selling 928 and incoming 968 (a heavy update of the 944). In February 1992, Porsche began development of a successor to the 928 (mildly updated for 1992) and recently released the 968.

By June 1992, out of 4 proposals based on dual collaboration between the 986 and 996 (993&#x27;s successor) design teams, a proposal by Grant Larson and Pinky Lai inspired by the 356 Cabriolet, Speedster, and 550 Spyder was chosen by Harm Lagaay.

In August 1992, a decision was made to develop the concept into a show vehicle, in time for the 1993 North American International Auto Show. After garnering widespread acclaim from the press and public upon presentation of the Boxster Concept in January 1993, the final production 986 production exterior design by Larson was frozen in March 1993. However, by the second half of 1993, difficulties arose with fitment of some components, resulting in lengthening of the hood and requiring another design freeze by fourth quarter of that year. Prototypes in 968 bodies were built to test the mid-engine power train of the 986 by the end of 1993, with proper prototypes surfacing in 1994. Pilot production began in the second half of 1995, ahead of series production in mid-1996.

Through consultation with Toyota, Porsche began widely sharing parts among models and slashed costs. The Boxster shares parts with the more expensive 911 (internal designation 996), including the bonnet, front wings, headlights, interior and engine architecture.

Production of the 986 began at the former 928 facility in Stuttgart, Germany in 1996. Valmet Automotive also manufactured Boxsters under contract to Porsche at a facility in Uusikaupunki, Finland. The cars assembled in Finland have the letter &quot;U&quot; as the 11th character of the VIN instead of the &quot;S&quot; in the German assembled cars.

==Engine==
The 986 Boxster uses the M96, a water-cooled, horizontally opposed (&quot;flat&quot;), six-cylinder engine. It was Porsche&#x27;s first water-cooled non-front engine. In the Boxster, it is placed mid-engine, while in the 911, the traditional rear-engine layout is used. The engines used in the Boxster are low displacement versions of the 3.4-litre Flat-6 found in the 996 Carrera. The mid-engine layout provides a low center of gravity, near-perfect weight distribution, and neutral handling. The engines had a number of failures, resulting in cracked or slipped cylinder liners, which were resolved by a minor redesign and better control of the casting process in late 1999. A failure for these early engines was a spate of porous engine blocks, as the manufacturer had difficulty in the casting process. In addition to causing problems with coolant and oil systems mingling fluids, it also resulted in Porsche&#x27;s decision to repair faulty engines by boring out the cast sleeves on the cylinders where defects were noted in production and inserting new sleeves rather than scrapping the engine block. Normally, the cylinder walls are cast at the same time as the rest of the engine, this being the reason for adopting the casting technology.

==Facelift==

The model received a minor facelift in 2002. The plastic rear window was replaced by a smaller glass window with a heating element. The interior received a glove compartment, new electro-mechanical hood and trunk release mechanism (with an electronic emergency release in the fuse box panel) and an updated steering wheel. Porsche installed a reworked exhaust pipe and air intake.

In addition, the front headlight&#x27;s amber &quot;fried egg&quot; indicators were replaced with clear indicators. The rear light cluster was also changed with translucent grey turn signals replacing the amber ones. The side marker lights on the front wings were changed as well from amber to clear, except on American market cars where they remained amber. The bumpers were also changed slightly for a more defined, chiseled appearance, and new wheel designs were made available. 

=== Boxster 986 model history ===

=== Boxster S Special Edition ===

In 2004, the Boxster S Special Edition, also called 550 Spyder Boxster S Special Edition was introduced with a production run of just 1,953 cars (paying homage to the 550 Spyder&#x27;s year of introduction). 500 cars were made for the US Market. These were all painted in GT Silver Metallic, the same colour as the Carrera GT concept presented in 2000, and had unique cocoa-brown full-leather interior as standard with grey natural leather as a no-cost option. Each car also had special interior paintwork, a high-end BOSE sound system, two-tone grey and silver 18 inch Carrera wheels (unpainted as another zero-cost option), wheel spacers, the Boxster S sport exhaust, the M030 option sports suspension, and a plate on the center console piece commonly known as the &quot;batwing&quot; showing the production number. Only on the American market cars were the rear turn signals red rather than clear.

<text>Old Mission is an unincorporated community in Grand Traverse County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located within Peninsula Township, and is located about south of the tip of the Old Mission Peninsula, along the shore of the East Arm of Grand Traverse Bay. As an unincorporated community, Old Mission has no legally defined boundaries or population statistics of its own.

Old Mission is one of the oldest communities in Northern Michigan, and is the oldest permanent settlement in the Grand Traverse Bay region, founded in 1839 by Presbyterian missionary Peter Dougherty. The Old Mission Peninsula today is known largely for its cherry crop, which is also attributed to Dougherty.

In the Treaty of Washington in 1836, the federal government agreed to provide local native tribes, such as the Ojibwe and Odawa, with both a mission and schools for their reservation. Henry Schoolcraft, the Indian agent representing the government, selected a natural harbor on the eastern shore of the peninsula in Grand Traverse Bay for the planned facilities. In 1838, the Presbyterian Board of Missions, sent the Reverend Peter Dougherty (1805–1894) to establish the mission, doing so in 1839. The settlement became known as Grand Traverse, and was given a post office in 1850. In 1852, Dougherty relocated the mission to the Leelanau County community of Omena, originally established as New Mission. In 1869, the Grand Traverse post office was renamed to Old Mission.

The Dougherty Mission House, also known as the Rushmore House and Inn, was built within the community in 1842. The house and surrounding structures currently serve as a museum. The Old Mission Inn, built is 1887, is also a historic structure within Old Mission. The two are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as Michigan State Historic Sites.

The area received its first post office on April 26, 1850, under the name Old Mission. The post office remains in operation and is located at 4007 Swaney Road. Currently, the post office uses the 49673 ZIP Code, which is used for post office box only and has no delivery. The area is served by the Traverse City 49686 ZIP Code.

==Geography==
Old Mission is located just east of M-37 near the tip of Old Mission Peninsula about north of Traverse City. The community was built along Old Mission Harbor, which is a small safe haven along the East Arm of Grand Traverse Bay. The community sits at an elevation of above sea level.

The community is located within an American Viticultural Area and a center of the Michigan wine industry, including the Old Mission Peninsula AVA. Mission Point Light is located slightly north at the northern terminus of M-37. The 45th parallel is slightly north of Old Mission.

==Education==
The area is served by Traverse City Area Public Schools, with high school students in Old Mission zoned to Traverse City Central High School. There are no public schools located on Old Mission Peninsula.

<doc id="606173" wikidata="Q661875" url="?curid=606173" title="Project Artichoke">
<text>Project Artichoke (also referred to as Operation Artichoke) was a project developed and enacted by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the purpose of researching methods of interrogation. Project Artichoke was succeeded by Project MKUltra, which began in 1953.

Initially known as Project Bluebird, Project Artichoke officially arose on August 20, 1951, and was operated by the CIA&#x27;s Office of Scientific Intelligence. The primary goal of Project Artichoke was to determine whether a person could be involuntarily made to perform an act of attempted assassination. The project also studied the effects of mind control and hypnosis, forced addiction to (and subsequent withdrawal from) morphine, and other chemicals, including LSD, to produce amnesia and other vulnerable states in victims.

== Description ==
Project Artichoke was a mind control program that gathered information together with the intelligence divisions of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and FBI. In addition, the scope of the project was outlined in a memo dated January 1952 that asked, &quot;Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self-preservation?&quot;

Project Artichoke was the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s secret code name for carrying out in-house and overseas experiments using LSD, hypnosis and total isolation as forms of physiological harassment for special interrogations on human subjects. At first agents used cocaine, marijuana, heroin, peyote and mescaline, but they increasingly saw LSD as the most promising drug. The subjects who left this project were fogged with amnesia, resulting in faulty and vague memories of the experience. In 1952, unknowing CIA agents were secretly drugged to determine the drug&#x27;s effects on unsuspecting people. One record states that an agent was kept on LSD for 77 days.

Artichoke researched the potential of dengue fever and other diseases. A declassified Artichoke memo read: &quot;Not all viruses have to be lethal… the objective includes those that act as short-term and long-term incapacitating agents.&quot;

The CIA disputed which department would take over the operation. Finally, it was decided that an agent from the CIA research staff, former U.S. Army brigadier general Paul F. Gaynor, would oversee it. The CIA sought to establish control over what it perceived as the &quot;weaker&quot; and &quot;less intelligent&quot; segments of society, or for potential agents, defectors, refugees, prisoners of war and others. A CIA report states that if hypnosis succeeded, assassins could be created to assassinate &quot;a prominent [redacted] politician or if necessary, [an] American official.&quot; The overseas operations took place in locations throughout Europe, Japan, Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Teams were assembled to manage these operations and they were told to &quot;conduct at the overseas bases operational experiments utilizing an alien as a subject.&quot;

<text>The Porsche 911, internally type 993, is the fourth generation of the 911 model of Porsche sports car, manufactured and sold between January 1994 and early 1998 (model years 1995–1998 in the United States), replacing the 911, type 964. Its discontinuation marked the end of air-cooled 911 models.

The 993 was much improved over and quite different from its predecessor. According to Porsche, &quot;every part of the car was designed from the ground up, including the engine&quot; but nevertheless &quot;only 20% of its parts were carried over from the prior 911&quot;. Porsche refers to the 993 as &quot;a significant advance, not just from a technical, but also a visual perspective.&quot;

The external design of the Porsche 993 was penned by English designer Tony Hatter. It retained the core cabin and body shell architecture of the 964 and prior 911 model iterations, but exterior panels were revised with much more flared wheel arches, a smoother front and rear bumper design, an enlarged retractable rear wing, and teardrop shaped mirrors.

Porsche engineered a new light-alloy rear subframe with an entirely new multi-link coil springs and wishbone rear suspension design, dubbed the Weissach axle – making significant progress with the engine&#x27;s impact on the car&#x27;s handling, putting behind the previous lift-off oversteer and providing an improved driving experience and creating a more civilized car overall.

The 993 had several variants, like its predecessors, varying in body style, engines, drivetrains, and included equipment. Engine power was increased by the addition of the VarioRam system, that added particularly in the mid-range of rpms, and also resulted in more throttle-noise at higher revs. The VarioRam system resulted in a 15 percent increase in the new 911&#x27;s engine power over its predecessor. 

The 993&#x27;s available all-wheel drive system replaced the 964&#x27;s centre differential with a viscous coupling, similar to the 959&#x27;s, making the new system significantly lighter. The 993 was also the first 911 to receive a six speed gearbox, which came standard. Rear-wheel drive models remained available with Porsche&#x27;s Tiptronic 4-speed automatic transmission.

A 993 GT2 was used as the safety car during the 1995 Formula One season.

==Overview==

===Technical improvements===
A major change was the implementation of all alloy multilink rear suspension attached to an alloy subframe, a completely new design derived from the 989, a four-door sedan that never went into production. The system later continued in the 993&#x27;s successor, the 996, and required the widening of the rear wheel arches, which gave better stability. The new suspension improved handling, making it more direct, more stable, and helping to reduce the tendency to oversteer if the throttle were lifted during hard cornering, a trait of earlier 911s. It also reduced interior noise and improved ride quality.

The 993 was the first generation of the 911 to have a six-speed manual transmission included as standard; its predecessors had four- or five-speed transmissions. In virtually every situation, keeping the engine at its best torque range above 4,500 rpm was possible. The Carrera, Carrera S, Cabriolet, and Targa models (rear-wheel drive) were available with a &quot;Tiptronic&quot; four-speed automatic transmission, first introduced in the 964. From the 1995 model year, Porsche offered the Tiptronic S with additional steering wheel-mounted controls and refined software for smoother, quicker shifts. Since the 993&#x27;s introduction, the Tiptronic is capable of recognising climbs and descents. The Tiptronic-equipped cars suffer as compared to the manual transmission equipped cars in both acceleration and also top speed, but the differences are not much notable. Tiptronic cars also suffered a increase in weight.

The 993&#x27;s optional all-wheel drive system was refined over that of the 964. Porsche departed from the 964&#x27;s setup consisting of three differentials and revised the system based on the layout from its 959 flagship, replacing the centre differential with a viscous coupling unit. In conjunction with the 993&#x27;s redesigned suspension, this system improved handling characteristics in inclement weather and still retained the stability offered by all-wheel drive without having to suffer as many compromises as the previous all-wheel drive system. Its simpler layout also reduced weight, though the four-wheel drive Carrera 4 weighs more than its rear-wheel drive counterpart (at vs. ).

Other improvements over the 964 include a new dual-flow exhaust system, larger brakes with drilled discs, and a revised power steering.

==Variants==
===Carrera coupé / cabriolet===
The Carrera was available in rear- and all-wheel drive versions. It was equipped with the naturally aspirated 3.6-liter M64 engine, further developed from the 964, and combined with a new dual-flow exhaust system now incorporating two catalytic converters. The 993 Carrera originally was equipped with orange turn indicators on the front, side, and rear, black brake calipers, black Carrera logo on the rear, and 16-inch alloy wheels with black Porsche logos on the center wheelcaps. The 1994 coupé version had a curb weight of (basic unladen weight of ). This model&#x27;s ground clearance was 110 mm, except for the US version, which had a ground clearance of 120 mm. This was further lowered with the M030 sport chassis option to 90 mm. The coupé is the stiffest, tightest, most solid, yet lightest of the 993 models.

The Cabriolet, introduced simultaneously alongside the coupé in April 1994 for the 1995 model year, featured a fully electrical and hand-stitched soft top reinforced with metal sheets and an automatic wind blocker. On the rear of the Cabriolet, a small spoiler was mounted with the third braking light. The 993 Cabriolet was slightly heavier than the coupé variant and has a curb weight of . A high percentage of the total Cabriolets produced ended up in the US. Both the coupé and convertible variants of the 993 were available with all-wheel drive.

Porsche also offered the 993 Carrera as an all-wheel drive version called the Carrera 4. In contrast with the 964, Porsche deleted the &quot;2&quot; from the rear-wheel drive &quot;Carrera&quot; name tag. Among enthusiasts, though, to differentiate between the rear-wheel and all-wheel drive variants of the Type 993 Carrera, they were (and still are) commonly referred to as &quot;C2&quot; and &quot;C4&quot;. The Carrera 4 has an automatic braking differential; it brakes the inner wheel when accelerating out of a corner. On the exterior, the Carrera 4 is visually distinguishable by clear front and side turn indicators and rear red turn indicators. The brake calipers are painted silver, as is the Carrera 4 badge on the engine cover. The center wheel-caps carry the Carrera 4 logo instead of the Porsche crest. The Carrera 4 has a curb weight of , same as the standard Carrera cabriolet, and in both instances more than the Carrera coupé. Key feature on the 993 Carrera 4 is the weight saving in the all-wheel-drive system as compared to the 964, a lower maintenance viscous coupling unit that transfers 5-50% of power to the front wheels and changes the driving behavior of the car compared to the standard Carrera. The 993 Carrera 4 all-wheel drive is suited to cope with bad weather conditions, which provides extra security in rain or snow, though on a dry circuit, the C2 is the faster car, and the C4 is of course heavier than the C2. There was no Tiptronic option available on the Carrera 4.

The options list for the 993 Carrera (and most other variants) offered many choices, including up to five different styles of wheels, various suspension set-ups, and three different seat styles (comfort, sport, racing). In addition, many upholstery options were offered and various sound systems including digital sound processing. Further, customers had the option of any colour other than standard shades. Even more, the Tequipment and Exclusive-Programs added further options and built to order almost any specific wishes of customers such as special consoles, fax machines, or even brightly coloured interior upholstery.

In contrast with most of the other variants, production of the Carrera coupé and Cabriolet ceased with the end of a very small number produced in a shortened 1998 model year.


===Targa===

The Targa version of the 993 was introduced in the 1996 model year and was the debut of the so-called &quot;greenhouse&quot; system - a retractable glass roof, a design continued on the 996 and 997 Targa. The glass roof retracts underneath the rear window, revealing a large opening. This system was a complete redesign, as previous Targa models had a removable roof section and a wide B-pillar functioning as a roll bar. The new glass-roof design allowed the 993 Targa to retain the same side-on profile as the other 911 Carrera variants and finish without the inconvenience of storing the removed top of the old system. The Targa is based on the 993 Carrera cabriolet with the Targa glass roof replacing the fabric roof.

The Targa was equipped with distinctive two-piece wheels, which could be ordered as an option on all cars not having standard wheels. Common problems with the Targa include excessive heat in the cabin, creaking noises on rough roads, and a very complicated and unreliable roof mechanism. In addition, the Targa roof is heavier than the coupé&#x27;s roof, and that extra weight is at the top of the car, raising its center of gravity and decreasing handling performance.

Targa production numbers:

*1996: 2,442 (US+Canada: 462)
*1997: 1,843 (US+Canada: 567)
*1998: 334 (US+Canada: 122)
*Total: 4,619

===Turbo===

The 993 Turbo coupé was introduced in 1995. It featured a new twin-turbocharged engine displacing 3.6 liters and generating a maximum power output of . Air-to-air intercoolers, electronic engine management, redesigned cylinder heads, and other modified engine internals completed the new engine. The 993 Turbo was the first 911 Turbo with all-wheel drive, taken from the 959 flagship model. The Turbo&#x27;s bodywork differs from the Carrera by widened rear wheel arches (about 6 cm), redesigned front and rear bumper moldings, and a fixed &quot;whale tail&quot; rear wing housing the intercoolers. New alloy wheels with hollow spokes were standard.

The 993 Turbo was one of the first production cars in the world to have an OBDII diagnostics system (the 3.8-litre and GT versions did not have that system, and the normally aspirated 993 variants did not receive it until 1996 model year). The successors of the 993 Turbo since have had water-cooled heads. The car also had larger brakes than those on the base Carrera model.

Throughout the production run of the Turbo, two distinct differences existed. The 1997 and 1998 cars had these differences from the 1996 cars:
* Stronger transmission input shafts (a known weakness due to the combination of immense power and AWD system) were used.
* The ECU was able to be flashed and modified (the 1996 model&#x27;s ECU was not modifiable).
* With the addition of a Porsche child seat, the passenger airbag was cut off.
* Motion sensors for the alarm were integrated into the map light above the rear view mirror.
* Standard wheel center caps had &quot;turbo&quot; embedded on them (the 1996 version had Porsche crests).

The Porsche 993 Turbo is featured in Need For Speed: High Stakes as the flagship car of the game, as well as in Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed.

===Turbo S===

During the second-to-last year of production of the 993 (1997), Porsche offered the 993 Turbo S, which was manufactured by Porsche Exclusiv department. The Turbo S is a high-specification Turbo including a power upgrade to , achieved through the use of larger Triple K K-24 turbochargers, an additional oil cooler, and a modified Motronic engine management system. American market cars produced . The inclusion of extras including carbon fibre decoration in the interior makes it different from the earlier lightweight, spartan 964 Turbo S. The 993 Turbo S is recognized by yellow brake calipers, a slightly larger rear wing, a quad-pipe exhaust system, a front spoiler with brake-cooling ducts (on European market cars), carbon fibre door sills with &#x27;Turbo S&#x27; badging, and air scoops behind the doors. This was the last of the air-cooled 911 Turbos. The curb weight of the car amounted to .

Performance figures include a 0– acceleration time of 3.6 seconds, 0– acceleration time of 8.9 seconds and a top speed of .

===Carrera 4S / Carrera S===

The Carrera 4 S (1996) and the later rear-wheel drive Carrera S (1997) shared the Turbo model&#x27;s bodyshell, but housed the naturally aspirated engine in the rear. Both of the S models had slightly lowered suspension as compared to standard Carrera models. The all-wheel drive 4S is heavier than the S due to the former&#x27;s all-wheel drive system, resulting in a curb weight of for the C4S vs. for the C2S. Due to this, the S has a quicker acceleration time and a slightly greater top speed than the 4S. Although a Carrera S Cabriolet was never officially offered by the factory, a small number (believed to be five) were specially ordered through the Porsche Exclusiv department in 1997 and sold as 1998 models by Beverly Hills Porsche in California and a single example was ordered by a VIP client through Porsche Exclusiv department for the European market. The wide bodywork is widely acclaimed for its rear looks; it creates more aerodynamic drag, leading to slightly lower top speeds compared to the narrower siblings (about 5 km/h), but the wider tyres result in excellent road holding. The Carrera S is one of the most valuable 993 variants. Production of the Carrera S amounted to 1,752 examples for all of North America during the entire 993 series production run, in part because they were manufactured only for the 1997 model year together with a very brief stub period later in 1997, denominated as 1998 models. While unusual, the special limited run models such as the 993 RS, GT, and Turbo S are both rarer and more expensive.

===Carrera RS===
The Carrera RS is a lightweight variant of the Carrera built in 1995 and 1996. It features a naturally aspirated 3.8-liter engine generating a maximum power output of achieved by the use of lightweight forged pistons, dual oil coolers, big intake valves, Varioram variable-length intake manifold, a modified Bosch Motronic engine management system, and lightened rocker arms. The six-speed G50/31 manual gearbox with a short shifter used on the Carrera RS had modified gear ratios for the first three gears. The larger 322 mm cross drilled and ventilated discs brakes front and aft with four piston calipers were shared with the 911 Turbo and limited-slip differential was included as standard equipment. The exterior is easily distinguishable from a normal Carrera by a large fixed rear wing, small front flaps, and three-piece aluminum wheels. The headlight washers were deleted for weightsaving reasons. A seam-welded body shell with an aluminum bonnet supported with a single strut was used along with thinner glass. On the interior, the rear seats were removed, and special racing seats along with spartan door cards were installed. Sound proofing was also reduced to a minimum. The suspension system used Bilstein dampers and the ride height was lowered for improved handling. Adjustable front and rear antiroll bars and an under-bonnet strut brace further increased handling. The final weight of the car was .

The Clubsport (option code M003) was a track-oriented iteration of the Carrera RS with relatively limited road usability. The Clubsport came equipped with a welded roll cage, suspension strut brace, lightweight composite bucket seats, racing harnesses well as certain comfort features such as carpets, power windows, air conditioning, and radio were deleted. The exterior wise sports a larger rear wing and a deeper chin spoiler than the standard RS. The gearbox ratios were also changed, with a shorter 4th, 5th and 6th gear and a shorter throw gear lever. 

A RSR variant was available for customers who wanted to go racing. The RSR 3.8 was developed by the Porsche motorsport department specifically to support Porsche customer race team entries in to International Endurance events like the American IMSA GT series and European GT series. Porsche Motorsport produced 45 of these.

The Carrera RS was produced in model years 1995 and 1996. It was street legal in Europe and most other markets, but was not approved for import to the United States. Production amounted to 1,014 cars, including 227 Clubsport variants.

===GT2===

The GT2 was the racing version of the 993 Turbo made to compete in the FIA GT2 class racing. By the mid-1990s, most of the sanctioning bodies of road racing had placed severe limitations, if not outright bans on the use all-wheel drive systems, due in part to Audi&#x27;s earlier success in campaigning their various &quot;Quattro&quot; cars in touring car races around the globe, to Porsche&#x27;s 959 and its racing version the 961. In this atmosphere, to take their turbo-engined 993 racing, Porsche developed the rearwheel drive GT. The deletion of the all-wheel drive also brought with it the benefit of significant weight savings to the competition car. To qualify the car for racing, a few street-legal variants were created for homologation purposes, which are now highly prized and valued by collectors. The interior treatment of the GT2 is similar to that of the sibling Carrera RS. The fenders of the Turbo have been cut back and replaced with bolt-on plastic pieces to accommodate large racing tyres and to help ease the repairs of damage to the fenders that are an often recurring event in auto racing.

Until 1997, the street-legal version of GT2 racecar, named GT, had almost the same engine as the Turbo, but operated with higher boost pressure and generated a maximum power output of . In 1998 model year, a dual ignition system was added; power was raised to at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 3,500 rpm. Only 57 road-legal variants were built.

The racing variants have different engine set-ups depending on the applicable racing series. By 1996, the factory-quoted power rating was at 5,700 rpm and torque of of torque at 5,000 rpm. Power output was as high as in an &quot;Evo&quot; version designed for the GT1-series, of which only 11 cars were built before it was ultimately replaced by the mid-engined 911 GT1.

Additionally, the rear deck lid of the street-legal version of the GT2 also sported &quot;911 GT&quot; instead of &quot;911 GT2&quot;.

===Speedster===

The Speedster model was a variant of the 993, with a lowered roof, and a redesigned interior.

In contrast to the G-model and the 964, Porsche never officially offered the 993 in a Speedster body style. However, two were built by the factory - a dark green Speedster equipped with Tiptronic S and wheels for Ferdinand Alexander Porsche (for his 60th anniversary) in 1995 and another wide-body, silver Speedster with manual transmission and wheels for American TV star Jerry Seinfeld in 1998. The Seinfeld speedster was originally delivered as a cabriolet model and later sent back to the factory Exclusiv department to be &quot;rebuilt&quot; as a speedster. Additionally, a few 993 convertibles were converted to the Speedster body style by aftermarket coach builders.

===Turbo Cabriolet===
After the 3.3-liter G-model Turbo convertible (1987–89), Porsche never officially offered an air-cooled Turbo convertible again. However, fourteen 993 Turbo Cabriolets were built by the Porsche Exclusiv department in 1995, prior to the introduction of the 993 Turbo coupé. They featured the single-turbo engine of the 964 Turbo 3.6, a five-speed manual transmission, rear-wheel drive and the rear wing of the 964 Turbo 3.6. This cost a premium of DM 89,500 (or an additional 62 percent) over the standard 993 Cabriolet&#x27;s price.

The 993 generation of the 911 is often referred to as the best and most desirable of the 911 series. The 993 is quoted as &quot;the last complete &#x27;modern classic&#x27;&quot;; &quot;the 993 was and forever will be that last fresh breath of air that Porsche gave the world; elegance and muscle all in one package.&quot; The book &quot;Porsche 993 - Essential Companion&quot; refers to the 993 as the &quot;King of Porsche,&quot; and it is generally acknowledged as &quot;The purists&#x27; Holy Grail.&quot;

In its 12 April 2017 article entitled &quot;The Porsche 993 Actually Lives up to the Hype,&quot; &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; writes that the 993 is &quot;something truly special,&quot; with &quot;a combination of old-school feel and modern usability that isn&#x27;t found in many other cars,&quot; with &quot;great steering, great brakes, and a wonderfully composed package.&quot; It also states that &quot;The 993 is also beautifully built -- it&#x27;s a relic from the time when Porsche didn&#x27;t cut corners anywhere.&quot;

== Successor ==
The 993 was replaced by the 996. This represented a dramatic change for the 911. As many enthusiasts agree, &quot;the 993 is one of the sweetest spots in the 911&#x27;s half-century of existence,&quot; and while &quot;more modern versions might be more dynamically capable, they&#x27;re bloated behemoths in comparison to the lean 993.&quot;

<text>Paradise Hotel is an American reality television program. In the show, a group of singles live in a luxurious hotel resort, competing to see who can stay in the hotel the longest. Each week, the contestants pair off into couples, and must share a hotel room together. One person is left over, and he or she must either pair up in the following episode, or leave the hotel to be replaced by a new contestant. The format was created by Mentorn, a British production company, which has produced various versions of the show around the world.

The show premiered on Fox in 2003, and was hosted by Amanda Byram. A second season, also hosted by Byram, was broadcast on MyNetworkTV and Fox Reality Channel in 2008. Fox revived &quot;Paradise Hotel&quot; in 2019, with new host Kristin Cavallari, but Fox cancelled the series again in August 2019.

==Episodes==
===Series overview===
===Season 1 (2003)===

The first season of &quot;Paradise Hotel&quot;, hosted by Amanda Byram, aired on Fox from June 18 to October 1, 2003, and consists of thirty episodes. The winners of the first season were Charla Pihlstrom and Keith Cuda, with Dave Kerpen and Tara Gerard finishing as runners-up. Charla and Keith had to decide whether to split their $250,000 prize with their respective partners – Keith decided to share his winnings with Tara, while Charla chose to keep the money for herself and give Dave nothing.

===Season 2 (2008)===

A second season, titled Paradise Hotel 2, began airing on February 4, 2008, on the Fox-owned networks MyNetworkTV and Fox Reality Channel. It consists of sixteen episodes and a reunion special. Amanda Byram returned as host, and Mark Thompson returned as announcer.

New episodes aired on MyNetworkTV Monday nights at 9 p.m., and repeated Saturday nights at 9 p.m. Fox Reality Channel aired more explicit, TV-MA versions of the episodes, at 1 a.m. on the same night that they premiered on MyNetworkTV, and repeated these episodes throughout the following week.

Stephanie and Zack were the winners, but the runners-up, Tidisha and Ryan, were given the responsibility of choosing only one member of the winning couple to claim the &quot;ultimate prize&quot;. They chose Zack, who was awarded $200,000. He chose to share $20,000 with Tidisha and $90,000 with Stephanie, keeping the remaining $90,000 for himself.

===Season 3 (2019)===
In 2019, Fox ordered a revival of the series. Casting began in January, and Kristin Cavallari was chosen as the new host. The third season premiered on May 9, 2019. The revival&#x27;s season was truncated, with its season finale airing on June 6, 2019. The winners as chosen by a jury of the other former contestants were Bobby Ray and Tatum, beating Carlos and Kaitlin, but in the final twist, Bobby Ray chose to keep $200,000 of the prize for himself, leaving Tatum with nothing. The revival was officially canceled by Fox in August 2019.

==International versions==
Despite being only a modest success in the United States, the &quot;Paradise Hotel&quot; franchise has been described as &quot;an international hit&quot;, spawning versions in eighteen countries.

<text>Joseph Peter Kerwin (born February 19, 1932) is an American physician and former NASA astronaut. He served as the science pilot for the Skylab 2 mission from May 25, 1973, to June 22, 1973. He was the first physician to be selected for astronaut training and the first doctor from the United States to enter space. 

Kerwin was the one who uttered the words during Apollo 13: &quot;Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you.&quot; He was inducted into the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997.

== Early life and education ==
Kerwin was born in Oak Park, Illinois, on February 19, 1932, as the seventh child of an Irish Catholic family. He attended Fenwick High School, a private school in Oak Park, graduating in 1949. 

After graduating from high school, Kerwin enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross. He graduated in 1953 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, in philosophy with a minor in pre-med, ranked eighth in a class of 380 students. During his junior year, Kerwin won a national rhyme contest involving Lucky Strike cigarettes. His senior thesis was titled, &quot;Psychological Aspects of Competitive Swimming&quot;.

Kerwin received a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree from the Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University in 1957. He completed his internship at the District of Columbia General Hospital in Washington, D.C., and attended the United States Navy School of Aviation Medicine at Naval Air Station Pensacola before being designated a naval flight surgeon in December 1958.

=== Military career ===
Kerwin was a Captain in the Navy Medical Corps, commissioned in July 1958. He earned his flight surgeon&#x27;s wings at Beeville, Texas, in 1962. He has logged 4,500 hours flying time.

== NASA career ==

Kerwin was selected for NASA Astronaut Group 4 as a scientist-astronaut in June 1965. He was serving as a pilot and a flight surgeon for the Navy at the time of his selection. He was one of the capsule communicators (CAPCOMs) on Apollo 13 (in 1970).

Kerwin served as Science Pilot for the Skylab 2 (SL-2) mission which launched on May 25 and splashed down on June 22, 1973. With him for the initial activation and 28-day flight qualification operations of the Skylab Orbital Workshop were Charles &quot;Pete&quot; Conrad (spacecraft commander) and Paul J. Weitz (Pilot).

Kerwin was subsequently in charge of the on-orbit branch of the Astronaut Office, where he coordinated astronaut activity involving rendezvous, satellite deployment and retrieval, and other Space Shuttle payload operations. Kerwin was part of the NBC broadcasting team for coverage of the launch of STS-1.

From 1982–83, Kerwin served as NASA&#x27;s senior science representative in Australia. In this capacity, he served as liaison between NASA&#x27;s Office of Space Tracking and Data Systems and Australia&#x27;s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. During this time, Kerwin was considered to fly on the mission that would become STS-41-C (then known as STS-13), but his assignment in Australia prevented his selection.

From 1984–1987, Kerwin served as Director of Space and Life Sciences at the Johnson Space Center. There, he was responsible for direction and coordination of medical support to operational crewed spacecraft programs, including health care and maintenance of the astronauts and their families; for direction of life services, supporting research and light experiment project; and for managing JSC earth sciences and scientific efforts in lunar and planetary research. In 1986, he issued a report on the deaths of the crew killed in the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster to Associate Administrator for Space Flight, Richard H. Truly.

== Post-NASA career ==
Kerwin retired from the Navy, left NASA, and joined Lockheed in 1987. At Lockheed, he managed the Extravehicular Systems Project, providing hardware for Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot;, from 1988 to 1990; with Paul Cottingham and Ted Christian invented the Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER), first tested for use by space walking astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) during Space Shuttle flight STS-64. He then served on the Assured Crew Return Vehicle team, and served as Study Manager on the Human Transportation Study, a NASA review of future space transportation architectures. In 1994–95 he led the Houston liaison group for Lockheed Martin&#x27;s FGB contract, the procurement of the Russian &quot;space tug&quot; which has become the first element of the ISS. He served on the NASA Advisory Council from 1990 to 1993.

He joined Systems Research Laboratories (SRL) in June 1996, to serve as Program Manager of the SRL team which bid to win the Medical Support and Integration Contract at the Johnson Space Center. The incumbent, KRUG Life Sciences, was selected. Then, to his surprise, KRUG recruited him to replace its retiring president, T. Wayne Holt. He joined KRUG on April 1, 1997. On March 16, 1998, KRUG Life Sciences became the Life Sciences Special Business Unit of Wyle Laboratories of El Segundo, California.

In addition to his duties at Wyle, Kerwin serves on the Board of Directors of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) as an industry representative. He retired from Wyle in the summer of 2004.

== Personal life ==
Kerwin married Shirley Ann of Danville, Pennsylvania in 1960. They have three daughters: Sharon (born September 14, 1963), Joanna (born January 5, 1966), and Kristina (born May 4, 1968); and six grandchildren. His hobbies are reading, golf and classical music. He resides in College Station, Texas with his family.

==Organizations==
He is a fellow of the Aerospace Medical Association, and a member of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.

==Awards and honors==
The all-Navy crew was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal in 1973 from the Secretary of the Navy. The three Skylab astronaut crews were awarded the 1973 Robert J. Collier Trophy &quot;For proving beyond question the value of man in future explorations of space and the production of data of benefit to all the people on Earth.&quot; Gerald Carr accepted the 1975 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy from President Ford, awarded to the Skylab astronauts. The Skylab crew was awarded AIAA&#x27;s Haley Astronautics Award for 1974.

He was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997.

==Books==
Kerwin is co-author, along with fellow astronaut Owen K. Garriott and writer David Hitt, of &quot;Homesteading Space&quot;, a history of the Skylab program published in 2008.

==In films==
Kerwin is portrayed by Jack Hogan in the 1974 TV movie &quot;Houston, We&#x27;ve Got a Problem&quot;.

Joe Kerwin appears as himself in the 2018 documentary film &quot;Searching for Skylab&quot;.

<text>Max Rufus Mosley (13 April 1940 – 23 May 2021) was a British businessman, lawyer and racing driver. He served as president of the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), the governing body for Formula One.

A barrister and amateur racing driver, Mosley was a founder and co-owner of March Engineering, a racing car constructor and Formula One racing team. He dealt with legal and commercial matters for the company between 1969 and 1977 and became its representative at the Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association (FOCA), the body that represents Formula One constructors. Together with Bernie Ecclestone, Mosley represented FOCA at the FIA and in its dealings with race organisers. In 1978, he became the official legal adviser to FOCA. In this role, Mosley and Marco Piccinini negotiated the first version of the Concorde Agreement, which settled a long-standing dispute between FOCA and the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), a commission of the FIA and the then governing body of Formula One. Mosley was elected president of FISA in 1991 and became president of the FIA, FISA&#x27;s parent body, in 1993. Mosley identified his major achievement as FIA President as the promotion of the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP or Encap). He also promoted increased safety and the use of green technologies in motor racing. In 2008, stories about his sex life appeared in the British press, along with allegations regarding Nazi connotations. Mosley successfully sued the newspaper that published the allegations and maintained his position as FIA president. He stood down at the end of his term in 2009 and was replaced by his preferred successor, Jean Todt.

Mosley was the youngest son of Sir Oswald Mosley, former leader of the British Union of Fascists, and Diana Mitford. He was educated in France, Germany, and Britain before attending university at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated with a degree in physics. He then changed to law and was called to the bar in 1964. In his teens and early twenties, Mosley was involved with his father&#x27;s post-war political party, the Union Movement (UM). He commented that the association of his surname with fascism stopped him from developing his interest in politics further, although he briefly worked for the Conservative Party in the early 1980s, and was a donor to the Labour Party from the New Labour era until 2018.

Mosley was the subject of Michael Shevloff&#x27;s 2020 biographical documentary &quot;Mosley&quot;. He died at the age of 81 on 23 May 2021. An inquest confirmed his death as suicide following a diagnosis of terminal cancer.

==Family and early life==
Max Mosley was born on 13 April 1940 in London, in the early years of the Second World War. His father was Sir Oswald Mosley and his mother was Diana, Lady Mosley, one of the Mitford sisters. In addition to his older full-brother Alexander, Mosley had five older half-siblings. On his father&#x27;s side, they included the novelist Nicholas Mosley, 3rd Baron Ravensdale (1923–2017). On his mother&#x27;s side they were the merchant banker Jonathan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne (born 1930), and the Irish preservationist Desmond Guinness (1931–2020). He was a nephew of Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, and first cousin of Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire. He was also third cousin of Winston Churchill MP, the grandson of the British prime minister, and fifth cousin of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

Mosley&#x27;s father had been a Labour minister, and Member of Parliament for both the Conservative and Labour parties in the 1920s before leaving mainstream politics and becoming leader of the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in the 1930s. The month after Max&#x27;s birth, Sir Oswald, who had campaigned for a negotiated peace between the United Kingdom and Nazi Germany, was interned by the British authorities under Defence Regulation 18B, along with other active fascists in Britain. Max&#x27;s mother was imprisoned a month later. Max and his brother Alexander were not included in their parents&#x27; internment and, as a result, were separated from them for the first few years of their lives. In December 1940, Prime Minister Winston Churchill asked the Home Secretary Herbert Morrison to ensure Lady Mosley was able to see Max regularly.
Sir Oswald and Lady Mosley were released from detention at HMP Holloway on 16 November 1943, provoking widespread public protests. Their children were refused entry to several schools, due to a combination of their wildness and their parents&#x27; reputation, and were initially tutored at home instead. The family moved to a succession of country houses in England. Mosley&#x27;s older half-brother Nicholas described the family, including Sir Oswald&#x27;s children from his first marriage, spending the summer of 1945 getting the harvest in and shooting at Crowood Farm, near Ramsbury, Wiltshire. In 1950, the Mosleys bought houses in Ireland, and in Orsay, near Paris. They spent the year moving around Europe, spending the spring in France and the autumn and winter in Ireland, where Mosley was keen on riding and hunting. His aunt Nancy Mitford, in letters to Evelyn Waugh, recalled Sir Oswald and his family cruising the Mediterranean Sea on the family yacht. On one such trip they visited Spain and were entertained by Sir Oswald&#x27;s friend General Franco.
At the age of 13, Mosley was sent to Stein an der Traun in Germany for two years, where he learned to speak fluent German. On his return to England, he spent a year at Millfield, an independent boarding school in Somerset, after which he continued his education in London for two years. He attended Christ Church at Oxford University, graduating with a degree in physics in 1961. During his time there, he was secretary of the Oxford Union where his father spoke on two occasions, once with Jeremy Thorpe on the other side. In 1960, Mosley introduced his father to Robert Skidelsky, one of Mosley&#x27;s contemporaries at the university, later a biographer of his father. Rejecting an early ambition to work as a physicist after &quot;establishing that there was no money in it&quot;, Mosley studied law at Gray&#x27;s Inn in London and qualified as a barrister in 1964. After a pupillage with Maurice Drake, he specialised in patent and trademark law. From 1961 to 1964, Mosley was a member of the Territorial Army, Parachute Regiment (44th Independent Parachute Brigade Group).
Mosley, like many Formula One drivers, lived in Monaco. On 9 June 1960, he was married at the Chelsea Register Office to Jean Taylor, the daughter of James Taylor, a policeman from Streatham. In 1970, their first son, Alexander, was born, and in 1972 their second son, Patrick. On 5 May 2009, Alexander, a restaurateur, was found at his Notting Hill home by his cleaner. He had died of drug abuse at the age of 39. An inquest was held on 10 June 2009, the Westminster coroner declaring that his death was due to non-dependent drug abuse.

==Politics==
From their teens to early twenties, Mosley and his brother were involved with their father&#x27;s post-war party, the far-right Union Movement (UM), which advocated European nationalism. Trevor Grundy, a central figure in the UM&#x27;s Youth Movement, writes of the 16-year-old Mosley painting the flash and circle symbol on walls in London on the night of the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Hungary (4 November 1956). The flash and circle was used by both the UM and the pre-war BUF. He also says Mosley organised a couple of large parties as a way &quot;to get in with lively, ordinary, normal young people, girls as well as boys, and attract them to the Movement by showing that we were like them and didn&#x27;t go on about Hitler and Mussolini, Franco and British Fascism all the time&quot;. Mosley met his future wife Jean at such a party. Mosley and Alexander were photographed posing as Teddy Boys in Notting Hill during the 1958 race riots between Afro-Caribbeans and local white gangs. The following year, they canvassed for their father when he ran as a Union Movement candidate for the nearby Kensington North seat in the 1959 general election.

Mosley rarely discussed his early political involvement with his father. When his father Oswald died, the London &quot;Daily Mail&quot; described him as a &quot;much maligned and much misunderstood political giant of his era&quot;. Certainly, his father&#x27;s political presence affected his early years, but Mosley reflected on this time, &quot;I was born into this rather strange family and then at a certain point you get away from that.&quot; While he distanced himself from this period of his life, the &quot;misunderstanding has remained and today...he carries that weight on his shoulders.&quot;
In a 1961 by-election, Mosley was an election agent for the Union Movement, supporting Walter Hesketh, the UM&#x27;s parliamentary candidate for Manchester Moss Side. The motor racing journalist Alan Henry described him as one of his father&#x27;s &quot;right-hand men&quot; at the time of a violent incident in 1962, in which Sir Oswald was knocked down by a mob in London and saved from serious injury by his son&#x27;s intervention. As a result of his involvement in this fracas, Mosley was arrested and charged with threatening behaviour. He was later cleared at Old Street Magistrates&#x27; Court on the grounds that he was trying to protect his father. By 1964, when he began work as a barrister, Mosley was no longer involved in politics.
In the early 1980s, Mosley attempted a political career, working for the Conservative Party and hoping to become a parliamentary candidate. Bernie Ecclestone&#x27;s biographer, Terry Lovell, wrote that he gave up this aspiration after being unimpressed by &quot;the calibre of senior party officials&quot;. He also believed his name would be a handicap and later said, &quot;If I had a completely open choice in my life, I would have chosen party politics, but because of my name, that&#x27;s impossible&quot;. By the late 1990s, he had become a donor to the Labour Party and a supporter of the government of Tony Blair. In 2018, Labour decided not to accept further donations from Mosley following accusations that he published a leaflet in the 1960s linking immigrants with disease. Mosley had already donated £500,000 to the office of deputy leader Tom Watson.

==Racing career==
While Mosley was at university, his wife was given tickets to a motor race at the Silverstone Circuit. The circuit is not far from Oxford, and the couple went out of curiosity. Mosley was attracted by the sport, and once qualified as a barrister, began teaching law in the evenings to earn enough money to start racing cars himself. The sport&#x27;s indifference to his background appealed to Mosley:

At national level in the UK, Mosley competed in over 40 races in 1966 and 1967; he won 12 and set several class lap records. In 1968, he formed the London Racing Team in partnership with driver Chris Lambert to compete in European Formula Two, which at that time was the level of racing just below Formula One. Their cars were prepared by Frank Williams, later a Formula One team owner. It was a dangerous time to race: Mosley&#x27;s first Formula Two race was the 1968 Deutschland Trophäe at Hockenheim in which double world champion Jim Clark was killed, and within two years both of Mosley&#x27;s 1968 teammates, Piers Courage and Chris Lambert, were dead in racing accidents. Mosley&#x27;s best result that year was an eighth place at a non-championship race at Monza. Engine builder Brian Hart says that as a driver, Mosley &quot;might not have been particularly quick, but he was a thinking driver. He kept out of trouble and generally used his head.&quot;

==March Engineering==

In 1969, after two large accidents due to breakages on his Lotus car, Mosley decided that &quot;it was evident that I wasn&#x27;t going to be World Champion&quot; and retired from driving. He was already working with Robin Herd, Alan Rees, and Graham Coaker to establish the racing car manufacturer March Engineering where he handled legal and commercial matters. The name March is an acronym based on the initials of the founders; the &#x27;M&#x27; stands for Mosley. Like the other founders, Mosley put in £2,500 of capital. His father told him that the company &quot;would certainly go bankrupt, but it would be good training for something serious later on.&quot;
Mosley played a key role in publicising the new outfit. Although March had few resources and limited experience, the firm announced ambitious plans to enter Formula One, the pinnacle of single-seater racing, in 1970. The team had initially intended to enter a single car, but by the beginning of the season (partly due to deals made by Mosley), the number of March cars entered for their first Formula One race had risen to five. Two of these were run by March&#x27;s own in-house and the rest by customer teams. Mosley also negotiated sponsorship from tyre maker Firestone and oil additive manufacturer STP.
The new operation was initially successful. In Formula One, March cars won three of their first four races. One of these was a world championship race, the 1970 Spanish Grand Prix, won by reigning world champion Jackie Stewart in a customer car run by Tyrrell Racing. As a result, March finished third in the 1970 Constructors&#x27; Championship. The factory also sold 40 cars to customers in various lower formulae. Despite these successes, the organisation got into financial difficulty almost immediately. The Formula One operation was costing more than the customer car business was making. The March works team&#x27;s contract with its lead driver, Chris Amon, was expensive, and Mosley, in his own words, &quot;tried at every opportunity to get rid of him&quot;. He reasoned that Stewart&#x27;s highly competitive customer car was enough to show March in a good light. Amon stayed to the end of the year, but Mosley succeeded in &quot;restructuring&quot; his contract, saving the company some much-needed money. At the end of the season, Mosley successfully demanded full control of the finances, including the factory run by Coaker, who left shortly afterwards. Mosley and Herd borrowed £20,000 from relatives and friends to support the company into its second year. According to Lovell, the money came from Mosley&#x27;s half-brother, Jonathan Guinness.
Tyrrell started making its own cars towards the end of 1970, and March&#x27;s 1971 programme in Formula One was much reduced, with no recognised front-running driver. The Firestone and STP sponsorship was insufficient and Mosley failed to attract a large backer for 1971. Motorsport author Mike Lawrence has suggested that the shortfall forced him into short-term deals, which maintained cashflow, but were not in the best long-term interests of the company. Mosley negotiated a deal for the team to use Alfa Romeo engines in a third car, bringing much needed funding. The engines proved uncompetitive, and his hopes of an ongoing partnership with the Italian automobile manufacturer were not met. Nonetheless, March again finished third in the constructors championship, and works driver Ronnie Peterson, in a Cosworth DFV-powered car, was second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. March&#x27;s financial woes continued: the company had lost £71,000 at the end of 1971. Mosley and Rees disagreed over how to rectify the situation and Rees left March early in 1972.
March was more successful in selling large numbers of customer cars in the lower formulae. Mosley organised extensive test sessions for the 1971 cars for journalists and drivers, and arranged a successful scheme for drivers to rent cars and engines for the season, rather than buying them outright. Losing money on a deal to supply Jochen Neerpasch, then motorsport manager at Ford, with a Formula Two car paid off when Neerpasch moved to BMW and offered March an exclusive deal to use BMW&#x27;s Formula Two engine for the 1973 season. March cars powered by BMW engines won five of the next 11 European Formula Two championships. 
Although March considered quitting Formula One on several occasions, money was always found to support at least one car. Motorsport historian Mike Lawrence credits Mosley with pressing for a six-wheeled March to be built as a draw for sponsors, having seen the popularity with fans of Tyrrell&#x27;s six-wheeled P34. The resulting March 2-4-0 never competed in Formula One, but generated the required publicity and a Scalextric slotcar model was profitable. Mosley spent much of his time negotiating deals for drivers with sponsorship and was also successful in selling Marches to other Formula One teams, such as Williams and Penske. The cars were rarely frontrunners, although the works team won a single race in both 1975 and 1976. By the end of 1977, Mosley was fed up with the struggle to compete in Formula One with no resources and left to work for FOCA full-time, selling his shares in the company to Herd but remaining as a director. March&#x27;s involvement in Formula One ended the same year.

==Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association==
From 1969, Mosley was invited to represent March at the Grand Prix Constructors&#x27; Association (GPCA), which negotiated joint deals on behalf of its member teams. Although the new March organisation was not popular with the established teams, Mosley has said that &quot;when they went along to meetings to discuss things such as prize money, they felt they ought to take me along because I was a lawyer&quot;. He was unimpressed with the standard of negotiations: &quot;our side all went in a group because no-one trusted anyone else and all were afraid that someone would break ranks and make a private deal.&quot; In 1971, British businessman Bernie Ecclestone bought the Brabham team, and Mosley recalled that: 
The Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association (FOCA) was created in 1974 by Ecclestone, Colin Chapman, Teddy Mayer, Mosley, Ken Tyrrell, and Frank Williams. FOCA would represent the commercial interests of the teams at meetings with the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI) a commission of the FIA and motorsport&#x27;s world governing body. The CSI later became the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), motorsport&#x27;s world governing body. After leaving March at the end of , Mosley officially became legal advisor to FOCA, which was led by Ecclestone. In his biography of Ecclestone, Terry Lovell suggests that he appointed Mosley to this role not only because of his legal ability, but also because he &quot;saw in Mosley the necessary diplomatic and political skills that made him perfectly suited to the establishment of the FIA&quot;. The Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), founded in 1904 was FISA&#x27;s parent body, representing road car users worldwide. In the same year, Mosley was nominated for a role at the FIA&#x27;s Bureau Permanent International de Constructeurs d&#x27;Automobile (BPICA). His nomination was blocked by French, Italian, and German manufacturers.
In the early 1980s, Mosley represented FOCA in the &quot;FISA–FOCA war&quot;, a conflict between FOCA, representing the mainly UK-based independent teams, and FISA, which was supported by the &quot;grandee&quot; constructors owned by road car manufacturers (primarily Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, and Renault). In 1980, FOCA announced its own World Federation of Motor Sport and ran the non-championship 1981 South African Grand Prix. The staging of this event, with worldwide television coverage, helped persuade Jean-Marie Balestre, the FISA president, that FISA would have to negotiate a settlement with FOCA. As Mosley later commented ... &quot;We were absolutely . If Balestre could have held the manufacturer&#x27;s support for a little bit longer, the constructors would have been on their knees. The outcome would then have been very different.&quot; Mosley helped draw up the Concorde Agreement, a document which resolved the dispute by essentially giving FISA control of the rules and FOCA control of commercial and television rights. The most recent version of the Concorde Agreement expired on 31 December 2007, and a new one was being discussed, as of 2008. In 1982, the year after the first Concorde Agreement was signed, Mosley left his role at FOCA, and Formula One, to work for the Conservative Party.

==FISA presidency==

Mosley returned to motorsport in 1986, with the support of Ecclestone and Balestre, to become president of the FISA Manufacturers&#x27; Commission, the successor body to the BPICA with a seat on the FISA World Council. That same year, he established Simtek Research, a racing technical consultancy firm, with Nick Wirth, a former March employee. He sold his share of Simtek in 1991, when elected president of the FISA. According to Lovell, in 1987 Mosley suggested to Balestre that he could deal with his problems with Ecclestone by &quot;mak[ing] him a member of the establishment&quot;. Later that year Ecclestone was appointed a vice-president of the FIA with responsibility for promotional affairs, with authority over Formula One and the other motor sports authorised by the FIA.
In 1991, Mosley challenged Balestre for the presidency of FISA. Mosley said that his decision to challenge the Frenchman was prompted by Balestre&#x27;s reported intervention on behalf of his countryman Alain Prost to ensure that race stewards disqualified Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna from the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix. Mosley campaigned on the basis that Balestre, who was also president of the FIA and of the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile, could not effectively manage all these roles together. He also said that no-one challenged Balestre because they were afraid of the consequences and suggested that the FISA President should not interfere with F1, which could be left to run itself. Mosley won the FISA presidency by 43 votes to 29; Balestre remained as FIA president. Mosley resigned a year later, fulfilling a promise made during his election campaign to seek a re-affirmation of his mandate. &quot;I wanted to show people that I do what I say&quot;, he said. &quot;Now they can judge me in a year&#x27;s time.&quot; FISA immediately re-elected him.

==FIA presidency==

===1993–1997===
In 1993, Mosley agreed with Balestre that the Frenchman would stand down as president of the FIA in Mosley&#x27;s favour, in return for the new role of President of the FIA Senate, to be created after Mosley&#x27;s election. As well as motorsport, the FIA&#x27;s remit includes the interests of motorists worldwide, an area in which Mosley wanted to involve himself. He had said, &quot;That is what really interested me: [in F1] you maybe save one life every five years, whereas [in] road safety you are talking about thousands of lives&quot;. A challenge to Mosley&#x27;s election by Jeffrey Rose, chairman of the British Royal Automobile Club, which arose was withdrawn when it became clear that the majority of voters were already committed to Mosley. The FISA was then merged into the FIA as its sporting arm.
After the deaths of the drivers Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, worldwide media attention focused on the charismatic triple world champion Senna, rather than Ratzenberger, a virtual unknown driving for the minor Simtek team. Mosley did not go to Senna&#x27;s funeral but attended that of Ratzenberger. In a press conference ten years later Mosley stated, &quot;I went to his funeral because everyone went to Senna&#x27;s. I thought it was important that somebody went to his&quot;. In the aftermath of the deaths, and a number of other serious accidents, Mosley announced the formation of the Advisory Expert Group chaired by Professor Sid Watkins, to research and improve safety in motor racing. Watkins, who learned of his new role by hearing Mosley announce it on the radio, has called it a &quot;novel and revolutionary approach&quot;. The resulting changes included reducing the capacity and power of engines, the use of grooved tyres to reduce cornering speeds, the introduction of the HANS device to protect drivers necks in accidents, circuit re-design, and greatly increased requirements for crash testing of chassis. 
In 1995, a deal was signed between Ecclestone and the FIA that passed all of the commercial rights to Formula One to him for fifteen years, on the condition that they would return to the FIA at the end of that period. Ecclestone had been building up Formula One as a television package since the early 1990s, investing heavily in new digital television technology. For the duration of the deal, the FIA would receive an index-linked annual fixed royalty, estimated by Lovell at around 15%. Mosley said &quot;My belief is that I got a better deal than anyone else could have because it was more difficult for Ecclestone to take a hard line with me as we had worked together for so long.&quot; The following year, the FIA also passed the rights to all its other directly sanctioned championships and events to Ecclestone, also for 15 years. An attempt to add a 10-year extension to the F1 contract in return for a share in Ecclestone&#x27;s proposed flotation of Formula One was later vetoed by the European Commission. Mosley&#x27;s agreement with Ecclestone on television rights for F1 angered three of the team principals in particular: Ron Dennis (McLaren), Frank Williams (Williams), and Ken Tyrrell (Tyrrell), who felt that neither Ecclestone nor the FIA had the right to make such an agreement without the teams. They refused to sign the 1997 Concorde Agreement without increased financial returns and threatened to make a complaint under European Union competition rules. The European Commission was already investigating the FIA&#x27;s agreement with Ecclestone in what Lovell calls a &quot;highly personal and bitter battle between Max Mosley and [EU commissioner Karel] van Miert&quot;.

===1997–2001===
Mosley was elected to his second term as president of the FIA in October 1997.
Later that year, the EU Commission Directorate-General for Competition made a preliminary decision against Ecclestone and the FIA. The resulting warning letters from van Miert to the FIA and Ecclestone were leaked and ended the attempt to float F1; the FIA won a case against the commission for the leak in 1998.
At the same time, a local court in Germany ruled that the television rights to the FIA European Truck Racing Cup (passed to Ecclestone by the FIA the previous year, along with all other FIA authorised championships) should be returned to the series organiser, following a complaint from German television company AE TV-Cooperations. The TV Company argued that Ecclestone and Mosley were in breach of commercial clauses in the Treaty of Rome; following the court&#x27;s decision Mosley appealed the judgement and cancelled the series until further notice. On appeal, the court ruled that the series organiser should be able to sell the television rights to whoever they felt was the best option for coverage and the FIA reinstated the European Truck Racing Cup.
Between 1997 and 2000, Mosley repeatedly warned that if any EU decision went against the FIA, the marketing organisations and F1 itself would be moved out of Europe. In 1999, the EU Commission Directorate-General for Competition issued a Statement of Objections, listing a number of grievances surrounding the FIA&#x27;s dealings with Ecclestone and Formula One. The FIA released the Statement to the media and held a press conference in Brussels ridiculing the commission&#x27;s case. The Commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti-competitive and invited the FIA and Ecclestone&#x27;s companies, ISC and FOA, to submit proposals to modify these arrangements. In 2001, nine months after settlement talks had begun, the parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts, which included Ecclestone stepping down as the FIA&#x27;s vice-president of promotional affairs and the FIA ending all involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One.
Mosley came up with an innovative way to dispose of the FIA&#x27;s involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One. In order to maintain Ecclestone&#x27;s investment to deliver digital television, he proposed extending Ecclestone&#x27;s rights for F1 coverage to 100 years from the initial 15, arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti-competition as it was effectively the same as an outright sale. The Commission agreed with his assessment and in the interest of impartiality, Mosley removed himself from the negotiations, which eventually returned around $300 million (£150 million).
The FIA planned to &quot;put almost all of it into a charitable foundation which will then have the resources to undertake important work on improving safety in motor sport and in road safety&quot;, and thus the FIA Foundation was created in 2001. In addition, the FIA continued to receive an annual dividend from the deal, Mosley stated: &quot;Over the totality of the contract, and on an annual basis, the sum we have accepted represents billions of dollars. Looked at from that point of view, it is a huge amount of money.&quot; Lovell compares the figure to extend the rights to 100 years to the £600 million KirchGruppe paid for the rights to the 2002 Football World Cup and the £1.1 billion British Sky Broadcasting paid for a three-year package of English Premier League football. The figure was not entirely comparable however due to the dispute over who actually owned Formula One. Before the settlement with the EU Commission was reached, Mosley feared that the FIA was losing control over the sport following a heated argument with Ecclestone in Paris. Ecclestone argued that he had built Formula One into the entity that it was and the FIA only had rights to designate the event as official. Ecclestone threatened to &quot;do a scorched earth&quot; if another party were to gain control of the commercial side of Formula One. Mosley came up with the solution in order for the FIA to retain its sporting management role and Ecclestone to retain his commercial role.

Over the same period, Mosley was attempting to delay European legislation banning tobacco advertising. Formula One advertisements were controlled by Paddy McNally, an ex-Marlboro sponsorship consultant, and his company Allsport Management SA. At this time, all leading Formula One teams carried significant branding from tobacco brands; for instance, Williams ran with backing from Rothmans; West was a backer of several teams including McLaren; McLaren also enjoyed a long-term relationship with Marlboro, as did Ferrari, and Mild Seven backed Benetton&#x27;s Formula One effort. The Labour party had pledged to ban tobacco advertising in its manifesto ahead of its 1997 General Election victory, supporting a proposed European Union Directive. The Labour Party&#x27;s stance on banning tobacco advertising was reinforced following the election by forceful statements from the Health Secretary Frank Dobson and Minister for Public Health Tessa Jowell. Ecclestone appealed &quot;over Jowell&#x27;s head&quot; to Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair&#x27;s chief of staff, who arranged a meeting with Blair. Ecclestone and Mosley, both Labour Party donors, met Blair on 16 October 1997. Mosley argued that the proposed legislation was illegal by EU rules, that Formula One needed more time to find alternative sources of funding and that the prompt introduction of a ban would lead to races being held outside Europe, while the coverage, including tobacco logos, would still be broadcast into the EU. He also argued that:

On 4 November, the &quot;fiercely anti-tobacco Jowell&quot; argued in Brussels for an exemption for Formula One. Media attention initially focused on Labour bending its principles for a &quot;glamour sport&quot; and on the &quot;false trail&quot; of Jowell&#x27;s husband&#x27;s links to the Benetton Formula team. On 6 November, correspondents from three newspapers enquired whether Labour had received any donations from Ecclestone; he had donated £1 million in January 1997. On 11 November, Labour promised to return the money on the advice of Sir Patrick Neill. On 17 November, Blair apologised for his government&#x27;s mishandling of the affair and stated &quot;the decision to exempt Formula One from tobacco sponsorship was taken two weeks later. It was in response to fears that Britain might lose the industry overseas to Asian countries who were bidding for it.&quot;
The revised directive went into force in June 1998, and banned sponsorship from 2003, with a further three-year extension for &quot;global sports such as Formula One&quot;. On 5 October 2000, the directive was overturned in the European Court of Justice on the grounds that it was unlawful. A new Tobacco Advertising Directive took effect in July 2005; the &quot;Financial Times&quot; described Mosley as &quot;furious&quot; that this was a year earlier than provided for under the 1998 directive. As of 2009, Ferrari is the only F1 team to retain tobacco sponsorship, although the team carries no explicit branding in races because of the European legislation. Although the FIA moved its headquarters out of the EU in 1999, it returned in 2001.

Asked in a 2003 interview about his most enduring achievement as president of the FIA, Mosley replied: &quot;I think using Formula One to push ENCAP Crash-Testing.&quot; The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) is a European car safety performance assessment programme that originated with work done by the Transport Research Laboratory for the UK Department for Transport. The FIA became involved in the programme in 1996, taking a lead in promoting it, and Mosley chaired the body from its launch as Euro NCAP in 1997 to 2004. Despite what NCAP describes as a &quot;strong negative response&quot; from car manufacturers at first, the initiative has expanded, and NCAP says that there has been a clear increase in the safety of modern cars as a result. The EU commission in 2000 stated that &quot;EuroNCAP had become the single most important mechanism for achieving advances in vehicle safety&quot; and &quot;the most cost effective road safety action available to the EU.&quot; Mosley continued to promote the matter through his membership of initiatives such as CARS 21, the European Commission&#x27;s policy group aimed at improving the worldwide competitiveness of the European automotive industry.
In February 2001, Mosley announced his intention to stand again for the presidency in October of that year, saying that if successful this third term would be his last.

===2001–2005===

Mosley was elected to his third term as president of the FIA in 2001. From 2000, Formula One saw the return of teams partly or wholly owned and operated by major motor manufacturers, who feared that under Ecclestone&#x27;s management F1 coverage would go to pay television, reducing the value of their investment. In 2001, the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA) announced an alternative world championship, the Grand Prix World Championship to start by 2008. The GPMA stipulated that the championship should not be regulated by the FIA, which Lovell believes was because the organisation believed Mosley was too close to Ecclestone. The proposed championship came to nothing and the GPMA later became the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA).
In June 2004, Mosley announced that he would step down from his position in October of that year, one year early, saying &quot;I no longer find it either satisfying or interesting to sit in long meetings [...] I have achieved in this job everything I set out to [...]&quot;. One month later, he rescinded his decision after the FIA Senate called for him to stay on. According to a BBC Sport profile, many insiders considered that the announcement, and Mosley&#x27;s public disagreements with Ecclestone, were &quot;just part of a well crafted plan to strengthen their control over the sport&quot;; Ron Dennis, the McLaren team principal, suggested that it arose because Mosley&#x27;s proposals for Formula One met opposition. In 2004, Mosley said he felt Ferrari&#x27;s then team principal Jean Todt should succeed him as president of the FIA when he stepped down.
The 2005 United States Grand Prix was run with only six cars, after the Michelin tyres used by the other 14 cars proved unsafe for the circuit. A proposal involving the addition of a temporary chicane to slow cars through the fastest corner of the circuit was suggested but rejected by Mosley. He stated his reasons for not agreeing to the chicane: &quot;Formula One is a dangerous activity and it would be most unwise to make fundamental changes to a circuit without following tried and tested procedures. What happened was bad but can be put right. This is not true of a fatality.&quot; He continued, &quot;Formula One is a sport which entertains. It is not entertainment disguised as sport.&quot; Mosley gave three possible solutions for the Michelin runners: to use qualifying tyres but change them whenever necessary on safety grounds, to use a different tyre to be provided by Michelin or to run at reduced speed. These were all rejected by the Michelin-shod teams. Paul Stoddart, the owner of the Minardi team who ran on Bridgestone tyres, was prepared to compromise to accommodate Michelin teams—even though a reduced field would guarantee his team much needed points—and was particularly vocal in his criticism and renewed his calls for Mosley to resign.

===2005–2009===

Mosley was elected unopposed to his fourth term as president of the FIA in 2005. In recognition of his contribution to road safety and motorsport, Mosley was made a Chevalier dans l&#x27;Ordre de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 2006. The Légion d&#x27;honneur (Legion of Honour) is France&#x27;s highest decoration for outstanding achievements in military or civil life; a Chevalier (Knight) is the fifth class.
Continuing a theme of his presidency, in 2006 Mosley called for Formula One manufacturers to develop technology relevant to road cars. In recent years, a large proportion of the enormous budget of Formula One has been spent on the development of very powerful, very high-revving engines, which some say have little applicability to road cars. Mosley announced a 10-year freeze on the development of engines, to allow manufacturers to spend more of their budgets on environmentally friendly technology such as the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) introduced in 2009. In July 2008, he sent a letter to the Formula One teams, in which he called for the teams to propose future sporting regulations to address specific issues including reduced fuel consumption.
The 2007 Formula One season was dominated by Ferrari&#x27;s accusations that the McLaren team had made illegal use of their intellectual property, leading to legal cases in the United Kingdom and Italy. Unlike previous cases, such as the Toyota team&#x27;s illegal use of Ferrari intellectual property in 2004 that had been handled by German police, the FIA investigated. They initially found McLaren innocent; unable to find enough evidence to suggest that anyone other than designer Mike Coughlan had seen the information or that the team had used it. Ron Dennis, team principal of McLaren, was unaware at this point that Mosley had been sent personal e-mails from Fernando Alonso, stating that the data had been used and seen by others in the team. When Italian police uncovered a series of text messages between McLaren and their spy at Ferrari, the team was hauled in front of the World Motor Sports Council (WMSC) once more. This time they were found guilty and eventually fined a gross $100M and excluded from the 2007 constructors&#x27; championship. Later in the year, the Renault team was found guilty by the FIA of possessing some of McLaren&#x27;s intellectual property, but was not punished, as the &quot;FIA&#x27;s WMSC decided there was not enough evidence to show the championship had been affected.&quot; In relation to McLaren, triple world champion Jackie Stewart criticised Mosley and stated that other teams did not back McLaren for &quot;fear of repercussions&quot;. Television commentator and newspaper columnist Martin Brundle, a former driver, was among those who criticised the FIA and Mosley for inconsistency and questioned the &quot;energetic manner&quot; in which he felt McLaren was being pursued, suggesting that there was a &quot;witch hunt&quot; against the team. Brundle and the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; subsequently received a writ for libel before the paper printed a correction. Mosley went on to defend himself of the charges made by Brundle, highlighting that the WMSC originally acquitted McLaren of any wrongdoing, stating: &quot;Concrete evidence of use by McLaren of the Ferrari information was simply not there.&quot; It was only later in the year when &quot;e-mails emerged which showed others inside McLaren were indeed aware of the Ferrari information&quot;, that the FIA found the team guilty.
At the start of 2008, Mosley said that he wanted to see through reforms such as budget capping and new technologies like KERS introduced into Formula One before retiring. In March of that year, the &quot;News of the World&quot; released video footage of Mosley engaged in acts with five consenting women in a scenario that the paper alleged involved Nazi role-playing (an allegation that, though dismissed in court as having &quot;no genuine basis&quot;, allegedly &quot;ruined&quot; Mosley&#x27;s reputation). The situation was made more controversial by his father&#x27;s association with the Nazis. Mosley admitted &quot;the embarrassment the revelations caused&quot;, but said that there was no Nazi theme involved. He was strongly criticised by former drivers, motor manufacturers, and several of the national motoring bodies who form the FIA. His involvement in the Bahrain Grand Prix was cancelled. Public expressions of support were limited. Mosley said that he received much supportive correspondence, and said that he would continue to the end of his current term, which he said would be his last. Mosley&#x27;s longtime ally Ecclestone eventually appeared to support Mosley&#x27;s removal.
Mosley won a vote of confidence at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the FIA on 3 June 2008, with 103 votes in support and 55 against, with seven abstentions and four invalid votes. Several clubs, including the ADAC, AAA and KNAC Nationale Autosport Federatie (KNAF) considered withdrawal from the FIA after the decision. Other formerly critical organisations subsequently said that they would accept the outcome of the vote and wished to move on. In July 2008, Mosley won a High Court legal case against the &quot;News of the World&quot; for invasion of privacy. The presiding judge, Mr Justice Eady, said there was: &quot;no evidence that the gathering on 28 March 2008 was intended to be an enactment of Nazi behaviour or adoption of any of its attitudes. Nor was it in fact. I see no genuine basis at all for the suggestion that the participants mocked the victims of the Holocaust.&quot;
In December 2008, Mosley said that he still intended to stand down when his term ran out in October 2009, but would take the final decision in June of that year. Mosley&#x27;s close relationship with Ecclestone, the sport&#x27;s promoter, was criticised in early 2009 by Sir Jackie Stewart, who suggested that Mosley should resign in favour of a CEO from outside motorsport.
In mid-2009, the FIA and the newly formed Formula One Teams Association disagreed over the format of rules for the following season. When the entry list for the 2010 championship was announced on 12 June 2009, the entries of five of the eight FOTA teams remained provisional on their acceptance of the new rules. The next day, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association announced its support for FOTA&#x27;s request for &quot;stability, clear rules, a clear and transparent system of governance&quot; and their threat to form a breakaway series from Formula One. The BBC Sport website reported this as an attack on Mosley&#x27;s authority and noted that Mosley was expected to stand again for the presidency in 2009.
On 23 June, Mosley said he was considering running for a fifth term as FIA president in October &quot;in light of the attack on my mandate&quot;. However, the following day FOTA and the FIA reached an agreement with Mosley agreeing not to stand for re-election as part of the deal: &#x27;now there is peace&#x27;. Luca di Montezemolo welcomed Mosley&#x27;s decision to stand down and called Mosley a &#x27;dictator&#x27;. Mosley responded by saying that he was still considering his &#x27;options&#x27; and might well stand for re-election in October after all. He later said that he was &quot;under pressure from all over the world&quot; to stand for re-election. On 15 July, Mosley confirmed that he would after all stand down, and again endorsed former Ferrari Executive Director Jean Todt as his successor. Todt subsequently became president.

==Sex scandal and further legal issues==
In 2008, Mosley won a court case (&quot;Mosley v News Group Newspapers&quot;) against the &quot;News of the World&quot; newspaper which had reported his involvement in what they said was a Nazi-themed sex act involving five women, on the grounds that it had breached his privacy. Justice Eady ruled that, despite one of the attendees wearing a military uniform, there were no Nazi connotations to the orgy. As a result, in 2009 Mosley brought a case (&quot;Mosley v United Kingdom&quot;) against the UK&#x27;s privacy laws in the European Court of Human Rights, in a bid to force newspapers to warn people before exposing their private lives so they could have the opportunity to seek a court injunction. The case was rejected by the court on 10 May 2011 as they argued that a &quot;pre-notification requirement would inevitably affect political reporting and serious journalism.&quot; 
In July 2011, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Mosley was financially guaranteeing the court costs of claimants who may have been subjected to phone hacking by the &quot;News of the World&quot;. Mosley refused to comment at the time, but he later gave a television interview to the BBC and a telephone interview to Reuters where he confirmed the story.
Mosley launched legal action against Google, in an attempt to stop searches from returning web pages which use the photographs from the video used for the &quot;News of the World&quot; story. On 6 November 2013, in Mosley v SARL Google, a French court sided with Mosley and ordered Google to prevent its search engine from providing links to images of Mosley engaging in sexual activities from the video. &quot;The Register&quot; suggested the ruling would lead to a Streisand effect, increasing interest in the images, which are still findable through other search engines. At the Leveson Inquiry, Mosley stated his reasons for pursuing Google:

Mosley launched similar legal action against Google in Germany. In January 2014, the German court also ruled against the American company. In giving its verdict, the court stated, &quot;that the banned pictures of the plaintiff severely violate his private sphere.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; following the judgement, Mosley said: &quot;Strictly speaking Google has got to obey German courts in Germany and French courts in France. But in the end it has to decide whether it wants to live in a democracy. Google behaves like an adolescent rebelling against the establishment. The company has to recognise that it is a part of society and it must accept the responsibility which comes with that.&quot; Mosley then launched proceedings against Google in the UK. All the cases were eventually settled in May 2015.

In late February 2018, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; reported that Mosley had published a leaflet in the early 1960s linking black immigration to the spread of diseases, the implication being that Mosley had committed perjury in the High Court when giving evidence in his libel case against the &quot;News of the World&quot;. In an interview with Cathy Newman on &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;, he conceded that a passage in the leaflet &quot;probably is racist&quot;, which he denied ever publishing, and rejected the accusation he had lied in court. The following day, the Labour Party said it would not accept any further donations from Mosley, including further support for the office of deputy leader Tom Watson; Mosley had donated £500,000 in total to Watson&#x27;s office. Asked what he would do about the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;″s publication of its article, Mosley said what happened next was, &quot;entirely in the hands of my lawyers&quot;.

In December 2020, it was announced that the High Court had rejected Mosley&#x27;s legal action against the publisher of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for sending a which suggested that he had lied under oath to prosecutors. Justice Matthew Nicklin wrote that &quot;The claimant&#x27;s pleaded claim discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing his claim for malicious prosecution.&quot; In fact, no prosecution had taken place.

In 2009, audio from the alleged recorded session was used on the 16 Bit song &quot;M Dot Mosley&quot; as reference to the scandal.

==Death==
Mosley died by suicide on 23 May 2021 after developing cancer, with the news being confirmed by Bernie Ecclestone. He was 81. He was buried next to his mother in St. Mary&#x27;s Churchyard, Swinbrook, Oxfordshire. His wife Jean died later in 2021 aged 81 and was buried with him.

On 29 March 2022, an inquest into his death confirmed that Mosley was found with a fatal gunshot wound to his head. Mosley had been told that he had just &quot;weeks&quot; to live and told his personal assistant of 20 years that he was going to take his own life the day before he did so.

<text>The Holy Loch () is a sea loch, part of the Firth of Clyde, in Argyll and Bute, Scotland.

The &quot;Holy Loch&quot; name is believed to date from the 6th century, when Saint Munn landed there after leaving Ireland. Kilmun Parish Church and Argyll Mausoleum is said to stand where Saint Munn&#x27;s church was once located.

Robertson&#x27;s Yard at Sandbank, a village on the loch, was a major wooden boat building company in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

During World War II, the loch was used as a British Royal Navy submarine base. From 1961 to 1992, it was used as a United States Navy ballistic missile submarine base. In 1992, the Holy Loch base was deemed unnecessary following the demise of the Soviet Union and subsequently closed.

==Geography==
Open on the Firth of Clyde at its eastern end, the loch is approximately wide and between long, varying with the tide. Dunoon on the Cowal peninsula lies on the shores of the Clyde just to the south of the loch, and houses continue round the villages of Kirn, Hunters Quay, Ardnadam and past Lazaretto Point, the village of Sandbank, with open countryside at the end of the loch, then on the northern shore Kilmun, and at Strone Point the village of Strone continues on the western shore of the Firth of Clyde, almost joining Blairmore on Loch Long.

All the villages used to have piers served by Clyde steamers, and now Western Ferries runs between Hunters Quay and McInroy&#x27;s Point on the outskirts of Gourock, while the Argyll Ferries service runs from Dunoon to Gourock pierhead. At the end of the loch, the A815 (after being joined by the A880 at Ardbeg) leads north, to the east of the River Eachaig, to the Benmore Botanic Garden and Arboretum (also known as the Younger Botanic Gardens), Loch Eck and on towards Inveraray.

==History==

===Medieval period===
On the shore of the Holy Loch at Kilmun (Gaelic &quot;Cill Mhunnu&quot;, &#x27;the church of St Munnu&#x27;) stands a nineteenth-century church. It stands on the site of a sequence of earlier churches, and an early carved stone on the site suggests that there was a church here perhaps as early as the sixth or seventh century. The dedication to St Munnu, otherwise known as Fintan, St Munn (Fintán of Taghmon), reflects devotion to an Irish saint who founded a church at Taghmon in Leinster. The remains of a 12th-century church are still visible at Kilmun. At the present site of Kilmun Church, a church building is recorded in the 13th century. By the 15th century, the significance of Kilmun as a local centre of Christianity was so great that the adjacent loch became known as the &quot;Holy Loch&quot;, and the powerful Clan Campbell adopted it as their spiritual home. From the 14th century, Dunoon Castle, a short distance away, was held by the Campbell family and in the 1440s Sir Duncan Campbell of Lochawe (later 1st Lord Campbell), the then chief of the clan, lived near Kilmun in a private residence named Strathechaig.

===Modern history===
====Robertson&#x27;s Yard====

Alexander Robertson started repairing boats in a small workshop at Sandbank in 1876, and Alexander Robertson &amp; Sons went on to become one of the foremost wooden boat builders on the Clyde. Their &#x27;golden years&#x27; were in the early 20th century when they started building classic 12 &amp; 15 metre racing yachts. Robertsons was chosen to build the first 15-metre yacht designed by William Fife (&quot;Shimna&quot;, 1907). More than 55 boats were built by Robertsons in preparation for the First World War and the yard remained busy even during the Great Depression in the 1930s, as many wealthy businessmen developed a passion for yacht racing. During World War II the yard was devoted to Admiralty work, producing a wide range of large high speed Fairmile Marine Motor Boats (MTBs and MGBs).

After the war the yard built the successful one-class Loch Longs and two 12-metre challengers for the America&#x27;s Cup: &quot;Sceptre&quot; (1958) (17 tonnes) and &quot;Sovereign&quot; (1964). The Robertson family sold the yard in 1965, and it was turned over to GRP production work (mainly Pipers and Etchells). During its 104-year history, Robertson&#x27;s Yard built 500 boats, many of which are still sailing. The yard ceased trading in the early 1980s; at this point it was owned by Terry Hooper who ran the yard servicing mostly the US Navy. After the US navy packed up and left the area Hooper sold the yard in the 1990s. The site has since been converted to residential building and the new Holy Loch Marina development. The yard today is still widely known in the area as &#x27;Hooper&#x27;s Yard&#x27;.

====World War II====
During World War II the loch was used by the Royal Navy as a submarine base, served by the depot ship . The loch was used extensively for trials and exercises by Royal Navy submarines during the war, the submarines and were lost in the Clyde after being sunk by accidents during exercises. &quot;Untamed&quot; was later salvaged.

Near the Holy Loch an anti-submarine boom was constructed between Dunoon and the Cloch Point Lighthouse to defend waters from German U-boats.

====US Navy at Holy Loch====


Between 1961 and 1992, Holy Loch was the site of the United States Navy&#x27;s Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) Refit Site One. It was the home base of Submarine Squadron (SUBRON) 14, part of Submarine Force, US Atlantic Fleet. To make maximum use of its submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) force, the American military had determined that it required an overseas base for refit and crew turnover. Negotiations with the British government began in March 1959 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower mentioned the need to British prime minister Harold Macmillan at a meeting at Camp David.

Holy Loch was one of several locations on or near the Firth of Clyde considered for the refit site. Others were Faslane, the channel between Largs and Cumbrae, Rosneath Bay, and Rothesay Bay. Site selection criteria included the requirements for a sheltered anchorage, relative proximity to an international airport, and sufficient shore facilities to provide housing for military personnel and their families. Agreement for the use of Holy Loch was reached near the end of 1960 and the arrival of the first tender, scheduled for December. Divisions within the British government and concerns about protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) caused her arrival to be rescheduled to 3 March 1961. Protests at the site followed.

Between 1961 and 1982, the Naval Support Activity ashore was administered by US Naval Activities London. In 1982, Naval Support Activity (NAVSUPPACT), Forward Base, Holy Loch, Scotland became its own command. NAVSUPPACT ultimately managed 42 facilities and leased 342 housing units for Navy personnel and their dependents.

Holy Loch&#x27;s most prosperous period occurred with the naval base and its 3,000 Americans. A monument was built to the US Navy years in the Castle Gardens, Dunoon.

Over the years, five different submarine tenders and one floating dry dock served in the loch.

Two notable incidents occurred during the three-decade long deployment of SUBRON 14 at Holy Loch. On 29 November 1970, a fire erupted on USS &quot;Canopus&quot;, killing three of her complement. Almost four years later, on 3 November 1974, the nuclear ballistic missile submarine USS &quot;James Madison&quot; (SSBN-627) collided with a Soviet submarine, assumed to be a Victor-class nuclear-powered attack submarine, during a dive just after departing from Holy Loch. The American submarine was dented and suffered a nine-foot scratch on her hull. She spent a full week at the base for inspection and repairs.

Laurel Clark, known to her shipmates as &quot;Doc Salton&quot;, was assigned as the Radiation Health Officer and Undersea Medical Officer at SUBRON 14. Clark was one of the astronauts killed in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster on 1 February 2003.

New technologies and the end of the Cold War led to the base being deemed unnecessary. The last submarine tender to be based there, the , left Holy Loch in November 1991, ahead of the base closing the following June. The closing of the base caused significant economic decline.

<doc id="606213" wikidata="Q2061526" url="?curid=606213" title="Paul Nitze">
<text>Paul Henry Nitze (January 16, 1907 – October 19, 2004) was an American businessman and government official who served as United States Deputy Secretary of Defense, U.S. Secretary of the Navy, and Director of Policy Planning for the U.S. State Department. He is best known for being the principal author of NSC 68 and the co-founder of Team B. He helped shape U.S. Cold War defense policy over the course of numerous presidential administrations.

==Early life, education and family==
Nitze was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, the son of Anina Sophia (Hilken), a homemaker, and William Albert Nitze, a professor of Romance linguistics who concluded his career at the University of Chicago. His parents were both of German descent. His ancestors came from the region of Magdeburg in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. In his memoir, &quot;From Hiroshima to Glasnost&quot;, Paul Nitze describes how as a young boy he witnessed the outbreak of World War I while he was traveling in Germany with his father, mother, and sister, arriving in Munich just in time to be struck by the city crowds&#x27; patriotic enthusiasm for the imminent conflict.

Nitze attended The Hotchkiss School, where he was a member of the class of 1924 and the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. He graduated from Harvard University in 1928 and entered the field of investment banking.

In 1928 and 1929, the Chicago brokerage firm of Bacon, Whipple and Company sent Nitze to Europe. Upon his return, he heard Clarence Dillon predict the Great Depression and the decline of the importance of finance. Having attained financial independence through the sale to Revlon of his interest in a French laboratory producing pharmaceutical products in the United States, Nitze took an intellectual sabbatical that included a year of graduate study at Harvard in sociology, philosophy, and constitutional and international law. In 1929 he joined investment bank Dillon, Read &amp; Co. where he remained until founding his own firm, P. H. Nitze &amp; Co, in 1938. He returned to Dillon, Read as Vice-President from 1939 through to 1941.

In 1932, he married Phyllis Pratt, daughter of John Teele Pratt, a Standard Oil financier, and of Ruth Baker Pratt, Republican Congresswoman for New York. She died in 1987. They had four children: Heidi, Peter, William, and Phyllis Anina (Nina). The journalist Nicholas Thompson, who wrote a biography of Nitze and George F. Kennan, is his grandson. He was married to Elisabeth Scott Porter from 1993 until his death in 2004.

Nitze&#x27;s brother-in-law, Walter Paepcke, founded the Aspen Institute and Aspen Skiing Company. Nitze continued to ski in Aspen until well into his 80s.

==Government career==
Nitze entered government service during World War II after having been hired by his Wall Street colleague James Forrestal when Forrestal became an administrative assistant to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1942, he became finance director of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, working for Nelson Rockefeller. In 1943 he became chief of the Metals and Minerals Branch of the Board of Economic Warfare, until he was named director, Foreign Procurement and Development Branch of the Foreign Economic Administration later that year. From 1944 to 1946, Nitze served as director and then as Vice Chairman of the &quot;Strategic Bombing Survey&quot; for which President Harry S. Truman awarded him the Legion of Merit. One of his early government assignments was to visit Allied-occupied Japan in the immediate aftermath of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and assess the damage. This experience framed many of his later feelings about the power of nuclear weapons and the necessity of arms control.

In the early postwar era and Cold War, he served in the Truman Administration as Director of Policy Planning for the State Department (1950–1953). He was also the principal author in 1950 of the highly influential but secret National Security Council policy paper, NSC 68, which provided the strategic outline for increased US expenditures to counter the perceived threat of Soviet armament. During the Korean War, he advised the Truman administration against blaming the Soviet Union for the conflict too directly in order to avoid risking an escalation to World War III.

From 1953 to 1961, Nitze served as president of the Foreign Service Educational Foundation while concurrently serving as associate of the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research and the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of the Johns Hopkins University. In 1956 he attended the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons.

Nitze co-founded the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) with Christian Herter in 1943 and the world-renowned graduate school, based in Washington, D.C., is named in his honor. His publications during this period include &quot;U.S. Foreign Policy: 1945–1955&quot;. In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Nitze Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. In 1963, Nitze became the Secretary of the Navy, serving until 1967. According to the US Navy &quot;as the Navy secretary, he raised the level of attention given to quality of Service issues. His many achievements included establishing the first Personnel Policy Board and retention task force (the Alford Board), and obtaining targeted personnel bonuses. He lengthened commanding officer tours and raised command responsibility pay.&quot;

Following his term as Secretary of the Navy, he served as Deputy Secretary of Defense (1967–1969), as a member of the US delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) (1969–1973). Later, fearing Soviet rearmament, he opposed the ratification of SALT II (1979).

Paul Nitze was a cofounder of Team B, a 1970s intelligence think tank that challenged the National Intelligence Estimates provided by the CIA. The Team B reports became the intellectual foundation for the idea of &quot;the window of vulnerability&quot; and of the massive arms buildup that began toward the end of the Carter administration and accelerated under President Ronald Reagan. Team B came to the conclusion that the Soviets had developed new weapons of mass destruction and had aggressive strategies with regard to a potential nuclear war. Team B&#x27;s analysis of Soviet weapon systems was later believed to be largely exaggerated.

According to Anne Cahn of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (1977–1980), &quot;if you go through most of Team B&#x27;s specific allegations about weapons systems, and you just examine them one by one, they were all wrong.&quot; Nonetheless, some still claim that its conclusions about Soviet strategical aims were largely proven to be true, but this hardly squares with the elevation of Gorbachev in 1985.
Nitze was President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s chief negotiator of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (1981–1984). In 1984, Nitze was named Special Advisor to the President and Secretary of State on Arms Control.

For more than forty years, Nitze was one of the chief architects of US policy toward the Soviet Union.

==Awards and honors==
In 1985 President Reagan awarded Nitze the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contributions to the freedom and security of the United States.

In 1986, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 1989, Nitze received the US Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

In 1991, he was awarded the prestigious United States Military Academy&#x27;s Sylvanus Thayer Award for his commitment to the Academy&#x27;s ideals of &quot;Duty, Honor, Country&quot;.[6]

In 1997, Nitze was awarded the Naval Heritage Award by the US Navy Memorial Foundation for his support of the US Navy while he was Secretary of the Navy.

==Death and legacy==
Nitze died in Washington, D.C., at age 97 in October 2004.

<doc id="606215" wikidata="Q7647451" url="?curid=606215" title="Sus law">
<text>In England and Wales, the sus law (from &quot;suspected person&quot;) was a stop and search law that permitted a police officer to stop, search and potentially arrest people on suspicion of them being in breach of section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824. According to a 2018 study in the &quot;British Journal of Criminology&quot;, stop and search had a marginal impact on crime in the UK.

==1824 legislation==
The power to act on suspicion was found in part of section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824, which provided that:

Upon conviction, a person arrested under the law could be imprisoned for up to three months. This effectively permitted the police to stop and search, and even arrest, anyone found in a public place if they suspected that they intended to commit an offence.

In order to bring a prosecution under the act, the police had to prove that the defendant had committed two acts:
* the first, that established them as a &quot;suspected person&quot; (by acting suspiciously), and
* the second, that provided intent to commit an arrestable offence.

Two witnesses were required to substantiate the charge, which were usually two police officers patrolling together.

===1970s and 1980s===
The law caused much discontent among certain sections of the population, particularly black and ethnic minorities, against whom the law was particularly targeted by the police. The sus law had attracted considerable controversy prior to the early 1980s race riots (in St Pauls, Bristol, in 1980, and in Brixton, London; Toxteth, Liverpool; Handsworth, Birmingham; and Chapeltown, Leeds in 1981).

This led to campaigns against the law including the &quot;Scrap Sus&quot; campaign led by Mavis Best and Paul Boateng.

When questioned on the topic in 1980, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir David McNee stated that the reason for its disproportionate use on black people was because they were &quot;over-represented in offences of robbery and other violent theft&quot;.

In 1980, the House of Commons&#x27; Sub-Committee on Race Relations and Immigration began hearings into the law. In the case of the race riots, the alleged abusive use of the sus law was believed to be a contributory factor to those events. The sus law was repealed on 27 August 1981, on the advice of the 1979 Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure, when the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 received Royal Assent.

==2007 legislation==
Subsequent British legislation that makes provision for the police to act on the basis of suspicion alone has been denounced as &quot;another sus law&quot; by opponents of proposals to grant increased &quot;stop and question&quot; powers to police officers in England and Wales.

In 2007, then-Northern Ireland minister Peter Hain said he wanted to see the details of the policy before making any judgement; however, Hain told BBC 1&#x27;s Sunday AM: &quot;We cannot have a reincarnation of the old &#x27;sus&#x27; laws under which mostly black people, ethnic minorities, were literally stopped on sight and that created a really bad atmosphere and an erosion of civil liberties.&quot;

In January 2008, David Cameron, at the time Conservative leader of the opposition, announced that he would, if elected, seek to return similar powers to the police. Under Conservative proposals, police sergeants would be able to authorise the use of stop and search of pedestrians and vehicles in a specific area for up to six hours, or 48 hours if permission was granted by a senior officer. Gordon Brown, then-Labour prime minister, announced in response that he would seek to remove the lengthy forms that are currently required for &#x27;stop and searches&#x27;.

<doc id="606218" wikidata="Q167269" url="?curid=606218" title="Patrick Head">
<text>Sir Patrick Michael Head (born 5 June 1946) is a British motorsport executive who is the co-founder and former Engineering Director of the Williams Formula One team. For 27 years starting from the season, Head was technical director at Williams Grand Prix Engineering, and responsible for many innovations within Formula One. Head oversaw the design and construction of Williams cars until May 2004 when his role was handed over to Sam Michael.

==Early career==

Patrick Head was born into motor sport, his father Michael racing Jaguar sportscars in the 1950s, and was privately educated at Wellington College. After leaving school, Head joined the Royal Navy but soon realised that a career in the military was not how he wanted to spend his life and so left to attend university, first in Birmingham and later, after failing his first year exams, at UCL.

Head graduated in 1970 with a Mechanical Engineering degree and immediately joined the chassis manufacturer Lola in Huntingdon. Here he formed a friendly relationship with John Barnard, whose Formula One designs for McLaren, Benetton and Ferrari would later go on to compete against Williams. Head was involved in a number of new projects all trying to become established as car builders or engineering companies and it was during this period that Head and Frank Williams met. Finally becoming disillusioned by his lack of success Head quit motor racing to work on building boats, but was lured back by Williams to join his team, which Head did during 1975.

In 1976, thirty-four-year-old Frank Williams decided that the time was right to re-form his own team and promptly set about luring Head back into Formula One. After one abortive attempt, on 8 February 1977 Williams Grand Prix Engineering was founded with Williams and Head taking seventy and thirty per cent of the company respectively. In the team raced a customer March chassis, but in , with backing from Saudi Airlines and having signed Australian driver Alan Jones, the Head-designed FW06 made its first appearance. Despite having no money, and with Williams himself frequently forced to conduct business from a telephone box, Head still managed to design a respectable car.

The following season Williams scored 11 world championship points finishing 9th in the constructors championship and from here momentum began to build. As early as the fourth round of the season Jones made the team&#x27;s first visit to the podium. The same year saw a Head-designed car take the first of over one-hundred race wins when Swiss driver Clay Regazzoni won the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Four more victories followed in 1979 and Head was now an established Grand Prix car designer.

==1980s==
Head&#x27;s car was the class of the field, taking Alan Jones and the team to both titles, and securing Williams as a front runner. More success followed in the 1980s and Head began to move away from designing the cars himself, effectively creating a role of Technical Director, a person who oversaw the processes of design, construction, racing and testing, bringing together all the different disciplines. Frank Dernie took over as chief designer. During the 1980s he is also credited with many revolutionary concepts including a six-wheeled car, which tested in 1982, and continuously variable transmission, which replaced the car&#x27;s conventional gearbox and allowed the engine to remain at optimum RPM during the entire lap. Neither system made it into racing due to rule changes, which many attribute to pressure from other teams, who were worried about the time required to develop similar systems of their own.

In 1986, Head, with other Williams management, was forced to assume control of the team when Frank Williams was seriously injured in a road accident. Despite this diversion, and under Head&#x27;s temporary stewardship, the team still secured the constructors titles in and both the constructors&#x27; and drivers title (with Nelson Piquet) in .

==1990s==
In 1990, Williams hired Adrian Newey, recently sacked as technical director of Leyton House Racing. The two engineers rapidly formed the outstanding design partnership of the 1990s with Head/Newey cars achieving a level of dominance never seen before, and not repeated until the Ferrari/Schumacher era a decade later. In a seven-year period between 1991 and 1997, Williams had fifty-nine race wins, won five constructors titles, and four different drivers won world championships. Newey also had ambitions to succeed to technical director; this was blocked as Head was a founder and shareholder of the team. With Williams securing both the drivers and constructors titles in 1996, McLaren managed to lure Newey away, although he was forced to take gardening leave for the 1997 season.

==2000s==
Since the departure of Newey, Williams often appeared a spent force, able to win occasionally, but unable to mount a consistent challenge. During the dominant Ferrari/Schumacher period from 2000–2004, Williams managed to finish runner-up in the constructors championship in 2002 and 2003, and 2003 was the closest that one of their drivers, Juan Pablo Montoya, got to the world title.

In 2004, Head moved to the position of Director of Engineering, as Sam Michael became Technical Director. After Head&#x27;s move, Williams&#x27;s decline continued and following Montoya&#x27;s win at the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix, they entered a lengthy period without a Grand Prix victory ended by Pastor Maldonado winning the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix.

==2010s==
In 2012, Head resigned from his position in the Williams team. He continued his involvement in Williams Hybrid Power Limited until it was sold to GKN in April 2014. In 2015, he received a knighthood for his services to motorsport. In March 2019, Head returned to Williams Racing for the first time in eight years. He returned in a consultancy role.

==Ayrton Senna accident==

In April 2007, the Italian newspaper &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; reported that a court in Bologna had concluded that a technical failure was responsible for Ayrton Senna&#x27;s fatal accident at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994. Under Italian law, the responsibility for such an accident has to be proved but no action was taken against Head or Williams&#x27; Chief Designer Adrian Newey, neither of whom attended the court hearing. The court&#x27;s findings were made public 13 years after the accident and the case was closed.

On 13 April 2007, the Italian Court of Appeal stated the following in the verdict numbered 15050: &quot;It has been determined that the accident was caused by a steering column failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control.&quot; Even being found responsible for Senna&#x27;s accident, Head was not arrested because in Italy the statute of limitation for manslaughter is 7 years and 6 months, and the final verdict was pronounced 13 years after the accident.

==Honours==
In 2002, Head was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng). In the 2015 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Head was appointed a Knight Bachelor &quot;for services to Motorsport&quot;.

<text>The Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge is a United States National Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Alaska whose use is regulated as an ecological-protection measure. It stretches along the southern coast of the Alaska Peninsula, between the Becharof National Wildlife Refuge on its east and the end of the peninsula at False Pass in the west. In between, however, it is broken into sections by lands of the Aniakchak National Monument and Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge is administered from offices in King Salmon, Alaska and was established to conserve Alaska Peninsula brown bears, caribou, moose, marine mammals, shorebirds, other migratory birds and fish, and to comply with treaty obligations.

==History==

The refuge was established on December 2, 1980, by the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act (ANILCA) following designation as a national wildlife monument in 1978 by the then President Jimmy Carter. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1983, the Fish and Wildlife Service undertook the responsibility to manage the Becharof Refuge, along with the Ugashik and Chignik units of the Becharof National Wildlife Refuge.

In 1989 the park area was affected by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill which devastated the Alaska Peninsula.

In an effort to determine species presence, distribution, habitat use, and migratory patterns, extensive
studies have been conducted in the refuge. Biologists have studied extensively in the biologically rich Naknek River basin which provides an important habitat for thousands of ducks, geese and swans. From mid-March through mid-May, refuge biologists monitor waterfowl from established points from Naknek Lake to Kvichak Bay in Naknek. Biologists have been working in the area since 1992 to count waterfowl by species approximately four times a week.

Species common to the refuge include common merganser, common goldeneye, tundra swan, greater white-fronted goose, mallard, northern pintail, American and Eurasian wigeon, American green-winged teal, Canada goose, greater scaup, northern shoveler, red-breasted merganser, black scoter, and long-tailed duck. Working with Boreal Partners in Flight, the Institute for Bird Populations (IBP), and Earthwatch, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service undertook comprehensive landbird studies at Mother Goose Lake from 1994 through to 2001.

Between 1994 and 1999 over 110 Earthwatch volunteers used the scheme to educate themselves in bird biology. In conjunction with the National Audubon Society, the park has also hosted an annual Christmas Bird Count between December 14 and January 5 annually since 1986 to register birds in the corridor from the Kvichak Bay beach at Naknek to Lake Camp at the mouth of Naknek Lake. The refuge has sponsored a North American Migration Count on the second Saturday in May since 1998.

==Geography==

The refuge covers an area of and lies in the Alaska Peninsula. It spans Aleutians East Borough, Kodiak Island and Lake and Peninsula Borough. The Alaska Peninsula Refuge contains a number of geologic and scenic features, with a mixture of volcanic activity juxtaposed alongside glacial valleys and coasts under erosion.

The refuge contains the Chiginagak and Veniaminof volcanoes, the latter of which is one of Alaska’s active volcanoes, and last erupted in 1995. The crater which is approximately in diameter contains a ice field, making it the most extensive crater glacier in North America. In 1967, Mount Veniaminof was designated as a National Natural Landmark. The Upper Sandy River has its source at Mount Veniaminof and flows down to form a delta above Sandy Lake.

In contrast to the volcanic landscape of the refuge, the Pacific coast of the protected area is characterised by rugged cliffs, bays, fjords, and streams. In particular the Castle Cape Fjords in the Chignik area is an extremely pronounced feature, with a strong erosion by the sea, with rocks shaded in contrasting dark and light tones. Notable streams drain into Agripina Bay and Port Wrangell from the glaciers and through the valleys of the refuge.

==Wildlife==
The refuge supports a diversity of fish and wildlife and is an important nesting site for seabirds such as puffins, cormorants, kittiwakes, and guillemots, emperor geese, harlequin ducks, Steller&#x27;s eider, and notably the bald eagle. 
All five species of Pacific salmon spawn including the commercially productive sockeye salmon run into the Chignik system. Sea lions, gray whales, harbor seals and sea otters can all be found along the coast. Alaskan brown bears are a common sight in the coastal meadows in spring and summer when they come to feed on the spawning salmon. Often as many as 500 bears may inhabit the Black Lake-Chignik Lake Area during August, making it one of the most dense seasonal concentrations of grizzly bears in North America. Caribou and moose are also under protection in the park. The moose in particular inhabit the Mother Goose Lake and the lines of the King Salmon River, also supporting populations of wolf packs, beaver, wolverine, river otter, two species of fox, snowshoe hare and Canadian lynx.

<text>World Museum is a large museum in Liverpool, England which has extensive collections covering archaeology, ethnology and the natural and physical sciences. Special attractions include the Natural History Centre and a planetarium. Entry to the museum is free. The museum is part of National Museums Liverpool.

==History==
The current museum is unconnected to the Liverpool Museum of William Bullock, who operated a museum in his house on Church Street, Liverpool, between 1795 and 1809, before he moved it to London.

The museum was originally started as the Derby Museum as it comprised the 13th Earl of Derby&#x27;s natural history collection. It opened in 1851, sharing two rooms on Duke Street with a library. However, the museum proved extremely popular and a new, purpose-built building was required.

Land for the new building, on a street then known as Shaw&#x27;s Brow (now William Brown Street), opposite St George&#x27;s Hall, was donated by a local MP and wealthy merchant, Sir William Brown, as was much of the funding for the building which would be known as the William Brown Library and Museum. Around 400,000 people attended the opening of the new building in 1860.

Reports detailing the museum&#x27;s activities and acquisitions were presented to the committee of the borough, city and corporation of Liverpool annually.

In the late 19th century, the museum&#x27;s collection was beginning to outgrow its building so a competition was launched to design a combined extension to the museum and college of technology. The competition was won by Edward William Mountford and the College of Technology and Museum Extension opened in 1901.

Liverpool, being one of the UK&#x27;s major ports, was heavily damaged by German bombing during the blitz. While much of the museum&#x27;s collection was moved to less vulnerable locations during the war, the museum building was struck by German firebombs and suffered heavy damage. Parts of the museum only began to reopen fifteen years later. One of the exhibits destroyed in 1941 was the little yawl &quot;City of Ragusa&quot;, which twice crossed the Atlantic in 1870 and 1871 with a crew of two men.

The museum underwent a £35 million refurbishment in 2005 in order to double the size of the display spaces and make more of the collections accessible for visitors. A central entrance hall and six-storey atrium were created as part of the work. Major new galleries included &quot;World Cultures&quot;, the &quot;Bug House&quot; and the &quot;Weston Discovery Centre&quot;. On reopening the museum&#x27;s name was changed again to World Museum.

==Collections and exhibits==
===Astronomy, space and time===
The physical sciences collection of World Museum was built after the devastation caused by the incendiary fire of 1941. The collection has expanded, in part, due to transfers from the Decorative Arts Department, Regional History Department, Walker Art Gallery and the Prescot Museum. The collection also contains several significant collections from the Liverpool Royal Institution, Bidston Observatory, later the Proudman Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, and the Physics Department of the University of Liverpool.

Collections such as these are often made up of items of a singular type designed for a particular experiment such as DELPHI or LEP at CERN – the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or the Equatorium, a post-Copernican planetary calculator made to special order in the early 17th century. As a consequence the collection is small but contains a number of significant items.

==== Planetarium ====
World Museum is home to a planetarium. The planetarium, said to be the first planetarium in the UK outside of London, opened in 1970 and has 62 seats. It currently attracts about 90,000 people per year. Shows cover various aspects of space science, including the Solar System and space exploration; there are also special children&#x27;s shows.

==== Archaeology and Egyptology ====
The archaeological collection includes many fine British objects, including the Anglo-Saxon Kingston brooch and Liudhard medalet, with other objects from the Canterbury-St Martin&#x27;s hoard.

The Egyptian antiquities collection contains approximately 15,000 objects from Egypt and Sudan and is the most important single component of the Antiquities department&#x27;s collections. The chronological range of the collection spans from the Prehistoric to the Islamic Period with the largest archaeological site collections being Abydos, Amarna, Beni Hasan, Esna and Meroe.

Over 5,000 Egyptian antiquities were donated to the museum in 1867 by Joseph Mayer (1803–1886), a local goldsmith and antiquarian. Mayer purchased collections from Joseph Sams of Darlington (which contained material from the Henry Salt sale in 1835), Lord Valentia, Bram Hertz, the Reverend Henry Stobart, and the heirs of the Rev. Bryan Faussett. Mayer had displayed his collection in his own ‘Egyptian Museum’ in Liverpool with a purpose of giving citizens who were unable to visit the British Museum in London some idea of the achievements of the Egyptian civilization. On the strength of this substantial donation other people began to donate Egyptian material to the museum, and by the later years of the 19th century the museum had a substantial collection that Amelia Edwards described as being the most important collection of Egyptian antiquities in England next to the contents of the British Museum.

The quality of the Mayer donation is high and there are some outstanding items, but with a few exceptions the entire collection is unprovenanced. The collection was systematically enhanced through subscription to excavations in Egypt. Altogether the museum subscribed to 25 excavations carried out by the Egypt Exploration Fund (now Egypt Exploration Society), the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, and the Egyptian Research Account between 1884 and 1914. It was further developed through links with the Institute of Archaeology at Liverpool University and important collections came to the museum from the excavations of John Garstang who was honorary reader in Egyptian archaeology at Liverpool University, 1902–1907, and Professor of Methods and Practice of Archaeology, 1907–1941. The museum has always had a close relationship with the university; in the early 1920s Percy Newberry, Brunner Professor of Egyptology, and his successor T. Eric Peet, catalogued the collection, assisted with the rearrangement of the displays, and produced a handbook and guide to the Egyptian collection (1st ed., 1923).

In May 1941, at the height of the Liverpool Blitz, a bomb fell on the museum, which was burnt to a shell. Large parts of the collection had been removed at the outbreak of the war, but much remained on display or in store and many artefacts were destroyed. What remained was quite inaccessible and it was not until 1976 that a permanent Egypt gallery was opened in the rebuilt museum. Following the war the museum actively augmented the collection through collecting of new material from excavations in Egypt and Sudan and the purchase of other museum collections. In 1947 and 1949 the material from Garstang&#x27;s excavations at Meroe came to the museum, and in 1955 Liverpool University placed substantial amounts from its own collections within the museum, including many items from Beni Hasan and Abydos. In 1956 the museum purchased almost the entire non-British collections of the Norwich Castle Museum. This included EES excavated material from Amarna and other sites, botanical remains from Kahun and the private collection of Sir Henry Rider Haggard. In 1973 the collection was increased further by the acquisition of part of the Sir Henry Wellcome Collection, and by the bequest of Colonel J. R. Danson in 1976, which included more material from Amarna and from Garstang&#x27;s excavations at Abydos.

Postwar a limited Egyptian gallery was opened in 1976 before being expanded in 2008. The gallery between September 2015 and April 2017 to allow it to be improved and expanded.

A handy lavishly illustrated guide to the collection is available: &quot;Gifts of the Nile&quot; (London: HMSO, 1995).

==== Ethnology ====

The ethnology collection at World Museum ranks among the top six collections in the country. The four main areas represented are: Africa, the Americas, Oceania and Asia. The exhibition includes interactive displays.

=== Natural history ===
In the Natural World area can be seen a range of exhibits, including live colonies of insects and historic zoological and botanical exhibits. Visitors can examine the collections up close in the award-winning Clore Natural History Centre, where there are interactive displays.

World Museum&#x27;s natural history collection is divided into the Botany, Entomology and other Invertebrates, Geology and Vertebrate Zoology collections.

==== Vertebrate zoology ====
The 13th Earl of Derby founded the original museum with a major donation of zoological specimens in 1851, including many rare and &#x27;type&#x27; specimens, the ones that act as standards for the species, animals that died in the Knowsley menagerie, and specimens purchased at major sales (e.g. Leverian collection). The vertebrate zoology collection was vastly increased with the purchase of Canon Henry Baker Tristram&#x27;s collection of birds in 1896.

The reserve collection includes animals from famous naturalists such as Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, John James Audubon, William Thomas March, John Whitehead and Stamford Raffles, transfers from other museums (Selangor Museum, India Museum), circuses (Barnum and Bailey) and zoos (Southport Zoological Gardens, Chester Zoo); and collections from the museum&#x27;s expeditions.

There also specimens of several extinct species housed in the museum, including the Liverpool pigeon, the great auk (an egg), the Falkland Islands wolf, the South Island piopio, the Lord Howe swamphen, the Passenger pigeon, the dodo, the Pink-headed duck, the Norfolk kākā, the Stephens Island wren, the Bushwren, the Carolina Parakeet, the Cuban Macaw, the long-tailed hopping mouse and the thylacine.
The museum had extensive public galleries containing vertebrate taxidermy specimens, but these were lost when during the air raids of May 1941 the building was completely destroyed by fire. Some mammal specimens from the original 13th Earl of Derby collection did survive, along with most of the cabinet bird skins. The galleries featured an exhibition of British mammals, amphibians and reptiles, with several cases imaged in 1932.

The British Birds Gallery featured 131 cases, with several cases imaged between 1914 and 1932. These were the work of taxidermist Mr. J. W. Cutmore who would later produce a series of well-known dioramas at Norwich Museum.

The current natural history gallery is called &quot;Endangered Planet&quot; and features a limited number of taxidermy vertebrates in four diorama representing biomes, savanna, tropical rainforest, taiga, tundra. The gallery can be visited virtually.

==== Botany ====
The museum&#x27;s collections have grown considerably since then and now also include important botanical specimens dating back over 200 years, which represent most of Britain and Ireland&#x27;s native flora.

The museum had a gallery of economic botany which was destroyed during the air raids of May 1941.

==== Geology ====
The time tunnel gallery displays a series of models across geological time.

The geological collection at World Museum contains over 40,000 fossils as well as extensive rock and mineral collections. Each of these exhibits show information about the origins, structure and history of the planet earth.

Founded in 1858, only seven years after the museum&#x27;s establishment, much of the original collection was destroyed during the Second World War. The post-war collections have expanded considerably, thanks in part to the acquisition of several significant museum and university collections.

The largest of these was the University of Liverpool&#x27;s geological collection that includes some 6,600 fossil specimens. The collection covers the following areas: palaeontology, rocks and
minerals.

== Facial recognition system ==
Facial recognition technology, widespread in China, was used at Liverpool&#x27;s World Museum, during the China&#x27;s First Emperor and the Terracotta Warriors exhibition. The museum claimed the scanning equipment was used on the advice of local police (Merseyside Police), not the Chinese lenders. In a statement, the director of Big Brother Watch, Silkie Carlo, said that the &quot;authoritarian surveillance tool is rarely seen outside of China.&quot;

<text>The Curtain Theatre was an Elizabethan playhouse located in Hewett Street, Shoreditch (within the modern London Borough of Hackney), just outside the City of London. It opened in 1577, and continued staging plays until 1624.

The Curtain was built some south of London&#x27;s first playhouse, The Theatre, which had opened a year before, in 1576. It was called the &quot;Curtain&quot; because it was located near a plot of land called Curtain Close, which derived its name in turn from its proximity to the walls of Holywell Priory, a curtain wall being a section of wall between two bastions. (The name bears no relationship to the front curtain associated with modern theatres.) The remains of the theatre were rediscovered in archaeological excavations in 2012–16. The most significant revelation was that the Curtain was rectangular, not round. The excavation revealed a stage, and evidence of a tunnel under the stage and galleries at the first floor level. Small finds included a ceramic bird whistle; ceramic money boxes for collecting entry fees; beads probably used for decorating stage costumes; and a small statue of Bacchus.

== History ==
The Curtain Theatre was built in 1577 in Shoreditch, and was London&#x27;s second playhouse. The name derives from the curtain wall of the adjacent St John the Baptist Holywell monastery. Little is known of the companies that performed there, or of the plays they performed. The first clear mention of the Curtain is in 1584, when the City of London petitioned the parish of Shoreditch to shut down their playhouses. The proprietor appears to have been Henry Lanman, described as a &quot;gentleman&quot;: in 1585, Lanman made an agreement with the proprietor of the Theatre, James Burbage, to use the Curtain as a supplementary house, or &quot;easer,&quot; to the more prestigious older playhouse. From 1597 to 1599, it became the premier venue of Shakespeare&#x27;s Company, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, who had been forced to leave their former playing space at The Theatre after the latter closed in 1596. It was the venue of several of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, including &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (which, according to contemporary playwright John Marston in his satire &quot;Scourge of Villainy&quot; (1598), received &quot;Curtain plaudities&quot; there), &quot;Henry IV&quot; Part I and Part II. The Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men also performed Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot; here in 1598, with Shakespeare in the cast. Later that same year Jonson gained a certain notoriety by killing actor Gabriel Spencer in a duel in nearby Hoxton Fields.

The Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men departed the Curtain when the Globe Theatre, which they built to replace the Theatre, was ready for use in 1599. For seven years Henry Lanman (owner of the Curtain) had an agreement with James Burbage (owner of the Theatre) that all profit would be shared between them. This deal is how many believe Lanman was able to afford to open the Curtain, the rest is all very unclear. J. Leeds Barroll focuses in &quot;Shakespeare studies: An annual gathering of Research, Criticism and Reviews&quot; on the fact that Henry Lanman had offered the Curtain as an easer to James Burbage, proprietor of the Theatre. Thereby, he assumes that Lanman&#x27;s business, the Curtain, must have been doing as well as Burbage&#x27;s business, the Theatre, since both, Lanman and Burbage, had agreed on a pooling arrangement for seven years in 1585, to pool profits. As far as is known, Lanman ran the Curtain as a private concern for the first phase of its existence; he died in 1606 and it is assumed by Edmund Chambers that it had been re-arranged into a shareholder&#x27;s enterprise before his death at some point. Thomas Pope, one of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, owned a share in the Curtain and left it to his heirs in his last will and testament in 1603. King&#x27;s Men member John Underwood did the same in 1624. The fact that both of these shareholders belonged to Shakespeare&#x27;s company may indicate that the re-organization of the Curtain occurred when the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men were acting there; otherwise, it would have been very unwise of Burbage to pool profits if he was doing better in the first place. Thus, the suggestion is given that both proprietors were doing equal business. Burbage&#x27;s father James had shares in the theatre at the time of his death.

The London theatres, including the Curtain, were closed for much of the period from September 1592 to April 1594 due to outbreaks of bubonic plague. In 1597, people wrote to the local magistrates&#x27; court demanding that no plays take place at the Curtain or the Theatre that year. The Curtain was named in John Stow&#x27;s &quot;Survey of London&quot; in 1598, but was not listed in the 1603 edition. In 1600, the Privy Council tried unsuccessfully to shut down the Curtain theatre, and in 1603 the Curtain became the playhouse of Queen Anne&#x27;s Men (formerly known as Worcester&#x27;s Men, and formerly at the Rose Theatre, where they&#x27;d played Heywood&#x27;s &quot;A Woman Kill&#x27;d With Kindness&quot; in February of that year). In 1607, &quot;The Travels of the Three English Brothers,&quot; by Rowley, Day, and Wilkins, was performed at the Curtain.

The Curtain was in use from 1577 until at least 1624, after which its ultimate fate, and date of eventual closure, is not known, as there is no record of it after 1627.

== Site and rediscovery ==
The Curtain was believed to have been built near The Theatre, but the exact location was for many years unknown. However, a commemorative plaque was erected at 18 Hewett Street.

In 2012, archaeologists from MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology) announced that they had discovered the remains of the theatre during trial excavations. In 2013 plans were submitted to develop the site with a 40-storey tower of 400 apartments, plus a Shakespeare museum, 250-seat outdoor auditorium and park, with the archaeological remains visible in a glass enclosure.

In May 2016, excavators announced that the theatre was probably an adaptation of an existing structure, in the form of a rectangle measuring 22×25 metres, rather than being round or polygonal. Walls survived up to high in places; MOLA identified the courtyard, where theatregoers stood, and the inner walls, which held the galleries. The theatre had timber galleries with mid and upper areas for wealthier audience members, and a courtyard made from compacted gravel for those with less to spend. The galleries were straight.

Also uncovered was a fragmentary ceramic bird whistle, dating from the late 16th century. This raised the question of whether the bird whistle was merely a Tudor toy or a prop for plays that needed sound effects. In November 2016, a tunnel structure – accessed by doors on either end of the stage – was unearthed, which would have allowed actors to exit from one side and come on again from the other without being seen by the audience. Fragments of ceramic money boxes were found, which would have been used to collect entry fees from theatregoers, before being taken to an office to be smashed and the money counted: this office was known as the &quot;box office&quot;, which is the origin of the term we use today.

Glass beads and pins were unearthed along with drinking vessels and clay pipes. The team also came across a mount and a token, as well as personal items, including a bone comb.

In August 2019 the structural remains and below-ground deposits were designated a Scheduled Monument. The high-rise residential tower block on the site is named &quot;The Stage&quot;; and the two adjacent low-rise office blocks &quot;The Bard&quot; and &quot;The Hewett&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
A reconstruction of the Curtain Theatre is used in the 1998 film &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;.

The theatre is the main setting for the jukebox musical &quot;&amp; Juliet&quot;, which takes place during the first performance of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

<doc id="606263" wikidata="Q26823554" url="?curid=606263" title="David Seville">
<text>David &quot;Dave&quot; Seville is a fictional character, the adoptive father and producer and manager of the fictional singing group &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;. The character was created by Ross Bagdasarian, who had used the name &quot;David Seville&quot; as his stage name prior to the creation of the Chipmunks, while writing and recording novelty records in the 1950s. One of the records, recorded in 1958 under the David Seville stage name, was &quot;Witch Doctor&quot;, featuring a sped-up high-pitched vocal technique. Bagdasarian would later use that technique in &quot;The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don&#x27;t Be Late)&quot;, which would introduce both Alvin and the Chipmunks as a singing group and Bagdasarian&#x27;s music producer &quot;Dave&quot;. Bagdasarian would go on to create &quot;The Alvin Show&quot;, based on the Alvin and the Chipmunks group, where he voiced the semi-fictional character David Seville, based largely on himself, with Alvin based on Ross&#x27;s sometimes rebellious son Adam.

Ross Bagdasarian Jr. took over ownership Bagdasarian Productions when his father died in 1972. He reprised the David Seville character, first in a series of novelty albums beginning with 1980&#x27;s &quot;Chipmunk Punk&quot;. Bagdasarian Jr. subsequently assumed the role on the TV series &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;, which ran in original episodes from 1983 to 1990. Bagdasarian Jr. has voiced David Seville in all official animated and recorded incarnations of David Seville since taking over for his father in the 1970s, including TV series, animated specials, and direct-to-video productions. He most recently voiced the character in the 2015 TV show version of the &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; television series.

Actor Jason Lee also portrays David Seville in the live-action films, &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; (2007), &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel&quot; (2009), &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked&quot; (2011) and &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip&quot; (2015) which use a combination of live-action acting and computer animation. While Ross Bagdasarian Jr. does not do any voices for the film series, the films are all produced in association with Bagdasarian Productions, which owns the rights to all of the characters.

<doc id="606265" wikidata="Q924360" url="?curid=606265" title="Stanley, County Durham">
<text>Stanley is a town and civil parish in County Durham in England. Centred on a hilltop between Chester-le-Street and Consett, Stanley lies south-west of Gateshead.

The town&#x27;s name is derived from the Old English &quot;stān&quot; and &quot;lēah&quot;, meaning &quot;stony woodland clearing&quot;. 

The local economy was once based on coal-mining and other heavy industries; with their disappearance or substantial decline, Stanley is now primarily a commuter town. Its core began to grow in the nineteenth century through the expansion and merger of the mining villages of East Stanley and West Stanley. 

The civil parish, created in 2007, incorporates the town of Stanley and the following villages and settlements: to the north of the town centre, Shield Row, Kip Hill, and Causey; to the east, No Place; to the south-east, Bloemfontein, The Middles, and Craghead; to the south, South Moor and Quaking Houses; to the south-west, Oxhill, Catchgate, New Kyo, Greencroft, and Annfield Plain; to the west, West Kyo and Harelaw; and to the north-west, Tanfield Lea, Harperley, White-le-Head, Tantobie, Coppy, Tanfield, and Clough Dene.

==History==
Some archaeological evidence of possible Iron Age and Roman activity has been found in the Stanley area. 

Stanley is referred to in an early thirteenth century a documented decisionof Richard Poore, Bishop of Durham from 1228 to 1237. Dated between 1228 and 1234, it confirms the granting of the vill of Stanley and some land in Durham to William de Kilkenny.

The first printed map of the of Durham was created in 1576. Published in 1579 as part of the cartographer Christopher Saxton&#x27;s county atlas, it shows Stanley as &quot;Standley&quot;. In 1611, John Speed, a famous English mapmaker who built on Saxton&#x27;s work, created a map of the that also shows Stanley as &quot;Standley&quot;.

The 1909 West Stanley Pit Disaster, one of the worst in the history of British coal mining, occurred at West Stanley Colliery on 16 February of that year. 168 men and boys were killed. An explosion at the same colliery in 1882 had killed 13 men. On 22 August 1947, an explosion at the Louisa Morrison Colliery killed 22 men.

Stanley was served by the Stanhope and Tyne Railway, which had two stations in the town: West Stanley, and Annfield Plain. Both closed in 1955.

Tanfield Lea was the site of the Ever Ready company&#x27;s largest British battery factory, a major local employer. The factory opened, to much fanfare, in 1968, had around 950 employeesmainly former miners at its peak in the 1970s, and closed in 1996. The British Steel plant in the neighbouring town of Consett (some from Stanley) also had many ex-miners among the several thousand employed when it closed in 1980, part of a wave of redundancies affecting workers in the traditional heavy industries of the region.

The Stanley Blues Festival took place on the first weekend in August between 1993 and 2007, with appearances by local, national, and international blues artists and other musical acts. Nearly 15,000 people attended in 2002, the event&#x27;s tenth anniversary. With support from the then-Derwentside District Council, Durham County Council, and the regional arm of Arts Council England, admission was free.

In June 2008, an arson attack left a historic building on Front Street in ruins, along with a billiards club and several shops. In November 2008, the burnt buildings were demolished.

In mid-2023, Stanley Town Council handed back Stanley Civic Hall, the town’s long-standing arts venue and community hub, to Durham County Council. Amidst political controversy, it closed shortly afterwards, and was put up for sale in early 2024. The Civic Hall was formerly known as the Lamplight Arts Centre, which opened in 1961. The Council had taken over its running in mid-2013. The Civic Hall hosted concerts, recitals, plays and shows in the Alun Armstrong Theatre, had an independent cinema, put on exhibitions, held classes and seminars, and was a weddings and corporate events venue.

In late 2023, the owners of the Beamish Football Centre training ground announced that government funding had been secured for a major refurbishment and upgrade, with work starting in 2024.

==Local government==
Stanley, whose boundaries have changed over the years, has successively been part of the Lanchester Poor Law Union (from 1837 onwards); Stanley Local Board (1892); Stanley Urban District (1894); Derwentside District (1974); and County Durham (2009). 

Stanley is in the UK parliamentary constituency of North Durham. Since July 2024, this has been represented in the House of Commons by Luke Akehurst of the Labour Party. 

=== Town Council ===
Since 2007, Stanley Town Council has provided the first tier of local government. The council has the statutory right to do whatever it considers will improve the economic, social or environmental well-being of the area. It has a duty to provide allotments and to take into account the potential impact of every policy and action on reducing crime. The council&#x27;s powers include the provision and maintenance of bus shelters, community centres, play areas and play equipment, and the awarding of grants to local community organisations. It can also issue fixed penalty fines for offences such as littering, graffiti, fly-posting, and contraventions of dog control orders.

The town council has 20 councillors, elected every four years by electors in the seven parish wards. The last election was in 2021 for the 20212025 term. Each year the councillors elect, from amongst themselves, a town mayor and deputy, and a council leader and deputy.

=== County Council ===
Durham County Council provides the second tier of local government. Eight Stanley town councillors serve on the county council. Its responsibilities include education, housing, social services, highways, planning, and refuse collection. 

In May 2024, the county council became part of a new upper tier of local government, the North East Combined Authority, led by Mayor Kim McGuinness of the Labour Party.
==== Area Action Partnership (AAP) ==== 
The Stanley AAP, one of 14 in County Durham, is a non-political organisation and funding body engaged with tackling local issues. It involves members of the public and representatives of Durham County Council and Stanley Town Council, the police, the fire brigade, health, housing, and education providers, business, and voluntary organisations. Stanley AAP publishes a directory of local activities and advice and support services.

==Economy==
The three largest employment sectors for residents in the local area are retail, manufacturing, and health and social work, while the three largest industry groups for local businesses are construction; professional, scientific, and technical services; and retail. 

Retailers in the town centre have faced significant competition from larger retail and leisure destinations elsewhere, including Clifford Road Retail Park, the MetroCentre, and Newcastle and Durham city centres. Online shopping, encouraged by the Covid-19 pandemic, has also changed shopping patterns and contributed to a weakening of footfall.

The town&#x27;s main shopping area, Front Street, is pedestrianised, housing independent shops alongside large chains such as Boots. A market is held on Front Street on Thursdays and Saturdays: it has declined over the years. There are also supermarkets such as Asda, Aldi and Iceland located within the town. Tesco planned to construct a new supermarket on the Clifford Road Retail Complex site, which had previously housed Kwik Save, Presto, a furniture shop, and an indoor market. Tesco sold the land to TJ Morris, and the former Kwik Save site was then redeveloped into a large Home Bargains store, opening in July 2018. The store created 60 new jobs.

Stanley has also added a Domino&#x27;s, a larger Greggs outlet (both opening December 2022) and a drive-thru Starbucks (opened in March 2023) in a newly developed site off of Agnes Street. The Front Street area, however, continues to be defined by its derelict buildings, including the old school building in the centre of Front Street, which has remained unoccupied for decades.

Over the past 20 years, the refurbishment of Stanley town centre has seen the opening of a new bus interchange and an extension to the Louisa Centre leisure facility, including a new swimming pool. A new health centre, Stanley Primary Care Centre, was opened in February 2010 along with a Sure Start children&#x27;s centre.

== Transport links ==
Via the A693, Stanley is about from Junction 63 of the A1(M) motorway. Stanley Bus Station is an interchange for routes served by several operators. 

The nearest Tyne &amp; Wear Metro stations are Felling, Stadium, and Gateshead, each around away; all three serve both lines of the Metro&#x27;s network. The closest railway station, at Chester-le-Street, is on the East Coast Main Line and about from Stanley. 

Newcastle International Airport and the Newcastle International Ferry Terminal are each about away.

==Schools and libraries==
As well as several primary schools, Stanley has two secondary schools: North Durham Academy,
and Tanfield School, a specialist science and engineering college. St Bede&#x27;s Catholic School &amp; Sixth Form College, an academy, is in the nearby village of Lanchester.

There are public libraries in Annfield Plain, South Moor, and at the Louisa Centre in Stanley, with many others in the surrounding area.

==Leisure and community activities==
The C2C Cycle Route skirts Stanley to the north. This 140-mile (230 km) route links Whitehaven (Cumberland) on England&#x27;s north-west coast with Roker Beach (Sunderland) on the north-east coast.

The Louisa Centre, a sports and leisure complex, contains a gym, a 25-metre swimming pool (with a 300-seat spectators&#x27; gallery), a small pool, a sports hall, a shooting range, a soft play area, a nursery, meeting rooms, a café, and Stanley Library.

South Moor Golf Course, lying south of the town and to the west of The Middles, was founded in 1923 and first operated by the National Coal Board. Redesigned in 1925 by Alister MacKenzie, a famous golf course architect, the course has 18 holes. It has a practice area, a short-game area, a pro shop, and a clubhouse that can host functions.

The Stanley Indoor Bowls Centre, with a large arena and grandstand, offers play for people of all ages and abilities. Inaugurated in 1977, it has hosted several top-level international events. The Centre also provides meeting facilities for a range of community groups and clubs, and can be hired for private functions.

The Venue, a community centre and events space, has facilities for dance and martial arts classes, sports, theatrical productions, concerts, weddings and parties, meetings, and cooking classes. It also has a small gym. Organisations based in or accessible via The Venue include Citizens Advice, Age UK, Foodbank, Community Money Advice, Welfare Rights, and Durham Action on Single Housing (DASH).
=== Youth clubs and activities for children===
Under the umbrella of SAYC, the Stanley Area Youth Consortium, trips and activities for children and young people in the wider Stanley area are offered by an array of youth clubs and voluntary associations. 

These include Stanley Young People’s Club, focused on the South Stanley and South Moor areas; Oxhill Youth Club, founded in 1962, which runs the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award scheme locally; the Activity Den, based in Tanfield Lea, active for nearly 20 years; Clavering Youth Club; Beamish Community Football Club; North Road Gym, a boxing club for young amateurs; PACT House, a community hub; and several community halls, schools, and churches.

<text>James Sclavunos is an American multi-instrumentalist, record producer and writer. He is best known for his work as a drummer, having been a member of two seminal no wave groups in the late 1970s, Teenage Jesus &amp; the Jerks and 8 Eyed Spy, both alongside Lydia Lunch. He is also noted for stints in Sonic Youth and the Cramps, and has been a member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds since 1994. Sclavunos has led his own group the Vanity Set since 2000 and was a founding member of the Bad Seeds spinoff band Grinderman.

==Biography==
Sclavunos, a half-Greek and half-Italian from Brooklyn, New York (known for his exceptional height at 6&#x27;7&quot;), was memorably described in the pages of &quot;The Wire&quot; as an &quot;infamous elegant degenerate&quot;. He has long been a prime mover in New York City&#x27;s vibrant underground music scene, helping to kick-start the vital no wave movement in the late 1970s with Teenage Jesus &amp; the Jerks and 8 Eyed Spy (both with Lydia Lunch), before playing with Sonic Youth and the Cramps. He has also recorded albums with Grinderman, Sonic Youth, Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns and Congo Norvell as well as recording sessions with many artists including Marianne Faithfull, Iggy Pop, Beth Orton, and Seasick Steve. He has also toured with Lunch, Alex Chilton and Wreckless Eric.

A key member of the Bad Seeds since 1994 and a founding member of the Bad Seeds offshoot Grinderman, he also formed his own New York-based musical ensemble The Vanity Set in 2000, releasing two studio albums to date.

Further to his work as a musician, Sclavunos has produced a wide range of bands including Gogol Bordello, the Horrors, the Jim Jones Revue, Black Moth, and Teenage Mothers (Lead guitarist and co-vocalist Raph Brous has dedicated his upcoming novel, &quot;Empire of Ants&quot;, to him).

He has done several remixes, both on his own and as one half of Silver Alert (along with Vanity Set bandmate Peter Mavrogeorgis). In 2012, Silver Alert performed &quot;Faustian Pact&quot; at the Perth International Arts Festival in Western Australia, a live adaptation of FW Murnau&#x27;s film &quot;Faust&quot;, produced in collaboration with director/choreographer Micki Pellerano.

In 2012, Sclavunos began an ongoing collaboration with Australian performance artist/musician Michaela Davies on a composition titled &quot;FM-2030&quot; (named for the transhumanist philosopher Fereidoun M. Esfandiary) utilizing programmed electro-muscular stimulation of classical string players to generate involuntary playing movements. The composition premiered at the 2013 Sonica Festival in Glasgow.

== Career ==

===Early years===
While attending NYU School of Arts, Jim Sclavunos co-founded &quot;No Magazine&quot;, an underground fanzine devoted to coverage of NY punk rock and the burgeoning No Wave movement. He briefly fronted his own band Mimi And The Dreamboats, before joining No Wave bands Red Transistor, and The Gynecologists with avant-garde composer Rhys Chatham and Nina Canal to play drums. Around the time the Gynecologists were disbanding, Sclavunos joined Lydia Lunch’s band Teenage Jesus and the Jerks as bass guitarist, releasing both an EP &quot;Baby Doll&quot; (1979) and a compilation mini-album on pink vinyl on Lust/Unlust. A short-lived side-project with Lunch called Beirut Slump featured Sclavunos’ first recorded work as drummer on the group&#x27;s single &quot;Try Me / Staircase&quot; (1979) on Migraine. Following their European tour in June 1979, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks broke up, and Lydia and Sclavunos joined 8 Eyed Spy.

===1980–1986: First album, Sonic Youth, and Trigger &amp; the Thrill Kings===
In 1980, Sclavunos and Lunch formed a short-lived live blues project, The Devil Dogs. In 1981, following the death of bass player George Scott, 8 Eyed Spy released a self-titled album on Fetish. Sclavunos designed the covers for both the ROIR 8 Eyed Spy release and for Suicide’s &quot;Half Alive&quot; album (1981). Sclavunos ended up moving to Memphis and joining Alex Chilton&#x27;s side-project Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns, ultimately releasing an EP &quot;Blow Your Top&quot; (1982). The same year he briefly joined Sonic Youth and recorded drums parts for their debut album, &quot;Confusion Is Sex&quot;, but quit before the sessions were over. He moved on to co-founding Trigger &amp; the Thrill Kings with Dutch singer Truus DeGroot, with the group touring extensively throughout the Netherlands and Germany with various line-ups including Jim Duckworth on guitar and Annene Kaye on keyboards.

===1987–1993: Session years and reunion projects===
Sclavunos recorded with Kid Congo Powers’ band Congo Norvell releasing &quot;Lullabies&quot; (1992, Fiasco). His recording sessions with The Cramps produced albums &quot;Look Mom No Head!&quot; (1991, Restless) and EP &quot;Blues Fix&quot; (1992, Big Beat). In the fall of 1991 Sclavunos left Los Angeles to be reunited with Lydia Lunch, touring Europe with her and Rowland S. Howard under the band name Shotgun Wedding. Live recordings were later released under various titles, including &quot;Shotgun Wedding Live in Siberia&quot;. Sclavunos both lived in and toured Europe with Wreckless Eric and Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns in the period 1992 – 1994. While living in Vienna, Austria, he played drums on, and arranged Panther Burns’ &quot;Shadow Dancer&quot; album in 1992 (released on Intercord in 1995).

===1994–99: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds===
Following working with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds member Mick Harvey in a project Harvey was producing, Sclavunos joined the band on the 1994 Let Love In European tour as organist/ percussionist. Sclavunos stayed on for their US Lollapalooza tour and became a permanent member that same year.

With the Bad Seeds, Sclavunos generally plays a variety of auxiliary percussion (&quot;e.g.&quot; vibraphone, maracas, cowbell, tubular bells), while Thomas Wydler plays a standard drum kit. Sclavunos has also played standard drums, keyboards and other instruments for the Bad Seeds as needed.

Sclavunos recorded his first album as full band member in 1996 with &quot;Murder Ballads&quot;. &quot;Murder Ballads&quot; was followed by &quot;The Boatman&#x27;s Call&quot; and a tour, before the Bad Seeds entered a hiatus period.

===2000–2006: Debut solo album and continuing with the Bad Seeds===
Sclavunos’ first solo album &quot;The Vanity Set&quot; is released in 2000 on Naked Spur Productions/Hitchyke, while the same year saw him join The Gunga Din as drummer, touring and playing on their 2nd album &quot;Glitterati&quot; (2000, Jetset). The following year, &quot;No More Shall We Part&quot;, Scalvunos&#x27; third studio recording with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, is released on Mute Records in April 2001.

Sclavunos produced his second solo album, &quot;Little Stabs of Happiness&quot; (2003, Cargo) under the banner of The Vanity Set. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds released &quot;Nocturama&quot; (2003, Anti) and &quot;Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus&quot; (2004, Anti). Throughout this period, Sclavunos toured extensively, drumming with both Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and in Nick Cave’s solo performances in the stripped-down line-up that would eventually become Grinderman. The same line-up of musicians also recorded several tracks with Marianne Faithfull for her album &quot;Before The Poison&quot; (2005). Sclavunos played drums and percussion on Nick Cave’s score for the Icelandic theatre company Vesturport’s production of Woyzeck, performed at the Barbican Theatre in London in 2005, as well as a cover version of J.B. Lenoir’s &quot;I Feel So Good&quot; for Wim Wenders’ &quot;Martin Scorsese Presents The Blues – The Soul of a Man&quot;.

===2007–2012: Grinderman, Bad Seeds, and &quot;Faustian Pact&quot;===
In 2007, Grinderman, with Sclavunos on drums, released their first self-titled album and debut in the headline slot at All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties in April of that year. Sclavunos drummed on Cave&#x27;s score for the 2007 soundtrack, &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford&quot;, and the following year Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds released their 14th studio album &quot;Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!&quot; (Anti), which won the MOJO Honours List Award for Best Album 2008. Grinderman headlined major European festival dates including Roskilde Festival, Latitude Festival, and Summercase. Sclavunos played drums on &quot;Just Like a King&quot;, a duet with Seasick Steve and Nick Cave which appeared on Seasick Steve&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;I Started Out with Nothin and I Still Got Most of It Left&quot;. &quot;Grinderman 2&quot; was released in 2010 and Grinderman toured extensively throughout North America, Europe and Australia. On Valentine&#x27;s Day 2012 Sclavunos presented Faustian Pact, a multi-media film and live magic ritual performance and musical improvisation piece at The Perth Arts Festival with Micki Pellerano. He co-wrote and contributed vocals and synth to the track &quot;Lost American&quot; from the solo album &quot;On the Mat and Off&quot; by fellow Bad Seed Thomas Wydler.

=== 2013–2019 ===
In February 2013 Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds released &quot;Push the Sky Away&quot; (Bad Seed Ltd) and toured the album extensively around the world. At the end of their North American stint, a stripped-down version of the band (including Sclavunos on drums) recorded the album &quot;Live from KCRW&quot;, which was released that same year. Sclavunos begins his collaboration with Australian musician and performance artist Michaela Davies on a composition utilizing EMS to create involuntary movement in performing musicians. The piece entitled &quot;FM-2030&quot; (and dedicated to the Futurist philosopher of the same name) premiered at the Sydney Opera House in 2013. In 2014 &quot;Axels &amp; Sockets (The Jeffrey Lee Pierce Sessions Project)&quot; is released with the featured track &quot;Nobody’s City&quot; mixed by Sclavunos, a duet with Iggy Pop and Nick Cave, with guitar by Thurston Moore. More touring ensued for Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds.

2016 saw the release of the Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds documentary &quot;One More Time with Feeling&quot;, as well as the band’s 16th studio album &quot;Skeleton Tree&quot;. Sclavunos is reunited with Truus DeGroot (recording as Plus Instruments) recording drums for 3 tracks on her 2016 &quot;Signal Through the Waves&quot; album while on tour with her in São Paulo, Brazil. Extensive international touring with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds followed the 2017 release of their &quot;Lovely Creatures: The Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds&quot;, culminating in the release of &quot;Distant Sky (Live in Copenhagen)&quot;, both the concert film and the EP of the same name featuring excerpts from the film. &quot;Ghosteen&quot;, a double album from Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds released in October 2019.

===2020–present: Bad Seeds hiatus and continuing solo work===
Following the COVID-19 pandemic, Sclavunos has released multiple singles, starting in January 2021 with &quot;Holiday Song&quot;, and continuing in April 2022 with a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Lay Down Your Weary Tune&quot;. He also confirmed that he was working on a solo album prior to the pandemic, and that it would be coming soon. Also in the works is a collaborative album with Nicole Atkins; a lead single, &quot;A Man Like Me&quot; was released in 2019, with the album tentatively being released in 2023.

<text>The Harvard Law Review is a law review published by an independent student group at Harvard Law School. According to the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;″s 2015 impact factor of 4.979 placed the journal first out of 143 journals in the category &quot;Law&quot;. It also ranks first in other ranking systems of law reviews. It is published monthly from November through June, with the November issue dedicated to covering the previous year&#x27;s term of the Supreme Court of the United States.

The journal also publishes the online-only &quot;Harvard Law Review Forum&quot;, a rolling journal of scholarly responses to the main journal&#x27;s content. The law review is one of three honors societies at the law school, along with the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau and the Board of Student Advisors. Students who are selected for more than one of these three organizations may only join one.

The Harvard Law Review Association—in conjunction with the &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot;, the &quot;University of Pennsylvania Law Review&quot;, and the &quot;Yale Law Journal—&quot;publishes &quot;The Bluebook&quot;, the primary guide for legal citation formats in the United States.

==History==
The &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; published its first issue on April 15, 1887, making it one of the oldest operating student-edited law reviews in the United States. The establishment of the journal was largely due to the support of Louis Brandeis, then a recent Harvard Law School alumnus and Boston attorney who would later go on to become a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

From the 1880s to the 1970s, editors were selected on the basis of their grades; the president of the &quot;Review&quot; was the student with the highest academic rank. The first female editor of the journal was Priscilla Holmes (1953–1955, Volumes 67–68); the first woman to serve as the journal&#x27;s president was Susan Estrich (1977), who later was active in Democratic Party politics and became the youngest woman to receive tenure at Harvard Law School; its first non-white ethnic minority president was Raj Marphatia (1988, Volume 101), who is now a partner at the Boston law firm of Ropes &amp; Gray; its first African-American president was the 44th President of the United States Barack Obama (1991); its first openly gay president was Mitchell Reich (2011); its first Latino president was Andrew M. Crespo, who is now tenured as a professor at Harvard Law School. The first female African-American president, ImeIme Umana, was elected in 2017.

Gannett House, a white building constructed in the Greek Revival style that was popular in New England during the mid-to-late 19th century, has been home to the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; since the 1920s. Before moving into Gannett House, the journal resided in the Law School&#x27;s Austin Hall.

Since the change of criteria in the 1970s, grades are no longer the primary basis of selection for editors. Membership in the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; is offered to select Harvard law students based on first-year grades and performance in a writing competition held at the end of the first year except for twelve slots that are offered on a discretionary basis. The writing competition includes two components: an edit of an unpublished article and an analysis of a recent United States Supreme Court or Court of Appeals case. The writing competition submissions are graded blindly to assure anonymity. Fourteen editors (two from each 1L section) are selected based on a combination of their first-year grades and their competition scores. Twenty editors are selected based solely on their competition scores. The remaining twelve editors are selected on a discretionary basis. According to the law review&#x27;s webpage, &quot;Some of these discretionary slots may be used to implement the Review&#x27;s affirmative action policy.&quot; The president of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; is elected by the other editors.

It has been a long tradition since the first issue that the works of students published in the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; are called &quot;notes&quot; and they are unsigned as part of a policy reflecting &quot;the fact that many members of the &quot;Review&quot; besides the author make a contribution to each published piece.&quot;

In 2012, &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; had 1,722 paid subscriptions.

In November 2023, the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; stopped the publication of an article written by Rabea Eghbariah, a Palestinian student at Harvard Law. The online chairs of the &quot;Law Review&quot; had asked the Eghbariah to write an essay. The Intercept reported that the president of the &quot;Law Review&quot;, Apsara Iyer, with the support of a majority of the &quot;Law Review&quot; leadership, delayed the publication of the essay because of &quot;safety concerns and the desire to deliberate with editors.&quot; The &quot;Law Review&quot; ultimately did not publish the article, and it was later published in &quot;The Nation&quot;. 25 &quot;Law Review&quot; editors criticized the decision not to publish the article, calling it an &quot;unprecedented decision [that] threatens academic freedom and perpetuates the suppression of Palestinian voices.&quot;

<text>Sanma is a province located in the Northern part of the nation of Vanuatu, occupying the nation&#x27;s largest island, Espiritu Santo, which is located approximately 2,500 km northeast of Sydney, Australia.
The name Sanma is derived from the initial letters of the main islands of (Espiritu) SANto and [[Malo Island|MA]]lo.

==Population==
It has a population of 45,860 and an area of 4,248 km2. The provincial capital is Luganville. Other larger settlements are Hog Harbour, Port Olry, Nakere, Ipaiato, Tasiriki, Tasmate and Malao.

Sanma Provincial Day falls on 23 September annually. All Sanma Citizens including friends celebrate this special occasion wherever they are domestically or internationally.

==Overview==
Sanma provincial council is responsible for running the daily affairs of the province. The council is elected every four years, the party which has the vast majority of seats sets up the provincial government. The head of the provincial government is the President of Sanma province. The headquarters of the province is located in the town centre of Luganville.

Critics had blamed the provincial government for ill management of the provincial affairs during the past few years. For example, over the last few years, poor management had culminated in a considerable amount of litigations. This has therefore cost the council a fortune as regards legal fees. One of the avowed aims of this recent council at Sanma province is to ensure transparency, and good governance.

<text>The Museum of Liverpool Life was a museum in Liverpool, England, part of National Museums Liverpool, that focused on the people of Liverpool. Due to increasing patronage and collection size, the museum closed in 2006 to prepare for construction of a larger site, the Museum of Liverpool, which opened in 2011.

==Exhibitions==
At the time of its closure on 4 June 2006, the museum had three galleries: &quot;City Lives&quot; explored Liverpool&#x27;s cultural diversity, &quot;The River Room&quot; described life alongside the River Mersey and &quot;City Soldiers&quot; was an exhibition about the King&#x27;s Regiment. Previous exhibitions had included &quot;Mersey Culture, from Brookside to the Grand National&quot;, &quot;Making a Living&quot; and &quot;Demanding a Voice&quot;.

<text>The Rowell–Sirois Commission, officially known as the Royal Commission on Dominion–Provincial Relations, was a Canadian Royal Commission that looked into the Canadian economy and federal–provincial relations. It was called in 1937 and reported in 1940.

The Commission was chaired first by Newton Rowell and then by Joseph Sirois. James McGregor Stewart acted as chief counsel. It was called as a result of the Great Depression. The attempts to manage the Depression by the government illustrated grave flaws with the Canadian constitution. While the federal government had most of the revenue gathering powers, the provinces had unexpectedly greater expenditure responsibilities. The founders had given the provinces responsibility for health care, education, and welfare when they were only minor concerns, but by 1937, however, they had all become massive expenditure areas.

The Commission recommended for the federal government to take over control of unemployment insurance and pensions. It also recommended the creation of equalization payments and large transfers of money from the federal government to the provinces each year. Other recommendations were not adopted because of resistance from the provinces or the federal government.

<doc id="606281" wikidata="Q17131641" url="?curid=606281" title="Intrinsic fraud">
<text>Intrinsic fraud is an intentionally false representation that goes to the heart of what a given lawsuit is about, in other words, whether fraud was used to procure the transaction. (If the transaction was fraudulent, it probably does not have the legal status of a contract.) Intrinsic fraud is distinguished from extrinsic fraud (a/k/a collateral fraud) which is a deceptive means of keeping a person from discovering and/or enforcing legal rights. It is possible to have both intrinsic and extrinsic frauds.

The U.S. Supreme Court defined and distinguished intrinsic from extrinsic fraud in its unanimous 1878 &quot;United States v. Throckmorton&quot; decision, written by Justice Samuel Freeman Miller. It described intrinsic fraud as &quot;any matter which was actually presented and considered in the judgment assailed&quot;, declining to grant equitable relief to the federal government over an allegation that a settler&#x27;s land claim in Mexican-ruled California had been secured two decades earlier after California became a U.S. territory through falsified documents and perjured affidavits. Even though the issue had not been raised at the original trial, the Court held that the government had had ample opportunity to exercise due diligence and investigate the evidence.

During a trial, perjury, forgery, and bribery of a witness constitute frauds that might have been relieved by the court. Such actions will usually lead to a mistrial being declared and after any penalties for the involved parties a new trial will take place on the same matter.

Two types of intrinsic fraud in contract law are &quot;fraud in the inducement&quot; and &quot;fraud in the factum&quot;.

&quot;Fraud in the factum&quot; is a legal defense, and occurs where A signs a contract, but either does not realize that it is a contract or does not understand the nature of the contract, because of some false information that B gave to A. &quot;For example,&quot; if John tells his mother that he is taking a college course on handwriting analysis, and for his homework, he needs her to read and sign a pretend deed. If Mom signs the deed believing what he told her, and John tries to enforce the deed, Mom can plead &quot;fraud in the factum.&quot;

&quot;Fraud in the inducement&quot; is an equitable defense, and occurs when A signs a contract, knowing that it is a contract and (at least having a rough idea) what the contract is about, but the reason A signed the contract was because of some false information that B gave to A. &quot;For example,&quot; if John tells his mother to sign a deed giving him her property, Mom refuses at first, then John explains that the deed will be kept in a safe deposit box until she dies. If Mom signs the deed because of this statement from John, and John tries to enforce the deed prior to Mom&#x27;s death, Mom can plead &quot;fraud in the inducement.&quot;

<doc id="606282" wikidata="Q732526" url="?curid=606282" title="José Guadalupe Posada">
<text>José Guadalupe Posada Aguilar (2 February 1852 – 20 January 1913) was a Mexican political printmaker who used relief printing to produce popular illustrations. His work has influenced numerous Latin American artists and cartoonists because of its satirical acuteness and social engagement. He used skulls, calaveras, and bones to show political and cultural critiques.
Among his most enduring works is &quot;La Calavera Catrina&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Posada was born in Aguascalientes on 2 February 1852. His father was Germán Posada Serna and his mother was Petra Aguilar Portillo. Posada was one of eight children and received his early education from his older brother Cirilo, a country school teacher. Posada&#x27;s brother taught him reading, writing, and drawing. He then joined &quot;La Academia Municipal de Dibujo de Aguascalientes&quot; (the &quot;Municipal Drawing Academy of Aguascalientes&quot;). Later, in 1868, as a teenager he apprenticed in the workshop of Jose Trinidad Pedroza, who taught him lithography and engraving.

In 1871, before he was out of his teens, his career began with a job as the political cartoonist for a local newspaper in Aguascalientes, &quot;El Jicote&quot; (&quot;The Bumblebee&quot;), where his first cartoons were published. The newspaper closed after 11 issues, reportedly because one of Posada&#x27;s cartoons had offended a powerful local politician. In 1872, Posada and Pedroza dedicated themselves to commercial lithography in León, Guanajuato. While in Leon, Posada opened his own workshop and worked as a lithography teacher at the local secondary school. He also continued his work with lithographs and wood engravings. In 1873, he returned to his home in Aguascalientes City where he married María de Jesús Vela in 1875. The following year he purchased the printing press from Pedroza.

From 1875 to 1888, Posada continued to collaborate with several newspapers in León, including &quot;La Gacetilla&quot;, &quot;el Pueblo Caótico&quot; and &quot;La education&quot;. He survived the great flood of León on 18 June 1888, of which he published several lithographs representing the tragedy in which more than two hundred and fifty corpses were found and more than 1,400 people were reported missing.

At the end of 1888, he moved to Mexico City, where he learned the craft and technique of engraving in lead and zinc. He collaborated with the newspaper &quot;La Patria Ilustrada&quot; and the &quot;Revisita de Mexico&quot; until the early months of 1890.

==Career as artist==

He began to work with , until he was able to establish his own lithographic workshop. From then on Posada undertook work that earned him popular acceptance and admiration for his sense of humor and propensity concerning the quality of his work. In his broad and varied work, Posada portrayed beliefs, the daily lifestyles of popular groups, the abuses of government, and the exploitation of the common people. He illustrated the famous skulls, along with other illustrations that became popular as they were distributed to various newspapers and periodicals.

In 1883, following his success, he was hired as a teacher of lithography at the local Preparatory School. The shop flourished until 1888 when a disastrous flood hit the city. He subsequently moved to Mexico City. His first regular employment in the capital was with &quot;La Patria Ilustrada&quot;, whose editor was Ireneo Paz, the grandfather of the later famed writer Octavio Paz. He later joined the staff of a publishing firm owned by Antonio Vanegas Arroyo and while at this firm he created a prolific number of book covers and illustrations. Much of his work was also published in sensationalistic broadsides depicting various current events.

From the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 until his death in 1913, Posada worked tirelessly in the press. The works he completed in his press during this time allowed him to develop his artistic prowess as a draftsman, engraver and lithographer. At the time he continued to make satirical illustrations and cartoons featured in the magazine, &quot;El Jicote&quot;. He played a crucial role in the government during the presidency of Francisco I Madero and during the campaign of Emiliano Zapata.

==Notable works==
Posada&#x27;s best known works are his calaveras. His most famous and influential work is the &quot;La Calavera Catrina&quot;, which was first published posthumously in a 1913 broadside. Catrina was probably intended as a satirical portrait of Mexican elites who were imitating European fashions, but the text, which was not written by the artist, satirized working class vendors of chickpeas. Posada&#x27;s Catrina image appeared in several other broadsides. It was elaborated into a full figure by the muralist Diego Rivera. Catrina is now the most widespread image associated with the Day of the Dead.

==Later life and death==
Largely forgotten by the end of his life, José Guadalupe Posada died in 1913 of gastroenteritis. Three of his neighbors certified his death, although only one of them knew his full name. He reportedly died penniless and was ultimately buried in an unmarked pauper&#x27;s grave.

==Legacy==
Academics have estimated that during his long career, Posada produced 20,000 plus images for broadsheets, pamphlets and chapbooks. Posada was studied by key figures of Mexican muralism, including Jean Charlot, Diego Rivera, and José Clemente Orozco, who created national art. Rivera advanced the false belief that Posada was a proto-revolutionary artist.

Though Posada has usually been characterized as someone who utilized traditional craft techniques, he likely used photomechanical processes and deliberately made distressed-looking images in order to appeal to his downscale clientele. Frida Kahlo spoke &quot;almost reverentially&quot; of Posada and posted some of his prints in her hotel room in New York City in 1933. 

In the 1920s, the French born Mexican artist Jean Charlot was the first to popularize Posada&#x27;s broadsides as art. In 1929 Anita Brenner&#x27;s book &quot;Idols Behind Altars&quot; used Posada&#x27;s illustrations. Brenner called Posada a &quot;prophet&quot; and linked him to the Mexica, peasants and workers. The US author Frances Toor promoted Posada as folklore with her 1930 book &quot;Posada: Grabador Mexicano,&quot; the first monograph on Posada. Rivera commented on 406 prints by Posada in the foreword for the book.

When Leopoldo Méndez returned from the Cultural Missions programs of the Mexican Secretariat of Public Education in Jalisco, Méndez got to know about Posada&#x27;s prints and adopted him as artistic and cultural hero. One of Méndez&#x27;s last projects was a study of Posada, where Méndez reproduced over 900 of Posada illustrations.

<text>The Merseyside Maritime Museum is a museum based in the city of Liverpool, Merseyside, England. It is part of National Museums Liverpool and an Anchor Point of ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage. It opened for a trial season in 1980 before fully opening in 1984 and expanding in 1986. The museum occupies warehouse block D at the Albert Dock, along with the Piermaster&#x27;s House, Canning Half Tide Dock and Canning Graving Docks.

== History ==
The embryonic Merseyside Maritime Museum collection began in 1862. Over the years, the collection developed slowly due to lack of funds to the extent that by 1924 the collection was little more than &#x27;an old dug-out canoe and a few model ships&#x27;. Robert Gladstone (maritime historian and great-nephew of former Prime Minister William Gladstone) created the shipping gallery in 1931 which was partially destroyed in the May Blitz of 1941. In 1965, the History of the Ship gallery was opened followed by the Port of Liverpool gallery (1971) and the New Shipperies Exhibition (1974). In late 1970s work began on the creation of a dedicated maritime museum which opened for a trial season in 1980.

==Collections==
Focusing on Titanic which sank on 15 April 1912 and the British ship Lusitania which sank after being attacked by a German U-boat during World War I on 7 May 1915. A detailed description of the ship is provided.
White Star Line which owned the Titanic was in Liverpool, so Titanic carried &quot;Liverpool&quot; on her stern.
In 2012, Rarely-seen items related to Titanic were exhibited to mark the 100th anniversary.

==Archives Centre==
The building also houses the Archives Centre previously known as the Maritime Archives and Library.

<doc id="606295" wikidata="Q32087" url="?curid=606295" title="XSL Formatting Objects">
<text>XSL-FO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a markup language for XML document formatting that is most often used to generate PDF files. XSL-FO is part of XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language), a set of W3C technologies designed for the transformation and formatting of XML data. The other parts of XSL are XSLT and XPath. Version 1.1 of XSL-FO was published in 2006.

XSL-FO is considered feature complete by W3C: the last update for the Working Draft was in January 2012, and its Working Group closed in November 2013.

==Basics==

Unlike the combination of HTML and CSS, XSL-FO is a unified presentational language. It has no semantic markup as this term is used in HTML. And, unlike CSS which modifies the default presentation of an external XML or HTML document, it stores all of the document&#x27;s data within itself.

The general idea behind XSL-FO&#x27;s use is that the user writes a document, not in FO, but in an XML language. XHTML, DocBook, and TEI are all possible examples. Then, the user obtains an XSLT transform, either by writing one themselves or by finding one for the document type in question. This XSLT transform converts the XML into XSL-FO.

Once the XSL-FO document is generated, it is then passed to an application called an FO processor. FO processors convert the XSL-FO document into something that is readable, printable or both. The most common output of XSL-FO is a PDF file or as PostScript, but some FO processors can output to other formats like RTF files or even just a window in the user&#x27;s GUI displaying the sequence of pages and their contents.

The XSLT language itself was originally conceived only for this purpose; it is now in widespread use for more general XML transformations. This transformation step is taken so much for granted in XSL-FO that it is not uncommon for people to call the XSLT that turns XML into XSL-FO the actual XSL-FO document itself. Even tutorials on XSL-FO tend to be written with XSLT commands around the FO processing instructions.

The XSLT transformation step is exceptionally powerful. It allows for the automatic generation of a table of contents, linked references, an index, and various other possibilities.

An XSL-FO document is not like a PDF or a PostScript document. It does not definitively describe the layout of the text on various pages. Instead, it describes what the pages look like and where the various contents go. From there, an FO processor determines how to position the text within the boundaries described by the FO document. The XSL-FO specification even allows different FO processors to have varying responses with regard to the resultant generated pages.

For example, some FO processors can hyphenate words to minimize space when breaking a line, while others choose not to. Different processors may even use different hyphenation algorithms, ranging from very simple to more complex hyphenation algorithms that take into account whether the previous or next line also is hyphenated. These will change, in some borderline cases quite substantially, the layout of the various pages. There are other cases where the XSL-FO specification explicitly allows FO processors some degree of choice with regard to layout.

This differentiation between FO processors, creating inconsistent results between processors is often not a concern. This is because the general purpose behind XSL-FO is to generate paged, printed media. XSL-FO documents themselves are usually used as intermediaries, mostly to generate either PDF files or a printed document as the final form to be distributed. This is as opposed to how HTML is generated and distributed as a final form directly to the user. Distributing the final PDF rather than the formatting language input (whether HTML/CSS or XSL-FO) means on the one hand that recipients aren&#x27;t affected by the unpredictability resulting from differences among formatting language interpreters, while on the other hand means that the document cannot easily adapt to different recipient needs, such as different page size or preferred font size, or tailoring for on-screen versus on-paper versus audio presentation.

==Language concepts==

The XSL-FO language was designed for paged media; as such, the concept of pages is an integral part of XSL-FO&#x27;s structure.

FO works best for what could be called &quot;content-driven&quot; design. This is the standard method of layout for books, articles, legal documents, and so forth. It involves a single flowing span of fairly contiguous text, with various repeating information built into the margins of a page. This is as opposed to &quot;layout-driven&quot; design, which is used in newspapers or magazines. If content in those documents does not fit in the required space, some of it is trimmed away until it does fit. XSL-FO does not easily handle the tight restrictions of magazine layout; indeed, in many cases, it lacks the ability to express some forms of said layout.

Despite the basic nature of the language&#x27;s design, it is capable of a great deal of expressiveness. Tables, lists, side floats, and a variety of other features are available. These features are comparable to CSS&#x27;s layout features, though some of those features are expected to be built by the XSLT.

==Document structure==

XSL-FO documents are XML documents, but they do not have to conform to any DTD or schema. Instead, they conform to a syntax defined in the XSL-FO specification.

XSL-FO documents contain two required sections. The first section details a list of named page layouts. The second section is a list of document data, with markup, that uses the various page layouts to determine how the content fills the various pages.

Page layouts define the properties of the page. They can define the directions for the flow of text, so as to match the conventions for the language in question. They define the size of a page as well as the margins of that page. More importantly, they can define sequences of pages that allow for effects where the odd and even pages look different. For example, one can define a page layout sequence that gives extra space to the inner margins for printing purposes; this allows more space to be given to the margin where the book will be bound.

The document data portion is broken up into a sequence of flows, where each flow is attached to a page layout. The flows contain a list of blocks which, in turn, each contain a list of text data, inline markup elements, or a combination of the two. Content may also be added to the margins of the document, for page numbers, chapter headings and the like.

Blocks and inline elements function in much the same way as for CSS, though some of the rules for padding and margins differ between FO and CSS. The direction, relative to the page orientation, for the progression of blocks and inlines can be fully specified, thus allowing FO documents to function under languages that are read different from English. The language of the FO specification, unlike that of CSS 2.1, uses direction-neutral terms like start and end rather than left and right when describing these directions.

XSL-FO&#x27;s basic content markup is derived from CSS and its cascading rules. As such, many attributes in XSL-FO propagate into the child elements unless explicitly overridden.

==Capabilities of XSL-FO v1.0==

XSL-FO is capable of a great deal of textual layout functionality. In addition to the information as specified above, XSL-FO&#x27;s language allows for the specification of the following.

===Multiple columns===

A page can be defined to have multiple columns. When this is the case, blocks flow from one column into the next by default. Individual blocks can be set to span all columns, creating a textual break in the page. The columns above this break will flow into each other, as will the columns below the break. But no text is allowed to flow from the above section to the below section.

Because of the nature of XSL-FO&#x27;s page specification, multiple pages may actually have different numbers and widths of columns. As such, text can flow from a 3 column page to a 5 column page to a 1 column page quite easily.

All FO features work within the restrictions of a multi-column page.
We can span multiple columns by specifying two attributes i.e.. span, padding-after .

===Lists===

An XSL-FO list is, essentially, two sets of blocks stacked side by side. An entry consists of a block on the &quot;left&quot;, or start inline direction, and a block sequence on the &quot;right&quot;, or end inline direction. The block on the left is conceptually what would be the number or bullet in a list. However, it could just as easily be a string of text, as one might see in a glossary entry. The block on the right works as expected. Both of these blocks can be block containers, or have multiple blocks in a single list entry.

Numbering of XSL-FO lists, when they are numbered, is expected to be done by the XSLT, or whatever other process, that generated the XSL-FO document. As such, number lists are to be explicitly numbered in XSL-FO.

===Pagination controls===

The user can specify Widow and Orphan for blocks or for the flow itself, and allow the attributes to cascade into child blocks. Additionally, blocks can be specified to be kept together on a single page. For example, an image block and the description of that image can be set to never be separated. The FO processor will do its best to adhere to these commands, even if it requires creating a great deal of empty space on a page.

===Footnotes===

The user can create footnotes that appear at the bottom of a page. The footnote is written, in the FO document, in the regular flow of text at the point where it is referenced. The reference is represented as an inline definition, though it is not required. The body is one or more blocks that are placed by the FO processor to the bottom of the page. The FO processor guarantees that wherever the reference is, the footnote cited by that reference will begin on the same page. This will be so even if it means creating extra empty space on a page.

===Tables===

An FO table functions much like an HTML/CSS table. The user specifies rows of data for each individual cell. The user can, also, specify some styling information for each column, such as background color. Additionally, the user can specify the first row as a table header row, with its own separate styling information.

The FO processor can be told exactly how much space to give each column, or it can be told to auto-fit the text in the table.

===Text orientation controls===

FO has extensive controls for orienting blocks of text. One can, in the middle of a page, designate a block of text to be oriented in a different orientation. These oriented blocks can be used for languages in a different orientation from the rest of the document, or simply if one needs to orient the text for layout purposes. These blocks can contain virtually any kind of content, from tables to lists or even other blocks of reoriented text.

===Miscellaneous===

* Page number citations. A page that contains a special tag can be cited in text, and the FO processor will fill in the actual page number where this tag appears.
* Block borders, in a number of styles.
* Background colors and images.
* Font controls and weighting, as in CSS.
* Side floats.
* Miscellaneous Inline Elements.

==Capabilities of XSL-FO v1.1==

Version 1.1 of XSL-FO adds a number of new features to version 1.0.

===Multiple flows and flow mapping===

XSL-FO 1.0 was fairly restrictive about what text was allowed to go in what areas of a page. Version 1.1 loosens these restrictions significantly, allowing flowing text to be mapped into multiple explicit regions on a page. This allows for more newspaper-like typesetting.

===Bookmarks===

Many output formats for XSL-FO processors, specifically PDF, have bookmarking features. These allow the format to specify a string of text in a separate window that can be selected by the user. When selected, the document window scrolls immediately to a specific region of the document.

XSL-FO v1.1 now provides the ability to create named bookmarks in XSL-FO, thus allowing the processor to pass this on to an output format that supports it.

===Indexing===

XSL-FO 1.1 has features that support the generation of an index that might be found at the back of a book. This is done through referencing of properly marked-up elements in the FO document.

===Last page citation===

The last page can be generated without providing an explicit in-document reference to a specific anchor in the FO document. The definition of &quot;last page&quot; can be restricted to within a specific set of pages or to cover the entire document. This allows the user to specify something like, &quot;Page 2 out of 15&quot;, where page 15 is the page number of a last page definition.

===Table markers===

Table markers allow the user to create dynamic content within table headers and footers, such as running totals at the bottom of each page of a table or &quot;table continued&quot; indicators.

===Inside/outside floats===

XSL-FO 1.1 adds the keywords &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; for side floats, which makes it possible to achieve page layouts with marginalia positioned on the outside or inside edges of pages. Inside refers to the side of the page towards the book binding, and outside refers to the side of a page away from the book binding.

===Refined graphic sizing===

XSL-FO 1.1 refines the functionality for sizing of graphics to fit, with the ability to shrink to fit (but not grow to fit), as well as the ability to define specific scaling steps. In addition, the resulting scaling factor can be referenced for display (for example, to say in a figure caption, &quot;image shown is 50% actual size&quot;).

==Advantages==

* XML language – Because it is an XML language, only an XSLT transform (and an XSLT processor) is required to generate XSL-FO code from any XML language. One can easily write a document in TEI or DocBook, and transform it into HTML for web viewing or PDF (through an FO processor) for printing. In fact, there are many pre-existing TEI and DocBook XSLTs for both of these purposes.
* Ease of use – Another advantage of XSL-FO is the relative ease of use. Much of the functionality of the language is based on work from CSS, so a CSS user will be familiar with the basics of the markup attributes. Understanding what a specific section of an FO document will look like is usually quite easy. 
* Low cost – Compared with commercial typesetting and page layout products, XSL-FO can offer a much lower cost solution when it otherwise meets the typographic and layout requirements (see below). The initial cost of ownership is low (zero if the free implementations, such as Apache FOP and xmlroff, meet your requirements), especially compared to the cost of commercial composition tools. The skills required (primarily XSLT programming) are widely available. There are a number of good books on XSL-FO as well as online resources and an active user community.
* Multi-lingual – XSL-FO has been designed to work for all written human languages and the implementations have largely achieved that goal. This makes XSL-FO particularly well suited for composing documents localized into a large number of national languages where the requirement is to have a single tool set that can compose all the language versions of documents. This is especially valuable for technical documentation for things like consumer electronics, where Asian and Middle Eastern languages are important because those parts of world represent huge markets for things like mobile phones and computer peripherals.
* Mature standard – With the publication of XSL-FO 1.1, XSL-FO is proving to be a mature standard with a number of solid commercial and non-commercial implementations. There is no other comparable standard for page composition.

==Drawbacks==
* Limited capabilities – XSL-FO was specifically designed to meet the requirements of &quot;lightly designed&quot; documents typified by technical manuals, business documents, invoices, and so on. While it can be and is used for more sophisticated designs, it is inherently limited in what it can do from a layout and typographic perspective. In particular, XSL-FO does not provide a direct way to get formatting effects that depend on knowing the page position relationship of two formatting objects. For example, there is no direct way to say &quot;if this thing is on the same page as that thing, then do X, otherwise do Y&quot;. This is an explicit design decision reflecting the two-stage, transform-based abstract processing model used by XSL-FO. This limitation can be addressed by implementing a multi-pass process. Unfortunately, there is currently no standard for how the result of the first pass would be communicated back to the second pass. Most, if not all, implementations provide some form of processable intermediate result format that can be used for this, but any such process implemented today would, by necessity, be implementation specific.
* By the same token, there are important layout features that are simply not in XSL-FO, either because they were not of high enough priority or because designing them was too difficult to allow inclusion in version 1.1, or because there were insufficient implementations to allow their inclusion in the final specification per W3C rules.
* In addition to these architectural limitations, the current XSL-FO implementations, both commercial and open source, do not provide the same level of typographic sophistication provided by high-end layout tools like QuarkXPress or InDesign, or by programmable typesetting systems like LaTeX. For example, no current implementation provides features for ensuring that text lines on facing pages are lined up vertically. There is nothing in the XSL-FO specification that prevents it but nothing that requires it either. For most documents for which a completely automated composition solution is sufficient, that level of typographic sophistication is not needed. However, for high-end publications and mass-market books, it usually is; in some cases this can be met by using XSLT to generate a LaTeX document instead.
* Extension dependency – When considering the applicability of XSL-FO to a particular document or document design, one must consider proprietary extensions provided by the different XSL-FO implementations. These extensions add features that are not part of the core specification. For example, one product adds support for Japanese typographic conventions that the XSL-FO specification does not address. However, use of these features makes such an XSL-FO system a little more bound to a specific implementation (but not completely bound as it would be when using a totally proprietary composition system.)
* Impractical manual editing – It is generally impractical to edit XSL-FO instances by hand (XSL-FO was designed for clarity and completeness, not ease of editing.). Visual editing tools such as XFDesigner can alleviate the task, although not all XSL-FO tags are accessible (most notably markers and footnotes). XF Designer is no longer a supported product from Ecrion Software. 

When trying to decide whether or not XSL-FO will work for a given document, the following typographic and layout requirements usually indicate that XSL-FO will not work (although some of these may be satisfied by proprietary extensions):

*Need to restart footnote numbers or symbol sequence on each new page (however, some implementations provide extensions to support automatic footnote numbering.)
*Need to run text around both sides of a floated object (XSL-FO can run text around one side and the top and/or bottom, but not both sides; however, some implementations provide support for such complex layouts via proprietary extensions.)
*Need to have variable numbers of columns on a single page (however, at least two commercial implementations provide extensions for creating multi-column blocks within a page.)
*Need to have column-wide footnotes (several implementations provide column footnote extensions.)
*Need to have marginalia that are dynamically placed relative to other marginalia (for example, marginal notes that are evenly spaced vertically on the page). XSL-FO only provides features for placing marginalia so that it is vertically aligned with its anchor.
*Need to create content that spreads across two pages as a float or &quot;out of line&quot; object in an otherwise homogeneous sequence of repeating page masters (this can be done in XSL-FO 1.1 using multiple body regions and flow maps, but it requires being able to control the page masters used for those pages.)
*Need both bottom-floated content and footnotes on the same page.
*Need to be able to run text against an arbitrary curve (though some implementation support SVG, which can be used to get around this limitation).
*Need to be able to constrain lines to specific baseline grids (for example, to achieve exact registration of lines on facing pages.)
*Anything that requires page-aware layout, such as ensuring that a figure always occurs on the page facing its anchor point.

== Replacement ==
XML and HTML standards, with the CSS standard, since CSS2 (paged media module) starts to supply basic features to printed media. With the CSS Paged Media Module Level 3, W3C is completing the formulation of an integrated standard for document formatting and to generate PDFs. So, since 2013, CSS3-paged is a W3C proposal for an XSL-FO replacement.

Design notes for a Version 2.0 of XSL Formatting Objects were first published in 2009 and last updated in 2012.

<text>Tafea is the southernmost of the six provinces of Vanuatu. The name is an acronym for the five main islands that make up the province: Tanna, Aneityum, Futuna, Erromango and Aniwa.

==History==

Unlike the other provinces of Vanuatu, the territorial integrity of this administrative unit has been unchanged since the times of the Condominium, when it was called &quot;Southern District&quot;, or &quot;Tanna&quot; after the main island. Only the capital moved from Lenakel to nearby Isangel, less than two kilometers more southeast.

A secessionist movement began in the 1970s, and the Nation of Tanna was proclaimed on 24 March 1974. While the British were more open to allowing its holdings in Vanuatu independence, it was opposed by the French colonists and finally suppressed by the Anglo-French Condominium authorities on 29 June 1974.

In 1980, there was another attempt to secede, declaring the Tafea Nation on 1 January 1980, its name coming from the initials of the five islands that were to be part of the nation (Tanna, Aniwa, Futuna, Erromango and Aneityum). British forces intervened on 26 May 1980, allowing the islands to become part of the newly independent nation of Vanuatu on 30 July 1980.

==Geography==

The province has a population of 32,540 people and an area of 1,628 km2. The main island, though second to Erromango in area, is Tanna, with some 80 percent of the province population, with the provincial capital of Isangel, and the largest village of Lenakel, both close together on the southwest coast.

The three larger islands are Melanesian, but the smaller two, Aniwa and Futuna, also known under the collective term &quot;Erronan Islands&quot;, are Polynesian outliers. Futuna is sometimes called West Futuna to distinguish it from Futuna Island, Wallis and Futuna.

The island of Tanna has the world&#x27;s most accessible volcano, Mount Yasur, with 1,084 meters the highest peak of the province. Aniwa Island is the only coral island, the other four are volcanic and reach much higher elevations than Aniwa.

Anatom is the southernmost island of Vanuatu (not counting the remote, tiny and uninhabited Matthew and Hunter Islands, to the southeast, which are disputed with New Caledonia, but which are considered by the people of Anatom Island part of their custom ownership). Its southeastern cape &quot;Nétchan Néganneaing&quot; is the southernmost point of land in Vanuatu, more southerly than the southern satellite islet Inyeug. The latter, however, is surrounded Intao Reef, that extends even further south, albeit submerged, thus being the southernmost feature of Vanuatu.

<text>Kim Jong-pil (; ; January 7, 1926 – June 23, 2018), also known colloquially as JP, was a South Korean politician and the founder/first director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA, now the National Intelligence Service). He served as prime minister twice, from 1971 to 1975 during the presidency of Park Chung Hee (1961–1979) and from 1998 to 2000 during the presidency of Kim Dae-jung (1998–2003). He was a nine-term National Assembly member.

Park Chung Hee was his uncle-in-law, as JP married Park&#x27;s niece, Park Young-ok.

== Early life ==
Kim Jong-pil was born in Buyeo County, South Chungcheong Province. He initially attended Seoul National University&#x27;s College of Education but graduated from the Korea Military Academy (KMA) in 1949 (8th graduating class). From September 1951 to March 1952, he studied at the U.S. Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He participated in the Korean War as an intelligence officer of the Republic of Korea Army. He retired as a brigadier general.

== Political career ==
After the April Revolution, a citizens&#x27; and students&#x27; uprising against the Syngman Rhee dictatorship and election fraud in 1960, he engineered the May 16 coup, led by Major General Park Chung Hee in 1961 with his fellow Korea Military Academy (8th graduating class) classmates. He served in several high-profile offices, including chairman of the ruling Democratic Republican Party during Park&#x27;s eighteen year presidency until his assassination in 1979.

Immediately following the successful coup that placed Park in power, Kim Jong-pil established the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), becoming its first director. The KCIA wielded unlimited and unchecked power in support of Park&#x27;s authoritarian rule, arbitrarily arresting, torturing, and persecuting Park&#x27;s political opponents.

Thereafter, Kim spearheaded the effort to establish official diplomatic relations with Japan. In 1962, he traveled to Tokyo, where he met with Japanese Prime Minister Ikeda Hayato and urged the immediate normalization of relations between the two nations, although Ikeda replied that more preparation was needed. Normalization was eventually achieved in 1965. According to the &quot;Kim-Ohira Memo&quot; exchanged between Japanese Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ohira and Kim Jong-pil at that time, South Korea agreed to waive any further compensation for Korean victims of Japanese war crimes in exchange for $300 million US dollars in grants and $500 million in other economic assistance.

In 1963, Kim founded the Democratic Republican Party which helped President Park Chung Hee strengthen his power and maintain a legislative supermajority during his presidency. From 1971 to 1975, he served as Prime Minister of South Korea. He assumed the same position from 1998 to 2000 during Kim Dae-jung&#x27;s presidency as part of the Alliance DJP.

In 1987, Kim Jong-pil staged a political comeback by creating a new political party known as the New Democratic Republican Party (NDRP). Most of the key party members and backers were conservatives who had served with him under the Park Chung Hee administration. Key members included Choi Gak-kyu, Kim Dong Kun (김동근 (1930)), Koo Ja-choon, Lee Hee-il, Kim Yong-tae, Cho Yong-jik, Kim Yong-hwan, Kim Moon-won, etc. As chairman of the NDRP, he ran for president and lost to Roh Tae-woo of the ruling Democratic Justice Party (DJP). In the 13th National Assembly legislative elections held in April 1988, the NDRP won 35 seats out of the 299-seat National Assembly.

In January 1990, Kim Jong-pil led the merger of his party with the ruling DJP and opposition party, Kim Young-sam’s Reunification Democratic Party (RDP) to create the Democratic Liberal Party (DLP). Jong-pil became the Executive Chairman of the newly formed DLP and Kim Young-sam became the party&#x27;s presidential nominee in the 1992 South Korea presidential elections, which he won.

The outline of Kim Jong-pil&#x27;s positions hardly describes the skills of the politician in navigating the complexities of South Korean politics. Scholars note that he mastered the art of political coalitions. This is demonstrated in the way he was able to reemerge politically stronger after suffering various political setbacks. For instance, by October 1997, Kim Jong-pil&#x27;s popularity had fluctuated, hovering between 2.9 percent and 4.6 percent, which was attributed to his reputation as being an integral member of the authoritarian rule of Park Chung-hee. part. This was further aggravated by the conservative party&#x27;s image problem, which was identified with old politicians who have ethical flaws. Also, it is important to note that his main regional power base, the Chungcheon province, lacks the intense and unwavering loyalty to its political &#x27;leaders&#x27; that is often found among those from neighbouring regions such as Chollado or Gyeongsangdo provinces.

Through clever political maneuvering, however, Kim Jong-pil struck a power-sharing deal with Kim Dae-jung&#x27;s National Congress for New Politics, known as the DJP Alliance, which allowed him to choose half of the cabinet members of the Kim Dae-Jung administration. The deal also included his appointment as prime minister in March 1998 during Kim Dae-jung&#x27;s presidency (1998-2003) for the second time.

In 2004, he announced his retirement from politics after his bid for a tenth term in the National Assembly failed and his party, the United Liberal Democrats, was unable to gain a sizable number of seats in the 2004 parliamentary election. The party later merged into the Grand National Party.

Kim Jong Pil was the last of the &quot;Three Kims,&quot; which refers to himself, Kim Young-sam, and Kim Dae-jung, who dominated South Korea&#x27;s politics for decades. Fate saw the presidency barely elude him on several occasions, earning him the title &quot;the perennial no. 2 man.&quot; It is important to note Chungcheong province, JP&#x27;s main regional power base, lacks the intense and unwavering loyalty to its political leaders that is often found among those from neighboring regions, such as Jeolla and Gyeongsang provinces.

== Scouting ==
He served as Korea Scout Association President until June 6, 1969. In 1967 he received the highest distinction of the Scout Association of Japan, the Golden Pheasant Award.

== Ancestry ==
He is the 12th generation descendant of Kim Ye-jik, a military officer who served at Injo Coup in 1623 during the early Joseon period, and a younger brother of Royal Noble Consort Gongbin. Both are children of Kim Hui-Cheol, known as Internal Prince Haeryeong, the Musin who was killed during the Imjin War in 1592. Hui-Cheol is great-grandson of Kim Young-jeong, both of them were civil ministers also during early Joseon period. Kim Young-Jeong is the 7th generation descendant of Kim Mok-kyung, the ancestor of the Gyeong branch of Gimhae Kim clan and the Samjungdaegwang during the reign of King Chunghye of Goryeo. Their lineage can be traced back to Kim Sam-kwang who was the son of Kim Yu-sin. This makes him a descendant of the royal family of Geumgwan Gaya.

This fact is also revealed in the 2001 sentimental letter written to &quot;Bhimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra&quot;, a king of erstwhile Ayodhya state with a history of 200 years old, Kim talked about his March 2001 visit to India. He mentioned it &quot;remained very meaningful to me&quot; as it &quot;fulfilled his desire to visit Ayodhya, a princess of which became the queen of King Suro of Gaya and Heo Hwang-ok. I am the 72nd generation descendant of the King Kim Suro of the Garak Kingdom.&quot;

Kim was amongst more than a hundred historians and government representatives, including the North Korean ambassador to India, and an 18-member delegation from South Korea – led by former Gimhae Mayor Song Eun-bok – composed of prominent industrialists who inaugurated a memorial to their royal ancestor, Queen Hwang Huh on the west bank of the &quot;River Sarayu&quot;. The monument was built using a three-metre high stone weighing 7,500 kg, specially shipped from South Korea.

== Private life ==
On February 15, 1951, Kim married Park Young-ok (October 30, 1929 – February 21, 2015), who was President Park Chung Hee&#x27;s niece. This made Park his uncle by marriage.

In 2008, Kim was hospitalized at Soonchunhyang Hospital in Seoul when he suffered a severe stroke while staying at his Seoul home, Then, in August 2009, Kim was unable to attend the state funeral of former President Kim Dae-jung due to illness. He spent four years in seclusion in his home. in April 2013, Kim attended the KBS Symphony Orchestra which was held at the Sejong Center in Seoul. 

Kim died on June 23, 2018, at Sindang-dong, Seoul at the age of 92. His state funeral was held on June 24, 2018, and he was buried alongside his wife.

<doc id="606309" wikidata="Q1107344" url="?curid=606309" title="Great Cipher">
<text>The Great Cipher (French: &quot;Grand chiffre&quot;) was a nomenclator cipher developed by the Rossignols, several generations of whom served the French monarchs as cryptographers. The Great Cipher was so named because of its excellence and because it was reputed to be unbreakable.

Modified forms were in use by the French Peninsular army until the summer of 1811. After it fell out of current use, many documents in the French archives were unreadable until it was decoded.

== Historical background ==
Antoine Rossignol&#x27;s cryptographic skills became known in 1626, when an encrypted letter was taken from a messenger leaving the city of Réalmont, controlled by the Huguenots and surrounded by the French army. The letter stated that the Huguenots would not be able to hold on to the city for much longer, and by the end of the day, Rossignol had successfully deciphered it. The French returned the letter with the deciphered message and forced the Huguenots to surrender. He and his son, Bonaventure Rossignol, were soon appointed to prominent roles in the court.

Together, the two devised a cipher so strong that it baffled cryptanalysts for centuries. Commandant Étienne Bazeries managed to break the cipher around 1893 over a period of three years by realising that each number stood for a French syllable, rather than single letters, unlike traditional ciphers. He guessed that a particular sequence of repeated numbers, 124-22-125-46-345, stood for &quot;les ennemis&quot; (&quot;the enemies&quot;) and from that information was able to unravel the entire cipher.

=== The Man in the Iron Mask ===

In one of the encrypted letters between Louis XIV and his marshal Nicolas de Catinat appeared a possible solution to the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask. The letter concerned a general named Vivien de Bulonde who was to attack the Italian town of Cuneo but instead fled, fearing the arrival of the Austrians, and consequently put in serious danger the success of the entire French campaign in Piedmont. The letter said:

His Majesty knows better than any other person the consequences of this act, and he is also aware of how deeply our failure to take the place will prejudice our cause, a failure which must be repaired during the winter. His Majesty desires that you immediately arrest General Bulonde and cause him to be conducted to the fortress of Pignerole, where he will be locked in a cell under guard at night, and permitted to walk the battlement during the day with a 330 309.

The &quot;330&quot; and &quot;309&quot; codegroups appeared only once in the correspondence, so it is impossible to confirm what they stand for. Bazeries verified General Bulonde was disgraced and removed from command, so he reasoned 330 and 309 stood for &quot;masque&quot; and a full stop. However, none of the cipher variants used in the Iron Mask period included &quot;masque&quot;, an unlikely word to include in the cipher&#x27;s small repertory.

== Technical nature ==

The basis of the code cracked by Bazeries was a set of 587 numbers that stood for syllables. There were other variations, and Louis XIV&#x27;s overseas ministers were sent different code sheets that encrypted not only syllables but also letters and words. To counter frequency analysis, some number sets were &quot;nulls&quot;, meant to be ignored by the intended recipient. Others were traps, including a codegroup that meant to ignore the previous codegroup. 

As a nomenclator cipher, the Great Cipher replaced the names of key generals such as Auguste de Marmont, references to &quot;les ennemis&quot; and other sensitive terms with homophonic substitutions. Code sheets included alternative digits to modify the gender or letter case and so the rules of French composition held true to encryptions as well. Since &quot;e&quot; is the most commonly used letter in French, the Cipher typically allocated the most code numbers to writing that vowel. In one nomenclature, 131 out of the 711 code numbers stood for &quot;e&quot;.

<doc id="606311" wikidata="Q3306847" url="?curid=606311" title="G'Kar">
<text>G&#x27;Kar ( ) is a fictional character in &quot;Babylon 5&quot; played by Andreas Katsulas. He is a Narn and initially appears as a villainous diplomat opposite Londo Mollari, being constantly engaged in insidious, if petty, and often comical schemes. He is usually driven by his hostility to his people&#x27;s historical enemies the Centauri, whom Londo represents. Over the course of the series, he is transformed into a Messianic figure and the foremost spiritual leader of his people.

== Character History ==

=== Early life ===
In Babylon 5, G&#x27;Kar was a pouchling during the first Centauri occupation of his homeworld. His family served as servants in a Centauri household. This was when the Narn resistance movement was gaining strength and their increased aggression was slowly driving the Centauri out of Narn.

After G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s mother became very ill, only he and his father remained fit enough to serve in their Centauri master&#x27;s household. One day his father accidentally spilled a bowl of hot &quot;jala&quot; upon the mistress of the house. As punishment, his father was beaten to a pulp and hung up on their family prayer tree. He lasted for three days before he finally died. G&#x27;Kar was with him, and his father told him just before he died that he was proud of him, and to do all the things that he could not – Fight the Centauri.

In a rage, G&#x27;Kar ran away and killed his first Centauri that very day. He later on joined the resistance movement. After the Centauri were driven off, he worked in the military, participating in at least one invasion during the expansion of the Narn Regime (the Tuchanq). By his admission later on, during this invasion, he participated in atrocities.

In addition, G&#x27;Kar dealt with the Earth Alliance during the Earth-Minbari War to secretly sell desperately needed weapons that could be effective against the seemingly invincible Minbari. To G&#x27;Kar, the fact that this profitable exchange could also falsely implicate the Centauri Republic (since the Narn were selling Centauri weapons that were left behind as the result of the Centauri withdrawal from Narn space) was worth the risk of incurring the wrath of the Minbari themselves. Regardless, G&#x27;Kar also assisted in efforts to explore an opportunity for a peace settlement for the war offered by the Head of the Rangers while he offered to grant asylum to John Sheridan and a few compatriots.

=== Career ===
G&#x27;Kar was Narn ambassador to Babylon 5, and a member of the third circle of the Kha&#x27;Ri, the heart and the ruling body of Narn Regime. During his time as ambassador, he was notorious for his hatred of Londo Mollari, and of the Centauri Republic Mollari represented. His hatred led G&#x27;Kar in 2258 to be a party to various underhanded schemes intended to further the goals of his government whether they be sheltering the notorious Dilgar war criminal, Deathwalker, to attempting to incite riots on the station.

In mid-2259, the dying Centauri Emperor Turhan visited Babylon 5 to &quot;stand with a Narn in neutral territory and apologize&quot; for all the evil and suffering the Centauri have inflicted upon the Narn. G&#x27;kar was prepared to assassinate the Emperor before he learned of this. After the Emperor&#x27;s intentions were relayed to him, he sought Mollari and offered him a drink in celebration of a new understanding between their two peoples.

By a sad irony, at that point, Mollari had already arranged for the Shadows to attack the Narn base on Quadrant 14 to ensure that Refa and his allies could consolidate their power on the eve of the Centauri Emperor&#x27;s death. After learning of the attack on Quadrant 14 “by the Centauri”, G&#x27;Kar attempted to attack Mollari but was stopped by Sheridan. Sheridan gave G&#x27;Kar a choice – if he attacked Mollari, he might very well end up dead and would be of no use to his people. But if he restrained himself, he would stay alive and be able to help his people greatly (this proved true, as G&#x27;Kar became instrumental in the war against the Shadows and the later liberation of Narn). In a feat of tremendous self-restraint, G&#x27;Kar stayed his hand. Instead, he sat on the ground, weeping.

=== The Narn-Centauri War ===
After the second Narn-Centauri war, and the subsequent surrender of the Narn Regime, G&#x27;Kar was the only member of the Kha&#x27;Ri not captured. Mollari returned to Babylon 5 after having watched the bombardment of Narn by the Centauri using mass-drivers. Mollari proceeded to deliver the terms of the Narn surrender, including the arrest of all members of the Kha&#x27;Ri. However, because he had asked for sanctuary, G&#x27;Kar had already been placed under the protection both Babylon 5 and of the Minbari Federation for as long as G&#x27;Kar remained &quot;on&quot; the station. Nevertheless, Londo had G&#x27;Kar removed from the Council as he was no longer the official representative of Narn.

Instead of leaping across the room to snap Mollari&#x27;s neck, G&#x27;Kar calmly rose and addressed the council;

=== “Enlightenment” ===
During the six months or so after the Narn-Centauri war, G&#x27;Kar had offered much assistance to the underground resistance back on Narn. In exchange for G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s cooperation in toning down these activities, Sheridan was able to pressure the Centauri into releasing the Narn colonists on Quadrant 14. He maintained control of the Narn aboard Babylon 5 to ensure that the others would be more sympathetic to their plight. He also helped expose a plot to use Babylon 5 as a Centauri munitions drop point. Also, with help from Michael Garibaldi, he was able to establish a safe location for smuggling weapons into Narn and its colonies.

G&#x27;kar spent the later part of the year 2259 as well as early 2260 being obsessed with avenging his people against the Centauri in general, and Mollari in particular. He maintained the steady flow of smuggled weapons onto Narn. As the last of the Kha&#x27;Ri still free, G&#x27;Kar inspired those on his homeworld to rise and resist their would-be invaders. His authority was challenged, at one point, by a fellow Narn, Na&#x27;Far, who was appointed by the Centauri as the new official ambassador of the Regime to Babylon 5. However, Na&#x27;Far not only failed, his bodyguard, Ta&#x27;Lon (whom Sheridan had saved on a Streib ship), became G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s most avid follower and confidant.

A few months later, G&#x27;Kar obtained a highly illegal Earth drug known as “Dust”, which gives the user temporary but incredibly powerful telepathic abilities. G&#x27;Kar intended to use this weapon to fight the Centauri, but the effects on Narn physiology were unknown; the Narns had no surviving heritage of telepaths. He opted to use himself as a test subject, with great success – he was able to abduct and telepathically mutilate Mollari (severely beating both him and his assistant, Vir Cotto, in an amazing display of superior Narn strength), and learn many of his secrets, including his role in instigating the second Narn-Centauri war, as well as the “embarrassing” circumstances that led to his assignment on Babylon 5.

However, as the drug wore off, he experienced what he believed to be a religious revelation from his “father figures”, namely the Narn holy figure G&#x27;Quan, his own biological father, and the angelic being called G&#x27;Lan (all of which were actually Vorlon Ambassador Kosh Naranek, who also used a “father figure” when he appeared to Sheridan months later). In his vision, G&#x27;Kar was told to let go of his hatred and serve a higher cause – the survival of his race and of everyone. To achieve this, he, and the Narns, had to become willing to sacrifice themselves. As the G&#x27;Quan apparition puts it:

G&#x27;Kar was arrested for this attack and pleaded guilty. He allowed himself to be placed in Babylon 5&#x27;s brig, where he dedicated himself to meditating on his revelation, eventually writing down his thoughts and observations. He was released early, due to the fighting between Earth forces and Babylon 5. He promised to assist the humans – and delivered, providing Babylon 5 with a Narn security force to replace those soldiers who remained loyal to Earth.

=== Liberation of Narn ===
When Michael Garibaldi was kidnapped, G&#x27;Kar went searching for him, only to be captured by Centauri forces and taken to Centauri Prime. There he was presented as a gift to Londo Mollari by Emperor Cartagia. However, Cartagia first decided to torture G&#x27;Kar. He endured much and was even tortured by Cartagia himself, but G&#x27;Kar refused to give him the satisfaction of hearing him cry out in pain. He revealed this to Londo and Vir; Mollari then explained if he did not scream soon G&#x27;Kar would most definitely die. This refusal to scream under torture has been shown previously during Season 1 when G&#x27;kar was being tortured with paingivers by a Narn assassin. Londo and Vir decided to act fast as they knew they would need G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s help to kill Cartagia. Mollari approached G&#x27;Kar in secret and explained that Cartagia was sadistic and insane, and that the fate of both the Narn and Centauri people depended on his removal from the throne. Mollari offered a deal – if G&#x27;Kar would assist by providing a distraction at the proper moment, Mollari himself would assassinate the mad emperor, and then use his influence to free him.

Assuming G&#x27;Kar would agree, Mollari turned to leave. G&#x27;Kar replied by saying that Mollari did not ask the price, and that he would only agree to it if Mollari would use his influence to free Narn. Mollari pointed out that G&#x27;Kar was in no position to make demands. G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s response was, “Neither are you.” Soon after this conversation Cartagia held one last torture session with G&#x27;Kar that Londo and Vir witnessed. He ordered a soldier to whip him with an energy whip that would kill any Narn with forty strokes and stated that the whipping would not stop until he heard the scream he so much wanted. G&#x27;Kar held until the last whip stroke, and only screamed as it was necessary to save his people. Soon after this Londo convinced Cartagia to travel to the Narn homeworld to judge G&#x27;Kar there. But before they left Cartagia ordered a guard to gouge one of G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s eyes out, as he did not like how he looked at him.

(The number of whiplashes G&#x27;Kar received was 39 – the same number that Pilate ordered Jesus to be given.)

When they arrived at Narn, they made preparations for the assassination and it succeeded, albeit with Mollari&#x27;s aide Vir Cotto inadvertently killing Cartagia. Mollari kept his word and freed both G&#x27;Kar and the Narn people. The Narn then offered G&#x27;Kar the chance to rule the planet, which he flatly refused in favor of a new Kha&#x27;Ri that he insisted must be formed, and citing the fact that he did not endure so much pain and personal suffering to remove one tyrant from his planet, only to become one himself.

Shortly after returning to Babylon 5, he is visited by Garibaldi, who was genuinely apologetic for G&#x27;Kar having to endure so much torture, simply for looking for him. G&#x27;Kar explained that Garibaldi was one of the few non-Narn friends he had, and far from being angry, he was actually quite grateful. In doing so, G&#x27;Kar said he was put in precisely the right place at precisely the right time to free his people, something which would never have happened had Garibaldi not been kidnapped in the first place.

=== Declaration of Principles ===
Upon his return to Babylon 5, he resumed his role as Narn Ambassador, and was instrumental in the founding of the Interstellar Alliance. G&#x27;Kar was a member of that organization&#x27;s advisory council, and wrote the Declaration of Principles. A later draft of these principles read as follows:

Immediately after this draft was approved by all members of the ISA, G&#x27;Kar insisted that it be recalled, as he had written a better version. While ISA President John Sheridan did agree that this version was better, the text of that version is unknown, and no record exists whether this improved version was also approved.

=== Londo’s bodyguard and rise to “holiness” ===

Later, when Mollari returned to Centauri Prime to investigate potential corruption in the Centauri Court, Minbari Ambassador Delenn requested that G&#x27;Kar return with Mollari as his bodyguard. G&#x27;Kar accepted, if only to see the looks on the faces of the Centauri court. Upon his return to Babylon 5, he discovered that the book of religious observations he had been writing had been “liberated” by a friend (his former bodyguard, Ta&#x27;Lon), who believed him dead, and published as &quot;Book of G&#x27;Kar&quot;. It was received well, and its popularity was approaching that of the Book of G&#x27;Quan. G&#x27;Kar had – quite unwittingly and unwillingly – become a holy figure.

G&#x27;Kar found his new holy status very frustrating; While many Narn were coming to him for guidance, they were more interested in applying their own interpretation of his words, or focusing on some things he had said while ignoring others – even when he himself was insisting otherwise. His sermons, however, were often quite inspired. For example, when asked “What is truth, and what is God?” he explained:

His popularity was creating political pressure on the restored Kha&#x27;Ri as well, who finally insisted that he either come home to rule or publicly give them his blessing. The last straw was when he was forced to bluntly rebuke a particularly obnoxious would-be worshipper, and the offended admirer attempted to assassinate him in retaliation, but ended up severely wounding Garibaldi&#x27;s fiancée instead. G&#x27;Kar decided to leave Babylon 5 and explore the galaxy with Lyta Alexander, knowing that he could do no more for his people there and that to stay would only cause more unrest. He appointed Ta&#x27;Lon as his successor. Ta&#x27;Lon was quite surprised by the selection, but in a recorded message, G&#x27;Kar explained he had become a distraction for his people, and that a position such as G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s required one to be equal parts warrior and priest. G&#x27;Kar felt he had become more priest than warrior, and to create a balance, someone who was more warrior than priest was required to succeed him: someone like Ta&#x27;Lon.

As in depicted in the TV movie, &quot;Legend of the Rangers&quot;, G&#x27;Kar plays a role in reforming the Rangers when he defended Ranger David Martel from dismissal for withdrawing from battle when his ship is severely damaged to the point where it lost all practical fighting ability. Ambassador G&#x27;Kar convinces the Rangers&#x27; ruling council that they were being unreasonable for seeking to punish a ranger for merely exercising appropriate prudence for the sake of his crew. When Martel and his crew became the heroes of the hour by saving an ambassadorial party, which included G&#x27;Kar himself, from The Hand, the Narn&#x27;s argument was vindicated.

G&#x27;Kar would later return to Babylon 5 at least once more for a diplomatic conference.

=== Death ===
G&#x27;Kar died in 2278 while locked in combat with the Drakh Keeper controlling Londo Mollari&#x27;s body. (Londo was tired of living and requested that G&#x27;Kar kill both him and Drakh). The sacrifice of G&#x27;Kar and Londo allowed Sheridan, Delenn, and their son David to escape from Centauri Prime.

=== Aftermath ===
After the death of G&#x27;Kar in Centauri Prime, Emperor Vir Cotto honored G&#x27;Kar and Londo&#x27;s sacrifice by building a gigantic statue of them at the main gates to the Centauri capital city. These statues were built so that the two men were standing guard over the city, and watching each other&#x27;s backs. The Book of G&#x27;Kar continued to gain popularity following his death, and along with G&#x27;Quan he became one of the most widely read authors amongst the Narn. Shortly before he died in 2281, John Sheridan had one last meal with his friends. During the toast for all those who had died, Michael Garibaldi eulogized G&#x27;Kar.

== Actor History ==
Andreas Katsulas died on February 13, 2006, due to lung cancer. As a result, except for archival footage, the character of G&#x27;Kar will not make any future appearances in &quot;Babylon 5&quot;-related television or movie productions. In the &quot;Babylon 5: The Lost Tales&quot; 2007 anthology, it is explained that both G&#x27;Kar and Stephen Franklin, who was played by Richard Biggs (deceased in 2004), had left to explore space beyond the galactic rim.

== Reception and literary analysis ==
G&#x27;Kar has been subject to literary analysis, for example as a leader. According to Kimberly Yost, initially an antagonist (&quot;an angry and self-righteously indignant&quot;), he &quot;evolves to a sympathetic freedom fighter, democratic idealist and spiritual leader&quot;. Yost also notes that treatment of G&#x27;Kar and the Narns in general is relevant to the discourse of racism. Due to Narn having reptilian (if humanoid) appearance, their &quot;monstrous&quot; appearance led to issues of trust when dealing with other races.

<doc id="606320" wikidata="Q835586" url="?curid=606320" title="Prime Minister of Serbia">
<text>The prime minister of Serbia (; feminine: премијерка/premijerka), officially the president of the Government of the Republic of Serbia (; feminine: председница/predsednica) is the head of the government of Serbia. The role of the prime minister is to direct the work of the government, and submits to the National Assembly the government&#x27;s program, including a list of proposed ministers. The resignation of the prime minister results in the dismissal of the government.

The first officeholder was Matija Nenadović, who became prime minister on 27 August 1805. The current prime minister, Miloš Vučević (who is also the current president of the Serbian Progressive Party) was nominated by the president of the Republic, Aleksandar Vučić, and elected and appointed along with his cabinet by the National Assembly on 2 May 2024. On 28 January 2025, Vučević resigned amidst mass protests in Serbia regarding the Novi Sad railway station canopy collapse. He remains in acting capacity until the National Assembly acknowledges his resignation.

==History of the office==
During the period of Revolutionary Serbia, the title of the principal executive minister was President of the Governing Council (; ). Initially the Council had no ministers, just members, but in 1811 modern ministries were created. Government ceased to exist with the collapse of the First Serbian Uprising on 3 October 1813, however later continued in exile in Hotin (Russian Empire) from 1813 until 1814.

Government was restored on 21 November 1815 following the Second Serbian Uprising. Head of government was styled Prince&#x27;s Representative (Књажевски представник / &quot;Knjaževski predstavnik&quot;). The style remained official until 1861, even after the establishing of constitutional government in 1835. Prior to that date, the office was of no major importance or influence and depended solely on the will of the Prince Miloš Obrenović.

From 1861 until 1903, the head of government was styled President of the Ministry (Председник министарства / &quot;Predsednik ministarstva&quot;).

From 1903 until the creation of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes on 1 December 1918, head of government was styled President of the Council of Ministers (Председник Министарског савета / &quot;Predsednik Ministarskog saveta&quot;).

Under the communist regime after 1945, Serbia got a sort of separate KPJ-appointed government opposed to the German-installed one in September 1941. First, the &#x27;head of government&#x27; was styled President of the Executive Council of the Supreme National Liberational Council until 7 March 1945. On that day, a ministry for Serbia was created within the government of Yugoslavia (as for all the other five republics), with Minister for Serbia being in charge of creating first one-party government of post-War Serbia, which took place on 9 April 1945. Governments were headed by President of the Government until 3 February 1953, President of the Executive Council until 15 January 1991 and again President of the Government since then, but the term Prime Minister is colloquially used (especially in the media) since the government of Dragutin Zelenović in 1991. In some later articles about the recent history of Serbia, term is retroactively applied to Stanko Radmilović, Desimir Jevtić and even back to Ivan Stambolić&#x27;s government.

<text>Benjamin &quot;Yellow Benjy&quot; Melendez (August 3, 1952 – May 28, 2017) was best known for brokering the gang truce in the Bronx and Harlem (New York City) in 1971. At that time, he was President of the Ghetto Brothers, a mainly ethnically Puerto Rican South Bronx gang, and lead vocalist of a musical group also known as the Ghetto Brothers.

Melendez was heavily involved in the rise of Puerto Rican nationalist consciousness among Nuyorican youth, having forged connections with the Puerto Rican Socialist Party. Melendez&#x27;s family, including Melendez himself, were Conversos (Sephardic crypto-Jews), practicing their religion in secret even in the 1970s while being part of a Hispanic community.

Melendez was a subject in the 2015 documentary, &quot;Rubble Kings&quot;, which depicts events leading up to and following the Hoe Avenue peace meeting.

Melendez died May 28, 2017, at the age of 64.

<doc id="606331" wikidata="Q2943695" url="?curid=606331" title="Cecil Fielder">
<text>Cecil Grant Fielder (; born September 21, 1963) is an American former professional baseball designated hitter and first baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB). Fielder was a power hitter in the 1980s and 1990s. He attended college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). He played in MLB for the Toronto Blue Jays (1985–1988), in Japan&#x27;s Central League for the Hanshin Tigers (1989), and then in MLB for the Detroit Tigers (1990–1996), New York Yankees (1996–97), Anaheim Angels in 1998, and Cleveland Indians in 1998. With the Yankees, he won the 1996 World Series over the Atlanta Braves. In 1990, he became the first player to reach the 50–home run mark since George Foster hit 52 for the Cincinnati Reds in 1977 and the first American League player to do so since Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris famously hit 54 and 61 in 1961.

He is the father of Prince Fielder, who similarly established himself as a premier power hitter during his career. The Fielders are the only father and son to both have 50-home run seasons in MLB history, and were the only father–son duo to have 40–home run seasons until 2021, when they were joined by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and his own father.

==Early career==
Fielder attended Nogales High School in La Puente, California. He was named an All-American while playing for the school&#x27;s baseball team in 1981. He enrolled at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), where he played college baseball for the UNLV Rebels baseball team. Fielder was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 31st round (767th overall) of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. He was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the fourth round (67th overall) of the 1982 MLB draft, and this time did sign. On February 5, 1983, Fielder was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for Leon Roberts.

The Blue Jays promoted Fielder to the major leagues on July 18, 1985. Fielder became a part-time first and third baseman for the Blue Jays, sharing playing time with Willie Upshaw and Fred McGriff. Fielder hit .243 with 31 home runs and 84 runs batted in (RBI) across four seasons with the team, earning $125,000 in his final season.

==Hanshin Tigers==
The Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s Central League signed Fielder after the 1988 season, paying him $1,050,000 ($1,968,644 today), including a chauffeur and a full-time interpreter. More than the money, he said, he went to Japan for the opportunity to play every day. In the beginning of spring training, Fielder had a difficult time adjusting to Japan&#x27;s baseball culture. However, with the help of Tiger manager Minoru Murayama and Junichi Kashiwabara, he became adjusted to the new environment. The Tigers offered Fielder the position of cleanup hitter, and he became a hero to the local baseball fans, who nicknamed him &quot;Wild Bear&quot; (&quot;wild&quot;, in Japan, is the image of power; &quot;bear&quot;, for his hulking presence). Fielder batted .302 and hit 38 home runs and 81 RBI for Hanshin in 1989.

==Detroit Tigers==
On January 15, 1990, Fielder signed a two-year, $3 million contract with the Detroit Tigers. In his first season with the Tigers, Fielder hit .277 while leading the major leagues with 51 home runs and 132 RBI in 159 games. On the last day of the Tigers&#x27; season at Yankee Stadium, Fielder hit his 50th and 51st home runs to become the 11th player in MLB history – and only the second in the previous 25 years – to reach the 50 home run plateau. No Tigers player had turned the mark since Hank Greenberg slugged 58 in 1938, and no Tiger player has reached 50 home runs since. Fielder, whose previous high mark was 14 with Toronto in 1987, provided a sudden and unexpected emergence as a legitimate slugger. In addition to home runs and RBI, Fielder also led the majors in slugging percentage (.592) and strikeouts (182), and he led the American League in total bases (339). After the season, he finished as the runner-up for the AL MVP Award. In 1990, Fielder also became the ninth major leaguer to record two three-home run games in a season.

Fielder enjoyed a successful second season with the Tigers in 1991, batting .261 with 44 home runs and 133 RBI in 162 games. He again led the majors in home runs and RBI, and joined Hank Greenberg (1937–38) as the only Tiger players at that time to hit 40 or more homers in consecutive seasons (Miguel Cabrera joined Fielder and Greenberg in 2012–13). Fielder was again the runner-up in the AL MVP balloting for the second consecutive year. 

On January 29, 1992, Fielder avoided salary arbitration by agreeing to a one-year, $4.5million contract, which at the time set a record for highest salary by an arbitration-eligible player. Fielder responded by hitting 35 home runs and leading the league in RBI (124) for the third consecutive season, becoming the first American Leaguer since Babe Ruth to do so.

During the 1990s, Fielder built a reputation for clutch hitting and power, though the Tigers continued to be no better than mediocre. His team&#x27;s fates possibly hurt him with MVP voters. Rickey Henderson and Cal Ripken Jr. narrowly edged him for the AL&#x27;s MVP Award in 1990 and 1991, respectively. His new fans in Detroit nicknamed him &quot;Big Daddy&quot; for his big smile, peaceful temperament, and prodigious home runs (as well as his massive physical stature).

In his six-year tenure with Detroit, Fielder had four consecutive 30-homer and 100-RBI seasons. He had 28 home runs and 90 RBIs in 109 games during the 1994 season before it was ended by a player strike, denying him a chance to extend his accomplishments to a fifth season. He also became the first Tiger to hit at least 25 home runs in six consecutive seasons. No player in Detroit history hit as many over a six-year period (219) until Miguel Cabrera hit 227 in 2008–13, and no major league player had more home runs between 1990 and 1995.

Fielder was a member of the All-Star Team in 1990, 1991, and 1993. Fielder was named &quot;Tiger of the Year&quot; by the Detroit chapter of the BBWAA in 1990, 1991, and 1992. He is the only player to receive the award three consecutive years.

On January 8, 1993, Fielder signed a five-year, $36million contract with the Tigers; which made him the highest paid player in baseball for two seasons (1995 and 1996).

Fielder had a reputation for being a slow baserunner. In 1996, he set a major league record by taking 1,096 games to record his first career stolen base, which occurred on a botched hit and run. He stole another base that season as well, and finished his career with two stolen bases over 13 seasons and 1,470 games. Fielder also had a reputation as a below average fielder, mostly caused by his poor speed and range. He was, however, considered a competent defensive first baseman when it came to putouts and digging infield assists out of the dirt.

Fielder&#x27;s massive power was exemplified by two long home runs:

*He was one of only four players, and the only Tiger, to homer over the left-field roof at Tiger Stadium (the other three are Harmon Killebrew, Frank Howard and Mark McGwire). He hit the homer off Oakland Athletics pitcher Dave Stewart on August 25, 1990.
*He also hit the only home run to ever travel completely out of Milwaukee County Stadium—during either the Braves&#x27; Milwaukee history (1953–1965) or Brewers&#x27; park history (1970–2000). It was hit off the Brewers&#x27; Dan Plesac on September 14, 1991.
Fielder played his final season for the Tigers in 1996, batting .248 with 26 home runs and 80 RBI in 107 games before being traded.

==Later career==
Fielder was traded to the New York Yankees on July 31, 1996, for Rubén Sierra and Matt Drews. He batted .260 with 13 home runs and 37 RBI in 53 games with the Yankees. Fielder&#x27;s acquisition was integral in the Yankees&#x27; World Series championship that year, as he won the Babe Ruth Award for most outstanding performance in the 1996 postseason. In 14 postseason games, Fielder hit .308 (16-for-52) with two doubles, three home runs and 14 RBI.

Despite requesting a trade at the end of the 1996 season, Fielder ultimately remained with the Yankees in 1997. On July 15, Fielder suffered a broken thumb after an awkward slide during a game against the Cleveland Indians, and the subsequent surgery caused him to miss eight weeks. He returned to the team on September 15. In 98 games, Fielder batted .260 with 13 home runs and 61 RBI. In the 1997 American League Division Series, he recorded one hit in eight at bats (.125) with one RBI in the Yankees&#x27; five-game series loss to Cleveland.

On December 19, 1997, Fielder signed a one-year contract with the Anaheim Angels. He was designated for assignment on August 6, 1998. At the time, he was hitting just .241 with 17 home runs and 68 RBI in 103 games. Fielder was released by the Angels on August 10, and signed with the Cleveland Indians four days later. He was released again on September 18 after batting .143 (5-for-35) with no RBI.

Fielder was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays before the start of the 1999 season. Despite batting .264 (14-for-53) with two doubles, a team-high three homers and 11 RBI in 17 spring training games; Toronto traded for Dave Hollins and Fielder was released once spring training wrapped. He subsequently retired.

In his career, Fielder batted .255, with 744 runs, 200 doubles, 319 home runs, 1,008 RBI, and a .482 slugging average, drawing 693 walks for a .345 on-base percentage with two career stolen bases. As neither of his stolen bases came in the 1990 season, he held the single season record for most home runs (51) without a single stolen base (later passed by Mark McGwire in 1996 and 1999, when he hit 52 and 65 respectively). He was inducted in the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994.

==Personal life==
In October 2004, &quot;The Detroit News&quot; reported that Fielder was suffering from domestic and gambling problems. They relied on court documents from Fielder&#x27;s divorce and a lawsuit brought against him by Trump Plaza Hotel and Casinos in New Jersey describing debts to various casinos, credit card companies and banks. Fielder later filed a libel suit against Gannett, the parent company of &quot;The Detroit News&quot;, and the lead reporter, Fred Girard, accusing them of slander and defamation of character. The suit sought US$25million in damages and fees. The trial court dismissed the suit and the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the decision.

Fielder&#x27;s son Prince was a first baseman who played his career with the Milwaukee Brewers, Detroit Tigers, and Texas Rangers. Fielder was originally involved in his son&#x27;s professional career, even negotiating his first contract. After a dispute as to whether Cecil should receive a typical agent&#x27;s fee for negotiating the contract, Prince and his family were no longer on speaking terms with Cecil. In a 2012 interview, Cecil Fielder said that he and Prince had recently begun speaking again, and that their relationship was improving. On September 25, 2007, Prince hit his 50th home run of the season, making Cecil and Prince the only father/son duo in Major League history to each reach the milestone. The two each have 319 career home runs, and are tied for 126th on the career MLB home run list.

After managing the South Coast League&#x27;s Charlotte County Redfish in 2007, Fielder became the manager of the Atlantic City Surf of the Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball in 2008. On March 25, 2011, Fielder was named to the Torrington Titans advisory board.

On October 17, 2024, Fielder was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>[[Vanuatu]] has been divided into six provinces since 1994. The names in English of all provinces are derived from the initial letters of their constituent islands:

== Municipalities ==

The provinces are in turn divided into municipalities headed by a council and a mayor elected from among the members of the council.

In the Tafea Province for example are the following municipalities (council areas):
*North Erromango
*South Erromango
*North Tanna
*West Tanna
*Middle Bush Tanna
*Whitesands
*South West Tanna
*South Tanna

The islands of Aniwa, Futuna and Aneityum appear to consist of one municipality each.

== Island regions (historical) ==
From 1985 to 1994 it was divided into eleven island regions:

== Districts (historical) ==
During the Condominium era, specifically from 1968 to 1984 the group was divided into four administrative districts:

== Districts (1950) ==
In the 1950s, districts appeared to denote the finest administrative level, finer than the current municipalities or council areas, but above the village level. The island of Tanna was subdivided into 12 such districts, in 1952:
*District Sud (ou de Kwamera)
*District de Green PointDistrict Sud-Ouest
*District de Lenakel
*District Nord-Ouest
*District de Green Hill et de Launalang
*District du Centre Nord
*District du Centre Brousse
*District de Loanvialu
*District de Waesisi
*District de White Sands

<doc id="606337" wikidata="Q7869844" url="?curid=606337" title="USS Greenwich Bay">
<text>USS &quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; (AVP-41), was a United States Navy &quot;Barnegat&quot;-class small seaplane tender in commission from 1945 to 1966.

== Construction and commissioning ==

&quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; was laid down on 18 July 1944 at Lake Washington Shipyard, Houghton, Washington. She was launched on 17 March 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Francis B. Johnson, wife of the Commander of Fleet Air Wing 6 (FAW-6), and commissioned on 20 May 1945.

== Post-World War II occupation duty 1945–1946 ==

&quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; had not yet left the United States West Coast when World War II ended with the cessation of hostilities with Japan on 15 August 1945. Departing San Diego, California, on 26 August 1945, she called at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Midway Atoll, and Okinawa before arriving at Taku, China, on 5 October 1945. &quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; spent the rest of 1945 along the China coast, touching at Tsingtao and Shanghai as well as Taku, tending seaplanes of the United States Seventh Fleet. She operated in Japanese waters during January 1946, and after a short stint in the Philippine Islands, departed for the United States on 1 May 1946. Calling at Hong Kong; Singapore; Naples, Italy; Casablanca, French Morocco; and Gibraltar during the voyage, she arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on 1 July 1946. She then moved to New York City for .

== Escort duty for the Presidential Yacht 1947–1948 ==

&quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; reported to the Potomac River Naval Command on 19 February 1947 to serve as escort to USS &quot;Williamsburg&quot; (AGC-369), ex-PG-56, the Presidential yacht. This assignment ended on 21 June 1948.

== Around-the-world cruise 1948 ==

&quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; departed Norfolk on 21 June 1948 for an around-the-world cruise. During The four-month voyage, she made good-will visits to Gibraltar; Port Said, Egypt; Muscat; Bahrain, Kuwait, Trincomalee, Ceylon; Fremantle, Australia; Pago Pago, American Samoa; Papeete, Tahiti; and Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, before returning to Norfolk on 14 October 1948.

== Middle East service 1949–1966 ==

&quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; departed Norfolk on 30 April 1949 to assume duties as flagship for the Commander of the U.S. Navy Middle East Force. Every year thereafter she repeated this duty, sailing through the Mediterranean to operate as flagship in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and Indian Ocean for 4 to 6 months. In total &quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; made fifteen Mediterranean deployments. During most of this period, she performed these duties in rotation with two other &quot;Barnegat&quot;-class ships, and . These three ships were dubbed the &quot;little white fleet&quot;, in reference to the white paint jobs they shared to counter the region&#x27;s extreme heat.

Ports which &quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; visited as part of her official duties as flagship included Recife, Brazil; Lisbon, Portugal; and virtually every major Mediterranean, Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean, and Red Sea city as well as several African ones. Among them were Malta; Bombay and Madras, India; Istanbul, Turkey; Athens, Greece; Beirut, Lebanon; Mombassa, Kenya; Cannes, France; and Karachi, Pakistan. In addition to operating with foreign naval units in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and Indian Ocean, &quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; performed extensive work in the People-to-People program, particularly in carrying drugs and other medical supplies to Arab and African nations, and operated as an important tool of diplomacy in the region. In her Middle East duties, which were punctuated by local operations and exercises out of Norfolk, &quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; was visited by many dignitaries, including King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, the Shah of Iran, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, and the Shaikh of Kuwait.

In 1950 &quot;Greenwich Bay&quot;″s crew distinguished itself in Bahrain, as Air France planes crashed there on 13 June 1950 and 15 June 1950 while attempting to make early-morning landings on a fog-shrouded airfield. &quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; sent out a total of six search-and-rescue missions on those two days. On 15 June 1950 one of her launches, containing both her captain and medical officer, succeeded in rescuing nine survivors of the crash. For her heroic actions, &quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; received the special commendation and thanks of both the Arabian and French governments.

When the Suez Crisis flared up in 1956, &quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; extended her normal cruise in the Persian Gulf to be able to evacuate American dependents and civilians if necessary. As a result of the blocking of the Suez Canal, she had to return to the United States around the Cape of Good Hope.

== Decommissioning and disposal ==

After completing her fifteenth Middle East deployment, &quot;Greenwich Bay&quot; was decommissioned in June 1966 and stricken from the Navy List on 1 July 1966. She was sold for scrapping on 21 June 1967 to Boston Metals Company of Baltimore, Maryland.

There are two possible etymologies of Antony: the first is that it is named in honour of St Anthony; the second is that it comes from the Anglicisation of the Cornish Tre- (“farmstead”) and -Anta (personal name)

Antony parish is bounded to the north by the tidal River Lynher (also known as the St Germans River) and to the south by the English Channel coast. To the east, the parish is bordered by Torpoint and St John parishes and to the west by Sheviock parish.

The parish is in the St Germans Registration District and had a population of 436 at the 2001 census, increasing to 500 at the 2011 census. Apart from the church town, Antony, the only settlement of any size is Wilcove. Scraesdon Fort and Antony House are also in the parish.

At the time of Domesday Book (1086) the manor of Antony was held by Ermenhald from Tavistock Abbey.

==Parish church==
The medieval parish church, dedicated to St James in 1259, includes structural elements from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. The church houses memorials to members of the Carew family of Antony (18th century) and a large monumental brass to Margery Arundell, 1420.

<doc id="606354" wikidata="Q15407843" url="?curid=606354" title="Prime Minister of South Korea">
<text>The prime minister of the Republic of Korea () is the deputy head of government and the second highest political office of South Korea. The prime minister is appointed by the president of the Republic of Korea, with the National Assembly&#x27;s approval. The prime minister may be a member of the National Assembly, but this is not required to hold the office. 

Unlike prime ministers of parliamentary democracies, the prime minister of South Korea is not the head of government of South Korea, since the president is both the head of state and government in the country. Instead, as the principal executive assistant to the president, the prime minister is more akin to a vice president and is first in the order of succession; the prime minister becomes the acting president, upon the removal or incapacitation of the sitting president, similar to the vice president of the United States. 

The current prime minister is Han Duck-soo, having taken office on 20 May 2022. After his impeachment on 27 December 2024, deputy prime minister and Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok assumed the role of acting prime minister.

==Nomenclature==
The Sino-Korean word &quot;gugmu&quot; (/) means &quot;state affairs&quot; and &quot;chongni&quot; (/) means &quot;prime minister&quot;, &quot;premier&quot; or &quot;chancellor&quot;, so the full title in Korean means literally &quot;Prime Minister for State Affairs&quot;, but it is not used as official English title. The short title in Korean is simply &quot;Chongni&quot;.

==History==
The position was created on 31 July 1948, two weeks before the government of South Korea was founded, and was held by Lee Beom-seok until 1950. During the Second Republic a parliamentary system was established and the prime minister became the most powerful position, with the president reduced to a figurehead. Chang Myon was the only prime minister of the second republic until the military coup of 1961. The title was Chief Cabinet Minister from 1961 until 1963.

On 27 April 2014, Prime Minister Chung Hong-won announced his desire to resign. However, due to unsuccessful nominations, Chung remained in office until February 2015.

On 23 January 2015, President Park Geun-hye named Saenuri&#x27;s Floor Leader Lee Wan-koo as the new prime minister. Lee was confirmed by the National Assembly as Prime Minister on 16 February 2015. However, on April 20 of the same year, he offered his resignation to the president in the midst of a bribery scandal.

==Functions==
The prime minister is the principal executive assistant to the president, with the president being the actual head of government. The prime minister holds the second position after the president in the State Council of South Korea, which is the nominal cabinet of South Korea. The prime minister assists the president by supervising ministries, making recommendations for ministers, and serves as the vice-chairperson of the Cabinet. The prime minister is the first in the order of succession to discharge the duties of the office of the president as the acting president should the president be unable to discharge their office. The most recent prime minister to have served as Acting President is Han Duck-soo, during the suspension of Yoon Suk Yeol due to his impeachment on 14 December 2024. The role of the prime minister is more akin to the Vice President of the United States than it is to the prime ministers of parliamentary democracies. 

A prime minister that has been appointed by the president but not yet confirmed by the National Assembly is informally called as the acting prime minister. The term may also be applied to a prime minister that has resigned but in the interim remains in office in a caretaker role.

The prime minister is supported by two deputy prime ministers, one of whom acts for the prime minister in the event of an impeachment. The prime minister of South Korea sometimes holds some professional or technological knowledge whereas the president is always a sole politician.

==Removal==

The procedure for impeachment is set out in the 10th Constitution of South Korea in 1987. And according to Article 65 Clause 1, if the president, prime minister, or other state council members violate the Constitution or other laws of official duty, the National Assembly can impeach them.

Clause 2 states the impeachment bill must be proposed by one third, and approved by a majority of members of the National Assembly for passage. This article also states that any person against whom a motion for impeachment has been passed shall be suspended from exercising their power until the impeachment has been adjudicated by the Constitutional Court of Korea, and a decision on impeachment shall not extend further than removal from public office. However, impeachment shall not exempt the person impeached from civil or criminal liability for such violations.

By the Constitutional Court Act of 1988, the Constitutional Court must make a final decision within 180 days after it receives any case for adjudication, including impeachment cases. If the respondent has already left office before the pronouncement of the decision, the case is dismissed.

==Prime Minister&#x27;s Office==

The Prime Minister&#x27;s Office consists of two organisations – the Office for Government Policy Coordination and the Prime Minister&#x27;s Secretariat which are led by ministerial-level minister for government policy coordination and vice-ministerial-level chief of staff to the prime minister respectively.

Office for Government Policy Coordination assists the prime minister with:
* various tasks, responsible for directing, adjusting and overseeing central administrative authorities underneath the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office;
* planning and adjusting key national policies;
* managing, analyzing and assessing policies in regard to social risks, conflicts and pending problems;
* implementing regulatory reform;
* and doing other tasks specifically delegated by the prime minister.

Prime Minister&#x27;s Secretariat assists the prime minister with: 
* activities related to the National Assembly, responsible for matters regarding collaboration between the executive branch and the majority party in the legislature;
* providing PM with counsel on state affairs;
* matters regarding key information and situations both domestic and international;
* management and arbitration of civil complaints;
* supporting and collaborating with civil groups;
* promoting PM&#x27;s activities in relation to state affairs;
* drafting PM&#x27;s remarks and statements;
* supporting the promotion of activities by the Office for Government Policy Coordination;
* protocols and armed escort regarding PM and receiving VIPs;
* maintaining the official residence of PM;
* and handling other matters as instructed by PM.

==Salary==
The prime minister has a salary of $163,000 as set by the National Assembly along with a lifelong pension that is always given to former prime ministers.

==Residence==
The prime minister&#x27;s residence is Chongni Gonggwan. It is owned and operated by the South Korean government, and has served as the residence of the prime minister since the early 1990s after construction was concluded and was completed around the same time as the Presidential Blue House.

==Post-premiership==
All former prime ministers are given a lifelong pension and a Presidential Security Service detail but do not have to accept the protection if they so wish. Prime ministers when they die usually have a state funeral so the public and government officials both past and present can pay their respects.

<doc id="606363" wikidata="Q2380860" url="?curid=606363" title="Camuy, Puerto Rico">
<text>Camuy () is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, north of Lares and San Sebastián; east of Quebradillas; and west of Hatillo. Camuy is spread over 12 barrios and Camuy Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). The town celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2007.

Camuy is part of the &quot;Porta Atlántico&quot; Tourist Area.

==History==
Camuy, popularly known as Romantic City (&quot;la ciudad romántica&quot;), was founded in 1807 by Petronila Matos, and formerly part of Arecibo is located in the northwestern coastal region of Puerto Rico, less than 5 minutes west of Hatillo municipality, on PR-2 and PR-119. As early as 1846, , a bridge over the Camuy River linked Camuy with Hatillo. The name &quot;Camuy&quot; derives from the Taíno language, although a number of legends give differing explanations for the origin of the name. One such legend claims the name comes from the Taíno word for &quot;sun&quot;, another claims derivation from &quot;camuy&quot;, Taíno for &quot;beautiful scenery&quot;, and still another states that &quot;Camuy&quot; was the name of the Taíno chief &quot;Yumac&quot; with the letters in reverse order. The &quot;sun&quot; legend is reflected in the coat of arms for the municipality.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Camuy was 10,887.

In its beginnings Camuy was integrated into the Partition of San Antonio de la Tuna. The &quot;partitions&quot; were great expanses of land that divided Puerto Rico. This region today is known as Isabela, Puerto Rico. At the time the partition covered the areas between Aguadilla and Arecibo, what is known today as the municipalities of Camuy, Hatillo, Quebradillas, Isabela, Utuado, and San Sebastián.

The population of Camuy was 35,159 at the 2010 census, and it has land area of . The municipality is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo metropolitan area and is a popular suburb. It was named in 2015 by the U.S. Conference of Mayors as one of the most livable cities in the United States.

Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Camuy with the significant amount of rainfall. Electricity was restored to the town center on October 4. However, rural areas remained without electricity until March 2018. There were catastrophic damages in Camuy with around 2000 residences damaged or completely destroyed. The hospital&#x27;s roof was torn off. The 40 animal husbandry businesses in Camuy, agriculture, and tourism industries suffered heavy losses. One of the main tourist attractions in Puerto Rico located in Camuy, Parque Nacional de las Cavernas del Río Camuy was destroyed, and would remain closed for four years.

==Geography==

Camuy belongs to the zone designated as the plateau of the northwest where the terrain is level and known as the Valley of Quebradillas. It is located in the Northern Karst zone of Puerto Rico. In the interior of the municipality the topography becomes very irregular near Cibao. This strip of land, a zone of wooded hills and depressions, divides Camuy completely into two strips, north and south. The northern strip is known as Lomas de los Puertos.

The Camuy River forms part of the hydrographic system with a length of 24 miles, which at one point becomes a narrow canyon that forms one of the most beautiful cave systems in the world: the Rio Camuy Caverns, first explored in 1958. The Camuy River along with the Caverns are the 3rd largest and longest underground system in the world and the river is one of the few remaining active underground rivers in the Americas, stretching for miles. The Cibao River also forms part of the system.

===Barrios===
Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Camuy is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as , near the center of the municipality.

The park built around the cave system features tours of some of the caves, and is one of the most popular natural attractions in Puerto Rico. The caverns were created by the &quot;Río Camuy&quot; (Camuy River), the third longest underground river in the world. In recognition of this, the Camuy coat of arms includes a symbol for the underground river.
