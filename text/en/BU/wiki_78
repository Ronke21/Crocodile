<text>The Crystal Maze is a British game show devised by Jacques Antoine, based upon his format for the French game show &quot;Fort Boyard&quot;, and produced for Channel 4. The programme focuses on teams of contestants, a mixed group of men and women, attempting a range of challenges to earn time required to help them complete one final challenge, which if completed successfully earns them a prize. The premise of the show is themed around challenges set to different periods of human history within a fictional labyrinth of time and space (the titular &quot;Crystal Maze&quot;), and is notable for the use of golf ball-sized Swarovski glass crystals (referred to as &quot;time crystals&quot;) as a reward for each challenge successfully completed by contestants, and lock-in conditions for contestants that ran out of time or broke a three-strikes rule on a challenge.

&quot;The Crystal Maze&quot; originally consisted of six series, including five Christmas specials involving teams of children, which aired between 15 February 1990 to 10 August 1995. The first four series and three specials were hosted by Richard O&#x27;Brien, with the remaining two series and specials hosted by Edward Tudor-Pole. In October 2016, Channel 4 created a one-off celebrity edition for &quot;Stand Up to Cancer&quot;, hosted by Stephen Merchant. In 2017, the broadcaster began airing new episodes of the game, after reviving it following the 2016 special, revamping its format and creating several standard episodes along additional celebrity specials, and appointing Richard Ayoade as host. This run was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic after three series with the final episodes airing in 2020.

A 10-episode American version of the show, filmed on the same set as the UK version, aired on Nickelodeon in 2020.

In March 2016, The Crystal Maze Live Experience opened, allowing the public to buy tickets and compete in a replica of the game show&#x27;s zones and challenges.

==Creation==
&quot;The Crystal Maze&quot;″s origins can be traced to an attempt to create an edition of &quot;Fort Boyard&quot; for British Television, commissioned by Channel 4 in 1989 from Chatsworth Television. Complications in creating a pilot arose due to the fortress used by the TV game show, situated off the west coast of France, being unavailable for filming due to its ongoing refurbishments that year. As a result, the pilot was filmed in London at Elstree Studios, using a basic replica set funded by Channel 4, but the result was deemed unsuccessful and not broadcast, due to the considerable changes required to the French-owned format in order for it to suit a UK audience.

In order to create a more successful format for Channel 4, who had commissioned a full series, Chatsworth Television producer Malcolm Heyworth contacted &quot;Fort Boyard&#x27;s&quot; creator Jacques Antoine – who attended the pilot&#x27;s creation, and who had created the company&#x27;s other productions: &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot;, and &quot;Interceptor&quot; – and proposed creating an alternative format which conducted challenges within themed zones. Antoine eventually provided a rough sketch to the producers when taking them to Paris to view a full-size Crystal Dome created by the French, revealing it would be the centrepiece and surrounded by four other sets. The sketch was used as inspiration for the concept of &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot;, which was developed in just &quot;two days&quot;, creating a show which although was similar to &quot;Fort Boyard&quot;, had substantial differences in presentation and style, creating a show akin to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, with the host acting as the Dungeon Master.

==Format==

Each team that compete on &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot; undertake a series of challenges (referred to as games). Teams begin at a pre-determined zone, whereupon they compete in a finite number of games in each zone, accruing as many time crystals as they can before travelling to the large &quot;Crystal Dome&quot; at the centre of the maze to meet their final challenge. Upon entering a game&#x27;s cell, the objective is usually determined by either a clear written message or cryptic clue. The remainder of the team watch their progress either through a cell&#x27;s windows or monitors depending on the zone aesthetic, and may give advice to the contestant unless stipulated otherwise. The host will serve reminders of the time limit and of any special rules, and generally will not give hints unless the contestant is struggling badly.

Each game falls under one of four categories:

Each game presents the potential of being locked within a game&#x27;s cell. If locked in, the contestant is unable to take any further part in proceedings and will be eliminated. If the team&#x27;s captain is locked in, the vice-captain takes over and may select a new vice-captain to replace them and so on. Reduction in team members poses an increased difficulty for future games and at their final challenge, so some teams may leave contestants behind if that secures more time in the Dome.

There are two ways a lock-in can occur in &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot;: if a contestant exceeds their time limit within the cell, or an &quot;automatic lock-in&quot; where they breach a game&#x27;s special rules or restrictions, irrespective of their progress in obtaining the crystal. This is outlined prior to a contestant entering the cell by the Maze Master.

Once the team arrives at the Crystal Dome, they are told how much time that they have to complete the final challenge, based on the number of crystals they have brought with them (five seconds for each crystal they had at the end of the game). At this point, the team enter the Dome, and upon the challenge beginning, they must collect as many gold foil tokens as they can and deposit them into a container along a wall of the Dome, while avoiding any silver tokens mixed in with them; these are blown about by fans beneath the floor of the Dome. Once time is up, the fans are switched off and no more tokens can be deposited into the container; a slot is opened during the challenge, which closes up when the time is up. Once the team is outside the dome, they, along with any members who were not present for the final challenge, are given the tally of their efforts by the host. If the team accumulate a total of 100 gold tokens or more, after deduction of any silver tokens, the team wins the grand prize that they chose for themselves before partaking in the show. All contestants who participate in the show win a commemorative crystal saying &quot;I Cracked the Crystal Maze&quot;, which acts as a consolation prize if a team fails to secure the required number of gold tokens.

=== Original series ===
During the run of the original series between 1990 and 1995, teams consisted of three men and three women, each aged between 16 and 40, who were put together by the production team and did not know each other before appearing on the show From their pre-determined starting zone, teams either travelled clockwise or counter-clockwise around the maze, engaging in at least three games in each zone, sometimes being given the opportunity to play a fourth game in a zone during their trip around the maze. Between the first and fourth series, the total number of games that could be played varied between 14 and 16 per episode, but for the fifth and sixth series, the number of games played was reduced to a standard of 13. Throughout the run, 3D maps of varying sophistication were used to highlight where the host and team were. Until the end of the third series, each contestant on the team could win a prize for themselves that they chose at a later date (a selection of the available prizes would be read out as if that was theirs but the allocation was sometimes in-jokes based on things that happened during the recording), if the team succeeded at collecting 100 or more gold tokens, but from the fourth series, this format was changed to the team choosing a prize that they shared together if they won the final challenge. During the first series, a runner-up prize could also be chosen by each member of a team, which they won if the final tally of tokens was between 50 and 99, but this format was dropped by the start of the second series.

During the Christmas specials, the teams consisted of similar setup, with each aged between 10 and 15, and selected by the production team. While the format was similar to the adult version, there were notable differences, such as easier games with fewer chances of a lock-in, more lenient time limits and additional clues from the host. The prize would always be awarded at the end, irrespective of achievement.

=== Revived series ===
Following the one-off &quot;Stand Up to Cancer&quot; edition, Channel 4 revived the show featuring the original setup of zones, the same map design from the &quot;SU2C&quot; special, and a newly designed taller set. The format of the show was revamped to have five contestants who have a prior connection (family, colleagues, etc.) and a reduction in games to ten. Additionally, the team no longer selected the category of game they wanted to play: instead, this was determined for them by the Maze Master.

In a similar vein to the 2016 &quot;SU2C&quot; special, a series of celebrity episodes was initially broadcast. The contestants taking part were given an extra crystal upon reaching the Dome (or by completing an additional task during the show) to add to those that they had brought, and would earn cash for &quot;Stand Up to Cancer&quot; depending on how many gold tokens they got, after deduction of silver. Contestants earn £5,000 for less than 50 gold tokens, £10,000 for 50 to 99 tokens, and £20,000 for 100 or more tokens.

The 2019 series introduces the &quot;Mega Crystal&quot;, a noticeably larger version of the Crystals within the Maze. The team has one opportunity to earn the Mega Crystal, and the team captain decides before each game whether they want that game to be played for the Mega Crystal. If the team earns the Mega Crystal, it grants them ten seconds of time (instead of the standard five) in the Crystal Dome.

== Hosts ==
Throughout its history, &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot; has been presented by a series of hosts known as Maze Masters. Each takes on the role of the Maze&#x27;s custodian responsible for guiding each team around the various zones, keeping them updated on their progress, leading each nominated team member to the respective games, acting as the timekeeper on all games and the final challenge at the Dome, and taking safe custody of each crystal won by the team.

The short monologue to camera scenes originated when O&#x27;Brien began joking with the cameramen during filming of an episode. When the production team reviewed the footage and realized what it could bring to the show they &quot;asked him to do it all the time&quot;; O&#x27;Brien felt that looking straight at the camera &quot;unknowingly added a complicity between me and the audience at home&quot;. However, he also &quot;often appeared detached from proceedings, bordering on deadpan&quot;. Each successive host has continued these monologues, adding their own variant to the show.

=== Other characters ===
Whilst the Maze is home to the Maze Master, several original characters have appeared whether as part of a particular game such as a jailor, guard and tribal priest, or are otherwise fictionalized within a respective zone. None of the characters appear in the American version. Notable characters include:

* Mumsie and Auntie Sabrina Portrayed by Sandra Caron, Mumsie is a genial fortune teller during O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s tenure, hosting a recurring mental game in the Medieval Zone that involved brain teaser questions; Caron portrayed Mumsie for the first, second and fourth series of the original run, and Auntie Sabrina for the third series, who was described by O&#x27;Brien as taking over while his Mumsie was away. Both characters were portrayed as friendly to the contestants, with Mumsie sometimes being overly motherly with O&#x27;Brien, and often talked about her affair she was having with a man called &quot;Ralph&quot; to both the contestants and audience during the first and second series, showing disapproval of her next affair with man called &quot;Dwayne&quot; during the fourth series. Mumsie departed with O&#x27;Brien at the start of the fifth series. In The Crystal Maze Live Experience, Mumsie is an unseen character which the Maze Master communicates with through an earpiece.
* The Computer An operating system for the Futuristic Zone is situated within; if the team&#x27;s starting point is this zone, the computer provides a question for the team that they must answer correctly to gain entry into the Maze. During O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s tenure (with the exception of series 2), the computer had a male voice and usually acted antagonistically towards him. During Tudor-Pole&#x27;s tenure, the computer adopted a female voice and was named Barbara. In Ayoade&#x27;s tenure, the computer retains a female voice but no other personality traits are shown, only speaking when a team seeks entry to the maze.
* The Riddle Master Portrayed by Adam Buxton, the Riddle Master, credited as Jarhead, is a head that resides in a glass jar who creates Crystals by mixing potions using telekinesis when a contestant completes his game. Though residing in a jar in the Futuristic and Medieval zones, his jar is replaced with a bird cage in the Eastern zone. He has a friendly, though seemingly subservient, relationship to Ayoade.
* Knight Marion Portrayed by Jessica Hynes, Marion is a King&#x27;s Knight and guard of the Medieval Zone who wears oversized battle armour, carries a large sword, and grants entry. She was known to ask Ayoade to attend events with her, which he rebuffed. When Medieval was replaced with Eastern, she did not return.

==Filming==
Each episode had a budget of £125,000 and was filmed over a period of two days at the show&#x27;s studio. During the first day of shooting, the team, followed by multiple cameras, tackle all the games and discover their fate in the crystal dome in the style of a &quot;live&quot; shoot. The close up of contestants, leaping and grabbing tokens was usually recorded while the actual collection was being counted, actual collection of tokens was normally done on hands and knees as the token settled round the sides of the dome. The following day then focuses on acquiring close-up shots of gameplay with a single camera, requiring team members to return to games they had already won or lost (second day shots can be identified by the lack of mikes on contestants). An entire series requires about five weeks to be filmed, with three episodes produced per week. Each series of the show featured its own portfolio of games: 37 different game designs in series 1, and between 41 and 49 games in each subsequent series.

===The set===
Every episode, with the exception of the 2016 special, is filmed on a very large custom built set. The set, designed by James Dillon for both the original run and the revived series, is divided into five parts, four of which are named as zones, set in different periods of time and space, which house the games that contestants take on, while the final part, called the Crystal Dome, houses the final challenge that the team tackle together towards the end of the episode. The theme of each zone is not only reflected via its time period, but also in the time-keeping devices, the design of the games, and how the host and team entered and moves between the zones. As of 2019, six zones have been used within the Maze.

=== Zones ===
===Location===
For the first series, the show was filmed at Shepperton Studios, within a stage set measuring and containing a water tank on-site. After the first series, the production team decided to expand the maze, relocating the set to an adapted aircraft hangar, Hangar 6, operated by Aces High Studios at North Weald Airfield in Essex. After the show ended in 1995, when Channel 4&#x27;s contract with producers Chatsworth TV expired, the set was eventually dismantled. When the broadcaster decided to make a one-off edition of the show for &quot;Stand Up for Cancer&quot; in 2016, the episode was filmed at The Crystal Maze live immersive experience in London, as it was no longer possible to use the original set. When Channel 4 made the decision to revive the show for a full series in November 2016, James Dillon was asked to design a new set at a warehouse at The Bottle Yard Studios in Bristol. Dillon went back to his original plans and sketches but took the opportunity to build and expand on several of his original ideas and concepts. The most drastic change is that the Crystal Dome is actually located in a separate part of the studio; originally its proximity to the Aztec zone caused a problem with sand contaminating the Dome area.

===Theme tune===
The theme tune for &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot; was composed by Zack Laurence and is entitled &quot;Force Field&quot;. It was used through all six original series, with an updated version being used for the new series. The original track is one minute and five seconds long; however it was shortened for the opening and ending titles. Likewise, the new re-recorded version of the theme lasts for 33 seconds. The &quot;Underscore&quot; remix of the theme tune played during the show itself was also composed by Laurence.

==Reception==
At its height, viewing figures regularly scored over 4 million, peaking at 5.9 million in 1992 when the show was nominated for its first BAFTA award. Three other BAFTA nominations followed in subsequent years with a Royal Television Society award nomination in 1995. 
Although not originally envisioned as a children&#x27;s show over 40% of the shows viewers were under 16, a surprise to the crew and O&#x27;Brien, who adapted his performance accordingly, forcing himself to think more like a child.
Contemporary commentary has often suggested that this aspect of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s performance was the show&#x27;s biggest attraction. Praising his zany style and describing him as &quot;a fearless adventurer with a wink and a smile and a verbal knife in the back of those poor saps [contestants] ... His style and wit was sardonic, yet never exclusionary, and pointed, yet never bitter&quot;. In 2012 &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s TV &amp; Radio Blog listed O&#x27;Brien as one of the six &quot;most loved&quot; game show hosts, describing him as &quot;an unconventional choice for an unconventional series ... [who] looked more like a dandy gazelle than a game show host&quot;. The same commentary has also suggested Tudor-Pole had an almost impossible task in living up to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s popularity. &quot;The Guardian&quot; claimed &quot;It was no surprise that the show went downhill after [O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s] exit.&quot;

The show has had a lasting impact and influence on British television, becoming what has been described as a cult classic due to repeats; the makers of the children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Jungle Run&quot; openly acknowledge &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot; as an influence, particularly the final host, Michael Underwood, who was the team captain in the first Christmas special; The perceived stupidity of the contestants was the target of various British comedy shows and spoofs, a trend which continued well into the mid 2000s.

==Merchandise==

===Home Entertainment===
A single-player computer game based on &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot; was developed by Digital Jellyfish Design and released in 1993. A game for mobiles was released in 2008, and later for iOS in 2010.

In 1991, MB Games released a board game loosely based upon the show. The concept of the game differed significantly from the show with players competing &quot;against&quot; each other as opposed to the co-operative style of the TV show.

For the revived series, Rascals Products Limited produced a new board game. The game itself features sixteen challenges which can be played either individually or as a team, with an optional timer to use on smartphones and tablets. In 2019 an expansion for the Eastern zone was released which can replace any existing zone on the main board and comes with four new games.

===The Crystal Maze Live Experience===
In June 2015, the interactive theatre production company Little Lion Entertainment announced that a &quot;live immersive experience&quot; of &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot; would be taking place in late 2015, funded successfully through an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign. Located in central London, the Live Experience admits members of the public, who can buy tickets and play the show for themselves. In the Live Experience, Richard O&#x27;Brien is shown leaving the Maze to &quot;the new custodian&quot; who guides the team. In the London experience, four teams enter the maze at separate locations, and rotate around the four zones simultaneously before competing against each other in The Crystal Dome. In the Manchester experience, the zones are split in two parts, and the teams move through the maze one after the other, such that each half-zone always has one team in it. Like the London Maze, teams compete for the high score in the Crystal Dome, by collecting as many gold tokens as possible, but unlike in London, the teams never meet or compete against one another. The group secured a venue for the Maze in the King&#x27;s Cross area in late 2015, and it opened for contestants on 15 March 2016. In November 2016 another live experience in Manchester at the Granada Studios opened to the public in April 2017.

===The Cyberdrome Crystal Maze===
The Cyberdrome Crystal Maze was an attraction usually found in bowling alleys and video arcades in the UK. It allowed entrants an opportunity to play the Crystal Maze in a computerised format. As this feature lacked a host, rules regarding lock ins were changed. The locations of the Cyberdromes were Blackpool, Pembrokeshire, Southampton, Coventry, and Maidenhead with additional locations in Japan and Dubai. Only the Dubai location is still open, the Pembrokeshire location having closed in 2010.

===Quiz machines===
Chatsworth Television licensed a number of popular SWP gambling machines based on the TV series. In 2009, Cool Games created a 3D video version for the UK SWP market. Remaining true to the original show, using touch screen technology, the game achieved widespread coverage in the UK and remains one of the most popular SWP games launched.

===Literature===

===VHS releases===
In 1994, a video cassette, &quot;The Best of The Crystal Maze&quot; was released by Wienerworld Presentation. The video included three episodes: the 1992 and 1993 Christmas specials, and an episode from Series 4. It also featured the clip of O&#x27;Brien and Mumsey leaving the maze.

==Transmissions==
===Original===

===Revival===


==International versions==
=== United States ===
On June 3, 2019, it was announced that an American version of the show would premiere on Nickelodeon and feature family members competing for $25,000. The ten-episode season was filmed in the same location as the British edition. In December 2019, it was announced that comedian Adam Conover would be the Maze Master for this version. It debuted on the North American version of the channel with a commercial-free premiere which aired on 24 January 2020 and was later broadcast in the UK from 4 September 2020.

In the American adaptation, each team played a total of eight games in the maze (two per zone). The Mega Crystal introduced in 2019 in the original series was available in any game after the first. If a team finished the Crystal Dome with a positive total of gold tokens, they won $100 per gold after deductions for silver tokens, and the full $25,000 for a net result of 100 gold tokens or more.

<text>A material consideration, in the United Kingdom, is a factor relevant to the development and use of land which the decision-maker should consider when assessing and deciding the outcome of a planning application.

Material considerations include issues such as traffic, wildlife, economic impacts, and the character, landscape and/or historical interest of the area. In considering an application for development, decision-makers often consult local development plans and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) to determine the success of a proposal.

Issues such as loss of a view, or an effect on property or business values, are not material considerations.

The Campaign to Protect Rural England advises that Material Considerations are factors that will be taken into account when a decision on a planning application or appeal is reached. Under Section 38 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, decisions on planning applications &#x27;must be made in accordance with the [development] plan unless other material considerations indicate otherwise&#x27;.

The courts ultimately decide what a material consideration is. However, case law gives local planning authorities a great deal of leeway to decide what considerations are relevant and how much weight should be given to them, each time they make a decision on a planning application. Any consideration that relates to the use or development of land is capable of being a material consideration, but other circumstances such as personal hardship and fears of affected residents can be considered in exceptional cases (the House of Lords in Great Portland Estates v. Westminster City Council [1985]).

In practice, government planning policy is often the most important material consideration other than the development plan. Government policy may also override the development plan if it has been both consulted on and published more recently.

<text>Kirkmuirhill is a village in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It borders Blackwood, near Lanark and is sited near Junction 9 of the M74 motorway.

==History==
In 1810 John Begg, husband of Robert Burns&#x27; youngest sister Isabella, became the land steward for Mr James Hope Vere MP on his estate at Blackwood. On 24 April 1813, after nearly three years at Blackwood, John met his death when his horse reared and fell on him, crushing him to death. He was returning from his regular trip to Lesmahagow market on a horse that he had been asked to ride because it had become fractious due to lack of exercise. Isabella was left a widow with nine children with ages from three to eighteen. For a while Mr James Hope Vere paid her a small annual grant however to make ends meet she opened a dame&#x27;s school in Kirkmuirhill which she ran for four years before moving to Ormiston.

== Amenities ==

=== Churches ===
There are a number of Christian congregations within the village. These include Kirkmuirhill Parish Church of Scotland; Hope Church: Blackwood &amp; Kirkmuirhill Free Church of Scotland, Our Lady &amp; St John&#x27;s Catholic Church and Kirkmuirhill Gospel Hall.

<text>Blackwood is a village which borders Kirkmuirhill, near Lanark in the central belt of Scotland. It has a few small shops, a Roman Catholic church and a couple of primary schools.

== Location ==
Blackwood sits adjacent to the M74 motorway - Scotland&#x27;s main arterial route South to England - but remains a quiet village and a much sought-after place to stay. Blackwood is linked to (and physically runs into) the neighbouring village of Kirkmuirhill, so-much-so that there is no physical sign of where one starts and the other ends, although many argue that the line is drawn just parallel to the row of shops.

== Local life ==
=== Churches ===
Kirkmuirhill Church of Scotland (technically in neighbouring Kirkmuirhill), Hope Church Blackwood &amp; Kirkmuirhill (Free Church of Scotland), St. John&#x27;s R.C. Church and Kirkmuirhill Gospel Hall look after the spiritual needs of villagers.

=== Schools ===
There are two primary schools, St. John&#x27;s R.C. Primary School and Blackwood Primary School. However there is a third school, Bent Primary, on the outskirts of the villages.

== History of Blackwood Estate ==
Blackwood sits at the top of the gentle hills on the Western/Southern side of the picturesque Clyde Valley, at the point where the River Nethan sweeps down into the steep valley to join the River Clyde. Close by is Craignethan Castle, where Mary Queen of Scots stayed on her journey South to be tried and executed by Elizabeth I of England.

Sited on the main route South from Glasgow to Carlisle, both Kirkmuirhill and Blackwood benefited from the traffic passing through although by far the largest employer in this largely rural area in the 18th and early 19th centuries would have been the Blackwood Estate. Blackwood was (arguably) originally the farming cousin to other local villages, where coal mining was the dominant industry. Blackwood estate provided farming work for local families. The Blackwood Estate, seat of the Weir de Veres since the thirteenth century, afterwards the Hope-Veres, was the most extensive estate in the parish of Lesmahagow and by some accounts the largest estate in the County of Lanark.

===Isabella Burns===
Gilbert Burns, brother of the poet had been the land steward at Blackwood before moving to Morham Mains in East Lothian. In 1810 John Begg, husband of Robert Burns youngest sister Isabella Burns, became the land steward for Mr James Hope Vere MP on his estate at Blackwood. On 24 April 1813, after nearly three years at Blackwood, John met his death when his horse reared and fell on him, crushing him to death. He was returning from his regular trip to Lesmahagow market on a horse that he had been asked to ride because it had become fractious due to lack of exercise. Isabella was left a widow with nine children with ages from three to eighteen. For a while Mr James Hope Vere paid her a small annual grant however to make ends meet she opened a dame&#x27;s school in Kirkmuirhill which she ran for four years before moving to Ormiston.

== Railway station ==
The arrival of the railways into the area in 1856 with the opening of the station at Blackwood, resulted in an expansion of mining but the deep pits in the immediate vicinity seem to have had a short lifespan and were worked out fairly rapidly. Surface mining lasted a little longer but by the mid-20th century, mining was no longer a major employment option in the region.

== Blackwood today ==
Despite this the two villages of Blackwood and Kirkmuirhill seem to have proved pleasant places to live and both enjoyed a major building boom during the 20th century. In 1901 Blackwood had 167 houses and Kirmuirhill 121. By the year 2000 they had a combined total of 1480 and the villages had merged such that it is hard to tell where one ends and the other begins.

More recently, a holy grail novel has been inspired by the village of Blackwood. Based on a true story which follows the descendants of the holy bloodline from France in 1066 to South Lanarkshire, where the grail treasure is believed to be buried.

<doc id="604545" wikidata="Q3357234" url="?curid=604545" title="Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (Onze Jan)">
<text>Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (4 July 1845 – 11 October 1909) was a politician in the Cape Colony. He was affectionately known as &quot;Onze Jan&quot;, &quot;our Jan&quot; in Dutch.

== Life ==

He was born in Cape Town, educated at the South African College, and at an early age turned his attention to politics, first as a journalist.

He was editor of &quot;de Zuid-Afrikaan&quot; until its incorporation with &quot;Ons Land&quot;, and of the &quot;Zuid Afrikaansche Tijdschrift&quot;.
By birth, education and sympathies a typical Dutch Afrikaner, he set himself to organize the political power of his fellow-countrymen. This he did very effectively, and when in 1879 he entered the Cape parliament as member for Stellenbosch, he became the real leader of the Dutch party.
Yet he only held office for six months – as minister without portfolio in the Scanlen ministry from May to November 1881.
He held no subsequent official post in the colony, though he shared with Sir Thomas Upington and Sir Charles Mills the honor of representing the Cape at the intercolonial conference of 1887.
Here he supported the proposal for entrusting the defence of Simon&#x27;s Town to Cape Colony, leaving only the armament to be provided by the imperial government, opposed trans-oceanic penny postage and moved a resolution in favor of an imperial customs union.
At the Colonial Conference of 1894 at Ottawa he was again one of the Cape representatives.
In 1888 and in 1889, he was a member of the South African customs conference.

His chief importance as a public man was, however, derived from his power over the Dutch in Cape Colony, and his control of the Afrikaner Bond. But it remained an organization for obtaining the political supremacy of the Cape Dutch. His control over the Bond enabled him for many years, while free from the responsibilities of office, to make and unmake ministers at his will, and earned for him the name of Cabinet-maker of South Africa. His preference for working behind the scenes and avoiding overt political stands earned him another nickname, &quot;the Mole&quot; (described by John X Merriman as &quot;an industrious little animal . . . You never see him at work, but every now and then a little mound of earth, thrown up here or there, will testify to his activities.&quot;)

Although officially the term &quot;Afrikander&quot; was explained by Hofmeyr to include white men of whatever race, yet in practice the influence of the Bond was always exerted in favor of the Dutch, and its power was drawn from the Dutch districts of Cape Colony.
The sympathies of the Bond were thus always strongly with the Transvaal, as the chief centre of Dutch influence in South Africa; and Hofmeyr&#x27;s position might in many respects be compared with that of Parnell at the head of the Irish Nationalist party in Great Britain. In the Bechuanaland difficulty of 1884 Hofmeyr threw all the influence of the Bond into the scale in favor of the Transvaal.
But in the course of the next few years he began to drift away from President Kruger.
He resented the reckless disregard of Cape interests involved in Kruger&#x27;s fiscal policy; he feared that the Transvaal, after its sudden leap into prosperity upon the gold discoveries of 1886, might overshadow all other Dutch influences in South Africa; above all he was convinced, as he showed by his action at the London conference, that the protection of the British navy was indispensable to South Africa, and he set his face against Kruger&#x27;s intrigues with Germany, and his avowed intention of acquiring an outlet to the sea in order to get into touch with foreign powers.
In 1890, Hofmeyr joined forces with Cecil Rhodes, who became premier of Cape Colony with the support of the Bond. Hofmeyr&#x27;s influence was a powerful factor in the conclusion of the Swaziland convention of 1890, as well as in stopping the trek to Banyailand (Rhodesia) in 1891, a notable reversal of the policy he had pursued seven years before. But the reactionary elements in the Bond grew alarmed at Rhodes&#x27;s imperialism, and in 1895 Hofmeyr resigned his seat in parliament and the presidency of the Bond.
Then came the Jameson Raid, and in its wake there rolled over South Africa a wave of Dutch and anti-British feeling such as had not been known since the days of Majuba. (The proclamation issued by Sir Hercules Robinson disavowing Jameson was suggested by Hofmeyr, who helped to draw up its terms.) Once more Hofmeyr became president of the Bond.
By an alteration of the provincial constitution, all power in the Cape branch of the Bond was vested in the hands of a vigilance committee of three, of whom Hofmeyr and his brother were two.
As the recognized leader of the Cape Dutch, he protested against such abuses as the dynamite monopoly in the Transvaal, and urged Kruger even at the eleventh hour to grant reasonable concessions rather than plunge into a war that might involve Cape Afrikanderdom and the Transvaal in a common ruin.
In July 1899, he journeyed to Pretoria, and vainly supported the proposal of a satisfactory franchise law, combined with a limited representation of the &quot;Uitlanders&quot; in the Volksraad, and in September urged the Transvaal to accede to the proposed joint inquiry.

He died in London on 11 October 1909.

== Family ==

Hofmeyr married Aleda Hendrikz in 1880; she died 1883. He married her sister, Johanna Hendrikz on 1 September 1900.

<doc id="604547" wikidata="Q6972390" url="?curid=604547" title="National Educational Debate Association">
<text>The National Educational Debate Association (NEDA) is an American collegiate debate association emphasizing audience-centered debate. It was founded by debate educators who believe that the debate tournament is an extension of the communication classroom and that even competitive debates should provide students with skills of research, argument selection, and presentation style that will benefit them as public advocates. NEDA schedules eight invitational tournaments a year, primarily in the mid-west. The association debates two resolutions per year. The fall resolution is one of value, and the spring resolution is one of policy. 

Several aspects of NEDA make it distinct from other debate organizations, including the ability to decide topicality at the end of the constructive speeches, the ability of judges to give &quot;double losses&quot; in those cases in which neither team argues in a manner consistent befitting a public advocate, closed cross examination, and a focus on argumentation and delivery. Also, half of all tournament judges are &#x27;lay judges&#x27; - that is, they are not debate coaches. Membership in NEDA is awarded to individuals, not institutions, and all members must apply and be approved the governing body. The intended focus is on the clash over the issues central to the debate proposition. The debate is similar to Public Forum debate in that it is audience-friendly, but is more formal, and more evidence-based. 

== History ==

NEDA began in the fall of 1994 at the Central States Communication Association convention in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. About thirty debate educators and their institutions left the Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA) because they felt CEDA tournaments were no longer conducive to the audience-centered debate to which they were philosophically committed and desired to teach their students. The resulting organization was co-founded by Gary Horn, professor at Ferris State University, and Larry Underberg, then a professor at the University of South Dakota. There were quickly nineteen other founding members of the association. In 1999, the Western division of NEDA became the Great Plains Forensic Conference.

==Divisions==

Teams in NEDA compete in one of three categories:
* Crossfire Debate - Developed from Ted Turner style televised debates, this format is more interactive, involves more cross-examination, and emphasizes succinct arguments that get to the heart of the issues quickly.
*Rapidfire Debate - The division may only be entered by an individual.
* Policy Debate - Policy debate is an American form of debate competition in which teams of two usually advocate for and against a resolution that typically calls for policy change by the United States federal government. Evidence presentation is a crucial part of Policy Debate; however, ethical arguments also play a major role in deciding the outcome of the round. The main argument being debated during a round of Cross-Examination is which team has a greater impact.
* Novice - Standard cross-examination format of debate for competitors who have participated in six or fewer tournaments ever (including high school).
* Open - Standard cross-examination format debate for debaters who have competed at six or more tournaments.

<text>Hans-Thilo Schmidt (13 May 1888 – 19 September 1943) codenamed Asché or Source D, was a German spy who sold secrets about the Enigma machine to the French during World War II. The materials he provided facilitated Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski&#x27;s reconstruction of the wiring in the Enigma&#x27;s rotors and reflector; thereafter the Poles were able to read a large proportion of Enigma-enciphered traffic. He was the younger brother of Wehrmacht general Rudolf Schmidt.

==Selling Enigma secrets==

A former officer, Schmidt had been forced to leave the army having suffered from gas during the First World War. His brother, Rudolf Schmidt, secured him a civilian post at the German Armed Forces&#x27; cryptographic headquarters, the Cipher Office. Shortly after the military version of the Enigma machine was introduced, he contacted French intelligence and offered to supply information about the new machine. His offer was accepted by Captain Gustave Bertrand of French Intelligence, and he received from the French the codename &quot;Asché&quot;, and was assigned a contact, the French agent codenamed &quot;Rex&quot;.

For the next several years, until he left his position in Germany, he met with French agents at various European cities and supplied them copies of the Enigma machine&#x27;s instruction manual, operating procedures, and lists of key settings. Even with this information, however, French Intelligence was unable to break messages encrypted on the Enigma. Nor were the British cryptologists whom Bertrand contacted able to make any headway.

In December 1932, Bertrand shared intelligence obtained from Asché with the Polish General Staff&#x27;s Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfrów). Mathematician-cryptologist Marian Rejewski had already set up a system of equations describing the operation of the then new German Army Enigma rotor-wirings. The key-settings lists provided by Schmidt helped fill in enough of the unknowns in Rejewski&#x27;s formulae, allowing him to speedily solve the equations and recover the wirings. That accomplished, the Poles were henceforth able to read Enigma traffic for nearly seven years to the outbreak of World War II as well as for a time into the War, while operating in conjunction with French intelligence in France. In a two-week January 1938 trial, they solved and read about three-quarters of all Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces) Enigma intercepts: a remarkable result, considering that parts of the raw intercepts were garbled or incomplete due to interference [Kozaczuk, &quot;Enigma&quot; 1984, p. 45].

After the Battle of France, the French agent who had been Schmidt&#x27;s case officer, a German citizen named Stallmann who went by the name &quot;Rodolphe Lemoine&quot; (fr) and used the codename &quot;Rex,&quot; was arrested by the Gestapo and betrayed Schmidt as a French spy. Schmidt was arrested on 1 April 1943, and in September 1943 his daughter Giselle was called on to identify his body; her account (as recounted in Hugh Sebag-Montefiore&#x27;s book) suggests that Schmidt had committed suicide.

<text>Margaret Okayo (born 30 May 1976) is a professional Kenyan marathon runner. She has won four World Marathon Majors with victories in the New York City Marathon (two times), the Boston Marathon and the London Marathon, setting three course records. Okayo&#x27;s 2003 New York course record of 2:22:31 still stands today, despite the challenge of some of the world’s best distance runners having the benefit of improved shoe technology. She has also won the San Diego Marathon on two occasions.

==Biography==
Margaret Okayo started running while at primary school. She graduated from the &quot;Itierio Secondary School&quot;, located near Kisii town, in 1993. She was recruited by Kenya Prisons Service, home to the country&#x27;s top women&#x27;s marathon runners, in 1995 where she nurtured her running career.

At the 1998 Commonwealth Games she finished fifth in 10,000 metres. She finished thirteenth at the 1999 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships.

Amongst her most successful races are the wins at the New York Marathon in 2001 and 2003, the Boston Marathon in 2002 and the London Marathon in 2004. She still holds the course records at the New York Marathon and the Boston Marathon.

Other marathons won by Okayo include Milan in 2003, San Diego in 2000 and 2001. She represented her native Kenya in the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, but did not finish the marathon. She spends three months of every year training in Italy.

She won the 2003 Udine Half Marathon and finished third at the 2008 Rome-Ostia Half Marathon.

Okayo is of the Gusii tribe. She is managed by Federico Rosa and coached by Gabriele Rosa.

<text>Spennymoor is a town and civil parish in County Durham, England. It is south of the River Wear and is south of Durham. The civil parish includes the villages of Kirk Merrington, Middlestone Moor, Byers Green and Tudhoe. In 2011 the parish had a population of 19,816.

==History==
===Origins===
The land on which Spennymoor now stands was once a vast expanse of moorland covered with thorn and whin bushes (Spenny Moor). In 1336 its place-name was recorded as &quot;Spendingmor&quot;. The name is probably derived from the Old English or Old Norse &quot;spenning&quot; and &quot;mōr&quot;, meaning a moor with a fence or enclosure.

Another theory of the place-name&#x27;s origin is from the Latin &quot;spina&quot;, meaning thorn (possibly from the Roman influence at Binchester) combined with the Old English or Old Norse &quot;mōr&quot;. CE Jackson, in his &quot;Place Names of Durham&quot; published in 1916 suggested a combination of the Old Norse &quot;spaan&quot; with Old English &quot;mar&quot;, meaning the moor named after the shingle-hut erected thereon.

Neither Britons nor Romans cultivated the moor, but on the site of Binchester, a village about to the southwest, the Romans built a camp around which grew up the settlement of Vinovia. The name Binchester is the usual Old English corruption or adaptation of the Roman site name.
This fortress must have been of great strength, for it stood on a height above the River Wear; many coins, urns, altars and pieces of Roman pottery have been found, as well as the remains of a hypocaust of the heating system. Later, Binchester became one of the &quot;vills&quot; of the Earl of Northumberland who held it until 1420 when it passed to the Nevilles who finally forfeited it with other lands in 1569.
As is to be expected, the moor itself offers little of historical interest but it is linked with the records of Kirk Merrington, Whitworth Old Park, Binchester, Byers Green and Tudhoe, all of which form a part of the early days of Spennymoor. All these villages had common rights on the moor but, as it became denuded by increasing flocks, some of the local people were induced to relinquish their rights and so, gradually, the common became the property of just one owner – Merrington Priory. The Manor of Merrington belonged successively to the priors, monks and dean and chapter of Durham Cathedral.

Today, Merrington church is one of the most prominent local landmarks. It was originally built by the Normans and its splendid strategic position led to it being fortified in 1143 by the Scots intruder, William Cumyn. When he was finally attacked and overcome, the church roof was destroyed but the building remained as one of the most interesting Norman churches in the county until 1850 when it was almost wholly rebuilt – although retaining the form of its predecessor. Inside, the most interesting feature is the screen, a typical example of late-17th-century work.

===Troubled years===
The Norman Conquest meant little to the border folk at first, for they had lived with the constant threat of massacre by raiding Picts and Danes, but then William&#x27;s soldiers &quot;laid waite&quot; the county and distributed the Saxon nobles&#x27; estates among themselves. However, William allowed some of the previous owners to retain their lands, and one of these was Whittleworth – now Whitworth – whose first known proprietor was Thomas de Acle who held it in 1183.
Nevertheless, the whole of this countryside was made desolate by William&#x27;s soldiers, and for many years it was the haunt of outlaws and wild animals.

On 16 October 1346 David of Scotland was encamped with a great army on the hills near Durham, and raiding bands under a Douglas had been terrorising the neighbourhood. Edward lll was otherwise engaged at Crecy in France at the time, but his Queen, Phillipa, with the Archbishop of York, the Bishops of Durham, Lincoln and Carlisle, and the Lords Neville and Percy and others marched North, and with an array of 16,000 men, moved along the ridge from Auckland to Merrington. Her advance guards clashed with some of Douglas&#x27; men near Ferryhill and chased them back to the bridge at Croxdale (Sunderland Bridge). Butchers Race, one of the Five Lanes which meet at Tudhoe Crossroads, was so named after this foray. The next day the main bodies of the two armies met at Neville&#x27;s Cross, near Durham, and the Scots were slaughtered. During the battle, the prior from Durham and his monks knelt on a little hillock in the Shaw Wood and prayed for an English victory while holding aloft, impaled on a spear, the Holy Corporax Cloth from the Cathedral.

In 1420 the Manor of Whitworth and much of the other land in the vicinity, from Raby to Brancepeth, and including Old Park, Byers Green, Newfield and Tudhoe, became Neville property, and the Earl of Westmorland (a Neville) was granted a licence from Bishop Langley to impark 40 acres at Whitworth, and so began the Whitworth park of today.

The moor itself comes into the record in 1615 as the result of &quot;a general muster on the moor of all men able to bear arms within the bishopric, between the ages of 15 and 60; the gathering amounted to 8,320&quot; (Fordyce). Some military training seems to have been given, doubtless with a view to the then unsettled state of the country due to the growing tension between Parliament and the King. Quite a few of these men must have been miners, as at that time &quot;coale pits&quot; were being worked at Whitworth, Byers Green and Fernhill. In 1677 the small freeholders and the local gentry divided 243 acres of the moor between themselves, an act which was confirmed by the Chancery Court. The only portion of the common that was left was a small plot reserved for the use of a spring of water.

===The rise of industry===
Up to 1800 the moor remained largely barren and the few roads across it were dangerous. The one good road was maintained by tolls collected at turnpike gates. Some of the largest horse-race meetings in the North took place on the moor, and miners and their families attended in all their holiday splendour. These men, early industrial workers, wore their hair long and on these gala days it flowed freely over their shoulders instead of, as usually was the case, being tied in curls. Floral waistcoats and ribboned hats were worn on these highly colourful occasions.

Modern Spennymoor was built on mining and has its origins with the sinking of the Wittered pit in 1839. Rough houses were built for the pit workers – houses with two rooms and a loft, more like &quot;piggeries than human habitation&quot; according to Dodd. The first coal from Merrington Colliery was brought up in 1841; a pit with a chequered career which only prospered under the partnership of L.M Reay and R.S. Johnson, who made a fortune out of it. The trade depression of the late 19th century, however, caused its closure in 1882.

The coal mining at Whitworth and a small foundry at Merrington Lane were the earliest industries, but in 1853 the Weardale Iron and Coal Company opened its great ironworks at Tudhoe. As a result, many hundreds of immigrant workers came here from the Midlands and more rows of dark little houses were erected. More workers came from Wales and Lancashire, with the opening of the mine at Page Bank (ten people died in a pit fire here in 1858), and with the sinking of a new pit at Tudhoe in the 1880s. The latter resulted in colliery workers&#x27; houses springing up on the main Durham road. Slightly before that, in the 1860s, a rather advanced area of working-class housing had been erected at Tudhoe Grange, built by Marmaduke Salvin to house local workers. These houses were, unusually, semi-detached and arranged in a chequerboard layout, in contrast to the dreary terraces that were then the standard.

Although these days of rapid industrialisation and rapid growth of population were days of ignorance and squalor, they also saw the 19th-century drive for education and religion. A National School was built and opened in 1841; St Paul&#x27;s Church was built at Spennymoor in 1858 and all through these formative years the Non-conformist churches combined welfare work with prayer. An era of prosperity dawned in the 1860s and 1870s when the miners were earning £1 per day. Spennymoor was ringed with collieries, black furnaces and coke ovens and the new prosperity showed itself in the building of better houses and in the opening of Co-operative stores. The comparative isolation of its moorland situation ended too with the opening of a branch railway from the mainline at Ferryhill in 1876.

However, as always in industrial life, boom was followed by &quot;bust&quot; – or &quot;near bust&quot;, and by 1879 miners&#x27; wages were down to 4s 9d a day and those of ironworkers to a mere 3s a day. On top of these economic misfortunes came the terrible explosion at Tudhoe Colliery in 1882 when 37 people died. A strike, which lasted 13 weeks, paralysed the area in 1892, although out of the enforced idleness came foundations of new growth, for the machinery at the Tudhoe Iron works was then renovated and a new mill laid down. The works then possessed the largest mill in Europe, capable of rolling plates up to 13 feet in width.

===20th century===
When, in 1894, Spennymoor and its adjacent villages achieved a measure of self-government on the Spennymoor Urban District Council, the new authority found itself facing a legacy of poor housing. With few exceptions, the housing situation was little better than when Dodd had described the houses as &quot;more like piggeries&quot;. In 1874 the then Local Government Board had reported:
&quot;Nothing could well exceed the nuisance attendant on the disposal of excrement and refuse in Spennymoor. There are entire streets without any closet accommodation whatever and in its stead open wooden boxes are placed opposite nearly every doorway for the reception of the excrement, ashes and other refuse; an arrangement which, besides being revolting to every sense of decency, is stated to be offensive in the extreme, especially in hot weather. It is impossible to walk between the rows of cottages without being convinced that the surface of the ground is to a large extent composed of the overflowing contents of these midden boxes. The back streets stand deep in filth and mud.&quot;
These appalling conditions continued into the 20th century and even by 1920 fewer than 10% of the town houses had water closets. In 1923 only four houses were built and there was still massive overcrowding in back to back properties. In the next few years only between one and four houses were built in any year and in 1929 the housing situation was still reported as acute which, from the recorded facts, seems self-evident.

These squalid conditions were paralleled by the ever-uncertain economic conditions in industry. Although coal-mining continued and the ironworks and engineering businesses were also providing employment, the start of the 20th century saw the start, too, of a long period of depression. The first blow was the closure in 1901 of the ironworks which had been rendered obsolete by the pace of change elsewhere.
The effect of the closure was relieved by the sinking of the Dean and Chapter colliery in 1904, but the reliance on this one basic industry was to persist until the 1960s. Even before the big coal strike of 1926 the collieries had begun to close. Three closed in 1924 and the strike saw another two fail. Spennymoor became part of the South West Durham depressed area. Although schemes were inaugurated to relieve the gloom nothing could make up for the lack of steady employment. In 1930 the coke ovens which remained on the ironworks site were only working intermittently. Even by 1938 the situation had improved little. The Cleveland iron trade, which used the coal and coke produced at Spennymoor, was depressed. The production of these raw materials at Coulson&#x27;s engineering works, Kenmir&#x27;s furniture factory and newly opened brickworks at Todhills were the main, if limited, sources of employment. Unemployment was over 33%.

===Modern era===
Despite the high levels of unemployment, the housing situation at last took an upturn in the 1930s when the Urban District Council began to use its wider powers to take action on unfit houses. By 1935 the first 66 Council houses had been built, and a year later the first 106 North Eastern Housing Association houses were erected on the Racecourse Estate site. Although these were the only houses built before the war, they did provide some hope and allowed the clearance of some of the worst of the squalid areas. Nevertheless, the situation remained bad and there were still far too many damp, badly lit and ventilated houses opening onto small paved yards or back streets.

World War II had diverse effects upon the town. On the one hand it brought housing efforts almost to a standstill, but on the industry front it saw the resurgence of Spennymoor as a major centre. The main factor was the opening in 1941 of a Royal Ordnance Factory at Merrington Lane and since then this estate has provided a constant source of alternative employment to the coal industry. The end of World War II, however, saw this industrial activity greatly curtailed and hard times returned, although without the severity of the earlier pre-war years. The run-down of the mining industry, however, was nevertheless a serious blow.

On 24 December 1944, Tudhoe&#x27;s cricket ground was hit by a rogue V-1 flying bomb, which had been air-launched by a German Heinkel He 111 and was aimed at Manchester. The explosion cratered the field and blew out the windows of surrounding houses and of St Charles&#x27; Church. This was the furthest north any V-1 landed during World War II.

In 1963 changes were indicated and Durham County Council and then Ministry of Housing and Local Government agreed that Spennymoor should be a new &quot;growth point&quot; and that town centre redevelopment should take place; that the Tudhoe ironworks site should be reclaimed; that a major highway scheme should be put into hand; that the Royal Ordnance Factory Industrial Estate should be extended and that the Green Lane Industrial Estate should be developed.

Spennymoor shared some brief film success in the early 90&#x27;s with the production of &#x27;Anymore for Spennymore&#x27; starring a few of the locals.

There were, of course, early problems, but the new industries became established and, in most cases, began to expand. The coal industry has been replaced by manufacturers of consumer goods, and factories of Electrolux, Thorn Lighting and Black and Decker were established. Rothmans International also had a cigarette factory, employing more than 400 people, in Spennymoor from circa 1980 up until 2000.

Housing, too, has made great strides since the end of the War. By the end of 1963 over 1,120 sub-standard houses had been cleared and as many new Council houses built for letting – whilst over 400 houses had been improved by grant aid. In 1963 too there came the first private building developments to take place since back in the days of the 19th-century colliery owners. The 800 house estate at Greenways and the 300 house estate at Tudhoe Grange were started, although it was not until the industrial prosperity of the 1970s that private house building reached 100 a year.

The greatest project came with the development of the Tudhoe ironworks site – 70 acres that was turned into the Bessemer Park Housing Estate. In 1968 work commenced on blocks of flats and houses there (comprising 1,009 household units in total) and this allowed the clearance of 500 unfit houses as well as the provision of housing for workers coming to the new factories. The blocks of flats on the Bessemer Park Housing Estate were subsequently demolished in the 1980s, due to serious problems with damp in the flats that rendered them extremely unpopular with tenants.

In 1966 the town opened a new bus station, between Cambridge Street and Silver Street, to relieve traffic congestion on the High Street. This bus station was subsequently redeveloped as a car park circa 1990. Also in 1966, the nearby Parkwood Shopping Precinct (which included a Woolworths and a supermarket) was opened. In 2016 it was announced that the Parkwood Precinct would be substantially redeveloped due to low tenancy rates in the shops, an escalating issue since the turn of the millennium.

==Transport==
Spennymoor railway station opened in November 1845 and operated under several different companies before the nationalisation of Britain&#x27;s railways. It closed on 31 March 1952.

Buses continue to serve Spennymoor, most notably the thrice-per-hour Arriva North East route 6 between Durham and Bishop Auckland, as well as the twice-per-hour Go North East limited-stop route X21 between Newcastle and Bishop Auckland.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from the Pontop Pike TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Newcastle, Capital North East, Heart North East, Smooth North East, Sun FM, Greatest Hits Radio North East, Durham On Air and Bishop FM, a community based station which broadcast from Bishop Auckland. The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;The Northern Echo&quot; and &quot;South West Durham News&quot;. 

==Notable people==
* John Bain, video game commentator and consumer rights advocate, lived and went to school in the town.
* Actor Gibson Gowland, was born in the town.
* Anne Wood, creator of the &quot;Teletubbies&quot; and &quot;In The Night Garden&quot;, was born and brought up in Spennymoor.
* Chloe Castro, singer and songwriter.
* Norman Cornish (18 November 1919 – 1 August 2014) was an English mining artist.
* George Courtney, football referee.

==Politics==
Spennymoor had elected Labour MPs for many years, but in recent times the area has become more marginal. From 1918 to 1950 it had its own parliamentary constituency, from 1950 to 1974 it was in the Durham constituency and from 1974 to 1983 in the North West Durham constituency. From 1983 to 1997 it was part of the Sedgefield constituency; during this time the MP was Tony Blair, who was Leader of the Opposition for the last three years of his tenure as the town&#x27;s MP. The town had been moved out of the constituency by the time he became Prime Minister. Since 1997 it has been part of the Bishop Auckland constituency, whose MP from 2005 to 2019 was Helen Goodman, from the Labour Party. In 2019 the seat elected its first Conservative MP, Dehenna Davison.

Spennymoor returns 5 County Councillors to Durham County Council from two Electoral Divisions covering the town, and its constituent villages. Tudhoe Division covers Tudhoe Village, Tudhoe Moor, and Low Spennymoor. Spennymoor Division covers Spennymoor, Middlestone Moor, and Byers Green.

Spennymoor also has its own Town Council, Spennymoor Town Council, which provides local services such as Jubilee Park, the Spennymoor Town Hall, Allotments and various play areas and community centres throughout the Town.

==Landmarks==
===Whitworth Hall===

Dating from 1183, the Whitworth Hall estate was owned by and home to the Shafto family for over 300 years, including County Durham MP &quot;Bonnie Bobby Shafto&quot;, made famous by the well known ballad and nursery rhyme. It is now the site of Whitworth Hall Hotel and the deer park for which the estate is famed is still well tended, as is the walled garden.

===Spennymoor Settlement===
A local arts community founded in the 1930s by Bill &amp; Betty Farrell with the aid of the Pilgrim Trust, &quot;To encourage tolerant neighbourliness and voluntary social services and give its members opportunities for increasing their knowledge, widening their interests, and cultivating their creative powers in a friendly atmosphere&quot;. The Settlement was home to the town&#x27;s first library, and amongst famous local people who were a part of its history were Norman Cornish, &quot;the pitman painter&quot; and Shildon-born writer Sid Chaplin. The building is a centre for the arts- mostly drama and music, but other community events take place here.

===Durham Mining Museum===

The Durham Mining Museum is housed in Spennymoor Town Hall, and covers mining in the north of England - mines in the historic counties of County Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmorland, and North Yorkshire&#x27;s ironstone mines. The displays comprise three sections: a display of small mining artefacts, models of larger machines, and a simulation of a mine tunnel for visitors to experience. It was opened in 1998, has been a registered charity since 2000, and is supported by a Friends group. Its display rooms are open to the public on weekdays and Saturdays except bank holidays, and it maintains a website holding a large amount of archive material. The museum is &quot;dedicated to the memory of more than 24,000 men, women and children who have lost their lives in mining related accidents in the North of England since 1293&quot;.

==Miners&#x27; banner==
A new banner was marched for the first time in the 2006 Durham Miners&#x27; Gala (&quot;The Big Meeting&quot;), representing 13 (former) local collieries. The banner was unfurled on the night before the big meeting, by MEP Stephen Hughes and long-time trade unionist Rodney Bickerstaffe, General Secretary of the trade union UNISON from 1995 to 2001. Its first outing on the following day began with visits to &#x27;The Tubs&#x27;, a miners&#x27; memorial made from tubs once used underground in Ellington Colliery, Northumberland, which honours the memory of all of the men and boys who died in the mines of Spennymoor and district, then went on to two war memorials, the main cenotaph outside the leisure centre and a smaller memorial in Tudhoe Cemetery.

==Facilities and sport==

The main attraction in Spennymoor is Victoria Jubilee Park which was given to the people of the town by Queen Victoria to celebrate the jubilee of her reign, and is sited on land which was once part of the Whitworth Hall estate of the Shafto family. Until World War II there was a cannon from the Crimean War on display in the park, this was taken away to be melted down for munitions. A Millennium arch was erected in the park.

The leisure centre houses a swimming pool, and offers swimming lessons, football coaching, martial arts tutoring, fitness classes, multi sensory room, badminton practice, a Lifestyle Fitness gym and gymnastic workouts and is also home to Regional Gymnasium Centre, made possible by funding from the National Lottery, Sport England and Sedgefield Borough Council, and is amongst the most modern in the country. There are also plans for a new regional arts centre to be added to the leisure centre, which stands at the junction of High Street and Cheapside in the town centre.

Spennymoor Town F.C. are the main local football team and won the FA Vase in 2013, after winning 2–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium against Tunbridge Wells.

<doc id="604556" wikidata="Q7605022" url="?curid=604556" title="Stay Beautiful (Manic Street Preachers song)">
<text>&quot;Stay Beautiful&quot; is a song by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 29 July 1991 by record label Columbia as the first single from the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot;.

== Content ==

The track started out under the working title of &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; and originally featured the lyrics &quot;Why don&#x27;t you just fuck off&quot; in the chorus, which was later cut to &quot;Why don&#x27;t you just... [gap]&quot; in the released version with a guitar fill in the aforementioned gap. It has since become customary for fans to shout the original lyric when the band occasionally perform the song live.

Marc Burrows of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; proclaimed &quot;Stay Beautiful&quot; a &quot;straightforward punker&quot;, and &quot;the most pure punk record in their arsenal&quot; alongside &quot;Repeat&quot;, and that it had &quot;more in common with their earlier indie-label records [...] than it does with its parent album&quot;.

== Music video ==

The music video for the song features the band performing inside a garishly coloured house being splashed with paint, before the setting is demolished by a clay-mation space octopus at the conclusion; referencing themes and events in Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Watchmen&quot;.

== Release ==

&quot;Stay Beautiful&quot; was released as a single on 29 July 1991 by record label Columbia. The single was the group&#x27;s first top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 40 on 10 August 1991. It was re-issued six years later but failed to return to the top 40 , reaching number 52 on 13 September 1997.

The B-sides for all formats included &quot;R.P. McMurphy&quot;, with the CD and 12-inch versions adding &quot;Soul Contamination&quot;. The title of &quot;R.P. McMurphy&quot; is based on the protagonist of Ken Kesey&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (which was subsequently made into a film).

== Influence ==

The title of &quot;Stay Beautiful&quot; was used by Renault in a television advertisement for a car in reference to the song.

Longtime music press champion of the band Simon Price co-created alternative &quot;glam/rock/trash&quot; nightclub Stay Beautiful. Named after the song, it drew heavily on the ethos and attitudes of the band, and during a solo tour to promote his debut album &quot;I Killed The Zeitgeist&quot;, bassist Nicky Wire performed there.

<text>The Movimiento Nacional () was a governing institution of Spain established by General Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War in 1937. During Francoist rule in Spain, it purported to be the only channel of participation in Spanish public life. It responded to a doctrine of corporatism in which only so-called &quot;natural entities&quot; could express themselves: families, municipalities and unions. It was abolished in 1977.

==Composition==
The Movimiento Nacional was primarily composed of:
*The sole legal party, called Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (FET y de las JONS) which had been created at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Other parties were prohibited (the sole name of &quot;party&quot; was prohibited to design any type of organization).
*The sole trade union organization, called Organización Sindical Española (OSE, popularly known as the &quot;Sindicato Vertical&quot;), composed of corporatist organizations which gathered employers and workers, in opposition to Marxism&#x27;s class warfare.
*All civil servants and holders of public office, were requested to swear an oath to the Principles of the National Movement.

==Leadership==
The National Movement was led by Francisco Franco, titled &quot;Jefe del Movimiento&quot; (English: Chief of the Movement), assisted by a &quot;Minister-Secretary General of the Movement&quot;. The hierarchy extended itself to all of the country, with a &quot;local chief of the movement&quot; named in each village.

==Ideology==
People who strongly identified with the Movimiento Nacional were colloquially known as &quot;Falangistas&quot; or &quot;Azules&quot; (&quot;Blues&quot;), from the colour of the shirts worn by the Falange Militia, José Antonio Primo de Rivera&#x27;s fascist organization created during the Second Spanish Republic. &quot;Camisas viejas&quot; (Old shirts) enjoyed the honour of being historical members of the Falange, compared to &quot;Camisas nuevas&quot; (New shirts), who could be accused of opportunism.

The ideology of the Movimiento Nacional was summed up by the slogan &quot;¡Una, Grande y Libre!&quot;, which stood for the indivisibility of the Spanish state and the refusal of any regionalism or decentralization, its imperial character, both past (the defunct Spanish Empire in the Americas) and foreseen (in Africa), and its independence towards the purported &quot;Judeo-Masonic-Marxist international conspiracy&quot; (a personal obsession of Franco), materialized by the Soviet Union, the European democracies, the United States (until the Pact of Madrid of 1953), or the &quot;exterior enemy&quot; which could threaten the nation at any time; as well as towards the long list of &quot;internal enemies&quot;, like &quot;anti-Spanish&quot;, &quot;reds&quot;, &quot;separatists&quot;, &quot;liberals&quot;, &quot;Jews&quot; and &quot;Freemasons&quot;, among others, coining expressions like &quot;judeomarxistas&quot;.

==Francoist &quot;families&quot;==
Since one-party rule was enforced in Francoist Spain, the only practical expression of pluralism consisted in the mixture of internal &quot;families&quot; (&quot;Familias del Regimen&quot;) competing together inside the National Movement. These roughly included four &quot;families&quot; with a genealogy tracing back to the right-wing political groups in the interwar period: the Falangists (or &quot;azules&quot;, originally from the Fascist FE de las JONS), with a preeminence over FET y de las JONS, the Spanish Syndical Organization (OSE), and the &quot;social&quot; government areas; the Carlists (issued from Traditionalist Communion), who held a tight control over the Ministry of Justice; the monarchist Alfonsines (issued from Renovación Española and Acción Española), well connected to the economic elites and the military command; and the National Catholics, &quot;Catholics&quot; in the sense of closely linked to politically Catholicist entities serving the Church&#x27;s interests (issued from CEDA), embodied by the Asociación Católica de Propagandistas (ACNP). In addition, a new family emerged in the 1950s, the &quot;technocrats&quot;, conservatives linked to the Opus Dei who embraced a businesslike approach to the administration of the State.

Franco held his power by balancing these internal rivalries, cautious not to show any favoritism to any of them nor compromise himself too much to anyone.

Fractions of those families eventually migrated to dissident stances. These included examples such as the intermittent dissent of a part of the &quot;Alfonsist monarchists&quot; who vouched for an immediate coronation of Juan de Borbón as king, as well as sizeable part of the Catholicist family joining by late Francoism the opposition to the dictatorship subsumed within Christian democratic groups.

<text>A county archaeologist is a local government employee in the United Kingdom responsible for overseeing development-led archaeological investigations as required by PPG16. Nominated as the archaeological advisor by each local planning authority, the County Archaeologist recommends which developments are likely to threaten archaeological sites, and advises methods of mitigating their impact, usually through the imposition of planning conditions. The role developed in the 1970s in response to damage done to Britain&#x27;s archaeological resources in the 1960s.

Other responsibilities include maintaining the Sites and Monuments Record, managing the Portable Antiquities Scheme, education and outreach activities and co-ordinating research agendas. It has become more common for this position to lead a team or staff in carrying out their responsibilities in these areas.

In London the County Archaeologist&#x27;s role is filled by English Heritage except in Southwark and The City.

<doc id="604570" wikidata="Q2355196" url="?curid=604570" title="Martinus Theunis Steyn">
<text>Martinus (or Marthinus) Theunis Steyn (; 2 October 185728 November 1916) was a South African lawyer, politician, and statesman. He was the sixth and last president of the independent Orange Free State from 1896 to 1902.

== Early life ==

The Steyn family lived near Winburg on the farm Josephinesdal. Steyn was born on 2 October 1857 on the farm Rietfontein near Winburg in the Orange Free State. His father Marthinus (known as Marthinus &#x27;blinkstewels&#x27;) was away from home, following the death of his own father, to assist his mother on a three-month-long round trip from Winburg to Swellendam in the Cape Colony. As Steyn&#x27;s mother, Cecilia, was pregnant with Marthinus Theunis, they thought it safer for her to stay with her sister Gertruida, who was married to Theunis Wessels, a farmer at Rietfontein. Steyn was intended to be named only Marthinus after his father, but because of the care that Theunis and Gertruida took during Cecilia&#x27;s pregnancy, Steyn was named both after his father Marthinus and his uncle Theunis. In later years his family always called him Theunis.

During the Free State–Basotho War of 1858, the Steyns were driven from their farm and lost almost everything. After the death of Steyn&#x27;s two grandfathers, his Wessels grandmother convinced his father to buy his own farm. They bought the farm Suurfontein/Zuurfontein, on the Modder River, about 13 miles from Bloemfontein. It is on this farm that Steyn spent most of his youth, and experienced the open and free spaces of the Free State.

Steyn started his school years in a small farm school, on the farm Rooiwal. The school was forty minutes away by horse and the teacher was Mr. Wiggins, who taught in English. Another Basotho War started in 1864, disrupting the family, and causing Theunis and his brother Tewie to stay with their grandmother in Wessels, where they attended a small grammar school briefly; afterward they were sent to Grey College.

At the age of 16, he left school with his brother Tewie to farm on Zuurfontein. Steyn&#x27;s family lived right across from the then president of the Free State, J.H. Brand, in Bloemfontein. The family socialized with other groups of Dutch families. The Steyn home in Bloemfontein, Green Lodge, was the meeting place for the young people of Bloemfontein. The house was open for everybody: from the Fichardts of German origin, to the English speaking Robertses, to the Jewish Baumans, to English speaking Afrikaners, like President Brand, as well as the Dutch community.

== Studies ==

After finishing his studies at Grey College, and after farming for four years on Suurfontein/Zuurfontein, a visit by Judge James Buchanan, a member of the Orange Free State High Court changed Steyn&#x27;s direction from farming towards further studies in law. According to Judge Buchanan&#x27;s daughter, he was set on convincing Steyn&#x27;s father that they needed to send Steyn to the Netherlands to study law at Leiden University.

Steyn and his friend Harry Vels left in May 1877 on the Dunrobin Castle from Port Elizabeth for Cape Town and from there to Europe. In Cape Town, more passengers, including Rev. Colin Fraser and his family, on his way to Scotland as a delegate for the Free State Church at the Pan-Presbyterian Council (now known as the World Alliance of Reformed Churches), (accompanied by the 12-year-old Tibbie Fraser, later to become the wife of Steyn). Also on board was the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek government delegation consisting of Paul Kruger, the then Vice State President, E.J.P. Jorissen, the state attorney and their secretary, Willem Eduard Bok, on their way to England to lay a formal protest against the proclamation of Theophilus Shepstone asserting British sovereignty over the &quot;Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek&quot;.

Steyn and Vels did preparatory studies under W.F.P. Enklaar and Dr. B. Wisselink at the Gymnasium in Deventer. In September 1879, they would have taken their admission exams for the Leiden University, however, they decided to move to England instead. This decision was made as they needed an English certificate and training to be allowed to practice law in South Africa. Steyn took his admission exam in January 1880 for the Inner Temple in London. Steyn was called to the English bar in November 1882 and shortly afterward returned to South Africa.

== Law career ==

After his return to South Africa he set up practice as barrister in Bloemfontein. In 1889, Steyn was appointed state attorney of the Orange Free State. A few months afterwards he became second puisne judge, and in 1893 first puisne judge of the high court. His decisions won him a reputation for ability and sound judgment.

== Early political career ==
Marthinus &#x27;blinkstewels&#x27;, father of Steyn, as member of the Executive Council, regularly accompanied State President Johannes Brand on visits to determine the needs of the people of the Orange Free State. Steyn, as a lover of books, who took a small library of books with him during the Anglo-Boer War, was well read. Through his father and visits home, he kept in contact with the latest political views, activities and needs of the people.

Steyn&#x27;s first interest in the politics of the day was initiated by the disputed annexation of the diamond fields in the Kimberley area by the British government in 1871. Following the claims of the Griqua captain, Nicolaas Waterboer, the British government agreed that the Cape Governor, Sir Henry Barkly, could annex the land, in direct conflict to the wishes of the Cape Colony Government and the Orange River Convention (Bloemfontein Convention) of 1854. The resolution of the payment, £90, 000 and the building of a railway to the Orange Free State by the British government in 1876, was not deemed acceptable to the general public.

== President of the Orange Free State ==

In 1895, upon the resignation of state president Francis William Reitz, Steyn was the candidate of the pan-Dutch party for the vacant post. The election was held in February 1896 and resulted in a decisive victory for Steyn, who assumed office as president. The beginning of the Second Boer War, in 1899, caused Steyn to link the fortunes of his state with those of the Transvaal, allying with it against the British Empire. While the Orange Free State was occupied by the British, Steyn ran his government from the field, playing a key role in continuing Boer resistance and the coordination of guerrilla warfare that made up most of the Boer War from 1900 onwards.

Regarded as one of the most irreconcilable of the Boer leaders, he took part, however, in the preliminary peace negotiations at Klerksdorp in April 1902 but was prevented by illness from signing the Treaty of Vereeniging at Pretoria on 31 May 1902. The treaty ended the independence of the Orange Free State and Steyn&#x27;s term as its president.

== After 1902 ==

By 1902, Steyn was suffering from myasthenia gravis brought on by his constant exertions; and in July 1902 he sailed for Europe, where he remained until the autumn of 1904. He then took the oath of allegiance to the British crown, and returning to South Africa partially restored to health resumed active participation in politics. In 1908–1909, he was vice-president of the National Convention, the constitutional convention which resulted in the establishment of the Union of South Africa. Here he was distinguished for his statesmanlike and conciliatory attitude, while maintaining the rights of the Boer community.

While addressing a meeting in Bloemfontein in November 1916, he collapsed and died of a heart attack, at 59.
== Legacy ==

;Afrikaner Bond

From early on, Steyn, along with many other prominent Freestaters, came under the influence of a German, Carl Borckenhagen, the editor of the &quot;Bloemfontein Express&quot; newspaper, and in 1881 he had joined Borckenhagen in founding the Afrikaner Bond.

;South African Party

In the Union of South Africa, he was a co-founder of the South African Party which he left in 1914 with James Barry Munnik Hertzog and Christiaan Rudolf de Wet to found the National Party.

;National Party
Steyn, James Barry Munnik Hertzog and Christiaan Rudolf de Wet co-founded the National Party in 1914.

;The C&amp;N Oranje Meisieskool
The Anglo-Boer War and the great loss of women and children was a driving force behind the origin of the C&amp;N Oranje Meisieskool, an originally Dutch and now Afrikaans girls school, that was initiated by Steyn. The school opened its doors in 1907.

;National Woman&#x27;s Monument
The Vrouemonument, the first monument in the world dedicated to women and children, was unveiled on 16 December 1913 and was initiated by the ideals of Steyn and the family friend, Emily Hobhouse. The sculptor Anton van Wouw and the architect Frans Soff designed the monument.

;University of the Free State

In December 1895, Steyn mentioned in his election speech that he would do everything possible to see to it that the children of the Orange Free State received a good education. He consulted with the Government (Volksraad) to devise a framework to uplift the standard of education to the same level of other wealthier states. Steyn believed that education would bring about unification between different groups in the Free State.

During his inauguration speech in 1896, President Steyn stated that his vision, with regards to educational facilities, for the city of Bloemfontein was a university where youth from all over the country could come and study.

The University of the Free State was established as a higher institute of learning in 1904.

== Descendants ==
Many of Steyn&#x27;s descendants followed the family tradition of a career in politics or the legal profession.

Steyn&#x27;s son, Dr. Colin Steyn, was a Minister of Justice and Minister of Employment in Jan Smuts&#x27; South African Party Cabinet.

Steyn&#x27;s grandson, Marthinus Steyn - also known as Theunie - was a Judge in the South African Supreme Court of Appeal. He also served as Administrator-General of South-West Africa during its transition to the independent Republic of Namibia. During his tenure as Administrator-General, Theunie played an important role in instituting democratic reforms, including universal suffrage.

Another grandson of Steyn, Jan, was a partner and head of the Patent Department of Pretoria law firm Adams &amp; Adams.

&quot;The nation of the Orange Free State stand ready for war in such circumstances where peace cannot be secured with honour, and although we recognize our shortcomings, our nation depend on the power of God to deliver us and secure us a victory. With a deep understanding of what we can expect when we place our trust in the Almighty, our nation will enter the war with courage and will fight until the bitter end to preserve the independence of our beloved fatherland&quot;

<doc id="604572" wikidata="Q3632268" url="?curid=604572" title="Nariman Point">
<text>Nariman Point is a prominent downtown area of Mumbai in Maharashtra, India. Located on the southern tip of the Mumbai peninsula, at the end of the Mumbai&#x27;s Marine Drive, Nariman Point houses some of India&#x27;s prestigious business headquarters. 

It is bordered by Churchgate in North, Arabian Sea on West and South, by Colaba on East side. It is one of the tourist attractions of Mumbai due to its skyline, Arabian sea view, Marine drive and lots of luxury 5 star hotels, restaurants.

==History==
Prior to 1940, the area was part of the Arabian sea. A popular leader of the Congress, Khurshed Nariman (affectionately called &quot;Veer&quot; Nariman), a Bombay Municipal Corporation corporator, proposed the land reclamation of the area of sea near Churchgate. To accomplish this task, the shallow seafront was filled with debris from various parts of the city. Reinforced concrete cement was also used, the steel for which had to be purchased on the black market at higher prices due to World War II.The entire cost was estimated to be (equivalent to about in 2025). Additional reclamations were carried out in the 1970s. A construction boom in that decade also led to the development of commercial high-rises in the area.

In 2006, prior to the financial crisis of 2007–08, Nariman point was the seventh most expensive location in the world for office space. However, by December 2012 Nariman Point had fallen to 25th place while Delhi&#x27;s Connaught Place remained the fifth most expensive location despite many offices moving to Gurgaon and Noida. During the same period, Nariman Point also dropped from seventh to fifteenth most expensive location for office rentals. The reasons for the decline were the high prices, lower quality and age of construction, and increasing distances from residential hubs which have now moved northwards and to the suburbs. In the first three quarters of 2012, Nariman Point had a vacancy rate of almost 25%, compared with 18% in the rest of the Mumbai city.
 
=== Terrorist attacks === 

In 1993, the 1993 Bombay bombings took place. Bombs were destroyed at Nariman point and nearby places. There were also bombs in other parts of the city. 

On the evening of 26 November 2008, Pakistan trained Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists attacked the luxury hotels Trident and Oberoi, located in this area. Both are luxury hotels. The terrorists attacked people with AK-47 assault rifles and Hand Grenades. This was part of the larger Mumbai terrorist attack. 166 people were killed, 238 injured to various degrees, and the Taj Hotel was besieged for 3 days. The Mumbai police apprehended one of the terrorists, Ajmal Kasab. The rest were eliminated in various operations by India&#x27;s security forces.

==Economy==

Notable Headquarters and Offices

For many years, Air India operated from the Air India Building, one of the district&#x27;s most recognizable landmarks, symbolizing the prominence of the national airline. Renewable energy companies, including Ind Renewable Energy Ltd and Vakharia Power Infrastructure Ltd, are headquartered in Regent Chambers, a prominent commercial building at 208 Nariman Point, housing various energy and infrastructure firms.

International Presence

Several multinational companies have also chosen Nariman Point for their Indian operations. For example, All Nippon Airways, Japan&#x27;s largest airline, once maintained its Mumbai sales office at the Oberoi Trident Towers, which is known for accommodating international businesses and embassies, adding to the area&#x27;s global business footprint.

Business and Infrastructure Development

Over the years, Nariman Point has experienced infrastructure improvements and urban developments to support the high volume of corporate and commercial traffic. It remains a key business area despite rising commercial real estate costs and increasing competition from newer business districts like the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). Its historical importance, prime location, and concentration of financial institutions, including banks, insurance companies, and consulting firms, contribute to Nariman Point’s standing as one of India’s premier business centers.

<doc id="604575" wikidata="Q219098" url="?curid=604575" title="Sport Club do Recife">
<text>Sport Club do Recife (), commonly known as Sport Recife or simply Sport, is a Brazilian sports club, located in Recife, Pernambuco. Founded in 1905, the club currently competes in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the top tier of football in Brazil, and in the Campeonato Pernambucano, the state of Pernambuco&#x27;s top state league division. 

In football, the club has won six CBD/CBF titles, including three national and three regional. Its greatest achievement is winning the 2008 Copa do Brasil. In addition to professional football, the club also participates in women&#x27;s football and Olympic sports, such as rowing, swimming, hockey, basketball, futsal, volleyball, table tennis, taekwondo, judo and athletics.

Their historical rival is Náutico, and they both dispute the Clássico dos Clássicos. The derby against Santa Cruz is called the Clássico das Multidões, while the derby with América is called the Clássico dos Campeões.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
Sport Club do Recife was founded on 13 May 1905 by Guilherme de Aquino Fonseca, a member of a wealthy family in Pernambuco who found a love for football while studying engineering at the University of Cambridge in England. The club were the first recorded football club in the state of Pernambuco. Sport played their first match on 22 June 1905, drawing 2–2 against a team called English Eleven, a team formed by employees working for English companies in Recife.

The Campeonato Pernambucano was established in 1916, and Sport won the competition&#x27;s first two titles. From 1923 to 1925, Sport won the competition three consecutive times, and became &quot;tricampeão&quot; (three time champion).

=== International tours and military government years ===

Sport Recife celebrated their 50th anniversary in 1955 by winning their 15th state title. In 1957, the club toured Europe. A total of 17 matches were played, with 6 wins, 3 draws, and 8 defeats. These matches include the 5–3 loss against Real Madrid, which was the first night game at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.

Sport Recife participated in the 1963 International Soccer League, finishing fourth in their group, with 2 wins, 2 draws, and 2 defeats.

As a result of a dispute with the Federação Pernambucana de Futebol (FPF), Sport did not participate in the 1978 Campeonato Pernambucano.

===First National league title===

The 1987 Campeonato Brasileiro/Copa União resulted in Sport&#x27;s first national title, conquered in common justice. However, the club did not officially receive this title until 30 years later, in 2017. This was due to a dispute with Flamengo, who also claimed to have won the title, since the latter, champion of the 1987 championship, as well as Internacional, refused to compete in a quadrangular crossing with the finalist teams of Module B, in the case of Sport and Guarani. After topping group B in both the 1st and 2nd rounds Sport beat Bangu 5–4 on aggregate in the semi-final, and then Guarani 3–2 in the final. By winning the title, they qualified for the 1988 Copa Libertadores, but failed to qualify for the next stages of the competition, finishing third in their group, although with a notable 5–0 victory over Alianza Lima.

A terrible 1989 league campaign resulted in the club&#x27;s relegation. However, they won the 1990 Série B, with a 1–1 draw on aggregate against Atlético Paranaense in the final, but were awarded the title due to their better record across the season. Led by Givanildo Oliveira, Sport won the 1st edition of the Copa do Nordeste in 1994, beating hosts CRB on penalties after a 0–0 draw in normal time. 

===21st century===
In 2000, Sport won the Copa do Nordeste for the 2nd time, this time under the command of coach Celso Roth after a 2–2 draw against Vitória, again winning the title due to a superior record. In the next Copa do Nordeste edition, Sport finished as runner up, losing 3–1 to Bahia. 

In 2006 Sport were promoted to the 2007 Serie A by finishing second in the league table, after five years in Série B.

Sport became the first club from Northeastern Brazil to win the Copa do Brasil, beating Corinthians on away goals in the 2008 final. By winning the cup, Sport contested its second Copa Libertadores in 2009, and had a great start, finishing first of a group containing LDU, Colo-Colo and Palmeiras. They were drawn against Palmeiras in the next round, but were defeated on penalties, after drawing 1–1 on aggregate. In the second half of 2009, Sport disputed the Brasileirão, but could not repeat the excellent first half of the year, and finished in last place with a 4–0 defeat to Sao Paulo on the last matchday, being relegated to Série B with four managers throughout the season. 

&quot;O Leão da Ilha&quot; returned to Série A for the 2012 season, going through three managers – Helio dos Anjos, Mazola Júnior, and Paulo Gusmão, as they were relegated again with a seventeenth placed finish. Although they were in Serie B, Sport inherited a spot in the 2013 Copa Sudamericana by regulation of CBF towards the remnants of the Copa do Brasil. &quot;Leão&quot; were eliminated by Libertad of Paraguay with two losses in the 2nd phase, after eliminating rivals Náutico. 

2014 was a great year for Sport: they returned to Serie A, won their third Copa do Nordeste, 40th Campeonato Pernambucano, and finished 11th in the league, which ensured them a place in the following edition of the Copa Sudamericana. 

Although the club did not win any titles in 2015, Sport had a very good year, and kept coach Eduardo Baptista. The start of the year was poor, with Sport being eliminated from the state league by third division club Salgueiro. The club entered the Copa Sudamericana in the second stage, where they beat Bahia 4–2 on aggregate with an incredible comeback, as Bahia had won the first leg 1–0. In the next stage, they faced Argentine club Huracán, where they were eliminated after losing 4-1 on aggregate (1-1, 0-3). In the 2015 Série A, the club had its best campaign since 2000, finishing 6th in the table with 59 points; Sport went through 15 matches in the top 4 and was the league leader in five of them. However, after this great run, Sport went through a 10-match winless run, which saw the club drop to eleventh and caused the resignation of Baptista. After the arrival of Paulo Roberto Falcão, the club&#x27;s performances improved, although the goal of qualifying for the Copa Libertadores was not met.

In 2016 Sport finished 14th in the Serie A and qualified to the 2017 Copa Sudamericana. In the Copa Sudamericana, the club were knocked out by Junior in the quarter-finals, losing 2-0 on aggregate (0-0, 2-0), after eliminating Danubio on penalties (3-0, 0-3), Arsenal de Sarandí (2-0, 1-2), and Ponte Preta (3-1, 0-1). André Felipe was the club&#x27;s most important player in the Sudamericana campaign, scoring four goals, including two goals in the first leg and one in the second leg against Arsenal de Sarandí.

==Supporters==
In 2013, a study named Sport Recife as the 13th most supported club in Brazil, with around 2.4 million supporters countrywide. Supporters of the club are called &quot;Leonine&quot; and &quot;Sportistas&quot;.

The club has various organized supporter groups:

==Rivalries==
===Santa Cruz===
The &quot;Derby of Crowds&quot; (Clássico das Multidões) is the football encounter between the two largest fanbases from Pernambuco. Sport has a considerable advantage over their rivals in head to head results, with 236 wins against 169 from Santa Cruz.

===Náutico===
The Derby of Derbies (Clássico dos Clássicos) is the third oldest derby in the country, after the Clássico Vovô and the Grenal. It brings together the two oldest teams in Pernambuco, with Sport also having a large advantage overall, with 218 wins in the fixture, while Náutico won 187.

===América-PE===
The Champions Derby (Clássico dos Campeões) is one of the most ancient and classical derbies of Pernambuco, and is named that way because until the late 1930s, Sport and its archrival America were together the two teams with the highest number of titles, and were also the two main clubs of Recife. The derby lost popularity after the decline of América-PE, since they haven&#x27;t won any trophies since the 1940s. América are currently at the second division of the Campeonato Pernambucano.

===Esporte Clube Bahia===
The rivalry between Sport and Bahia is one of the biggest regional rivalries of Brazil. Both are the most successful football clubs from the Northeast region, as they are the only two clubs in the region to have won major national titles, and the clubs with most supporters across the region. The 2010s marked the growth of their rivalry, as both clubs&#x27; supporters saw their state rivals declining in comparison to them. Another important aspect about the rivalry is that Pernambuco and Bahia have their own rivalry, ranging from which is the most important state in the northeast region to which state deploys the best carnival in the country. The rivalry between states are nurtured the most between inhabitants of the state capitals, Recife and Salvador, which also are the cities where Sport Recife and Bahia are based.

==Facilities==

===Stadium===
*Avenida Malaquias

The stadium opened on 15 May 1918 with a match between America-PE and Flamengo. It belonged to Sport Recife from 1918 until 1937, and had a capacity for 8,000 people (2,000 being seated).

*Adelmar da Costa Carvalho Stadium (&quot;Ilha do Retiro Stadium)&quot;

Inaugurated on 4 July 1937, it is the club&#x27;s current stadium, and was named after club president Adelmar da Costa Carvalho, but is better known as Iilha do Retiro due to the neighborhood where it is located. The stadium has a maximum capacity for 30,000. It was considered the best stadium in Northeast Brazil until the construction of the Arena Pernambuco in 2013, which is currently the best the Northeast because of its structure and FIFA standards.

===Training Center===
*CT Presidente José de Andrade Médicis (&quot;CT do Leão&quot;)

The CT Presidente José de Andrade Medici, also known as CT do Leão, is the club&#x27;s training center for the professional team and all youth levels. Located in the city of Paulista, about 30 km from Recife, the site has a total area of 8 hectares (8,000 m2). The complex underwent major improvements in recent years, to prepare for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2014 FIFA World Cup.

The complex has 5 official fields, two hotels, a restaurant, a medical center, a gym, and dressing rooms. The training center was inaugurated on 9 September 2008.

==Symbols==

===Badge===
The first coat of arms had nothing to do with the current one. In one of the first statutes of the club the coat of arms was well defined: &quot;On an anchor, bearing the date 13 May 1905 on the arm, supported by a pair of oars crossing a mast containing a croquette, a lifeguard, and in the center a football between a cricket stick and a tennis racket, crossed and surrounded by the letters SCR, with the body containing the phrase &#x27;Sport Club Recife&#x27;. Soon, the number 1 badge represented all sports practiced by the club at the time, from cricket to spearfishing.

However, the coat was seen as too complex, difficult to reproduce and did not contain the crimson-black colors. So in 1919 then President Arnaldo Loyo faced a challenge that was considered extremely difficult at the time: get Sport to Belém do Pará to play a series of five friendlies. During the tour, Sport won three games and lost two.

On 3 April 1919, Sport played a Remo-Paysandu combination for a French bronze trophy called the Lion of the North, which had sculptures including a Greek archer accompanied by an imposing lion. This was a competition which at the time was considered very difficult for any team from Pernambuco, as football in Para was more developed. To the surprise of Pará, Sport won 2–1 and won the trophy. The disappointment from opposing fans was such that a fan invaded the ship where the Crimson-Black club kept the trophy, and damaged its tail with an iron pipe. This incident inspired the development of a new coat of arms for the club, and as a result the lion was adopted as the new symbol of the club because it represented boldness, courage and winning spirit. Designer Armando Vieira dos Santos was responsible for creating it, which was based on Scottish heraldry arms.

The stars present in the current badge are: 2 gold stars, for its two major titles (1987 Brasileirao Serie A and 2008 Copa do Brasil) and 1 silver star, for its minor titles (1990 Brasileirao Série B). The golden stars are larger than the silver one, and are located on the corners, while the silver star is smaller and is located in between the golden stars. 

===Anthem===

The official anthem of the club was created by Eunitônio Edir Pereira.

===Mascots===
In 1919, after the club won the Lion of the North trophy, the lion was selected as the mascot, and one of the club&#x27;s nicknames was created; &quot;Leão do Norte&quot; (Lion of the North).

The mascot is named Leo. It was created over 25 years ago by cartoonist Humberto Araujo, and since then has been illustrating the achievements of the club. Leo is present at all home games, and entertains the crowd at matches. The name &quot;Leo&quot; means &quot;lion&quot; in Latin.

==Colors and Uniforms==
The official colors of the club are black, red and gold. 

The uniforms of Sport are described in Article 8 of the 2nd chapter: &quot;In sports competitions, athletes from Sport Club do Recife will wear an official uniform, which will always have the SCR shield on their shirt, on their left side and at chest level, and obeys one of the following uniforms:&quot;

&quot;a) Shirt with black and red stripes, with white or black shorts and black socks;&quot;

&quot;b) White shirt, shorts and socks&quot;

&quot;c) Black shirt, shorts and socks, with pink accents;&quot;

&quot;d) Golden shirt, shorts and socks, with discreet pink and black details;&quot;

<text>Clube Náutico Capibaribe (), or simply Náutico, is a Brazilian multi-sport club based in Recife, Pernambuco. The club is most notable for its association football team, that plays in the Série C, the third tier of the Brazilian football league system, as well as in the Campeonato Pernambucano, the top division in the Pernambucano state football league system.

The origins of Náutico may be traced to the foundation of the &quot;Clube Náutico do Recife&quot; by a group of rowers (&quot;Náutico&quot; can be directly translated to &quot;nautical&quot;) in 1898, but the official founding date is April 7 of 1901. Its first football team dates back to 1905, with a squad formed by Englishmen and Germans.

Náutico is the only football club in Pernambuco that has won the state championship 6 times in a row (from 1963 to 1968). The club has a historical rivalry with local clubs Sport Recife and Santa Cruz. In Pernambuco, it was the first club to achieve regional and national prominence, and today, at the state level, it is the club with the most members, according to public information available on its official website. It is recognized as the most prominent club from the Northeast region in regional and national competitions during the 1960s, being, moreover, the club from the region that reached the most Brazilian Championship semifinals in that decade. Since then, it has been regarded as one of the “giants” of Northeastern Brazil football, a title still used today by its fans and in advertising campaigns and media.

Náutico has an important swimming arena, including an Olympic-sized pool that meets all world standards. It also has activities in other sports including hockey, basketball, volleyball, handball, women&#x27;s football, futsal, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Boxing, Taekwondo, kendo, Muay Thai, MMA and the founding sport of the club, rowing. The official mascot of Náutico is the opossum, known locally as the &quot;timbu&quot;.

Náutico has the 6th-largest core of fans in the Northeastern region of Brazil, and occupies the 21st place in the overall Brazilian ranking. In total, there were approximately 1.5 million Náutico fans in 2010, as showed by a Lance magazine and IBOPE research.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
Although the official founding date is April 7, 1901, the Clube Náutico Capibaribe had already been mentioned in the previous century, when two rival groups of rowers from Recife united. At the beginning, in 1897, a group of rowing enthusiasts led by the Portuguese João Victor da Cruz Alfarra rented boats from the old Lingueta, embarking on small excursions to the old Casa de Banhos in Pina. These trips extended as far as the neighborhood of Apipucos.

After the Canudos Revolt ended, Recife prepared to welcome the Pernambuco troops led by General Artur Costa. An extensive program was organized for the soldiers’ reception, and João Alfarra, along with some fellow rowers from the Capibaribe River, was tasked with organizing the nautical portion of the reception. A major regatta was scheduled for November 21, 1897.

This competition piqued the interest of the people of Recife, who felt the need to host more events of this kind. At the time, rowing was already a national sport and began to gain new followers. The following year, employees of warehouses on Duque de Caxias and Rangel streets formed an association named the Clube dos Pimpões. Members of the other group, which had excelled in the Canudos troops’ reception regatta, were inspired, and a series of races between the two groups took place in 1898 at the Casa de Banhos.

By the end of 1898, it was agreed to establish another society that would unite the two aforementioned groups: the Club Náutico do Recife. In 1899, its leaders decided to reorganize the club while maintaining a commitment to nautical sports. At that time, the club&#x27;s name was changed to Recreio Fluvial, but the new name was not well received. As a result, in early 1901, the name by which the club is officially recognized today was decided: Clube Náutico Capibaribe

On April 7, 1901, João Alfarra called on all those connected to rowing to attend a ceremony in which the first meeting minutes of the club would be written and recorded—a date that would be officially recognized as the club&#x27;s founding.
The historical document was signed by all present —Antonio Dias Ferreira, the meeting&#x27;s chairman; Piragibe Haghissé, the secretary; and João Victor da Cruz Alfarra, the group leader and the originator of the idea. The first flag featured red, white, and blue, which is why Náutico still uses blue for the numbers on its jerseys today. Náutico&#x27;s first uniform was blue and white to reflect its nautical roots, which served as the foundation of the club. However, red soon replaced blue and joined white, as red was already featured in the club&#x27;s flag.

==Stadium==
=== Estádio dos Aflitos ===
The Estádio Eládio de Barros Carvalho, popularly known as the Estádio dos Aflitos due to its location in the Aflitos neighborhood, is the stadium used by Clube Náutico Capibaribe. Opened on June 25, 1939, the name honors Eládio de Barros Carvalho, the club&#x27;s president for 14 terms. Náutico stopped using the stadium between June 2013 and December 2018, as they began holding games at Arena Pernambuco.

However, the partnership with Arena Pernambuco did not work out. The Odebrecht conglomerate (now known as Novonor), which managed the arena, failed to meet contractual obligations with Náutico, particularly in financial transfers, leading to a domino effect that resulted in poor on-field performances. During this period, there was also a loss of identity due to moving to the “new home,” which was over 15 km away from Aflitos and had limited public transportation access. All these factors led Náutico to file a lawsuit to terminate the contract unilaterally and demand millions in unpaid transfers, marking the end of the partnership.

In 2017, after strong support and mobilization by the alvirrubra fan base, extensive renovations began at Estádio dos Aflitos. A new field was laid, the old wire fence was replaced with glass, and the old seats were replaced with more modern ones. Structural upgrades included new emergency exits, improvements to the stadium&#x27;s internal and external areas, new accommodations for players, fans, and the press, and improved lighting. However, capacity was reduced following an inspection by the Fire Department due to areas still needing renovations, especially with the addition of the new glass fence.

In December 2018, the stadium was reopened with a friendly match against Newell&#x27;s Old Boys from Argentina. Náutico won the game by a score of 1–0, with the goal scored by the 17-year-old Thiago. Hours before the friendly with the Argentine team, another friendly match was held in the stadium as a tribute to forward Kuki, with the presence of former Náutico idols such as Geraldo, Beto Acosta, Netinho, Nilson, Nivaldo, Nildo, Batata, Muricy Ramalho, and Thiago Tubarão, among others.

 • 1st game (June 25, 1939): Náutico 5–2 Sport
 • 1st goal (June 25, 1939): Wilson (Náutico)
 • Highest attendance (August 16, 1970): Náutico 1–0 Santa Cruz (31,061 people)
 • Largest victory (July 1, 1945): Náutico 21–3 Flamengo do Recife
 • Highest revenue (December 18, 2018): R$1,576,220 – Náutico vs. Newell&#x27;s Old Boys
 • Capacity: 22,856

== Club Culture ==
=== Supporters ===
The Náutico fan base consists of just over 1 million supporters, with numerous passionate fans spread across the country and even abroad, especially in neighboring northeastern states like Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará, Maranhão, and Alagoas.

The 2010 LANCE IBOPE survey, with a margin of error of only 1.1%, identified approximately 1 million Náutico fans in Brazil, with 885,432 in the Northeast Region and 765,234 in Pernambuco, with high representation among those with higher education.

The 2013 PLURI CONSULTORIA survey, with an error margin of just 0.68%—the lowest in such surveys—identified 1.2 million Náutico fans in Brazil, ranking it as the 18th largest fan base in Brazil and the fifth largest in the Northeast.

One proof of the importance of the fan base for the team is the 85% home match success rate in the 2006 Campeonato Brasileiro Série B—the best performance among the 20 teams—with 16 wins, two draws, and only one loss in the 19 home games, drawing an average of around 10,000 fans per match in that championship. This number rose to about 13,000 in the first division of the 2007 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. By 2009, Náutico had sold a total of 3,083,152 tickets for home games in first-division championships, ranking among the top 20 clubs in Brazil in ticket sales history.

It was among Náutico fans that one of Brazil&#x27;s first barras was formed, called “Alma Alvirrubra”, or “White-and-red soul”. “Alma Alvirrubra” emerged during one of the most challenging times in the club&#x27;s history, right after a loss in the last game of 2005, establishing it as a fan group born from hardship rather than fleeting enthusiasm.

In 2011, playing alongside their fans at Aflitos, Náutico achieved another record: they were the only club nationwide, across all divisions, not to lose a single home game in the Brazilian Championship. With 13 wins and 6 draws, the strong support of the alvirrubra fans was evident once again.

Its main organized fan group, the Torcida Jovem Fanáutico, is the oldest in Pernambuco, having been founded in 1984.

In 2020, a survey by the IBOPE highlighted fan loyalty in Brazil, with Náutico fans standing out as The Most Loyal in the Northeast at 73%, closely aligning with the major clubs in the country and far ahead of others. This is in contrast to other Northeast fan bases, which, like those in the North and Central-West regions, often include “mixed” fans (those who support both a local club and a larger club from the Southeast, or only one club from another region).

=== Rivalries ===
====Clássico dos Clássicos (The Derby of the Derbies)====
Náutico&#x27;s greatest rivalry is with Sport Recife, and their derbies are known as the &quot;Clássico dos Clássicos&quot; (&quot;The Derby of the Derbies&quot;, in Portuguese). Náutico competes with Sport in the oldest and most traditional derby of the North-Northeast region, being the third oldest in Brazil and also the one with the greatest rivalry and balance in Pernambuco: the Clássico dos Clássicos, also known as the Derby Pernambucano and once referred to by the national press as the Northeast Classic,(In the mid-20th century, the BA-VI derby had not yet been consolidated as the biggest rivalry in Bahia.)

The first great classic of the Northeast was also once called the Fla-Flu of the Northeast by the national press due to its relevance in the early second half of the 20th century. The first match between the two teams took place on July 25, 1909, the same year in which the Alvirrubro team took its first steps on the field, facing its first opponents, marking the first-ever victory for Náutico.

==== Clássico das Emoções (The Derby of the emotions) ====

Náutico&#x27;s other local rival is Santa Cruz (1918). The rivalry between the two clubs is known as the &quot;Clássico das Emoções&quot; (&quot;The Derby of the Emotions&quot;). The first Derby took place on June 29, 1917, with Santa Cruz winning 3-0 in a charity tournament match held at the “Campo dos Aflitos,” which at the time belonged to the Liga Sportiva Pernambucana, now the FPF. This field would later become the Estádio dos Aflitos.

The 100th Pernambucan Championship also marked the 500th edition of this clássico, with Santa Cruz winning 5-3. In 1974, Santa Cruz attempted to win their sixth consecutive title but was stopped by Náutico, who became the Pernambucano champion. Náutico maintained their distinction as the only six-time consecutive champion of the tournament after defeating Santa Cruz in both matches of the final.

Despite being very traditional and having a rich history, the Clássico das Emoções has a lesser rivalry compared to the matches between Santa Cruz Futebol Clube and Sport Club do Recife, according to a fan opinion survey among Santa Cruz supporters. The same is said by Náutico fans, who prefer a classic matchup with Sport, as they have a greater rivalry with the rubro-negro team.

=== Timbu Coroado (Crowned Timbu)===
Timbu Coroado is a traditional brazilian carnival block from Recife, founded in 1944, making it the first carnival bloco created by a football club in Pernambuco. An initiative of Clube Náutico Capibaribe, the bloco reflects the strong cultural identity of Pernambuco, blending rhythms such as frevo and maracatu and becoming one of the most traditional in Recife&#x27;s carnival. Currently, it parades on Carnival Sunday through the streets of the Aflitos neighborhood, where Náutico’s social headquarters, the Palacete, is located.

The bloco is known for its irreverence and celebration of popular traditions, with its anthem composed by Nelson Ferreira, one of Pernambuco’s greatest musicians. The name &quot;Timbu Coroado&quot; is a reference to the White-eared opossum known in Pernambuco as Timbu, Náutico’s mascot and club symbol. Staying true to its pioneering spirit, Náutico was the first football club in Pernambuco to create its own carnival bloco, further strengthening its influence on local culture.

More than just a bloco, Timbu Coroado is an extension of Náutico’s history, bringing together fans and revelers in a vibrant celebration of Pernambuco’s roots.

<text>Luis de Onís y González-Vara (4 June 1762 – 17 May 1827) was a career Spanish diplomat who served as Spanish Envoy to the United States from 1809 to 1819, and is remembered for negotiating the cession of Florida to the US in the Adams–Onís Treaty with United States Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, in 1819.

== Biography ==
=== Family and early life ===
Luis de Onís was born in Cantalapiedra, Salamanca on 30 June 1762. He was the son of Joaquin de Onís, a landowner who was probably of noble Asturian origin. Luis received a classical education at home; he began the study of Greek and Latin when he was 8, and by 16, he had concluded his studies in the humanities and law at the University of Salamanca.

=== Early work as an ambassador ===
In 1780, Onís joined his uncle, José de Onís, ambassador of Spain to the Electorate of Saxony in Dresden, Germany, who was known as one of the most accomplished men in politics, science, and belles lettres of the time. Luis joined the legation as his personal secretary and assumed duties as a trade commissioner. In the course of his work, he visited the royal courts of Berlin and Vienna as well as the courts of the other capital cities in Central Europe.

In 1786, when he was 24 years old, Onís was sent on an important mission by the Spanish government, which knew that Saxony had the most highly developed mining industry in Europe and desired to acquire experienced miners to send to its American colonies. He went to study at the School of Mines in Freiberg, a town dominated by the mining and smelting industries, and enrolled in a course taught by the Prussian mineralogist, Professor Abraham Gottlob Werner. Becoming acquainted with operations in the mines, Onís learned of the existence of a surplus of miners looking for employment. Subsequently, the Count of Floridablanca decided to entrust the mission to the young man. He met with a diplomatic minister of Saxony, who was prepared to reject his request, but he was so impressed by the young man&#x27;s knowledge of the pertinent facts and the force of his arguments that he agreed to his request and allowed him to choose thirty-six miners, including six managers, to send to Spain. In recognition of Onis&#x27;s success, the Count proposed to appoint him as a minister to the United States, a promotion that he could not then accept.

In 1792, Onís was decorated with the Cross of Charles III of Spain (&quot;Cruz de Carlos III&quot;). In 1798, he returned to Spain, where he was appointed to a position in the office of the First Secretary of State (&quot;Primer Secretaría de Estado&quot;) in Madrid, being responsible for conducting negotiations with France. In April 1802, he took an active part in the negotiations for and the conclusion of the Treaty of Amiens and, in October, he was granted the customary perks of a &quot;secretary to the King&quot; (&quot;Secretario del rey&quot;), including a house and an expense account.

Following Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s invasion of Spain in 1808 and with the impending abdication of Ferdinand VII, the remnant of the royal government moved to Seville, where Onís continued in his capacity as longest-serving senior officer of the Ministry. He soon received a proposal to lead a diplomatic mission to St. Petersburg, and then a designation to Sweden, neither of which came to pass. Finally, the Junta Central (the anti-French Spanish Government fighting Napoleon&#x27;s brother, Joseph Bonaparte, now king of Spain as José I), decided to send him to the United States.

=== Ambassador to the United States ===

On 29 June 1809, Onís was appointed minister plenipotentiary (with full powers to take independent action) to the United States, his letter of appointment instructing him to embark as soon as possible for New York. His assignment was to ensure peace between the two nations and win formal recognition of Fernando VII as the legitimate ruler of Spain. He was to negotiate all points in dispute within certain defined limits; to encourage the loyalty of Spain&#x27;s colonies in the New World; to buy supplies, armaments, and ships for Spain to use in its war against the French; and to counter Bonapartist propaganda in the US. He was to pursue these objectives despite the refusal of President James Madison to recognize him while the Peninsular War still raged in Europe. Arriving at the port of New York on 4 October 1809 aboard the Spanish frigate &quot;Cornelia&quot;, after a rough passage of 44 days, Onís requested an audience to present his credentials to President Madison but was promptly informed that the US government could not receive or recognize any minister from the provisional governments of Spain as long as the crown was in dispute and that until that question was resolved, the United States would remain neutral.

Consequently, no member of the Cabinet would recognize him or enter into any official communication with him. The United States did not officially recognize Onís as ambassador until December 1815, all the while asserting that political considerations obliged it to remain neutral until the conclusion of the war in Spain despite assurances of support for the cause of Spanish independence by Madison.

Soon after his arrival in the United States, Onís took up residence in Philadelphia, where he used the officially recognized consular office to run a shadow legation and worked tirelessly against attempts by the United States to penetrate into Florida, as well as its covert support for French agents moving to infiltrate the Spanish provinces. He paid special attention to the activities of Spanish and Latin American revolutionary agents, who sought to exploit the sympathy that American citizens felt for Spain&#x27;s rebelling colonies in South America. Secretary of State James Monroe rejected his written protests but clandestinely lent his support to insurgent movements led by filibusterers and irregular American forces. The occupation of West Florida in 1810 was the culmination of a prolonged series of events over the course of several years, as a consequence of the indeterminacy of the border between Florida and Louisiana Purchase when France ceded it to Spain in 1763. At the start of the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain, the danger of invasion of East Florida, a territory that had never been in dispute, escalated and was a constant subject of concern in Onís&#x27;s correspondence with Monroe. The US government finally officially recognized Onís as Ambassador of Spain, and he presented his credentials on December 20, 1815, five years after his arrival in New York. Thereafter, he continued asserting the Spanish arguments with his customary vigor.

Monroe, meanwhile, sent an ambassador to Madrid, John Erving, who was snubbed by the Spanish Secretary of State, Pedro Cevallos, and had to wait several months for formal recognition of Onís&#x27;s ambassadorship to the United States. Cevallos opposed making any significant concessions to secure a treaty and endeavored to buy more time for Spain with the mere appearance of negotiations. Cevallos transferred consultations from Madrid to Washington and ensured further delays by sending Onís the necessary powers but no instructions to proceed. Resisting American pressure to begin negotiations in earnest, Onís tried to delay official recognition by Madrid of the US embassy through various subterfuges, such as maneuvering for the replacement of Cevallos, which occurred on 30 October 1816.

During his years in the United States, Onís published several pamphlets critical of its government under the pseudonym &quot;Verus&quot; (Latin: &quot;True&quot;). He advised the Viceroy of New Spain (Mexico), Francisco Javier Venegas, and the Governor of Cuba, the Marqués de Someruelos, of the expansionist ambitions of the growing young nation. During the Mexican War of Independence, he maintained a network of spies to prevent contact between the rebels and potential allies in the United States. The network was particularly active in the fight against the so-called &quot;insurgent corsairs,&quot; many of them French privateers, who placed themselves at the service of the nascent republics of Spanish America.

=== Adams–Onís treaty ===

The Adams–Onís treaty was signed on 22 February 1819 after two years of difficult negotiations and the intervention of the French ambassador Hyde de Neuville, who defended the Spanish position against the radicalism of Henry Clay in the United States Congress, and General Andrew Jackson, who was notoriously hostile to the Spanish presence in East Florida.

Ratification of the treaty had been postponed for two years since Spain wanted to use it as an incentive to keep the United States from lending diplomatic support to the revolutionaries in South America. As soon as the treaty was signed, the US Senate ratified it unanimously; but because of Spain&#x27;s stalling, a new ratification was necessary and this time there were objections. Clay and other western spokesmen demanded that Spain also give up Texas, but that proposal was defeated by the Senate, which ratified the treaty a second time on 19 February 1821, following ratification by Spain on 24 October 1820. Ratifications were exchanged three days later and the treaty was proclaimed on 22 February 1821, two years after its signing.

The treaty consisted of 16 articles, half of which settled issues that had been in dispute since 1783, ceding all the lands of the Spanish Crown located east of the Mississippi, known as the Floridas, to the United States. Settling the most serious point of contention, determining the borders to the west and northwest of the Mississippi, was delayed until the last moment, as Onís aimed at all costs to keep Texas, New Mexico and California under the dominion of Spain.

The signing of the treaty received a surprisingly favorable response from the public and the United States Senate. Onís returned to Europe, convinced that the alternative to signing the treaty would have been the loss of all Spanish territories as far west as the boundaries of the Rio Grande and parts of the interior provinces (&quot;Provincias Internas&quot;) of New Spain.

The Adams–Onís Treaty closed the first era of United States expansion by providing for the cession of East Florida; the abandonment of the controversy over West Florida (a portion of which had been seized by the United States); and the delineating of a boundary with the Spanish province of Mexico that clearly made Spanish Texas a part of Mexico, thus ending much of the vagueness in the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase. Spain also ceded, to the US, its claims to the Oregon Country. For Spain, it meant that it kept Texas and retained a buffer zone between its Californian and New Mexican possessions and the territories of the United States.

In 1820 Onís published a 152-page memoir on the diplomatic negotiation. It was translated from Spanish to English by US diplomatic commission secretary, Tobias Watkins, and republished in 1821 in the US.

=== Honors and last years ===
In 1818, the Spanish Cortes conferred on Onís the title of &quot;Regidor perpetuo de Salamanca&quot; (Perpetual alderman of Salamanca), a title that passed to his descendants in the male line. In mid-1819, Onís was awarded the &quot;Gran Cruz Americana&quot; (American Grand Cross) and the honors of &quot;Consejero de Estado&quot; (Councilor of State) and was appointed minister to St. Petersburg. The revolution of 1820, however, prevented his assuming this office. The new constitutional government revoked the appointment and instead assigned him to the embassy in Naples. The same year, he published a work in two volumes, entitled &quot;Memoria sobre las Negociaciones entre España y los Estados Unidos de América&quot; (Memoir Upon the Negotiations between Spain and the United States of America), a memoir of his role in the negotiations leading to the Treaty of 1819. His last diplomatic mission sent him to London in February 1821, where he participated in diplomatic consultations for the recognition of Hispanic American countries by the United States and managed to prevent the European powers from following the US example. In November 1822, Onís returned to Madrid, where he died on 17 May 1827, after an illness of four days.

<doc id="604585" wikidata="Q331202" url="?curid=604585" title="Stripped (Christina Aguilera album)">
<text>Stripped is the fourth studio album by American singer Christina Aguilera. It was released on October 22, 2002, by RCA Records. Looking to transition from the teen pop styles of her self-titled debut album (1999), Aguilera took creative control over &quot;Stripped&quot;, both musically and lyrically. She also changed her public image and established her alter ego Xtina. Musically, the record incorporates pop and R&amp;B with influences from many different genres, including soul, rock, hip hop, and Latin music. Lyrically, most of the album&#x27;s songs discuss the theme of self-respect, while a few other songs talk about love, sex and feminism. As an executive producer, Aguilera enlisted numerous new collaborators for the album.

Upon its release, &quot;Stripped&quot; received polarised reviews from music critics; many criticized its lack of musical focus, while some of them called it &quot;almost&quot; an album for grown-ups, with comparisons made to Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson. Commercially, &quot;Stripped&quot; debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 330,000 copies. It was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping over five million copies in the United States. The album also charted within the top five of charts in Canada, the Netherlands, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It is Aguilera&#x27;s best-performing album in the United Kingdom, becoming the 29th and 40th bestselling album of the decade and millennium there, respectively, with two million copies sold. Despite its initial critical reception, &quot;Stripped&quot; and its singles received four Grammy Award nominations, including one win, and has since gone on to receive critical praise. The album has sold over 12 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century.

Five singles were released from the album. The lead single &quot;Dirrty&quot; was met with criticism and controversy due to its sexual music video but was an international hit on the charts. The follow-up &quot;Beautiful&quot; was praised by critics and garnered chart success worldwide. The last three singles, &quot;Fighter&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Us Down&quot; and &quot;The Voice Within&quot;, became top-ten hits in various countries. Aguilera performed several songs from &quot;Stripped&quot; live during a number of shows, notably during the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards, the American Music Awards of 2003 (January), and the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. Two concert tours were held in 2003 to promote the album, The Justified &amp; Stripped Tour (co-headlined with Justin Timberlake) and The Stripped Tour.

==Background and development==

Following the release of her self-titled debut album in 1999, Aguilera had achieved major success with four worldwide hits, including &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; and &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot;. Following that, she continued to garner major success with &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; (2001) – a cover of Labelle&#x27;s song of the same title – which features Lil&#x27; Kim, Pink and Mýa. Despite the international success, Aguilera was unsatisfied with the music and image that her former manager Steve Kurtz, had created for her, having been marketed as a bubblegum pop singer because of the genre&#x27;s financial lure. She mentioned plans for her next album to have more musical and lyrical depth.

By late 2000, Aguilera decided not to continue the contact with Kurtz. After terminating Kurtz&#x27;s services, Irving Azoff was hired as her new manager. Following the managerial shakeup, Aguilera decided to create her new style of music on the following album. She also used her new alter ego Xtina. She also changed her public appearance and persona, with her hair dyed black and nude photographs on magazine covers. Aguilera further commented about the event with &quot;USA Today&quot;: &quot;When you&#x27;re part of a pop phenomenon, you have so many opinions shoved down your throat. People try to tell you what you should do, how you should act, what you should wear, who you should be with. At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn&#x27;t speak to me, because it&#x27;s so boring and superficial&quot;.

==Recording and production==
In late 2001, Aguilera started recording material for her fourth studio album. The recording sessions took place in studios around California and New York City, including Electric Lady Studios and The Hit Factory in New York City, The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, and Conway Recording Studios, Record Plant and NRG Recording Studios in Los Angeles. According to Aguilera, the recording sessions were much longer than she thought they would be. She further explained that many issues arose during that time, including her first breakup with her first boyfriend Jorge Santos. Aguilera also believed that the lyrics of &quot;Stripped&quot; were so personal, and her vocals &quot;represent a rawer, more bare-bones approach as well, with less of the ostentatious riffing that has miffed critics in the past&quot;. She stated, &quot;I did the vocal gymnastics thing because it was fun. That&#x27;s why I like blues, too, because you can experiment more with that side of your voice. But I thought the lyrics on this record are so personal, deep and good that I wanted to make them stand out more than what I could do with my voice technically&quot;.

On &quot;Stripped&quot;, Aguilera enlisted a wide range of songwriters and producers, including Alicia Keys, Scott Storch, and Linda Perry. Perry was one of the biggest influences to Aguilera during the making of the album. The singer stated, &quot;She taught me that imperfections are good and should be kept because it comes from the heart. It makes things more believable and it&#x27;s brave to share them with the world.&quot; Keys joined on the track &quot;Impossible&quot;, which was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. Another notable producer is Storch; he wrote and produced a total of seven songs from &quot;Stripped&quot;, including two singles. He stated that during the making of &quot;Stripped&quot;, Aguilera was one of his friends that he cared most. However, Storch did not produce her fifth studio album &quot;Back to Basics&quot; (2006), which started a feud between the two artists, which was stated by Aguilera in one of the track from &quot;Back to Basics&quot;, &quot;F.U.S.S. (Interlude)&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
Musically, &quot;Stripped&quot; is a pop and R&amp;B record which incorporates elements of many different genres, including soul, hip hop, heavy metal, rock, rock and roll, gospel, and Latin. The album broke her teen pop root from her self-titled debut studio album (1999). According to Aguilera, she wanted to be &quot;real&quot; in her next records because she was &quot;overworked&quot; at the time she was &quot;a part of the big craze pop phenomenon&quot;. Multiple critics criticized its musical style, calling it a lack of musical concentration. On &quot;Stripped&quot;, Aguilera became the writer of most of the songs. She also revealed that Perry&#x27;s songwriting on Pink&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Missundaztood&quot; (2001) inspired Aguilera a lot. She further commented: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the Dallas Austin songs, but I really, really loved the Linda Perry song&quot;.
The album&#x27;s opening track &quot;Stripped Intro&quot; describes her musical changes as she sings: &quot;Sorry that I speak my mind / Sorry don&#x27;t do what I&#x27;m told&quot;. The follow-up &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Us Down&quot; featuring Lil&#x27; Kim is an R&amp;B and hip hop song which incorporates elements from dancehall toward its end. Lyrically, it talks about the theme of feminism, and was suggested that it is toward rapper Eminem and Fred Durst. The third track &quot;Walk Away&quot; is a piano ballad where she uses a &quot;clever&quot; metaphor to talk about an abusive relationship. &quot;Dotmusic&quot; editor Ian Watson comapared it to Liza Minnelli&#x27;s songs. It is followed by the fourth track and third single from &quot;Stripped&quot;, &quot;Fighter&quot;, which incorporates strong elements from heavy metal and arena rock. It talks about a woman wants to thank a man who has done something wrong to her, and was inspired by Aguilera&#x27;s unhappy childhood. It is followed-up by the interlude &quot;Primer Amor Interlude&quot;, the Latin pop and flamenco track &quot;Infatuation&quot;, and the interlude &quot;Loves Embrace Interlude&quot;, respectively.

&quot;Loving Me 4 Me&quot; is a &quot;sultry&quot; classic R&amp;B and neo soul ballad. The follow-ups &quot;Impossible&quot; and &quot;Underappreciated&quot; explore jazz and funk. The first of these incorporates a piano theme performed by Keys, while the second talks about the pain of a breakup. The piano ballad &quot;Beautiful&quot;, which talks about the theme of self-respect, was deemed as the album&#x27;s highlight by many critics, who praised its overall production. The next track &quot;Make Over&quot; is a salsa and dance-rock song that features a garage-rock beat. It was sued in the United Kingdom for illegally sampling the Sugababes&#x27; song &quot;Overload&quot; (2000), &quot;The Guardian&quot; also noted similarities between the two songs. Later, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) added the songwriting credits of Sugababes to the song. &quot;Cruz&quot; is a rock ballad that is musically similar to works of Michael Bolton. &quot;Soar&quot; is one of two tracks written for &quot;Stripped&quot; by Rob Hoffman and Heather Holley centered around themes of self-empowerment. The second track &quot;I Will Be&quot; is the B-side to &quot;Dirrty&quot; in the UK. The two next tracks, &quot;Get Mine, Get Yours&quot;, an R&amp;B song, and &quot;Dirrty&quot;, a R&amp;B-leaning hip hop anthem talks about the theme of sexual intercourse, and have been described as &quot;majestically filthy&quot;. The latter is the remake of Redman&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Dirty (I Can&#x27;t Get in da Club)&quot; (2001), and also features the rapper. The follow-up is the interlude &quot;Stripped Pt. 2&quot;. The empowering ballad &quot;The Voice Within&quot; talks about trusting oneself. &quot;I&#x27;m OK&quot; is a ballad which incorporates strings and discusses Aguilera&#x27;s abusive childhood with her father, and the final song from the album &quot;Keep on Singin&#x27; My Song&quot; incorporates elements from drum and bass with a gospel choir.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Stripped&quot; was first released internationally on October 22, 2002 and in the United States a week later by RCA Records. Promotion for &quot;Stripped&quot; started on October 28, when Aguilera appeared at a Chicago radio station B96&#x27;s Halloween Bash and performed four songs from the album–&quot;Dirrty&quot;, &quot;Get Mine, Get Yours&quot;, &quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Impossible&quot;. The same day, Aguilera performed &quot;Beautiful&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, wearing a black gown, a black fedora, and black heels. She also performed &quot;Dirrty&quot; and &quot;Beautiful&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;; the show aired in October. On November 1, Aguilera appeared on &quot;Today&quot; and performed &quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Impossible&quot;. On November 4, Aguilera was invited as a guest on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; to promote &quot;Stripped&quot;. At the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards on November 14, Aguilera performed &quot;Dirrty&quot; with rapper Redman, recreating the stage as a boxing ring while entering the stage riding a motorcycle and wearing chaps during the performance, as seen in the music video for the song. On December 15, she performed &quot;Dirrty&quot; at the 2002 VH1 Awards. On January 13, 2003, Aguilera performed &quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Impossible&quot; at the American Music Awards of 2003 (January). Aguilera gave a performance of &quot;Beautiful&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on March 15, where she also sang &quot;Fighter&quot;. At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards on August 23, Aguilera performed with Madonna, Britney Spears and Missy Elliott a medley of Madonna&#x27;s songs &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot;, and Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Work It&quot;. Towards the end of &quot;Hollywood&quot;, Madonna kissed both Aguilera and Spears during the performance, making huge tabloid stories and fuss from the public, and marking it as one of the most iconic performances from the MTV Video Music Awards history. Later that night, she also performed &quot;Dirrty&quot; and &quot;Fighter&quot; with Redman and guitarist Dave Navarro. On January 16, 2004, she performed &quot;Walk Away&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. On February 8, Aguilera performed &quot;Beautiful&quot; at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, where she also won a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the song.

Aguilera also supported &quot;Stripped&quot; by embarking on two separate tours. In summer 2003, Justin Timberlake and Aguilera embarked on The Justified &amp; Stripped Tour, which took place in North America. Talking about the tour, Timberlake said &quot;[Aguilera]&#x27;s got one of the most amazing voices I&#x27;ve ever heard. That homegirl can sing ... this is why I am standing here&quot;. Several tour dates were canceled and rescheduled due to the collapse of lighting systems. An extended play entitled &quot;Justin &amp; Christina&quot; was released exclusively at Target in July 2003 to promote the tour. The EP contains four remixes of Aguilera and Timberlake&#x27;s songs from their respective albums, and two new tracks. In late 2003, Aguilera embarked on The Stripped Tour, the former&#x27;s extension without Timberlake&#x27;s acts. The tour took place in Europe, Japan and Australia. The former grossed a total of US$30,261,670, becoming the 16th highest-grossing tour of 2003. In May 2004, Aguilera was expected to return to North America during the second leg of The Stripped Tour. However, the 29 tour dates were canceled last-minute due to the singer&#x27;s vocal strain. On January 13, an accompanying live video album of the tour, titled &quot;Stripped Live in the UK&quot;, was released worldwide. On December 8, a compilation album including both &quot;Stripped&quot; and &quot;Stripped Live in the UK&quot; was released in the United Kingdom.

===20th anniversary===
On October 21, 2022, for the album&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, Aguilera released a deluxe edition of the album with two additional tracks: &quot;I Will Be&quot; (the b-side to &quot;Dirrty&quot;) and the Benny Benassi remix of &quot;Beautiful&quot;. This was announced alongside new vinyl releases, HD remasters for music videos and a new music video for &quot;Beautiful&quot; which premiered on October 19, 2022.

== Singles ==
&quot;Dirrty&quot; was serviced as the lead single from the album on September 3, 2002. Perry and Aguilera&#x27;s management wanted to release &quot;Beautiful&quot; as the lead single. However, Aguilera wanted to release a seriously &quot;down and dirty&quot; song to announce her comeback, so RCA Records decided to release it as the first single. Upon its release, the song received mixed reviews from critics; some of whom criticized its sound and negatively compared it to Britney Spears&#x27; song &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot; (2001), while the others chose it as a standout track from &quot;Stripped&quot;. Its accompanying music video, directed by David LaChapelle, was criticized due to its sexual content, and sparked protests in Thailand. However, it was an international hit, achieving certifications in Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Beautiful&quot; was written solely by Perry. Rush-released following the commercial underperformance and controversy surrounding previous single &quot;Dirrty&quot;, &quot;Beautiful&quot; received universal acclaim from music critics. Commercially, the single gained impact on charts worldwide, peaking within the top five in many countries, as well as achieving certifications in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Its music video, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, garnered critical acclaim from media outlets by touching on anorexia nervosa, homosexuality, bullying, self-esteem, and transgender issues. The video was honored at the 14th GLAAD Media Awards (2003) due to its positive portrayal of the LGBT community. &quot;Beautiful&quot; was listed as one of the greatest songs throughout the 2000s decade by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and VH1.

&quot;Fighter&quot; was released as the third single from &quot;Stripped&quot; on March 10, 2003. The single was well received by most critics, as well as achieving chart success in several countries and certifications in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. Its accompanying music video, directed by Floria Sigismondi, was inspired by the director&#x27;s dark theatrics and moths.

The album&#x27;s fourth single &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Us Down&quot;, featuring Lil&#x27; Kim, was released on July 8, 2003. It garnered mixed reviews from music critics, and gained moderate success commercially, receiving a gold certification in Australia. Its accompanying music video was directed by LaChapelle.

&quot;The Voice Within&quot; was released on October 27, 2003 as the fifth and final single. Critics complimented the simple piano ballad, which talks about the theme of self-respect. Its accompanying music video was directed by LaChapelle.

&quot;Infatuation&quot; was released as a promotional single in Spain on September 22, 2003. &quot;Walk Away&quot; peaked at number 35 in Denmark on March 14, 2008, despite never being released as a single.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Stripped&quot; received mixed reviews upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 55, based on 14 reviews. &quot;Billboard&quot; was positive toward the album, writing that the album is &quot;a must-heard recording rich with pleasantly surprising depth&quot;. In a mixed review, &quot;E! Online&quot; wrote, &quot;If she had just shown up and sang her ass off, &quot;Stripped&quot; would&#x27;ve been a better show&quot;. However, the site also complimented &quot;Beautiful&quot;, adding that &quot;she [Aguilera] has still got better pipes than Britney&quot;. Josh Kun from &quot;Spin&quot; commented, &quot;As an artistic statement, &quot;Stripped&quot; is all over the place; it&#x27;s a move toward hip-hop, it&#x27;s a move toward rock, it&#x27;s ghetto, it&#x27;s Disney&quot;.

Jancee Dunn of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; provided a three-out-of-five-stars rating for the album, calling it &quot;almost&quot; an album for grown-ups, yet criticized its lack of musical concentration. In contrast, &quot;CDNow&quot; opined that &quot;as a pop record, &quot;Stripped&quot; is practically flawless&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot; wrote a mixed review, yet commenting that it is better than Britney Spears&#x27; works. Writing for BBC Music, Jacqueline Hodges said that the album &quot;is as full-on bold and over the top as most of Christina&#x27;s outfits ... much of this seems to be an exercise in stretching the vocal chords [&quot;sic&quot;] to weak backing tracks&quot;. Rob O&#x27;Connor from &quot;Yahoo! Music&quot; called the album &quot;sophisticated&quot;, noting that is &quot;includes actual artistic input from the artist herself&quot;, which, he thought, was &quot;a wonder in these modern times&quot;. Jim Wirth for &quot;NME&quot; commented that &quot;Stripped&quot; is a &quot;Mariah Carey album&quot; comparing it to Carey&#x27;s 1999 &quot;Rainbow&quot;. Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; commented that the album is &quot;so overproduced and overwrought that it could easily pass for a Janet album&quot;.

&quot;Dotmusic&quot;&#x27;s Ian Watson gave the album a high score (eight out of ten points), and commented, &quot;Forget all you know about Christina Aguilera. She&#x27;s discovered sex, rebellion, rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll and, at one amazing instant, drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass.&quot; He also added that Aguilera&#x27;s voice &quot;can shatter planets&quot;. In a negative review, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; criticized the album as a &quot;nü-Mariah on mood stabilizers, extended with pseudo-pastiches of semi-popular songs&quot;. Todd Burns for &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; was also negative toward the album, giving it an &quot;F&quot; score and wrote: &quot;in between ten to twelve mediocre/good songs, we have eight to ten songs that would be better served as B-sides&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; provided a two-out-of-five-stars rating and commented that &quot;Sadly, bra-burning rhetoric and gospel warbling make poor substitutes for addictive songs&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine also wrote a negative review, commenting that the album is &quot;the sound of an artist who was given too much freedom too early and has no idea what to do with it&quot;, although later he changed his opinion, giving it a higher score (four stars out of five possible). Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jon Pareles commented that &quot;Stripped&quot; &quot;is a blast of excess that risks alienating Ms. Aguilera&#x27;s old fans without luring new ones, and it&#x27;s bursting with misguided energy&quot;.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Stripped&quot; became one of Aguilera&#x27;s strongest charting albums. In the United States, the album became the tenth bestselling album of 2003, and Aguilera was ranked as the most successful female pop artist of the year with six chart entries. Aguilera was the fourth most successful female musical act on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and the thirteenth overall. The magazine ranked Aguilera as the second bestselling female singles artist on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, only behind Beyoncé, and the top female Mainstream Top 40 artist. In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; named &quot;Stripped&quot; as one of the most important albums of the 2000s, noting the cultural and sonic influence the album had on artists including Rihanna, Demi Lovato, Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande. They noted that:Ultimately, Christina defining herself as &quot;Stripped&quot; was not an ode to her sexually empowered image, but representative of her peeling back layers and getting to the music and emotions that make up the vocal powerhouse as a human, including all her darkness, fears and insecurities.

Selena Gomez cited &quot;Stripped&quot; as an inspiration for her second studio album &quot;Revival&quot; (2015), saying: &quot;That&#x27;s one of my favorite albums and that was kind of what I started off &quot;Revival&quot; as, some sort of story. I mean, that album for her was incredible — &#x27;Beautiful&#x27;, &#x27;Can&#x27;t Hold Us Down&#x27;, all of that — that&#x27;s the stuff that I love&quot;. In an interview with &quot;People&quot;, Demi Lovato said that their album &quot;Tell Me You Love Me&quot; (2017) was inspired by &quot;Stripped&quot;. They stated that they &quot;grew up listening to Christina Aguilera&quot; and explained that they were &quot;inspired by the black and white artwork&quot;. Charli XCX named &quot;Stripped&quot; &quot;one of my favourite albums ever&quot;. Sabrina Carpenter has also stated that after she heard the album, she &quot;knew that [she] wanted to sing&quot; and she began to see &quot;songs as a part of what [she] could do to showcase and develop [her] own voice&quot;. The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. Justin Myers of the Official Charts Company called the album &quot;a phenomenon&quot;.

Despite the heavy criticism received upon release, &quot;Stripped&quot; has gone on to earn acclaim. The album&#x27;s fifteenth anniversary in 2017 saw several critics reevaluate the album in a more positive light. &quot;Vice&quot; writer Sophie Wilkinson stated in a retrospective review, &quot;Say what you like about the flailing &#x27;Dirrty&#x27; dance routines it spawned, but Christina Aguilera&#x27;s sophomore album &quot;Stripped&quot; still has merits beyond the cliché of a former teen star removing her saccharine casing to reveal her womanhood&quot;. She added that the album relayed feministic messages and that &quot;15 years on, the album still gives any woman the confidence to speak up and be heard, to take charge of her sexuality and ownership of her body, or even just sing along loud enough to amplify its messages&quot;. In a &quot;Billboard&quot; article, Jeff Benjamin praised Aguilera for her feminist sentiment on the album&#x27;s second track and fourth single &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Us Down&quot;, while maintaining an openly sexual image, noting that it was not expected of feminists to be sexual at the time of the album&#x27;s release. Benjamin also praised the album&#x27;s ability to shift between genres and the personal content featured. He went on to say that Aguilera was continuing the legacy that &quot;Aguilera helped build after the likes of Donna Summer, Madonna and Cher&quot;.&quot;&quot; The Fader named it one of the greatest, most &quot;crucial&quot; albums recorded by women.

&quot;HuffPost&quot; noted that with &quot;Stripped&quot;, Aguilera led the charge at the beginning of the 21st century in influencing and introducing the next generation feminist rhetoric into pop culture. In 2018, the enduring impact of &quot;Stripped&quot; was noted by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and several other pop media outlets including Fuse, Genius and Vinyl with consensus; &quot;&quot;Stripped&quot; proves as the blueprint for honest and raw female pop&quot;. &quot;Crack&quot; writer Emma Garland wrote that the album &quot;is best measured by its cultural impact on those it was always intended for – a mass audience of young people who [...] had spent much of the late 90&#x27;s and early 00&#x27;s being patronised by an industry that served them dynamic but spiritually void bubblegum pop washed down with empowerment slogans from the Spice Girls&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; editor Kimberley Hill named &quot;Stripped&quot; &quot;one of 2002’s most intelligent and successful outings and among its most controversial, too&quot;, and praised the album for &quot;tackling once-taboo subjects such as casual sex, infidelity, misogyny, feminism, and domestic violence&quot;.

<text>Each county or unitary authority in the United Kingdom maintains a sites and monuments record or SMR, consisting of a list of known archaeological sites. Many SMRs are now developing into much broader historic environment records (HERs), including information on historic buildings and designed landscapes. Each record lists the location, type and period of site, along with a brief description and information on the location of more detailed sources of information such as site reports. This information is most commonly used to help inform decisions on the likelihood of new development affecting archaeological deposits. Government guidance (PPG 16 and SPP in Scotland) requires local authorities to consider archaeology a material consideration in determining planning applications and the SMR aids this consideration.

While mentioned in guidance, there is no statutory requirement for local authorities to fund an SMR (although this was a provision in the England and Wales Heritage Protection Bill) and there is great variety in implementation across the UK. Some SMRs are simple card indexes, others are command line Unix databases and others are more modern and GIS-based. They provide an enormously useful resource but are not always fully exploited or appreciated by the public. Efforts to place SMRs on-line have met with success in certain parts of Britain, although some archaeologists have voiced concern that making vulnerable sites better known to the public endangers them further, especially through illicit metal-detecting. The contrary argument is that informing the public of historic sites near them will in fact increase protection, as local people will take pride in their cultural heritage and seek to protect it. In 2007, an updated version of best practice guidance for HERs &quot;Informing the Future of the Past: Guidelines for Historic Environment Records&quot; has been made available on-line.

Members of the public can usually consult their local SMR, or request a search be undertaken on their behalf, and they are commonly used by local historians, archaeological organisations and academics. An increasing number of SMRs and HERs are becoming available to search on-line, in England particularly via the Heritage Gateway. In Scotland, the PASTMAP website presents comprehensive national datasets on monuments, buildings, gardens and designed landscapes, wrecks, and an increasing number of local records.

<text>Beamish Museum is the first regional open-air museum, in England, located at Beamish, near the town of Stanley, in County Durham, England. Beamish pioneered the concept of a living museum. By displaying duplicates or replaceable items, it was also an early example of the now commonplace practice of museums allowing visitors to touch objects.

The museum&#x27;s guiding principle is to preserve an example of everyday life in urban and rural North East England at the climax of industrialisation in the early 20th century. Much of the restoration and interpretation is specific to the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, together with portions of countryside under the influence of Industrial Revolution from 1825. On its estate it uses a mixture of translocated, original and replica buildings, a large collection of artefacts, working vehicles and equipment, as well as livestock and costumed interpreters.

The museum has received a number of awards since it opened to visitors in 1972 and has influenced other living museums. It is an educational resource, and also helps to preserve some traditional and rare north-country livestock breeds.

==History==

=== Genesis ===
In 1958, days after starting as director of the Bowes Museum, inspired by Scandinavian folk museums, and realising the North East&#x27;s traditional industries and communities were disappearing, Frank Atkinson presented a report to Durham County Council urging that a collection of items of everyday history on a large scale should begin as soon as possible, so that eventually an open air museum could be established. As well as objects, Atkinson was also aiming to preserve the region&#x27;s customs and dialect. He stated the new museum should &quot;attempt to make the history of the region live&quot; and illustrate the way of life of ordinary people. He hoped the museum would be run by, be about and exist for the local populace, desiring them to see the museum as theirs, featuring items collected from them.

Fearing it was now almost too late, Atkinson adopted a policy of &quot;unselective collecting&quot; — &quot;you offer it to us and we will collect it.&quot; Donations ranged in size from small items to locomotives and shops, and Atkinson initially took advantage of a surplus of space available in the 19th-century French chateau-style building housing the Bowes Museum to store items donated for the open air museum. With this space soon filled, a former British Army tank depot at Brancepeth was taken over, although in just a short time its entire complement of 22 huts and hangars had been filled, too.

In 1966, a working party was established to set up a museum &quot;for the purpose of studying, collecting, preserving and exhibiting buildings, machinery, objects and information illustrating the development of industry and the way of life of the north of England&quot;, and it selected Beamish Hall, having been vacated by the National Coal Board, as a suitable location.

=== Establishment and expansion ===
In August 1970, with Atkinson appointed as its first full-time director together with three staff members, the museum was first established by moving some of the collections into the hall. In 1971, an introductory exhibition, &quot;Museum in the Making&quot; opened at the hall.

The museum was opened to visitors on its current site for the first time in 1972, with the first translocated buildings (the railway station and colliery winding engine) being erected the following year. The first trams began operating on a short demonstration line in 1973. The Town station was formally opened in 1976, the same year the reconstruction of the colliery winding engine house was completed, and the miners&#x27; cottages were relocated. Opening of the drift mine as an exhibit followed in 1979.

In 1975 the museum was visited by the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and by Anne, Princess Royal, in 2002. In 2006, as the Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England, The Duke of Kent visited, to open the town masonic lodge.

With the Co-op having opened in 1984, the town area was officially opened in 1985. The pub had opened in the same year, with Ravensworth Terrace having been reconstructed from 1980 to 1985. The newspaper branch office had also been built in the mid-1980s. Elsewhere, the farm on the west side of the site (which became Home Farm) opened in 1983. The present arrangement of visitors entering from the south was introduced in 1986.

At the beginning of the 1990s, further developments in the Pit Village were opened, the chapel in 1990, and the board school in 1992. The whole tram circle was in operation by 1993. Further additions to the Town came in 1994 with the opening of the sweet shop and motor garage, followed by the bank in 1999. The first Georgian component of the museum arrived when Pockerley Old Hall opened in 1995, followed by the Pockerley Waggonway in 2001.

In the early 2000s two large modern buildings were added, to augment the museum&#x27;s operations and storage capacity - the Regional Resource Centre on the west side opened in 2001, followed by the Regional Museums Store next to the railway station in 2002. Due to its proximity, the latter has been cosmetically presented as &quot;Beamish Waggon and Iron Works&quot;. Additions to display areas came in the form of the Masonic lodge (2006) and the Lamp Cabin in the Colliery (2009). In 2010, the entrance building and tea rooms were refurbished.

Into the 2010s, further buildings were added - the fish and chip shop (opened 2011) band hall (opened 2013) and pit pony stables (built 2013/14) in the Pit Village, plus a bakery (opened 2013) and chemist and photographers (opened 2016) being added to the town. St Helen&#x27;s Church, in the Georgian landscape, opened in November 2015.

=== Remaking Beamish===

A major development, named &#x27;Remaking Beamish&#x27;, was approved by Durham County Council in April 2016, with £10.7m having been raised from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £3.3m from other sources.

As of September 2022, new exhibits as part of this project have included a quilter&#x27;s cottage, a welfare hall, 1950s terrace, recreation park, bus depot, and 1950s farm (all discussed in the relevant sections of this article). The coming years will see replicas of aged miners&#x27; homes from South Shields, a cinema from Ryhope, and social housing will feature a block of four relocated Airey houses, prefabricated concrete homes originally designed by Sir Edwin Airey, which previously stood in Kibblesworth. Then-recently vacated and due for demolition, they were instead offered to the museum by The Gateshead Housing Company and accepted in 2012.

== Museum site ==
The approximately current site, once belonging to the Eden and Shafto families, is a basin-shaped steep-sided valley with woodland areas, a river, some level ground and a south-facing aspect.

Visitors enter the site through an entrance arch formed by a steam hammer, across a former opencast mining site and through a converted stable block (from Greencroft, near Lanchester, County Durham).

Visitors can navigate the site via assorted marked footpaths, including adjacent (or near to) the entire tramway oval. According to the museum, it takes 20 minutes to walk at a relaxed pace from the entrance to the town. The tramway oval serves as both an exhibit and as a free means of transport around the site for visitors, with stops at the entrance (south), Home Farm (west), Pockerley (east) and the Town (north). Visitors can also use the museum&#x27;s buses as a free form of transport between various parts of the museum. Although visitors can also ride on the Town railway and Pockerley Waggonway, these do not form part of the site&#x27;s transport system (as they start and finish from the same platforms).

== Governance ==
Beamish was the first English museum to be financed and administered by a consortium of county councils (Cleveland, Durham, Northumberland and Tyne and Wear) The museum is now operated as a registered charity, but continues to receive support from local authorities - Durham County Council, Sunderland City Council, Gateshead Council, South Tyneside Council and North Tyneside Council. The supporting Friends of Beamish organisation was established in 1968. Frank Atkinson retired as director in 1987. The museum has been 96% self-funding for some years (mainly from admission charges).

==Sections of the museum==
===1913===
The town area, officially opened in 1985, depicts chiefly Victorian buildings in an evolved urban setting of 1913.

==== Tramway ====

The Beamish Tramway is long, with four passing loops. The line makes a circuit of the museum site forming an important element of the visitor transportation system.

The first trams began operating on a short demonstration line in 1973, with the whole circle in operation by 1993. It represents the era of electric powered trams, which were being introduced to meet the needs of growing towns and cities across the North East from the late 1890s, replacing earlier horse drawn systems.

===== Bakery =====
Presented as &quot;Joseph Herron, Baker &amp; Confectioner&quot;, the bakery was opened in 2013 and features working ovens which produce food for sale to visitors. A two-storey curved building, only the ground floor is used as the exhibit. A bakery has been included to represent the new businesses which sprang up to cater for the growing middle classes - the ovens being of the modern electric type which were growing in use. The building was sourced from Anfield Plain (which had a bakery trading as Joseph Herron), and was moved to Beamish in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The frontage features a stained glass from a baker&#x27;s shop in South Shields. It also uses fittings from Stockton-on-Tees.

===== Motor garage =====
Presented as &quot;Beamish Motor &amp; Cycle Works&quot;, the motor garage opened in 1994. Reflecting the custom nature of the early motor trade, where only one in 232 people owned a car in 1913, the shop features a showroom to the front (not accessible to visitors), with a garage area to the rear, accessed via the adjacent archway. The works is a replica of a typical garage of the era. Much of the museum&#x27;s car, motorcycle and bicycle collection, both working and static, is stored in the garage. The frontage has two storeys, but the upper floor is only a small mezzanine and is not used as part of the display.

===== Department Store =====

Presented as the &quot;Annfield Plain Industrial Co-operative Society Ltd,&quot; (but more commonly referred to as the Anfield Plain Co-op Store) this department store opened in 1984, and was relocated to Beamish from Annfield Plain in County Durham. The Annfield Plain co-operative society was originally established in 1870, with the museum store stocking various products from the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), established 1863. A two-storey building, the ground floor comprises the three departments - grocery, drapery and hardware; the upper floor is taken up by the tea rooms (accessed from Redman Park via a ramp to the rear). Most of the items are for display only, but a small amount of goods are sold to visitors. The store features an operational cash carrier system, of the Lamson Cash Ball design - common in many large stores of the era, but especially essential to Co-ops, where customer&#x27;s dividends had to be logged.

===== Ravensworth Terrace =====
Ravensworth Terrace is a row of terraced houses, presented as the premises and living areas of various professionals. Representing the expanding housing stock of the era, it was relocated from its original site on Bensham Bank, having been built for professionals and tradesmen between 1830 and 1845. Original former residents included painter John Wilson Carmichael and Gateshead mayor Alexander Gillies. Originally featuring 25 homes, the terrace was to be demolished when the museum saved it in the 1970s, reconstructing six of them on the Town site between 1980 and 1985. They are two storey buildings, with most featuring display rooms on both floors - originally the houses would have also housed a servant in the attic. The front gardens are presented in a mix of the formal style, and the natural style that was becoming increasingly popular.

No. 2 is presented as the home of Miss Florence Smith, a music teacher, with old fashioned mid-Victorian furnishings as if inherited from her parents. No. 3 &amp; 4 is presented as the practice and home respectively (with a knocked through door) of dentist J. Jones - the exterior nameplate having come from the surgery of Mr. J. Jones in Hartlepool. Representing the state of dental health at the time, it features both a check-up room and surgery for extraction, and a technicians room for creating dentures - a common practice at the time being the giving to daughters a set on their 21st birthday, to save any future husband the cost at a later date. His home is presented as more modern than No.2, furnished in the Edwardian style the modern day utilities of an enamelled bathroom with flushing toilet, a controllable heat kitchen range and gas cooker. No. 5 is presented as a solicitor&#x27;s office, based on that of Robert Spence Watson, a Quaker from Newcastle. Reflecting the trade of the era, downstairs is laid out as the partner&#x27;s or principal office, and the general or clerk&#x27;s office in the rear. Included is a set of books sourced from ER Hanby Holmes, who practised in Barnard Castle.

===== Pub =====
Presented as &quot;The Sun Inn&quot;, the pub opened in the town in 1985. It had originally stood in Bondgate in Bishop Auckland, and was donated to the museum by its final owners, the Scottish and Newcastle Breweries. Originally a &quot;one-up one down&quot; cottage, the earliest ownership has been traced to James Thompson, on 21 January 1806. Known as The Tiger Inn until the 1850s, from 1857 to 1899 under the ownership of the Leng family, it flourished under the patronage of miners from Newton Cap and other collieries. Latterly run by Elsie Edes, it came under brewery ownership in the 20th Century when bought by S&amp;N antecedent, James Deuchar Ltd. The pub is fully operational, and features both a front and back bar, the two storeys above not being part of the exhibit. The interior decoration features the stuffed racing greyhound, Jake&#x27;s Bonny Mary, which won nine trophies before being put on display in The Gerry in White le Head near Tantobie.

===== Town stables =====

Reflecting the reliance on horses for a variety of transport needs in the era, the town features a centrally located stables, situated behind the sweet shop, with its courtyard being accessed from the archway next to the pub. It is presented as a typical jobmaster&#x27;s yard, with stables and a tack room in the building on its north side. A small, brick built open air, carriage shed is sited on the back of the printworks building. On the east side of the courtyard is a much larger metal shed (utilising iron roof trusses from Fleetwood), arranged mainly as carriage storage, but with a blacksmith&#x27;s shop in the corner. The building on the west side of the yard is not part of any display. The interior fittings for the harness room came from Callaly Caste. Many of the horses and horse-drawn vehicles used by the museum are housed in the stables and sheds.

===== Printer, stationer and newspaper branch office =====
Presented as the Beamish Branch Office of the &quot;Northern Daily Mail&quot; and the &quot;Sunderland Daily Echo&quot;, the two storey replica building was built in the mid-1980s and represents the trade practices of the era. Downstairs, on the right, is the branch office, where newspapers would be sold directly and distributed to local newsagents and street vendors, and where orders for advertising copy would be taken. Supplementing it is a stationer&#x27;s shop on the left hand side, with both display items and a small number of gift items on public sale. Upstairs is a jobbing printers workshop, which would not produce the newspapers, but would instead print leaflets, posters and office stationery. Split into a composing area and a print shop, the shop itself has a number of presses - a Columbian built in 1837 by Clymer and Dixon, an Albion dating back to 1863, an Arab Platen of c. 1900, and a Wharfedale flat bed press, built by Dawson &amp; Son in around 1870. Much of the machinery was sourced from the print works of Jack Ascough&#x27;s of Barnard Castle. Many of the posters seen around the museum are printed in the works, with the operation of the machinery being part of the display.

===== Sweet shop =====
Presented as &quot;Jubilee Confectioners&quot;, the two storey sweet shop opened in 1994 and is meant to represent the typical family run shops of the era, with living quarters above the shop (the second storey not being part of the display). To the front of the ground floor is a shop, where traditional sweets and chocolate (which was still relatively expensive at the time) are sold to visitors, while in the rear of the ground floor is a manufacturing area where visitors can view the techniques of the time (accessed via the arched walkway on the side of the building). The sweet rollers were sourced from a variety of shops and factories.

===== Bank =====
Presented as a branch of &quot;Barclays Bank&quot; (Barclay &amp; Company Ltd) using period currency, the bank opened in 1999. It represents the trend of the era when regional banks were being acquired and merged into national banks such as Barclays, formed in 1896. Built to a three-storey design typical of the era, and featuring bricks in the upper storeys sourced from Park House, Gateshead, the Swedish imperial red shade used on the ground floor frontage is intended to represent stability and security. On the ground floor are windows for bank tellers, plus the bank manager&#x27;s office. Included in a basement level are two vaults. The upper two storeys are not part of the display. It features components sourced from Southport and Gateshead

===== Masonic Hall =====
The Masonic Hall opened in 2006, and features the frontage from a former masonic hall sited in Park Terrace, Sunderland. Reflecting the popularity of the masons in North East England, as well as the main hall, which takes up the full height of the structure, in a small two story arrangement to the front of the hall is also a Robing Room and the Tyler&#x27;s Room on the ground floor, and a Museum Room upstairs, featuring display cabinets of masonic regalia donated from various lodges. Upstairs is also a class room, with large stained glass window.

===== Chemist and photographer =====
Presented as &quot;W Smith&#x27;s Chemist&quot; and &quot;JR &amp; D Edis Photographers&quot;, a two-storey building housing both a chemist and photographers shops under one roof opened on 7 May 2016 and represents the growing popularity of photography in the era, with shops often growing out of or alongside chemists, who had the necessary supplies for developing photographs. The chemist features a dispensary, and equipment from various shops including John Walker, inventor of the friction match. The photographers features a studio, where visitors can dress in period costume and have a photograph taken. The corner building is based on a real building on Elvet Bridge in Durham City, opposite the Durham Marriot Hotel (the Royal County), although the second storey is not part of the display. The chemist also sells aerated water (an early form of carbonated soft drinks) to visitors, sold in marble-stopper sealed Codd bottles (although made to a modern design to prevent the safety issue that saw the original bottles banned: children were smashing the bottles to retrieve the glass marble). Aerated waters grew in popularity in the era, due to the need for a safe alternative to water, and the temperance movement - being sold in chemists due to the perception they were healthy in the same way mineral waters were.

Costing around £600,000 and begun on 18 August 2014, the building&#x27;s brickwork and timber was built by the museum&#x27;s own staff and apprentices, using Georgian bricks salvaged from demolition works to widen the A1. Unlike previous buildings built on the site, the museum had to replicate rather than relocate this one due to the fact that fewer buildings are being demolished compared to the 1970s, and in any case it was deemed unlikely one could be found to fit the curved shape of the plot. The studio is named after a real business run by John Reed Edis and his daughter Daisy. Mr Edis, originally at 27 Sherburn Road, Durham, in 1895, then 52 Saddler Street from 1897. The museum collection features several photographs, signs and equipment from the Edis studio. The name for the chemist is a reference to the business run by William Smith, who relocated to Silver Street, near the original building, in 1902. According to records, the original Edis company had been supplied by chemicals from the original (and still extant) Smith business.

===== Redman Park =====
Redman Park is a small lawned space with flower borders, opposite Ravensworth Terrace. Its centrepiece is a Victorian bandstand sourced from Saltwell Park, where it stood on an island in the middle of a lake. It represents the recognised need of the time for areas where people could relax away from the growing industrial landscape.

===== Other =====
Included in the Town are drinking fountains and other period examples of street furniture. In between the bank and the sweet shop is a combined tram and bus waiting room and public convenience.

===== Unbuilt =====
When construction of the Town began, the projected town plan incorporated a market square and buildings including a gas works, fire station, ice cream parlour (originally the Central Cafe at Consett), a cast iron bus station from Durham City, school, public baths and a fish and chip shop.

====Railway station====
East of the Town is the Railway Station, depicting a typical small passenger and goods facility operated by the main railway company in the region at the time, the North Eastern Railway (NER). A short running line extends west in a cutting around the north side of the Town itself, with trains visible from the windows of the stables. It runs for a distance of mile - the line used to connect to the colliery sidings until 1993 when it was lifted between the town and the colliery so that the tram line could be extended. During 2009 the running line was relaid so that passenger rides could recommence from the station during 2010.

===== Rowley station =====
Representing passenger services is Rowley Station, a station building on a single platform, opened in 1976, having been relocated to the museum from the village of Rowley near Consett, just a few miles from Beamish.

The original Rowley railway station was opened in 1845 (as Cold Rowley, renamed Rowley in 1868) by the NER antecedent, the Stockton and Darlington Railway, consisting of just a platform. Under NER ownership, as a result of increasing use, in 1873 the station building was added. As demand declined, passenger service was withdrawn in 1939, followed by the goods service in 1966. Trains continued to use the line for another three years before it closed, the track being lifted in 1970. Although in a state of disrepair, the museum acquired the building, dismantling it in 1972, being officially unveiled in its new location by railway campaigner and poet, Sir John Betjeman.

The station building is presented as an Edwardian station, lit by oil lamp, having never been connected to gas or electricity supplies in its lifetime. It features both an open waiting area and a visitor accessible waiting room (western half), and a booking and ticket office (eastern half), with the latter only visible from a small viewing entrance. Adorning the waiting room is a large tiled NER route map.

===== Signal box =====
The signal box dates from 1896, and was relocated from near Consett. It features assorted signalling equipment, basic furnishings for the signaller, and a lever frame, controlling the stations numerous points, interlocks and semaphore signals. The frame is not an operational part of the railway, the points being hand operated using track side levers. Visitors can only view the interior from a small area inside the door.

===== Goods shed =====
The goods shed is originally from . The goods area represents how general cargo would have been moved on the railway, and for onward transport. The goods shed features a covered platform where road vehicles (wagons and carriages) can be loaded with the items unloaded from railway vans. The shed sits on a triangular platform serving two sidings, with a platform mounted hand-crane, which would have been used for transhipment activity (transfer of goods from one wagon to another, only being stored for a short time on the platform, if at all).

===== Coal yard =====
The coal yard represents how coal would have been distributed from incoming trains to local merchants - it features a coal drop which unloads railway wagons into road going wagons below. At the road entrance to the yard is a weighbridge (with office) and coal merchant&#x27;s office - both being appropriately furnished with display items, but only viewable from outside.

The coal drop was sourced from West Boldon, and would have been a common sight on smaller stations. The weighbridge came from Glanton, while the coal office is from Hexham.

===== Bridges and level crossing =====
The station is equipped with two footbridges, a wrought iron example to the east having come from Howden-le-Wear, and a cast iron example to the west sourced from Dunston. Next to the western bridge, a roadway from the coal yard is presented as crossing the tracks via a gated level crossing (although in reality the road goes nowhere on the north side).

===== Waggon and Iron Works =====

Dominating the station is the large building externally presented as &quot;Beamish Waggon and Iron Works&quot;, estd 1857. In reality this is the Regional Museums Store (see below), although attached to the north side of the store are two covered sidings (not accessible to visitors), used to service and store the locomotives and stock used on the railway.

===== Other =====
A corrugated iron hut adjacent to the &#x27;iron works&#x27; is presented as belonging to the local council, and houses associated road vehicles, wagons and other items.

==== Fairground ====
Adjacent to the station is an events field and fairground with a set of Frederick Savage built steam powered Gallopers dating from 1893.

====Colliery====
Presented as &quot;Beamish Colliery (&quot;owned by &quot;James Joicey &amp; Co.&quot;, and managed by &quot;William Severs&quot;), the colliery represents the coal mining industry which dominated the North East for generations - the museum site is in the former Durham coalfield, where 165,246 men and boys worked in 304 mines in 1913. By the time period represented by Beamish&#x27;s 1900s era, the industry was booming - production in the Great Northern Coalfield had peaked in 1913, and miners were relatively well paid (double that of agriculture, the next largest employer), but the work was dangerous. Children could be employed from age 12 (the school leaving age), but could not go underground until 14.

===== Deep mine =====
Dominating the colliery site are the above ground structures of a deep (i.e. vertical shaft) mine - the brick built Winding Engine House, and the red painted wooden Heapstead. These were relocated to the museum (which never had its own vertical shaft), the winding house coming from Beamish Chophill Colliery, and the Heapstead from Ravensworth Park Mine in Gateshead. The winding engine and its enclosing house are both listed.

The winding engine was the source of power for hauling miners, equipment and coal up and down the shaft in a cage, the top of the shaft being in the adjacent heapstead, which encloses the frame holding the wheel around which the hoist cable travels. Inside the Heapstead, tubs of coal from the shaft were weighed on a weighbridge, then tipped onto jigging screens, which sifted the solid lumps from small particles and dust - these were then sent along the picking belt, where pickers, often women, elderly or disabled people or young boys (i.e. workers incapable of mining), would separate out unwanted stone, wood and rubbish. Finally, the coal was tipped onto waiting railway wagons below, while the unwanted waste sent to the adjacent heap by an external conveyor.

Chophill Colliery was closed by the National Coal Board in 1962, but the winding engine and tower were left in place. When the site was later leased, Beamish founder Frank Atkinson intervened to have both spot listed to prevent their demolition. After a protracted and difficult process to gain the necessary permissions to move a listed structure, the tower and engine were eventually relocated to the museum, work being completed in 1976. The winding engine itself is the only surviving example of the type which was once common, and was still in use at Chophill upon its closure. It was built in 1855 by J&amp;G Joicey of Newcastle, to an 1800 design by Phineas Crowther.

Inside the winding engine house, supplementing the winding engine is a smaller jack engine, housed in the rear. These were used to lift heavy equipment, and in deep mines, act as a relief winding engine.

Outdoors, next to the Heapstead, is a sinking engine, mounted on red bricks. Brought to the museum from Silksworth Colliery in 1971, it was built by Burlington&#x27;s of Sunderland in 1868 and is the sole surviving example of its kind. Sinking engines were used for the construction of shafts, after which the winding engine would become the source of hoist power. It is believed the Silksworth engine was retained because it was powerful enough to serve as a backup winding engine, and could be used to lift heavy equipment (i.e. the same role as the jack engine inside the winding house).

===== Drift mine =====
The Mahogany Drift Mine is original to Beamish, having opened in 1855 and after closing, was brought back into use in 1921 to transport coal from Beamish Park Drift to Beamish Cophill Colliery. It opened as a museum display in 1979. Included in the display is the winding engine and a short section of trackway used to transport tubs of coal to the surface, and a mine office. Visitor access into the mine shaft is by guided tour.

===== Lamp cabin =====
The Lamp Cabin opened in 2009, and is a recreation of a typical design used in collieries to house safety lamps, a necessary piece of equipment for miners although were not required in the Mahogany Drift Mine, due to it being gas-free. The building is split into two main rooms; in one half, the lamp cabin interior is recreated, with a collection of lamps on shelves, and the system of safety tokens used to track which miners were underground. Included in the display is a 1927 Hailwood and Ackroyd lamp-cleaning machine sourced from Morrison Busty Colliery in Annfield Plain. In the second room is an educational display, i.e., not a period interior.

===== Colliery railways =====

The colliery features both a standard gauge railway, representing how coal was transported to its onward destination, and narrow-gauge typically used by Edwardian collieries for internal purposes. The standard gauge railway is laid out to serve the deep mine - wagons being loaded by dropping coal from the heapstead - and runs out of the yard to sidings laid out along the northern-edge of the Pit Village.

The standard gauge railway has two engine sheds in the colliery yard, the smaller brick, wood and metal structure being an operational building; the larger brick-built structure is presented as &quot;Beamish Engine Works&quot;, a reconstruction of an engine shed formerly at Beamish 2nd Pit. Used for locomotive and stock storage, it is a long, single track shed featuring a servicing pit for part of its length. Visitors can walk along the full length in a segregated corridor. A third engine shed in brick (lower half) and corrugated iron has been constructed at the southern end of the yard, on the other side of the heapstead to the other two sheds, and is used for both narrow and standard gauge vehicles (on one road), although it is not connected to either system - instead being fed by low-loaders and used for long-term storage only.

The narrow gauge railway is serviced by a corrugate iron engine shed, and is being expanded to eventually encompass several sidings.

There are a number of industrial steam locomotives (including rare examples by Stephen Lewin from Seaham and Black, Hawthorn &amp; Co) and many chaldron wagons, the region&#x27;s traditional type of colliery railway rolling stock, which became a symbol of Beamish Museum. The locomotive Coffee Pot No 1 is often in steam during the summer.

===== Other =====
On the south eastern corner of the colliery site is the Power House, brought to the museum from Houghton Colliery. These were used to store explosives.

==== Pit Village ====
Alongside the colliery is the pit village, representing life in the mining communities that grew alongside coal production sites in the North East, many having come into existence solely because of the industry, such as Seaham Harbour, West Hartlepool, Esh Winning and Bedlington.

===== Miner&#x27;s Cottages =====

The row of six miner&#x27;s cottages in Francis Street represent the tied-housing provided by colliery owners to mine workers. Relocated to the museum in 1976, they were originally built in the 1860s in Hetton-le-Hole by Hetton Coal Company. They feature the common layout of a single-storey with a kitchen to the rear, the main room of the house, and parlour to the front, rarely used (although it was common for both rooms to be used for sleeping, with disguised folding &quot;dess&quot; beds common), and with children sleeping in attic spaces upstairs. In front are long gardens, used for food production, with associated sheds. An outdoor toilet and coal bunker were in the rear yards, and beyond the cobbled back lane to their rear are assorted sheds used for cultivation, repairs and hobbies. Chalkboard slates attached to the rear wall were used by the occupier to tell the mine&#x27;s &quot;knocker up&quot; when they wished to be woken for their next shift.

No.2 is presented as a Methodist family&#x27;s home, featuring good quality &quot;Pitman&#x27;s mahogany&quot; furniture; No.3 is presented as occupied by a second generation well off Irish Catholic immigrant family featuring many items of value (so they could be readily sold off in times of need) and an early 1890s range; No.3 is presented as more impoverished than the others with just a simple convector style Newcastle oven, being inhabited by a miner&#x27;s widow allowed to remain as her son is also a miner, and supplementing her income doing laundry and making/mending for other families. All the cottages feature examples of the folk art objects typical of mining communities. Also included in the row is an office for the miner&#x27;s paymaster. In the rear alleyway of the cottages is a communal bread oven, which were commonplace until miner&#x27;s cottages gradually obtained their own kitchen ranges. They were used to bake traditional breads such as the Stottie, as well as sweet items, such as tea cakes. With no extant examples, the museum&#x27;s oven had to be created from photographs and oral history.

===== School =====

The school opened in 1992, and represents the typical board school in the educational system of the era (the stone built single storey structure being inscribed with the foundation date of &quot;1891, Beamish School Board&quot;), by which time attendance at a state approved school was compulsory, but the leaving age was 12, and lessons featured learning by rote and corporal punishment. The building originally stood in East Stanley, having been set up by the local school board, and would have numbered around 150 pupils. Having been donated by Durham County Council, the museum now has a special relationship with the primary school that replaced it. With separate entrances and cloakrooms for boys and girls at either end, the main building is split into three class rooms (all accessible to visitors), connected by a corridor along the rear. To the rear is a red brick bike shed, and in the playground visitors can play traditional games of the era.

===== Chapel =====

Pit Hill Chapel opened in 1990, and represents the Wesleyan Methodist tradition which was growing in North East England, with the chapels used for both religious worship and as community venues, which continue in its role in the museum display. Opened in the 1850s, it originally stood not far from its present site, having been built in what would eventually become Beamish village, near the museum entrance. A stained glass window of &quot;The Light of The World&quot; by William Holman Hunt came from a chapel in Bedlington. A two handled Love Feast Mug dates from 1868, and came from a chapel in Shildon Colliery. On the eastern wall, above the elevated altar area, is an angled plain white surface used for magic lantern shows, generated using a replica of the double-lensed acetylene gas powered lanterns of the period, mounted in the aisle of the main seating area. Off the western end of the hall is the vestry, featuring a small library and communion sets from Trimdon Colliery and Catchgate.

===== Fish bar =====

Presented as &quot;Davey&#x27;s Fried Fish &amp; Chip Potato Restaurant,&quot; the fish and chip shop opened in 2011, and represents the typical style of shop found in the era as they were becoming rapidly popular in the region - the brick built Victorian style fryery would most often have previously been used for another trade, and the attached corrugated iron hut serves as a saloon with tables and benches, where customers would eat and socialise. Featuring coal fired ranges using beef-dripping, the shop is named in honour of the last coal fired shop in Tyneside, in Winlaton Mill, and which closed in 2007. Latterly run by brothers Brian and Ramsay Davy, it had been established by their grandfather in 1937. The serving counter and one of the shop&#x27;s three fryers, a 1934 Nuttal, came from the original Davy shop. The other two fryers are a 1920s Mabbott used near Chester until the 1960s, and a GW Atkinson New Castle Range, donated from a shop in Prudhoe in 1973. The latter is one of only two known late Victorian examples to survive. The decorative wall tiles in the fryery came to the museum in 1979 from Cowes Fish and Game Shop in Berwick upon Tweed. The shop also features both an early electric and hand-powered potato rumblers (cleaners), and a gas powered chip chopper built around 1900. Built behind the chapel, the fryery is arranged so the counter faces the rear, stretching the full length of the building. Outside is a brick built row of outdoor toilets. Supplementing the fish bar is the restored Berriman&#x27;s mobile chip van, used in Spennymoor until the early 1970s.

===== Band hall =====
The Hetton Silver Band Hall opened in 2013, and features displays reflecting the role colliery bands played in mining life. Built in 1912, it was relocated from its original location in South Market Street, Hetton-le-Hole, where it was used by the Hetton Silver Band, founded in 1887. They built the hall using prize money from a music competition, and the band decided to donate the hall to the museum after they merged with Broughtons Brass Band of South Hetton (to form the Durham Miners&#x27; Association Brass Band). It is believed to be the only purpose built band hall in the region. The structure consists of the main hall, plus a small kitchen to the rear; as part of the museum it is still used for performances.

===== Pit pony stables =====
The Pit Pony Stables were built in 2013/14, and house the museum&#x27;s pit ponies. They replace a wooden stable a few metres away in the field opposite the school (the wooden structure remaining). It represents the sort of stables that were used in drift mines (ponies in deep mines living their whole lives underground), pit ponies having been in use in the north east as late as 1994, in Ellington Colliery. The structure is a recreation of an original building that stood at Rickless Drift Mine, between High Spen and Greenside; it was built using a yellow brick that was common across the Durham coalfield.

===== Other =====
Doubling as one of the museum&#x27;s refreshment buildings, &quot;Sinker&#x27;s Bait Cabin&quot; represents the temporary structures that would have served as living quarters, canteens and drying areas for sinkers, the itinerant workforce that would dig new vertical mine shafts.

Representing other traditional past-times, the village fields include a quoits pitch, with another refreshment hut alongside it, resembling a wooden clubhouse.

In one of the fields in the village stands the Cupola, a small round flat topped brick built tower; such structures were commonly placed on top of disused or ventilation shafts, also used as an emergency exit from the upper seams.

===The Georgian North (1825)===
A late Georgian landscape based around the original Pockerley farm represents the period of change in the region as transport links were improved and as agriculture changed as machinery and field management developed, and breeding stock was improved. It became part of the museum in 1990, having latterly been occupied by a tenant farmer, and was opened as an exhibit in 1995. The hill top position suggests the site was the location of an Iron Age fort - the first recorded mention of a dwelling is in the 1183 Buke of Boldon (the region&#x27;s equivalent of the Domesday Book). The name Pockerley has Saxon origins - &quot;Pock&quot; or &quot;Pokor&quot; meaning &quot;pimple of bag-like&quot; hill, and &quot;Ley&quot; meaning woodland clearing.

The surrounding farmlands have been returned to a post-enclosure landscape with ridge and furrow topography, divided into smaller fields by traditional riven oak fencing. The land is worked and grazed by traditional methods and breeds.

==== Pockerley Old Hall ====

The estate of Pockerley Old Hall is presented as that of a well off tenant farmer, in a position to take advantage of the agricultural advances of the era. The hall itself consists of the Old House, which is adjoined (but not connected to) the New House, both south facing two storey sandstone built buildings, the Old House also having a small north–south aligned extension. Roof timbers in the sandstone built Old House have been dated to the 1440s, but the lower storey (the undercroft) may be from even earlier. The New House dates to the late 1700s, and replaced a medieval manor house to the east of the Old House as the main farm house - once replaced itself, the Old House is believed to have been let to the farm manager. Visitors can access all rooms in the New and Old House, except the north–south extension which is now a toilet block. Displays include traditional cooking, such as the drying of oatcakes over a wooden rack (flake) over the fireplace in the Old House.

Inside the New House the downstairs consists of a main kitchen and a secondary kitchen (scullery) with pantry. It also includes a living room, although as the main room of the house, most meals would have been eaten in the main kitchen, equipped with an early range, boiler and hot air oven. Upstairs is a main bedroom and a second bedroom for children; to the rear (i.e. the colder, north side), are bedrooms for a servant and the servant lad respectively. Above the kitchen (for transferred warmth) is a grain and fleece store, with attached bacon loft, a narrow space behind the wall where bacon or hams, usually salted first, would be hung to be smoked by the kitchen fire (entering through a small door in the chimney).

Presented as having sparse and more old fashioned furnishings, the Old House is presented as being occupied in the upper story only, consisting of a main room used as the kitchen, bedroom and for washing, with the only other rooms being an adjoining second bedroom and an overhanging toilet. The main bed is an oak box bed dating to 1712, obtained from Star House in Baldersdale in 1962. Originally a defensive house in its own right, the lower level of the Old House is an undercroft, or vaulted basement chamber, with 1.5 metre thick walls - in times of attack the original tenant family would have retreated here with their valuables, although in its later use as the farm managers house, it is now presented as a storage and work room, housing a large wooden cheese press. More children would have slept in the attic of the Old House (not accessible as a display).

To the front of the hall is a terraced garden featuring an ornamental garden with herbs and flowers, a vegetable garden, and an orchard, all laid out and planted according to the designs of William Falla of Gateshead, who had the largest nursery in Britain from 1804 to 1830.

The buildings to the east of the hall, across a north–south track, are the original farmstead buildings dating from around 1800. These include stables and a cart shed arranged around a fold yard. The horses and carts on display are typical of North Eastern farms of the era, Fells or Dales ponies and Cleveland Bay horses, and two wheeled long carts for hilly terrain (as opposed to four wheel carts).

==== Pockerley Waggonway ====
The Pockerley Waggonway opened in 2001, and represents the year 1825, as the year the Stockton and Darlington Railway opened. Waggonways had appeared around 1600, and by the 1800s were common in mining areas - prior to 1800 they had been either horse or gravity powered, before the invention of steam engines (initially used as static winding engines), and later mobile steam locomotives.

Housing the locomotives and rolling stock is the Great Shed, which opened in 2001 and is based on Timothy Hackworth&#x27;s erecting shop, Shildon railway works, and incorporating some material from Robert Stephenson and Company&#x27;s Newcastle works. Visitors can walk around the locomotives in the shed, and when in steam, can take rides to the end of the track and back in the line&#x27;s assorted rolling stock - situated next to the Great Shed is a single platform for passenger use. In the corner of the main shed is a corner office, presented as a locomotive designer&#x27;s office (only visible to visitors through windows). Off the pedestrian entrance in the southern side is a room presented as the engine crew&#x27;s break room. Atop the Great Shed is a weather vane depicting a waggonway train approaching a cow, a reference to a famous quote by George Stephenson when asked by parliament in 1825 what would happen in such an eventuality - &quot;very awkward indeed - for the coo!&quot;.

At the far end of the waggonway is the (fictional) coal mine Pockerley Gin Pit, which the waggonway notionally exists to serve. The pit head features a horse powered wooden whim gin, which was the method used before steam engines for hauling men and material up and down mineshafts - coal was carried in corves (wicker baskets), while miners held onto the rope with their foot in an attached loop.

==== Wooden waggonway ====
Following creation of the Pockerley Waggonway, the museum went back a chapter in railway history to create a horse-worked wooden waggonway.

==== St Helen&#x27;s Church ====

St Helen&#x27;s Church represents a typical type of country church found in North Yorkshire, and was relocated from its original site in Eston, North Yorkshire. It is the oldest and most complex building moved to the museum. It opened in November 2015, but will not be consecrated as this would place restrictions on what could be done with the building under church law.

The church had existed on its original site since around 1100. As the congregation grew, it was replaced by two nearby churches, and latterly became a cemetery chapel. After closing in 1985, it fell into disrepair and by 1996 was burnt out and vandalised leading to the decision by the local authority in 1998 to demolish it. Working to a deadline of a threatened demolition within six months, the building was deconstructed and moved to Beamish, reconstruction being authorised in 2011, with the exterior build completed by 2012.

While the structure was found to contain some stones from the 1100 era, the building itself however dates from three distinct building phases - the chancel on the east end dates from around 1450, while the nave, which was built at the same time, was modernised in 1822 in the Churchwarden style, adding a vestry. The bell tower dates from the late 1600s - one of the two bells is a rare dated Tudor example. Gargoyles, originally hidden in the walls and believed to have been pranks by the original builders, have been made visible in the reconstruction.

Restored to its 1822 condition, the interior has been furnished with Georgian box pews sourced from a church in Somerset. Visitors can access all parts except the bell tower. The nave includes a small gallery level, at the tower end, while the chancel includes a church office.

A Hearse House (shed for a horse-drawn hearse) has been reconstructed near the church.

==== Joe the Quilter&#x27;s Cottage ====
The most recent addition to the area opened to the public in 2018 is a recreation of a heather-thatched cottage which features stones from the Georgian quilter Joseph Hedley&#x27;s original home in Northumberland. It was uncovered during an archaeological dig by Beamish. His original cottage was demolished in 1872 and has been carefully recreated with the help of a drawing on a postcard. The exhibit tells the story of quilting and the growth of cottage industries in the early 1800s. Within there is often a volunteer or member of staff not only telling the story of how Joe was murdered in 1826, a crime that remains unsolved to this day, but also giving visitors the opportunity to learn more and even have a go at quilting.

==== Other ====
A pack pony track passes through the scene - pack horses having been the mode of transport for all manner of heavy goods where no waggonway exists, being also able to reach places where carriages and wagons could not access. Beside the waggonway is a gibbet.

=== Farm (1940s) ===
Presented as Home Farm, this represents the role of North East farms as part of the British Home Front during World War II, depicting life indoors, and outside on the land. Much of the farmstead is original, and opened as a museum display in 1983. The farm is laid out across a north–south public road; to the west is the farmhouse and most of the farm buildings, while on the east side are a pair of cottages, the British Kitchen, an outdoor toilet (&quot;netty&quot;), a bull field, duck pond and large shed.

The farm complex was rebuilt in the mid-19th century as a model farm incorporating a horse mill and a steam-powered threshing mill. It was not presented as a 1940s farm until early 2014.

The farmhouse is presented as having been modernised, following the installation of electric power and an Aga cooker in the scullery, although the main kitchen still has the typical coal-fired black range. Lino flooring allowed quicker cleaning times, while a radio set allowed the family to keep up to date with wartime news. An office next to the kitchen would have served both as the administration centre for the wartime farm, and as a local Home Guard office. Outside the farmhouse is an improvised Home Guard pillbox fashioned from half an egg-ended steam boiler, relocated from its original position near Durham.

The farm is equipped with three tractors which would have all seen service during the war: a Case, a Fordson N and a 1924 Fordson F. The farm also features horse-drawn traps, reflecting the effect wartime rationing of petrol would have had on car use. The farming equipment in the cart and machinery sheds reflects the transition of the time from horse-drawn to tractor-pulled implements, with some older equipment put back into use due to the war, as well as a large Foster thresher, vital for cereal crops, and built specifically for the war effort, sold at the Newcastle Show. Although the wartime focus was on crops, the farm also features breeds of sheep, cattle, pigs and poultry that would have been typical for the time. The farm also has a portable steam engine, not in use, but presented as having been left out for collection as part of a wartime scrap metal drive.

The cottages would have housed farm labourers, but are presented as having new uses for the war: Orchard Cottage housing a family of evacuees, and Garden Cottage serving as a billet for members of the Women&#x27;s Land Army (Land Girls). Orchard Cottage is named for an orchard next to it, which also contains an Anderson shelter, reconstructed from partial pieces of ones recovered from around the region. Orchard Cottage, which has both front and back kitchens, is presented as having an up to date blue enameled kitchen range, with hot water supplied from a coke stove, as well as a modern accessible bathroom. Orchard Cottage is also used to stage recreations of wartime activities for schools, elderly groups and those living with dementia. Garden Cottage is sparsely furnished with a mix of items, reflecting the few possessions Land Girls were able to take with them, although unusually the cottage is depicted with a bathroom, and electricity (due to proximity to a colliery).

The British Kitchen is both a display and one of the museum&#x27;s catering facilities; it represents an installation of one of the wartime British Restaurants, complete with propaganda posters and a suitably patriotic menu.

=== Town (1950s) ===

As part of the Remaking Beamish project, with significant funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, the museum is creating a 1950s town. Opened in July 2019, the Welfare Hall is an exact replica of the Leasingthorne Colliery Welfare Hall and Community Centre which was built in 1957 near Bishop Auckland. Visitors can &#x27;take part in activities including dancing, crafts, Meccano, beetle drive, keep fit and amateur dramatics&#x27; while also taking a look at the National Health Service exhibition on display, recreating the environment of an NHS clinic. A recreation and play park, named Coronation Park was opened in May 2022 to coincide with the celebrations around the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

The museum&#x27;s first 1950s terrace opened in February 2022. This included a fish and chip shop from Middleton St George, a cafe, a replica of Norman Cornish&#x27;s home, and a hairdressers. Future developments opposite the existing 1950s terrace will see a recreation of The Grand Cinema, from Ryhope, in Sunderland, and toy and electricians shops. Also underdevelopment are a 1950s bowling green and pavilion, police houses and aged miner&#x27;s cottages. Also under construction are semi-detached houses; for this exhibit, a competition was held to recreate a particular home at Beamish, which was won by a family from Sunderland.

As well as the town, a 1950s Northern bus depot has been opened on the western side of the museum – the purpose of this is to provide additional capacity for bus, trolleybus and tram storage once the planned trolleybus extension and the new area are completed, providing extra capacity and meeting the need for modified routing.

==== Spain&#x27;s Field Farm ====
In March 2022, the museum opened Spain&#x27;s Field Farm. It had stood for centuries at Eastgate in Weardale, and was moved to Beamish stone-by-stone. It is exhibited as it would have been in the 1950s.

==== 1820s Expansion ====
In the area surrounding the current Pockerley Old Hall and Steam Wagon Way more development is on the way. The first of these was planned to be a Georgian Coaching Inn that would be the museum&#x27;s first venture into overnight accommodation. However following the COVID-19 pandemic this was abandoned, in favour of self-catering accommodation in existing cottages.

There are also plans for 1820s industries including a blacksmith&#x27;s forge and a pottery.

=== Museum stores ===
There are two stores on the museum site, used to house donated objects. In contrast to the traditional rotation practice used in museums where items are exchanged regularly between store and display, it is Beamish policy that most of their exhibits are to be in use and on display - those items that must be stored are to be used in the museum&#x27;s future developments.

==== Open Store ====
Housed in the Regional Resource Centre, the Open Store is accessible to visitors. Objects are housed on racks along one wall, while the bulk of items are in a rolling archive, with one set of shelves opened, with perspex across their fronts to permit viewing without touching.

==== Regional Museums Store ====
The real purposes of the building presented as &quot;Beamish Waggon and Iron Works&quot; next to Rowley Station is as the Regional Museums Store, completed in 2002, which Beamish shares with Tyne and Wear Museums. This houses, amongst other things, a large marine diesel engine by William Doxford &amp; Sons of Pallion, Sunderland (1977); and several boats including the Tyne wherry (a traditional local type of lighter) &quot;Elswick No. 2&quot; (1930). The store is only open at selected times, and for special tours which can be arranged through the museum; however, a number of viewing windows have been provided for use at other times.

==Transport collection==

The museum contains much of transport interest, and the size of its site makes good internal transportation for visitors and staff purposes a necessity.

The collection contains a variety of historical vehicles for road, rail and tramways. In addition there are some modern working replicas to enhance the various scenes in the museum.

==Agriculture==
The museum&#x27;s two farms help to preserve traditional northcountry and in some cases rare livestock breeds such as Durham Shorthorn Cattle; Clydesdale and Cleveland Bay working horses; Dales ponies; Teeswater sheep; Saddleback pigs; and poultry.

==Regional heritage==
Other large exhibits collected by the museum include a tracked steam shovel, and a coal drop from Seaham Harbour.

In 2001 a new-build Regional Resource Centre (accessible to visitors by appointment) opened on the site to provide accommodation for the museum&#x27;s core collections of smaller items. These include over 300,000 historic photographs, printed books and ephemera, and oral history recordings. The object collections cover the museum&#x27;s specialities. These include quilts; &quot;clippy mats&quot; (rag rugs); Trade union banners; floorcloth; advertising (including archives from United Biscuits and Rowntree&#x27;s); locally made pottery; folk art; and occupational costume. Much of the collection is viewable online and the arts of quilting, rug making and cookery in the local traditions are demonstrated at the museum.

== Filming location ==
The site has been used as the backdrop for many film and television productions, particularly Catherine Cookson dramas, produced by Tyne Tees Television, and the final episode and the feature film version of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;. Some of the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Supergran&quot; was shot here.

=== Visitor numbers ===
On its opening day the museum set a record by attracting a two-hour queue. Visitor numbers rose rapidly to around 450,000 p.a. during the first decade of opening to the public, with the millionth visitor arriving in 1978.

=== Awards ===

It was designated by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council in 1997 as a museum with outstanding collections.

=== Critical responses ===
In responding to criticism that it trades on nostalgia
the museum is unapologetic. A former director has written: &quot;As individuals and communities we have a deep need and desire &quot;to understand ourselves in time&quot;.&quot;

According to the BBC writing in its 40th anniversary year, Beamish was a mould-breaking museum that became a great success due to its collection policy, and what sets it apart from other museums is the use of costumed people to impart knowledge to visitors, rather than labels or interpretive panels (although some such panels do exist on the site), which means it &quot;engages the visitor with history in a unique way&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
Beamish was influential on the Black Country Living Museum, Blists Hill Victorian Town and, in the view of museologist Kenneth Hudson, more widely in the museum community and is a significant educational resource locally. It can also demonstrate its benefit to the contemporary local economy.

The unselective collecting policy has created a lasting bond between museum and community.

<text>Kazimierz (; ; ) is a historical district of Kraków and Kraków Old Town, Poland. From its inception in the 14th century to the early 19th century, Kazimierz was an independent city, a royal city of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom, located south of the Old Town of Kraków, separated from it by a branch of the Vistula river. For many centuries, Kazimierz was a place where ethnic Polish and Jewish cultures coexisted and intermingled. The northeastern part of the district was historically Jewish. In 1941, the Jews of Kraków were forcibly relocated by the German occupying forces into the Krakow ghetto just across the river in Podgórze, and most did not survive the war. Today, Kazimierz is one of the major tourist attractions of Krakow and an important center of cultural life of the city.

The boundaries of Kazimierz are defined by an old island in the Vistula river. The northern branch of the river ( – Old Vistula) was filled-in at the end of the 19th century and made into an extension of Stradomska Street connecting Kazimierz district with Kraków Old Town.

==Early history==
Three early medieval settlements are known to have existed on the island defining Kazimierz. The most important of these was the pre-Christian pagan Slavic shrine at Skałka (“the little rock”) at the western, upstream tip of the island. This site, with its sacred pool, was later Christianised as the Church of St. Michael the Archangel in the 11th century and was the legendary site of the martyrdom of St. Stanisław. There was a nearby noble manor complex to the southeast and an important cattle-market town of Bawół, possibly based on an old tribal gord (Polish: gród), at the edges of the habitable land near the swamps that composed the eastern, downstream end of the island. There was also a much smaller island upstream of Kazimierz known as the “Tatar Island” after the Tatar cemetery there. This smaller island has since washed away.

On 27 March 1335, King Casimir III of Poland () declared the two western suburbs of Kraków to be a new town named after him, Kazimierz ( in Latin). Shortly thereafter, in 1340, Bawół was also added to it, making the boundaries of new city the same as the whole island. King Casimir granted his location privilege in accordance with Magdeburg Law and, in 1362, ordered defensive walls to be built. He settled the newly built central section primarily with burghers, with a plot set aside for the Augustinian order next to Skałka. He also began work on a campus for the Kraków Academy which he founded in 1364, but Casimir died in 1370 and the campus was never completed.

Perhaps the most important feature of medieval Kazimierz was the &quot;Pons Regalis&quot;, the only major, permanent bridge across the Vistula () for several centuries. This bridge connected Kraków via Kazimierz to the Wieliczka Salt Mine and the lucrative Hungarian trade route. The last bridge at this location (at the end of modern Stradomska Street) was dismantled in 1880 when the filling-in of the &quot;Old Vistula&quot; river bed under Mayor Mikołaj Zyblikiewicz made it obsolete.

==Jewish Kazimierz==

Jews had played an important role in the Kraków regional economy since the end of the 13th century, granted the freedom of worship, trade and travel by Bolesław the Pious in his General Charter of Jewish Liberties issued already in 1264. The Jewish community in Kraków had lived undisturbed alongside their ethnic Polish neighbours under the protective King Casimir III the Great, the last king of the Piast dynasty. Nevertheless, in the early 15th century pressured by the Synod of Constance some dogmatic clergy began to push for less official tolerance. Accusations of blood libel by a fanatic priest in Kraków led to riots against the Jews in 1407 even though the royal guard hastened to their rescue.

As part of the re-founding of the Kraków university, starting in 1400, the Academy began to buy outbuildings in the Old Town. Some Jews moved to the area around modern Plac Szczepański. The oldest synagogue building standing in Poland was built in Kazimierz at around that time, either in 1407 or 1492 (the date varies with several sources). It is an Orthodox fortress synagogue called the Old Synagogue. In 1494 a disastrous fire destroyed a large part of Kraków. In 1495 the Polish king John I Albert (&quot;Jan Olbracht&quot;) ordered Jews out of the Old Town of Kraków and allowed to settle in the Bawół district of Kazimierz. The Jewish Qahal petitioned the Kazimierz town council for the right to build its own interior walls, cutting across the western end of the older defensive walls in 1553. Due to the growth of the community and the influx of Jews from Bohemia, the walls were expanded again in 1608. Later requests to expand the walls were turned down as redundant.

The area between the walls was known as the &quot;Oppidum Judaeorum&quot;, the Jewish City, which represented only about one-fifth of the geographical area of Kazimierz, but nearly half of its inhabitants. The Oppidum became the main spiritual and cultural centre of Polish Jewry, hosting many of Poland&#x27;s finest Jewish scholars, artists and craftsmen. Among its famous inhabitants were the Talmudist Moses Isserles, the Court Jew Abraham of Bohemia, the Kabbalist Natan Szpiro, and the royal physician Shmuel bar Meshulam.

The golden age of the Oppidum came to an end in 1782, when the Austrian Emperor Joseph II disbanded the kahal.

After the 1795 Third Partition of Poland, Kraków was acquired by Austria, and Kazimierz lost its status as a separate city and became a district of Kraków. In 1822, the walls were torn down, removing any physical reminder of the old borders between Jewish and ethnic Polish Kazimierz. The richer Jewish families had moved out of the overcrowded streets of eastern Kazimierz, but because of the injunction against travel on the Sabbath, most Jewish families stayed relatively close to the historic synagogues in the old Oppidum, maintaining Kazimierz&#x27;s reputation as a “Jewish district” long after the concept ceased to have any administrative meaning. 

By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially registered synagogues and prayer houses scattered across the city and much of Jewish intellectual life had moved to new centres like Podgórze. In a tourist guide that was published in 1935, Meir Balaban, a Reform rabbi and professor of history at the University of Warsaw, lamented that the Jews who remained in the once vibrant Oppidum were “only the poor and the ultraconservative.” However, this same exodus was the reason why most of the buildings in the Oppidum are preserved today in something close to their 18th century shape.

During the Second World War, the Jews of Krakow, including those in Kazimierz, were forced by the Nazis into a crowded ghetto in Podgórze, across the river. On December 5–6, 1939, the Germans blockaded all Jewish homes in Kazimierz and other parts of Kraków and brutally confiscated everything collectively valued more than Zł 2,000 ($625) from individual Jewish residences. Later on, all non Jewish Polish residents living in the parts of Podgórze were ordered to move to Kazimierz by March 20, 1941. Jews were given the same amount of time to move to the ghetto in the opposite direction. Some non Jewish Poles told the Germans that it would be impossible to move some of their businesses and workshops to Kazimierz because of inadequate facilities there. Their appeals fell on deaf ears. Most of Jews were later killed during the liquidation of the ghetto or in death camps.
==Postwar Jewish Kazimierz==
After the Second World War, on 11 August 1945, the Kraków pogrom took place in Kazimierz, in which the Kupa Synagogue was burned down and many Jews were assaulted by a Polish mob. During the war, the Nazis had largely destroyed Kazimierz, and the communist authorities left it a crumbling ruin. It became a dark and dangerous place, devoid of Jews. 

Since 1988, a popular annual Jewish Cultural Festival has drawn Cracovians back to the heart of the Oppidum and re-introduced Jewish culture to a generation of Poles who have grown up without Poland&#x27;s historic Jewish community. In 1993, Steven Spielberg shot his film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; largely in Kazimierz (in spite of the fact that very little of the action historically took place there) and this drew international attention to Kazimierz. The filming crew used different locations of Kazimierz to create scenes from the movie: Oskar Schindler&#x27;s apartment (Straszewskiego 7), Marszałka Józefa Piłsudskiego bridge, “Plac Zgody” (in fact, Szeroka street in Kazimierz), the courtyard of the Drezner family (between Jozefa and Beera Meiselsa streets), the scene with Leopold Pfefferberg on an empty street (the intersection of Jakuba and Ciemna streets), ghetto hospital scene (today: a police station on Szeroka street) Since 1993, there have been parallel developments in the restoration of important historic sites in Kazimierz and a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops. In addition, some Jews have moved to Kazimierz from Israel and the United States. Kazimierz as well as Krakow has had a small growth in the Jewish population recently.

A Jewish youth group now meets weekly in Kazimierz and the Remah Synagogue, which actively serves a small congregation of mostly elderly Cracovian Jews.

Each year at the end of June, the Jewish Culture Festival takes place in Kazimierz. It is Europe&#x27;s largest Jewish festival of culture and music and attracts visitors from around the world. Music at the festival is very diverse and played by bands from the Middle East, the United States and Africa, besides others.

:1. Market Square (Wolnica) with a town hall, now housing an ethnographic museum
Kazimierz&#x27;s square-shaped market square (Wolnica square) sized 195 x 195m used to be almost as large as the Krakow Market Square and served similar functions - trading activities took place there, it was town hall&#x27;s location, where the highest administrative and judicial authorities of the city of Kazimierz had their seat. From each side of this square, there were leading three streets. On the corners of the square, two gothic temples were built, and both of them survived to this day in a great state. Today&#x27;s Wolnica Square, half the size of the original one, gained its borders after Kazimierz was incorporated into Krakow in 1800. In its south-eastern part, there is a sculpture/fountain, Three Musicians - the work of the Krakow artist Bronisław Chromy. The only evidence of Kazimierz&#x27;s former urban independence is the lofty town hall at Wolnica Square. Once gothic (relics of the 14th-century walls are preserved in the basement), it burned twice and was rebuilt each time. As a result of these changes, it gained battlement attics, rare in Krakow, and a tower covered with a modest helmet. After Kazimierz was incorporated into Krakow, the town hall lost its function. With time, it was adapted to the needs of an industrial and commercial school, and later a primary school for Jewish youth.

<text>The Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27; was a long and complicated process that took place in several stages. In 867, Patriarch Photius of Constantinople told other Christian patriarchs that the Rus&#x27; people were converting enthusiastically, but his efforts seem to have entailed no lasting consequences, since the &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot; and other Slavonic sources describe the tenth-century Rus&#x27; as still firmly entrenched in Slavic paganism. The traditional view, as recorded in the &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot;, is that the definitive Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27; dates happened 988 (the year is disputed), when Vladimir the Great was baptized in Chersonesus (&quot;Korsun&quot;) and proceeded to baptize his family and people in Kiev. The latter events are traditionally referred to as baptism of Rus&#x27; (; ; ) in Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian literature.

Although sometimes solely attributed to Vladimir/Volodymyr, the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27; was a long and complicated process that began before the state&#x27;s formation. As early as the 1st century AD, Greeks in the Black Sea Colonies converted to Christianity, although most of these lands never became part of Kievan Rus&#x27;. 

The Goths migrated to through the region in the 3rd century, adopting Arian Christianity in the 4th century, leaving behind 4th- and 5th-century churches excavated in Crimea (which was outside of Kievan control, except for Tmutarakan), although the Hunnic invasion of the 370s halted Christianisation for several centuries.

=== Apostolic legends ===
The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; (pages 7.21–9.4) records the legend of Andrew the Apostle&#x27;s mission to these coastal settlements, as well as blessing the site of present-day Kyiv. Andrew supposedly travelled from Sinope towards Chersonesus (Korsun) in Crimea, up the river Dnipro, and reached the future location of Kyiv, where he erected a cross. Next, he is said to have journeyed north to the Slovenes near the future site of Veliky Novgorod, although he had a negative attitude towards their customs (particularly their washing in a hot steam bath, banya); then he visited Rome and returned to Sinope. In a later passage of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; under the year 6404 (898; page 28), makes confusing claims about how a certain Andronicus, supposedly a disciple of Paul the Apostle, was the &quot;Apostle of the Slavs&quot;, because he preached amongst the &quot;Moravians&quot; in &quot;Illyricum&quot;, and the &quot;Rus″&quot; supposedly descended from the &quot;Slavs&quot;, contradicting claims made elsewhere in the same &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;. 

For one, the chronicle says explicitly &quot;sub anno&quot; 6491 (983): &#x27;the Apostles were not by body here&#x27;; &#x27;the apostles did not teach here; and also the prophets did not prophecy here&#x27;. Secondly, the legend of Andrew travelling through Scythia dates from the 3rd or 4th century, and it was not until the 9th century that the monk Epiphanius wrote a &quot;vita&quot; in Greek about Andrew that mentions the cities of Sinope and Kherson for the first time. Moreover, the external evidence suggests nobody was aware of the legend of Andrew blessing the future site of Kyiv until the late 11th century, and the internal evidence suggests that the trip to the would-be Novgorod Slavs was the first interpolation – as Andrew tells people about it in Rome, but says nothing about erecting a cross and blessing the future site of Kyiv. Therefore, the latter would have been a secondary interpolation that was only formulated later in order to claim an apostolic origin for Kyiv.

== Ninth century ==
Some of the earliest Kievan princes and princesses such as Askold and Dir and Olga of Kiev reportedly converted to Christianity, but Oleg the Wise, Igor of Kiev and Sviatoslav I remained pagans. According to some sources and historians, there was an attempt in the 9th century to Christianise Kievan Rus&#x27;. The most authoritative source for this purported first conversion attempt is an encyclical letter of Patriarch Photius of Constantinople, datable to early 867. Referencing the Rus&#x27;-Byzantine War of 860, Photius informs the Oriental patriarchs and bishops that, after the Bulgarians turned to Christ in 864, the Rus&#x27; followed suit so zealously that he found it prudent to send to their land a bishop.

Byzantine historians, starting with the continuation of Theophanes the Confessor, assumed that the Rus&#x27; raid against Constantinople in 860 was a Byzantine success and attributed the presumed victory to the Intercession of the Theotokos. This conviction dictated the following interpretation: awed by the miracles they witnessed under the walls of the imperial capital and grief-stricken at the disaster that befell them, the Rus&#x27; sent envoys to Photius and asked him to send a bishop to their land.

According to Constantine VII, who authored a biography of his grandfather, Basil the Macedonian, it was his ancestor who persuaded the Rus&#x27; to abandon their pagan ways. Constantine attributes the conversion to Basil and to Patriarch Ignatius, rather than to their predecessors, Michael III and Photius. He narrates how the Byzantines galvanized the Rus&#x27; into conversion by their persuasive words and rich presents, including gold, silver, and precious tissues. He also repeats a traditional story that the pagans were particularly impressed by a miracle: a gospel book thrown by the archbishop (sic) into an oven was not damaged by fire.

Constantine&#x27;s account precipitated a long-term dispute over whether the 9th-century Christianization of the Rus&#x27; went through two stages. One school of thought postulates that there was only one Christianization: wishing to glorify his ancestor, Constantine simply ascribed to Basil the missionary triumphs of his predecessor, Michael III.

On the other hand, Constantine Zuckerman argues that, in response to the initial request of the Rus&#x27;, Photius (and Michael III) sent to the Rus&#x27; Khaganate a simple bishop. The pagans felt slighted at the low rank of the prelate and their Christian zeal evaporated. In September 867, Michael was assassinated by Basil, who (together with a new patriarch, Ignatius) sent to the Rus&#x27; an archbishop who propped up the religious fervor of the local leaders with rich presents. Parenthetically, the contemporaneous Christianization of Bulgaria was likewise effected in two stages: the Bulgars were offended when a simple bishop arrived to their capital from Constantinople and requested Pope Nicholas I to send them a higher-ranking church official. Such considerations were an important matter of political prestige. This pattern has parallels with the stories of Frankish historians about the multiple &quot;baptisms&quot; of the Norsemen, whose true intention was to get hold of the rich gifts accompanying the Christianization rituals.

The date and rationale for the Christianization are also shrouded in controversy. Grigory Litavrin views the event as &quot;a formal and diplomatic act making it easier to obtain advantageous agreements with the ruler of the Christian state.&quot; Zuckerman argues that Ignatius sent his archbishop to Rus&#x27; in about 870, while Dmitry Obolensky inclines to accept 874 as the date of the definitive Christianization.

== Tenth century ==
Whatever the scope of Photius&#x27;s efforts to Christianize the Rus&#x27;, their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by 944. In the Russo-Byzantine Treaty, preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus&#x27; swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke Perun and Veles after the pagan custom. The Kievan collegiate church of St. Elijah (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time.

Either in 945 or 957, the ruling regent, Olga of Kiev, visited Constantinople with a certain priest, Gregory. Her reception at the imperial court is described in &quot;De Ceremoniis&quot;. According to legends, Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII fell in love with Olga; however, she found a way to refuse him by tricking him into becoming her godfather. When she was baptized, she said it was inappropriate for a godfather to marry his goddaughter.

Although it is usually presumed that Olga was baptized in Constantinople rather than Kiev, there is no explicit mention of the sacrament, so neither version is excluded. Olga is also known to have requested a bishop and priests from Rome. Her son, Sviatoslav (r. 963–972), continued to worship Perun and other gods of the Slavic pantheon. He remained a stubborn pagan all of his life; according to the Primary Chronicle, he believed that his warriors would lose respect for him and mock him if he became a Christian.

Sviatoslav&#x27;s successor, Yaropolk I (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The &quot;Chronicon&quot; of Adémar de Chabannes and the life of St. Romuald (by Pietro Damiani) actually document the mission of St. Bruno of Querfurt to the land of Rus&#x27;, where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). Alexander Nazarenko suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk&#x27;s baptism according to the Latin form would have been suppressed by the later Eastern Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir&#x27;s image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.

== Conversion of Vladimir ==
== Baptism of Kiev ==

Returning to Kiev in triumph, Vladimir exhorted the residents of his capital to the Dnieper river for baptism. This mass baptism became the iconic inaugural event in the Christianization of the state of Kievan Rus&#x27;, and is sometimes called the Baptism of Rus&#x27;.

At first, Vladimir baptized his twelve sons and many boyars. He destroyed the wooden statues of Slavic pagan gods (which he had himself raised just eight years earlier). They were either burnt or hacked into pieces, and the statue of Perun — the supreme god — was thrown into the Dnieper.

Then Vladimir sent a message to all residents of Kiev, &quot;rich, and poor, and beggars, and slaves&quot;, to come to the river on the following day, lest they risk becoming the &quot;prince&#x27;s enemies&quot;. Large numbers of people came; some even brought infants with them. They were sent into the water while priests, who came from Chersonesos for the occasion, prayed.

To commemorate the event, Vladimir built the first stone church of Kievan Rus&#x27;, called the Church of the Tithes, where his body and the body of his new wife were to repose. Another church was built on top of the hill where pagan statues stood before.

== Aftermath ==

The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country. The Ioakim Chronicle says that Vladimir&#x27;s uncle, Dobrynya, forced the Novgorodians into Christianity &quot;by fire&quot;, while the local mayor, Putyata, persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith &quot;by the sword&quot;. At that same time, Bishop Ioakim Korsunianin built the first, wooden, Cathedral of Holy Wisdom &quot;with 13 tops&quot; on the site of a pagan cemetery.

Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the Upper Volga Uprising and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on Rostov, was particularly hostile to the new religion. Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.

The Christianization of Rus firmly allied it with the Byzantine Empire. The Greek learning and book culture was adopted in Kiev and other centres of the country. Churches started to be built on the Byzantine model. During the reign of Vladimir&#x27;s son Yaroslav I, Metropolitan Ilarion authored the first known work of East Slavic literature, an elaborate oration in which he favourably compared Rus to other lands known as the &quot;Sermon on Law and Grace&quot;. The Ostromir Gospels, produced in Novgorod during the same period, was the first dated East Slavic book fully preserved. But the only surviving work of lay literature, &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, indicates that a degree of pagan worldview remained under Christian Kievan Rus&#x27;.

In 1988, the faithful of the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox churches which have roots in the baptism of Kiev celebrated a millennium of Eastern Slavic Christianity. The great celebrations in Moscow changed the character of relationship between the Soviet state and the church. For the first time since 1917, numerous churches and monasteries were returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. In Ukrainian communities around the world, members of various Ukrainian churches also celebrated the Millennium of Christianity in Ukraine.

In 2008 the National Bank of Ukraine issued into circulation commemorative coins &quot;Christianization of Kievan Rus&quot; within &quot;Rebirth of the Christian Spirituality in Ukraine&quot; series.

In 2022, the traditional date of the holiday was granted the status of state public holiday in Ukraine under the title of Statehood Day.

<text>TICOM (Target Intelligence Committee) was a secret Allied project formed in World War II to find and seize German intelligence assets, particularly in the field of cryptology and signals intelligence.

It operated alongside other Western Allied efforts to extract German scientific and technological information and personnel during and after the war, including Operation Paperclip (for rocketry), Operation Alsos (for nuclear information) and Operation Surgeon (for avionics).

==History==
The project was initiated by the British, but when the US Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall learnt of it, it soon became Anglo-American. The aim was to seek out and capture the cryptologic secrets of Germany. The concept was for teams of cryptologic experts, mainly drawn from the code-breaking center at Bletchley Park, to enter Germany with the front-line troops and capture the documents, technology and personnel of the various German signal intelligence organizations before these precious secrets could be destroyed, looted, or captured by the Soviets. There were six such teams.
* Team 1 was tasked to capture German &quot;Geheimschreiber&quot; (secret writer) machines whose enciphered traffic was code named Fish
* Team 2 was to assist Team 1 with transporting Field Marshal Kesselring&#x27;s communications train to Britain (the so-called &quot;Jellyfish Convoy&quot;)
* Team 3 was to investigate an intact German Signals intelligence unit called &quot;Pers Z S&quot;
* Team 4 was to investigate in more detail the places in southern Germany that the Team 1 search had passed over quickly
* Team 5: Following the serendipitous discovery of a waterproof box containing some of the archives of the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht (OKW/&quot;Chi&quot;) on the bed of Lake Schliersee, this team was tasked with recovering anything else of value from that lake
* Team 6 aimed to capture and exploit material from the German Naval Intelligence Center and the German SIGINT headquarters

===OKW/&quot;Chi&quot; (High Command)===
The Allied supposition that the Supreme Command of the German Armed Forces, the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht Chiffrierabteilung&quot; (abbreviated OKW/Chi) was the German equivalent of Bletchley Park, was found to be incorrect. Despite it being the top SIGINT agency in the German military, it did not set policy and did not co-ordinate or direct the signal intelligence work of the different services. It concentrated instead on employing the best cryptanalysts to design Germany&#x27;s own secure communications systems, and to assist the individual services organisations. These were:
* The Army (&quot;Heer&quot;) OKH/GdNA, the &quot;Oberkommando des Heeres/General der Nachrichtenaufklärung&quot;
* Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) &quot;Chi Stelle&quot;
* Navy (&quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;) &quot;Beobachtungsdienst&quot; or &quot;B-Dienst&quot;
* Foreign Office &quot;Pers ZS&quot;
* Nazi Party &quot;Forschungsamt&quot; or &quot;FA&quot;

Drs Huttenhain and Fricke of OKW/&quot;Chi&quot; were requested to write about the methods of solution of the German machines. This covered the un-steckered Enigma, the steckered Enigmas; Hagelin B-36 and BC-38; the cipher teleprinters Siemens and Halske T52 a/b, T52/c; the Siemens SFM T43; and the Lorenz SZ 40, SZ42 a/b. They assumed Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle that how the machines worked would be known, and addressed only the solving of keys, not the breaking of the machines in the first place. This showed that, at least amongst the cryptographers, the un-steckered Enigma was clearly recognized as solvable. The Enigmas with the plugboard (&quot;Steckerbrett&quot;) were considered secure if used according to the instructions, but were less secure if stereotyped beginnings or routine phrases were used, or during the period of what they described as the &quot;faulty indicator technique&quot; - used up until May 1940. It was their opinion, however, that the steckered Enigma had never been solved.

===FA Discovery===
The discovery in May 1945 of the Nazi Party&#x27;s top secret FA signals intelligence and cryptanalytic agency at the Kaufbeuren Air Base in southern Bavaria came as a total surprise. The province of Luftwaffe chief Hermann Göring, it has been described as &quot;the richest, most secret, the most Nazi, and the most influential&quot; of all the German cryptanalytic intelligence agencies.

===Russian &quot;FISH&quot; Discovery===

The greatest success for TICOM was the capture of the &quot;Russian Fish&quot;, a set of German wide-band receivers used to intercept Soviet high-level radio teletype signals. On May 21, 1945, a party of TICOM Team 1 received tip that a German POW had knowledge of certain signals intelligence equipment and documentation relating Russian traffic. After identifying the remaining members of the unit, they were all taken back to their previous base at Rosenheim. The prisoners recovered about 7 ½ tons of equipment. One of the machines was re-assembled and demonstrated. TICOM officer 1st Lt. Paul Whitaker later reported. &quot;They were intercepting Russian traffic right while we were there…pretty soon they had shown us all we needed to see.&quot;

===Related efforts===
In Operation Stella Polaris the Finnish signals intelligence unit was evacuated to Sweden following the Finland/Soviet cease-fire in September 1944. The records, including cryptographic material, ended up in the hands of Americans.

<text>Being-in-itself is the self-contained and fully realized being of objects. It is a term used in early 20th century continental philosophy, especially in the works of Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and the existentialists.

==Being-in-itself for Heidegger==
In the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, Being-in-itself is contrasted with the being of persons, which he terms Dasein. &quot;Dasein means: care of the Being of beings as such that is ecstatically disclosed in care, not only of human Being...Dasein is &quot;itself&quot; by virtue of its essential &quot;relation to&quot; Being in general.&quot; Heidegger recognized the dangers inherent to talking about Being in general and particular beings, and thus devoted space in &quot;Being and Time&quot; and the &quot;Introduction to Metaphysics&quot; to an explication of the differences; often noted by translators who distinguish Being (Sein), from &quot;a&quot; being (das Seiende). His attention to the complication is helpful for those who are looking for detailed explanation, but rarely clears the air of confusions.

Dasein is Being which is aware of, and interested in, its own Being. Dasein is, by its nature, invested in social interaction and society. This is because in Heidegger&#x27;s metaphysical system, one of the most fundamental ways to understand Being is through relationships. All things stand in a relation to all other things — and by virtue of his stress on Dasein&#x27;s ontological distinction, things may also stand in relation to Dasein. The argument for this claim draws heavily on Hegel&#x27;s great work, the &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;. Essentially, Being in itself is one of Heidegger&#x27;s main concerns throughout his authorship. Despite Heidegger&#x27;s interest in it, he returns — more often than not indirectly — to the subject by interrogating other concepts that simply &quot;invoke&quot; Being without explicitly acknowledging it.

In other words, whereas Heidegger calls the being of persons &#x27;Dasein&#x27;, he determines &#x27;Being in itself&#x27; to be at the same time the most vague and general concept possible to contemplate, but also the topic of greatest interest to him as a philosopher.

==Being-in-itself for Sartre==
Being-in-itself refers to objects in the external world — a mode of existence that simply is. It is not conscious so it is neither active nor passive and harbors no potentiality for transcendence. This mode of being is relevant to inanimate objects, but not to humans, who Sartre says must always make a choice.

Sartre depicted a man in a café who has applied himself to a portrayal of his role as a waiter. The waiter thinks of himself as being a waiter (as in being-in-itself), which Sartre says is impossible since he cannot be a waiter in the sense that an inkwell is an inkwell. He is primarily a man (being-for-itself), just one who happens to be functioning as a waiter – with no fixed nature or essence, who is constantly recreating himself. He is guilty of focusing on himself as being-in-itself and not being-for-itself. Sartre would say that as a human, a being-for-itself by nature, the waiter is &quot;a being that is not what it is and it is what it is not.&quot; Therefore, the waiter who acts as if he is at his very core a waiter &quot;is not what [he] is&quot;- which is to say, he is not solely a waiter- and &quot;is what [he] is not&quot;- meaning that he is many things other than a waiter. In simply playing the part of a waiter, the man in this example is reducing himself to a &quot;being-in-itself&quot; and is therefore in bad faith.

<text>Trial trenching is a rapid and relatively inexpensive method of archaeological evaluation used to estimate the archaeological potential of a site.

== Method ==
Trenches are located at intervals across a site leaving the rest untouched. A mechanical excavator is used to dig down to archaeological features or natural geological deposits and any archaeology is recorded. No further excavation takes place at this stage. The results of the trial trenching are used to inform any future stage of work which may extend to full excavation of the rest of the site if the evaluation reveals significant finds.

In the UK the results of the trial trenching will be used to inform the decision on the need for any further archaeological work to be undertaken prior to development. This process is enshrined in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).

=== Sampling strategy ===
There is some argument over the sampling strategy to be employed in trial trenching, especially in evaluating sites that are intended for development. Issues such as the effectiveness of certain trench layouts or the percentage of the site to be dug (normally around 5% at present) are widely discussed. Whether an effective picture of past human activity on a site can be truly estimated through this methods is widely debated. Development can destroy buried archaeology forever and a reliable evaluation methodology is very important. Whilst it is difficult to quantify the number of false negative results there have certainly been examples of evaluations suggesting a relatively limited amount of past activity which has had to be upwardly revised during the excavation.

<text>William Thomas Stead (5 July 184915 April 1912) was an English newspaper editor who, as a pioneer of investigative journalism, became a controversial figure of the Victorian era. Stead published a series of hugely influential campaigns whilst editor of &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, including his 1885 series of articles, &quot;The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon&quot;. These were written in support of a bill, later dubbed the &quot;Stead Act&quot;, that raised the age of consent from 13 to 16.

Stead&#x27;s &quot;new journalism&quot; paved the way for the modern tabloid in Great Britain. He has been described as &quot;the most famous journalist in the British Empire&quot;. He is considered to have influenced how the press could be used to influence public opinion and government policy, and advocated &quot;Government by Journalism&quot;. He was known for his reportage on child welfare, social legislation and reformation of England&#x27;s criminal codes.

Stead died in the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.

==Early life==

Stead was born in Embleton, Northumberland on 5 July 1849, the son of the Reverend William Stead, a poor and respected Congregational minister, and Isabella (née Jobson), a cultivated daughter of a Northumberland farmer, John Jobson of Warkworth. A year later the family moved to Howdon on the River Tyne, where his younger brother, Francis Herbert Stead, was born. Stead was largely educated at home by his father, and by the age of five he was already well-versed in the Holy Scriptures and is said to have been able to read Latin almost as well as he could read English. It was Stead&#x27;s mother who perhaps had the most lasting influence on her son&#x27;s career. One of Stead&#x27;s favourite childhood memories was of his mother leading a local campaign against the government&#x27;s controversial Contagious Diseases Acts – which required prostitutes living in garrison towns to undergo medical examination.

From 1862 to 1864, he attended Silcoates School in Wakefield until he was apprenticed to a merchant&#x27;s office on the Quayside in Newcastle upon Tyne, where he became a clerk.

==&quot;The Northern Echo&quot;==
Stead contributed articles to the fledgling liberal Darlington newspaper &quot;The Northern Echo&quot; from 1870 and despite his inexperience was appointed editor of the newspaper in 1871. Aged just 22 Stead was the youngest newspaper editor in the country. Stead used Darlington&#x27;s excellent railway connections to his advantage, increasing the newspaper&#x27;s distribution to national levels. Stead was always guided by a moral mission, influenced by his faith, and wrote to a friend that the position would be &quot;a glorious opportunity of attacking the devil&quot;.

In 1873 he married his childhood sweetheart, Emma Lucy Wilson, the daughter of a local merchant and shipowner; they would eventually have six children. In 1876 Stead joined a campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Act, befriending the feminist Josephine Butler. The law was repealed in 1886.

He gained notoriety in 1876 for his coverage of the Bulgarian atrocities agitation. He is also credited as &quot;a major factor&quot; in helping William Ewart Gladstone win an overwhelming majority in the 1880 general election.

==&quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;==
Stead was appointed assistant editor of the Liberal &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; (a forerunner of the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;) in 1880, and he helped transform a traditionally conservative newspaper &quot;written by gentlemen for gentlemen&quot;. When its editor, John Morley, was elected to Parliament, Stead took over the role (1883–1889). When Morley was made Secretary of State for Ireland, Gladstone asked the new cabinet minister if he were confident that he could deal with that most distressful country. Morley replied that, if he could manage Stead, he could manage anything.

Over the next seven years Stead would develop what Matthew Arnold dubbed &quot;The New Journalism&quot;. His innovations as editor of the &quot;Gazette&quot; included incorporating maps and diagrams into a newspaper, breaking up longer articles with eye-catching subheadings and blending his own opinions with those of the people he interviewed. He made a feature of the &quot;Pall Mall&quot; extras, and his enterprise and originality exercised a potent influence on contemporary journalism and politics. Stead&#x27;s first sensational campaign was based on a Nonconformist pamphlet, &quot;The Bitter Cry of Outcast London&quot;. His lurid stories of squalid life in the slums had a wholly beneficial effect on the capital. A Royal Commission recommended that the government should clear the slums and encourage low-cost housing in their place. It was Stead&#x27;s first success. He also pioneered the use of the interview in British journalism—although other interviews had appeared in British papers before—with his interview with General Gordon in 1884.

In 1884 Stead pressured the government to send his friend General Gordon to the Sudan to protect British interests in Khartoum. The eccentric Gordon disobeyed orders, and the siege of Khartoum, Gordon&#x27;s death and the failure of the hugely expensive Gordon Relief Expedition amounted to one of the great imperial disasters of the period. After General Gordon&#x27;s death in Khartoum in January 1885, Stead ran the first 24-point headline in newspaper history, ‘TOO LATE!’, bemoaning the relief force&#x27;s failure to rescue a national hero.

During the following year he managed to persuade the British government to supply an additional £5.5 million to bolster weakening naval defences, after which he published a series of articles. Stead was not a hawk, instead believing Britain&#x27;s strong navy was necessary to maintain world peace. He distinguished himself in his vigorous handling of public affairs and his brilliant modernity in the presentation of news. However he is also credited with originating the modern journalistic technique of creating a news event rather than just reporting it, as his most famous ‘investigation’, the Eliza Armstrong case, was to demonstrate.

In 1886 he began a campaign against Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet, over his nominal exoneration in the Crawford scandal. The campaign ultimately contributed to Dilke&#x27;s misguided attempt to clear his name and his consequent ruin. Stead employed Virginia Crawford, and she developed a career as a journalist and writer, researching for other Stead authors, but never wrote on her own case or Dilke in any way.

===Eliza Armstrong case===

In 1885, in the wake of Josephine Butler&#x27;s fight for the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts, Stead entered upon a crusade against child prostitution by publishing a series of four articles entitled ‘The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon’. As part of his investigation he arranged the ‘purchase’ of Eliza Armstrong, the 13-year-old daughter of a chimney sweep. In his subsequent articles Stead referred to Eliza as 
&quot;Lily.&quot; Her real name came out during Stead&#x27;s trial for procuring. 

The first of his four articles was trailed with a warning guaranteed to make the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; sell out. Copies changed hands for 20 times their original value and the office was besieged by 10,000 members of the public. The popularity of the articles was so great that the &quot;Gazette&quot;&#x27;s supply of paper ran out and had to be replenished with supplies from the rival &quot;Globe&quot;.

Though his action is thought to have furthered the passing of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, his successful demonstration of the existence of the trade led to his conviction for abduction and a three-month term of imprisonment at Coldbath Fields and Holloway prisons. He was convicted on technical grounds that he had failed to first secure permission for the ‘purchase’ from the girl&#x27;s father.

The ‘Maiden Tribute’ campaign was the high point in Stead&#x27;s career in daily journalism. The series inspired George Bernard Shaw to write &quot;Pygmalion&quot; and to name his lead character Eliza. Another of the characters described, the ‘Minotaur of London’, has been suggested as having inspired &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot;.

==&quot;Review of Reviews&quot; and other ventures==
Stead resigned his editorship of the &quot;Pall Mall&quot; in 1889 in order to found the &quot;Review of Reviews&quot; (1890) with Sir George Newnes. It was a highly successful non-partisan monthly. The journal found a global audience and was intended to bind the empire together by synthesising all its best journalism. Stead&#x27;s abundant energy and facile pen found scope in many other directions in journalism of an advanced humanitarian type. This time saw Stead &quot;at the very height of his professional prestige&quot;, according to E. T. Raymond. He was the first editor to employ female journalists.

Stead lived in Chicago for six months in 1893-4, campaigning against brothels and drinking dens, and published &quot;If Christ Came to Chicago&quot;.

Beginning in 1895, Stead issued affordable reprints of classic literature under such titles as &quot;The Penny Poets&quot; and &quot;Penny Popular Novels&quot;, in which he &quot;boil[ed] down the great novels of the world so that they might fit into, say, sixty-four pages instead of six hundred&quot;. His ethos behind the venture pre-dated Allen Lane&#x27;s Penguin Books by nearly forty years, and he became &quot;the foremost publisher of paperbacks in the Victorian Age&quot;. In 1896, Stead launched the series &quot;Books for the Bairns&quot;, whose titles included fairy tales and works of classical literature.

Stead became an enthusiastic supporter of the peace movement, and of many other movements, popular and unpopular, in which he impressed the public generally as an extreme visionary, though his practical energy was recognised by a considerable circle of admirers and pupils. Stead was a pacifist and a campaigner for peace, who favoured a &quot;United States of Europe&quot; and a &quot;High Court of Justice among the nations&quot; (an early version of the United Nations), yet he also preferred the use of force in the defence of law. He extensively covered the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907; for the latter he printed a daily paper during the four-month conference. He has a bust at the Peace Palace in The Hague. As a result of these activities, Stead was repeatedly nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

With all his unpopularity, and all the suspicion and opposition engendered by his methods, his personality remained a forceful one, in both public and private life. He was an early imperial idealist, whose influence on Cecil Rhodes in South Africa remained of primary importance; many politicians and statesmen, who on most subjects were completely at variance with his ideas, nevertheless owed something to them. Rhodes made him his confidant, and was inspired in his will by his suggestions; and Stead was intended to be one of Rhodes&#x27;s executors. However, at the time of the Second Boer War Stead threw himself into the Boer cause and attacked the government with characteristic violence, and consequently his name was removed from the will&#x27;s executors.

The number of his publications gradually became very large, as he wrote with facility and sensationalist fervour on all sorts of subjects, from &quot;The Truth about Russia&quot; (1888) to &quot;If Christ Came to Chicago!&quot; (Laird &amp; Lee, 1894), and from &quot;Mrs Booth&quot; (1900) to &quot;The Americanisation of the World&quot; (1901).

Stead was an Esperantist, and often supported Esperanto in a monthly column in &quot;Review of Reviews&quot;.

In 1904 he launched &quot;The Daily Paper&quot;, which folded after six weeks, and Stead lost £35,000 of his own money (almost £3 million in 2012 value) and suffered a nervous breakdown.

==Meeting with William Randolph Hearst==
A year before the Spanish–American War W. T. Stead travelled to New York to meet William Randolph Hearst, to teach him government by journalism.

==Travel to Russia==
In 1905 Stead travelled to Russia to try to discourage violence during the Russian Revolution, but his tour and talks were unsuccessful.

==Spiritualism==
In the 1890s, Stead became increasingly interested in spiritualism. In 1893, he founded a spiritualist quarterly, &quot;Borderland&quot;, in which he gave full play to his interest in psychical research. Stead was editor, and he employed Ada Goodrich Freer as assistant editor; she was also a substantial contributor under the pseudonym &quot;Miss X&quot;. Stead claimed that he was in the habit of communicating with Freer by telepathy and automatic writing. The magazine ceased publication in 1897.

Stead claimed to be in receipt of messages from the spirit world and, in 1892, to be able to produce automatic writing. His spirit contact was alleged to be the departed Julia A. Ames, an American temperance reformer and journalist whom he met in 1890 shortly before her death. In 1909, he established &quot;Julia&#x27;s Bureau&quot;, where inquirers could obtain information about the spirit world from a group of resident mediums.

Grant Richards said that &quot;The thing that operated most strongly in lessening Stead&#x27;s hold on the general public was his absorption in spiritualism&quot;.

The physiologist Ivor Lloyd Tuckett wrote that Stead had no scientific training and was credulous when it came to the subject of spiritualism. Tuckett examined a case of spirit photography that Stead had claimed was genuine. Stead visited a photographer who produced a photograph of him with an alleged deceased soldier known as &quot;Piet Botha&quot;. Stead claimed the photographer could not have come across any information about Piet Botha; however, Tuckett discovered that an article in 1899 had been published on Pietrus Botha in a weekly magazine with a portrait and personal details.

In the early 20th century, Arthur Conan Doyle and Stead were duped into believing that the stage magicians Julius and Agnes Zancig had genuine psychic powers. Both Doyle and Stead wrote the Zancigs performed telepathy. In 1924 Julius and Agnes Zancig confessed that their mind reading act was a trick and published the secret code and all the details of the trick method they had used under the title of &quot;Our Secrets!!&quot; in a London newspaper.

Ten years after the &quot;Titanic&quot; went down, Stead&#x27;s daughter Estelle published &quot;The Blue Island: Experiences of a New Arrival Beyond the Veil,&quot; which purported to be a communication with Stead via a medium, Pardoe Woodman. In the book, Stead described his death at sea and discussed the nature of the afterlife. The manuscript was produced using automatic writing, and Ms. Stead cited as proof of its authenticity the writer&#x27;s habit of going back to cross &quot;t&#x27;s&quot; and dot &quot;i&#x27;s&quot; while proof-reading, which she said was characteristic of her father&#x27;s writing technique in life.

==Death on the &quot;Titanic&quot;==
Stead boarded the &quot;Titanic&quot; for a visit to the United States to take part in a peace congress at Carnegie Hall at the request of President William Howard Taft. Survivors of the &quot;Titanic&quot; reported very little about Stead&#x27;s last hours. He chatted enthusiastically through the 11-course meal that fateful night, telling thrilling tales (including one about the cursed mummy of the British Museum), but then retired to bed at 10.30 pm. After the ship struck the iceberg, Stead helped several women and children into the lifeboats, in an act &quot;typical of his generosity, courage, and humanity&quot;, and gave his life jacket to another passenger.

A later sighting of Stead, by survivor Philip Mock, has him clinging to a raft with John Jacob Astor IV. &quot;Their feet became frozen&quot;, reported Mock, &quot;and they were compelled to release their hold. Both were drowned.&quot; Stead&#x27;s body was not recovered.

Stead had often claimed that he would die from either lynching or drowning. He had published two pieces that gained greater significance in light of his fate on the &quot;Titanic&quot;. On 22 March 1886, he published an article titled &quot;How the Mail Steamer went down in Mid Atlantic by a Survivor&quot;, wherein a steamer collides with another ship, resulting in a high loss of life due to an insufficient ratio of lifeboats to passengers. Stead had added: &quot;This is exactly what might take place and will take place if liners are sent to sea short of boats&quot;. In 1892, Stead published a story titled &quot;From the Old World to the New&quot;, in which a vessel, the &quot;Majestic&quot;, rescues survivors of another ship that collided with an iceberg.

== Reputation ==
Following his death, Stead was widely hailed as the greatest newspaperman of his age. His friend Viscount Milner eulogised Stead as &quot;a ruthless fighter, who had always believed himself to be &#x27;on the side of angels&#x27;&quot;.

His sheer energy helped to revolutionise the often stuffy world of Victorian journalism, while his blend of sensationalism and indignation set the tone for British tabloids. Like many journalists, he was a curious mixture of conviction, opportunism and sheer humbug. According to his biographer W. Sydney Robinson, &quot;He twisted facts, invented stories, lied, betrayed confidences, but always with a genuine desire to reform the world – and himself.&quot; According to Dominic Sandbrook, &quot;Stead&#x27;s papers forced his readers to confront the seedy underbelly of their own civilisation, but the editor probably knew more about that dark world than he ever let on. He held up a mirror to Victorian society, yet deep down, like so many tabloid crusaders, he was raging at his own reflection.&quot;

According to Roy Hattersley, Stead became &quot;the most sensational figure in 19th-century journalism&quot;.

A memorial bronze was erected in Central Park, New York City, in 1920. It reads, &quot;W. T. Stead 1849–1912. This tribute to the memory of a journalist of worldwide renown is erected by American friends and admirers. He met death aboard the &quot;Titanic&quot; April 15, 1912, and is numbered amongst those who, dying nobly, enabled others to live.&quot; A duplicate bronze is located on the Thames Embankment not far from Temple, where Stead had an office.

A memorial plaque to Stead can also be seen at his final home, 5 Smith Square, where he lived from 1904 to 1912. It was unveiled on 28 June 2004 in the presence of his great-great-grandson, 13-year-old Miles Stead. The plaque was sponsored by the Stead Memorial Society.

In his native Embleton, a road has been named &quot;W T Stead Road&quot;.

In his adopted Darlington a pub is named in his honour in the town centre.

In the 2009 video game &quot;Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors&quot;, Stead&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;How the Mail Steamer Went Down in Mid Atlantic by a Survivor&quot;, &quot;From the Old World to the New&quot; and his death on the &quot;Titanic&quot; are discussed by Akane Kurashiki and Junpei, who debate the possibility that Stead was undergoing automatic writing by connecting to his future self.

===Archives===
Fourteen boxes of Stead&#x27;s papers are held at the Churchill Archives Centre in Cambridge. The bulk of this collection comprises Stead&#x27;s letters from his many correspondents, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, William Gladstone and Christabel Pankhurst. There are also papers and a diary relating to his time spent in Holloway Prison in 1885 and to his many publications.

Stead&#x27;s papers are also held at The Women&#x27;s Library at the Library of the London School of Economics,

Charles Barker Howdill (1863–1941) took a colour photograph of Stead &quot;finished in 12 minutes&quot; on 17 January 1912, about three months before Stead&#x27;s death. It is now in the collections of Leeds Museums and Galleries.

<text>Butrus al-Bustani (, ; 1819–1883) was a writer and scholar from present day Lebanon. He was a major figure in the Nahda, which began in Egypt in the late 19th century and spread to the Middle East.

He is considered to be the first Syrian nationalist, due to his publication of &quot;Nafir Suriyya&quot; which began following the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war. He founded the secular Arabic- language &quot;al-madrasa al-wataniyya&quot; (the National School) in 1863 in Beirut. In 1870, he founded &quot;Al-Jinan&quot;, the first important example of the kind of literary and scientific periodicals which began to appear in the 1870s in Arabic alongside the independent political newspapers.

==Life==
Al-Bustani was born to a Maronite Christian family in the village of Dibbiye in the Chouf region of Lebanon, his family traced its roots to the district of Gable, in present-day Syria. In January 1819. He received primary education in the village school, where he attracted the attention of his teacher, Father Mikhail al-Bustani, because of his keen intelligence that he showed brilliantly.

The latter recommended him to the Bishop of Sidon and Beiteddine, Abdullah al-Bustani, who sent him at the age of 11 to the school at ‘Ayn Warqa in Ghosta, the most famous school of that period, to continue his studies there. At ‘Ayn Warqa where he learned Syriac and Latin. He spent ten years there and learned several foreign languages including French, Italian and English.

In 1840, after completing his studies at ‘Ayn Warqa’, Al-Bustani moved to Beirut and obtained his first employment outside of academia as a dragoman for the British Armed Forces assisting them in their efforts to evict Ibrahim Pasha from Syria in the interest of preserving the Ottoman Empire. Later that year al-Bustani was hired by American Protestant Missionaries as a teacher and from that point on he worked closely with the Protestant mission in Beirut.

In Beirut, he came into contact with the American Protestant missionaries with whom he worked closely until his death on May 1, 1883. Following his initial employment with the American Protestant Mission in Beirut al-Bustani spent most of his years working for the American Protestant Mission. It was during these years that al-Bustani converted to their Protestant faith and completed many of his early works. Arabic grammar and arithmetic books were among these early works along with the Van Dyck&#x27;s version of the Bible, the most popular Arabic translation of the Bible used today. Both al-Bustani and Nasif Al-Yaziji worked on Van Dyck&#x27;s version under the supervision of Eli Smith who was an American Protestant Missionary, scholar and Yale graduate. The translation project was continued unto fruition after al-Bustani under Cornelius Van Allen Van Dyck. While working to translate the Bible, Al-Bustani learned Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, and perfected Syriac and Latin thus bringing the number of languages he mastered to nine.

He was married to Rahil Ata (1826–1894) who is called mother of the Nahda movement. They had nine children, four boys and five girls. Their first child was Sarah who was born on 3 April 1844. Their second child was Salim who worked with his father in various activities. Their last child, Alice, was born in 1870. One of their daughters married Khalid Sarkis who was the founder of the &quot;Lisan al Hal&quot; newspaper. The family lived in the Zuqaq al-Blat neighbourhood in Beirut in the 1860s.

==Role in the Nahda==

In the late 1840s, al-Bustani obtained the position of the official dragoman for the American Consulate in Beirut which he held until he passed it on to his son Salim in 1862. Through the 1850s Bustani continued to work closely with the Protestant Missionaries in their attempt of proselytizing and educating Arab Christians in the Levant. However, at this time al-Bustani began to diverge from the Missionaries&#x27; method of education and began to express publicly the need for an Arabic identity that would be reflected in all spheres of society. In a lecture, “on the literature of the Arabs”, given in February 1859 al-Bustani publicly called for a revival of literature and scholarly works in the Arabic language. It was also in 1859 that al-Bustani disengaged from his work with the mission and devoted his time to this cause. Shortly after his lecture in Beirut in 1859, al-Bustani became the secretary of a cultural association for the publication of Arabic books, al-Umda’ al-Arabiyya l-Ishar al-Kutub al-Arabiyya. It was al-Bustani&#x27;s exodus from religious education and move towards secular, national education at this time that revolutionized Arab culture and set the stage for the Nahda.

Following the Maronite/Druze civil war of Mount Lebanon in 1860, al-Bustani, having witnessed these political/religious tensions, published an irregular newspaper which he called Nafir Suriyya (a Clarion of Syria), wherein he voiced his ideal of a Syrian fatherland. Along with instilling Syrian Patriotism and “proto-nationalism”, Al-Bustani sought to reform education and so founded the madrasah al-Wataniyya in Beirut in 1863, his own National School in Lebanon where he applied his theories on education, namely his educational agenda. The National School educated its students in Arabic, French, English, Turkish, Latin and Greek and modern sciences without the pretense of religion but with an obvious nationalistic aim. Al-Bustani welcomed students from all religions and races and qualified staff not based on their religious standing but on their competence and professional qualities. The school was successful because it was unique in Syria at the time as being an educational institution based on secular ideals of equality and non-discrimination and thus stood against the religious schools that were closed off to the modern world. However, the rising religious solidarity in Syria eventually led to it being closed in 1878.

It was during the proceeding years throughout the 1860s that his major contributions to the Nahda emerged. These included a daily newspaper and the first Arabic encyclopedia Muhit al-Muhit (The Ocean of Oceans) and an Arabic dictionary dairat al-ma’arif (dictionary of knowledge). Al-Bustani&#x27;s intention in these works was to form a common body of knowledge which, though very French, was considered universal. It was at this time that he came to be known famously as the Master and Father of the Arabic Renaissance. The greater part of his life&#x27;s work was reviving and creating a love for the Arabic language, bringing Arabic into a place of affluence and utility as a tool for Arabs to express their thoughts and ideas in the modernising world of the 19th century. He believed that openness towards European scientific discoveries would help the Middle East to take its proper position in the world. In 1868, al-Bustani helped found the Syrian Scientific Society al-Ja’miyya al-Ilmiyya al-Suriyya, a group of intellectuals who would be a part of promoting the study of science in educational institutions in Syria.

Al-Bustani made large strides in forging a nationalism for Arabs by adopting and contextualizing European political and social values and education while maintaining a distinct nationalism, patriotism and Arab identity. All of this was to the advancement and continuation of the Arab cultural and literary renaissance at large that moved from Egypt to Syria/Lebanon. The reforms in the Ottoman Empire (see Tanzimat) from 1839–1876 and the work of the Young Ottomans strongly influenced al-Bustani to see that “Ottomanism” was the best means of achieving nationalism politically being that it was the closest model available for him in Syria and in particular it was a Romantic nationalism, whereby one must recreate or recover a culture by looking into the past. In Al-Bustani&#x27;s case, he looked to the scientific revolution in the Golden Age of Islam under the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad (8th to 13th century A.D.) He argued that at that time, Europe was in the decline of the Dark Ages and that Arabs must once again reclaim that heritage. However, it wasn&#x27;t an Islamic heritage Bustani was after for he was a secularist. Though a Protestant Christian, he did not seek religious reform but rather a reform similar to what the French had with the separation of the Church institutions from the State institutions. It was this very separation that was key for the European Renaissance and al-Bustani saw the same need for the Nahda. Al-Bustani viewed the edicts of the Young Ottomans as freedom for non-Muslims and an opportunity for Arabs in Syria to gain sovereignty. Thus politically, he helped Syria towards Ottomanism in the sense that the edicts allowed participation of citizens of the state regardless of religious affiliation.

Education, for Bustani, was the main vehicle to achieve an Arab identity and nationalism and it was only by the mass production of literature and its speedy circuit throughout the Middle East, afforded by the Nahda, that such an identity could be formed. Al-Bustani&#x27;s years in the Protestant Mission led him to be at odds with educating a people about remote places and histories clearly seen in a quote from a lecture of his on education, &quot;there should be one educational system for (all) the children of the nation (‘Umma), to safeguard its (cultural) identity. Thus in the realm of education, Bustani helped pave the way for a distinctly Arab education. His national/secular educational agenda in the midst of religious education was paramount to Syria&#x27;s development. Al-Bustani&#x27;s contributions to Arab language and literature and his creation of a medium and structure to spread his ideas and the ideas of other intellectuals in Syria led to great reforms of literature and moreover created a common body of knowledge for the Arab, a body that was a pre-requisite to modernity and Arab and also, some state, Syrian nationalism. Butrus al-Bustani stands among the reformers who helped push the Middle East into modernity without seeing the reform as primarily Islamic. For he took a non-sectarian approach and worked to bring together both Christians and Muslims into the greater agenda of the revolution of Arab identity and culture.

==Achievements==
In the social, national and political spheres, he founded associations intending to form a national élite and launched a series of appeals for unity in his magazine Nafir Suriya.

In the educational field, he taught in the schools of the Protestant missionaries at ‘Abey before founding his own National School in 1863 on secular principles. At the same time, he compiled and published several school textbooks and dictionaries to become known famously as the Master and Father of the Arabic Renaissance.

Al-Bustani compiled an Arabic dictionary and published eleven volumes of an Arabic encyclopedia with the help of his sons. He wished to spread awareness and appreciation for the Arabic language, hoping to promote the cultural significance of the Middle East in the modern world.

In the cultural/scientific fields, he published a fortnightly review and two daily newspapers. In addition, he began work, together with Drs Eli Smith and Cornelius Van Dyck of the American Mission, on a translation of the Bible into Arabic known as the Smith-Van Dyke translation. As an alternative to the Ottoman state schools and the missionary schools he founded the National School in Beirut, which offered secular education in the Arabic language. in Beirut.

His prolific output and groundbreaking work led to the creation of modern Arabic expository prose. While educated by Westerners and a strong advocate of Western technology, he was a fierce secularist, playing a decisive role in formulating the principles of Syrian nationalism (not to be confused with Arab nationalism).

Stephen Sheehi states that al-Bustani&#x27;s &quot;importance does not lay in his prognosis of Arab culture or his national pride. Nor is his advocacy of discriminately adopting Western knowledge and technology to &#x27;awaken&#x27; the Arabs’ inherent ability for cultural success (najah) unique among his generation. Rather, his contribution lies in the act of elocution. That is, his writing articulates a specific formula for native progress that expresses a synthetic vision of the matrix of modernity within Ottoman Syria.&quot;

<doc id="604636" wikidata="Q582152" url="?curid=604636" title="Yuri Vizbor">
<text>Yuri Iosifovich Vizbor (June 20, 1934September 17, 1984) was a Soviet bard and poet as well as a theatre and film actor.

Vizbor was born in Moscow where he lived for most of his life. He worked as a teacher, a soldier, a sailor, a radio and press correspondent, a ski instructor, and an actor in many Russian films and plays. He participated in and documented expeditions to remote areas of the Soviet Union. His compositions included songs, poetic prose, plays, screenplays and short stories.

==Early years==
Vizbor&#x27;s father, a commander in the Red Army, was of Lithuanian descent. His family name was originally Vizbaras. His mother was an ethnic Ukrainian from Krasnodar. In 1937, his father fell victim to Stalin&#x27;s purges. In 1941, Yuri and his mother moved to Siberia. This period influenced the artist&#x27;s distaste for politics and his fascination with the wilderness.

In 1951, he graduated from high school and after several failed attempts to start studies in several high-ranking universities (he was denied the place as the &quot;son of the enemy of the People&quot;) was accepted as a student of the Moscow State Pedagogical Institute. It was here that he wrote his first song, entitled &quot;Madagascar&quot;.

==Professional activities==
After graduating with a degree in Russian language and literature in 1955, Vizbor worked as a teacher in Arkhangelsk. In 1957 he was conscripted to the army where he worked as a radio operator. He married in 1958. In the late 1950s and early 1960s Vizbor began to acquire fame as a songwriter by circulating homemade tapes.

Vizbor is often compared with his contemporaries, Vladimir Vysotsky and Bulat Okudzhava. The topics of Vizbor&#x27;s songs were observational, focusing on his love of nature and of travel. By using his extremely varied professions as a template, Vizbor attempted to document various aspects of &quot;normal life&quot; at the height of Brezhnev&#x27;s era of stagnation. His trademark was a relaxed singing style that often sounded on the verge of laughter. Vizbor recorded songs with a traditional Russian seven-string guitar that was often slightly out of tune.

While most Russian bards relied on a rhythmic strumming pattern as the basis for their musical accompaniment, Vizbor was fond of a slow plucking style epitomized by songs such as &quot;Fanskie Gory&quot;. His best-known tune was a romantic ballad called &quot;Milaya Moya&quot; or &quot;My Dear.&quot; On a more somber note, his song &quot;Seryoga Sanin&quot; told the story of a free spirited friend who dies tragically.

==Illness and death==
In March 1984, Vizbor wrote his last song, having written over 250 of them during the past thirty-three years. His poetry had also been set to music by numerous musicians. His last writings were letters to his daughter from his sickbed while he lay dying of liver cancer from April to September 1984.

==Filmography==
==Legacy==
A minor planet 3260 Vizbor discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova in 1974 is named after him.

<doc id="604651" wikidata="Q472716" url="?curid=604651" title="Engaged Buddhism">
<text>Engaged Buddhism, also known as socially engaged Buddhism, refers to a Buddhist social movement that emerged in Asia in the 20th century. It is composed of Buddhists who seek to apply Buddhist ethics, insights acquired from meditation practice, and the teachings of the Buddhist dharma to contemporary situations of social, political, environmental, and economic suffering, and injustice.

Modern engaged Buddhism emerged in Vietnam in the 1950s, from the teachings of Thiền Buddhist teacher Thích Nhất Hạnh. It was popularised by the Indian jurist, politician, and social reformer B. R. Ambedkar, who inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement in the 1950s. It has since spread to the Indian subcontinent and the West.

During the 1960s, the terms &quot;engaged Buddhism&quot; and &quot;socially engaged Buddhism&quot; were taken up by loosely-connected networks of Buddhists in Asia and the West to describe their adaptation of Buddhist values and ethical conduct to social and political activism. This included a range of non-violent social and political activities such as peacemaking, promotion of human rights, environmental protection, rural development, combatting ethnic violence, opposition to warfare, and support of women&#x27;s rights. With globalisation and technological advancement, engaged Buddhist organisations and efforts have spread across the globe; an example is the Buddhist Peace Fellowship.

== Origins ==
Vietnamese Thiền Buddhist teacher Thích Nhất Hạnh coined the term &quot;Engaged Buddhism&quot; in his collection of articles, &quot;A Fresh Look at Buddhism&quot;. Engaged Buddhism emerged from a need to respond to world crises, particularly the Vietnam War. The term was new, but Buddhism that engages with social and political issues had already occurred throughout the world.

Nhất Hạnh was inspired by the humanistic Buddhism reform movement in China led by Taixu and Yinshun and later propagated in Taiwan by Cheng Yen and Hsing Yun. At first, Nhất Hạnh described the concept by using Literary Chinese, the liturgical language of Vietnamese Buddhism, calling it . During the Vietnam War, he and his sangha (spiritual community) responded to the suffering around them, in part by adopting the nonviolence activism techniques of Mahatma Gandhi in India and of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States. They saw this work as part of their meditation and mindfulness practice, not as something apart from it.

As early as 1946, Walpola Rahula identified an explicit social ethos present in the earliest recorded Buddhist teachings. He noted that the Buddha encouraged early monks to travel in order to benefit the largest number of people, and that his discourses to lay people often included practical instructions on social and economic matters, rather than being purely concerned with philosophical or soteriological concerns.

== Teachings ==
Engaged Buddhism applies the teachings of the Buddha to social life in order to bring about social change. Engaged Buddhists hope to connect traditional Buddhist beliefs to protest and social action. One way to view Engaged Buddhism is through Thích Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s &quot;The Fourteen Precepts of Engaged Buddhism&quot;, which serve as guidelines for living with a stronger social awareness:
B. R. Ambedkar also advocated for a type of Engaged Buddhism to inspire social change and provide dignity and humanity to himself and his community. Ambedkar&#x27;s principles the commitment to Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, which stemmed from the Buddha&#x27;s philosophy.

== In India ==
In India, a form of engaged Buddhism founded by B.R. Ambedkar started as a Buddhist revival movement called the Dalit Buddhist movement. Ambedkar&#x27;s socially engaged Buddhism focuses on economic justice, political freedom, and moral striving. Ambedkar converted to Buddhism in 1956 and initiated what is called Ambedkar Buddhism, when in October 1956 in Nagpur, nearly 400,000 Dalits converted from Hinduism. His book &quot;The Buddha and His Dhamma&quot; was published in 1957, after his death.

Buddhist teachings invite us to take responsibility for ourselves, and engaged Buddhists interpret this as taking responsibility for the entire sangha, the larger community, and our ecosystem. Ambedkar warns that if we spend too much time in personal meditation practice, in retreat from social relationships, we will be irresponsible to our community. So we need to get off the cushion, get out of the house, get out there and start to educate, agitate, and organise. This is a collectivist notion of sangha as people working together for a society of justice, wherein Buddhist practice becomes the engaged activity of social change.

== Socially engaged Buddhism in the West ==
In the West, like the East, engaged Buddhism attempts to link authentic Buddhist practice—particularly mindfulness—with social action. It has two main centers: the Plum Village monastic community in Loubes-Bernac, France and the Community of Mindful Living in Berkeley, California. Both centers are tied to Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s Unified Buddhist Church.

The current Dalai Lama also encouraged Buddhists to be more involved in the socio-political realm: 

===Organisations===

Many organisations were established to help build the movement of engaged Buddhists. These include the Soka Gakkai International, Buddhist Peace Fellowship, Buddhist Global Relief, the International Network of Engaged Buddhists, the Zen Peacemakers, and the Order of Interbeing. Other engaged Buddhist groups include the Benevolent Organisation for Development, Health and Insight, Gaden Relief Projects, Earthworks Centre foundation, the UK&#x27;s Network of Buddhist Organisations, Fo Guang Shan, and Tzu Chi.

The School of Youth for Social Service was established by Nhất Hạnh in 1964. It trained social workers through the teachings of Engaged Buddhism. Members of the school helped relieve suffering and rebuild villages for those affected by the Vietnam War.

===Notable figures===

Prominent figures in the movement include Robert Aitken Roshi, Joanna Macy, Gary Snyder, Alan Senauke, Sulak Sivaraksa, Daisaku Ikeda, Maha Ghosananda, Sylvia Wetzel, Joan Halifax, Tara Brach, Taigen Dan Leighton, Ken Jones, Jan Willis, Bhante Sujato, Bhikkhu Bodhi, and Ajahn Buddhadasa.

<text>The Bank of Spain (, ) is Spain&#x27;s central bank and the Spanish member of the Eurosystem and has been the monetary authority for Spain from 1874 to 1998, issuing the Spanish peseta. Since 2014, it has also been Spain&#x27;s national competent authority within European Banking Supervision. It was originally established by Charles III in Madrid in 1782, as the Banco Nacional de San Carlos, and took its current name in 1856. Its activity is regulated by the Bank of Spain Autonomy Act. The bank doesn&#x27;t translate its name to English but uses its Spanish name in all English communications.

The Bank of Spain holds 9.1 million troy ounces of gold (around 283 tons) (2019), which are stored in its own vaults and in various institutions in London and New York. According to IMF data, Spain ranks 20th among the 40 largest gold reserves in the world (as of July 2015).

In January 2021, the snowstorm &quot;Filomena&quot; caused the clock at the Bank of Spain to freeze for the first time in 130 years. This occurred at 11:35 a.m. on Saturday, 9 January.

==History==
Originally named the &quot;Banco Nacional de San Carlos&quot;, it was founded in 1782 by Charles III in Madrid, to stabilize government finances through its state bonds (&quot;vales reales&quot;) following the American Revolutionary War in which Spain gave military and financial support to the Thirteen Colonies. Although it aided the state, the bank was initially owned privately by stockholders. Its assets included those of &quot;Spanish capitalists, French rentiers, and several treasuries of Indian communities in New Spain&quot; (colonial Mexico). Its first director was the French banker François Cabarrus, known in Spain as Francisco Cabarrús.

Following the Napoleonic invasion of Spain during the Peninsular War between 1808 and 1813, the bank was owed more than 300 million reales by the state, placing it in financial difficulty. Treasury Minister Luis López Ballesteros created a fund of 40 million reales in 1829 against which the bank could issue its own notes at Madrid. It did so after renaming itself (the name of the king of Spain was Fernando VII).

In 1844 the competing Banco de Isabel II and were established, followed in 1846 by the . In 1847, after overexposure in the failing property market of Madrid, the Banco de Isabel II merged with Banco de San Fernando and retained the latter name.

Under the guidance of Ramón Santillán in the 1850s, the bank extended its operations to the cities of Alicante and Valencia and took the name, . Requiring financial support from the bank to back its civil and colonial wars, the government of Spain granted the Banco de España a monopoly on the issuance of Spanish bank notes in 1874. Construction of the bank&#x27;s headquarters building began in 1884 at the crossing of the Calle de Alcalá and the Paseo del Prado in Madrid.

In 1936, 510 tonnes of gold reserves were transferred to the Soviet Union (in an event known as Moscow gold) corresponding to 72.6% of the total gold reserves of the Bank of Spain. That gold remained there during the Spanish Civil War.

In 1946, the government of General Franco placed the bank under tight control. It was formally nationalised in 1962. After the restoration of democracy in the late 1970s, the bank began a series of transformations and modernisations which continue to today.

On Spain&#x27;s entry into the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union in 1994, the Banco de España became a member of the European System of Central Banks. The Bank of Spain holds 8.84% of the ECB&#x27;s capital.

The governing structures of the Bank is divided among four branches:
* The Governor.
* The Deputy Governor.
* The Governing Council.
* The Executive Commission.

The Governor of the Bank of Spain is formally appointed after the Prime Minister of Spain has designated him/her by the Spanish monarch. The Governor must be a Spanish citizen recognized for his or her competence in monetary or banking matters. When a new Governor is named, the Minister of Economy and Finance, in accord with procedure established by the Congress of Deputies, informs the competent parliamentary commission. The current Governor is José Luis Escrivá.

The tasks of the Governor include:
* Direct the Bank and preside over the Governing Council and Executive Commission;
* Take primary responsibility for the Bank&#x27;s lawfully fulfilling its responsibilities. The Governor has ultimate responsibility authorizing bank contracts and other legal documents and for representing the Bank at justice tribunals;
* Represent the Bank in international institutional dealings;
* Function as a member of the Governing Council of the Bank and as a member of the General Council of the European System of Central Banks.

The Deputy Governor, designated by the national Government on the recommendation of the Governor of the Bank, should meet all of the official qualifications for the governorship. The current Deputy Governor of the Bank of Spain is Margarita Delgado. The Deputy Governor substitutes for the Governor in cases of vacancy, absence or illness, both as director of the Bank and as its representative. Further responsibilities of this office are a matter internal to the Bank, and are delegated by the Governor.

Six Bank Counsellors are named by the national Government, on the proposal of the Minister of Economy and Finance, with the involvement of the Governor of the Bank. They must be Spanish citizens recognized for their competence in economics or law.

The Deputy Governor is in charge of seven directorates:

* General Banking Supervision
* General Cash and Branches
* General Economics, Statistics and Research
* General Financial Stability, Regulation and Resolution
* General Operations, Markets and Payments Systems
* General Service
* General Secretariat

The Executive Commission consists of:

* The Governor, who presides;
* The Deputy Governor;
* Two Counsellors.

The directors general of the Bank attend the meetings of the Executive Commission, with voice but without vote. The Secretary of the Bank functions as secretary of the Executive Commission, but without voice or vote.

The two Counsellors who serve as members of the Executive Commission are designated by the Governing Council, after nomination by the Governor, from among their own members (other than &quot;ex officio&quot; members). The Governing Council consists of: 
* The Governor;
* The Deputy Governor;
* Six Counsellors;
* The director general of the treasury and of financial policy;
* The vice president of the &quot;Comisión Nacional Nacional del Mercado de Valores&quot; (&quot;Stock Market National Commission&quot;).

Council meetings are also attended by the directors general of the Bank and by a representative of bank personnel (elected by a means determined by the Bank&#x27;s internal rules), both with voice, but without vote.

The Minister of Economy and Finance or the &quot;Secretario de Estado de Economía&quot; (&quot;Secretary of State for the Economy&quot; [?]) may also attend (with voice, but without vote) those meetings of the Governing Council which will deal with matters relevant to their portfolios. They may also submit a motion for consideration by the council.

&quot;The Secretary of the Bank functions as secretary of the Executive Commission, with voice, but without vote.&quot;

==Functions==
Banco de España&#x27;s functions are:
* Defining and implementing the Eurosystem&#x27;s monetary policy, with the principal aim of maintaining price stability across the euro area&#x27;
* Conducting currency exchange operations consistent with the provisions of Article 109 of the Treaty on European Union, and holding and managing the State&#x27;s official currency reserves;
* Promoting the sound working of payment systems in the euro area;
* Issuing legal tender banknotes;
* The holding and management of currency and precious metal reserves not transferred to the European Central Bank;
* The promotion of the sound working and stability of the financial system and, without prejudice to the functions of the ECB, of national payment systems;
* The supervision of the solvency and compliance with specific rules of credit institutions, other entities and financial markets, for which it has been assigned supervisory responsibility, in accordance with current provisions;
* Circulating coins and performing on the State&#x27;s behalf all functions entrusted to it in this connection;
* Preparing and publishing data relating to its functions, and assisting the ECB in compiling statistical information;
* Providing treasury services and acting as financial agent for government debt;
* Advising the government, preparing appropriate reports and studies as required.

==Building==

The building houses 280 tonnes of the Spanish gold reserve. This gold reserve is protected by a complex mechanism and is placed 37 meters underground. The security system includes three armored doors, a trench with a one-person wide bridge, and a water-flooding system that uses the water from two adjacent rivers that go below the Cibeles fountain, located next to the bank&#x27;s building.

The building was to be used as a film location for the third season of the Spanish series Money Heist, but due to this security system, it was decided to be filmed in the Spanish Ministry of Development.

<text>Structured systems analysis and design method (SSADM) is a systems approach to the analysis and design of information systems. SSADM was produced for the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency, a UK government office concerned with the use of technology in government, from 1980 onwards.

== Overview ==
SSADM is a waterfall method for the analysis and design of information systems. SSADM can be thought to represent a pinnacle of the rigorous document-led approach to system design, and contrasts with more contemporary agile methods such as DSDM or Scrum.

SSADM is one particular implementation and builds on the work of different schools of structured analysis and development methods, such as Peter Checkland&#x27;s soft systems methodology, Larry Constantine&#x27;s structured design, Edward Yourdon&#x27;s Yourdon Structured Method, Michael A. Jackson&#x27;s Jackson Structured Programming, and Tom DeMarco&#x27;s structured analysis. 

The names &quot;Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method&quot; and &quot;SSADM&quot; are registered trademarks of the Office of Government Commerce (OGC), which is an office of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Treasury.

== History ==
The principal stages of the development of Structured System Analysing And Design Method were:
* 1980: Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) evaluate analysis and design methods.
* 1981: Consultants working for Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems, led by John Hall, chosen to develop SSADM v1.
* 1982: John Hall and Keith Robinson left to found Model Systems Ltd, LBMS later developed LSDM, their proprietary version.
* 1983: SSADM made mandatory for all new information system developments
* 1984: Version 2 of SSADM released
* 1986: Version 3 of SSADM released, adopted by NCC
* 1988: SSADM Certificate of Proficiency launched, SSADM promoted as &#x27;open&#x27; standard
* 1989: Moves towards Euromethod, launch of CASE products certification scheme
* 1990: Version 4 launched
* 1993: SSADM V4 Standard and Tools Conformance Scheme 
* 1995: SSADM V4+ announced, V4.2 launched
* 2000: CCTA renamed SSADM as &quot;Business System Development&quot;. The method was repackaged into 15 modules and another 6 modules were added.

== SSADM techniques ==
The three most important techniques that are used in SSADM are as follows:
; Logical Data Modelling
: The process of identifying, modelling and documenting the data requirements of the system being designed. The result is a data model containing entities (things about which a business needs to record information), attributes (facts about the entities) and relationships (associations between the entities).
; Data Flow Modelling
: The process of identifying, modelling and documenting how data moves around an information system. Data Flow Modeling examines processes (activities that transform data from one form to another), data stores (the holding areas for data), external entities (what sends data into a system or receives data from a system), and data flows (routes by which data can flow).
; Entity Event Modelling
: A two-stranded process: Entity Behavior Modelling, identifying, modelling and documenting the events that affect each entity and the sequence (or life history) in which these events occur, and Event Modelling, designing for each event the process to coordinate entity life histories.

== Stages ==
The SSADM method involves the application of a sequence of analysis, documentation and design tasks concerned with the following.

=== Stage 0 – Feasibility study ===

In order to determine whether or not a given project is feasible, there must be some form of investigation into the goals and implications of the project. For very small scale projects this may not be necessary at all as the scope of the project is easily understood. In larger projects, the feasibility may be done but in an informal sense, either because there is no time for a formal study or because the project is a &quot;must-have&quot; and will have to be done one way or the other. A data flow Diagram is used to describe how the current system works and to visualize the known problems. 

When a feasibility study is carried out, there are four main areas of consideration:

Technical – is the project technically possible?
Financial – can the business afford to carry out the project?
Organizational – will the new system be compatible with existing practices?
Ethical – is the impact of the new system socially acceptable?

To answer these questions, the feasibility study is effectively a condensed version of a comprehensive systems analysis and design. The requirements and usages are analyzed to some extent, some business options are drawn up and even some details of the technical implementation.
The product of this stage is a formal feasibility study document. SSADM specifies the sections that the study should contain including any preliminary models that have been constructed and also details of rejected options and the reasons for their rejection.

=== Stage 1 – Investigation of the current environment ===

The developers of SSADM understood that in almost all cases there is some form of current system even if it is entirely composed of people and paper. Through a combination of interviewing employees, circulating questionnaires, observations and existing documentation, the analyst comes to full understanding of the system as it is at the start of the project. This serves many purposes (Like examples?).

=== Stage 2 – Business system options ===

Having investigated the current system, the analyst must decide on the overall design of the new system. To do this, he or she, using the outputs of the previous stage, develops a set of business system options. These are different ways in which the new system could be produced varying from doing nothing to throwing out the old system entirely and building an entirely new one. The analyst may hold a brainstorming session so that as many and various ideas as possible are generated. 

The ideas are then collected to options which are presented to the user. The options consider the following: 

*the degree of automation
*the boundary between the system and the users
*the distribution of the system, for example, is it centralized to one office or spread out across several?
*cost/benefit
*impact of the new system

Where necessary, the option will be documented with a logical data structure and a level 1 data-flow diagram. 

The users and analyst together choose a single business option. This may be one of the ones already defined or may be a synthesis of different aspects of the existing options. The output of this stage is the single selected business option together with all the outputs of the feasibility stage.

=== Stage 3 – Requirements specification ===

This is probably the most complex stage in SSADM. Using the requirements developed in stage 1 and working within the framework of the selected business option, the analyst must develop a full logical specification of what the new system must do. The specification must be free from error, ambiguity and inconsistency. By logical, we mean that the specification does not say how the system will be implemented but rather describes what the system will do. 

To produce the logical specification, the analyst builds the required logical models for both the data-flow diagrams (DFDs) and the Logical Data Model (LDM), consisting of the Logical Data Structure (referred to in other methods as entity relationship diagrams) and full descriptions of the data and its relationships. These are used to produce function definitions of every function which the users will require of the system, Entity Life-Histories (ELHs) which describe all events through the life of an entity, and Effect Correspondence Diagrams (ECDs) which describe how each event interacts with all relevant entities. These are continually matched against the requirements and where necessary, the requirements are added to and completed.

The product of this stage is a complete requirements specification document which is made up of: 

*the updated data catalogue
*the updated requirements catalogue
*the processing specification which in turn is made up of
:*user role/function matrix
:*function definitions
:*required logical data model
:*entity life-histories
:*effect correspondence diagrams

=== Stage 4 – Technical system options ===

This stage is the first towards a physical implementation of the new system application. Like the Business System Options, in this stage a large number of options for the implementation of the new system are generated. This is narrowed down to two or three to present to the user from which the final option is chosen or synthesized. 

However, the considerations are quite different being: 

*the hardware architectures
*the software to use
*the cost of the implementation
*the staffing required
*the physical limitations such as a space occupied by the system
*the distribution including any networks which that may require
*the overall format of the human computer interface

All of these aspects must also conform to any constraints imposed by the business such as available money and standardization of hardware and software. 

The output of this stage is a chosen technical system option.

=== Stage 5 – Logical design ===

Though the previous level specifies details of the implementation, the outputs of this stage are implementation-independent and concentrate on the requirements for the human computer interface. The logical design specifies the main methods of interaction in terms of menu structures and command structures. 

One area of activity is the definition of the user dialogues. These are the main interfaces with which the users will interact with the system. Other activities are concerned with analyzing both the effects of events in updating the system and the need to make inquiries about the data on the system. Both of these use the events, function descriptions and effect correspondence diagrams produced in stage 3 to determine precisely how to update and read data in a consistent and secure way. 

The product of this stage is the logical design which is made up of: 

*Data catalogue
*Required logical data structure
*Logical process model – includes dialogues and model for the update and inquiry processes
*Stress &amp; Bending moment.

=== Stage 6 – Physical design===

This is the final stage where all the logical specifications of the system are converted to descriptions of the system in terms of real hardware and software. This is a very technical stage and a simple &quot;overview&quot; is presented here. 

The logical data structure is converted into a physical architecture in terms of database structures. The exact structure of the functions and how they are implemented is specified. The physical data structure is optimized where necessary to meet size and performance requirements. 

The product is a complete Physical Design which could tell software engineers how to build the system in specific details of hardware and software and to the appropriate standards.

<text>The Great Fire of Toronto of 1904 destroyed a large section of Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada on April 19, 1904. It was the second such fire for the city in its history.

==Incident==

The fire was first spotted at 8:04 p.m., on April 19, 1904, by a Toronto Police constable on his regular street patrol. The flames were rising from the elevator shaft of the E &amp; S Currie Limited&#x27;s neck wear factory at 58 Wellington Street West, just west of Bay Street (now TD Bank Tower). The factory was situated in the centre of a large industrial and commercial area. The exact cause of the fire was never determined, but a faulty heating stove or an electrical problem is suspected.

With 17 fire halls alerted, two engine companies and one hose company, the fire took nine hours to get under control. The glow of the fire could be seen for miles in all directions. Firefighters from cities as far away as Buffalo, New York, came to Toronto&#x27;s aid at the request of the then mayor Thomas Urquhart. The temperature that night was approximately with winds at and snow flurries.

Over 100 buildings would be destroyed in the fire; one estimate reported exactly 114 buildings. Damage on Wellington Street West and Yonge Street was limited because one of the buildings, the Kilgour Brothers factory, had a sprinkler system fed by water tanks on the roof, preventing the fire from spreading in that direction.

The fire claimed one victim, John Croft, who was an explosive expert clearing the ruins from the fire. It caused ($ in dollars) in damage and put five thousand people out of work; at the time the city had 200,000 inhabitants. As a result of the fire, more stringent safety laws were introduced and an expansion of the city&#x27;s fire department was undertaken.

A few buildings nearby survived including the Bank of Montreal building at Yonge and Front Streets, Customs House and their warehouse (demolished in 1919), Toronto Evening Telegram Building. Although the fire was officially under control by 4:30 a.m. the following morning, small fires sporadically broke out for the next few days and the remains from the fire smouldered for 2 weeks. 

==Legacy==

The fire remains the largest fire ever to have occurred in Toronto. A previous great fire on April 7, 1849, in the St. Lawrence Market area, consumed several city blocks when the city was much smaller and many more structures were wooden.

Call Box 12, which was used to sound the alarm, is the name for the volunteer canteen truck supporting Toronto Fire Services today.

Toronto Fire Services Public Education Centre and Museum at Station 233 has a model displaying the area of the fire.

A 1904 film, &quot;The Great Fire of Toronto&quot;, created by George Scott &amp; Co. about the event, was the first to be shot in Toronto.

A fictionalized account of the Fire was central to the &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; episode, &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;.

Part of the area cleared by the fire became the site of Union Station, built during the following decade.

<text>In British archaeology a watching brief is a method of preserving archaeological remains by record in the face of development threat. An archaeologist is employed by the developer to monitor the excavation of foundation and service trenches, landscaping and any other intrusive work the developer undertakes to give the archaeologist sufficient time to identify and record any archaeological finds and features; however, the arrangement is rarely satisfactory for either party.

It is both intellectually and physically difficult to identify archaeological features in narrow foundation trenches and the potential delay to a project can also be difficult for a developer to incorporate into a development programme. Prior evaluation through trial trenching can overcome these problems by having the archaeology examined and removed or preserved before groundworks commence.

Defined by the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists (CIfA) as: “…a formal programme of observation and investigation conducted during any operation carried out for non-archaeological reasons. This will be within a specified area or site on land, inter-tidal zone or underwater, where there is a possibility that archaeological deposits may be disturbed or destroyed. The programme will result in the preparation of a report and ordered archive.” (IFA rev.1999)
The purpose of an Archaeological Watching Brief is similarly defined by the CIfA and is: “to allow, within the resources available, the preservation by record of archaeological deposits, their presence and nature of which could not be established (or established with sufficient accuracy) in advance of development or other potentially disruptive works.”

<doc id="604673" wikidata="Q877510" url="?curid=604673" title="The Phenomenology of Spirit">
<text>The Phenomenology of Spirit () is the most widely discussed philosophical work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel; its German title can be translated as either &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; or &quot;The Phenomenology of Mind&quot;. Hegel described the work, published in 1807, as an &quot;exposition of the coming to be of knowledge&quot;. This is explicated through a necessary self-origination and dissolution of &quot;the various shapes of spirit as stations on the way through which spirit becomes pure knowledge&quot;.

The book marked a significant development in German idealism after Immanuel Kant. Focusing on topics in metaphysics, epistemology, ontology, ethics, history, religion, perception, consciousness, existence, logic and political philosophy, it is where Hegel develops his concepts of dialectic (including the lord-bondsman dialectic), absolute idealism, ethical life and &quot;Aufhebung&quot;. It had a profound effect in Western philosophy, and &quot;has been praised and blamed for the development of existentialism, communism, fascism, death of God theology and historicist nihilism&quot;.

==Historical context==

Hegel was putting the finishing touches to this book as Napoleon engaged Prussian troops on October 14, 1806, in the Battle of Jena on a plateau outside the city. On the day before the battle, Napoleon entered the city of Jena. Later that same day, Hegel wrote a letter to his friend, the theologian Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer:

I saw the Emperor – this world-soul – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it ... this extraordinary man, whom it is impossible not to admire.
In 2000, Terry Pinkard notes that Hegel&#x27;s comment to Niethammer &quot;is all the more striking since at that point he had already composed the crucial section of the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; in which he remarked that the Revolution had now officially passed to another land (Germany) that would complete &#x27;in thought&#x27; what the Revolution had only partially accomplished in practice.&quot;

==Publication history==
&quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; was published with the title “System of Science: First Part: The Phenomenology of Spirit”. Some copies contained either &quot;Science of the Experience of Consciousness&quot;, or &quot;Science of the Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; as a subtitle between the &quot;Preface&quot; and the &quot;Introduction&quot;. On its initial publication, the work was identified as Part One of a projected &quot;System of Science&quot;, which would have contained the &quot;Science of Logic&quot; &quot;and both the two real sciences of philosophy, the Philosophy of Nature and the Philosophy of Spirit” as its second part. The &quot;Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences&quot;, in its third section (&quot;Philosophy of Spirit&quot;), contains a second subsection (The Encyclopedia Phenomenology) that recounts in briefer and somewhat altered form the major themes of the original &quot;Phenomenology&quot;.

==Structure==

The book consists of a Preface (written after the rest was completed), an Introduction, and six major divisions (of greatly varying size). 
* (A) &quot;Consciousness&quot; is divided into three chapters: 
** (I) &quot;Sensuous-Certainty&quot;, 
** (II) &quot;Perceiving&quot;, and 
** (III) &quot;Force and the Understanding&quot;.
* (B) &quot;Self-Consciousness&quot; contains one chapter:
** (IV) &quot;The Truth of Self-Certainty&quot; which contains a preliminary discussion of Life and Desire, followed by two subsections: (A) &quot;Self-Sufficiency and Non-Self-Sufficiency of Self-Consciousness; Mastery and Servitude&quot; and (B) &quot;Freedom of Self-Consciousness: Stoicism, Skepticism, and the Unhappy Consciousness&quot;. This section contains Hegel&#x27;s famous discussion of lordship and bondage, which has been essential to the work of philosophers such as Frantz Fanon and Alexandre Kojève, among others.
* (C), (AA) &quot;Reason&quot; contains one chapter:
** (V) &quot;The Certainty and Truth of Reason&quot; which is divided into three chapters: (A) &quot;Observing Reason&quot;, (B) &quot;The Actualization of Rational Self-Consciousness Through Itself&quot;, and (C) &quot;Individuality, Which, to Itself, is Real in and for Itself&quot;.
* (BB) &quot;Spirit&quot; contains one chapter:
** (VI) &quot;Spirit&quot; or &quot;Geist&quot; which is again divided into three chapters: (A) &quot;True Spirit, Ethical Life&quot;, (B) &quot;Spirit Alienated from Itself: Cultural Formation&quot;, and (C) &quot;Spirit Certain of Itself: Morality&quot;.
* (CC) &quot;Religion&quot; contains one chapter:
** (VII) &quot;Religion&quot;, which is divided into three chapters: (A) &quot;Natural Religion&quot;, (B) &quot;The Art-Religion&quot;, and (C) &quot;Revealed Religion&quot;.
* (DD) &quot;Absolute Knowing&quot; contains one chapter:
** (VIII) &quot;Absolute Knowing&quot;.

Due to its obscure nature and the many works by Hegel that followed its publication, even the structure or core theme of the book itself remains contested. First, Hegel wrote the book under close time constraints with little chance for revision (individual chapters were sent to the publisher before others were written). Furthermore, according to some readers, Hegel may have changed his conception of the project over the course of the writing. Secondly, the book abounds with both highly technical argument in philosophical language, and concrete examples, either imaginary or historical, of developments by people through different states of consciousness. The relationship between these is disputed: whether Hegel meant to prove claims about the development of world history, or simply used it for illustration; whether or not the more conventionally philosophical passages are meant to address specific historical and philosophical positions; and so forth.

Jean Hyppolite famously interpreted the work as a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; that follows the progression of its protagonist, Spirit, through the history of consciousness, a characterization that remains prevalent among literary theorists. However, others contest this literary interpretation and instead read the work as a &quot;self-conscious reflective account&quot; that a society must give of itself in order to understand itself and therefore become reflective. Martin Heidegger saw it as the foundation of a larger &quot;System of Science&quot; that Hegel sought to develop, while Alexandre Kojève saw it as akin to a &quot;Platonic Dialogue ... between the great Systems of history.&quot; It has also been called &quot;a philosophical roller coaster ... with no more rhyme or reason for any particular transition than that it struck Hegel that such a transition might be fun or illuminating.&quot;

===Preface===
The Preface to the text is a preamble to the scientific system and cognition in general. Paraphrased “on scientific cognition&quot; in the table of contents, its intent is to offer a rough idea on scientific cognition, while at the same time aiming &quot;to rid ourselves of a few forms which are only impediments to philosophical cognition&quot;. As Hegel’s own announcement noted, it was to explain &quot;what seems to him the need of philosophy in its present state; also about the presumption and mischief of the philosophical formulas that are currently degrading philosophy, and about what is altogether crucial in it and its study&quot;. It can thus be seen as a heuristic attempt at creating the need of philosophy (in the present state) and of what philosophy itself in its present state needs. This involves an exposition on the content and standpoint of philosophy, i.e, the true shape of truth and the element of its existence, that is interspersed with polemics aimed at the presumption and mischief of philosophical formulas and what distinguishes it from that of any previous philosophy, especially that of his German Idealist predecessors (Kant, Fichte, and Schelling).

The Hegelian method consists of actually examining consciousness&#x27; experience of both itself and of its objects and eliciting the contradictions and dynamic movement that come to light in looking at this experience. Hegel uses the phrase &quot;pure looking at&quot; (&quot;reines Zusehen&quot;) to describe this method. If consciousness just pays attention to what is actually present in itself and its relation to its objects, it will see that what looks like stable and fixed forms dissolve into a dialectical movement. Thus, philosophy, according to Hegel, cannot just set out arguments based on a flow of deductive reasoning. Rather, it must look at actual consciousness, as it really exists.

Hegel also argues strongly against the epistemological emphasis of modern philosophy from Descartes through Kant, which he describes as having to first establish the nature and criteria of knowledge prior to actually knowing anything, because this would imply an infinite regress, a foundationalism that Hegel maintains is self-contradictory and impossible. Rather, he maintains, one must examine actual knowing as it occurs in real knowledge processes. This is why Hegel uses the term &quot;phenomenology&quot;. &quot;Phenomenology&quot; comes from the Greek word for &quot;to appear&quot;, and the phenomenology of mind is thus the study of how consciousness or mind appears to itself. In Hegel&#x27;s dynamic system, it is the study of the successive appearances of the mind to itself, because on examination each one dissolves into a later, more comprehensive and integrated form or structure of mind.

===Introduction===
Whereas the Preface was written after Hegel completed the &quot;Phenomenology&quot;, the Introduction was written beforehand.

In the Introduction, Hegel addresses the seeming paradox that people cannot evaluate their faculty of knowledge in terms of its ability to know the Absolute without first having a criterion for what the Absolute is, one that is superior to people&#x27;s knowledge of the Absolute. Yet, people could only have such a criterion if they already had the improved knowledge that they seek.

To resolve this paradox, Hegel adopts a method whereby the knowing that is characteristic of a particular stage of consciousness is evaluated using the criterion presupposed by consciousness itself. At each stage, consciousness knows something, and at the same time distinguishes the object of that knowledge as different from what it knows. Hegel and his readers will simply &quot;look on&quot; while consciousness compares its actual knowledge of the object—what the object is &quot;for consciousness&quot;—with its criterion for what the object must be &quot;in itself&quot;. One would expect that, when consciousness finds that its knowledge does not agree with its object, consciousness would adjust its knowledge to conform to its object. However, in a characteristic reversal, Hegel explains that under his method, the opposite occurs.

As just noted, consciousness&#x27; criterion for what the object should be is not supplied externally but rather by consciousness itself. Therefore, like its knowledge, the &quot;object&quot; that consciousness distinguishes from its knowledge is really just the object &quot;for consciousness&quot;—it is the object as envisioned by that stage of consciousness. Thus, in attempting to resolve the discord between knowledge and object, consciousness inevitably alters the object as well. In fact, the new &quot;object&quot; for consciousness is developed from consciousness&#x27; inadequate knowledge of the previous &quot;object&quot;. Thus, what consciousness really does is to modify its &quot;object&quot; to conform to its knowledge. Then the cycle begins anew as consciousness attempts to examine what it knows about this new &quot;object&quot;.

The reason for this reversal is that, for Hegel, the separation between consciousness and its object is no more real than consciousness&#x27; inadequate knowledge of that object. The knowledge is inadequate only because of that separation. At the end of the process, when the object has been fully &quot;spiritualized&quot; by successive cycles of consciousness&#x27; experience, consciousness will fully know the object and at the same time fully recognize that the object is none other than itself.

At each stage of development, Hegel, adds, &quot;we&quot; (Hegel and his readers) see this development of the new object out of the knowledge of the previous one, but the consciousness that they are observing does not. As far as it is concerned, it experiences the dissolution of its knowledge in a mass of contradictions, and the emergence of a new object for knowledge, without understanding how that new object has been born.

==Important concepts==
===Hegelian dialectic===
The famous dialectical process of thesis–antithesis–synthesis has been controversially attributed to Hegel. 
Regardless of (ongoing) academic controversy regarding the significance of a unique dialectical method in Hegel&#x27;s writings, it is true, as Professor Howard Kainz (1996) affirms, that there are &quot;thousands of triads&quot; in Hegel&#x27;s writings. Importantly, instead of using the famous terminology that originated with Kant and was elaborated by J. G. Fichte, Hegel used an entirely different and more accurate terminology for dialectical (or as Hegel called them, &quot;speculative&quot;) triads.

Hegel used two different sets of terms for his triads, namely, &quot;abstract–negative–concrete&quot; (especially in his &quot;Phenomenology&quot; of 1807), as well as &quot;immediate–mediate–concrete&quot; (especially in his &quot;Science of Logic&quot; of 1812), depending on the scope of his argumentation.

When one looks for these terms in his writings, one finds so many occurrences that it may become clear that Hegel employed the Kantian using a different terminology.

Hegel explained his change of terminology. The triad terms &quot;abstract–negative–concrete&quot; contain an implicit explanation for the flaws in Kant&#x27;s terms. The first term, &quot;thesis&quot;, deserves its anti-thesis simply because it is too abstract. The third term, &quot;synthesis&quot;, has completed the triad, making it concrete and no longer abstract by absorbing the negative.

Sometimes Hegel used the terms &quot;immediate–mediate–concrete&quot; to describe his triads. The most abstract concepts are those that immediately present themselves to human consciousness. For example, the notion of Pure Being for Hegel was the most abstract concept of all. The negative of this infinite abstraction would require an entire Encyclopedia, building category by category, dialectically, until it culminated in the category of Absolute Mind or Spirit (since the German word &quot;Geist&quot; can mean either &#x27;mind&#x27; or &#x27;spirit&#x27;).

===Unfolding of species===

Hegel describes a sequential progression from inanimate objects to animate creatures to human beings. This is frequently compared to Charles Darwin&#x27;s evolutionary theory. However, unlike Darwin, Hegel thought that organisms had agency in choosing to develop along this progression by collaborating with other organisms. Hegel understood this to be a linear process of natural development with a predetermined end. He viewed this end teleologically as its ultimate purpose and destiny.

==Criticism==

Walter Kaufmann, on the question of organisation, argued that Hegel&#x27;s arrangement, &quot;over half a century before Darwin published his &quot;Origin of Species&quot; and impressed the idea of evolution on almost everybody&#x27;s mind, was developmental.&quot; The idea is supremely suggestive but, in the end, untenable according to Kaufmann: &quot;The idea of arranging &quot;all&quot; significant points of view in such a single sequence, on a ladder that reaches from the crudest to the most mature, is as dazzling to contemplate as it is mad to try seriously to implement it&quot;. While Kaufmann viewed Hegel as right in seeing that the way a view is reached is not necessarily external to the view itself, since, on the contrary, a knowledge of the development, including the prior positions through which a human being passed before adopting a position may make all the difference when it comes to comprehending his or her position, some aspects of the conception are still somewhat absurd and some of the details bizarre. Kaufmann also remarks that the very table of contents of the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; may be said to &quot;mirror confusion&quot; and that &quot;faults are so easy to find in it that it is not worth while to adduce heaps of them.&quot; However, he excuses Hegel since he understands that the author of the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; &quot;finished the book under an immense strain&quot;.

<doc id="604680" wikidata="Q129937" url="?curid=604680" title="Elephant Man (musician)">
<text>O&#x27;Neil Bryan (born 11 September 1975), better known by his stage name Elephant Man, is a Jamaican dancehall musician, having formerly been a member of the dancehall group Scare Dem Crew prior to his solo career.

==Family and relationships==
Elephant Man is a father to at least 38 children. His first biological child, was born when he was 17 years old. In a February 2012 interview with Winford Williams of OnStage, he claimed to have had 20 different baby mothers at the time. Other children such as Ashanti Bryan aka Jeniun (formerly Ele-Trunk), claims Elephant Man disowned him and others - which possibly put the number of children O&#x27;Neil Bryan has to over 40.

==Career==
He started out his musical career in 1995 as a member of the Scare Dem Crew, later continuing as a solo artist. He was later characterised for several trademarks, such as his dyed yellow-orange hair, his unique low-key voice, and his stage performance, which included jumping and running, or even climbing on stage props and monitors. His acoustic trademark is a low, raspy grumble singing voice and light lisp.

Bryan had his first international recognition when he and Puma settled a contract for using his single &quot;All Out&quot; for its Olympics commercial campaign in 2004.

His song &quot;Willie Bounce&quot; appeared on several mixtapes in early 2006. It used the first few bars from &quot;I Will Survive&quot; by Gloria Gaynor. &quot;Willie Bounce&quot; has been described as one of Elephant Man&#x27;s most recognisable songs, with the corresponding dance still enjoying popularity as of 2015.

Bryan signed with New York-based label Bad Boy Records and released &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Physical&quot; on 6 November 2007. The first single was called &quot;Five-O&quot; and featured Wyclef Jean. Another track on the album featured Diddy and Busta Rhymes, and it was produced by Cipha Sounds and Solitair.

Many of Elephant Man&#x27;s songs are found on various &quot;Riddim Driven&quot; albums by VP Records and Greensleeves Records&#x27;s Rhythm Album series. He performed on popular riddims such as &quot;Diwali&quot;, &quot;Coolie&quot;, &quot;Stepz&quot;, and &quot;Bubble Up&quot;.

The Gully Creeper dance, for which Bryan created a song, was danced by Usain Bolt at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing after winning the gold medal and breaking a world record in the 200 meter sprint.

In 2009, Elephant Man released a cover of the song &quot;We Are The World&quot; in tribute to Michael Jackson.

==Legal issues==
Bryan has been criticised for his lyrics calling for violence against gay people. In 2003, British LGBT group OutRage! called for the arrest and prosecution of several dancehall stars including Elephant Man, Bounty Killer and Beenie Man for violation of hate crimes statutes. In 2004, he was dropped from the MOBO Awards. Since then pressure from his record company and agreement with gay rights groups to avoid songs with lyrics deemed to incite homophobic violence have allowed him to perform in the UK. In 2009, his scheduled appearance at Toronto&#x27;s Caribana festival was cancelled for similar reasons. A concert in Munich was cancelled in February 2015 after LGBT rights groups had asked the police to make sure he would not perform songs which call upon people to murder gays.

In January 2012, Bryan was arrested and charged with the rape and grievous sexual assault of a 31-year-old woman who accused him of assaulting her in his home in St. Andrew. In February 2016, the case was dropped due to the death of the complainant.

In March 2020, Jamaican authorities charged Elephant Man after it was alleged that he intentionally failed to declare his travel to Germany in order to avoid being quarantined in efforts to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic from countries that were on a restricted travel list. Elephant Man later apologised for the incident.

<doc id="604685" wikidata="Q2442109" url="?curid=604685" title="Cutibacterium acnes">
<text>Cutibacterium acnes (Propionibacterium acnes) is the relatively slow-growing, typically aerotolerant anaerobic, gram-positive bacterium (rod) linked to the skin condition of acne; it can also cause chronic blepharitis and endophthalmitis, the latter particularly following intraocular surgery. Its genome has been sequenced and a study has shown several genes can generate enzymes for degrading skin and proteins that may be immunogenic (activating the immune system).

The species is largely commensal and part of the skin flora present on most healthy adult humans&#x27; skin. It is usually just barely detectable on the skin of healthy preadolescents. It lives, among other things, primarily on fatty acids in sebum secreted by sebaceous glands in the follicles. It may also be found throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

Originally identified as &quot;Bacillus acnes&quot;, it was later named &quot;Propionibacterium acnes&quot; for its ability to generate propionic acid. In 2016, &quot;P. acnes&quot; was taxonomically reclassified as a result of biochemical and genomic studies. In terms of both phylogenetic tree structure and DNA G + C content, the cutaneous species was distinguishable from other species that had been previously categorized as &quot;P. acnes&quot;. As part of restructuring, the novel genus &quot;Cutibacterium&quot; was created for the cutaneous species, including those formerly identified as &quot;Propionibacterium acnes&quot;, &quot;Propionibacterium avidum&quot;, and &quot;Propionibacterium granulosum&quot;. Characterization of phylotypes of &quot;C. acnes&quot; is an active field of research.

==Role in diseases==

=== Acne vulgaris ===
&quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; bacteria predominantly live deep within follicles and pores, although they are also found on the surface of healthy skin. In these follicles, &quot;C. acnes&quot; bacteria use sebum, cellular debris and metabolic byproducts from the surrounding skin tissue as their primary sources of energy and nutrients. Elevated production of sebum by hyperactive sebaceous glands (sebaceous hyperplasia) or blockage of the follicle can cause &quot;C. acnes&quot; bacteria to grow and multiply.

&quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; bacteria secrete many proteins, including several digestive enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the digestion of sebum and the acquisition of other nutrients. They can also destabilize the layers of cells that form the walls of the follicle. The cellular damage, metabolic byproducts and bacterial debris produced by the rapid growth of &quot;C. acnes&quot; in follicles can trigger inflammation. This inflammation can lead to the symptoms associated with some common skin disorders, such as folliculitis and acne vulgaris. Acne vulgaris is the disease most commonly associated with &quot;C. acnes&quot; infection. Cutibacterium acnes is one of the most common and universal skin diseases, affecting more than 45 million individuals in the United States. 20% of all dermatologist visits are related to treating acne-related issues. This issue often develops during hormonal periods; however, it is also apparent through early adulthood. There are no quantitative differences between C. acnes of the skin of patients with acne, but the C. acnes phylogenetic groups display distinct genetic and phenotypic characteristics. C. acnes biofilms are also found much more frequently in acne and can induce distinct immune responses to combat against acne. 
Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit, which includes the hair follicle, hair shaft, and sebaceous gland and about 650 million people are affected globally by this disease. &quot;C. acnes&quot; starts to colonize on the skin around 1 to 3 years prior to puberty and grows exponentially during this time. This is why so many teens and young adults struggle with acne. Prescriptions to treat acne are often antibiotics. However, with the rise of antibiotic resistance, antibiotics are now often combined with broad-spectrum antibacterial agents such as benzoyl peroxide, and other medications like isotretinoin (commonly known by the brand name Accutane) are being used on patients with severe or resistant acne.

=== &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; &quot;epidermidis&quot; ===
The damage caused by &quot;C. acnes&quot; and the associated inflammation make the affected tissue more susceptible to colonization by opportunistic bacteria, such as &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. Preliminary research shows healthy pores are only colonized by &quot;C. acnes&quot;, while unhealthy ones universally include the nonpore-resident &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;, amongst other bacterial contaminants. Whether this is a root causality, just opportunistic and a side effect, or a more complex pathological duality between &quot;C. acnes&quot; and this particular &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; species is not known. Current research has pointed to the idea that &quot;C. acnes&quot; and &quot;S. epidermidis&quot; have a symbiotic relationship. Both bacteria exist on the normal flora of the skin and a disrupt in balance of these bacteria on the skin can result in acne or other bacterial infection.

In addition to contributing to skin inflammation and acne lesions, an imbalance in these bacteria may also impair the skin&#x27;s ability to heal and regenerate, leading to prolonged and more severe acne outbreaks. This disruption can also affect the skin&#x27;s overall microbiome diversity, potentially increasing susceptibility to other skin conditions such as eczema or rosacea. Investigating the dynamics of this relationship may offer insights into novel therapeutic approaches for managing various skin disorders.

=== Ophthalmic complications ===
&quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; is a common cause of chronic endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. The pathogen may also cause corneal ulcers.

=== Disk herniation ===
&quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; has been found in herniated discs. The propionic acid which it secretes creates micro-fractures of the surrounding bone. These micro-fractures are sensitive and it has been found that antibiotics have been helpful in resolving this type of low back pain.

=== Sarcoidosis ===
&quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; can be found in bronchoalveolar lavage of approximately 70% of patients with sarcoidosis and is associated with disease activity, but it can also be found in 23% of controls. The subspecies of &quot;C. acnes&quot; that cause these infections of otherwise sterile tissues (prior to medical procedures), however, are the same subspecies found on the skin of individuals who do not have acne-prone skin, so are likely local contaminants. Moderate to severe acne vulgaris appears to be more often associated with virulent strains.

=== Opportunistic diseases ===
&quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; is often considered an opportunistic pathogen, causing a range of postoperative and device-related infections, notably e.g., surgical infections, post-neurosurgical infections, infected joint prostheses (especially shoulder), neurosurgical shunt infections and endocarditis in patients with prosthetic heart valves (predominantly men). &quot;C. acnes&quot; may play a role in other conditions, including SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis) syndrome, sarcoidosis and sciatica. It is also suspected a main bacterial source of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease brains. It is a common contaminant in blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures.

==Antimicrobial susceptibility==
&quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; bacteria are susceptible to a wide range of antimicrobial molecules, from both pharmaceutical and natural sources. The antibiotics most frequently used to treat acne vulgaris are erythromycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline. Several other families of antibiotics are also active against &quot;C. acnes&quot; bacteria, including quinolones, cephalosporins, pleuromutilins, penicillins, and sulfonamides.

=== Antibiotic-resistance ===
The emergence of antibiotic-resistant &quot;C. acnes&quot; bacteria represents a growing problem worldwide. The problem is especially pronounced in North America and Europe. The antibiotic families that &quot;C. acnes&quot; are most likely to acquire resistance to are the macrolides (e.g., erythromycin and azithromycin), lincosamides (e.g., clindamycin) and tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline and minocycline).

However, &quot;C. acnes&quot; bacteria are susceptible to many types of antimicrobial chemicals found in over-the-counter antibacterial products, including benzoyl peroxide, triclosan, chloroxylenol, and chlorhexidine gluconate.

C. acnes resistance to antibiotics has increased to 64% in 2000, up from 20% in 1979. Treatments such as oral macrolides are often avoided because the bacteria has become resistant in most cases. This creates a public health issue, forcing healthcare providers to seek out other forms of treatment.

==== Treatments ====
Several naturally occurring molecules and compounds are toxic to &quot;C. acnes&quot; bacteria. Some essential oils such as rosemary, tea tree oil, clove oil, and citrus oils contain antibacterial chemicals. Natural honey has also been shown to have some antibacterial properties that may be active against &quot;C. acnes&quot;.

The elements silver, sulfur, and copper have also been demonstrated to be toxic towards many bacteria, including &quot;C. acnes&quot;.

Salicylic acid is a naturally occurring substance derived from plants (white willow bark and wintergreen leaves) used to promote exfoliation of the skin in order to treat acne. Additionally, research investigates the by which salicylic acid (SA) treats acne vulgaris. A study finds that SA suppresses the AMPK/SREBP1 (AMP-activated protein kinase)(AMPK/SREBP1 pathway is a signaling pathway involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism in sebocytes, which are the cells responsible for producing sebum in the skin) pathway in sebocytes, leading to a decrease in lipid synthesis and sebum production. SA also reduces the inflammatory response of sebocytes and decreases the proliferation of &quot;C.&quot; &quot;acnes&quot;. These results suggest that SA has a multifaceted approach in treating acne vulgaris by targeting several key factors that contribute to its development. The minimum inhibitory concentration for SA is .

==Photosensitivity==
&quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; glows orange when exposed to blacklight, possibly due to the presence of endogenous porphyrins. It is also killed by ultraviolet light. &quot;C. acnes&quot; is especially sensitive to light in the 405–420 nanometer (near the ultraviolet) range due to an endogenic porphyrin–coporphyrin III. A total radiant exposure of 320 J/cm2 inactivates this species &quot;in vitro&quot;. Its photosensitivity can be enhanced by pretreatment with aminolevulinic acid, which boosts production of this chemical, although this causes significant side effects in humans, and in practice was not significantly better than the light treatment alone.

==Other habitats==
&quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; has been found to be an endophyte of plants. Notably, grapevine appears to host an endophytic population of &quot;C. acnes&quot; that is closely related to the human-associated strains. The two lines diverged roughly 7,000 years ago, at about the same time when grapevine agriculture may have been established. This &quot;C. acnes&quot; subtype was dubbed &quot;Zappae&quot; in honour of the eccentric composer Frank Zappa, to highlight its unexpected and unconventional habitat.

<text>The Lower Rio Grande Valley (), commonly known as the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas or locally as the Valley RGV, or the 956 is a region spanning the border of Texas and Mexico located in a floodplain of the Rio Grande near its mouth. The region includes the southernmost tip of South Texas and a portion of northern Tamaulipas, Mexico. It consists of the Brownsville, Harlingen, Weslaco, Donna, Pharr, McAllen, Edinburg, Mission, San Juan, and Rio Grande City metropolitan areas in the United States and the Matamoros, Río Bravo, and Reynosa metropolitan areas in Mexico. The area is generally bilingual in English and Spanish, with a fair amount of Spanglish due to the region&#x27;s diverse history and transborder agglomerations. It is home to some of the poorest cities in the nation, as well as many unincorporated, persistent poverty communities called &quot;colonias&quot;. A large seasonal influx occurs of &quot;winter Texans&quot; — people who come down from the north for the winter and then return north before summer arrives.

== History ==

=== Pre-Spanish colonization ===
Native peoples lived in small tribes in the area before the Spanish conquest. The native tribes in South Texas were known to be hunter-gatherer peoples. The area was known for its smaller nomadic tribes collectively called Coahuiltecan. Native archaeological excavations near Brownsville have shown evidence of prehistoric shell trading.

=== Spanish colonization ===
Initially, the Spanish had a hard time conquering the area due to the differences in native languages, so they mainly focused on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico also known as the Seno Mexicano. Also, a major conflict existed on who would conquer the region. Antonio Ladrón de Guevara wanted to colonize the region, but the Viceroy of New Spain José Tienda de Cuervo doubted Ladrón de Guevara&#x27;s character, eventually leading to a royal Spanish declaration preventing Ladrón de Guevara from participating in colonization efforts.

The first &quot;villas&quot; in the region were settled in Laredo and Reynosa in 1767. In 1805, the Spanish government solidified the autonomy of the region by defining the territory of Nuevo Santander as south of the colony of Tejas from the Nueces River south to Tampico, Charcas, and Valles. The local government of the region had a rough start with various indigenous wars up until 1812. In 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence, the state was renamed Tamaulipas.

=== Republic of Texas and annexation by the United States ===
The Texas Revolution of 1835-1836 put the majority of what is now called the Rio Grande Valley under contested Texan sovereignty. The area also became a thoroughfare for runaway slaves fleeing to Mexico.

In 1844, the United States under President James K. Polk annexed the Republic of Texas, against British and Mexican sentiments, contributing to the onset of the Mexican–American War. The area along the Rio Grande was the source of several major battles, including the Battle of Resaca de la Palma near Brownsville. The war ended in 1848 with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which defined the United States&#x27; southern border as the Rio Grande. The change in government led to a mass migration from Tamaulipas to the United States side of the river.

From the end of the Mexican-American War, the population of the Valley began to grow, and farmers began to raise cattle in the area. Despite the end of the formal war in 1848, interracial strife continued between native peoples and the white settlers over land through the 1920s.

=== Early 1900s and the Mexican Revolution ===
At the turn of the 20th century trade and immigration between Mexico and the United States was a normal part of society. The development of the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico Railway in 1903 and the irrigation of the Rio Grande allowed the Rio Grande Valley to develop into profitable farmland. Droughts in the 1890s and early 1900s caused smaller farmers and cattle ranchers to lose their lands. Rich white settlers brought by the railroad bought the land and displaced the Tejano ranchers.

Meanwhile, across the river, Mexico was dealing with the Mexican Revolution. The revolution spilled over the border through cross-border supply raids, and in response President Taft sent the United States Army into the region beginning in 1911 and continuing until 1916 when the majority of the United States armed forces were stationed in the region. Texas governor Oscar Colquitt also sent the Texas Rangers into the area to keep the peace between Mexicans and Americans.

The region played host to several well-known conflicts including the backlash from the Plan of San Diego, and the racially fueled violence of Texas Ranger Harry Ransom. In 1921 the United States Border Patrol came to the region with less than 10 officers. Initially the agency was focused on import and export business, especially alcohol during Prohibition in the United States, but later moved to detaining illegal aliens.

The region had a significant increase of Border Patrol agents during World War I in conjunction with the Zimmermann Telegram. The Texas Rangers also increased their presence as law enforcement in the region with a new class of Ranger that focused on determining Tejano loyalty. They were often violent, carrying out retaliatory murders. They were never held accountable to the law even though charges were brought in the Texas senate.

There were two major military training facilities in the Valley in Brownsville and Harlingen during World War II.

=== Post-World War II to present ===
The North American Free Trade Agreement, also known as NAFTA, was established in 1994 as a trade agreement between the three North American countries, The United States, Mexico, and Canada. NAFTA was supposed to increase trade with Mexico as they lowered or eliminated tariffs on Mexican goods. Exports and imports tripled in the region and accounted for a trade surplus of $75 billion. The Rio Grande Valley benefited from NAFTA in retail, manufacturing, and transportation. Due to the influx of jobs and exportation, many people migrated to the RGV, both documented and undocumented. According to Akinloye Akindayomi in &quot;Drug violence in Mexico and its impact on the fiscal realities of border cities in Texas: evidence from Rio Grande Valley counties&quot;, NAFTA also indirectly aids the rise in immigration and drug smuggling practices between cartels in the region, with cartels profiting with over $80 billion. The Trump Administration decided to make new accords with Mexico and Canada and replaced NAFTA with the new trade agreement, United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2018.

After the September 11 attacks, the Customs Border Security Act of 2001 established United States Border Patrol interior checkpoints with some situated at the north end of the Rio Grande Valley. This allows for a second line of defense in the ever increasing subtlety of smuggling.

More recently the organization We Build the Wall has begun construction on a section of the border wall in the Valley. Local residents have expressed concerns about the project including the site&#x27;s proximity to the National Butterfly Center and the Rio Grande with its potential for seasonal flooding. The U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission has ordered We Build the Wall to stop until they can review whether or not the construction violates a Treaty to resolve pending boundary differences and maintain the Rio Grande and Colorado River as the international boundary between the United States and Mexico signed in 1970.

==Geography==
The Rio Grande Valley is not a true valley, but a river delta. &quot;Valley&quot; is often used in the western United States to refer to a large expanse with rivers. Most such valleys, including the Rio Grande, have good agricultural production. Early 20th-century land developers, attempting to capitalize on unclaimed land, utilized the name &quot;Magic Valley&quot; to attract settlers and appeal to investors. The Rio Grande Valley is also called &quot;El Valle&quot;, the Spanish translation of &quot;the valley&quot;, by those who live there. The main region is within four Texan counties: Starr County, Hidalgo County, Willacy County, and Cameron County.

=== Major settlements ===
The largest city on the American side of the region is Brownsville (Cameron County), followed by McAllen (Hidalgo County). Other major cities include Harlingen, San Benito, Edinburg, Mission, Rio Grande City, Raymondville, Weslaco, Hidalgo and Pharr. On the Mexican side of the border Matamoros, Río Bravo, and Reynosa are major cities in this region.

==Demographics==
As of 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the population of the Rio Grande Valley at 1,368,723. Hidalgo County has the largest population with an estimate of 861,137. Cameron County has the second-highest population estimated at 422,135. Starr County has the third-largest population estimated at 64,032. Willacy County has the fourth-largest population estimated at 21,419.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2008, 86 percent of Cameron County, 90 percent of Hidalgo County, 97 percent of Starr County, and 86 percent of Willacy County are Hispanic.

=== Colonias ===
The major metropolitan areas in the Rio Grande Valley are surrounded by smaller rural communities called colonias. These communities are primarily poor and Hispanic. The areas often lack basic services like sanitation and sewage, and suffer from flooding. Many of these colonias are mixes of mobile homes and self-constructed houses owned by the residents. The Bracero program enacted in the 1940s allowed Mexicans to cross the border and work in the agricultural fields. Most worked in the Rio Grande Valley, and due to a shortage of affordable houses, developers started selling them land in unincorporated areas; these clusters of homes over time became what are now known as colonias. According to the Housing Assistance Council, a nonprofit organization that tracks rural housing, approximately 1.6 million people live in 1,500 recognized colonias alongside the Mexico–United States border.

=== Language use ===
The residents of the Lower Rio Grande Valley are generally bilingual in English and Spanish often mixing into Spanglish depending on demographics and context. Government statistics for the region are often underreported due to underlying immigration issues.

The Spanish language plays an important role in all aspects of life. In 1982 a statistically significant majority of people in the Rio Grande Valley spoke Spanish. People speak Spanish to communicate in all aspects of life including business, government, and at home.

People often prefer Spanish to English when interacting with government officials as seen in the response to the region&#x27;s 2018 flooding.

=== Religion ===
The Catholic Church has been present in the Rio Grande Valley since the Spanish colonization of the region. In San Juan, Texas the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of San Juan del Valle is a major Catholic shrine.

One of the offshoots of the Catholic Church, worship of Santa Muerte, has a small but significant following in the valley. There has been public outcry against followers erecting shrines at their homes and in public places. In 2015, a Santa Muerte statue was involved with a bomb scare in San Benito, Texas. This followed the desecration of a Santa Muerte statue in the San Benito Municipal Cemetery in January of the same year.

In addition to the Catholic Church, several other Christian denominations are present in the Rio Grande Valley, including several organized Protestant churches in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. There are also 26 congregations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with about 17,000 members.
Sikh, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist and Baháʼí Faith communities thrive in the Rio Grande Valley.

== Culture ==
The area is largely bilingual and bicultural, according to &quot;Texas Highways&quot;; in 2024 nearly 90% of the population identified as Hispanic. Mexican cuisine and Tejano cuisine are popular in the area. Green spaghetti or espagueti verde, a Mexican style of spaghetti with roasted poblano cream sauce, is a common celebration dish little known in the United States outside the Rio Grande Valley. The local style of barbecue is barbacoa. Brownsville&#x27;s Vera&#x27;s Backyard BBQ is a notable barbacoa restaurant.

== Climate ==
The Lower Rio Grande Valley experiences a warm and fair climate that brings visitors from many surrounding areas. Temperature extremes range from triple digits during the summer months to freezing during the winter. While the Valley has seen severe cold events before, such as the 2004 Christmas snow storm and 2021 cold snap, the region rarely experiences temperatures at or below freezing, especially by the coast, which transitions into a Tropical climate.

The region&#x27;s proximity to the Gulf of Mexico makes it a target for hurricanes. Though not impacted as frequently as other areas of the Gulf Coast of the United States, the Valley has experienced major hurricanes in the past. Hurricanes that have made landfall in or near the area include Hurricane Beulah (1967), Hurricane Allen (1980), Hurricane Gilbert, Hurricane Bret, Hurricane Dolly (2008), Hurricane Alex (2010), and Hurricane Hanna (2020). Having an especially flat terrain, the Valley usually experiences the catastrophic effects of tropical cyclones in the form of flooding.

==Tourism==
The Lower Rio Grande Valley encompasses landmarks that attract tourists. Popular destinations include Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge, Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge, Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park, South Padre Island, Brazos Island, and the Port Isabel Lighthouse.

The Valley is a popular waypoint for tourists visiting northeast Mexico. Popular destinations across the border and Rio Grande include: Matamoros, Nuevo Progreso, Río Bravo, and Reynosa, all located in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.

The region also attracts tourists from the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, Coahuila, and Mexico, D.F. (México City).

==The Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe of Texas==

The ancestral lands of the Rio Grande Valley have been home to historic Native groups, which today include the Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe of Texas. While not recognized by the government, this tribe and other communities have existed on the lands predating European settlement and the acquisition of Texas from Mexico. The tribe speaks of their existence as a way of life. Today, a working map of Native and Indigenous nations and tribes across Turtle Island and the Northern Americas has been communally constructed on the Native Land webpage. The Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe is recognized on the Native Land webpage, represented across South Texas. The visibility and recognition of Native communities like the Carrizo/Comecrudo are paramount and require a constant fight by many Indigenous tribes worldwide, especially when histories of vulnerable groups like Indigenous communities are essentially contested and being attacked legally by state governments.

As historian and scholar Ned Blackhawk outlines in &quot;The Centrality of Dispossession: Native American Genocide and Settler Colonialism,&quot; in &quot;World History of Genocide: Volume II&quot;, the &quot;mythologies of Indigenous ‘disappearance’ appear as ahistorical as they are problematic.&quot; Scholars like Blackhawk work to address the narrative of Native peoples as passively disappeared and of existing solely in the past by amplifying the intentional and strategic projects of dispossession and settler colonialism in their goals to erase, harm, and destabilize a group of people. Therefore, the Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe&#x27;s work to establish their presence and continually advocate for their way of living and place in the Rio Grande Valley is resilient and vital.

The Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe of Texas has long fought with SpaceX over the environmental protection of their lands. Elon Musk established Starbase, one of the engineering hubs, in Boca Chica Beach, a coastal beach of the Rio Grande Valley. Alongside the Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe of Texas, local RGV environmental organizations have opposed SpaceXs business and activities at Boca Chica, citing the tribe&#x27;s claims to land and destruction to the local terrain and natural life.

On August 5, 2024, a group of local organizations including the Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe wrote a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration raising concerns about SpaceX operations in Boca Chica Beach and requesting a meeting to discuss the FAA&#x27;s process of incorporating community voice into the conversation. The group includes a range of environmental organizations across the Rio Grande Valley, including the South Texas Environmental Justice Network, the South Texas Human Rights Center, TRUCHA, Voces Unidas, and Texas Rising RGV. The letter highlights the identities of Rio Grande Valley community members that are most often overlooked, including Indigenous voices. Now, there are large concerns regarding Elon Musk&#x27;s intentions to relocate the headquarters of SpaceX to the Starbase site in Boca Chica Beach.

==Economy==
The Valley is historically reliant on agribusiness and tourism. Cotton, grapefruit, sorghum, maize, and sugarcane are its leading crops, and the region is the center of citrus production and the most important area of vegetable production in the State of Texas. Over the last several decades, the emergence of maquiladoras (factories or fabrication plants) has caused a surge of industrial development along the border, while international bridges have allowed Mexican nationals to shop, sell, and do business in the border cities along the Rio Grande. The geographic inclusion of South Padre Island also drives tourism, particularly during the Spring Break season, as its subtropical climate keeps temperatures warm year-round. During the winter months, many retirees (commonly referred to as &quot;Winter Texans&quot;) arrive to enjoy the warm weather, access to pharmaceuticals and healthcare in Mexican border crossings such as Nuevo Progreso. There is a substantial health-care industry with major hospitals and many clinics and private practices in Brownsville, Harlingen, and McAllen.

Texas is the third largest producer of citrus fruit in the United States, the majority of which is grown in the Rio Grande Valley. Grapefruit make up over 70% of the Valley citrus crop, which also includes orange, tangerine, tangelo and Meyer lemon production each Winter.

One minor professional sports team plays in the Rio Grande Valley: The Rio Grande Valley Vipers (basketball). Defunct teams that previously played in the region include: the Edinburg Roadrunners (baseball), La Fiera FC (indoor soccer), Rio Grande Valley Ocelots FC (soccer), Rio Grande Valley WhiteWings (baseball), Rio Grande Valley Killer Bees (ice hockey), Rio Grande Valley Sol (indoor football) and the Rio Grande Valley FC Toros (soccer)

One of the Valley&#x27;s major tourist attractions is the semi-tropical wildlife. Birds and butterflies attract a large number of visitors every year all throughout the entire region. Ecotourism is a major economic force in the Rio Grande Valley.

==Transportation==
The Rio Grande Valley is served by three commercial airports: Brownsville South Padre Island International Airport in Brownsville, Texas, Valley International Airport in Harlingen, Texas, and McAllen Miller International Airport in McAllen, Texas. American Airlines and United Airlines provide service to all three airports, with Avelo Air also providing service to Brownsville South Padre Island International Airport, Allegiant Air also providing service to McAllen Miller International Airport, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines and Delta Air Lines also providing service to Valley International Airport.

There are several bus lines that run through the United States side of the Lower Rio Grande Valley including Metro Connect (McAllen), McAllen Paratransit, McAllen Metro Services, Brownsville Metro/ADA Paratransit Service Island Metro (South Padre Island), and Greyhound Lines. On the Mexican side of the border there are several bus companies that run including Greyhound, Tornado, Ave Senda Ejecutiva, Enlaces Terrestres Nacionales, Futua, Noreste, Omnibus de Oriente, Transpais, Transportes del Norte, Transportes Frontera, and Turistar Lujo.

The Interstate Highway System in the United States is well developed in the Lower Rio Grande Valley and connects Brownsville, Hidalgo, McAllen, Raymondville, Edinburg, Pharr, and Laredo. On the Mexican side, there are several major highways between Matamoros, Reynosa, and Nuevo Laredo. car travel on the Mexican side was considered dangerous and the Mexican Federal Police offered a police escort between Ciudad Victoria, Matamoros, and Reynosa.

Freight trains run between Harlingen, Mission, Edinburg, and Santa Rosa connecting to the Union Pacific Railroad. In Mexico, Kansas City Southern de México runs freight service and crosses from Matamoros into Brownsville over the Brownsville &amp; Matamoros International Bridge.

Sea trade runs through the deepwater seaport, the Port of Brownsville and the Foreign Trade Zone 62. , the Port also features an export terminal for liquid natural gas under construction, Rio Grande LNG, with a competing LNG export terminal, the Texas LNG project, planned to commence construction in the near future. 

SpaceX South Texas launch site is located near Brownsville.

==Politics==

The region is represented by Ted Cruz and John Cornyn in the United States Senate and by Monica De La Cruz, Vicente Gonzalez, and Henry Cuellar in the United States House of Representatives.

In the twenty-first century, the dominance of agribusiness has caused political issues, as jurisdictional disputes regarding water rights have caused tension between farmers on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Scholars, including Mexican political scientist Armand Peschard-Sverdrup, have argued that this tension has created the need for a re-developed strategic transnational water management. Some have declared the disputes tantamount to a &quot;war&quot; over diminishing natural resources. Climatologists believe water scarcity in the Valley will only increase as climate change alters the precipitation patterns of the region.

The Lower Rio Grande Valley has historically been one of the most strongly Democratic regions in the country, having only briefly voted Republican during the 1950&#x27;s Eisenhower years and the 1972 landslide election of Republican Richard Nixon. Continued Democratic dominance would depend on maintaining the loyalty of Latino voters, who make up 91.5% of the region. Recently, the GOP has made large inroads causing loyalties to shift. Latino men, particularly young men, rural Latinos, the growing number of Latino evangelical Protestants, devout Catholics, socially conservative, pro-life voters and working class-blue collar voters without a college degree have begun to join White voters in supporting the Republican party at majority levels.

Culturally, the state GOP successfully galvanized the majority Latino region against Democrats on several hot-button social issues, namely gender identity and transgender related concerns. The Lower Rio Grande Valley, like Texas itself, is socially conservative. Over 60% of voters outright reject a variety of transgender rights. GOP Spanish ads denigrating pronouns, denouncing gender-theory curriculum, opposing gender affirming care for minors and &quot;protecting girls sports and locker-rooms&quot; by banning transgender athletes in sports flooded the campaign trail. These sentiments are now influencing local races in the region and across Texas as well, signaling a new source of Republican strength.

Economically, the GOP emphasized strong support for the states oil and gas industry, which is 33% Latino. Other ideas communicated through the campaign trail were lowering taxes and supporting entrepreneurs and small business owners within the Latino community who signaled they trusted Trump to manage the economy over the Democrats. Pundits also noted the Trump campaign was able to build much needed trust in the Latino community for Trump immigration plans, often criticizing illegal immigration and asylum-seekers, which polls showed Latinos began to believe his rhetoric was about &quot;other people&quot; not &quot;me&quot;.

Initially in 2016, Donald Trump won only 29 percent of the region&#x27;s vote, an 80-year low for Republicans. However, shocking pundits in 2020, he significantly strengthened the Republican vote in the Rio Grande Valley, reducing Democrats winning margins from 38.6 in 2016 to 15.1 in 2020, and then outright winning the region in 2024 by 4.4 points, ultimately a 43 point shift from 8 years prior.

==Education==
Historically, education has posed significant challenges to schools in the region. Schools in the early 1920s through the 1940s were racially segregated in the Rio Grande Valley. In 1940 a study showed the need for improvement in cultural differentiation of instruction. The Texas Supreme Court in Del Rio ISD v. Salvatierra reinforced the racial segregation. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Bilingual Education Act, helping students whose second language was English. The Act gave financial assistance to local schools to create bilingual programs, enabling Mexican students to integrate white schools. The area, like many others, had a hard time integrating. Texas still has the bilingual program, while states like California, Arizona, and Massachusetts, have removed the bill and passed similar propositions stating that students would only be taught in English. The bilingual program in the Rio Grande Valley is still in effect, especially with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals students in the area.

<text>Didon was a 40-gun frigate of the French Navy. Captured by the British in 1805, she went on to serve briefly in the Royal Navy as the 38-gun fifth-rate HMS &quot;Didon&quot; until she was sold in 1810.

== French service ==
Laid down in 1796 as &quot;Fâcheuse&quot;, she was renamed to &quot;Didon&quot; in 1799, the year of her launch.

On 13 October 1803, she captured the British privateer brig .

&quot;Didon&quot; later took part in the Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1805.

===Capture===
While attempting to rejoin the French fleet of Allemand&#x27;s expedition of 1805, she encountered , Captain Thomas Baker, on 10 August 1805, off Cape Finisterre, and struck at .

Captain Milius, of &quot;Didon&quot;, maneuvered adroitly, and casualties on both sides were heavy. The 4-hour fight cost &quot;Didon&quot; 27 men killed and 44 wounded. &quot;Phoenix&quot; lost 12 men killed and 28 wounded. Lloyd&#x27;s Patriotic Fund awarded Baker a sword worth 100 guineas. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp, &quot;Phoenix 10 Augt. 1805&quot;.

Baker took &quot;Didon&quot; in tow and sailed towards Gibraltar. By good fortune and skillful sailing he avoided encountering the Franco-Spanish fleet that had just left Cádiz. Instead of continuing onward, Baker changed direction and sailed for England.

==British service and fate ==
&quot;Didon&quot; arrived at Plymouth on 4 September 1805. The Navy took her into British service as HMS &quot;Didon&quot;; she is the only ship of the Royal Navy to have borne this name. The Royal Navy commissioned &quot;Didon&quot; under the command of Captain Thomas Baker in November. She was paid off in 1807 and placed into Ordinary the same year. The Navy commenced major repairs on &quot;Didon&quot; in May, but then cancelled the work. &quot;Didon&quot; was broken up in August 1811.

<text>The hereditary peers form part of the peerage in the United Kingdom. As of November 2024, there are 801 hereditary peers: 30 dukes (including six royal dukes), 34 marquesses, 189 earls, 109 viscounts, and 439 barons (not counting subsidiary titles).

As a result of the Peerage Act 1963, all peers except those in the peerage of Ireland were entitled to sit in the House of Lords. Since the House of Lords Act 1999 came into force only 92 hereditary peers, elected from all hereditary peers, are permitted to do so, unless they are also life peers. Peers are called to the House of Lords with a writ of summons.

Not all hereditary titles are titles of the peerage. For instance, baronets and baronetesses may pass on their titles, but they are not peers. Conversely, the holder of a non-hereditary title may belong to the peerage, as with life peers. Peerages may be created by means of letters patent, but the granting of new hereditary peerages has largely dwindled; only seven hereditary peerages have been created since 1965, four of them for members of the British royal family. The most recent grant of a hereditary peerage was in 2019 for the youngest child of Elizabeth II, Prince Edward, who was created Earl of Forfar; the most recent grant of a hereditary peerage to a non-royal was in 1984 for former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, who was created Earl of Stockton with the subsidiary title of Viscount Macmillan.

== Origins ==
The hereditary peerage, as it now exists, combines several different English institutions with analogues from Scotland and Ireland.

English earls are an Anglo-Saxon institution. Around 1014, England was divided into shires or counties, largely to defend against the Danes; each shire was led by a local great man, called an earl; the same man could be earl of several shires. When the Normans invaded England, they continued to appoint earls, but not for all counties; the administrative head of the county became the sheriff. Earldoms began as offices, with a perquisite of a share of the legal fees in the county; they gradually became honours, with a stipend of £20 a year. Like most feudal offices, earldoms were inherited, but the kings frequently asked earls to resign or exchange earldoms. Usually there were few earls in England, and they were men of great wealth in the shire from which they held title, or an adjacent one, but it depended on circumstances: during the civil war between Stephen and the Empress Matilda, nine earls were created in three years.

William the Conqueror and his great-grandson Henry II did not make dukes; they were themselves only Dukes of Normandy or Aquitaine. But when Edward III of England declared himself King of France, he made his sons dukes, to distinguish them from other noblemen, much as royal dukes are now distinguished from other dukes. Later kings created marquesses and viscounts to make finer gradations of honour: a rank something more than an earl and something less than an earl, respectively.

When Henry III or Edward I wanted money or advice from his subjects, he would order great churchmen, earls, and other great men to come to his Great Council (some of these are now considered the first parliaments); he would generally order lesser men from towns and counties to gather and pick some men to represent them. The English Order of Barons evolved from those men who were individually ordered to attend Parliament, but held no other title; the chosen representatives, on the other hand, became the House of Commons. This order, called a writ, was not originally hereditary, or even a privilege; the recipient had to come to the Great Council at his own expense, vote on taxes on himself and his neighbours, acknowledge that he was the king&#x27;s tenant-in-chief (which might cost him special taxes), and risk involvement in royal politics—or a request from the king for a personal loan (benevolence). Which men were ordered to council varied from council to council; a man might be so ordered once and never again, or all his life, but his son and heir might never go.

Under Henry VI of England, in the 15th century, just before the Wars of the Roses, attendance at Parliament became more valuable. The first claim of hereditary right to a writ comes from this reign; so does the first patent, or charter declaring a man to be a baron. The five orders began to be called peers. Holders of older peerages also began to receive greater honour than peers of the same rank just created.

If a man held a peerage, his son would succeed to it; if he had no children, his brother would succeed. If he had a single daughter, his son-in-law would inherit the family lands, and usually the same peerage; more complex cases were decided depending on circumstances. Customs changed with time; earldoms were the first to be hereditary, and three different rules can be traced for the case of an earl who left no sons and several married daughters. In the 13th century, the husband of the eldest daughter inherited the earldom automatically; in the 15th century, the earldom reverted to the Crown, who might re-grant it (often to the eldest son-in-law); in the 17th century, it would not be inherited by anybody unless all but one of the daughters died and left no descendants, in which case the remaining daughter (or her heir) would inherit.

After Henry II became the Lord of Ireland, he and his successors began to imitate the English system as it was in their time. Irish earls were first created in the 13th century, and Irish parliaments began later in the same century; until Henry VIII declared himself King of Ireland, these parliaments were small bodies, representing only the Irish Pale. A writ does not create a peerage in Ireland; all Irish peerages are by patent or charter, although some early patents have been lost. After James II left England, he was King of Ireland alone for a time; three creations he ordered then are in the Irish Patent Roll, although the patents were never issued; but these are treated as valid.

The Irish peers were in a peculiar political position: because they were subjects of the King of England, but peers in a different kingdom, they could sit in the English House of Commons, and many did. In the 18th century, Irish peerages became rewards for English politicians, limited only by the concern that they might go to Dublin and interfere with the Irish Government.

Scotland evolved a similar system, differing in points of detail. The first Scottish earldoms derive from the seven mormaers, of immemorial antiquity; they were named earls by Queen Margaret. The Parliament of Scotland is as old as the English; the Scottish equivalent of baronies are called lordships of Parliament.

The Act of Union 1707, between England and Scotland, provided that future peerages should be peers of Great Britain, and the rules covering the peers should follow the English model; because there were proportionately many more Scottish peers, they chose a number of representatives to sit in the British House of Lords. The Acts of Union 1800 changed this to peers of the United Kingdom, but provided that Irish peerages could still be created; but the Irish peers were concerned that their honours would be diluted as cheap prizes, and insisted that an Irish peerage could be created only when three Irish peerages had gone extinct (until there were only a hundred Irish peers left). In the early 19th century, Irish creations were as frequent as this allowed; but only three have been created since 1863, and none since 1898. As of 2011, only 66 &quot;only-Irish&quot; peers remain.

==Modern laws==
The law applicable to a British hereditary peerage depends on which Kingdom it belongs to. Peerages of England, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom follow English law; the difference between them is that peerages of England were created before the Act of Union 1707, peerages of Great Britain between 1707 and the Union with Ireland in 1800, and peerages of the United Kingdom since 1800. Irish peerages follow the law of the Kingdom of Ireland, which is very much similar to English law, except in referring to the Irish Parliament and Irish officials, generally no longer appointed; no Irish peers have been created since 1898, and they have no part in the present governance of the United Kingdom. Scottish peerage law is generally similar to English law, but differs in innumerable points of detail, often being more similar to medieval practice.

Women are ineligible to succeed to the majority of English, Irish, and British hereditary peerages, but may inherit certain English baronies by writ and Scottish peerages in the absence of a male heir.

==Ranks and titles==

The ranks of the peerage in most of the United Kingdom are, in descending order of rank, duke, marquess, earl, viscount and baron; the female equivalents are duchess, marchioness, countess, viscountess and baroness respectively. Women typically do not hold hereditary titles in their own right, except for certain peerages in the peerage of Scotland. One significant change to the status quo in England was in 1532 when Henry VIII created the Marquess of Pembroke title for his soon-to-be wife, Anne Boleyn; she held this title in her own right and was therefore ennobled with the same rank as a male.

In the Scottish peerage, the lowest rank is &quot;lordship of Parliament&quot;, the male holder thereof being known as a lord of Parliament. A Scottish &quot;barony&quot; is a feudal rank, and not of the Peerage. The barony by tenure or feudal barony in England and Wales was similar to a Scottish feudal barony, in being hereditary, but is long obsolete, the last full summons of the English feudal barons to military service having occurred in 1327. The Tenures Abolition Act 1660 finally quashed any remaining doubt as to their continued status.

Peerage dignities are created by the sovereign by either writs of summons or letters patent. Under modern constitutional conventions, no peerage dignity, with the possible exception of those given to members of the royal family, would be created if not upon the advice of the prime minister.

Many peers hold more than one hereditary title; for example, the same individual may be a duke, a marquess, an earl, a viscount, and a baron by virtue of different peerages. If such a person is entitled to sit in the House of Lords, he still only has one vote. However, until the House of Lords Act 1999 it was possible for one of the peer&#x27;s subsidiary titles to be passed to his heir before his death by means of a writ of acceleration, in which case the peer and his heir would have one vote each. Where this is not done, the heir may still use one of the father&#x27;s subsidiary titles as a &quot;courtesy title&quot;, but he is not considered a peer.

==Inheritance of peerages==

The mode of inheritance of an hereditary peerage is determined by the method of its creation. Titles may be created by writ of summons or by letters patent. The former is merely a summons of an individual to Parliament and does not explicitly confer a peerage; descent is always to the heirs of the body, male and female. The latter method explicitly creates a peerage and names the dignity in question. Letters patent may state the course of descent; usually, this is only to male heirs, but by a special remainder other descents can be specified. The Gender Recognition Act 2004 regulates acquired gender and provides that acquiring a new gender under the Act does not affect the descent of any peerage.

A child is deemed to be legitimate if its parents are married at the time of its birth or marry later; only legitimate children may succeed to a title, and furthermore, an English, Irish, or British (but not Scottish) peerage can only be inherited by a child born legitimate, not legitimated by a later marriage. An example of this can be seen in the film director Christopher Guest, who bypassed his older half-brother Anthony to became the 5th Baron Haden-Guest as the 4th Baron Haden-Guest was not married to Anthony&#x27;s mother at the time of his birth.

Normally, a peerage passes to the next holder on the death of the previous holder. However, Edward IV introduced a procedure known as a writ of acceleration, whereby it was possible for the eldest son of a peer holding more than one peerage to sit in the House of Lords by virtue of one of his father&#x27;s subsidiary dignities.

A person who is a possible heir to a peerage is said to be &quot;in remainder&quot;. A title becomes &quot;extinct&quot; (an opposite to &quot;extant&quot;, alive) when all possible heirs (as provided by the letters patent) have died out; i.e., there is nobody in remainder at the death of the holder. A title becomes &quot;dormant&quot; if nobody has claimed the title, or if no claim has been satisfactorily proven. A title goes into &quot;abeyance&quot; if there is more than one person equally entitled to be the holder.

In the past, peerages were sometimes &quot;&quot; or &quot;attainted&quot; under Acts of Parliament, most often as the result of treason on the part of the holder. The blood of an attainted peer was considered &quot;corrupted&quot;, consequently his or her descendants could not inherit the title. If all descendants of the attainted peer were to die out, however, then an heir from another branch of the family not affected by the attainder could take the title. The Forfeiture Act 1870 abolished corruption of blood; instead of losing the peerage, a peer convicted of treason would be disqualified from sitting in Parliament for the period of imprisonment.

The Titles Deprivation Act 1917 permitted the Crown to &quot;suspend&quot; peerages if their holders had fought against the United Kingdom during the First World War. Guilt was to be determined by a committee of the Privy Council; either House of Parliament could reject the committee&#x27;s report within 40 days of its presentation. In 1919, King George V issued an Order in Council suspending the Dukedom of Albany (together with its subsidiary peerages, the Earldom of Clarence and the Barony of Arklow), the Dukedom of Cumberland and Teviotdale (along with the Earldom of Armagh) and the Viscountcy of Taaffe (along with the Barony of Ballymote). Under the Titles Deprivation Act, the successors to the peerages may petition the Crown for a reinstatement of the titles; so far, none of them has chosen to do so (the Taaffe and Ballymote peerages would have become extinct in 1967).

Nothing prevents a British peerage from being held by a foreign citizen (although such peers cannot sit in the House of Lords, while the term &quot;foreign&quot; does not include Irish or Commonwealth citizens). Several descendants of George III were British peers and German subjects; the Lords Fairfax of Cameron were American citizens for several generations.

A peer may also &quot;disclaim&quot; an hereditary peerage under the Peerage Act 1963. To do so, the peer must deliver an instrument of disclaimer to the Lord Chancellor within 12 months of succeeding to the peerage, or, if under the age of 21 at the time of succession, within 12 months of becoming 21 years old. If, at the time of succession, the peer is a member of the House of Commons, then the instrument must be delivered within one month of succession; meanwhile, the peer may not sit or vote in the House of Commons. Prior to the House of Lords Act 1999, a hereditary peer could not disclaim a peerage after having applied for a writ of summons to Parliament; now, however, hereditary peers do not have the automatic right to a writ of summons to the House. Irish peerages may not be disclaimed. A peer who disclaims the peerage loses all titles, rights and privileges associated with the peerage; his wife or her husband is similarly affected. No further hereditary peerages may be conferred upon the person, but life peerages may be. The peerage remains without a holder until the death of the peer making the disclaimer, when it descends normally.
===Merging in the Crown===
A title held by someone who becomes monarch is said to &quot;merge in the Crown&quot; and therefore ceases to exist, because the sovereign cannot hold a dignity from himself.

The Dukedoms of Cornwall and of Rothesay, and the Earldom of Carrick, are special cases, which when not in use are said to &quot;lapse to the Crown&quot;: they are construed as existing, but held by no one, during such periods. These peerages are also special in that they are never directly inherited. The Dukedom of Cornwall was held formerly by the eldest son of the King of England, and the Dukedom of Rothesay, the Earldom of Carrick, and certain non-peerage titles (Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland) by the eldest son of the King of Scotland. Since those titles have been united, the dukedoms and associated subsidiary titles are held by the eldest son of the monarch. In Scotland, the title &quot;Duke of Rothesay&quot; is used for life or until accession. In England and Northern Ireland, the title &quot;Duke of Cornwall&quot; is used until the heir apparent is created Prince of Wales; at the same time as the principality is created, the duke is also created Earl of Chester. The earldom is a special case, because it is not hereditary, instead revesting or merging in the Crown if the prince succeeds to the Crown or predeceases the monarch: thus George III (then the grandson of the reigning monarch) was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester a month after the death of his father Frederick, Prince of Wales.

The Dukedom of Cornwall is associated with the Duchy of Cornwall; the former is a peerage dignity, while the latter is an estate held by the Duke of Cornwall. Income from the duchy goes to the Duke of Cornwall, or, when there is no duke, to the sovereign (but the money is then paid to the heir to the throne under the Sovereign Grant Act 2011). 

The only other duchy in the United Kingdom is the Duchy of Lancaster, which is also an estate rather than a peerage dignity. The Dukedom of Lancaster merged in the Crown when Henry of Monmouth, Duke of Lancaster became King Henry V. Nonetheless, the &quot;Duchy&quot; of Lancaster continues to exist, theoretically run by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (which is normally a sinecure position with no actual duties related to the duchy and is used to appoint a minister without portfolio). The Duchy of Lancaster is the inherited property that belongs personally to the monarch, rather than to the Crown. Thus, while income from the Crown Estate is turned over to the Exchequer in return for a sovereign grant payment, the income from the duchy forms a part of the Privy Purse, the personal funds of the Sovereign.

==Writs of summons==

At the beginning of each new parliament, each peer who has established his or her right to attend Parliament is issued a writ of summons. Without the writ, no peer may sit or vote in Parliament. The form of writs of summons has changed little over the centuries. It is established precedent that the sovereign may not deny writs of summons to qualified peers.

===Baronies by writ===
By modern English law, if a writ of summons was issued to a person who was not a peer, that person took his seat in Parliament, and the parliament was a parliament in the modern sense (including representatives of the Commons), that single writ created a barony, a perpetual peerage inheritable by male-preference primogeniture. This was not medieval practice, and it is doubtful whether any writ was ever issued with the intent of creating such a peerage. The last instance of a man being summoned by writ without already holding a peerage was under the early Tudors; the first clear decision that a single writ (as opposed to a long succession of writs) created a peerage was in Lord Abergavenny&#x27;s case of 1610. The House of Lords Act 1999 also renders it doubtful that such a writ would now create a peer if one were now issued; however, this doctrine is applied retrospectively: if it can be shown that a writ &quot;was&quot; issued, that the recipient sat and that the council in question was a parliament, the Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords determines who is now entitled to the peerage as though modern law had always applied. Several such long-lost baronies were claimed in the 19th and 20th centuries, though the committee was not consistent on what constituted proof of a writ, what constituted proof of sitting, and which 13th-century assemblages were actually parliaments. Even a writ issued in error is held to create a peerage unless the writ was cancelled before the recipient took his seat; the cancellation was performed by the now obsolete writ of &quot;supersedeas&quot;.

Peerages created by writ of summons are presumed to be inheritable only by the recipient&#x27;s &quot;heirs of the body.&quot; The House of Lords has settled such a presumption in several cases, including &quot;Lord Grey&#x27;s Case&quot; (1640) Cro Cas 601, the &quot;Clifton Barony Case&quot; (1673), the &quot;Vaux Peerage Case&quot; (1837) 5 Cl &amp; Fin 526, the &quot;Braye Peerage Case&quot; (1839) 6 Cl &amp; Fin 757 and the &quot;Hastings Peerage Case&quot; (1841) 8 Cl &amp; Fin 144. The meaning of &quot;heir of the body&quot; is determined by common law. Essentially, descent is by the rules of male primogeniture, a mechanism whereby normally, male descendants of the peer take precedence over female descendants, with children representing their deceased ancestors, and wherein the senior line of descent always takes precedence over the junior line per each gender. These rules, however, are amended by the proviso whereby sisters (and their heirs) are considered co-heirs; seniority of the line is irrelevant when succession is through a female line. In other words, no woman inherits because she is older than her sisters. If all of the co-heirs but one die, then the surviving co-heir succeeds to the title. Otherwise, the title remains abeyant until the sovereign &quot;terminates&quot; the abeyance in favour of one of the co-heirs. The termination of an abeyance is entirely at the discretion of the Crown.

A writ of acceleration is a type of writ of summons that enables the eldest son of a peer to attend the House of Lords using one of his father&#x27;s subsidiary titles. The title is strictly not inherited by the eldest son, however; it remains vested in the father. A writ may be granted only if the title being accelerated is a subsidiary one, and not the main title, and if the beneficiary of the writ is the heir-apparent of the actual holder of the title. A total of ninety-four writs of acceleration have been issued since Edward IV issued the first one, including four writs issued in the 20th century. The only individual who recently sat in the House of Lords by writ of acceleration is Viscount Cranborne in 1992, through the Barony of Cecil which was actually being held by his father, the Marquess of Salisbury. (Viscount Cranborne succeeded to the marquessate on the death of his father in 2003.)

There are no Scottish peerages created by writ; neither can Scottish baronies go into abeyance, for Scots law does not hold sisters as equal heirs regardless of age. Furthermore, there is only one extant barony by writ in the Peerage of Ireland, that of La Poer, now held by the Marquess of Waterford. (Certain other baronies were originally created by writ but later confirmed by letters patent.)

==Letters patent==
More often, letters patent are used to create peerages. Letters patent must explicitly name the recipient of the title and specify the course of descent; the exact meaning of the term is determined by common law. For remainders in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, the most common wording is &quot;to have and to hold unto him and the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten and to be begotten&quot;. Where the letters patent specifies the peer&#x27;s &quot;heirs male of the body&quot; as successors, the rules of agnatic succession apply, meaning that succession is through the male line only. Some very old titles, like the Earldom of Arlington, may pass to &quot;heirs of the body&quot; (not just heirs-male), these follow the same rules of descent as do baronies by writ and seem able to fall into abeyance as well. Many Scottish titles allow for passage to &quot;heirs general of the body&quot;, in which case the rules of male primogeniture apply; they do not fall into abeyance, as under Scots law, sisters are not treated as equal co-heirs. English and British letters patent that do not specify a course of descent are invalid, though the same is not true for the letters patent creating peers in the Peerage of Scotland. The House of Lords has ruled in certain cases that when the course of descent is not specified, or when the letters patent are lost, the title descends to heirs-male.

===Limitation to heirs of the body===
It is generally necessary for English patents to include limitation to heirs &quot;of the body&quot;, unless a special remainder is specified (see below). The limitation indicates that only lineal descendants of the original peer may succeed to the peerage. In some very rare instances, the limitation was left out. In the &quot;Devon Peerage Case&quot; (1831) 2 Dow &amp; Cl 200, the House of Lords permitted an heir who was a collateral descendant of the original peer to take his seat. The precedent, however, was reversed in 1859, when the House of Lords decided in the &quot;Wiltes Peerage Case&quot; (1869) LR 4 HL 126 that a patent that did not include the words &quot;of the body&quot; would be held void.

===Special remainder===
It is possible for a patent to allow for succession by someone other than an heir-male or heir of the body, under a so-called special remainder. Several instances may be cited: the Barony of Nelson (to an elder brother and his heirs-male), the Earldom of Roberts (to a daughter and her heirs-male), the Barony of Amherst (to a nephew and his heirs-male) and the Dukedom of Dover (to a younger son and his heirs-male while the eldest son is still alive). In many cases, at the time of the grant the proposed peer in question had no sons, nor any prospect of producing any, and the special remainder was made to allow remembrance of his personal honour to continue after his death and to preclude an otherwise certain rapid extinction of the peerage. However, in all cases the course of descent specified in the patent must be known in common law. For instance, the Crown may not make a &quot;shifting limitation&quot; in the letters patent; in other words, the patent may not vest the peerage in an individual and then, before that person&#x27;s death, shift the title to another person. The doctrine was established in the &quot;Buckhurst Peerage Case&quot; (1876) 2 App Cas 1, in which the House of Lords deemed invalid the clause intended to keep the Barony of Buckhurst separate from the Earldom of De La Warr (the invalidation of clause may not affect the validity of the letters patent itself). The patent stipulated that if the holder of the barony should ever inherit the earldom, then he would be deprived of the barony, which would instead pass to the next successor as if the deprived holder had died without issue.

===Amendment of letters patent===

Letters patent are not absolute; they may be amended or revoked by Act of Parliament. For example, Parliament amended the letters patent creating the Dukedom of Marlborough in 1706. The patent originally provided that the dukedom could be inherited by the heirs-male of the body of the first duke, Captain-General Sir John Churchill. One son had died in infancy and the other died in 1703 from smallpox. Under Parliament&#x27;s amendment to the patent, designed to allow the famous general&#x27;s honour to survive after his death, the dukedom was allowed to pass to the Duke&#x27;s daughters; Lady Henrietta, the Countess of Sunderland, the Countess of Bridgewater and Lady Mary and their heirs-male—and thereafter &quot;to all and every other the issue male and female, lineally descending of or from the said Duke of Marlborough, in such manner and for such estate as the same are before limited to the before-mentioned issue of the said Duke, it being intended that the said honours shall continue, remain, and be invested in all the issue of the said Duke, so long as any such issue male or female shall continue, and be held by them severally and successively in manner and form aforesaid, the elder and the descendants of every elder issue to be preferred before the younger of such issue.&quot;

==Number of hereditary peers==
The number of peers has varied considerably with time. At the end of the Wars of the Roses, which killed many peers, and degraded or attainted many others, there were only 29 Lords Temporal; but the population of England was also much . The Tudors doubled the number of Peers, creating many but executing others; at the death of Queen Elizabeth I, there were 59. 

The number of peers then grew under the Stuarts and all later monarchs. By the time of Queen Anne&#x27;s death in 1714, there were 168 peers. In 1712, Queen Anne was called upon to create 12 peers in one day in order to pass a government measure, more than Queen Elizabeth I had created during a 45-year reign.

Several peers were alarmed at the rapid increase in the size of the Peerage, fearing that their individual importance and power would decrease as the number of peers increased. Therefore, in 1719, a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to place a limitation on the Crown&#x27;s power. It sought to permit no more than six new creations, and thereafter one new creation for each other title that became extinct. But it did allow the Crown to bestow titles on members of the Royal Family without any such limitation. The Bill was rejected in its final stage in the Lords, but it was passed in the Lords when it was reintroduced in the next year. Nonetheless, the House of Commons rejected the Peerage Bill by 269 to 177.

George III was especially profuse with the creation of titles, mainly due to the desire of some of his Prime Ministers to obtain a majority in the House of Lords. During his 12 years in power, Lord North had about 30 new peerages created. During William Pitt the Younger&#x27;s 17-year tenure, over 140 new peerages were awarded.

A restriction on the creation of peerages, but only in the Peerage of Ireland, was enacted under the Acts of Union 1800 that combined Ireland and Great Britain into the United Kingdom in 1801. New creations were restricted to a maximum of one new Irish peerage for every three existing Irish peerages that became extinct, excluding those held concurrently with an English or British peerage; only if the total number of Irish peers dropped below 100 could the Sovereign create one new Irish peerage for each extinction.

There were no restrictions on creations in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The Peerage continued to swell through the 19th century. In the 20th century, there were even more creations, as Prime Ministers were again eager to secure majorities in the House of Lords. Peerages were handed out not to honour the recipient but to give him a seat in the House of Lords.

==Current status==
Since the start of the Labour government of Harold Wilson in 1964, the practice of granting hereditary peerages has largely ceased except for members of the royal family. Only seven hereditary peers have been created since 1965: four in the royal family (the Duke of York, the Earl of Wessex, the Duke of Cambridge, and the Duke of Sussex) and three additional creations under Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government (the Viscount Whitelaw [had four daughters], the Viscount Tonypandy [had no issue] and the Earl of Stockton [with issue]). The two viscounts died without male heirs, extinguishing their titles. Harold Macmillan, 1st Earl of Stockton received the earldom customarily bestowed on former prime ministers after he retired from the House of Commons. As for the practice of granting hereditary titles (usually earldoms) to male commoners who married into the royal family, the latest offer of such peerage was in 1973 to Captain Mark Phillips (husband of The Princess Anne) who declined, and the most recent to accept was the Earl of Snowdon (husband of The Princess Margaret) in 1961.

There is no statute that prevents the creation of new hereditary peerages; they may technically be created at any time, and the government continues to maintain pro forma letters patent for their creation. The most recent policies outlining the creation of new peerages, the Royal Warrant of 2004, explicitly apply to both hereditary and life peers. However, successive governments have largely disowned the practice, and the Royal Household website currently describes the King as the fount of honour for &quot;life peerages, knighthoods and gallantry awards&quot;, with no mention of hereditary titles. 

===Roles===
Until the coming into force of the Peerage Act 1963, peers could not disclaim their peerage in order to sit in the House of Commons, and thus a peerage was sometimes seen as an impediment to a future political career. The law changed due to an agreement that the Labour MP Tony Benn (formerly the Viscount Stansgate) having been deprived of his seat due to an inadvertent inheritance was undemocratic, and the desire of the Conservatives to put their choice of prime minister (ultimately Alec Douglas-Home) into the House of Commons, which by that time was deemed politically necessary.

In 1999, the House of Lords Act abolished the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords. Out of about 750 hereditary peers, only 92 may sit in the House of Lords. The Act provides that 90 of those 92 seats are to be elected by other members of the House: 15 by vote of the whole house (including life peers), 42 by the Conservative hereditary peers, two by the Labour hereditary peers, three by the Liberal Democrat hereditary peers, and 28 by the crossbench hereditary peers. Elections were held in October and November 1999 to choose those initial 90 peers, with all hereditary peers eligible to vote. Hereditary peers elected hold their seats until their death, resignation or exclusion for non-attendance (the latter two means introduced by the House of Lords Reform Act 2014), at which point by-elections are held to maintain the number at 92. In 2024, the Starmer Labour government announced in the King&#x27;s speech that they would bring in legislation to abolish the remaining hereditary peers&#x27; right to sit in the House of Lords.

The remaining two hold their seats by right of the hereditary offices of Earl Marshal and Lord Great Chamberlain. These offices are hereditary in themselves, and in recent times have been held by the Dukes of Norfolk and the Barons Carrington respectively. These are the only two hereditary peers whose right to sit is automatic.

The Government reserves a number of political and ceremonial positions for hereditary peers. To encourage hereditary peers in the House of Lords to follow the party line, a number of lords-in-waiting (government whips) are usually hereditary peers. This practice was not adhered to by the Labour government of 1997–2010 due to the small number of Labour hereditary peers in the House of Lords.

===Modern composition of the hereditary peerage===

The peerage has traditionally been associated with high gentry, the British nobility, and in recent times, the Conservative Party. Only a tiny proportion of wealthy people are peers, but the peerage includes a few of the very wealthiest people in the UK, such as Hugh Grosvenor (the Duke of Westminster) and Lord Salisbury, and indeed the world in the case of David Thomson, 3rd Baron Thomson of Fleet. A few peers own one or more of England&#x27;s largest estates passed down through inheritance, particularly those with medieval roots: until the late 19th century the dominant English and Scottish land division on death was primogeniture.

However, the proliferation of peerage creations in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century resulted in even minor political figures entering the ranks of the peerage; these included newspaper owners (e.g. Alfred Harmsworth) and trade union leaders (e.g. Walter Citrine). As a result, there are many hereditary peers who have taken up careers which do not fit traditional conceptions of aristocracy. For example, Arup Kumar Sinha, 6th Baron Sinha, is a computer technician working for a travel agency; Matt Ridley, 5th Viscount Ridley, is a popular science writer; Timothy Bentinck, 12th Earl of Portland, is an actor and plays David Archer in the BBC&#x27;s long-running radio soap opera, &quot;The Archers&quot;; and Peter St Clair-Erskine, 7th Earl of Rosslyn, is a former Metropolitan Police Service Commander. The Earl of Longford was a socialist and prison reformer, while Tony Benn, who renounced his peerage as Viscount Stansgate (only for his son to reclaim the family title after his death) was a senior government minister (later a writer and orator) with left-wing policies.

====Gender distribution====

As the vast majority of hereditary peerages can only be inherited by men, the number of peeresses in their own right is very small; only 18 out of 758 hereditary peers by succession, or 2.4%, were female, as of 1992.
All female hereditary peers succeeding after 1980 have been to English or Scottish peerages originally created before 1700. Of the over 800 hereditary peerages created since 1863, only 13 could be inherited by daughters of the original recipient, and none can be inherited by granddaughters or higher-order female descendants of the original recipient. The 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma was the last woman to hold such a post-1900 title from 1979 until her death in 2017.

From 1963 (when female hereditary peers were allowed to enter the House of Lords) to 1999, there has been a total of 25 female hereditary peers.

Of those 92 currently sitting in the House of Lords, none are female, since the retirement of Margaret of Mar, 31st Countess of Mar, in 2020. Originally five female peers were elected under the House of Lords Act 1999 (out of seven female candidates; all of them crossbenchers). But all of these have since died or resigned, and no woman has stood in a by-election to a vacant Lords seat since 1999.
A single female peer, the 29th Baroness Dacre, is listed in the &quot;Register of Hereditary Peers&quot; among about 200 male peers as willing to stand in by-elections, as of October 2020.

<doc id="604705" wikidata="Q5870179" url="?curid=604705" title="History of the British peerage">
<text>The history of the British peerage, a system of nobility found in the United Kingdom, stretches over the last thousand years. The current form of the British peerage has been a process of development. While the ranks of baron and earl predate the British peerage itself, the ranks of duke and marquess were introduced to England in the 14th century. The rank of viscount came later, in the mid-15th century. Peers were summoned to Parliament, forming the House of Lords.

The unions of England and Scotland to form Great Britain in 1707, and of Great Britain and Ireland to form the United Kingdom in 1801, led successively to the establishment of the Peerages of Great Britain and later of the United Kingdom, and the discontinuation of creations in the Peerages of England and Scotland. Scottish and Irish peers did not have an automatic right to sit in the House of Lords, and instead elected representative peers from amongst their number.

Peerages were largely hereditary until the regular creation of life peers began in the second half of the 20th century. The last creation of a non-royal hereditary peer occurred in 1984; even then it was considered unusual. Life peers and 92 hereditary peers still retain the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords, though their power is restricted and further reform of the House of Lords is under consideration.

== English peerage ==
=== Anglo-Saxon period (5th century – 1066) ===
==== 5th–8th century ====
In the 5th century, Germanic peoples collectively known as Anglo-Saxons migrated to sub-Roman Britain and came to dominate the east and southeast of the island. Based on archaeological evidence (such as burials and buildings), these early communities appear to have lacked any social elite. Around half the population were free, independent farmers (Old English: ) who cultivated a hide of land (enough to provide for a family). Slaves, mostly native Britons, made up the other half.

By the late 6th century, the archeological evidence (grander burials and buildings) suggests the development of a social elite. The early law codes of Kent use the Old English word (, ) to describe a nobleman. By the 8th century, the word &quot;gesith&quot; (; Latin: ) had replaced as the common term for a nobleman.

==== 900–1066 ====
By the 10th century, Anglo-Saxon society was divided into three main social classes: slaves, (), and (, ). &quot;Thegn&quot; (Old English: ) meant servant or warrior, and it replaced the term &quot;gesith&quot; in the 10th century. Law codes assigned a weregeld or man price of 200 shillings for a and 1,200s for a thegn. Children inherited thegnly status from their father, and a thegnly woman who married a retained her noble status. 

Not all were peasants. Some were themselves landlords, and these prosperous free men could aspire to thegnly rank. Archbishop Wulfstan of York (1002–1023) wrote that a had to own five hides to qualify for thegnhood. The legal text &quot;Norðleoda laga&quot; () concurred but added that the property qualification had to be met for three generations.

In 1066, there were an estimated 5,000 thegns in England. These were divided into three ranks: ealdormen, king&#x27;s thegns, and median thegns. The ealdorman was an official appointed by the king to administer a shire or group of shires (an ealdormanry). In the 11th century, while England was ruled by a Danish dynasty, the office changed from ealdorman to earl (related to Old English and Scandinavian ). After the king, the earl was the most powerful secular magnate. During Edward the Confessor&#x27;s reign (1042–1066), there were four principal earldoms: Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria, and East Anglia. 

Below ealdormen were king&#x27;s thegns, so called because they only served the king. The lowest thegnly rank were the median thegns who owed service to other thegns. Thegns were the backbone of local government and the military. Sheriffs were drawn from this class, and thegns were required to attend the shire court and give judgment. For these reasons, historian David Carpenter described thegns as &quot;the country gentry of Anglo-Saxon England&quot;.

High-ranking members of the church hierarchy (archbishops, bishops and abbots) paralleled the secular aristocracy. The church&#x27;s power derived from its spiritual authority as well as its virtual monopoly on education. Secular government depended on educated clergy to function, and prelates were important politicians and royal advisers in the witan (the king&#x27;s council).

=== Post-Conquest baronage (1066–1299) ===

After the Norman Conquest of 1066, William the Conqueror () confiscated the property of the old Anglo-Saxon nobility and granted it to the king&#x27;s Norman followers according to the rules of feudalism—vassals were granted fiefs in return for military service and counsel. These tenants-in-chief would then grant land to their own vassals. The greater tenants-in-chief were large landowners known as feudal barons who held tenure by barony ( in Latin) and were distinguished by certain rights and responsibilities from other tenants-in-chief who held tenure by knight-service. 

There were around 170 barons. The baronage was largely untitled, but a small number of barons (never more than 25 at one time) enjoyed the title of earl, the only hereditary title in England before 1337. The historian David Crouch defined &quot;baron&quot; as &quot;the greatest men in the aristocracy (whether they were earls, barons or not), men habitually at court, lords of great estates, those indeed whom the king consulted in the affairs of the realm&quot;. 

The fiefs of earls and barons were called &quot;honours&quot;. The honours were not compact territorial units. The Conqueror purposely spread manors over several shires to dilute the power of the barons. For example, the largest landholder after the king was Robert, count of Mortain. He held 793 manors spread out over twenty shires. The Honour of Peverel was spread over ten shires. Except in northern England and the Welsh Marches, it was rare for the estates of any lordship to be contiguous. The ten wealthiest barons in 1086 were:

# Robert of Mortain, the earl of Cornwall
# Odo of Bayeux, the earl of Kent
# William FitzOsbern, the earl of Hereford
# Roger of Montgomery, the earl of Shrewsbury
# William of Warenne, the earl of Surrey
# Hugh of Avranches, the earl of Chester
# Eustace of Boulogne
# Richard of Clare
# Geoffrey of Coutances
# Geoffrey of Mandeville

Barons enjoyed greater access to the king than did other subjects and were exempt from jury service. Though they could be tried in ordinary courts, their amercements could only be assessed by the barons of the exchequer or before the king himself. The baronage had a duty as tenants-in-chief to provide the king with advice when summoned to great councils. During the reign of Henry III (1216–1272), the great council evolved into Parliament, a representative body that increasingly asserted for itself the right to consent to taxation. Initially, participation in Parliament was still determined by one&#x27;s status as a tenant-in-chief. Earls and greater barons received a writ of summons issued directly from the king, while lesser barons were summoned through the local sheriffs. 

By the 13th century, the criteria for establishing baronial tenure was long forgotten. According to Ivor John Sanders, &quot;both tenants-in-chief and the royal officials were ignorant of any principle of law upon which the liability to tenure could be based&quot;, so a person&#x27;s baronial status was based on whether the records stated he held . In the reign of Edward I (1272–1307), the first hereditary barons were created by writ. Over time, baronies by writ became the main method of creating baronies, and baronies by tenure became obsolete.

=== Medieval peerage (1300–1500) ===
The concept of peerage was borrowed from France. The peerage of France was limited to the highest ranking French nobility, six prelates and six magnates.

Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, declared that &quot;No free man shall be seized, imprisoned, dispossessed, outlawed, exiled or ruined in any way, nor in any way proceeded against, except by the lawful judgement of his peers&quot;. In the charter, the word &quot;peer&quot; meant &quot;equal&quot;, but this ambiguous wording led to disputes over who was equal to an earl or baron and therefore who could sit in judgment of earls and barons. When Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, used the language of peerage to appeal to other magnates in 1233, the king&#x27;s minister Peter des Rosches responded angrily that there were no peers in England &quot;as there were in the realm of France&quot;. This response was likely due to fears that a recognized peerage could challenge royal authority. By the reign of Edward II (1307–1327), however, it had become standard to refer to magnates as peers of the realm.

The Peerage, still, was not an hereditary body. Kings did not consider themselves, having once summoned an individual, bound to summon the same individual, much less his heirs, to future Parliaments. Thus, writs were issued at the whim of the King. Over time, however, the arbitrary power of the Crown was fettered by the principles of hereditary right. At first, the writ of summons was regarded as a burden and interference, but later, when Parliament&#x27;s power increased, it was seen as a sign of royal favour. Since the Crown was itself an hereditary dignity, it seemed natural for seats in the upper House of Parliament to be so as well. By the beginning of the fourteenth century, the Peerage had evolved its hereditary characteristics. Since under Norman customs, estates devolved under the principles of primogeniture, seats in Parliament did so as well.

Barons sat in Parliament by a combination of tenure and writs of summons issued to them. If a woman held a barony, her husband was summoned to Parliament in her right. The concept of a barony as a personal dignity not tied to land arose only when, in about 1388, Richard II created John Beauchamp a baron by letters patent. The Lord de Beauchamp was a baron not by tenure but rather by the will of the Crown. Letters patent and writs of summons were both used to create peerage dignities until the reign of Henry VIII, when the latter method fell into desuetude. Some peerage dignities, however, have been created by writs of summons since that time. In most cases, such peerage dignities were created when a writ was issued to an individual under the misapprehension that he was entitled to a peerage dignity created by letters patent. The Barony of Strange is an example of a peerage dignity created due to an error.

Earls appear to have sat in Parliament by virtue of their baronies, and not their earldoms. The separation of the two dignities seems to have arisen after the advent of the usage of letters patent to create peerage dignities. In some cases, a baron who held a dignity created by a writ of summons was created an Earl, and the two dignities later separated, the barony devolving upon the heir-general, and the earldom to an heir-male.

While kings of England possessed the subsidiary titles of Duke of Normandy (until 1259) and Duke of Aquitaine, no English duchy was created before the 1300s possibly because kings did not want their subjects possessing the same title as themselves. The first English duke was Edward III&#x27;s eldest son, Edward the Black Prince, who was created Duke of Cornwall in 1337. In 1351, Henry of Grosmont was made Duke of Lancaster, the first non-royal dukedom.

In 1385, Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford, the favourite of Richard II, was created Marquess of Dublin for life, making him the first person to hold a dignity of such a rank between dukes and earls. Subsequent marquessates were created rarely; the Marquess of Winchester, whose dignity was created in 1551, is the only English marquess without a dukedom. The rank of viscount was introduced from Europe in 1440, when John, Baron Beaumont, was created Viscount Beaumont, with precedence between earls and barons.

Under Henry VI of England, in the fifteenth century, just before the Wars of the Roses, attendance at Parliament became more valuable. The first claim of hereditary right to a writ comes from this reign; so does the first patent, or charter declaring a man to be a Baron; and the five orders began to be called Peers; holders of older peerages also began receive greater honour than Peers of the same rank just created.

If a man held a peerage, his son would succeed to it; if he had no children, his brother would succeed. If he had a single daughter, his son-in-law would inherit the family lands, and usually the same Peerage; more complex cases were decided depending on circumstances. Customs changed with time; Earls were the first to be hereditary, and three different rules can be traced for the case of an Earl who left no sons and several married daughters. In the thirteenth century, the husband of the eldest daughter inherited the Earldom automatically; in the fifteenth century, the Earldom reverted to the Crown, who might regrant it (often to the eldest son-in-law); in the seventeenth century, it wouldn&#x27;t be inherited by anybody unless all but one of the daughters died and left no descendants, in which case the remaining daughter (or her heir) would inherit.

During the reign of Henry VIII, peers attempted to consolidate and secure their position. They declared themselves &quot;ennobled in blood,&quot; and suggested that no peerage could be extinguished except by an Act of Parliament, upon the extinction of all heirs to it, or upon forfeiture for treason or felony. The Spiritual Lords had attempted to secure the privileges of the Peerage while maintaining their ecclesiastical privileges, but lost in both attempts. Nonetheless, they were in the majority in the House of Lords until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, which removed the abbots and priors from the House. Thereafter, the temporal peers formed for the first time a majority in the Lords.

==Scottish and Irish peerages==
Scotland evolved a similar system, differing in points of detail. The first Scottish Earldoms derive from the seven mormaers, of immemorial antiquity; they were named Earls by Queen Margaret. The Parliament of Scotland is as old as the English; the Scottish equivalent of baronies are called lordships of Parliament.

After Henry II became the Lord of Ireland, he and his successors began to imitate the English system as it was in their time. Irish Earls were first created in the thirteenth century, and Irish Parliaments began in the fifteenth century, complete with seven Barons of Parliament. The Irish peers were in a peculiar political position; because they were subjects of the King of England, but peers in a different kingdom, they could sit in the English House of Commons, and many did. In the eighteenth century, Irish peerages became rewards for English politicians, limited only by the concern that they might go to Dublin and interfere with the Irish Government.

The Acts of Union 1707, between England and Scotland, provided that future peerages should be peers of Great Britain, and the rules covering the peers should follow the English model; because there were proportionately many more Scottish peers, they chose a number of representatives to sit in the British House of Lords. The Acts of Union 1800 changed this to peers of the United Kingdom, but provided that Irish peerages could still be created. However, the Irish peers were concerned that their honours would be diluted as cheap prizes, and insisted that an Irish peerage be created only when three Irish peerages had gone extinct (until there were only 100 Irish peers left). In the early nineteenth century, Irish creations were as frequent as this allowed; but only three have been created since 1863, and none since 1898.

==Stuart monarchs==
In 1603, James VI of Scotland became King James I of England. Scotland&#x27;s Peerage then became subject to many of the same principles as the English Peerage, though many peculiarities of Scottish law continue to apply to it today. Scotland, like England, had lesser and greater barons, as well as earls. There was but one Duke in Scotland: the Duke of Rothesay, the heir-apparent to the Crown. The weak nature of the Scottish Crown had permitted the lesser feudal barons to continue attending the Scottish Estates, or Parliament, until the fifteenth century. Thereafter, only Earls and Lords of Parliament (the greater barons) came to be summoned to the Estates. In Scotland, the peerage remained tied to land until after the Union. Every earldom or lordship of Parliament was accompanied by a grant of land; sometimes, peerages and their associated lands were surrendered in return for other peerages and lands. After the Union of the Crowns, however, the concept of the Peerage as a personal dignity, not a dignity affixed to land, became established in Scotland.

James I had poor relations with the English Parliament, which had been less submissive than the Scottish Estates that he had been accustomed to. To raise funds without taxation, James began to sell titles. For instance, individuals paying £1095 could obtain the non-peerage hereditary dignity of baronet. Even peerage dignities were sold. Thus, James I added sixty-two peers to a body that had included just fifty-nine members at the commencement of his reign. His Stuart successors were no less profuse.

The position of the Peerage was called into question after the English Revolution that overthrew Charles I. In 1648, the House of Commons passed an Act abolishing the House of Lords, &quot;finding by too long experience that the House of Lords is useless and dangerous to the people of England.&quot; The Peerage was not abolished, and peers became entitled to be elected to the sole remaining House of Parliament. Oliver Cromwell, the &quot;de facto&quot; dictator, later found it convenient to re-establish a second chamber to reduce the power of the Commons. About sixty writs of summons, resembling those issued to peers sitting in the House of Lords, were issued. The individuals so summoned were called Lords, but their dignities were not hereditary. But soon after the establishment of this body, Cromwell dissolved Parliament, taking power into his own hands as Lord Protector.

Soon after Cromwell&#x27;s death, the monarchy was restored, as was the House of Lords. King Charles II continued the Stuart tendency of profusely creating peerages, even eclipsing the figures of James I&#x27;s reign. Several of those dignities went to Charles&#x27; many mistresses and illegitimate sons. Charles II&#x27;s reign was also marked by the persecution of Roman Catholics after Titus Oates falsely suggested that there was a &quot;Popish Plot&quot; to murder the King. Catholic peers were hindered from the House of Lords because they were forced, before taking their seats, to recite a declaration that denounced some of the Roman Church&#x27;s doctrines as &quot;superstitious and idolatrous.&quot; These provisions would not be repealed until 1829.

The next major event in the history of the Peerage occurred in 1707, when England and Scotland united into Great Britain. There were, at the time, one hundred and sixty-eight English peers and one hundred and fifty-four Scottish ones. English peers did not wish for their individual significance in the House of Lords to dwindle, so they agreed to permit Scotland to elect just sixteen Scottish representative peers to sit in the House of Lords (see representative peer). After the Union, creations in both the Peerage of England and the Peerage of Scotland ceased and all new peerages were created in the Peerage of Great Britain.

The individual power of peers did, however, reduce as more peerages were created. At one point, Anne created twelve peers in one day. The Tory government requested these creations, known as Harley&#x27;s Dozen, in order to secure a majority for their Peace policy in a previously Whig-dominated House. In response to the increase in creations, the House of Lords proposed a bill to restrict its numbers in 1719, but the Peerage Bill failed in the House of Commons.

==Hanoverian monarchs==
Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which devolved the Crown, after Anne&#x27;s death, upon George, Elector of Hanover, the Queen&#x27;s closest Protestant relative, bypassing about 50 others in the line of succession. As the power of the monarch slowly shifted to Parliament, peerage dignities came to be conferred at the behest of ministers, not at the pleasure of the Crown.

King George III&#x27;s reign is of particular note in the history of the Peerage. Increases to the Peerage during the time were totally unprecedented: almost four hundred peers were created during his reign. Lord North and William Pitt the Younger were especially liberal in dispensing peerage dignities, a device used to obtain majorities in the House of Lords. It became apparent that the representation of Scottish peers was inadequate: they had continued to elect but sixteen peers, while the number of British peers had increased tremendously. To account for this deficiency in representation, British hereditary peerages were granted to Scottish peers, thereby entitling them to sit in the House of Lords.

In 1801, Ireland united with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom. Ireland became entitled to elect twenty-eight of their number to sit in the House of Lords as representative peers. Unlike the Union of Scotland and England, the Crown retained the right to create one new Irish peerage dignity every time three previous ones became extinct, until the number of Irish peers without British peerages amounted to one hundred, when further creations would be permitted as often as necessary to maintain that number. Since Irish peers were not automatically entitled to representation in the Lords, individuals could be created Irish peers so as to honour them without further swelling the numbers of the House of Lords. There were only 21 creations of new Irish peerages after the Union; all other new peerages since 1801 have been created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

In 1832, the Reform Act was passed, abolishing many of England&#x27;s &quot;rotten&quot; boroughs, an example of which was Old Sarum, with an electorate of seven. Such small boroughs were often &quot;owned&quot; by peers, whose nominees were almost always elected. The Reform Act and further Acts reduced the influence of peers in the lower house, and therefore their overall political power.

An important development of the nineteenth century was the Law Lord. In 1856, it was deemed necessary to add a legally qualified peer to the House of Lords: the Lords exercised, and still exercise, certain judicial functions, but did not necessarily include a sufficient number of peers well-versed in law. So that the number of hereditary peers would not be further increased, Victoria made Sir James Parke, a baron of the Exchequer, a life peer as Baron Wensleydale. The Lords refused to admit him, deeming that nothing but an Act of Parliament could change the fundamental hereditary characteristic of the Lords. Bills were later introduced to permit the creation of life peerages, but these failed. Only in 1876, twenty years after the Wensleydale case, was the Appellate Jurisdiction Act passed, authorising the appointment of two Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (commonly called Law Lords) to sit in the House of Lords as barons. They were to hold the rank of baron for life, but sit in the Lords only until retiring from judicial office. In 1887, they were permitted to continue to sit in the Lords for life; the number of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary was also increased by further enactments.

==Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Windsor monarchs==
In the twentieth century, peers were almost always created to reward political merit, and creations became much more common. The peerage ceased to be associated with wealth or land ownership. At the beginning of the century, however, such associations remained for some time. In 1909, Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George proposed the introduction of a land tax, which the landowning peers opposed. The House of Lords rejected the budget. After the general election of January 1910, the returned government introduced the Parliament Bill, which sought to curtail the powers of the Lords. When the Lords attempted to block the bill, the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, threatened to have the king create two hundred and fifty new Liberal peers to neutralise the Conservative majority in the House of Lords. The Lords then passed the Parliament Act, which provides that most bills can only be delayed, not rejected, by the House of Lords.

Later in the same decade, the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 was passed. Some British peers had fought against the British in World War I; the act permitted the suspension of their titles. In 1919, three peers—Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Albany, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Henry Taaffe, 12th Viscount Taaffe—had their peerage dignities suspended. The successors to those dignities may petition for their restoration, but none has chosen to do so.

Another issue of the 1920s was the admission of women to the House of Lords. The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 provided that &quot;A person shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from the exercise of any public function.&quot; In 1922, the Viscountess Rhondda, a &quot;suo jure&quot; peeress, attempted to take a seat in the House of Lords. Though the Law Lords declared that she was, under the act, eligible, Lady Rhondda was not admitted by a decision of the committee for privileges. Many Conservatives were opposed to admitting women to the House of Lords. Liberals, meanwhile, felt that admitting hereditary peeresses would extend the hereditary principle which they so detested.

Women were eventually admitted to the House of Lords in 1958. The Life Peerages Act passed that year permitted the creation of life baronies for both men and women on a regular basis. Hereditary peeresses were admitted in 1963 under the Peerage Act. The Peerage Act also permitted peers to disclaim hereditary peerages within a year of succeeding to them, or within a year of attaining the age of majority. All eligible Scottish peers were permitted to sit in the House of Lords, and elections for representative peers ceased. Elections for Irish representative peers had already ended in 1922, when most of Ireland left the United Kingdom to become the Irish Free State.

Hereditary peerages continued to be created after 1958 but when Harold Wilson, of the Labour Party, became prime minister in 1964 he ceased to recommend the creation of hereditary peerages and neither of his successors, Edward Heath (of the Conservative Party) and James Callaghan (of the Labour Party), recommended hereditary peerage creations. Since then, hereditary peerages have not been regularly created outside of members of the royal family. Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative, did revive the practice of creating hereditary peers while she was prime minister: Harold Macmillan became Earl of Stockton in 1984, George Thomas became Viscount Tonypandy, and William Whitelaw became Viscount Whitelaw, both in 1983. The peerages of the latter two became extinct upon their deaths; the Earldom of Stockton survives. Thatcher&#x27;s husband received an hereditary baronetcy, but she herself was created a life baroness on recommendation of her successor, John Major.

Hereditary peerages continue to be created for members of the royal family. Prince Andrew was created Duke of York in 1986, Prince Edward was created Earl of Wessex in 1999, Prince William was created Duke of Cambridge in 2011, and Prince Harry was created Duke of Sussex in 2018 (all on the occasion of their marriages).

After the Labour Party came to power in 1997, it began further reform of the House of Lords. Under the House of Lords Act 1999, hereditary peerages do not entitle individuals to seats in the House of Lords. The Act did provide exemptions for the Earl Marshal, the Lord Great Chamberlain and ninety others elected by the peers. Further reform of the Lords is under consideration.

<text>William Frederick &quot;Woody&quot; Woodward (born September 23, 1942) is an American former professional baseball player, college baseball coach, and general manager. He played in Major League Baseball, primarily as a shortstop from 1963 to 1971 for the Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds. Woodward is better known for his tenure as general manager of the Seattle Mariners.

==Playing career==
===Amateur===
Woodward played baseball at Coral Gables Senior High School and led the team to the 1960 Class AA state title. He attended Florida State University, where he played for the Florida State Seminoles baseball team. In 1963 he was named third-team All-American and was named to the College World Series all-tournament squad.

===Professional===
During his Major League Baseball career, Woodward played for the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves (1963–68) and the Cincinnati Reds (1968–71). A shortstop and second baseman, Woodward appeared in 880 games with 517 hits. He had a career .236 batting average with one home run and 148 runs batted in. He was acquired along with Tony Cloninger and Clay Carroll by the Reds from the Atlanta Braves for Milt Pappas, Bob Johnson and Ted Davidson on June 11, 1968.

On July 10, 1970, Woodward hit his only major league home run in 2,423 plate appearances, a two-run shot off Ron Reed against the Atlanta Braves. Afterwards Woodward was quoted as saying, &quot;If I hit one home run per every seven seasons, it will take me 4,998 seasons to catch Babe Ruth.&quot; He played in four games of the 1970 World Series, which the Reds lost to the Baltimore Orioles in five games, with Woodward totaling one hit in five at bats.

Woodward was involved in a bizarre incident on September 4, 1971. During a game against the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium, a sack of flour fell out of the sky and landed approximately 10 feet from where Woodward was standing.

==Post-playing career==
After a brief stint as Reds TV commentator, Woodward returned to FSU from 1975 to 1978 as head baseball coach, where his teams earned three NCAA tournament bids and one College World Series bid.

===Front Office===
After working as an assistant general manager for both the Cincinnati Reds and New York Yankees, Woodward was named the general manager of the New York Yankees in October 1986. His resignation at the end of the 1987 season led to a flurry of moves as then-manager Lou Piniella was promoted to general manager, and (for the fifth time) Billy Martin was named Yankees manager.

====Phillies====
The Philadelphia Phillies hired Woodward as general manager in October 1987, and fired him in June 1988. Phillies president Bill Giles refused to cite a reason for the termination after just six months. &quot;It was a philosophical difference and that was the bottom line,&quot; said Woodward, who said he was &#x27;shocked and disappointed&#x27; by his dismissal.

====Mariners====
In July 1988, Woodward became the general manager of the Seattle Mariners, working there until his retirement at the end of 1999. During his tenure, the Mariners made the playoffs in 1995 and 1997. His draft picks included Alex Rodriguez, Jason Varitek, Derek Lowe, Bret Boone, and Raúl Ibañez. Perhaps his most notable trade was in 1989, acquiring Randy Johnson from the Montreal Expos (or trading away David Ortiz). He later traded Johnson to the Houston Astros in 1998.

In January 2009, the Mariners hired Woodward as a part-time scout.

===Honors===
Woodward is a 1981 inductee of the Florida State University Athletic Hall of Fame.

<text>In logic, a truth function is a function that accepts truth values as input and produces a unique truth value as output. In other words: the input and output of a truth function are all truth values; a truth function will always output exactly one truth value, and inputting the same truth value(s) will always output the same truth value. The typical example is in propositional logic, wherein a compound statement is constructed using individual statements connected by logical connectives; if the truth value of the compound statement is entirely determined by the truth value(s) of the constituent statement(s), the compound statement is called a truth function, and any logical connectives used are said to be truth functional.

Classical propositional logic is a truth-functional logic, in that every statement has exactly one truth value which is either true or false, and every logical connective is truth functional (with a correspondent truth table), thus every compound statement is a truth function. On the other hand, modal logic is non-truth-functional.

== Overview ==
A logical connective is truth-functional if the truth-value of a compound sentence is a function of the truth-value of its sub-sentences. A class of connectives is truth-functional if each of its members is. For example, the connective &quot;&quot;and&quot; is truth-functional since a sentence like &quot;Apples are fruits and carrots are vegetables&quot; is true &quot;if, and only if,&quot; each of its sub-sentences &quot;apples are fruits&quot; and &quot;carrots are vegetables&quot;&quot; is true, and it is false otherwise. Some connectives of a natural language, such as English, are not truth-functional.

Connectives of the form &quot;x &quot;believes that&quot; ...&quot; are typical examples of connectives that are not truth-functional. If e.g. Mary mistakenly believes that Al Gore was President of the USA on April 20, 2000, but she does not believe that the moon is made of green cheese, then the sentence

:&quot;&quot;Mary believes that Al Gore was President of the USA on April 20, 2000&quot;

is true while

:&quot;Mary believes that the moon is made of green cheese&quot;

is false. In both cases, each component sentence (i.e. &quot;Al Gore was president of the USA on April 20, 2000&quot; and &quot;the moon is made of green cheese&quot;) is false, but each compound sentence formed by prefixing the phrase &quot;Mary believes that&quot; differs in truth-value. That is, the truth-value of a sentence of the form &quot;Mary believes that...&quot;&quot; is not determined solely by the truth-value of its component sentence, and hence the (unary) connective (or simply &quot;operator&quot; since it is unary) is non-truth-functional.

The class of classical logic connectives (e.g. &amp;, →) used in the construction of formulas is truth-functional. Their values for various truth-values as argument are usually given by truth tables. Truth-functional propositional calculus is a formal system whose formulae may be interpreted as either true or false.

== Table of binary truth functions ==

In two-valued logic, there are sixteen possible truth functions, also called Boolean functions, of two inputs &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;. Any of these functions corresponds to a truth table of a certain logical connective in classical logic, including several degenerate cases such as a function not depending on one or both of its arguments. Truth and falsehood are denoted as 1 and 0, respectively, in the following truth tables for sake of brevity.

== Functional completeness ==
Because a function may be expressed as a composition, a truth-functional logical calculus does not need to have dedicated symbols for all of the above-mentioned functions to be functionally complete. This is expressed in a propositional calculus as logical equivalence of certain compound statements. For example, classical logic has equivalent to . The conditional operator &quot;→&quot; is therefore not necessary for a classical-based logical system if &quot;¬&quot; (not) and &quot;∨&quot; (or) are already in use.

A minimal set of operators that can express every statement expressible in the propositional calculus is called a &quot;minimal functionally complete set&quot;. A minimally complete set of operators is achieved by NAND alone {↑} and NOR alone {↓}.

The following are the minimal functionally complete sets of operators whose arities do not exceed 2:
;One element: {↑}, {↓}.
;Two elements: formula_1, formula_2, formula_3, formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, formula_17, formula_18.
;Three elements: formula_19, formula_20, formula_21, formula_22, formula_23, formula_24.

== Algebraic properties ==
Some truth functions possess properties which may be expressed in the theorems containing the corresponding connective. Some of those properties that a binary truth function (or a corresponding logical connective) may have are:

*&quot;associativity&quot;: Within an expression containing two or more of the same associative connectives in a row, the order of the operations does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed.
*&quot;commutativity&quot;: The operands of the connective may be swapped without affecting the truth-value of the expression.
*&quot;distributivity&quot;: A connective denoted by · distributes over another connective denoted by +, if &quot;a&quot; · (&quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot;) = (&quot;a&quot; · &quot;b&quot;) + (&quot;a&quot; · &quot;c&quot;) for all operands &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;.
*&quot;idempotence&quot;: Whenever the operands of the operation are the same, the connective gives the operand as the result. In other words, the operation is both truth-preserving and falsehood-preserving (see below).
*&quot;absorption&quot;: A pair of connectives formula_25 satisfies the absorption law if formula_26 for all operands &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;.

A set of truth functions is functionally complete if and only if for each of the following five properties it contains at least one member lacking it:
*&quot;monotonic&quot;: If &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;) ≤ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;1, ..., &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;) for all &quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;b&quot;1, ..., &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; ∈ {0,1} such that &quot;a&quot;1 ≤ &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2 ≤ &quot;b&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;. E.g., formula_27.
*&quot;affine&quot;: For each variable, changing its value either always or never changes the truth-value of the operation, for all fixed values of all other variables. E.g., formula_28, formula_29.
*&quot;self dual&quot;: To read the truth-value assignments for the operation from top to bottom on its truth table is the same as taking the complement of reading it from bottom to top; in other words, &quot;f&quot;(¬&quot;a&quot;1, ..., ¬&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = ¬&quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;). E.g., formula_30.
*&quot;truth-preserving&quot;: The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of &quot;true&quot; produces a truth value of &quot;true&quot; as a result of these operations. E.g., formula_31. (see validity)
*&quot;falsehood-preserving&quot;: The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of &quot;false&quot; produces a truth value of &quot;false&quot; as a result of these operations. E.g., formula_32. (see validity)

=== Arity ===
A concrete function may be also referred to as an &quot;operator&quot;. In two-valued logic there are 2 nullary operators (constants), 4 unary operators, 16 binary operators, 256 ternary operators, and formula_33 &quot;n&quot;-ary operators. In three-valued logic there are 3 nullary operators (constants), 27 unary operators, 19683 binary operators, 7625597484987 ternary operators, and formula_34 &quot;n&quot;-ary operators. In &quot;k&quot;-valued logic, there are &quot;k&quot; nullary operators, formula_35 unary operators, formula_36 binary operators, formula_37 ternary operators, and formula_38 &quot;n&quot;-ary operators. An &quot;n&quot;-ary operator in &quot;k&quot;-valued logic is a function from formula_39. Therefore, the number of such operators is formula_40, which is how the above numbers were derived.

However, some of the operators of a particular arity are actually degenerate forms that perform a lower-arity operation on some of the inputs and ignore the rest of the inputs. Out of the 256 ternary Boolean operators cited above, formula_41 of them are such degenerate forms of binary or lower-arity operators, using the inclusion–exclusion principle. The ternary operator formula_42 is one such operator which is actually a unary operator applied to one input, and ignoring the other two inputs.

&quot;Not&quot; is a unary operator, it takes a single term (¬&quot;P&quot;). The rest are binary operators, taking two terms to make a compound statement ().

The set of logical operators may be partitioned into disjoint subsets as follows:

::: formula_43

In this partition, formula_44 is the set of operator symbols of &quot;arity&quot; .

In the more familiar propositional calculi, formula_45 is typically partitioned as follows:

:::nullary operators: formula_46

:::unary operators: formula_47

:::binary operators: formula_48

== Principle of compositionality ==

Instead of using truth tables, logical connective symbols can be interpreted by means of an interpretation function and a functionally complete set of truth-functions (Gamut 1991), as detailed by the principle of compositionality of meaning.
Let be an interpretation function, let be any two sentences and let the truth function &quot;f&quot;nand be defined as:
* &quot;f&quot;nand(T,T) = F; &quot;f&quot;nand(T,F) = &quot;f&quot;nand(F,T) = &quot;f&quot;nand(F,F) = T

Then, for convenience, &quot;f&quot;not, &quot;f&quot;or &quot;f&quot;and and so on are defined by means of &quot;f&quot;nand:

* &quot;f&quot;not(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;nand(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;x&quot;)
* &quot;f&quot;or(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;nand(&quot;f&quot;not(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;f&quot;not(&quot;y&quot;))
* &quot;f&quot;and(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;not(&quot;f&quot;nand(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;))

or, alternatively &quot;f&quot;not, &quot;f&quot;or &quot;f&quot;and and so on are defined directly:

* &quot;f&quot;not(T) = F; &quot;f&quot;not(F) = T;
* &quot;f&quot;or(T,T) = &quot;f&quot;or(T,F) = &quot;f&quot;or(F,T) = T; &quot;f&quot;or(F,F) = F
* &quot;f&quot;and(T,T) = T; &quot;f&quot;and(T,F) = &quot;f&quot;and(F,T) = &quot;f&quot;and(F,F) = F

Then

etc.

Thus if &quot;S&quot; is a sentence that is a string of symbols consisting of logical symbols &quot;v&quot;1...&quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot; representing logical connectives, and non-logical symbols &quot;c&quot;1...&quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot;, then if and only if have been provided interpreting &quot;v&quot;1 to &quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot; by means of &quot;f&quot;nand (or any other set of functional complete truth-functions) then the truth-value of is determined entirely by the truth-values of &quot;c&quot;1...&quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot;, i.e. of . In other words, as expected and required, &quot;S&quot; is true or false only under an interpretation of all its non-logical symbols.

== Formal definition ==

Using the functions defined above, we can give a formal definition of a proposition&#x27;s truth function.

Let &quot;PROP&quot; be the set of all propositional variables, 

: formula_49

We define a truth assignment to be any function formula_50. A truth assignment is therefore an association of each propositional variable with a particular truth value. This is effectively the same as a particular row of a proposition&#x27;s truth table.

For a truth assignment, formula_51, we define its extended truth assignment, formula_52, as follows. This extends formula_51 to a new function formula_54 which has domain equal to the set of all propositional formulas. The range of formula_52 is still formula_56.

# If formula_57 then formula_58.
# If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are any propositional formulas, then 
## formula_59.
## formula_60.
## formula_61.
## formula_62.
## formula_63.

Finally, now that we have defined the extended truth assignment, we can use this to define the truth-function of a proposition. For a proposition, &quot;A&quot;, its truth function, formula_64, has domain equal to the set of all truth assignments, and range equal to formula_56. 

It is defined, for each truth assignment formula_51, by formula_67. The value given by formula_68 is the same as the one displayed in the final column of the truth table of &quot;A&quot;, on the row identified with formula_51.

== Computer science ==
Logical operators are implemented as logic gates in digital circuits. Practically all digital circuits (the major exception is DRAM) are built up from NAND, NOR, NOT, and transmission gates. NAND and NOR gates with 3 or more inputs rather than the usual 2 inputs are fairly common, although they are logically equivalent to a cascade of 2-input gates. All other operators are implemented by breaking them down into a logically equivalent combination of 2 or more of the above logic gates.

The &quot;logical equivalence&quot; of &quot;NAND alone&quot;, &quot;NOR alone&quot;, and &quot;NOT and AND&quot; is similar to Turing equivalence.

The fact that all truth functions can be expressed with NOR alone is demonstrated by the Apollo guidance computer.

<text>Darrel Lee Chaney (born March 9, 1948) is an American former professional baseball player and television sports color commentator. He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop from 1969 to 1979, most notably as a member of the Cincinnati Reds dynasty that won three National League pennants and a World Series championship between 1970 and 1975. He finished his playing career with the Atlanta Braves then served with the Braves as a television announcer along with Ernie Johnson, Skip Caray and Pete Van Wieren. He was on the Atlanta Braves Radio Network as well as WTBS-TV.

==Baseball career==
Chaney was born in Hammond, Indiana and graduated of Oliver P. Morton High School, where he was a three-sport athlete and named 1st Team All-American Quarterback football player by Parade Magazine and was named the &quot;Northwest Indiana Times&quot; Athlete of the Year in 1966. His wife Cindy is also from Hammond and is a graduate of George Rogers Clark High School.

He had several football scholarship offers from Big Ten schools but signed with Ball State University because there he could play both football and baseball. However, he was selected by the Reds in the second round of the 1966 draft and signed for a $6,000 bonus.

Chaney served during the Vietnam War in the 478th Engineer Battalion of the U.S. Army based at Fort Thomas, Kentucky. His unit included several of his teammates including Johnny Bench, Pete Rose and Bobby Tolan.

Although a light-hitting infielder in the minor leagues, he broke through and led the Southern League with 23 home runs in 1968, earning him a spot on the Reds&#x27; roster in , when he shared the shortstop position with Woody Woodward and Chico Ruiz. Chaney continued with the Reds in the 1970s but after the emergence of Dave Concepción was primarily a reserve.

He played in three World Series for the Reds&#x27; &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; teams, in 1970 and 1972 and on the World Series-winning team of 1975.

Chaney&#x27;s trade to Atlanta for Mike Lum on December 12, 1975 was a reunion with Dave Bristol, his first major-league manager with the Reds. In 1976 he batted .252 with one home run and 50 RBI as the Braves&#x27; regular shortstop. Over the next three seasons, however, he was relegated to utility player and was released at the end of the 1979 season.

In 915 career games, Chaney hit for a .217 batting average, with 14 home runs, 190 runs batted in, 237 runs scored, 458 hits, 75 doubles, 17 triples and 19 stolen bases.

In 1980, Chaney played professional softball in 1980 with the Cincinnati Suds of the American Professional Slo-Pitch League (APSPL).

Chaney is a past Chairman of the Board of the Major League Alumni Marketing (MLAM) and a Founder of Prime Retail Services, a North American Retail Construction Company V He is a Christian and a motivational speaker; Dan Hettinger has written a biography of Chaney entitled &quot;Welcome to the Big Leagues . . . Every Man&#x27;s Journey to Significance&quot;. He lives in Hoschton, Georgia with his wife Cindy.

Darrel&#x27;s son, Keith, played 2 years in the Braves Minor League System. Keith&#x27;s son, Chase, is currently a pitcher in the California Angels Organization.

<text>The PZL P.11 is a Polish fighter aircraft, designed and produced in the early 1930s by Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze. Possessing an all-metal structure, metal-covering, and high-mounted gull wing, the type held the distinction of being widely considered the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world at the time of its introduction into service.

Work on the PZL P.11 began in the 1930, based on experience with previous aircraft from the family of fighters derived from the PZL P.1. The primary individual responsible for their development was Polish aeronautical engineer Zygmunt Puławski, who has been attributed as having designed many of their innovative features. While most of the world&#x27;s air forces still operated biplanes in the early 1930s, the P.11, like previous aircraft in the Puławski family, used a high-mounted and aerodynamically clean gull wing that produced less drag and provided the pilot with a superior field of view. In August 1931, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight. The design quickly drew international attention; the general layout became commonly known as the &quot;Polish wing&quot; or &quot;Puławski wing&quot;.

The PZL P.11 served as the basic fighter of the Polish Military Aviation in the second half of the 1930s, including during the German-Soviet invasion of Poland. However, as a consequence of the rapid advances in aircraft development during the late 1930s (seen in such fighters as the Messerschmitt Bf 109), it was outclassed by its rivals at the onset of the war. A significant number of Polish P.11s were destroyed on the ground in the first days of the Second World War; however, many fighter squadrons took up an unequal fight, achieving some successes. It is estimated that as many as 36 P.11s were evacuated to Romania and were subsequently taken over by the Royal Romanian Air Force.

In the early 1930s, the PZL P.11 won a contract for a new fighter aircraft for the Royal Romanian Air Force. During October 1933, deliveries of Polish-built P.11b to Romania commenced. From 1936, Romanian aircraft manufacturer Industria Aeronautică Română (IAR) license-built a further 95 aircraft under the designation IAR P.11f, powered by the Romanian-built IAR 9Krse engines. A more advanced development of the PZL P.11, which achieved much greater export success, was the PZL P.24. In the mid-1930s, several countries expressed their willingness to purchase the PZL P.11, of which Turkey, Bulgaria and Greece decided to acquire the new PZL P.24 instead.

==Development==
===Origins===
The history of the PZL P.11 started in 1929, when Polish aeronautical engineer Zygmunt Puławski began work on the design of an all-metal, monoplane fighter aircraft. Before this, the Polish aviation industry had concentrated on the licensed production of foreign-designed aircraft, particularly French; these typically had wooden structures, so Puławski&#x27;s all-metal approach represented a considerable advance for Polish industry.

The initial design produced by Puławski, designated the P.1, had many of the features of contemporary French aircraft of the era; these similarities can be attributed to Puławski himself, who had received a considerable portion of his technical education in France only a few years before. Nevertheless, the P.1 also had a number of original features, including its characteristic monoplane wing design. While the majority of the world&#x27;s forces were still using biplanes, the P.1 had a high-mounted and aerodynamically clean gull wing, which provided the pilot with a superior field of view.

During September 1929, the first prototype made its maiden flight. It demonstrated its outstanding performance compared to contemporary aircraft, such as the British Bristol Bulldog and the French Dewoitine D.27, when it achieved first place at an international air competition held in Bucharest, Romania. The design generated interest around the world; attention was such that the general layout became commonly known as the &quot;Polish wing&quot; or &quot;Puławski wing&quot;. This wing had a two-spar duralumin structure, with rivetted ribs to both the spars and skin; the exterior of the wing was covered by finely corrugated duralumin sheet, while the slotted ailerons had a fabric covering.

The Polish War Ministry objected to the aircraft&#x27;s use of the licence-built Hispano-Suiza engine, citing insufficient practicality and poor economic grounds. Accordingly, a second prototype, which was designated as the P.6, was completed the next year. This revision featured several deviations from Puławski&#x27;s original vision, including the adoption of a radial engine to power the type in place of the original in-line counterpart; during testing, the P.6&#x27;s engine was plagued by overheating issues.

===Refinement and production===
Following the disappointing performance of the P.6, a further improved design, designated as the PZL P.7, was developed. According to Liss, this revision represented the most significant of the P.11&#x27;s forerunners. The P.7 was placed into series production, having been ordered for the Polish Air Force, who ultimately opted to procure 150 of the type.

After designing the P.7, Puławski started further variants with larger engines, eventually cumulating in the P.11. During August 1931, the first P.11/I prototype conducted its maiden flight, powered by the British Bristol Jupiter radial engine; the first flight had occurred shortly after Puławski&#x27;s death in an air crash. It was followed by a pair of refined prototypes, the P.11/II and the P.11/III, which used the Bristol Mercury engine instead. They were later joined by several more pre-production aircraft to test out various configurations of engines, propellers, and other features; these test examples led to the P.11/VI, a production-representative version of the design.

The first variant of the P.11 to be ordered by the Polish Air Force was the P.11a. From the onset, this was considered to be only an interim model of the type; accordingly, a series of 50 such fighters were constructed. Otherwise similar to the P.7, the P.11a mounted the 575 hp (429 kW) Bristol Mercury IV S2 radial engine, which was produced in Poland under licence. Upon the completion of the P.11a order, PZL immediately set about establishing the production of an improved model of the aircraft, which was designated as the P.11c.

The P.11c would be the principal (and final) variant of the type to be inducted into the Polish Air Force. First reaching fighter squadrons during late 1935, it featured the adoption of a new, refined fuselage, a major change of which being the relocation of the engine to be 13 cm lower down in the aircraft&#x27;s nose, which had the advantage of providing the pilot with an improved exterior view. Besides, a new stronger engine Mercury V S2 had smaller diameter. Forward framework was longer, covering an enlarged and more comfortable cockpit, with pilot&#x27;s seat moved 30 cm rearwards and raised by 5 cm. The central part of the wings was also modified. During 1934, production of the P.11c commenced, by 1936, the type was being produced at a rate of 25 fighters per month; in total, 150 aircraft were produced by the end of production in 1936 (older sources quoted a number of 175, which is not confirmed in any documents). The first series of approximately 50 P.11c aircraft were fitted with Mercury V S2 of 600 hp (447 kW), the rest with Mercury VI S2 of 630 hp (470 kW).

Apart from Poland, Romania showed interest in the new design. Even before the P.11a entered service with the Polish Air Force, 50 aircraft, designated as the P.11b, were ordered for the Romanian Air Force, while an agreement for licence production was agreed. Deliveries of Polish-built P.11bs to Romania commenced in July 1934. They were fitted with Gnome-Rhone 9Krsd &quot;Mistral&quot; engines, otherwise they were similar to the P.11a. 49 were finally made, the 50th aircraft being P.11f prototype. After the P.11c had been developed, the Romanians decided to switch the licence production to the new model. As a result, from 1936 IAR built 95 aircraft as the IAR P.11f, powered by the Romanian-built IAR 9Krse engine, which was a licensed version of the Gnome-Rhone 9Krse giving . The Romanians then produced another Polish fighter, the PZL P.24, developed from the P.11 exclusively for export. Greece, Portugal, Yugoslavia, Turkey and Republican Spain were interested in buying the P.11, but finally Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey bought the P.24 instead.

===Further development and successors===
During 1934, the year in which the P.11 entered operational service, it was a contemporary of the British Gloster Gauntlet and German Heinkel He 51 and was arguably the most advanced fighter then in service in the world. However, due to a series of rapid advances and technological development in the field of aviation, the P.11 was considered to have been rendered obsolete by 1939. It had been overtaken in terms of performance by a new generation of fighter aircraft that commonly benefitted from features such as cantilever wings and retractable landing gear; such fighters included the British Supermarine Spitfire and German Messerschmitt Bf 109.

Together with the older P.7, both remained the only Polish fighters in service, however, with about 185 P.11s available, distributed within six air regiments and the aviation school in Dęblin. Being aware that the P.11 was now outdated, the Polish Air Force had pinned their hopes on the in-development PZL.50 Jastrząb, which suffered from several delays. When it became apparent that the PZL.50 would not be in widespread service in time for a major conflict that was clearly looming, consideration was given to producing an updated version of the P.11; this was to have been powered by the 840 hp (626 kW) Mercury VIII and have been furnished with an enclosed cockpit, known as the P.11g Kobuz (&quot;hobby&quot;). Only the prototype of the P.11g with a maximum speed increase to a still-slow 390 km/h (~240 mph) was flown before the war, in August 1939.

In light of the unavailability of PZL.50, the only hope of replacing the obsolete P.11 lay in acquiring modern fighters from abroad. In 1939, after receiving the necessary credits, Poland ordered from France 120 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, and from Britain, 14 Hawker Hurricane Is (the P.11&#x27;s chosen replacement), plus a single Supermarine Spitfire I for testing, in addition to 100 Fairey Battle light bombers. However, none of these aircraft were delivered to Poland before September 1939.

==Design==
The PZL P.11 was an innovative fighter aircraft for the early 1930s, with a high-mounted gull wing and an all-metal, metal-covered structure. It also had several relatively conventional features for the era, such as a fixed undercarriage. The P.11 was equipped with a pair of 7.92 mm machine guns mounted on the sides of the fuselage; reportedly, around a third of all P.11c-model fighters were fitted with two additional machine guns fixed onto the wings. The fuselage-mounted guns were synchronised, but all others were not; a gun camera could also be installed.The P.11c could carry up to four small 12.5 kg bombs, while the earlier P.11a model was not equipped to carry any.

The P.11 was powered by a number of different radial engines: these included the Bristol Mercury IV S2 (normal: , maximum: 575 hp) of the P.11a, the Gnome-Rhone 9Krsd (550 hp, max: 595 hp) of the P.11b, the Bristol Mercury V S2 (565 hp, max: 600 hp) or alternatively the Mercury VI S2 (590 hp, max: 630 hp) of the P.11c: and finally the Gnome-Rhone 9Krse (560 hp, max: 610 hp) of the P.11f, the ultimate version of the aircraft. Regardless of the engine used, the unit was mounted upon rubber vibration absorbers inside a forward-mounted engine bay and drove a wooden two-bladed fixed-pitch propeller manufactured by Polish company Szomanski.

The P.11 had an open cockpit, with a Plexiglas windshield. Instrumentation included navigation and engine gauges; while many of these components originated within Poland, one notable exception was the German-built compass. The safety equipment included an arrangement of several flame dampers, a flare gun, and oxygen tanks for the pilot. Only a few P.11s were equipped with radio sets, leading to pilots typically being reliant upon hand signals and pre-arranged manoeuvres to communicate with one another.

The all-metal fuselage of the P.11 was matched to the twin-spar shoulder-mounted wing via bearers mounted on the upper portion of the first and second fuselage frames. The wing and the tail used similar construction techniques, making use of Daude-type rivets, a corrugated duralumin sheet exterior and solid duralumin struts and plates for strengthening. The undercarriage had V-shape streamlined struts, furnished with Avia-type oleo pneumatic shock absorbers (including the tail skid) and were braced with steel wire.

The P.11 had an internal fuel tank inside the fuselage which could be jettisoned in case of fire or other emergency. A high-profile flaw was present in the construction of early examples in the form of its fuel tanks. Originally manufactured by an independent sub-contractor, the tanks were rivetted and covered with a resin sealing agent; however, this technique resulted in joints that rapidly degraded in the presence of vibration. An initial effort to switch to welded joints was catastrophic, having been determined to have been responsible for failures early on in the P.11&#x27;s service life. Following a decision by some customers to refuse acceptance of completed aircraft using this type of joint due to these failures, extensive testing to evaluate alternative techniques was conducted by PZL, resulting in the problem being entirely eliminated.

==Operational history==

At the outbreak of the Second World War, on 1 September 1939, the Polish Air Force had 109 PZL P.11cs, 20 P.11as and 30 P.7as in combat units. A further 43 P.11c aircraft were in reserve or undergoing repairs. Only a third of P.11c were armed with four machine guns, the rest had only two, and even fewer had a radio. The P.11 were used in twelve escadrilles (&quot;eskadra&quot;), each with ten aircraft (two escadrilles constituted a squadron, in Polish: &quot;dywizjon&quot;). Two squadrons—four escadrilles—were in the Pursuit Brigade deployed around Warsaw, with the rest assigned to various armies. All of them took part in the 1939 defense of Poland. Apart from combat units, several P.11 aircraft, including a prototype P.11g, were used in improvised units at air bases.

By 1 September 1939, the fighter squadrons had been deployed to remote improvised airfields and were therefore protected from German air attack on the ground. The P.11 would be up against more modern German bombers and fighters—not only were the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 faster and better armed, but most German &quot;bombers&quot; were also faster. Since the P.11 fighters had seen years of intensive use before the war, their maximum speed was even lower than the theoretical 375 km/h. The P.11a&#x27;s were in even worse condition. In addition, their small total number meant that missions of groups larger than twenty aircraft were rarely undertaken, and reserve machines were almost non-existent.

On the other hand, the Polish fighter aircraft featured better maneuverability than their German counterparts and, as a benefit of their design, much better vision from the cockpit. The P.11 also had a durable construction and a good rate of climb, and could take off from short airfields, even of the rough and improvised variety. It could also dive at up to 600 km/h without risk of the wings breaking off. Theoretically the only limit in maneuvers was the pilot&#x27;s ability to sustain high &quot;g&quot; forces. Despite the German superiority, the P.11 managed to shoot down a considerable number of German aircraft, including fighters, but suffered heavy losses as well. The exact numbers are not fully verified. A total of 285 German aircraft were lost according to &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; records, with at least 110 victories credited to the P.11 for the loss of about 100 of their own. Some of the German aircraft shot down were later recovered and put back into service. This allowed German propaganda to claim smaller combat losses.

At dawn on 1 September, Capt. Mieczysław Medwecki flying a PZL P.11c was shot down by &quot;Rottenführer&quot; (Foreman Leader) &quot;Leutnant&quot; Frank Neubert of I./StG 2 (Stuka), having the dubious honour of becoming the first aircraft shot down in the Second World War. The first Allied air victory, the shooting down of a Junkers Ju 87, was achieved 20 minutes later by Medwecki&#x27;s wingman, Władysław Gnyś, who went on to shoot down a pair of Dornier Do 17s with his P.11c. The P.11c was also the first aircraft to successfully ram an enemy aircraft in the Second World War. The first large air battle of the war took place in the early morning of 1 September over the village of Nieporęt just north of Warsaw, when a German bomber group of about seventy Heinkel He 111 and Dornier Do 17 was intercepted by some twenty P.11 and ten P.7 fighters, and had to abandon their mission to Warsaw.
The following day, nine PZL P.11s of No. 142 Squadron, led by Captain Mirosław Leśniewski, intercepted two formations of Dornier Do 17 on river Vistula. Attacking head on, the Polish pilots managed to shoot down seven twin-engined bombers, two of them credited to Lieutenant Stanisław Skalski (future Distinguished Flying Cross &amp; Two Bars) for no losses to themselves.
Most of the P.11s were destroyed in 1939, though thirty-six were flown to Romania and taken over by the Romanian Air Force. Due to their obsolescence, these veteran aircraft were not used in combat; only a small number were used for training while the rest were dismantled for spare parts. It has been alleged that some aircraft were captured and saw limited use by the Germans. A pair of P.11s were captured by the Red Army and used for testing. One landed in Hungary (near the town of Hajdúböszörmény) and was used as a glider tow plane by the University of Technology in Budapest.

==Variants==
;P.11/I
:First prototype of the P.11 fighter, powered by a Gnome-Rhône Jupiter IX ASb.
;P.11/II
:Second prototype of the P.11 fighter, powered by a Bristol Mercury IV.A in a long chord cowling. Used for comparative tests of Letov Kbely, Bristol, Ratier, Szomański and Chauvière fixed pitch wooden propellers, achieving a best speed of at with the Chauvière.
;P.11/III
:Production prototype of the P.11 fighter, powered by a Bristol Mercury, with simplified structure to ease production.
;P.11a
:The initial version for the Lotnictwo Wojskowe (Polish Air Force), which ordered fifty, actually built after completion of the Romanian P.11b order, powered by – Polish Skoda Works Mercury IV.S2 engines.
;P.11b
:Fifty aircraft ordered by the Romanian Government, powered by Gnome-Rhône 9K Mistral or IAR 9K Mistral engines. 49 were actually built.
;P.11c
:The main production version for Lotnictwo Wojskowe. 150 built.
;P.11f
:95 aircraft, powered by IAR 9K Mistral engines, built as licence production by IAR in Romania.
;P.11g Kobuz
:Developed as a stop-gap to fill in for delayed PZL.50 Jastrząb fighters by strengthening the structure to absorb the power of a single Mercury VIII, with an enclosed cockpit and four improved km wz. 36 machine-guns. The converted P.11c prototype flew for the first time on 15 August 1939, less than a month before the German invasion, forcing abandonment of the programme.

<doc id="604716" wikidata="Q1164127" url="?curid=604716" title="RAF Coningsby">
<text>Royal Air Force Coningsby or RAF Coningsby , is a Royal Air Force (RAF) station located south-west of Horncastle, and north-west of Boston, in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. It is a Main Operating Base of the RAF and home to three front-line Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 units, No. 3 Squadron, No. 11 Squadron and No. 12 Squadron. In support of front-line units, No. 29 Squadron is the Typhoon Operational Conversion Unit and No. 41 Squadron is the Typhoon Test and Evaluation Squadron. Coningsby is also the home of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) which operates a variety of historic RAF aircraft.

==History==
===Second World War===
Plans for an airfield at Coningsby began in 1937 as part of the RAF&#x27;s expansion plan. However progress in the compulsory purchase of the land was slow and delayed the start of work for two years. The station opened during the Second World War on 4 November 1940 under No. 5 Group, part of RAF Bomber Command. The first flying unit, No. 106 Squadron with the Handley Page Hampden medium bomber, arrived in February 1941, with active operations taking place the following month when four Hampdens bombed Cologne in Germany. The squadron was joined in April 1941 by No. 97 Squadron equipped with Avro Manchester medium bombers. In May 1942, aircraft from Coningsby participated in the &#x27;Thousand Bomber&#x27; raid on Cologne.

The original grass runways were found to be unsuitable for heavy bomber operations so the station was closed for nearly a year between September 1942 and August 1943, whilst paved runways were laid in preparation for accommodating such aircraft. At the same time further hangars were constructed.

The first unit to return was the now-famous No. 617 &#x27;Dambusters&#x27; Squadron. Equipped with Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, the squadron was stationed at Coningsby from August 1943. Due to its specialist nature, the Dambusters carried out limited operations whilst at Coningsby, with the most notable being Operation Garlic, a failed raid targeting the Dortmund-Ems canal in Germany, when five out of the eight Lancasters on the mission failed to return home. As the squadron required more space, it moved to nearby RAF Woodhall Spa in January 1944, swapping places with another Lancaster unit, No. 619 Squadron, which itself later moved on to RAF Dunholme Lodge.

Further Lancaster squadrons were based at Coningsby during the final months of the war, including No. 61 Squadron from RAF Skellingthorpe, No. 83 Squadron and No. 97 Squadron.

===Post war===
Following the Second World War, Coningsby was home to the Mosquito-equipped No. 109 Squadron and No. 139 Squadron, then became part of No. 3 Group, with Boeing Washington aircraft from 1950. On 17 August 1953 52-year-old Air Vice-Marshal William Brook, the Air Officer Commanding of No. 3 Group, took off from the base in a Gloster Meteor, and crashed into a Dutch barn at Bradley, Staffordshire.

===Jet aircraft===
The airfield received its first jet aircraft—the English Electric Canberra—in 1953. During 1956, the station expanded with the runway being extended. Avro Vulcans arrived in 1962, then transferred to RAF Cottesmore in November 1964.

From 1964 to 1966, the station had been initially designated to receive the proposed RAF strike aircraft, the advanced BAC TSR-2, which was cancelled in April 1965 by the Labour Government. The TSR2 was planned to join No. 40 Squadron at Coningsby in 1968 to replace the Canberra.

===Phantoms===

The TSR2&#x27;s intended replacement—the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark—was shelved on 16 January 1968 when its costs overshot the UK&#x27;s budget (it would have cost £425m for 50 aircraft). The TSR2 had large development costs, whereas the F-111 (also known as Tactical Fighter Experimental, or TFX) could be bought off the shelf. Coningsby was planned to get the F-111K, the RAF version of the F-111; also in the 1966 Defence White Paper, it was intended that the Anglo-French AFVG, later the UKVG, would replace the TSR2 (it did eventually as the Panavia Tornado). 50 F-111Ks were planned with 100 AFVGs (to enter service by 1970); Denis Healey claimed the F-111s and AFVGs would be cheaper than the TSR2 programme (158 aircraft) by £700m. As Minister of Aviation throughout 1965, the Labour MP Roy Jenkins had also wanted to similarly cancel the Olympus-powered Concorde, but the 1962 Anglo-French treaty imposed prohibitively steep financial penalties for cancellation; the Hawker Siddeley P.1154 and HS.681 were cancelled at the same time.

AFVGs were also planned to replace the Buccaneer in the Royal Navy—Tornados were never flown by the Royal Navy, as the carriers for them, the CVA-01s, were cancelled. But the Royal Navy did operate fourteen Phantoms on HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, until the new smaller carriers entered service—48 Phantoms had been designated for the Fleet Air Arm, with twenty of these ending up at RAF Leuchars, and &quot;Ark Royal&#x27;s&quot; Phantoms ended up at Leuchars in 1978. HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; was never converted to Phantom use as it was deemed too expensive, and the carrier was scrapped in January 1972, with its Sea Vixen aircraft. Another alternative considered by the Labour government in July 1965 for the TSR-2 was to order Rolls-Royce Spey-engined French Mirage IV aircraft, to be known as the Mirage IVS; it would have avionics from the TSR-2, and be partly made by BAC at Warton.
Spey-engined Phantoms (the plane the government eventually bought, having been ordered in February 1964 for the Fleet Air Arm, instead of the P.1154) were chosen in 1966 for the station&#x27;s future as with the scrapping of aircraft carriers the Phantoms were not needed for the Fleet Air Arm, with all RAF Phantom training taking place on the airfield, and the station became part of Fighter Command until December 1967, when it joined Air Support Command as the Phantoms were initially in a ground attack role. Phantoms first saw operational service with the Fleet Air Arm in 1970. The first Phantom FGR2 (Fighter/Ground attack/Reconnaissance) arrived at Coningsby on 23 August 1968, with the first aircrew OCU course (No. 228 OCU) beginning in October 1968. Air-defence Phantoms (FG1) also entered service in 1969 at RAF Leuchars. On 18 May 1970, a Phantom flew from the base non-stop to RAF Tengah in Singapore, covering in 14 hours and 14 minutes at an average speed of . In April 1968, RAF Strike Command was formed and the airfield was transferred to No. 38 Group.

No. 41(F) Squadron joined in April 1972, and stayed until 1977. The other ground-attack Phantom squadrons (four of them) were at RAF Bruggen. No. 111(F) Squadron replaced their Lightnings (from RAF Wattisham) with Phantoms from 1 October 1974. On 1 January 1975, No. 29(F) Squadron joined and stayed until 1987, when disbanded. On 1 November 1975, No. 23(F) Squadron joined until February 1976, when moved to RAF Wattisham. In March 1976, No. 56(F) Squadron joined until July 1976, then went to Wattisham.
The Phantom&#x27;s role changed to air defence in October 1974 when the airfield transferred to No. 11 Group in Strike Command, when the SEPECAT Jaguar (situated in Norfolk) took over the ground attack role. No. 111(F) Squadron were the first to take the new air defence Phantoms. During 1975, the UK&#x27;s air defence transferred to the Phantom FGR.2 from five squadrons of English Electric Lightnings. The UK was covered by NATO Early Warning Area 12. Three Sector Operations Centres were at RAF Buchan, Boulmer and Neatishead; in the 1960s, the UK had the Linesman/Mediator radar system, which was obsolete by the 1970s. No. 29(F) Squadron formed with Phantoms at Coningsby on 1 January 1975; until then the Phantom FG.1 had been operating with the Royal Navy only. On 3 March 1975, a Phantom crashed into a nearby house, with both pilot and navigator ejecting. The Queen visited the station on 30 June 1976.

===Tornados===
Panavia Tornado F3 squadrons began to form from November 1984, namely No. 229 OCU/No. 65 Squadron. Tornado training took place until April 1987, when the Phantoms left (to RAF Leuchars) and Coningsby had the first (No. 29(F) Squadron) Tornado air defence squadron.

To accommodate these new aircraft, extensive hardened aircraft shelters (HAS) and support facilities were built. No. 5 Squadron arrived in January 1988, having previously operated the English Electric Lightning.

Exercise Priory took place in October 1985.

During the Gulf War, Tornados from Coningsby were based for three months at Dhahran International Airport to participate in Operation Granby. Tornado engines were serviced on the northern section of the former RAF Woodhall Spa, denoted as RAF Woodhall.

===Jaguars===

With the running down of RAF Coltishall in Norfolk, No. 6 Squadron relocated with their SEPECAT Jaguars to Coningsby on 1 April 2006, where it was planned they would operate from until October 2007. However, on 25 April 2007 it was announced by the Ministry of Defence that the Jaguars would be withdrawn from service on 30 April. May 2007 saw No. 6 Squadron flying their Jaguars to RAF Cosford where they would be utilised by No. 1 SoTT. No. 6 Squadron disbanded on 31 May 2007. Deliveries continued in June and July, with the last Jaguar to arrive at Cosford from Coningsby being &quot;XX119&quot; on 2 July 2007.

===Eurofighter Typhoon===
Coningsby was the first airfield to receive the Phantoms, the Tornado ADV and was the first to receive its replacement, the Eurofighter Typhoon. Typhoon arrived in May 2005 with No. 17 Squadron, after the RAF first publicly displayed the aircraft at Coningsby in December 2004. No. 3(F) Squadron moved to RAF Coningsby where it became the first operational front line RAF Typhoon squadron in July 2007 and No. 11(F) Squadron became operational at RAF Coningsby shortly thereafter.

No. 12 Squadron reactivated in July 2018 and is temporarily integrating Qatar Emiri Air Force air and ground crews in order to provide training and support as part of the Qatari purchase of twenty-four Typhoons from the UK.
In October 2019, RAF Coningsby signed a twinning agreement with Fighter Wing 73 () of the German Air Force () to enhance opportunities to meet and train with one another. The wing, based at Laage in north-eastern Germany, also operates the Eurofighter Typhoon.
== Role and operations ==
RAF Coningsby&#x27;s mission statement is &#x27;To develop the future, deliver the present and commemorate the past of the Royal Air Force&#x27;s combat air power.&#x27; The station is home to nearly 3,000 military personnel, civil servants, and contractors. BAE Systems Military Air Solutions, who produce the Typhoon, are also stationed on the airfield with the contract to maintain the aircraft.

=== Command ===
The station commander is Group Captain Billy Cooper. William, Prince of Wales served as the station&#x27;s Honorary Air Commandant from 2008 till 2023. His wife, Catherine, took over the role in August 2023. The station is under the command of No. 1 Group (Air Combat).

=== Typhoon operations ===

The Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 provides the RAF with a multi-role combat capability for air policing, peace support and high intensity conflict. RAF Coningsby is the home to three front-line Typhoon units, No. 3(F) Squadron and No. 11 Squadron as well as No. 12 Squadron which is a joint RAF/Qatar Emiri Air Force squadron. They are accompanied by No. 29 Squadron which is the Typhoon Operational Conversion Unit which trains new crews.

==== Quick Reaction Alert ====
Since June 2007, Coningsby&#x27;s Typhoons have been responsible for maintaining the Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) South mission (QRA(I)S). Aircraft and crews are held at a high state of readiness, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to respond to unidentified aircraft approaching UK airspace. QRA missions range from civilian airliners which have stopped responding to air traffic control, to intercepting Russian aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu-95 Bear and Tu-160 Blackjack.

==== Test and Evaluation ====
The fourth Typhoon unit is No. 41 (Test and Evaluation) Squadron which is part of the Air Warfare Centre. The squadron develops operational tactics and evaluates new avionics and weapons systems. Formerly the Fast Jet and Weapons Operational Evaluation Unit (FJWOEU), which was formed by merging the Strike Attack OEU (previously based at MOD Boscombe Down) and the Tornado F3 OEU (now returned back to its home base of RAF Coningsby after a temporary &#x27;lay-over&#x27; at RAF Waddington) and the Air-Guided Weapons OEU (previously based at RAF Valley).

===Battle of Britain Memorial Flight===

Coningsby has been home of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) and the associated visitor centre since March 1976 when it arrived from RAF Coltishall. The BBMF operate one of two remaining airworthy Avro Lancaster bombers in the world, alongside; six Spitfires of various types; two Hurricanes; a Dakota and two Chipmunks, the latter type being used for pilot training.

=== Force Protection ===
No. 7 Force Protection Wing Headquarters provides operational planning, command and control to two RAF Regiment field squadrons attached to the wing, No. 63 (Queen&#x27;s Colour) Squadron (based at RAF Northolt) and No. 2623 (East Anglian) Squadron (RAuxAF) (based at RAF Honington) whose purpose is to protect RAF bases at home and abroad from ground attack. Part of No. 4 RAF Police Squadron, under the command of No. 2 RAF Police &amp; Security Wing at RAF Waddington, is also based at the station and provides policing, security and guarding.

==== Air Land Integration (ALI) Cell ====
No. 7 Force Protection Wing includes the Air Land Integration (ALI) Cell, which provides a forward air control capability. The ALI Cell trains and provides Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACS) and Tactical Air Controller Parties (TACPS) to support RAF and joint operations. The ALI Cell moved to Coningsby from RAF Honington in Suffolk and came under the control off the wing in June 2018.

===Expeditionary Air Wing===
No. 121 Expeditionary Air Wing was formed at Coningsby on 1 April 2006 to create a deployable air force structure.

<text>Bulat Shalvovich Okudzhava (; ; ; May 9, 1924 – June 12, 1997) was a Soviet and Russian poet, writer, musician, novelist, and singer-songwriter of Georgian-Armenian ancestry. He was one of the founders of the Soviet genre called &quot;author song&quot; (&quot;авторская песня&quot;, &quot;avtorskaya pesnya&quot;), or &quot;guitar song&quot;, and the author of about 200 songs, set to his own poetry. His songs are a mixture of Russian poetic and folk song traditions and the French &quot;chansonnier&quot; style represented by such contemporaries of Okudzhava as Georges Brassens. Though his songs were never overtly political, the freshness and independence of Okudzhava&#x27;s artistic voice presented a subtle challenge to Soviet cultural authorities, who were thus hesitant for many years to give him official recognition.

==Life==
Bulat Okudzhava was born in Moscow on May 9, 1924, into a family of communists who had come from Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, to study and to work for the Communist Party. The son of a Georgian father, , and an Armenian mother, Ashkhen Nalbandyan, Bulat Okudzhava spoke and wrote only in Russian.

Okudzhava&#x27;s mother was the niece of a well-known Armenian poet, Vahan Terian. His father served as a political commissar during the Civil War and as a high-ranking Communist Party member thereafter, under the protection of Sergo Ordzhonikidze (1886-1937). His uncle Vladimir Okudzhava was an anarchist and terrorist who left the Russian Empire after a failed attempt to assassinate the Kutaisi governor. Vladimir was listed among the passengers of the infamous sealed train that delivered Vladimir Lenin, Grigory Zinoviev and other revolutionary leaders from Switzerland to Russia in 1917.

===Terror and war===

Shalva, Okudzhava&#x27;s father, was arrested in February 1937 during the Great Purge, accused of Trotskyism and wrecking. He was shot on 4 August, along with his two brothers. His wife was arrested in 1939 &quot;for anti-Soviet deeds&quot; and sent to the Gulag. Bulat returned to Tbilisi to live with his relatives. His mother was released in 1946, but arrested for the second time in 1949, spending another 5 years in labor camps. She was fully released in 1954 and rehabilitated in 1956, along with her husband.

In 1942, at the age of 17, 9th-grader Bulat Okudzhava volunteered for the Red Army infantry, and from 1942 he participated in the war against Nazi Germany. After his discharge from the service in 1944, he returned to Tbilisi where he passed his high school graduation exams and enrolled at Tbilisi State University, graduating in 1950. After graduating, he worked as a teacher, first in a rural school in the village of Shamordino in the Kaluga Region, and later in the city of Kaluga itself.

===Return to Moscow===

In 1956, three years after the death of Joseph Stalin, Okudzhava returned to Moscow. Following his parents&#x27; rehabilitation and the 20th Party Congress at which Khrushchev denounced Stalin, Bulat Okudzhava was able to join the Communist Party, of which he remained a member until 1990. In the Soviet capital he worked first as an editor in the publishing house Molodaya Gvardiya (Young Guard), and later as the head of the poetry division at the most prominent national literary weekly in the former USSR, Literaturnaya Gazeta (&quot;Literary Newspaper&quot;). It was then, in the middle of the 1950s, that he began to compose songs and to perform them, accompanying himself on a Russian guitar.

Soon he was giving concerts. He only employed a few chords and had no formal training in music, but he possessed an exceptional melodic gift, and the intelligent lyrics of his songs blended perfectly with his music and his voice. His songs were praised by his friends, and amateur recordings were made. These unofficial recordings were widely copied as magnitizdat, and spread across the USSR and Poland, where other young people picked up guitars and started singing the songs for themselves. In 1970, his lyrics appeared in the classic Soviet film &quot;White Sun of the Desert&quot;.
===Songwriter, poet and novelist===

Though Okudzhava&#x27;s songs were not published by any official media organization until the late 1970s, they quickly achieved enormous popularity, especially among the intelligentsia – mainly in the USSR at first, but soon among Russian-speakers in other countries as well. Vladimir Nabokov, for example, cited his &quot;Sentimental March&quot; in the novel &quot;Ada or Ardor&quot;.
Okudzhava, however, regarded himself primarily as a poet and claimed that his musical recordings were insignificant. During the 1980s, he also published a great deal of prose (his novel &quot;The Show is Over&quot; won him the Russian Booker Prize in 1994). By the 1980s, recordings of Okudzhava performing his songs finally began to be officially released in the Soviet Union, and many volumes of his poetry were also published. In 1991, he was awarded the USSR State Prize. He supported the reform movement in the USSR and in October 1993, signed the Letter of Forty-Two.

Okudzhava died in Paris on June 12, 1997, and is buried in the Vagankovo Cemetery in Moscow. A monument marks the building at 43 Arbat Street where he lived. His dacha in Peredelkino is now a museum that is open to the public.

A minor planet, 3149 Okudzhava, discovered by Czech astronomer Zdeňka Vávrová in 1981 is named after him. His songs remain very popular and frequently performed.

==Music==
Okudzhava, like most bards, did not come from a musical background. He learned basic guitar skills with the help of some friends. He also knew how to play basic chords on a piano.

Okudzhava tuned his Russian guitar to the &quot;Russian tuning&quot; of D&#x27;-G&#x27;-C-D-g-b-d&#x27; (thickest to thinnest string), and often lowered it by one or two tones to better accommodate his voice. He played in a classical manner, usually finger picking the strings in an ascending/descending arpeggio or waltz pattern, with an alternating bass line picked by the thumb.

Initially Okudzhava was taught three basic chords, and towards the end of his life he claimed to know a total of seven.

Many of Okudzhava&#x27;s songs are in the key of C minor (with downtuning B flat or A minor), centering on the C minor chord (X00X011, thickest to thinnest string), then progressing to a G 7 (00X0433), then either an E-flat minor (X55X566) or C major (55X5555). In addition to the aforementioned chords, the E-flat major chord (X55X567) was often featured in songs in a major key, usually C major (with downtuning B-flat or A major).

By the nineties, Okudzhava adopted the increasingly popular six string guitar but retained the Russian tuning, subtracting the fourth string, which was convenient to his style of playing.
