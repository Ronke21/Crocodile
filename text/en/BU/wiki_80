<text>Benbow State Recreation Area is a state park unit of the state of California in the United States. It is located in Humboldt County south of Garberville on U.S. Route 101 on the South Fork Eel River.
Benbow dam was constructed across the South Fork Eel River in 1931 to provide hydroelectric power for development in Garberville, impounding a reservoir. The Benbow family, interested in preserving the natural scene along the river, made efforts to place the land under state protection. In 1956 funds were approved for the Benbow Project and the first were purchased in 1958. Due to the negative impact on the migrating salmon and damage to the river banks, work began to remove the dam in August 2016. In the winter of 2017, removal of the dam was completed.

The park has grown to . There are campsites and a large day-use picnic area. Hiking, picnicking and camping are popular summer time activities, while salmon and steelhead fishing are popular in the winter.

<text>Killing Pablo: The Hunt for the World&#x27;s Greatest Outlaw (2001) is a book by Mark Bowden that details the efforts by the governments of the United States and Colombia, their respective military and intelligence forces, and Los Pepes to stop illegal activities committed by Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar and his subordinates. It relates how Escobar was killed and his cartel dismantled. Bowden originally reported this story in a 31-part series published in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; and in a companion documentary of the same title.

==Documentary==
&quot;The True Story of Killing Pablo&quot; (2002) is a companion documentary film to Bowden&#x27;s 2001 book. It was produced by Wild Eyes Productions for The History Channel.

== Film ==
A feature film adaptation was being developed by producers Bob Yari and Mark Gordon, to be directed and written by Joe Carnahan, but the film&#x27;s producer, Yari, filed for bankruptcy in 2008. As of 2019, a film has yet to be produced.

== Appearances in pop culture ==
The book is featured in the eighth episode of the third season of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, when Walt Jr. shows it to his fatherthe camera zooms in on the book&#x27;s coverand describes it as an account of how Pablo Escobar was tracked down and killed by DEA agents like his Uncle Hank. In addition to Escobar, the series features the two DEA agents, Steve Murphy and Javier Peña, whom Bowden revealed to have been at the center of the hunt. It indirectly surfaces in the HBO series &quot;Entourage&quot;, when the actor at the center of that show, Vincent Chase, agrees to play Escobar in a film called &quot;Medellin&quot; despite being utterly unsuited to the role.

<text>Benicia State Recreation Area is a state park unit of California, United States, protecting tidal wetland. It is located in the Solano County city of Benicia, west of downtown Benicia and borders Vallejo&#x27;s Glen Cove neighborhood. The park covers of marsh, grassy hillsides and rocky beaches along the narrowest portion of the Carquinez Strait. Southampton Creek and the tidal marsh front Southampton Bay, where the combined waters of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers approach San Pablo Bay, the northern portion of San Francisco Bay.

==History==
Don José de Cañizares — diarist on the 1769 overland Portola expedition and who sailed with Don Juan Manuel de Ayala on the &quot;San Carlos&quot;, the first ship to enter San Francisco Bay on August 5, 1775 — named the cove north and west of Benicia Puerto de las Asunta (&quot;Assumption Harbor&quot; in Spanish) because he discovered it on that feast day in 1775. The cove is noted as &quot;J&quot; on Cañizares&#x27; famous 1781 Map of San Francisco Bay. The present name, Southampton Bay, is for the Navy frigate &quot;Southampton&quot;, which Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones sailed, along with a small fleet, to the cove in 1849.

==Habitat and wildlife==

The Southampton Bay Wetland Natural Preserve makes up 70% of the park. The Southampton mudflat formed eroded upriver silt and clay deposits exceeds thick. The principal habitats here are brackish marsh, saltwater marsh and freshwater marsh. This rare and endangered wetland ecosystem is covered with marsh plants such as salt grass (&quot;Distichlis spicata&quot;), pickleweed (&quot;Batis maritima&quot;), coyote bush (&quot;Baccharis pilularis&quot;) and soft bird&#x27;s-beak (&quot;Cordylanthus mollis&quot;). Bird’s-beak is an endangered gray-green annual herb in the snapdragon family.

Park mammals include the federally endangered northern salt marsh harvest mice (&quot;Reithrodontomys raviventris halicoetes&quot;). Other mammals living in the park are coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), river otter (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;), muskrat (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;) and California golden beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis subauratus&quot;). The beaver probably migrated from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in 2007. Historically, before the California Fur Rush of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the Delta probably held the largest concentration of beaver in North America. It was California&#x27;s early fur trade, more than any other single factor, that opened up the West, and the San Francisco Bay Area in particular, to world trade. In 1840, explorer Captain Thomas Farnham wrote that &quot;There is probably no spot of equal extent in the whole continent of America which contains so many of these muchsought animals.&quot;

Benicia SRA has been designated an Important Bird Area, providing habitat for endangered California clapper rails (&quot;Rallus longirostris obsoletus&quot;) and black rails (&quot;Laterallus jamaicensis&quot;). Other uncommon species include Virginia rails (&quot;Rallus limicola&quot;), Suisun song sparrows (&quot;Melospiza melodia maxillaris&quot;) and salt marsh common yellowthroat (&quot;Geothlypis trichas sinuosa&quot;). On their journey along the Pacific Flyway, many waterfowl winter in the park.

==Recreation==
Cyclists, runners, walkers and roller skaters enjoy the park&#x27;s 2.5 miles (4 km) of road and bike paths. The Hike and Bike Trail—two parallel, paved, accessible trails—begins
at the Military West entrance and runs 0.75 miles to the main park entrance, joining Dillon Point Road for 1.5 miles. The trail system is part of the Bay Area Ridge Trail and San Francisco Bay Trail. Most popular is the 1.5-mile-long walk out to Dillon Point on the park road. Picnicking is available at the group picnic area, one mile into the park. The Forrest Deaner Native Plants Botanic Garden is located at the end of the picnic area, offering displays of and information about plants native to the Bay Area. From the top of Dillon Point, you can trace the route of the Carquinez Strait Scenic Loop Trail, a 50-mile route that will, when finished, ring the strait.

Dillon&#x27;s Point offers prime shore fishing for white sturgeon (&quot;Acipenser transmontanus&quot;), starry flounder (&quot;Platichthys stellatus&quot;) and striped bass (&quot;Morone saxatilis&quot;).

<doc id="605072" wikidata="Q1109932" url="?curid=605072" title="Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)">
<text>Green Gables Heritage Place is a 19th century farm and literary landmark in Cavendish, Prince Edward Island, Canada. Green Gables served as the setting for the &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; novels by Lucy Maud Montgomery. Green Gables is recognized as a Federal Historic Building by the government of Canada and is situated on the L.M. Montgomery&#x27;s Cavendish National Historic Site of Canada. The National Historic Site itself is situated in Prince Edward Island National Park.

The building was initially erected during the 1830s, by the MacNeil family, relatives of Montgomery, who was born near the homestead. Interest in the Green Gables property grew in the decades after Montgomery published her novels, resulting in Green Gables&#x27; purchase by the government of Canada in 1936. The government initially operated the home as a historic house that depicted 19th century farming life on Prince Edward Island. However, by the 1970s plans were undertaken to refurbish the building to resemble Green Gables as depicted in Montgomery&#x27;s novels. Since 1985, Green Gables and the larger National Historic Site operate as a museum of Lucy Maud Montgomery and her novels.

==History==
Green Gables was initially owned by the MacNeil family, relatives of Lucy Maud Montgomery, the author of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;. The building was initially built by the family during the 1830s and was expanded during the 1870s and in 1921, the latter expansion resulting in the building&#x27;s present L-shape.

In 1908, Montgomery published &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, with Green Gables serving as the home for the titular character Anne Shirley. Interest in the home grew after the publication of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; and the release of a movie based on the novels in 1934. With Green Gables vacant during the 1930s, the government of Canada purchased the property in 1936 as a part of a larger effort to develop Prince Edward Island National Park. In 1938, plans were made to develop Green Gables into a clubhouse for the adjacent golf course; but these plans were abandoned after public backlash against the proposal. After Montgomery&#x27;s death in 1942, her body was transported from Ontario to Prince Edward Island, with a funeral ceremony held at Green Gables.

During the 1950s, the home was furnished with period-appropriate furniture and was used as a historic house. During the 1970s, the building was refurnished and remodelled to resemble the Green Gables depicted in Montgomery&#x27;s novels. In the same decade, the building was expanded again; before it underwent significant restorations in 1985, after Parks Canada decided to switch the furnishing in the home to reflect how Green Gables was depicted in Montgomery&#x27;s novels.

On 10 July 1985, Green Gables was officially designated as a Federal Heritage Building as an example of 19th century architecture in the province, and for the home&#x27;s importance to the literary community. The larger property, including the ruins of Montgomery&#x27;s homestead were designated as the L.M. Montgomery&#x27;s Cavendish National Historic Site of Canada in 2004.

In 2017, the government unveiled a million restoration plan to restore the Green Gables building, in addition to building a new interpretive centre. On 29 August 2019, an interpretive centre built north of the Green Gables homestead was opened to the public; with Hisako, Princess Takamado in attendance for the interpretive centre&#x27;s grand opening. On 1 December 2020, Green Gables was awarded the Japanese Foreign Minister&#x27;s commendation for their contributions to promotion of mutual understanding between Canada and Japan.

==Property==

Green Gables is situated on the L.M. Montgomery&#x27;s Cavendish National Historic Site of Canada, a large property that also includes Montgomery&#x27;s homestead, greenspaces that served as inspiration for Montgomery&#x27;s novel, and several trails including &quot;Haunted Woods&quot;, &quot;Lovers&#x27; Lane&quot;, and &quot;Balsam Hollow&quot;. The larger property was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada on 12 October 2004. The property itself is situated within Prince Edward Island National Park.

The National Historic Site is largely divided into two areas, Montgomery&#x27;s home and Green Gables. The former served as the home for the author of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; and consists of the ruins of her home and other farm buildings from the late-19th century. Green Gables is situated to the west of Montgomery&#x27;s home; with the lands surrounding Green Gables also including a historic schoolhouse, farm buildings, and trails. In 2019, an interpretive centre built north of Green Gables was opened to the public, and houses exhibitions on Montgomery and her novels, particularly &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;. Designed by Root Architecture, the centre includes exhibition spaces, gift shop, and offices. The interpretive centre surrounds a courtyard. Timber framing and panels is used throughout the interpretive centre.
===Green Gables===

Green Gables is a -storey L-shaped home clad in white-painted shingles throughout; with the only other colour present on the building being the green-gabled rooftop and its window shutters. The green gable and shutters were painted onto the building shortly after the federal government purchased it in 1936, in an effort to make the building more &quot;suitable,&quot; for its opening. There are six windows on the two floors of the building, each with shutters. The includes five bedrooms, a dining room, sewing room, and a parlour. Although wood is used throughout the home, the building&#x27;s chimneys are made of brick.

<text>.us is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the United States. It was established in February 1985. Registrants of .us domains must be U.S. citizens, residents, or organizations – or foreign entities with a presence in the United States or any territory of the United States. Most registrants in the U.S. have registered for .com, .net, .org and other gTLDs, instead of .us, which has primarily been used by state and local governments, even though private entities may also register .us domains. The domain is managed by Registry Services, LLC, the domain name registry division of GoDaddy, on behalf of the United States Department of Commerce.

The .us domain is less commonly used by American businesses and enterprises than the more international .com.

==History==
On February 15, 1985, .us was created as the Internet&#x27;s first ccTLD. Its original administrator was Jon Postel of the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) at the University of Southern California (USC). He administered .us under a subcontract that the ISI and USC had from SRI International (which held the .us and the gTLD contract with the United States Department of Defense) and later Network Solutions (which held the .us and the gTLD contract with the National Science Foundation).

Postel and his colleague Ann Westine Cooper codified the .us ccTLD&#x27;s policies in December 1992 as RFC 1386 and revised them the following June in RFC 1480. Registrants could only register third-level domains or higher in a geographic and organizational hierarchy. From June 1993 to June 1997, Postel delegated the vast majority of the geographic subdomains under .us to various public and private entities. .us registrants could register with the delegated manager for the specific zone they wished to register in, but not directly with the .us administrator. In July 1997, Postel instituted a &quot;50/500 rule&quot; that limited each delegated manager to 500 localities maximum, 50 in a given state.

In June 1998, Postel raised the possibility of covering IANA operating costs by charging locality name registrars, who would pass the costs along to individual registrants. In September 1998, the United States Postal Service proposed funding the operations in order to assume control of .us, as part of a plan to diversify away from postage revenue. On October 1, 1998, the NSF transferred oversight of the .us domain to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States Department of Commerce. Postel died that month, leaving his domain administration responsibilities with ISI. In December 2000, these responsibilities were transferred to Network Solutions, which had recently been acquired by Verisign.

On October 26, 2001, Neustar was awarded the contract to administer .us. On April 24, 2002, second-level domains under .us became available for registration. One of the first .us domain hacks, icio.us, was registered on May 3, 2002, for the creation of the subdomain del.icio.us. A moratorium was placed on additional delegations of locality-based namespaces, and Neustar became the default delegate for undelegated localities. Neustar&#x27;s contract was renewed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in 2007 and most recently in 2014.

On March 31, 2019, the .us registry made it clear that under its Acceptable Use Policy it would not allow the sale of opioids through the .us top level domain.

In Q2 2020, GoDaddy acquired Neustar&#x27;s registry business.

== Locality namespace ==
The .us ccTLD is historically organized under a complex &quot;locality namespace&quot; hierarchy. Until second-level registrations were introduced in 2002, .us permitted only fourth-level domain registrations of the form ...us, with some exceptions for government entities. Registrants of locality-based domains must meet the same criteria as in the rest of the .us ccTLD. Though the locality namespace is most commonly used for government entities, it is also open to registrations by private businesses and individuals. Since 2002, second-level domain registrations have eclipsed those in the locality namespace, and many local governments have transitioned to .org and other TLDs. In the 2010s, the first top-level domains for U.S. cities became available as paid alternatives to third-level locality domains, including .nyc as an alternative to .new-york.ny.us.

Many locality-based zones of .us are delegated to various public and private entities known as &quot;delegated managers&quot;. Domains in these zones are registered through the delegated manager, rather than through GoDaddy. As the delegated managers are expected to receive requests directly from registrants, few if any domain name registrars serve this space, possibly contributing to its lower visibility and utilization. RFC 1480 describes the rationale for the locality namespace&#x27;s deep hierarchy and local delegation:

This hierarchical system has proven unappealing to companies that operate nationally or globally.

As of October 31, 2013, 12,979 domains were registered under the locality namespace, of which 3,653 were managed by about 1,300 delegated managers while 9,326 were managed by Neustar as the &quot;de facto&quot; manager. According to a 2013 survey of 539 delegated managers, 282 were state or local government agencies, while 98 were private individuals and 85 were commercial Internet service providers. Nearly 90% of the respondents offer domain registrations for free.

The .au and .ca ccTLDs have also established third- and fourth-level locality namespaces, though the .ca locality namespace is no longer open to registrations. The .cn ccTLD maintains a third-level locality namespace in general use.

===States and territories ===
A two-letter second-level domain is formally reserved for each U.S. state, federal territory, and the District of Columbia. Each domain corresponds to a USPS abbreviation. For example, .ny.us is reserved for websites affiliated with New York, while .va.us is for those affiliated with Virginia. Second-level domains are also reserved for five U.S. territories: .as.us for American Samoa, .gu.us for Guam, .mp.us for the Northern Mariana Islands, .pr.us for Puerto Rico, and .vi.us for the U.S. Virgin Islands. However, these domains go unused because each territory has its own ccTLD per ISO 3166-1 alpha-2: respectively, .as, .gu, .mp, .pr, and .vi.

A state&#x27;s main government portal is usually found at the third-level domain state..us, which is reserved for this purpose. However, some state administrations prefer .gov domains: for example, California&#x27;s government portal is located at , while redirects to Massachusetts&#x27;s portal at . Fully spelled-out names of states are also reserved under .us, so the State of Ohio&#x27;s website was at one point available at in addition to the usual , with the former remaining as a redirect. Other than for state governments, no third-level domain registrations are permitted under state or territory second-level domains.

A few additional names are reserved at the second level for government agencies that are not subordinate to a state government:

* &quot;fed.us&quot; for agencies of the U.S. federal government (which in practice generally use &quot;.gov&quot;)
** Example: (United States Forest Service)
* &quot;isa.us&quot; for interstate authorities created by interstate compacts
** Example: (Interstate Mining Compact Commission)
* &quot;nsn.us&quot; for Native Sovereign Nations (which may also use &quot;-nsn.gov&quot;)
** Example: (Mohegan Tribe)
* &quot;dni.us&quot; for distributed national institutes
** Example: (Conference of Chief Justices, part of the National Center for State Courts)

===Locality domains===
A large number of third-level domains are reserved for localities within states. Each fourth-level domain registration under this namespace follows the format ...us, where is a state&#x27;s two-letter postal abbreviation and is a hyphenated name that corresponds to a ZIP code or appears in a well-known atlas.

Two values of are formally reserved across the entire locality namespace for city and county governments:

* ci...us for city governments
** Example: (Davenport, Iowa)
* co...us for county governments
** Example: (Adams County, Idaho)

Delegated managers often reserve additional names for different kinds of local governments:

* &quot;borough&quot;...us for borough governments
** Example: (Shippensburg, Pennsylvania)
* &quot;city&quot;...us for city governments
** Example: (Cleveland, Ohio)
* &quot;county&quot;...us for county governments
* &quot;parish&quot;...us for parish governments (unused)
* &quot;town&quot;...us for town governments
** Example: (Windermere, Florida)
* &quot;twp&quot;...us or &quot;township&quot;...us for township governments
** Examples: (Russell Township, Geauga County, Ohio), (Stroud Township, Pennsylvania)
* &quot;vil&quot;...us or &quot;village&quot;...us for village governments
** Examples: (Stockbridge, Michigan), (Fairport, New York)

In some cases, a local government that serves as the delegated manager for its own locality may locate its website directly under the , omitting the . For example, the website of the City of Brunswick, Ohio, is located at rather than www.ci.brunswick.oh.us, and the website of Delhi Township, Ohio, is located at instead of www.twp.delhi.oh.us. Many large cities use .gov extensions, for example New York City: ; Chicago: , Rochester, New York: ; and Atlanta: .

Private organizations and individuals may register fourth-level domains parallel to these government domains, for example:

* (a family in San Jose, California)

===Affinity namespaces===
Directly beneath the .us zone, several &quot;affinity namespaces&quot; are reserved for specific purposes:

* &quot;state&quot;: state government agencies (.state..us)
** Example: (Governor of Alaska)
* &quot;dst&quot;: government agencies in administrative districts (.dst..us)
** Example: (a water district in California)
* &quot;cog&quot;: councils of governments, that is, federations of cities or counties (.cog..us)
** Example: (Texoma Council of Governments)
* &quot;k12&quot;: public elementary and/or secondary unified school districts (.k12..us) individual schools (.k12..us). Also used by public agencies overseeing educational institutions.
** Examples: (San Francisco Unified School District), (Pioneer Career and Technology Center), (Washington State Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction)
** &quot;pvt.k12&quot;: private elementary or secondary schools (.pvt.k12..us or ..pvt.k12..us)
*** Examples: (Firelands Montessori Academy), (a private K-12 school in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland in Ohio)
* &quot;cc&quot;: community colleges (.cc..us)
** Example: (Clackamas Community College)
* &quot;tec&quot;: technical and vocational schools (.tec..us)
** Example: (Alexandria Technical and Community College)
* &quot;lib&quot;: public libraries (.lib..us)
** Example: (Monroe County District Library)
* &quot;mus&quot;: museums (.mus..us)
** Example: (a local historical museum)
* &quot;gen&quot;: general independent entities (clubs or other groups not fitting into the above categories) (.gen..us)
** Examples: (an amateur radio association in Minnesota), (Texas Regional Hostmaster, the .tx.us delegated manager)

Some of these affinity namespaces have been supplanted by more convenient sponsored top-level domains. The first sTLD, .museum, became available in October 2001 as an alternative to the .mus namespace. Since April 2003, the .edu top-level domain has been available as an alternative for community colleges, technical and vocational schools, and other tertiary educational institutions that might have previously used the .cc or .tec affinity namespaces.

Although the Kentucky Department of Education operates the .k12.ky.us namespace for Kentucky school districts, most districts instead use subdomains of the less formal domain kyschools.us, which the department operates in a similar manner. For example, Gallatin county schools have a website at , while Paducah Public Schools are located at and the McCracken County Public Schools use as a redirect to .

==Kids.us==
The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 () established a &quot;.kids.us&quot; second-level domain. The general public could register third-level domains under &quot;.kids.us&quot; for educational content that met strict requirements, including conformance to the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act and adherence to Children&#x27;s Advertising Review Unit standards. Webpages were prohibited from linking outside the &quot;.kids.us&quot; namespace. On July 27, 2012, in response to declining usage and a petition by Neustar the previous year, the NTIA suspended &quot;.kids.us&quot; registrations. By that time, 651 domains were registered under &quot;.kids.us&quot;, and only five registrants (Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., PBS Kids, the Smithsonian Center for Education and Museum Studies, and Super-Fun Sports Inc operating trampoline.kids.us and trampolines.kids.us) were operating active websites.

== Restrictions on use ==
Under .us nexus requirements, .us domains may be registered only by the following qualified entities:
* Any United States citizen or resident,
* Any United States entity, such as organizations or corporations,
* Any foreign entity or organization with a bona fide presence in the United States

To ensure that these requirements are met, GoDaddy frequently conducts &quot;spot checks&quot; on registrant information.

To prevent anonymous registrations that do not meet these requirements, in 2005 the National Telecommunications and Information Administration ruled that registrants of .us domains may not secure private domain name registration via anonymizing proxies, and that their contact information must be made public. Registrants are required to provide complete contact information without omissions.

Under the locality namespace, delegated managers may impose additional requirements. For example, the Texas Regional Hostmaster restricts each of its delegated localities to organizations that have a mailing address in that locality.

<text>Benicia Capitol State Historic Park is a state park in Benicia, California, United States. The park is dedicated to California&#x27;s third capitol building, where the California State Legislature convened from February 3, 1853, to February 24, 1854, when they voted to move the state capital to Sacramento. It is the only pre-Sacramento capitol that remains. The park includes the Fischer-Hanlon House, an early Benicia building that was moved to the property and converted into a home in 1858, after the legislature departed. Benicia Capitol State Historic Park just off the city&#x27;s main street also includes a carriage house, workers&#x27; quarters and sculptured gardens.

==History==
Following large complaints by state legislators of inadequate furniture and sleeping quarters in Vallejo, California in early 1853, the Legislature, with the consent of Governor John Bigler, relocated the state capital to nearby Benicia that same year. The Legislature convened in the Benicia City Hall for a little more than a year, when again complaints over poor weather conditions, inadequate and uncomfortable sleeping quarters, and &quot;the insecure condition of the public archives&quot; arose in January 1854.

After a proposal by Sacramento to use the Sacramento County Courthouse free of charge as a capitol building, the Assembly and Senate passed an enabling act, voiding all previous legislation, to move the state capital to its new location upriver in Sacramento. On February 25, 1854, Governor Bigler signed the act into law, moving the capital to its current location. The Legislature and governor climbed aboard the steamship &quot;Wilson G. Hunt&quot; to take up its new quarters. &quot;So much opposed to the removal were the good people of Benicia,&quot; the &quot;Sacramento Union&quot; reported, &quot;that the owners of the wharves, it is stated, refused to permit the steamer ... to land to take on the legislative furniture, unless she would pay $500.&quot; This request was refused and the furniture was shipped from a different wharf.

The Greek Revival-Palladian building was listed as a California State Historic Landmark on January 11, 1935. The National Register of Historic Places placed the Benicia capitol on the federal list on February 12, 1971.

==Present day==
The original building has been restored with reconstructed period furnishings and exhibits. The interior includes a reconstruction of the building&#x27;s original floor with ponderosa pine. The desks, four of which are from the 1850s or earlier, are furnished with a candlestick, a 19th-century newspaper, a quill pen, blotting sand, a spitoon, and a top hat.

The historic park is located at 115 West G Street in Benicia, a city in the northern San Francisco Bay Area between San Pablo Bay and Suisun Bay.

On February 16, 2000, the California State Legislature met in the old Capitol in a symbolic session to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Legislature&#x27;s first meeting.

==Proposed for closure==
The Benicia Capitol State Historic Park was one of the 48 California state parks proposed for closure in January 2008 by California&#x27;s Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as part of a deficit reduction program, since rescinded following public outcry. It also was placed on the Governor&#x27;s list of two hundred parks to close in fall of 2009 in response to the ongoing budget crisis and was on Jerry Brown&#x27;s 2011 list of 70 proposed state park closures in the continuing budget crises.

In March 2013, then-Director of California Department of Parks and Recreation, Anthony L. Jackson, announced that no state parks would close during his tenure and that he had &quot;done away with park closures.&quot;

<doc id="605079" wikidata="Q109061" url="?curid=605079" title="Guido Reni">
<text>Guido Reni (; 4 November 1575 – 18 August 1642) was an Italian Baroque painter, although his works showed a classical manner, similar to Simon Vouet, Nicolas Poussin, and Philippe de Champaigne. He painted primarily religious works, but also mythological and allegorical subjects. Active in Rome, Naples, and his native Bologna, he became the dominant figure in the Bolognese School that emerged under the influence of the Carracci.

==Biography==
Born in Bologna into a family of musicians, Guido Reni was the only child of Daniele Reni and Ginevra Pozzi. Apprenticed at the age of nine to the Bolognese studio of Denis Calvaert, he was soon joined in that studio by Albani and Domenichino. 

When Reni was about twenty years old, the three Calvaert pupils migrated to the rising rival studio, named &quot;Accademia degli Incamminati&quot; (Academy of the &quot;newly embarked&quot;, or progressives), led by Ludovico Carracci. They went on to form the nucleus of a prolific and successful school of Bolognese painters who followed Ludovico&#x27;s cousin, Annibale Carracci, to Rome.

Reni completed commissions for his first altarpieces while in the Carracci academy. He left the academy by 1598, after an argument with Ludovico Carracci over unpaid work. Around this time he made his first prints, a series commemorating Pope Clement VIII&#x27;s visit to Bologna in 1598.

===Work in Rome===
By late 1601 Reni and Albani had moved to Rome to work with the teams led by Annibale Carracci in fresco decoration of the Farnese Palace. By 1604–05 he received an independent commission for an altarpiece of the &quot;Crucifixion of St. Peter&quot;. After returning briefly to Bologna, he went back to Rome to become one of the premier painters during the papacy of Pope Paul V (Borghese); between 1607 and 1614 he became one of the painters most patronized by the Borghese family.
Located in &quot;Casino dell&#x27; Aurora&quot; on the grounds of the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi, is Reni&#x27;s fresco masterpiece, &quot;L&#x27;Aurora&quot;. The building was originally a pavilion commissioned by Cardinal Scipione Borghese; the rear portion overlooks the Piazza Montecavallo and Palazzo del Quirinale. 

The massive fresco is framed &quot;in quadri riportati&quot; and depicts &quot;Apollo in his Chariot preceded by Dawn (Aurora) bringing light to the world&quot;. The work is restrained in classicism, copying poses from Roman sarcophagi, and showing far more simplicity and restraint than Carracci&#x27;s riotous &quot;Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne&quot; in the Farnese. 

In this painting, Reni allies himself more with the sterner Cavaliere d&#x27;Arpino, Lanfranco, and Albani &quot;School&quot; of mytho-historic painting, and less with the more crowded frescoes characteristic of Pietro da Cortona. There is little concession to perspective, and the vibrantly coloured style is antithetical to the tenebrism of Caravaggio&#x27;s followers. Documents show that Reni was paid 247 &quot;scudi&quot; and 54 &quot;baiocchi&quot; upon completion of his work on 24 September 1616.
In 1630 the Barberini family of Pope Urban VIII commissioned from Reni a painting of the Archangel Michael for the church of Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini. The painting, completed in 1636, gave rise to an old legend that Reni had represented Satan—crushed under St Michael&#x27;s foot—with the facial features of Cardinal Giovanni Battista Pamphilj in revenge for a slight. 

Reni also frescoed the Paoline Chapel of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome as well as the Aldobrandini wings of the Vatican. According to rumour, the pontifical chapel of Montecavallo (Chapel of the Annunciation) was assigned to Reni to paint. However, because he felt underpaid by the papal ministers, the artist left Rome once again for Bologna, leaving the role of the pre-eminent artist in Rome to Domenichino.

===Work in Naples and return to Bologna===

Returning to Bologna more or less permanently after 1614, Reni established a successful and prolific studio there. He was commissioned to decorate the cupola of the chapel of Saint Dominic in Bologna&#x27;s Basilica of San Domenico between 1613 and 1615, resulting in the radiant fresco &quot;Saint Dominic in Glory&quot;, a masterpiece that can stand comparison with the exquisite Arca di San Domenico below it. 

He also contributed to the decoration of the Rosary Chapel in the same church with a &quot;Resurrection&quot;; and in 1611 he had already painted for San Domenico a superb &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot; (now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna) which became an important reference for the French Neoclassic style, as well as a model for details in Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;. In 1614–15 he painted &quot;The Israelites Gathering Manna&quot; for a chapel in the cathedral of Ravenna.

Circa 1615 in Bologna, Reni created one of his most reproduced works, Saint Sebastian (sometimes called by the Italian San Sebastiano). The painting is thought to have been a commission for a member of the papal court due to the presence of lapis lazuli in the blue of the sky, an expensive material usually supplied by clients. Reni painted Saint Sebastian a total of six times, though the 1615 rendition is arguably the most recognizable. Notably, the painting has been adored by Oscar Wilde and other gay artists throughout history. 

Leaving Bologna briefly in 1618, Reni travelled to Naples to complete a commission to paint a ceiling in a chapel of the cathedral of San Gennaro. However, in Naples, other prominent local painters, including Corenzio, Caracciolo and Ribera, were vehemently resistant to competitors, and according to rumour, conspired to poison or otherwise harm Reni (as may have befallen Domenichino in Naples after him). Reni&#x27;s assistant was so badly wounded that he returned to Rome. Reni, who had a great fear of being poisoned, chose not to outstay his welcome.

After leaving Rome, Reni alternately painted in different styles, but displayed less eclectic tastes than many of Carracci&#x27;s trainees. For example, his altarpiece for &quot;Samson Victorious&quot; formulates stylized poses, like those characteristic of Mannerism.

In contrast, his &quot;Crucifixion&quot; and his &quot;Atlanta and Hipomenes&quot; depict dramatic diagonal movement coupled with the effects of light and shade that portray the more Baroque influence of Caravaggio. His turbulent yet realistic &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot; (Pinacoteca, Bologna) is painted in a manner reminiscent of a late Raphael. In 1625 Prince Władysław Sigismund Vasa of Poland visited the artist&#x27;s workshop in Bologna during his visit to Western Europe. The close rapport between the painter and the Polish prince resulted in the acquisition of drawings and paintings.

In 1630, while Bologna was suffering from plague, Reni painted the &quot;Pallion del Voto&quot; with images of Saints Ignatius of Loyola and Francis Xavier.

By the 1630s Reni&#x27;s painting style became looser, less impastoed, and dominated by lighter colours. A compulsive gambler, Reni was often in financial distress despite the steady demand for his paintings. According to his biographer, Carlo Cesare Malvasia, Reni&#x27;s need to recoup gambling losses resulted in rushed execution and multiple copies of his works produced by his workshop. The paintings of his last years include many unfinished works.

Reni&#x27;s themes are mostly biblical and mythological. He painted few portraits; those of Sixtus V and of Cardinal Bernardino Spada are among the most noteworthy, along with one of his mother (in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna) and a few self-portraits – both from his youth and from his old age.

The so-called &quot;Beatrice Cenci&quot;, formerly ascribed to Reni and praised by generations of admirers, is now regarded as a doubtful attribution. Beatrice Cenci was executed in Rome before Reni ever lived there and thus could not have sat for the portrait. Many etchings are attributed to Guido Reni, some after his own paintings and some after other masters. They are spirited, in a light style of delicate lines and dots. Reni&#x27;s technique, as used by the Bolognese school, was the standard for Italian printmakers of his time.

Reni died in Bologna in 1642. He was buried there in the Rosary Chapel of the Basilica of San Domenico; the painter Elisabetta Sirani (whose father had been Reni&#x27;s pupil and whom some considered the artistic reincarnation of Reni) was later interred in the same tomb.

==Pupils and legacy==
Reni was the most famous Italian artist of his generation. 

Through his many pupils, he had a wide-ranging influence on later Baroque. In the centre of Bologna, he established two studios, teeming with nearly 200 pupils. His most distinguished pupil was Simone Cantarini, named &quot;Il Pesarese&quot;, who painted the portrait of his master now in the Bolognese Gallery. 

Reni&#x27;s other Bolognese pupils included Antonio Randa (early on in his career considered the best pupil of Reni, until he tried to kill his master), Vincenzo Gotti, Emilio Savonanzi, Sebastiano Brunetti, Tommaso Campana, Domenico Maria Canuti, Bartolomeo Marescotti, Giovanni Maria Tamburino, and Pietro Gallinari (Pierino del Signor Guido).

Other artists who trained under Reni include Antonio Giarola (Cavalier Coppa), Giovanni Battista Michelini, Guido Cagnacci, Giovanni Boulanger of Troyes, Paolo Biancucci of Lucca, Pietro Ricci or Righi of Lucca, Pietro Lauri Monsu, Giacomo Semenza, Gioseffo and Giovanni Stefano Danedi, Giovanni Giacomo Manno, Carlo Cittadini of Milan, Luigi Scaramuccia, Bernardo Cerva, Francesco Costanzo Cattaneo of Ferrara, Giulio Dinarelli, Francesco Gessi, and Marco Bandinelli.

Beyond Italy, Reni&#x27;s influence was important in the style of many Spanish Baroque artists, such as Jusepe de Ribera and Murillo.

But his work was particularly appreciated in France—Stendhal believed Reni must have had &quot;a French soul&quot;—and influenced generations of French artists such as Le Sueur, Le Brun, Vien, and Greuze; as well as on later French Neoclassic painters. In the 19th century, Reni&#x27;s reputation declined as a result of changing taste—epitomized by John Ruskin&#x27;s censorious judgment that the artist&#x27;s work was sentimental and false.

A revival of interest in Reni has occurred since 1954 when an important retrospective exhibition of his work was mounted in Bologna.

<doc id="605080" wikidata="Q375213" url="?curid=605080" title="International Color Consortium">
<text>The International Color Consortium (ICC) was formed in 1993 by eight vendors in order to create an open, vendor-neutral color management system which would function transparently across all operating systems and software packages.

==Overview==
The ICC specification, currently on version 4.4, allows for matching of color when moved between applications and operating systems, from the point of creation to the final output, whether display or print. This specification is technically identical to ISO 15076-1:2010, available from ISO.

The ICC profile describes the color attributes of a particular device or viewing requirement by defining a mapping between the source or target color space and a &quot;profile connection space&quot; (PCS).

The ICC defines the specification precisely but does not define algorithms or processing details. As such, applications or systems that work with different ICC profiles are allowed to vary.

ICC has also published a preliminary specification for iccMAX, a next-generation color management architecture with significantly expanded functionality and a choice of colorimetric, spectral, or material connection space. Details are at https://www.color.org/iccmax/

==Membership==
The eight founding members of the ICC were Adobe, Agfa, Apple, Kodak, Microsoft, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems, and Taligent. Sun Microsystems, Silicon Graphics, and Taligent have since left the organization.

 there are 5 founding members, 37 regular members and 18 honorary members. Most members specialize in photography, printing, or Electronic visual displays. Regular members include:
BenQ,
Canon,
Dolby,
Fuji,
Heidelberg Printing Machines AG,
Hewlett–Packard,
Konica Minolta,
Kyocera,
Nikon,
Seiko,
Sun Chemical,
Toshiba,
vivo,
Xerox,
Xiaomi,
and X-Rite.

<doc id="605092" wikidata="Q1050858" url="?curid=605092" title="Hughes OH-6 Cayuse">
<text>The Hughes OH-6 Cayuse is a single-engine light helicopter designed and produced by the American aerospace company Hughes Helicopters. Its formal name is derived from the Cayuse people, while its &quot;Loach&quot; nickname is derived from Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) program under which it was procured.

The OH-6 was developed to meet United States Army Technical Specification 153, issued in 1960 to replace its Bell H-13 Sioux fleet. The &quot;Model 369&quot; submitted by Hughes competed against two other finalists, Fairchild-Hiller and Bell, for a production contract. On 27 February 1963, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight. The Model 369 had a distinctive teardrop-shaped fuselage that was crashworthy and provided excellent external visibility. Its four-bladed full-articulated main rotor made it particularly agile, and it was suitable for personnel transport, escort and attack missions, and observation. During May 1965, the U.S. Army awarded a production contract to Hughes.

During 1966, the OH-6 began service with the U.S. Army, and promptly entered active combat in the Vietnam War. In theater, it was commonly operated in teams with rotorcraft such as the Bell AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter, using so-called &quot;hunter-killer&quot; tactics to flush out and eliminate hostile ground targets. The OH-6 would act as bait to draw enemy fire and mark targets for other platforms such as the AH-1 to attack. In one clandestine incident in 1972, known as the Vinh wiretap, a pair of OH-6As were heavily modified and used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) via Air America to infiltrate Vietnamese high level communications, providing valuable intelligence. Reportedly, 964 out of the 1,422 OH-6As produced for the U.S. Army were destroyed in Vietnam alone.

During 1967, following price escalations for the OH-6, the U.S. Army reopened the program to bids for as many as 2,700 additional airframes beyond the 1,300 OH-6s already contracted. Following a competitive fly-off and a sealed bidding process, Hughes lost the contract to Bell, resulting in the competing Bell OH-58 Kiowa being produced. The OH-6/Model 369 was license-produced overseas by the Japanese aerospace company Kawasaki Heavy Industries for both military and civilian operators. It was also developed into a civilian helicopter, the Model 500, produced into the 21st century by MD Helicopters as the &quot;MD 500&quot;.

==Development==
===Background===

During 1960, the United States Army issued Technical Specification 153 for a &quot;Light Observation Helicopter&quot; (LOH) capable of fulfilling various roles on the battlefield, including personnel transport, escort, casualty evacuation, observation, and attack missions. These would be used to replace its fleet of Bell H-13 Sioux, a compact first generation rotorcraft. Twelve companies opted to participate in the competition, Hughes Tool Company&#x27;s Aircraft Division being one of them, submitted the &quot;Model 369&quot; as its response. Two of these designs, those submitted by Fairchild-Hiller and Bell, were selected as finalists by the Army-Navy design competition board. However, the U.S. Army subsequently chose to include Hughes&#x27;s Model 369 for further consideration as well.

In terms of its basic configuration, the Model 369 had an atypical teardrop-shaped fuselage, a feature that led to personnel sometimes referring to it as the &quot;flying egg&quot;. This shaping, combined with the provision of internal bulkheads, has been attributed as giving the rotorcraft its uncommonly strong crashworthiness properties. This aspect was further bolstered by the use of self-sealing fuel tanks that lowered the likelihood of a post-impact fire breaking out. The pilot was provisioned with excellent external visibility via its large plexiglass windscreen, while its four-bladed fully-articulated main rotor meant it was considerably more agile than the preceding H-13 Sioux. It would often be crewed by a pilot and an observer; up to five passengers or up to 1,000lb of cargo could be carried internally.

===Into flight===
On 27 February 1963, the first Model 369 prototype performed its maiden flight. Originally designated as the &quot;YHO-6A&quot; according to the Army&#x27;s designation system, the aircraft was redesignated as the &quot;YOH-6A&quot; in 1962 when the Department of Defense created a joint designation system for all aircraft. A total of five prototypes were built, all of which were powered by a single Allison T63-A-5A turboshaft engine, capable of producing . The prototypes were delivered to the U.S. Army at Fort Rucker, Alabama, where they competed against the other ten prototype aircraft produced by Bell and Fairchild-Hiller. During the course of the competition, the Bell submission, the &quot;YOH-4&quot;, was eliminated as being underpowered (it was powered by the T63-A-5). Accordingly, the bidding for the LOH contract came down to Fairchild-Hiller and Hughes. Ultimately, Hughes was selected as the winner of the competition.
During May 1965, the U.S. Army awarded a production contract to Hughes; this initial order for 714 rotorcraft was subsequently increased to 1,300 along with an option for another 114. Hughes&#x27;s price was $19,860 per airframe, without the engine, while Hiller&#x27;s price was $29,415 per airframe, also without the engine. The Hiller design, designated OH-5A, had featured a boosted control system, while the Hughes design did not, a difference that accounted for some of the price increase. Hughes is reported to have told his confidant, Jack Real, that he lost over $100 million to construct 1,370 airframes. It was reported that Howard Hughes had directed his company to submit a bid at a price beneath the actual production cost of the helicopter in order to secure this order. Accordingly, this tactic had resulted in substantial losses being incurred on the contract with the U.S. Army; the company had allegedly anticipated that an extended production cycle would eventually make the rotorcraft financially viable.

Due to price escalations for both the OH-6 and spare components, the U.S. Army opted to reopen bids for the program in 1967. Accordingly, during 1968, Hughes submitted a bid to build a further 2,700 airframes. Stanley Hiller complained to the U.S. Army that Hughes had used unethical procedures; therefore, the Army opened the contract for rebidding by all parties. While Hiller did not participate in the rebidding, Bell opted to, submitting their redesigned Model 206. Following a competitive fly-off, the Army requested the manufacturers to submit sealed bids. Hughes bid $56,550 per airframe, while Bell bid $54,200. Reportedly, Hughes had consulted at the last moment with Real, who recommended a bid of $53,550. Hughes, without informing Real, raised the bid by $3,000, and thus lost the contract to Bell. 1,420 of the OH-6A would be produced, not counting the other derivatives.

===Japanese production===

A total of 387 OH-6/Hughes 369s were produced under license in Japan by the Japanese aerospace company Kawasaki Heavy Industries. These rotorcraft were operated by several different organisations, the majority of which were based in Japan. Military operators included the Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), and the Japanese Coast Guard. Furthermore, a number of civilian customers also flew Kawasaki-built OH-6s for a variety of missions, including emergency medical services (EMS), law enforcement, and agricultural work. Beginning in 2001, the JGSDF OH-6s were supplemented by the Kawasaki OH-1, a more advanced observation helicopter.

==Operational history==

===Entry into service and world records===

During 1966, the OH-1 entered service with the U.S. Army. Its first overseas deployment, as well as into frontline combat, was the Vietnam War. The pilots dubbed the new helicopter &quot;Loach&quot;, a word created by pronunciation of the LOH (light observation helicopter) acronym of the program that spawned the aircraft. (Loach is also the name for numerous stream-dwelling carnivorous or insectivorous fishes, especially common in South-East Asia, which specialise in hunting among substrates and dense cover.) During 1964, the U.S. Department of Defense issued a memorandum directing that all U.S. Army fixed-wing aircraft be transferred to the U.S. Air Force, while the U.S. Army transitioned to solely operating &quot;rotor-wing&quot; aircraft. Accordingly, the U.S. Army&#x27;s fixed-wing airplane, the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog, which was utilized for artillery observation and reconnaissance flights, would be replaced by the incoming OH-6A.

Early on in the OH-6&#x27;s career, the type demonstrated its performance in a particularly prominent manner via the setting of 23 individual world records for helicopters during 1966 in the categories of speed, endurance and time to climb. On 26 March 1966, Jack Schwiebold set the closed circuit distance record in a YOH-6A at Edwards Air Force Base, California, flying without landing for 1,739.96 mi (2,800.20 km). Subsequently, on 6 April 1966, Robert Ferry set the long-distance world record for helicopters by flying from Culver City, California, with over a ton of fuel to Ormond Beach, Florida, covering a total of 1,923.08 nm (2,213.04 mi, 3,561.55 km) in 15 hours, and near the finish at up to altitude. As of 2021, these records still stand.

===Vietnam War===

In December 1967, the first OH-6As arrived in South Vietnam. Its straightforward design made it easier to maintain than most other helicopters, its relatively compact main rotor made it easier to use tight landing zones. While its light aluminum skin could be easily penetrated by small arms fire, it also crumpled and absorbed energy in a crash while the rugged structure protected key systems and its crew. The OH-6 was relatively difficult to shoot down, and its occupants would often survive forced landings that would have likely been fatal onboard other rotorcraft. The remaining H-13s were promptly withdrawn in favour of the OH-6s. Typically missions were flown during the daylight, starting at dawn; common roles included the clearance of landing zones and general intelligence/observation flights.

It became common for OH-6s to operate in teams with other rotorcraft, particularly the Bell AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter. This teamwork was actively encouraged by Army officials, and led to the development of so-called &quot;hunter-killer&quot; tactics that sought to flush out and eliminate hostile ground targets. Such a team would have normally comprised a single OH-6 that would fly relatively slow and at a low altitude while attempting to spot the presence of enemies. If the OH-6 came under fire, the nearby Cobra would then strike at the revealed enemy. As to indicate the position of concealed enemy ground forces, the observer in the OH-6 would mark the spot using a smoke grenade, assisting other units in effectively firing upon them. Over time, the effectiveness of this pairing was such that enemies would often decide against firing on the relatively vulnerable OH-6 in fear of the response that would be unleashed by the AH-1. Prior to the arrival of the AH-1, &quot;hunter-killer&quot; teams often relied on the firepower from armed models of the Bell UH-1 Iroquois utility helicopter.

During 1972, a pair of heavily modified OH-6As were utilized by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) via Air America for a covert wire-tapping mission. The aircraft, dubbed &quot;500P&quot; (penetrator) by Hughes, began as an ARPA project, codenamed &quot;Mainstreet&quot;, in 1968. Development included test and training flights in Culver City, California (Hughes Airport) and at Area 51 in 1971. In order to reduce their acoustic signature, the helicopters (&quot;N351X&quot; and &quot;N352X&quot;) received a four-blade &#x27;scissors&#x27; style tail rotor (later incorporated into the Hughes-designed AH-64 Apache), a fifth rotor blade and reshaped rotor tips, a modified exhaust system, and various other performance boosting modifications. During June 1972, they were deployed to a secret base in southern Laos (PS-44), where one of the helicopters was heavily damaged during a training mission late in the summer. On the night of 5–6 December 1972, the remaining helicopter deployed a wiretap near Vinh, North Vietnam; useful information provided from this wiretap was acted on by the United States on several occasions, such as during the Linebacker II campaign and Paris Peace Talks. Shortly thereafter, the aircraft were returned to the U.S., where they were dismantled and converted back to a standard configuration; they continued to be operated as such for a time.

During the early 1970s, Soviet-supplied SA-7 Grail shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles emerged amongst North Vietnamese troops; one hit could down a Loach, potentially dealing fatal damage before its crew were aware that they were under fire. All American rotorcraft in the theatre had to be operated more cautiously following this development. Reportedly, 964 out of the 1,422 OH-6As produced for the U.S. Army were destroyed in the Vietnam theatre, the majority of these losses being a result of hostile action, typically ground fire. Towards the end of the conflict, the replacement of the OH-6 by the Bell OH-58 Kiowa was imminent across nearly all U.S. Army units. Some crews argued that the Kiowa was nowhere near as nimble as the OH-6, however, the transition proceeded while scouting doctrine was changed to emphasis operations from greater distances.

===160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and Task Force 160===
Following the April 1980 failure of Operation Eagle Claw (the attempted rescue of American hostages in Tehran), it was determined that the military lacked aircraft and crews who were trained and prepared to perform special operations missions. To remedy this shortcoming, the Army began developing a special aviation task force to prepare for the next attempt to rescue the hostages: Operation Honey Badger. The architects of the task force identified the need for a small helicopter to land in the most restrictive locations and that was also easily transported on Air Force transport aircraft. They chose the OH-6A scout helicopter to fill that role, and it became known as the &quot;Little Bird&quot; compared to the other aircraft in the task force, the MH-60 and the MH-47. As a separate part of the project, armed OH-6As were being developed at Fort Rucker, Alabama.
The pilots selected to fly the OH-6A helicopters came from the 229th Attack Helicopter Battalion and were sent to the Mississippi Army National Guard&#x27;s Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF) at Gulfport, Mississippi, for two weeks of qualification training in the rotorcraft. When the training was completed, C-141 Starlifter airlifters transported both rotorcraft and crews to Fort Huachuca, Arizona, for two weeks of mission training. The mission training consisted of loading onto C-130 Hercules transport aircraft which would then transport them to forward staging areas over routes as long as . The armed OH-6s from Fort Rucker joined the training program in the fall of 1980.

Operation Honey Badger was canceled after the hostages were released on 20 January 1981, and for a short while, it looked as if the task force would be disbanded and the personnel returned to their former units. But the Army decided that it would be more prudent to keep the unit in order to be prepared for future contingencies. The task force, which had been designated as Task Force 158, was soon formed into the 160th Aviation Battalion. The OH-6A helicopters used for transporting personnel became the MH-6 aircraft of the Light Assault Company and the armed OH-6As became the AH-6 aircraft of the Light Attack Company.

On 1 October 1986, to help meet the increasing demands for support, the 1-245th Aviation Battalion from the Oklahoma National Guard, which had 25 AH-6 and 23 UH-1 helicopters, was placed under the operational control of the 160th. The 1-245th AVN BN enlisted were sent to the Mississippi Army National Guard&#x27;s Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF) at Gulfport, Mississippi, for two weeks of qualification training in the aircraft. The following two-week mission was to Yuma for night operation training. The AH/MH Little Birds were lifted by a single C-5 Galaxy, and two C-130 Hercules, along with all support kits for the battalion. Crews trained side by side with the 160th for all operational concepts. The 1-245 modified infantry night vision goggles and worked to develop the necessary skills for rapid deployment with Little Birds and C-130s.

<text>Velocette is a range of motorcycles made by Veloce Ltd, in Hall Green, Birmingham, England. One of several motorcycle manufacturers in Birmingham, Velocette was a small, family-owned firm, selling almost as many hand-built motorcycles during its lifetime as the mass-produced machines of the giant BSA and Norton concerns. Renowned for the quality of its products, the company was &quot;always in the picture&quot; in international motorcycle racing from the mid-1920s until the 1950s, culminating in two World Championship titles (1949–1950 350 cc) and its legendary and still-unbeaten (for single-cylinder, 500 cc machines) 24 hours at over 100 mph (161 km/h) record. Veloce, while small, was a great technical innovator and many of its patented designs are commonplace on motorcycles today, including the positive-stop foot shift and swinging arm rear suspension with hydraulic dampers. The business suffered a gradual commercial decline during the late 1960s, eventually closing in February 1971.

==Foundation==
The company had its origins as &quot;Taylor, Gue Co Ltd&quot; founded in 1896 by John Goodman (born Johannes Gütgemann and later known as John Taylor before formally changing his name to Johann Goodman) and William Gue, which initially made cycle frames and parts, but later made the frames for the Ormonde Motorcycle. In January 1904 they were working on a tri-car powered by a 3.5HP water-cooled four-stroke engine, with 2-speed gearbox and novel clutch system. In 1904 Ormonde merged with the engine maker Kelecombe, and when this company failed Taylor Gue bought the assets, and in 1905 built their first motorcycle, the &quot;Veloce&quot;.

Later that year, John Taylor set up Veloce Limited, to produce cycles and related products and services, and business continued for several years producing Veloce Cycles, but with his sons Percy and Eugene he investigated the use of engines as the Veloce Motor Company and produced the V.M.C motorcycle in 1910, this had a 500cc side-valve engine with direct belt-drive and the option of a hub gear. In 1912 New Veloce Motors Ltd was formed, with J. Taylor and P.J. Taylor as shareholders, registered at Veloce Works, Spring Hill, Birmingham. This company may have been to separate the risks of venturing into motorcycle manufacture from the rest of the business, but New Veloce Motors was wound up during WW1.

==Veloce Motorcycles==
The original Veloce was produced for a very short time in 1905 by Taylor Gue Ltd after acquiring the assets of Ormonde and Kelecombe (possibly because Taylor Gue had not been paid for their work on cycleparts for Ormonde).

It was in 1910 that Veloce Motor Company launched the V.M.C. motorcycle, with a 3.5HP (500cc) side-valve engine (85mm bore and 88mm stroke). Transmission was by belt-drive with the option of an Armstrong 3-speed hub gear.

In 1912 they added a smaller motorcycle, which was exhibited at the Olympia show alongside their larger model on a joint stand with Wilton Cycle Co (sidecar manufacturers). The new lightweight model had an inlet over exhaust valve arrangement, which was unusually at the front of the engine with the inlet valve being mechanically operated. The show report listed the bore and stroke as 70mm by 76mm, with pump fed oil lubrication and an outside flywheel. The two speed transmission on the smaller model was integral with the engine, an early example of unit construction patented by Percy Taylor under UK Patent 24499 in 1910. A version of this machine (enlarged to 76mm bore) was entered in the 1913 T.T. with Cyril Pullin as rider, but an oil leak caused a poor performance due to the oil getting on the belt drive.

In 1913 Veloce again exhibited their motorcycles on the Wilton Cycle and Motor Co stand, the Veloce models continued alongside the new Velocette 2-stroke. A larger version of the lightweight Veloce 4-stroke rated 2.75HP used 76mm bore (like the previous year&#x27;s T.T. model) was shown as ladies and gents models, the ladies model having a dropped frame and extra engine covers. The larger 500cc Veloce continued unchanged.

The success of the Velocette model that followed was such that when in 1925 the overhead camshaft 350 was launched under the name Veloce - the dealers protested, and the name Velocette was henceforth used for all the motorcycles.

==Velocette two-strokes==

The first two-stroke, built in 1913, was called a &quot;Velocette&quot;. When The &#x27;K&#x27; series reverted to &quot;Veloce&quot;, the buying public overlooked them, having become used to the &quot;Velocette&quot; name and associating it with quality products. The &quot;Velocette&quot; name was reprised, and used for all subsequent models. Between 1913 and 1925, Veloce produced expensive, high-quality two-stroke motorcycles of (nominally) 250 cc, which gained an excellent reputation and were entered in competitions such as the Isle of Man TT, with some success. The single-cylinder machines had many advanced features, such as a throttle-controlled oil pump, which set them apart from other manufacturers&#x27; products. (The introduction of this device was claimed erroneously, much later, by Suzuki). The factory gradually developed this machine from the &quot;A&quot; series and variants (A, AC2 - coil ignition, two-speed gearbox, AC3 – three-speed gearbox, etc.), then the &quot;H&quot; series, the model U and variants, culminating in the model GTP in 1930, which was produced until 1946. The GTP was a reliable lightweight motorcycle with good steering and power delivery.

==Velocette &#x27;K&#x27; series==
In the early 1920s Veloce realised that, in order to grow as a company, it needed a new machine of advanced specification. It therefore developed an overhead camshaft (OHC) 350 cc engine, which became known as the &#x27;K&#x27; series and was introduced in 1925. After a year of teething troubles with this new design, Veloce entered slightly modified &#x27;K&#x27; models into racing events such as the Isle of Man TT and Brooklands races. The reliability and sweet running qualities of their new engine led to a long string of racing successes and the introduction of a production racing model, the KTT, built between 1928 and 1949. The 1929 KTT was the first production motorcycle to feature a positive-stop, foot-actuated gearchange. The roadster models developed from this initial model K were the Velocette KSS (super sports), KTS (touring sports), KTP (twin exhaust ports), KN (normal), and a few variations. A notable change in engine design was introduced in 1935, the &#x27;KSS Mk2&#x27; with a fully enclosed aluminium cylinder head. The OHC engine series continued for roadsters until 1948, when the final KSS Mk.2 versions were produced, with rigid frames and Dowty air-sprung telescopic forks. Accurate valve timing was accomplished through the pioneering use of stroboscopic lamps. The &#x27;K&#x27; series showed an excellent turn of speed and reliability and soon the factory developed racing models to compete in the Isle of Man TT.
==Velocette &#x27;M&#x27; series==

The K series was expensive to produce, requiring selective hand assembly of the shaft-and-bevel camshaft drive; it was determined that a simpler OHV design would be quicker to build and require less skilled labour to assemble and so the company decided to introduce a new line of overhead valve (OHV) machines, in order to cut production costs and make a more affordable motorcycle. The first of these new machines, in 1933, was the MOV, using a 250 cc engine of &#x27;square&#x27; dimensions (68 mm bore and 68 mm stroke). It was an immediate sales success, having lively performance for the time (), and proved a reliable machine with excellent road manners. From this machine, by lengthening the stroke of the crankshaft, the Velocette MAC 350 cc was introduced in 1934. It proved even more popular than the MOV, and became a real money spinner for the company, bringing much needed capital into the firm. In 1935 an entirely new machine was introduced, based on the two previous OHV models, the Velocette MSS of 500 cc. A new, heavier frame was fitted, with the intention that the machine could serve as a sidecar hauler. This new frame was developed from the MkV KTT racing machine, and was shared with the KSS MkII of 1936–1948. The MSS also proved very popular and profitable for Veloce. A 350 cc version of the MOV was the basis for the company&#x27;s World War II military motorcycles.

==Post war==

After the Second World War, the company sought to capture what it saw as a developing need for personal transport and created the LE model (for &quot;Little Engine&quot;). This was a 149 cc water-cooled flat-twin with side valves, a pressed steel frame, telescopic forks and a swingarm. Velocette&#x27;s Director, Eugene Goodman, planned an innovative and radical design that would appeal to a new market that needed cheap, clean and reliable transport. Designer Charles Udall developed the Velocette LE as a &quot;conceived-as-a-whole&quot; design, with engine, gearbox, drive shaft and bevel box in a single unit to do a specific job. It was sophisticated and expensive. It proved less successful than the firm had hoped and, although it became Veloce&#x27;s best selling model ever, the high tooling costs for this all-new machine were barely recouped.

It did see widespread adoption by British police forces for urban patrol. At the time Metropolitan Police Officers on foot patrol were required to salute inspectors. With the introduction of the motorcycle patrols this became dangerous, requiring the officer to take his hand off the handle bars, and so the rider was to allowed to show his respect with a smart nod. It has been suggested that this is how Velocette LEs became known as &quot;Noddy Bikes&quot;. However, Noddy (the popular cartoon character created by British children&#x27;s author Enid Blyton) who famously had frequent run-ins with the Policeman Mr. Plod, is also credited with being the origin.

The market for sporting machines was still strong, and Velocette continued to produce the 348cc KTT for racing. At the 1947 Isle of Man TT the company won the first four places in the Junior race. In 1949 they were the first FIM 350cc World Champions, a feat which they repeated in 1950. In 1967 Neil Kelly won the first Isle of Man Production TT in the 500cc class on a Velocette Thruxton, with another Thruxton in second place.

==Later models==
The 1954 499 cc Velocette MSS proved a successful export to the American desert racing scene, prompting the development of scrambler and enduro versions of the bike, the 349 cc Viper and 499 cc Venom, both introduced in 1956. A 1958 review in &quot;The Motor Cycle&quot;, an English weekly paper, called the Viper &quot;a remarkably fine motorcycle, all round performance well above the average&quot; and declared it capable of speeds over . In 1961 a Velocette Venom became the first motorcycle to cover over in a 24-hour period, at the banked, oval, Montlhery circuit in France with a team of eight riders including Veloce director Bertie Goodman and &#x27;MotorCycling&#x27; staff writer Bruce Main-Smith, averaging .
 This record for up to 500cc capacity machines still stands to the present day. The machine still exists; although badly damaged in the disastrous fire at the National Motorcycle Museum in Birmingham, it was restored by Velocette Owners Club president Ivan Rhodes with assistance from club members.
In 1960, Velocette introduced the Viceroy, a very unusual 250 cc opposed twin two-stroke scooter. Unique to the Viceroy was the front-mounted twin-cylinder engine, and the fuel tank mounted under the front legshield. The engine itself was extremely compact, and connected to the rear-mounted clutch and transmission by a drive shaft from the engine-mounted flywheel. With electric start, 12-volt electrics, a very low centre of gravity, power over and a reported comfortable cruising speed of , performance, handling and features of the Viceroy were first class. The scooter came as market forces and rider preferences were changing, and the Viceroy was not a sales success. The late 1960s were the last years of production for Velocette motorcycles, production for the Velocette Viper and Vogue ending in 1968, &quot;Special&quot;, Scrambler and Endurance in 1969, and MSS Venom and Velocette Thruxton in 1970. Veloce Ltd. closed in February 1971.

==Commercial failure==
The business had struggled since 1956, with government changes to hire purchase legislation and fuel rationing during the Suez Crisis. Major losses incurred on the Viceroy scooter development from 1956 to marketing in 1960, followed by costs incurred by overstocking of redundant parts and the loss of capital due to development costs invested in another new model doomed to failure – the Velocette Vogue, an updated LE with a full fibreglass touring body. Sales were quoted as &quot;a few hundred over five years&quot;, and development costs were never recovered either by Veloce or Avon, the bodywork manufacturer. All were key components in the financial decline.

The business commercially failed in the late 1960s, although profits from spare-part sales after the acquisition of the Royal Enfield spares operation in 1967 defrayed operational costs to such an extent that the company as a whole survived for another three years.

The workforce was sacked in February 1971, with C C Cooper, a local metals-recovery dealer, buying most of the machinery and continuing to produce limited spare parts by a small team of engineers. The rights to use the Velocette name and manufacture parts were then sold on to the Holder family, and the buildings at Hall Green were demolished.

Poissy is one of the oldest royal cities of Île-de-France, birthplace of Louis IX of France and Philip III of France, before being supplanted from the 15th century by Saint-Germain-en-Laye. In 1561, it was the site of a fruitless Catholic–Huguenot conference, the Colloquy of Poissy.

The area is known for hosting the Automobiles Gregoire successively, Matford, Ford SAF, Simca, Chrysler, Talbot factories and now hosts one of France&#x27;s largest Peugeot factories. The &quot;Simca Poissy engine&quot; was made there.

Poissy is the 165th most populated city in Metropolitan France.

==Location==
Poissy is located about 30 kilometres west of Paris, in the north-eastern part of the Yvelines, 8 kilometres west of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and 23 kilometres north-west of Versailles, the departmental prefecture.

The city is limited to the east by the forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and to the west by the Seine.

<doc id="605103" wikidata="Q2119376" url="?curid=605103" title="Fidelity">
<text>Fidelity is the quality of faithfulness or loyalty. Its original meaning regarded duty in a broader sense than the related concept of &quot;fealty&quot;. Both derive from the Latin word , meaning &quot;faithful or loyal&quot;. In the City of London financial markets it has traditionally been used in the sense encompassed in the motto &quot;my word is my bond&quot;.

== In moral philosophy ==
In moral philosophy, fidelity refers to a person who keeps agreements. Strong fidelity refers to a person who keeps agreements even if not mutually beneficial to the other person. 

== Audio and electronics==

In audio, &quot;fidelity&quot; denotes how accurately a copy reproduces its source. In the 1950s, the terms &quot;high fidelity&quot; or &quot;hi-fi&quot; were popularized for equipment and recordings which exhibited more accurate sound reproduction. For example, a worn gramophone record will have a lower fidelity than one in good condition, and a recording made by a low budget record company in the early 20th century is likely to have significantly less audio fidelity than a good modern recording. Similarly in electronics, fidelity refers to the correspondence of the output signal to the input signal, rather than sound quality, as in the popular internet connection technology &quot;Wi-Fi&quot;.

The term &quot;lo-fi&quot; has existed since at least the 1950s, shortly after the acceptance of &quot;hi-fi&quot;, but its definition evolved continuously between the 1970s and 2000s. In the 1976 edition of the &quot;Oxford Dictionary&quot;, lo-fi was added under the definition of &quot;sound production less good in quality than &#x27;hi-fi&#x27;&quot;, and in the glossary of the 1977 book &quot;The Tuning of the World&quot;, was defined as &quot;unfavourable signal-to-noise ratio&quot;. In 2003, the &quot;Oxford Dictionary&quot; added a second definition: &quot;A genre of rock music characterized by minimal production, giving a raw and unsophisticated sound.&quot; A third was added in 2008: &quot;Unpolished, amateurish, or technologically unsophisticated, esp. as a deliberate aesthetic choice.&quot;

== Scientific modelling and simulation==
In the fields of scientific modelling and simulation, fidelity refers to the degree to which a model or simulation reproduces the state and behaviour of a real world object, feature or condition. Fidelity is therefore a measure of the realism of a model or simulation. Simulation fidelity has also been described in the past as &quot;degree of similarity&quot;. In quantum mechanics and optics, the fidelity of a field is calculated as an overlap integral of the field of interest with a reference or target field.

==Program evaluation==
In the field of program evaluation, the term fidelity denotes how closely a set of procedures were implemented as they were supposed to have been. For example, it is difficult to draw conclusions from a study about formative assessment in school classrooms if the teachers are not able or willing to follow the procedures they received in training.

==Translation==
In translation, &quot;fidelity&quot; is the extent to which a translation accurately renders the meaning of the source text, without distortion. It is contrasted with &quot;transparency&quot;, which is the extent to which a translation appears to a native speaker of the target language to have originally been written in that language.

<text>A frugivore () is an animal that thrives mostly on raw fruits or succulent fruit-like produce of plants such as roots, shoots, nuts and seeds. Approximately 20% of mammalian herbivores eat fruit. Frugivores are highly dependent on the abundance and nutritional composition of fruits. Frugivores can benefit or hinder fruit-producing plants by either dispersing or destroying their seeds through digestion. When both the fruit-producing plant and the frugivore benefit by fruit-eating behavior the interaction is a form of mutualism.

==Frugivore seed dispersal==
Seed dispersal is important for plants because it allows their progeny to move away from their parents over time. The advantages of seed dispersal may have led to the evolution of fleshy fruits, which entice animals to consume them and move the plant&#x27;s seeds from place to place. While many fruit-producing plant species would not disperse far without frugivores, their seeds can usually germinate even if they fall to the ground directly below their parent.

Many types of animals are seed dispersers. Mammal and bird species represent the majority of seed-dispersing species. However, frugivorous tortoises, lizards, amphibians, and even fish also disperse seeds. For example, cassowaries are a keystone species because they spread fruit through digestion, many of the seeds of which will not grow unless they have been digested by the animal. While frugivores and fruit-producing plant species are present worldwide, there is some evidence that tropical forests have more frugivore seed dispersers than the temperate zones.

===Ecological significance===
Frugivore seed dispersal is a common phenomenon in many ecosystems. However, it is not a highly specific type of plant–animal interaction. For example, a single species of frugivorous bird may disperse fruits from several species of plants, or a few species of bird may disperse seeds of one plant species. This lack of specialization could be because fruit availability varies by season and year, which tends to discourage frugivore animals from focusing on just one plant species. Furthermore, different seed dispersers tend to disperse seeds to different habitats, at different abundances, and distances, depending on their behavior and numbers.

===Plant adaptations to attract dispersers===
There are a number of fruit characteristics that seem to be adaptive characteristics to attract frugivores. Animal-dispersed fruits may advertise their palatability to animals with bright colors and attractive smells (mimetic fruits). Fruit pulp is generally rich in water and carbohydrates and low in protein and lipids. However, the exact nutritional composition of fruits varies widely. The seeds of animal-dispersed fruits are often adapted to survive digestion by frugivores. For example, seeds can become more permeable to water after passage through an animal&#x27;s gut. This leads to higher germination rates. Some mistletoe seeds even germinate inside the disperser&#x27;s intestine.

==Frugivore adaptations for fruit consumption==
Many seed-dispersing animals have specialized digestive systems to process fruits, which leave seeds intact. Some bird species have shorter intestines to rapidly pass seeds from fruits, while some frugivorous bat species have longer intestines. Some seed-dispersing frugivores have short gut-retention times, and others can alter intestinal enzyme composition when eating different types of fruits.

==Plant mechanisms to delay or deter frugivory==
Since plants invest considerable energy into fruit production, many have evolved to encourage mutualist frugivores to consume their fruit for seed dispersal. Some have also evolved mechanisms to decrease consumption of fruits when unripe and from non-seed-dispersing predators. Predators and parasites of fruit include seed predators, insects, and microbial frugivores.

Plants have developed both chemical and physical adaptations:

Physical deterrents:
*Cryptic coloration (e.g. green fruits blend in with the plant leaves)
*Unpalatable textures (e.g. thick skins made of anti-nutritive substances)
*Resins and saps (e.g. prevent animals from swallowing)
*Repellent substances, hard outer coats, spines, thorns

Chemical deterrents:
*Chemical deterrents in plants are called secondary metabolites. Secondary metabolites are compounds produced by the plant that are not essential for the primary processes, such as growth and reproduction. Toxins might have evolved to prevent consumption by animals that disperse seeds into unsuitable habitats, to prevent too many fruits from being eaten per feeding bout by preventing too many seeds being deposited in one site, or to prevent digestion of the seeds in the gut of the animal. Secondary chemical defenses are divided into three categories: nitrogen-based, carbon-based terpenes, and carbon-based phenolics.

Examples of secondary chemical defenses in fruit:
*Capsaicin is a carbon-based phenolic compound only found in plant genus &quot;Capsicum&quot; (chili and bell peppers). Capsaicin is responsible for the pungent, hot &quot;flavor&quot; of peppers and inhibits growth of microbes and invertebrates.
*Cyanogenic glycosides are nitrogen-based compounds and are found in 130 plant families, but not necessarily in the fruit of all the plants. It is specifically found in the red berries of the genus &quot;Ilex&quot; (holly, an evergreen woody plant). It can inhibit electron transport, cellular respiration, induce vomiting, diarrhea, and mild narcosis in animals.
*Emodin is a carbon-based phenolic compound in plants like rhubarb. Emodin can be cathartic or act as a laxative in humans, kills dipteran larvae, inhibits growth of bacteria and fungi, and deters consumption by birds and mice.
* Starch is a polysaccharide that is slowly converted to fructose as the fruit ripens.

==Frugivorous animals==

=== Birds ===
Birds are a main focus of frugivory research. An article by Bette A. Loiselle and John G. Blake, &quot;Potential Consequences of Extinction of Frugivorous Birds for Shrubs of a Tropical Wet Forest&quot;, discusses the important role frugivorous birds have on ecosystems. The conclusions of their research indicate how the extinction of seed-dispersing species could negatively affect seed removal, seed viability, and plant establishment. The article highlights the importance that seed-dispersing birds have on the deposition of plant species.

Examples of seed-dispersing birds are the hornbill, the toucan, the aracari, the cotinga (ex. Guianan cock-of-the-rock), and some species of parrots. Frugivores are common in the temperate zone, but mostly found in the tropics. Many frugivorous birds feed mainly on fruits until nesting season, when they incorporate protein-rich insects into their diet. Facultatively-baccivorous birds may also eat bitter berries, such as juniper, in months when alternative foods are scarce. In North America, red mulberry (&quot;Morus rubra&quot;) fruits are widely sought after by birds in spring and early summer; as many as 31 species of birds were recorded visiting a fruiting tree in Arkansas.

Prior to 1980, most reports of avian frugivory were made in the tropics. From 1979–1981, a number of studies recognized the importance of fruits to fall temperate assemblages of passerine migrants. The earliest of these field studies were conducted in the fall of 1974 in upstate New York by Robert Rybczynski &amp; Donald K. Riker and separately by John W. Baird in New Jersey, each documenting ingestion of fruits in stands of fruit-bearing shrubs by mixed species assemblages dominated by migrant white-throated sparrows.

=== Mammals ===
Mammals are considered frugivorous if the seed is dispersed and able to establish. One example of a mammalian frugivore is the maned wolf, or &quot;Chrysocyon brachyurus&quot;, which is found in South America. A study by José Carlos Motta-Junior and Karina Martins found that the maned wolf is probably an important seed disperser. The researchers found that 22.5–54.3% of the diet was fruit.

65% of the diet of orangutans consists of fruit. Orangutans primarily eat fruit, along with young leaves, bark, flowers, honey, insects, and vines. One of their preferred foods is the fruit of the durian tree, which tastes somewhat like sweet custard. Orangutans discard the skin, eat the flesh, and spit out the seeds.

Other examples of mammalian frugivores include fruit bats and the gray-bellied night monkey, also known as the owl monkey:
&quot;Owl monkeys are frugivores and supplement their diet with flowers, insects, nectar, and leaves (Wright 1989; 1994). They prefer small, ripe fruit when available and in order to find these, they forage in large-crown trees (larger than ten meters [32.8 ft]) (Wright 1986). Seasonal availability of fruit varies across environments. Aotus species in tropical forests eat more fruit throughout the year because it is more readily available compared to the dry forests where fruit is limited in the dry season and owl monkeys are more dependent on leaves.&quot;

=== Fish ===
Some species of fish are frugivorous, such as the tambaqui.

==Conservation==
Since seed dispersal allows plant species to disperse to other areas, the loss of frugivores could change plant communities and lead to the local loss of particular plant species. Since frugivore seed dispersal is so important in the tropics, many researchers have studied the loss of frugivores and related it to changed plant population dynamics. Several studies have noted that even the loss of only large frugivores, such as monkeys, could have a negative effect, since they are responsible for certain types of long-distance seed dispersal that is not seen with other frugivore types, like birds. However, plant species whose seeds are dispersed by animals may be less vulnerable to fragmentation than other plant species. Frugivores can also benefit from the invasion of exotic fruit-producing species and can be vectors of exotic invasion by dispersing non-native seeds. Consequently, anthropogenic habitat loss and change may negatively affect some frugivore species but benefit others.

<text>Charles Ehresmann (19 April 1905 – 22 September 1979) was a German-born French mathematician who worked in differential topology and category theory.

He was an early member of the Bourbaki group, and is known for his work on the differential geometry of smooth fiber bundles, notably the introduction of the concepts of Ehresmann connection and of jet bundles, and for his seminar on category theory.

==Life==

Ehresmann was born in Strasbourg (at the time part of the German Empire) to an Alsatian-speaking family; his father was a gardener. After World War I, Alsace returned part of France and Ehresmann was taught in French at Lycée Kléber.

Between 1924 and 1927 he studied at the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris and obtained agrégation in mathematics. After one year of military service, in 1928-29 he taught at a French school in Rabat, Morocco. He studied further at the University of Göttingen during the years 1930–31, and at Princeton University in 1932–34.

He completed his PhD thesis entitled &quot;Sur la topologie de certains espaces homogènes&quot; (On the topology of certain homogeneous spaces) at ENS in 1934 under the supervision of Élie Cartan.

From 1935 to 1939 he was a researcher with the Centre national de la recherche scientifique and he contributed to the seminar of Gaston Julia, which was a forerunner of the Bourbaki seminar. In 1939 Ehresmann became a lecturer at the University of Strasbourg, but one year later the whole faculty was evacuated to Clermont-Ferrand due to the German occupation of France. When Germany withdrew in 1945, he returned to Strasbourg.

From 1955 he was Professor of Topology at Sorbonne, and after the reorganization of Parisian universities in 1969 he moved to Paris Diderot University (Paris 7).

Ehresmann was President of the Société Mathématique de France in 1965. He was awarded in 1940 the Prix Francoeur for young researchers in mathematics and in 1967 an honorary doctorate by the University of Bologna. He also held visiting chairs at Yale University, Princeton University, in Brazil (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro), Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Montreal, and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay.

After his retirement in 1975 and until 1978 he gave lectures at the University of Picardy at Amiens, where he moved because his second wife, Andrée Charles-Ehresmann, was a professor of mathematics there. He died at Amiens in 1979.

== Mathematical work ==

In the first part of his career Ehresmann introduced many new mathematical objects in differential geometry and topology, which gave rise to entire new fields, often developed later by his students.

In his first works he investigated the topology and homology of manifolds associated with classical Lie groups, such as Grassmann manifolds and other homogeneous spaces.

He developed the concept of fiber bundle, and the related notions of Ehresmann connection and solder form, building on the works by Herbert Seifert and Hassler Whitney in the 1930s. Norman Steenrod was working in the same direction from a topological point of view, but Ehresmann, influenced by Cartan&#x27;s ideas, was particularly interested in differentiable (smooth) fiber bundles, and in the differential-geometric aspects of these. This approach led him also to the notion of almost complex structure, which was introduced independently also by Heinz Hopf.

In order to obtain a more conceptual understanding of completely integrable systems of partial differential equations, in 1944 Ehresmann inaugurated the theory of foliations, which will be later developed by his student Georges Reeb. With the same perspective, he pioneered the notions of jet and of Lie groupoid.

Since the 1960s, Ehresmann&#x27;s research interests moved to category theory, where he introduced the concepts of sketch and of strict 2-category.

His collected works, edited by his wife, appeared in seven volumes in 1980–1983 (four volumes published by Imprimerie Evrard, Amiens, and the rest in the journal &quot;Cahiers de Topologie et Géométrie Différentielle Catégoriques&quot;, which he had founded in 1957). His publications include also the books &quot;Catégories et structures&quot; (Dunod, Paris, 1965) and &quot;Algèbre&quot; (1969).

Jean Dieudonné described Ehresmann&#x27;s personality as &quot;... distinguished by forthrightness, simplicity, and total absence of conceit or careerism. As a teacher he was outstanding, not so much for the brilliance of his lectures as for the inspiration and tireless guidance he generously gave to his research students ... &quot;

He had 76 PhD students, including Georges Reeb, Wu Wenjun (吴文俊), André Haefliger, Valentin Poénaru, and Daniel Tanré. His first student was Jacques Feldbau.

<doc id="605111" wikidata="Q216211" url="?curid=605111" title="Hypertrophy">
<text>Hypertrophy is the increase in the volume of an organ or tissue due to the enlargement of its component cells. It is distinguished from hyperplasia, in which the cells remain approximately the same size but increase in number. Although hypertrophy and hyperplasia are two distinct processes, they frequently occur together, such as in the case of the hormonally induced proliferation and enlargement of the cells of the uterus during pregnancy.

Eccentric hypertrophy is a type of hypertrophy where the walls and chamber of a hollow organ undergo growth in which the overall size and volume are enlarged. It is applied especially to the left ventricle of heart. Sarcomeres are added in series, as for example in dilated cardiomyopathy (in contrast to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a type of concentric hypertrophy, where sarcomeres are added in parallel).

<doc id="605113" wikidata="Q752674" url="?curid=605113" title="Tapajós">
<text>The Tapajós ( ) is a river in Brazil. It runs through the Amazon Rainforest and is a major tributary of the Amazon River. When combined with the Juruena River, the Tapajós is approximately long. It is one of the largest clearwater rivers, accounting for about 6% of the water in the Amazon basin.
== Course ==
For most of its length the Tapajós runs through Pará State, but the upper (southern) part forms the border between Pará and Amazonas State. The source is at the Juruena–Teles Pires river junction. The Tapajós River basin accounts for 6% of the water in the Amazon Basin, making it the fifth largest in the system.

From the lower Arinos River (a tributary of Juruena) to the Maranhão Grande falls are a more or less continuous series of formidable cataracts and rapids; but from the Maranhão Grande to the mouth of Tapajós, about , the river can be navigated by large vessels.

For its last it is between wide and much of it very deep. The valley of the Tapajós is bordered on both sides by bluffs. They are from high along the lower river; but a few miles above Santarém, they retire from the eastern side and do not approach the Amazon floodplain until some miles below Santarém.

== Geography ==
The eastern border of Amazônia National Park is formed by the Tapajós River. From Itaituba and southwest a part of the Parque Nacional do Jacaré Branco e Azulado and the follows the river, while a part of Parque Nacional do Mico Verde de Olhos Azuis runs parallel to the river from Santarém and south.

The South American pole of inaccessibility is located close to the sources of Tapajós&#x27;s tributaries, near Utiariti.

The Tapajós is named after the Tapajós people, an extinct group of indigenous people from Santarém.

== Ecology ==
The Tapajós is one of three major clearwater rivers in the Amazon Basin (the others are Xingu and Tocantins; the latter arguably outside the Amazon). Clearwater rivers share the low conductivity and relatively low levels of dissolved solids with blackwater rivers, but differ from these in having water that at most only is somewhat acidic (typical pH ~6.5) and very clear with a greenish colour. Although most of the tributaries in the Tapajós basin also are clearwater, there are exceptions, including the blackwater Braço Norte River (southeastern Serra do Cachimbo region). About 325 fish species are known from the Tapajós River basin, including 65 endemics. Many of these have only been discovered within the last decade, and a conservative estimate suggests more than 500 fish species eventually will be recognized in the river basin.

== Proposed dams ==

The fish, along with many other endemic species of flora and fauna are threatened by the Tapajós hydroelectric complex dams that are planned on the river. The largest of those projects is the São Luiz do Tapajós Dam, whose environmental licensing process has been suspended – not yet cancelled – by IBAMA due to its expected impacts on indigenous and river communities.
It would flood a part of the area of the Sawré Muybu Indigenous Territory.
Another is the planned 2,338 MW Jatobá Hydroelectric Power Plant.
A third dam, the controversial Chacorão Dam, would flood a large area of the Munduruku Indigenous Territory.

The dams are part of a plan to convert the Tapajos into a waterway for barges to take soybeans from Mato Grosso to the Amazon River ports.
A continuous chain of dams, with locks, would eliminate today&#x27;s rapids and waterfalls.
The Washington Post has referred to this issue as the next battle over saving the Amazon as a result of its controversy involving Indigenous communities, the Brazilian government, large multinationals and international environmental organizations.

== In popular culture ==
The river is the sixth title of the album &quot;Aguas da Amazonia&quot;.

<doc id="605116" wikidata="Q1396801" url="?curid=605116" title="L. Shankar">
<text>Shankar Lakshminarayana (born 26 April 1950), better known as L. Shankar, is an Indian violinist, singer and composer who also goes by the stage name Shenkar. Known for his innovative contributions to world music, he is often regarded as one of the pioneers of East-West fusion, blending the rich traditions of Indian classical with Western genres such as rock, pop, jazz, and electronic music. His extensive body of work spans a wide spectrum of genres, encompassing vocal and instrumental compositions. He has released 28 solo albums, the two latest being &quot;Full Moon&quot; and &quot;Over the Stars&quot;, which were released in September and August 2024, respectively. Shankar is credited with inventing the stereophonic Double violin(known as the LSD - L.Shankar Double Violin), which covers the orchestral string family&#x27;s range.

His world music albums with the band Shakti during the mid-70s became the ‘&quot;standard to gauge the playing and composing abilities of any world musician following in Shakti&#x27;s expansive wake&quot;”. According to Downbeat’s Critics Poll, he was listed fourth among Established Violinists, and came in second in the “Talent Deserving Wider Recognition” division in 1978. In 1990, Shankar&#x27;s talam-bending (time cycles of 9 3/4 &amp; 6 3/4 beats) Pancha Nadai Pallavi&quot;&#x27; &quot;album was on the Billboard top ten world music chart for three months becoming the first traditional Indian record to reach those heights. His 1995 Raga Abheri album was nominated for a Grammy Award, in the Best World Music Album category.

With Peter Gabriel, he worked on the Grammy winning album Passion (1989), the soundtrack album for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), and wrote and performed vocals on Mel Gibson&#x27;s &#x27;The Passion of the Christ&#x27; (2004) which won a Dove Award for Instrumental Album of the Year at the 36th GMA Dove Awards. He also worked on the soundtrack for the 2002 film Queen of the Damned with Jonathan Davis and Richard Gibbs and recorded eight songs of which five were picked for the movie. Additionally, he collaborated on the original score for NBC&#x27;s hit TV series Heroes with Wendy &amp; Lisa. Shankar is ranked amongst the greatest violinists of popular music by Digital Dream Door.

==Early life, family and education==
Shankar was born in Madras, India, on 26 April 1950 as the sixth child into a family of musicians. His three sisters studied vocal music whereas Shankar and his two brothers - Vaidyanathan and Subramaniam were trained in both vocal music as well as violin playing. His father V. Lakshminarayana was a renowned Carnatic vocalist and violinist and his mother L. Seetalakshmi was a trained singer and played the veena. Considered as a child prodigy, Shankar began vocal training with his father at the age of two. Within a year, he was able to hum complex lines of traditional Indian compositions. Having a vocal range of 5 1/2 octaves Shankar often emphasizes the importance of vocal training in addition to learning an instrument to better grasp the ornamentation in Indian music. He said, &quot;If you learn vocals and instruments and get an all-round education in music, it makes you a better performer&quot;. He received his first violin at the age of 5 and when he began playing the violin, the lines he practiced were vocal melodies he had learned. At the age of 7, he gave his first public concert during a festival at the Nallur Kandaswamy temple in Jaffna.

Apart from singing and playing the violin, he pursued professional mridangam playing until the age of 12. He said &quot;my father really insisted that besides learning your melodic instrument, you also learn percussion&quot;. However, he had to discontinue at his father&#x27;s suggestion when he began to develop calluses on his hands.

During the ethnic riots in 1958, their house was raided and set ablaze. The family fled Sri Lanka, leaving everything behind and returned to Madras, India. In that year, Shankar and his two older brothers formed the Violin Trio which &quot;made history in 20th century Carnatic music&quot; scene. 

Shankar gained considerable reputation across India in his early youth as an accompanist and filled in for some of the most eminent names in Carnatic music often performing solo concerts that lasted between two and three hours. By the age of 17, Shankar had become a highly sought-after violinist, performing regularly on national television and recorded several albums. His early success and his improvisational ingenuity is often credited to his consistent discipline and demanding practice routine for hours. He said &quot;father used to get up around 4:00 AM and wake us up. He&#x27;d practiced with us for an hour or more. We went to school at 7:30 but when we returned at 1:30 father was waiting for us with another lesson. After dinner we&#x27;d all get together and have a kind of jam session.” 

In spite of his early success as a musician, Shankar faced pressure from his family to have a fall back career as an engineer. He obtained a B.S. in physics from India and his father tried to acquire an engineering seat for him. Shankar, however, believed that music was his true calling. He even vowed to break 108 coconuts at the Luz Pillayar Temple in order not to secure admission and was delighted when the results favored him.

In 1969, he was offered a teaching position at Wesleyan University and moved to the US. He performed regularly on campus while pursuing a PhD in ethnomusicology, which he completed in 1974.

== Influences ==
Shankar was encouraged by his father to absorb influences from the Northern Indian music traditions as well as Southern Indian traditions. According to Shankar &quot;there is not one music that is superior to another – just different ways of expressing the beauty of our culture.” He was also advised to become familiar with Western classical music and had been exposed to various Western genres such as rock and pop music since his early teens. At Wesleyan University, he studied world music and learnt the music systems of different cultures. According to Shankar, “Music is universal, it connects all races, religions and ages. It&#x27;s the only language everyone can understand and feel”. Shankar had always been open to experimentation in music. He said that from a young age, he perceived music visually and often compared it to the colors in an artwork. He said “I’ve tried to combine different traditions…musical styles are like colors in painting: there are so many things you can do with them”.

== Cross-cultural Collaborations ==
Shankar was among the early pioneers in the 70s who introduced South Indian music to a Western audience that was more accustomed to North Indian music at that time. He often merged Carnatic &amp; Hindustani styles in his performances and collaborated with jazz musicians to bridge the gap between Eastern and Western music traditions. His early American recording sessions were on Archie Shepp&#x27;s &quot;Attica Blues&quot; and Clifford Thornton’s &quot;Communication Network&quot; in 1972. His understanding of the Western music system and having the “sensitivity, the control, the feeling, and the knowledge” of classical Indian enabled the representation of the East/West blend in music that led to the founding of the group Shakti with guitarist John McLaughlin. He taught McLaughlin ragas, rhythms and ornamentation and in turn learnt about harmony and jazz Shakti received overwhelming critical acclaim. According to Naresh of Man&#x27;s World magazine, Shankar&#x27;s compositions in Shakti, were praised for their innovativeness and “for how effortlessly they projected his very own voice.”

== Double Violin (LSD) ==

Since 1980, Shankar has been using the double violin - a 10-string, stereophonic double-necked electric violin - for all his performances and recordings which he designed and had it made by Ken Parker of Stuyvesant Sound in New York. The instrument made its debut in 1981 on Phil Collins&#x27; solo album, &quot;Face Value&quot;, as well as on Shankar&#x27;s own album, &quot;Who&#x27;s to Know.&quot; The concept for the double violin originated in 1978, after producing his album by Zappa Records where Shankar had to overdub a wide range of string instruments as he was unable to find session musicians who could render the Indian ornaments and styles he wanted. He made a prototype with cardboard and spent about a year and a half improving the design. According to Shankar, “It was not easy to get anyone to take my violin seriously until I crafted one myself putting it together piece by piece and then suddenly they responded”. He and Parker spent hours testing various materials and forms and he made sure that both necks were equally strong to avoid a tendency to predominantly play on only one. Also known as the LSD (L.Shankar&#x27;s Double violin), the lower neck covers the double bass and cello range and the upper neck generates treble sounds; the violin and viola. In addition to providing a wide range of 5 ½ octaves, playing on one neck produces a sympathetic effect on the other. The horizontal rib can be positioned beneath the chin or supported against the chest (Indian style) while playing.

Due to the instrument&#x27;s greater angle, the bowing was different and Shankar incorporated new techniques including playing on both necks simultaneously. According to him, “It’s musically more satisfying”. The double violin is capable of replicating a full orchestra&#x27;s effect, allowing for traditional classical performance as well as versatility in pop and jazz genres. Shankar stated that “I suppose what matters is not the violin but how you play it. Without that effort your violin will never learn to speak and [even] 20 strings will make no difference”. To date, Shankar has commissioned four different versions of the double violin, with the latest edition crafted by luthier John Jordan and released in 2023.

== Lakshminarayana World Music Festival ==

As a tribute to his late father, V. Lakshminarayana, Shankar initiated the Lakshminarayana World Music Festival in 1991 following his father&#x27;s death in 1990. The 1992 BBC film &quot;Bombay and All that Jazz,&quot; directed by H. O. Nazareth and co-produced by Shankar, was based on the tribute concert held in Bombay on New Year&#x27;s Day, January 1, 1992. It features performances by renowned musicians such as Don Cherry, TH Vinayakram, and Trilok Gurtu. The film was also nominated for best documentary at the Cannes Film Festival.
 Subsequently, L. Subramaniam and Viji Subramaniam launched a similar tribute concert called the Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival, with the first concert held in Madras (Chennai) on January 11, 1992.

==Career==

=== 1960s - 1975 Violin Trio ===
Shankar, along with his brothers L. Vaidyanathan and L. Subramaniam, pioneered the trend of sibling ensembles performing Carnatic music. Prior to that, Carnatic violin had been primarily a solo instrument or used as an accompaniment in vocal concerts. They began performing together as the &quot;Violin Trio&quot;. Although this approach was initially criticized by traditionalists, their music gained immense popularity in India and ultimately spread worldwide during the 1970s. They recorded several albums as the Violin Trio.

=== 1973 - 1984: Shakti &quot;(formerly known as Turiyananda Sangeet)&quot; ===
The original line-up, formed in 1973 consisted of Shankar on violin, John McLaughlin on guitar, R. Raghavan on mridangam, Mahalakshmi Eve McLaughlin (tamboura) and Tanima (shruti box). Before Shakti became known under this name, they were called Turiyananda Sangit, a name given to them by Sri Chinmoy, literally translated as &#x27;the pinnacle delight in music’ Zakir Hussain was later added on tabla and the name was changed to Shakti as the band members wanted a name that “listeners in the West could relate to” Raghavan didn&#x27;t stay with the project and TH Vikku Vinayakaram was added on ghatam for the remainder of those Shakti days. The group toured extensively, gaining international recognition by 1976, and were considered as the game-changers of Indo-jazz fusion. 

Shankar co-wrote all of the group&#x27;s material with John McLaughlin, resulting in the release of three world music albums under the CBS label: &quot;Shakti with John McLaughlin&quot; (1976), &quot;A Handful of Beauty&quot; (1976), &quot;and Natural Elements&quot; (1977). According to Lee Underwood, a &quot;DownBeat&quot; music magazine critic, &quot;All three are masterpieces, of which the deeply moving and technically astonishing &quot;Handful of Beauty&quot; will stand tall in recorded history for decades to come.” In 1978, Shankar was listed fourth among Established Violinists by Downbeat’s Critics Poll, and came in second in the TDWR (“Talent Deserving Wider Recognition”) division.

The group disbanded in 1978 and as Shankar put it, ‘I felt enough time wasn’t given to rehearsals and I wanted to do it right’. During this period, Shankar took on the role of playing the electric violin and toured alongside Frank Zappa, succeeding Jean-Luc Ponty in the position. The experience led to Zappa producing and contributing lyrics for his debut 1979 American solo album, &quot;Touch Me There.&quot; In 1979, Shankar briefly joined McLaughlin&#x27;s &quot;One Truth Band&quot;, which also included Fernando Saunders on bass, Stu Goldberg on keyboards, and Tony Smith on drums, to record the studio album, &quot;Electric Dreams.&quot;

Between 1982 - 1984, Shakti regrouped for a reunion tour in India, this time with Shankar performing on the double violin. In 1982, Larry Coryell filled in when McLaughlin had injured one of his playing fingers. 

Shakti regrouped again in 1997 under the name &quot;Remember Shakti&quot;. However, the new line-up excluded Shankar.

=== 1979: Touch Me There by Zappa Records ===

Shankar met Frank Zappa in 1978 while they were both working at a pop festival in Germany and during a casual jam session, Zappa extended an invitation for him to play with his band in New York. Following the dissolution of Shakti, Shankar toured briefly with Zappa, which resulted in him signing the violinist to his label. As per Zappa, “The reason I wanted to sign him is because I like the way he plays”. In 1979, they released &#x27;Touch Me There,&#x27; an album that featured Shankar&#x27;s electric five-string violin and vocals alongside guitarist Phil Palmer and drummer Simon Phillips. The album was produced in England, featuring a British rhythm section. Most of the compositions were Shankar&#x27;s, while Zappa handled the arrangements and wrote the lyrics that were included in the album. According to Zappa, “it&#x27;s got a lot of stuff that&#x27;s&#x27; definitely going to hit the radio right where it lives.” 

Initially, Shankar had entered into a 10-album deal with Zappa Records. However, a conflict between the distributors and Zappa led to the eventual termination of the agreement.

=== 1980 - 1985: Who’s To Know, Vision &amp; Song For Everyone ===

In the 1980s, Shankar released several albums under the ECM label, his first being &quot;Who’s To Know,&quot; featuring his double violin and accompanied by Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman on mridangam and Zakir Hussain on tabla. According to ECM reviewer, Tyran Grillo, the album “will ever remain an ECM jewel” owing to Shankar&#x27;s signature style and melodic sensibility. In 1984, Shankar released his second ECM album, ‘Vision’, accompanied by saxophonist Jan Garbarek and trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg. In an AllMusic review, Richard S. Ginell describes the album as &quot;an ethereal tour-de-force” that is reassuringly easy to listen to. According to J.D. Considine from The Washington Post, Shankar&#x27;s “solo recordings avoid entirely the excesses of fusion jazz” and instead, “pursue a plangent serenity… that suggests a transcendence unheard in jazz.” ‘Song for Everyone’ was released in 1985 and remains the most memorable among his ECM releases. According to Shankar, “It is a highlight that stays with me, the melodies keep coming up in my playing”.

=== 1986 - 1989: The Epidemics and other ventures ===

Between 1986 and 1989, Shankar released 3 albums: &quot;The Epidemics&quot; (1986), &quot;Do What You Do&quot; (1987), &amp; &quot;Eye Catcher&quot; (1989) under the pop/rock group The Epidemics ( previously known as Sadhu, after his pet rabbit) In 1987, the three former members of Shakti - Shankar, Zakir, and Vikku undertook a brief tour as Peshkar with Larry Coryell in Britain. Concurrently, Shankar joined SXL, a jazz fusion collective initiated in the same year by composer Bill Laswell. This ensemble featured a core group of musicians, including Aïyb Dieng, Ronald Shannon Jackson, along with South Korean percussion quartet, SamulNori. The performances, which took place on August 1 and 2, collectively attracted an audience of nearly 30,000. These events were preserved through live recordings with Sony releasing SXL Live in Japan (1987) and Celluloid Records presenting SXL Into the Outlands (1987).

=== 1990 - 1995: Classical solo albums &amp; Raga Aberi ===
Shankar released several Indian classical albums in the 1990s including &quot;Nobody Told Me&quot; (1990), &quot;Pancha Nadai Pallavi&quot; (1990), &quot;Soul Searcher&quot; (1990) and Raga Aberi (1995). His &quot;Pancha Nadai Pallavi&quot; peaked at No.9 on the Billboard top ten world music charts for three consecutive  months – making it the first traditional Indian record ever hit those charts. The album consists of two tracks, the first is the rendition of ragam “Sankarabharanam&quot; on the double violin and vocal  without percussion and the second accompanied by Zakir Hussain on tabla and Vikku Vinayakram on ghatam. According to ECM Reviewer, Tyron Grillo describes Shankar&#x27;s playing as “a language of the utmost depth and beauty” and that while traditionalists in the Carnatic music sphere may find Shankar&#x27;s modern touches unconventional, “the music soars in ways that far outsoar its criticism.” In 1995, Shankar released &quot;Raga Aberi&quot;, a rendition of ragam “Abheri”, featuring his original composition set in a 9 1/2 beat cycle. Within the same year, the album garnered a Grammy Award nomination in the &quot;Best World Music Album&quot; category.

=== 1995 - 2006: WOMAD &amp; Special projects ===
Shankar’s band collaborated in Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 1995 WOMAD shows in Spain and toured globally, performing in several humanitarian events including The Concert for Global Harmony, Fiddlefest (a benefit for the Harlem Center For Strings) and Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 80th Birthday celebrations. During this period, Shankar subsequently released the pop-oriented album &quot;One in a Million&quot; (2001) and the world music album &quot;Celestial Body&quot; (2004). Shankar wrote ‘Palaces&#x27; as a song dedicated to children worldwide. The song was performed in Peter Gabriel’s Secret World Tour and the second annual World Peace Music Awards in San Francisco&#x27;s Civic Center Plaza, to benefit all the orphans of war and terrorism. In September 2004, he received the World Peace Music Award and in that same year, he composed and performed vocals and played the double violin on Mel Gibson&#x27;s The Passion of the Christ, along with composers Jack Lenz and John Debney.

Shankar has also performed with Elton John, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Bruce Springsteen, Van Morrison, Yoko Ono, Stewart Copeland, John Waite, Charly García, Steve Vai, Ginger Baker, Nils Lofgren, Jonathan Davis and The SFA and Sting.

<text>Bidwell Mansion State Historic Park was a historic building with surrounding land in Chico, California, United States. It is listed as a California Historical Landmark #329 under the name &quot;Rancho Chico And Bidwell Adobe&quot; in 1939; and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the name &quot;Bidwell Mansion&quot; on March 24, 1972. On December 11, 2024, the building was destroyed by arson.

== History ==
Bidwell Mansion was the home of General John Bidwell and Annie Bidwell from late 1868 until 1900, when Gen. Bidwell died. Annie continued to live there until her death in 1918. John Bidwell began construction of the mansion on his 26,000 acres (110 km2) Rancho del Arroyo Chico in 1865, during his courtship of Annie Ellicott Kennedy. After their marriage in 1868, the three-story, 26-room Victorian house became the social and cultural center of the upper Sacramento Valley. The mansion was a $60,000 project, and was finished in May 1868.

When constructed, Bidwell Mansion featured modern plumbing, gas lighting and water systems. The three-story brick structure was built in an informally romantic version of the Italianate style. It also had aspects of the Italian Villa and Octagon house types present. The building&#x27;s exterior was finished with a pink tinted plaster.

From 1925 to 1935, Bidwell Mansion served as a dormitory for Chico State Teachers College female students. The mansion was later dubbed &quot;Bidwell Hall&quot; and housed the art and home economics departments.

The state of California acquired the site in 1964.

Some of the interior scenes from the film &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934) were shot inside the mansion.

=== Fire and destruction ===

In the early morning on December 11, 2024, a fire swept the mansion. It was reported that the top tower collapsed at 4:05 a.m. Arson was determined as the cause of the fire. The mansion had been closed for renovations since early 2024, with plans to reopen in March 2025. No injuries were reported.

<doc id="605120" wikidata="Q571598" url="?curid=605120" title="L. Subramaniam">
<text>Subramaniam Lakshminarayana (born 23 July 1947) is an Indian violinist, composer and conductor, trained in the classical Carnatic music tradition and Western classical music.

==Early years==
Subramaniam was born in Madras, Madras Presidency, British India, to V. Lakshminarayana Iyer and Seethalakshmi, both accomplished musicians.

He lived in Jaffna during his younger years, taking up music studies before the age of five. He began training in violin under the tutelage of his father, Professor V. Lakshminarayana. &quot;Mani&quot;, as he is fondly known by fellow musicians and his family, gave his first public performance at the age of six.

His uncles include Ramnad Raghavan and Ramnad Krishnan. His brothers are also acclaimed musicians, and include the violinist-composers L. Shankar (alias. Shenkar), and the late L. Vaidyanathan. He has released recordings with both.

Subramaniam developed a passion for music as well as science from a young age, studying Medicine and acquiring his M.B.B.S. at Madras Medical College. He registered as a General Practitioner, before deciding to pursue music full-time. He has a master&#x27;s degree in Western classical music, which he acquired at the California Institute of the Arts.

==Performing career==
Since 1973, Subramaniam has amassed over 200 recordings to his credit, releasing several solo albums, recording collaborations with musicians Yehudi Menuhin, Stéphane Grappelli, Ruggiero Ricci and Jean-Pierre Rampal, further to making albums and performing with Ruggiero Ricci, Herbie Hancock, Joe Sample, Jean-Luc Ponty, Stanley Clarke John Handy, George Harrison and several others.

He has accompanied highly regarded vocalists in Carnatic music on stage including Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, K. V. Narayanaswamy, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, M. Balamuralikrishna, M. D. Ramanathan, and Alathur Srinivasa Iyer. He has also performed many concerts with the venerable Palghat Mani Iyer on the Mridangam, in addition to collaborating with musicians of North Indian Hindustani music and artists of other music systems.

Subramaniam has written works for orchestras, ballets and Hollywood film scores, and written books on music – such as &quot;Euphony&quot; – in addition to composing symphonies and Carnatic pieces.

In 1983, he composed a &quot;Double Concerto for violin and flute&quot; which combined western scales with micro intervals. Another release, &quot;Spring – Rhapsody&quot;, was a homage to Bach and Baroque music. Creations with orchestras that have followed include &quot;Fantasy on Vedic Chants&quot; with the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra, conducted by Djemal Dalgat, &quot;Turbulence&quot; with The Swiss Romande Orchestra, &quot;The Concert of Two Violins&quot; with the Oslo Philharmonic, and &quot;Global Symphony&quot; with the Berlin State Opera (broadcast live to 28 nations) among others. He has also performed a concert tour of China, with the Beijing Symphony Orchestra in Beijing.

His compositions have been used in stage presentations of leading dance companies such as the San Jose Ballet company and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Subramaniam composed the piece &quot;Shanti Priya&quot; for the Mariinsky Ballet.

The release of his albums, including &quot;Global Fusion&quot; in 1999 have brought Subramaniam widespread critical acclaim, and popularity for his advanced playing. He founded and directs the Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival, a festival based in India. In 2004, he completed a world tour with the festival, including concerts in the US (Lincoln Center, New York), the Asian Pacific region including in Perth, Australia, at the Esplanade, Singapore, the Sri Dewan Penang Hall in Penang and the Putra World Trade Centre in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Performing with Subramaniam at the festival in January 2005 were violin maestro Arve Tellefsen, the Oslo Camerata, jazz legends Stanley Clarke, George Duke, Al Jarreau, Earl Klugh and Ravi Coltrane.

In September 2007, Subramaniam premiered and played &quot;The Freedom Symphony&quot; with the Fairfax Symphony Orchestra, Warrenton Chorale and Carnatic percussionists, which led to a strongly favourable ovation and an encore piece &quot;Flight of the Humble Bee&quot;. Subramaniam is on the advisory board of composer A. R. Rahman&#x27;s KM Music Conservatory in Kodambakkam, Chennai.

In 2011, he was invited to perform at the United Nations. On 24 October 2012, he performed as a Special Guest Artist with Stevie Wonder at the latter&#x27;s message of peace concert at the UN. Yehudi Menuhin said of Subramaniam:

When asked about his musical accomplishments, Subramaniam has always said, 

==Film career==
He composed the film scores for the films &quot;Salaam Bombay&quot; (1988) and &quot;Mississippi Masala&quot; (1991) directed by Mira Nair, in addition to being the featured violin soloist in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Little Buddha&quot; (1993) and &quot;Cotton Mary&quot; (1999) of Merchant-Ivory productions.

==Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival==


The Lakshminarayana World Music Festival concert was first initiated by his brother, L. Shankar in 1991 in memory of their father V. Lakshminarayana, who passed away in 1990. The BBC film &quot;‘Bombay and All That Jazz’&quot; &quot;(1992)&quot; was based on the tribute concert that took place in Bombay on New Year’s Day, January 1, 1992, which featured Don Cherry, L. Shankar, TH Vinayakram, Trilok Gurtu and many others.

Subsequently, on January 11, 1992, Vijayashree and Subramaniam launched the Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival (LGMF) in Madras (Chennai). 

Artists have included the Subramaniam family, Al Jarreau, George Duke, Solo Cissokho, Miya Masaoka, Mark O&#x27;Connor, Loyko, Jean-Luc Ponty, Ustad Bismillah Khan, Larry Coryell, Arve Tellefsen, Pandit Jasraj, Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna and Corky Siegel.

The festival has centred around special concepts such as Violins for Peace, Visions of India and Sounds of India.

In 2007, the Subramaniam Foundation, a charity run by Subramaniam and his wife set up a music school called the Subramaniam Academy of Performing Arts (SAPA), in Bangalore, India.

<text>The Theatre Royal Haymarket (also known as Haymarket Theatre or the Little Theatre) is a West End theatre on Haymarket in the City of Westminster which dates back to 1720, making it the third-oldest London playhouse still in use. Samuel Foote acquired the lease in 1747, and in 1766 he gained a royal patent to play legitimate drama (meaning spoken drama, as opposed to opera, concerts or plays with music) in the summer months. The original building was a little further north in the same street. It has been at its current location since 1821, when it was redesigned by John Nash. It is a Grade I listed building, with a seating capacity of 888. The freehold of the theatre is owned by the Crown Estate.

The Haymarket has been the site of a significant innovation in theatre. In 1873, it was the venue for the first scheduled matinée performance, establishing a custom soon followed in theatres everywhere. Its managers have included Benjamin Nottingham Webster, John Baldwin Buckstone, Squire Bancroft, Cyril Maude, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, and John Sleeper Clarke, brother-in-law of John Wilkes Booth, who quit America after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Famous actors who débuted at the theatre included Robert William Elliston (1774–1831) and John Liston (1776–1846).

==History of the theatre==

===Origins and early years===
The first Hay Market theatre was built in 1720 by John Potter, carpenter, on the site of &quot;The King&#x27;s Head Inn&quot; in the Haymarket and a shop in Suffolk Street kept by Isaac Bliburgh, a gunsmith, and known by the sign of the Cannon and Musket. It was the third public theatre opened in the West End. The theatre cost £1000 to build, with a further £500 expended on decorations, scenery and costumes. It opened on 29 December 1720, with a French play &quot;La Fille a la Morte, ou le Badeaut de Paris&quot; performed by a company later known as The French Comedians of His Grace the Duke of Montague. Potter&#x27;s speculation was known as &quot;The New French Theatre&quot;. Its name was changed to Little Theatre in the Hay.
The theatre&#x27;s first major success was a 1729 production of a play by Samuel Johnson of Cheshire, &quot;Hurlothrumbo, or The Supernatural&quot;, which ran for 30 nights – not as long as John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; (62 performances), but still a long run for the time. In 1730, the theatre was taken over by an English company. Among the actors who appeared there before 1737 when the theatre was closed under the Licensing Act 1737 were Aaron Hill, Theophilus Cibber, and Henry Fielding. In the eight to ten years before the Act was passed, the Haymarket was an alternative to John Rich&#x27;s Theatre Royal, Covent Garden and the opera-dominated Drury Lane Theatre. Fielding himself was responsible for the instigation of the Act, having produced a play called &quot;The Historical Register&quot; that parodied prime minister Robert Walpole, as the caricature, Quidam.

In particular, it was an alternative to the pantomime and special-effects dominated stages, and it presented opposition (Tory party) satire. Henry Fielding staged his plays at the Haymarket, and so did Henry Carey. &quot;Hurlothrumbo&quot; was just one of his plays in that series of anti-Walpolean satires, followed by &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;. Another, in 1734, was his mock-opera, &quot;The Dragon of Wantley&quot;, with music by John Frederick Lampe. This work punctured the vacuous operatic conventions and pointed a satirical barb at Walpole and his taxation policies. The piece was a huge success, with a record-setting run of 69 performances in its first season. The work debuted at the Haymarket Theatre, where its coded attack on Walpole would have been clear, but its long run occurred after it moved to Covent Garden, which had a much greater capacity for staging. The burlesque itself is very brief on the page, as it relied extensively on absurd theatrics, dances, and other non-textual entertainments. &quot;The Musical Entertainer&quot; from 1739 contains engravings showing how the staging was performed.

Carey continued with &quot;Pasquin&quot; and others. Additionally, refugees from Drury Lane&#x27;s and Covent Garden&#x27;s internal struggles would show up at the Haymarket, and thus Charlotte Charke would act there in a parody of her father, Colley Cibber, one of the owners and managers of Drury Lane. The Theatrical Licensing Act, however, put an end to the anti-ministry satires, and it all but entirely shut down the theatre. From 1741 to 1747, Charles Macklin, Cibber, Samuel Foote, and others sometimes produced plays there either by use of a temporary licence or by subterfuge; one advertisement runs, &quot;&quot;At Cibber&#x27;s Academy in the Haymarket, will be a Concert, after which, will be exhibited (gratis) a Rehearsal, in the form of a Play, called Romeo and Juliet&quot;.&quot;

In 1749 a hoaxer billed as The Bottle Conjuror was advertised to appear at the theatre. The conjuror&#x27;s publicity claimed that, while on stage, he would place his body inside an empty wine bottle, in full view of the audience. When the advertised act failed to appear on stage, the audience rioted and gutted the theatre. Although the identity of the hoax&#x27;s perpetrator is unknown, several authors consider John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, to have been responsible.

===London&#x27;s third patent theatre===
In 1754, John Potter, who had been rated (i.e. paid property tax) for the theatre since its opening, was succeeded by John Whitehead. In 1758 Theophilus Cibber obtained from William Howard, then the Lord Chamberlain, a general licence under which Foote tried to establish the Haymarket as a regular theatre. With the aid of the Duke of York he procured a royal licence to exhibit plays during four months in each year from May to September during his lifetime. He also bought the lease of the theatre from Potter&#x27;s executors and, having added to the site by purchasing adjoining property, he enlarged and improved the building which he opened on 14 May 1767, as the Theatre Royal, the third patent theatre in London. Several successful seasons followed, with Foote producing numerous plays at the theatre, but Foote finally got himself into difficulties by his custom of caricaturing well-known persons on the stage and this, combined with increasing ill-health, resulted in his selling both the theatre and patent to George Colman Sr. on 16 January 1777.

During the season of 1793–94 when Drury Lane Theatre was being rebuilt, the Haymarket was opened under the Drury Lane Patent. The season was notable for a &#x27;Dreadful Accident&#x27; which occurred on 3 February 1794, &#x27;when Twenty Persons unfortunately lost their lives, and a great Number were dreadfully bruised owing to a great Crowd pressing to see his Majesty, who was that Evening present at the Performance.&#x27; Amongst the dead were John Charles Brooke, Somerset Herald and Benjamin Pingo York Herald. Colman died in 1794, and the theatre descended to his son. George Colman Jr., though successful both as playwright and manager, dissipated his gains by his extravagance. For a time he lived in a room at the back of the theatre and he was finally forced to sell shares in the latter to his brother-in-law, David Morris. Monetary difficulties increased and for a while Colman managed the theatre from the King&#x27;s Bench Prison, where he was confined for debt.

All the buildings on the east of the Haymarket from the theatre southward were rebuilt circa 1820 in connection with John Nash&#x27;s schemes for the improvement of the neighbourhood. Nash persuaded the proprietors of the theatre to rebuild on a site a little south of the old one so that the portico should close the vista from Charles Street. The main front feature of Nash&#x27;s elevation in the Haymarket was (and is) a pedimented portico of six Corinthian columns which extends in depth to the edge of the pavement and includes the whole frontage. It is sometimes stated that Nash rebuilt the theatre entirely, but there is evidence that he incorporated a house in Little Suffolk Street with the theatre, removed two shops which were in front, in the Haymarket, built a portico, increased the number of avenues and added a second gallery to the existing auditorium.

A lease dated 10 June 1821, was granted to David Edward Morris. The theatre was opened on 4 July 1821, with &quot;The Rivals&quot;. Benjamin Nottingham Webster became the theatre&#x27;s manager from 1837 to 1853. He and his successor, John Baldwin Buckstone, established the theatre as a great comedy house, and the theatre hosted most of the great actors of the period. The illusionist Ching Lau Lauro performed here on 25 July 1827.

===The latter half of the 19th century===
In 1862, the theatre was host to a 400-night run of &quot;Our American Cousin&quot;, with Edward Sothern as Lord Dundreary. The play&#x27;s success brought the word &quot;dreary&quot; into common use. Robertson&#x27;s &quot;David Garrick&quot; was a hit in 1864, also with Sothern in the title role. Sothern also starred in H. J. Byron&#x27;s &quot;An English Gentleman&quot; at the theatre in 1871. W. S. Gilbert premiered seven of his plays at the Haymarket. The first was his early burlesque, &quot;Robinson Crusoe; or, The Injun Bride and the Injured Wife&quot; (1867, written with Byron, Tom Hood, H. S. Leigh and Arthur Sketchley). Gilbert followed this with a number of his blank verse &quot;fairy comedies&quot;, the first of which was &quot;The Palace of Truth&quot; (1870), produced by Buckstone. These starred William Hunter Kendal and his wife Madge Robertson Kendal and also included &quot;Pygmalion and Galatea&quot; (1871), and &quot;The Wicked World&quot; (1873). Gilbert also produced here his dramas, &quot;Charity&quot; (1874), &quot;Dan&#x27;l Druce, Blacksmith&quot; (1876), and his most famous play outside of his Savoy operas, &quot;Engaged&quot;, an 1877 farce. Buckstone&#x27;s ghost has reportedly often been seen at the theatre, particularly during comedies and &quot;when he appreciates things&quot; playing there. In 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that the actor Patrick Stewart saw the ghost standing in the wings during a performance of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; at the Haymarket. In May 1875, Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Zoo&quot; transferred to the Haymarket.
In 1879 the house was taken over by the Bancrofts, who re-opened the theatre with a revival of Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot;, followed by Victorien Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Odette&quot; (for which they engaged Madame Helena Modjeska) and &quot;Fedora&quot;, and Arthur Wing Pinero&#x27;s &quot;Lords and Commons&quot;, with other revivals of previous successes. The auditorium had been reconstructed, and the stage enclosed in a complete picture frame proscenium, the first in London. The abolition of the pit by the introduction of stalls seating divided by plain iron arms caused the opening night play, &quot;Money&quot;, on 31 January 1880, to be delayed for half an hour while the audience in the galleries expressed their anger. Mr. Bancroft, in the character of Sir Frederick Blount, vainly endeavoured to pacify them, until he bluntly asked whether the play should proceed and thus obtained silence. The Bancrofts gave up management of the theatre in 1885.

The next season opened in September 1885. Herbert Beerbohm Tree became manager of the theatre and, in 1887, transferred &quot;The Red Lamp&quot; there from the Comedy Theatre; by then he had installed electric light in the theatre. Under Tree&#x27;s management, Oscar Wilde premiered his comedy &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; in April 1893. In January 1895 Wilde&#x27;s &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; was first performed at the theatre. Tree&#x27;s next notable hit was George du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;Trilby&quot;, later in 1895. This ran for over 260 performances and made such profits that Tree was able to build Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre and establish RADA.

In 1896 Cyril Maude and Frederick Harrison became lessees, opening with &quot;Under the Red Robe&quot;, an adaptation of Stanley Wyman&#x27;s novel. In 1897 &quot;The Little Minister&quot; by J. M. Barrie ran for 320 performances.

===The 20th century===

====1900 to 1950====
The Haymarket&#x27;s managers Frederick Harrison (who was sole lessee) and Cyril Maude remained through the first year of the 20th century. In 1904, the auditorium was redesigned in Louis XVI style by C. Stanley Peach. The following year, Maude acquired the Playhouse Theatre by Charing Cross Station, leaving Harrison in sole control. In 1909, Herbert Trench produced Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;. Productions from then to the end of World War I included &quot;Bunty Pulls the Strings&quot; (1911), a Scottish comedy by Graham Moffat, which ran for 617 performances with Jimmy Finlayson in the lead; Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot; (1914); &quot;Elegant Edward&quot;, with Henry Daniell as P. C. Hodson (1915); &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Might&quot; (1916), a comedy by Leonard Huskinson and Christopher Sandeman, with Henry Daniell. and &quot;General Post&quot;, a comedy by J. E. Harold Terry, which opened on 14 March 1917 and ran for 532 performances, again with Daniell.
In 1920, J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Mary Rose&quot; had a run of 399 performances. Another long-running production was &quot;Yellow Sands,&quot; in which Ralph Richardson gave 610 performances in 1926–27. In 1926 Harrison died, and Horace Watson became the theatre&#x27;s General Manager. His presentations included 632 performances of &quot;The First Mrs Fraser&quot;, by St. John Ervine, starring Marie Tempest in 1929. In 1939, under Watson&#x27;s management, work began on excavating a stalls bar, but it was not completed until 1941 owing to the outbreak of World War II. Wartime presentations included the London premiere of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Design for Living&quot; (1939) and John Gielgud&#x27;s 1944–1945 repertory season of &quot;The Circle&quot; (Somerset Maugham), &quot;Love for Love&quot; (Congreve), &quot;Hamlet, A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;.

In 1940, Gielgud directed &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, with Michael Redgrave as Macheath. In 1943, two Coward plays, &quot;Present Laughter&quot; and &quot;This Happy Breed&quot;, alternated. They were followed in 1945 by Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; and in 1948 by Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; directed by Gielgud, starring Helen Hayes; and &quot;The Heiress&quot;, an adaptation of Henry James&#x27;s &quot;Washington Square&quot;, directed by Gielgud and starring Ralph Richardson and Peggy Ashcroft, who were succeeded by Godfrey Tearle and Wendy Hiller (1949–50).

====1950–80====
In 1951–52 &quot;Waters of the Moon&quot; by N. C. Hunter starred Sybil Thorndike, Edith Evans and Wendy Hiller. For the Coronation season in 1953, Coward gave a rare performance in a play not written by him, &quot;The Apple Cart&quot; by George Bernard Shaw, with Margaret Leighton as his co-star. To Coward, the Haymarket was &quot;the most perfect theatre in the world&quot;. In 1956, Stuart Watson, who had taken over management of the theatre from his father Horace, died and was succeeded by his son Anthony, and then his daughter-in-law Sylva Stuart Watson, who took over in 1963. Productions under the new management included &quot;Flowering Cherry&quot; by Robert Bolt (1957) starring Ralph Richardson and Celia Johnson; &quot;Ross&quot; by Terence Rattigan (1960) starring Alec Guinness; and John Gielgud&#x27;s production of &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (1962), with Ralph Richardson and Margaret Rutherford. In the 1960s, notable presentations included &quot;The Tulip Bee&quot; by N. C. Hunter starring Celia Johnson and John Clements and Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Ides of March&quot; directed by Gielgud (both 1963).

In 1971, Louis I. Michaels became the lessee of the theatre. Productions of the decade included a revival of Enid Bagnold&#x27;s &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot;, with Gladys Cooper (1971, which had played at the Haymarket in 1956–57); the long-running &quot;A Voyage Round My Father&quot; (John Mortimer) starring Alec Guinness, succeeded by Michael Redgrave (1971–72); and, in 1972, &quot;Crown Matrimonial&quot; by Royce Ryton, starring Wendy Hiller as Queen Mary. Later productions included a revival of &quot;On Approval&quot; (Frederick Lonsdale) with Geraldine McEwan and Edward Woodward (1975); &quot;The Circle&quot;, with Googie Withers and John McCallum (1976); &quot;Rosmersholm&quot; (Ibsen) with Claire Bloom and Daniel Massey (1977); &quot;The Millionairess&quot; (Shaw), with Penelope Keith; &quot;Waters of the Moon&quot; again, starring Hiller and Ingrid Bergman in her last stage role (both 1978); and Keith Michell and Susan Hampshire in &quot;The Crucifer of Blood&quot; (1979).

====1980–2000====
The theatre then presented &quot;Make and Break&quot; (Michael Frayn), with Leonard Rossiter and Prunella Scales (1980). The following year, Louis Michaels died, and the theatre passed to a company, Louis I Michaels Ltd, with President, Enid Chanelle and Chairman, Arnold M Crook, which continued to own the theatre for decades. They presented &quot;Overheard&quot;, by Peter Ustinov; and &quot;Virginia&quot;, with Maggie Smith (1981). In 1982, the Haymarket staged a repertory season including &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot;, starring Penelope Keith; &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot; (Shaw); &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (Chekhov); &quot;Rules of the Game&quot; (Luigi Pirandello); and &quot;Man and Superman&quot; (Shaw), starring Peter O&#x27;Toole. In 1983, productions included &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, starring Donald Sinden; &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; (Shaw), starring Rex Harrison; Ben Kingsley in a one-man show about Edmund Kean; &quot;A Patriot for Me&quot; (John Osborne); &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; (Chekhov); and &quot;The Sleeping Prince&quot; (Terence Rattigan).

Productions in 1984 were &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot; by Henry James, starring Christopher Reeve, Vanessa Redgrave and Wendy Hiller; &quot;Aren&#x27;t We All?&quot; (Frederick Lonsdale) starring Rex Harrison and Claudette Colbert; and &quot;The Way of the World&quot; (Congreve). In 1985, Lauren Bacall starred in &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (Tennessee Williams), followed by Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Old Times&quot;.

In 1990, the Haymarket revived &quot;London Assurance&quot; (Dion Boucicault) and presented &quot;An Evening with Peter Ustinov&quot;. The next year&#x27;s plays included Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Becket&quot;, starring Derek Jacobi and Robert Lindsay. Lindsay also starred in a revival of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; in 1992.

In 1994 the theatre closed for a £1.3 million refurbishment, re-opening later that year with a revival of &quot;An Evening with Peter Ustinov&quot;, followed by &quot;Arcadia&quot; (Tom Stoppard). &quot;Burning Blue&quot; (1995), a new play by the first time playwright David Greer, was followed by the veteran director Peter Hall&#x27;s revival of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Master Builder&quot;, starring Alan Bates. Hall also directed the 1996 &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (Oscar Wilde) 100 years after its première at the Haymarket; the new production featured Martin Shaw as Lord Goring. There is a memorial plaque to Wilde at the theatre.

Another production of 1996 was Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman. Hall was in charge again for the 1997 production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (Tennessee Williams), starring Jessica Lange; &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;; and &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (returning after touring). The last production of that year was &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; (Edward Albee), starring Eileen Atkins, Maggie Smith, John Standing and Annette Crosbie.

In 1998, &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Villains&quot; a one-man play, created and performed by Steven Berkoff at the theatre was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment. Later that year, Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;The Invention of Love&quot;, starring John Wood, transferred from the National Theatre.

For two years from March 2012, the Haymarket hosted the National Theatre production &quot;One Man, Two Guvnors&quot;, which transferred from the Adelphi Theatre. The theatre was one of the 40 theatres featured in the 2012 DVD documentary series &quot;Great West End Theatres&quot;, presented by Donald Sinden.

In 2017, Damian Lewis and Sophie Okonedo starred in Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?&quot; from March to June. The RSC then returned to the theatre with &quot;Queen Anne&quot;.

==Masterclass==
In 1998 the theatre founded Masterclass, a charity that offers creative opportunities and performing experiences to young people pursuing careers in the performing arts. Its activities include, in addition to masterclasses, apprenticeships in directing and theatre design, workshop productions, and theatre career fairs. The masterclasses cover a range of disciplines, from acting and directing to writing, producing and design, and give young people the chance to learn directly from leading practitioners working in theatre, film and television. As of 2012, more than 60,000 young people between the ages of 17 and 30 had participated in the masterclasses.

<doc id="605123" wikidata="Q858572" url="?curid=605123" title="Carlo Emilio Bonferroni">
<text>Carlo Emilio Bonferroni (28 January 1892 – 18 August 1960) was an Italian mathematician who worked on probability theory.

==Biography==
Bonferroni studied piano and conducting in Turin Conservatory and at University of Turin under Giuseppe Peano and Corrado Segre, where he obtained his laurea. During this time he also studied at University of Vienna and ETH Zurich. During World War I, he was an officer among the engineers. Bonferroni held a position as assistant professor at the Polytechnic University of Turin, and in 1923 took up the chair of financial mathematics at the Economics Institute of the University of Bari. In 1933 he transferred to University of Florence, where he held his chair until his death.

Bonferroni is best known for the Bonferroni inequalities (a generalization of the union bound), and for the Bonferroni correction in statistics (which he did not invent, but which is related to the Bonferroni inequalities).

==Parks==
===Liberty Triangle Park===

Liberty Rock is a boulder in Liberty Triangle park at the intersection of Farmers Blvd. and Liberty Ave.
 It was placed there in 1928 as a commemorative to the Pennsylvania Railroad casualties of World War One. Later, the plaque for that commemoration was removed and placed in an unknown location in the 1950s when the character of the neighborhood changed to predominantly African-american, co-incident with White flight.

The Liberty Rock became a symbol of the history and culture of the African American community in St. Albans. The painting of the rock in red, black, and green, the colors of the Pan-African flag, represents the community&#x27;s commitment to civil rights, group identity, and fostering ties between all people of African descent. The location of the rock, at the intersection of St. Albans, Hollis, and Jamaica, highlights its significance as a shared symbol for the entire community. The Liberty Rock serves as a symbol of resistance and resilience, reminding the community of its rich cultural heritage and ongoing struggle for equality and justice.
The Liberty Rock was originally erected as a World War I memorial in the late 1920s or early 1930s. It likely honored the soldiers who fought and died in the war. During his 1960 campaign JFK visited the &#x27;Rock&#x27; on a whistlestop tour of Queens. In the late 1960s, residents Cassia Campbell and Porscha Williams, reported that eleven year old Tony Tims and Daniel Gibson were the only people there initially when it was first painted; Tims claimed &quot;I used my father&#x27;s paint, met with Daniel. I would paint, he filmed it. I got the idea from a small rock that was painted Red, Black and Green in the square located at 122nd &amp; Farmers Blvd, That&#x27;s the real story.&quot; Tims painted the rock red, black, and green to symbolize the Black Power and Pan-African movements. This act of community activism was a way for the residents to express their cultural pride and reclaim their community, which was facing challenges such as poverty, crime, and neglect.

At the time, the Liberty Rock was located in a predominantly minority neighborhood and served as an eyesore and gathering place for winos across from a local liquor store. The residents decided to clean up the area, including the Liberty Rock, and paint it with the support of local businesses. The City of New York was initially opposed to the painted rock, but with the backing of the local store owners, the residents successfully challenged the city and kept the rock painted in the red, black, and green colors. However, the plaque honoring the war veterans was removed and placed elsewhere.

==Notable people==
Since the beginning of hip-hop, the neighborhood has been a hotbed of talent, sparked primarily by the fact that hip-hop producer and icon Russell Simmons is from this community, as is his brother Joseph, who along with his friends Darryl McDaniels and Jason Mizell formed the rap group Run-D.M.C. (who had a hit with the seasonal song &quot;Christmas in Hollis&quot;).

<text>Jedwabne (; , &quot;Yedvabna&quot;) is a town in northeastern Poland, in Łomża County of Podlaskie Voivodeship, with 1,942 inhabitants (2002).

==History==

First mentioned in 1455 records, on 17 July 1736 Jedwabne received town rights from King Augustus III of Poland, including the privilege of holding weekly Sunday markets and five country fairs a year. A wooden Catholic church with two steeples was built in 1737–1738, and a synagogue around 1770. The Jedwabne synagogue was a fine example of the unique Polish Jewish architectural tradition of wooden synagogues.

In the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, it was annexed by Kingdom of Prussia. In 1807, it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, and after the duchy&#x27;s dissolution in 1815, it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland.

At the end of the 18th century, new textile factories opened. In 1851 there were as many as 17 weaving establishments employing 36 workers in the town. In terms of its cloth production, Jedwabne was already the eleventh-largest manufacturing centre in Congress Poland. By 1862, 11 mechanical and 13 manual weaving machines had been installed at Jedwabne. The town&#x27;s cloth production fell into decline only after the January Uprising of 1863, due to Russian repression against Polish and Jewish entrepreneurs. The town was the center of a large Jewish community with a population in 1900 of 1,941.

Following World War I, Poland regained independence and control of the town.

In the early 20th century, many Jedwabne residents had emigrated to the United States. Landing and settling in New York City, they built the synagogue Congregation Anshe Yedwabne at 242 Henry Street on the Lower East Side.

===World War II===
In September 1939 following the Invasion of Poland at the start of World War II, Jedwabne was briefly occupied by German troops who deported some 300 men to forced labor camps prior to transferring the area to the Soviets.

====Soviet occupation====
Following the Soviet invasion of eastern Poland in fulfillment of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, between 1939 and 1941 the Soviet NKVD conducted anti-Polish repression. It was preceded by a successful Soviet attack against a Polish partisan unit stationed in the Kobielne Wilderness. In 1940 the town had 3,985 residents: 3,670 Poles, 250 Jews, and 65 Belarusians. The NKVD arrested a number of residents and their families and deported them to Siberia.

====German occupation====

On 23 June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, German troops reoccupied Jedwabne. Jewish refugees from Wizna and Radziłów, where on 7 July Jews were burned alive in a barn, took refuge in Jedwabne.

On 10 July 1941, the town&#x27;s Jews were forced to assemble in the town square; there is a general consensus that the violence was performed by Polish men supported by German troops. A group of perpetrators humiliated and killed some of the assembled Jews. Some 50 to 70 Jews were forced to tear down the Soviet-built statue of Lenin and place the pieces in a Polish farmer&#x27;s barn, after which they were beaten to death. The perpetrators men then marched the rest of the Jews into the barn and set it alight. Casualty estimates vary; a forensic investigation in 2002 set the number at 340 dead, while other estimates range as high as 2,000. Accounts differ as well as to the number of survivors of the massacre (between 125 and 302). Some 12 of the Polish perpetrators were convicted in 1949, receiving prison sentences of eight to fifteen years. However, it needs to be remembered that sentence was issued by occupational Soviet jurisdiction, who was keen into increasing Polish-Jewish tensions. Even more, because of the situation, there might not be a chance for a fair-trial.

Following the massacre, some of the surviving Jews were interned in the Jedwabne ghetto; one to three months later, the ghetto was dissolved and the inmates expelled to the Łomża Ghetto. From there, on 2 November 1942, they were transferred to the Zambrów transit camp; and from there, in January 1943, to the Auschwitz extermination camp. Some Jedwabne Jews managed to flee the ghetto liquidations, and some of them survived the war.

==Economy==
Jedwabne is the administrative and economic centre for the surrounding &quot;gmina&quot;, which has an agricultural character. It offers educational and healthcare services for the community, as well as administrative support, business infrastructure, and investment financing. The town is flanked by the Biebrza National Park, the biggest complex of natural marshes in Central Europe; it is inhabited by moose as well as other animals and bird species, attracting numerous tourists. The Biebrza river nearby is surrounded by campgrounds for fishing, hiking, and mountain biking. Agrotourism substantially contributes to the local economy, with prolonged tourist season beginning on March 1 and lasting until October 30 each year.

<text>Richard Dagobert Brauer (February 10, 1901 – April 17, 1977) was a German and American mathematician. He worked mainly in abstract algebra, but made important contributions to number theory. He was the founder of modular representation theory.

==Education and career==
Alfred Brauer was Richard&#x27;s brother and seven years older. They were born to a Jewish family. Both were interested in science and mathematics, but Alfred was injured in combat in World War I. As a boy, Richard dreamt of becoming an inventor, and in February 1919 enrolled in Technische Hochschule Berlin-Charlottenburg. He soon transferred to University of Berlin. Except for the summer of 1920 when he studied at University of Freiburg, he studied in Berlin, being awarded his PhD on 16 March 1926. Issai Schur conducted a seminar and posed a problem in 1921 that Alfred and Richard worked on together, and published a result. The problem also was solved by Heinz Hopf at the same time. Richard wrote his thesis under Schur, providing an algebraic approach to irreducible, continuous, finite-dimensional representations of real orthogonal (rotation) groups.

Ilse Karger also studied mathematics at the University of Berlin; she and Brauer were married 17 September 1925. Their sons George Ulrich (born 1927) and Fred Gunther (born 1932) also became mathematicians. Brauer began his teaching career in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) working as Konrad Knopp’s assistant. Brauer expounded central division algebras over a perfect field while in Königsberg; the isomorphism classes of such algebras form the elements of the Brauer group he introduced.

When the Nazi Party took over in 1933, the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars took action to help Brauer and other Jewish scientists. Brauer was offered an assistant professorship at University of Kentucky. Brauer accepted the offer, and by the end of 1933 he was in Lexington, Kentucky, teaching in English. Ilse followed the next year with George and Fred; brother Alfred made it to the United States in 1939, but their sister Alice was killed in the Holocaust.

Hermann Weyl invited Brauer to assist him at Princeton&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Study in 1934. Brauer and Nathan Jacobson edited Weyl&#x27;s lectures &quot;Structure and Representation of Continuous Groups&quot;. Through the influence of Emmy Noether, Brauer was invited to University of Toronto to take up a faculty position. With his graduate student Cecil J. Nesbitt he developed modular representation theory, published in 1937. Robert Steinberg, Stephen Arthur Jennings, and Ralph Stanton were also Brauer’s students in Toronto. Brauer also conducted international research with Tadasi Nakayama on representations of algebras. In 1941 University of Wisconsin hosted visiting professor Brauer. The following year he visited the Institute for Advanced Study and Bloomington, Indiana where Emil Artin was teaching.

In 1948, Brauer moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan where he and Robert M. Thrall contributed to the program in modern algebra at University of Michigan.

In 1952, Brauer joined the faculty of Harvard University and retired in 1971. His students included Donald John Lewis, Donald Passman, and I. Martin Isaacs. Brauer was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1954, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1955, and the American Philosophical Society in 1974. The Brauers frequently traveled to see their friends such as Reinhold Baer, Werner Wolfgang Rogosinski, and Carl Ludwig Siegel.

==Mathematical work==
Several theorems bear his name, including Brauer&#x27;s induction theorem, which has applications in number theory as well as finite group theory, and its corollary Brauer&#x27;s characterization of characters, which is central to the theory of group characters.

The Brauer–Fowler theorem, published in 1956, later provided significant impetus towards the classification of finite simple groups, for it implied that there could only be finitely many finite simple groups for which the centralizer of an involution (element of order 2) had a specified structure.

Brauer introduced the idea of &quot;resolvent degree&quot; in 1975. He applied modular representation theory to obtain subtle information about group characters, particularly via his three main theorems. These methods were particularly useful in the classification of finite simple groups with low rank Sylow 2-subgroups. The Brauer–Suzuki theorem showed that no finite simple group could have a generalized quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup, and the Alperin–Brauer–Gorenstein theorem classified finite groups with wreathed or quasidihedral Sylow 2-subgroups. The methods developed by Brauer were also instrumental in contributions by others to the classification program: for example, the Gorenstein–Walter theorem, classifying finite groups with a dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup, and Glauberman&#x27;s Z* theorem. The theory of a block with a cyclic defect group, first worked out by Brauer in the case when the principal block has defect group of order &quot;p&quot;, and later worked out in full generality by E. C. Dade, also had several applications to group theory, for example to finite groups of matrices over the complex numbers in small dimension. The Brauer tree is a combinatorial object associated to a block with cyclic defect group which encodes much information about the structure of the block.

Brauer formulated numerous influential problems on modular representation theory, among which the Brauer height zero conjecture and the k(B) conjecture.

In 1970, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.

==Hypercomplex numbers==
Eduard Study had written an article on hypercomplex numbers for Klein&#x27;s encyclopedia in 1898. This article was expanded for the French language edition by Henri Cartan in 1908. By the 1930s there was evident need to update Study’s article, and Brauer was commissioned to write on the topic for the project. As it turned out, when Brauer had his manuscript prepared in Toronto in 1936, though it was accepted for publication, politics and war intervened. Nevertheless, Brauer kept his manuscript through the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, and in 1979 it was published by Okayama University in Japan. It also appeared posthumously as paper #22 in the first volume of his &quot;Collected Papers&quot;. His title was &quot;Algebra der hyperkomplexen Zahlensysteme (Algebren)&quot;. Unlike the articles by Study and Cartan, which were exploratory, Brauer’s article reads as a modern abstract algebra text with its universal coverage. Consider his introduction:
:In the beginning of the 19th century, the usual complex numbers and their introduction through computations with number-pairs or points in the plane, became a general tool of mathematicians. Naturally the question arose whether or not a similar &quot;hypercomplex&quot; number can be defined using points of n-dimensional space. As it turns out, such extension of the system of real numbers requires the concession of some of the usual axioms (Weierstrass 1863). The selection of rules of computation, which cannot be avoided in hypercomplex numbers, naturally allows some choice. Yet in any cases set out, the resulting number systems allow a unique theory with regard to their structural properties and their classification. Further, one desires that these theories stand in close connection with other areas of mathematics, wherewith the possibility of their applications is given.

While still in Königsberg in 1929, Brauer published an article in Mathematische Zeitschrift &quot;Über Systeme hyperkomplexer Zahlen&quot; which was primarily concerned with integral domains (Nullteilerfrei systeme) and the field theory which he used later in Toronto.

<text>Faust is an opera in five acts by Charles Gounod to a French libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré from Carré&#x27;s play &quot;Faust et Marguerite&quot;, in turn loosely based on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust, Part One&quot;. It debuted at the Théâtre Lyrique on the Boulevard du Temple in Paris on 19 March 1859, with influential sets designed by Charles-Antoine Cambon and Joseph Thierry, Jean Émile Daran, Édouard Desplechin, and Philippe Chaperon.

==Performance history==

The original version of Faust employed spoken dialogue, and it was in this form that the work was first performed. The manager of the Théâtre Lyrique, Léon Carvalho cast his wife Caroline Miolan-Carvalho as Marguerite and there were various changes during production, including the removal and contraction of several numbers. The tenor Hector Gruyer was originally cast as Faust but was found to be inadequate during rehearsals, being eventually replaced by a principal of the Opéra-Comique, Joseph-Théodore-Désiré Barbot, shortly before the opening night.

After a successful initial run at the Théâtre Lyrique the publisher Antoine Choudens, who purchased the copyright for 10,000 francs, took the work (now with recitatives replacing the spoken dialogue) on tour through Germany, Belgium, Italy and England, with Caroline Miolan-Carvalho repeating her role.

Performances in Germany followed, with the Dresden Semperoper in 1861 being the first to bill the work as &quot;Margarethe&quot; rather than &quot;Faust&quot;. For many years this custom – or alternatively, staging the opera as &quot;Gretchen&quot; – continued in Germany. Some sources claim this was out of respect for part 1 of Goethe&#x27;s poetic drama, which the opera follows closely. Others claim the opposite: that the retitling was done to emphasise Gounod&#x27;s opera&#x27;s reliance on Goethe&#x27;s characters, and to differentiate it from Louis Spohr&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, which had held the stage for many years in Germany and had recently appeared (1851) in a three-act revision. It is also possible that the 1861 Dresden title change was out of respect for Spohr&#x27;s close and long association with the city.

The opera was given for the first time in Italy at La Scala in 1862 and in England at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, London (in Italian) in 1863. In 1864, when the opera was given at the same venue in English, Gounod took a theme from the prelude to the opera and wrote a new aria for the star baritone Charles Santley in the role of Valentin, &#x27;Even bravest heart may swell&#x27; (with words by Henry Chorley). This number was then translated into French for subsequent productions as &quot;Avant de quitter ces lieux&quot; and has become one of the most familiar pieces from the opera.

In 1869 a ballet had to be inserted (into the first scene of the final act) before the work could be played at the Opéra: it became the most frequently performed opera at that house. With the change from spoken dialogue to sung recitatives, plus the musical and balletic additions, the opera was thus finally transformed into a work following the conventions of grand opera.

It was &quot;Faust&quot; with which the Metropolitan Opera in New York City opened for the first time on 22 October 1883. It is the eighth most frequently performed opera there, with 753 performances through the 2012–2013 season. It was not until the period between 1965 and 1977 that the full version was performed (and then with some minor cuts), and all performances in that production included the &quot;Walpurgisnacht&quot; ballet.

Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; shows a scene from the opera at the beginning (duet Marguerite/Faust: “Il se fait tard! ... adieu!”, third act). 

A recording was made in 2018 of the 1859 version, by Les Talens Lyriques conducted by Christophe Rousset, which endeavoured to present the opera as first performed at the Théâtre Lyrique &quot;closer in kinship to the traditional opéra comique in its interleaving of musical numbers with spoken passages&quot;. The recording, produced by Bru Zane, featured Véronique Gens, Benjamin Bernheim and Andrew Foster-Williams in principal roles.

==Roles==

== Synopsis ==
:Place: Germany
:Time: 16th century

=== Act 1 ===
&quot;Faust&#x27;s cabinet&quot;
Faust, an aging scholar, determines that his studies have come to nothing and have only caused him to miss out on life and love (&quot;Rien! En vain j&#x27;interroge&quot;). He attempts to kill himself (twice) with poison but stops each time when he hears a choir. He curses hope and faith, and asks for infernal guidance. Méphistophélès appears (duet: &quot;Me voici&quot;) and, with a tempting image of Marguerite at her spinning wheel, persuades Faust to buy Méphistophélès&#x27;s services on Earth in exchange for Faust&#x27;s in Hell. Faust&#x27;s goblet of poison is magically transformed into an elixir of youth, making the aged doctor a handsome young gentleman; the strange companions then set out into the world.

=== Act 2 ===
&quot;At the city gates&quot;

A chorus of students, soldiers and villagers sings a drinking song (&quot;Vin ou Bière&quot;). Valentin, leaving for war with his friend Wagner, entrusts the care of his sister Marguerite to his youthful friend Siebel (&quot;O sainte médaille ... Avant de quitter ces lieux&quot;). Méphistophélès appears, provides the crowd with wine, and sings a rousing, irreverent song about the golden calf (&quot;Le veau d&#x27;or&quot;). Méphistophélès predicts Wagner will not return from the war and maligns Marguerite, and Valentin tries to strike him with his sword, which shatters in the air. Valentin and friends use the cross-shaped hilts of their swords to fend off what they now know is an infernal power (chorus: &quot;De l&#x27;enfer&quot;). Méphistophélès is joined by Faust and the villagers in a waltz (&quot;Ainsi que la brise légère&quot;). Marguerite appears and Faust declares his admiration, but she refuses Faust&#x27;s arm out of modesty, a quality that makes him love her even more.

=== Act 3 ===

&quot;Marguerite&#x27;s garden&quot;

The lovesick boy Siebel leaves a bouquet for Marguerite (&quot;Faites-lui mes aveux&quot;). Faust sends Méphistophélès in search of a gift for Marguerite and sings a cavatina (&quot;Salut, demeure chaste et pure&quot;) idealizing Marguerite as a pure child of nature. Méphistophélès brings in a decorated box containing exquisite jewelry and a hand mirror and leaves it on Marguerite&#x27;s doorstep, next to Siebel&#x27;s flowers. Marguerite enters, pondering her encounter with Faust at the city gates, and sings a melancholy ballad about the King of Thule (&quot;Il était un roi de Thulé&quot;). Marthe, Marguerite&#x27;s neighbour, notices the jewellery and says it must be from an admirer. Marguerite tries on the jewels and is captivated by how they enhance her beauty, as she sings in the famous aria, the Jewel Song (&quot;Oh dieu! Que de bijoux ... Ah! je ris de me voir si belle en ce miroir&quot;). Méphistophélès and Faust join the women in the garden and romance them. Marguerite allows Faust to kiss her (&quot;Laisse-moi, laisse-moi contempler ton visage&quot;), but then asks him to go away. She sings at her window for his quick return, and Faust, listening, returns to her. Under the watchful eye and malevolent laughter of Méphistophélès, it is clear that Faust&#x27;s seduction of Marguerite will be successful.

=== Act 4 ===
&quot;Marguerite&#x27;s room / A public square outside her house / A cathedral&quot;

[&quot;Note: The scenes of act 4 are sometimes given in a different order and portions are sometimes shortened or cut in performance.&quot;]
After being made pregnant and seemingly abandoned by Faust, Marguerite has given birth and is a social outcast. She sings an aria at her spinning wheel (&quot;Il ne revient pas&quot;). Siebel stands by her. The scene shifts to the square outside Marguerite&#x27;s house. Valentin&#x27;s company returns from the war to a military march (&quot;Déposons les armes&quot; and &quot;Gloire immortelle de nos aïeux&quot;, the well-known &quot;soldiers&#x27; chorus&quot;). Siebel asks Valentin to forgive Marguerite. Valentin rushes to her cottage. While he is inside Faust and Méphistophélès appear, and Méphistophélès, knowing that Marguerite is not in there alone, sings a mocking burlesque of a lover&#x27;s serenade under Marguerite&#x27;s window (&quot;Vous qui faites l&#x27;endormie&quot;). Valentin takes the bait and comes out of the cottage, now knowing that Faust has debauched his sister. The two men fight, but Faust is reluctant to hurt the brother of the woman he adores. Méphistophélès blocks Valentin&#x27;s sword, allowing Faust to make the fatal thrust. With his dying breath Valentin blames Marguerite for his death and condemns her to Hell before the assembled townspeople (&quot;Ecoute-moi bien Marguerite&quot;). Marguerite goes to the church and tries to pray there but is stopped, first by the sadistic Méphistophélès and then by a choir of devils. She finishes her prayer but faints when she is cursed again by Méphistophélès.

=== Act 5 ===
&quot;The Harz mountains on Walpurgis Night / A cavern / The interior of a prison&quot;

Méphistophélès and Faust are surrounded by witches (&quot;Un, deux et trois&quot;). Faust is transported to a cave of queens and courtesans, and Méphistophélès promises to provide Faust with the love of the greatest and most beautiful women in history. An orgiastic ballet suggests the revelry that continues throughout the night. As dawn approaches, Faust sees a vision of Marguerite and calls for her. Méphistophélès helps Faust enter the prison where Marguerite is being held for killing her child. They sing a love duet (&quot;Oui, c&#x27;est toi que j&#x27;aime&quot;). Méphistophélès states that only a mortal hand can deliver Marguerite from her fate, and Faust offers to rescue her from the hangman, but she prefers to trust her fate to God and His angels (&quot;Anges purs, anges radieux&quot;). At the end she asks why Faust&#x27;s hands are covered in blood, pushes him away, and falls down motionless. Méphistophélès curses, as a voice on high sings &quot;Sauvée!&quot; (&quot;Saved!&quot;). The bells of Easter sound and a chorus of angels sings &quot;Christ est ressuscité!&quot; (&#x27;&quot;Christ is risen!&quot;). The walls of the prison open, and Marguerite&#x27;s soul rises to heaven. In despair Faust follows it with his eyes; he falls to his knees and prays. Méphistophélès is turned away by the shining sword of the archangel.

== Ballet ==

Although the Walpurgisnacht ballet sequence from act 5 is usually omitted from modern staged performances of &quot;Faust&quot;, it is frequently performed separately as a concert work or part of a ballet program, e.g. George Balanchine&#x27;s &quot;Walpurgisnacht Ballet&quot;.

<text>Robert Daniel Carmichael (March 1, 1879 – May 2, 1967) was an American mathematician.

== Biography ==

Carmichael was born in Goodwater, Alabama. He attended Lineville College, briefly, and he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1898, while he was studying towards his Ph.D. degree at Princeton University. Carmichael completed the requirements for his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1911. Carmichael&#x27;s Ph.D. research in mathematics was done under the guidance of the noted American mathematician G. David Birkhoff, and it is considered to be the first significant American contribution to the knowledge of differential equations in mathematics.

Carmichael next taught at Indiana University from 1911 to 1915. Then he moved on to the University of Illinois, where he remained from 1915 until his retirement in 1947.

Carmichael is known for his research in what are now called the Carmichael numbers (a subset of Fermat pseudoprimes, numbers satisfying properties of primes described by Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem although they are not primes), Carmichael&#x27;s totient function conjecture, Carmichael&#x27;s theorem, and the Carmichael function, all significant in number theory and in the study of the prime numbers. He found the smallest Carmichael number, 561, and over 50 years later, it was proven that there are infinitely many of them. Carmichael also described the Steiner system S(5,8,24) in his 1931 paper &quot;Tactical Configurations of Rank 2&quot; and his 1937 book &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Groups of Finite Order&quot;, but the structure is often named after Ernst Witt, who rediscovered it in 1938.

While at Indiana University, Carmichael was involved with the special theory of relativity.

Carmichael&#x27;s younger brother was university administrator Oliver Carmichael.

<text>Ernesto Cesàro (12 March 1859 – 12 September 1906) was an Italian mathematician who worked in the field of differential geometry. He wrote a book, &quot;Lezioni di geometria intrinseca&quot; (Naples, 1890), on this topic, in which he also describes fractal, space-filling curves, partly covered by the larger class of de Rham curves, but are still known today in his honor as Cesàro curves. He is known also for his &#x27;averaging&#x27; method for the &#x27;Cesàro-summation&#x27; of divergent series, known as the Cesàro mean.

==Biography==

After a rather disappointing start of his academic career and a journey through Europe - with the most important stop at Liège, where his older brother Giuseppe Raimondo Pio Cesàro was teaching mineralogy at the local university - Ernesto Cesàro graduated from the University of Rome in 1887, while he was already part of the Royal Science Society of Belgium for the numerous works that he had already published.

The following year, he obtained a mathematics chair at the University of Palermo, which he kept until 1891. He settled in Rome, where he stayed as a professor at the Sapienza University until his accidental death, while trying to rescue his youngest son Manlio from drowning.

== Work ==

Cesàro&#x27;s main contributions are in the field of differential geometry. &quot;Lessons of intrinsic geometry&quot;, written in 1894, explains in particular the construction of a fractal curve. After that, Cesàro also studied the &quot;snowflake curve&quot; of von Koch, continuous but not differentiable in any of its points. 

Among his other works are &quot;Introduction to the mathematical theory of infinitesimal calculus&quot; (1893), &quot;Algebraic analysis&quot; (1894), &quot;Elements of infinitesimal calculus&quot; (1897). He proposed a possible definition of a limit of divergent sequence, known today as &quot;Cesàro&#x27;s sum,&quot; given by the limit of the mean of the sequence partial terms&#x27; sum.

<text>The year 1977 in science and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

== Astronomy and space exploration ==
* March 10 – Rings of Uranus discovered by Kuiper Airborne Observatory measurements of star occultation.
* August 12 – The NASA Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; makes its first test free-flight from the back of a jetliner.
* August 15 – Ohio State University Radio Observatory, working on the SETI project, receives a strong narrowband radio signal from deep space; the event is named the Wow! signal for a notation made by researcher Jerry R. Ehman.
* August 20 – Voyager program: The United States launches the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft.
* September 5 – Voyager program: &quot;Voyager 1&quot; is launched after a brief delay.
* September 20 – Petrozavodsk phenomenon observed in northern skies.
* 2060 Chiron, first of the outer Solar System asteroids known as Centaurs, discovered by Charlie Kowal.
* Discovery of the Carina Dwarf galaxy by the UK Schmidt Telescope.
* Thorne–Żytkow objects, a bizarre hybrid of red supergiants and neutron stars, are first theorised.

==Biology==
* The first complete genome is sequenced - a tiny bacterium-infecting virus called Phi X 174, with just 11 genes, and a little over 5000 base pairs.
* Carl Woese and George E. Fox classify archaea as a new, separate domain of life.
* U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves LAL (Limulus amebocyte lysate) for testing drugs, products and devices that come in contact with the blood. Prior to this date, a much slower and more expensive test on rabbits has been used for this purpose.
* October 22 – &quot;Nothomyrmecia&quot;, the &quot;dinosaur ant&quot;, is rediscovered, in Poochera, South Australia, more than 45 years after it is first described.

==Chemistry==
* Frederick Sanger and colleagues introduce Sanger sequencing.

==Computer science==
* January – The Commodore PET is announced at Winter CES. The first units are delivered to customers in October; back-orders for the popular system last for months and in early 1978 Commodore discontinues the 4KB model. The PET is the launch computer for Commodore which will later gain prominence with the Commodore 64 in 1982, the single most produced home computer with over 17 million produced.
* June 5 – The first Apple II home computers (largely designed by Steve Wozniak) go on sale in the U.S., among the first successful mass-produced microcomputers.
* August 3 – The TRS-80 Model I is announced at a press conference in New York City. Radio Shack begin sales in September, and despite a sales forecast of only 3,000 units per year, over 10,000 are sold in just one and a half months. Radio Shack will later develop an entire line of computers over the following 20 years.
* September – The Atari 2600 home video game console is released.

==Cryptography==
* RSA algorithm for public-key cryptography is described by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman at MIT.

==History of science==
* Roy Porter publishes &quot;The Making of Geology: Earth Science in Britain 1660-1815&quot;.
* Brian Randell and Allen Coombs publish the first detailed information on the 1943 Colossus computer.

==Mathematics==
* November – Graham&#x27;s number first becomes popularly known.
* Hillel Furstenberg reformulates Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem according to ergodic theory.
* Lajos Szilassi discovers the Szilassi polyhedron.
* Joel L. Weiner describes a version of the tennis ball theorem.

== Medicine ==
* January 18 – Scientists identify a previously unknown bacterium as the cause of the &quot;Legionnaires&#x27; disease&quot;.
* July 3 – Dr Raymond Damadian with Larry Minkoff and Michael Goldsmith perform the first magnetic resonance imaging body scan of a human.
* September 16 – The first percutaneous coronary intervention on a sentient patient is performed by cardiologist Andreas Gruentzig in Zurich.
* October 26 – The world&#x27;s last natural infection of smallpox is reported in Somalia.
* December 16 – The first microelectronic multi-channel cochlear implant, developed by Ingeborg Hochmair and Erwin Hochmair, is implanted.

== Oceanography ==
* February 7 – Discovery of deep ocean hydrothermal vent ecosystems near the Galapagos Islands.

== Physics ==
* The bottom quark is discovered experimentally by Leon M. Lederman at Fermilab.
* Steven Weinberg publishes the first edition of &quot;The First Three Minutes: A Modern View of the Origin of the Universe&quot; in the United States.

== Technology ==
* August 23 – Gossamer Condor demonstrates that it is the first human-powered aircraft capable of controlled and sustained flight by winning the Kremer prize. It was created by Paul MacCready and Peter Lissaman of AeroVironment and piloted by Bryan Allen at Minter Field in Shafter, California.
* December 1 – Lockheed &quot;Have Blue&quot; becomes the first stealth aircraft to fly.
* First general exercise sports bra invented by Lisa Lindahl and Polly Smith in the United States.

== Awards ==
* Nobel Prizes
** Physics – Philip Warren Anderson, Sir Nevill Francis Mott, John Hasbrouck van Vleck
** Chemistry – Ilya Prigogine
** Medicine – Roger Guillemin, Andrew V. Schally, Rosalyn Yalow
* Turing Award – John Backus

== Births ==
* May 3 – Maryam Mirzakhani (d. 2017), Iranian-born mathematician.

== Deaths ==
* February 16 – Rózsa Péter (b. 1905), Hungarian mathematician, &quot;founding mother of recursive function theory&quot;.
* June 3 – Archibald Hill (b. 1886), English physiologist, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
* June 16 – Wernher von Braun (b. 1912), German-born American physicist and engineer.

<text>Elwin Bruno Christoffel (; 10 November 1829 – 15 March 1900) was a German mathematician and physicist. He introduced fundamental concepts of differential geometry, opening the way for the development of tensor calculus, which would later provide the mathematical basis for general relativity.

==Life==

Christoffel was born on 10 November 1829 in Montjoie (now Monschau) in Prussia in a family of cloth merchants. He was initially educated at home in languages and mathematics, then attended the Jesuit Gymnasium and the Friedrich-Wilhelms Gymnasium in Cologne. In 1850 he went to the University of Berlin, where he studied mathematics with Gustav Dirichlet (which had a strong influence over him) among others, as well as attending courses in physics and chemistry. He received his doctorate in Berlin in 1856 for a thesis on the motion of electricity in homogeneous bodies written under the supervision of Martin Ohm, Ernst Kummer and Heinrich Gustav Magnus.

After receiving his doctorate, Christoffel returned to Montjoie where he spent the following three years in isolation from the academic community. However, he continued to study mathematics (especially mathematical physics) from books by Bernhard Riemann, Dirichlet and Augustin-Louis Cauchy. He also continued his research, publishing two papers in differential geometry.

In 1859 Christoffel returned to Berlin, earning his habilitation and becoming a Privatdozent at the University of Berlin. In 1862 he was appointed to a chair at the Polytechnic School in Zürich left vacant by Dedekind. He organised a new institute of mathematics at the young institution (it had been established only seven years earlier) that was highly appreciated. He also continued to publish research, and in 1868 he was elected a corresponding member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and of the Istituto Lombardo in Milan. In 1869 Christoffel returned to Berlin as a professor at the Gewerbeakademie (now part of Technische Universität Berlin), with Hermann Schwarz succeeding him in Zürich. However, strong competition from the close proximity to the University of Berlin meant that the Gewerbeakademie could not attract enough students to sustain advanced mathematical courses and Christoffel left Berlin again after three years.

In 1872 Christoffel became a professor at the University of Strasbourg, a centuries-old institution that was being reorganized into a modern university after Prussia&#x27;s annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in the Franco-Prussian War. Christoffel, together with his colleague Theodor Reye, built a reputable mathematics department at Strasbourg. He continued to publish research and had several doctoral students including Rikitaro Fujisawa, Ludwig Maurer and Paul Epstein. Christoffel retired from the University of Strasbourg in 1894, being succeeded by Heinrich Weber. After retirement he continued to work and publish, with the last treatise finished just before his death and published posthumously.

Christoffel died on 15 March 1900 in Strasbourg. He never married and left no family.

==Work==

===Differential geometry===

Christoffel is mainly remembered for his seminal contributions to differential geometry. In a famous 1869 paper on the equivalence problem for differential forms in &quot;n&quot; variables, published in Crelle&#x27;s Journal, he introduced the fundamental technique later called covariant differentiation and used it to define the Riemann–Christoffel tensor (the most common method used to express the curvature of Riemannian manifolds). In the same paper he introduced the Christoffel symbols formula_1 and formula_2 which express the components of the Levi-Civita connection with respect to a system of local coordinates. Christoffel&#x27;s ideas were generalized and greatly developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and his student Tullio Levi-Civita, who turned them into the concept of tensors and the absolute differential calculus. The absolute differential calculus, later named tensor calculus, forms the mathematical basis of the general theory of relativity.

===Complex analysis===

Christoffel contributed to complex analysis, where the Schwarz–Christoffel mapping is the first nontrivial constructive application of the Riemann mapping theorem. The Schwarz–Christoffel mapping has many applications to the theory of elliptic functions and to areas of physics. In the field of elliptic functions he also published results concerning abelian integrals and theta functions.

===Numerical analysis===

Christoffel generalized the Gaussian quadrature method for integration and, in connection to this, he also introduced the Christoffel–Darboux formula for Legendre polynomials (he later also published the formula for general orthogonal polynomials).

===Other research===
Christoffel also worked on potential theory and the theory of differential equations, however much of his research in these areas went unnoticed. He published two papers on the propagation of discontinuities in the solutions of partial differential equations which represent pioneering work in the theory of shock waves. He also studied physics and published research in optics, however his contributions here quickly lost their utility with the abandonment of the concept of the luminiferous aether.

==Honours==
Christoffel was elected as a corresponding member of several academies:
* Prussian Academy of Sciences (1868)
* Istituto Lombardo (1868)
* Göttingen Academy of Sciences (1869)

Christoffel was also awarded two distinctions for his activity by the Kingdom of Prussia:
* Order of the Red Eagle 3rd Class with bow (&quot;Schleife&quot;) (1893)
* Order of the Crown 2nd Class (1895)

==Selected publications==
* 
* 2 volumes, edited by Ludwig Maurer with the assistance of Adolf Krazer and Georg Faber; Erster Band, Zweiter Band. (Service Commun de Documentation de l&#x27;Université Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg)

<text>A simple polygon that is not convex is called concave, non-convex or reentrant. A concave polygon will always have at least one reflex interior angle—that is, an angle with a measure that is between 180 degrees and 360 degrees exclusive.

==Polygon==
Some lines containing interior points of a concave polygon intersect its boundary at more than two points. Some diagonals of a concave polygon lie partly or wholly outside the polygon. Some sidelines of a concave polygon fail to divide the plane into two half-planes one of which entirely contains the polygon. None of these three statements holds for a convex polygon.

As with any simple polygon, the sum of the internal angles of a concave polygon is ×(&quot;n&quot; − 2) radians, equivalently 180×(&quot;n&quot; − 2) degrees (°), where &quot;n&quot; is the number of sides.

It is always possible to partition a concave polygon into a set of convex polygons. A polynomial-time algorithm for finding a decomposition into as few convex polygons as possible is described by .

A triangle can never be concave, but there exist concave polygons with &quot;n&quot; sides for any &quot;n&quot; &gt; 3. An example of a concave quadrilateral is the dart.

At least one interior angle does not contain all other vertices in its edges and interior.

The convex hull of the concave polygon&#x27;s vertices, and that of its edges, contains points that are exterior to the polygon.

<text>The year 1975 in science and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

==Astronomy and space exploration==
* April 19 – Aryabhata, India&#x27;s first satellite, is launched using Soviet boosters.
* July 17 – Apollo–Soyuz Test Project: An American Apollo and a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft dock with each other in orbit marking the first such link-up between spacecraft from the two nations.
* August 20 – Viking program: NASA launches the &quot;Viking 1&quot; planetary probe toward Mars.

==Biology==
* August 7 – César Milstein and Georges Köhler report their discovery of how to use hybridoma cells to isolate monoclonal antibodies, effectively beginning the history of monoclonal antibody use in science.
* Living specimens of the Chacoan Peccary (&quot;Catagonus wagneri&quot;), previously known only from fossils, are identified in Paraguay.

==Climatology==
* August 8 – The term &quot;global warming&quot; is probably first used in its modern sense by Wallace Smith Broecker.

==Computer science==
* January – Altair 8800 is released, sparking the era of the microcomputer.
* March 5 – Hackers in Silicon Valley hold the first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club.
* April 4 – Bill Gates and Paul Allen form a company at this time called Micro-Soft in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to develop and sell their Altair BASIC interpreter software for the Altair 8800.
* The MOS Technology 6502 is introduced. An 8-bit microprocessor designed by a small team led by Chuck Peddle for MOS Technology, it is, by a considerable margin, the least expensive full-featured microprocessor on the market.

==Mathematics==
* Benoit Mandelbrot coins the term &quot;fractal&quot;.
* The Harada–Norton group is discovered.
* John N. Mather and Richard McGehee prove that for the Newtonian collinear four-body problem there exist solutions which become unbounded in a finite time interval.
* The Monty Hall problem in probability is first posed, by Steve Selvin.

==Medicine==
* October 16 – The last naturally occurring case of smallpox is diagnosed and treated, the victim being two-year-old Rahima Banu in Bangladesh.
* Lyme disease first recognised at Lyme, Connecticut.
* Mini–mental state examination (MMSE) or Folstein test introduced to screen for dementia or other cognitive dysfunction.

==Technology==
* Steven Sasson of Eastman Kodak in the United States produces the first self-contained (portable) digital camera.

==Awards==
* Nobel Prizes
** Physics – Aage Bohr, Ben Roy Mottelson, James Rainwater
** Chemistry – John Warcup Cornforth, Vladimir Prelog
** Medicine – David Baltimore, Renato Dulbecco, Howard Martin Temin
* Turing Award – Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon

==Births==
* July 11 – Naomi McClure-Griffiths, American-born astrophysicist.
* July 17 – Terence Tao, Australian-born mathematician.
* November 14 – Martin Hairer, Swiss-born Austrian-British mathematician.
* Catherine A. Lozupone, American microbiologist.

==Deaths==
* February 8 – Sir Robert Robinson b. 1886), British chemist, Nobel Prize laureate
* February 10 – Elizabeth Kozlova (b. 1892), Russian ornithologist 
* February 14 – Sir Julian Huxley (b. 1887), English biologist and author.
* April 19 – Percy Lavon Julian (b. 1899), African American research chemist.
* May 14 – Ernst Alexanderson (b. 1878), Swedish American television pioneer.
* May 18 – Christopher Strachey (b. 1916), English computer scientist.
* June 8 – Douglas Guthrie (b. 1885), Scottish otolaryngologist and medical historian.
* June 27 – Sir Geoffrey Taylor (b. 1886), English physicist.
* September 5 – Alice Catherine Evans (b. 1881), American microbiologist.
* October 10 – August Dvorak (b. 1894), American educational psychologist.
* October 23 – Gordon Hamilton Fairley (b. 1930), British oncologist.
* November – Priscilla Fairfield Bok (b. 1896), American astronomer.
* November 19 – Tokushichi Mishima (b. 1893), Japanese inventor and metallurgist.
* December 13 – Mary Locke Petermann (b. 1908), American cellular biochemist.
* December 28 – Frances McConnell-Mills (b. 1900), American toxicologist.

<doc id="605177" wikidata="Q1332346" url="?curid=605177" title="Mark Todd (equestrian)">
<text>Sir Mark James Todd (born 1 March 1956) is a New Zealand horseman noted for his accomplishments in the discipline of eventing, voted Rider of the 20th century by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports.
He won gold medals at Los Angeles (1984) and Seoul (1988) Olympics, the Badminton Horse Trials on four occasions, the Burghley Horse Trials five times, and as a member of New Zealand&#x27;s Eventing team, he won gold medals at the World Championships in 1990 and 1998 (Rome), plus 20 or more other international events, and numerous other international individual and team titles.

In 1988, he was announced as the New Zealand Sportsperson of the year and winner of the Supreme Halberg Award. In the same year, he was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame.

On 25 April 2011, Todd completed a fourth Badminton victory riding NZB Land Vision, becoming the oldest winner of the event.

By winning his fifth Olympic medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Todd equalled the Olympic record established by Hungarian fencer Aladár Gerevich for the longest gap between first and last Olympic medals — 28 years — and shares the record for second-most Olympic medals won by a New Zealander with canoeists Ian Ferguson and Paul MacDonald. The 2016 Games were Todd&#x27;s seventh, having previously competed in 1984, 1988, 1992, 2000, 2008 and 2012. Todd is the first New Zealander to have competed at seven Olympic Games.

In February 2022, a video emerged of Todd repeatedly hitting a horse with a branch for refusing to enter a water obstacle at a training clinic.

==Early life==
Born in Cambridge, New Zealand, he developed a deep and abiding passion for horses. He rode at pony club as a youngster and competed at local shows.

Todd considered becoming a jockey but quickly grew to 6 ft 2 in which forced him into show jumping instead. In reference to his riding skills, fellow New Zealand team member, Andrew Nicholson, is quoted as saying &quot;Mark can ride anything – he could go cross-country on a dairy cow!”

On leaving school Todd pursued a career as a farmer, gaining a Diploma of Agriculture at the Waikato Technical Institute, and working on farms while fitting in riding, competing and selling horses.

==Equestrian career==

In 1978, he was part of New Zealand&#x27;s first three-day eventing team to contest a world championship, at Lexington, Kentucky, United States. He was 10th after the dressage and second in the steeplechase, but then his horse, Tophunter, broke down during the cross-country stage. Thereafter, Todd moved to England, where he mucked out stables and obtained use of horses for event rides. At his first attempt, in 1980, he won the Badminton Horse Trials riding Southern Comfort. Todd was a virtual unknown when he arrived, with fellow New Zealander Andrew Nicholson as his groom.

Todd is recognized as a pioneer of three-day eventing in New Zealand. His success was followed by fellow New Zealand Olympic medallists and world champions Tinks Pottinger, Blyth Tait, Vaughn Jefferis, Vicky Latta, Sally Clark and Nicholson. Jefferis once said: &quot;We all owe a huge debt to Mark Todd. He was the first, and he paved the way for us&quot;.

=== Career ===
Todd became a popular sportsman in his home country and some of the horses he rode also became well-known. Most notable was Charisma, the Thoroughbred (with 1/16 Percheron) Todd rode when winning successive Olympic gold medals in 1984 and 1988. Charisma was retired to a Waikato farm after the Seoul Olympics but appeared with Todd for later public appearances including flag bearing at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland New Zealand. Charisma died aged 30 from a broken shoulder.

In 1984 Todd borrowed a yard at Kington St Michael, Wiltshire, from his friend Charles Cottenham, so that he could base himself in England.

In the 1985 New Year Honours, Todd was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, and he was elevated to Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1995 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

Todd also competed at the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics, where he won an individual bronze medal. His win was somewhat clouded by allegations in the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; that Todd had used cocaine with a homosexual partner prior to final team selection. The controversy was a matter of national debate, and almost cost Todd his team selection.

=== Retirement ===
Todd retired from international competition following the Olympics and returned to live in New Zealand. Todd and his family moved to Rivermonte Farm near his home town of Cambridge in Waikato to breed horses and concentrate on several business ventures, including the manufacture/retail of harness and other tack. His Thoroughbreds enjoyed racing success, including wins in the Wellington Cup and New Zealand Oaks. He remained closely involved with the administration of the eventing, acting as coach for the NZ Olympic Eventing team at Athens in 2004. He continued to compete in eventing at a local level and to support the sport in general.

=== Comeback ===
On 25 January 2008, &quot;Horse &amp; Hound&quot; announced online that Mark Todd was to make a return to Eventing eight years after he retired in Sydney. He purchased a 10-year-old grey called Gandalf to campaign for selection to ride at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His comeback was sponsored by New Zealand Bloodstock. 

On 19 May 2008, Todd placed sixth at a three-day equestrian event in Saumur, France. Subsequently, achieving qualification and selection for the Olympics, he put up one of the best performances of the NZ team, in what was only his eighth competition in eight years. At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, the New Zealand team finished fifth, and Todd placed 17th individually.

Following Beijing, Todd competed for the inaugural Express Eventing International Cup on Gandalf. However, three refusals in the show jumping portion resulted in a poor placing. In February 2009, Todd announced that he was making a full return to elite level eventing, basing himself in England with a team of up to 8 horses including Gandalf.

Competing at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Todd became the second oldest New Zealand Olympian in history.

In the 2013 New Year Honours, Todd was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to equestrian sport. His investiture at Buckingham Palace in May 2013 took place only days after the death of his father, Norm.

Todd got selected to represent New Zealand at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Once again he became the second oldest New Zealand Olympian in history, as the fellow equestrian Julie Brougham made her Olympic debut at the age of 62. At the Games held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Todd finished 4th in the team competition and 7th individually. Todd was the last team member to compete in the jumping phase, however, he dropped four rails. As a result, New Zealand team missed out on a possible gold medal. Todd later described this outcome as one of the biggest lows of his career.

=== Viral video ===
In February 2022, a two-year old video emerged of Todd hitting a horse with a tree branch at a training clinic. The horse had refused to enter a water obstacle, and Todd hit it ten times. Todd issued an apology after the video was published. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) announced it was carrying out an investigation. In the interim, Todd was issued with a temporary suspension of his licence. Todd stepped down as a patron of the charity World Horse Welfare. Todd&#x27;s training licence was returned to him on 14 April 2022 after an independent disciplinary panel issued him with a four month suspension with two months deferred, which meant that he had already served the eight-week suspension.

==Partial CCI 5* Results==

==Partial International Championship results==

== Personal life ==
Todd married Carolyn Berry in 1986 and had two children, Lauren and James. They separated in 2009. The couple remarried in 2014, with only their children present as witnesses.

Todd&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;So Far, So Good&quot;, was published in 1998. He has had several other books published including &quot;Charisma&quot; (1989), &quot;One Day Eventing&quot;, &quot;Mark Todd’s Cross-Country Handbook&quot; (1995) and &quot;Novice Eventing with Mark Todd&quot; (1996). He has also produced a series of training videos.

<doc id="605189" wikidata="Q2597728" url="?curid=605189" title="Culture of Niger">
<text>The culture of [[Niger]] is marked by variation, evidence of the cultural crossroads which French colonialism formed into a unified state from the beginning of the 20th century. What is now Niger was created from four distinct cultural areas in the pre-colonial era: the Djerma dominated Niger River valley in the southwest; the northern periphery of Hausaland, made mostly of those states which had resisted the Sokoto Caliphate, and ranged along the long southern border with Nigeria; the Lake Chad basin and Kaouar in the far east, populated by Kanuri farmers and Toubou pastoralists who had once been part of the Kanem-Bornu Empire; and the Tuareg nomads of the Aïr Mountains and Saharan desert in the vast north. Each of these communities, along with smaller ethnic groups like the pastoral Wodaabe Fula, brought their own cultural traditions to the new state of Niger.

In religion, Islam, spread from North Africa beginning in the 10th century, has greatly shaped the mores of the people of Niger. Since Independence, greater interest has been in the country&#x27;s cultural heritage, particularly with respect to traditional architecture, hand crafts, dances and music.

Music of Niger includes the guitar music of the Tuaregs of Agadez as performed by Group Inerane, Group Bombino and others.

== National culture ==

While successive post-BA governments have tried to forge a shared national culture, this has been slow forming, in part because the major Nigerien communities have their own cultural histories, and in part because Nigerian ethnic groups such as the Hausa, Tuareg and Kanuri are but part of larger ethnic communities which cross borders introduced under colonialism. Until the 1990s, government and politics was inordinately dominated by Niamey and the Djerma people of the surrounding region. The French had promoted Djerma royalty under their rule. After having first placed their capital in the powerful pre-colonial Hausa state at Zinder, the French moved their administration to what was a small village at Niamey, in part from fear of pan-Hausa power or British imperial designs on southern Niger. This governmental focus on the southwest continued after independence, with political representation reverting to a tiny traditional and educated elite. Despite this, only the Tuareg and Toubou pastoralists in the sparsely populated north and east have generated movements for autonomy, culminating in rebellions in 1963, the 1990s, and 2007. Islam, practiced by almost the entire population forms an important link between Nigerien communities, as does a shared post-independence history, national symbols, and festivals.

== Arts ==
=== Festivals ===
== Religion ==

Islam is the dominant religion in Niger, and is practiced by more than 99% of the population. Approximately 95% of Muslims are Sunni; 5% are Shi&#x27;a. There are small Christian, Baháʼí, and Animist communities, the first largely a remnant of French colonial influence. Animist beliefs include both animist based festivals and traditions (such as the Bori cult), practiced by some syncretic Muslim communities, as opposed to several small communities who maintain their pre-Islamic religion. These include the Hausa speaking Maouri/Azna community in Dogondoutci in the south-southwest, the Kanuri speaking Manga near Zinder, and some tiny Boudouma and Songhay communities in the southwest.

While French has been the cross cultural language of choice since independence, there are eight other official languages spoken in Niger, which include Hausa, Zarma/Songhai, Tamajeq, Fulfulde, Kanuri, Arabic, Gurmantche, and Toubou. &quot;Hausa&quot;, which almost half the population speak, has come to rival French as most used across communities.

==Literature== 
== Cuisine ==
== Sport ==

While traditional sports like horse racing, camel racing, and &quot;sorro wrestling&quot; survive, world sports like football dominate in urban areas. In the 1972 Summer Olympics, boxer Issake Dabore won a bronze medal, and Niger has sent athletes to all Summer Olympic Games held since 1964, except for 1976 and 1980.

<text>:&quot;The moth genus &quot;Dryopteris&quot; is now considered a junior synonym of &quot;Oreta.
Dryopteris , commonly called the wood ferns, male ferns (referring in particular to &quot;Dryopteris filix-mas&quot;), or buckler ferns, is a fern genus in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). There are about 300-400 species in the genus. The species are distributed in Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest diversity in eastern Asia. It is placed in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds. The sori are round, with a peltate indusium. The stipes have prominent scales.

Hybridization and polyploidy are well-known phenomena in this group, with many species formed via these processes. The North American &quot;Dryopteris&quot; hybrid complex is a well-known example of speciation via allopolyploid hybridization.

==Selected species==
The genus has a large number of species. The PPG I classification suggested there were about 400 species; , the &quot;Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World&quot; listed 328 species and 83 hybrids. Some genera sunk into &quot;Dryopteris&quot;, such as &quot;Dryopsis&quot;, &quot;Stenolepia&quot; and &quot;Nothoperanema&quot;, are distinguished by other sources.

==Ecology==
&quot;Dryopteris&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Batrachedra sophroniella&quot; (which feeds exclusively on &quot;D. cyatheoides&quot;) and &quot;Sthenopiseauratus&quot;.

==Cultivation and uses==
Many &quot;Dryopteris&quot; species are widely used as garden ornamental plants, especially &quot;D. affinis&quot;, &quot;D. erythrosora&quot;, and &quot;D. filix-mas&quot;, with numerous cultivars.

&quot;Dryopteris filix-mas&quot; was throughout much of recent human history widely used as a vermifuge, and was the only fern listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia.
Traditional use in Scandinavia against red mite (&quot;Dermanyssus gallinae&quot;) infestation is to place fronds in nesting boxes under nesting material and under floor covering material.

<text>My Own Private Idaho is a 1991 American independent adventure drama film written and directed by Gus Van Sant, loosely based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, and &quot;Henry V&quot;. The story follows two friends, Mike Waters and Scott Favor, played by River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves respectively, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon, to Mike&#x27;s hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike&#x27;s mother.

&quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews from critics, including Roger Ebert and those of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over $8 million, above its estimated budget of $2.5 million. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards, and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics.

&quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; is considered a landmark film in New Queer Cinema, an early 1990s movement in queer-themed independent filmmaking. Since its release, it has grown in popularity and been deemed a cult classic, especially among LGBT audiences. The film is notable for its then-taboo subject matter and avant-garde style.

In 2024, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Mike, a street hustler, stands alone on a deserted stretch of highway. He starts talking to himself and notices that the road looks &quot;like someone&#x27;s face, like a fucked-up face&quot;. He then experiences a narcoleptic episode and dreams of his mother comforting him as home movies of his childhood play in his mind.

Later, after receiving fellatio from a client in Seattle, Mike returns to his favorite spots to pick up clients. He is picked up by a wealthy older woman who takes him to her mansion, where he finds two fellow hustlers she has also hired. One of them is Scott Favor, Mike&#x27;s best friend, and the other is Gary. While preparing to have sex with the woman, Mike has another narcoleptic episode and awakens the next day with Scott in Portland, Oregon.

Mike and Scott are soon reunited with Bob Pigeon, a middle-aged mentor to a gang of street kids and hustlers who live in an abandoned apartment building. Scott, the son of the mayor of Portland, confides in Bob that when he turns 21, he will inherit his father&#x27;s fortune and retire from street hustling. Meanwhile, Mike yearns to find his mother, so he and Scott leave for Idaho to visit Mike&#x27;s older brother, Richard. Along this journey, Mike confesses to Scott that he is in love with him, and Scott gently reminds Mike he only sleeps with men for money. Richard tells a story of a man he claims is Mike&#x27;s father, but Mike insists that he knows it is Richard. Richard informs Mike that their mother works as a hotel maid; when Mike and Scott visit her workplace, they learn she went to Italy in search of her own family. At the hotel, they meet Hans, the man who drove them to Portland, and prostitute themselves to him.

With the money they receive from Hans, Mike and Scott travel to Italy. They find the country farmhouse where Mike&#x27;s mother worked as a maid and English tutor. Carmela, a young woman who lives there, tells Mike that his mother returned to the United States months earlier. Carmela and Scott fall in love and return to the US, leaving a brokenhearted Mike to return on his own. Scott&#x27;s father dies, and Scott inherits his fortune.

Back in Portland, Bob and his gang confront a reformed Scott at an upscale restaurant, but he rejects them. That night, Bob has a fatal heart attack. The next day, the hustlers hold a rowdy funeral for Bob, while in the same cemetery, a few yards away, Scott attends a solemn funeral for his father.

Finally, Mike is back on the deserted stretch of Idaho highway. After he falls into another narcoleptic stupor, two strangers pull up in a truck, take his backpack and shoes, and drive away. Moments later, an unidentified figure pulls up in a car, picks the unconscious Mike up, places him in the vehicle, and drives away.

==Development==
&quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; originated from John Rechy&#x27;s 1963 novel &quot;City of Night&quot;, which featured street hustlers who did not admit to being gay. Van Sant&#x27;s original screenplay was written in the 1970s, when he was living in Hollywood. After reading Rechy&#x27;s book, Van Sant felt it was considerably better than what he was writing, and shelved the script for years. In 1988, while editing &quot;Mala Noche&quot;, Van Sant met street kid Michael Parker, who inspired the character of Mike in &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;. Parker also had a friend named Scott, a street kid like himself. In the script, Van Sant made the Scott character a rich kid, also fashioned after street hustlers Van Sant had met in Portland.

Early drafts of the screenplay were set on Hollywood Boulevard, not Portland, with working titles such as &quot;Blue Funk&quot; and &quot;Minions of the Moon&quot;. Rechy&#x27;s novel inspired Van Sant to change the setting to Portland. The script originally consisted of two separate scenarios: the first, titled &quot;Modern Days&quot;, recounted Mike&#x27;s story; the second updated the &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays with Scott&#x27;s story. Van Sant realized he could blend the two stories together in the manner of William S. Burroughs&#x27; &quot;cut up&quot; technique. In essence, this method involves various story fragments and ideas mixed and matched together to form a unique story. The idea to combine the two scenarios occurred to Van Sant after seeing Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot;. He has said, &quot;I thought that the &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays were really a street story. I also knew this fat guy named Bob, who had always reminded me of Falstaff and who was crazy about hustler boys&quot;. Van Sant realized that Prince Hal in the plays resembled Scott and the sidekick was Mike. His script ended up as a restructuring of the &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays. Van Sant got the idea for Mike&#x27;s narcolepsy from a man who was a guide of sorts when the director was gathering material for the film and who always looked like he was about to fall asleep. The film&#x27;s title is derived from the song &quot;Private Idaho&quot; by the B-52&#x27;s that Van Sant heard while visiting the state in the early 1980s.

Van Sant showed the script to a 20th Century Fox executive who liked Shakespeare. Eventually, he toned down the Shakespearean elements and modernized the language. Van Sant was also working on a &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; short story that he intended to film. Twenty-five pages long, it concerned two Latino characters on the Portland streets who go in search of their parents and travel to a town in Spain. One falls in love with a girl and leaves the other behind. Van Sant had another script, &quot;The Boys of Storytown&quot;, containing the Mike and Scott characters, as well as Hans and Bob; Van Sant wanted to make the film but felt the script was unfinished. Ultimately, while editing &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot;, he combined the scripts for &quot;Modern Days&quot; and &quot;Storytown&quot; with the &quot;Idaho&quot; short story.

Initially, no studio would finance the film because of its controversial and offbeat subject matter. After &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; received favorable critical raves and awards, studios started to show some interest, but they all wanted revisions. Frustrated, Van Sant attempted to make the film on a shoestring budget with a cast of actual street kids, including Michael Parker and actor Rodney Harvey, who was going to play Scott.
When casting the two central roles, Van Sant sent the script to the agents of Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix, assuming that their agents would reject the script. Reeves&#x27;s agent was amenable to the project, but Phoenix&#x27;s would not even show it to him. Van Sant had the idea to get Reeves to personally deliver the film treatment to Phoenix at his home in Florida. Reeves did so during the winter holiday season, riding his 1974 Norton Commando motorcycle from his family home in Canada to the Phoenix family ranch in Micanopy, Florida. Reeves had worked previously with Phoenix on Lawrence Kasdan&#x27;s &quot;I Love You to Death&quot; and with his brother Joaquin Phoenix and girlfriend Martha Plimpton on Ron Howard&#x27;s &quot;Parenthood&quot;. After reading the treatment, Phoenix agreed to play Scott, but since Van Sant had already cast Reeves in the role, they had to convince River to take the edgier role of Mike. Van Sant promised not to make either actor do anything embarrassing. He got an offer of $2 million from an outside investor, but when he delayed production for nine months so that Phoenix could make &quot;Dogfight&quot;, the investor pulled out. Producer Laurie Parker shopped the script around; at the time, New Line Cinema was in the process of branching out into producing arthouse films and decided to back Van Sant&#x27;s vision with a $2.5 million budget. In a 2012 interview, Kiefer Sutherland said that he declined Van Sant&#x27;s offer to star in the lead role because he wanted to go skiing, a decision he has said he regrets.

===Filming===
Principal photography took place from November to December 1990, primarily in Portland, Seattle, and Rome. Scenes of the Idaho road depicted in the film were shot near Maupin, Oregon, on Oregon Route 216. Phoenix arrived in Portland two weeks before principal photography to begin research, with Van Sant remembering, &quot;He seemed to be changing into this character&quot;. One of the film&#x27;s directors of photography, Eric Alan Edwards, recalled that Phoenix &quot;looked like a street kid&quot;, and &quot;in a very raw way he wore that role. I&#x27;ve never seen anybody so intent on living his role&quot;. Several cast and crew members, including Michael Parker, Phoenix, Reeves, and Flea, lived together in a house in Portland during filming. A couple of times a week, they would play music together. Due to the low budget, a typical day of shooting started at 6 am and ended at 11 pm.

The film was not storyboarded and was made without a shot list. The campfire scene, originally just three pages, was expanded by Phoenix into an eight-page scene in which Mike professes his love for Scott, thereby making the character&#x27;s homosexuality obvious, as opposed to Van Sant&#x27;s more ambiguous original version. Phoenix described his process as his &quot;own stream-of-consciousness, and this just happened to be one that was more than actor notes. Then Keanu and I refined it, worked on it, but it was all done quickly. It was something I wrote down a night, two nights, before, and then I showed it to Keanu and Gus. And Gus kept the whole thing. He didn&#x27;t pare it down. It&#x27;s a long scene.&quot; Phoenix has said that neither he nor Reeves felt uncomfortable with &quot;Idaho&quot;″s queerness. When asked if he was worried that playing a gay prostitute might hurt his public image, Reeves said, &quot;Hurt my image? Who am I—a politician? [laughs softly] No. I&#x27;m an actor. That wasn&#x27;t a problem.&quot;

Eric Edwards shot the time-lapse photography shots on his own. They were not in the script and the film&#x27;s producer was worried that he was using too much film. Van Sant originally had the screen go black when Mike passed out, but was not satisfied with this approach. He used Edwards&#x27;s footage to present Mike&#x27;s perspective of &quot;an altered sense of time&quot;. Some New Line executives disliked the Shakespeare scenes and wanted Van Sant to cut them, but foreign distributors wanted as much Shakespeare in the film as possible.

==Music==

The film&#x27;s score was composed by pedal steel guitarist Bill Stafford. He recorded various arrangements for the film, including instrumental adaptations of &quot;Home on the Range&quot; and &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;.

==Reception and release==
===Release===

&quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; premiered at the 48th Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 1991. It also received screenings at the 17th Deauville Film Festival, 16th Toronto International Film Festival and the 29th New York Film Festival. The film was released in select theaters in the United States on September 29, 1991. It grossed $6.4 million in the United States and Canada and $1.7 million in the United Kingdom.

===Critical response===

The film achieved critical acclaim. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;The achievement of this film is that it wants to evoke that state of drifting need, and it does. There is no mechanical plot that has to grind to a Hollywood conclusion, and no contrived test for the heroes to pass.&quot;

In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Peter Travers wrote, &quot;Van Sant&#x27;s clear-eyed, unsentimental approach to a plot that pivots on betrayal and death is reflected in magnetic performances from Reeves and Phoenix.&quot; Vincent Canby, in his &quot;New York Times&quot; review, wrote, &quot;The performances, especially by the two young stars, are as surprising as they are sure. Mr. Phoenix (&quot;Dogfight&quot;) and Mr. Reeves (of the two &quot;Bill and Ted&quot; comedies) are very fine in what may be the two best roles they&#x27;ll find in years. Roles of this density, for young actors, do not come by that often&quot;.
In his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen praised Phoenix&#x27;s performance: &quot;The campfire scene in which Mike awkwardly declares his unrequited love for Scott is a marvel of delicacy. In this, and every scene, Phoenix immerses himself so deeply inside his character you almost forget you&#x27;ve seen him before: it&#x27;s a stunningly sensitive performance, poignant and comic at once.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an &quot;A−&quot; rating and wrote, &quot;When Van Sant shows us speeded-up images of clouds rolling past wheat fields, the familiar device transcends cliché, because it&#x27;s tied to the way that Mike, in his benumbed isolation, experiences his own life—as a running piece of surrealism. The sheer, expressive beauty of those images haunted me for days.&quot; J. Hoberman, in his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, wrote, &quot;While Phoenix vanishes with reckless triumph into his role, Reeves stands, or occasionally struts, uneasily beside his, unable to project even the self-mocking wit of Matt Dillon&#x27;s star turn in &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot;.&quot; Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Gus Van Sant&#x27;s sensibility is wholly original, wholly fresh. &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; adds a new ingredient: a kind of boho sweetness. I loved it.&quot;

Conversely, Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; two and half stars out of four, calling it &quot;nothing but set pieces; tossed into a mix whose meaning is almost certainly private&quot;.
&quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Schickel wrote, &quot;What plot it has is borrowed, improbably, from &quot;Henry IV&quot;, and whenever anyone manages to speak an entire paragraph, it is usually a Shakespearean paraphrase. But this is a desperate imposition on an essentially inert film.&quot;
In his review for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Terrence Rafferty wrote, &quot;Van Sant has stranded the actor in a movie full of flat characters and bad ideas, but Phoenix walks through the picture, down the road after road after road, as if he were surrounded by glorious phantoms.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A tantalizing glimpse of a talented director and his stars all at the top of their respective games, Gus Van Sant&#x27;s loose reworking of Henry IV is smart, sad and audacious.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 77 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews.

=== Home media ===
The film was originally released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1992.
In 2005, the film was remastered by The Criterion Collection and released on a two-disc DVD set. The second disc features new interviews, outtakes and more information about the movie. This DVD set is accompanied by an illustrated 64-page-booklet featuring previously published articles, interviews with cast and crew, new essays by JT LeRoy and Amy Taubin, a 1991 article by Lance Loud, and reprinted interviews with Gus Van Sant, River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the DVD a &quot;B+&quot; rating and wrote, &quot;While you may enjoy watching &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;, whether you choose to view this two-disc Criterion edition in its entirety depends on how much you enjoy watching people talking about &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;&quot;, and concluded, &quot;But with all the various interpretations and influences, this is definitely a film worth talking about&quot;.

In 2015, The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray, based on a restored 4K digital transfer.

== Accolades ==
&quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; received the Showtime International Critics Award at the 1991 Toronto Film Festival. River Phoenix received the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival. In response, he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want more awards. Venice is the most progressive festival. Anything else would be a token&quot;. Phoenix was the Best Actor runner-up in the 1991 New York Film Critics Circle awards and received the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead and National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor, becoming the second-youngest winner of the former. The film&#x27;s six nominations at the 7th Independent Spirit Awards tied with &quot;Hangin&#x27; with the Homeboys&quot; for the most nominations at that ceremony. Winning three, it tied with &quot;Rambling Rose&quot; for the most awards.

<doc id="605202" wikidata="Q440741" url="?curid=605202" title="Pavel Bure">
<text>Pavel Vladimirovich Bure (, ; born 31 March 1971) is a Russian former professional ice hockey player who played the right wing position. Nicknamed &quot;the Russian Rocket&quot; for his speed, Bure played for 12 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Vancouver Canucks, Florida Panthers and New York Rangers between 1991 and 2003. Trained in the Soviet Union, he played three seasons with the Central Red Army team before his NHL career.

Selected 113th overall in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft by Vancouver, he began his NHL career in the 1991–92 season, and won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s best rookie before leading the NHL in goal-scoring in 1993–94 and helping the Canucks to the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. After seven seasons the Canucks traded Bure to the Panthers, where he won back-to-back Rocket Richard Trophies as the league&#x27;s leading goal-scorer. Bure struggled with knee injuries throughout his career, resulting in his retirement in 2005 as a member of the Rangers, although he had not played since 2003. He averaged better than a point per game in his NHL career (779 points with 437 goals in 702 NHL games) and is fourth all-time in goals per game. After six years of eligibility, Bure was elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame in June 2012. In 2017, an NHL panel named Bure one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history.

Internationally, Bure competed for the Soviet Union and Russia. As a member of the Soviet Union, he won two silver medals and a gold in three World Junior Championships, followed by a gold and a silver medal in the 1990 and 1991 World Championships, respectively. After the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, Bure competed for Russia in two Winter Olympics, claiming silver at the 1998 Games in Nagano as team captain, and bronze at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City. Following Bure&#x27;s retirement in 2005, he was named the general manager for Russia&#x27;s national team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. Bure was later recognized by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) for his international career, and was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Early life==
Bure was born in Moscow in 1971 to Vladimir and Tatiana Bure. Vladimir Bure, a Russian swimming legend, had dreams of Pavel becoming a professional swimmer, but he aspired to play hockey at an early age. He attended his first tryout with the CSKA Moscow hockey school at the age of six, despite his limited skating ability. Until that point, Bure had only played ball hockey on the streets. After Bure failed to impress in his first tryout, his father told him that if he did not show significant improvement within two months, he would withdraw him from the hockey school. By age 11, he was named the best forward in his league. Around that time, in July 1982, Bure was selected as one of three young Russian players to practice with Wayne Gretzky and Soviet national goaltender Vladislav Tretiak in a taped television special. 

At age 12, his parents separated, and he remained with his mother. By the time he was 14 years old, he was named to the Central Red Army&#x27;s junior team. In 1991, he joined his father and brother, Valeri in moving to North America as he embarked on a National Hockey League (NHL) career with the Vancouver Canucks. His mother arrived two months later. They settled initially in Los Angeles where Vladimir continued to train and coach both Valeri and Pavel in hockey and physical conditioning. However both became estranged from their father, along with his second wife and their half-sister Katya, by 1998. Neither brother has explained a reason for the split.

In December 1986, he embarked on a tour of Canada with the Soviet national midget team from Ottawa to Vancouver. Nearly five years before Bure made his NHL debut with the Vancouver Canucks in 1991 at the Pacific Coliseum, he played his first game at his future home rink as part of the tour. Bure also earned another opportunity to meet Gretzky, as well as defenceman Paul Coffey, when his team stopped in Edmonton to play at the Northlands Coliseum.

==Playing career==
===CSKA Moscow (1987–1991)===
At age 16, Bure began his professional hockey career playing for CSKA Moscow. He was invited to the senior club&#x27;s training camp for the 1987–88 season. Although he was deemed too young and not yet ready for the Soviet League, Bure earned minimal playing time filling in for absent regulars. He made his debut in September 1987, and played five games for the senior team, scoring his only goal in his first game.

Bure joined the club full-time in 1988–89 and amassed 17 goals, a Soviet League record for rookies. The record would last for 18 years until Alexei Cherepanov scored 18 goals in 2006–07. Bure added 9 assists for 26 points to earn the league&#x27;s rookie of the year honours. His individual success helped CSKA Moscow capture their thirteenth consecutive Soviet championship and twelfth consecutive IIHF European Cup in 1989 (they repeated as European champions the following year).

As a member CSKA, Bure joined a lineup that featured several future NHL players, including linemates Sergei Fedorov and Alexander Mogilny, as well as Igor Larionov, Viacheslav Fetisov, Sergei Makarov, and Vladimir Konstantinov. The combination of Bure, Fedorov and Mogilny formed a promising combination for head coach Viktor Tikhonov, with expectations to replace the previous top Soviet line, the K-L-M combination of Vladimir Krutov, Larionov and Makarov. The trio was short-lived, as Mogilny defected to play for the Buffalo Sabres in 1989, and Fedorov joined the Detroit Red Wings the following year.

In his third and final season with the Red Army, Bure tied for the lead in team-scoring with Valeri Kamensky, tallying 46 points. His 35 goals was second in the league, one goal behind Ramil Yuldashev of Sokil Kyiv. Bure turned down a three-year contract extension in August 1991, which resulted in him being left off the roster of the Soviet team for the Canada Cup.

===Transfer to the NHL (1989–1991)===
Prior to the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, William Houston of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote, &quot;The best of the group is Soviet star winger Pavel Bure, a spectacular player with outstanding speed. He is compared to Vladimir Krutov and also the late Soviet superstar of the 1970s, Valeri Kharlamov.&quot; NHL organizations were afraid he would not leave the Soviet Union to play in the NHL thus deterring teams from selecting him early, although scouts and analysts believed he could have been selected as high as the second round had he defected. Many analysts compared him to Valeri Kharlamov. Edmonton Oilers&#x27; scout Barry Fraser commented, &quot;From what I&#x27;ve seen of him, Bure can play on any team in the NHL right now... he&#x27;s quick, real quick, small and very exciting. He may be the top player in this year&#x27;s draft, but because he is from the Soviet Union, we don&#x27;t analyze him the same way as a kid from the West... I don&#x27;t expect him to go really early because it is still too much of a gamble to hope he will defect.&quot;

Bure was selected 113th overall in the sixth round Draft by the Vancouver Canucks, following his rookie season with CSKA Moscow. The pick was controversial, as the Canucks had chosen him seemingly a year ahead of his eligible draft season. At the age of 18, he was available to be chosen in the first three rounds of the draft, but to be selected any later, he would have needed to play at least two seasons—with a minimum of 11 games per season—for his elite-level Soviet club, the Central Red Army. While most teams believed he was ineligible, the Canucks&#x27; head scout at the time, Mike Penny, discovered Bure had played in additional exhibition and international games to make him an eligible late-round draft choice a year early. Jack Button, the Washington Capitals&#x27; director of player personnel, admitted &quot;everybody would have taken him earlier. We assumed he was not eligible... you&#x27;ve got to give the Canucks credit for doing their homework.&quot;

Several other teams either had similar knowledge or had pursued Bure but there was confusion as to the legitimacy of the extra games. The Detroit Red Wings had asked league vice president Gil Stein about Bure&#x27;s availability before their fifth-round pick but were told he was not eligible. They later decided to select him with their sixth-round pick, 116th overall, and settle his eligibility later. The Canucks selected Bure three picks ahead of Detroit&#x27;s turn. Meanwhile, Winnipeg Jets general manager Mike Smith, claimed he made an offer to the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation that would involve three years of transfer payments before Bure would be allowed to join the Jets; however Smith did not have any plans to draft Bure in 1989 as he believed he was ineligible.

Canucks&#x27; general manager Pat Quinn originally intended to draft Bure in the eighth round but after receiving word the Oilers had similar intentions selected him in the sixth. Following the announcement of Bure&#x27;s draft, several other team representatives reportedly stormed the Met Center stage in Minnesota, where the draft was being held. Formal complaints were filed resulting in an investigation into the selection. After the pick was deemed illegal by league president John Ziegler in a press release on May 17, 1990, the Canucks appealed the decision, procuring game sheets proving Bure&#x27;s participation in the additional games with the help of recent Soviet acquisition Igor Larionov. It was not until the eve of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, in which Bure would have been re-entered that the draft choice was upheld. Although Larionov and Fetisov had successfully spearheaded the rebellion against Soviet ice hockey officials in the late 1980s that led to Soviet players joining the NHL, Bure&#x27;s transfer to the Canucks was met with resistance, and the Soviet authorities forbade the Canucks to contact Bure personally. During the 1991 World Junior Championships, he said in an interview that he was hesitant to defect for fears the Soviets would make things difficult for his younger brother Valeri Bure, who was 15 at the time and playing in the junior league.

Bure left Moscow with his father and brother on September 6, 1991, staying temporarily in Los Angeles. His mother arrived shortly afterward. The Canucks began negotiating a contract with Bure, but before one could be finalized, the issue of his existing contract with the Central Red Army had to be settled. The Canucks management and officials from the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation met in late-October 1991 in a Detroit court, where they bartered for a cash settlement. After the Canucks offered US$200,000, Bure stood up in the courtroom to offer an additional $50,000, bringing the total to $250,000. The Soviet officials accepted, and Canucks management paid the full $250,000. Bure signed a four-year contract worth a reported $2.7 million with an $800,000 signing bonus. The deal made Bure the Canucks&#x27; second highest paid player behind team captain Trevor Linden.

===Vancouver Canucks (1991–1999)===
Due to the court proceedings, Bure&#x27;s debut with the Canucks was delayed until a month into the 1991–92 season. Garnering much attention in Vancouver, his first practice with the club on November 3, 1991, was attended by approximately 2,000 fans. He played his first game for the Canucks on November 5, 1991, in a 2–2 tie against the Winnipeg Jets. Despite not scoring a point, Bure showcased his talent and speed with several end-to-end rushes, carrying the puck past several defenders from near his defensive zone to the opposing net. Following the game, &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; columnist Iain MacIntyre compared him to a rocket, calling him &quot;the fastest Soviet creation since Sputnik&quot;. MacIntyre&#x27;s comments are credited for laying the groundwork for Bure&#x27;s moniker as the &quot;Russian Rocket,&quot; which echoed the nickname of Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard, who played for the Montreal Canadiens in the 1950s. In his third game, Bure recorded his first point, an assist against the New York Islanders on November 10. He scored his first two NHL goals in the next game, on November 12, against Daniel Berthiaume of the Los Angeles Kings. He finished with 34 goals and 60 points in 65 games that season, including 22 goals in his final 23 games. In the last game of the regular season, Bure scored a goal to tie Ivan Hlinka&#x27;s 1981–82 team mark for most points by a rookie.
As the Canucks opened the 1992 playoffs against the Winnipeg Jets, Bure recorded his first NHL hat trick in game six to help force a seventh and deciding game. Vancouver won the series to advance to the second round, but were eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers. Bure finished his first Stanley Cup playoffs with six goals and 10 points in 13 games. At the end of the season, he was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year. His 60 points were second among first-year players to Tony Amonte&#x27;s 69 points with the Rangers, although Bure played in 14 fewer games. When accepting the award, Bure thanked Canucks linemate Igor Larionov for his guidance. On arriving in Vancouver, his former Red Army teammate took him into his home for two weeks before Bure moved into his own apartment; the two also roomed together on the road. Bure&#x27;s Calder Trophy, along with head coach Pat Quinn&#x27;s Jack Adams Award as the league&#x27;s top coach, marked the first major individual NHL awards in Canucks&#x27; team history. However, despite being named the league&#x27;s top rookie, Bure was left off the NHL All-Rookie Team, making him the only Calder recipient not to be named to the lineup. This was because he split his time playing both left and right wing. When it came to voting for the players, Bure had the most total votes, but not enough at either position to claim a spot.

Bure improved on his rookie season in 1992–93 with the first of two consecutive 60-goal seasons. In the third game of the season, he scored a career-high four goals against the Winnipeg Jets. His three goals and one assist in the second period set a pair of Canucks&#x27; records for most goals and points in a period, in addition to the team mark for most goals overall in a game (for which he is tied with several players). Furthermore, Bure scored two of his goals on the penalty kill to set a fourth team record for most short-handed goals in one contest. He appeared in his first NHL All-Star Game in 1993, being named to the Clarence Campbell Conference Team as the lone Canucks&#x27; representative, and scored two goals. Shortly after the All-Star break, Bure established a new franchise record for goals in a season during a 5–1 win over the Quebec Nordiques, surpassing Tony Tanti&#x27;s 45-goal mark. The next month, on March 1, he reached the 50-goal mark for the first time in his career, scoring against Grant Fuhr of the Buffalo Sabres in a neutral-site game in Hamilton, Ontario. He also surpassed Patrik Sundström&#x27;s franchise record of 91 points. Bure finished the season with 110 points in 83 games, and became the first Canuck named to the NHL first All-Star team. His 110 points stood as the team record until it was broken by Henrik Sedin&#x27;s 112 points in 2009–10.

A groin injury early in the 1993-94 season limited Bure&#x27;s production for the first half of the season. Even so, he improved in the second half, and led the league in goal-scoring by repeating his 60-goal feat of the previous season. In doing so, he became the eighth player in NHL history to record back-to-back 60-goal seasons. He concluded the season with a streak of 49 goals and 78 points in his final 51 games, and earned player of the month honours in March 1994 after scoring 19 goals and 30 points in 16 games. His March scoring burst was just one point shy of Stan Smyl&#x27;s 31-point March in 1983 for the most productive month by a Canucks player. Bure&#x27;s 154 NHL goals at that point in his career put him behind only Wayne Gretzky and Mike Bossy for the most in any NHL player&#x27;s first three seasons. He recorded 49 goals in the club&#x27;s final 51 games, and contributed to 46.45% of his team&#x27;s goals in the final 47 games of the season to carry the Canucks into the 1994 postseason.
Entering the 1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs as the seventh seed, the Canucks went on a run to the Stanley Cup Finals. In the seventh game of the opening-round series against the Calgary Flames, Bure scored one of the most significant and well-known goals in Canucks&#x27; history. After receiving a breakaway pass from defenceman Jeff Brown, he deked and scored on Flames&#x27; goalie Mike Vernon in the second overtime to win the series. In game two of the second round against the Dallas Stars, Bure knocked enforcer Shane Churla to the ice with an elbow to the jaw. He also scored two goals in the game to help Vancouver to a 3–0 win. Although Bure was not initially penalized for the play, he was later fined $500 by the league. He recorded six goals and eight points in five games against the Dallas Stars, and against the Toronto Maple Leafs the following round scored four goals and six points in five games.

After defeating Dallas in five games, the Canucks eliminated the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Campbell Conference Finals to meet the New York Rangers in the Finals, where the Canucks lost in seven games. Bure finished with a team-high 16 goals and 31 points in 24 games, second in playoff scoring only to Conn Smythe Trophy winner Brian Leetch. His points total also remained the highest by any Russian player until Evgeni Malkin of the Pittsburgh Penguins recorded 36 in 2009.

In the next off-season, the Canucks announced they had re-signed Bure to a five-year, $24.5 million contract on June 16. The deal was reported to have been signed before game three of the Stanley Cup Finals against New York. It also included Bure&#x27;s marketing rights and put his father, Vladimir, on the team payroll as a fitness and marketing consultant. The average annual salary of $4.9 million made Bure the league&#x27;s third highest-paid player, behind Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. In fact, Bure and the Canucks had entered into contract negotiations at the beginning of the 1993–94 season, although two years remained in his original deal. Neither side could come to an initial agreement; one of the major factors was the Canucks&#x27; demands for the contract to be in Canadian dollars on account of the American exchange rate. Numerous accusations were made in the media during the Canucks&#x27; playoff run that Bure threatened not to play if a contract could not be agreed upon. A &quot;Toronto Star&quot; article, published before the first game of the Finals on May 31, 1994, claimed Bure had signed a five-year, $30 million contract that, if the Canucks had not agreed to, would have seen him pull out of game five of the Conference Finals against the Maple Leafs. The article was followed by two additional claims in the following two days in the Vancouver-based newspaper &quot;The Province&quot; and &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;. The &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; held the contract was a five-year, $22.5 million deal, and that it was signed before either game six or seven of the opening round against the Flames after Bure&#x27;s agent, Ron Salcer, told general manager Quinn that Bure would not play if the deal was not made. As the story continued well into the next season, Pat Quinn appeared in a segment on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; on March 27, 1995, publicly denying the claims.

Due to the 1994–95 NHL lockout, Bure spent single-game stints with Spartak Moscow of the Russian Super League and EV Landshut of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). He joined a team of Russian NHL players organized by Slava Fetisov that returned to Russia to play a five-game charity tour against local clubs. On the team, Bure reunited with former Central Red Army linemates Mogilny and Fedorov. When the NHL Players Association (NHLPA) and owners came to an agreement on January 12, 1995, NHL play was set to resume. However, there were unresolved contract issues, as Salcer claimed the Canucks promised they would pay Bure&#x27;s full salary, despite the lockout, which cancelled nearly half of the 1994–95 season. Bure held out for four days as a result (the amount claimed to be owing was $1.7 million), before the two sides reached an agreement. The Canucks would put the disputed amount in escrow and would continue discussions. He soon reported to Vancouver and went on to tally 43 points in 44 games of the shortened season. In the 1995 playoffs, Bure set franchise records for most goals and points in a series with seven and 12 respectively in a seven-game series victory against the St. Louis Blues (Mikael Samuelsson tied Bure&#x27;s goal-scoring record in 2010 against the Los Angeles Kings). The Canucks, however, failed to defend their Clarence Campbell Conference championship title, being swept by the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round. The Canucks&#x27; elimination in 1995 marked the last time Bure appeared in the post-season with the club. He finished with a career playoff total of 66 points with the Canucks, including 34 goals, which remained the highest club total until Linden tied the mark in 2007.

At the start of the 1995–96 season, Bure changed his jersey number from 10 to 96. The switch commemorated September 6, 1991, the day on which he first landed in North America from Moscow—9th month, 6th day. He had originally asked to wear the number when he first joined the Canucks, but was not permitted to do so by head coach Pat Quinn, who did not approve of high jersey numbers. After the Canucks traded with the Buffalo Sabres for Alexander Mogilny, reuniting the two Russian players, the jersey number was deemed acceptable because Mogilny had used number 89 since defecting to North America in 1989.

Early in the season, Bure sustained the first of several serious knee injuries during his career. On November 9, 1995, in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks, Bure was grabbed around the head by defenceman Steve Smith while approaching the end boards. Falling to the ice, he caught his skate against the boards, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee. Requiring arthroscopic surgery, in which tendon was removed from his hamstring to repair the ACL, he was sidelined for the remainder of the season.

Bure returned to the Canucks&#x27; lineup with his knee fully recovered in the 1996–97 season. In the season opener against the Flames on October 5, 1996, Bure was pushed into the boards head-first. He continued to play after the hit, but experienced headaches in the following weeks. As Bure&#x27;s play dropped early in the season, the media speculated that he was playing injured. After he went eight games without a goal, head coach Tom Renney claimed Bure was not playing with a head injury, but instead had injured his shoulder in a game against the New York Rangers on November 23. Nevertheless, he continued to play. With under a month left in the season, he received another hit, during a game against the Avalanche on March 3, 1997. Bure left the game and did not return for the remainder of the season. Afterwards, he admitted he was playing with a neck injury, having sustained whiplash from the first game against Calgary, but did not want to take himself out of the lineup after missing 62 games the previous season. With Bure&#x27;s reduced playing capacity, he managed 55 points in 63 games, well below his usual pace, and the Canucks missed the playoffs for the first time since he joined the team. In a 2012 interview, Bure admitted having sustained a head injury on the initial hit against Calgary and that &quot;he should not have played through it&quot;.

In the off-season, the Canucks made another significant move, signing Rangers&#x27; captain Mark Messier during free agency on July 26, 1997. Despite finally having a high-profile centre to play with, media reports soon appeared claiming that Bure was asking to be traded. The Canucks opened the season with two games against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in Tokyo – an event organized by the league to market hockey for the upcoming 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. After two injury-plagued seasons with the number 96 on his jersey, Bure switched back to his familiar number 10, explaining: &quot;I&#x27;m not superstitious, but the last two seasons have been bad memories.&quot; Although the Canucks missed the playoffs for the second straight year, he returned to his previous form in 1997–98, scoring 51 goals for his first 50-goal season since 1993–94, and third overall. Bure later recalled that with the Canucks out of playoff contention with a handful of games left, head coach Mike Keenan told him he could play as much as he wanted to reach the milestone. Scoring 50 goals was also implicit in a contract bonus for Bure. With an additional 39 assists, his 90 points ranked him third in the NHL, behind Peter Forsberg and Jaromír Jágr.

Following the 1997–98 season, Bure told newly appointed general manager Brian Burke that he would not play for the Canucks again, despite still having a year left in his contract worth $8 million. He then went public with the declaration, stating he intended to leave the club for &quot;personal reasons&quot;. Bure did not report to the club the following season. Instead, he returned to his hometown Moscow to practise with his former Central Red Army club. During this time, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko offered Bure a tax-free $4 million salary to play in Belarus, which he turned down.

===Florida Panthers (1999–2002)===
Bure held out well into the 1998–99 season until he was traded on January 17, 1999, to the Florida Panthers, with Bret Hedican, Brad Ference, and Vancouver&#x27;s third-round choice in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft (Robert Fried) for Ed Jovanovski, Dave Gagner, Mike Brown, Kevin Weekes, and Florida&#x27;s first-round choice in the 2000 draft (Nathan Smith). Talks between Burke and Bryan Murray, general manager of the Panthers, had begun in late-December. After the trade was completed, Bure explained that he felt alienated from Canucks&#x27; management after arriving in North America having defected from Russia. He claimed he had been in Los Angeles for two weeks before any Canucks&#x27; representative came to see him, as well as several bitter contract negotiations—particularly those of 1994. He also claimed that someone within the Canucks&#x27; management planted the constant allegations that he threatened not to play during the 1994 playoff run. Bure&#x27;s agent at the time, Ron Salcer, also believed the story.

Meeting the Panthers in New York for a game against the Islanders, Bure debuted with his new club on January 20, 1999. He played on an all-Russian line with Viktor Kozlov and Oleg Kvasha and scored two goals. In his first six games with the club, Bure scored eight goals and three assists for eleven points. Less than a month into his Panthers debut, he reinjured his knee, keeping him out for three weeks. Despite the injury, the Panthers signed him to a five-year, $47.5 million contract (with an option for a sixth year at $10.5 million), the most lucrative in team history. Another injury ended Bure&#x27;s season after just 11 games with Florida, though he scored 13 goals and three assists in that time.
In 1999–2000, his first full season as a Panther, Bure led the league in goal-scoring to capture his first of two consecutive Rocket Richard Trophies with a 58-goal season. It marked the second time Bure led the league in goal-scoring, but his first Rocket Richard Trophy as the award had been introduced the previous season. Combined with 36 assists, his 94 points came within two of Art Ross Trophy winner Jaromír Jágr as the league&#x27;s leading point-scorer. His 58 goals and 94 points both set franchise records. He helped Florida to a fifth-place finish in the Eastern Conference to earn their first post-season berth in three seasons, though they were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the New Jersey Devils. Bure finished third for the Hart Memorial Trophy winner behind Chris Pronger and Jágr. He was named to the NHL second All-Star team for the first time.

Bure was set to make his much-anticipated return to Vancouver to play the Canucks on November 5, 1999, but was kept out of the lineup due to a broken finger. A prior groin injury had also forced him out of a Panther&#x27;s home game against the Canucks earlier in the season. During the season, he was named to the 2000 NHL All-Star Game in Toronto, where he recorded an assist and the eleventh hat trick in the history of the All-Star Game. Of Bure&#x27;s three goals, two were assisted by his brother Valeri, who played on the same line with him, along with his Panthers linemate, Viktor Kozlov. Helping lead the World team to a 9–4 victory over North America, Bure was named the All-Star Game MVP.

Bure repeated as league scoring champion in 2000–01 with 59 goals, reaching the 50-goal plateau for the fifth and final time in his career, as well as bettering his franchise single-season, goal-scoring record. However, the Panthers missed the playoffs, finishing 12th place in the East. Bure set a league record that season by scoring 29.5% of his team&#x27;s total goals over the course of the season. He was named to the NHL second All-Star team, behind Jágr in the right wing position for the second consecutive year.

Before the 2001–02 season, the Panthers acquired Valeri Bure from the Calgary Flames in a trade, putting the brothers on the same team for the first time. However, Bure suffered a setback in the pre-season re-injuring his groin. Bure recalled having &quot;good relations&quot; with Panthers&#x27; management, who often consulted with him on team matters, including the acquisition of his brother. At the trading deadline, Bure was traded to the New York Rangers. During his 56 games for the Panthers that season, he led the team in scoring for the third consecutive season with 49 points.

===New York Rangers (2002–2003)===
The New York Rangers acquired Bure on March 18, 2002, along with Florida&#x27;s second-round pick in the 2002 draft (Lee Falardeau) for Igor Ulanov, Filip Novak, as well as the Rangers&#x27; first and second-round choices in the 2002 draft (Petr Tatíček and Rob Globke, respectively) and a fourth-round choice in the 2003 draft. The Rangers had shown interest in Bure when he requested a trade from the Canucks in 1997. After losing their initial bid for Bure, Wayne Gretzky, who retired the same season Bure was traded to Florida, announced prior to the 1999–2000 season he would have extended his career had the Rangers been able to pull off the trade. Bure made his Rangers debut against the Vancouver Canucks the day after his trade on March 19, scoring a goal against his former team. He scored 12 goals and 20 points in 12 games after being traded, bettering his pace with Florida that season. Between the two teams, he finished the season with 34 goals and 69 points.

Bure suffered another knee injury in the 2002–03 pre-season; combined with a case of strep throat, he missed the first three games of the regular season. After returning to play, he had 14 goals and 21 points in his first 27 games, including two goals and an assist in his first game back, before a knee-on-knee collision in December forced him back out. After undergoing surgery 10 days later, it was revealed that there was no damage to the ACL as previously feared, but instead a tear to the meniscus in his left knee, which was repaired. Bure returned that season to appear in 39 games, managing 19 goals and 30 points.

Even after two operations, Bure did not play in 2003–04 due to the lingering effects of the knee injury. He failed a pre-season physical and was declared medically unable to play. Left with his fully insured $10 million salary (80 percent of which would be reimbursed to the team), the Rangers left him unprotected in the NHL&#x27;s Waiver Draft, where he was unclaimed.

===Retirement===
Bure remained inactive for another season due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout. After the NHL resumed play for the 2005–06 season, he announced his retirement from professional hockey at a press conference in Moscow on November 1, 2005, citing complications with his chronic knee injuries. In an interview Bure explained that he did not want to extend his playing career without being able to play at an elite level.

Because Bure had been inactive since the 2002–03 season, he was eligible for selection into the Hockey Hall of Fame (which requires players to wait three years after their last game) immediately following his retirement. After being passed for induction in his first six years of eligibility, Bure was voted in on June 27, 2012, alongside Joe Sakic, Adam Oates and Mats Sundin. He became the fifth Soviet or Russian player (after Vladislav Tretiak, Viacheslav Fetisov, Valeri Kharlamov and Igor Larionov) and the first player to spend the majority of his career with the Canucks to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

His non-selection in previous years was widely debated in the media. Bure was often compared with Cam Neely, a player who also waited six years for induction; he recorded similar goals-per-game numbers in a career that was also shortened to 700-plus games. It had been often rumoured that Pat Quinn, Bure&#x27;s former head coach and general manager in Vancouver, who became co-chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame&#x27;s selection committee, opposed Bure&#x27;s induction. However, in a conference call following his selection, Quinn was among the most prominent figures he thanked. Quinn criticized the Canucks organization for not yet retiring Bure&#x27;s jersey.

In his retirement, he remained publicly steadfast in his dissatisfaction with the way he was treated by the Canucks organization during his playing career. While Bure admitted to &quot;a lot of disagreements with the Canucks management,&quot; he maintained that he &quot;never had any problems with the Canucks fans&quot;. The Canucks retired Bure&#x27;s 10 jersey on November 2, 2013. The day before the Canucks announced they would rename the team&#x27;s Most Exciting Player Award to the Pavel Bure Most Exciting Player Award in his honour. Bure renounced his US citizenship in 2016.

==International career==
===Junior===
Prior to joining the NHL in 1991, Bure competed for the Soviet Union in several junior, international tournaments. The first was the 1988 Quebec Esso Cup, an under-17 tournament (now known as the World U-17 Hockey Challenge) held in Quebec City, where he earned a gold medal. That same year, he competed in his first of two consecutive European Junior Championships, winning a bronze medal.

The following year, Bure debuted at the world under-20 level as a 17-year-old at the 1989 World Junior Championships in Anchorage, Alaska. The top line of CSKA Moscow teammates Bure, Alexander Mogilny and Sergei Fedorov led the Soviet Union to a gold medal. Bure&#x27;s eight goals tied him for the tournament lead with Jeremy Roenick of the United States; he led the Soviet team with 14 points. He was named to the Tournament All-Star team, and earned Best Forward honours. He again participated in the 1989 European Junior Championship, helping the Soviet Union win the gold medal.

Bure competed in his second World Juniors in 1990, winning a silver medal in Helsinki, Finland, and scoring seven goals in seven games. Later that year, he made his senior debut with the Soviet national team as a 19-year-old at the 1990 World Championships in Switzerland. He scored two goals and four assists in ten games to help the Soviets to a gold medal finish. The Soviet team also won silver in the European Championship, which was decided from games played among the European teams at the tournament. Several months later, in July, Bure took part in his third international tournament of the year at the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle. Bure scored four goals and an assist in five games, and the Soviets won the gold medal.

In 1991, Bure appeared in his third and final World Junior Championships. Bure finished the tournament as the leading scorer with 12 goals in 7 games and the Soviets won the silver medal. He finished his three-year World Junior career with a tournament-record 27 goals, to go with 39 points, in 21 games. Bure later competed in the 1991 World Championships, his second international appearance of the year. He improved on his previous year&#x27;s total with 11 points in 11 games, tied for the team lead with Valeri Kamensky, and helped the Soviets to a bronze medal finish. Bure was named to the tournament&#x27;s second All-Star team. The 1991 team marked the last World Championships for the USSR, as the country was dissolved later that year.

===Senior===
Bure was set to represent the Soviet Union at the 1991 Canada Cup, however after turning down a three-year contract with his Russian club, CSKA Moscow, he was left off the final roster.

Bure played his first international tournament for Russia in preliminary games for the inaugural 1996 World Cup (the successor tournament to the Canada Cup). Bure had recently recovered from reconstructive surgery to his right knee, and had begun practicing with the Russian national team where he was reunited on a line with Fedorov and Mogilny, the first and only time the three of them would play together at the senior level; the line was considered &quot;perhaps the best forward line on earth&quot; at the time. However Bure bruised a kidney in one of the games and was forced to miss the main tournament.

As with the 1991 Canada Cup, controversy ensued when Bure refused to sign a petition organized by national team veteran Viacheslav Fetisov. With the Russian Ice Hockey Federation dealing with internal corruption, the petition called for the ouster of a few select Russian ice hockey officials. In response, Bure explained, &quot;I do not sign petitions. I believe I should work – play hockey. Petitions to the federation or to Olympic committees do not interest me.&quot;

Two years later, Bure made his Olympic debut with Russia at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano. He helped his team to advance to the gold medal game after a five-goal game in Russia&#x27;s 7–4 semifinal win against Finland. The Russians lost the gold medal game to the Czech Republic, ending with silver. Bure finished with a tournament-high nine goals to be named the top forward, and though he recorded no assists, placed third in point-scoring with nine points in six games.
Bure&#x27;s next international tournament was the 2000 World Championships, held in Saint Petersburg. The Russians had a disappointing tournament and finished eleventh. In six games, Bure managed four goals and an assist. Two years later, Bure made his second Olympic appearance at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, playing with a fractured hand. Bure finished his final international tournament as a player with two goals and an assist in six games while Russia won the bronze medal.

On the announcement of his retirement in 2005, Bure was named Russia&#x27;s Olympic general manager, succeeding Viacheslav Fetisov. He promised to put an end to the Russian Hockey Federation&#x27;s history of internal conflict and player boycotts, saying, &quot;You won&#x27;t see such a mess with the national team that you&#x27;ve seen here before,&quot; and that &quot;You won&#x27;t see grouchy players here anymore. Only those who really want to play for Russia will be called into the team.&quot; As general manager, Bure chose the team for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. The Russians failed to win a medal, losing to the Czech Republic in the bronze medal match. Leading up to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, former Soviet national goaltender Vladislav Tretiak was named Bure&#x27;s successor as Olympic general manager.

In December 2011, Bure was announced as one of the 2012 inductees into the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame. He was named alongside American Phil Housley, Finn Raimo Helminen and Czechoslovak Milan Nový in the annual class. The players were inducted in a ceremony in May 2012.

==Playing style==

Bure&#x27;s playing style reflected the speed, skill, and puck possession that was prominent in Soviet Union hockey programs. The most prevalent aspects of his game were his skating speed, agility, and acceleration, which earned him his nickname the &quot;Russian Rocket&quot;. He was able to use his quickness to separate himself from defenders, to retrieve pucks before the opposition could in all zones of the ice, and to skate the length of the ice on many occasions. In a 1993 poll of NHL coaches conducted by hockey writer Bob McKenzie, Bure was named the league&#x27;s best skater with eight of twenty-one votes, twice as many votes as any other player. One coach noted: &quot;Bure has the best combination of speed, agility, and balance ... He can also use change of speed better than anybody in the league right now.&quot;

During Bure&#x27;s rehabilitation period, following his first major knee injury in 1995, Canucks&#x27; conditioning coach Peter Twist noticed that his skating style was distinct in comparison to typical North American players. He explained: &quot;Most players skate on their inside edge and push off at a 45-degree angle, but Bure starts on his outer edge and rolls over to his inside edge and pushes back straighter on his stride ... he gets more power and force in his stride to get up to top speed quicker.&quot; his skating was also complemented by his ability to deke out defenders and goaltenders at top speeds, making him capable of routinely starting end-to-end rushes. However, several knee injuries, and the resulting reconstructive surgeries, compromised the speed that defined Bure&#x27;s game, ultimately leading to his retirement.

Early in Bure&#x27;s career, he was noted for playing a strong two-way game. Having joined Pat Quinn&#x27;s defensive-minded Canucks in 1991, Bure&#x27;s transition to the NHL was cited as being easier than that of his countryman, Igor Larionov, due to his quick adjustment to the team&#x27;s defensive demands. Regarding Bure&#x27;s first NHL game against the Winnipeg Jets, reporter Mike Beamish explained that &quot;hockey fans marvelled at his offensive thrusts, but hockey people were taken by a singular display of jet-powered defensive diligence. On one play, after the Canucks were caught deep in the Winnipeg zone, the Russian winger raced back and almost single-handedly foiled a two-on-one Jets&#x27; rush, making up a half-rink disadvantage.&quot; Bure was used on the team&#x27;s penalty kill for his entire tenure with the Canucks, and was proficient at generating shorthanded chances, pressuring the opposition with his quickness and positioning in the defensive zone. During the 1992 Stanley Cup playoffs, commentator and ex-NHL coach Harry Neale commented, &quot;I like the effort he gives it when he doesn&#x27;t have the puck. We all know what he can do when he thinks he can score, but he&#x27;s killing penalties, he&#x27;s checking, doing a lot of things.&quot; Bure tied for second-place on Bob McKenzie&#x27;s 1993 coaches poll for the NHL&#x27;s best penalty killer. He was also voted the league&#x27;s second-best stickhandler that season and garnered recognition as one of the smartest players in the NHL.

Sports journalists Damien Cox and Stephen Brunt wrote about Bure during the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs that he was a &quot;two-way dynamo,&quot; accounting for &quot;several bodychecks he handed out on the night&quot; and for his defensive abilities as he stayed on the ice in the last minutes of a one-goal playoff match against the Toronto Maple Leafs. They spoke highly of his creativity as well, recognizing him as &quot;someone who sees in his game a world of possibilities that just never occur to others,&quot; praising his &quot;sheer elegance and imagination&quot; and characterizing his hockey sense as &quot;ho-hum brilliance from the most explosive player in the sport&quot;. Brunt called him &quot;a , a van Gogh, a Picasso, a Charlie Parker&quot;. During the 1993-94 season, Bure demonstrated his strong playmaking abilities, helping linemate and friend Gino Odjick score a career-high 16 goals in a single season, more than twice the number of goals Odjick would score in any other year separated from Bure, and doubling his career goal totals up to that point in his career. According to teammate Cliff Ronning in 1994, &quot;we play a much sounder game defensively when Pavel&#x27;s flying, as he was in the first period&quot;. Former Canuck teammate Jyrki Lumme spoke of Bure as a player and teammate, &quot;That guy does something spectacular every time ... it&#x27;s frustrating to go against him in practice because he&#x27;s all over the place. He makes everybody on our team better.&quot;

During his time with the Canucks, Bure won the team&#x27;s Most Exciting Player Award, as voted by the fans, a record five times (tied with Tony Tanti), from 1992 to 1995, and once more in 1998. Trevor Linden, who had played with Bure for seven seasons, said following Bure&#x27;s retirement, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve ever seen or played with a player that&#x27;s brought people out of their seats like that.&quot; During the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals, Rangers coach Mike Keenan, who later coached Bure for one-and-a-half seasons in Vancouver, called him &quot;perhaps the most electrifying forward in the league&quot;. The Canucks renamed the award the Pavel Bure Most Exciting Player Award in his honour in 2013.

Bure has been described as a pure goal scorer and is statistically among the top players in NHL history in that regard. In addition to having reached the 50-goal mark in his career five times, and the 60-goal mark twice, his .623 goals per game average is third among the top 100 goal scorers in NHL history, behind Mike Bossy and Mario Lemieux. Michael Farber of the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; described Bure as &quot;the most dangerous scorer in the National Hockey League with the continued absence of Mario Lemieux because Bure can beat a defence with his speed, his strength, his mind. Bure isn&#x27;t a scorer as much as he is a permanent late-night television guest; he is to highlight packages what Terri Garr is to Letterman.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Family===
Bure comes from an athletic family; his father Vladimir, who is of Swiss descent (his side of the family originated from Furna, Switzerland), was an Olympic swimmer who competed for the Soviet Union in the 1968, 1972, and 1976 Olympic Games, where he won four medals. Bure retained his father as his personal trainer well into his playing career, before severing ties with him in 1997. Bure&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Valeri Bure, played goalkeeper for the national water polo team. Both Pavel and his younger brother Valeri became estranged from their father and his second wife, Julia, along with their half-sister Katya, by 1998. Neither brother has explained a reason for the split. According to various news outlets, Candace Cameron Bure revealed in a heartfelt Instagram post the passing of her father-in-law, Vladimir at the age of 73 on Tuesday, Sept. 3, 2024. 

Named after their grandfather, Bure&#x27;s younger brother, Valeri, was also a hockey player, spending 10 years in the NHL. The two siblings played with each other briefly as members of the Florida Panthers, after Valeri was traded there in 2001, and played together at the 1998 and 2002 Winter Olympics.

The Bure family made precious watches for the Russian tsars from 1815 until 1917, and Bure was named after his great-grandfather, a watchmaker to Tsar Alexander III. As craftspersons to the imperial family, the Bures were granted noble status. After Bure sustained his first serious knee injury in 1995, he pursued the watchmaking business during his rehabilitation period in an attempt to revive the family business. Fifty replicas of the same watches his ancestors made for the Russian imperial family were made and sold at US$30,000 each. Bure presented three of the gold replicas to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Moscow mayor Yuriy Luzhkov.

===Relationships===
Five days after arriving in North America from Moscow with his father and brother on September 6, 1991, (his mother Tatiana arrived two months later), Bure married an American fashion model, later revealed to be Jayme Bohn, in a civil ceremony. The marriage was allegedly set up by Bure&#x27;s agents as a preventative measure against deportation in the event he and the Canucks could not come to terms with a contract. Bure derived no immigration benefit from the marriage, which was dissolved the following year. Bohn became a costume designer in the film and television industry.

After being linked to girlfriend Dahn Bryan, a model and actress, early in his NHL career, Bure shared a relationship with tennis star and fellow Russian Anna Kournikova. The two met in 1999 when she was still linked to Bure&#x27;s former Russian teammate Sergei Fedorov. Bure and Kournikova were reported to have been engaged in 2000 after reporter Andrew Greven took a photo of them together in a Florida restaurant where Bure supposedly asked Kournikova to marry him. As the story made headlines in Russia, where they were both heavily followed in the media as celebrities, Bure and Kournikova both denied any engagement. Kournikova, 10 years younger than Bure, was 18 years old at the time. The following year, Kournikova and Fedorov were married in Moscow, though they soon divorced.

Bure married 23-year-old model Alina Khasanova on October 10, 2009, in Moscow, with 300 guests present. &quot;Pravda&quot; has reported, however, that the couple, who had known each other for four years, had officially married on October 10, 2008, in Miami. Together they have three children: Pavel Jr., Palina and Anastasia. Pavel Jr. was born on April 23, 2013; Palina was born on July 20, 2015. Their third child, a daughter named Anastasia, was born on 28 December 2018.

===Politics===

Bure is known to have frequently played ice hockey with Russian president Vladimir Putin, but has denied having any political ambitions himself in an interview with a Swedish newspaper in 2019.

===Legal activity===
In 2002, Bure sued the Russian newspaper &quot;the eXile&quot; for publishing an article stating he broke up with Kournikova because she had two vaginas. Although the newspapers&#x27; editorial staff claimed the story was a mere joke, the court ruled in favour of Bure in the amount of 500,000 rubles (US$17,770), and ordered a retraction to be printed. Two years later, on December 27, 2004, the Russian cosmetics chain Arbat Prestige published a story in their free promotional paper that Bure had bragged about Kournikova losing her virginity to him. Shortly thereafter, on January 31, 2005, Bure sued Arbat Prestige for 300 million rubles (US$10.65 million) in a court in Moscow. He also demanded the company print a retraction and apology in a future paper. The court ruled in favour of Bure in November 2005. However, the amount was reduced from 300 million to approximately 320,000 rubles.

On October 31, 2006, nearly a year after his retirement, Bure filed another suit after being kicked off a British Airways flight by the pilot, having been mistaken for a rowdy soccer fan. Despite an apology from the airline company in June 2007, Bure took the issue to court, suing British Airways for 20 million rubles. In late August 2007, a Russian court ruled in favour of Bure in the amount of 67,000 rubles.

===Alleged Mafia connections===
During Bure&#x27;s playing career, much speculation surrounded Russian NHL players and their potential ties to the Russian mafia both as victims and associates. As Soviet players began defecting to the NHL, many cases of extortion began surfacing. The Russian mafia was targeting the players&#x27; families still living in Russia. Former teammate Alexander Mogilny was a victim of such an extortion attempt in 1994, while Bure was reported to have made payments amounting to several thousand dollars to Russian extortionists in 1993. Three years later, in 1996, American sports network ESPN aired reports alleging Bure was a potential associate of the Russian mafia because of his relationship with friend and business partner Anzor Kikalishvili, known to both Russian and American police as a suspected criminal and possible Russian mob boss. Bure was revealed to hold a position as vice president in the sports company Twenty First Century Association, owned by Kikalishvili, and reportedly believed by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to be a mafia front worth at least US$100 million in illicit funds. While Bure did not deny his business and personal relationships with Kikalishvili, he refuted reports Kikalishvili was involved in any criminal activity.

Speculation resurfaced in 1999, as Bure was included in an investigation aired by the CBC investigative news program &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; that made several supposed associations between Soviet NHL players and the Russian mafia. An allegation arose that Bure&#x27;s former CSKA teammate Viacheslav Fetisov used a company, of which he was president, to launder money for Vyacheslav Ivankov, considered the &quot;Russian godfather&quot; in North America. Bure&#x27;s relationship with Kikalishvili continued to be questioned. Bure denied Kikalishvili&#x27;s involvement in any criminal activity, dismissing the allegations as &quot;rumours&quot;.

<text>The Dryopteridaceae are a family of leptosporangiate ferns in the order Polypodiales. They are known colloquially as the wood ferns. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the family is placed in the suborder Polypodiineae. Alternatively, it may be treated as the subfamily Dryopteridoideae of a very broadly defined family Polypodiaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;.

The family contains about 1700 species and has a cosmopolitan distribution. Species may be terrestrial, epipetric, hemiepiphytic, or epiphytic. Many are cultivated as ornamental plants. The largest genera are &quot;Elaphoglossum&quot; (600+), &quot;Polystichum&quot; (260), &quot;Dryopteris&quot; (225), and &quot;Ctenitis&quot; (150). These four genera contain about 70% of the species. Dryopteridaceae diverged from the other families in eupolypods I about 100 million years ago.

== Description ==
The rhizomes are often stout, creeping, ascending, or erect, and sometimes scandent or climbing, with nonclathrate scales at apices. Fronds are usually monomorphic, less often dimorphic, or sometimes scaly or glandular, but less commonly hairy. Petioles have numerous round, vascular bundles arranged in a ring, or rarely as few as three; the adaxial bundles are largest. Veins are pinnate or forking, free to variously anastomosing; the areoles occur with or without included veinlets; sori are usually round, acrostichoid (covering the entire abaxial surface of the lamina) in a few lineages; usually indusiate, or sometimes exindusiate. Indusia, when present, are round-reniform or peltate. Sporangia have three-rowed, short to long stalks; spores are reniform, monolete, perine or winged.

==Taxonomy==

=== History ===
In 1990, Karl U. Kramer and coauthors defined the Dryopteridaceae broadly to include the present family, as well as the Woodsiaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;, Onocleaceae, and most of Tectariaceae. Molecular phylogenetic studies found Kramer&#x27;s version of the Dryopteridaceae to be polyphyletic, and it was split up by Smith and others in 2006. The inclusion of &quot;Didymochlaena&quot;, &quot;Hypodematium&quot;, and &quot;Leucostegia&quot; in the Dryopteridaceae is doubtful. If these three are excluded, then the family is strongly supported as monophyletic in cladistic analyses. Some authors have already treated these genera as outside of the Dryopteridaceae.

In 2007, a phylogenetic study of DNA sequences showed that &quot;Pleocnemia&quot; should be transferred from the Tectariaceae to the Dryopteridaceae. In 2010, in a paper on bolbitidoid ferns, &quot;Arthrobotrya&quot; was resurrected from &quot;Teratophyllum&quot;. Later that year, &quot;Mickelia&quot; was described as a new genus.

Some species have been removed from the genus &quot;Oenotrichia&quot; because they do not belong there or even in the family Dennstaedtiaceae where &quot;Oenotrichia&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot; is placed. These species probably belong in the Dryopteridaceae, but have not yet been given a generic name.

In 2012, a phylogenetic study of &quot;Dryopteris&quot; and its relatives included &quot;Acrophorus&quot;, &quot;Acrorumohra&quot;, &quot;Diacalpe&quot;, &quot;Dryopsis&quot;, &quot;Nothoperanema&quot;, and &quot;Peranema&quot; within that genus. The &quot;Flora of China&quot; treatment of the family, published in 2013, used phylogenetic results to sink &quot;Lithostegia&quot; and &quot;Phanerophlebiopsis&quot; into &quot;Arachniodes&quot;.

The Dryopteridaceae , under the classification system of Christenhusz and Chase (2014), were submerged as subfamily Dryopteridoideae , one of eight subfamilies constituting family Polypodiaceae. This family corresponds to the clade eupolypods I. The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) retained the family.

===Phylogeny===
The following cladogram for the suborder Polypodiineae (eupolypods I), based on the consensus cladogram in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), shows a likely phylogenetic relationship between Dryopteridaceae and the other families of the clade.
=== Subdivision ===
The PPG I classification divides the family into three subfamilies, listed below.
* Subfamily Polybotryoideae 
** &quot;Cyclodium&quot; 
** &quot;Maxonia&quot; 
** &quot;Olfersia&quot; 
** &quot;Polybotrya&quot; 
** &quot;Polystichopsis&quot; 
** &quot;Stigmatopteris&quot; 
** &quot;Trichoneuron&quot; 
* Subfamily Elaphoglossoideae 
** &quot;Arthrobotrya&quot; 
** &quot;Bolbitis&quot; 
** &quot;Elaphoglossum&quot; 
** &quot;Lastreopsis&quot; 
** &quot;Lomagramma&quot; 
** &quot;Megalastrum&quot; 
** &quot;Mickelia&quot; 
** &quot;Parapolystichum&quot; 
** &quot;Pleocnemia&quot; 
** &quot;Rumohra&quot; 
** &quot;Teratophyllum&quot; 
* Subfamily Dryopteridoideae 
** &quot;Arachniodes&quot; 
** &quot;Ctenitis&quot; 
** &quot;Cyrtomium&quot; 
** &quot;Dryopteris&quot; 
** &quot;Phanerophlebia&quot; 
** &quot;Polystichum&quot; 

&quot;Didymochlaena&quot; has been removed to Didymochlaenaceae, and &quot;Hypodematium&quot; and &quot;Leucostegia&quot; to Hypodematiaceae. &quot;Aenigmopteris&quot; has at times been suggested to belong to this family, on the grounds of its morphological similarity to &quot;Ctenitis&quot;, but molecular phylogeny has led to its submersion within &quot;Tectaria&quot; (Tectariaceae). &quot;Dryopolystichum&quot; has been placed in Lomariopsidaceae.

<text>Molding (American English) or moulding (British and Commonwealth English; see spelling differences) is the process of manufacturing by shaping liquid or pliable raw material using a rigid frame called a mold or matrix. This itself may have been made using a pattern or model of the final object.

A mold or mould is a hollowed-out block that is filled with a liquid or pliable material such as plastic, glass, metal, or ceramic raw material. The liquid hardens or sets inside the mold, adopting its shape. A mold is a counterpart to a cast. The very common bi-valve molding process uses two molds, one for each half of the object.

Articulated molds have multiple pieces that come together to form the complete mold, and then disassemble to release the finished casting; they are expensive, but necessary when the casting shape has complex overhangs.

Piece-molding uses a number of different molds, each creating a section of a complicated object. This is generally only used for larger and more valuable objects.

[[Blow molding]] is a manufacturing process for forming and joining hollow plastic or glass parts.

A manufacturer who makes molds is called a [[moldmaker]]. A release agent is typically used to make removal of the hardened/set substance from the mold more easily effected. Typical uses for molded plastics include molded furniture, molded household goods, molded cases, and structural materials. 

== Types ==
There are several types of molding methods. These include:

*Casting, the oldest term, covering a wide range of materials, especially metals
*Blow molding
*Powder metallurgy plus sintering
*Compression molding
*Extrusion molding
*Injection molding
*Laminating
** Reaction injection molding
*Matrix molding
*Rotational molding (or Rotomolding)
*Spin casting
*Transfer molding
*Dry Molded Fiber/Dry molding
*Thermoforming
** Twin sheet thermoforming
** Vacuum forming, a simplified version of thermoforming
*FRP moulding
** Hand lay up moulding
** Resin transfer moulding
** Vacuum bag moulding
** Bladder moulding
** Spray up molding
** Reaction injection molding

<text>BBYO is a Jewish teen movement, organized as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and headquartered in Washington, D.C. The organization is intended to build the identity of Jewish teens and offer leadership development programs.

On June 19, 2001, the movement split from B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith International, which had been its parent organization, to become incorporated as B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Youth Organization Inc.

BBYO is organized into local fraternity- and sorority-like chapters. Male chapters are known as AZA chapters and their members are known as Alephs and female chapters as BBG chapters, and their members are known as BBGs. AZA and BBG were independent organizations (beginning in 1924 and 1944 respectively) before becoming brother and sister organizations under B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. In some communities, there are co-ed BBYO chapters that borrow traditions from both organizations.

==History==
===Early days of BBYO===

AZA&#x27;s original advisor, Nathan Mnookin, soon left Omaha for his hometown of Kansas City, where he started a similar group with the same name. The Omaha group selected a new advisor, Sam Beber, who soon laid out his plans for an international youth movement based on the local AZA model. On May 3, 1924, the Aleph Tzadik Aleph for Young Men, now an international Jewish fraternity, was formed according to Kubo&#x27;s plan, with the Omaha and Kansas City chapters receiving the first two charters. Four chapters were in attendance at the first convention in June 1924, and ten at the second convention the following summer.

By 1925, AZA had expanded east with dozens of chapters across the country. At Beber&#x27;s urging, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith took up the issue of officially adopting AZA as its junior auxiliary at their national convention in 1925. Supported by Henry Monsky, who himself was vying for the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith presidency, the convention adopted a committee report affirming its approval of the organization under B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith&#x27;s jurisdiction. Immediately following the convention, the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Executive Committee met and officially adopted AZA, which then became known as the Aleph Zadik Aleph of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith.

===BBYO&#x27;s beginnings===
In 1944, after a few past failed attempts to begin a Jewish youth group for young women, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Girls (BBG) became officially recognized and adopted by B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. Anita Perlman is credited with the development of BBG as Sam Beber is credited with the AZA. For the first time, AZA and BBG were united under a single organization, officially cementing their relationship and brother and sister organizations. Combined, the two youth movements were called the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Youth Organization, and BBYO was born.

===From past to present with BBYO===
After more than 75 years of general prosperity, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith began a massive restructuring at the turn of the 21st century in response to the changing face of North American Jewry. As a result, what was then the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Youth Organization split from B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith and, on June 19, 2001, it was incorporated as B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Youth Organization Inc., a separate nonprofit organization. The new organization received substantial funding from the Charles and Lynn Schusterman Family Philanthropies, and it was chaired by Lynn Schusterman.

Traditionally, BBYO was a conglomeration of many largely independent regions. This was the result of the modification of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith&#x27;s long-standing &quot;district&quot; model. As new forms of communication have brought the members and staff of BBYO in closer contact, and as the differences between geographic regions continue to deteriorate, BBYO has become much more of a top-down organization, with standardized marketing materials and directives. BBYO has reached into the online market with its b-linked.org website, into the middle school market with its BBYO Connect programs, and the adult market with its Friends &amp; Alumni Network. 

On February 15-19, 2024 BBYO held its Intentional Convention in Orlando, Florida. This convention marked its 100th year as a youth organization for the AZA (Boys) and 80th year for BBG&#x27;s (girls). The organization is active in more than seventy regions in Europe, South Africa, Australia, and North America. As of 2024, BBYO has more than 700 chapters in fifty counties, with 70,000 members and over 350,000 alumni.

== Symbols ==
BBYO&#x27;s core values or pillars are Inclusivity, Jewish Identity, Active Leadership, and Tradition. The color red is associated with its sorority B’nai B’rith Girls, while blue is associated with its boy&#x27;s fraternity Aleph Zadik Aleph. Red symbolizes the member&#x27;s passion for the organization. Blue represents loyalty, trust, and wisdom.

== Organizational model ==
BBYO is organized into local fraternity- and sorority-like chapters. Male chapters are known as AZA chapters and their members are called Alephs. Female chapters are known as BBG chapters, their members are called BBGs. AZA and BBG were independent organizations (beginning in 1924 and 1944 respectively) before becoming brother and sister organizations under B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. In some communities, there are co-ed BBYO chapters that borrow traditions from both organizations.

<doc id="605222" wikidata="Q219865" url="?curid=605222" title="Zone (band)">
<text>was an all-female rock band started in Sapporo, Japan, in 1997. It started as a dance group and turned into an all-female band. Zone has been categorized in a new genre called &quot;bandol&quot; (a portmanteau of the words &quot;band&quot; and &quot;idol&quot;). The band was started and managed by Studio RunTime and its first single, &quot;Good Days&quot;, was released by the major record label Sony Records, on February 7, 2001. The group officially disbanded on March 2, 2013.

Zone&#x27;s most famous song is &quot;Secret Base (Kimi ga Kureta Mono)&quot;, released on August 8, 2001. It sold about 744,000 copies in Japan.

== History ==
Zone started with eight members in 1997, then reduced to six and finally to four – Miyu Nagase, Mizuho Saito, Maiko Sakae and Takayo Ookoshi – by the time it released its first indie disc in 1999.

Tadayuki Ominami, a representative of Sony Records, noticed that the crowd reaction at the group&#x27;s first concert was particularly enthusiastic. Initially, Zone was solely focused on singing and dancing. Ominami watched a live video of the band playing with instruments at the KomeKome Klub and felt that, due to the overabundance of dance groups, Zone had the makings of a breakthrough act, provided they could play their instruments as well as sing and dance.

In late 2003, Ookoshi announced her departure from Zone to pursue her studies and was replaced by Tomoka Nishimura, one of the two original members cut from the band when it was reduced from six members to four.

Between 1999 and 2005, Zone released 17 hit singles, three full-length CDs and three DVDs, appeared in commercials and a television special, in addition to attending high school. They all graduated.

Zone officially disbanded on April 1, 2005, after playing a final concert at Nippon Budokan. On April 13, a greatest hits album, &quot;E: Complete A Side Singles&quot;, was released. The album entered the charts at number 1 with first-week sales of about 98,000 copies, the band&#x27;#s first number-one album on the Japanese Oricon charts.

In February 2011, Nagase, Sakae and Nishimura announced that they would be reuniting (without Saito) for the 10th anniversary of &quot;Secret Base&quot;. The group released &quot;Zone Tribute&quot; in August and made several concert appearances. In November, Nishimura announced that she would be leaving the band for health reasons. Nagase and Sakae continued as a duo, and released &quot;Treasure of the Heart&quot; in June 2012.

In February 2013, Nagase&#x27;s contract with RunTime Music Agency was dissolved with the company claiming &quot;immoral behaviour&quot; and &quot;frequent non-fulfillment of duties&quot;. On March 2, Maiko posted on the official website for RunTime Entertainment that she would be ending ZONE.

<text>Clara Bowdoin Winthrop (March 12, 1876 – March 15, 1969) was an American philanthropist, art collector, and relative of John Kerry, a U.S. Senator and former presidential candidate. She was a member of the Winthrop family. 

== Life ==
Winthrop was born March 12, 1876 in Boston, Massachusetts, the older of two daughters, to Robert Charles Winthrop Jr. (1834–1905) and Elizabeth Winthrop (née Mason). She had a younger sister, Margaret Tyndal Winthrop (1880–1970), who married James Grant Forbes (1879–1955), of the Forbes family.

Her paternal grandfather was Robert C. Winthrop, hence she is a direct descendant of John Winthrop. As an adult, she was primarily known as a wealthy and childless philanthropist, funding the education of John Kerry, her sister&#x27;s grandson. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; wrote:
:&quot;&quot;Among the array of relatives who looked after John, none was more important to his education than great-aunt Clara Winthrop, who had no children of her own. She owned an estate in Manchester-by-the-Sea, complete with a bowling alley inside a red barn. Winthrop offered to pay for much of John&#x27;s prep school education, an expensive proposition far beyond the means of Kerry&#x27;s parents. &quot;It was a great and sweet and nice thing from an aunt who had no place to put [her money],&quot; Kerry said. Such a gift today might be worth about $30,000 per year, given the school&#x27;s typical annual cost before subsidies.&quot;&quot;
Winthrop was a world traveler, and is known to have visited India. While on a trip to Italy, Winthrop purchased an oil painting which was thought to be a reproduction of a work by Andrea del Sarto. In 1935 she donated the painting to the All Saints&#x27; Episcopal Church in West Newbury, Massachusetts. The painting hung over the choir stalls in an enormous gilt frame for several years until it was taken down and stored in a closet, and then in the rectory&#x27;s attic. In 1999, it was discovered that the painting was not an imitation, but was &quot;The Madonna and Child&quot; by del Sarto. The painting was then sold at auction by Sotheby&#x27;s for $1,102,500.

The Clara B. Winthrop Trust is named for her.

== Personal life ==
Winthrop was never married and had no children.

<text>Andrés Escobar Saldarriaga (; 13 March 1967 – 2 July 1994) was a Colombian professional footballer who played as a centre-back. He played for Atlético Nacional, BSC Young Boys, and the Colombia national team. Nicknamed &quot;The Gentleman&quot;, he was known for his clean style of play and calmness on the pitch.

On 2 July 1994, Escobar was murdered in the aftermath of the 1994 FIFA World Cup, reportedly as retaliation for having scored an own goal which contributed to Colombia&#x27;s elimination from the tournament. His murder further tarnished the image of the country internationally. Escobar himself had worked to promote a more positive image of Colombia, earning acclaim in the country.

Escobar is still held in high regard by Colombian fans, and is especially mourned and remembered by Atlético Nacional&#x27;s fans.

==Early life==
Andrés Escobar Saldarriaga was born in Medellín on 13 March 1967. He grew up in a middle-class family. He attended Colegio Calasanz and graduated from Instituto Conrado González. He participated in school football teams before becoming a professional football player.

His father is Darío Escobar, a banker who founded an organization that gives young people the opportunity to play football instead of being on the streets. His brother, Santiago, is a former footballer who played alongside Andrés at Atlético Nacional before moving into team management in 1998.

==Career==
Escobar was a defender throughout his career. His jersey number was 2, and he was known by the nicknames &quot;El Caballero del Fútbol&quot; (&quot;The Gentleman of Football&quot;) and &quot;The Immortal Number 2&quot;. In his club career, he played for Colombian club Atlético Nacional and Swiss club Young Boys. He helped Nacional to win the 1989 Copa Libertadores.

Prior to the 1994 World Cup, Escobar was reported to have been offered a contract by AC Milan.

===International career===

He made his debut for the Colombia national team on 30 March 1988, in a 3–0 win against Canada. His first appearance in an international competition took place at the 1988 Rous Cup, where he also scored the only goal of his career in a 1–1 draw against England.

He played four matches at the 1989 Copa América when he was 22 years old. The team was eliminated in the first round of the tournament. The same year, he also played in 1990 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches. The team finished as winners of Group 2, though had to enter the inter-confederation play-offs, where they beat Israel 1–0 on aggregate and qualified for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Escobar played in all of his country&#x27;s matches during the World Cup as they reached the round of 16, being eliminated after a 2–1 loss to Cameroon.

Escobar was called up for the 1991 Copa América squad, where he made seven appearances. He did not participate in any games of the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification, but he was called up for the World Cup.

==Own goal incident and subsequent murder==
Escobar&#x27;s own goal occurred in Colombia&#x27;s second group match against host nation the United States during the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Stretching to block a cross from American midfielder John Harkes, he inadvertently deflected the ball into his own net. This gave the U.S. a 1–0 lead in an eventual 2–1 victory. This meant that in order to advance to the next round, Colombia needed to defeat Switzerland in their final group match and also needed the United States to defeat Romania in the concurrent match in order to have a chance at advancing. Colombia would defeat Switzerland 2-0 but Romania&#x27;s 1–0 victory over the United States meant Colombia would be eliminated from the tournament finishing bottom of group A.

After the tournament, Escobar decided to return to Colombia instead of visiting relatives in Las Vegas, Nevada. On the evening of 1 July 1994, five days after the elimination of Colombia from the World Cup, Escobar called his friends, and they went to a bar in the El Poblado neighbourhood in Medellín. Then they went to a liquor store. Shortly afterwards, they arrived at the El Indio nightclub. His friends split up. At approximately 3:00 the next morning, Escobar was alone in the parking lot of El Indio, in his car, when three men appeared. They began arguing with him. Two of the men took out handguns. Escobar was shot six times with a .38 caliber pistol. It was reported that the killer shouted &quot;¡Gol!&quot; (&quot;Goal!&quot;) after every shot, once for each time a football commentator had said it during the broadcast. The group then drove away in a Toyota pick-up truck, leaving Escobar to bleed to death. Escobar was taken to the hospital where he died 45 minutes later. 

The murder was widely believed to be a punishment for the own goal. In the UK, the BBC issued a public apology after its football pundit Alan Hansen commented during the World Cup&#x27;s Round of 16 match between Argentina and Romania that &quot;The Argentine defender warrants shooting for a mistake like that,&quot; on 3 July, a day after the murder of Escobar.

Escobar&#x27;s funeral was attended by more than 120,000 people. Every year people honour Escobar by bringing photographs of him to matches. In July 2002, the city of Medellín unveiled a statue in honour of his memory.

Humberto Castro Muñoz, a drug cartel bodyguard in Colombia, was arrested on the night of 2 July 1994, confessing the next day to the killing of Escobar. Castro also worked as a driver for Santiago Gallón, who had allegedly lost heavily betting on the outcome of the game. He was found guilty of Escobar&#x27;s murder in June 1995. He was sentenced to 43 years in prison. The sentence was later reduced to 26 years because of his submitting to the ruling penal code in 2001. Castro was released on good behaviour due to further reductions from prison work and study in 2005. His three accomplices were acquitted.

There are also allegations that the Gallón brothers bribed the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office to redirect the investigation towards Castro as the triggerman – and the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office contends that Castro was simply following orders from the Gallón brothers – but prosecutors lacked credible evidence to convict them. Pamela Cascardo, Escobar&#x27;s girlfriend at the time of the murder, believes that the accusation of the Gallón brothers&#x27; bribery of government officials is supported by Castro&#x27;s having killed a national celebrity and serving only 11 years in prison.

In 2013, Francisco Maturana, a former coach of Escobar&#x27;s, denied that his murder had any connection to football or the World Cup, but rather was due to being &quot;in the wrong place at the wrong time&quot; at a violent time in Colombia&#x27;s history.

==Legacy==
Escobar&#x27;s murder tarnished the image of Colombia internationally. Escobar himself had worked to promote a more positive image of Colombia, earning acclaim within the country.

Escobar is still held in high regard by Colombian fans, and is especially mourned and remembered by Atlético Nacional&#x27;s fans. In a newspaper column published shortly before his killing, he said of Colombia&#x27;s World Cup, &quot;It’s been a most amazing and rare experience. We’ll see each other again soon because life does not end here.&quot;

After Escobar&#x27;s death, his family founded the Andrés Escobar Project to help disadvantaged children learn to play football. Prior to the 2001 Copa América hosted by Colombia, the city of Medellín unveiled a statue of Escobar.

==In popular culture==
In 1997, &quot;Mujer, Casos de la Vida Real&quot; aired an episode based on the assassination entitled &quot;Holocausto&quot;. This episode is now considered lost media.

In 2010, a documentary film titled &quot;The Two Escobars&quot; was released as a part of ESPN&#x27;s 30 for 30 documentary series. It was directed by Jeff and Michael Zimbalist, which looked back at Andrés Escobar&#x27;s death, Colombia&#x27;s 1994 World Cup run and the relationship between association football and the country&#x27;s criminal gangs, notably the Medellín Cartel run by Pablo Escobar (unrelated to Andrés).

In 2022, Netflix released a mini-series titled &quot;Goles en contra&quot; based on his life.

==Personal life==
Prior to his death, Escobar was engaged to his girlfriend for five years, a dentist named Pamela Cascardo. They would have been married later in 1994.
Escobar was a devout Catholic and would go to Mass every day before school with his mother until her death at the age of 52.

<text>Presidential elections were held in Macedonia on 14 April 2004, with a second round on 28 April. They followed the death in an air crash in February of incumbent President Boris Trajkovski.

Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski of the Social Democratic Union won the first round. As he failed to cross the 50% threshold, a second round was held in which he defeated Saško Kedev of Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity. In the immediate aftermath, Kedev alleged massive electoral fraud.

<text>An A1 broth is a liquid culture medium used in microbiology for the detection of fecal coliforms in foods, treated wastewater and seawater bays using the most probable number (MPN) method. It is prepared according to the formulation of Andrews and Presnell given below. It is used with a Durham tube, a positive tube being one that exhibits a trapped bubble of gas.

==Typical formula (g/L)==

==Directions==
Suspend the dry ingredients in one liter of cold distilled water. Gently heat until completely dissolved and distribute 9 mL into test tubes with an inverted Durham tube. Sterilize in an autoclave at 121°C for 15 minutes. If needed, prepare multi-strength broth weighing the appropriate quantity of the dry medium. The final pH is 6.9 ± 0.1.

==Widespread usage==
Variants of this test has been used for potable water across the globe, for example by the Cree community of Split Lake, Manitoba, by the Mapuche people of Maquehue, Chile and in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand

<doc id="605243" wikidata="Q195732" url="?curid=605243" title="Soul Train">
<text>Soul Train is an American musical variety television show. After airing locally on WCIU-TV in Chicago, Illinois, for a year, it aired in syndication from October 2, 1971, to March 25, 2006. In its 35-year history, the show primarily featured performances by R&amp;B, soul, and hip hop artists. The series was created by Don Cornelius, who also served as its first and longest-serving host and executive producer.

Production was suspended following the 2005–2006 season, with a rerun package under the moniker &quot;The Best of Soul Train&quot; airing for two years subsequently. As a nod to &quot;Soul Train&quot;″s longevity, the show&#x27;s opening sequence during later seasons contained a claim that it was the &quot;longest-running first-run, nationally syndicated program in American television history&quot;, with more than 1,100 episodes produced from the show&#x27;s debut through the 2005–2006 season. Despite the production hiatus, &quot;Soul Train&quot; held that superlative record until 2016, when &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; surpassed it in completing its 35th season. Among non-news programs, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; surpassed that mark in 2018.

As of 2016, the rights to the Soul Train brand, library, and associated events, such as its cruises and annual awards show, the Soul Train Music Awards, are now under the ownership of Paramount Global, through BET Networks.

==History==

===Chicago origins===
The origins of &quot;Soul Train&quot; can be traced to 1965 when WCIU-TV, an upstart UHF station in Chicago, began airing two youth-oriented dance programs: &quot;Kiddie-a-Go-Go&quot; and &quot;Red Hot and Blues&quot;. These programs—specifically the latter, which featured a predominantly African American group of in-studio dancers—would set the stage for what was to come to the station several years later.

Don Cornelius, a newsreader and backup disc jockey at Chicago radio station WVON, was hired by WCIU in 1967 as a news and sports reporter. Cornelius also was promoting and emceeing a touring series of concerts featuring local talent (sometimes called &quot;record hops&quot;) at Chicago-area high schools, calling his traveling caravan of shows &quot;The Soul Train&quot; and in 1970, allowed him the opportunity to bring his road show to television.

After securing a sponsorship deal with the Chicago-based retailer Sears, Roebuck and Company, &quot;Soul Train&quot; premiered on WCIU-TV on August 17, 1970, as a live show airing weekday afternoons. Beginning as a low-budget affair, in black and white, the first episode of the program featured Jerry Butler, the Chi-Lites, and the Emotions as guests. Cornelius was assisted by Clinton Ghent, a local professional dancer who appeared on early episodes before moving behind the scenes as a producer and secondary host.

===Move to syndication===

The program&#x27;s immediate success attracted the attention of another locally based firm—the Johnson Products Company (manufacturers of the Afro Sheen line of hair-care products)—and they later agreed to co-sponsor the program&#x27;s expansion into broadcast syndication. Cornelius and &quot;Soul Train&quot;″s syndicator targeted 25 markets outside of Chicago to carry the show, but stations in only seven other cities—Atlanta; Birmingham; Cleveland; Detroit; Houston; Los Angeles; and Philadelphia—purchased the program, which began airing on a weekly basis on October 2, 1971. By the end of the first season, &quot;Soul Train&quot; was on in the other eighteen markets.

At the time, there were no other commercial television programs being produced by black people for a black audience; the only nationally available show by blacks for blacks at the time was the public television series &quot;Soul!&quot; When the program moved into syndication, its home base was also shifted to Los Angeles, where it remained for the duration of its run. &quot;Soul Train&quot; was part of a national trend toward syndicated music-oriented programs targeted at niche audiences; two other network series (&quot;Hee Haw&quot; for country music, and &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; for traditional music) also entered syndication in 1971 and would go on to have long runs.

Though Don Cornelius moved his operations west, a local version of &quot;Soul Train&quot; continued in Chicago. Cornelius hosted both the local Chicago-based and national Los Angeles–based programs simultaneously, but soon focused his attention solely on the national edition. He continued to oversee production in Chicago, where Clinton Ghent hosted episodes on WCIU-TV until 1976, followed by three years of once-weekly reruns. The syndicated version was picked up in the Chicago market by CBS-owned WBBM-TV at its launch; the program moved to WGN-TV in 1977 and remained there for the rest of its Chicago run.

Don Cornelius hosted every episode of &quot;Soul Train&quot; from 1970 to 1993, except for Richard Pryor, who hosted the final episode of Season 4 (1974-1975). Beginning in Season 15 (1985-1986), Tribune Entertainment acquired the syndication contract; Tribune Entertainment continued producing &quot;Soul Train&quot; until the end of the show&#x27;s run on March 25, 2006.

===Later years===

Don Cornelius stopped hosting after 22 seasons (1971–1993), though he remained the show&#x27;s main creative force from behind the scenes. The following fall, &quot;Soul Train&quot; began using celebrity hosts until comedian Mystro Clark took over as the host in 1997. Shemar Moore took over as the host in 2000. In 2003, Dorian Gregory took over as the host, and stayed until the end of the show&#x27;s run in 2006.

===Cancellation===

Production of first-run &quot;Soul Train&quot; episodes was suspended at the conclusion of the 2005–06 season, the show&#x27;s 35th. In place of new content, for two seasons starting in the 2006–2007 season, the program aired archived episodes (selected from between 1973 and 1988) under the title &quot;The Best of Soul Train&quot;.

This was because in later years, Nielsen ratings dropped to below 1.0; most of the stations that aired &quot;Soul Train&quot; by that point were either Fox television affiliates or independent stations that would later become affiliates of The WB or UPN, and, in the process, some of the stations which had been airing &quot;Soul Train&quot; on Saturday afternoons started rescheduling the program to overnight time slots. The future of &quot;Soul Train&quot; was uncertain with the announced closing of Tribune Entertainment in December 2007, which left Don Cornelius Productions to seek a new distributor for the program. Cornelius soon secured a deal with Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media.

===Attempted revivals and new ownership===
When Don Cornelius Productions still owned the program, clips of the show&#x27;s performances and interviews were kept away from online video sites such as YouTube owing to copyright infringement claims. Cornelius also frowned upon the unauthorized distribution of &quot;Soul Train&quot; episodes through the sale of third-party VHS or DVD compilations.

In May 2008, Cornelius sold the rights to the &quot;Soul Train&quot; library to MadVision Entertainment, whose principal partners came from the entertainment and publishing fields. The price and terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, by the start of the 2008–09 television season, the Tribune Broadcasting-owned stations (including national carrier WGN America) that had been the linchpin of the show&#x27;s syndication efforts dropped the program, and many others followed suit. &quot;Soul Train″&quot;s website acknowledged that the program had ceased distribution on September 22, 2008.

Following the purchase by MadVision, the &quot;Soul Train&quot; archives were exposed to new forms of distribution. In April 2009, MadVision launched a &quot;Soul Train&quot; channel on YouTube. Three months later the company entered into a licensing agreement with Time Life to distribute &quot;Soul Train&quot; DVD sets. MadVision then came to terms with Paramount Global-owned BET to relaunch the &quot;Soul Train Music Awards&quot; for BET&#x27;s spin-off channel, Centric, in November 2009. Centric would broadcast archived episodes of the program. Archived episodes can also be seen on Bounce TV.

MadVision sold the rights to &quot;Soul Train&quot; in 2011 to a consortium led by basketball player Magic Johnson and backed by private equity firm InterMedia Partners. The Johnson-InterMedia consortium planned on a potential film project that Cornelius had briefly mentioned prior to selling the franchise, as well as producing potential stage adaptations and a cruise. As part of the sale, Johnson&#x27;s Aspire TV channel also began airing reruns of the series.

Cornelius continued to appear for &quot;Soul Train&quot; documentaries and ceremonies until his death by suicide in February 2012. In 2013, Centric began presenting a cruise-based revival, marketed as &quot;Soul Train Cruise&quot;.

All rights and trademarks to the &quot;Soul Train&quot; brand including the show&#x27;s extensive library, the annual cruise event, and the award shows are under the ownership of Paramount Global after its Paramount Media Networks division acquired the franchise in 2016.

===Influence===
Some commentators have called &quot;Soul Train&quot; a &quot;black &quot;American Bandstand&quot;&quot;, another long-running program with which &quot;Soul Train&quot; shares some similarities. Cornelius acknowledged &quot;Bandstand&quot; as a model for his program; as the years advanced and &quot;Soul Train&quot; evolved into a tradition in its own right, he tended to bristle at the &quot;Bandstand&quot; comparisons.

In 1973, Dick Clark, host and producer of &quot;Bandstand&quot;, launched &quot;Soul Unlimited&quot; — controversial for its pronounced racial overtures — to compete directly with &quot;Soul Train&quot;. Cornelius, with help from Jesse Jackson, openly accused Clark of trying to undermine TV&#x27;s only black-owned show. Agreeing, ABC canceled it after a few episodes. Clark later agreed to work with Cornelius on a series of network specials featuring R&amp;B and soul artists.

Cornelius was relatively conservative in his musical tastes and admitted he was not a fan of the emerging hip hop genre, believing that the genre did not reflect positively on African-American culture (one of his stated goals for the series). Even though Cornelius featured rap artists on &quot;Soul Train&quot; frequently during the 1980s, he publicly would admit to the artists&#x27; faces, such as Kurtis Blow, that the genre was one that he did not understand. As rap continued to move further toward hardcore hip hop, Cornelius admitted to being frightened by the antics of groups such as Public Enemy.

Rosie Perez testified in the 2010 VH1 documentary &quot;Soul Train: The Hippest Trip in America&quot; that Cornelius also disliked seeing the show&#x27;s dancers perform sexually suggestive &quot;East Coast&quot; dance moves. Cornelius admittedly had rap artists on the show only because the genre was becoming popular among his African-American audience, though the decision alienated middle-aged, more affluent African Americans like himself. This disconnect, which was openly mocked in an &quot;In Living Color&quot; sketch titled &quot;Old Train&quot;, where Cornelius and the show were lampooned as extremely old and out of touch, eventually led to Cornelius stepping down as host in the early 1990s, and the show losing its influence.

Questlove, drummer for hip-hop band The Roots and a fan of the program, authored a book chronicling &quot;Soul Train&quot;. Titled &quot;Soul Train: The Music, Dance, and Style of a Generation&quot; was published in 2013.

==Program elements==
The opening sequence showed a black animated locomotive with multicolored smoke coming out of its smokestack, and steam coming out of its sides, passing through a city, tunnel, or through outer space around the Earth. The scenery around the train changed as years went on. The Soul Train logo was featured, with a song or instrumental playing throughout. One of the most distinctive parts of the opening was when “Soul Train” was announced, stretching out the first word into a high-pitched imitation of a train whistle.

Within the structure of the program, there were two enduring elements. The first was the &quot;Soul Train Scramble Board&quot;, where two dancers are given 60 seconds to unscramble a set of letters that form the name of that show&#x27;s performer or a notable person in African American history. In describing the person&#x27;s renown, the host concluded their description with the phrase &quot;...whose name you should know&quot;. Cornelius openly admitted after the series ended its run that the game was usually set up so everybody won in an effort not to cause embarrassment for the show or African Americans in general.

===Soul Train line===
There was also the popular &quot;Soul Train Line&quot; (a variant of the 1950s fad then known as The Stroll), in which all the dancers form two lines with a space in the middle for dancers to strut down and dance in consecutive order. Originally, this consisted of a couple—with men on one side and women on the other. In later years, men and women had their own individual lineups. Sometimes, new dance styles or moves were featured or introduced by particular dancers. In addition, there was an in-studio group of dancers who danced along to the music as it was being performed.

Rosie Perez, Damita Jo Freeman, Darnell Williams, Cheryl Song, Louie &quot;Ski&quot; Carr, Alfie Lewis, Pat Davis (&quot;Madam Butterfly&quot;), Alise Mekhail, Andrea N. Miles, Carmen Electra, Nick Cannon, Vivica A. Fox, MC Hammer, Jermaine Stewart, Heather Hunter, Fred Berry, Laurieann Gibson, Pebbles, and NFL legend Walter Payton were among those who got noticed dancing on the program over the years. Two former dancers, Jody Watley and Jeffrey Daniel, enjoyed years of success as members of the R&amp;B group Shalamar after they were chosen by &quot;Soul Train&quot; talent booker/record promoter Dick Griffey and Cornelius to replace the group&#x27;s original session singers in 1978.

===Guest stars===
Each musical guest usually performed twice on each program; after their first number, they were joined by the program host onstage for a brief interview. From time to time, stand-up comedians, such as Tom Dreesen (whom Don Cornelius knew from his time in Chicago) and Franklyn Ajaye (known in the 1970s for being a star of the hit movie &quot;Car Wash&quot;), would be featured on the program to perform a brief comedy routine.

&quot;Soul Train&quot; was also known for two popular catchphrases, referring to itself as the &quot;Hippest trip in America&quot; at the beginning of the show and closing the program with &quot;...and you can bet your last money, it&#x27;s all gonna be a stone gas, honey. I&#x27;m Don Cornelius, and, as always in parting, we wish you love, peace...and SOUL!&quot;

In 2019, BET selected various historic guest stars as &quot;Most Memorable Soul Train Performances&quot;. The list included Gladys Knight and The Jackson 5, among others.

==UK version==

In 1985, Cornelius gave permission for a version of the show in the United Kingdom. The UK version, hosted by former &quot;Soul Train&quot; dancer and member of Shalamar Jeffrey Daniel, was titled &quot;620 Soul Train&quot; and ran for one series on Channel 4.

==Spinoffs==

In 1987, &quot;Soul Train&quot; launched the &quot;Soul Train Music Awards&quot;, which honors the top performances in R&amp;B, hip hop, and gospel music (and, in its earlier years, jazz music) from the previous year.

&quot;Soul Train&quot; then produced the short-lived &quot;Soul Train Comedy Awards&quot; in 1993, which discontinued that same year.

&quot;Soul Train&quot; later created two additional annual specials: &quot;The Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards&quot;, first airing in 1995, celebrated top achievements by female performers; and the &quot;Soul Train Christmas Starfest&quot;, which premiered in 1998, featured holiday music performed by a variety of R&amp;B and gospel artists. Award categories for the &quot;Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards&quot; presented to female recipients included:

*Best R&amp;B/Soul Album of the Year, Solo
*Best R&amp;B/Soul Album of the Year, Group or Duo
*Best R&amp;B/Soul Song of the Year
*Best R&amp;B/Soul Single, Solo
*Best R&amp;B/Soul Single, Group or Duo
*Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap New Artist
*Best Jazz Album
*Best Gospel Album
*Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Music Video

Special awards were given
*Aretha Franklin Award for Entertainer of the Year and 
*Lena Horne Award for Outstanding Career Achievements.

The &quot;Lady of Soul Awards&quot; and &quot;Christmas Starfest&quot; programs last aired in 2005, before emerging again years later. In April 2008, Don Cornelius announced that year&#x27;s &quot;Soul Train Music Awards&quot; ceremony had been canceled. Cornelius cited 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike by the Writers Guild of America as one of the reasons, though a main factor may have been the uncertainty surrounding &quot;Soul Train&quot;&#x27;s future. Cornelius also announced that a motion picture based on the program was in development. Subsequent owners of the franchise have followed their own agenda for the program, which included a revival of the &quot;Soul Train Music Awards&quot; in 2009.

In November 2023, the &quot;Soul Train Spirit of Soul&quot; presentation was resurrected; singer Janelle Monáe was cited for its &quot;Spirit of Soul&quot; award.

==Homage==
The 2024 fantasy-comedy film &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot; includes a sequence that pays direct homage to the show, including a group of people in the afterlife dancing on a train platform as they await the arrival of the &quot;Soul Train&quot;, conducted by a entity strongly resembling Cornelius as music evocative of &quot;Soul Train&#x27;s&quot; theme plays on the soundtrack.

==Theme music==
&quot;Soul Train&quot; used various original and current music for theme songs during its run, including
* 1971–1973: &quot;Hot Potato&quot; by the Rinkydinks, produced in 1962 by Bobby and Danny Robinson and written by King Curtis. It was later redone by The Rimshots as &quot;Soul Train, Parts 1 &amp; 2&quot;. 
* 1973–1975: &quot;TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)&quot;, composed by Gamble and Huff and recorded by MFSB with vocals by The Three Degrees. Released as a single, this song became a pop and R&amp;B radio hit in 1974 and the show&#x27;s best-known theme.
* 1975–1976: &quot;Soul Train &#x27;75&quot;, by The Soul Train Gang, which was later released as a single for the newly formed SOLAR Records
* 1976–1978: &quot;Soul Train &#x27;76 (Get On Board)&quot;, by The Soul Train Gang
* 1978–1980: &quot;Soul Train Theme &#x27;79&quot;, produced by the Hollywood Disco Jazz Band with vocals by the Waters
* 1980–1983: &quot;Up On Soul Train&quot;, first by the Waters and later by The Whispers, whose version appears in their 1980 album &quot;Imagination.&quot;
* 1983–1987: &quot;Soul Train&#x27;s a Comin&#x27;&quot;, by R&amp;B artist O&#x27;Bryan
* 1987–1993: &quot;TSOP &#x27;87&quot;, a remake of the original &quot;TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia),&quot; composed and produced by George Duke
* 1989–1993: &quot;TSOP &#x27;89&quot;, a remixed version of &quot;TSOP &#x27;87&quot;, by George Duke
* 1993–1999: &quot;Soul Train &#x27;93&quot; (Know You Like to Dance)&quot;, by Naughty by Nature with a saxophone solo by Everette Harp
* 2000–2006: &quot;TSOP 2000&quot;, with rap vocals by Samson and music by Dr. Freeze, and again featuring an Everette Harp saxophone solo. However, a portion of &quot;Know You Like to Dance&quot; was still used in the show&#x27;s second-half opening segment during this period, though in earlier episodes, a portion of &quot;TSOP 2000&quot; was played.

<text>The Narmada River, previously also known as &quot;Narbada&quot; or anglicised as &quot;Nerbudda&quot;, is the 5th longest river in India and overall the longest west-flowing river in the country. It is also the largest flowing river in the state of Madhya Pradesh. This river flows through the states of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat in India. It is also known as the &quot;Lifeline of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat&quot; due to its huge contribution to the two states in many ways. The Narmada River rises from the Amarkantak Plateau in Anuppur district in Madhya Pradesh. It forms the traditional boundary between North and South India and flows westwards for before draining through the Gulf of Khambhat into the Arabian Sea, west of Bharuch city of Gujarat.

It is one of only two major rivers in peninsular India that runs from east to west (longest west flowing river), along with the Tapti River. It is one of the rivers in India that flows in a rift valley, bordered by the Satpura and Vindhya ranges. As a rift valley river, the Narmada does not form a delta; Rift valley rivers form estuaries. Other rivers which flow through the rift valley include the Damodar River in Chota Nagpur Plateau and Tapti. The Tapti River and Mahi River also flow through rift valleys, but between different ranges. It flows through the states of Madhya Pradesh (), and Maharashtra, (), () (actually along the border between Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra () and then the border between Maharashtra and Gujarat () and in Gujarat ().

The Periplus Maris Erythraei (c. 80 AD) called the river the Namnadius (Ναμνάδιος), Ptolemy called it Namadus (Νάμαδος) and Namades (Ναμάδης) and the British Raj called it the Nerbudda or Narbada. Narmada is a Sanskrit word meaning &quot;The Giver of Pleasure&quot;&quot;.&quot;

== Course ==


The source of the Narmada is a small reservoir, known as the Narmada Kund. It is located at Amarkantak on the Amarkantak Plateau in the Anuppur District on Shahdol zone of eastern Madhya Pradesh. The river descends from Sonmuda, then falls over a cliff as Kapildhara waterfall and meanders in the hills, flowing through a tortuous course crossing the rocks and islands up to the ruined palace of Ramnagar. Between Ramnagar and Mandla, (), further southeast, the course is comparatively straight with deep water devoid of rocky obstacles. The Banger joins from the left. The river then runs north–west in a narrow loop towards Jabalpur. Close to this city, after a fall of some (), called the Dhuandhara, the fall of mist, it flows for (), in a deep narrow channel through the magnesium limestone and basalt rocks called the Marble Rocks; from a width of about , above, it is compressed in this channel of (), only. Beyond this point up to its meeting the Arabian Sea, the Narmada enters three narrow valleys between the Vindhya scarps in the north and the Satpura range in the South. The southern extension of the valley is wider at most places. These three valley sections are separated by the closely approaching line of the scarps and the Satpura hills.
Emerging from the Marble Rocks the river enters its first fertile basin, which extends about , with an average width of , in the south. In the north, the valley is limited to the Barna–Bareli plain terminating at Barkhara Hills opposite Narmadapuram. However, the hills again recede in the Kannod plains. The banks are about () high. It is in the first valley of the Narmada that many of its important tributaries from the south join it and bring the waters of the northern slopes of the Satpura Hills. Among them are: the Sher River, Shakkar River, the Dudhi River, the Tawa (biggest tributary) and the Ganjal. The Hiran, the Barna, the Choral, the Karam and the Lohar are the important tributaries joining from the north.

Below Handia and Nemawar to Hiran fall (the deer&#x27;s leap), the river is approached by hills from both sides. In this stretch the character of the river is varied. Omkareshwar, sacred to Shiva is an important place of worship in Madhya Pradesh. At first, the descent is rapid and the stream, quickening in pace, rushes over a barrier of rocks. The Sikta and the Kaveri join it below the Khandwa plain. At two points, at Mandhar, about below Nemawar, and Dadrai, further down near Punasa, the river falls over a height of about .
A few kilometres further down in Barwaha the Narmada enters the Mandleshwar plain, the second basin about long and wide in the south. The northern strip of the basin is only . The second valley section is broken only by Saheshwar Dhara fall. The early course of about up to Markari falls is met with a succession of cataracts and rapids from the elevated table land of Malwa to the low level of Gujarat plain. Towards the west of this basin, the hills draw very close but soon dwindle down.

Below Makrai, the river flows between Vadodara district and Narmada district and then meanders through the rich plain of Bharuch district of Gujarat state. The banks are high between the layers of old alluvial deposits, hardened mud, gravels of nodular limestone and sand. The width of the river spans from about at Makrai to near Bharuch and to an estuary of at the Gulf of Cambay. An old channel of the river, to south from the present one, is very clear below Bharuch. The Karanjan and the Orsing are the most important tributaries in the original course. The former joins at Rundh and the latter at Vyas in Vadodara district of Gujarat, opposite each other and form a Triveni (confluence of three rivers) on the Narmada. The Amaravati and the Bhukhi are other tributaries of significance. Opposite the mouth of the Bhukhi is a large drift called Alia Bet or Kadaria Bet.

The tidal rise is felt up to above Bharuch, where the neap tides rise to about a metre and spring tide . The river is navigable for vessels of the burthen of 95 tonnes (i.e., 380 Bombay candies) up to Bharuch and for vessels up to 35 tonnes (140 Bombay candies) up to Shamlapitha or Ghangdia. The small vessels (10 tonnes) voyage up to Tilakawada in Gujarat. There are sand bases and shoals at mouth and at Bharuch. The nearby island of Kabirvad, in the Narmada River, features a gigantic Banyan tree, which covers .

== Narmada basin ==

The Narmada basin, hemmed between Vindhya and Satpura ranges, extends over an area of and lies on the northern extremity of the Deccan Plateau. The basin covers large areas in the states of Madhya Pradesh (82%), Gujarat (12%) and a comparatively smaller area in Maharashtra (4%) and in Chhattisgarh (2%). 60% of the basin is made up of arable land, 35% is forest cover and 5% is made up of other types of land such as grassland or wasteland. In the entire course of the river of , there are 41 tributaries, out of which 22 are from the Satpura range and the rest on the right bank are from the Vindhya range. Dhupgarh (1,350 m), near Pachmarhi is the highest point of the Narmada basin.

The basin has five well defined physiographic regions. They are:(1) The upper hilly areas covering parts of Anuppur, Mandla, Dindori, Balaghat and Seoni, (2) The upper plains covering parts of Jabalpur, Narsinghpur, Chhindwara, Narmadapuram, Betul, Harda, Raisen and Sehore districts, (3) The middle plains covering parts of Khandwa, Khargone, Dewas, Indore and Dhar, (4) The lower hilly areas covering parts of Barwani, Alirajpur, Nandurbar, Chhota Udepur and Narmada, and (5) the lower plains covering mainly the districts of Narmada, Bharuch, and parts of Vadodara district. The hill regions are well forested. The upper, middle and lower plains are broad and fertile areas, well suited for cultivation. The Narmada basin mainly consists of black soils. The coastal plains in Gujarat are composed of alluvial clays with a layer of black soils on the surface.

The valley experiences extremes of hydrometeorological and climatic conditions with the upper catchment having an annual precipitation in the range of to and with half or even less than half in its lower regions (–); the diversity of vegetation from lush green in the upper region to dry deciduous teak forest vegetation in the lower region is testimony to this feature.

== Geology ==
About 160 million years ago, the supercontinent Pangea broke into two large masses. The northern part was Laurasia and the southern continental mass was Gondwana. Between the two continents, a large sea, Tethys existed. Presently the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau have taken the position of the ancient Tethys Ocean. The Gondwana was intruded by few large marine transgressions. A deep gulf or sea existed along the Sindh-Baluchistan and Kutch. At one time, a marine ravine penetrated the very centre of Peninsular India through a narrow inlet along the present valley of Narmada. During this time India was divided into two halves by narrow strips of marine transgressions and there was no land communication between the Peninsular and northern India. Along the Narmada Valley, several patches of sediments have been deposited which contains ancient remains of animals. These fossils are similar to those found along the tracts of Tapi river. Such similarity probably suggests that even about 3 million years ago, Narmada and Tapi were confluent and the separate fate of these two rivers was decided by recent earth movements. The Bhedaghat falls of Narmada, near Jabalpur, was probably created during one such movement. The Narmada Valley is a graben, a layered block of the Earth&#x27;s crust that dropped down relative to the blocks on either side due to ancient spreading of the Earth&#x27;s crust. Two normal faults, known as the Narmada North fault and Narmada South fault, parallel to the river&#x27;s course, and mark the boundary between the Narmada block and the Vindhya and Satpura blocks or Horsts which rose relative to the Narmada Graben. The Narmada&#x27;s watershed includes the northern slopes of the Satpuras, and the steep southern slope of the Vindhyas, but not the Vindhyan tableland, the streams from which flow into the Ganges and Yamuna.

== Significance in Hinduism ==


Like the Ganges, the Narmada River is a goddess and a river in Hinduism. The Matsya Purana states that all of the banks along the Narmada are sacred. Ptolemy called the Narmada River &#x27;Nammadus&#x27; and the author of the Periplus called it &#x27;Nammadios.&#x27;

There are many stories about the origin of the Narmada River. According to the Rewa Khand, the Narmada was created from Shiva&#x27;s perspiration while he was performing penance on Mount Riksha. Due to this, the Narmada River is known as Shiva&#x27;s daughter. In another legend, two teardrops fell from the eyes of Brahma, the creator of the universe, which yielded two rivers – the Narmada and the Son.

Narmada is also considered sacred because of the pebbles known as banalinga that are found on the river bed. The pebbles are made up of white quartz and are linga shaped. They are believed to be the personified form of Shiva and there is a popular saying, &quot;Narmada Ke Kanker utte Sankar&quot; which means that &#x27;Shiva is in the pebbles of Narmada&#x27;.

Adi Shankara met his guru Govinda Bhagavatpada in Omkareshwar, a town on the banks of the Narmada.

Narmada is also said to have been engaged with the Sonbhadra, another river flowing on the Chota Nagpur Plateau. According to the Puranas, the Narmada is also called the Reva, from its leaping motion (from the root &#x27;rev&#x27;) through its rocky bed.

The Narmada River is also worshipped as mother goddess Muktidayani, or liberating mother.

The importance of the Narmada River as sacred is testified by the fact that the pilgrims perform a holy pilgrimage of a parikrama or circumambulation of the river. The Narmada Parikrama, as it is called, is considered to be a meritorious act that a pilgrim can undertake. Many sadhus and pilgrims walk on foot from the Arabian Sea at Bharuch in Gujarat, along the river, to the source in Maikal Mountains (Amarkantak hills) in Madhya Pradesh and back along the opposite bank of the river. It is a walk. The spiritual journey is usually taken for 3 years, 3 months and 13 days and the pilgrims are stipulated not to cross the river at any point of time. Important towns of interest in the valley are Jabalpur, Barwaha, Narmadapuram, Harda, Narmada Nagar, Omkareshwar, Dewas (Nemavar, Kity, Pipri), Mandla and Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh, and Rajpipla and Bharuch in Gujarat. Some places of historical interest are Chausath Yogini Temple, Joga Ka Quilla, Chhatri of Baji Rao Peshwa and Bhimbetka, and among the falls are the Dhuandhar Falls, Dugdhdhara, Dhardi falls, Kapiladhara and Sahastradhara.

== Ecology ==


The lower Narmada River Valley and the surrounding uplands, covering an area of consists of dry deciduous forests. The ecoregion lies between moister forests to the northeast, southeast, and southwest, which receive greater rainfall from the southeast monsoon, and the drier forests and scrublands of the Deccan to the south and Malwa and Gujarat to the west and northwest. The natural vegetation of the region is a three–tiered forest. &quot;Tectona grandis&quot; is the dominant canopy tree, in association with &quot;Diospyros melanoxylon&quot;, Dhaora (&quot;Anogeissus latifolia&quot;), &quot;Lagerstroemia parviflora&quot;, &quot;Terminalia tomentosa&quot;, &quot;Lannea coromandelica&quot;, &quot;Hardwickia binata&quot; and &quot;Boswellia serrata&quot;. Riparian areas along the regions&#x27; rivers and streams, which receive yearg– round water, are home to moist evergreen forests, whose dominant tree species are &quot;Terminalia arjuna&quot;, &quot;Syzygium cumini&quot; (Jambul), &quot;Syzygium&quot; &quot;Heyneanum&quot;, &quot;Salix tetrasperma&quot;, &quot;Homonoia riparia&quot;, and &quot;Vitex negundo&quot;.

The ecoregion is home to 76 species of mammals and to 276 bird species, none of which are endemic. About 30% of the ecoregion is covered in relatively intact vegetation. The ecoregion includes some large blocks of habitat in the Vindhya and Satpura ranges. About 5% of the ecoregion lies within protected areas, including Bandhavgarh, Panna, and Sanjay National Parks.

Some of the important national parks and wild life sanctuaries in the valley are the following: Kanha National Park located in the upper reaches of Narmada, about from Mandla, boasts of several wild animals including the Tiger. Two tributaries of Narmada, namely, Sulkum and Banjar, flow through this park. It is one of the best National Parks of Asia, which has been described vividly by Rudyard Kipling in his famous creation &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

Satpura National Park, set up in 1981, is located in Narmadapuram district of Madhya Pradesh. Its name is derived from Satpura hill ranges (Mahadeo hills) and covers an area of and along with the adjoining Bori and Panchmarhi Sanctuaries, provides of unique central Indian Highland ecosystem. Satpura National Park, being part of a unique ecosystem, is very rich in biodiversity. The fauna comprises tiger, leopard, sambar, chital, bhedki, nilgai, four-horned antelope, chinkara, gaur, wild boar, wild dog, sloth bear, black buck, fox, porcupine, flying squirrel, mouse deer, Indian giant squirrel. There are a variety of birds. Hornbill and peafowl are the common birds. The flora of the national park consists of mainly sal, teak, tendu, aonla, mahua, bael, bamboo, and a variety of grasses and medicinal plants.

Forest areas outside protected areas are also quite rich in floral and faunal diversity.

Mandla Plant Fossils National Park, Dindori National fossils park Ghughuya is situated in Dindori district of Madhya Pradesh in India. This national park has plants in fossil form that existed in India anywhere between 40 million and 150 million years ago spread over seven villages of Mandla District (Ghuguwa, Umaria, Deorakhurd, Barbaspur, Chanti-hills, Chargaon and Deori Kohani). The Mandla Plant Fossils National Park is an area that spreads over . Such fossils are found in three other villages of the district also, but they lie outside the national park.

The Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve covers part of three civil districts viz., Narmadapuram, Betul and Chhindwara of Madhya Pradesh. The total area is . It envelops three wildlife conservation units viz., Bori Sanctuary (518.00 km2), Satpura National Park (), and Pachmarhi Sanctuary (). Satpura National Park comprises the core zone and the remaining area of ), surrounding the core zone serves as buffer zone. The area comprises 511 villages. The area exhibits variety of geological rock and soil formations. There is a wide spectrum of floral and faunal features that occupy the Satpura conservation area. It is one of the oldest forest reserves, which has an established tradition of scientific management of forests. It constitutes a large contiguous forest block that harbours a community of plant and animal species typical of the central highland region.

Apart from the above national parks, there are also a number of natural preserves such as the Amarkantak, the Bagh Caves and the Bhedaghat. In compliance of the Environmental Action Plan for the Narmadasagar and Omkareswar HEPs, as per the recommendations of the Wildlife Institute of India three new protected areas may be created, which are, a) the Narmada National Park (496.70 km2), b) the Surmanya Sanctuary (126.67 km2) and c) Omkareshwar Sanctuary (119.96 km2) comprising a total area of .

Shoolpaneshwar Sanctuary in Gujarat, near the Sardar Sarovar dam site, previously called the Dumkal Sloth Bear Sanctuary (old sanctuary has been expanded four times) now covers an area of about , comprises a major watershed feeding the Sardar Sarovar and Karjan reservoir (on the Karjan River, a tributary of Narmada in Gujarat). It is the habitat of mammals and a variety of birds, including eagles and hawks.

== Anthropological and archaeological sites ==
The development of the Narmada river has led to the inundation of some archaeological and architectural sites. The Department of Archaeology, Museums and Archives, Government of Madhya Pradesh, undertook rescue excavations in response, and transplanted a number of temples. An attempt to comprehensively list and publish lost sites has been undertaken by Jürgen Neuss. Many Dinosaur fossils have been found in the Narmada valley. The first dinasaur fossil in India was discovered in 1828 by William Sleeman at Jabalpur. In 1982 fossil remains of &quot;Rajasaurus narmadensis&quot;, which lived in the Cretaceous Period, was discovered.

== River development ==
The Narmada river has a huge water resources potential, as much as of average annual flow (more than 90% of this flow occurring during the monsoon months of June – September), which according to estimates is greater than the combined annual flows of the Ravi, Beas and the Sutlej rivers, which feed the Indus basin. The 75% dependable flow is .

=== Sardar Sarovar Dam ===
As one of the 30 dams planned on river Narmada, the Sardar Sarovar Dam is the largest structure to be built. It is the second largest concrete dam in the world in terms of the volume of concrete used in its construction, after the Grand Coulee Dam across the Columbia River, US. It is a part of the Narmada Valley Project, a large hydraulic engineering project involving the construction of a series of large irrigation and hydroelectricity multi-purpose dams on the Narmada River. After a number of cases before the Supreme Court of India (1999, 2000, 2003), by 2014 the Narmada Control Authority had approved a series of changes in the final height and the associated displacement caused by the increased reservoir, from the original to a final from foundation.

==== Water dispute ====
Investigations for harnessing the Narmada waters began in 1945 to 1946 by A. N. Khosla who was the chairman of the Central Waterways, Irrigation and Navigation Commission (CWINC). In 1948 the Khosla Committee recommended that further investigations be carried out on four of the seven proposed sites. The four sites included Tawa, Bargi, Punasa and the Broach Barrage and Canal Project. In 1951 CWNIC was renamed Central Waterways &amp; Power Commission (CWPC) and in 1957 a senior member of the CWPC selected further investigations to be completed at Navagam, a site that fell under the Broach Project. Navagam eventually became CWPC&#x27;s preferred site because the geography allowed the dam&#x27;s height to be raised higher. In 1960, the federal Government of India&#x27;s Ministry of Irrigation and Power consultant team recommended that the Navagam Dam height be raised in one phase and that the drought prone areas in then Bombay State (modern day Saurashtra and Kutch regions) receive irrigation.

On 1 May 1960 Bombay state was separated into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. The Navagam Dam site and Broach Project fell under the newly formed State of Gujarat and further development and planning was given to the Gujarat State government. The Gujarat State government began planning studies for harnessing Narmada&#x27;s water past the Punasa site in Madhya Pradesh. At the same time, the Government of Madhya Pradesh was also finalising a separate report for the Punasa Project. The competing plans led to inter-State water conflicts to arise because the Narmada did not have enough water supply to meet the requirements as planned by the two states. This began inter-State conflicts that went on for several years until 1963 when the Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat arrived at a set of compromises called the Bhopal Agreement. Gujarat State ratified the agreement but Madhya Pradesh did not, which led to another impasse.

To break the logjam, a high-level Committee was appointed by the Government of India (GOI) in September 1964. In 1965, the Committee prepared a Master Plan for the basin, which involved construction of 12 major projects in Madhya Pradesh and the Navagam Dam in Gujarat. Gujarat endorsed the proposal, but Maharashtra did not. After intense parleys failed to resolve the problem, in 1968 GOI agreed to establish the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal (NWDT) under the Interstate River Water Disputes Act of 1956 to adjudicate on the dispute relating to sharing of water of the interstate Narmada and its valley.

After ten years of deliberations and taking into considering the development of the water resources of the basin as a whole gave its award December 1978.
Even though the tribunal award resolved the initial issue of water sharing, the height of dam, benefit sharing and the mode of settlement of affected people caused serious difficulties in implementation, particularly of the Sardar Sarovar dam.

The social movement Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) was formed to address environmental concerns and rehabilitation and resettlement of affected people. The movement created worldwide attention to the major development activity planned in the valley. This resulted in the Bank conducting an Independent Review Mission (IRM) in 1991 of the Sardar Sarovar Project and identified several recommendations. However, the IRM&#x27;s report was neither accepted by the Government of India or the World Bank. Finally the Government of India decided to terminate further drawing from the World Bank loan and would complete the project with national resources.

The Supreme Court has also deliberated on this issue for several years but finally upheld the Tribunal Award and allowed the construction to proceed, subject to conditions. The Court introduced a mechanism to monitor the progress of resettlement &quot;pari passu&quot; with the raising of the height of the dam through Grievance Redressal Authorities (GRA) in each of the party states. The court&#x27;s decision referred in this document, given in the year 2000, after 7 years of deliberations, has paved the way for completing the project to attain full envisaged benefits.

==== Narmada Canal ====
The Narmada canal brings water from the Sardar Sarovar dam to the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. The canal is 532 km long, with 485 km in Gujarat and 75 km in Rajasthan. The Narmada canal has helped both states supply water to arid regions of Kutch and Saurashtra for irrigation purposes. The Narmada canal had covered over 68 percent of the proposed villages (6,513) by 2010 in Gujarat.

=== Indirasagar Dam ===
The Indira Sagar Project (ISP) at Punasa is one of the 30 major projects proposed in the Narmada basin with the largest storage capacity in the country. The project is located near Punasa village, in Khandwa District, Madhya Pradesh. This Multipurpose River Valley Project envisages construction of a concrete gravity dam, long and high with gross storage capacity of the reservoir of and live storage of to provide an annual irrigation potential of and a generation of 1000 MW of hydropower. The project also ensures supply of of drinking water to rural areas in Khandwa district. In accordance with NWDT award, an annual regulated flow of shall be released to the Sardar Sarovar Project (SSP), ex-Maheshwar Project. The operation of Indira Sagar Project will be carried out in such a way as to facilitate the regulation of Sardar Sarovar.

The dam and the powerhouse have been completed, but storage has been restricted up to EL 260 m under orders of the High Court, Jabalpur from R&amp;R consideration. All the units of the powerhouse have been commissioned and generation of power from the eight units of 125 MW capacity, each commenced from January 2004. The irrigation component of the project is under a fairly advance stage of implementation.

<doc id="605253" wikidata="Q7886648" url="?curid=605253" title="Complement (music)">
<text>In music theory, complement refers to either traditional interval complementation, or the aggregate complementation of twelve-tone and serialism.

In interval complementation a complement is the interval which, when added to the original interval, spans an octave in total. For example, a major 3rd is the complement of a minor 6th. The complement of any interval is also known as its &quot;inverse&quot; or &quot;inversion&quot;. Note that the octave and the unison are each other&#x27;s complements and that the tritone is its own complement (though the latter is &quot;re-spelt&quot; as either an augmented fourth or a diminished fifth, depending on the context).

In the aggregate complementation of twelve-tone music and serialism the complement of one set of notes from the chromatic scale contains all the &quot;other&quot; notes of the scale. For example, A-B-C-D-E-F-G is &quot;complemented&quot; by B-C-E-F-A.

Note that &quot;musical set theory&quot; broadens the definition of both senses somewhat.

==Interval complementation==
===Rule of nine===

The &quot;rule of nine&quot; is a simple way to work out which intervals complement each other. Taking the &quot;names&quot; of the intervals as cardinal numbers (fourth etc. becomes &quot;four&quot;), we have for example 4 + 5 = 9. Hence the &quot;fourth&quot; and the &quot;fifth&quot; complement each other. Where we are using more generic names (such as &quot;semitone&quot; and &quot;tritone&quot;) this rule cannot be applied. However, &quot;octave&quot; and &quot;unison&quot; are not generic but specifically refer to notes with the same name, hence 8 + 1 = 9.

Perfect intervals complement (different) perfect intervals, major intervals complement minor intervals, augmented intervals complement diminished intervals, and double diminished intervals complement double augmented intervals.

===Rule of twelve===
Using integer notation and modulo 12 (in which the numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; at 12, 12 and its multiples therefore being defined as 0), any two intervals which add up to 0 (mod 12) are complements (mod 12). In this case the unison, 0, is its own complement, while for other intervals the complements are the same as above (for instance a perfect fifth, or 7, is the complement of the perfect fourth, or 5, 7 + 5 = 12 = 0 mod 12).

Thus the #Sum of complementation is 12 (= 0 mod 12).

===Set theory===
In musical set theory or atonal theory, &quot;complement&quot; is used in both the sense above (in which the perfect fourth is the complement of the perfect fifth, 5+7=12), and in the additive inverse sense of the &quot;same&quot; melodic interval in the opposite direction – e.g. a falling 5th is the complement of a rising 5th. 

==Aggregate complementation==

In twelve-tone music and serialism complementation (in full, &quot;literal pitch class complementation&quot;) is the separation of pitch-class collections into complementary sets, each containing pitch classes absent from the other or rather, &quot;the relation by which the union of one set with another exhausts the aggregate&quot;. To provide, &quot;a simple explanation...: the complement of a pitch-class set consists, in the literal sense, of all the notes remaining in the twelve-note chromatic that are not in that set.&quot;

In the twelve-tone technique this is often the separation of the total chromatic of twelve pitch classes into two hexachords of six pitch classes each. In rows with the property of &quot;combinatoriality&quot;, two twelve-note tone rows (or two permutations of one tone row) are used simultaneously, thereby creating, &quot;two aggregates, between the first hexachords of each, and the second hexachords of each, respectively.&quot; In other words, the first and second hexachord of each series will always combine to include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale, known as an &quot;aggregate&quot;, as will the first two hexachords of the appropriately selected permutations and the second two hexachords.

Hexachordal complementation is the use of the potential for pairs of hexachords to each contain six different pitch classes and thereby complete an aggregate.

===Sum of complementation===
For example, given the transpositionally related sets:
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
 − 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 0
 ____________________________________
 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11
The difference is always 11. The first set may be called P0 (see tone row), in which case the second set would be P1.

In contrast, &quot;where transpositionally related sets show the same difference for every pair of corresponding pitch classes, inversionally related sets show the same sum.&quot; For example, given the inversionally related sets (P0 and I11):
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
 +11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
 ____________________________________
 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11
The sum is always 11. Thus for P0 and I11 the sum of complementation is 11.

===Abstract complement===
In set theory the traditional concept of complementation may be distinguished as literal pitch class complement, &quot;where the relation obtains between specific pitch-class sets&quot;, while, due to the definition of equivalent sets, the concept may be broadened to include &quot;not only the literal pc complement of that set but also any transposed or inverted-and-transposed form of the literal complement,&quot; which may be described as &quot;abstract complement&quot;, &quot;where the relation obtains between set classes&quot;. This is because since P is equivalent to M, and M is the complement of M, P is also the complement of M, &quot;from a logical and musical point of view,&quot; even though not its pc complement. Originator Allen Forte describes this as, &quot;significant extension of the complement relation,&quot; though George Perle describes this as, &quot;an egregious understatement&quot;.

As a further example take the chromatic sets 7-1 and 5-1. If the pitch-classes of 7-1 span C–F and those of 5-1 span G–B then they are literal complements. However, if 5-1 spans C–E, C–F, or D–F, then it is an abstract complement of 7-1. As these examples make clear, once sets or pitch-class sets are labeled, &quot;the complement relation is easily recognized by the identical ordinal number in pairs of sets of complementary cardinalities&quot;.

<text>Labatt Memorial Park (formerly Tecumseh Park, 1877–1936) is a baseball stadium near the forks of the Thames River in central London, Ontario, Canada. It is in size, has 5,200 seats and a natural grass field. From home plate to centre field the distance is ; from home plate to left and right field down the lines, it is . The park is currently home to the London Majors of the Intercounty Baseball League and the Western Mustangs.

Labatt Park is the &quot;oldest continually operating baseball grounds in the world&quot;, with a history dating back to 1877. Since December 31, 1936, Labatt Park has been owned by the City of London.

==Commons area at the riverforks==

According to Seneca College&#x27;s Professor Bill Humber, a noted Canadian baseball historian and author, the site of today&#x27;s Labatt Park was likely used for recreational games when it was a grassy commons area at the riverforks, prior to becoming Tecumseh Park in 1877.

Baseball&#x27;s roots are in the immediate area around London. The game of baseball, a derivative of the British game of rounders, had probably arrived in the area from nearby Beachville, Ontario, where the world&#x27;s first recorded baseball game was played in 1838. (See Baseball Before We Knew It and Origins of baseball for other possible origins).

==London Tecumsehs==

The founding of the London Tecumsehs Baseball Club in 1868 ultimately led to the creation of Tecumseh Park in 1877. According to the &quot;London Advertiser&quot; of May 4, 1877, the first game at the new baseball park was held on May 3, 1877, with a contest between the London Tecumsehs and its junior team, the London Atlantics. The Tecumsehs won 5-1.

To wit: &quot;The first regular game of baseball of the season was played yesterday afternoon in the presence of fully a thousand people. The new grounds are the most complete of every respect of any of the kind in Canada, and but few American cities have a convenient playing field.&quot;

On May 4, 1877, the Tecumsehs met the Hartfords of Brooklyn in their first International league game. Phil Powers, the Tecumsehs&#x27; star catcher, was out with a broken finger. The London nine were defeated 6-2.

On May 24, 1877, before 8,000 fans, the National League champion Boston Red Stockings played the London Tecumsehs of the fledgling International Association, with its star pitcher and later Chicago White Stocking stalwart, Fred Goldsmith. Boston narrowly defeated London, 7-6.

Created by London china merchant W. J. Reid, Tecumseh Park was named after the Shawnee Chief Tecumseh who fought alongside the British during the War of 1812 and who died in the Battle of the Thames near Chatham, Ontario, in October 1813.

Jacob Englehart, the Cleveland-born oil tycoon, a future vice president of Imperial Oil and the Tecumseh&#x27;s president/principal owner, moved the team to Tecumseh Park in 1877.

Englehart soon began looking for professional players from the U.S., later signing four Americans:

* first-baseman/manager George &quot;Juice&quot; Latham
* pitcher Fred Goldsmith of New Haven, Connecticut (believed by many to be the co-inventor of the curveball along with Candy Cummings of Ware, Massachusetts)
* catcher Phil Powers and
* infielder/outfielder Joe Hornung (nicknamed &quot;Dutchy&quot; and &quot;Ubbo Ubbo&quot;) from Carthage, New York.

Goldsmith&#x27;s first complete game with the Tecumsehs occurred on May 24, 1876, when London played Guelph Maple Leafs before 6,000 spectators at the old Fair Grounds (southeast corner of Wellington and Pall Mall streets in London), a contest that London won 8-7 in 10 innings, largely due to Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;scientific pitching&quot;, using his innovative &quot;skew ball.&quot;

After the Tecumsehs, Goldsmith went on to pitch for the Troy, New York Trojans in 1879, National League&#x27;s Chicago White Stockings from 1880 to 1884 and the American Association&#x27;s Baltimore Orioles, also in 1884.

In addition to Englehart, the Tecumsehs&#x27; back-room movers and shakers consisted of London newspaperman Harry Gorman; Ed Moore, manager of the Tecumseh House; Richard Meredith, a future chief justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario; William Southam, who was to found Southam News and to add an egalitarian touch, Jim Jury, a custodian at the collegiate institute.

The following year in 1877, the Tecumsehs played in the International Association, a rival of the National League. That year, the Tecumsehs defeated the National League&#x27;s Boston Red Stockings in an exhibition game at Tecumseh Park and later in the season they defeated the Pittsburgh Allegheny 5-2 to win the International Association pennant. More than 6,000 people attended London&#x27;s pennant-winning game in a park built to seat 600.

After the season, the Tecumsehs were offered membership in the National League, but declined. The Tecumsehs subsequently folded on August 22, 1878, due to financial difficulties compounded by a questionable game lost by the Tecumsehs, and the International Association floundered a few years later. Both were resurrected in 1888 and 1889.

Among its more notable stars in 1888 was outfielder Patsy Donovan who went on to an outstanding career in Major League Baseball as both a player and a manager.

The Tecumsehs also played at the park pre- and post-1920, with Charlie (Mechanical Man) Gehringer playing with the 1921–1924 Tecumsehs before he went on to a stellar career with the Detroit Tigers. Gehringer was subsequently inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.

American baseball historians Bill Weiss and Marshall Wright have placed the 1920 London Tecumsehs on the list of the Top 100 Minor League Baseball Teams of all-time—coming in at #52, with a record of 86 wins and 32 losses.

On September 15, 1920, with Ty Cobb in the lineup, the Detroit Tigers defeated the London Tecumsehs 5-4 before 3,000 people at Tecumseh Park in exhibition baseball. Reserved seating for the game was $1.

The 1920 Tecumsehs clinched the first-place pennant with 15 games to play and London led the Michigan-Ontario league in attendance, with an astonishing 100,686 people watching them play.

On May 9, 1921, under manager George (Mooney) Gibson, the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the London Tecumsehs 8-7 at Tecumseh Park before 3,500 people in an exhibition baseball game. Before the game, Gibson and his team were presented with a silver loving cup by the London Kiwanis Club. Gibson thrilled the locals by catching the opening inning with his 1909 World Series-winning battery mate Babe Adams and singling and scoring a run in his lone at-bat. London Mayor Syd Little entertained the team that evening at his home.

On September 14, 1921, the Tecumsehs won the Michigan-Ontario Baseball League championship, 1-0 over Bay City, Michigan, before 1,000 people at Tecumseh Park. London scored its lone run in the first inning when third baseman Doc Shay, playing his first game of the series because of illness, tripled and scores on a sacrifice fly. In three games of the series, London pitcher Frank Herbst of London allowed six hits and only one run in 33 innings. London advanced against Ludington, Michigan, champions of the Central League.

On September 28, 1921, London won the best-of-seven series against Ludington 4-3, taking Game 7 10-7 at Grand Rapids, Mich. The Tecumsehs were down 3-1 in the series. A few days later, London manager Buzz Wetzel was presented with a gold watch to commemorate the win. The normally reserved Wetzel spoke, saying, &quot;I tried to do what was right and give you the best I had and I honestly believe that the fans here have a right to be proud of their baseball team.&quot;

On May 23, 1923, Washington&#x27;s pitching ace Walter Johnson was in uniform but did not pitch as the Washington Senators defeated the Tecumsehs 13-9 in an exhibition baseball game at Tecumseh Park.

==Thames River flood of 1883==

Tecumseh Park was damaged by a flood of the Thames River on July 11, 1883 which destroyed the original grandstands, located near today&#x27;s outfield foul ball lines. Originally, home plate was located in today&#x27;s left-centre field. The new replacement grandstand (1883–1937) was built facing east toward downtown London, with home plate moved to approximately the same location as it is today.

Beginning in 1892 the park was used for amateur and professional bicycle races, attracting such international stars as Harley Davidson (the &quot;Canadian Wheelman&quot;, a late-19th century cycling magazine was started and published in London).

Baseball continued to be played there as well, with three more incarnations of the Tecumsehs in the International Association (1888–1889), the International League (1890), and the Canadian League (1898–circa 1915), with the London Alerts, also of the Canadian League, playing in 1897 and 1899. Meanwhile, in 1895 the park was the site of the first-ever motion picture display in London, organized by the London Bicycle Club.

The London Cockneys played in the Class D International League in 1908 and the Class C Canadian League in 1911, while another Tecumsehs club played in the Class C and Class B Leagues from 1912 to 1915. It was during this period that Earle Neale played baseball at Labatt Park before he started his career in the Big Leagues with the Cincinnati Reds in 1916, later becoming an award-winning and innovative football coach in American pro football.

The Tecumsehs played in the Class B Michigan–Ontario League from 1919 to 1924, and during the early 1920s, the team included future Major League second-base star Charlie Gehringer. Gehringer and the Tecumsehs defeated the Boston Red Sox in an exhibition game, also in 1921. A second London team, the Indians, played in the Michigan–Ontario League in 1925. The Tecumsehs also played in the Class D Ontario League in 1930.

In 1940 and 1941, the London Pirates played in the Pennsylvania–Ontario–New York League, more commonly known as the PONY League. It was during this period that lights were installed at Labatt Park to permit night baseball. The 1941 Pirates team included pitcher Russ Getsinger and future Major Leaguers such as Jim Jordan and Vic Barnhart. Vic&#x27;s brother Bob Barnhart was also a teammate on the 1941 London Pirates. Vic&#x27;s father Clyde Barnhart was a star with the Pittsburgh Pirates throughout the 1920s including the 1925 and 1927 World Series teams.

==Negro leagues and other players==

During the first half of the 20th century, Labatt Park (Tecumseh Park until December 31, 1936) was regularly visited by numerous barnstorming Negro teams from the U.S., plus a much-celebrated visit by legendary African-American pitcher Satchel Paige on June 30, 1954, when Paige was barnstorming with a baseball version of the Harlem Globetrotters. Paige pitched the last three innings of an exhibition game against another legendary barnstorming team—The House of David baseball team, who all sported beards and long hair and travelled with their own generator-powered lights (before Labatt Park installed lights in the early 1940s), which featured noted baseball clown, Frank (Bobo) Nickerson.

As of October 1, 1923, The London Colored Stars, a Negro baseball team, had won 15 of 19 games and announced they &quot;are looking for more engagements.&quot;

Additionally, numerous former players with the Negro leagues played in the Senior Intercounty Baseball League after the Negro leagues gradually folded after Jackie Robinson broke the &quot;colour barrier&quot; in 1947, including pitcher Ted Alexander of the Kansas City Monarchs and the Homestead Grays (1950-51 London Majors); Wilmer Fields (Brantford Red Sox); Jimmy Wilkes (retired jersey #5 for the Brantford Red Sox, later became a City league umpire after a decade with Brantford); Gentry (Geep) Jessup (Galt Terriers); Larry Cunningham (Galt Terriers, Hamilton Cardinals); Ed Steele (Galt) and Shanty Clifford (Galt and Brantford); Luther Clifford; Max Manning; Lester Lockett; Bob Thurman and Stanley Glenn (St. Thomas Elgins); all made numerous appearances at Labatt Park in the 1950s.

The late Wilmer (The Great) Fields is a former president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Association (NLBPA), while Stanley (Doc) Glenn is currently the president of the NLBPA.

==Bryce&#x27;s 1876 and 1877 Baseball Guides==

This is the world&#x27;s oldest baseball grounds still in existence. 
A treasure-trove of information about early Canadian/Ontario &quot;baseball&quot; surfaced in 2002 when Library and Archives Canada purchased (for $10,000 from an Ottawa, Ontario, bookseller) &quot;Bryce&#x27;s Base Ball Guide 1876&quot; and &quot;Bryce&#x27;s Base Ball Guide 1877&quot;, two hand-coloured, 75-page booklets published by William Bryce of London, Ontario, which originally sold for a dime.

The two, four-inch (102 mm) by seven-inch guides are considered to be the first significant publications on Canadian baseball.

Bryce, a Scottish-born bookseller, newsagent and sporting goods distributor in London, had a small stake in the Tecumsehs, considered by many to be the finest ball team in the entire Dominion of Canada.

During U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s visit to the Library and Archives Canada building on November 30, 2004, he showed a special interest in these two early Canadian base ball books which were laid out for his perusal. See here 

==Tecumseh Park becomes Labatt Park==

According to the 1926 Geodetic Survey of Canada (and the subsequent detailed maps printed in 1928), there was a structure situated near what is now the main entrance to the ballpark at 25 Wilson Avenue (at the time, the two entrances to the ballpark were off of Dundas Street—now Riverside Drive—including an art deco entranceway that was demolished in the early 1980s).

According to Mooney Gibson&#x27;s nephew, George Lambourn, a noted baseball historian in his own right, the residence at 27 Wilson Avenue was the home of the park&#x27;s cranky caretaker, Jakey Butts, which was destroyed by the Thames River flood of 1937.

This devastating flood damaged the park again, necessitating the construction of the park&#x27;s third grandstand (1937–2001) and a new clubhouse, with the local Labatt Brewing Company donating $10,000 to renovate the park, as well as deeding the park itself to the City of London on December 31, 1936, with the written provisions that the park remain a public athletic park in perpetuity and that it be renamed &quot;The John Labatt Memorial Athletic Park.&quot;

From a sociological-historical perspective, it could be argued that the name change from Tecumseh Park to Labatt Memorial Park highlights the dramatic shift from 19th-Century colonial Canada (where the Shawnee Chief Tecumseh was immortalized throughout Canada for aiding the British in the War of 1812) to more modern times where businesses such as the Labatt Brewing Company exercised considerable influence on the cultural fabric of the day.

At the end of August during the 1950s, Labatt Park annually hosted athletes from across the city&#x27;s playgrounds competing in a variety of sports during a two- to three-day event, called the &quot;Junior Olympiad.&quot; (A P.U.C. Playground Supervisor&#x27;s Reunion was held on June 24, 2006, at the City-owned Thames Valley Golf Course.)

==Frank Colman and Tom Burgess==

Other London notables to graduate to the Major Leagues from Labatt Park during the 1940s are Tom (Tim) Burgess (1927–2008) and Frank Colman (1918–1983).

In 1936, Frank Colman started out at Labatt Park with the London Winery of the Senior Intercounty Baseball League, winning the Most Valuable Player award, batting title and Intercounty Baseball League championship. Colman was 25 when he broke into the major leagues as a right fielder with the Pittsburgh Pirates, playing with them from 1942 through 1946, before he moved to New York to play with the Yankees. He played with the Yankees in 1946 and 1947, where he roomed with Yankee catcher Yogi Berra. He finished his six-year major league career with 571 at-bats, 15 home runs and 106 RBIs.

Colman returned to London in 1954 after playing in the minor leagues and being the player/coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the AAA International League from 1951–1953. He bought the London Majors and, as player/ owner, won the Intercounty League title in 1956 and the Great Lakes championship in 1957 before returning to the Intercounty League in 1958 and selling the team in 1959.

Colman is also a co-founder of the Eager Beaver Baseball Association (EBBA) in London which has provided competitive league play for thousands of youngsters since its founding in 1955. In 1984, a year after Colman&#x27;s death, the EBBA&#x27;s all-star day in mid-July was renamed &quot;Frank Colman Day.&quot;

Colman was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame &amp; Museum in 1999 and the London Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.

In a letter to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999, Yogi Berra wrote that he visited Colman at his home in Canada on several occasions.

&quot;I&#x27;ve made a lot of friends in baseball through the years, but I&#x27;ll always remember Frank as one of the most decent and genuine people that I ever met&quot;, Berra wrote. &quot;I was proud that he was my friend.&quot;

Tom Burgess first signed a pro contract with St. Louis in 1946 and played right field and first base for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1954 to 1961 and right field and first base for the Los Angeles Angels from 1962–1963.

&quot;[Former P.U.C. recreation director] Bill Farquharson gave me the opportunity from the playground days and I worked my way up to the big leagues where I made a living for 44 years.&quot;—Tom (Tim) Burgess, November 28, 2005 

Since 1968, Burgess has been involved in Major League Baseball in a variety of managing, coaching and instructor capacities with several organizations, including the St. Louis Cardinals from 1968 to 1975, the New York Mets from 1976 to 1977, the Texas Rangers from 1980 to 1984, the Detroit Tigers from 1985 to 1987, the Kansas City Royals from 1987 to 1995. From 1996 to the present day, Burgess has been an instructor with both Baseball Canada and the Ontario Baseball Association. He was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame &amp; Museum in 1992 and the London Sports Hall of Fame in 2003.

==London Supremes and London Army Team==

During World War II (1942 onward), the park was the home field for several women&#x27;s baseball, softball and fastball teams, including the London Supremes who played in the Michigan–Ontario Women&#x27;s Fastball League into the 1950s. In 1943 and 1944, the London Army Team won the Canadian Sandlot title.

Shortly after World War II Labatt Park was the home of the London Majors, which won the Canadian Sandlot Congress in 1947 and the Can-Am Baseball Congress championship in 1948, beating the Fort Wayne, Indiana, General Electrics in a best-of-seven-game series at Labatt Park, as well as winning the Canadian, Ontario and Intercounty titles.

==Denny McLain and Fergie Jenkins==

In 1974, after Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Denny McLain had retired from the major leagues (two years earlier), McLain played a season for the London Majors, restricting himself to home games at Labatt Park. Due to arm problems, however, McLain only pitched nine innings for the Majors, but did play in 14 games at either shortstop, first base and catcher and batted .380, including hitting two homers in one game in London.

After Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Fergie Jenkins pitched his final major league game on September 26, 1983, London Majors&#x27; owner-player Arden Eddie convinced Jenkins to pitch for the Majors in 1984-85, commuting from his home near Chatham, Ontario. The Canadian-born Jenkins is one of the few MLB players to have been inducted into both the Baseball Hall of Fame &amp; Museum in Cooperstown, New York and the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame &amp; Museum in St. Marys, Ontario, Canada.

==Tigers, Werewolves and Monarchs==
Professional baseball declined in London after the war, with mostly amateur teams playing at Labatt Park in the following decades, until 1989 when an AA Eastern League affiliate of the Detroit Tigers was established by investors/ Board of Directors, President Dan Ross, Vice President Mike Tucker, Vice President and General Manager Bob Gilson, Vice President and Assistant General Manager General Manager Bill Wilkinson and Vice President Brian Costello.

Immediately prior to the London Tigers&#x27; inaugural season at Labatt Park in 1989, numerous improvements were completed at the park costing approximately $1-million for new lights, new dressing rooms and dugouts, additional seating, field and entrance upgrades, food concession enhancements and a new -by-19-foot electronic scoreboard (partially sponsored by Labatt Breweries). Previously, the scoreboard was changed manually. In 1990, Labatt Park and its head groundskeeper Mike Regan, won the prestigious &quot;Beam Clay Award&quot; as the best natural-grass field in North America.

Broadcasting the Tigers&#x27; games on TV London with veteran local sportscaster Pete James were former Tiger greats Mickey Lolich and later, Denny McLain.

The 1990 London Tigers won the Eastern League title under manager Chris Chambliss (one of the Tigers&#x27; players was Travis Fryman), but the Tom Runnells-managed Tigers relocated to Trenton, New Jersey after the 1993 season, citing declining attendance.

On January 20, 1990, In Houston, Texas, Labatt Park was named the &quot;Beam Clay Baseball Diamond of the Year&quot; for &quot;excellence and professionalism in maintaining an outstanding professional baseball diamond&quot;—due to the outstanding groundskeeping work of City of London employee/supervisor, Mike Regan and his assistant Rob Garrett.

The park was considered for the filming of the 1992 movie &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; starring Madonna and Geena Davis, but filming could not fit around the home schedule of the Double A London Tigers of the Eastern League.

The London Werewolves of the fledgling Frontier League played at the park from 1999 to 2001, winning the Frontier League championship in 1999; Werewolves pitcher Brett Gray tossed 25 strikeouts on June 3, 2000 (home opener), against the Chillicothe (Ohio) Paints. The game&#x27;s scorecard and Brett Gray&#x27;s jersey were donated to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame &amp; Museum in St. Marys, Ontario, by Werewolves&#x27; General Manager John Kuhn.

In 2000, former MLB star Ron LeFlore was hired as the manager of the Cook County Cheetahs of the Frontier League, visiting Labatt Park several times during the season.

In 2001 after the &quot;circa&quot;-1937 main grandstand was demolished and a new, $1.97-million, wheelchair-accessible main grandstand was built (the park&#x27;s fourth) and a new &quot;pop-up&quot; underground irrigation system was installed, the park was used as the chief baseball venue for the Canada Summer Games.

In 2003 the park was also home to the London Monarchs of the short-lived Canadian Baseball League, which folded mid-season due to financial difficulties. The team&#x27;s manager was former Major Leaguer Willie Wilson and featured such stars as first-baseman Francisco Cabrera and pitcher Amaury Telemaco. The league&#x27;s inaugural game and home opener for the London Monarchs was held at Labatt Park on May 21, 2003, and was televised nationally on The Score. It also featured a fly-over by the Canadian Snowbirds flying team. League Commissioner Fergie Jenkins was also in attendance.

==Beehive of activity==

Along with bicycle racing, Labatt Park has in the past been used for soccer, fastball, softball, high-school and men&#x27;s football, track and field, wrestling, boxing, winter skating, political rallies, showjumping, civic receptions, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Musical Ride and a 21-gun salute to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to London&#x27;s Victoria Park on June 26, 1997.

Currently, the park is home to the London Majors of the Intercounty League and the London Badgers junior team, as well as several other youth and adult baseball teams. The UWO Mustangs Baseball Club managed by former London Majors/AA London Tigers/AAA Toledo Mud Hens pitcher Mike Lumley is using the park during the 2006 Ontario University Athletics (OUA) baseball season (in 2005, the Mustangs won the OUA baseball title at Labatt Park for the first time, beating Brock University) Badgers in the final best-of-three championship series. The Western Mustangs repeated as OUA champs in 2006, beating Brock two games to nothing (7-4, 5-0) at Labatt Park on October 21.

It should also be noted that Ted Giannoulas, aka &quot;The Famous Chicken&quot; sports mascot, was born and raised in London, Ontario, and during the years 1965 to 1967 worked part-time at Labatt Park during baseball games changing the old manual scoreboard in right field for 25 cents a game.

==Roy McKay Clubhouse, home to the London Majors==

In 1996, the &quot;Reasons for Designation&quot; for the park under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; were amended to include the &quot;circa&quot;-1937, tongue-and-groove clapboard clubhouse of the London Majors, renamed the &quot;Roy McKay Clubhouse&quot; on August 1, 1996 (McKay was born on August 1), by Majors&#x27; longtime player/owner Arden Eddie in honour of former pitcher, manager and coach Roy McKay who died on Christmas Day in 1995, six months after falling on the porch of his Waterloo Street home. Subsequently, a large commemorative rock and bronze plaque honouring Roy McKay, jersey #16, was installed at the front of the clubhouse.

See a photo of the Roy McKay Clubhouse here.

&quot;I would like to be remembered for being a devoted son and brother, a loving husband, a great father and a damn good friend.&quot;—Roy McKay, 1933–1995 

To help raise money for a new cedar-shingle roof on the historic clubhouse, a ballgame dubbed &quot;The Rumble at the Riverforks&quot; was played at the park on May 31, 1998, featuring members of London city council, members of the local media and the London Majors&#x27; oldtimers. The game was organized by The Friends of Labatt Park, SCENE magazine and the London Majors.

On June 18, 2005, veteran Intercounty Baseball League umpire Joe Serratore was married to bride Bren Ferguson at home plate before 200 friends and family members, with United Church minister Reverend Susan Eagle (who, at the time, was a member of London city council) officiating. The home-plate wedding ceremony is believed to be a first for the ballpark.

== Labatt Park Reunion, 2005==

On Saturday, July 23, 2005, the City of London in conjunction with the London Sports Council, the London Sports Oldtimers Association, the London Majors Baseball Club and The Friends of Labatt Park, organized a special, day-long event at the park to commemorate the city&#x27;s 150th anniversary as an incorporated municipality (more than 10,000 residents) and the park&#x27;s 128-year-old history. The event featured an open baseball clinic for youngsters run by the London Majors, vintage ball games, displays of park/ baseball memorabilia and a Majors&#x27; oldtimers&#x27; reunion.

In 2006, London photo-historian Stephen Harding spent two days photographing the interior and exterior of the Roy McKay Clubhouse and presented his photos/ report to the City&#x27;s heritage planner as City staff formulate plans to make additional repairs to the 70-year-old structure.

== Got Milk? commercials spoof MLB steroid use==

In late September 2005, the San Francisco advertising firm of Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners filmed a series of five, 30-second Got Milk? TV-commercials at Labatt Park, that subsequently ran during post-season play of Major League Baseball (MLB), starting on October 11. The commercials, which spoofed the ongoing steroid scandal in MLB had players &quot;caught&quot; using a &quot;performance-enhancing substance&quot;—milk. The commercials were titled &quot;Caught&quot;, &quot;Batting Practice&quot;, &quot;Tabloid&quot;, &quot;Never Poured&quot; and &quot;Manager.&quot; The commercial &quot;Never Poured&quot; was shortlisted at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. From the get-go, MLB demanded that the commercials be taken off the air, but the popular commercials were subsequently re-released in December 2007 and ran through January 2008.

The humorous commercials continued to run during the 2005 World Series, won in 4 straight games by Chicago. An on-line poll on a Houston, Texas-based Web site revealed that 75% of more than 23,000 poll respondents found the commercials to be funny and wanted them left on the air.

==Roadway Express&#x27;s 2006–2007 baseball calendar==

Labatt Park is one of three featured baseball parks in the 16-month (September 2006 to December 2007) Roadway Express baseball calendar; Labatt Park is featured in the month of October 2007 &quot;Times of Greatness&quot; baseball calendar published by Roadway Express, based in Akron, Ohio. The print run of the calendars is 150,000.

Roadway Express is also the sponsor of the &quot;Times of Greatness&quot; interactive, -long museum travelling coast to coast in the U.S. and Canada every year, showcasing Negro leagues history and artifacts. Roadway Express is also a sponsor of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.

Bob Paige, a longtime driver for Roadway Express, is the son of Hall-of-Fame pitcher, Satchel Paige, who made a much-publicized visit to Labatt Park on June 30, 1954.

==Baseball Day in London, 2006==
On July 1 (Canada Day), 2006, London held its second annual Baseball Day, organized by the City of London, The Friends of Labatt Park, Fanshawe Pioneer Village, the London Majors Baseball Club, the London Oldtimers&#x27; Sports Association, the London and District Baseball Association and the London Sports Council.

The day featured an open, drop-in baseball clinic with the London Majors, historical displays in the Roy McKay Clubhouse, a 1923 Wurlitzer Military Band Organ (restored and owned and operated by Ken Vinen of Aylmer, Ontario), a vintage base ball game between Fanshawe Pioneer Village&#x27;s London Tecumsehs and Bruce Huff&#x27;s Thames River Ratz (the Ratz won 15-3), a pitch, hit and run competition and a doubleheader between the London Majors and the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Intercounty Baseball League (London won both games, 9-1 and 3-2). The scheduled fireworks (courtesy of the City of London) after the game over the adjacent river forks were cancelled due to high winds. Instead, they were set off the following night on July 2.

==&quot;Oldest and continuously operated&quot; park==
University of Western Ontario professor Bob Barney and graduate student Riley Nowokowski began investigating the history of Labatt Park, following an American challenge to its claim as baseball&#x27;s &quot;oldest and continuously operated&quot; park. Barney and Nowokowski spent three years researching 143 years of the park&#x27;s history, with their article: &quot;A Canadian National Treasure: Tecumseh/Labatt Memorial Park, Baseball History&#x27;s Oldest, Continuously-Operating Ballpark&quot;, published in the Fall 2021 issue of &quot;Ontario History&quot;. The City of London subsequently applied for Labatt Park to be granted national heritage site distinction.

Fuller Field in Clinton, Massachusetts, made it into the Guinness Book of World Records in September 2007 as the &quot;world&#x27;s oldest continually used baseball diamond/ field&quot;, dating back to 1878—a year after Tecumseh Park-Labatt Park opened in 1877—as Fuller Field&#x27;s home plate and bases have purportedly remained in the same location since 1878, whereas home plate at Labatt Park has been moved (within the same field) from its original location in 1877.

In September 2008, however, Labatt Park replaced Clinton, Massachusetts&#x27;, Fuller Field in the 2009 Guinness Book of World Records (page 191) as the &quot;World&#x27;s Oldest Baseball Diamond.&quot; Although it has flip flopped in the past, as of January 4, 2016, Guinness&#x27;s online record for the World&#x27;s Oldest Baseball Field/Diamond now states Labatt Park, London, Ontario. World&#x27;s Oldest Baseball Field

On May 30, 1994, the park was designated by London City Council under Part IV of the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; as an historic site &quot;via&quot; by-Law No. L.S.P.-3237-544, with the ceremonial plaque unveiling at the front gates of the park occurring on July 1 (Canada Day), 1994, prior to a doubleheader between the London Majors and Toronto Maple Leafs of the Intercounty Baseball League.

The park&#x27;s designation occurred after a six-month-long lobbying effort spearheaded by the volunteer, non-profit organization, The Friends of Labatt Park, which has undertaken a number of initiatives during the past 24 years to enhance and promote the ballpark, its history and ambience.

<text>The Regina Pats are a Canadian junior ice hockey team based in Regina, Saskatchewan. Founded in 1917, the Pats are the world&#x27;s oldest continuously operating major junior hockey franchise in its original location and using its original name. The team was originally named the Regina Patricia Hockey Club, after Princess Patricia of Connaught, the granddaughter of Queen Victoria and daughter of the Governor General, the Duke of Connaught. The team name also associates Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry–Pats sweaters bear the regimental badge and &quot;PPCLI&quot; flash as a shoulder patch.

Today, the team plays in the East Division of the Western Hockey League&#x27;s Eastern Conference. The Pats host games at the Brandt Centre and games are broadcast on 620 CKRM radio.

The Pats are one of the most successful junior hockey franchises. They have made a record sixteen appearances at the Memorial Cup tournament, and a record fourteen appearances in the tournament final. The teams&#x27; four Memorial Cup championships are the third most in history.

==History==
The team was founded in 1917 and named after the Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, a Western Canadian regiment founded during the First World War. The Memorial Cup was founded as a tribute to Canadian war veterans, and the Pats earned the right to contest the first ever Memorial Cup championship in 1919, which they lost to the University of Toronto Schools. The team&#x27;s first home was at Regina Arena, which opened in 1910 and could seat approximately 2,000. In 1920, the team moved to the Regina Stadium, which they would call home until 1977. In 1923, the team&#x27;s name was shortened to the Pats. In 1925, the team secured its first Memorial Cup title with a victory over Toronto Aura Lee. For the 1927–28 season, the Pats merged with the Regina Falcons and called themselves the Regina Monarchs. The team went on to win the Memorial Cup that year before reverting to the Pats nickname in 1928–29. The Pats would win one more Memorial Cup title in this era, defeating the West Toronto Nationals 2–0 in 1930.

The Pats played in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League from 1946 to 1948, the Western Canada Junior Hockey League from 1948 to 1956, and then the revived Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League from 1956 to 1966. During the 1960s, the club was an affiliate farm team for the Montreal Canadiens.

Del Wilson, a scout for the Canadiens, became the Pats general manager in 1955; in 1966, Wilson and the Pats became central in establishing a new major junior league for western Canada, the Western Canada Hockey League. Although the impetus for the new league was creating more even footing for western teams to compete with teams in eastern Canada for the Memorial Cup, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) regarded the new league as an &quot;outlaw league&quot; and, ironically for WCHL members, banned its teams from competing for the Memorial Cup. Because of this, the Pats returned to a once-more revived Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League in 1968. In 1970, CAHA reorganized junior hockey in Canada and finally recognized the WCHL as a legitimate major junior league, and the Pats returned to the league, which was renamed the Western Hockey League in 1978, for good. Wilson, who purchased the Pats in 1970, helped turn the team back into a national champion, as the Pats won their first President&#x27;s Cup WCHL championship and fourth Memorial Cup in 1974. Wilson sold his interest in the team in 1980, the same year the team won its second President&#x27;s Cup. The team remained competitive in the early 1980s, losing the WHL final in 1982 and 1984.

In 1977, the team moved from Exhibition Stadium to the adjacent and brand-new Agridome, since renamed the Brandt Centre. The team&#x27;s last game at Exhibition was a 4–3 overtime win over the Swift Current Broncos in front of 2,200 fans; they opened the new arena with a 8–4 victory over the Saskatoon Blades before a crowd of 4,200.

In 2014, John Paddock joined the team as its coach and manager. The 2016–17 season, the Pats&#x27; 99th, saw the team post its first ever 50-win season and capture its second Scotty Munro Memorial Trophy as regular season champions; the team would advance to its first championship final since 1984, which it lost to the Seattle Thunderbirds. The 2017–18 season marked the 100th anniversary for the Pats, and the team held celebrations throughout the year. In addition to announcing an outdoor game at Mosaic Stadium against the rival Moose Jaw Warriors, the Pats hosted the 2018 Memorial Cup—they would go on to lose in the championship game. Although the 2018 outdoor game was ultimately moved indoors due largely to weather and ice concerns, the Pats did host the Calgary Hitmen at Mosaic as part of the 2019 Heritage Classic festivities; the game, dubbed the &quot;Prairie Classic&quot;, saw Calgary win 5–4 in overtime.

==Championship history==
The Pats have been western Canadian junior hockey champions fourteen times, including twelve Abbott Cup and two President&#x27;s Cup victories. The Pats were also Saskatchewan junior hockey champions in 1918 before the advent of inter-provincial junior championships.

The Pats have appeared in more Memorial Cup tournaments than any other team, winning four times and finishing as the runner-up ten times. They have hosted the Memorial Cup tournament, solely or jointly, seven times: 1947, 1955, 1957, 1969, 1980, 2001, and 2018.
