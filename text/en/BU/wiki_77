<text>The Institute for Justice (IJ) is a non-profit public interest law firm in the United States. It has litigated twelve cases before the United States Supreme Court dealing with eminent domain, interstate commerce, public financing for elections, school vouchers, tax credits for private school tuition, civil asset forfeiture, and residency requirements for liquor license. The organization was founded on September 3, 1991. As of 2023, it employed a staff of 157 full-time staff members (including 64 attorneys) in Arlington, Virginia, and seven offices across the United States.

== History ==
William H. &quot;Chip&quot; Mellor and Clint Bolick co-founded the organization in 1991 with seed money from Charles Koch&#x27;s private foundation. Mellor was the organization&#x27;s President &amp; General Counsel through 2015. Bolick was the Vice President and Director of Litigation from 1990 until he left the organization in 2004. In March 2015, the organization announced that Mellor would become the chairman of its board of directors in January 2016. Senior Attorney Scott Bullock replaced Mellor as President.

The organization&#x27;s methods were modeled in part on work Bolick had done as the director of the Landmark Center for Civil Rights in Washington, D.C. For example, in the late 1980s Bolick represented Washington shoeshine stand owner Ego Brown in his attempt to overturn a Jim Crow-era law against bootblack stands on public streets. The law was designed to restrict economic opportunities for African Americans but was still being enforced 85 years after its passage. Bolick sued the District of Columbia on Brown&#x27;s behalf, and the law was overturned in 1989. In 1991, Bolick joined former Department of Energy Deputy General Counsel Chip Mellor to create the Institute for Justice. Mellor had served as president of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, a think tank in San Francisco. According to the Institute for Justice, books commissioned and published by the Pacific Research Institute &quot;formed the Institute for Justice&#x27;s long-term, strategic litigation blueprint&quot;.

=== Supreme Court cases ===

The organization has litigated cases that reached the Supreme Court:
* &quot;Zelman v. Simmons-Harris&quot;, : The court ruled in favor of a Cleveland, Ohio school voucher program, allowing the use of public money to pay tuition at private and parochial schools. The institute represented the pro-voucher parents.
* &quot;Swedenburg v. Kelly&quot;, : The court struck down laws in New York and Michigan that made it illegal for consumers to buy wine directly from out-of-state wineries. The institute represented small vintners in Virginia and California. (This case was consolidated with &quot;Granholm v. Heald&quot; prior to consideration by the Supreme Court.)
* &quot;Kelo v. City of New London&quot;, : The court ruled that the state of Connecticut could use eminent domain to take property from the plaintiffs (a group of homeowners) and transfer it to a private business. The institute represented the homeowners.
* &quot;Garriott v. Winn&quot;, : The court upheld an Arizona program that gave tax credits for private school tuition. This case was consolidated with &quot;Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn&quot; prior to consideration by the Supreme Court.
* &quot;Arizona Free Enterprise Club&#x27;s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett&quot;, : The court struck down part of a public campaign financing law in Arizona that provided additional public funding to candidates based on the amount of spending by their opponents. The institute represented several challengers to the law. This case was consolidated with &quot;McComish v. Bennett&quot; prior to consideration by the Supreme Court.
* &quot;Timbs v. Indiana&quot;, : The court ruled that the Eighth Amendment&#x27;s Excessive Fines Clause is an incorporated protection applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Due Process Clause, thus grossly disproportionate asset forfeiture is unconstitutional.
* &quot;Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Assn. v. Thomas&quot;, : The court ruled the residency requirement for retail liquor licenses violates the Commerce Clause and the 21st Amendment does not save it.
* &quot;Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue&quot;, : The court ruled that excluding religious schools from a tax-funded scholarship program available to non-religious private schools violates the Free Exercise Clause under a strict scrutiny analysis.
* &quot;Brownback v. King&quot;, : The court ruled that a failure to state a claim ruling in a district court is a judgement on merits and thus triggers the Federal Tort Claims Act&#x27;s judgement bar, precluding additional claims to be brought under &quot;Bivens&quot;.
* &quot;Carson v. Makin&quot;, : The petitioners, represented by the Institute, argued that Maine&#x27;s requirement that schools be &quot;non-sectarian&quot; to receive tuition assistance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case on December 8, 2021. The Court decided the case in favor of the plaintiffs on June 21, 2022.
* &quot;Gonzalez v. Trevino&quot;, 
* &quot;Devillier v. Texas&quot;, The Institute represented a farmer seeking to be allowed to sue the state of Texas regarding a Fifth Amendment issue. The court agreed with the farmer.

== Litigation ==
The organization provides pro bono legal advice and representation to clients. According to the organization, it selects cases based on the client&#x27;s ability to pay (giving preference to clients who do not have the means to obtain other representation), and on the case&#x27;s potential to publicize and educate the public on the issues involved.

=== Occupational licensing ===
IJ opposes many kinds of business licensing. The organization&#x27;s first case began in 1991, defending Taalib-Din Uqdah, a Washington, DC businessman who owned a salon to braid hair. Local authorities informed Taalib-Din that he would need a cosmetology license in order to continue operating his business. The institute contended that the licensing requirements did not apply to Taalib-Din&#x27;s business. Further, the organization claimed that the licensing rules in this case were designed to protect existing businesses from competition, with the effect of reducing choice and raising prices for consumers. The case was dismissed in 1992, but later in that year the city council repealed the cosmetology regulations that prevented Taalib-Din from opening his business. While institute co-founders Clint Bolick and Chip Mellor have acknowledged the need for health, safety, and consumer protection regulations, the organization continues to litigate against what it sees as abuse. It has defended a variety of small business owners across the United States in similar cases involving food cart and street vendors, vendors and makers of caskets, florists, interior designers, and independent taxi drivers. In defending tour guide operators in Philadelphia and Washington D.C., the Institute for Justice argued that restrictions on these businesses abridged First Amendment rights.

In 2005, the organization litigated on behalf of small wineries in California and Virginia. The institute&#x27;s case, &quot;Swedenburg v. Kelly&quot;, was consolidated with &quot;Granholm v. Heald&quot; and considered by the Supreme Court. The court ruled that laws in Michigan and New York that prohibited consumers from buying wine directly from out-of-state wineries were unconstitutional.

In 2009, the organization sued to allow donors to be compensated for giving bone marrow. The National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 (NOTA) made it illegal to compensate organ donors but did not prevent payment for other forms of donations (such as human plasma, sperm, and egg cells). Although bone marrow is not an organ or a component of an organ, the act made paying bone marrow donors punishable by up to 5 years in prison. At the time the act was passed, donating bone marrow involved a painful and risky medical procedure. In the years after the act was passed, a new procedure (apheresis) made it possible to harvest bone marrow cells through a non-surgical procedure similar to the donation of blood components such as platelets or plasma. The Institute for Justice lawsuit argued that the development of apheresis meant that donors who gave bone marrow through blood donation should be allowed to receive compensation. The organization predicted that allowing compensation would increase the pool of available donors, and claimed that 3,000 Americans die each year while waiting for compatible marrow donors. Critics argued that allowing compensation could reduce donation, increase the risk of disease, and lead to exploitation of the poor. In December 2011, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that donors giving bone marrow via apheresis were eligible for compensation. In November 2013, the federal government proposed a regulation that would change legal definitions to cover bone marrow regardless of how it is obtained. This would have the effect of keeping the ban on compensating donors in place. However, HHS withdrew the proposed rule in 2017, clearing the way for compensating those who donate via apheresis.

In 2010, the Institute for Justice filed suit on behalf of monks from Saint Joseph Abbey, a century-old Benedictine monastery in Covington, Louisiana. The monks sold handmade wooden caskets, but the Louisiana Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors enforced a law requiring anyone who wanted to sell caskets or any funeral merchandise in the state to become a government-licensed funeral director. To secure a license, the monks would need to pass a funeral industry test [FN: La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 37:848(A).] and convert their monastery into a funeral establishment [FN:  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 37:848(A); La. Admin. Code tit. 46, §§ 503, 709 &amp; 903.], which would require installing equipment for embalming human remains. [FN:  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 37:842(D); La. Admin. Code tit. 46, §§ 1105 &amp; 1107.] On March 20, 2013, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a unanimous ruling in favor of the monks holding that laws amounting to “naked transfers of wealth” to politically favored insiders are unconstitutional.

In 2013, the Institute for Justice filed a federal suit on behalf of three independent tax preparers against the Internal Revenue Service. The tax preparers challenged the IRS’s imposition of a new licensing system (without congressional authorization) requiring tax preparers to get the IRS’s permission before they could work. In January 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled the IRS didn’t have the power to impose nationwide licensing on tax preparers. In February 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the trial court’s ruling.

In July 2017, Airbnb property manager Sally Ladd—represented by the Institute for Justice—filed lawsuit challenging the Pennsylvania Real Estate Commission’s effort to require Ladd to obtain a real estate broker’s license to manage vacation rental properties. After winning a procedural case before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 2020, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court held a trial on Ladd’s case in 2022 then ruled in October 2022 her favor—a decision the government did not appeal.

In December 2018, the Institute for Justice filed suit on behalf of two would-be estheticians—cosmetologists who specialize in beauty and care of the face—against the Pennsylvania Cosmetology Board. The clients, Courtney Haveman and Amanda Spillane, were denied government-issued licenses to work citing the state’s “good moral character” clause because each of them had past criminal offenses. In August 2020, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court struck down the good moral standard clause, clearing the way for Haveman and Spillane to reapply for their licenses.

=== Property rights ===

==== Eminent domain ====

Eminent domain cases pursued by the organization involve instances where a government seeks to condemn a property and transfer it from one private owner to another (as opposed to using it for a road, building, park, or other publicly owned property). The organization gained national attention in 1996, defending a small business owner in a case involving Trump Casino (&quot;Casino Reinvestment Development Authority v. Coking&quot;), and again in 2005, arguing &quot;Kelo v. City of New London&quot; before the Supreme Court. In the casino case, a New Jersey state agency (the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority) was attempting to condemn Vera Coking&#x27;s boarding house, along with two other businesses in Atlantic City, in order to transfer the properties to a business owned by Donald Trump. In 1998, a New Jersey Superior Court judge ruled that the state was not allowed to seize the properties. However, the ruling did not contest the state&#x27;s right to take property from one private owner for the purpose of giving it to another. The judge based the ruling on the fact that the state did not get a guarantee that the Trump organization would use the property for a new parking area (as promised), instead of using the property for other purposes such as expanding Trump&#x27;s casino. According to the Institute for Justice, the organization received a &quot;deluge&quot; of requests to participate in other cases of eminent domain abuse after its win in the Coking case. In 2008, organization president Chip Mellor stated:

Frankly, we had not realized just how widespread this phenomenon was until [the Coking case] ... Once we became aware of it, though, we formed a strategic plan to escalate it to national attention and ultimately to the Supreme Court, which we did in the course of the next seven years. 

In 2005, the organization represented the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court case &quot;Kelo v. City of New London&quot;. In this case, the state of Connecticut was attempting to take properties owned by state residents and give them to a private company for use in a development. In a 5-to-4 decision the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state, affirming the right of states to transfer properties from one private owner to another in this way. The ruling prompted what was widely called a &quot;backlash&quot; against this kind of eminent domain activity. In 2006 (on the first anniversary of the Kelo ruling), President George W. Bush issued an executive order limiting how federal agencies could use eminent domain. Between the Kelo ruling and June 2008, 37 states passed laws to increase restrictions on the use of eminent domain. In 2006, the organization won an eminent domain case in the Ohio Supreme Court, the first eminent domain decision by a state supreme court after Kelo. In the years since, the institute has continued its efforts to reform eminent domain laws.

Since litigating the Kelo case, the Institute for Justice has won eminent domain cases in Lakewood, Ohio, Long Branch, New Jersey, Riviera Beach, Florida, National City, California, Nashville, Tennessee, and Atlantic City, New Jersey.

==== Civil forfeiture ====
The organization seeks to end the use of civil forfeiture and replace it with criminal forfeiture, which would require the government to convict someone of a crime before their property could be taken. Civil forfeiture is the process by which law enforcement agencies in the United States can seize private property, based on the suspicion that the property was used in, or the fruit of, a crime, but without a criminal conviction or, in some cases, even criminal charges being filed. Typically, the law enforcement agencies can keep seized money and apply it to their budgets, though there may be requirements to utilize some or all of the money for specific purposes (e.g., drug and alcohol rehabilitation). State agencies can also confiscate property under federal statutes, and through a program called &quot;equitable sharing&quot; keep up to 80% of the property. The Institute for Justice and other critics argue that this direct financial reward gives law enforcement agencies a strong incentive to abuse civil asset forfeiture. In these cases, the organization occasionally works with other advocacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), The Heritage Foundation, and the American Bankers Association.

The Institute for Justice has litigated numerous civil forfeiture cases across the country. Among them:

In 2011, the Institute for Justice represented Russ Caswell, a motel owner from Tewksbury, Massachusetts, after the federal government sought to take his property through civil forfeiture. After a four-day trial in 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts dismissed the government’s forfeiture action.

In 2013, the Institute filed suit on behalf of Terry Dehko a grocery store owner in Fraser, Michigan. Federal agents seized Dehko’s bank account without charging him with a crime but claiming he had made frequent deposits of less than $10,000 into his bank account in an effort to avoid bank regulations. Later that year, the IRS returned Dehko’s money.

In 2014, the Institute filed three federal suits on behalf of those who had their money or property seized by the government through civil forfeiture:

IJ filed a class action lawsuit against the City of Philadelphia challenging the city’s use of civil forfeiture, which often targeted minorities and the poor. In 2018, the city agreed to return $3 million is seized assets to those whose cash and property was taken.

The Institute filed suit on behalf of Iowa restaurant owner Carole Hinders, who had her bank account of $33,000 seized by the IRS, despite never being accused of a crime. Later that year, the IRS agreed to return all of her money.

The Institute filed suit on behalf of Jeffrey, Richard and Mitch Hirsch from Long Island, New York, after the IRS seized $446,000 from their candy and snack wholesale company without filing any criminal complaint against them. The Hirsch brothers had made deposits of under $10,000 into their bank account, which the government called “structuring.” In 2015, the IRS agreed to return all of the Hirsch’s money.

In 2019, President Donald Trump signed a law that now forbids the IRS from seizing bank accounts based on nothing but the allegation of structuring.

In 2021, the Institute won a legal battle against the Drug Enforcement Administration after it seized $30,000—the life savings—of shoeshine man Kermit Warren as he was traveling through the airport in Columbus, Ohio.

In 2023, the Institute for Justice secured the return of $39,500 to North Carolina shipping company owner Jerry Johnson. Although he earned the money legally and it is not illegal to travel with cash, Phoenix police seized Johnson’s money when he flew into Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.

Additional Institute for Justice lawsuits successfully challenging civil forfeiture have been filed in North Carolina, Kentucky, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Connecticut, Wyoming and elsewhere.

==== Property searches ====
The Institute for Justice has litigated numerous cases challenging what it sees as the unconstitutional searching of private property. Among its areas of litigation are:

===== Warrantless searches of rental properties =====
The Institute has successfully challenged unconstitutional rental inspection requirements in Marietta, Georgia and Park Forest, Illinois.

===== Government searches of “open fields” =====
Today, the government may inspect and place cameras on private property without a warrant or the property owner’s consent as long as this does not include the area immediately surrounding the property owner’s home. This is known as the open fields doctrine. The Institute for Justice is challenging such searches in Pennsylvania and Tennessee.

Moreover, several state courts have rejected the open fields doctrine under their own state constitutional search-and-seizure provisions. [Proposed cite: &quot;See, e.g.&quot;, &quot;Faulkner v. State&quot;, 98 So. 691 (Miss. 1924); &quot;State v. Bullock&quot;, 901 P.2d 61 (Mont. 1995); &quot;People v. Scott&quot;, 593 N.E.2d 1328 (N.Y. 1992); &quot;State v. Dixson&quot;, 766 P.2d 1015 (Or. 1988); &quot;Welch v. State&quot;, 289 S.W. 510 (Tenn. 1926); &quot;State v. Kirchoff&quot;, 587 A.2d 988 (Vt. 1991); &quot;State v. Johnson&quot;, 879 P.2d 984 (Wash. Ct. App. 1994).]

===== Fines and fees =====
Local governments impose fines and fees for minor traffic violations and property code violations to fund their budgets without raising taxes. Such actions, however, create financial incentives for municipalities to maximize revenue rather than address public safety issues.

The Institute for Justice continues to litigate cases challenging excessive and arbitrary government-imposed fines and fees in:

Pagedale, Missouri, where the city could fine residents for having mismatched curtains, walking on the left-hand side of a crosswalk and having barbeques in the front of a home, among other infractions. The U.S. Department of Justice cited the excessive use of fines and fees as among the issues that sparked the riots in nearby Ferguson, Missouri. In 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri finalized a consent decree in which Pagedale agreed to eliminate its municipal code dealing with fines and fees for what it deemed “nuisance” behaviors.

Charlestown, Indiana, where the mayor had imposed fines against low-income homeowners in an effort to help a developer secure the land for a new development project.

Brookside, Alabama, where the municipality of 1,253 residents saw fines and fees rise by 640 percent in four years to pay for half of the city government’s income.

In 2019, the Institute for Justice won &quot;Timbs v. Indiana&quot;, a U.S. Supreme Court that for the first time that held the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s 8th amendment protection against excessive fines applies to state and local governments.

=== Freedom of speech ===

==== Occupational licensing and speech====
In 1997, the Institute filed suit on behalf of Internet and software publishers challenging registration requirements by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC sought to require the publishers to register with the commission before they could offer generalized opinions on commodity markets. In 1999, U.S. District Court Judge Ricardo Urbina struck down the registration requirement as unconstitutional. In 2000, the CFTC adopted a new rule stating that those who published impersonal, standardized commodity trading advice no longer needed to register with the government, thus ending the litigation and marking one of the earliest protections for free speech among Internet and software publishers.

In 2003, the Institute for Justice challenged California’s requirement that—unlike newspapers or magazines—Internet advertising companies, including its client ForSaleByOwner.com, had to secure a government-issued real estate brokers license before they could provide information online. In 2004, the U.S. District Court in Sacramento struck down the law as “wholly arbitrary.”  The Institute for Justice won a similar victory before the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire in 2008 on behalf of ZeroBrokerFees.com.

In 2013, newspaper columnist John Rosemond filed suit against the Kentucky Board of Examiners of Psychology when it ordered him to stop publishing his advice column in Kentucky newspapers because it constituted the unlicensed practice of psychology. That same year, the Institute for Justice won a similar free speech case on behalf of North Carolina blogger Steve Cooksey, known as “the caveman blogger,” who had been told by the North Carolina Board of Dietetics/Nutrition that he could not provide dietary advice without first receiving a license from the state.

The Institute for Justice has litigated several occupational speech cases on behalf of tour guides in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina and on behalf of interior designers in New Mexico, Texas, Connecticut, Oklahoma and Florida.

==== Political speech====
In 2006, the Institute for Justice filed a successful suit against the Colorado Attorney General challenging the state’s campaign finance laws for stifling free speech. Residents of Parker North, Colorado, who had engaged in a grassroots effort to stop the annexation of their neighborhood into the town of Parker had spent more than $200 in their campaign and were then subject to the state’s campaign finance reporting requirements, which included registering with the state, tracking and reporting all contributions and expenditures, and disclosing the identities of anyone who contributed money to their efforts. In 2010, the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state’s ballot-issue registration and disclosure laws violated the First Amendment as applied to the grassroots group.

In 2010, the Institute won a federal lawsuit before the en banc U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of SpeechNow.org. As a result of the ruling, the Federal Election Commission could not ban an independent group of citizens from accepting unlimited donations to advocate regarding ballot issues. This led to the creation of super PACs.

In 2011, the Institute for Justice argued and won a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Arizona Free Enterprise Club’s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett&quot;, which struck down Arizona’s “matching funds” provision. Under Arizona’s law, the government gave publicly funded candidates additional funds when privately funded candidates and independent groups spent more than the amounts allotted to publicly funded candidates.

In 2013, the Institute won challenges to grassroots political speech in Mississippi and Arizona.

In 2018, IJ earned a victory in &quot;Holland v. Williams&quot;, a case that ultimately led to the complete invalidation of Colorado’s private enforcement system of campaign finance laws.

====Retaliation====
Investigative journalist and author Carla Main was sued for defamation by developer H. Walker Royall after Main wrote a book exposing his efforts to use eminent domain to remove a family-owned business in Freeport, Texas to make way for a luxury marina development. The Institute for Justice represented Main for free and won on her behalf before the Texas Fifth District Court of Appeals.

IJ won a similar legal fight on behalf of Kelly Gallaher, a citizen journalist from Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, who was sued by the village attorney after Gallaher criticized him.

==== Commercial speech====
In 2017, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously in favor of a Florida dairy farmer represented by the Institute for Justice who challenged the state&#x27;s regulation that banned her from using the term &quot;skim milk&quot; for her product.

Through litigation, media relations and lobbying, the Institute has successfully challenged five interior-design &quot;titling laws&quot; (in Connecticut, Florida, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas) which restricted its clients&#x27; advertising of their services. IJ did likewise on behalf of an engineer in Oregon who challenged a city&#x27;s red-light cameras.

====Signs====
The Institute for Justice challenged Redmond, Washington when it banned Blazing Bagels from using portable signs but allowed portable signs for real estate companies. Ultimately, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Blazing Bagels owner Dennis Ballen that the ban amounted to content-based discrimination of free speech. The Institute successfully challenged a similar ban in Lynnwood, Washington on behalf of the Futon Factory.

In 2016, in a case the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the Institute for Justice’s clients then remanded to the lower court, IJ challenged Norfolk, Virginia’s effort to ban a property owner from hanging a large sign protesting the government’s taking of his property through eminent domain. The final ruling in that case was handed down by the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

In 2020, the Institute successfully defended the owners of Lonesome Dove saloon in Mandan, North Dakota after the city started fining the establishment for having its business name in a mural on the side of its building.

=== School vouchers and private schools ===
The organization has litigated several cases related to education reform and school vouchers, including four successful cases that went to the Supreme Court: &quot;Zelman v. Simmons-Harris&quot; (2002), &quot;Garriott v. Winn&quot; (2010), &quot;Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue&quot; (2020) and &quot;Carson v. Makin&quot;. In the &quot;Zelman&quot; case, the Supreme Court ruled that parents can use public money (in the form of school vouchers) to pay tuition at private schools, including parochial schools. The Institute represented parents in that case. In the &quot;Garriott&quot; case, the court dismissed a challenge to a program in Arizona that gave state tax credits for contributions to charitable organizations that provided scholarships for private school tuition. The institute argued in favor of dismissal. In the &quot;Espinoza&quot; case, the court ruled that Montana could not prohibit families from using tuition scholarships, which were funded by tax credit-eligible contributions to nonprofit scholarship organizations, at religiously affiliated schools. In the &quot;Carson&quot; case, the court ruled that Maine could not exclude children from a publicly funded tuition assistance program because their parent&#x27;s selected schools that provide religious instruction as part of their curriculum.

== Activism and coalitions ==
The institute maintains training programs, activism networks, and partnerships with other organizations.

The IJ Clinic on Entrepreneurship is a joint project of the Institute for Justice and the University of Chicago Law School. The clinic provides free legal services for startups and other entrepreneurs in economically disadvantaged communities in the Chicago area.

The organization provides educational opportunities for law students, such as a yearly conference for law students at George Washington University. According to the Institute for Justice, participants in the conference, along with the organization&#x27;s former law clerks and interns, can join the institute&#x27;s &quot;Human Action Network&quot;. The institute offers to match network members with volunteer and pro-bono opportunities in their local communities. The organization also recruits volunteers for its &quot;Liberty in Action&quot; project, for support activism by non-lawyers. The institute founded the Castle Coalition in 2002 to provide more specific tools for activists in the area of eminent domain abuse.

== Finances ==
IJ operates as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit. Charity Navigator has given the institute a four-star rating (out of four) for financial transparency and efficiency in each year since it began evaluating charities in 2001.

According to the institute, 85 percent of contributions in 2012 came from individuals, with 14 percent coming from foundations and 1 percent coming from businesses. As of 2005, IJ did not actively solicit corporate donations. According to information provided to the Internal Revenue Service, the organization spent about $12.8 million in the fiscal year ending June 2013. In that year, 83.2% of money spent went to the programs and services the institute delivers, with the rest going to administrative expenses (9.4%) and fund-raising expenses (7.2%).

<text>Walter Burkert (; 2 February 1931 – 11 March 2015) was a German scholar of Greek mythology and cult.

A professor of classics at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, he taught in the UK and the US. He has influenced generations of students of religion since the 1960s, combining in the modern way the findings of archaeology and epigraphy with the work of poets, historians, and philosophers. He was a member of both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

He published books on the balance between lore and science among the followers of Pythagoras, and more extensively on ritual and archaic cult survival, on the ritual killing at the heart of religion, on mystery religions, and on the reception in the Hellenic world of Near Eastern and Persian culture, which sets Greek religion in its wider Aegean and Near Eastern context.

== Personal life ==
Burkert was born in Neuendettelsau. He married Maria Bosch in 1957 and they had three children, Reinhard, Andrea and Cornelius. He died on 11 March 2015 in Zürich, Switzerland.

== First academic era ==
He studied classical philology, history, and philosophy at the Universities of Erlangen and Munich (1950–1954), and obtained his doctorate in philosophy at Erlangen in 1955. Following his marriage, he became an assistant in course teaching at Erlangen for five years (1957–1961) and, then returned to his former university as lecturer for another five years (until 1966). From early 1965 he worked as a junior fellow in the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, D.C. for one year. The first academic era of his life ended with a placement as professor of classical philology at Technische Universität Berlin (1966–1969), and as guest professor at Harvard University for a year (1968).

==Second academic era==
The start of a new era began in 1981 when his work of ancient Greek religious anthropology, &quot;Homo Necans&quot; (1972), was published in an Italian translation, followed in 1983 by an English translation. The book is today considered an outstanding account of concepts in Greek religion. He was professor of classical philology at the University of Zurich (1969–1996); visiting professor of classical literature at the University of California for two years (1977 and 1988); lecturer at Harvard in 1982; dean of the philosophical faculty I at Zürich (1986–1988); and presented the Gifford Lectures at the University of St Andrews in Scotland (1989). After holding these posts and receiving numerous honorary awards (including, in 1990, the Balzan Prize for the Study of the Ancient World), he retired as an emeritus in 1996. He died in Zürich, aged 84.

==Academic works==
Three of his most important academic works (a selection from seventeen books and two hundred essays, including encyclopedia contributions and memorabilia), which are still at the base of the study of Hellenic religion, are &quot;Homo Necans&quot; (1972, English 1983), &quot;Greek Religion&quot; (1977, English 1985), and &quot;Ancient Mystery Cults&quot; (1982 lectures, published 1987).

In his preface to the English translation of &quot;Homo Necans&quot; Burkert, who characterised himself on this occasion as &quot;a philologist who starts from ancient Greek texts and attempts to find biological, psychological and sociological explanations for religious phenomena&quot;, expressed some of the principles underlying a book that had seemed somewhat revolutionary to German readers in 1972 in its consistent application of inter-relationships of myth and ritual, the application to texts of the kind of functionalism espoused in Jane Ellen Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Themis&quot; and the use of structuralism to elucidate an ethology of Greek religion, its social aspect. Burkert confirmed that an impetus for his book had come from Konrad Lorenz, &quot;On Aggression&quot;, &quot;which seemed to offer new insight into the disquieting manifestations of violence.&quot; The book argues that solidarity was achieved among the Greeks through a sacred crime with due reparations: &quot;for the strange prominence of animal slaughter in ancient religion this still seems to be the most economical, and most humane explanation&quot; (p. xv). Its first chapter &quot;Sacrifice as an Act of Killing&quot; offers conclusions that are supported in the ensuing chapters through individual inquiries into myth, festival and ritual, in which the role of poetic creation and re-creation are set aside &quot;in order to confront the power and effect of tradition as fully as possible&quot;. The term &quot;gods&quot;, Burkert concludes, remains fluid, whereas sacrifice is a &quot;fact&quot; (p. xv).

==Burkert&#x27;s theory of sacrificial ritual==
In 1985, Burkert used ancient sources (both literary and visual representations) to put together some of the pieces of how ancient Greek sacrificial ritual actually proceeded, and to link together the ritual with myth. Firstly, under the direction of the priest, priestess, father, mother (at least, in certain women&#x27;s rites like Thesmophoria), or king, a basket containing the utensils and a bowl of water were placed around the altar. The participants then dipped their hands into the consecrated water, and sprinkled it on the altar, victim and offerer. Salted-barley corns from the basket were thrown on the animal&#x27;s head and into the altar fire. A lock of hair from the animal is then cut and burned, libation being poured on the altar with prayer. After silence is proclaimed, the music of flutes begins and the animal is slain. The larger animals were killed with a sacrificial axe. The head is turned toward the heavens, and the throat cut. The blood then spreads on the altar and is caught in a vessel. In early literary sources such as the Homeric epics the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, onlooking women raise a cry of worship (&quot;ololugma&quot;) at this point in the &quot;ritual&quot;.

After the animal is skinned and cut into pieces, the inner parts are tasted and shared, and a part burned on the altar with incense. The remainder is roasted and eaten by all participants present. If the entrails are of normal shape and color, it is an omen that the sacrifice is acceptable to the gods. In both the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, as well as other early sources such as the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Hermes&quot;, the priest or sacrifice-leader wrapped the thigh pieces in fat and burned them on the altar. The tail and back, along with other bones and pieces with less meat left over were burned with a libation. After this procedure, it was then that the worshippers shared the roasted meal, while music and dance took place in the service of the gods. At some special festivals, there are instances where everyone in the banquet consumes hundreds of animal sacrifices.

<text>Clint Bolick (born December 26, 1957) is a justice of the Arizona Supreme Court. Previously, he served as Vice President of Litigation at the conservative/libertarian Goldwater Institute. He co-founded the libertarian Institute for Justice, where he was the Vice President and Director of Litigation from 1991 until 2004. He led two cases that went before the Supreme Court of the United States. He has also defended state-based school choice programs in the Supreme Courts of Wisconsin and Ohio.

==Early life and education==

Bolick was born on December 26, 1957 in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Bolick grew up in nearby Hillside, New Jersey and graduated from Hillside High School in 1975. He graduated from Drew University in 1979 and received his Juris Doctor from the University of California Davis School of Law in 1982. As a law student, he supported laws and legal rulings that knocked down racial discrimination (calling Brown v. Board of Education a &quot;triumph of the principle of equality&quot;), and was a vocal opponent of Affirmative Action-based admission policies.

In 1980, he ran as a Libertarian for a seat in the California State Assembly. He lost to an incumbent Democrat but garnered 7.1% of the vote. (In that election, the Libertarian presidential ticket earned about 1% of the vote nationwide.)

==Career==

===Mountain States Legal Foundation===
In 1982, he joined a public interest law firm, the Mountain States Legal Foundation in Denver, Colorado. He was hired by the foundation&#x27;s acting president, William H. &quot;Chip&quot; Mellor. In 1984, Mellor left the organization over a conflict with one of the foundation&#x27;s sponsors. Bolick also left, believing that the foundation was more interested in protecting business interests than in promoting economic freedom. In 2005, he said:

Chip and I discovered that there is a world of difference between an organization that is pro-business and an organization that is pro-free enterprise.

After their break with Mountain States, they began planning a free-enterprise public interest law firm that would follow a philosophy of &quot;economic liberty.&quot; These plans would lead to the founding of the Institute for Justice in 1991.

===Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Justice Department===
Bolick joined the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 1985. While he only stayed at the EEOC for a year, he became friends with its chairman, future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. (Thomas is the godfather to Bolick&#x27;s second son.) Thomas helped convince him that removing economic barriers for the poor was more important than fighting race-based &quot;reverse discrimination.&quot; In 1991, he would support adding punitive damages to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He explained &quot;It seemed to me that if you didn&#x27;t want quotas, you had to have tough remedies and punitive damages against recalcitrant discriminators ... That very much came out of Thomas.&quot; Thomas also shaped his preferred remedy for inequality: removing laws and regulations he viewed as preventing the poor from starting small businesses. Thomas did this in part by telling Bolick about his grandfather, who began with a hand-built pushcart and built a profitable delivery service that comfortably supported his family, only to encounter threats from regulations designed to destroy Black-owned businesses.

Bolick left the EEOC to join the Justice Department in 1986. In 1988, he wrote his first book, &quot;Changing Course.&quot; In this book, he defined civil rights in part from the perspective of removing economic and regulatory barriers for the poor and disadvantaged.

===Landmark Center for Civil Rights===
In 1989, he left the Justice Department and, with a grant from the Landmark Legal Foundation, started a public advocacy law practice in Washington, D.C. In its first case, the Landmark Center for Civil Rights represented Washington shoeshine stand owner Ego Brown in his attempt to overturn a Jim Crow-era law against bootblack stands on public streets. The law was designed to restrict economic opportunities for African-Americans, but was still being enforced 85 years after its passage. He sued the District of Columbia on Brown&#x27;s behalf, and the law was overturned in 1989.

While working for the Landmark Legal Foundation, he defended the first Wisconsin school voucher program in court.

He supported Thomas during his confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court. On July 31, 1991, about 45 people from Thomas&#x27; hometown of Pin Point, Georgia visited Washington to show support for the nominee. At the time, Bolick told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the Landmark Center for Civil Rights raised $3,000 to pay for bus rental and contributed another $1,100 for hotel charges.

===Institute for Justice===
In 1991, Bolick and Chip Mellor (his former boss from the Mountain States Legal Foundation) co-founded the Institute for Justice with funding from billionaire Charles Koch. He was the Vice President and Director of Litigation from 1991 until 2004. The organization litigates on behalf of small businesses faced with regulations that it views as unjustified or anti-competitive. It also promotes school choice, property rights, and free speech. Bolick and the institute were active in defending a Cleveland, Ohio school voucher program, which was declared constitutional in a 2002 Supreme Court case, &quot;Zelman v. Simmons-Harris&quot; The court ruled in favor of a Cincinnati, Ohio school voucher program, allowing the use of public money to pay tuition at private and parochial schools. 
He led the case &quot;Swedenburg v. Kelly&quot; while at the institute. This case was consolidated with &quot;Granholm v. Heald&quot; and considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005. Bolick argued the case before the court, along with attorney Kathleen Sullivan. The court struck down regulatory barriers to direct interstate shipment of wine to consumers.

In April 1993, he wrote an op-ed for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; opposing two appointments by the Clinton administration (Lani Guinier to assistant attorney general for civil rights and Norma V. Cantu to assistant secretary for civil rights in the Department of Education). The &quot;Journal&quot; ran the piece under the headline &quot;Clinton&#x27;s Quota Queens.&quot; After the piece was published, he distributed information about Guinier&#x27;s writings and interpreted them for reporters. He also appeared on &quot;Nightline&quot; and &quot;Crossfire&quot; to oppose her appointment. The article and Bolick&#x27;s subsequent efforts were credited with helping end Guinier&#x27;s appointment. On June 3, 1993, President Bill Clinton withdrew her nomination. Clinton stated that he had not read Guinier&#x27;s writings at the time of her nomination, and called some of them &quot;anti-democratic&quot;. Clinton went on to describe the effort to stop Guinier&#x27;s appointment as &quot;a campaign of right-wing distortion and vilification&quot;, and according to press reports referred to Bolick&#x27;s editorial with &quot;particular scorn&quot;. Other critics accused Bolick and conservatives who opposed Guinier of racism and sexism, often citing the phrase &quot;quota queen&quot; as evidence.

===Alliance for School Choice===
In 2004, Bolick joined the Alliance for School Choice, a national non-profit educational policy group advocating school choice programs across the United States. He was this organization&#x27;s first president and general counsel.

===Goldwater Institute===

In 2007, he became the Vice President for Litigation at the Goldwater Institute when that organization added a litigation group.

Bolick helped to draft model legislation known as the &#x27;Health Care Freedom Act&#x27; that would prohibit health insurers from accepting federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act that trigger the employer mandate. Arizona and Oklahoma voters approved a version of the Health Care Freedom Act in their respective November 2010 general elections.} Also in November 2010, voters in Arizona, South Carolina, South Dakota and Utah adopted a measure he drafted called Save Our Secret Ballot, which guarantees workers the right to a secret-ballot vote in union-organizing elections.

In 2012, he was an attorney for a Mesa tattoo parlor that had been denied a business license by the city. The case resulted in the Arizona Supreme Court declaring tattoos Constitutionally protected free speech. Bolick marked his victory by getting a small tattoo of a scorpion on his index finger.

On July 30, 2015, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called for the deportation of all of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Bolick called Trump&#x27;s idea &quot;impractical and opposed by a large majority of Americans.&quot;

===Appointment to Arizona Supreme Court===
On January 6, 2016, Governor Doug Ducey appointed Bolick to the Arizona Supreme Court. He won retention for a 6-year term in 2018.

<text>The Matica srpska (, ) is the oldest Serbian language independent, non-profit, non-governmental and cultural-scientific Serbian national institution. It was founded on June 1, 1826, in Pest (today a part of Budapest) by the Serbian habsburg legislator Jovan Hadžić and other prominent members of the Serbian Revolution and National Revival. The Matica was moved to Novi Sad in 1864. It is the oldest matica in the world.

The main goals are to restore and promote Serbian national and cultural identity in the fields of art, science, spiritual creativity, economy and public life as well as to care for social development of Serbia. The literary and cultural society played a huge role in the flourishing of science and culture of the Serbs of Vojvodina, Serbia.

The need for national homogenization, enlightenment, as well as the publication of Serbian books, were the main reasons for the formation of such a Society. The immediate reason for founding Matica Srpska was the need to take over the Serbian Chronicle (later the Chronicle of Matica Srpska), the oldest Serbian literary magazine and then the only Serbian newspaper, which was threatened with extinction.

The Matica Srpska Publishing Center has regular publishing activities, including several projects of national importance, such as &quot;Ten Centuries of Serbian Literature&quot; (&quot;Десет векова српске књижевности&quot;).

Today, in the Palace of Matica srpska in Novi sad more than hundred book presentations, scientific symposia, round table discussions, professional and scientific lectures and concerts of classical music are being organized annually. Matica Srpska is also one of the largest and most important book and magazine publishers in Serbia.

Matica Srpska operates on the territory of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina (Republika Srpska) as Association of Members of Matica Srpska in Republika Srpska, as well in Montenegro as Association of members of Matica Srpska in Montenegro. In addition, Matica Srpska operates in Vienna.

==Etymology==
The name Matica is best translated as &quot;The Centre&quot;, although the term &quot;matica&quot; in this context translates as &quot;queen bee&quot; or &quot;parent body&quot;, and the adjective &quot;srpska&quot; refers to Serbia and/or Serbs. According to this, the name of Matica srpska can be literally translated into English as &quot;Parent body of the Serbs&quot;.
==History==

Of all the Slavic maticas, &quot;Matica Srpska&quot; was the first to be established in the Habsburg Empire at the time of a Serb national and cultural awakening.
During the national awakening from the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, the Serbs of the Serbian Vojvodina played a significant role as, though &quot;by force of historical circumstance, they formed at this period the core of Serb intellectual life&quot;. One of the most important tasks facing the Serbs, in advancing cultural-national rebirth, was the solution of the literary language problem, and, as a result of the first fifty years of the 19th century, saw the Vojvodina Serbs engaged in an intense debate about the kind of literary language that their newly revitalized, emerging nation should adopt.

For the Slavic people, as well as the non-Slavs, under the Habsburg Empire, the &quot;Matica&quot; foundation fomented the development of national cultures. Indeed, the oldest is Matica srpska founded in 1826 in Pest by Jovan Hadžić and his business backers, Josif Milovuk (1793–1850), Jovan Demetrović (1778–1830), Gavrilo Bozitovac (1789–1856), Andrej Rozmirović, Petar Rajić, and Djordje Stanković (1782–1853) at the same time as the Hungarian Academy was being built. Jovan Hadžić prepared its by-laws, secured its charter, and also served as its first president while Josif Milovuk served as its first secretary. In addition to books, it published the journal &quot;Serbski letopis&quot;, founded two years earlier by Georgije Magarašević, Pavel Jozef Šafárik, and Lukijan Mušicki in Novi Sad, where Magarašević was professor and Šafárik the director of Novi Sad&#x27;s Serbian Gymnasium.

The story of the &quot;Matica Srpska&quot; actually began in 1824, when the Austrian authorities permitted writer Georgije Magarašević, a professor at a gymnasium in the town of Novi Sad, to publish a literary and scholarly journal entitled &quot;Serbski letopis&quot; (&quot;Serbian Annals&quot;). Magarašević had little financial backing but soon found benefactors who supported his efforts. In time, the writers and editors of the publication developed into a learned society, successfully overcoming pressures applied by mistrustful Austrian officials as well as later financial difficulties. With varying degrees of success but with great perseverance, it has continued to support and guide Serb intellectual endeavor, first, as a part of the Habsburg Empire and much later as part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.

In 1838, a wealthy Serb landowner, Sava Tekelija, left the &quot;Matica&quot; a legacy to support Serbian students at the University of Pest and a college named after him, Tekelijanum (&quot;Tokolyanum&quot; in Hungarian). The Hungarian authorities were suspicious of the &quot;Matica&quot; and even suspended its activities in 1835–1836 for alleged pan-Slavism, but they resisted Serb efforts to move the institution to Novi Sad. In 1863 the move was nevertheless accomplished, and the &quot;Matica&quot;, as well as the journal &quot;Letopis&quot;, is flourishing there today.

The &quot;Matica Srpska&quot; Society was one of the initiators of the Novi Sad agreement on the Serbo-Croatian language (1954), and it led the action for making the unique orthography of the language (1960). They compiled &quot;The Vocabulary of Serbian Standard Literary Language&quot; in six volumes (1967–76).

In Yugoslavia, &quot;Matica Srpska&quot; was one half of a joint project (with Matica hrvatska) to develop a common Serbo-Croatian dictionary. Mid-way through the project (1967), Matica hrvatska, by the declaration of principles about the Croatian language, withdrew, and Matica srpska was left to finish the dictionary on her own.

&quot;Matica Srpska&quot; has been an example to many Slavic nations. Based on this model the following institutions were established: Czech Matica in 1831, Illyrian Matica in 1842 (in 1874 renamed to Matica hrvatska); Matica Lužičkosrpska in 1847, Halych-Russian Matica in Lviv in 1848; Moravian Matica in 1849; Matica Dalmatinska in Zadar in 1861; Slovak Matica in 1863; Slovenian Matica in 1864; Matica Opava in 1877; Matica in the Teschen Princedom in 1898. (from which Silesian Matica came to be in 1968); Polish Matica in Lviv (1882); Educational Matica in the Teschen Princedom in 1885; Educational Matica in Warsaw in 1905; Bulgarian Matica in Constantinople in 1909 and the new Bulgarian Matica in 1989.

==Activities and library==
Matica Srpska publishes the &quot;Letopis Matice srpske&quot; magazine, which is one of the oldest in the world, being continuously published since 1824.

The institution has already published numerous books by authors such as Jovan Sterija Popović since its inception.

The Law of the &quot;Matica Srpska Society&quot; (1986) regulates matters of endowment and legacy, given by the national benefactors, and how money is spent for various cultural and educational purposes.

The &quot;Matica Srpska&quot; has a library with over 3,500,000 books and other documents.

<text>Codeine is an American indie rock band formed in 1989 in New York City. They released two full-length albums—&quot;Frigid Stars LP&quot; in 1990 and &quot;The White Birch&quot; in 1994. Although the group broke up in 1994 shortly after the release of &quot;The White Birch&quot;, their subdued and melancholic style helped pioneer the then-nascent slowcore subgenre of indie rock. Codeine has since reunited on two occasions: the first for a handful of shows in 2012, and a second time for a series of shows in New York City and Los Angeles in 2023.

==History==
Codeine was formed by members Stephen Immerwahr (vocals, bass), Chris Brokaw (drums), and John Engle (guitar). Codeine pioneered the indie rock subgenre slowcore, but with a more experimental attitude than other bands in the genre, such as Low, Idaho and Red House Painters. The band&#x27;s original tone, marked by slow tempos, Immerwahr&#x27;s nasal vocals, and Engle&#x27;s ringing Telecaster, stayed consistent during their career.

Codeine released their first album &quot;Frigid Stars LP&quot; on the German label Glitterhouse in August 1990. The album was released on Sub Pop early the following year.

The &quot;Barely Real&quot; EP was released in November 1992. Immerwahr rejected several of the songs after the recording session. Some of these songs would be re-recorded for the final album. The song &quot;W.&quot; is a solo performance on piano by David Grubbs (of Bastro, Squirrel Bait and Gastr del Sol). A somewhat different full-band version of the song appears on Codeine&#x27;s next album, now titled &quot;Wird&quot;.

Brokaw left the band after the release of &quot;Barely Real&quot; to play full-time with his other band Come, and after Josh Madell of Antietam replaced him temporarily for a US tour, he was replaced permanently by Rex drummer Doug Scharin.

Codeine&#x27;s final release was the full-length album &quot;The White Birch&quot;, released in May 1994. David Grubbs also participated on the album. After this release, the band broke up. Doug Scharin continued in Rex and June of 44, and later as the band leader of HiM. Following the demise of Come, original drummer Chris Brokaw became a solo artist and itinerant musician, including playing drums for The New Year and playing guitar with Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and with Christina Rosenvinge.

=== Reunion ===
In February 2012, Codeine announced it would perform on the request of Mogwai at All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&#x27; sister event, I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror on May 26, 2012, in London, England at Alexandra Palace, along with other shows, to commemorate a comprehensive reissue of their recordings by The Numero Group in June 2012. Codeine&#x27;s final reunion show was at Le Poisson Rouge in New York on July 15, 2012.

In September 2022, the band released &quot;Dessau&quot;, an album of 8 songs recorded at Harold Dessau Recording in 1992 that was originally intended to appear on their second album, but was scrapped due to production conflicts. Chris Brokaw would leave the band shortly after the album was shelved. Two songs from these sessions would be re-recorded and released on &quot;Barely Real&quot;, others re-recorded for &quot;The White Birch&quot;; four songs from the Dessau sessions were first released on their 2012 compilation &quot;When I See the Sun&quot;.

Codeine&#x27;s first show in 11 years took place in New York City&#x27;s Union Pool on February 11, 2023, prior to playing the Numero Group&#x27;s 20th anniversary festival in Los Angeles on February 18 and 19.

<doc id="604299" wikidata="Q1439106" url="?curid=604299" title="Army–Navy Game">
<text>The Army–Navy Game is an American college football rivalry game between the Army Black Knights of the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, and the Navy Midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy (USNA) at Annapolis, Maryland. The Black Knights, or Cadets, and Midshipmen each represent their service&#x27;s oldest officer commissioning sources. As such, the game has come to embody the spirit of the interservice rivalry of the United States Armed Forces. The game marks the end of the college football regular season and the third and final game of the season&#x27;s Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Trophy series, which also includes the Air Force Falcons of the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) near Colorado Springs, Colorado. The series has been uninterrupted since 1930. Through the 2024 meeting, Navy leads the series .

The Army–Navy Game is one of the most traditional and enduring rivalries in college football. It has been frequently attended by the President of the United States. The game has been nationally televised each year since 1945 on either ABC, CBS, or NBC. CBS has televised the game since 1996 and has the rights to the broadcast through 2038. The December 2024 announcement of CBS Sports&#x27; extension will also give their international channels rights in the United Kingdom and Australia. Instant replay made its American debut in the 1963 Army–Navy game. Since 2009, the game has been held on the second Saturday of December and following FBS conference championship weekend. The game has been primarily played in Philadelphia, but the game has also been held in multiple locations including the New York area, the Baltimore–Washington area, Chicago, Pasadena, California and the Boston area.

==History==
The first game between Army and Navy was on November 29, 1890. Since then, the two academies have played annually in all but ten years, and have played in consecutive annual games every season since 1930. Throughout its history, the game has been played in several neutral locations, including New York City and Baltimore, but it is most commonly played in Philadelphia, which is roughly equidistant from the two academies. Historically played on the Saturday after Thanksgiving (a date on which most other major college football teams end their regular seasons), the game is now played on the second Saturday in December and is traditionally the last regular-season game played in NCAA Division I football.

For much of the first two thirds of the 20th century, both Army and Navy were often national powers, and the game occasionally had national championship implications. However, as the level of play in college football increased, both academies&#x27; stringent admissions standards and height and weight limits made it difficult for them to compete. Since 1963, only the 1996, 2010, 2016, 2017, and 2024 games have seen both teams enter with winning records. Nonetheless, the game is considered a college football institution. The tradition associated with the game has kept it airing nationally on radio since 1930 and on television since 1945. It has remained an over-the-air broadcast even in the age of cable, satellite, and streaming.

The game is especially emotional for the seniors, called &quot;first classmen&quot; by both academies, since it is typically the last competitive regular season football game they will ever play (though they sometimes play in a subsequent bowl game). However, some participants in the Army–Navy Game have gone on to professional football careers. For example, quarterback Roger Staubach (Navy, 1965) went on to a Hall of Fame career with the National Football League&#x27;s Dallas Cowboys that included starting at quarterback in two Super Bowl victories (including being named the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl VI), and Alejandro Villanueva (Army, 2010) was later an offensive tackle with the NFL&#x27;s Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.

The game is the last of three contests in the annual Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Trophy series, awarded to each season&#x27;s winner of the triangular series among Army, Navy, and Air Force since 1972. The rivalries Army and Navy have with Air Force are much less intense than the Army–Navy rivalry, primarily due to the relative youth of the USAFA, established in 1954, and the physical distance between the USAFA and the other two schools. The Army–Air Force and Navy–Air Force games are usually played at the academies&#x27; regular home fields, although on occasion they have been held at a neutral field.

Since 1901, there have been ten sitting presidents of the United States to attend the Army–Navy Game. The first was Theodore Roosevelt, who attended the game in 1901 and 1905. Harry S. Truman attended all but one edition during his eight years in office (1945–1952), missing the 1951 game due to vacation. George W. Bush and Donald Trump each attended three times; Bush in 2001, 2004, and 2008, and Trump in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Trump also attended two games as president-elect in 2016 and 2024. John F. Kennedy attended both games played during his presidency in 1961 and 1962; he was assassinated fifteen days before the 1963 game. Presidents who each attended once include Woodrow Wilson (1913), Calvin Coolidge (1924), Gerald Ford (1974), Bill Clinton (1996), and Barack Obama (2011).

On October 25, 2023, it was announced that Army would join Navy in the American Athletic Conference (AAC) in football effective in the 2024 season. As part of the arrangement, the Army–Navy Game will remain an out-of-conference date for both schools, and still be played on an annual basis. In the event that the teams possess the two highest win-loss records within the AAC, it is conceivable that they would contend in an AAC Championship game, potentially leading to the occurrence of consecutive Army–Navy Games.

==Traditions==

The rivalry between Annapolis and West Point, while friendly, is intense. The phrases &quot;Beat Navy!&quot; and &quot;Beat Army!&quot; are ingrained in the respective institutions and have become a symbol of competitiveness, not just in the Army–Navy Game, but in the service of the country. The phrases are often used at the close of (informal) letters by graduates of both academies.

A long-standing tradition at the ArmyNavy football game is to conduct a formal &quot;prisoner exchange&quot; as part of the pre-game activities. The prisoners are the cadets and midshipmen currently spending the semester studying at the sister academy. After the exchange, students have a brief reprieve to enjoy the game with their comrades. During the pre-game ceremony, the invocation is followed by the American national anthem sung by members of the USMA and USNA choirs. At the end of the game, both teams&#x27; almae matres are performed. The winning team stands alongside the losing team and faces the losing academy&#x27;s students; then the losing team accompanies the winning team, facing their students. This is done in a show of mutual respect and solidarity. Since the winning team&#x27;s alma mater is always played last, the phrase &quot;sing second&quot; has become synonymous with winning the rivalry game.

==Notable games==
Navy Midshipman (and later Admiral) Joseph Mason Reeves wore what is widely regarded as the first football helmet in the 1893 Army–Navy Game. He had been advised by a Navy doctor that another kick to his head would result in intellectual disability or even death, so he commissioned an Annapolis shoemaker to make him a helmet out of leather.

On November 27, 1926, the Army–Navy Game was held in Chicago for the National Dedication of Soldier Field as a monument to American servicemen who had fought in World War I. Navy came to the game undefeated, while Army had only lost to Notre Dame. Played before a crowd of over 100,000, the teams fought to a 21–21 tie, resulting in Navy being awarded a share of the national championship.

In both the 1944 and 1945 contests, Army and Navy entered the game ranked #1 and #2 respectively. The 1945 game was labeled the &quot;game of the century&quot; before it was played. Army (9–0) defeated Navy (7-0-1) with a score of 32–13. Navy&#x27;s tie was against Notre Dame.

In 1963, shortly after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy urged the academies to play after there had been talk of cancellation. Originally scheduled for November 30, 1963, the game was played on December 7, 1963, also coinciding with the 22nd anniversary of Pearl Harbor Day. In front of a crowd of 102,000 people in Philadelphia&#x27;s Municipal Stadium, later renamed John F. Kennedy Stadium, junior (second class midshipman) quarterback Roger Staubach led number two ranked Navy to victory which clinched a Cotton Bowl national championship matchup with Texas. Army was led by junior (second class cadet) quarterback Rollie Stichweh. Stichweh led off the game with a touchdown drive that featured the first use of instant replay. Army nearly won the game after another touchdown and two point conversion, Stichweh recovered the onside kick and drove the ball to the Navy 2 yard line. On 4th down and no timeouts, crowd noise prevented Stichweh from calling a play and time expired with the 21–15 final score. Staubach won the Heisman Trophy that year and was bumped off the scheduled cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine due to the coverage of the assassination. Stichweh and Staubach would meet again in 1964 as seniors where Stichweh&#x27;s Army would defeat Staubach&#x27;s Navy. In that game, Calvin Huey of Navy became the first African-American to play in the series. Staubach went on to serve in the Navy and afterward became a Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback with the Dallas Cowboys. Stichweh served five years in Vietnam with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. Stichweh was inducted into the Army Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.

On December 10, 2016, Army defeated Navy for the first time since 2001 with a 21–17 victory, snapping its 14-game losing streak against Navy.

In 2022, Army defeated Navy by a score of 20–17 in double overtime in the first overtime game in the series&#x27; history.

==Venues==
Only seven games have ever been held on the campus of either academy, primarily because neither team has ever played at an on-campus stadium large enough to accommodate the large crowds that attend. The rivalry&#x27;s first four games were hosted on the parade grounds of the respective academies. For all but three years since 1899, it has been held at a neutral site. Two were held on campus due to World War II travel restrictions (1942 at Navy&#x27;s old Thompson Stadium and 1943 at Michie Stadium); and the 2020 game was held at Michie Stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions in Philadelphia.

Philadelphia has been the traditional home of the Army–Navy game, due to the historic nature of the city and its location approximately halfway between West Point and Annapolis. Through the 2023 meeting, 90 of the 124 games in the series have been contested in Philadelphia, including every game from 1932 to 1982 except three games that were relocated due to World War II travel restrictions. For decades, the Pennsylvania Railroad and its successors offered game-day service to all Army–Navy games in Philadelphia using a sprawling temporary station constructed each year near Municipal Stadium on the railroad&#x27;s Greenwich freight yard. The service, with more than 40 trains serving as many as 30,000 attendees, was the single largest concentrated passenger rail movement in the country.

All games contested in Philadelphia through 1935 were played at what is now Franklin Field, the home field of the University of Pennsylvania. From 1936 through 1979, all games contested in Philadelphia were held at Municipal Stadium, renamed John F. Kennedy Stadium in 1964. From 1980 to 2001, all games contested in Philadelphia took place at Veterans Stadium. Since 2003, all games contested in Philadelphia have been played at Lincoln Financial Field.

Outside of Philadelphia, the New York area has been the most frequent Army–Navy site. The Polo Grounds holds the record for most games hosted outside of Philadelphia with nine. It was the location of all New York City games through 1927. Yankee Stadium was the site of the game in 1930 and 1931. Six games have been hosted in New Jersey: 1905 at Osborne Field at Princeton University, four games at Giants Stadium from 1989 to 2002, and 2021 at MetLife Stadium.

A number of games throughout the history of the series have also been hosted in Maryland. In Baltimore, Municipal Stadium was the location of the 1924 and 1944 games. Four games were played at M&amp;T Bank Stadium in Baltimore since 2000. In 2011 and 2024, the game was played at FedExField in Landover, Maryland.

The 2023 game was held at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

The Rose Bowl is the only site west of the Mississippi River where an Army–Navy game has been played, in 1983. Pasadena, California, home to the Rose Bowl, paid for the travel expenses of all the students and supporters of both academies, including 9,437 in all. The game was held at the Rose Bowl that year because there are a large number of military installations and servicemen and women, along with many retired military personnel, on the West Coast. The game has been held one other time in a non-East Coast venue, at Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field, which hosted the 1926 game.

<text>&quot;La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)&quot; is a song by Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released in July 1993 by record label Columbia as the second single from their second studio album, &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; (1993). It reached number 22 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Content and composition==
The song&#x27;s title is taken from the reported last words of Vincent van Gogh, &quot;La tristesse durera toujours&quot;, quoted in a letter from his younger brother Theo to their sister Elisabeth, using her nickname &quot;Lies&quot;. The letter was translated by Robert Harrison, who states that the phrase means &quot;The sadness will last forever&quot;.

The song lyrics are written from the perspective of a war veteran, containing the line &quot;wheeled out once a year, a cenotaph souvenir&quot; and tracking the bathetic progress of the former soldier&#x27;s war medal: &quot;It sells at market stalls/Parades Milan catwalks&quot;. Richey Edwards told &quot;Melody Maker&quot; newspaper, &quot;It&#x27;s a beautiful image when the war veterans turn out at the Cenotaph, [...] and everyone pretends to care ... but then they&#x27;re shuffled off again and forgotten.&quot; According to Nicky Wire, he wrote much of the song and came up with its title, whilst Edwards contributed the &quot;scream to a sigh&quot; refrain. Wire has stated that his objective in writing the song was &quot;to write about war heroes in a sympathetic way&quot;, an aim which he described as &quot;non-trendy&quot;.

According to Martin Power in his book &quot;Manic Street Preachers&quot;, the band &quot;sounded at sixes and sevens&quot; in the rest of the album, &quot;Yet, as with &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot;, they had again produced one genuine classic in the form of &#x27;La Tristessa Durera (Scream to a Sigh)&#x27;.&quot; According to Sean Moore the track&#x27;s drum part was the result of an attempt to copy a song by hip-hop group Arrested Development. James Dean Bradfield also cited the Clash&#x27;s song &quot;Car Jamming&quot; as an influence.

Edwards, unusually, played rhythm guitar on the track. Edwards was credited for rhythm guitar on all of the tracks released during his tenure with the band, but almost never actually performed the parts he was credited for due to his self-acknowledged lack of talent with the instrument. This would be only one of two tracks he would perform on, the other being a partial recording on &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;&#x27;s &quot;No Surface All Feeling&quot;.

The B-side, &quot;Patrick Bateman&quot;, is a &quot;tribute&quot; to the &quot;American Psycho&quot; character.

==Release==
&quot;La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)&quot; was released as a single on 19 July 1993 by record label Columbia. It reached number 22 in the UK Singles Chart on 31 July. In the US, a promotional version was released as &quot;Scream to a Sigh (La Tristesse Durera)&quot;. The song made an appearance in edited form on &quot;Forever Delayed&quot; (28 October 2002), the Manics&#x27; greatest hits album. The remastered album version appeared on the &quot;National Treasures – The Complete Singles&quot;, compilation.

==Accolades==
&quot;La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)&quot; was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="604310" wikidata="Q662787" url="?curid=604310" title="John Anderson (natural philosopher)">
<text>John Anderson (26 September 1726 – 13 January 1796) was a Scottish natural philosopher
and liberal educator at the forefront of the application of science to technology in the Industrial Revolution, and of the education and advancement of working men and women. He was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and was the posthumous founder of Anderson&#x27;s College (later Anderson&#x27;s Institution), which ultimately evolved into the University of Strathclyde.

==Early life and career==
Anderson was born at the manse at Rosneath, Dunbartonshire, the son of Margaret Turner (d. 1784) and Rev James Anderson His father and grandfather were prominent ministers of the church. After his father&#x27;s death he was raised by his aunt in Stirling, where he attended grammar school.

He graduated with an MA from the University of Glasgow in 1745.

During the Jacobite Rising of 1745 he served as an officer in the Hanoverian Army.

From 1755 to 1757 he was Professor of Ecclesiastical History in the University of Glasgow, and from 1757 to 1796 Professor of Natural Philosophy. He is the longest-serving natural philosophy lecturer during the 18th century.

==A scientist==
In 1760, Anderson was appointed to the more congenial post of professor of natural philosophy at the University of Glasgow. He began to concentrate on physics. He had a love of experiments, practical mechanics and inventions. He encouraged James Watt in his development of steam power. He was acquainted with Benjamin Franklin, and in 1772 he installed the first lightning conductor in Glasgow.

Anderson also wrote the pioneering textbook &quot;Institutes of Physics&quot; published in 1786, which went through five editions in ten years. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and this brought him into contact with many of the scientists of the day.

==A supporter of vocational education for working people==
His greatest love though was in providing &quot;useful learning&quot; to the working class, especially in the application of science to industry. He did this alongside his University duties, by providing non-academic lectures for artisans during the evenings. In these popular lectures he concentrated on experiments and demonstrations, and from his predilection for setting off explosions and fireworks, he acquired the nickname &quot;Jolly Jack Phosphorus&quot;.

==Radical politics==
Anderson was also known for his radical political views and was a supporter of the French Revolution. In 1791 he invented a new type of six-pound gun, which was presented to the National Convention in Paris as &quot;the gift of Science to Liberty&quot;. While he was in France, neighbouring Germany, fearing the spread of radical politics to its territory, imposed a blockade on French newspapers. Anderson suggested sending pamphlets on the wind to Germany attached to small hydrogen balloons, and this was done, with each balloon bearing an inscription translated as &quot;O&#x27;er hills and dales, and lines of hostile troops, I float majestic, bearing the laws of God and Nature to oppressed men, and bidding them with arms their rights maintain.&quot;

==Founder of a university==
Building on the lectures for artisans, he bequeathed his property for the foundation of a school in Glasgow devoted to &quot;useful learning&quot;, called Anderson&#x27;s Institution or Andersonian University. As an example of its success it enabled a young millworker, David Livingstone, to become a famous missionary doctor and the foremost explorer of his day. The Institution underwent various name-changes and a number of mergers with other colleges before arriving at its current form as the University of Strathclyde, which honours Anderson in the name of the physics building and the main library, the Andersonian Library. The city centre campus is named the John Anderson Campus.

John Anderson died in Glasgow at the age of 69. He is buried with his grandfather in Ramshorn Cemetery on Ingram Street in Glasgow. On 13 January 1996 representatives from the University of Glasgow laid a wreath to mark the bicentennial of Anderson&#x27;s death.

<doc id="604321" wikidata="Q1332014" url="?curid=604321" title="Edict of Gülhane">
<text>The [[Gülhane Park|Gülhane]] Hatt-ı Şerif (&quot;Supreme Edict of the Rosehouse&quot;) or [[Tanzimat|Tanzimât]] Fermânı (&quot;Imperial Edict of Reorganization&quot;) was a proclamation by Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid I in 1839 that launched the Tanzimât period of reforms and reorganization in the Ottoman Empire. The 125th anniversary of the edict was depicted on a former Turkish postcard stamp.

The proclamation was issued at the behest of reformist Grand Vizier Mustafa Reşid Pasha. It promised reforms such as the abolition of tax farming, reform of conscription, and guarantee of rights to all Ottoman citizens regardless of religion or ethnic group. The goal of the decree was to help modernize the empire militarily and socially so that it could compete with the Great Powers of Europe. It also was hoped the reforms would win over the disaffected parts of the empire, especially in the Ottoman controlled parts of Europe, which were largely Christian. At the time of the edict, millets (independent communal law-courts) had gained a large amount of religious autonomy within the empire, threatening the central government. This edict, along with the subsequent Imperial Reform Edict of 1856, was therefore an early step towards the empire&#x27;s goal of Ottomanism, or a unified national and legal Ottoman identity. It was published in the &quot;Tekvim-i Vekayi&quot; in Ottoman Turkish. In addition, it was published in Greek and French, the latter in &quot;Moniteur ottoman&quot;, and François Alphonse Belin, a dragoman, created his own French version, published in the &quot;Journal Asiatique&quot;.

The Edict of Gülhane did not enact any official legal changes but merely made royal promises to the empire&#x27;s subjects, and they were never fully implemented due to Christian nationalism and resentment among Muslim populations in these areas. At the end of the Crimean War, the Western powers pressured Turkey to undertake further reforms, mainly to deprive the Russians, with whom peace negotiations were then under way, of any further pretense for intervention in the internal affairs of the Ottoman Empire. The result of these pressures was the proclamation of the &quot;Hatt-ı Hümâyûn&quot; (Imperial Rescript) of 18 February 1856.

==Contents==
While the Edict of Gülhane was more complex, it consisted mainly of three demands.
The first was a guaranteed insurance of the security of life of every subject. The direction of thought here being that if a subject&#x27;s life is endangered, he/she can become a danger to others and the sultan, since people do many things out of fear in order to protect their health. If there is an absence of security to fortune, everyone is insensible to the government and public good.
The second proposed a regular system of assessing and levying taxes, troops, and duration of service. Subjects would be taxed a quota determined by their means and a reduced military term would lessen the blow that occurred to industries when the men were away. This collection of demands can be summed up under the title of governmental impositions on subjects. This new system of taxing ended tax-farming and introduced taxing based on means rather than a flat rate. 
Finally, the third dealt with reformation in the area of human rights and the justice system. The accused were to be granted public trials; individuals could possess and dispose of property in freedom; and punishments were to fit the deed regardless of rank. Reward by merit was presented in this edict. Additionally, the edict emancipated minorities, which granted them the opportunity to be conscripted. However, conscription could be avoided by minorities if they paid the Jizya. This allowed minorities of means to avoid conscription and it allowed for the military to mostly maintain its purity of minorities. Below are some of the important clauses in detail:

===Clauses===
Some of the most important clauses are as follows:

* In the future, the case of every accused party will be tried publicly, in conformity with our divine law. Until a regular sentence has been pronounced, no one can put another to death, secretly or publicly, by poison or any other form of punishment. 
* No one will be permitted to assail the honor of any one, whosoever he may be. 
* Every person will enjoy the possession of his property of every nature, and dispose of it with the most perfect liberty, without any one being able to impede him. Thus, for example, the innocent heirs of a criminal will not be deprived of their legal rights, and the property of the criminal will not be confiscated. 
* These imperial concessions extend to all our subjects, whatever religion or sect they may belong to; and they will enjoy them without any exception. 
* Perfect security is, therefore, granted by us to the inhabitants of the empire, with regard to their life, their honor, and their fortune, as the sacred text of our law demands. 
* With reference to the other points, as they must be regulated the concurrence of enlightened opinions, our Council of Justice (augmented by as many new members as may deemed necessary), to whom will be adjoined, on certain days which we shall appoint our Ministers and the Notables of the Empire, will meet for the purpose of establishing the fundamental laws on those points relating to the security of life and property, and the imposition of the taxes.

* The laws relating to the regulations of the military service will be discussed by the Military Council, holding its meetings at the Place of the Serasker.

==Changes and effects of the Edict of Gülhane==

Some of the changes instituted by the Edict of Gülhane:

*Reformed how the state related to its subjects; a more modern and unmediated relationship was developed. This helped the state run more efficiently.
*Began secularization of the state through which a new legal system of the state emerged. A state, criminal law, with less stringent rules for prosecution, was introduced to supplement the sharia, Sacred Law.
*Explosion in the bureaucracy which transformed the efficiency of the state. While in the old system bureaucrats had no salary and were paid fees by individuals, the changes brought on by the Edict of Gülhane established a state salary and gave them education.

<doc id="604333" wikidata="Q1184069" url="?curid=604333" title="Delegation (object-oriented programming)">
<text>In object-oriented programming, delegation refers to evaluating a member (property or method) of one object (the receiver) in the context of another original object (the sender). Delegation can be done explicitly, by passing the responsibilities of the sending object to the receiving object, which can be done in any object-oriented language; or implicitly, by the member lookup rules of the language, which requires language support for the feature. Implicit delegation is the fundamental method for behavior reuse in prototype-based programming, corresponding to inheritance in class-based programming. The best-known languages that support delegation at the language level are Self, which incorporates the notion of delegation through its notion of mutable parent slots that are used upon method lookup on self calls, and JavaScript; see JavaScript delegation.

The term &quot;delegation&quot; is also used loosely for various other relationships between objects; see delegation (programming) for more. Frequently confused concepts are simply using another object, more precisely referred to as &quot;consultation&quot; or &quot;aggregation&quot;; and evaluating a member on one object by evaluating the corresponding member on another object, notably in the context of the receiving object, which is more precisely referred to as &quot;forwarding&quot; (when a wrapper object doesn&#x27;t pass itself to the wrapped object). The delegation pattern is a software design pattern for implementing delegation, though this term is also used loosely for consultation or forwarding.

==Overview==
This sense of &quot;delegation&quot; as programming language feature making use of the method lookup rules for dispatching so-called self-calls was defined by Lieberman in his 1986 paper &quot;Using Prototypical Objects to Implement Shared Behavior in Object-Oriented Systems&quot;.

Delegation is dependent upon dynamic binding, as it requires that a given method call can invoke different segments of code at runtime. It is used throughout macOS (and its predecessor NeXTStep) as a means of customizing the behavior of program components. It enables implementations such as making use of a single OS-provided class to manage windows, because the class takes a delegate that is program-specific and can override default behavior as needed. For instance, when the user clicks the close box, the window manager sends the delegate a windowShouldClose: call, and the delegate can delay the closing of the window, if there is unsaved data represented by the window&#x27;s contents.

Delegation can be characterized (and distinguished from forwarding) as &quot;late binding of self&quot;:

That is, the in a method definition in the receiving object is &quot;not&quot; statically bound to that object at definition time (such as compile time or when the function is attached to an object), but rather at &quot;evaluation&quot; time, it is bound to the &quot;original&quot; object.

It has been argued that delegation may in some cases be preferred to inheritance to make program code more readable and understandable. Despite explicit delegation being fairly widespread, relatively few major programming languages implement delegation as an alternative model to inheritance. The precise relationship between delegation and inheritance is complicated; some authors consider them equivalent, or one a special case of the other.

==Language support for delegation==
In languages that support delegation via method lookup rules, method dispatching is defined the way it is defined for virtual methods in inheritance: It is always the most specific method that is chosen during method lookup. Hence it is the &quot;original&quot; receiver entity that is the start of method lookup even though it has passed on control to some other object (through a delegation link, not an object reference).

Delegation has the advantage that it can take place at run time and affect only a subset of entities of some type and can even be removed at run time. Inheritance, by contrast, typically targets the type rather than the instances, and is restricted to compile time. On the other hand, inheritance can be statically type-checked, while delegation generally cannot without generics (although a restricted version of delegation can be statically typesafe). Delegation can be termed &quot;run-time inheritance for specific objects.&quot;

Here is a pseudocode example in a C#/Java like language:
class A {
 void foo() {
 // &quot;this&quot; also known under the names &quot;current&quot;, &quot;me&quot; and &quot;self&quot; in other languages
 this.bar();

 void bar() {
 print(&quot;a.bar&quot;);
}

class B {
 private delegate A a; // delegation link

 public B(A a) {
 this.a = a;

 void foo() {
 a.foo(); // call foo() on the a-instance

 void bar() {
 print(&quot;b.bar&quot;);
}

a = new A();
b = new B(a); // establish delegation between two objects
Calling will result in b.bar being printed, since refers to the &quot;original&quot; receiver object, , within the context of . The resulting ambiguity of is referred to as object schizophrenia.

Translating the implicit into an explicit parameter, the call (in , with a delegate) translates to , using the type of for method resolution, but the delegating object for the argument.

Using inheritance, the analogous code (using capital letters to emphasize that resolution is based on classes, not objects) is:
class A {
 void foo() {
 this.bar();

 void bar() {
 print(&quot;A.bar&quot;);
}

class B extends A {
 public B() {}

 void foo() {
 super.foo(); // call foo() of the superclass (A)

 void bar() {
 print(&quot;B.bar&quot;);
}

b = new B();
Calling will result in B.bar. In this case, is unambiguous: there is a single object, , and resolves to the method on the subclass.

Programming languages in general do not support this unusual form of delegation as a language concept, but there are a few exceptions.

===Dual inheritance===
If the language supports both delegation and inheritance one can do dual inheritance by utilizing both mechanisms at the same time as in
class C extends A {
 delegationlink D d;


This calls for additional rules for method lookup, as there are now potentially two methods that can be denoted as the most specific (due to the two lookup paths).

===Related areas===
Delegation can be described as a low level mechanism for sharing code and data between entities. Thus it builds the foundation for other language constructs. Notably role-oriented programming languages have been utilizing delegation, but especially the older ones factually used aggregation while claiming to use delegation. This should not be considered cheating, merely the plural definitions of what delegation means (as described above).

More recently work has also been done on distributing delegation, so e.g. clients of a search engine (finding cheap hotel rooms) can use a shared entity using delegation to share best hits and general re-usable functionality.

Delegation has also been suggested for advice resolution in aspect-oriented programming by Ernst and Lorenz in 2003.

<doc id="604336" wikidata="Q2864740" url="?curid=604336" title="Serindian art">
<text>Serindian art is the art that developed from the 2nd through the 11th century C.E. in Serindia or Xinjiang, the western region of China that was within the cultural sphere of Central Asia during the time.

It derives from the Greco-Buddhist art of the Gandhara district of what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan. Gandharan sculpture combined Indian traditions with Greek influences. 

Modern researchers hypothesize that Buddhist missionaries travelling on the Silk Road introduced this artistic influence, along with Buddhism itself, into Serindia, resulting in a style that is a hybrid of Greek, Chinese and Persian.

In modernity, Serindian art was rediscovered through the expeditions of Sir Aurel Stein in Central Asia at the beginning of the 20th century.

<doc id="604343" wikidata="Q448957" url="?curid=604343" title="Don Bluth">
<text>Donald Virgil Bluth ( ; born September 13, 1937) is an American filmmaker, animator, video game designer and author. He is best known for directing the animated films &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;, &quot;An American Tail&quot;, &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;, &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Anastasia&quot; and &quot;Titan A.E.&quot;, for his involvement in the LaserDisc games &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; and &quot;Space Ace&quot;, and for competing with former employer Walt Disney Productions during the years leading up to the films that became the Disney Renaissance.

==Early life==
Bluth was born on September 13, 1937 in El Paso, Texas, to Emaline (née Pratt) and Virgil Roneal Bluth. His maternal grandfather was Rey Pratt from the Pratt family, whose own father Helaman Pratt was an early leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as well as a grandfather of George W. Romney and great-grandfather of Mitt Romney. He is of Swedish, English, Irish, Scottish, and German descent.

As a child in El Paso, he rode his horse to the town movie theater to watch Disney films. Bluth later said, &quot;then I&#x27;d go home and copy every Disney comic book I could find&quot;. At the age of six, his family moved to Payson, Utah, where he lived on a family farm. Bluth has stated that he and his siblings do not communicate with each other as adults. In 1954, his family moved to Santa Monica, California. Bluth attended Brigham Young University in Utah for one year, and then returned later to complete a degree in English.

== Career ==
=== Early work ===
After leaving university, Bluth was hired in 1955 by Walt Disney Productions as an assistant to John Lounsbery for &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. In 1957, Bluth left Disney, recalling he found the work to be &quot;kind of boring&quot;. For two and a half years, Bluth resided in Argentina on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He returned to the United States where he opened a local theater in Culver City, producing musicals such as &quot;The Music Man&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

Bluth returned to college and earned a degree in English literature from Brigham Young University. In 1964, Bluth illustrated &quot;Affairs of the Harp&quot;, a harp maintenance manual by Samuel O Pratt, with dozens of anthropomorphic cartoon harp characters he called &quot;Harpoons&quot;. In 1967, Bluth returned to the animation industry, and joined Filmation working on layouts for &quot;The Archie Show&quot; and &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;. In 1971, he returned full-time to Disney as an animation trainee. His first project was &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, in which he animated sequences of Robin Hood stealing gold from Prince John, rescuing a rabbit infant, and romancing Maid Marian near a waterfall. For &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too&quot;, he animated Rabbit alongside John Lounsbery. During production on &quot;The Rescuers&quot;, Bluth was promoted to directing animator alongside the remaining members of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men. He then worked as an animation director on &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;. His last involvement with Disney was the short &quot;The Small One&quot;. Meanwhile, he produced his first independent film, &quot;Banjo the Woodpile Cat&quot;.

=== 1981–1985: Departure from Disney and early critical success ===
For &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot;, Bluth animated several scenes of the character Widow Tweed. During production, creative differences between Bluth and studio executives had arisen concerning artistic control and animation training practices. On his 42nd birthday in 1979, Bluth resigned from the studio to establish his own animation studio, Don Bluth Productions, along with Gary Goldman, John Pomeroy, and nine fellow Disney animators. To this end, Don Bluth Productions demonstrated its ability in its first production, a short film titled &quot;Banjo the Woodpile Cat&quot;, and this led to work on an animated segment of the live-action film &quot;Xanadu&quot;. The studio&#x27;s first feature-length film was &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;. Bluth employed 160 animators during the production and agreed to the first profit sharing contract in the animation industry. Though only a moderate success in the box office, the movie received critical acclaim. Later, with the home video release and cable showings, it became a cult classic. Nevertheless, due to the modest gross and an industry-wide animation strike, Don Bluth Productions filed for bankruptcy.

His next film would have been an animated version of the Norwegian folk tale &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot;, but the financial resources were drawn back and it was never made. In 1983, he, Rick Dyer, Goldman, and Pomeroy started the Bluth Group and created the arcade game &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;, an on rails game which let the player choose between simple paths for an animated-cartoon character on screen (whose adventures were played off a LaserDisc). This was followed in 1984 by &quot;Space Ace&quot;, a science-fiction game based on the same technology, but which gave the player a choice of different routes to take through the story. Bluth not only created the animation for &quot;Space Ace&quot;, but he also supplied the voice of the villain, Borf. Work on a &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; sequel was underway when the video arcade business crashed. Bluth&#x27;s studio was left without a source of income and the Bluth Group filed for bankruptcy on March 1, 1985. A sequel called &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair II: Time Warp&quot; was made in 1991, but it was rarely seen in arcades.

An adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was also planned to be directed by Bluth in 1984, but the project was canceled by Columbia Pictures upon discovering that Walt Disney Pictures had plans for their own adaptation. In 1985, Bluth, Pomeroy, and Goldman established, with businessman Morris Sullivan, the Sullivan Bluth Studios. It initially operated from an animation facility in Van Nuys, California, but later moved to Dublin, Ireland, to take advantage of government investment and incentives. Sullivan Bluth Studios also helped boost animation as an industry within Ireland. Bluth and his colleagues taught an animation course at Ballyfermot Senior College.

=== 1986–1995: Affiliation with Steven Spielberg ===
Teaming up with producer Steven Spielberg, Bluth&#x27;s next project was &quot;An American Tail&quot;, which at the time of its release became the highest grossing non-Disney animated film of all time, grossing $45 million in the United States and over $84 million worldwide. The second Spielberg-Bluth collaboration &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; did even better in theaters, and both found a successful life on home video. The main character in &quot;An American Tail&quot; (Fievel Mouskewitz) became the mascot for Amblimation while &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; was followed by thirteen direct-to-video sequels and the animated series (none of which had any involvement from Bluth or Spielberg). Bluth ended his working relationship with Spielberg before his next film, &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; and was not involved with &quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West&quot;, the first film produced by Spielberg&#x27;s new Amblimation studio. Although &quot;All Dogs Go To Heaven&quot; only had moderate theatrical success, it was highly successful in its release to home video. He also directed films, such as &quot;Rock-a-Doodle&quot;, &quot;Thumbelina&quot;, &quot;A Troll in Central Park&quot;, and &quot;The Pebble and the Penguin&quot;, which were all critical and box office failures; however, &quot;Rock-a-Doodle&quot; would find greater success on home video.

=== 1990s–2000: Youth theater and Fox Animation Studios ===
In the 1990s, Bluth began hosting youth theater productions in the living room of his Scottsdale, Arizona, home. As the popularity of these productions grew and adults expressed their wishes to become involved, Bluth formed an adult and youth theatre troupe called Don Bluth Front Row Theatre. The troupe&#x27;s productions were presented in Bluth&#x27;s home until 2012, when their administrative team leased a space off Shea Boulevard in Scottsdale and converted it into a small theater.

Bluth scored a hit in 1997 with &quot;Anastasia&quot;, produced at Fox Animation Studios in Phoenix, Arizona, which grossed nearly US$140 million worldwide. In a positive review of the film, critic Roger Ebert observed that its creators &quot;consciously include[d] the three key ingredients in the big Disney hits: action, romance, and music&quot;. &quot;Anastasia&quot; became Don Bluth&#x27;s most commercially successful film and it established 20th Century Fox as a Disney competitor until 2019, when Disney purchased the company.

Despite the success of &quot;Anastasia&quot;, Bluth resumed his string of box office failures with &quot;Titan A.E.&quot;, which made less than $37 million worldwide in 2000 despite an estimated $75 million budget. In 2000, 20th Century Fox Studios shut down the Fox Animation Studio facility in Phoenix, making &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; the last American-made traditionally animated film released by 20th Century Fox in theaters to be fully animated and not a live-action/animation hybrid until the release of 2007&#x27;s &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. It also stands as Bluth&#x27;s most recent theatrical film as a director.

=== 2002–2011 ===
In 2002, Bluth and video game company Ubisoft developed the video game &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair 3D: Return to the Lair&quot;, an attempt to recreate the feel of the original &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; LaserDisc game in a more interactive, three-dimensional environment. Reviews were mixed, with critics both praising and panning the controls and storyline, but the visuals were noteworthy, using groundbreaking cel-shading techniques that lent the game a hand-animated feel. , Don Bluth and Gary Goldman were seeking funding for a film version of &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;. After apparently sitting in development for over a decade, the project raised over $570,000 via a successful crowdfunding campaign in January 2016. Bluth and Goldman continued to work in video games and were hired to create the in-game cinematics for Namco&#x27;s &quot;I-Ninja&quot;, released in 2003. In October 2004, Polydor Records released the song &quot;Mary&quot;, by the Scissor Sisters, which was accompanied by a music video for which Bluth did the animation.

The following month, Dark Horse Books released Bluth&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Storyboard&quot;. This was followed in May 2005 by the companion book, &quot;The Art of Animation Drawing&quot;. In 2009, Bluth was asked to produce storyboards for, and to direct, the 30-minute Saudi Arabian festival film &quot;Gift of the Hoopoe&quot;. He ultimately had little say in the animation and content of the film and asked that he not be credited as the director or producer. Despite this, he was credited as the director. In 2011, Bluth and his game development company Square One Studios worked with Warner Bros. Digital Distribution to develop a modern reinterpretation of the 1983 arcade classic &quot;Tapper&quot;, titled &quot;Tapper World Tour&quot;.

=== 2015–present: return to animation ===
In October 2015, Bluth and Goldman started a Kickstarter campaign in hopes of resurrecting hand-drawn animation by creating an animated feature-length film of &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;. Bluth plans for the film to provide more backstory for Dirk and Daphne and show that she is not a &quot;blonde airhead&quot;. The Kickstarter funding was canceled when not enough funds had been made close to the deadline, but an Indiegogo page for the project was created in its place. Two months later, Indiegogo campaign reached its goal of $250,000, 14 days after the campaign launched. As of February 2018, the total exceeded $728,000. A live-action &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; film starring Ryan Reynolds was announced to be released in 2020, but it ended up being postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bluth was listed as a producer.

In 2020, Bluth launched a new animation studio called Don Bluth Studios with animator and vice president of the company Lavalle Lee, founder of traditionalanimation.com. His goal is to bring a &quot;renaissance of hand-drawn animation&quot;, in the belief that there is an audience demand for it. His first project is called &quot;Bluth&#x27;s Fables&quot;, an anthology of short stories written, narrated, and drawn by Bluth. The stories are intended to stylistically resemble Aesop&#x27;s Fables and nursery rhymes. The studio&#x27;s productions are live-streamed first, and then uploaded to YouTube. &quot;Bluth&#x27;s Fables&quot; is done with pencil tests and then traced and colored in Clip Studio Paint. Bluth&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Somewhere Out There: My Animated Life&quot;, was released on July 19, 2022. His first children&#x27;s picture book, &quot;Yuki, Star of the Sea&quot; was released on April 1, 2024. It tells the story of a whale who is captured and taken to Hollywood to become a movie star.

== Unproduced projects ==

Throughout Bluth&#x27;s career, there were many projects that ended up unproduced or unfinished due to studio closures, his severed partnership with Steven Spielberg, or the video game crash of 1983. Many art designs, filmed animation tests and videos of these unfinished projects still circulate online.

=== Unproduced films ===
The earliest of Bluth&#x27;s unfinished film projects is a Disney-produced animated short film adaptation of the fairy tale &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot; from the early 1970s. After &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;, Bluth began developing an animated feature film adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. While a few scenes were produced in 1984, the film&#x27;s production was officially cancelled in 1989, when Don Bluth and the film&#x27;s distributor Columbia Pictures heard the news of Disney beginning work on their own animated adaptation. That same time, Bluth began developing an animated adaptation of &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot;. Ultimately, the film was never made due to a loss of financial backing. Following Don Bluth&#x27;s partnership with Steven Spielberg, 1986&#x27;s &quot;An American Tail&quot; was released as Bluth&#x27;s second film instead. During production of &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot;, Bluth also animated a demo reel of &quot;Jawbreaker&quot;, a proposed television series by Phil Mendez of a boy who finds a magical tooth. The series however, was not greenlit.

Two more films were planned during Bluth&#x27;s partnership with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. The first film was an animated adaptation of &quot;The Velveteen Rabbit&quot;, a story about an abandoned toy rabbit in pursuit of its child owner. The second film was &quot;Satyrday&quot;, based on a story by Steven Bauer about a young boy in a fantasy world who defends the moon and sun from evil forces. Some of the film&#x27;s concepts were later realized as the 2014 French animated film &quot;&quot;. After his partnership with Spielberg ended, Bluth began planning another film titled &quot;The Little Blue Whale&quot; with screenwriter Robert Towne. The planned film was about a little girl and her animal friends who try to protect a little whale from evil whalers. Other unrealized projects also included plans for an animated short film centered around a magical talking pencil starring Dom DeLuise, animated film adaptations of the books &quot;Quintaglio Ascension&quot;, &quot;The Belgariad&quot;, and &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. The latter productions were canceled following the box office failure of &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; and subsequent closure of Fox Animation Studios. In 2005, a live-action &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; film was released by Touchstone Pictures.

=== Unproduced games ===
Following the success of &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; in 1983, Don Bluth began plans for seven more arcade games: &quot;The Sea Beast&quot;, &quot;Jason and the Golden Fleece&quot;, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;Haywire&quot;, &quot;Drac&quot;, &quot;Cro Magnon&quot;, and &quot;Sorceress&quot;. Due to the budgeting issues and the 1983 video game crash, these projects were abandoned. The sequel to &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair II: Time Warp&quot;, would be shelved until its eventual release in 1991. Blitz Games planned a video game adaptation of &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; for the PlayStation and PC in fall 2000 in North America, following the film&#x27;s summer release. Development on both platforms had begun in March 1999 under the film&#x27;s original title &quot;Planet Ice&quot;, and an early playable version was showcased at the 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles. In July 2000, a spokesman from the game&#x27;s publisher, Fox Interactive, announced that development on the title had been halted largely due to the film&#x27;s poor box office performance which was &quot;only one of many different factors&quot; that led to its cancellation. A sequel to the 2003 game &quot;I-Ninja&quot; was planned, which had input from Bluth. Work on the sequel started soon after the first game&#x27;s release, but its studio Argonaut Games had some economic problems and eventually closed down in October 2004. The few aspects remaining from &quot;I-Ninja 2&quot; development are some concept drawings. A project called &quot;Pac-Man Adventures&quot; was originally planned in partnership with Namco around 2003 but was scrapped due to financial problems on Namco&#x27;s part leading to their merger with Bandai in 2007 and whatever development assets were left over was made into &quot;Pac-Man World 3&quot; with no involvement from Bluth.

<text>ARD is a joint organisation of Germany&#x27;s regional public-service broadcasters. It was founded in 1950 in West Germany to represent the common interests of the new, decentralised, post-war broadcasting services – in particular the introduction of a joint television network.

The ARD has a budget of €6.9 billion, 22,612 employees and is the largest public broadcaster network in the world. The budget comes primarily from a mandatory licence fee which every household, company and public institution, regardless of television ownership, is required by law to pay. For an ordinary household the fee is €18.36 per month, as of 2023. Households living on welfare are exempt from the fee. The fees are not collected directly by the ARD, but by the Beitragsservice (formerly known as Gebühreneinzugszentrale GEZ), a common organisation by the ARD member broadcasters, the second public TV broadcaster ZDF, and Deutschlandradio.

ARD maintains and operates a national television network, called &quot;Das Erste&quot; (&quot;The First [Channel]&quot;) to differentiate it from ZDF, a.k.a. &quot;das Zweite&quot; (&quot;The Second [Channel]&quot;), which started in 1963, as a separate public TV broadcaster. The ARD network began broadcasting on 31 October 1954 under the name of &quot;Deutsches Fernsehen&quot; (&quot;German Television&quot;), becoming &quot;Erstes Deutsches Fernsehen&quot; (&quot;First German Television&quot;) with a corporate redesign in 1984; it adopted its current short name (&quot;Das Erste&quot;) in 1994. ARD&#x27;s programmes are aired over its own terrestrial broadcast network, as well as via cable, satellite and IPTV.

ARD also produces two free-to-air channels (one and Tagesschau24) and participates in the production of Phoenix (current events, news and documentaries), KiKa (kids-oriented), 3sat (cultural-oriented), arte (Franco-German cultural programming), and Funk (teenage-oriented, online only).

ARD&#x27;s programming is produced by its regional members (see also Institutions and member organizations) (Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR), Hessischer Rundfunk (HR), (MDR), Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), Radio Bremen, Rundfunk Berlin–Brandenburg (RBB), Saarländischer Rundfunk (SR), Südwestrundfunk (SWR) and Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)), which operate 54 regional and local radio stations and seven regional TV networks, some of which have opt-outs at during the day. Deutsche Welle, Germany&#x27;s international broadcaster, is also a member of ARD.

== History ==

=== Name ===
*&#x27;Consortium&#x27; (&quot;Working group&quot;) – of the public-law broadcasting institutions‡ – of the Federal Republic of Germany&#x27;
‡public-law broadcasting institutions means broadcasters which are not privately owned () and are not governmental radio or TV. ARD is not &#x27;owned by&#x27; anybody, particularly not by &quot;Germany&quot; (meaning its government/federal state). ARD members like BR (Bayerischer Rundfunk) are not owned by their &quot;Land&quot; (state and its government, here Bavaria), either. With the &quot;Rundfunkfreiheit&quot; (freedom of broadcasting), they have an independent position (within a legal framework).

===1940s and 1950s===

The winning Allies of World War II determined that German radio after World War II would not broadcast the same propaganda as the pre-war &quot;Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft&quot; (&quot;Reich Broadcasting Company&quot;). A federal structure, the renunciation of state influence and the avoidance of economic dependence were to be the key of the radio and TV institutions under public law (&quot;&quot;, public radio and television organisations). The legal form of the new entity was &quot;Anstalt des öffentlichen Rechts&quot; (&quot;Institution under Public Law&quot;), a non-government and nonprofit organisation with its own administration under the control of two commissions, the &quot;Rundfunkrat&quot; (Broadcasting Council, responsible for the programmed content) and the &quot;Verwaltungsrat&quot; (Administration Council, responsible for management and infrastructure), in which different stakeholders from German public life were represented.

ARD&#x27;s founding members were Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR), the station for the former British zone, Südwestfunk (SWF), the station in the French zone, and four stations located in the former American sector— Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR), Süddeutscher Rundfunk (SDR), Hessischer Rundfunk (HR), and Radio Bremen (RB). The new entity was financed by an obligatory fee that every German household with at least one radio receiver paid. Each station received the money collected in its state. Larger ARD members subsidised smaller ones up to a certain extent.

In 1947, American military governor Lucius D. Clay declared diversity of public opinion as the main aim of post-war media policy. Individuals aligned with the post-war Allied forces in their respective sectors of Germany had a local influence on local regional broadcasters. NDR cites the influence of Hugh Greene on the early years of their organisation.

After the creation of individual broadcasting agencies for most German federal states these principles were further consolidated by &quot;Länder&quot; broadcasting laws, decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court (&quot;Bundesverfassungsgericht&quot;), and state treaties between the &quot;Länder&quot;. ARD members are thus (at least nominally) free of government influence and rely for only a small part of their income on advertising (1995: ten percent). They are financed mainly from licence fees from radio and TV owners, which are set through a complex political process. The mandated aim of the ARD corporations is not only to inform and to entertain but also to encourage the integration of various parts of society and allow minorities a say in programming.

In the 1950s the ARD radio services became the major factor of the mass media system in West Germany. As early as 1952 the ARD radio stations had ten million listeners. However, the radio stations operated on a regional level, and it was only the development of a television umbrella that helped the ARD to establish itself nationwide. The broadcasting of a countrywide TV broadcast service was the goal of the ARD from the outset and the go-ahead for this was given at the end of 1952. The same year ARD was admitted as a fully active member of the European Broadcasting Union and the &quot;German sound archive&quot;, now German Broadcasting Archive (DRA, Deutsches Rundfunkarchiv), was established as a joint facility of the ARD.

In 1955 the founding member &quot;NWDR&quot; (&quot;Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk&quot;, English: &quot;North-West German Broadcasting&quot;) split into today&#x27;s NDR and WDR. The year before (1954) the smaller SFB was split off. The first daily news feature, the &quot;Tagesschau&quot;, went on the air from Hamburg in 1952. The famous 8:00 pm chime and announcement &quot;&quot; (&quot;This is the first German television channel with the Tagesschau&quot;) remains an ARD hallmark today. The broadcast attracts an average of 8 million viewers.

===1960s–1980s===
After starting with a mere two-hour schedule per night, television became more widespread in Germany in the 1960s. Color broadcasts were introduced in 1967. Without competition from private broadcasters (other than the francophone Europe 1 and the multilingual RTL (Radio-Television Luxembourg) radio programs), the ARD stations made considerable progress in becoming modern and respected broadcasters. ZDF (Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen, Second German Television), a second public television broadcaster with a centralized national organization structure, began its programming in 1963, but ARD would encounter no private competition in Germany until 1984. The ARD stations have also been a significant force in German politics; such investigative news magazines as &quot;Monitor&quot; and &quot;Panorama&quot; still reach millions of viewers every week. The environmental movement increased in popularity during the 1980s largely as a result of the disclosures made by ARD.

When private/commercial German-language broadcasters were admitted in Germany by federal law in the mid-1980s, ARD television made subtle changes, adapting somewhat by producing programs oriented to a larger audience for their national networks and shifting many cultural and news programs to the regional networks and to newly created niche channels.

Informational television programs and the orientation of &quot;Deutschlandfunk&quot; (Germany&#x27;s national public radio station, associated with, but not a member of the ARD) programs towards the GDR were of importance to the eventual collapse of the GDR. Established in 1974, the ARD bureau in East Berlin made ARD television the most important source of information for GDR citizens, eighty percent of whom could watch what they referred to as &quot;Westfernsehen&quot;. Notwithstanding obstruction on the part of GDR authorities and the repeated expulsion of their correspondents, the ARD-Tagesschau and Deutschlandfunk transmitted a report about the Leipzig Monday Demonstrations (which started on 4 September 1989) as early as September 1989.

===1990s===
After the unification and the closure of the Deutscher Fernsehfunk, two new regional broadcasters were established in the East, becoming ARD members in 1992. These were originally the (MDR, English: &quot;Central German Broadcasting&quot;), and Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg (ORB, English: &quot;East German Broadcasting Brandenburg&quot;). The existing NDR service expanded into the north-east, where it also covered Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The ORB service has since merged with the former Sender Freies Berlin (SFB, English &quot;Radio Free Berlin&quot;) to become Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB, English: &quot;Berlin-Brandenburg Broadcasting&quot;) in 2003.

Another merger took place between two member organisations of the ARD in 1998. The former Süddeutscher Rundfunk (SDR, English: &quot;Southern German Broadcasting&quot;) and Südwestfunk (SWF, English: &quot;Southwestcast&quot;) became Südwestrundfunk (SWR, English: &quot;Southwest Broadcasting&quot;) on 1 October 1998.

==Programming==

===Radio===
Today, ARD member stations usually produce their radio programming. Some ARD member stations usually collaborate for common radio services (an example is Nordwestradio, a culture-oriented radio station co-produced by Radio Bremen and NDR). Most ARD stations, however, will have at least a news-oriented radio station, a classical music station, a youth-oriented station, and a cultural station. At night some stations will relay common night programming produced on a rota system by the ARD stations themselves. There are four common night programming services: Hitnacht (light music), Nachtkonzert (classical music), Infonacht (all news), and Popnacht (pop music). Most services are on the FM broadcast band, though some services are also available on DAB.

A similar network intended for national coverage is called Deutschlandradio, however, Deutschlandradio is not an ARD member – instead, Deutschlandradio is controlled by both ARD and ZDF. Deutschlandradio provides two terrestrial radio services: Deutschlandfunk (DLF), a news-oriented service, and Deutschlandfunk Kultur, a culture-oriented service. It also provides a science-orientated internet channel: 
Deutschlandfunk Nova.

ARD&#x27;s best-known radio station outside Germany is Deutsche Welle, which broadcasts its radio services around the world in many languages, mostly on analogue shortwave radio, online, and FM partner stations. Deutsche Welle has no FM distribution in Germany.

&quot;Archivradio&quot; is an ARD internet radio station that streams raw audio from German sound archives, mainly the ARD radio archives and the DRA. The program is accompanied by a web portal run by the ARD-member SWR, with background information on the original sounds aired.

===Television===
The main television channels of the ARD are the nationwide Das Erste and seven regional channels operated by the different regional broadcasting institutions. These channels were available on the analogue terrestrial transmitters until the shutdown of the analogue transmitters started in 2003. Das Erste and the third programmes, like the radio stations, are principally funded by licence fees, with a very limited amount of on-air advertising.

Das Erste broadcasts nationwide 24 hours a day. However, the schedule does include four and a half hours of joint programming with ZDF each weekday, in the form of the news programmes &quot;Morgenmagazin&quot; (on air 5.30–9.00) and &quot;Mittagsmagazin&quot; (13.00–14.00), which the two organizations take weekly turns to produce.
Audience share (March 2008):12.5%, from 14 to 49 years 6.9%.

The regional members of ARD all, jointly (NDR/rb and SWR/SR) or separately, operate their own regional channels, known collectively as &quot;die Dritten&quot; (&quot;the Third Programmes&quot;) – before recent rebranding, most of these stations had names like West 3 and Hessen 3. The schedules of these regional channels also include sub-regional opt-outs at certain times, in particular for local news.
*BR Fernsehen from Bayerischer Rundfunk (sub-regional opt-outs: Altbayern und Schwaben (South), Franken (North))
*hr-fernsehen from Hessischer Rundfunk
*MDR Fernsehen from (opt-outs: state programmes for Saxony, Sachsen-Anhalt, Thuringia)
*NDR Fernsehen from Norddeutscher Rundfunk (opt-outs: state programmes for Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and rb.tv from Radio Bremen)
*RBB Fernsehen from Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (opt-outs: separate state programmes)
*SWR Fernsehen from Südwestrundfunk – in collaboration with SR Fernsehen (opt-outs: state programmes for Baden-Württemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and SR Fernsehen from Saarländischer Rundfunk)
*WDR Fernsehen from Westdeutscher Rundfunk. (11 local opt-outs within North Rhine-Westphalia)

ARD has three additional channels as part of their ARD Digital package:
*Tagesschau24 – television news channel
*One – entertainment television channel
*ARD-alpha – educational programming

ARD is also involved in several joint venture channels:
*3sat with ZDF, ORF and SRG: a cultural channel
*KI.KA with ZDF: a children&#x27;s channel
*Arte with ZDF and France Télévisions: a Franco-German cultural channel
*Phoenix with ZDF: a news and documentary channel, focussed on showing press conferences and political debates in the German parliament live, in addition to historical and political features.

The international broadcaster Deutsche Welle also produces television services; however, these services are mostly available via satellite.

=== Podcasts ===
The &quot;Tagesschau&quot;, produced by the ARD on a nightly basis, is available on the ARD website as a podcast (available as audio-only or as audio and video). Other audio programs from the ARD&#x27;s members (e.g., BR, MDR) and Deutsche Welle are available as podcasts, through their respective websites.

== Institutions and member organizations ==

ARD has 30 correspondents&#x27; offices in 26 countries.

ARD operates several other companies and institutions, sometimes jointly with ZDF: Degeto Film, a television rights trader and production company; the German Broadcasting Archive (DRA – Deutsches Rundfunkarchiv); the Institute for Broadcasting Technology (IRT – Institut für Rundfunktechnik), responsible for research and development; the Fee Collection Service (Beitragsservice), and others.

ARD is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative that is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface.

=== Chairs of the ARD ===
== Correspondents ==

=== Europe ===
The radio studio in Strasbourg, which was closed in July 2010 and previously operated by SWR, was responsible for the European Parliament. Since then, reporting has been carried out from Brussels and Paris.

The ARD radio studio in Zurich was closed in August 2021. Since then, reporting has been carried out from Geneva.

=== Americas ===

The ARD radio studio in Buenos Aires was closed in 2022. Since then, reporting has been carried out from Rio de Janeiro.

=== Africa and Middle East ===

The studio for Turkey and Iran (radio) is in Istanbul, see above. The ARD radio studio in Amman was closed in 2013. It only has a branch office in Cairo, from where reporting has been carried out ever since.

== Criticism ==

=== Criticism by political parties ===
Since it was founded in 2013, the German party AfD has accused the German broadcasters of being state-driven propaganda machines. This claim is heavily disputed. For example, a 2019 study from Oxford (p. 24) stated that the majority of the audience of German public broadcasters ARD, ZDF and &quot;Deutschland Radio&quot; are left-winged or left of the center of the political spectrum. The AfD took this to show that the broadcaster is biased and contributing to a left-shift in the political environment. The majority of German newspapers have responded that the AfD have misunderstood the Oxford study, and accused the AfD of spreading fake news. Another point of evidence offered is that ARD board member and Director for Programming Christine Strobl is not only a member of the CDU party herself, but also the daughter of Wolfgang Schäuble, a prominent CDU member of parliament. As Director for Programming she is in a position to stop or initiate the production of programs, but also potentially editorial decisions.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated ARD to be &quot;Independent Public Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

===Neutrality===
After the ARD withdrew material critical of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, a journalist from the magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; compared this behaviour in an opinion article to the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. To get rid of the &quot;annoying image of state radio&quot;, the journalist recommends it would certainly be helpful to keep more distance from the government.

=== Framing manual ===
Claudia Schwartz from the &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot; reported in February 2019 the ARD wanted to impress upon its audience certain moral views. A manual from the &quot;Berkeley International Framing Institute&quot; (see sources below) was used internally in order to make ARD viewers consider their fees less as a compulsory contribution than as a kind of donation to a good cause.

But the website Netzpolitik.org (who published the original document), came to the conclusion that &quot;Many of the proposed frames, which are currently heating the minds of many critics, have never been used in public by the public broadcasters representatives. This also shows that the excitement about the report is too high.&quot;

<doc id="604362" wikidata="Q162872" url="?curid=604362" title="Many-plumed moth">
<text>The Alucitidae or many-plumed moths are a family of moths with unusually modified wings. Both fore- and hind-wings consist of about six rigid spines, from which radiate flexible bristles creating a structure similar to a bird&#x27;s feather.

This is a small family, with about a global total of 210 species described to date (though it is likely that some undescribed species remain to be discovered). They are found mostly in temperate to subtropical (but not tropical) regions.

==Systematics and taxonomy==
The taxonomy of this family is somewhat disputed. Here, they are united in superfamily Alucitoidea with the Tineodidae, a diverse group of numerous small genera with about 20 species all together. However, the two supposed Alucitoidea families may be polyphyletic with regard to each other, and Tineodidae better included in Alucitidae. In any case, the similar-looking plume moths (Pterophoroidea) are widely held to be very close, if not the closest living relatives of the Alucitoidea.

Earlier, many authors assumed that the fruitworm moths (Copromorphoidea) were also very closely related to the Alucitidae (and the fringe-tufted moths, Epermeniidae) – according to some, closer in fact than the Pterophoroidea and even the Tineodidae. In this Alucitoidea do not exist; Alucitidae and Tineodidae are assigned to different (but still most closely related) superfamilies. In the treatment here, the Copromorphoidea are presumed to be the most advanced of these lineages of small but fairly &quot;modern&quot; moths, while the Alucitoidea and Pterophoroidea are more primitive.

==Genera==
The genera presently placed here, sorted alphabetically, are:

* &quot;Alinguata&quot;
* &quot;Alucita&quot;
* &quot;Hebdomactis&quot;
* &quot;Hexeretmis&quot;
* &quot;Microschismus&quot;
* &quot;Paelia&quot;
* &quot;Prymnotomis&quot;
* &quot;Pterotopteryx&quot;
* &quot;Triscaedecia&quot;

<text>The Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan (also known as The Book of Adam and Eve) is a 6th-century Christian extracanonical work found in Ge&#x27;ez, translated from an Old Arabic original which is translated from a Syriac source, namely &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot;.

==Editions and translations==
It was first translated from the Ge&#x27;ez Ethiopic version into German by August Dillmann. It was first translated into English by S. C. Malan from the German of Ernest Trumpp. The first half of Malan&#x27;s translation is included as the &quot;First Book of Adam and Eve&quot; and the &quot;Second Book of Adam and Eve&quot; in &quot;The Lost Books of the Bible and the Forgotten Books of Eden&quot;. The books mentioned below were added by Malan to his English translation; the Ethiopic is divided into sections of varying length, each dealing with a different subject.

==Content==
Books 1 and 2 begin immediately after the expulsion from the Garden of Eden, and end with the testament and translation of Enoch. Great emphasis is placed in Book 1 on Adam&#x27;s sorrow and helplessness in the world outside the garden.

In Book 1, the punished Serpent attempts to kill Adam and Eve, but is prevented by God, who again punishes the Serpent by rendering it mute and casting it to India. Satan also attempts to deceive and kill Adam and Eve several times. In one of his attempts on their life, he throws a boulder which ends up encompassing Adam and Eve. God eventually saves them and compares this event with the upcoming Resurrection of Christ. God also predicts several other future Biblical events, including Noah and the flood.

In Book 2, the &quot;sons of God&quot; who appear in are identified as the children of Seth, and the &quot;daughters of men&quot; as women descended from Cain, who successfully tempt most of the Sethites to come down from their mountain and join the Cainites in the valley below, under the instigation of Genun, son of Lamech. This Genun invents musical instruments, generally attributed to Jubal; however he also invents weapons of war, generally attributed to Tubal-Cain. The Cainites, descended from Cain the first murderer, are described as exceedingly wicked, being prone to commit murder and incest. After seducing the Sethites, their offspring become the Nephilim, the &quot;mighty men&quot; of Gen. 6 who are all destroyed in the deluge, as also detailed in other works such as &quot;1 Enoch&quot; and &quot;Jubilees&quot;.

Books 3 and 4 continue with the lives of Noah, Shem, Melchizedek, etc. through to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in AD 70. The genealogy from Adam to Jesus is given, as in the Gospels, but including also the names of the wives of each of Jesus&#x27; ancestors, which is extremely rare.

==Textual origin==
&quot;The Cave of Treasures&quot; is a Syriac work containing many of the same legends; indeed, as Malan remarks, a whole body of stories expanding upon the Old Testament is found in the Talmud, in the Quran, and in other late antique texts.

== Differences from Genesis ==
* 1st Adam and Eve LXXVIII:16 &quot;Then on the morrow Adam said unto Abel his son, &#x27;Take of thy sheep, young and good, and offer them up unto thy God; and I will speak to thy brother, to make unto his God an offering of corn. By contrast, says: &quot;And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the . And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the had respect unto Abel and to his offering&quot;.
* Book 2 has discrepancies with Old Testament saint lifetimes: 
** Enos lived 985 years (2nd Adam and Eve XIV:4) whereas Genesis says that he lived 905 years ().
** Mahalaleel lived 870 years (2nd Adam and Eve XVI:2) whereas Genesis says that he lived 895 years (). 
** Jared lived 989 years (2nd Adam and Eve XXI:13) whereas Genesis says that he lived 962 years ().

<doc id="604372" wikidata="Q724435" url="?curid=604372" title="A Course in Miracles">
<text>A Course in Miracles (also referred to as ACIM) is a 1976 book by Helen Schucman. The underlying premise is that the greatest &quot;miracle&quot; is the act of simply gaining a full &quot;awareness of love&#x27;s presence&quot; in a person&#x27;s life. Schucman said that the book had been dictated to her, word for word, via a process of &quot;inner dictation&quot; from Jesus Christ. The book is considered to have borrowed from New Age movement writings.

&quot;ACIM&quot; has three sections: &quot;Text&quot;, &quot;Workbook for Students&quot;, and &quot;Manual for Teachers&quot;. Written from 1965 to 1972, some distribution occurred via photocopies before the Foundation for Inner Peace published a hardcover edition in 1976. The copyright and trademarks, which had been held by two foundations, were revoked in 2004 after lengthy litigation because the earliest versions had been circulated without a copyright notice.

Throughout the 1980s, annual sales of the book steadily increased each year; the largest growth in sales occurred in 1992 after Marianne Williamson discussed the book on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, with more than two million volumes sold. The book has been called everything from &quot;New Age psychobabble&quot; to &quot;a Satanic seduction&quot; to &quot;The New Age Bible&quot;. According to Olav Hammer, the psychiatrist and author Gerald G. Jampolsky was among the most effective promoters of &quot;ACIM&quot;. Jampolsky&#x27;s first book, &quot;Love is Letting Go of Fear&quot;, based on the principles of &quot;ACIM&quot;, was published in 1979 and, after being endorsed on Johnny Carson&#x27;s show, sold over three million copies by 1990.

==Origins==
&quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; was written as a collaborative venture between Schucman and William (&quot;Bill&quot;) Thetford. In 1958, Schucman began her professional career at Columbia–Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City as Thetford&#x27;s research associate. In 1965, at a time when their weekly office meetings had become so contentious that they both dreaded them, Thetford suggested to Schucman that &quot;[t]here must be another way&quot;. Schucman believed that this interaction acted as a stimulus, triggering a series of inner experiences that were understood by her as visions, dreams, and heightened imagery, along with an &quot;inner voice&quot; that she identified as Jesus (although the &quot;ACIM&quot; text itself never explicitly claims that the voice she hears speaking is that of Jesus). She said that on October 21, 1965, an &quot;inner voice&quot; told her: &quot;This is a Course in Miracles, please take notes.&quot;

Schucman said the writing made her very uncomfortable, though it never seriously occurred to her to stop. The next day, she explained the events of her &quot;note-taking&quot; to Thetford. To her surprise, Thetford encouraged her to continue the process. He also offered to assist her in typing out her notes as she read them to him. The process continued the next day and repeated regularly for many years. In 1972, the writing of the three main sections of &quot;ACIM&quot; was completed, with some additional minor writing coming after that point.

For copyright purposes, US courts determined that the author of the text was Schucman, not Jesus. Kenneth Wapnick, psychologist, devotee and teacher of the &quot;ACIM&quot;, believed that Schucman did not channel Jesus, but was describing her &quot;own mental experience of divine &#x27;love.

==Reception==
Since it went on sale in 1976, the book has been translated into 27 languages. It is distributed globally, spawning a range of organized groups.

Wapnick said that &quot;if the Bible were considered literally true, then (from a Biblical literalist&#x27;s viewpoint) the Course would have to be viewed as demonically inspired&quot;. He also said, &quot;I often taught in the context of the Bible, even though it is obvious to serious students of &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; that it and the Bible are fundamentally incompatible.&quot; &quot;&quot;Course&quot;-teachers Robert Perry, Greg Mackie, and Allen Watson&quot; disagreed about that. Though a friend of Schucman, Thetford, and Wapnick, Catholic priest Benedict Groeschel criticized &quot;ACIM&quot; and related organizations. Finding some elements of &quot;ACIM&quot; to be &quot;severe and potentially dangerous distortions of Christian theology&quot;, he wrote that it is &quot;a good example of a false revelation&quot; and that it has &quot;become a spiritual menace to many&quot;. The evangelical editor Elliot Miller says that Christian terminology employed in &quot;ACIM&quot; is &quot;thoroughly redefined&quot; to resemble New Age teachings. Other Christian critics say that &quot;ACIM&quot; is &quot;intensely anti-biblical&quot; and incompatible with Christianity, blurring the distinction between creator and created and forcefully supporting an occult and New Age worldview.

Olav Hammer locates &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; in the tradition of channeled works from those of Madam Blavatsky to Rudolf Steiner&#x27;s and notes the close parallels between Christian Science and the teachings of the Course. Hammer called it &quot;gnosticizing beliefs&quot;. In &quot;&#x27;Knowledge is Truth&#x27;: A Course in Miracles as Neo-Gnostic Scripture&quot; in &quot;Gnosis&quot;: &quot;Journal of Gnostic Studies&quot;, Simon J. Joseph outlines the relationship between the Course and Gnostic thinking. Daren Kemp also considers &quot;ACIM&quot; neo-Gnostic and agrees with Hammer that it is a channeled text. The course has been viewed as a way that &quot;integrates a psychological world view with a universal spiritual perspective&quot; and linked to transpersonal psychology.

Joseph declared: 

Another dismissal of ACIM and claim for its subversiveness comes from some on the political left, who note that William Thetford, who encouraged and helped bring Schucman&#x27;s work to press, was a CIA operative and psychologist. In Harper&#x27;s Magazine, Sheila Heti quotes a post asserting the CIA sought &quot;to infiltrate and dilute the American left with New Age ideas and inwardly-focused, anti-rational religious movements&quot;.

&quot;The Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; describes &quot;ACIM&quot; as &quot;a minor industry&quot; that is overly commercialized and characterizes it as &quot;Christianity improved&quot;. Robert T. Carroll wrote that the teachings are not original but culled from &quot;various sources, east, and west&quot;. He adds that it has gained increased popularity as New Age spirituality writer Marianne Williamson promoted a variant.

==Associated works==
Two works have been described as extensions of &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot;, Gary Renard&#x27;s 2003 &quot;The Disappearance of the Universe&quot; and Marianne Williamson&#x27;s &quot;A Return to Love&quot; published in 1992. &quot;The Disappearance of the Universe&quot;, published in 2003 by Fearless Books, was republished by Hay House in 2004. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reported that Renard&#x27;s examination of &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; influenced his book.

<text>American Pool Checkers, also called &quot;American Pool&quot;, is a variant of draughts, mainly played in the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States and in Puerto Rico.

==Basic rules==

As in the related game English draughts (also known as &quot;American checkers&quot; or &quot;straight checkers&quot;), the game is played on an 8x8 board with the double corner (corner without a checker) to each player&#x27;s right. The dark pieces player starts the game by making the first move. One difference from the rules of English checkers is that a piece may capture both forward and backward. A player must capture an opponent&#x27;s checker when possible (both forward and backward), but if two possibilities exist, the player may choose the sequence (even if one sequence has more jumps). The pieces are not removed until all jumps are completed and the player&#x27;s hand is removed from his piece. A player may not capture an opponent more than one time. A player may not capture his own pieces. 

Another difference is that kings are flying kings, which means that a king can jump any number of squares forward and backward. A king can make right turns after a jump and continue along another path after successfully taking an opponent. A king must also make all the possible jumps during a sequence. If the condition arises that one player has three kings and the other has just one king, the player who has the three kings must win within thirteen moves (even if the fourteenth move is a capture).

<text>Samuel Penhallow (July 2, 1665 – December 2, 1726) was a Cornish colonist, historian, and militia leader in present-day Maine during Queen Anne&#x27;s War and Father Rale&#x27;s War. He was the commander at Fort Menaskoux and was attacked during the Northeast Coast Campaign (1724).

==Life==

He was born at St Mabon, Cornwall, England. From 1683 to 1686 he attended a school at Newington Green (near London) conducted by the Rev. Charles Morton (1627–1698), a dissenting clergyman, with whom he emigrated to Massachusetts in 1686. He was commissioned by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England to study the Indian languages and to preach to the Indians; but he was soon diverted from this work. Removing to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, he there married Mary Cutt, a daughter of John Cutt (1625–1681), president of the Province of New Hampshire in 1679, a successful merchant and mill-owner, and thus came into possession of considerable property (including much of the present site of Portsmouth). In 1700 he was speaker of the Assembly and in 1702 became a member of the Provincial Council, but was suspended by Lieutenant-Governor George Vaughan (1676–1724). Penhallow, however, was sustained by Governor Samuel Shute (1662–1742), and Vaughan was removed from office in 1716. In 1714 Penhallow was appointed a justice of the superior court of judicature, and from 1717 until his death was chief justice of that court; and he also served as treasurer of the province in 1699–1726, and as Secretary of the province in 1714–1726. He died at Portsmouth on 2 December 1726.

<text>Vizhnitz is the name of a Hasidic dynasty founded by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Hager. Vizhnitz (ויז׳ניץ or וויזשניץ) is the Yiddish name of Vyzhnytsia, a town in present-day Ukraine (then, a village in Austrian Bukovina).

Followers of the rebbes of Vizhnitz are called &quot;Vizhnitzer Hasidim&quot;.

==History of dynastic leadership==
===Menachem Mendel Hager===
Menachem Mendel Hager was born on May 17, 1830, in Kosiv, now in Western Ukraine. He was the son of Rabbi Chaim Hager of Kosiv, the grandson of Menachem Mendel Hager of Kosov, his namesake, and the son-in-law of Rabbi Israel Friedman of Ruzhyn. He was appointed Rebbe at the age of 24, and soon after, he moved to Vyzhnytsia, a small town close to Kosiv. As his reputation grew, so did his followers. He became known and admired for his charitable acts, sincerity in prayer, and love for Eretz Yisrael. In his older years, he endeavored to emigrate there. He had two sons, Reb Boruch and another, Reb Yaakov Dovid, who died during his lifetime. His son-in-law was the son of Rabbi Yehoshua Rokeach of Belz, Reb Shmuel of Sokal. His Torah thoughts were published under the title &quot;Tzemach Tzaddik&quot;. He died on October 18, 1884, and was buried in Vyzhnytsia. His son Reb Boruch took his place, becoming the second Rebbe of Vizhnitz.

===Boruch Hager===
Boruch Hager was born in 1845 and was named after Rabbi Boruch of Medzhybizh at the behest of his grandfather, Yisroel Friedman of Ruzhyn. In 1885, aged 40, he inherited the mantle of leadership from his father, Menachem Mendel Hager, and became rebbe to thousands of Hasidim. He led them for only eight years until his death in 1892. His Torah thoughts were collected in &quot;Imrei Boruch&quot; by his son-in-law. Eight of his sons became rebbes in different locals: His eldest, Reb Yisroel, succeeded him in Vyzhnytsia; Reb Chaim became rebbe in Ottynia; Reb Moshe in Suceava; Reb Shmuel Avrohom Abba in Horodenka; Reb Yaakov Yitzchok Dovid in Storozhynets; Reb Pinchos in Borsha; Reb Feivish in Zelishtshik; Reb Yechiel Michel succeeded his brother in Horodenka. Another son, Reb Sholom, died in his youth. His sons-in-law were Reb Shmuel Dov Chodorov of Petriva; Reb Mordechai Chodorov of Kolomea, who published &quot;Imrey Boruch&quot;; Reb Sholom Yosef Friedman of Sadigur-Chernovitz.

===Yisroel Hager===

Yisroel Hager was born on August 20, 1860. He was the first-born son of Rabbi Boruch Hager. He married the daughter of Rabbi Meir Horowitz of Dzhikov. In 1875, he moved to his father-in-law&#x27;s house and studied at great length with his brother-in-law Rabbi Yehoshua of Dzikov. Three years later he returned to Vyzhnytsia and became very close to his grandfather, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Hager. In 1893 he was appointed as rebbe in Vyzhnytsia. The young rebbe invigorated the dynasty and attracted many more followers from the surrounding provinces. He established many Talmud Torahs, and also a yeshiva, to which he appointed his son Rabbi Menachem Mendel as rosh yeshiva. When World War I broke out he was forced to move to Grosswardein (Oradea). He lived there until his death on 2 June 1936. In 1949, his remains were transferred to Israel and re-interred in Zichron Meir, Bnei Brak.

Hager had 5 sons and six daughters. Four of his sons became Rebbes:
*Reb Menachem Mendel of Visheve
*Reb Chaim Meir (Chayim Meir&#x27;l), who inherited his father&#x27;s position in Grosswardein
*Reb Eliezer of Vyzhnytsia, author of &quot;Demesek Eliezer&quot;
*Reb Boruch of Siret, founder of the Seret-Vizhnitz Hasidic dynasty

===Chaim Meir Hager===

After the Holocaust, Reb Chaim Meir settled in Bnei Brak, Israel, to build a community there. Disciples from pre-war Europe gathered around him, and formed a comprehensive net of educational and communal institutions. He became a spiritual mentor of the Agudas Yisrael party in the Israeli Knesset. Agudas Yisrael won substantial government aid for Bnei Brak and affiliated communities, in return for its support in coalition governments.

Reb Chaim Meir had two sons: the older Moshe Yehoshua (Reb Moshelle), and the younger Mordechai (Reb Mottele).

Reb Chaim Meir&#x27;s sons-in-law include Rabbis Yidele Horowitz, Yitzchok Yaakov Weiss (both were married to Reb Chaim Meir&#x27;s daughter, Miriam), Moshe Ernster and Yisrael Friedman (married to Reb Chaim Meir&#x27;s daughter, Tziporah. Their son is Hoshea Friedman).

===Moshe Yehoshua Hager===
Rabbi Moshe Yehoshua Hager, was the Vizhnitser Rebbe in Bnei Brak. He died on March 13, 2012, aged 95. He had two sons and four daughters. His elder son is Rabbi Yisroel, named after his grandfather, the &quot;Ahavas Yisroel&quot;; his other son is Rabbi Menachem Mendel, named after the founding Vizhnitzer Rebbe, author of &quot;Tzemach Tzaddik&quot;. Rabbi Moshe Yehoshua&#x27;s sons-in-law are famous rabbis. The eldest daughter married Rabbi David Twersky, the Skverer Rebbe of New Square, New York. One daughter married Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, the Belzer Rebbe from Jerusalem. One daughter married Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum, the Satmar Rebbe from Kiryas Joel, New York. The youngest daughter married Rabbi Menachem Ernster, the rosh yeshiva of the Vizhnitz Yeshiva in Bnei Brak.

===Mordechai Hager===
Rabbi Mordechai Hager, born in 1922, was the Vizhnitzer Rebbe in Monsey until his death in 2018. Following the death of his father Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager of Bnei Brak, Israel, thousands of Vizhnitz hasidim followed him. When he died he was the oldest hasidic rabbi in the world. He was known for his devotion to learning Torah: he studied 18 hours a day and asked his Chasidim to study at least two hours every day. He had about 3,000 to 5,000 followers internationally.

Rabbi Mordechai died on March 16, 2018 (29 Adar 5778), at Mount Sinai Hospital. The funeral was held with the attendance of 100,000 mourners. He was buried in the Vishnitzer Cemetery in Monsey, New York. 
Rabbi Mordechai bore 14 children, 8 sons and 6 daughters. His sons and grandson serve as leaders of his followers in the United States and internationally: Rabbi Yisroel in Monsey, New York; Rabbi Mendel in Kiamesha Lake, New York; and Rabbi Yitzchok Yochonon in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The other sons serve internationally: Rabbi Eliezer in Jerusalem, Israel or in Lakewood; Rabbi Dovid in London; Rabbi Aharon in Canada headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, his youngest son, Rabbi Buroch Shamshon, in Beit Shemesh, Israel; and his grandson Rabbi Yakov Yosef, son of eldest son Rabbi Pinchus Shulem, in Boro Park, Brooklyn.

<doc id="604382" wikidata="Q1753881" url="?curid=604382" title="X/Open">
<text>X/Open group (also known as the Open Group for Unix Systems and incorporated in 1987 as X/Open Company, Ltd.) was a consortium founded by several European UNIX systems manufacturers in 1984 to identify and promote open standards in the field of information technology. More specifically, the original aim was to define a single specification for operating systems derived from UNIX, to increase the interoperability of applications and reduce the cost of porting software. Its original members were Bull, ICL, Siemens, Olivetti, and Nixdorf—a group sometimes referred to as BISON. Philips and Ericsson joined in 1985, at which point the name X/Open was adopted.

The group published its specifications as X/Open Portability Guide, starting with Issue 1 in 1985, and later as &quot;X/Open CAE Specification&quot;.

In 1987, X/Open was incorporated as X/Open Company, Ltd.

By March 1988, X/Open grew to 13 members: AT&amp;T, Digital, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, Unisys, NCR, Olivetti, Bull, Ericsson, Nixdorf, Philips, ICL, and Siemens.

By 1990 the group had expanded to 21 members: in addition to the original five, Philips and Nokia from Europe; AT&amp;T, Digital, Unisys, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, NCR, Sun, Prime Computer, Apollo Computer from North America; Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC from Japan; plus the Open Software Foundation and Unix International.

In October 1993, a planned transfer of UNIX trademark from Novell to X/Open was announced; it was finalized in 2nd quarter of 1994.

In 1994, X/Open published the Single UNIX Specification, which was drawn from XPG4 Base and other sources.

In 1996, X/Open merged with the Open Software Foundation to form The Open Group.

X/Open was also responsible for the XA protocol for heterogeneous distributed transaction processing, which was released in 1991.

== X/Open Portability Guide ==
X/Open published its specifications under the name X/Open Portability Guide (or XPG). Based on the AT&amp;T System V Interface Definition, the guide has a wider scope than POSIX, which is only concerned with direct operating system interfaces. The guide specifies a &quot;Common Application Environment&quot; (CAE) intended to allow portability of applications across operating systems. The primary aim was compatibility between different vendors&#x27; implementations of UNIX, though some vendors also implemented the standards on non-UNIX platforms.

Issue 1 of the guide covered basic operating system interfaces, the C language, COBOL, indexed sequential file access method (ISAM) and other parts and was published in 1985. Issue 2 followed in 1987, and extended the coverage to include Internationalization, Terminal Interfaces, Inter-Process Communication, and the programming languages C, COBOL, FORTRAN, and Pascal, as well as data access interfaces for SQL and ISAM. In many cases these were profiles of existing international standards. Issue 3 (XPG3) followed in 1989, its primary focus being convergence with the POSIX operating system specifications; it added Window Manager, ADA Language and more. Issue 4 (XPG4) was published in July 1992. The Single UNIX Specification was based on the XPG4 standard. The XPG3 and XPG4 standards define all aspects of the operating system, programming languages and protocols which compliant systems should have.

Multiple levels of compliance and corresponding labels were available, depending on the scope of the guide that was covered: Base and Plus; labels Component and Application are for SW components and applications that make use of the portability guide.

Issue 1 was published as a single publication with multiple parts, .

Issue 2 was published in multiple volumes:
* X/Open Portability Guide Volume 1: System V Specification Commands and Utilities, 1987, 
* X/Open Portability Guide Volume 2: System V Specification System Calls and Libraries, 1987, 
* X/Open Portability Guide Volume 3: System V Specification Supplementary Definitions, 1987, 
* X/Open Portability Guide Volume 4: Programming Languages, 1987, 
* X/Open Portability Guide Volume 5: Data Management, 1987, 

Issue 3 was published in multiple volumes:
* X/Open Portability Guide Volume 1: XSI Commands and Utilities, 1989, 
* X/Open Portability Guide Volume 2: XSI System Interface and Headers, 1989, 
* X/Open Portability Guide Volume 3: XSI Supplementary Definitions, 1989, 
* X/Open Portability Guide Volume 4: Programming Languages, 1988, 
* X/Open Portability Guide Volume 5: Data Management, 1988, 
* X/Open Portability Guide Volume 6: Window Management, 1988, 
* X/Open Portability Guide Volume 7: Networking Services, 1988, 

The XPG4 Base specification includes the following documents:
* System Interfaces and Headers (XSH), Issue 4, 1992, , C202
* Commands and Utilities (XCU), Issue 4, 1992, , C203
* System Interface Definitions (XBD), Issue 4, 1992, , C204
The above three documents were published not under the label &quot;X/Open Portability Guide&quot; but rather as &quot;CAE Specification&quot;.
Nonetheless, the term &quot;X/Open Portability Guide, Issue 4&quot; sees some use in reference to 1992 year of publication.

Further X/Open publications under the label &quot;X/Open CAE Specification&quot; rather than &quot;X/Open Portability Guide&quot;:
* Distributed Transaction Processing: The XA Specification, December 1991, 
* Systems Management: Management Protocol Profiles (XMPP), October 1993, 
* X/Open DCE: Remote Procedure Call, August 1994, 
* System Interface Definitions, Issue 4, Version 2, September 1994, 
* System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 4, Version 2, September 1994, 
* Commands and Utilities, Issue 4, Version 2, September 1994, 
* Networking Services, Issue 4, September 1994, 
* Data Management:SQL Call Level Interface (CLI), March 1995,

<text>Richard Benjamin Ferrell (October 12, 1905 – July 27, 1995) was an American professional baseball player, coach, scout, and executive. He played for 18 seasons as a catcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1929 through 1947 for the St. Louis Browns, Boston Red Sox, and Washington Senators. His brother, Wes Ferrell, was a major league pitcher for 15 seasons, and they were teammates from 1933 through part of 1938 on the Red Sox and Senators. Following his three seasons in minor league baseball, he appealed to the Commissioner of Baseball to become a free agent, claiming that he was being held in the minors though he deserved promotion. The Commissioner agreed, and he was granted free agency; he signed with the St. Louis Browns.

Ferrell was regarded as one of the best catchers in baseball during the 1930s and early 1940s. While playing for the Red Sox in 1933, he and his brother Wes were selected to play for the American League (AL) team in the inaugural 1933 Major League Baseball All-Star Game held on July 6, 1933. His 1,806 games played as a catcher set an AL longevity record which stood for more than 40 years. A seven-time All-Star, Ferrell was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984 by the Veterans Committee. After his playing career, he became a coach with the Senators, and later a scout and general manager with the Detroit Tigers. He died in July 1995 at the age of 89.

==Early life==
Ferrell was born on October 12, 1905, in Durham, North Carolina, to Rufus and Alice, and grew up on a 160-acre dairy farm near Greensboro, North Carolina. He was one of seven boys, and two of his brothers enjoyed long careers in baseball. Wes Ferrell reached the major leagues as a pitcher while another brother, George Ferrell, played as an outfielder in minor league baseball. Rick attended Guilford College in Greensboro where he played both baseball and basketball.

In 1926, he was signed by the Detroit Tigers of the American League (AL), and was assigned to play for the Kinston Eagles of the Virginia League. Shortly afterward, he was promoted to the Columbus Senators of the American Association, and in 1928 he posted a .333 batting average with them. His performance that season earned him an American Association All-Star position.

During the season, he personally asked Detroit&#x27;s owner, Frank Navin, if the organization had a plan in place to bring him up to the Tigers. Navin told him to be patient and return to Columbus. When the season concluded, another Columbus catcher, Hugh McMullen, was called up to the major leagues, but to the Cincinnati Reds instead of the Tigers. Confused as to who actually owned his contract, Ferrell inquired with the Reds about his status with the organization, and was again told to return to Columbus. After reading through his contract, he believed he was being unfairly held in the minor leagues, so he petitioned the Commissioner of Baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, to grant him a hearing. It was discovered that Columbus owner, Joseph Carr, had been shopping Ferrell&#x27;s contract, receiving offers as high as $50,000 (), though none were formally presented on paper. Navin protested to Landis, claiming he was unaware of what Carr was doing.

After the Commissioner completed his investigation, he determined that the Tigers and Reds had colluded to keep Ferrell in the minor leagues, and directed Carr to shop for buyers. This move by the two teams effectively hid him from the other major league teams&#x27; draft rights to increase Ferrell&#x27;s sale price. This was a common, although illegal, practice during this era, so Landis declared Ferrell a free agent, allowing him to sign a contract with any team he chose, except the Tigers. After receiving offers from many major league clubs, he signed a contract with the St. Louis Browns of the AL for $25,000 ().

==Major leagues==
Ferrell made his major league debut with the Browns at the age of 23 on April 19, 1929. He spent the 1929 season as a reserve catcher backing up veteran Wally Schang, and had a .229 batting average in 64 games. New Browns manager and former catcher, Bill Killefer, made Ferrell his starting catcher for the next three seasons, and he would catch in more than 100 games in each. His batting average rose to .306 in 1931, elevating him one to one of the best catchers in the American League. Although he led the league&#x27;s catchers in errors and passed balls, he also led the league in assists. In 1932, Ferrell hit .315, the best among American League catchers, with 30 doubles and 65 runs batted in. He ended the season ranked 13th in voting for the 1932 American League Most Valuable Player Award.
On May 10, 1933, the financially strained Browns traded Ferrell, along with Lloyd Brown to the Boston Red Sox, in exchange for Merv Shea and some cash. Two months later, Ferrell was selected along with his brother to play for the American League team in the inaugural Major League Baseball All-Star Game held on July 6, 1933. American League manager Connie Mack used Ferrell to catch the entire game in a 4–2 American League victory, even though future Baseball Hall of Fame catcher Bill Dickey was also on the team. When the Red Sox played the Cleveland Indians two weeks later on July 19, 1933, Ferrell hit a home run against his brother Wes, who later hit a home run off Boston pitcher Hank Johnson, marking the first time in major league history that brothers on opposing teams had hit home runs in the same game. Ferrell ended the year with a .290 batting average along with a career-high 77 runs batted in. Although Ferrell once again led American League catchers in errors, he also led in assists and in baserunners caught stealing. Despite the Red Sox&#x27; seventh-place finish, Ferrell ranked 12th in voting for the 1933 American League Most Valuable Player Award.

In 1934, the Red Sox signed Ferrell&#x27;s brother Wes, forming a formidable battery for the next seasons. Rick ended the year with a .297 batting average and led the league&#x27;s catchers in fielding percentage and in putouts and finished second in assists. With Ferrell calling the pitches in 1935, his brother pitched to a 25–14 won–loss record, and was runner-up to Hank Greenberg in voting for the 1935 American League Most Valuable Player Award. Ferrell posted a .301 batting average for the year and led the league in baserunners caught stealing.

Ferrell had another good year in 1936, leading the league with a .439 batting average at the beginning of May to earn the starting catcher&#x27;s berth for the American League team in the 1936 All-Star Game. He ended the season with a .312 batting average along with career-highs in home runs (8) and in on-base percentage (.406). He also led the league&#x27;s catchers in putouts and finished second in fielding percentage. In June 1937, Ferrell was hitting for a .308 batting average when he was traded to the Washington Senators along with his brother and Mel Almada for pitcher Bobo Newsom and outfielder Ben Chapman. Between 1933 and 1936, Ferrell broke Red Sox catchers&#x27; records in batting average, doubles, home runs and runs batted in. His .302 batting average with Boston is currently 15th on the club&#x27;s all-time list.
Playing with a broken right hand, he ended the year with the Senators and batted .244 over the course of the season. Ferrell rebounded in 1938 with a .298 batting average and led the league in baserunners caught stealing. The Senators released his brother Wes in August 1938. In May 1941, Ferrell was traded back to the St. Louis Browns, in exchange for Vern Kennedy, and went on to catch 100 games for the sixth-place Browns. In 1942, the 36-year-old Ferrell shared catching duties with Frankie Hayes as the Browns improved to an 82–69 won-loss record to finish the year in third place.

Ferrell was once again traded; this time he returned to the Senators in March 1944. He earned a reputation as one of the best knuckleball catchers in baseball when he had the arduous task of catching for a Senators&#x27; starting pitching staff made up entirely of knuckleball pitchers. Dutch Leonard, Johnny Niggeling, Roger Wolff, and Mickey Haefner all threw the notoriously difficult-to-catch knuckleball, making Ferrell the first catcher in major league history to accomplish the feat. Although Ferrell led the league in passed balls due to the unpredictability of the knuckleball, he was still named to his seventh All-Star Game. The Senators ended the season in last place while Ferrell&#x27;s former team, the St. Louis Browns won the 1944 American League pennant.

Ferrell shared catching duties with Al Evans in 1945 as the Senators started to win regularly. On July 6, 1945, Ferrell broke Ray Schalk&#x27;s American League record for most games caught with 1,721. The 1945 All-Star Game which was supposed to be played on July 10 was cancelled on April 24 due to wartime travel restrictions, and no All-Stars were officially named that season. In place of the All-Star Game, seven out of eight scheduled interleague games were played on July 9 and 10 that raised funds for the American Red Cross and War Relief Fund. In the final week of the 1945 season, the Senators came within games of winning the American League pennant, ultimately clinched by the Detroit Tigers. Ferrell retired as a player to become a Senators&#x27; coach for the 1946 season. However, he returned to play as a catcher for 37 games in 1947, hitting for a .303 batting average. He played his final major league game on September 14, 1947 at the age of 41.

==Post-playing career and legacy==

In an 18-year career, Ferrell played in 1,884 games, accumulating 1,692 hits in 6,028 at bats for a .281 career batting average along with 28 home runs, 734 runs batted in and an impressive on-base percentage of .378. He hit over .300 four times during his career, and his on-base percentage is eighth all-time among the 50 catchers with 3,000 at bats. A patient hitter, Ferrell logged just 277 strikeouts during his career, along with 931 bases on balls. He ended his career with a .984 fielding percentage. An eight-time All-Star with a strong throwing arm, he led American League catchers four times in baserunners caught stealing, and twice in assists and putouts. Ferrell retired having caught 1,806 games, an American League record that stood until Carlton Fisk surpassed it in 1988. He currently ranks 12th all-time in games played as a catcher.

Ferrell continued as a coach for the Senators in 1948 and 1949. He then joined the Detroit Tigers as a coach from 1950 to 1954 before retiring from the field altogether. Afterwards, he served as a scout then as the scouting director for the Tigers before becoming the general manager and vice president in 1959. He held the position for four years, with veteran executive Bill DeWitt taking the leading role in baseball operations from late through the season as club president, before turning the general manager role over to Jim Campbell at the close of the campaign. Ferrell remained with the team as a senior member of its front office. During his tenure as a Tigers executive, the team won two World Series championships, in 1968 and in 1984, and won two American League Eastern Division titles in 1972 and in 1987.

In his 1985 book, &quot;The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, baseball historian Bill James ranked Ferrell as the third best catcher in the American League during his career, behind only Mickey Cochrane and Bill Dickey. Ferrell was elected by the Veterans Committee, along with Pee Wee Reese, to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984. He retired in at the age of 87 after 42 years with the Tigers organization.

Ferrell was married to Ruth Virginia Wilson from 1941 until her death in 1968. Together they had four children, two sons and two daughters. His family first lived in Greensboro, then later in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. He lived in Troy, Michigan, for the remaining 18 years of his life, until he was admitted into a nursing home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. It was here that he died of arrhythmia on July 27, 1995, and is interred at New Garden Cemetery in Greensboro, North Carolina.

<text>John Ker (8 August 1673 – 8 July 1726), born John Crawford in Crawfurdland, Ayrshire, was a Scots Presbyterian linked with Cameronian radicals who between 1705 and 1709 acted as a government informer against the Jacobites. Dogged by financial issues most of his life, he died in King&#x27;s Bench Prison in 1726.

==Life==
Ker was born on 8 August 1673, eldest son of Alexander Crawfurd of Fergushill who appears as a Commissioner of Supply in the 1685 records of the Parliament of Scotland.

He married Anna, younger daughter of Robert Ker, of Kersland, near Kilbirnie, whose only son Daniel Ker was killed at the Battle of Steinkeerke in 1692. Anna&#x27;s elder sister Jean Ker sold him the family estates in 1697 and thereafter he assumed the name and arms of Ker.

==Career==
The 1690s were a time of extreme economic hardship and famine in Scotland, known as the seven ill years; in December 1696, the city of Edinburgh set up a refugee camp in Greyfriars kirkyard to house starving rural migrants. This impacted the viability of small estates such as Fergushill and John was already under financial pressure when he purchased Kersland.

Having become a leader among the extreme Covenanters, he made use of his influence to relieve his pecuniary embarrassments, selling his support at one time to the Jacobites, at another to the government, and whenever possible to both parties at the same time. He held a licence from the government in 1707 permitting him to associate with those whose disloyalty was known or suspected, proving that he was at that date the government&#x27;s paid spy. In his &quot;Memoirs&quot; Ker asserts that he had a number of other spies and agents working under his orders in different parts of the country. He entered into correspondence with Catholic priests and Jacobite conspirators, whose schemes, so far as he could make himself cognisant of them, he betrayed to the government. But he was known to be a man of the worst character, and it is improbable that he succeeded in gaining the confidence of people of any importance. The Duchess of Gordon was for a time, it is true, one of his correspondents, but in 1707 she had discovered him to be a knave. He went to London in 1709, where he seems to have extracted considerable sums of money from politicians of both parties by promising or threatening, as the case might be, to expose Godolphin&#x27;s relations with the Jacobites.

In 1713, if his own story is to be believed, business of a semi-diplomatic nature took Ker to Vienna, where, although he failed in the principal object of his errand, the Emperor made him a present of his portrait set in jewels. Ker also occupied his time in Vienna, he says, by gathering information which he forwarded to the electress Sophia; and in the following year on his way home he stopped at Hanover to give some advice to the future King of Great Britain as to the best way to govern the English. Although in his own opinion Ker materially assisted in placing George I on the British throne, his services were unrewarded, owing, he would have us believe, to the incorruptibility of his character. Similar ingratitude was the recompense for his revelations of the Jacobite intentions in 1715, and as he was no more successful in making money out of the British East India Company, nor in certain commercial schemes which engaged his ingenuity during the next few years, he died in a debtor&#x27;s prison.

While in the King&#x27;s Bench Prison he sold to Edmund Curll the bookseller, a fellow-prisoner who was serving a sentence of five months for publishing obscene books, the manuscript of (or possibly only the materials on which were based) the &quot;Memoirs of John Ker of Kersland,&quot; which Curll published in 1726 in three parts, the last of which appeared after Ker&#x27;s death. For issuing the first part of the &quot;Memoirs&quot;, which purported to make disclosures damaging to the government, but which Curll in self-justification described as vindicating the memory of Queen Anne, the publisher was sentenced to the pillory at Charing Cross; and he added to the third part of the &quot;Memoirs&quot; the indictment on which he had been convicted.

<text>&quot;You Love Us&quot; is a song by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was initially released as a single on 7 May 1991 by Heavenly. The song was re-recorded and released on 20 January 1992 by Columbia Records as the third single from the band&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;You Love Us&quot; was originally released as a single on 7 May 1991 by record label Heavenly. This version of the song begins with a sample of Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima&quot; and ends with a coda which includes a drum sample from Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;Lust for Life&quot;.

B-side &quot;Spectators of Suicide&quot; includes a vocal sample of a speech by Black Panther Bobby Seale, a shorter clip of which had previously appeared on the last track of McCarthy&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;The Enraged Will Inherit the Earth&quot;.

You Love Us was also re-recorded and released again on 20 January 1992 as the third single from &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot;. The new version also featured no hook, but had a much heavier rock sound and the &quot;Lust for Life&quot; coda was replaced, on the album version of the track, by an extended guitar solo. This version of the song reached number 16 in the UK charts on 1 February 1992. It was the most successful single released from the album. It also made an appearance as track number six on the 2002 greatest hits compilation, &quot;Forever Delayed&quot;.

The CD single included the B-sides &quot;A Vision of Dead Desire&quot;, &quot;We Her Majesty&#x27;s Prisoners&quot; and a live cover of Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot;. The 12&quot; featured &quot;A Vision of Dead Desire&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot; and the 7&quot; and cassette just &quot;A Vision of Dead Desire&quot;.

== Content and style ==
David Owens proclaimed the track a &quot;firebrand punk classic&quot;. By &quot;Clash Music&quot;, &quot;You Love Us&quot; has been illustrated as an example of &quot;glam metal glory&quot;.

== Live performances ==

The song was performed live with missing guitarist and lyricist Richey James Edwards just five weeks before he vanished, which was the last time Edwards was seen on stage. The band as a foursome played the song as set-closer for their sell-out final gig at the London Astoria.

== Legacy ==
&quot;You Love Us&quot; is widely regarded as one of the band&#x27;s best songs. In 2011, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the song number six on their list of the 10 greatest Manic Street Preachers songs, and in 2022, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the song number five on their list of the 30 greatest Manic Street Preachers songs.

In December 2015, Cardiff brewers Crafty Devil named a beer after the song.

<text>Robert Pershing Doerr (April 7, 1918 – November 13, 2017) was an American professional baseball second baseman and coach. He played his entire 14-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career for the Boston Red Sox (1937–1951). A nine-time MLB All-Star, Doerr batted over .300 three times, drove in more than 100 runs six times, and set Red Sox team records in several statistical categories despite missing one season due to military service during World War II. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986.

After he retired as a player, Doerr served as a scout and a coach; he worked with Carl Yastrzemski before his Triple Crown season. From April 25, 2017, until his death on November 13 of that year, Doerr was the oldest living former major league player. He was the last living person who played in the major leagues in the 1930s, and was the oldest of only three living people who made their MLB debut before U.S. involvement in World War II (the other two being Chuck Stevens and Fred Caligiuri).

==Early life==
Doerr was the son of Harold Doerr, a telephone company supervisor, and his wife, the former Frances Herrnberger; his middle name was a tribute to General of the Armies John J. Pershing, then the commander of U.S. military forces in World War I.

He graduated from Los Angeles&#x27; Fremont High School in 1936, and by then, had already begun his professional career with the 1934 and 1935 Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League (PCL).

While playing for the San Diego Padres of the PCL in 1936, Doerr met Ted Williams. The future Red Sox teammates became close friends for many years. Doerr played in 175 games for San Diego that year, batting .342. He led the league with 238 hits, including 37 doubles and 12 triples.

==MLB playing career==
===Early career===
Doerr broke into the majors in 1937 at the age of 19 and went 3-for-5 in his first game. In 1938, he became a regular in the Red Sox lineup. Doerr led the league with 22 sacrifice hits in 1938. In 1939, Doerr began a string of 12 consecutive seasons with 10 or more home runs and 73 or more runs batted in (RBIs); in 1940 the Red Sox became the 12th team in major league history to have four players with 100 RBIs, with Foxx, Williams, Cronin and Doerr each collecting at least 105.

===All-Star seasons and the World Series===
In 1941, Doerr was an All-Star, the first of nine times he was selected for the AL All-Star team. In 1944, Doerr led the league in slugging percentage. The same year, his .325 batting average was good enough to allow him to finish second in the league, two percentage points behind Lou Boudreau of the Cleveland Indians. &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named him Most Valuable Player for the American League (AL), although he finished only seventh in Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award voting for the AL. Doerr hit for the cycle twice in his career; on May 17, 1944, in a 12–8 loss to the St. Louis Browns in the second game of a doubleheader, and again on May 13, 1947, in a 19–6 win over the Chicago White Sox.

Doerr missed the 1945 season while serving in the Army during World War II, being stationed at Camp Roberts, California. In 1946, Doerr finished third in MVP voting for the AL (won by Williams, his teammate). Doerr drove in 116 runs despite a .271 average. He hit .409 in the 1946 World Series loss to the St. Louis Cardinals, with a home run and three RBIs. Doerr&#x27;s average dropped to .258 in 1947 as he grounded into a league-high 25 double plays, but he had 95 RBIs. He hit .285 with 27 home runs and 111 RBIs in 1948. Doerr had set an AL record in that year by handling 414 chances in a row over 73 games without an error.

===Final years as a player===
In 1949, Doerr hit .309 with 18 home runs and 109 RBIs. At the start of the 1950 season, Doerr was in a slump; he was only batting .232 as of June 2. However, he finished the year with a league-leading 11 triples, and batted .294. On June 8 of that year, he hit three home runs in a 29–4 romp over the Browns. He set career highs that year in triples, runs (103) and RBIs (120); he tied his career high in home runs (27). Doerr appeared in only 106 games in 1951 and he retired that September after suffering from a spinal problem for two years.

===Career totals===

Doerr retired with 8,028 plate appearances, 1,094 runs, 89 triples, 809 walks, 1,349 singles, 1,184 runs created, 693 extra base hits, 2,862 times on base, 115 sacrifice hits and nine All-Star Game selections. At Fenway Park, he hit .315 with 145 home runs, compared to a .261 average and 78 HR on the road. Doerr batted over .300 three times, with six seasons of at least 100 RBIs. He never played a game at a position other than second base.

Regarded as one of the top defensive second basemen of his era, Doerr led AL second basemen in double plays five times, tying a league record, in putouts and fielding percentage four times each, and in assists three times. Doerr held the major league record for career double plays at second base (1,507) until 1963.

He set Red Sox records for career games (1,865), at bats (7,093), hits (2,042), doubles (381), total bases (3,270) and RBIs (1,247), All of Doerr&#x27;s offensive Red Sox records were later broken by Williams, who referred to Doerr as &quot;the silent captain of the Red Sox.&quot; His 223 home runs were then the third most by a major league second baseman.

==Later MLB career==
After spending a few years as a cattle rancher in Oregon, Doerr returned to baseball. He became a scout for the Red Sox from 1957 to 1966, also serving as a minor league hitting instructor for the team for the last six seasons of that span. He was hired as the first base coach for the Red Sox in 1967 under new manager Dick Williams. The Red Sox won their first pennant in 20 years and played in the 1967 World Series.
Doerr resigned from the Red Sox when Williams was fired as manager in September 1969. He was the hitting coach for the expansion Toronto Blue Jays from 1977 to 1981.

==Later life==

Doerr lived in Oregon from the late 1930s till his death, residing in the vicinity of Agness for much of his career before relocating to Junction City in the 1950s. Doerr was married to Monica Terpin from October 1938 until her death in 2003; she had lived with multiple sclerosis since the 1940s. They had one son.

He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986. His jersey number 1 was retired by the Red Sox on May 21, 1988. He made annual trips to the Hall of Fame induction at Cooperstown, New York until 2008, after which he stopped attending. On July 29, 2007, the Hall of Fame honored Doerr after the induction of Cal Ripken Jr. and Tony Gwynn. Reflecting on being inducted into the Hall of Fame and having his number retired by the Red Sox, Doerr said, &quot;If I had played on a world champion, that would have made my life complete.&quot;

On August 2, 2007, the Red Sox held &quot;Bobby Doerr Day&quot; at Fenway Park where he rode along the warning track in a car, threw out the first pitch, and gave a speech. Doerr had what was characterized as a minor stroke on August 11, 2011. He attended the Fenway Park 100th anniversary celebration on April 20, 2012.

Alongside teammates Ted Williams, Dom DiMaggio, and Johnny Pesky, Doerr was honored with &quot;The Teammates&quot; statue outside Fenway Park. It was unveiled in 2010.

===Longevity and records===

Upon the death of former New York Yankees executive and American League president Lee MacPhail in November 2012, Doerr became the oldest living member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. He became the oldest living former Red Sox player upon the death of Lou Lucier in October 2014. On November 4, 2016, Doerr became the oldest living former major leaguer upon the death of Eddie Carnett.

Doerr was the last surviving member of the 1946 Boston Red Sox team that won the AL pennant and lost the World Series in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals. He was also the last living person who played in the major leagues during the 1930s, and the last living person who played against Lou Gehrig.

<doc id="604396" wikidata="Q1121076" url="?curid=604396" title="Jewish Culture Festival in Kraków">
<text>The Jewish Culture Festival in Kraków (, ) is an annual cultural event organized since 1988 in the once Jewish district of Kazimierz (part of Kraków) by the Jewish Culture Festival Society headed by Janusz Makuch, a self-described &quot;&quot; (&quot;crazy person&quot;), fascinated with all things Jewish. The main goal of the festival is to educate people about Jewish culture, history, and faith (Judaism), which flourished in Poland before the Holocaust, as well as to familiarize them with modern Jewish culture, developing mostly in the United States and Israel, and finally, to provide entertainment.

Each festival is held in late June or early July and takes nine days, from Saturday to Sunday. During that time concerts, exhibitions, plays, lectures, workshops, tours, etc. are organized. The two most important concerts are: the inaugural concert on the first Sunday, and the final concert on the last Saturday of the festival. The former usually takes place in one of seven synagogues of Kazimierz and features cantoral music; the latter is always held outdoors, in Ulica Szeroka, the main street of the Jewish part of Kazimierz, and features klezmer music. In between, there are many more concerts, usually with some variations of klezmer music.

The workshops provide an occasion to learn about traditional Jewish cuisine, dance, music, calligraphy and other aspects of Jewish culture. More about Jewish culture, as well as about topics related to the Holocaust, is taught at numerous lectures. Exhibitions of Jewish art, particularly paper-cut, are also organized. The program of the festival also includes tours of the synagogues and cemeteries of Kazimierz as well as the former Nazi-era Kraków Ghetto in the nearby district of Podgórze. During the festival Gentiles are also invited to watch or participate in Jewish prayers at the synagogue.

Jewish Culture Festival brings together artists of Jewish culture from all over the world – music bands, soloists, choirs, jazz musicians, and dance teachers. The festival promotes a whole variety of different styles of Jewish music: synagogue song, hasidic, classical, Jewish folk and – very popular in Krakow nowadays – klezmer. For the Poles this event is a way of promotion of Jewish culture and paying a homage to the community that used to live in Poland, although many Jews were reportedly offended by the commercialization of Polish Jewish culture. &quot;Others argue that there is something deeper taking place in Poland as the country heals from the double wounds of Nazi and Communist domination.&quot;

It is one of Poland&#x27;s major annual cultural events and one of the biggest festivals of Jewish culture in the world. Artists and entertainers usually associated with the festival include: Benzion Miller, Yaakov Stark, David Krakauer, Frank London, Leopold Kozłowski, Michael Alpert, Theodore Bikel, Paul Brody, and many others. Jewish dances are led by Steven Weintraub.

<text>Devdas (, transliterated as &quot;Dēbôdās&quot;) is a Bengali romance novel written by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. The story pivots a tragic triangle linking Devdas, an archetypal lover in viraha (separation); Paro, his forbidden childhood love; and Chandramukhi, a reformed courtesan (tawaif). Devdas has been adapted on screen 20 times for film and 5 times for single song.

The character of Parvati was based on a real life second wife of zamindar Bhuvan Mohan Chowdhury, It was said that the writer had even visited that village. According to sources, the original village was called Hatipota.

==Plot==
Devdas is a young man from a wealthy Bengali family in the British Raj in the early 1900s. Parvati (Paro) is a young woman from a middle-class Bengali Brahmin family. The two families live in a village called Taalshonapur in Bengal, and Devdas and Parvati are childhood friends.

Devdas goes away for a couple of years to live and study in Calcutta (now Kolkata). During vacations, he returns to his village. Suddenly, both realise that their easy comfort in each other&#x27;s innocent comradeship has changed to something deeper. Devdas sees that Parvati is no longer the small girl he knew. Parvati looks forward to their childhood love blossoming into a happy lifelong journey in marriage. According to prevailing social custom, Parvati&#x27;s parents would have to approach Devdas&#x27;s parents and propose marriage of Parvati to Devdas as Parvati longs for.

Parvati&#x27;s mother approaches Devdas&#x27;s mother, Harimati, with a marriage proposal. Although Devdas&#x27;s mother loves Parvati very much, she isn&#x27;t so keen on forming an alliance with the family next door. Besides, Parvati&#x27;s family has a long-standing tradition of accepting dowry from the groom&#x27;s family for marriage rather than sending dowry with the bride. The alternative family tradition of Parvati&#x27;s family influences Devdas&#x27;s mother&#x27;s decision not to consider Parvati as Devdas&#x27; bride, especially as Parvati belongs to a trading (&quot;becha-kena chottoghor&quot;) lower family. The &quot;trading&quot; label is applied in context of the marriage custom followed by Parvati&#x27;s family. Devdas&#x27;s father, Narayan Mukherjee, who also loves Parvati, does not want Devdas to get married so early in life and isn&#x27;t keen on the alliance. Parvati&#x27;s father, Nilkantha Chakravarti, feeling insulted at the rejection, finds an even richer husband for Parvati.

When Parvati learns of her planned marriage, she stealthily meets Devdas at night, desperately believing that he will accept her hand in marriage. Devdas has never previously considered Parvati as his would-be wife. Surprised by Parvati&#x27;s boldly visiting him alone at night, he also feels pained for her. Making up his mind, he tells his father he wants to marry Parvati. Devdas&#x27;s father disagrees.

In a confused state, Devdas flees to Calcutta. From there, he writes a letter to Parvati, saying that they should simply continue only as friends. Within days, however, he realises that he should have been bolder. He goes back to his village and tells Parvati that he is ready to do anything needed to save their love.

By now, Parvati&#x27;s marriage plans are in an advanced stage. She refuses to go back to Devdas and chides him for his cowardice and vacillation. She, however, requests Devdas to come and see her before he dies. He vows to do so.

Devdas goes back to Calcutta and Parvati is married off to the widower, Bhuvan Choudhuri, who has three children. An elderly gentleman and zamindar of Hatipota he had found his house and home so empty and lustreless after his wife&#x27;s death, that he decided to marry again. After marrying Parvati, he spent most of his day in Pujas and looking after the zamindari.

In Calcutta, Devdas&#x27;s carousing friend, Chunni Lal, introduces him to a tawaif (courtesan) named Chandramukhi. Devdas takes to heavy drinking at the courtesan&#x27;s place; she falls in love with him, and looks after him. His health deteriorates through excessive drinking and despair – a drawn-out form of suicide. In his mind, he frequently compares Parvati and Chandramukhi. Strangely he feels betrayed by Parvati, though it was she who had loved him first, and confessed her love for him. Chandramukhi knows and tells him how things had really happened. This makes Devdas, when sober, hate and loathe her very presence. He drinks more and more to forget his plight. Chandramukhi sees it all happen, suffering silently. She senses the real man behind the fallen, aimless Devdas he has become, and can&#x27;t help but love him.

Knowing death approaches him fast, Devdas goes to Hatipota to meet Parvati to fulfill his vow. He dies at her doorstep on a dark, cold night. On hearing of his death, Parvati runs towards the door, but her family members prevent her from stepping out of the house.

The novella powerfully depicts the customs of society that prevailed in Bengal in the early 1900s, which largely prevented a happy ending to a true and tender love story.

==Film, TV, and theatrical adaptations==
The novel has been made into films in many South Asian languages languages, including Bengali, Hindustani, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Urdu, Assamese and Malayalam. It is the most filmed non-epic story in India.

Notable film versions of the novella include:

* In Guru Dutt&#x27;s critically acclaimed film &quot;Kaagaz Ke Phool&quot; (1959), a sub plot involves Dutt directing a film titled &quot;Devdas&quot; with Waheeda Rehman playing Paro.
* In &quot;Haath Ki Safai (1974)&quot;, a song in the movie is about the play &quot;Devdas&quot; with Randhir Kapoor as Devdas and Hema Malini as Chandramukhi.
* In the Tamil remake of the song, Kamal Haasan plays Devdas and Sripriya plays Chandramukhi.
* A sequel of the 1953 Telugu version of &quot;Devdasu&quot; was released in year 1978, titled &quot;Devadasu Malli Puttadu&quot;.
* In the 2006 Kannada blockbuster &quot;Mungaru Male&quot;, a rabbit who is protagonist&#x27;s pet is named after Devdas. 
* In the 2012 Hindi film &quot;Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum&quot;, a dream sequence has Tusshar Kapoor as Devdas, Neha Sharma as Paro and Sarah Jane Dias as Chandramukhi.

<doc id="604413" wikidata="Q287232" url="?curid=604413" title="Antipassive voice">
<text>The antipassive voice (abbreviated or ) is a type of grammatical voice that either does not include the object or includes the object in an oblique case. This construction is similar to the passive voice, in that it decreases the verb&#x27;s valency by one – the passive by deleting the agent and &quot;promoting&quot; the object to become the subject of the passive construction, the antipassive by deleting the object and &quot;promoting&quot; the agent to become the subject of the antipassive construction.

==Occurrence==
The antipassive voice is found in Basque, in Mayan, Salishan, Northeast Caucasian, Austronesian, and Australian languages, and also in some Amazonian languages (e.g. Cavineña, Kanamarí).

Antipassive voice predominantly occurs in ergative languages where the deletion of an object &quot;promotes&quot; the subject from ergative case to absolutive case. In certain accusative languages that have verbal agreement with both subject and object, the antipassive is usually formed by deletion of the object affix. Examples of accusative languages with this type of antipassive are Maasai, Comanche and Cahuilla. A number of direct–inverse languages also have the antipassive voice. Somewhat less conventionally, markers that reduce a verb&#x27;s transitivity by syntactically eliminating objects or demoting them to oblique arguments in accusative languages such as Swedish, Russian or some Turkic languages have recently been described by many linguists as antipassive as well. 

The antipassive voice is very rare in active–stative languages generally and in nominative–accusative languages that have only one-place or no verbal agreement. There are a few exceptions to this trend, such as Krongo and the Songhay language Koyraboro Senni, both of which rely on dedicated antipassive markers that are rare in the more typical type of language with an antipassive.

==Examples==
===Kʼicheʼ===
In the Mayan language Kʼicheʼ, the core arguments of a clause are unmarked for case, and are cross-referenced by person markers on the verb. Person marking follows an ergative–absolutive pattern. Non-core participants are expressed by prepositional phrases.

In the following transitive clause, the object &quot;your mother&quot; is the absolutive argument. It is unmarked for case and is not overtly cross-referenced, since the absolutive third person singular prefix is zero. The agent &quot;you&quot; is represented by the ergative second person singular prefix &quot;a-&quot;.

In the corresponding antipassive clause, which is formally intransitive, the verb takes the antipassive suffix &quot;-on&quot;. The original object &quot;your mother&quot; is now expressed by a prepositional phrase, while the agent &quot;you&quot; has become the subject argument and is thus expressed by the absolutive second person singular prefix &quot;at-&quot;.
=== Basque ===
Basque has an antipassive voice which puts the agent into the absolutive case but does not delete the absolutive object. This leads to the agent and object being in the same case.
when transformed using the antipassive voice, becomes:

==Function==

Antipassives often have functions that are analogous to those of passives in nominative-accusative languages, albeit &#x27;in reverse&#x27;:

* They may show that the agent is more relevant than the patient, i.e. that the patient is less relevant, e.g. because it is indefinite or generic, or the construction can be a way of omitting the patient altogether (which may otherwise even be ungrammatical in certain ergative languages). For example, antipassives may be used in sentences that translate to &#x27;The dog bites (people in general)&#x27; or &#x27;The dog bit &quot;a&quot; man&#x27;. This can be compared with the use of the passive in nominative-accusative languages such as English to deemphasise or omit the &quot;agent&quot;: &#x27;The man was bitten (by a dog)&#x27; or &#x27;The man is often bitten&#x27;.
* They may show that the focus is on something else than the actual result of the action. For example, the focus may be on the agent&#x27;s general propensity to perform the action, as in &#x27;John makes great cakes&#x27;. Alternatively, the patient may be only incompletely affected, as in &#x27;John is pulling at the chair&#x27;, as opposed to &#x27;John is pulling the chair&#x27;.
* They may be a way of avoiding atypical mapping between the relative or absolute animacy level of an argument and its syntactic function. Specifically, they may prevent the casting of a highly animate argument as an object in the absolutive case and/or of a low-animacy argument as a subject in the ergative case. For example, a sentence translating to &#x27;The falling lamp hit John&#x27; may be paraphrased as something akin to &#x27;The falling lamp hit at John&#x27;. This can be compared with the English use of the passive in &#x27;John was hit by the falling lamp&#x27;.

A further purpose of antipassive construction is often to make certain arguments available as pivots for relativization, coordination of sentences, or similar constructions. For example, in Dyirbal the omitted argument in conjoined sentences must be in absolutive case. Thus, the following sentence is ungrammatical:

In the conjoined sentence, the omitted argument (the man) would have to be in ergative case, being the agent of a transitive verb (to see). This is not allowed in Dyirbal. In order to make this sentence grammatical, the antipassive, which promotes the original ergative to absolutive and puts the former absolutive (the woman) into dative case has to be used:

In addition, antipassives frequently convey aspectual, modal and temporal information. They are preferred in imperfective, inceptive, potential, purposive and non-past-tense clauses and may hence signal that the clause belongs to these types. This is connected to the antipassives&#x27; general focus on the agent, which makes them frequent in clauses where the agent is in control of the action or the action depends on the proneness of the agent to perform it.

==Defining &quot;antipassive&quot;==

The term &quot;antipassive&quot; is applied to a wide range of grammatical structures and is therefore difficult to define. R. M. W. Dixon has nonetheless proposed four criteria for determining whether a construction is an antipassive:
# It applies to clauses containing traditionally transitive predicates and forms a derived intransitive.
# The agent takes the subject role.
# The object takes a peripheral role in the clause, getting marked by a non-core case/preposition/etc. This can be omitted, but there&#x27;s always the option of including it.
# There is some explicit marking of the construction.

While the first, second and fourth criterion are widely accepted, Dixon&#x27;s formulation of the third criterion is controversial, in that many linguists consider as antipassives also constructions that give &quot;no&quot; option of including the object.

==Historical origin==

The antipassive construction is often signalled by the same markers as the reflexive and reciprocal constructions, the unifying feature being a reduction in transitivity. Indeed, it is more common for languages to have a coincidence of the antipassive marker with other markers than to have a specialised antipassive marker. In this connection, it has also been argued that even nominative-accusative languages such as Swedish and Russian can be said to have antipassives (Swedish &quot;hunden bit-s&quot; &#x27;the dog bites (in general, unspecified patient)&#x27;, Russian &quot;sobaka kusaet-sja&quot; (with the same meaning)); both have markers originating from a reflexive pronoun, and a similar origin of antipassives is attested in Pama-Nyungan, Kartvelian, Chukotko-Kamchatkan and Turkic languages.

Other attested origins are from benefactive/malefactive constructions and indefinite/generic object markers. For some languages, origin from the secondary verbalization of action nouns or participles has been posited: in Rgyalrong languages, where the antipassive prefixes appear to derive from denominal derivations, the development being &quot;transitive verb &gt; derived action noun &gt; new derived intransitive verb&quot;, and a similar process is claimed to have taken place in Western Mande languages, where the intransitive verb was formed by adding the verb &#x27;to do&#x27; (&#x27;to buy&#x27; &gt; &#x27;a purchase&#x27; &gt; &#x27;to do a purchase&#x27;). Origin from combinations of deverbal nominalizations or participles and verbalizing postbases has also been claimed for West Greenlandic (passive participle + &#x27;make, become&#x27;, deverbal nominalization + &#x27;get&#x27; and deverbal nominalization + &#x27;provide with&#x27; for the markers &quot;-(s)i-&quot;, &quot;-nnig-&quot; and &quot;-ller-&quot; respectively). For Godoberi, it has been argued that rather than the antipassive having the secondary function of signalling atelic aspect, it has itself arisen as a side-effect of an atelic aspect marker.

<text>Robert Reynolds Jones Sr. (October 30, 1883 – January 16, 1968) was an American evangelist, pioneer religious broadcaster, and the founder and first president of Bob Jones University. 

==Early years==
Bob Davis Reynolds Jones was the eleventh of twelve children born to William Alexander and Georgia Creel Jones. In 1883, when Bob was born, Alex Jones, a Confederate veteran, was working a small farm in Dale County, Alabama, but within months the family moved to Brannon Stand west of Dothan. All the unmarried Jones children helped work the farm there, and Bob Jones often sold the family vegetables door-to-door in Dothan. Jones later recalled, &quot;We may have been a little undernourished, but we built some character.&quot;

Jones&#x27;s elementary schooling was limited by modern standards, but the boy early exhibited a quick mind and oratorical ability. Alex Jones had Bob memorize passages from the Bible and from literature, and Bob, who was &quot;timid and self-conscious,&quot; was regularly called on to perform for guests. Jones later recalled, &quot;I did whatever my father said to do, but when he told me to &#x27;say the speech,&#x27; I suffered agony that nobody could possibly know.&quot;

Jones must have quickly overcome his stage fright, however, for by 1895, as a twelve-year-old, he gave a spirited, twenty-minute defense of the Populist Party while standing on a dry-goods box in front of a Dothan drug store. His gifts were recognized by Dr. Charles Jefferson Hammitt (1858–1935), a Methodist missionary from Philadelphia and former president of Mallalieu Seminary (1882–1923), a Methodist secondary school in Kinsey. Jones boarded with the Hammitts and helped pay his board by serving the household, even taking orders from the Hammitt children. Jones graduated from Mallalieu in 1900, and the following year he entered Southern College (later Birmingham-Southern College) at Greensboro, Alabama, supporting himself with his preaching. He attended until 1904 but by then was already so prominent as an evangelist that he left without taking a degree, in part to help support two widowed sisters.

By the time Jones was 17, both his father and mother were dead. In 1905, Jones married Bernice Sheffield, who contracted tuberculosis and died within ten months of their marriage. On June 17, 1908, he married Mary Gaston Stollenwerck, whom he had met as a choir member during a meeting he was conducting in Uniontown, Alabama. Their only child, Bob Jones Jr., was born October 19, 1911, in Montgomery, where they made their home. Mary Gaston Jones died on May 12, 1989, in her 101st year—83 years after the death of her husband&#x27;s first wife.

==Evangelistic career==
Jones&#x27;s family was devoutly Christian—his mother a Primitive Baptist and his father an &quot;immersed&quot; Methodist. The family attended a nearby Methodist church where Bob Jones was converted at age 11. But as a portent of Jones&#x27;s later non-denominationalism, he too was baptized by immersion before joining the Methodists.
At age 12, Jones was made Sunday School superintendent, and he held his first revival meeting at his home church—seeing sixty conversions in a single week. At thirteen, he built a &quot;brush arbor&quot; shelter and organized his own congregation of 54 members. By age 15, Jones was a licensed circuit preacher for the Alabama Methodist Conference. A year later, he was called to the Headland Circuit of five churches, including the one he had started, and he was earning $25 a month (worth $ today) for his labors. Jones later wondered that &quot;the devil did not trap me...I was pulled here and there and from house to house. People flocked to hear me preach. The buildings could not hold the crowds; people even stood outside and stuck their heads in the windows to listen. It&#x27;s a wonder it did not spoil me.&quot;

American evangelistic meetings received more newspaper publicity at the turn of the twentieth century than before or since and were often boosted by the town fathers out of civic pride. Bob Jones meetings were frequently front-page news for weeks in the cities where he held meetings. By the 1920s, Jones was probably the best-known evangelist in the United States except for Billy Sunday. His campaign results were remarkable even for the era. For instance, in a seven-week campaign in Zanesville, Ohio (1917), a town of 22,000, there were 3,384 converts, of whom 2,200 joined churches on Easter Sunday. In 1921, Muskingum College, a Presbyterian school, became the first of several institutions to confer honorary doctorates on Jones.

By the time he was 40, Jones had preached to more than fifteen million people face-to-face and without amplification, and he was credited with tens of thousands of conversions. (Unlike Billy Sunday, Jones was reluctant to keep tabulated records of his results.) Crowds might be as large as 15,000 at a time, virtually necessitating the sustained volume, hyperbolic language, and extravagant gestures that became stereotypical characteristics of period evangelists. (In Zanesville, a reporter noted that Jones &quot;pounded the altar so hard he broke it.&quot;)

==Bob Jones University==
During the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy of the 1920s, Jones grew increasingly concerned with the secularization of higher education. Children of church members were attending college, only to reject the faith of their parents. Jones later recalled that in 1924, his friend William Jennings Bryan had leaned over to him at a Bible conference service in Winona Lake, Indiana, and said, &quot;If schools and colleges do not quit teaching evolution as a fact, we are going to become a nation of atheists.&quot;

In the fall of 1925—shortly after the Scopes Trial—Jones and his wife were driving in south Florida talking about the need for an orthodox Christian college as an alternative to what he perceived to be loss of both state and denominational colleges to secularism. After stopping for some sandwiches, Jones announced, &quot;just as a clap of thunder out of a clear sky,&quot; that he was going to found such a school. His wife&#x27;s first response was, &quot;Robert, are you crazy?&quot; Jones immediately turned the car north and began consulting with friends in Alabama and north Florida about a location.

On April 14, 1926, a charter was approved by the circuit court in Panama City, Florida, and Jones promoted real estate sales to raise money for the college. On December 1, 1926, ground was broken on St. Andrews Bay near Lynn Haven, Florida, and the college opened on September 12, 1927, with 88 students. Jones said that although he was averse to naming the school after himself his friends overcame his reluctance &quot;with the argument that the school would be called by that name because of my connection with it, and to attempt to give it any other name would confuse the people.&quot;

Bob Jones took no salary from the college, and in fact, for years afterward, he helped support the school through personal savings and income from his evangelistic campaigns. Both time and place were inauspicious. The Florida land boom had peaked in 1925, and a hurricane in September 1926 further reduced land values. The Great Depression followed hard on its heels. Bob Jones College barely survived bankruptcy and its move to Cleveland, Tennessee, in 1933. Nevertheless, the reputation of both the school and its founder continued to grow, and with the enactment of GI Bill at the end of World War II, the college was virtually forced to seek a new location and build a new campus. In 1947, the school moved to Greenville, South Carolina, where it was renamed Bob Jones University.

By that time, oversight of day-to-day operations had long since passed to his son, Bob Jones Jr. Nevertheless, the elder Jones continued to raise money, preach regularly at chapel services, and provide inspiration to the hundreds of ministerial students who flooded the campus during the 1950s and revered him as &quot;Doctor Bob.&quot; Gradually, during the early &#x27;60s, he began to suffer &quot;hardening of the arteries,&quot; resigned as chairman of the board in 1964, and was forced to retire to the University infirmary in 1966. Despite mental confusion, his prayers were said to have remained bell-clear virtually to the end.

==Radio broadcasts==
New mass entertainment, such as radio and movies, helped put an end to an era of citywide evangelism typified by the ministries of Bob Jones and Billy Sunday. But Jones was not afraid of technological progress per se and believed that the new media might provide additional opportunities to spread the gospel. During the early 1920s Jones was one of the first religious figures to broadcast on radio. The 1925 Bob Jones evangelistic meetings in Pittsburgh were perhaps the first remote-controlled religious broadcasts in the world, as well as the first broadcasts to originate from an evangelistic crusade. (In the same year, Jones also made a religious film, which because of its graphic—for the era—portrayal of certain sins, was slashed into an &quot;unrecognizable mess&quot; by the Pennsylvania State Censorship Board.)

In 1927, the year that network radio was launched in the United States, Jones began both a daily and weekly network program heard from New York to Alabama; and despite his other responsibilities, he maintained an uninterrupted radio ministry for 35 years until his health failed in 1962. In 1944, Jones became a founder of National Religious Broadcasters and served as a director.

Jones understood that the manner of delivery necessary to declaim to thousands unamplified was unsuited to the new medium, and his radio sermons were instead delivered in an intimate, folksy manner. Perhaps three thousand of his approximately ten thousand radio messages survive, and recordings are still nationally syndicated.

==Religious views==

Theologically, Jones was a Protestant in the Reformation tradition. One of his first concerns when he founded Bob Jones College was to provide a creed that would embody the fundamentals of the Christian faith. The Bob Jones University creed (composed by journalist and prohibitionist Sam Small) was an abbreviated statement of traditional orthodoxy, emphasizing those aspects of the faith that were under attack during the early twentieth century. Therefore, the BJC creed affirmed the inspiration of the Bible and rejected the theory of human evolution as necessary tenets of Christian belief.

Perhaps because of the tension between his mother’s Primitive Baptist views and his own long-standing membership in the Methodist Church, Jones sought to split the difference between Calvinism and Arminianism. He urged his hearers to believe that “whatever the Bible says is so,” even if its words did not fit a particular theological system. 
Although Jones believed that man was depraved by nature and that salvation was through Christ and by grace alone, his early revival sermons stressed opposition to social sins such as drinking, dancing, and Sabbath desecration and the possibility that they might be ameliorated by legislation as well as by individual repentance.

Jones&#x27;s view of academic learning was also practical; he advocated Christian higher education yet insisted that faith could not rest on human argument. Jones was skeptical of both the intellectual emphasis of the Reformed tradition and the pietism of the &quot;deeper life&quot; movement. He could quote Goethe and Cicero without affectation, but he urged his students to make “truth simple and easy to grasp”—to put “the fodder on the ground” and give “all the animals from a giraffe to a billy-goat” an equal chance to understand the gospel.

In the 1950s, Jones played an important, if unwelcome, role in the division of orthodox Protestantism into fundamentalism and neo-evangelicalism. The severance, which had already been bruited about in some conservative seminaries, became actual with the rise to prominence of evangelist Billy Graham. Graham had briefly attended Bob Jones College, and the University had conferred an honorary degree on him in 1948. In the 1940s Jones and Graham seemed to have developed something of a father-son relationship. During the 1950s, however, Graham began distancing himself from the older fundamentalism, and in 1957, he sought broad ecumenical sponsorship for his New York Crusade. Jones argued that because members of Graham’s campaign executive committee had rejected major tenets of orthodox Christianity, such as the virgin birth and the deity of Christ, Graham had therefore violated 2 John 9-11, which prohibits receiving in fellowship those who do “not abide in the teaching of Christ.” Members of Graham’s organization accused Jones of jealousy because Graham was now attracting larger crowds than any who had ever heard Jones. Jones wrote that he was an old man who did not want to “get into a battle” but that he would not go “back on the Lord Jesus Christ.” The notoriety of the Graham-Jones split marked a more-or-less permanent division among Bible-believers into smaller fundamentalist and larger evangelical factions.

==Political and social views==
Jones enjoyed politics, was the friend of many politicians, and had been encouraged to run for office a number of times. During the 1928 presidential election, Jones campaigned throughout the South for Republican Herbert Hoover against Democrat Al Smith. Smith, he claimed, would be unduly influenced by the Pope, who Jones said was to Catholics &quot;the voice of God.&quot; Jones said he &quot;would rather see a saloon on every corner than a Catholic in the White House.&quot; Jones&#x27;s support for Hoover, though quixotic in 1928, was perhaps the earliest harbinger of the demise of the Solid South.

In the late 1920s, Jones, like Billy Sunday (who was an Iowan), accepted contributions for his evangelistic campaigns from the Ku Klux Klan. Jones also supported members of the Klan, notably his friend, Alabama Governor Bibb Graves, for political office. Although Jones rejected lawlessness and lynching, he sympathized with the Klan&#x27;s professed endorsement of religious orthodoxy, Prohibition, and opposition to the teaching of evolution as fact. Racial segregation per se was hardly an issue among whites in 1920s Alabama because at the time both supporters and a majority of white opponents of the Klan were segregationists.

Nevertheless, Jones remained a segregationist into the era of the Civil Rights Movement, when he was in his 70s. There are few references to race in Jones&#x27;s sermons and chapel messages until the late 1950s, but in a 1960 radio address, Jones declared that God had been the author of segregation and that opposition to segregation was opposition to God. Jones&#x27;s health began to fail before the integration of neighboring Furman University in 1965, and he did not live to see the abandonment of segregation, six years later, at Bob Jones University.

<text>Hugh Duffy (November 26, 1866 – October 19, 1954) was an American outfielder and manager in Major League Baseball. He was a player or player-manager for the Chicago White Stockings, Chicago Pirates, Boston Reds, Boston Beaneaters, Milwaukee Brewers and Philadelphia Phillies between 1888 and 1906. He had his best years with the Beaneaters, including the 1894 season, when he set the National League single-season record for batting average (.440), a record that has stood for over a century.

He also managed the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox and spent several seasons coaching in collegiate baseball and in the minor leagues. Later in life, he spent many years as a scout for the Red Sox. In 1945, Duffy was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. He worked for Boston until 1953. He died of heart problems the next year.

==Early life==

Duffy was born in Cranston, Rhode Island to Irish immigrant Michael Duffy and wife Margaret Duffy. A right-handed batter and thrower, Duffy was listed as tall and . He was a textile mill worker who had taken up baseball as a semipro for weekend diversion. He played a couple years of minor league ball in the New England League before jumping to the majors, starting up in the league&#x27;s initial season of 1886, and playing on clubs in Hartford, Springfield and Salem, as well as the Lowell, Massachusetts team in 1887.

==Playing career==
Duffy entered the National League with Cap Anson&#x27;s Chicago White Stockings in after receiving an offer of $2,000 from the club. Anson initially was unimpressed with the , 150 pound Duffy, telling him, &quot;We already have a batboy.&quot; He shortly thereafter earned the reputation of an outstanding outfielder and powerful hitter. Duffy ended up replacing Billy Sunday as the team&#x27;s regular right fielder. He switched leagues, joining the American Association&#x27;s Boston Reds in ; he then returned to the NL with the Boston Beaneaters in , where he enjoyed his best seasons.

From 1891 through , Duffy knocked in 100 runs or more eight times. In Duffy had one of the greatest seasons in baseball history, leading the league with 18 home runs, with 145 RBI and a .440 batting average (see Major League Baseball Triple Crown). Duffy&#x27;s .440 average is the MLB single-season batting average record. At one point during the season, Duffy had a 26-game hitting streak. During his time with Boston, Hughie and Tommy McCarthy forged a reputation as the celebrated “Heavenly Twins” outfield of the early 1890s. Both Heavenly Twins were named to the Hall of Fame.

He was player-manager for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1901. During the 1902 and 1903 seasons, Duffy was player-manager for the Western League&#x27;s Milwaukee Creams franchise.

Duffy was a player-manager for the Phillies from 1904 to 1906. He finished his career in with 106 home runs which was, at the time, one of the highest career totals.

==Post-playing career==

Duffy spent three years (1907–1909) as manager of the Providence Grays. He made $2,000 in his last season as the Providence manager and &quot;The Evening News&quot; in Providence wrote that Duffy was paid hundreds of dollars less than any other manager in the Eastern League. During Duffy&#x27;s three seasons, Providence finished in third place, second place and third place, respectively.

Duffy agreed to manage the Chicago White Sox in 1910. He stayed with the team in 1911. He moved to the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association in 1912, but he was fired after a season in which the team struggled. He turned down an offer to manage the 1913 St. Paul Saints, saying that he was hoping to work in the east. He coached the Harvard varsity and freshman baseball squads from 1917 through 1919. He also managed the 1920 Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League to a .701 winning percentage—the best in the team&#x27;s 83-year history, but only good enough for second place in the league.

In 1921, Duffy was hired as full-time manager of the Red Sox, guiding them for two seasons. Duffy then became a scout for the Red Sox in . From 1928 to 1930, Duffy was the head baseball coach at Boston College.

==Managerial record==
==Later life==
Duffy was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945.

Duffy remained on the Red Sox&#x27; scouting staff nearly to the end of his life, retiring in . He died in Boston on October 19, 1954. He had been suffering from heart problems. Duffy&#x27;s wife Nora died the previous year; they did not have children.

==Posthumously==
In 2019, Duffy was inducted into the Ivan Allen Jr. Braves Museum and Hall of Fame, along with Terry Pendleton.

<text>Ralph Nader&#x27;s Concord Principles were offered in 1992 as an invitation to the Presidential candidates to improve civic dialogue and the democratic institutions of the United States.

They are written as 10 pleas intended to avert a trend of corporatism in government, plutocratic influence, banal sloganistic elections, power singularities and a popular sense of political futility in political dialogue.

The list calls for:
*More governmental transparency and civic communication for social consensus.
*More public control over civic assets such as public lands, airwaves and pension funds.
*Strengthened protections from big government and big corporations.
*Democratic protections against nullification of voter powers by:
**Bold options for &quot;None of the above&quot;.
**12 year maximum term limits.
**Improved voter registration and ballot access.
**Public financing of elections.
**Binding referendum, initiative and recall powers for state voters and non-binding national referendums.
**Checks on presidential and congressional pay raises.
*Improved taxpayer oversight of public expenditure.
*Improving the civic information infrastructure through:
**Computerized government records.
**Utility company billing as a civic notification process.
**Expanded public access television.
*Strengthened access to courts to prevent corporate and government abuse.
*Protection for whistleblowers.
*Shareholder protections against corporate greed.
*Strengthening school curriculum in civic participation.

<doc id="604431" wikidata="Q37049" url="?curid=604431" title="Filmfare Awards">
<text>The Filmfare Awards are annual awards that honour artistic and technical excellence in the Indian cinema. The Filmfare ceremony is one of the most famous film events in India. The awards were introduced by Filmfare magazine of The Times Group in 1954, the same year as the National Film Awards. They were initially referred to as the &quot;Clare Awards&quot; or &quot;The Clares&quot; after Clare Mendonça, the editor of &quot;The Times of India&quot; and modelled after the Academy Awards.

A dual voting system was developed in 1956. Under this system, in contrast to the National Film Awards, which are decided by a panel appointed by the Indian Government, the Filmfare Awards are voted on by both the public and a committee of experts. The ceremony has been sponsored by various private organisations in the past as well as in present provisions. During several years in the 1990s, a live ceremony was broadcast to television audiences but was later discontinued due to unknown reasons.

Since 2001, a recorded and edited version of the awards ceremony was televised on SET a week or two after the ceremony has been held. Since 2018, the ceremony has been televised on Colors. Until 2023, the function was held in Mumbai except for year 2020 when the 65th Filmfare Awards event was held on 16 February 2020 at Sarusajai Stadium, Guwahati.
Until the mid-1990s, Filmfare Awards were the preeminent and most-recognised awards in Bollywood until several other awards sprouted up in Mumbai. This has resulted in poor viewership since the 2000s.

In addition to the flagship event, Filmfare also has variants for other Indian film industries, such as Filmfare Awards South for South Indian cinema; Filmfare Marathi Awards for Marathi cinema; Filmfare Awards Bangla for Bengali cinema, Assamese cinema, and Odia cinema; Filmfare Awards Punjabi for Punjabi cinema; Filmfare OTT Awards for over-the-top films, Filmfare Short Film Awards for short films; and Filmfare Style &amp; Glamour Awards.

== History ==
===History ===

The Filmfare awards were introduced in 1954. The Clares was the original name of the award ceremony, named after &quot;The Times of India&quot; critic Clare Mendonca. Readers of &quot;Filmfare&quot; were polled to decide the winners, and over 20,000 readers spread throughout India participated in the polls; trophies were given to winners of the popular vote. In the first awards function, held on 21 March 1954 at the Metro Theatre of Mumbai, only five awards were presented: Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Music Director.

&quot;Do Bigha Zameen&quot; was the first movie to win the award for Best Film. The first winners for the other four categories were: Bimal Roy for his direction of &quot;Do Bigha Zameen&quot;, Dilip Kumar for his performance in &quot;Daag&quot;, Meena Kumari for her performance in &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot;, and Naushad Ali for his music in &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot;. The Filmfare Awards also introduced the Short Film Category in 2017, with Vidya Balan and Gauri Shinde on the jury. The People&#x27;s Choice Award for Best Short Film was presented to &quot;Khamakha&quot;. Short films like &quot;Chutney&quot;, &quot;Matitali Kusti&quot; and &quot;Taandav&quot; won awards as well.

Hollywood star Gregory Peck was invited to be the guest of honour at the first ever awards on 21 March 1954 at the Metro theatre, Mumbai but could not make it to the function since his flight from Colombo got delayed. However, Peck did attend the banquet that followed the award night at Wellington Club (Gymkhana), Mumbai.

=== Postponement in 1986 and 1987 ===
The winners for the year 1985 were announced in 1986 and the event was scheduled to be held at the Brabourne Stadium in December 1986. The &quot;Bombay Film Industry&quot; as it was known then, went on strike in 1986 because of its many contentious issues with the Government of Maharashtra. As a result, the ceremony was pushed to the next year. The winners of 1985 were awarded on 28 January 1987. For security reasons, the Filmfare was not awarded for 1986 and 1987.

=== Red carpet ===
The red carpet is a segment that takes place before the beginning of the actual ceremony. This is when actors, actresses, producers, directors, singers, composers, and others that have contributed to Indian cinema are introduced. Hosts question the celebrities about upcoming performances and who they think deserves to take the Black Lady home.

=== 2013 awards ===
The 2013 Filmfare awards took place in Mumbai at the Yash Raj Studios in Andheri. A special press conference was held just for its announcement and this took place at the Suburban hotel in Mumbai as well. The theme that year was a hundred years in the future. The reason for the theme to be held that year was because it was meant to be continuous from the previous year&#x27;s theme, where the fraternity celebrated the completion of a hundred years in Indian cinema at the box office.

== Filmfare statuette ==
The statuette, depicting a woman whose arms are upraised in a dance number with her fingers touching, is commonly referred to as &quot;The Black Lady&quot; (or &quot;The Lady in Black&quot;). Originally designed by N.G. Pansare under the supervision of &quot;Times of India&quot;&#x27;s art director Walter Langhammer, it is generally made of bronze, its height is 46.5 cm and it weighs around 5 kg. To celebrate the 25th year of the awards, the statues were made in silver and to celebrate the 50th year the statues were made in gold. The Filmfare trophy has been manufactured by The Award Gallery since 2000.

Until 2012, there had only been a few changes made to the trophy. But as of 2014, a huge change was made to give the trophy a 3-D look. There were two reasons given for this change. First, that the organisers believe that it was necessary to match the many advances in technology in today&#x27;s world, which will advance a lot more in the coming years as well. This was also an attempt to match the theme of the 2013 set of awards at Filmfare in Mumbai: a hundred years leap into the future.

<doc id="604435" wikidata="Q1565178" url="?curid=604435" title="HMS Penelope (F127)">
<text>HMS &quot;Penelope&quot; was a of the Royal Navy. In the Falklands War, &quot;Penelope&quot; fired on an Argentine patrol boat and claimed to be the last ship attacked by Argentine aircraft over the course of the war.
In 1991, she was commissioned into the Ecuadorean Navy, and renamed Presidente Eloy Alfaro.

==Background==
The ship that eventually became HMS &quot;Penelope&quot; was originally intended as a Type 61 aircraft direction frigate to have been named HMS &quot;Coventry&quot;, as part of a second batch of Type 61s. However, under the 1957 Defence White Paper, the order for &quot;Coventry&quot; was deferred. the plan for a new batch of four Type 61s, including &quot;Coventry&quot;, was eventually cancelled in 1961. However, the intended hull was subsequently ordered as a unit of the new &quot;Leander&quot;-class, and was named as HMS &quot;Penelope&quot;. Like other ships of the class, except Cleopatra, &quot;Penelope&quot; was named after a figure of mythology.

==Construction==
&quot;Penelope&quot; was laid down at Vickers-Armstrongs&#x27; Walker shipyard on Tyneside on 14 March 1961, was launched on 17 August 1962. &quot;Penelope&quot; was commissioned on 31 October 1963 with the Pennant number &quot;F127&quot;. Total construction cost was £4,600,000.

The ship was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. Two oil-fired boilers fed steam at and to a pair of double reduction geared steam turbines that in turn drove two propeller shafts, with the machinery rated at , giving a speed of .

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. While the &quot;Leander&quot;-class was planned to be fitted with the Sea Cat surface-to-air missile, &quot;Penelope&quot; was completed with two Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns as a temporary substitute until Sea Cat could be fitted. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations.

As built, &quot;Penelope&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 974 navigation radar carried on the ship&#x27;s foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried to direct the 4.5-inch guns. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 177 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar, together with a Type 199 variable depth sonar (VDS).

==Operational history==

===1963-1967===
After commissioning and workup, &quot;Penelope&quot; joined the 20th Frigate Squadron which was based at Londonderry Port in Northern Ireland, and from September–December 1964, formed part of a special squadron led by the cruiser that visited South American ports in an effort to improve relations and increase trade between Britain and South America. The ship transferred to the 2nd Frigate Squadron in September 1965. In 1966 &quot;Penelope&quot; underwent a refit into a trials ship with much of her weaponry and sensors removed or deactivated. The large Type 965 radar was removed, as was the ship&#x27;s VDS gear and 40 mm guns, while the twin 4.5-in gun turret and fire-control system was cocooned for preservation. She took part in a variety of trials, including tests of different designs of propellers and was refitted in 1970 in preparation for trials of hull noise which involved having her propellers removed and being towed by sister ship at the end of a long cable. She was also fitted with a prototype Type 184M sonar.

===1968===
In 1968, &quot;Penelope&quot; assisted in the aftermath of the Aer Lingus Flight 712 crash in the Irish Sea. There have been a number of conspiracy theories about the crash, including the alleged involvement of &quot;Penelope&quot;. The theory goes that the ship, while performing tests, mistook the aircraft for a target drone and shot her down. All conspiracy theories have been refuted by the Ministry of Defence, while a 2002 report on the accident by an international study team noted that &quot;Penelope&quot; was from the site of the accident, and was not fitted with surface to air missiles.

===1969-1981===
The following year, &quot;Penelope&quot; was present in West Germany during the Kiel Week festival which combined a yachting race and festival events. In 1971, she underwent another refit to allow her to carry out trials on the Sea Wolf missile. All existing armament was removed, and an experimental tracking system and then a Sea Wolf launcher were mounted on the ship&#x27;s flight deck. The location of individual trials was dictated by the needs of the scientists conducting the trials. Sometimes live fire trials were conducted within a firing range off the Welsh coast. 4.5 inch shells fired from a ship several miles away would pass overhead and be targeted by Sea Wolf. Most trials however were conducted in harbour, tied up alongside, with the boilers shut down. These trials continued until December 1977, when she started another refit at Devonport Dockyard to return her to an operational frigate and convert her to Batch 2 Exocet configuration.

===Falklands War===
In 1982, &quot;Penelope&quot; took part in the Falklands War as part of the &quot;Bristol group&quot;, which included two other &quot;Leander&quot;-class ships - and - she did not reach the Falkland Islands area of operations until 26 May. Upon her arrival, &quot;Penelope&quot; recovered air-dropped stores. Thereafter she escorted ships to and from the beachhead at San Carlos and Bluff Cove, including, in late May, the damaged which had suffered damage after being hit by cannon fire and bombs.

On 13 June, &quot;Penelope&quot;″s Lynx helicopter struck the already stranded Argentinian patrol boat &quot;Rio Iguazu&quot; with a Sea Skua missile. &quot;Penelope&quot; also claimed to be the last ship attacked by Argentine aircraft over the course of the war. &quot;Penelope&quot; returned home in September 1982.

Soon after, &quot;Penelope&quot; undertook a Falklands patrol in the tense aftermath of the war, and did not return home until June 1983. The following year, she deployed to the South Atlantic again, patrolling and performing other duties in that region.

===1988===
On 12 September 1988, during a routine daylight replenishment at sea the ship collided with the starboard side of the Canadian naval supply ship . &quot;Penelope&quot; caught the &quot;Preserver&quot;&#x27;s starboard anchor, cutting her port side. The Canadian vessel suffered $260,000 damage, while &quot;Penelope&quot; suffered damage estimated in the millions.

==Ecuadorean Navy service, 1991–2008==

&quot;Penelope&quot; was decommissioned and subsequently sold, along with , to Ecuador. She was renamed &quot;Presidente Eloy Alfaro&quot; after President Eloy Alfaro, a prominent Ecuadorean martyred reformer of the early 20th century.

&quot;Presidente Eloy Alfaro&quot; was decommissioned on 19 March 2008, after 17 years in the Ecuadorean Navy.

<doc id="604437" wikidata="Q6690016" url="?curid=604437" title="Love's Sweet Exile">
<text>&quot;Love&#x27;s Sweet Exile&quot; is a song by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 28 October 1991 by record label Columbia as the second single from their debut album, &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; (1992). The B-side, &quot;Repeat (UK)&quot;, appears on the same album.

== Content ==

The track &quot;Love&#x27;s Sweet Exile&quot; was originally called &quot;Faceless Sense of Void&quot;. The principal difference between the two is that the original version does not have the chorus of the recorded version. The melody for the chorus was taken from another unreleased Manic Street Preachers song, &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Be Happy Without You&quot;. The band – James Dean Bradfield in particular – have said that they dislike the version recorded for &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot;.

Marc Burrows of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; proclaimed the song &quot;easily the most metal &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; gets&quot;, illustrating it to be a &quot;trad-metal monster&quot; embellished by &quot;Bradfield&#x27;s most over-the-top solo&quot;. Sam Shepard of &quot;MusicOHM&quot; alluded to the track&#x27;s &quot;glam metal stylings&quot;, while Martin Power drew comparisons to &quot;the work of a prog metal band&quot;.

== Release ==

&quot;Love&#x27;s Sweet Exile&quot; was released on 28 October 1991 by record label Columbia. The single reached number 26 in the UK Singles Chart on 9 November 1991, making it the band&#x27;s highest charting single at that point.

The CD and standard 12-inch included &quot;Democracy Coma&quot; (which was an album track on the U.S. version of the debut album). There was also a limited gatefold 12-inch with a bonus live version of &quot;Stay Beautiful&quot;.

== Re-release ==

The track was re-worked and re-released as &quot;Love&#x27;s Sweet Exile (Acoustic Blue Version)&quot; on 10 October 2011 as announced via the band&#x27;s website. The song is available as a digital download from Amazon.

== Music video ==

The video for the song directed by W.I.Z. is notable for its homoerotic imagery. Nicky Wire and Richey James Edwards are apparently naked while in close contact with each other, while Bradfield is also apparently naked, with an archery target drawn on his chest. The clip was also the first of many by the band to feature a favoured literary quote on screen. In this case, a piece of text credited to Albert Camus heralds the song; &quot;And then came human beings. They wanted to cling, but there was nothing to cling to&quot;.

<text>Robert Reynolds Jones Jr. (October 19, 1911 – November 12, 1997) was the second president and chancellor of Bob Jones University. Born in Montgomery, Alabama, Jones was the son of Bob Jones Sr., the university&#x27;s founder. He served as president from 1947 to 1971 and then as chancellor until his death.

==Education==
Educated by tutors and at Starke University School in Montgomery, Jones was a voracious reader. When he was ten years old, his father gave him 50 missionary biographies for Christmas, which the boy finished by February.

After graduating from Bob Jones College in 1931, when he was nineteen, Jones earned a master&#x27;s degree in history at the University of Pittsburgh (1933) and did further graduate work at the University of Chicago Divinity School and Northwestern University. Jones was often called &quot;Dr. Bob Jr.&quot; during his lifetime, although he disliked the &quot;Jr.&quot; and his doctorates were honorary, the first conferred by Asbury College in 1934, when he was only twenty-three.

==Early career==
As a young man Jones became an accomplished Shakespearean actor and studied at Stratford-upon-Avon. He considered turning professional and even received an offer from Hollywood—thereby causing some anxious moments for his evangelist father. Jones Jr. did create a one-man show he called &quot;Curtain Calls&quot;, in which he portrayed seven or eight Shakespearean characters accompanied by classical music, scheduling performances four weeks a year from 1933 to 1945.

Jones believed that his primary calling was helping his father administer Bob Jones College. Administration per se seems to have held little interest for him; at least his autobiography contains virtually no mention of his college presidency. 
Nevertheless, Jones seems to have directed the school more autocratically after 1953, when the assistant of Bob Jones Sr., Theodore Mercer, was fired, allegedly for trying to lead a faculty rebellion against the Joneses.

==Fundamentalist leader==
Both Jones&#x27;s position and his intellectual gifts made him a natural leader of separatist fundamentalism. Although he participated in the founding of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) in 1942 and was elected vice president in 1950, Jones left the organization in the following year because of its interest in cultivating a more moderate—to Jones, &quot;compromising&quot;—stance with those who denied biblical orthodoxy. By 1959, Jones had formally broken with Billy Graham, who had accepted the sponsorship of liberal Protestants and Roman Catholics for his 1957 New York City crusade. Later Jones criticized other fundamentalists who were insufficiently separatistic, such as evangelist John R. Rice and Jerry Falwell, whose Moral Majority had embraced Catholics and Mormons.

Meanwhile, Jones became a close friend of militant Ulster Protestant leader Ian Paisley. In 1982, when U. S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig refused to grant a travel visa for Paisley to speak at the University&#x27;s annual Bible Conference, Jones used strong language from the imprecatory Psalms to denounce Haig, urging God to &quot;destroy him utterly.&quot; The flap was widely reported in the media, and Jones was &quot;swamped with vituperative mail&quot; until Haig made a serious blunder less than three months later and was forced to leave office, effectively ending his political career.

For thirteen years Jones edited &quot;Faith for the Family&quot; (1973–1986), an issues-oriented fundamentalist periodical that he originated and then eventually discontinued because of its cost. He wrote poetry in traditional forms, including &quot;Prologue&quot;, a blank-verse drama on the life of John Huss, as well as several hymn texts (set to music by Dwight Gustafson and Joan Pinkston) that are known to a wider fundamentalist community beyond the BJU campus.

==Art connoisseur==

Jones was an connoisseur of European art; he bought his first Russian icon at age thirteen. He began collecting seriously after World War II on a budget of about $30,000 a year, authorized by the University Board of Directors. Jones first concentrated on the Italian Baroque, a style then out of favor and relatively inexpensive in the years immediately following the war. Fifty years after the opening of the gallery, the BJU collection included more than 400 European paintings from the 14th to the 19th centuries (mostly pre-19th century), period furniture, a notable collection of Russian icons, and a hodge-podge of Holy Land antiquities. The Bob Jones University Museum &amp; Gallery is strong in Baroque paintings and includes works by Rubens, Tintoretto, Veronese, Cranach, Gerard David, Murillo, Mattia Preti, Ribera, van Dyck and Doré. The museum is the largest collection of religious art in the Western Hemisphere and remained Jones&#x27; hobby for the remainder of his life.

==Personal life==
Jones could be a demanding superior with strong, hyperbolically expressed, views about matters political and religious. But he also could display a childlike humility, especially on his many visits to foreign missionaries. Intimates found him witty and even impish. Although Jones enjoyed playing villains in Shakespeare plays and religious films—he founded the BJU cinema department in 1950—he genuinely enjoyed a life of ideas and the fine arts. A curator at the North Carolina Museum of Art was genuinely surprised when Jones failed to reflect his preconception as &quot;a kind of backwoods evangelical&quot; who would &quot;thump the Bible&quot; at him. &quot;There was a gentleness and a kinship there,&quot; he recalled. &quot;And even if he knew you thought differently than he did, that was OK; you could still be his friend.&quot;

In 1938, he married Fannie May Holmes. They had three children, including Bob Jones III, who succeeded him as president of BJU. Bob Jones Jr. published two religious novels, several books of sermons, and an autobiography.

Jones died of cancer in 1997 at the age of 86; he is buried near his parents on the campus of Bob Jones University.

==Religious and political views==
*&quot;Pope Paul VI, archpriest of Satan, a deceiver and an anti-Christ, has, like Judas, gone to his own place...[A] pope must be an opportunist, a tyrant, a hypocrite, and a deceiver or he cannot be a pope...A pope claims to be Christ&#x27;s vice-regent on earth; that is, he blasphemously and arrogantly claims to have the divine prerogatives to forgive sins, to assign his enemies to hell...and to speak on matters of faith and morals with the same infallibility as the Holy Bible.&quot; (1978)
*&quot;I have grown sick and tired of the &#x27;Praise God&#x27; sanctimoniously sighed and the &#x27;Bless the Lord&#x27; blasphemously belched forth by the phonies and hypocrites, the deceivers and the deceived who appear on television like the &#x27;700 Club&#x27; and the &#x27;PTL Club.&#x27;...I think the charismatic movement may be more dangerous than all of the other false religions and the cults which we face today.&quot; (1985)
*&quot;I have never known it to fail that when five-point Calvinism becomes the chief end of a man&#x27;s ministry and the most important thing in his preaching, that man becomes cold, dead, egotistical, and a liar.&quot;
*&quot;I am inclined to blame every evil on Romanism. Although I dislike everything about the harlot church, the so-called &#x27;Society of Jesus&#x27; is the most vicious creation of that religion of darkness and dead bones.&quot;
*On the Kent State shootings (1970):&quot;Any students who attack lawfully constituted authority in such a situation should be shot if necessary, and they should expect to be shot. A campus riot is not different from any other riot.&quot;
*&quot;Half of the government departments should be abolished and the rest trimmed to the bone. No senior bureaucrat should be able to retain office longer than eight or ten years, no matter what party is in power, and after twenty years, the people in inferior positions should be retired if they have lasted that long. All Supreme Court justices should be appointed for a limited term of not more than ten years.&quot;
*On Billy Graham (1985): &quot;For a long time I believed that Billy was doing more harm than any other living man. What a tragedy to see him building the church of Antichrist, masking the wickedness of popery, and providing a sheep&#x27;s cloak of Christian recognition for the wolves of apostasy.&quot;
*&quot;Religiously, I think perhaps the silliest idea abroad—and one which is calculated to divide the people of God—is the idea that there is some sort of special inspiration attached to the...King James Version...Moreover, it is a heresy because it implies that God did not completely inspire the original manuscripts and therefore in 1611 He had to add inspiration.&quot;
*&quot;I knew, as a boy, some devout and earnest black preachers of the Word of God. There were many. Today I know of very few and am personally acquainted with only two or three black preachers in this country who emphasize the Scripture, stress the necessity of the new birth, and are in any degree biblical in their convictions or their preaching. It is small wonder then that we are seeing a whole new generation of blacks come up in America who have little moral conviction.&quot; (1985)
*&quot;I have no brief for Oral Roberts, whom I regard as one of the biggest religious phonies in America today.&quot;
*&quot;In not seeking public approval or attempting to &#x27;build a following,&#x27; no doubt I have sometimes not been careful enough about trying to be tactful, discreet, and wise in dealing with the public. I certainly have never tried to avoid meeting an issue head-on, and I have always been honest and frank in my public statements. This may not be the most politic course of action, but then I have never had a politician&#x27;s ambition.&quot;
*After preaching in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Jones was bearded by a &quot;big, burly Dutch missionary&quot; who said, &quot;I hear at Bob Jones University you do not like black people. I hear your rules are too strict and that there is no love there.&quot; Jones interrupted, &quot;I hear that Dutch Calvinists are rude and disagreeable, insulting, and thoroughly abrasive; that their lives are carnal; and that they have no conscience against drinking and smoking and little concern for the winning of souls.&quot; When the missionary was sufficiently taken aback, Jones added that he did not necessarily believe everything he heard.

<doc id="604444" wikidata="Q1094839" url="?curid=604444" title="Koi... Mil Gaya">
<text>Koi... Mil Gaya ( ) is a 2003 Indian science fiction action-drama film directed and produced by Rakesh Roshan. It stars Hrithik Roshan, Preity Zinta and Rekha. In addition to writing the story, Rakesh Roshan also wrote the screenplay with Sachin Bhowmick, Honey Irani, and Robin Bhatt. &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; focuses on Rohit Mehra, a developmentally disabled man who contacts an extraterrestrial being later named Jadoo with his late father Sanjay&#x27;s supercomputer. The film follows his relationship with Nisha, Rohit&#x27;s friend, who falls in love with him.

After the release of the commercially and critically successful romantic film &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot; (2000), Roshan wanted to work again with his son Hrithik on a different type of film. In June 2001, during the 2nd IIFA Awards, he announced the second film when he received the Best Director award for &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot;. Principal photography was shot by Ravi K. Chandran and Sameer Arya from November 2001 to March 2003 on sets built by Sharmishta Roy in Canada, India, and New Zealand. Roshan&#x27;s brother, Rajesh Roshan, composed the film&#x27;s soundtrack and background score. American artists Mark Clobe and Craig Mumma spent on its visual effects.

Filmed on a budget of , &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; was released on 8 August 2003 and was the first instalment of the &quot;Krrish&quot; franchise. Promoted with the tagline &quot;You Are Not Alone...&quot;, it targeted children and parents. It was the second-highest-earning Indian film of the year, grossing worldwide. The film had a positive critical reception, with most of the praise directed at the cast&#x27;s performances. Two sequels titled &quot;Krrish&quot; and &quot;Krrish 3&quot; were released in 2006 and 2013, respectively. A fourth installment, announced to be released in 2026.

The recipient of several awards, &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; won three National Film Awards (including Best Film on Other Social Issues). At the 49th Filmfare Awards, it was nominated in eleven categories and received five awards, including Best Film, Best Director (Rakesh Roshan), and Best Actor and Best Actor (Critics) (Hrithik Roshan). The film won five of its eleven nominations at the 5th IIFA Awards, including Best Director (Rakesh Roshan) and Best Actor (Hrithik Roshan). Considered a milestone of its genre, it is one of the first Indian films featuring aliens. The character of Jadoo became popular and inspired a spin-off series entitled &quot;J Bole Toh Jadoo&quot; (2004). This film was considered a turning point in Roshan&#x27;s career after having a few previous consecutive flops which put his film career in jeopardy.

== Plot ==
Space Scientist Dr. Sanjay Mehra has created a computer from which he sends variations of the syllable &quot;Om&quot; into space, hoping to attract extraterrestrial life. When he receives a response, his colleagues ridicules him. While driving to home, an alien spacecraft appears overhead soon after responding to his signals on his computer. Distracted, he gets into a car accident that kills him in car explosion and injures his pregnant wife, Sonia and their son, Rohit, is born with a developmental disability. Sonia learns that surgery is the only cure for Rohit&#x27;s disability, but it could paralyze or kill him. Not wanting to lose her son, she raises him in Kasauli.

Years later now a grown up Rohit is still a school going kid due to his disability and have found friends in six kids. A young woman, Nisha, arrives and is initially insensitive to Rohit because of his childish practical jokes against her. Her friend, Raj who also happens to be Rohit&#x27;s former classmate, and his gang attack Rohit and break his kick scooter; Sonia chides them for assaulting Rohit, saying that he did not intentionally make fun of her. Realizing her mistake, Nisha gifts Rohit a bicycle and introduces him to her parents, who are sympathetic to him. Rohit and Nisha (now friends) find Sanjay&#x27;s old computer, and Rohit inadvertently summons the aliens. The aliens leave hastily, accidentally leaving a group member behind. Rohit, Nisha, his group, and Sonia befriend the alien, naming him Jadoo and discovers his psychokinetic abilities.

Raj resents Nisha&#x27;s closeness to Rohit, bullying him and spreading a rumour that Raj and Nisha are getting married. The rumour upsets Nisha and Rohit, who is hurt because he thought Nisha was his girlfriend. Jadoo discovers that Rohit is disabled and uses his powers, derived from sunlight, to enhance Rohit&#x27;s mental and intellectual ability. The next morning, Rohit has clear vision; a seventh-standard student, he later solves a tenth-standard mathematics problem orally (surprising his mathematics teacher and his school principal) and also answers his computer teacher who always chided him for his disability and accidentally beats up Raj&#x27;s gang too.

Rohit&#x27;s physical abilities increase to superhuman levels. Raj&#x27;s gang challenge Rohit and group to a basketball game. Rohit scores several baskets but Raj&#x27;s gang begin to cheat; when the sun comes out, Jadoo helps Rohit&#x27;s group win the game. Rohit confesses his love to Nisha and she reciprocates. Raj&#x27;s gang confront Rohit&#x27;s group about the basketball game. While fleeing the group accidentally drops Jadoo. Constable Chelaram Sukhwani sees Jadoo in a bag and calls for backup. Led by Inspector Khurshid Khan, they capture the bag; however, Rohit rescues Jadoo. Confronted by Raj&#x27;s gang, an angry Rohit overpowers them and the policemen arrive. Jadoo is not in the bag; he had escaped when Chelaram was calling the other police officers.

Khurshid, suspicious of Rohit, confronts him at his house with other officers. The police seize Jadoo and knock Rohit out. When he regains consciousness, Rohit catches up to the police vans in time to save Jadoo from being sent to the United States. The flying saucer which he had summoned with his father&#x27;s computer returns, and Rohit bids a sad farewell to Jadoo. When Jadoo leaves, Rohit reverts to his old self; this saves him from prosecution by the government, who congratulate him for his actions.

Raj&#x27;s gang later harass Rohit once again and insults Nisha too, challenging him to kick a ball to them. Rohit angrily kicks the ball into Raj&#x27;s face and realises that Jadoo has permanently returned his superpowers. Rohit and Nisha thank Jadoo, and get married.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Following the success of the romantic thriller &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot; (2000), the director Rakesh Roshan wanted to collaborate again with his son, Hrithik Roshan, who starred in the film alongside the debutante Ameesha Patel. The director wanted his next project to be a child-centric film, not just a romance, which Rakesh Roshan had done many times in his career both as a director and actor. He told Bollywood Hungama that he was motivated to make a film that was not &quot;&quot; but &quot;an out-of-the-box yet entertaining, mainstream film&quot;, after attending the premiere of &quot;Lagaan&quot; in June 2001 during the 2nd IIFA Awards. He announced it subsequently at the ceremony while he was receiving the Best Director award for &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot;. The idea to make a film on extraterrestrial life came up when he saw his five-year-old granddaughter watching a series about it on a cartoon network. He later informed Hrithik Roshan of the project when the latter was shooting the 2001 release &quot;Yaadein&quot; in Delhi; Hrithik Roshan accepted the role immediately.

Rakesh Roshan used a &quot;K&quot; as the film&#x27;s initial, his favourite letter he used in all of his directorial ventures. The film was originally titled &quot;Koi Aap Jaisa&quot; (), &quot;Koi... Tumsa Nahin&quot; (), and &quot;Kaisa Jaadu Kiya&quot; (), before &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; ()—which sounded more romantic to him than any of the previous titles—was finally chosen. He wrote the screenplay with Sachin Bhowmick, Honey Irani, and Robin Bhatt. This took between two and three weeks before its first draft was done in Khandala. Unfamiliar with the topic, Rakesh Roshan confessed he was initially reluctant and doubtful of the project, but Hrithik Roshan convinced him. According to Rakesh Roshan, the screenwriters were &quot;contributing new ideas since the premise itself was so new&quot;. He described it as &quot;a very emotional, thematic film&quot; and &quot;the greatest challenge&quot; of his life, saying that science fiction was not the main theme of the film. Though many have commented on the film&#x27;s similarities to &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), Rakesh Roshan denied being inspired by it. Javed Siddiqui finished the dialogue. &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; was produced by Rakesh Roshan under Filmkraft Productions, which he established in 1980, and distributed by Yash Raj Films.

=== Casting ===

When &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; was announced, Rakesh Roshan said that his son Hrithik Roshan and Preity Zinta would play the lead roles in the film; it marked the actors&#x27; second collaboration after &quot;Mission Kashmir&quot; (2000). Playing against type, Roshan was cast as the developmentally disabled man Rohit. He admitted the role had reminded him of his childhood, saying he could eat as many chocolates as he wanted and &quot;became a baby and everybody was so caring towards me&quot;. Hrithik Roshan called it the &quot;most challenging role&quot; of his career, but revealed he had accepted the part after his father first offered it to him, confessing that his excitement made the role feel much easier. In a retrospective interview with &quot;Mint&quot;, he explained that he &quot;revisited that earlier passion I had felt when I did my first film&quot;. To provide an accurate portrayal, Hrithik Roshan lost , changed his hairstyle, and wore loose clothes to cover his well-built body.

Zinta was given the role of Rohit&#x27;s friend and then-wife, Nisha, after Rakesh Roshan saw her 20-minute performance in Mani Ratnam&#x27;s 1998 thriller &quot;Dil Se..&quot; and was impressed by it. It was originally to be played by Aishwarya Rai Bachchan or Kareena Kapoor; however, he saw that Rai Bachchan would not be a suitable co-actor as she was older than Hrithik Roshan, while Kapoor opted out because she had collaborated with the actor on many projects. Zinta, who enjoyed her part as Nisha and called &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; a special film for her, described the role as an attempt to change her &quot;conventional heroine&quot; image, telling Rediff.com that: &quot;If I only did the glam-and-pout act, I would have stuck out like a sore thumb and destroyed the film&#x27;s timeless texture.&quot; The part proved to be a new challenge for her, and she found it to be her career&#x27;s &quot;toughest&quot; role as it was &quot;a very-controlled character&quot;. Hrithik Roshan spoke positively of his rapport with her, and said he would &quot;have been only half effective&quot; if she was not his co-star.

In July 2001, Rekha joined the cast and portrays Rohit&#x27;s mother Sonia, a part that was specifically written by Rakesh Roshan for her. Rakesh Roshan recommended she play the character as soon as he had finished writing the film&#x27;s screenplay. &quot;I didn&#x27;t even have a back-up artiste in mind for her role. If she had turned me down, I wonder what I would&#x27;ve done&quot;, he told &quot;Filmfare&quot;. Discussing the film and its casting with the press, Hrithik Roshan said that she was the best on-screen mother and called her &quot;marvellous&quot;. Rekha saw that her part was &quot;not too big&quot;, but believed that the role&#x27;s motherhood aspect made it &quot;worthwhile&quot;. The film was her second project with Zinta following &quot;Dil Hai Tumhaara&quot; in 2002; it also reunited her with Rakesh Roshan after both had worked together on several films such as &quot;Khubsoorat&quot; (1980) and &quot;Khoon Bhari Maang&quot; (1989). After Anil Kapoor, Jackie Shroff, and Rishi Kapoor rejected the role, Rakesh Roshan decided to play the small role of Rohit&#x27;s father and Sonia&#x27;s husband, the scientist Sanjay. The film marked his comeback to acting following the 1999 comedy-drama &quot;Mother&quot;.

Indravadan J. Purohit got the part as the alien Jadoo. According to him, Rakesh Roshan had offered the role to 30 or 40 people before he gave it to him without any screen tests. To prepare, Purohit lost several kilograms of weight, joined a gym, and followed a strict diet. Four months before the beginning of shooting, he went to Australia to model his 15 kilogram (33 lb.), three foot (nearly one metre) animatronical mask, which was created by the Australian artists James Colmer and Lara Denman from Bimini Special Effects Studios. They were both emotional when Rakesh Roshan narrates the film&#x27;s screenplay, and they later showed a number of sketches for the mask that took a half-hour each to draw. The mask took nearly a year to build. and cost . Because the mask was heavy, Purohit needed oxygen after shooting every one of his scenes to avoid suffocating. Having starred in more than 300 films (all of which feature him in comic roles), he thought with &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; he got &quot;a role of a lifetime&quot; and considered the film to be a career boost.

=== Filming ===

Principal photography for &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; began on 12 November 2001, in Film City, during the Dhanteras celebration. The total budget ranged from to , making it the most expensive film Rakesh Roshan had made at the time. Ravi K. Chandran and Sameer Arya were the cinematographers, while Sharmishta Roy was the production designer. Rocky Star and Komal Shahani designed the costumes for the rest of the cast. Farah Khan, Raju Khan, and Ganesh Hegde served as the choreographers, and Allan Amin and Tinu Verma did the action direction. A mall replica was built in the film complex for the film&#x27;s 14-day shooting schedule. A schedule in Canada was completed after three days. In September 2002, the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama reported that the film was 40 percent completed.

Chandran used shadows and smoke to make the film&#x27;s sets look dark for the scenes that feature aliens, as he faced difficulties shooting those scenes in bright light. The spaceship, in which Jadoo visited Earth in the film, was designed by Colmer and Denman and built in a year. During filming, Hrithik Roshan was also shooting three other projects—&quot;Na Tum Jaano Na Hum&quot; (2002), &quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot; (2002), and &quot;Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon&quot; (2003). &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; took place in Bali, Rajasthan, Bhimtal, Western Europe, Kasauli, Nainital, and New Zealand. In 2018, Rakesh Roshan revealed its climax sequences were shot in two different versions: in the first one, Rohit lost all of his powers after Jadoo left Earth, while in the second, Rohit did not lose them. After hearing opinions from many directors (such as Aditya Chopra, Karan Johar, Subhash Ghai, and Yash Chopra, he decided to use the second ending, presuming the audience would be satisfied by it.

Shooting ended in March 2003, and &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; was edited by Sanjay Verma. With help from the Bangalore-based company Compudyne Winfosys, the American artists Marc Klobe and Craig Mumma, who previously collaborated on the science fiction films &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996) and &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998), were involved in the special effects. They were enthusiastic about their first Bollywood project, and Rakesh Roshan asked them to be thrifty; they spent . Nonetheless, the director confessed that the film&#x27;s total cost was still excessive for him and attributed this problem to the special effects and making Jadoo&#x27;s costumes.

Sharing the same sentiments, the critic and film trade observer Taran Adarsh added that &quot;the combination of Hrithik, Rakesh and Rajesh Roshan&quot; would make its opening &quot;bumper&quot;.

The film was released theatrically six days later and clashed with Vikram Bhatt&#x27;s &quot;Footpath&quot; and Satish Kaushik&#x27;s &quot;Tere Naam&quot;. According to Rediff.com&#x27;s Syed Firdaus Ashraf, who attended its premiere in Mumbai, he saw that children would continuously shout, &quot;Jadoo! Jadoo!&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; was successful at the box office, due to the audience&#x27;s sympathy for Hrithik Roshan&#x27;s character as a man with developmental disability. Trade analysts speculated the film would be an &quot;acid test&quot; for the actor. The film was released on 450 screens across India and grossed on its opening day, the year&#x27;s second-highest first-day earnings. It grossed by the end of its opening weekend, and after its first week. &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; earned in India, becoming the highest-grossing Indian film of 2003.

=== Critical response ===
 &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; opened to a positive critical reception, with most critics applauding the cast&#x27;s performances (especially that of Hrithik Roshan). Rekha and Zinta&#x27;s performances were panned; several critics found them to be &quot;utterly wasted&quot; serving only as the film&#x27;s &quot;decorative piece[s]&quot;. In spite of that, Rekha&#x27;s performance was better received critically. Udita Jhunjhunwala of &quot;Mid-Day&quot; observed, &quot;You walk into &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; expecting to find a mysterious alien, what you end up discovering is a child inside you.&quot; She praised Roshan for his performance in &quot;his bravest role&quot;. Bollywood Hungama noted, &quot;Hrithik Roshan dominates the show and packs in a power-packed performance. The role of a mentally challenged person is no cakewalk, but the actor takes to it like a fish takes to water. He manages to pull off the zero-to-hero routine exceptionally well. As an actor, he scales dizzier heights with this splendid performance.&quot; Rediff.com&#x27;s R. Swaminathan called the actor &quot;the turbojet that propels the film to the realm of the extraordinary&quot;, and believed that the film&#x27;s screenplay and dialogues gave his character &quot;flesh and blood&quot;. However, he felt Jadoo&#x27;s design was &quot;a big letdown&quot;, saying that it was &quot;plasticky&quot; and &quot;does not exude life&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The Afternoon Despatch &amp; Courier&quot;, Deepa Gahlot described &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; as &quot;a great demo of the Bollywood style of filmmaking&quot;, but criticised its scientific inaccuracy. Manjulaa S. Negi of the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; was not satisfied by the special effects and compared them to &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996). &quot;Screen&quot; editor Bhawana Somaaya appreciated Hrithik Roshan&#x27;s performance, finding it to be &quot;very sincere&quot; and &quot;brave&quot;; she also took note of the film&#x27;s &quot;refreshing&quot; subject. Sharing a similar view, Dinesh Raheja felt Hrithik Roshan had delivered &quot;a cherish-worthy performance&quot;. Both critics added the child actors, who accompanying Hrithik Roshan&#x27;s character throughout the film, contributed positively to his performance. Ziya Us Salam was sure Rekha was underdeveloped and Lata Khubchandani, in her review for Sify, questioned why she was cast for the role; Khalid Mohamed, who gave the film four stars, presumed that Rekha&#x27;s role made her &quot;restrained&quot;—an opinion shared by Nahta. Of Zinta&#x27;s performance, Nahta opined: &quot;Preity Zinta does not have a very significant role in terms of the value she adds although she has a running role. She looks pretty and acts well.&quot; Vijay Venkataramanan of Planet Bollywood appreciated Rekha&#x27;s strong chemistry with Hrithik Roshan.

Chitra Mahesh from &quot;The Hindu&quot; commended Hrithik Roshan and the cast of the children, while referring to the character Jadoo as &quot;amateurish&quot;. In his five-star review published by B4U, Parag Chandrabala Maniar lauded the efforts of Rakesh Roshan &quot;to provide pure and clean entertainment&quot; and Kolbe&#x27;s and Mumma&#x27;s special effects. He said of Hrithik Roshan, &quot;[He] proves his versatility as an actor. At times he moves you and at others he makes you laugh. Here&#x27;s is (&quot;sic&quot;) definitely an actor to reckon with. The number of flops notwithstanding, Hrithik Roshan is here to stay.&quot; Meenakshi Rao of &quot;The Pioneer&quot; complimented his acting style, considering him to be &quot;endearing, as endearing as a child of his mental age&quot;. &quot;The Times of India&quot; Omar Qureshi elaborated, &quot;Hrithik blows away all doubts, theories, criticisms and disbelief with an extraordinarily touching performance of a mentally challenged boy in a rough man&#x27;s world. He surprises you with his reserves of pathos, his gamut of emotion and his transition from weak boy to strong man. Here is a sterling act, worthy of all awards this year—thus far. He is simply incredible, even in his voice modulations, his sloppy walk and his lopsided smile.&quot; An Indo-Asian News Service critic wrote that the pairing of Hrithik Roshan and Preity Zinta took &quot;the couple conventions of Hindi cinema far beyond the escapades of typical Hindi cinema&quot;.

Overseas critics focused their attention on Hrithik Roshan&#x27;s performance and the film&#x27;s themes, while also pointing out its many similarities to American SF films (most notably &quot;E.T.&quot;). Ed Halter of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; predicted that the film&#x27;s elements, including its &quot;nonstop plagiarism from classics like &quot;E.T.&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;&quot;, might be embraced by foreign nerds. Grady Hendrix of &quot;Film Comment&quot; commented that the film was an &quot;embarrassment of riches&quot;, summarising, &quot;... it&#x27;s mockable, it&#x27;s silly, it&#x27;s cloaked in a cloying miasma of cute, but its off-handed facility with pop-cinema conventions, spiced up with some jarring stylistic disconnects, delivers the most mind-bending entertainment experience of the season. This is commercial moviemaking taken to its logical, mondo mercantilist conclusion.&quot; M. J. Simpson expressed approval of the entire cast, especially Hrithik Roshan, whom he regarded as the film&#x27;s &quot;oddest aspect&quot;. Calling it &quot;bright, loud and relentless fun&quot;, Jürgen Fauth gave the film three-and-a-half-out-of-five stars and reviewed its comedic, romantic, science-fictional, musical, action, and melodramatic elements positively. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine hailed it as the &quot;most novel Bollywood movie of the year&quot;. The BBC&#x27;s Manish Gajjar described Hrithik Roshan&#x27;s role as a &quot;mentally-retarded-child-[turned]-superman-hero&quot;. Derek Elley praised him for avoiding his typecasting as a romantic hero, while David Parkinson of &quot;Radio Times&quot; thought that the film served as &quot;slick, sentimental entertainment&quot;. Writing for &quot;TV Guide&quot;, Maitland McDonagh singled out Jadoo&#x27;s expression in the scene where he is lost in a forest for praise.

=== Accolades ===

&quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; won three awards at the 51st National Film Awards, including National Film Award for Best Film on Other Social Issues tied with Prakash Jha&#x27;s crime film &quot;Gangaajal&quot;. At the 49th Filmfare Awards, the film was nominated for eleven categories including Best Actress (Zinta), Best Supporting Actress (Rekha), Best Performance in a Comic Role (Johnny Lever), and Best Music Director (Rajesh Roshan). It went on to win five trophies including Best Film, Best Director for Rakesh Roshan, and Best Actor and Best Actor (Critics) for Hrithik Roshan.

It also earned five Screen Awards, five Zee Cine Awards, four Producers Guild Film Awards, and two Stardust Awards.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot;, often abbreviated as &quot;KMG&quot;, has been widely regarded as the first Indian science fiction film with alien characters in it, although this was disputed by several film experts. In &quot;The Liverpool Companion to World Science Fiction Film&quot; (2014), professors Jessica Langer and Dominic Alessio wrote that the Tamil-language film &quot;Kalai Arasi&quot; (1963) should be given the title.:56 Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the critic and author Anupama Chopra stated that &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; was &quot;Hindi cinema&#x27;s first major science fiction film.&quot; The BBC reported that the film &quot;is certainly a milestone in the reformation of commercial Indian cinema as a whole&quot;, and the American graphic artist Aaron Marcus, in his 2014 book &quot;Design, User Experience, and Usability: Health, Learning, Playing, Cultural, and Cross-Cultural User Experience&quot; called it the most popular Bollywood science fiction film.:75 In 2016, &quot;Mint&quot; featured &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; on its lists of &quot;Children&#x27;s Day: 10 Memorable Bollywood Films&quot; and &quot;Ten Bollywood films Dealing with Disability&quot;.

After making his debut in &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot; (2000), Hrithik Roshan starred in a series of romantic films, most of which under performed financially including &quot;Yaadein&quot; (2001), &quot;Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage&quot; (2002), and &quot;Na Tum Jaano Na Hum&quot; (2002). Trade analysts believed that his career was ended by these failures. The release of &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot;, which Hrithik Roshan wanted to revive his career, changed analysts&#x27; perspectives of the actor and suggested that the film resurrected his position in the industry. While attending its premiere, Nahta told Rediff.com that it was &quot;very important for him. Hrithik is not &#x27;out&#x27; of the industry but his position is shaky. So, if the audience likes the film, it is good for him.&quot; In 2010, &quot;Filmfare&quot; magazine included his performance on their list of &quot;80 Iconic Performances&quot; of Hindi cinema, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s incredible how the actor manages to diminish his size, unstylise his look, wear bug-eyed glasses and talk funny ... Watch him laugh, cry or bond with his remote controlled alien friend and note his nuanced turn.&quot; He and Zinta collaborated again in the war drama &quot;Lakshya&quot; (2004), which failed at the box office although he received positive feedback. In 2005, Zinta chose &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; as one of her favourite films.

The film was remade into a soap opera in Indonesia under the title (2003–2007) and in Telugu as &quot;Orey Pandu&quot; (2005). Following the film&#x27;s success, Jadoo became popular with children. Nickelodeon India aired a spin-off television series based on the character, titled &quot;J Bole Toh Jadoo&quot;, in 2004. In 2020, after the United States Department of Defense published footage of an unidentified flying object, internet memes relating to the film went viral; most of them use the scene where Rohit summons aliens by his father&#x27;s computer.

== Sequels ==

&quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; is the first installment in the &quot;Krrish&quot; franchise. In November 2004, in an interview with Subhash K. Jha of Rediff.com, Hrithik Roshan announced that his father, Rakesh Roshan, had begun the production of a sequel to &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot;, based on a screenplay which was written in eight or nine months. A superhero film titled &quot;Krrish&quot;, Hrithik Roshan would play a dual role, reprising his part as Rohit from the original film and playing the character&#x27;s eponymous son. While Rekha also reprised her role in the sequel, Zinta&#x27;s position as the female lead was given to Priyanka Chopra. Produced on a budget of , principal photography started in March 2005 and finished in January 2006. &quot;Krrish&quot; opened on 23 June 2006 to mixed reviews, with critics were disappointed by the replacement of Zinta. However, the film was a commercial success and became the second-highest-grossing Indian film that year, earning more than .

A second superhero sequel, &quot;Krrish 3&quot;, was announced in December 2006. Hrithik Roshan and Chopra reprise their roles, while Vivek Oberoi and Kangana Ranaut play the antagonists.

Although Rakesh Roshan never officially confirmed its budget, reports from the media estimated it to be above . Filming took place between December 2011 and June 2012. &quot;Krrish 3&quot; premiered on 4 November 2013 and was declared a commercial success, emerging as the fourth-highest-grossing Indian film of the year.

<text>Lesmahagow ( ; or &quot;Lesmahagae&quot;, ) is a small town in the historic county of Lanarkshire on the edge of moorland, near Lanark in the central belt of Scotland. Lesmahagow was also a civil parish. It lies west of the M74, and southeast of Kirkmuirhill. It is also known as Abbey Green or the Gow.

==Etymology==

The name means &quot;Enclosure (meaning a walled area, like a monastery or fort) of St Machutus&quot;. The saint was born in Wales and may originally have been known as &quot;Mahagw&quot; prior to emigrating to Brittany where he became known by the Latinised form of the name and also as &quot;St Malo&quot;. It is also possible that the first syllable may mean &quot;garden&quot; rather than &quot;monastery&quot;, although Mac an Tailleir (2003) believes the former was altered from the latter in Gaelic.

==Religion==

The town has three Christian congregations, namely Lesmahagow Old Parish Church of the Church of Scotland and Abbeygreen Church of the Free Church of Scotland and an Evangelical congregation, (the Hope Hall) on the main street. Roman Catholic residents are served by Our Lady and St John&#x27;s in the neighbouring village of Blackwood, away.

Lesmahagow Priory, founded by Benedictine monks in 1144, no longer stands but its foundations were excavated in 1978 and are located next to the Old Parish Church off Church Square.

The Scottish branch of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness operates from Lesmahagow.

==Twin towns==

Clydesdale International Twinning Association (CITA) was set up in 1975 to promote the benefits of twinning to all sections of the local community. This organisation mainly focuses on the larger towns in the old Clydesdale council area.

==Highland Games==

The Highland Games are held annually in June with Pipe Bands competing in Grades 1 through 4. There are also events for Highland dancing, weight over the bar, tossing the caber and archery. The first Highland Games was held in 1960 as a result of a collaboration between Lesmahagow Juniors Football Club and the now defunct Vale of Nethan Pipe Band. Originally held in Craighead Park, it is now held in the Glebe Park and entry is free, mainly due to community fundraising events and a strong committee.

==Landmarks==
Birkwood Castle is nearby.

<text>Robert Reynolds Jones III (born August 8, 1939) is an American academic administrator and writer. The son of Bob Jones Jr. and grandson of Bob Jones Sr., he served as the third president of Bob Jones University from 1971 to 2005.

==Biography==

Jones was born in Cleveland, Tennessee, the son of Fannie May (Holmes) and Bob Jones Jr. He moved with his family to Greenville, South Carolina in 1947 when Bob Jones College built a new campus and became Bob Jones University. Because his father was a connoisseur of the arts, Jones early visited Europe and the Levant on his father&#x27;s summer tours. As a teenager, Jones was given minor roles in campus Shakespeare performances and a major role in the film version of his father&#x27;s novel &quot;Wine of Morning&quot;. Likewise, as the son and grandson of well-known fundamentalists, Jones met many politicians and notable preachers in his youth.

At fifteen, his father rusticated Jones to a summer camp sponsored by Ernest Reveal, a BJU board member and the founder of the Evansville Rescue Mission, where Jones preached and otherwise participated in the camp&#x27;s evangelistic ministry to children experiencing poverty from the Evansville area. Jones credited this experience with having had a significant impact on his later career.

Jones completed his bachelor of arts (1959) and master of arts (1961) in speech from Bob Jones University and took additional courses in speech and drama at Northwestern University and New York University. He also received honorary degrees from two small Bible schools and a seminary.

Although less intellectually gifted than his father, Jones did excel academically. Unlike his father, though, Jones also developed an interest in athletics — basketball as a young man, and later skiing, hunting, and other outdoor sports. Jones enjoyed flying and considered a military career.

Nevertheless, by the end of his undergraduate years, Jones believed that he had been called to &quot;help perpetuate the ideals and standards&quot; of the school his grandfather founded. Jones served as a teaching assistant in the speech department and then as a dormitory supervisor. Between 1961 and 1971, his father provided him with a growing administrative role in the university, including preaching for campus services. Jones also accepted an increasing number of off-campus speaking invitations.

Unlike his father, Jones became genuinely interested in the mechanics of university administration, although his training for his college presidency was, like his father&#x27;s, informal at best. To help with business judgments, Jones eventually appointed a personal friend and former businessperson, Bob Wood, as vice president. Rather shy and &quot;reticent to initiate conversations with strangers&quot;, Jones was also a highly competitive, &#x27;Type A&#x27; personality who regularly worked sixteen hours a day during his presidency. In conjunction with the university&#x27;s 70th-anniversary celebration, Governor David Beasley presented him with the Order of the Palmetto.

Jones inherited the Bob Jones University presidency as its enrollment increased. However, the school also began to face the federal government&#x27;s opposition to its racial policies. During the early 1980s, Jones was frequently interviewed by the media, arguing that the university&#x27;s racial policies were protected by First Amendment rights. Nevertheless, Jones had difficulty finding a route of escape from the positions on race that his predecessors had adopted during the period of segregation in the early twentieth-century South, and which he had endorsed in his youth.

In December 2014, as part of a BJU-commissioned investigation to determine if students had &quot;received inadequate help when they reported to a BJU representative that they had been abused or assaulted at some point in their past,&quot; G.R.A.C.E. (Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment), an independent Christian organization, reported that Jones III had &quot;repeatedly demonstrated a significant lack of understanding regarding the many painful dynamics associated with sexual abuse&quot; and recommended BJU take &quot;personnel action&quot; against him.

Until her death in 2019, Jones was married to Beneth Peters, an author and seminar speaker, whom he had gotten to know when she played Roxane to his Christian in a campus performance of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;. They had three children. In March 2020, he married Karen Rowe, a member of the BJU English faculty. Jones&#x27;s younger son, Stephen, replaced him as president of BJU in May 2005 when Jones took the title, &quot;Chancellor.&quot;

Jones remains chair of the International Testimony to an Infallible Bible and chair of the board of directors of the Bob Jones University Museum &amp; Gallery. Jones continues to speak regularly for churches, schools, evangelistic campaigns, youth rallies, and other religious gatherings in his eighties.

==Religious, political, and social views==
*Jones once declared that BJU had banned interracial dating because &quot;God has separated people for His own purpose&quot;; nevertheless, on March 3, 2000, he announced on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; that the university would abandon the long-standing rule over which the university had forfeited its federal tax-exempt status in 1983.
*In 1980, Jones said homosexuality would be solved &quot;posthaste if homosexuals were stoned.&quot; In March 2015, he issued a public apology for this statement, saying in part that it was, &quot;antithetical to my theology and my 50 years of preaching a redeeming Christ. Upon now reading these long-forgotten words, they seem to me as words belonging to a total stranger — were my name not attached. I cannot erase them, but wish I could, because they do not represent the belief of my heart or the content of my preaching. Neither before, nor since, that event in 1980 have I ever advocated the stoning of sinners.&quot;
*In 1982, when asked by TV talk show host Phil Donahue, &quot;Does anybody get to heaven if he&#x27;s not born again?&quot; Jones replied, &quot;Absolutely not. Jesus told Nicodemus, a religious man, &#x27;You must be born again.&#x27;...The Lord Jesus said, &#x27;I am the way, the truth and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me.&#x27;&quot;
*In the 1980s, Jones once denounced Ronald Reagan as &quot;a traitor to God&#x27;s people&quot; for choosing as his vice president George H. W. Bush, whom Jones called &quot;a devil.&quot; Some years later, however, while visiting the Oval Office, he thanked the elder Bush for being a good president. In a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article published in 2005, he was quoted as saying, &quot;I was not convinced that the first George Bush was a real conservative. I was afraid that he had ties to certain organizations that revealed what he really was, that his public rhetoric was hiding what he really was. And devils deal in treachery like that, in deceit. &#x27;Devil&#x27; may have been a strong word, but you know what? He turned out to be a whole lot better president than I expected, and I shook his hand in the Oval Office and thanked him for being a good president.&quot;
*Jones referred to Catholicism as &quot;the religion of the anti-Christ and a Satanic system&quot; and called Mormonism and Catholicism &quot;cults which call themselves Christian&quot;. In October 2007, he endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, a devout Mormon, for the Republican nomination for president.
*Shortly after George W. Bush won re-election in 2004, Bob Jones III sent a congratulatory letter to the president declaring that he had &quot;been given a mandate...Put your agenda on the front burner and let it boil. You owe the liberals nothing. They despise you because they despise your Christ.&quot;
*In 2011, referring to Barack Obama&#x27;s religion, Jones said, &quot;Some people will say whatever they think the politically helpful thing would be... I say, &#x27;Where is the evidence that he is a Christian?&#x27;&quot;
*Jones&#x27; most often repeated quotation: &quot;The most sobering reality in the world today is that people are dying and going to Hell today.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Frank Knox&quot; (DD-742) was a &quot;Gearing&quot;-class destroyer which served in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1971. She was then transferred to the Greek Navy and renamed &quot;Themistoklis&quot; (D-210). The ship was decommissioned in 1992 and finally sunk as a target in 2001.

==History==
===1944-1971===
&quot;Frank Knox&quot; was built at Bath, Maine and was named after Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox. Commissioned in December 1944, she arrived in the western Pacific war zone in mid-June 1945, in time to participate in the final carrier air raids on the Japanese home islands as part of Task Force 38. During the Battle of Okinawa she acted as a radar picket destroyer giving early warnings of incoming air raids. She was present in Tokyo Bay when Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945 and remained in the Far East until early February 1946. The ship made additional deployments to the region during the later 1940s and was reclassified as a radar picket destroyer DDR-742, in March 1949.

&quot;Frank Knox&quot; again steamed across the Pacific to take part in hostilities in early July 1950, shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War. During this combat tour, which lasted into 1951, her missions included support of the Inchon invasion, shelling enemy targets ashore and patrolling the Taiwan Straits. Two more Korean War cruises followed in 1952 and 1953, and for the rest of the decade &quot;Frank Knox&quot; deployed regularly to WestPac for Seventh Fleet service.

In 1960–1961 &quot;Frank Knox&quot; was modernized under the FRAM II program, which gave her updated radars and other new equipment. She was based in the Far East from late 1961 until mid-1964, then returned home via Australia and the south Pacific. Again deployed in June 1965, she briefly served off Vietnam conducting naval gunfire support and coastal patrol operations. Via Tsoying Naval Base, Taiwan while underway in the South China Sea on 18 July, &quot;Frank Knox&quot; ran aground on Pratas Reef, and was only freed after a very difficult salvage effort. Though she was badly damaged, and relatively elderly, her command and control capabilities justified an extensive repair job, which was carried out at Yokosuka, Japan, over the next year.

&quot;Frank Knox&quot; rejoined the active forces in November 1966 and resumed her pattern of nearly all annual Seventh Fleet cruises, frequently taking part in Vietnam combat missions. Redesignated DD-742 at the beginning of 1969, she completed her final deployment in November 1970 and was decommissioned at the end of January 1971.

===Greek service===

USS &quot;Frank Knox&quot; was transferred to the Greek Navy a few days later. Renamed &quot;Themistoklis&quot; (D210) (from Themistocles Athenian statesman who persuaded Athens to build a navy and then led it to victory over the Persians), she served for another two decades before being placed out of commission in the early 1990s. The ship was sunk as a torpedo target by the Greek Submarine Nireus (S-111) on 12 September 2001.

<text>Number 17 Squadron (sometimes written as No. XVII Squadron), currently No. 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES), is a squadron of the Royal Air Force. It was reformed on 12 April 2013 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, as the Operational Evaluation Unit (OEU) for the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning.

==History==

===First World War===

No. 17 Squadron formed for the first time on 1 February 1915 at Fort Grange, Gosport as part of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). It was first equipped with the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c. After an initial training period, the Squadron embarked for Egypt in November and arrived on 11 December. On 24 December, the Squadron made its first reconnaissance flight over the Turkish lines in Sinai, also flying in support of troops engaged with Turkish army units in the Western Desert. Detachments were also to be found in Arabia until July 1916, when the Squadron was sent to Salonika as a mixed unit of twelve B.E.2cs for reconnaissance and a scout component of two Airco D.H.2s and three Bristol Scouts. At first it was the only RFC unit in Macedonia but was later joined by others in April 1918, handing over its fighters to a newly formed No. 150 Squadron. For the rest of the war, it was engaged in tactical reconnaissance and artillery spotting on the Bulgarian border.

===Interwar years===
In December 1918, the Squadron re-equipped with twelve Airco D.H.9s and six Sopwith Camels, sending &#x27;A Flight&#x27; to Batum to support the White Russian forces and &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;C Flights&#x27; to Constantinople in January 1919. On 14 November 1919, No. 17 Squadron was disbanded.

The Squadron reformed at RAF Hawkinge on 1 April 1924 and was equipped with Sopwith Snipes. From this time No. 17 Squadron formed part of the fighter defence of the UK until the outbreak of the Second World War. The Squadron converted to the Hawker Woodcock in March 1926, one of only two squadrons to operate it - the other being No. 3 Squadron. In June 1927 a Woodcock from No. 17 Squadron was borrowed by the pilot of the Spirit of St. Louis, Charles Lindbergh, who flew it from London to Paris shortly after his transatlantic flight. In January 1928, the Squadron converted over to the Gloster Gamecock, these were only kept until September when they were exchanged for Armstrong Whitworth Siskins.

No. 17 Squadron then equipped with Bristol Bulldog Mk.IIs in October 1929, these would be kept up until August 1936. However, during the Abyssinian Crisis in 1935, the Squadron lost most of its Bulldogs as reinforcements for other squadrons moving to the Middle East and so had to fly Hawker Harts for a period. No. 17 Squadron were equipped with Gloster Gauntlets in August 1936. It was in recognition of these aircraft that the Squadron got its badge design, which was officially approved by Edward VIII in October 1936. The Squadron received its first monoplane, the Hawker Hurricane Mk.I, in June 1939.

===Second World War===

No. 17 Squadron flew defensive patrols from numerous bases in Britain, including RAF Debden and RAF Martlesham Heath, until the German attack on France in May 1940. Once the Phony War was over, fighter sweeps were then flown over the Netherlands, Belgium and French airfields to cover the retreat of allied troops. In June 1940, the Squadron moved to Brittany as the remnants of BEF and RAF units in France were evacuated, retiring to the Channel Islands for two days before returning to the UK. No. 17 Squadron flew over southern England throughout the Battle of Britain. The Squadron briefly upgraded to Hurricane Mk.IIas in February 1941 however they shortly reverted to Hurricane Mk.Is in April. No. 17 Squadron moved up to RAF Castletown in northern Scotland on 5 April for rest. In July 1941 the Squadron again upgraded its Hurricanes, this time to Mk.IIbs.

On 11 November 1941, the Squadron sailed for the Far East where war broke out on 7 December. Diverted to Burma, it arrived in January 1942, as Japanese troops neared Rangoon. Defensive patrols were flown until the Rangoon airfields were overrun and No. 17 Squadron moved north, eventually being cut off from India while operating from Lashio. The surviving aircraft were flown out and the ground personnel made their way across Burma to the Indian border. By the end of May, the Squadron had re-assembled at Calcutta and in June received aircraft again for the defence of the area. In August 1942, No. 17 Squadron upgraded to Hurricane Mk.IIcs. Ground attack missions began in February 1943 and continued until August, when the Squadron moved to Ceylon. Supermarine Spitfire Mk.VIIIs began to arrive in March 1944 and were taken back to the Burma front in November to fly escort and ground attack missions. In June 1945, No. 17 Squadron upgraded to Spitfire Mk.XIVes. The Squadron was withdrawn from Burma to prepare for the invasion of Malaya. However, due to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they were simply taken by the carrier to the landing beaches near Penang in early September, soon after the Japanese capitulation.

===Post-War===
====Cold War====

In April 1946, No. 17 Squadron arrived in Japan to form part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The squadron remained here until it disbanded on 23 February 1948. However it shortly returned to existence on 11 February 1949 at RAF Chivenor when No. 691 Squadron was renumbered as No. 17 Squadron. The Squadron adopted No. 691 Squadron&#x27;s role of being an anti-aircraft co-operation unit. During this time the Squadron flew a mixture of aircraft including the Spitfire LF.XVIe and target tugs: Airspeed Oxford T.II; Miles Martinet TT.I; North American Harvard TT.IIb; Bristol Beaufighter TT.X. No. 17 Squadron continued this role until it disbanded once again on 13 March 1951.

The Squadron reformed at RAF Wahn in West Germany on 1 June 1956. This time it operated English Electric Canberra PR.7s, thus carrying out the photo reconnaissance role. The Squadron moved to RAF Wildenrath in April 1957 and flew from here before standing down on 31 December 1969. It stood up once more on 1 September 1970 at RAF Brüggen, this time flying the new McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR.2, in a ground attack role. They were also assigned to SACEUR from which the Phantoms held a tactical nuclear strike role, carrying American supplied nuclear weapons. In September 1975, the Squadron began to convert over to the SEPECAT Jaguar GR.1.

No. 17 Squadron were fully re-equipped with twelve Jaguar GR.1s by 31 January 1976. These continued the nuclear strike role from the Phantoms, being assigned to SACEUR, but this time carrying the British WE.177 nuclear weapon, a role they kept until 1984. Their task was to support land forces in a high-intensity European war using conventional weapons initially, and tactical nuclear weapons if a conflict escalated. Some aircraft were to be held back in reserve from the conventional phase to ensure that sufficient aircraft survived the conventional phase to deliver the squadron&#x27;s full stock of eight nuclear weapons.

Still at RAF Brüggen, No. 17 Squadron began to convert to the Panavia Tornado GR.1 in January 1985. They reached full strength of twelve aircraft by 1 March when the last Jaguars were disbanded. The Squadron at this time also had eighteen WE.177 nuclear bombs, and although the squadron&#x27;s role remained unchanged, their Tornado aircraft were each able to carry two WE.177 bombs, with the ratio of weapons to aircraft at full strength increasing to 1.5 : 1.

====Operation Granby====

During the First Gulf War in 1991, No. 17 Squadron engineers were deployed to Muharraq Airfield in Bahrain, and also had crews sent to Dhahran Airfield. At Muharraq, its twelve Tornado GR.1s were split between three flight lines – &#x27;Snoopy AirWays&#x27;, &#x27;Triffid Airways&#x27; and &#x27;Gulf Airways&#x27;. Tornado operations, as part of Op GRANBY, began on 17 January 1991 to assert air superiority over Iraq. The Squadron suffered a loss on 24 January when a Tornado GR.1 (ZA403) was rocked by an explosion forcing the pilot (Fg. Off. S. J. Burgess) and navigator (Sqn Ldr R. Ankerson) to eject. Both crew members were captured and were kept as prisoners of war (PoWs) until the end of conflict. An investigation after the war of the wreckage and flight recorder deduced that one of the 1,000lb bombs dropped had detonated prematurely thus causing extensive damage to the Tornado. No. 17 Squadron suffered its second loss on 14 February when a Tornado GR.1 (ZD717) carrying out laser-guided bomb attacks on an Iraqi airfield was forced down by two Iraqi SAMs which exploded in close proximity to the aircraft. The pilot (Flt. Lt. R. J. Clark) initiated ejection for himself and his navigator (Flt. Lt. S. M. Hicks). On landing Clark was captured by Iraqi forces and was held as a PoW for the rest of the war, it was only after his capture that he learned his navigator Hicks had been killed in the attack.

====Tornados to Typhoons====
Returning to RAF Brüggen, No. 17 Squadron continued its nuclear strike role up until the retirement of the WE.177, with it finally relinquishing its nuclear delivery capability fully in 1998. With the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Germany, the RAF planned to reduce its presence in Germany by half, and by 1996 a final decision was made to withdraw the entire RAF presence from the country. Due to the Strategic Defence Review of 1998, it was decided to withdraw two RAF squadrons, one of which was No. 17 Squadron. The Squadron and its Tornado GR.1s disbanded on 31 March 1999, ending almost 30 years at RAF Brüggen.

The Squadron was reformed on 1 September 2002 as No. XVII (Reserve) Squadron at BAE Systems&#x27;s Warton Aerodrome. At Warton, a special facility had been constructed to specially operate the new Eurofighter Typhoon T.1s and F.2s. No. 17 (R) Squadron was tasked with being the Operational Evaluation Unit (OEU), or alternatively the Typhoon Operational Evaluation Unit (TOEU), for the type, becoming the first in the RAF to operate it. The Squadron relocated to RAF Coningsby on 1 April 2005 and was officially re-formed at its new base on 19 May 2005. With the Typhoon fully operational, the need for the separate OEU ended and so the Squadron was disbanded on 12 April 2013. Its functions were taken over by the RAF&#x27;s Test and Evaluation Squadron, No. 41 (R) Squadron.

===Modern day===
====F-35B Lightning====

The Squadron stood up at Edwards AFB, California, on 12 April 2013 as a joint RAF/Royal Navy Test and Evaluation Squadron for the new Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning. In January 2014, it became the first UK, and RAF, squadron to operate the F-35B Lightning, with BK-1 (&quot;ZM135&quot;) being the first British aircraft. In February 2015, the Squadron celebrated its centenary at Edwards AFB. No. 17 (R) Squadron is currently made up of half RAF/RN personnel, as well as training personnel for No. 617 Squadron and No. 207 Squadron; the second and third RAF squadrons to operate the F-35B in 2018 and 2019. Equipped with 3 F-35B aircraft (&quot;ZM135&quot;, &quot;ZM136&quot; and &quot;ZM138&quot;), it continues to be the first UK Lightning squadron and is tasked with full-time operational test and evaluation of the F-35B, required to bring the aircraft and its weapons into UK service. It operates within the Joint Operational Test Team for F-35 at Edwards AFB, flying operational test sorties alongside all variants from the US Air Force, US Navy, US Marine Corps and Royal Netherlands Air Force, as part of the UK Partnership within the F-35 program. It&#x27;s currently embedded with the 461st Flight Test Squadron of the United States Air Force. No. 17 (Reserve) Test and Evaluation Squadron lost its (Reserve) suffix on 1 February 2018 when the (Reserve) nameplate was rescinded across the entire RAF, thus becoming No. 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron.

No. 17 TES embarked their three F-35Bs upon on 13 October 2019 as part of Westlant 19, becoming the first British jets to land on the carrier.

<doc id="604459" wikidata="Q1810885" url="?curid=604459" title="Life of Adam and Eve">
<text>The Life of Adam and Eve, also known in its Greek version as the Apocalypse of Moses (; ), is a Jewish apocryphal group of writings. It recounts the lives of Adam and Eve from after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden to their deaths. It provides more detail about the Fall of Man, including Eve&#x27;s version of the story. Satan explains that he rebelled when God commanded him to bow down to Adam. After Adam dies, he and all his descendants are promised a resurrection.

The ancient versions of the Life of Adam and Eve are: the Greek Apocalypse of Moses, the Latin Life of Adam and Eve, the Slavonic Life of Adam and Eve, the Armenian Penitence of Adam, the Georgian Book of Adam, and one or two fragmentary Coptic versions. These texts are usually named as Primary Adam Literature to distinguish them from subsequent related texts, such as the Cave of Treasures, that include what appears to be extracts, the Testament of Adam, and the Apocalypse of Adam.

They differ greatly in length and wording, but for the most part appear to be derived from a single source that has not survived. Each version contains some unique material as well as variations and omissions.

While the surviving versions were composed from the early 3rd to the 5th century AD, the literary units in the work are considered to be older and predominantly of Jewish origin. There is wide agreement among scholars that the original was composed in a Semitic language in the 1st century AD.

== Themes ==
The main theological issue in the texts is that of the consequences of the Fall of Man, of which sickness and death are mentioned. Other themes include the exaltation of Adam in the Garden, the fall of Satan, the anointing with the oil of the Tree of Life, and a combination of majesty and anthropomorphism in the figure of God, involving numerous merkabahs and other details that show a relationship with 2 Enoch. The idea of resurrection of the dead is present and Adam is told God&#x27;s son Christ will come at that time to anoint all who believe in him with the Oil of Mercy, a fact that has led many scholars to think part of the text is of Christian origin. The Life of Adam and Eve is also important in the study of the early Seth traditions.

Parallels can be found with some New Testament passages, such as the mention of the Tree of Life in Revelation 22:2. The more striking resemblances are with ideas in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians: Eve as the source of sin (2 Corinthians 11:3), Satan disguising himself as an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14), the location of the paradise in the third heaven (2 Corinthians 12:2). In addition, there are parallels between Jesus&#x27; forty days in the desert and Adam and Eve&#x27;s forty days in the rivers. No direct relationship can be determined between the New Testament and the Life of Adam and Eve, but the similarities suggest that Paul the Apostle and the author of 2 Enoch were near contemporaries of the original author of this work and moved in the same circle of ideas. The theme of death is also central to the text. While Adam is dying, Seth asks what it means to be ill, as he has no concept of it. Adam must explain to his children what dying and death means, and what to do with his body when he dies.

==Versions==
=== Greek Apocalypse of Moses ===
The Apocalypse of Moses (literally, the Revelation of Moses) is the usual name for the Greek version of the Life of Adam and Eve. This title was given to it by Tischendorf, its first editor, and taken up by others. In the text, Moses is referred to only in the first sentence as the prophet to whom the story was revealed. The Greek Apocalypse of Moses (not to be confused with the Assumption of Moses) is usually considered to predate the Latin Life of Adam and Eve.

Tischendorf used four manuscripts for his edition: manuscripts A, B, C, and D. During the 20th century many other manuscripts have been found, of which E1 and E2, which are similar to the Armenian version, merit special mention. A1, B, C, D, E1, and E2 were the basis of the English translation of Welsh and the German of Fuchs.

In the Jewish Quarterly Review, it proposes that this book influenced the development of Christianity:

==== Synopsis ====
After being banished from the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve go to the East and live there for eighteen years and two months. Eve gives birth to Cain and Abel. Eve dreams that Cain drinks the blood of Abel, but that it then came out of his mouth. Cain kills Abel. Michael promises to Adam a new son, and Seth is born &quot;in place of Abel&quot;. (chapters 1–4)

Adam begets 30 other sons and 30 daughters. As Adam falls sick and is in pain, all his sons and daughters come to him, and he briefly recounts to them the story of the Fall. Seth and Eve travel to the doors of the Garden to beg for some oil of the tree of mercy (i.e. the Tree of Life). On the way Seth is attacked and bitten by a wild beast, which goes away when ordered by Seth. Michael refuses to give them the oil at that time, but promises to give it at the end of time, when all flesh will be raised up, the delights of paradise will be given to the holy people and God will be in their midst. On their return, Adam says to Eve: &quot;What hast thou done? Thou hast brought upon us great wrath which is death.&quot; (chapters 5–14)

Eve recounts to her sons and daughters the story of the Fall from her point of view: in the Garden, she is separated from Adam. Eve stays with the female animals and Adam with the male ones. The devil persuades the male snake to rebel against Adam and his wife: at the hour the angels go up to worship the Lord, Satan disguises himself as an angel and speaks to Eve using the mouth of the serpent. The serpent seduces Eve, who swears to give the fruit to eat to Adam too. The serpent places in the fruit the poison of his wickedness, which is lust. When Eve eats it, she discovers that she is naked. All the trees of the Garden lose their leaves. Only a fig tree, the plant she ate of, still has leaves, and she hides her shame with its leaves. Eve looks for Adam and deceives him: he also eats the forbidden fruit. (chapters 15–21)

Michael sounds a trumpet, and God enters the Garden mounted on the chariot of his Cherubim and preceded by the angels. His throne is set where the Tree of Life is, and all the trees break out in blossoms. He calls Adam, who hid because he was naked, and reproaches Adam, Eve and the serpent (the order of the reproaches is the opposite to that of Genesis). When the angels are casting Adam out of paradise, he asks to be allowed to implore God, saying: &quot;For I alone have sinned.&quot; He begs God to be allowed to eat of the Tree of Life. God refuses to give him the fruit of immortality, but promises, if Adam will keep from all evil, to raise him up in the last day and give him the fruit. Before being cast out, Adam is allowed to take sweet spices (to offer sacrifices) and seeds for his food. (chapters 22–30)

Adam lies sick and foretells that Eve will die shortly after. He asks Eve to pray, because they do not know whether God is angry with them or merciful. While Eve is praying on bended knee, the &quot;angel of humanity&quot; (probably Michael) comes and shows her the spirit of Adam gone from his body and ascending to God. (chapters 31–32)

Chapters 33–41 narrate, with great richness of liturgical detail, the funeral of Adam. A chariot of light, borne by four bright eagles with Seraphim and angels, arrives where Adam&#x27;s body lies. The seven heavens are opened and Seth explains to his mother who are the two fearful figures in mourning: the sun and the moon, deprived of their light, because God is present. God has mercy on Adam, who is cleansed three times in water before being carried before God. God stretches out his arm, and hands Adam over to Michael to be carried to the third heaven until the last day. (chapters 33–37) The chariot and all the angels bear Adam&#x27;s body to the Garden and lay him on the earth. Only Seth can see the scene. The body is covered with linen clothes and fragrant oil is poured on it. The body of Abel also, which until then the earth had refused to receive, is taken to the same place. Both bodies are buried in the place from which God took the clay to create Adam. God calls Adam, whose body answers from the earth. God promises Adam that he and everyone of his seed will rise again. (chapters 38–41)

Six days later, Eve asks to be buried near Adam and dies praying to the Lord. Three angels bury Eve near Adam, and Michael tells Seth never to mourn on the Sabbath. (chapters 42–43)

=== Latin Life of Adam and Eve ===
The main edition of the Latin version (in Latin or ) is that of W. Meyer in 1878 based on manuscripts S, T, M of the 9th, 10th, and 12th centuries. Later, a new and extended edition was prepared by Mozley based mainly on manuscripts kept in England, of which the most important is manuscript A.

====Synopsis====
The story begins immediately after Adam and Eve&#x27;s banishment from the Garden of Eden and continues to their deaths. After being banished from the Garden of Eden, they go to the West and after six days they become hungry, but the only food they find is that for animals. They decide to do penance in order to ask mercy to the Lord and to return in the Garden. Adam explains to Eve how to do penance: he will stay forty-seven days immersed in the Jordan and Eve forty days in the icy Tigris. Adam enters in the Jordan and prays the Lord together with all the creatures of the river. (chapters 1–8)

Satan disguises himself as a bright angel and talks her out of it. Eve returns to Adam, who reproaches her. Eve lies prostrate with grief. Adam complains about Satan persecuting them, and Satan explains that he and his followers refused God&#x27;s command to worship both Adam, the image of the God, and God himself. Thus Satan with his angels were expelled from heaven, deprived of their glory and began to envy men. Adam, unaffected by the story, serves forty days of penance in the Jordan. (chapters 9–17) Eve is so grief-stricken that she leaves Adam and goes alone toward the West, lamenting and crying. When it is the time for her to give birth, she is alone. Adam reaches her and prays to the Lord: because of his prayer many angels arrive to help her in the delivery: Cain is born and immediately is able to run. They return east. Michael is sent by the Lord to teach Adam agriculture. (chapters 18–22)

Abel is born. Eve dreams that Cain drinks the blood of Abel. Adam and Eve make Cain a husbandman and Abel a shepherd in order to separate them from each other. However, Cain murders Abel (there is no trace of the common story found elsewhere that Cain and Abel had twin sisters, and Cain&#x27;s killing of Abel is passed over quickly). Seth is born &quot;in place of Abel&quot;, along with 30 other sons and 30 (or 32) daughters. (chapters 23–24). Cain and his twin sister Luluwa are born and Abel and his twin sister Aklia are born. &quot;As for Adam, he knew not again his wife Eve, all the days of his life; neither was any more offspring born of them; but only those five, Cain, Luluwa, Abel, Aklia,&quot; and Seth alone. Josephus in endnotes 8) &quot;The number of Adam&#x27;s children, as says the old tradition was thirty-three(33) sons, and twenty-three(23) daughters.&quot;

Adam recounts to Seth that, after the Fall, he was caught up into the Paradise of righteousness and saw a chariot with the Lord seated on it among angels (a merkabah). Adam worshipped the Lord, who promised him that knowledge will not be taken away from Adam&#x27;s seed for ever. Adam continues to recount briefly to Seth the history of the world up to last judgment (the Second Temple period is marked as a time of iniquity but the destruction of the Temple is not recounted). (chapters 25–29)

As Adam is dying, sick and in pain, he wants to bless all his sons and daughters, who do not know what illness and pain are. Adam recounts to them the story of the Fall. Seth and Eve travel to the gates of the Garden to beg for some oil of the Tree of Life. On the way Seth is attacked and bitten by the Serpent, which goes away when ordered by Seth. At the gates of the Garden, Michael refuses to give them the oil. On their return, Adam says to Eve: &quot;What hast thou done? A great plague hast thou brought upon us, transgression and sin for all our generations.&quot; (chapters 30–44)

Adam dies at the age of 930 and the sun, the moon and the stars are darkened for seven days. Adam&#x27;s soul is consigned to Michael till the day of Judgment, when his sorrow will be converted into joy. God and some angels bury his body and Abel&#x27;s. (chapters 45–49)

Eve perceives that she will die and assembles all her sons and daughters for her testament, predicting a double judgment of water (probably the deluge) and fire. Seth is charged to write on two tablets the life of his parents. (chapters 49–50) Six days later, Eve dies, and Michael tells Seth never to mourn on the Sabbath. (chapters 51)

Chapters 52–57 include various additional traditions: the tablets written by Seth about the lives of his parents are put in the place where Adam used to pray, that is Temple Mount. Only Salomon could read them. The entry of Adam into the Garden only forty days after his creation (eighty for Eve). The explanation of the eight parts of Adam&#x27;s body and the origin of the name &#x27;Adam&#x27;.

Only the plot of chapters 23–24, 30–49, 51 is in common with that of the Apocalypse of Moses, though with great differences in details. Chapters 15–30 (Eve&#x27;s Tale) of the Apocalypse of Moses have no parallel in the Latin Life of Adam and Eve. The penance of Adam and Eve in the water can be found also in the later Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan.

=== Slavonic Life of Adam and Eve ===
The Slavonic Adam book was published by Jagic along with a Latin translation in 1893. This version agrees for the most part with the Greek Apocalypse of Moses. It has, moreover, a section, §§ 28–39, which, though not found in the Greek text, is found in the Latin Life of Adam and Eve. It includes also some unique material.

=== Armenian Penitence of Adam ===
This Armenian version of the Life of Adam and Eve was first published in 1981 by Stone and is based on three manuscripts. It was probably translated into Armenian from Greek and takes its place alongside the Greek and Latin versions as a major witness to the Adam book. A different book is the Armenian Book of Adam, which closely follows the text of the Apocalypse of Moses.

The content of the Armenian Penitence of Adam includes both the penances in the rivers (not found in the Greek version) and Eve&#x27;s recounting of the Fall (not found in the Latin version).

=== Georgian Book of Adam ===
The Georgian Book of Adam is known from five manuscripts in two recensions. The earliest is a 15th- or 16th-century of the first recension. The others are three 17th-century copies of the first recension a sole 17th-century representative of the second recension. The Georgian and Armenian versions share a common &quot;Vorlage&quot;.

=== Coptic fragments ===
There are two fragments of a Coptic translation of the Greek Adam, one in the Sahidic dialect and another in Fayyumic. In 1975, O. H. E. Burmester reported a possible fragment of a Copto-Arabic version of the Life of Adam and Eve in the Hamburg University Library, but it has since gone missing.

== Modern editions ==

The &quot;Adam and Eve Archive&quot; is an ongoing project by Gary A. Anderson and Michael E. Stone to present all of the original texts in both the original languages and in translation. It contains English translations of the most important texts and a synopsis guide that allows the viewer to easily jump from a section in one source to parallel sections in other sources. Brian O. Murdoch produced a comparative study on the development of the western European medieval vernacular translations of the &quot;Vita Adae et Evae&quot; including glosses of quotations from the original texts.

<text>Zeuhl (pronounced [&#x27;zœl]; meaning &quot;Celestial&quot;) is a music genre that is a hybrid of jazz fusion, symphonic rock and neoclassical music, established in 1969 by the French band Magma. The term comes from Kobaïan, the fictional language created by Magma&#x27;s Christian Vander and Klaus Blasquiz for Magma, in which &quot;Zeuhl Ẁortz&quot; means approximately &quot;Celestial Force&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
The musical roots of zeuhl go back to pioneers of the free jazz movement such as John Coltrane and folkloristic echoes and influences from Carl Orff&#x27;s work.

Zeuhl is determined by several characteristic elements. Especially important are dominant rhythm fractions, usually in the form of a pumping bass guitar and sometimes sluggish or flexibly playing drum kits. Slow repetitive structures that serve to build a hypnotic atmosphere are just as prominent as solo passages of high technical finesse. Vocals are often widely present and can consist of polyphonic choral movements, such as Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, or soloistically performed passages with shrill intonation. Zeuhl bands also often have solo guitarists or pianist that usually have a more than accompanying function, especially to emphasize the repetitive patterns.

Dominique Leone, writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, says the style is: &quot;about what you&#x27;d expect an alien rock opera to sound like: massed, chanted choral motifs, martial, repetitive percussion, sudden bursts of explosive improv and just as unexpected lapses into eerie, minimalist trance-rock.&quot; He has said that it means celestial and that &quot;Zeuhl music means vibratory music&quot; and that zeuhl is &quot;L&#x27;esprit au travers de la matière&quot; (The spirit through matter). That is Zeuhl. Zeuhl is also the sound which you can feel vibrating in your belly. Pronounce the word Zeuhl very slowly, and stress the letter &quot;z&quot; at the beginning, and you will feel your body vibrating.&quot;

== Reception ==
Originally applied solely to the music of Magma, the term &quot;zeuhl&quot; was eventually used to describe the similar music produced by French bands beginning in the 1970s. In addition to Magma, bands who are associated with the term include: Happy Family, Kōenji Hyakkei, and Ruins from Japan, and French band Zao.

<text>Maranatha Baptist University is a private Baptist university in Watertown, Wisconsin.

==History==
The institution was founded in 1968 as Maranatha Baptist Bible College by B. Myron Cedarholm. The college was named for the Aramaic phrase &quot;Maranatha&quot;, which means &quot;Lo, He cometh&quot; (I Corinthians 16:22). Cedarholm helped raise $150,000 to purchase the Watertown campus, now valued at $18 million, from the Brothers of the Holy Cross located in South Bend, Indiana. Maranatha Baptist Bible College opened just three months later, on September 10, 1968, with 173 students and 27 faculty members. Maranatha awarded degrees to the first graduating class, 13 students, on May 31, 1969.

Maranatha was chartered by the State of Wisconsin in 1968 and accredited by the Higher Learning Commission in 1993. In 2013, the institution changed its name to Maranatha Baptist University.

The current president is David Anderson, who began his duties during the summer of 2023. Since 2021, Matthew Davis has functioned as the university&#x27;s CEO.

<doc id="604463" wikidata="Q11486474" url="?curid=604463" title="Adjournment">
<text>In parliamentary procedure, an adjournment ends a meeting. It could be done using a motion to adjourn. A time for another meeting could be set using the motion to fix the time to which to adjourn.

==Law==
In law, to adjourn means to suspend or postpone a proceeding.

==Parliamentary procedure==
In deliberative assemblies, an adjournment ends a meeting. Under &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; (RONR), if no time or method has been fixed to reconvene the assembly, the adjournment has the effect of dissolving the body.

=== Motion to adjourn ===
A motion to adjourn is a privileged motion, unless it is qualified in any way (such as &quot;adjourn at 10 p.m.&quot;), the time for adjourning is already established, or unless adjournment would dissolve the assembly (in these cases, it is a main motion). The privileged motion to adjourn is used to end the meeting immediately without debate. If it is a main motion, it cannot interrupt pending business, and is amendable and debatable.

If there is any unfinished business at the time of adjournment, it is carried over to the next meeting if that meeting is within a quarterly time interval. 

When a body has completed the scheduled order of business at a meeting and there is no further business for the assembly to consider at that time, the chair may simply declare the meeting adjourned without a motion having been made. 

Along with the motion to fix the time to which to adjourn, recess, and taking measures to obtain a quorum, it is one of the only motions allowed in the absence of a quorum.

The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure (TSC) treats the motion to adjourn as a privileged motion but under fewer circumstances. Like RONR, TSC considers it a privileged motion (and thus non-debatable) when business is pending. As a privileged motion, however, TSC allows the motion to be amended to a limited extent to establish the time when the interrupted meeting will continue. Unlike under RONR, however, it is considered a main motion (debatable and amendable) when no business is pending.

=== Motion to Fix the time to which to adjourn ===

The motion to fix the time to which to adjourn is used to set the time (and possibly the place) for another meeting to continue business of the session. If it is moved while a question is pending, it is the highest ranking privileged motion. Otherwise, it is an incidental main motion.

=== Adjourned meeting ===
An adjourned meeting is a term used in parliamentary procedure to mean a meeting that is continued from the previous meeting. The motion to fix the time to which to adjourn sets up an adjourned meeting, which is part of the same session (series of related meetings).

Despite the name, an adjourned meeting is not related to the act of adjourning (i.e. &quot;an adjourned meeting&quot; does not mean &quot;a meeting that has been adjourned&quot;). To reduce this confusion, an adjourned meeting is sometimes called a &quot;continued meeting&quot;.

An adjourned meeting is set up to complete the business of the assembly. After an adjourned meeting is scheduled, an item of business could be postponed to that meeting.

The adjourned meeting must be scheduled before the next regular meeting of the assembly.

== United States Congress ==
In the United States Congress, an adjournment of more than three days requires the consent of both houses (the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives).

=== Controversial adjournment ===
In March 1835, there was controversy on whether Congress could stay in session past the end of the term without adjourning. It was debated on whether the motion to adjourn was valid. Eventually there was an adjournment. This issue was resolved when the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution set a specific date and time for the start of a new session.

<doc id="604466" wikidata="Q15402042" url="?curid=604466" title="Northland Scholars Academy">
<text>Northland Scholars Academy (formerly Northland International University), is a college prep high school, formerly a college, in Dunbar, Wisconsin.

==History==

Northland Mission Camp (now Northland Camp and Conference Center)was founded on December 31, 1958, by Paul and Mamie Patz and Reverend Harold and Arlene Sailer. Sailer and his wife both graduated from Northwestern Bible College. Property for the facility in northeast Wisconsin was purchased in 1960. In 1976, Northland Bible Institute was started. The following year, it changed its name to Northland Baptist Bible College. On April 7, 2009, the school created the name Northland International University as a canopy name for its four entities: Northland Baptist Bible College, Northland Graduate Studies, Northland Center for Global Opportunities, and Northland Online. Northland Camp and Conference Center and Northland International University are branches of Northland Mission, Inc.

For much of its history, Northland operated without accreditation, which meant that its students were not eligible for government financial assistance. In 2004, Northland obtained provisional accreditation from the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS), making its students eligible for federal funds. TRACS granted full accreditation in 2008.

In 2009, Northland requested inclusion in the Wisconsin Tuition Grant Program, so that undergraduate students from Wisconsin attending Northland could receive state financial assistance. In August 2009, the Wisconsin Higher Education System determined that Northland students were not eligible for state financial aid because the college&#x27;s accreditation was not from a regional accreditation organization. Northland appealed the ruling to agency&#x27;s board, citing TRACS&#x27; federal government recognition. A decision was expected in the fall of 2009, but students were not eligible for state aid for the 2009-2010 school year.

Northland was approved for participation in Wisconsin Tuition Grant program for the 2011–12 school year. The program was later renamed the Wisconsin Grant program beginning with the 2014–15 school year. Northland students eligible for the grant received it through the end of the 2014–15 school year, when the college ceased academic operations. 

In 2018, it became a non-confessional college preparatory program under the name of Northland Scholars Academy. Students there can get associates degrees through an arrangement with Bay de Noc Community College of Escanaba, Michigan.

===Leadership changes===
On April 29, 2013, then-president Matthew Olson announced to all faculty, staff and students that he had been removed as president by the board. On May 8, the four board members that were not members of the founding family resigned. The remaining three board members voted to bring Olson back on as president, and on May 22, 2013 voted to install Daniel Patz as the new chairman of the board. A month later, On June 13, 2013, Olson announced to faculty and staff that he had resigned. He indicated that this would give the board the best opportunity to move forward and to succeed. On June 17 and 18, a board advisory council convened, and Mr. Daniel Patz was appointed as the university&#x27;s fourth president.

===Closure===
In October 2014, Northland announced that the board of trustees of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary had decided to accept the university&#x27;s assets and campus as a gift and to establish an extension of Southern&#x27;s Boyce college at the campus. However, on April 22, 2015, President Patz announced that The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary had reversed their previous decision and no longer intended to acquire Northland&#x27;s campus. Following a meeting of the Northland Board of Trustees, Patz communicated the board&#x27;s decision to close both the graduate and undergraduate schools of the university following the end of the 2014-2015 school year. Although the education branches of Northland Mission were closed, the Camp and Conference Center remain open, offering a variety of summer camps, and various youth, family, and ministerial retreats during the school year.

Northland International University ceased academic operations in 2015. Lancaster Bible College became the custodian of student academic records (transcripts). Several recordings made by the Northland Baptist Bible College Choir, such as &quot;A Heart to Praise&quot; and &quot;Holy is He&quot;, remain available.

===Reopening===
The reopening of the school took place in 2018 as the Northland Scholars Academy.

===List of presidents===
==Campus==

Northland&#x27;s 435 acre campus is located approximately 6 miles southeast of Dunbar, Wisconsin. The main classroom buildings are the Founder&#x27;s Center, named in honor of the school&#x27;s founder, Paul Patz; and the Jacquot Educational Center (JEC), named in honor of former dean Ardell Jacquot. The Founder&#x27;s Center also housed the administrative offices, registrar&#x27;s office, and business office of the university. The university library, which houses over 50,000 volumes, is located in the JEC. The campus also has a fine arts center where music classes and performances were held.

==Athletics==
Northland&#x27;s intercollegiate sports mascot was the Pioneer.The school was a Division II member of the National Christian College Athletic Association, and has competed in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross-country, men&#x27;s golf, and women&#x27;s volleyball. Men&#x27;s hockey and men&#x27;s volleyball competed as athletic clubs not under the sanction of the NCCAA. Men&#x27;s soccer and men&#x27;s cross-country were traditionally Northland&#x27;s strongest sports; as the soccer team won over ten regional championships in addition to several national championships. Their 2012 season ended with a loss in the national championship game to Moody Bible Institute, and in 2013 they earned a top three at-large bid in the national championship tournament. The cross-country teams earned four national titles in five years (2001–2003, 2005), and finished as the runner-up in 2006.

<doc id="604474" wikidata="Q1343169" url="?curid=604474" title="Frank J. Sprague">
<text>Frank Julian Sprague (July 25, 1857 – October 25, 1934) was an American inventor who contributed to the development of the electric motor, electric railways, and electric elevators. His contributions were especially important in promoting urban development by increasing the size cities could reasonably attain (through better transportation) and by allowing greater concentration of business in commercial sections (through use of electric elevators in skyscrapers). He became known as the &quot;father of electric traction&quot;. Demonstrating an aptitude for science and mathematics, Sprague secured an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1874 and, after graduation in 1878 and 2 years at sea, resigned to pursue his career in electrical engineering.

==Early life and education==
Sprague was born in Milford, Connecticut, in 1857 to David Cummings Sprague and Frances Julia King Sprague, a school teacher His mother died when he was ten, and was sent by his father to live with an aunt in New York. He attended Drury High School in North Adams, Massachusetts, and excelled in mathematics. After graduating high school, Sprague went to Springfield, Massachusetts, to take an entrance exam for West Point, but somehow unexpectedly was taking the four day entrance exam for the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He got the highest score (twelve others took the exam), and to go to the school he needed to borrow money. A local contractor and a bank loaned him four thousand dollars, and he travelled to Maryland. There, he graduated seventh (out of thirty-six) in the class of 1878.

==Career==
===United States Navy, inventor===

He was commissioned as an ensign in the United States Navy. During his ensuing naval service, he first served on the USS &quot;Richmond&quot;, then the USS &quot;Minnesota&quot;. While in Asia, Sprague wrote stories he filed for the Boston Herald. While his ship was in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1881, Sprague invented the inverted type of dynamo. After he was transferred to the USS &quot;Lancaster&quot;, the flagship of the European Squadron, he installed the first electric call-bell system on a United States Navy ship. Sprague took leave to attend the International Exposition of Electricity of 1881 in Paris and the Crystal Palace Exhibition in Sydenham, England, in 1882, where he was on the jury of awards for gas engines, dynamos and lamps.

===Engineer for Edison===
In 1883, Edward H. Johnson, a business associate of Thomas Edison, persuaded Sprague to resign his naval commission to work for Edison. Sprague, who began at a salary of $2,500, was neither happy with his salary nor his assignments. Sprague wanted to focus on motors, while motors bored Edison, who was consumed in making his incandescent lighting work. Edison sent Sprague to run the construction departments where Edison had built central power stations for his lighting systems in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, and Brockton, Massachusetts.

Sprague did important work for Edison, including correcting Edison&#x27;s system of mains and feeders for central station distribution.

In 1884, he decided his interests in the exploitation of electricity lay elsewhere, and he left Edison to found the Sprague Electric Railway &amp; Motor Company.

===Electrical pioneer===
By 1886, Sprague&#x27;s company had introduced two important inventions: a constant-speed, non-sparking motor with fixed brushes, and regenerative braking, a method of braking that uses the drive motor to return power to the main supply system. His motor was the first to maintain constant speed under varying load. It was immediately popular and was endorsed by Edison as the only practical electric motor available. His regenerative braking system was important in the development of the electric train and the electric elevator.

===Electric streetcars===
Sprague&#x27;s inventions included several improvements to designs for systems of electric streetcars collecting electricity from overhead lines. He improved designs for a spring-loaded trolley pole that had been developed in 1885 by Charles Van Depoele, devised a greatly improved mounting for streetcar motors and better gear designs, and proved that regenerative braking was practical. After testing his trolley system in late 1887 and early 1888, Sprague installed the first successful large electric street railway system – the Richmond Union Passenger Railway in Richmond, Virginia, which began passenger operation on February 2, 1888. Long a transportation obstacle, the hills of Richmond included grades of over 10%, and were an excellent proving ground for acceptance of his new technology in other cities, in contrast to the cable cars which climbed the steepest grades of Nob Hill in San Francisco at the time.

By the summer of 1888, Henry M. Whitney of the West End Street Railway in Boston had witnessed the simultaneous startup of multiple streetcars on a single power source and had signed up for conversion. By January 1889, Boston had its first electric streetcars – which would be the first in the Americas to go underground, some eight years later, as the Tremont Street Subway – and which had become so popular and noteworthy that poet Oliver Wendell Holmes composed a verse about the new trolley pole technology, and the sparking contact shoe at its apex:
:Since then on many a car you&#x27;ll see
:A broomstick as plain as plain can be;
:On every stick there&#x27;s a witch astride—
:The string you see to her leg is tied.
Within a year, electric power had started to replace more costly horsecars in many cities. By 1889, 110 electric railways incorporating Sprague&#x27;s equipment had been begun or planned on several continents. In 1890, Edison, who manufactured most of Sprague&#x27;s equipment, bought him out, and Sprague turned his attention to electric elevators. However, he continued to be interested in the use of electricity for urban transportation and proposed a major expansion of London&#x27;s Underground in 1901.

Sprague&#x27;s system of electric supply was a great advantage in relation to the first bipolar U-tube overhead lines, in everyday use since 1883 on the Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram.

===Electric elevators===
While electrifying the streetcars of Richmond, the increased passenger capacity and speed gave Sprague the notion that similar results could be achieved in vertical transportation — electric elevators. He saw that increasing the capacity of elevator shafts would not only save passengers&#x27; time but would also increase the earnings of tall buildings, with height limited by the total floor space taken up in the shaftways by slow hydraulic-powered elevators.

In 1892, Sprague founded the Sprague Electric Elevator Company. Working with Charles R. Pratt he developed the Sprague-Pratt Electric Elevator, the first of which was installed in the Postal Telegraph Building in 1894. The company developed floor control, automatic elevators, acceleration control of car safeties, and a number of freight elevators. The Sprague-Pratt elevator ran faster and with larger loads than hydraulic or steam elevators, and 584 elevators had been installed worldwide. Sprague sold his company to the Otis Elevator Company in 1895.
===Multiple unit train controls===
Sprague&#x27;s experience with electric elevators lead him to devise a multiple unit system of electric railway operation, which accelerated the development of electric traction. In the multiple-unit system, each car of the train carries electric traction motors. By means of relays energized by train-line wires, the engineer (or motorman) commands all of the traction motors in the train to act together. For lighter trains there is no need for locomotives, so every car in the train can generate revenue. Where locomotives are used, one person can control all of them.

Sprague&#x27;s first multiple unit order was from the South Side Elevated Railroad (the first of several elevated railways locally known as the &quot;L&quot;) in Chicago, Illinois. This success was quickly followed by substantial multiple-unit contracts in Brooklyn, New York, and Boston, Massachusetts.

===New York: Grand Central, elevators in skyscrapers===
From 1896 to 1900 Sprague served on the Commission for Terminal Electrification of the New York Central Railroad, including the Grand Central Station in New York City, where he designed a system of automatic train control to ensure compliance with trackside signals. He founded the Sprague Safety Control &amp; Signal Corporation to develop and build this system. Along with William J. Wilgus, he designed the Wilgus-Sprague bottom contact third rail system used by the railroads leading into Grand Central Terminal.

During World War I, Sprague served on the Naval Consulting Board. Then, in the 1920s, he devised a method for safely running two independent elevators, local and express, in a single shaft, to conserve floor space. He sold this system, along with systems for activating elevator car safety systems when acceleration or speed became too great, to the Westinghouse Company.

==Legacy==
Sprague&#x27;s developments in electric traction let cities grow larger, while his development of the elevator permitted greater concentration in their commercial sections and increased the profitability of commercial buildings. Sprague&#x27;s inventions made modern light rail and rapid transit systems possible, which today still function on the same principles.

The iconic Sprague-Thomson rolling stock of the Paris Métro, in service from 1908 to 1983, are still referred to as (&quot;Sprague trainsets&quot;) today.

Sprague&#x27;s engines were used as far afield as Sydney Harbour in Australia. A five-horsepower Lundell electric motor used at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard between 1900 and 1980 is now in the collection of the National Museum of Australia in Canberra.

==Awards and recognition==
Sprague was awarded the gold medal In Paris at the International Exposition of Electricity in 1889, the grand prize at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904, the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1904, and the Edison Medal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), for &quot;meritorious achievement in electrical science, engineering and arts as exemplified in his contributions thereto&quot; in 1910.

In addition, he received the Franklin Medal in 1921 and was posthumously awarded the John Fritz Gold Medal in 1935.

==Personal life==
Sprague was twice married, first to a Mary Keatinge, and thereafter to Harriet Chapman Jones. Frank and Mary had one son, Frank Desmond. Frank and Harriet had two sons and a daughter: Robert C. Sprague (also an inventor), Julian K. and Frances A. Remembering his father, Robert wrote in 1935:

Sprague died on October 25, 1934. He was buried with full U.S. Navy honors at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. His wife Harriet was interred with him after her death in 1969. After Sprague&#x27;s death, Harriet turned over a substantial amount of material from his collection to the New York Public Library, where it remains today accessible to the public via the rare books division. Other papers, including six volumes of congratulatory letters and photographs presented to Sprague on the occasion of his 75th birthday, are held at the Chapin Library, Williams College.

In 1959, Harriet Sprague donated funds for the Sprague Building at the Shore Line Trolley Museum at East Haven, Connecticut, not far from Sprague&#x27;s boyhood home in Milford. The museum is the oldest operating trolley museum in the United States and has one of the largest collections of trolley artifacts in the United States.

Frank&#x27;s son Robert C. Sprague would go on to found and lead the Sprague Electric Company as its president (1926–1953) and CEO (1953–1987). At its peak, Sprague Electric employed 12,000 people worldwide with plants in Scotland, France, Italy, and Japan, in addition to multiple locations in the United States, to become a leading manufacturer of capacitors and other electronic components. Sprague Electric was eventually acquired by General Cable in 1979 and then Vishay Intertechnology in 1992.

Frank and Harriet&#x27;s grandson Peter Sprague, an entrepreneur, would become CEO of National Semiconductor (1965–1995).

==Tributes==

In 1999, grandsons, John L. Sprague and Peter Sprague cut the ribbon and started an 1884 Sprague motor at a new exhibit at the Shore Line Trolley Museum, where a permanent exhibit, &quot;Frank J. Sprague: Inventor, Scientist, Engineer&quot;, tells the story of the role of the &quot;father of electric traction&quot; and the role of electricity in the growth of cities.

In 2012, the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum adopted a stray cat, naming it after Sprague: Frank the Trolley Cat.

==In popular culture==
In 2017, Sprague was the subject of an episode on season 29 of &quot;American Experience&quot;, a documentary series that was broadcast on PBS television stations. Titled &quot;The Race Underground&quot;, it partly chronicled the beginnings of the Boston-area MBTA&#x27;s streetcar network, and described Sprague as &quot;The Forgotten Hero of the American Subway&quot;.

<doc id="604477" wikidata="Q241062" url="?curid=604477" title="Tegla Loroupe">
<text>Tegla Chepkite Loroupe (born 9 May 1973) is a former Kenyan long-distance track and road runner. She is also a global spokeswoman for peace, women&#x27;s rights and education. Loroupe holds the world records for 25 and 30 kilometers and previously held the world marathon record. She was the first African woman to hold the marathon World Record, which she held from 19 April 1998 until 30 September 2001. She is the three-time World Half-Marathon champion. Loroupe was also the first woman from Africa to win the New York City Marathon, which she has won twice. She has won marathons in London, Rotterdam, Hong Kong, Berlin and Rome.

In 2016, she was the person organizing the Refugee Team for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio.

==Biography==
Tegla Loroupe was born in Kapsait village in the Lelan division of West Pokot District. It is situated in the Great Rift Valley, approximately 600 kilometres north of Nairobi. Her father and mother are from the Pokot tribe, a Nilotic ethnic group inhabiting parts of northern Kenya, eastern Uganda and southern Ethiopia.

Loroupe was told by her father that she was useless and her career might be babysitting. She grew up with 24 siblings. The Pokots being a polygamous culture, her father had four wives. She spent her childhood working fields, tending cattle and looking after younger brothers and sisters.

At the age of six, Loroupe started school at Kapsait Elementary school; she had to run ten kilometers to and from school every morning. At school, she became aware of her potential as an athlete when she won races held over a distance of 800 or 1500 meters against much older students. She decided to pursue a career as a runner. However, she was not supported by anyone but her mother.

The Kenyan athletics federation, Athletics Kenya, did not support her at first, thinking Loroupe too small and too thin. However, after she won a prestigious cross country barefoot race in 1988, this changed. She began to train to compete internationally the following year, earning her first pair of running shoes in 1989, which she wore only for particularly rough races. She was nominated for the junior race of the 1989 IAAF World Cross Country Championships finishing 28th. She competed again at the 1990 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, finishing 16th in the junior race.

In 1994 and 1998, Loroupe won the Goodwill Games over 10,000 metres, barefoot. Over the same distance she won bronze medals at the World Athletics Championships in 1995 and 1999.

In 1994, Loroupe ran her first major marathon in New York. Running against the world&#x27;s strongest competition, she won. As a consequence she was idolised by many young people in Africa: at last, a woman champion to complement the many successful male runners. She won the New York City Marathon again in 1995 and finished 3rd in 1998.

Between 1997 and 1999, she won three world titles a row over the half marathon distance. She won Rotterdam Marathon three times between 1997 and 1999. She won Berlin Marathon in 1999 and finished second in 2001. She finished second at the 1999 Osaka International Ladies Marathon.
Loroupe won the Zevenheuvelenloop 15K race in the Netherland three times (1992, 1993 and 1998).
She is a seven-time Egmond Half Marathon winner (1993–1998, 2000). She has won the Lisbon Half Marathon a record six times: 1994–1997, 1999 and 2000. She has won the Tilburg road race, a five times (1993, 1994, 1996, 1998, 1999), also a record number. She won the Paris Half Marathon in 1994 and 1998, City-Pier-City Loop half marathon in the Hague in 1998, and the Parelloop 10K in race in the Netherlands in 1999.

During the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, favoured to win both the marathon and the 10,000 meters, she suffered from violent food poisoning the night before the race. Nevertheless, she fought through the marathon race, finishing 13th, then, the next day, ran the 10,000 metres, finishing 5th, running barefoot in both races, a feat she later stated she achieved out of a sense of duty to all the people taking her as a bearer of hope in her home country. Until the end of 2001, she continued to suffer from various health problems.

In 2000, she won London Marathon and Rome City Marathon. She also won Lausanne Marathon in 2002, Cologne Marathon in 2003 and Leipzig Marathon in 2004.

Loroupe competed at the 2005 World Championships marathon race in Helsinki, Finland, but finished only 40th. In February 2006 she won the Hong Kong Half-Marathon. The same year she finished 5th in the Rotterdam Marathon and 2nd in the Venice Marathon. In 2007, she participated again the New York City Marathon, finishing 8th.

Loroupe&#x27;s biggest successes include world records over 20, 25 and 30 kilometers as well as the past record over the marathon distance. She used to hold the One Hour running World record of 18,340 m set in Borgholzhausen, Germany, but the record was broken by Dire Tune of Ethiopia ten years later, in 2008 (new record 18,517 m).

In 2006, she was named a United Nations Ambassador of Sport by Secretary General Kofi Annan, together with Roger Federer, tennis champion from Switzerland, Elias Figueroa, Latin American soccer legend from Chile, and Katrina Webb paralympics gold medalist from Australia. She is an International Sports Ambassador for the IAAF, the International Association of Athletics Federations, and for UNICEF.

In 2003, Loroupe created an annual series of Peace Marathons sponsored by the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation &quot;Peace Through Sports&quot;. Presidents, Prime Ministers, Ambassadors and government officials run with warriors and nomadic groups in her native Kenya, in Uganda and in Sudan, to bring peace to an area plagued by raiding warriors from battling tribes. In 2010 the Kenyan Government lauded her achievements as hundreds of warriors had laid down their weapons.

She has established a school (Tegla Loroupe Peace Academy) and orphanage for children from the region in Kapenguria, a high-mountain town in north-west Kenya.

The 2006 Peace Marathon was held on 18 November 2006, in Kapenguria, Kenya. Two thousand warriors from six tribes competed. The next Peace Marathon was 15 November 2008 in Kapenguria, Kenya. National ambassadors to Kenya participated, together with the Prime Minister, and several Kenyan, Tanzanian, and Ugandan Ministers. The Peace Marathon has been held each year since then, with the exception of the past two Covid years. Winners of the races often begin professional training in long-distance running, or join the training team of ex-warriors.

In February 2007, she was named the Oxfam Ambassador of Sport and Peace to Darfur. In December 2006, she travelled with George Clooney, Joey Cheek, and Don Cheadle to Beijing, Cairo, and New York on a diplomatic mission to bring an end to violence in Darfur. She won the &quot;Community Hero&quot; category at the 2007 Kenyan Sports Personality of the Year awards.

In November 2009, Tegla represented the Shoe4Africa team. running the New York Marathon alongside founder Toby Tanser and actress Sarah Jones finishing in 3:54:02.

Loroupe is a member of the &#x27;Champions for Peace&#x27; club, a group of 54 famous elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport, created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organisation.

As reported by Olympic news outlet Around the Rings, the IOC recognised six women, five from each continent and one to represent the world, for their achievements and their work to promote women&#x27;s sport. Loroupe was awarded the world trophy.

In 2015 Loroupe became an Ambassador for the Homeless World Cup.

In 2016, she was the Chef de Mission organizing the Refugee Team for the 2016 Summer Olympics. At those games Loroupe was inducted into the Olympians for life project for her work in promoting peace. In October 2016 Loroupe was awarded United Nations Person of the Year.

<doc id="604486" wikidata="Q8354340" url="?curid=604486" title="Environmental impact statement">
<text>An environmental impact statement (EIS), under United States environmental law, is a document required by the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for certain actions &quot;significantly affecting the quality of the human environment&quot;. An EIS is a tool for decision making. It describes the positive and negative environmental effects of a proposed action, and it usually also lists one or more alternative actions that may be chosen instead of the action described in the EIS. One of the primary authors of the act is Lynton K. Caldwell.

Preliminary versions of these documents are officially known as a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) or draft environmental impact report (DEIR).

==Purpose==
The purpose of the NEPA is to promote informed decision-making by federal agencies by making &quot;detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts&quot; available to both agency leaders and the public. The NEPA was the first piece of legislation that created a comprehensive method to assess potential and existing environmental risks at once. It also encourages communication and cooperation between all the actors involved in environmental decisions, including government officials, private businesses, and citizens.

In particular, an EIS acts as an enforcement mechanism to ensure that the federal government adheres to the goals and policies outlined in the NEPA. An EIS should be created in a timely manner as soon as the agency is planning development or is presented with a proposal for development. The statement should use an interdisciplinary approach so that it accurately assesses both the physical and social impacts of the proposed development. In many instances an action may be deemed subject to NEPA&#x27;s EIS requirement even though the action is not specifically sponsored by a federal agency. These factors may include actions that receive federal funding, federal licensing or authorization, or that are subject to federal control.

Not all federal actions require a full EIS. If the action may or may not cause a significant impact, the agency can first prepare a smaller, shorter document called an Environmental Assessment (EA). The finding of the EA determines whether an EIS is required. If the EA indicates that no significant impact is likely, then the agency can release a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and carry on with the proposed action. Otherwise, the agency must then conduct a full-scale EIS. Most EAs result in a FONSI. A limited number of federal actions may avoid the EA and EIS requirements under NEPA if they meet the criteria for a categorical exclusion (CATEX). A CATEX is usually permitted when a course of action is identical or very similar to a past course of action and the impacts on the environment from the previous action can be assumed for the proposed action, or for building a structure within the footprint of an existing, larger facility or complex. For example, two recently completed sections of Interstate 69 in Kentucky were granted a CATEX from NEPA requirements as these portions of I-69 utilize existing freeways that required little more than minor spot improvements and a change of highway signage. Additionally, a CATEX can be issued during an emergency when time does not permit the preparation of an EA or EIS. An example of the latter is when the Federal Highway Administration issued a CATEX to construct the replacement bridge in the wake of the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge Collapse.

NEPA does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees/permittees from harming the environment, instead it requires that the prospective impacts be understood and disclosed in advance. The intent of NEPA is to help key decisionmakers and stakeholders balance the need to implement an action with its impacts on the surrounding human and natural environment, and provide opportunities for mitigating those impacts while keeping the cost and schedule for implementing the action under control. However, many activities require various federal permits to comply with other environmental legislation, such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and Section 4(f) of the Federal Highway Act to name a few. Similarly, many states and local jurisdictions have enacted environmental laws and ordinances, requiring additional state and local permits before the action can proceed. Obtaining these permits typically requires the lead agency to implement the Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA) to comply with federal, state, and local environmental laws that are ancillary to NEPA. In some instances, the result of NEPA analysis leads to abandonment or cancellation of the proposed action, particularly when the &quot;No Action&quot; alternative ends up being the LEDPA.

==Layout==
An EIS typically has four sections:
:* An Introduction including a statement of the Purpose and Need of the Proposed Action.
:* A description of the Affected Environment.
:* A Range of Alternatives to the proposed action. Alternatives are considered the &quot;heart&quot; of the EIS.
:* An analysis of the environmental impacts of each of the possible alternatives. This section covers topics such as:
::* Impacts to threatened or endangered species
::* Air and water quality impacts
::* Impacts to historic and cultural sites, particularly sites of significant importance to indigenous peoples. 
::* Social and economic impacts to local communities, often including consideration of attributes such as impacts on the available housing stock, economic impacts to businesses, property values, public health, aesthetics and noise within the affected area
::* Cost and Schedule Analyses for each alternative, including costs and timeline to mitigate expected impacts, to determine if the proposed action can be completed at an acceptable cost and within a reasonable amount of time 
While not required in the EIS, the following subjects may be included as part of the EIS or as separate documents based on agency policy.
:* Financial Plan for the proposed action identifying the sources of secured funding for the action. For example, the Federal Highway Administration has started requiring states to include a financial plan showing that funding has been secured for major highway projects before it will approve an EIS and issue a Record of Decision.
:* An Environmental mitigation plan is often requested by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) if substantial environmental impacts are expected from the preferred alternative.
:* Additional documentation to comply with state and local environmental policy laws and secure required federal, state, and local permits before the action can proceed.

Every EIS is required to analyze a No Action Alternative, in addition to the range of alternatives presented for study. The No Action Alternative identifies the expected environmental impacts in the future if existing conditions were left as is with no action taken by the lead agency. Analysis of the No Action Alternative is used to establish a baseline upon which to compare the proposed &quot;Action&quot; alternatives. Contrary to popular belief, the &quot;No Action Alternative&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that nothing will occur if that option is selected in the Record of Decision. For example, the &quot;No Action Alternative&quot; was selected for the I-69/Trans-Texas Corridor Tier-I Environmental Impact Statement. In that Record of Decision, the Texas Department of Transportation opted not to proceed with building its portion of I-69 as one of the Trans-Texas Corridors to be built as a new-terrain route (the Trans-Texas Corridor concept was ultimately scrapped entirely), but instead decided to proceed with converting existing US and state routes to I-69 by upgrading those roads to interstate standards.

==NEPA process==
The NEPA process is designed to involve the public and gather the best available information in a single place so that decision makers can be fully informed when they make their choices.

This is the process of EIS
* Proposal: In this stage, the needs and objectives of a project have been decided, but the project has not been financed.
* Categorical Exclusion (CATEX): As discussed above, the government may exempt an agency from the process. The agency can then proceed with the project and skip the remaining steps.
* Environmental Assessment (EA): The proposal is analyzed in addition to the local environment with the aim to reduce the negative impacts of the development on the area.
* Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI): Occurs when no significant impacts are identified in an EA. A FONSI typically allows the lead agency to proceed without having to complete an EIS.

&quot;Environmental Impact Statement&quot;
* Scoping: The first meetings are held to discuss existing laws, the available information, and the research needed. The tasks are divided up and a lead group is selected. Decision makers and all those involved with the project can attend the meetings.
* Notice: The public is notified that the agency is preparing an EIS. The agency also provides the public with information regarding how they can become involved in the process. The agency announces its project proposal with a notice in the Federal Register, notices in local media, and letters to citizens and groups that it knows are likely to be interested. Citizens and groups are welcome to send in comments helping the agency identify the issues it must address in the EIS (or EA).
* Draft EIS (DEIS): Based on both agency expertise and issues raised by the public, the agency prepares a Draft EIS with a full description of the affected environment, a reasonable range of alternatives, and an analysis of the impacts of each alternative.
* Comment: Affected individuals then have the opportunity to provide feedback through written and public hearing statements.
* Final EIS (FEIS) and Proposed Action: Based on the comments on the Draft EIS, the agency writes a Final EIS, and announces its Proposed Action. The public is not invited to comment on this, but if they are still unhappy, or feel that the agency has missed a major issue, they may protest the EIS to the Director of the agency. The Director may either ask the agency to revise the EIS, or explain to the protester why their complaints are not actually taken care of.
*Re-evaluation: Prepared following an approved FEIS or ROD when unforeseen changes to the proposed action or its impacts occurs, or when a substantial period of time has passed between approval of an action and the planned start of said action. Based on the significance of the changes, three outcomes may result from a re-evaluation report: (1) the action may proceed with no substantive changes to the FEIS, (2) significant impacts are expected with the change that can be adequately addressed in a Supplemental EIS (SEIS), or (3) the circumstances force a complete change in the nature and scope of the proposed action, thereby voiding the pre-existing FEIS (and ROD, if applicable), requiring the lead agency to restart the NEPA process and prepare a new EIS to encompass the changes.
* Supplemental EIS (SEIS): Typically prepared after either a Final EIS or Record of Decision has been issued and new environmental impacts that were not considered in the original EIS are discovered, requiring the lead agency to re-evaluate its initial decision and consider new alternatives to avoid or mitigate the new impacts. Supplemental EISs are also prepared when the size and scope of a federal action changes, when a significant period of time has lapsed since the FEIS was completed to account for changes in the surrounding environment during that time, or when all of the proposed alternatives in an EIS are deemed to have unacceptable environmental impacts and new alternatives are proposed.
* Record of Decision (ROD): Once all the protests are resolved the agency issues a Record of Decision which is its final action prior to implementation. If members of the public are still dissatisfied with the outcome, they may sue the agency in Federal court.

Often, the agencies responsible for preparing an EA or EIS do not compile the document directly, but outsource this work to private-sector consulting firms with expertise in the proposed action and its anticipated effects on the environment. Because of the intense level of detail required in analyzing the alternatives presented in an EIS or EA, such documents may take years or even decades to compile, and often compose of multiple volumes that can be thousands to tens of thousands of pages in length.

To avoid potential conflicts in securing required permits and approvals after the ROD is issued, the lead agency will often coordinate with stakeholders at all levels, and resolve any conflicts to the greatest extent possible during the EIS process. Proceeding in this fashion helps avoid interagency conflicts and potential lawsuits after the lead agency reaches its decision.

===Tiering===
On exceptionally large projects, especially proposed highway, railroad, and utility corridors that cross long distances, the lead agency may use a two-tiered process prior to implementing the proposed action. In such cases, the Tier I EIS would analyze the potential socio-environmental impacts along a general corridor, but would not identify the exact location of where the action would occur. A Tier I ROD would be issued approving the general area where the action would be implemented. Following the Tier I ROD, the approved Tier I area is further broken down into subareas, and a Tier II EIS is then prepared for each subarea, that identifies the exact location of where the proposed action will take place. The preparation of Tier II EISs for each subarea proceeds at its own pace, independent from the other subareas within the Tier I area. For example, parts of the proposed Interstate 69 extension in Indiana and Texas, as well as portions of the Interstate 11 corridor in Nevada and Arizona are being studied through a two-tiered process

==Strengths==
By requiring agencies to complete an EIS, the act encourages them to consider the environmental costs of a project and introduces new information into the decision-making process. The NEPA has increased the influence of environmental analysts and agencies in the federal government by increasing their involvement in the development process. Because an EIS requires expert skill and knowledge, agencies must hire environmental analysts. Unlike agencies who may have other priorities, analysts are often sympathetic to environmental issues. In addition, this feature introduces scientific procedures into the political process.

==Limitations==
The differences that exist between science and politics limit the accuracy of an EIS. Although analysts are members of the scientific community, they are affected by the political atmosphere. Analysts do not have the luxury of an unlimited time for research. They are also affected by the different motives behind the research of the EIS and by different perspectives of what constitutes a good analysis. In addition, government officials do not want to reveal an environmental problem from within their own agency.

Citizens often misunderstand the environmental assessment process. The public does not realize that the process is only meant to gather information relevant to the decision. Even if the statement predicts negative impacts of the project, decision makers can still proceed with the proposal.

<doc id="604488" wikidata="Q2268605" url="?curid=604488" title="Days of Purgatory">
<text>Days of Purgatory is an album by American heavy metal band Iced Earth, released on June 6, 1997. It is a collection of remixes and remakes from previous albums, with the exception of their then-recent record &quot;The Dark Saga&quot;. Most of the songs from the &quot;Enter the Realm&quot; EP, &quot;Iced Earth&quot;, and &quot;Night of the Stormrider&quot; were re-sung by Matt Barlow, and on some of the songs the drums and bass were redone. The 2-CD version also has rough mixes of several songs from &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; with the opening to the title track re-recorded. The album cover features artwork of the Chaos Comics character Purgatori.

The reason for the album was to improve the original songs, create nostalgia for older fans and introduce newer fans to Iced Earth&#x27;s older work. The 2-CD limited edition was originally produced for European audiences but has since been released in the United States. &quot;Days of Purgatory&quot; was the last new release from the band featuring longtime guitarist Randall Shawver, and the first to feature bassist James MacDonough and drummer Brent Smedley.

The song &quot;Written on the Walls&quot; from the band&#x27;s self-titled album was given completely new lyrics and renamed &quot;Cast in Stone&quot;. The only songs left unrecorded from the band&#x27;s first albums were &quot;Mystical End&quot;, &quot;The Path I Choose&quot;, and &quot;Curse the Sky&quot;, though the latter two were both performed live with Barlow on vocals. &quot;Winter Nights&quot; was recorded during early sessions for &quot;Night of the Stormrider&quot; while Gene Adam was still on vocals, but this was the track which prompted Schaffer to ask Adam to get singing lessons, as it was felt he could not handle the high notes. Therefore, the song was not used on the album due to its acrimonious history, though it would have fit in with the storyline of the album. Live performances of this song from that era (such as Wuppertal &#x27;91) show him struggling to sing it, probably contributing to his dismissal. Schaffer eventually dug the song out of the vaults to use on this album with Barlow providing vocals, but, as mentioned in the album&#x27;s booklet, used a 1986 Purgatory demo for the backing track instead.

<doc id="604495" wikidata="Q7043658" url="?curid=604495" title="No. 5 Squadron RAF">
<text>Number 5 (Army Co-operation) Squadron (although His Majesty the King awarded No. V (Army Cooperation) Squadron) was a squadron of the Royal Air Force. It most recently operated the Raytheon Sentinel R1 Airborne STand-Off Radar (ASTOR) aircraft from RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, between April 2004 until March 2021.

First formed in July 1913, the squadron served throughout the First World War, holding the distinction of gaining the first loss and kill for the Royal Flying Corps. No. V Squadron relocated to India in 1920 where it remained during the Second World War. During the Cold War, No. 5 (Fighter) Squadron flew the English Electric Lightning and Panavia Tornado F3.

==History==
===Formation to First World War===

No. 5 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was formed at Farnborough, Hampshire, on 26 July 1913, from members of No. 3 Squadron. The squadron moved to Netheravon on 28 May, Fort Grange, Gosport on 6 July then Swingate Down on 14 August. Following the outbreak of the First World War, No. V Squadron deployed to France on 15 August 1914, equipped with a variety of aircraft types to implement reconnaissance for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). It flew its first missions on 21 August and on the next day, an Avro 504 of No. 5 Squadron was the first British aircraft to be shot down, its crew of pilot Second Lieutenant Vincent Waterfall and navigator Lieutenant Charles George Gordon Bayly being killed over Belgium. On 24 August, No. V Squadron became the first unit in the RFC to shoot down an enemy aircraft with gunfire when Lt. Wilson and Lt. Rabagliati shot down a German Etrich Taube near Le Cateau-Cambrésis.

From 24 March until 7 April 1917 the squadron was based at La Gorgue in northern France.

No. 5 Squadron standardised on the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2, specialising as observers for artillery, re-equipping with the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 in May 1917, and working closely with the Canadian Corps, through to the end of the war and into 1919, when it moved into Germany as part of the Army of Occupation. (Its association with the Canadian Corps led to the incorporation of a maple leaf in the squadron&#x27;s badge when it was approved in June 1937).

===Interwar years===

No. V Squadron returned to the UK in September 1919 before disbanding on 20 January 1920. The squadron was reformed at Quetta, India (now part of Pakistan) on 1 April 1920, when No. 48 Squadron was renumbered. There it continued working in Army Air Cooperation for operations on the North West Frontier. Upon reformation the unit was equipped with the Bristol F.2B which were flown up until 1931. In May 1931, No. 5 Squadron began to convert to the Westland Wapiti Mk.IIa.

===Second World War===
At the outbreak of war in September 1939, No. 5 Squadron were based at Fort Sandeman, still equipped with the Westland Wapiti biplane. The squadron became a light bomber unit when it converted to the Hawker Hart in June 1940. No. 5 Squadron further converted to the Hawker Audax in February 1941, using it as a fighter. In December 1941, the squadron relocated to RAF Dum Dum, Calcutta, and began to receive their first monoplane – the American-built Curtiss Mohawk Mk.IV. Posted to RAF Dinjan, Assam, in May 1942, No. V Squadron became tasked with escorting Bristol Blenheim bombers over north west Burma.

The Mohawks were replaced by Hawker Hurricane Mk.IIcs and Mk.IIds in June 1943 while the squadron was based at RAF Kharagpur. In September 1944, No. 5 Squadron converted to the Republic Thunderbolt Mk.I and Mk.II. In May 1945, No. V Squadron was withdrawn from the front line in preparation for the liberation of Malaya from Japanese occupation, however this was never carried out due to the Japanese Empire surrendering on 15 August 1945.

===Cold War===
Remaining in India, No. 5 Squadron converted to Hawker Tempest F.2 in February 1946, but disbanded on 1 August 1947 due to the Partition of India. On 11 February 1949, the squadron reformed at RAF Pembrey in Wales for target-towing duties when No. 595 Squadron was renumbered, however the squadron was shortly disbanded on 25 September 1951. The squadron was reformed at RAF Wunstorf, West Germany, on 1 March 1952, and were equipped with the de Havilland Vampire F.5. No. V Squadron converted over to the de Havilland Venom FB.1 in December 1952. The 1957 Defence White Paper saw the disbandment of No. 5 Squadron on 12 October 1957 while operating the Venom FB.5.

On 20 January 1959, the squadron was reformed as a night fighter unit at RAF Laarbruch, West Germany, flying the Gloster Meteor NF.11. No. 5 Squadron began converting to the delta winged Gloster Javelin FAW.5 in January 1960. When No. 33 Squadron was disbanded on 17 December 1962, No. V Squadron was allocated the former unit&#x27;s Javelin FAW.9, along with crew members. No. 5 Squadron itself was disbanded on 7 October 1965 at RAF Geilenkirchen.

===Lightning and Tornado (1965–2003)===

The squadron reformed as No V (AC) Squadron at RAF Binbrook, Lincolnshire, on 8 October 1965 with the English Electric Lightning interceptor. However, upon reformation the unit did not initially operate a Lightning, with the squadron first flying Hawker Hunter T.7A &quot;WV318&quot; fitted with Lightning instruments. No V (AC) Squadron&#x27;s first Lightning arrived on 19 November, when Lightning T.5 &quot;XS451&quot; was delivered to RAF Binbrook. The squadron&#x27;s first single seat Lightnings arrived on 10 December 1965, when Lightning F.3s &quot;XR755&quot; and &quot;XR756&quot; were delivered. No. V (AC) Squadron received their first production Lightning F.6 on 3 January 1967, with the arrival of &quot;XS894&quot;. Between 6 and 25 October 1967, the squadron deployed to RAF Luqa, Malta, with nine Lightning F.6s and a single Lighting T.5 for an Air Defence Exercise (ADEX) against Avro Vulcan B.2s of No. 50 Squadron. No 5 (AC) Squadron deployed to RAF Luqa once again between 1 and 8 August 1968 for Exercise Nimble.

Notably, over Christmas 1969, V(AC) Squadron deployed on reinforcement Exercise Ultimacy to RAF Tengah, Singapore using in flight refuelling and stopping only once en route at RAF Masirah in Oman. Long-distance route proving with the new overwing tanks had taken place previously in 1968 with a limited non stop deployment to RAF Muharraq in Bahrain.

In 1970, the squadron received a pair of Lightning F.1As (&quot;XM181&quot; and &quot;XM183&quot;), which were used as targets for the Lightning F.6s due to them being lighter and more nimble (these were later replaced with Lightning F.3s). On 8 September 1970, the squadron lost Lightning F.6 &quot;XS894&quot; when it crashed near Flamborough Head, Yorkshire, killing the pilot USAF Capt. William Schaffner. No. V (F) Squadron deployed two Lighting F.3s, seven Lightning F.6s and a single two-seat T.5 to RAF Luqa between 18 November and 13 December 1974, as part of Exercise Sunfinder alongside Avro Shackleton AEW.2s of No. 8 Squadron and English Electric Canberra B.2s of No. 85 Squadron. Between 5 April and 7 May 1976, the squadron deployed to RAF Luqa with ten Lightning F.6s for an APC. No V (AC) Squadron&#x27;s last APC deployment to RAF Luqa was between 31 March and 5 May 1977.

In November 1987, No. V (AC) Squadron put up a nine-ship of Lightning F.6s to mark the type&#x27;s impending withdrawal after 22 years of service. The last Lightnings were withdrawn by December 1987, with the squadron relocating to RAF Coningsby in preparation for the Panavia Tornado F.3. No V (AC) Squadron received their first Tornado F.3 in January 1988.

In August 1990, V (AC) Squadron was the first RAF squadron (accompanied by No. 29 (F) Squadron) to be deployed as part the UK&#x27;s contribution to the Gulf War, with the first six Tornado F.3s arriving on 11 August at Dhahran Airfield, Saudi Arabia. Between 1993 and 1995, the squadron helped enforce the no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of Operation Deny Flight. No V (AC) Squadron disbanded on 30 September 2002, with personnel being reassigned to other units.

===Sentinel R1 (2004–2021)===
The squadron reformed on 1 April 2004 as No. 5 (Army Co-operation) Squadron at RAF Waddington. The first production Raytheon Sentinel R1 made its maiden flight on 26 May 2004. The ASTOR system officially entered service with the No. 5 (AC) Squadron on 1 December 2008. The fifth and last Sentinel to be delivered to the squadron was &quot;ZJ694&quot; in February 2009. Full Operating Capability was achieved at the end of 2010. The new radar-equipped aircraft provides battlefield and ground surveillance for the British Army in a similar role to the American Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS aircraft. In 2011, Sentinels from No. V (AC) Squadron participated in operations over Libya as part of Operation Ellamy, which were later described as pivotal by RAF Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton.

Between 2009 and 2011, No. V (AC) Squadron also briefly operated four Hawker Beechcraft Shadow R.1, based on the Beechcraft King Air 350. The first Shadow R.1 (&quot;ZZ416&quot;) was delivered to the squadron in May 2009. These were transferred over to the newly reformed No. 14 Squadron in October 2011.

On 25 January 2013, a Sentinel R1 deployed to Dakar-Ouakam Air Base, Senegal, to assist with France&#x27;s Operation Serval in Mali. Over the course of a four-month long detachment, Sentinels flew a total of 697 hours across 66 sorties. On 18 May 2014, the squadron deployed a Sentinel to Kotoka International Airport, Ghana, in order to assist with searching for 223 schoolgirls who had been kidnapped by Boko Haram in Nigeria. In September 2014, the squadron temporarily relocated to RAF Cranwell along with No. 14 Squadron due to the resurfacing of RAF Waddington&#x27;s runway which took over a year to complete. No. 5 (AC) Squadron sent a single Sentinel R.1 to Exercise Red Flag 15–1 at Nellis AFB, Nevada, between 26 January and 13 February 2015. On 26 March 2015, No. 5 (AC) Squadron deployed two Sentinel R1s to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, in support of Operation Shader.

In July 2017, Sentinel R.1 &quot;ZJ693&quot; was withdrawn from use, with the remaining four Sentinels being given an out of service date (OSD) of 2021. In February 2020, the OSD was confirmed by the Ministry of Defence as March 2021. On 25 February 2021, &quot;ZJ694&quot; carried out No. V (AC) Squadron&#x27;s last Sentinel R.1 operational sortie. Across the Sentinel&#x27;s 14 years of service, the squadron flew 32,000 hours across 4,870 sorties. The squadron was subsequently disbanded on 31 March 2021.

<doc id="604496" wikidata="Q1143396" url="?curid=604496" title="Osaka City University">
<text>, abbreviated to , is a public university in Japan. It is located in Sumiyoshi-ku, Osaka. It is one of the most prestigious universities in Japan regarding Applied Linguistics.

The university will merge with Osaka Prefecture University to form [[Osaka Metropolitan University]] (OMU) in April 2022.

== History ==
OCU&#x27;s predecessor was founded in 1880, as &#x27; with donations by local merchants. It became Osaka Commercial School in 1885, then was municipalized in 1889. Osaka City was defeated in a bid to draw the Second National Commercial College (the winner was Kobe City), so the city authorities decided to establish a municipal commercial college without any aid from the national budget. In 1928, the college became &#x27;, the first municipal university in Japan.

In 1901, the school was reorganized to become , later authorized under Specialized School Order in 1904. The college had grand brick buildings around the Taishō period.

In 1949 OCU had five faculties (Business / Economics / Law and Literature / Science and Engineering / Home Economics).
In 1953, the Faculty of Law and Literature was divided into two faculties.
In 1955, Osaka City Medical University was incorporated and became the Faculty of Medicine.
In 1959, the Faculty of Science and Engineering was divided into two faculties.
In 1975, the Faculty of Home Economics was reorganized into the Faculty of Human Life Science.
In 2003, the Graduate School of Creative Cities was established.
In 2006, the Urban Research Plaza and the Advanced Research Institute for Natural Science and Technology were established.
Due to financial problems in many cities, all of the municipal universities in Japan were requested to incorporate. OCU became a Public University Corporation in 2006.
In 2015 OCU celebrated its 135th anniversary.
In June 2020, OCU announced it would be merging with Osaka Prefecture University in a new university named &quot;University of Osaka&quot;. However, after the name was announced on June 26, 2020, Osaka University President released a statement pointing out that the English version of the new university&#x27;s name was &quot;remarkably similar&quot; to that of Osaka University, adding, &quot;It will cause confusion among our students, and work as a great obstacle for the future of both universities, which are reaching out to the world.&quot;

<doc id="604501" wikidata="Q7906678" url="?curid=604501" title="VCY America">
<text>VCY America, Inc. is a traditional, evangelical, conservative Christian ministry based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The VCY America Radio Network maintains a format of Christian talk and teaching, as well as traditional Christian music through its broadcast outlets.

==History==
Originally known as &quot;Milwaukee Youth For Christ&quot;, and later, &quot;Greater Milwaukee Youth For Christ&quot;, it left the national YFC organization in 1973 and became known as the &quot;Wisconsin Voice of Christian Youth&quot; (WVCY) until 1995, when it changed to its present name. Its flagship stations in Milwaukee, WVCY-FM and WVCY-TV, share a call sign which refers to the ministry&#x27;s original name.

==Radio network==

The ministry operates 41 VCY America-owned radio stations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. It also broadcasts over 27 low-power FM translators. VCY America radio also provides programming such as &quot;Crosstalk&quot;, &quot;Worldview Weekend&quot;, and &quot;Music &#x27;til Dawn&quot; to stations throughout the country via satellite. Additionally, VCY has a Christian bookstore in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin which is promoted on air and ships throughout the United States as an additional source of revenue.

VCY has attempted to expand into the San Francisco Bay Area, Las Vegas, and the Coachella Valley through the lease and attempted purchase of a group of three stations in a bankruptcy action: KFRH, KREV and KRCK-FM. In early 2022, the original owner sued successfully to nullify the bankruptcy action against them, and the bankruptcy debtor in possession and trustee was forced to return to the stations to them and nullify the VCY America leases. In October 2023, VCY America participated in a bankruptcy auction for these stations and was the winning bidder for KFRH, KRCK-FM, and two translators in the Palm Springs area for $2,445,952.88. KFRH in North Las Vegas, Nevada&#x27;s call sign was changed to KVPH and it began airing VCY America&#x27;s programming on March 18, 2024.

In December 2022 VCY America announced it would purchase WFAS-FM in the New York City area from Cumulus Media, pending final approval from the Federal Communications Commission. Renamed WVBN, the acquisition, completed on February 6, 2023, gave VCY America its first broadcast outlet on the East Coast. VCY America added to its Northeastern expansion in August 2023 with its purchase of WJBR-FM in Wilmington, Delaware, from Beasley Broadcast Group. VCY took control of the station October 6, changing its call sign to WVCW; the move brings its programming into the Philadelphia market.

===Programming===
VCY America&#x27;s radio programming includes Christian talk and teaching programming, among them:

* &quot;Crosstalk&quot;, hosted by Jim Schneider, with past Vic Eliason-hosted episodes also aired
* &quot;Worldview Weekend&quot; with Brannon Howse
* &quot;Grace to You&quot; with John MacArthur
* &quot;In Touch&quot; with Charles Stanley
* &quot;Love Worth Finding&quot; with Adrian Rogers
* &quot;Revive Our Hearts&quot; with Nancy DeMoss Wolgemuth
* &quot;The Alternative with Tony Evans&quot;
* &quot;Liberty Counsel&#x27;s Faith and Freedom Report&quot;
* &quot;Thru the Bible&quot; with J. Vernon McGee
* &quot;Joni and Friends&quot; with Joni Eareckson Tada
* &quot;Unshackled!&quot;
* Moody Radio&#x27;s &quot;Stories of Great Christians&quot;
* &quot;Brinkman Adventures&quot;

VCY America also airs a variety of vocal and instrumental traditional Christian music, as well as children&#x27;s programming such as &quot;Ranger Bill&quot;. Notably, the network (including WVCY-TV) eschews any programs featuring Contemporary Christian music, and has dropped programming which has switched to it in any form, including as theme music.

==Television==
The ministry also owns WVCY-TV (Channel 30) in Milwaukee, which holds a commercial license but is completely viewer supported. As of January 2018, it is carried under a channel share agreement with commercial station WITI, owned by Fox Television Stations. It vacated its former independent frequency in the FCC&#x27;s spectrum repack auction, the proceeds of which ($76.3 million, plus donations and bookstore purchases since) have been utilized to expand VCY&#x27;s radio network. WVCY-TV is also carried in the Wausau television market via translator W26EE-D, licensed to Wittenburg.

In 1994, WVCY-TV rejected an offer to be purchased by CBS and become the network&#x27;s new Milwaukee affiliate, following WITI&#x27;s defection to Fox as part of the 1994–1996 United States broadcast television realignment.

==Other efforts==
The ministry also operates a summer camp, near Hillsboro, Wisconsin, called, &quot;Trail Ridge Camp&quot; as well as its religious bookstore, with a physical location in Wauwatosa, a suburb of Milwaukee, and its online presence.

==Leadership==
The ministry is run by a team formerly headed by the late Vic Eliason, a former Youth for Christ worker, ordained Christian minister and a recipient of an honorary doctorate from Bob Jones University, in 2001. Jim Schneider is the current Executive Director.

<text>Agostino Steffani (25 July 165412 February 1728) was an Italian bishop, polymath, diplomat and composer.

==Education==
Steffani was born at Castelfranco Veneto on 25 July 1654. As a boy he was admitted as a chorister at San Marco, Venice.

Steffani excelled as a choirboy and was asked to sing at important occasions. Aged 11 and 12 he sang opera in Venice. Aged 13 Steffani received patronage and he moved to Munich. Steffani&#x27;s education was completed at the expense of Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria, who appointed him &quot;Churfürstlicher Kammer- und Hofmusikus&quot; and granted him a liberal salary. After receiving instruction from Johann Kaspar Kerll, in whose charge he lived, Steffani was sent in 1673 to study in Rome, where Ercole Bernabei was his master, and among other works he composed six motets, the original manuscripts of which are now in the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge.

On his return to Munich with Bernabei in 1674, Steffani published his first work, &quot;Psalmodia vespertina&quot;, a part of which was reprinted in Giovanni Battista Martini&#x27;s &quot;Saggio di contrappunto&quot; in 1774. In 1675, Steffani was appointed court organist.

==Royal appointments==
The date when he was ordained priest, with the title of abbot of Lepsing, is not precisely known. His ecclesiastical status did not prevent him from turning his attention to the stage, for which, at different periods of his life, he composed work which exercised a potent influence upon the dramatic music of the period. Of his first opera, &quot;Marco Aurelio&quot;, written for the carnival and produced at Munich in 1681, the only copy known to exist is a manuscript score preserved in the royal library at Buckingham Palace. It was followed by &quot;Solone&quot; in 1685, by &quot;Audacia e rispetto&quot;, &quot;Prerogative d&#x27;amore&quot;, and &quot;Servio Tullio&quot; in 1686, by &quot;Alarico&quot; in 1687, and by &quot;Niobe, regina di Tebe&quot; in 1688.

Notwithstanding the favor shown to him by the Elector Maximilian Emanuel, Steffani accepted in 1688 the appointment of &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; at the court of Hanover, where he speedily improved an acquaintance dating from 1681 with Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (afterwards Elector of Hanover), winning also a pleasant footing with the Elector&#x27;s daughter Sophia Charlotte (afterwards Electress of Brandenburg and Queen of Prussia), the philosopher Leibniz, the abbot Ortensio Mauro, and many men of letters, and where, in 1710, he showed great kindness to Handel, who was then just entering upon his career. Steffani inaugurated a long series of triumphs in Hanover by composing, for the opening of the new opera house in 1689, an opera called &quot;Henrico Leone&quot; on Henry the Lion. For the same theatre he composed &quot;La Lotta d&#x27;Ercole con Achilleo&quot; in 1689, &quot;La Superbia d&#x27;Alessandro&quot; in 1690, &quot;Orlando generoso&quot; in 1691, &quot;Le Rivali concordi&quot; in 1692, &quot;La Liberia contenta&quot; in 1693, &quot;I trionfi del fato&quot; and &quot;I Baccanali&quot; in 1695, and &quot;Briseide&quot; (with Pietro Torri) in 1696. The libretto of &quot;Briseide&quot; is by Francesco Palmieri. Those of most if not all the others are by the abbot Mauro.

The scores are preserved at Buckingham Palace, where, in company with five volumes of songs and three of duets, they form part of the collection brought to England by the Elector of Hanover in 1714, when ascending as King George I of Great Britain. But it was not only as a musician that Steffani distinguished himself in his new home. The elevation of Ernest Augustus to the electorate in 1692 led to difficulties, for the arrangement of which it was necessary that an ambassador should visit the various German courts, armed with a considerable amount of diplomatic power.

==Diplomacy==
Steffani was sent on this mission in 1696, with the title of envoy extraordinary, after which Pope Innocent XI, in recognition of certain privileges he had secured for the Hanoverian Catholics, consecrated him bishop of Spiga on the Sea of Marmora (modern day Biga in Turkey). Between 1709 and 1723 Steffani served as Vicar Apostolic of Upper and Lower Saxony, a new Roman Catholic diaspora jurisdiction, embracing Upper and Lower Saxon territories.

In 1698, he was sent as ambassador to Brussels, and after the death of Ernest Augustus in the same year he entered the service of the Elector Palatine, John William, at Düsseldorf, where he held the offices of privy councillor and protonotary of the Holy See. To avoid any breach of etiquette that might arise if he continued to produce dramatic compositions, Steffani produced two new operas: &quot;Enea&quot; at Hanover and &quot;Tassilone&quot; at Düsseldorf in the name of his secretary and amanuensis Gregorio Piva, whose signature is attached to the scores preserved at Buckingham Palace. Another score, that of &quot;Arminio&quot; in the same collection, dated Düsseldorf, 1707, and evidently the work of Steffani, bears no composer&#x27;s name.

Steffani did not accompany the elector George to England, but in 1724 the Academy of Vocal Music in London elected him its honorary president for life. In return for the compliment he sent the association a &quot;Stabat Mater,&quot; for six voices and orchestra, and three madrigals. The manuscripts of these are still in existence, and the British Library possesses a &quot;Confitebor,&quot; for three voices and orchestra, of about the same period. All these compositions are in advance of the age in which they were written, and in his operas Steffani shows an appreciation of the demands of the stage, noted as remarkable during a period at which the musical drama was gradually approaching the character of a merely formal concert, with scenery and dresses. But for the manuscripts at Buckingham Palace, these operas would be unknown. Steffani is remembered for his chamber duets, which, like those of his contemporary Carlo Maria Clari (1669–1745), are chiefly written in the form of cantatas for two voices, accompanied by a figured bass. The British Library (Add MS 5055-5056) possesses more than a hundred of these compositions, some of which were published at Munich in 1679. Steffani visited Italy for the last time in 1727, in which year Handel, who always gratefully remembered the kindness he had received from him at Hanover, once more met him at the palace of Cardinal Ottoboni in Rome. This was the last time the two composers met. Steffani returned soon afterwards to Hanover, and died on 12 February 1728 while engaged in the transaction of some diplomatic business at Frankfurt.

==Compositions==
Steffani stands somewhat apart from contemporary Italian composers (e.g., Alessandro Scarlatti) in his mastery of instrumental forms. His compositions, including opera overtures, show a combination of Italian suavity with a logical conciseness of construction attributable to French influence.

<doc id="604512" wikidata="Q356361" url="?curid=604512" title="Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner">
<text>Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner, (23 March 1854 – 13 May 1925) was a British statesman and colonial administrator who played a very important role in the formulation of British foreign and domestic policy between the mid-1890s and early 1920s. From December 1916 to November 1918, he was one of the most important members of Prime Minister David Lloyd George&#x27;s War cabinet.

Milner was born in the Grand Duchy of Hesse in 1854 and was educated in Germany and England before attending Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first class in classics. Though he was called to the bar in 1881, Milner instead became a journalist before entering politics as a Liberal before quickly leaving the party in 1886 over his opposition to Irish Home Rule. He joined the staff of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Goschen and was posted to Egypt as under-secretary of finance. He briefly chaired the Board of Inland Revenue until April 1897, when he was appointed Governor of the Cape Colony and High Commissioner for Southern Africa by Joseph Chamberlain following the disastrous Jameson Raid.

As Governor and High Commissioner, Milner was a leading advocate for British subjects of the Transvaal and Orange Free State, and his policy precipitated the Second Boer War. During the war, Milner received praise and criticism for his civilian administration in South Africa, including the establishment of concentration camps to intern the Boers. Following the British victory and annexation of the Boer republics, Milner was named their first British governor. Upon his return to England in 1905, he faced censure for the use of corporal punishment against Chinese labourers. He remained a firm advocate for British imperialism for the remainder of his life. Through his influence on young civil servants and imperialists, including Lionel Curtis and Leo Amery, Milner&#x27;s influence on the British Empire extended through the Second World War.

During the First World War, Milner served as a key advisor and cabinet member to Prime Minister David Lloyd George. During the March 1918 collapse of the Western Front, Milner coordinated the consolidation of Allied forces under the commander of Ferdinand Foch, whom he personally selected as Supreme Allied Commander. Foch won the Battle of Amiens, repelling the German advance and turning the tide of the war. Milner was appointed Secretary of State for War for the duration of the conflict, which resulted in an Allied victory and armistice in November 1918. At the subsequent Paris Peace Conference, Milner was a leading delegate and a signatory to the Treaty of Versailles. He served as Secretary of State for the Colonies for the remainder of his public career.

==Early life and education==
Alfred Milner was born on 23 March 1854 in Giessen, Upper Hesse, Grand Duchy of Hesse. His father was Charles Milner, a London physician with a German mother and English father who was a reader in English at the University of Tübingen. His maternal grandfather, John Ready, was Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island and the Isle of Man.

Alfred Milner was educated first at Tübingen, then at King&#x27;s College School and from 1872 to 1876 as a scholar of Balliol College, Oxford, studying under the classicist theologian Benjamin Jowett. Having won the Hertford, Craven, Eldon and Derby scholarships, he graduated in 1877 with a first class in classics and was elected to a fellowship at New College, leaving, however, for London in 1879. At Oxford he formed a close friendship with the young economic historian Arnold Toynbee. He wrote a paper in support of Toynbee&#x27;s theories of social work and, in 1895, twelve years after Toynbee&#x27;s death at the age of 30, a tribute titled &quot;Arnold Toynbee: a Reminiscence&quot;.

==Early career==
Although authorised to practise law after being called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1881, he joined the staff of the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; under John Morley, becoming assistant editor to William Thomas Stead. In 1885, Milner abandoned journalism for a brief political career, standing as the Liberal candidate for the Harrow division of Middlesex but lost in the general election.

In 1886, Milner supported the breakaway Liberal Unionist Party over his opposition to Irish Home Rule. He became private secretary to Liberal Unionist George Goschen and rose in rank when Goschen became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1887. Two years later, Goschen used his influence to have Milner appointed under-secretary of finance in Egypt. Milner remained in Egypt from 1889 to 1892, his period of office coinciding with the first great reforms under Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer, after the danger of bankruptcy which precipitated British control had been avoided.

Returning to England in 1892, he published &quot;England and Egypt&quot; which, at once, became the authoritative account of the work done since British occupation began in 1882. Later that year, he received an appointment as chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue where he remained until 1897. While at Inland Revenue, he established relationships with Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn and Sir William Vernon Harcourt.

In 1894, he was made CB and in 1895, KCB. Milner remained at the Board of Inland Revenue until 1897, having established a reputation as one of the clearest-headed and most judicious British civil servants, a position as a man of moderate Liberal Unionist views, and strong political allies in Goschen, Cromer, St Aldwyn and Harcourt.

==South Africa==

=== Relations with the Boer republics ===
The South African Republic, more commonly referred to by the British as the Transvaal, was established in 1852 by Afrikaner farmers who had emigrated from the Cape Colony in the Great Trek in to live beyond the reach of British colonial administration. These farmers, known as Boers, successfully defended their independence from the British Empire in the First Boer War from 1880 to 1881, which established self-government under nominal British suzerainty in the Pretoria Convention. Following the discovery of gold in the Transvaal in 1884, thousands of fortune seekers flocked there from Europe, but mostly from Britain. This new influx of foreigners, whom the Boers called Uitlanders, was received negatively in the republic, and they were refused the right to vote.

In 1896, British colonial administrator Leander Starr Jameson, under the employment of Cecil Rhodes, attempted and failed to trigger an uprising against President Kruger by the Uitlanders. The raid dramatically worsened relations between the British Cape Colony and the Boer republics, and the latter began increasing their importation of guns and ammunition from Germany. By April 1897, Lord Rosmead resigned as High Commissioner for Southern Africa and Governor of Cape Colony. Secretary of State for the Colonies Joseph Chamberlain sought to replace Rosmead with a statesman who could restore public confidence and uphold British interests in dealing with the Transvaal and Orange Free State governments, and he chose Milner at the suggestion of William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne. The selection was cordially approved by the Liberal Party and warmly recognised at a farewell dinner on 28 March 1897, presided over by H. H. Asquith.

Reaching the Cape Colony in May, Milner resolved difficulties with President Kruger over the treatment of the Uitlanders under the Transvaal Aliens&#x27; Law, then set out on a tour of British South Africa. Between August 1897 and May 1898 he travelled Cape Colony, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Rhodesia, and Basutoland. To better understand the point of view of the Cape Dutch and the burghers of the Transvaal and Orange Free State, Milner learned both Dutch and Afrikaans. He came to the conclusion that there could be no peace or progress while there remained the &quot;permanent subjection of British to Dutch in [the Transvaal]&quot;. The Transvaal also obstructed British ambitions for a &quot;Cape to Cairo&quot; railway and trading network, and Milner realised that with the discovery of gold in the Transvaal, the balance of power in South Africa had shifted in favor of the Boers. He feared a newly wealthy Transvaal would unite with Cape Afrikaners and jeopardise the entire British position in the region.

In a history of the Second Boer War in 1909, Milner later wrote:&quot;The Dutch can never form a perfect allegiance merely to Great Britain. The British can never, without moral injury, accept allegiance to any body politic which excludes their motherland. But British and Dutch alike could, without moral injury, without any sacrifice to their several traditions, unite in loyal devotion to an empire-state, in which Great Britain and South Africa would be partners, and could work cordially together for the good of South Africa as a member of that great whole. And so you see the true Imperialist is also the best South African.&quot;Milner became the most prominent voice in the British government advocating war with the Boer republics to secure British control over the region. After meeting Milner for the first time, Boer soldier (and future politician) Jan Smuts predicted that he would become &quot;more dangerous than Rhodes&quot; and &quot;a second Bartle Frere&quot;.

=== Second Boer War ===

==== Pre-war diplomacy ====
After the February 1898 Transvaal election, which Kruger won by a landslide, Milner concluded that the Pretoria government would never redress the grievances of the Uitlanders on its own initiative. This gave Milner the pretext to use the question to his advantage. In a speech delivered on 3 March 1898 at Graaff Reinet, an Afrikaner Bond stronghold in the British Cape Colony, Milner outlined his determination to secure freedom and equality for British subjects in the Transvaal, and he urged the Boers to induce the Pretoria government to assimilate its institutions to those of the free communities of South Africa. His pronouncement, along with the resumption of control of the Progressive Party by Cecil Rhodes, greatly alarmed the Afrikaners. At the March 1898 elections, opponents of the Progressives won a majority in the House of Assembly and William Schreiner formed a government opposed to British intervention in the Transvaal.

Convinced his position in the Cape Colony had become untenable, Milner returned to England in November 1898, where he secured Chamberlain&#x27;s support to back the Uitlanders before returning to Cape Colony in February 1899. In the ten weeks Milner spent away from the Colony, relations with the Boers had deteriorated after acting High Commissioner William Francis Butler had allowed the inference that he did not support Uitlander grievances. On 4 May, Milner penned a memorable dispatch to the Colonial Office arguing for intervention to ensure Uitlander enfranchisement, which he posited was the only means of stabilizing the situation in South Africa and ensuring the predominant position of British interests in the region. He notably did not base his argument on the Pretoria Convention and argued &quot;suzerainty&quot; was an &quot;etymological question&quot;. Instead, he appealed to the condition of thousands of British subjects in the Transvaal as &quot;helots&quot; was undermining the prestige of Britain throughout South Africa, and he called for &quot;some striking proof&quot; of the intention of the British government not preserve its position. This dispatch was telegraphed to London for immediate publication; but it was kept private for a time by the home government. At the insistence of Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, a peace conference was held at Bloemfontein between Milner and Kruger from 31 May to 5 June. Kruger rejected Milner&#x27;s three demands: for Uitlander enfranchisement, for the use of English in the Transvaal parliament, and for the right of the British Parliament to review all Transvaal laws.

==== Administration during the war ====
When the Second Boer War broke out in October 1899, Milner supported and advised the British military efforts in South Africa. In the words of Lord Roberts, his &quot;courage never faltered&quot; during this early phase of the war. Milner set out to influence British education in the area for the English-speaking populations in order to Anglicise the Transvaal. He founded a series of schools known as the &quot;Milner Schools&quot;, including modern-day Pretoria High School for Girls, Pretoria Boys High School, Jeppe High School for Boys, King Edward VII School (Johannesburg), Potchefstroom High School for Boys and Hamilton Primary School.

In February 1901, though the war was still in progress, Milner was called upon to undertake the administration of the two Boer states, both now annexed to the British Empire. He thereupon resigned the governorship of Cape Colony but retained the post of high commissioner. During this period, his government established numerous concentration camps to intern the Boer civilian population. Milner&#x27;s efforts to reconstruct the civil administration were limited while operations continued in the field, and he therefore returned to England to spend a &quot;hard-begged holiday,&quot; mainly occupied in work at the Colonial Office. On his arrival to London on 24 May 1901, had an audience with Edward VII, received the GCB and was made a privy councillor. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Milner of St James&#x27;s in the County of London and of Cape Town in the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope. Speaking the next day at a luncheon in his honour, he asserted that the war had been unavoidable, as the British were asked to &quot;conciliate&quot; was &quot;panoplied hatred, insensate ambition, invincible ignorance&quot;. In late July, Milner received the Honorary Freedom of the City of London and gave another speech in which he defended the government policy.

Despite these honours, opposition to Milner within the Liberal Party grew over both his failed diplomacy before the war and his conduct during the war. Leonard Courtney characterised his as a &quot;lost mind&quot;, and Liberal leader Henry Campbell-Bannerman was among those to agitate for his recall. However, these efforts failed, and he returned to South Africa in August 1901.

On his return, he plunged into the herculean task of remodelling the administration. As the chief civilian administrator in South Africa, he bitterly fought Lord Kitchener, the Commander-in-Chief in South Africa, who ultimately won out. However, Milner ultimately drafted the terms of the Boer surrender, signed in Pretoria on 31 May 1902. The war concluded with the complete surrender of the Boers, though Milner&#x27;s efforts for punitive terms imposed on the Boers were tempered by Lord Kitchener. In recognition of his services he was, on 15 July 1902, elevated to the title of viscount.

=== Post-war administration ===
On 21 June, immediately following the formal end of hostilities, Milner published the letters patent establishing Crown colony governments in the Transvaal Colony and Orange River Colony and changing his title of administrator to that of governor. He established a 10% tax on the annual net produce of the gold mines and devoted his attention to the repatriation of the Boers, land resettlement by British colonists, education, justice, the constabulary, and the development of railways.

After Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s surprise resignation on 18 September 1903 due to ill health, Milner declined the vacant post of Secretary of State for the Colonies, considering it more important to complete his work in South Africa, where economic depression was becoming pronounced. Milner&#x27;s two-stage economic plan, which he called &quot;Lift and Overspill&quot;, called for increases in government revenue through economic prosperity and government spending to spread prosperity. Mining labour was essential to this plan, and in December, Parliament passed a Labour Ordinance to import Chinese labourers to avert a shortage.

Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons on 22 February 1906, said of the Chinese labour ordinance,

In the latter part of 1904 and the early months of 1905, Milner elaborated a plan to provide the Transvaal with a system of representative government, between Crown colony administration and self-government. Letters patent providing for this representative government were issued on 31 March 1905.

Speaking in Johannesburg on the eve of his retirement and departure, he recommended promotion of the material prosperity of the country and the equality of Afrikaners and the British. Referring to the war, he added, &quot;What I should prefer to be remembered by is a tremendous effort subsequent to the war not only to repair the ravages of that calamity but to re-start the colonies on a higher plane of civilization than they have ever previously attained&quot;. He concluded with a reference to the subject of imperial unity. &quot;When we who call ourselves Imperialists talk of the British Empire,&quot; Milner said, &quot;we think of a group of states bound, not in an alliance or alliances that can be made and unmade, but in a permanent organic union. Of such a union, the dominions of the sovereign as they exist today are only the raw material.&quot;
==== Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten ====

In the aftermath of the war, at Milner&#x27;s suggestion, the British government sent Henry Birchenough, a businessman and old friend of Milner&#x27;s, as special trade commissioner to South Africa with the task of preparing a Blue Book on trade prospects. To aid him in his task, Milner recruited a team of gifted young lawyers and administrators, most of them Oxford graduates, who became known as &quot;Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten&quot;. Among his proteges were Peter Perry, Lionel Curtis, Patrick Duncan, Geoffrey Dawson and Hugh Wyndham, many of whom continued in South Africa under Lord Selborne after Milner&#x27;s retirement and return to England. The Kindergarten retained a major influence in British South African and imperial affairs through World War II, long after Milner&#x27;s death.

== Return to England ==
By April 1905, Milner had been suffering health difficulties from the incessant strain of work and determined a need to retire, leaving Pretoria on 2 April and sailing for Europe the following day. He left South Africa during an acute economic crisis and under widespread criticism but was praised by colonial secretary Alfred Lyttelton for laying deep and strong the foundation upon which a united South Africa. Upon returning home, Oxford bestowed upon him the honorary degree of DCL.

=== Censure motion (1906) ===
On 20 March 1906, a motion was moved by William Byles, a radical Liberal member of the House of Commons, censuring Milner for his infraction of the Chinese labour ordinance by not forbidding light corporal punishment. On behalf of the Liberal government, an amendment was moved by Winston Churchill, stating, &quot;This House, while recording its condemnation of the flogging of Chinese coolies in breach of the law, desires, in the interests of peace and conciliation in South Africa, to refrain from passing censure upon individuals&quot;. Churchill further argued,

The amendment was carried by 355 votes to 135. A counter-demonstration was organised by Sir Bartle Frere, and a public address, signed by over 370,000 persons, was presented to Lord Milner expressing high appreciation of the services rendered by him in Africa to the Crown and empire.

=== Imperialist and political advocacy ===
Having established himself in his Johannesburg farewell address as a leading advocate of imperial unity, Milner continued to press the issue in Britain. He further developed his thesis in a magazine article written in view of the 1907 Imperial Conference in London which advocated the creation of a permanent deliberative imperial council and favoured preferential trade relations between the United Kingdom and the other members of the empire. In later years, he took an active part in advocating the causes of tariff reform and Imperial Preference.

In the period 1909–11, Milner was a strong opponent of the People&#x27;s Budget of David Lloyd George and the subsequent attempt of the Liberal government to curb the powers of the House of Lords.

According to historian Caroline Elkins, Milner &quot;firmly believed in racial hierarchy.&quot; Milner advanced ideas of British superiority and state-directed social engineering. Milner published his nationalist-imperialist credo:&quot;I am a Nationalist and not a cosmopolitan ... I am a British (indeed primarily an English) Nationalist. If I am also an Imperialist, it is because the destiny of the English race, owing to its insular position and long supremacy at sea, has been to strike roots in different parts of the world. I am an Imperialist and not a Little Englander because I am a British Race Patriot ... The British State must follow the race, must comprehend it, wherever it settles in appreciable numbers as an independent community. If the swarms constantly being thrown off by the parent hive are lost to the State, the State is irreparably weakened. We cannot afford to part with so much of our best blood. We have already parted with much of it, to form the millions of another separate but fortunately friendly State. We cannot suffer a repetition of the process.&quot;

==== &quot;The Round Table&quot; ====
In 1910, Milner and members of his Kindergarten founded &quot;The Round Table&quot;, a journal to promote the cause of imperial federation and expansion. 

The introduction to the journal, first published in November 1910, reads:

The journal, still in publication, was renamed in 1966 &quot;The Round Table: Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs&quot;.

==World War I==
Following the July Crisis, Milner became active in the British civilian war effort. On 27 May 1915, Milner was asked to head the National Service League. Although Britain was one of the few major powers without a conscript army, and Milner and the National Service League advocated for universal conscription. His strong position forced a meeting with the King at Windsor Castle on 28 August 1915. Ultimately, a policy of conscription was adopted in July 1916. Lord Milner&#x27;s speech in the House of Lords on 19 April 1916 strengthened the new law conscripting married men, &quot;making all men of military age liable of being called up to service until the war ends.&quot; 

Milner was also an outspoken critic of the Gallipoli campaign, speaking in the House of Lords on 14 October 1915 and 8 November 1915, and suggesting a withdrawal. 

=== Monday Night Cabal and defeat of Asquith government ===
Beginning in early 1916, Leo Amery hosted informal meetings of a ginger group of members of Parliament to discuss the war effort. The group centered on Amery, Milner, George Carson, Geoffrey Dawson (who had been part of Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten in South Africa), Waldorf Astor and F. S. Oliver. Others attending included Henry Wilson, Edward Carson, and Philip Kerr. On 30 September 1915, Minister of Munitions David Lloyd George attended one of these meetings and established Milner as one of his advisors. The two established close relations.

Beginning on 17 January 1916, the ginger group attendees discussed the setup of a new, small war cabinet to depose the Asquith coalition ministry. Amery later described the Asquith cabinet as an &quot;assembling of twenty-three gentlemen without any idea of what they were going to talk about, eventually dispersing for lunch without any idea of what they had really discussed or decided, and certainly without any recollection on either point three months later&quot;. Following the death of Lord Kitchener aboard the HMS &quot;Hampshire&quot; on 5 June 1916, Milner was mentioned as a possible Secretary of State for War, though the role went to Lloyd George. Milner also declined the opportunity to chair the Dardanelles Commission investigating the Gallipoli campaign. Instead, he committed himself to supervising the government&#x27;s three coal committees at the request of Lord Robert Cecil; he submitted his report on coal production on 6 November 1916.

With Lloyd George occupied with the duties of Secretary of State for War, Milner was now the government&#x27;s most forceful critic. Milner continued to speak against the Asquith cabinet in the House of Lords, and Sir Edward Carson, who was Leader of the Opposition, delivered speeches in the House of Commons. The ginger group tried unsuccessfully to convince the members of Asquith&#x27;s coalition government to resign, focusing on Lloyd George. On 2 December 1916, Lord Milner dined with Conservative chairman Arthur Steel-Maitland, who requested he draft a letter describing the war cabinet he envisioned. This letter was then sent to Colonial secretary Bonar Law. On 3 December, Lloyd George and Asquith agreed to create a small war committee headed by Lloyd George and reporting to the Prime Minister. However, &quot;The Times&quot; immediately published an editorial announcing the deal as a cabinet reshuffle, criticizing Asquith and praising Lloyd George. Asquith blamed the editorial on Lord Northcliffe and Lloyd George and insisted that he himself must chair the war committee, precipitating Lloyd George&#x27;s resignation from the government. Asquith demanded the resignations of all ministers with a view to reconstructing his government, but leading Conservatives Lord Curzon, Lord Robert Cecil and Austen Chamberlain declined to serve. Asquith submitted his resignation as Prime Minister to George V on 6 December 1916. The King immediately asked Bonar Law to form a government, but he declined, for Asquith refused to serve under him. The King then turned to David Lloyd George, who took office the same day and formed a national government.

===War cabinet and Secretary of State for War===
On 8 December 1916, Lloyd George asked Milner, the Briton with the most experience in the civil direction of a war, to join the new war cabinet, which was to meet the next day at the War Office. Milner happily accepted. As was the case for most of the war cabinet, Milner was a minister without portfolio. He received a salary of £5,000 (£350,000 in 2020).

According to Maurice Hankey:

Immediately following the first war cabinet meeting, which lasted seven hours, Lloyd George praised Milner to the press. &quot;He picked out the most important points at once&quot;, Lloyd George said. &quot;Milner and I stand for the same things. He is a poor man and so am I. He does not represent the landed or capitalist classes any more than I do. He is keen on social reform and so am I.&quot; Milner remained one of Lloyd George&#x27;s closest advisors throughout the war, second only to Bonar Law, and was responsible for negotiating contracts with miners, agricultural production, and food rationing. For instance, in response to the U-boat campaign and blockade of British ports in early 1917, Milner assisted the Royal Agricultural Society in procuring 5,000 Fordson tractors and communicated directly with Henry Ford by telegraph. Junior ministerial positions established to assist the war cabinet (known as the Garden Suburb) were filled with young Milner allies, including Leo Amery, Waldorf Astor, Lionel Curtis and Philip Kerr.

In December 1917, Milner was instrumental in the release of more than 300 conscientious objectors from prison, intervening with high government officials on behalf of the imprisoned activist Stephen Henry Hobhouse, the son of an old family friend, and Milner&#x27;s proxy godson. Milner was also a chief author of the Balfour Declaration, which he drafted with Leo Amery, although it was issued in the name of Arthur Balfour. Milner was considered, &quot;with Lloyd George, the most powerful advocate of a pro-Zionist declaration&quot; in British government at the time. He was a highly outspoken critic of the Austro-Hungarian war in Serbia arguing that &quot;there is more widespread desolation being caused there (than) we have been familiar with in the case of Belgium&quot;.

==== Mission to Russia (January 1917) ====
On 20 January 1917, Milner led the British delegation on a diplomatic mission to Russia aboard the . The object of the mission, stressed at the second Chantilly Conference in December 1916, was to maintain the Russian position in the war and synchronize its movements with the Western allies of Britain, France and Italy. However, the meetings revealed major equipment shortages and operational dysfunction in the Russian military, effectively negating their manpower advantage on the Eastern Front. British assistance was reduced to intervening with a task force to prevent allied stockpiles from falling into the hands of revolutionaries at the port of Arkhangelsk. The official report published in March 1917 was optimistic that even if the Tsar were to be toppled—which in fact happened just 13 days after Milner&#x27;s return—Russia would remain in the war and would solve their &quot;administrative chaos&quot;.

==== Flanders Offensive (191718) ====

Milner was involved in every major military decision taken by Lloyd George&#x27;s government, including the Flanders Offensive of 1917, which he, Bonar Law and Lloyd George initially opposed. The war cabinet did not insist on a halt to the offensive when the initial targets were not reached and indeed spent little time discussing the matter. By the end of the year, Milner had become certain that a decisive victory on the Western Front was unlikely and called for increased focus on other fronts. Milner was a leading delegate at the November 1917 Rapallo Conference in Italy that created an Allied Supreme War Council. He also attended all subsequent follow up meetings in Versailles to coordinate the war. 

Milner and Lloyd George gradually became disenchanted with the military leadership, which retained political support despite little or no battlefield success, and Milner backed Lloyd George&#x27;s removal of First Sea Lord Admiral John Jellicoe on Christmas Eve 1917 and General William Robertson as Chief of the Imperial General Staff in early 1918.

==== Imperial War Conference (1917) ====
Consistent with his position for imperial union, Milner proposed an Imperial War Cabinet which comprised the heads of government of Britain&#x27;s dominions, giving each an equal say in the conduct of the war. However, the Imperial War Cabinet was criticized for diluting the British position in favor of foreign viewpoints.

In the closing days of the Imperial War Conference in 1917, the Imperial War Cabinet decided to postpone the writing of an Imperial Constitution until after the war. This was a task it never took up.

==== Doullens Conference and appointment of Ferdinand Foch (March 1918) ====
Following the March 1918 German advance on the Western front, wherein the British Fifth Army and part of the Third Army were easily routed and Paris was threatened, the Allies realized the need for greater coordination. The war cabinet debated withdrawing to the Channel ports and efforts were made to get as many men to the front as possible. In response, Milner personally travelled to Doullens to coordinate the Allied efforts and deputised Ferdinand Foch as Supreme Allied Commander on 26 March 1918. Milner wrote of Doullens, Milner&#x27;s decision to deputise Foch was made over the wishes of Clemenceau, who preferred Philippe Pétain. Milner remarked to Leo Amery, who had driven him to the conference, &quot;I hope I was right. You and Henry [Wilson] have always told me Foch is the only big soldier.&quot; Foch&#x27;s stand was taken at Amiens, a town with a critical railway station, which, if taken, could have divided the Allies in half, driving the British into the sea, and leaving Paris and the rest of France open for defeat. The Battle of Amiens resulted in an Allied victory and turned the tide of the war, beginning the Hundred Days Offensive. When Milner returned to London, the War Cabinet gave him official thanks. 
According to George Barnes,

Historian Edward Crankshaw adds,

The appointment of Foch is memorialized by an inscription at the front of the Hôtel de Ville (town hall) in Doullens, which reads, &quot;This decision saved France and the freedom of the world.&quot;

On 19 April, Milner was appointed Secretary of State for War in place of the Earl of Derby, who had been a staunch ally of Field-Marshal Haig, and he presided over the Army Council for the remaining seven months of the war.

=== 1918 election and peace negotiations ===
In the khaki election of December 1918, called immediately after armistice with Germany, the Lloyd George government won an overwhelming majority. Through Waldorf Astor, Milner personally funded the National Democratic and Labour Party, a new party composed of trade workers emphasising imperial unity and citizen service and opposing pacifism. The National Party ran 28 candidates in the 1918 general election, splitting the Labour Party vote and winning ten seats. In the years after the War, Milner was unhappy with what he saw as Labour inheriting the Liberal &quot;indifference, if not to say hostility, to the Empire&quot;. It would have to rid itself of this if it was to ever become a &quot;great National party&quot;. He attributed anti-national bias in the Labour Party to &quot;superior persons&quot; interested in eradicating working class patriotism and substituting it with class-consciousness.

Following the coalition victory, Milner was appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies. In that capacity, attended the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, where, on behalf of the United Kingdom, he became one of the signatories of the Treaty of Versailles, including the &quot;Orts-Milner Agreement&quot; allowing to Belgium the administration of Ruanda-Urundi territories to reward the Belgo-African army (&quot;Force publique&quot;) for its war effort which highly contributed to pushing German troops out of the future Tanganyika Territory, as in the victorious Tabora and Mahenge battles.

==== Paris Peace Conference ====
In his capacity as Colonial secretary, Milner travelled back and forth to France as a delegate to the Paris Peace Conference. From February 1919 until the treaty signing, he made five trips to Versailles, each lasting on average one to two weeks.

On 10 May 1919, he flew to Paris for the first time. The trip took two-and-a-half hours, halving the time it took by train, boat, and car. Milner and Arthur Balfour stood in for Lloyd George at the Conference whenever the Prime Minister returned to England for political business. As Secretary of State for the Colonies, Milner was appointed to head up the Mandates Commission by the Big Four, which would decide the fate of the German colonial empire.

On 1 June 1919, Milner was present at a meeting of the imperial delegation at Lloyd George&#x27;s Paris flat at 23 Rue Nitot. At the meeting, Milner met with his former Boer foes, Louis Botha and Jan Smuts, one day after the anniversary of the Treaty of Vereeniging. Botha addressed Milner, saying, &quot;Seventeen years ago, my friend and I made peace in Vereeniging. ... It was a hard peace for us to accept, but as I know it now, when time has shown us the truth, it was not unjustit was a generous peace that the British people made with us, and this is why we stand with them today side by side in the cause which has brought us all together.&quot; According to Lloyd George, &quot;In Paris, Milner joined with his former antagonists in resistance to that spirit of relentlessness which would humiliate the vanquished foe and keep them down in the dust into which they had been cast...&quot;

Milner&#x27;s wartime rapport with Clemenceau was expected to improve the British position. American delegate Dr. James T. Shotwell noted in his diary that evening,

The Rue Nitot meeting determined the British Empire would object to the punitive measures of the Treaty of Versailles. Lloyd George requested revisions from Clemenceau and President Woodrow Wilson, stating that without substantial changes to reflect Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points, Britain would not take part in an occupation or blockade of Germany to enforce the treaty. However, Wilson and Clemenceau declined, Clemenceau in particular refusing to budge on the war guilt clause and financial reparations. In the end, minor territorial concessions were made, the most important being a reduction in the occupation of the Rhineland by the allies from 20 to 15 years.

==== Signing of the Treaty of Versailles ====

On 16 June 1919, the Allies gave an ultimatum to Germany and fixed the date of signing for 28 June. This caused a collapse of the conservative government of Germany on 21 June, and a rise of a liberal one. Two German delegates were then rushed to Versailles, arriving on 27 June. When the peace treaty ceremonies commenced at 3 pm on 28 June, and the German delegates entered the Hall of Mirrors, Lloyd George was unsure if they would sign or not, so he had them sign the document first, at 3:12 pm. The entire ceremony took an hour, with a total of 68 plenipotentiaries signing the treaty. Milner himself signed the treaty early, visiting the Hall of Mirrors after lunch, and was the eighth signatory overall. He recalled, &quot;Though the occasion was such a solemn one and there was a great crowd, I thought it all singularly unimpressive.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1899, Milner met Violet Cecil, the wife of Major Lord Edward Cecil, in South Africa. Edward Cecil was commissioned to South Africa after serving in the Grenadier Guards. Milner and Violet began a secret affair that lasted until her departure for England in late 1900. Her departure had a noticeable effect on his disposition; Milner himself wrote in his diary that he was feeling &quot;very low indeed&quot;. Edward Cecil learned of the affair and pushed for a commission to Egypt after Violet pushed to return to South Africa. After Lord Cecil&#x27;s death in 1918, Milner married Violet on 26 February 1921.

Around the end of the Second Boer War, Milner became a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers established by the Fabian Society campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb.

Having worked closely with Cecil Rhodes in South Africa, Milner was appointed a trustee to Rhodes&#x27;s will upon Rhodes&#x27;s death in March 1902. Upon his return from South Africa in 1905, Milner occupied himself mainly with business interests in London, becoming chairman of the Rio Tinto Zinc mining company. In 1906 he became a director of the Joint Stock Bank, a precursor of the Midland Bank.

== Death and legacy ==
On 13 May 1925, seven weeks past his 71st birthday, Milner died at Great Wigsell, East Sussex, of sleeping sickness, soon after returning from South Africa. His viscountcy, lacking heirs, died with him. His body was buried in the graveyard of the Church of St Mary the Virgin, in Salehurst in the county of East Sussex. There is a memorial tablet to him at Westminster Abbey which was unveiled on 26 March 1930.

=== Legacy ===
According to the Biographical Dictionary of World War I: &quot;Milner, on March 24, 1918 crossed the Channel and two days later at Doullens convinced Premier Georges Clemenceau, an old friend, that Marshal Ferdinand Foch be appointed commander in chief of the Allied armies in France.&quot; Today, at the entrance to the town hall stand two plaques, one written in French, the other in English, that say, &quot;This decision saved France and the freedom of the world.&quot;

According to Colin Newbury,An influential public servant for three decades, Milner was a visionary exponent of imperial unity at a time when imperialism was beginning to be called into question. His reputation exceeded his achievements: Office and honours were heaped upon him despite his lack of identification with either major political party.Lord Milner is seated third from the right in William Orpen&#x27;s famous Hall of Mirrors painting.

The town of Milnerton, South Africa is named in his honour.

He was lionised, along with other members of the British War Cabinet, in an oil painting, Statesmen of World War I, on display today at the National Portrait Gallery, London.

<text>Laid Back is a Danish electronic music duo group from Copenhagen, formed in 1979. The duo consists of John Guldberg (vocals, guitar, bass) and Tim Stahl (vocals, keyboards, drums, bass). They are best known for the hits &quot;Sunshine Reggae&quot; and &quot;White Horse&quot; from 1983 and &quot;Bakerman&quot; from 1989.

==Background and origins==
John Guldberg and Tim Stahl met in the mid-1970s, and they played together in a group called the Starbox Band. After a poorly received show supporting the Kinks, the band split up, but the duo continued working together. Guldberg set up a small studio in downtown Copenhagen where the two musicians began exploring the possibilities that were being opened up by new technologies, such as multitrack tape recorders, synthesizers and drum machines.

==Recordings==
=== 1981–89 ===

Their debut album, simply titled &quot;Laid Back&quot;, was released in 1981, and the single &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Crazy&quot; became a number-one hit in Denmark.

The single &quot;Sunshine Reggae&quot;, released the next year, became another chart-topper in their home country; it was later included on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Keep Smiling&quot;, in 1983, and went on to become a number-one single in Italy, West Germany, and nineteen other countries around the world. In the US, however, it was the single&#x27;s B-side that became the band&#x27;s only big hit. &quot;White Horse&quot; is a funk-influenced dance track with a memorable bassline and ambiguous, drug- and/or sex-themed lyrics (&quot;white horse&quot; being a slang for heroin) that became popular in US clubs. After the song was re-released as an A-side on both 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl, it went on to spend three weeks at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s National Disco Action charts; it was also a crossover success, reaching the top five on the Hot Black Singles chart while peaking at number 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in early 1984. Its relatively poor performance on the Hot 100 is most likely due to the track&#x27;s controversial lyrics (including the word &quot;bitch&quot;), which prevented it from receiving radio airplay in much of the country. In 1989, the American rap act 2 Live Crew sampled &quot;White Horse&quot; heavily for their single &quot;Get the Fuck Out of My House&quot;; it was later sampled for Monifah&#x27;s 1998 hit &quot;Touch It&quot;.

Laid Back&#x27;s next two albums, &quot;Play It Straight&quot; (1985) and &quot;See You in the Lobby&quot; (1987), and singles such as &quot;Abu Dhabi&quot; and &quot;Tricky Kind of Thing&quot;, were released to little fanfare and limited chart success. 

The duo made a return to the European charts in 1989 with the single &quot;Bakerman&quot; (featuring Danish singer Hanne Boel), which peaked at number nine on the West German chart, and number 44 in the United Kingdom in early 1990. It was accompanied by an unusual video, directed by Lars von Trier, which featured the band skydiving while &quot;playing&quot; their instruments. Guldberg and Stahl have both named this their favourite Laid Back track, and said the words were written by Guldberg during the recording session for the song. The lyrics are in English except for the phrase &quot;Sagabona kunjani wena&quot;, which Guldberg has described as a Swahili phrase meaning &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;

Hoping to capitalize on the success of Bakerman, their label re-released &quot;White Horse&quot; (as &quot;White Horse &#x27;89&quot;) with new remixes, although this was a commercial disappointment.

===Later work===
Over the course of the following decades, Laid Back released several albums and singles. The duo also composed the soundtrack of the 2001 feature film &quot;Flyvende Farmor&quot;, for which they were awarded a Robert, the Danish equivalent of an Oscar. That same year, an exhibition of the band&#x27;s artwork, including pieces that appeared on their records and promotional posters, took place in Copenhagen. In 2003 they featured on the track &quot;Tango&quot; by Danish band Hæst, produced by Umpff. A remix of &quot;Bakerman&quot; by British DJ Shaun Baker reached number one in Greenland in 2006.

In 2010, &quot;Cocaine Cool&quot; was the first single to be released on Laid Back&#x27;s own label, Brother Music. It was followed by the mini album &quot;Cosyland&quot; and the instrumental album &quot;Cosmic Vibes&quot; in 2012. In 2013, Laid Back released the double album &quot;Uptimistic Music&quot;. 

In 2019, Laid Back received the prestigious Danish award &quot;Pioneer of the Year&quot; (Årets Steppeulv) for their many years of contribution to the international music scene. 2019 was a special year for Laid Back marking 40 years of making music in the same studio in Copenhagen, the studio where it all began. Laid Back celebrated their anniversary by releasing their 12th studio album &quot;Healing Feeling&quot;.

In 2023, Laid Back released the 21 track studio album, &quot;Road to Fame&quot;. For the second time in the band&#x27;s history, they released a song in their native language called &quot;Mig&quot; (&quot;Me&quot;). Their first song in danish was &quot;Flyvende Farmor&quot; (&quot;The flying granny&quot;) from 2001.

They continue to make sporadic live performances as well. In 2023, Laid Back made a guest performance at Roskilde Festival with Free Nationals.

==Legacy==
In 2008, the band MGMT performed a cover of the Laid Back song &quot;Roger&quot; on the &quot;Morning Becomes Eclectic&quot; music program on KCRW radio, and also played the song at concerts.

<doc id="604521" wikidata="Q17021681" url="?curid=604521" title="PPG 16">
<text>Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and Planning commonly abbreviated as PPG 16, was a document produced by the UK Government to advise local planning authorities in England and Wales on the treatment of archaeology within the planning process. It was introduced in November 1990 following public outcry after a number of high-profile scandals such as the threatened destruction of the Rose Theatre in London by developers. It replaced the earlier Circular 8/87 which was criticized for being ill-focused in both practical and geographical terms. On 23 March 2010 the Government published &#x27;Planning Policy Statement 5:Planning and the Historic Environment&#x27; replacing and cancelling PPG16 and PPG15 which had dealt with the rest of the historic environment.

==What PPG 16 says==

The document advised that archaeological remains are a finite and irreplaceable resource and that their presence should be a material consideration in applications for new development. It accepted that development will affect archaeological deposits and that this effect must be mitigated. PPG 16 stressed the importance of the evaluation of a site for its archaeological potential in advance of development in order to inform future management decisions. This evaluation may involve non intrusive methods such as a desk-based study or archaeological geophysics and/or a more direct method such as trial trenching.

Following the results of the initial evaluation, PPG 16 offered two solutions for preserving any significant archaeological deposits found to be on a development site. The first, and explicitly preferred, method involves preservation &quot;in situ&quot; whereby the archaeology is left untouched beneath a new development through methods such as adaptation of foundation design and architectural layout of the proposed new development, or by raising the level of the development with made ground so that its foundations do not reach the archaeological horizon. Where nationally important remains are encountered this method of preservation is strongly preferred.

If preservation &quot;in situ&quot; is not feasible then PPG 16 permitted preservation &quot;by record&quot;. This method involves archaeological fieldwork to excavate and record finds and features (thereby destroying them). This may involve a full excavation, further trenching in specific areas or an archaeological watching brief which involves an archaeologist monitoring groundworks for the new development and recording any finds or features revealed as construction continue.

==PPG 16 in practice==

All forms of archaeological investigation undertaken through PPG 16 are funded by the developer through an extension of the Polluter Pays principle, although this is not made explicit in the document itself. The work is intended to be undertaken in advance of any planning consent being granted but often happens to satisfy a planning condition placed on an application for development, that is once the principle of development on the land has already been established.

Because of the potential for destruction of significant remains, PPG 16 prefers evaluation to take place in advance of any planning decision being made. A developer tenders for the work to be done and chooses an archaeological organization to retain. The work is monitored by a curator, normally the County Archaeologist, who is nominated by the local planning authority as an adviser and who also identifies sites where archaeology might be threatened by development. Following submission of a satisfactory site report and demonstration that a site&#x27;s archaeological potential has been properly safeguarded and/or recorded, the curator will usually advise that development can continue.

Curators maintain a Historic Environment Record or HER, a database of known archaeological sites which is often used to inform decisions on archaeological potential. Areas of archaeological potential are often drawn on GIS maps which can indicate any potentially damaging development automatically.

PPG 16 has resulted in an explosion in archaeological fieldwork in the UK. Developer funding has led to dozens of archaeological organizations competing for work along with archaeological consultants working for developers to oversee projects. This has contributed to the growing professionalization of archaeology from its more &quot;ad hoc&quot; earlier incarnation as Rescue archaeology. Also, a wider variety of archaeological methods are now employed including surveys of large areas for the purposes of Historic Landscape Characterisation, deposit models and the production of regional archaeological research agendas.

==Criticism of PPG 16 and its effects==

Critics of PPG 16 argue that the commercialization of UK archaeology has resulted in more work of lower quality being undertaken, and that a shortage of county archaeologists to monitor this work allows consultants to exploit the situation. In recent years prices have been driven down by competing consultants who have unethical arrangements with archaeological contractors, who rather than performing the same job for a lower cost (as in true competitive tendering) are able to do a worse job. The increased volume of work has led to a backlog of unpublished site reports and homeless site archives awaiting resolution. The competition for work amongst archaeologists, and the fact that the developers funding them see no real use for their final product, also tends to drive prices down meaning that wages and conditions for archaeologists in the UK are generally far below the national average for equivalent professions with comparable levels of education. The irony is that the cost of this unworthy body of work, known as &quot;grey archaeology&quot;, borne by the construction industry benefits nobody but the consultants who have something to &quot;mitigate&quot; on behalf of their clients in the construction industry.

PPG 16 was only guidance to planners and did not have the full force of law. Its precepts could only be enforced through the Town and Country Planning Act and ultimate decisions on its implementation rested with the Secretary of State. However, without full legal status it lacked the power and reach of measures safeguarding similar environmental issues which are enshrined in law, such as those concerning endangered species.

==The theory of PPG 16==

Theoretically, the philosophical approach of PPG 16 was strongly based on processualism, especially following the publication of the &quot;de facto&quot; guidance manual for UK developer-led archaeology, English Heritage&#x27;s &quot;Management of Archaeological Projects&quot; (1991), popularly known as MAP 2. This stressed the importance of evaluation, documentation and decision-making at each stage of a project based on empirical evidence and valid hypotheses. From 2006 MAP2 was replaced by a more generic project management approach for the sector &quot;Management of Research Projects in the Historic Environment&quot; (MoRPHE) with a specific guidance &quot;Project Planning Note 3&quot; (MoRPHE PPN3) covering archaeological excavation. MoRPHE PPN3 retained the staged approach, with evaluation as a quality assessment technique that was applicable at any stage during an investigation.

==Associated guidance and the future==

A similar, though less stringent, guideline to PPG 16 exists for historic buildings and the wider historic environment called PPG 15. As of 2004 both documents are proposed to be combined into a single piece of guidance called a Planning Policy Statement.

<text>The Indian Navy is the maritime branch of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Navy. The Chief of Naval Staff, a four-star admiral, commands the navy. As a blue-water navy, it operates significantly in the Persian Gulf Region, the Horn of Africa, the Strait of Malacca, and routinely conducts anti-piracy operations and partners with other navies in the region. It also conducts routine two to three month-long deployments in the South and East China seas as well as in the western Mediterranean sea simultaneously.

The primary objective of the navy is to safeguard the nation&#x27;s maritime borders, and in conjunction with other Armed Forces of the union, act to deter or defeat any threats or aggression against the territory, people or maritime interests of India, both in war and peace. Through joint exercises, goodwill visits and humanitarian missions, including disaster relief, the Indian Navy promotes bilateral relations between nations. Since October 2008, the Indian Navy keeps at least one frontline warship on continuous deployment in the Gulf of Aden.

As of June 2019, the Indian Navy has 67,252 active and 75,000 reserve personnel in service and has a fleet of 150 ships and submarines, and 300 aircraft. As of September 2022, the operational fleet consists of 2 active aircraft carriers and 1 amphibious transport dock, 4 landing ship tanks, 8 landing craft utility, 12 destroyers, 12 frigates, 2 ballistic missile submarines, 16 conventionally-powered attack submarines, 18 corvettes, one mine countermeasure vessel, 4 fleet tankers and numerous other auxiliary vessels, small patrol boats and sophisticated ships. It is considered as a multi-regional power projection blue-water navy.

== History ==

===Early maritime history===


The maritime history of India dates back 6,000 years to the pre-Indus Valley civilisation. A Kutch mariner&#x27;s log book from 19th century recorded that the first tidal dock in India was built at Lothal around 2300 BC during the Indus Valley Civilisation, near the present-day harbor of Mangrol on the Gujarat coast. The Rig Veda credits Varuna, the Hindu god of water and the celestial ocean, with knowledge of the ocean routes and describes the use of ships having hundred oars in the naval expeditions by Indians. There are also references to the side wings of a ship called &quot;Plava&quot;, which stabilise the vessel during storms. &quot;Plava&quot; are considered to be the precursors of modern-day stabilisers.

Alexander the Great, during his campaigns in India, built a harbour at the ancient city of Patala, which has been hyphothzied to be the present day city of Thatta. His army retreated to Mesopotamia using ships built at Sindh. In the period after his conquest, records show that the Emperor of Maurya Empire, Chandragupta Maurya, as a part of his war office, established an Admiralty Division. Many historians from ancient India recorded Indian trade relations. Indian trade reached Java and Sumatra. There were also references to the trade routes of countries in the Pacific and Indian Ocean. India also had trade relations with the Greeks and the Romans. At one instance Roman historian Gaius Plinius Secundus mentioned Indian traders carrying away large masses of gold and silver from Rome, in payment for skins, precious stones, clothes, indigo, sandalwood, herbs, perfumes, and spices.

During 5–10 AD, Kalinga conquered Western Java, Sumatra and Malaya. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands served as an important halt point for trade ships en route to these nations and as well as China.

===Middle Ages===

Medieval Empires in the Indian subcontinent further developed their naval forces. During 844–848 AD the daily revenue from these nations was expected to be around 200 maunds () of gold. During 984–1042 AD, under the reign of Raja Raja Chola I, Rajendra Chola I and Kulothunga Chola I, a naval expedition by the Chola dynasty captured parts of Burma, Sumatra, Sri Lanka, and Malaya, and simultaneously repressed pirate activities by Sumatran warlords.

During the 14th and 15th centuries, Indian shipbuilding and maritime abilities skill set exceeded European capabilities at the time. Their ships could carry over a hundred crew and were compartmentalized to limit the effect of damage keeping the ship afloat.

===Decline===

By the end of 15th century Indian naval power had started to decline, and had reached its low by the time the Portuguese entered India. Soon after they set foot in India, the Portuguese started to seize all Asian vessels not permitting their trade. Amidst this, in 1529, a naval war at Bombay Harbour resulted in the surrender of Thane, Karanja, and Bandora. By 1534, the Portuguese took complete control over Bombay Harbour. The Zamorin of Calicut challenged the Portuguese trade when Vasco da Gama refused to pay the customs levy as per the trade agreement. This resulted in two major naval wars, the first one—Battle of Cochin, was fought in 1504, and the second engagement happened four years later off Diu. Both these wars exposed the weakness of Indian maritime power and simultaneously helped the Portuguese to gain mastery over the Indian waters. However, in 1526 the Zamorin launched the &quot;siege of Calicut&quot; on the Portuguese forts in Calicut, successfully eliminating Portuguese influence in the city.

===Later revival===

By the later seventeenth century Indian naval power revived. The Mughal Empire maintained a significant naval fleet although it was the weakest branch of the military. 

Empress Mariam-uz-Zamani maintained large fleets of trade ships including the &quot;Rahīmī&quot; and &quot;Ganj-i-Sawai&quot;. The Rahimi was the largest of the Indian ships trading in the Red Sea. After being sacked by pirates, this ship was replaced by the &quot;Ganj-i-Sawa.&quot; This ship was eventually sacked by English Pirate Henry Every.&quot;&quot; The Navy mainly patrolled coastal areas. The navy was active in the Siege of Hooghly and the Anglo-Mughal War. One of the best-documented naval campaign of the Mughal empire were provided during the conflict against kingdom of Arakan, where in December 1665, Aurangzeb dispatched Shaista Khan, his governor of Bengal to command 288 vessels and more than 20,000 men to pacify the pirate activities within Arakan territory and to capture Chittagong,

The Maratha Confederacy had a significant coastal navy. The alliance of the Moghuls and the Sidis of Janjira was marked as a major power on the west coast. On the southern front, the 1st Sovereign of the Maratha Kingdom, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, started creating his own fleet. His fleet was commanded by notable admirals like Sidhoji Gujar and Kanhoji Angre. The Maratha Navy under the leadership of Angre kept the English, Dutch and Portuguese away from the Konkan coast. However, the Marathas witnessed remarkable decline in their naval capabilities following the death of Angre in 1729.

The origins of the current Indian Navy date to 1612, when an English vessel under the command of Captain Thomas Best defeated the Portuguese at the Battle of Swally. Although the Portuguese were defeated, this incident along with the trouble caused by the pirates to the merchant vessels, forced the British to maintain fleet near Surat, Gujarat. East India Company (HEIC) formed a naval arm, and the first squadron of fighting ships reached the Gujarat coast on 5 September 1612. Their objective was to protect British merchant shipping off the Gulf of Cambay and up the Narmada and Tapti rivers. As the HEIC continued to expand its rule and influence over different parts of India, the responsibility of Company&#x27;s Marine increased too.

Over time, the British predominantly operated from Bombay, and in 1686, the HEIC&#x27;s naval arm was renamed the Bombay Marine. At times the Bombay Marine engaged Dutch, French, Maratha, and Sidi vessels. Much later, it was also involved in the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824.

===East India Company to independence===
In 1834, the Bombay Marine became Her Majesty&#x27;s Indian Navy. The Navy saw action in the First Opium War of 1840 and in the Second Anglo-Burmese War in 1852. Due to some unrecorded reasons, the Navy&#x27;s name reverted to the Bombay Marine from 1863 to 1877, after which it was named Her Majesty&#x27;s Indian Marine. At that time, the Marine operated in two divisions—the Eastern Division at Calcutta under the Superintendent of Bay of Bengal, and the Western Division at Bombay Superintendent of Arabian Sea. 
In 1892, the Marine was renamed the Royal Indian Marine, and by the end of the 19th century it operated over fifty ships. The Marine participated in World War I with a fleet of patrol vessels, troop carriers, and minesweepers. In 1928, D. N. Mukherji was the first Indian to be granted a commission, in the rank of an Engineer Sub-lieutenant. Also in 1928, the RIM was accorded combatant status, which entitled it to be considered a true fighting force and to fly the White Ensign of the Royal Navy. In 1934, the Marine was upgraded to a full naval force, thus becoming the Royal Indian Navy (RIN), and was presented the King&#x27;s colours in recognition of its services to the British Crown.

During the early stages of World War II, the tiny Royal Indian Navy consisted of five sloops, one survey vessel, one depot ship, one patrol vessel and numerous assorted small craft; personnel strength was at only 114 officers and 1,732 sailors. The onset of war led to an expansion in numbers of vessels and personnel. By June 1940, the navy had doubled its number in terms of both personnel and material, and expanded nearly six times of its pre-war strength by 1942. The navy was actively involved in operations during the war around the world and was heavily involved in operations around the Indian Ocean, including convoy escorts, mine-sweeping and supply, as well as supporting amphibious assaults.
When hostilities ceased in August 1945, the Royal Indian Navy had expanded to a personnel strength of over 25,000 officers and sailors. Its fleet comprised seven sloops, four frigates, four corvettes, fourteen minesweepers, sixteen trawlers, two depot ships, thirty auxiliary vessels, one hundred and fifty landing craft, two hundred harbour craft and several offensive and defensive motor launches. During World War II the Navy suffered two hundred and seventy five casualties—twenty seven officers, two warrant officers and 123 ratings killed in action, two ratings missing in action and a further 14 officers, two warrant officers and 123 ratings wounded. For their role in the war, the officers and ratings of the Navy received the following honours and decorations—a KBE (Mil.), a knighthood, a CB (Mil.), 10 CIEs, two DSOs, a CBE, 15 DSCs, an OBE, 28 DSMs, eight OBIs, two IOMs, 16 BEMs, 10 Indian Defence Service Medals, a Royal Humane Society Medal, 105 mentions in dispatches and 118 assorted commendations. Immediately after the war, the navy underwent a rapid, large-scale demobilisation of vessels and personnel.

From the inception of India&#x27;s naval force, some senior Indian politicians had voiced concerns about the degree of &quot;Indianisation&quot; of the Navy and its subordination to the Royal Navy in all important aspects. On the eve of WWII, the RIN had no Indian senior line officers and only a single Indian senior engineer officer. Even by the war&#x27;s end, the Navy remained a predominantly British-officered service; in 1945, no Indian officer held a rank above engineer commander and only a few Indian officers in the executive branch held substantive senior line officer rank. This situation, coupled with inadequate levels of training and discipline, poor communication between officers and ratings, instances of racial discrimination and the ongoing trials of ex-Indian National Army personnel ignited the Royal Indian Navy mutiny by Indian ratings in 1946. A total of 78 ships, 20 shore establishments and 20,000 sailors were involved in the strike, which spread over much of India. After the strike began, the sailors received encouragement and support from the Communist Party in India; unrest spread from the naval ships, and led to student and worker &quot;hartals&quot; in Bombay. The strike ultimately failed as the sailors did not receive substantial support from either the Indian Army or from political leaders in Congress or the Muslim League. On 21 July 1947, H.M.S. Choudhry and Bhaskar Sadashiv Soman, both of whom would eventually command the Pakistani and Indian Navies, respectively, became the first Indian RIN officers to attain the acting rank of captain.

===Independence to the end of the 20th century===
Following independence and the partition of India on 15 August 1947, the RIN&#x27;s depleted fleet of ships and remaining personnel were divided between the newly independent Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan. 21 per cent of the Navy&#x27;s officer cadre and 47 per cent of its sailors opted to join the portion of the fleet which became the Royal Pakistan Navy. The Indian share of the Navy consisted of 32 vessels along with 11,000 personnel. Effective from the same date, all British officers were compulsorily retired from the Navy and its reserve components, with Indian officers being promoted to replace British senior officers. However, a number of British flag and senior officers were invited to continue serving in the RIN, as only nine of the Navy&#x27;s Indian commissioned officers had more than 10 years&#x27; service, with the majority of them only having served from five to eight years. Rear Admiral John Talbot Savignac Hall headed the Navy as its first Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) post-Independence. In January 1948, D.N. Mukherji, the first Indian officer in the RIN, became the first Indian to be promoted acting engineer captain. In May 1948, Captain Ajitendu Chakraverti became the first Indian officer to be appointed to the rank of commodore. When India became a republic on 26 January 1950, the &quot;Royal&quot; prefix was dropped and the name &quot;Indian Navy&quot; was officially adopted. The prefix for naval vessels was changed from &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Indian Ship&quot; (HMIS) to &quot;Indian Naval Ship&quot; (INS). At the same time, the imperial crown in insignia was replaced with the Lion Capital of Ashoka and the Union Jack in the canton of the White Ensign was replaced with the Indian Tricolour.

By 1955, the Navy had largely overcome its post-Independence personnel shortfalls. During the early years following independence, many British officers continued to serve in the Navy on secondment from the Royal Navy, due to the post-Independence retirement or transfer of many experienced officers to the Royal or the Pakistan navies. The first C-in-C of the Navy was Admiral Sir Edward Parry who took over from Hall in 1948 and handed over to Admiral Sir Charles Thomas Mark Pizey in 1951. Admiral Pizey also became the first Chief of the Naval Staff in 1955, and was succeeded by Vice Admiral Sir Stephen Hope Carlill the same year The pace of &quot;Indianising&quot; continued steadily through the 1950s. By 1952, senior Naval appointments had begun to be filled by Indian officers, and by 1955, basic training for naval cadets was entirely conducted in India. In 1956, Ram Dass Katari became the first Indian flag officer, and was appointed the first Indian Commander of the Fleet on 2 October. On 22 April 1958, Vice Admiral Katari assumed the command of the Indian Navy from Carlill as the first Indian Chief of Staff of the Indian Navy. With the departure in 1962 of the last British officer on secondment to the Navy, Commodore David Kirke, the Chief of Naval Aviation, the Indian Navy finally became an entirely Indian service.

The first engagement in action of the Indian Navy was against the Portuguese Navy during the liberation of Goa in 1961. &quot;Operation Vijay&quot; followed years of escalating tension due to Portuguese refusal to relinquish its colonies in India. On 21 November 1961, Portuguese troops fired on the passenger liner &quot;Sabarmati&quot; near Anjadip Island, killing one person and injuring another. During Operation Vijay, the Indian Navy supported troop landings and provided fire support. The cruiser sank one Portuguese patrol boat, while frigates and destroyed the Portuguese frigate . The 1962 Sino-Indian War was largely fought over the Himalayas and the Navy had only a defensive role in the war.
At the outbreak of Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Navy had one aircraft carrier, two cruisers, nineteen destroyers and frigates, and one tanker. Of these twenty-ships ten were under refit. The others were largely involved coastal patrols. During the war, the Pakistani Navy attacked the Indian coastal city of Dwarka, although there were no military resources in the area. While this attack was insignificant, India deployed naval resources to patrol the coast and deter further bombardment. Following these wars in the 1960s, India resolved to strengthen the profile and capabilities of its Armed Forces.

The dramatic change in the Indian Navy&#x27;s capabilities and stance was emphatically demonstrated during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Under the command of Admiral Sardarilal Mathradas Nanda, the navy successfully enforced a naval blockade of West and East Pakistan. Pakistan&#x27;s lone long-range submarine was sunk following an attack by the destroyer off the coast of Visakhapatnam in the midnight of 3–4 December 1971. On 4 December, the Indian Navy successfully executed Operation Trident, a devastating attack on the Pakistan Naval Headquarters of Karachi that sank a minesweeper, a destroyer and an ammunition supply ship. The attack also irreparably damaged another destroyer and oil storage tanks at the Karachi port. To commemorate this, 4 December is celebrated as the Navy Day. This was followed by Operation Python on 8 December 1971, further deprecating the Pakistan Navy&#x27;s capabilities. Indian frigate , commanded by Captain M. N. Mulla was sunk by , while was damaged on the west coast. In the Bay of Bengal, the aircraft carrier was deployed to successfully enforce the naval blockade on East Pakistan. Sea Hawk and the Alizé aircraft from INS &quot;Vikrant&quot; sank numerous gunboats and Pakistani merchant marine ships. To demonstrate its solidarity as an ally of Pakistan, the United States sent Task Force 74 centred around the aircraft carrier into the Bay of Bengal. In retaliation, Soviet Navy submarines trailed the American task force, which moved away from the Indian Ocean towards Southeast Asia to avert a confrontation. In the end, the Indian naval blockade of Pakistan choked off the supply of reinforcements to the Pakistani forces, which proved to be decisive in the overwhelming defeat of Pakistan.

Since playing a decisive role in the victory, the navy has been a deterrent force maintaining peace for India in a region of turmoil. In 1983, the Indian Navy planned for Operation Lal Dora to support the government of Mauritius against a feared coup. In 1986, in Operation Flowers are Blooming, the Indian Navy averted an attempted coup in the Seychelles. In 1988, India launched Operation Cactus, to successfully thwart a coup d&#x27;état by PLOTE in the Maldives. Naval maritime reconnaissance aircraft detected the ship hijacked by PLOTE rebels. and Indian marine commandos recaptured the ship and arrested the rebels. During the 1999 Kargil War, the Western and Eastern fleets were deployed in the Northern Arabian Sea, as a part of &quot;Operation Talwar&quot;. They safeguarded India&#x27;s maritime assets from a potential Pakistani naval attack, and also deterred Pakistan from attempting to block India&#x27;s sea-trade routes. The Indian Navy&#x27;s aviators flew sorties and marine commandos fought alongside Indian Army personnel in the Himalayas.

In October 1999, the Navy along with the Indian Coast Guard rescued MV &quot;Alondra Rainbow&quot;, a pirated Japanese cargo ship.

===21st century onwards===
In the 21st century, the Indian Navy has played an important role in maintaining peace for India on the maritime front, in spite of the state of foment in its neighbourhood. It has been deployed for humanitarian relief in times of natural disasters and crises across the globe, as well as to keep India&#x27;s maritime trade routes free and open.

The Indian Navy was a part of the joint forces exercises, Operation Parakram, during the 2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff. More than a dozen warships were deployed to the northern Arabian Sea. 
In October, the Indian Navy took over operations to secure the Strait of Malacca, to relieve US Navy resources for Operation Enduring Freedom.

The navy plays an important role in providing humanitarian relief in times of natural disasters, including floods, cyclones and tsunamis. In the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the Indian Navy launched massive disaster relief operations to help affected Indian states as well as Maldives, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Over 27 ships, dozens of helicopters, at least six fixed-wing aircraft and over 5000 personnel of the navy were deployed in relief operations. These included Operation Madad in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, &quot;Operation Sea Waves&quot; in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, &quot;Operation Castor&quot; in Maldives, &quot;Operation Rainbow&quot; in Sri Lanka and &quot;Operation Gambhir&quot; in Indonesia. Gambhir, carried out following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, was one of the largest and fastest force mobilisations that the Indian Navy has undertaken. Indian naval rescue vessels and teams reached neighbouring countries less than 12 hours from the time that the tsunami hit. Lessons from the response led to decision to enhance amphibious force capabilities, including the acquisition of landing platform docks such as , as well as smaller amphibious vessels.

During the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, the Indian Navy launched Operation Sukoon and evacuated 2,280 persons from 20 to 29 July 2006 including 436 Sri Lankans, 69 Nepalese and 7 Lebanese nationals from war-torn Lebanon. In 2006, Indian naval doctors served for 102 days on board to conduct medical camps in the Philippines, Bangladesh, Indonesia and East Timor. In 2007, Indian Navy supported relief operations for the survivors of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh. In 2008, Indian Naval vessels were the first to launch international relief operations for victims of Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar. In 2008, the navy deployed and into the Gulf of Aden to combat piracy in Somalia. &quot;Tabar&quot; prevented numerous piracy attempts, and escorted hundreds of ships safely through the pirate-infested waters. The navy also undertook anti-piracy patrols near the Seychelles, upon that country&#x27;s request.

In February 2011, the Indian Navy launched Operation Safe Homecoming and rescued Indian nationals from war torn Libya. Between January–March, the navy launched &quot;Operation Island Watch&quot; to deter piracy attempts by Somali pirates off the Lakshadweep archipelago. This operation has had numerous successes in preventing pirate attacks. During the 2015 crisis in Yemen, the Indian Navy was part of Operation Raahat and rescued 3074 individuals of which 1291 were foreign nationals. On 15 April 2016, a Poseidon-8I long-range patrol aircraft managed to thwart a piracy attack on the high seas by flying over MV &quot;Sezai Selaha&quot;, a merchant vessel, which was being targeted by a pirate mother ship and two skiffs around from Mumbai.

India enacted its first domestic anti-piracy legislation as the Maritime Anti-Piracy Act 2022, on 20 December 2022 criminalizing maritime piracy and empowering the Indian Navy and other government agencies with the authority to respond to threats at sea. In 2024, Chief Admiral R. Hari Kumar referred to the new law as a &quot;great enabler&quot; in the navy&#x27;s anti-piracy success. That year, &quot;The Economic Times&quot; referred to the Indian Navy&#x27;s commitment in combating maritime piracy as &quot;unwavering&quot;.

In January 2024, the Indian Navy deployed over 10 warships under Operation Sankalp to protect commercial shipping in the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea in the wake of Houthi-led attacks on merchant vessels. Some of the ships deployed included guided missile destroyers like the INS Kolkata, INS Kochi, INS Chennai and INS Mormugao, as well as frigates like the INS Talwar and INS Tarkash. On 5 January, the INS Chennai prevented the hijacking of the Liberian merchant vessel MV Lila Norfolk. Although India declined to join the multinational US-led Operation Prosperity Guardian, the Indian Navy continued to share information and coordinate operations with the United States, United Kingdom, and France.

In May 2024, the Navy officially replaced the terms &quot;Jack&quot; and &quot;Jackstaff&quot; with &quot;National Flag&quot; and &quot;National Flag Staff&quot;. The words Jack and Jackstaff originates from the Royal Navy&#x27;s traditions which implies for national flag and the short pole on the bow of the ship to host the flag in &#x27;naval parlance&#x27;, respectively.

===Current role===

As of August 2015, the Indian Navy is classified as a Rank 3 navy (Power projection to regions adjacent to its own) on the Todd-Lindberg navy classification system of naval strength. The principal roles of the Indian Navy are:
* In conjunction with other Armed Forces of the Union, act to deter or defeat any threats or aggression against the territory, people or maritime interests of India, both in war and peace;
* Project influence in India&#x27;s maritime area of interest, to further the nation&#x27;s political, economic and security objectives;
* In co-operation with the Indian Coast Guard, ensure good order and stability in India&#x27;s maritime zones of responsibility.
* Provide maritime assistance (including disaster relief) in India&#x27;s maritime neighbourhood.

==Command and organisation==

===Organisation===
While the President of India serves as the Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces, the organisational structure of the Indian Navy is headed by the Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), who holds the rank of Admiral. While the provision for the rank of Admiral of the Fleet exists, no officer of the Indian Navy has yet been conferred this rank. The CNS is assisted by the Vice Chief of Naval Staff (VCNS), a Vice Admiral; the CNS also heads the Integrated Headquarters (IHQ) of the Ministry of Defence (Navy), based in New Delhi. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff (DCNS), a vice-admiral, is a Principal Staff Officer (PSO), along with the Chief of Personnel (COP) and the Chief of Materiel (COM), both of whom are also vice-admirals. The Director General Medical Services (Navy) is a Surgeon Vice-Admiral, heads the medical services of the Indian Navy.

The Indian Navy operates two operational commands and one training command. Each command is headed by a Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief (FOC-in-C) of the rank of Vice Admiral. The Eastern and Western commands each have a Fleet commanded by a Rear Admiral. The Western Fleet based at Mumbai is commanded by the Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet (FOCWF) and the Eastern Fleet, based at Visakhapatnam, is commanded by the Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet (FOCEF). Apart from the two fleets, there is a Flotilla each, based at Mumbai, Visakhapatnam and Port Blair, that provide Local Naval Defence in their respective regions.

The Eastern and Western commands each also have a Commodore commanding submarines (COMCOS) - the Commodore Commanding Submarines (East) and the Commodore Commanding Submarines (West). The Flag Officer Submarines, the single-point class authority for submarines is based at the Eastern Naval Command. The Southern Naval Command is home to the Flag Officer Sea Training (FOST).

Additionally, the Andaman and Nicobar Command is a unified Indian Navy, Indian Army, Indian Air Force, and Indian Coast Guard theater command based at the capital, Port Blair. Commander-in-Chief, Andaman and Nicobar Command (CINCAN) receives staff support from, and reports directly to the Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC) in New Delhi. The Command was set up in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2001.

===Facilities===
Indian Navy has its operational and training bases in Gujarat, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Lakshadweep, Kerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. These bases are intended for various purposes such as logistics and maintenance support, ammunition support, air stations, hospitals, MARCOS bases, coastal defence, missile defence, submarine and missile boat bases, forward operating bases etc. Of these, INS Shivaji is one of the oldest naval bases in India. Commissioned in February 1945 as HMIS Shivaji, it now serves as the premier Technical Training Establishment (TTE) of the Indian Navy.

In May 2005, the Indian Navy commissioned at Karwar, from Goa. Built under the first phase of the Project Seabird, at first it was an exclusively Navy controlled base without sharing port facilities with commercial shipping. The Indian Navy also has berthing rights in Oman and Vietnam. The Navy operates a monitoring station, fitted with radars and surveillance gear to intercept maritime communication, in Madagascar. It also plans to build a further 32 radar stations in Seychelles, Mauritius, Maldives and Sri Lanka. According to &quot;Intelligence Online&quot;, published by a France-based global intelligence gathering organisation, Indigo Publications, the Navy is believed to be operating a listening post in Ras al-Hadd, Oman. The post is located directly across from Gwadar Port in Balochistan, Pakistan, separated by approximately of the Arabian Sea.

The navy operates , a VLF and ELF transmission facility at Vijayanarayanapuram near Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu. INS &quot;Abhimanyu&quot; and are two bases dedicated for MARCOS. Project Varsha is a highly classified project undertaken by the Navy to construct a hi-tech base under the Eastern Naval Command. The base is said to house nuclear submarines and also a VLF facility.

===Training===
Indian Navy has a specialized training command which is responsible for organisation, conduct and overseeing of all basic, professional and specialist training throughout the Navy. The Commander in Chief of Southern Command also serves as the Commander in Chief of Training Command. The Chief of Personnel (CoP) at HQ of Indian Navy is responsible for the framework of training and exercises the responsibility through Directorate of Naval Training (DNT). The training year of Indian Navy is defined from 1 July to 30 June of the following year.

Seaman training is held at INS Chilika, Orissa.

Officer training is conducted at Indian Naval Academy (INA) at Ezhimala, on the coast of Kerala. Established in 2009, it is the largest naval academy in Asia. Cadets from National Defence Academy also move to INA for their later terms. The Navy also has specialized training establishments for gunnery, aviation, leadership, logistics, music, medicine, physical training, educational training, engineering, hydrography, submarines etc. at several naval bases along the coastline of India. Naval officers also attend the tri-service institutions National Defence College, College of Defence Management and Defence Services Staff College for various staff courses to higher command and staff appointments. The Navy&#x27;s War college is the Naval War College, Goa. A dedicated wing for naval architecture under Directorate of Naval Architecture at IIT Delhi is operated by the Navy. Indian Navy also trains officers and men from the navies of friendly foreign countries.

===Rank structure===

, the Navy has 10,393 officers and 56,835 sailors against a sanctioned strength of 11,827 officers and 71,656 sailors. This is inclusive of naval aviation, marine commandos and Sagar Prahari Bal personnel.

====Officers====
India uses the Midshipman rank in its navy, and all future officers carry the rank upon entering the Indian Naval Academy. They are commissioned Sub-lieutenants upon finishing their course of study.

While the provision for the rank of Admiral of the Fleet exists, it is primarily intended for major wartime use and honour. No officer of the Indian Navy has yet been conferred this rank. Both the Army and Air Force have had officers who have been conferred with the equivalent rank – Field Marshals Sam Manekshaw and Cariappa of the Army and Marshal of the Indian Air Force (MIAF) Arjan Singh.

The highest ranked naval officer in organisation structure is the Chief of Naval Staff, who holds the rank of admiral.

====Rating personnel====

In the Indian Navy, the sailors are initially listed as, Seaman 2nd class. As they grow through the ranks they attain the highest rank of enlisted personnel, Master chief petty officer 1st class. Sailors who possess leadership qualities and fulfill requisite conditions in terms of education, age etc. may be commissioned through Commission worthy and Special Duties (CW &amp; SD) scheme.
==== Navy MCPO ====

Indian Navy has appointed Rajendra Kumar Behera MCPO I as the first Navy MCPO on 1 May 2022.

===Naval Air Arm===
The naval air-arm of the Indian Navy currently operates twenty-one air squadrons. Of these, ten operate fixed-wing aircraft, eight are helicopter squadrons and the remaining three are equipped with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Building on the legacy inherited from the Royal Navy prior to Indian independence, the concept of naval aviation in India started with the establishment of Directorate of Naval Aviation at Naval Headquarters (NHQ) in early 1948. Later that year officers and sailors from the Indian Navy were sent to Britain for pilot training. In 1951, the Fleet Requirement Unit (FRU) was formed to meet the aviation requirements of the navy.

On 1 January 1953, the charge of Cochin airfield was handed over to the navy from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. On 11 March, the FRU was commissioned at Cochin with ten newly acquired Sealand aircraft. The navy&#x27;s first air station, INS &quot;Garuda&quot;, was commissioned two months later. From February 1955 to December 1958, ten Firefly aircraft were acquired. To meet the training requirements of the pilots, the indigenously developed HAL HT-2 trainer was inducted into the FRU. On 17 January 1959, the FRU was commissioned as Indian Naval Air Squadron (INAS) 550, to be the first Indian naval air squadron.

Currently the air arm operates an aircraft carrier INS &quot;Vikramaditya&quot; with ability to carry over thirty aircraft including MiG 29K, Kamov 31, Kamov 28, Sea King and domestic-built HAL-Dhruv and Chetak helicopters. The Kamov-31 choppers also provide the airborne early warning cover for the fleet. In the anti-submarine role, the Sea King, Ka-28, and the domestic built HAL Dhruv are used. The MARCOS also use Sea King and HAL Dhruv helicopters while conducting operations. Maritime patrol and reconnaissance operations are carried out by the Boeing P-8 Poseidon and the Ilyushin 38. Indian Navy is also procuring 24 Lockheed Martin MH-60R Multi Role Helicopters under the foreign military sales from the US.

The UAV arm consists of the IAI Heron and Searcher-IIs that are operated from both surface ships and shore establishments for surveillance missions.

The Indian Navy also maintains an aerobatic display team, the &quot;Sagar Pawan&quot;. The Sagar Pawan team will be replacing their present Kiran HJT-16 aircraft with the newly developed HJT-36 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;KIRAN MK 1/1A/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===MARCOS===

The Marine Commando Force (MCF), also known as &quot;MARCOS&quot;, is a special operations unit that was raised by the Indian Navy in 1987 for Amphibious warfare, Close Quarter Combat Counter-terrorism, Direct action, Special reconnaissance, Unconventional warfare, Hostage rescue, Personnel recovery, Combat search and rescue, Asymmetric warfare, Foreign internal defence, Counterproliferation, Amphibious reconnaissance including Hydrographic reconnaissance. Since their inception MARCOS proved themselves in various operations and wars, notable of them include Operation Pawan, Operation Cactus, UNOSOM II, Kargil War and Operation Black Tornado. They are also actively deployed on anti-piracy operations throughout the year.

==Equipment==

===Ships===


The names of all in service ships and naval bases of the Indian Navy are prefixed with the letters INS, designating &quot;Indian Naval Ship&quot; or &quot;Indian Navy Station&quot;, whereas the sail boats are prefixed with INSV (Indian Naval Sailing Vessel). The fleet of the Indian Navy is a mixture of domestic built and foreign vessels, , the surface fleet comprises 2 aircraft carriers, 1 amphibious transport dock, 7 landing ship tanks, 13 destroyers, 13 frigates, 20 corvettes, 10 large offshore patrol vessels, 4 fleet tankers, 7 Survey ships, 1 research vessel, 3 training vessels&lt;ref name=&quot;Tir Class, Sail Ships/Boats, Sagardhwani Class&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and various auxiliary vessels, Landing Craft Utility vessels, and small patrol boats.

The Navy has two aircraft carriers in active service, one of which is the INS &quot;Vikramaditya&quot;, which serves as the flagship of the fleet. &quot;Vikramaditya&quot; (formerly &quot;Admiral Gorshkov&quot;) is a modified procured at a total cost $2.3 billion from Russia in December 2013. A second aircraft carrier, the indigenously built INS &quot;Vikrant&quot; was commissioned on 2 September 2022. The Navy has an amphibious transport dock of the , renamed as INS &quot;Jalashwa&quot; in Indian service. It also maintains a fleet of landing ship tanks.

The navy currently operates three , three , three and three -class guided-missile destroyers. The ships of the &quot;Rajput&quot; class are being replaced by the next-generation s (Project 15B) which feature a number of improvements.

In addition to destroyers, the navy operates several classes of frigates such as three (Project 17 class) and six -class frigates. Seven additional modified &quot;Shivalik&quot;-class frigates (Project 17A class frigates) are on order, all of which are under various stages of construction. Smaller littoral zone combatants in service are in the form of corvettes, of which the Indian Navy operates the &quot;Kamorta&quot;, , , and corvettes. Replenishment tankers such as the &quot;Jyoti&quot;-class tanker, and the new help improve the navy&#x27;s endurance at sea.

====Submarines====

, the Navy&#x27;s sub-surface fleet includes two Arihant-class SSBN and 16 conventionally-powered attack submarines. The conventional attack submarines of the Indian Navy consist of five (French design), seven (Russian design), and the four (German Type 209/1500 design) classes.

India previously possessed a single -class nuclear-powered attack submarine named . She was leased to India for a period of ten years, between 2012 and 2021. Three hundred Indian Navy personnel were trained in Russia for the operation of these submarines. Negotiations are on with Russia for the lease of the second Akula-class submarine.

 was launched on 26 July 2009 in Visakhapatnam, and was secretly commissioned into active service in August 2016. The Navy plans to have six nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines in service in the near future. &quot;Arihant&quot; is both the first boat of the nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines and the first nuclear-powered submarine to be built in India.

India is planning to entirely modernise its submarine fleet. Initially, it was planned that 24 conventionally powered attack submarine would be acquired. First 12 submarines (6 Project 75 and 6 Project 75I) would be inducted by 2012 and the next 12 indigenous Project 76 submarines would be inducted by 2030. However, this was revised in 2015. Now, the planned numbers stand at 4 SSBNs, 6 SSNs and 18 conventionally powered attack submarines. The clearance for Project 75 Alpha submarines was approved by the Government on 18 February 2024. , the Navy&#x27;s planned acquisitions of submarines include :–

* 5 Arihant-class submarines (2 operational, 2 launched, 1 planned)
* 3 S5-class submarine
* 6 Project 75 Alpha-class nuclear attack submarines in 2 phases (also called Project 77 submarines)

===Weapon systems===


The Navy use a mix of indigenously developed and foreign made missile systems. These include submarine-launched ballistic missiles, ship-launched ballistic missiles, cruise and anti-ship missiles, air-to-air missiles, surface-to-air missiles, torpedoes, air-to-air guns, main guns and anti-submarine rocket launchers. Its inventory comprises AK 190 gun with a range of , KH-35E 4 Quad Uran, ASW RBU-2000 etc.

In recent years, BrahMos has been one of the most advanced missile system adapted by the Indian Navy. It has been jointly developed by India&#x27;s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russian NPO Mashinostroyeniya. BrahMos is the world&#x27;s fastest anti-ship cruise missile in operation. The BrahMos has been tailored to meet Indian needs and features a large proportion of India-designed components and technology, including its fire control systems, transporter erector launchers, and its onboard navigational attack systems. The successful test of Brahmos from provides Indian Navy with precision land attack capability.

India has also fitted its Boeing P-8I reconnaissance aircraft with all-weather, active-radar-homing, over-the-horizon AGM-84L Harpoon Block II missiles and Mk 54 All-Up-Round Lightweight Torpedoes. Indian warships&#x27; primary air-defence shield is provided by Barak 1 surface-to-air missile while an advanced version Barak 8 is in development in collaboration with Israel. India&#x27;s next-generation submarines will be armed with Exocet anti-ship missile system. Among indigenous missiles, ship-launched version of Prithvi-II is called Dhanush, which has a range of and can carry nuclear warheads.

The K-15 Sagarika (Oceanic) submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), which has a range of at least 700 km (some sources claim 1000 km) forms part of India&#x27;s nuclear triad and is extensively tested to be integrated with the &quot;Arihant&quot; class of nuclear submarines. A longer range submarine launched ballistic missile called K-4 is under induction process, to be followed by K-5 SLBM.

===Electronic warfare and systems management===

&quot;Sangraha&quot; is a joint electronic warfare programme between Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Navy. The programme is intended to develop a family of electronic warfare suites, for use on different naval platforms capable of detecting, intercepting, and classifying pulsed, carrier wave, pulse repetition frequency agile, frequency agile and chirp radars. The systems are suitable for deployment on various platforms like helicopters, vehicles, and ships. Certain platforms, along with ESM (Electronic Support Measures) capabilities, have ECM (Electronic Countermeasure) capabilities such as multiple-beam phased array jammers.

The Indian Navy also relies on information technology to face the challenges of the 21st century. The Indian Navy is implementing a new strategy to move from a platform centric force to a network centric force by linking all shore-based installations and ships via a high-speed data networks and satellites. This will help in increased operational awareness. The network is referred to as the Navy Enterprise Wide Network (NEWN). The Indian Navy has also provided training to all its personnel in Information Technology (IT) at the Naval Institute of Computer Applications (NICA) located in Mumbai. Information technology is also used to provide better training, like the usage of simulators and for better management of the force.

The Navy has a dedicated cadre for matters pertaining to information technology cadre named as Information Technology Cadre, under the Directorate of Information Technology (DRI). The cadre is responsible for implementation for enterprise wide networking and software development projects, development activities with respect to cyber security products, administration of shore and on-board networks, and management of critical Naval Networks and software applications.

===Naval satellite===
India&#x27;s first exclusive defence satellite GSAT-7 was successfully launched by European space consortium Arianespace&#x27;s rocket from Kourou spaceport in French Guiana in August 2013. GSAT-7 was fabricated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to serve for at least seven years in its orbital slot at 74°E, providing UHF, S-band, C-band and Ku-band relay capacity. Its Ku-band allows high-density data transmission, including both audio and video. This satellite also has a provision to reach smaller and mobile terminals.

GSAT-7 approximately has a footprint of over the Indian Ocean region, including both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal region. This enables the Navy to operate in a network-centric atmosphere having real-time networking of all its operational assets at sea and on land.

On 15 June 2019 the navy placed an order for GSAT-7R satellite as a replacement for GSAT-7. The satellite costs Rs 1589 crores (US$225.5 million) and is expected to be launched by 2020.

==Activities==
===Fleet reviews===
The President of India is entitled to inspect his/her fleet, as he/she is the supreme commander of the Indian Armed Forces. The first president&#x27;s fleet review by India was hosted by Rajendra Prasad on 10 October 1953. President&#x27;s reviews usually take place once in the President&#x27;s term. In all, twelve fleet reviews have taken place, including two International fleet reviews in 2011 and 2016. The latest fleet review was held in February 2022 at Visakhapatnam, by President Ram Nath Kovind.

The Indian Navy also conducted an International fleet review named &quot;Bridges of Friendship&quot; in February 2001 in Mumbai. Many ships of friendly Navies from all around the world participated, including two from the US Navy. The second international fleet review, the International Fleet Review 2016, was held off Visakhapatnam coast in February 2016 where Indian Navy&#x27;s focus was on improving diplomatic relations and military compatibility with other nations.

===Naval exercises===
India often conducts naval exercises (like Maritime Partnership Exercise) with other friendly countries designed to increase naval cooperation and also to strengthen cooperative security relationship. Some such exercises take place annually or biennially:

Coordinated patrols include: Indo–Thai CORPAT (28 editions), Indonesia–India CORPAT (33 editions), IMCOR with Myanmar (8 editions). The Indian Navy conducted a naval exercise with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy in 2003, and also sent ships to the South China Sea to participate in the fleet review. In 2005, TROPEX (Theatre-level Readiness Operational Exercises) was held during which Indian Navy experimented the doctrine of influencing a land and air battle to support the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force. TROPEX has been conducted annually every year with an exception to 2016. In 2007, Indian Navy conducted naval exercises with Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force and U.S. Navy in the Pacific, and also signed an agreement with Japan in October 2008 for joint naval patrolling in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2007, India conducted naval exercises with Vietnam, Philippines, and New Zealand. In 2007, India and South Korea conducted an annual naval exercise, alongside India&#x27;s participation in the South Korean International Fleet Review in 2008. The first Atlantic Ocean deployment of the Indian Navy happened in 2009. During this deployment, the Indian Naval fleet conducted exercises with the French, German, Russian and British navies. Once in two years navies from the Indian Ocean region meet at the Andaman and Nicobar Islands for the Exercise MILAN. In 2021 India assisted in US-led Exercise Cutlass Express as a trainer.

In 2007 India held the first Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) with an objective to provide a forum for all the littoral nations of the Indian Ocean to co-operate on mutually agreed areas for better security in the region. Since the past decade, Indian naval ships have made goodwill port calls to Israel, Turkey, Egypt, Greece, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Tonga, South Africa, Kenya, Qatar, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, and various other countries.

===Exploration===

The Indian Navy regularly conducts adventure expeditions. The sailing ship and training vessel began circumnavigating the world on 23 January 2003, intending to foster good relations with various other nations; she returned to India in May 2004 after visiting 36 ports in 18 nations.

Lt. Cdr. M. S. Kohli led the Indian Navy&#x27;s first successful expedition to Mount Everest in 1965; the Navy&#x27;s ensign was again flown atop Everest on 19 May 2004 by a similar expedition. Another Navy team also successfully scaled Everest from the north face, a technically more challenging route. The expedition was led by Cdr Satyabrata Dam of the submarine arm. Cdr. Dam is a mountaineer of international repute and has climbed many mountains including the Patagonias, the Alps among others. In 2017, to commemorate 50 years of the Navy&#x27;s first expedition in 1965, a team set off to climb Mount Everest.

An Indian Navy team comprising 11 members successfully completed an expedition to the Arctic pole. To prepare, they first traveled to Iceland, where they attempted to summit a peak. The team next flew to eastern Greenland; in the Kulusuk and Angmassalik areas, they used Inuit boats to navigate the region&#x27;s ice-choked fjords. They crossed northward across the Arctic Circle, reaching seventy degrees North on skis. The team scaled an unnamed peak of height and named it &quot;Indian Peak&quot;.

The Indian Naval ensign first flew in Antarctica in 1981. The Indian Navy succeeded in Mission Dakshin Dhruv 2006 by traversing to the South Pole on skis. With this historic expedition, they have set the record for being the first military team to have successfully completed a ski traverse to the Geographic South Pole. Also, three of the ten member team—the expedition leader—Cdr. Satyabrata Dam, leading medical assistants Rakesh Kumar and Vikas Kumar are now among the few people in the world to have visited the two poles and summited Mt. Everest. Indian Navy became the first organisation to reach the poles and Mt. Everest. Cdr. Dilip Donde completed the first solo circumnavigation by an Indian citizen on 22 May 2010. Cdr. Abhilash Tomy became the first Indian to complete a solo, non-stop circumnavigation of the world on a sailboat not fitted with any technology or navigational aids.

Navika Sagar Parikrama (lit. &#x27;Sailors&#x27; Sea Circumambulation&#x27;) was a circumnavigation of the globe by female officers of the Indian Navy. The six-member all-woman team circumnavigated and managed the whole operation in their first-ever global journey, with their ship that lasted 254 days. Navika Sagar Parikrama II is lead by two women officers.

==Future of the Indian Navy==
By the end of the 14th Plan (2020), the Indian Navy was expected to have over 150 ships and close to 500 aircraft. In addition to the existing mission of securing both sea flanks in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, the navy was tasked with responding to emergencies far away from the Indian mainland. Marine assault capabilities were to be enhanced by setting up a new amphibious warfare facility at Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh.

Since then, the Indian Navy has initiated Phase II expansion of INS Kadamba, its third largest naval base, near Karwar. Phase II will involve expansion of the berthing facilities to accommodate 40–45 more front-line warships, including the aircraft carrier INS &quot;Vikramaditya&quot;, raise manpower to 300 officers and around 2,500 sailors, and build a naval air station with a 6,000-foot runway. This is to be followed by Phase IIA and IIB, at the end of which INS Kadamba will be able to base 50 front-line warships. The Indian Navy is also in the process of constructing a new naval base, INS Varsha, at Rambilli for its Arihant class submarines.

India&#x27;s planned second aircraft carrier, INS &quot;Vishal&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Indigenous Aircraft Carrier-II&quot;), will displace around 65,000 tonnes and is expected to be delivered to the Indian Navy in the mid-2030s. With the future delivery of &quot;Vishal&quot;, the Navy&#x27;s goal to have three aircraft carriers in service, with two fully operational carriers and a third in refit, will be achieved.

In November 2011, the &quot;Defence Acquisition Council&quot; launched the Multi-Role Support Vessel. The Indian Navy has subsequently sent out an international RFP for up to 2 large landing helicopter docks. The contenders are expected to tie up with local shipyards for construction of the ships.

In addition to aircraft carriers and large amphibious assault ships, the Indian Navy is acquiring numerous surface combatants such as the and frigates, ASW shallow water corvettes, ASuW corvettes, and MCM vessels. It plans to build and Project 17B-class frigate. New submarine classes under various stages of planning include the Project 75 Alpha, Project 75I, and the nuclear-powered . New auxiliary ships include; five replenishment oilers, a Missile Range Instrumentation Ship (MRIS) and an Ocean Surveillance Ship.
In 2024, Sagar Defence Engineering Pvt Ltd demonstrated 850 nautical mile autonomous transit of, Matangi Autonomous Surface Vessel to the Indian Navy. The autonomous transit began from Mumbai and ended at Toothukudi. This demonstration was part of Indian Navy&#x27;s Swavalamban 2024 self reliance in technology contest to enable the development of autonomous vessels for various military applications. These boats are equipped with 12.7mm SRCG gun and is capable of day and night patrolling with speed above 50 knots. 12 such autonomous boats are to be acquired by the Indian Navy and will also be used to patrol Pangong Tso lake. The Indian Navy is also acquiring 30 autonomous underwater vehicles. The Indian Navy is planning to procure 22 General Atomics Sea Guardian drones at an estimated cost of $2 billion. This is the first instance of General Atomics drones being sold to a non-NATO military.

==Indian Naval Ensign==
The Indian Navy from 1950 to 2001 used a modified version of the British White Ensign, with the Union flag replaced with the Indian Tricolour in the canton. In 2001, this flag was replaced with a white ensign bearing the Indian Navy crest, as the previous ensign was thought to reflect India&#x27;s colonial past. However complaints arose that the new ensign was indistinguishable as the blue of the naval crest easily merged with the sky and the ocean. Hence in 2004, the ensign was changed back to the St. George&#x27;s cross design, with the addition of the emblem of India in the intersection of the cross. In 2014, the ensign as well as the naval crest was further modified to include the Devanagari script: &quot;सत्यमेव जयते&quot; (Satyameva Jayate) which means &#x27;Truth Alone Triumphs&#x27; in Sanskrit.

The traditional crest of Indian Navy ships is topped by a crown featuring three sailing ships symbolising India&#x27;s rich maritime history. The ribbon of the crown depicts the Ashoka Chakra surrounded by a horse and a bull. Each ship has a unique motif which is encircled by a ring of lotus buds.

In August 2022, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office announced that the naval ensign featuring the Saint George&#x27;s Cross would be irrevocably disposed of, in favour of a newer design derived from octagonal shaped imperial seal of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his Maratha Navy that would &quot;do away with the colonial past&quot; and reflect the &quot;rich Indian maritime heritage&quot;. The new ensign is slated to be revealed by prime minister Narendra Modi on 2 September 2022, coinciding with the commissioning ceremony of INS &quot;Vikrant&quot;, the Indian Navy&#x27;s first indigenously built aircraft carrier. The new ensign retains much the design of the 2001-04 ensign with the national flag as the canton, but with the addition of an octagonal navy blue shield based on Shivaji&#x27;s royal seal surrounding the heraldic arms in gold and the addition of the official motto of the Navy &quot;May the Lord of Waters Be Auspicious Unto Us&quot; (&quot;Shaṁ No Varunaḥ&quot;) in the Devanagari script.

== Documents ==
The Indian Maritime Doctrine is a foundational primer document of the Indian Navy. Three editions have been published in 2004, 2009 and 2014. It has to be considered along with other foundational documents such as the naval strategy &quot;Freedom to Use the Seas&quot; (2007) and the updated edition &quot;Ensuring Secure Seas (2015).&quot;

The 2004 edition (INBR 8) was published amidst a larger strategic overhaul in the country. It contains a large number of key words along with their definitions and grouped into a number of sections. Select themes pervade throughout the document. Some themes are subtle such as the ongoing and future transition to a blue-water navy and others are louder such as the text related to nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers. There is justification and explanation for India&#x27;s need for these transitions and acquisitions. The 2009 edition was updated to include counter-terror, counter-piracy and coordination with other navies in these aspects.

<text>National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) is an international association of evangelical communicators. While theologically diverse within the evangelical community, NRB members are linked through a Declaration of Unity that proclaims their joint commitment and devotion to Christianity.

==History==
In the early 1940s in America, the emerging culture of hostility between mainline Protestant denominations and the rapidly growing evangelical Protestant movement reached a crisis phase in the world of radio broadcasting. Protestant denominational leaders argued for regulations that would restrict access to the radio broadcast spectrum. They claimed independent Evangelical preachers who were unaccountable to any denominational entity could not be trusted with the public airwaves.

In those early years of radio broadcasting, pioneer Evangelical broadcasters like William Ward Ayer, Paul Rader, Donald Grey Barnhouse, Walter Maier, and Charles Fuller had built radio audiences in the millions and were faithfully proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ. By 1942, the Mutual Broadcasting System received more than 25% of its total revenue from religious broadcasters.

Yet in 1943, the Federal Council of Churches (later renamed the National Council of Churches) supported proposed regulations that would have resulted in every Evangelical broadcaster being taken off the national radio networks. They demanded that religious broadcasting should only be aired as a public service during free or &quot;sustaining&quot; time donated by the radio networks. They further argued that these public service slots should only be allocated to &quot;responsible&quot; religious broadcasters that had been approved by local and national denominational councils – like themselves.

The Federal Council of Churches persuaded all three national radio networks – NBC, CBS, and the Mutual Broadcasting System – to adopt the proposed regulations. Subsequently, every Evangelical Christian broadcaster was taken off the national radio networks, with their only access being small independent stations with a very limited audience.

In response to this challenge, 150 Evangelical Christian broadcasters and church leaders held a series of meetings which led to the formation of the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB). In the fall of 1944, members of the NRB adopted their Constitution, Bylaws, Statement of Faith, and Code of Ethics. And thus began a multi-year effort by NRB to build credibility for Evangelical broadcasters, to secure available public interest slots, and to overturn the ban on the purchase of radio airtime for religious broadcasting.

In 1949 the newly formed ABC radio network reversed the ban on paid religious broadcasting, with the other networks following their lead. In a few years, Evangelical radio broadcasters were again on major radio networks with scores of new programs.

The NRB now operates in a more complex electronic media environment, while retaining its original focus of defending and expanding access to electronic media platforms for Christian evangelism. And the audience for religious broadcasters has expanded, with 141 million Americans using Christian media at least once per month.

==Membership==

Members of the association are required to ascribe to the Statement of Faith and adhere to the NRB Code of Ethics. NRB members must also meet the Standards of Financial Accountability set forth by the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA).

==Governance==
NRB members elect a Board of Directors and five Officers for the association. The five Officers, along with five Members-At-Large elected from the board of directors, form an Executive Committee that governs the association.

==Controversy==
On 27 August 2021 NRB fired its senior vice president of communications, Daniel Darling, because he expressed support for the use of vaccines to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This was done in the midst of a precipitous rise in COVID-19 deaths blamed largely on low vaccination rates against the disease.

<text>Trisha Goddard, formerly called Trisha, is a British tabloid talk show hosted by Trisha Goddard. It initially aired on ITV in the mornings from 1998 to 2004 before moving to Channel 5, where it was broadcast until 2010. It was also shown on ITV&#x27;s digital channel ITV2 with a spin-off show called &quot;Trisha: Extra&quot; and a double bill of the main &quot;Trisha&quot; show every afternoon. The programme was moved to Channel 5 and aired from January 2005 to December 2010.

==Format==
The show started and ended taking over from Vanessa Feltz and the &quot;Vanessa&quot; show, after Feltz defected to the BBC. Initially, Trisha Goddard continued her predecessor&#x27;s tradition of light-hearted debate, on subjects such as men who wore women&#x27;s clothes. Goddard would also interview ordinary people in the news.

However, from around 2001 the show began modelling itself on &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, which at the time had a following in the UK. More and more, &quot;Trisha&quot; began to focus on working-class or underclass guests and their numerous problems. These were usually to do with infidelity and/or paternity issues, but other subjects covered included troublesome teenagers or surprise family reunions.

Goddard hosts the programme, which is well known for the conducting of lie detector tests and DNA tests, the results of which are then revealed on air. Robert Phipps, a body language expert, frequently guests on the show.

&quot;Trisha&quot; has frequently been accused of exploiting its subjects plus copying American formats such as &quot;The Maury Povich Show&quot;. Verbal abuse and physical fights between guests sometimes break out on the show, the latter are never shown. Instead the camera cuts to the audience or Trisha herself until her security team restores order.

==Dispute==
&quot;Trisha&quot; ceased production in 2004, when ITV refused to allow Trisha&#x27;s own TV production company, Town House TV, to make future episodes of the show. She decided not to renew her contract and moved to rival broadcaster Channel 5 to present a similar series. The new programme, &quot;Trisha Goddard&quot;, was made by Town House TV. ITV mounted a successful spoiler campaign against Trisha&#x27;s new series; they stockpiled their remaining episodes of &quot;Trisha&quot; until the launch date of &quot;Trisha Goddard&quot;.

When ITV finally ran out of &quot;Trisha&quot; episodes, Channel 5 began running &quot;Trisha Goddard&quot;. From 16 October 2006, it has been seen on both Channel 5 and then in a double-bill on its new female-oriented digital channel Fiver (formerly Five Life).

&quot;Trisha Goddard&quot; launched on Channel 5 on Monday 24 January 2005, but it was shown in the afternoons and not directly opposite ITV&#x27;s series. ITV did, however, schedule a double bill of Trisha on ITV2 to clash with the series on Channel 5. The first &quot;Trisha Goddard&quot; gained 500,000 viewers on Channel 5, significantly fewer than the 1.3 million viewers who watched ITV&#x27;s show.

Trisha took some of her &quot;experts&quot; with her to Channel 5, including counsellor advisor on Aftercare for show and Psychological factors Ricky Maczka, Robert Phipps and head security guard Pete. Others, such as counsellor Claire Evans and polygraph expert Bruce Burgess, stayed with ITV to work on its successor show, &quot;The Jeremy Kyle Show&quot;.

The show production base was moved from the ITV Anglia studios in Norwich to The Maidstone Studios in Kent.

On 9 January 2009, Channel 5 announced that Trisha Goddard had been cancelled. The channel blamed the &quot;current economic climate&quot; for the &quot;difficult decision&quot;.

==&quot;Trisha: Extra&quot;==
&quot;Trisha: Extra&quot; was a spin-off show broadcast on ITV&#x27;s digital sibling channel ITV2, with the first edition broadcast on 4 November 2002, as part of an extended morning lineup on the channel.

==American version==

In July 2011, it was announced that NBCUniversal Television Distribution will bring Goddard to the United States to launch an American version of her program, which would follow the same concept as her British version. The American version was picked up by NBC O&amp;O&#x27;s and other stations owned by Sinclair Broadcasting Group and launched in September 2012. The show ran for three seasons before being cancelled.
