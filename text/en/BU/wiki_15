<text>An insurgency is a violent, armed rebellion by small, lightly armed bands who practice guerrilla warfare against a larger authority. The key descriptive feature of insurgency is its asymmetric nature: small irregular forces face a large, well-equipped, regular military force state adversary. Due to this asymmetry, insurgents avoid large-scale direct battles, opting instead to blend in with the civilian population (often in rural areas) where they gradually expand territorial control and military forces. Insurgency frequently hinges on control of and collaboration with local populations.

An insurgency can be fought via counter-insurgency warfare, as well as other political, economic and social actions of various kinds. Due to the blending of insurgents with the civilian population, insurgencies tend to involve considerable violence against civilians (by the state and the insurgents). State attempts to quell insurgencies frequently lead to the infliction of indiscriminate violence, whereas rebel control of territory frequently involves violence against the civilian population. Insurgency sets itself apart from terrorism by aiming for political control rather than resorting to indiscriminate violence, however, it may incorporate terrorist tactics.

Where a revolt takes the form of armed rebellion, it may not be viewed as an insurgency if a state of belligerency exists between one or more sovereign states and rebel forces. For example, during the American Civil War, the Confederate States of America was not recognized as a sovereign state, but it was recognized as a belligerent power, and thus Confederate warships were given the same rights as United States warships in foreign ports.

Sometimes there may be two or more simultaneous insurgencies (multipolar) occurring in a country. The Iraq insurgency is one example of a recognized government versus multiple groups of insurgents. Other historic insurgencies, such as the Russian Civil War, have been multipolar rather than a straightforward model made up of two sides. During the Angolan Civil War there were two main sides: MPLA and UNITA. At the same time, there was another separatist movement for the independence of the Cabinda region headed up by FLEC. Multipolarity extends the definition of insurgency to situations where there is no recognized authority, as in the Somali Civil War, especially the period from 1998 to 2006, where it broke into quasi-autonomous smaller states, fighting among one another in changing alliances.

==Definition==

James Fearon and David Laitin define insurgency as &quot;a technology of military conflict characterized by small, lightly armed bands practicing guerrilla warfare from rural base areas.&quot; Austin Long defines insurgency as &quot;the use of political and military means by irregular forces to change an existing political order. These forces typically mingle with civilians in order to hide from the forces defending the political order.&quot; According to Matthew Adam Kocher, Thomas Pepinsky and Stathis Kalyvas, a central objective in insurgencies is to achieve control over civilians. To exercise control armed groups apply a variety of practices, including different types of violence, dispute resolution, taxation, regulation of movement, access to aid and services, and social strictures.

== Insurgency and civil wars ==
According to James D. Fearon, wars have a rationalist explanation behind them, which explains why leaders prefer to gamble in wars and avoid peaceful bargains. Fearon states that intermediate bargains can be a problem because countries cannot easily trade territories with the spread of nationalism. Furthermore, wars can take the form of civil wars. In her article &quot;Why Bad Governance Leads to Civil Wars,&quot; Barbara F. Walter has presented a theory that explains the role of strong institutions in preventing insurgencies that can result in civil wars. Walter believes that institutions can contribute to four goals.

Institutions are responsible for checking the government, creating multiple peaceful routes to help the government solve problems, making the government committed to political terms that entails preserving peace, and creating an atmosphere where rebels do not need to form militias. Furthermore, Walter adds that if there is a conflict between the government and the insurgents in the form of a civil war, that can bring about a new government that is accountable to a wider range of people, who have to commit to a compromise in political bargains. According to Walter, the presence of strong influential institutions can be beneficial to prevent the repetition of civil wars, but autocratic governments are less likely to accept the emergence of strong institutions because of their resulting constraint of governmental corruption and privileges.

In her book, &quot;Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in Salvador&quot;, Elisabeth Jean Wood explains that participants in high-risk activism are very aware of the costs and benefits of engaging in civil wars. Wood suggests that &quot;participants in the 1964 Freedom Summer campaign in the US South ran high risks of bodily harm in challenging the long-standing practices of racial exclusion in Mississippi.&quot; There are many selective incentives that encourage insurgency and violent movements against autocratic political regimes. For example, the supply of safety as a material good can be provided by the insurgents, which abolishes the exploitation of the government and thus forms one of the main incentives. The revolutionary power can help manifest a social-political network that in return provides access to political opportunities to diverse candidates, who share a collective identity and cultural homogeneity. Also, civil wars and insurgencies can provide employment and access to services and resources that were once taken over by the autocratic regimes.

==Tactics==

Insurgencies differ in their use of tactics and methods. In a 2004 article, Robert R. Tomes spoke of four elements that &quot;typically encompass an insurgency&quot;:
#cell-networks that maintain secrecy
#terrorism used to foster insecurity among the population and drive them to the insurgents for protection
#multifaceted attempts to cultivate support in the general population, often by undermining the new regime
#attacks against the government

Tomes&#x27; is an example of a definition that does not cover all insurgencies. For example, the French Revolution had no cell system, and in the American Revolution, little to no attempt was made to terrorize civilians. In consecutive coups in 1977 and 1999 in Pakistan, the initial actions focused internally on the government rather than on seeking broad support. While Tomes&#x27; definition fits well with Mao&#x27;s Phase I, it does not deal well with larger civil wars. Mao does assume terrorism is usually part of the early phases, but it is not always present in revolutionary insurgency.

Tomes offers an indirect definition of insurgency, drawn from Trinquier&#x27;s definition of counterinsurgency: &quot;an interlocking system of actions—political, economic, psychological, military—that aims at the [insurgents&#x27; intended] overthrow of the established authority in a country and its replacement by another regime.&quot;

Steven Metz observes that past models of insurgency do not perfectly fit modern insurgency, in that current instances are far more likely to have a multinational or transnational character than those of the past. Several insurgencies may belong to more complex conflicts, involving &quot;third forces (armed groups which affect the outcome, such as militias) and fourth forces (unarmed groups which affect the outcome, such as international media), who may be distinct from the core insurgents and the recognized government. While overt state sponsorship becomes less common, sponsorship by transnational groups is more common. &quot;The nesting of insurgency within complex conflicts associated with state weakness or failure...&quot; (See the discussion of failed states below.) Metz suggests that contemporary insurgencies have far more complex and shifting participation than traditional wars, where discrete belligerents seek a clear strategic victory.

===Terrorism===

Many insurgencies include terrorism. While there is no accepted definition of terrorism in international law, United Nations-sponsored working definitions include one drafted by Alex P. Schmid for the Policy Working Group on the United Nations and Terrorism. Reporting to the Secretary-General in 2002, the Working Group stated the following:
Yet another conflict of definitions involves insurgency versus terrorism. The winning essay of the 24th Annual United States Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Strategic Essay Contest, by Michael F. Morris, said [A pure terrorist group] &quot;may pursue political, even revolutionary, goals, but their violence replaces rather than complements a political program.&quot; Morris made the point that the use, or non-use, of terrorism does not define insurgency, &quot;but that organizational traits have traditionally provided another means to tell the two apart. Insurgencies normally field fighting forces orders of magnitude larger than those of terrorist organizations.&quot; Insurgencies have a political purpose, and may provide social services and have an overt, even legal, political wing. Their covert wing carries out attacks on military forces with tactics such as raids and ambushes, as well as acts of terror such as attacks that cause deliberate civilian casualties.

Mao considered terrorism a basic part of his first part of the three phases of revolutionary warfare. Several insurgency models recognize that completed acts of terrorism widen the security gap; the Marxist guerrilla theoretician Carlos Marighella specifically recommended acts of terror, as a means of accomplishing something that fits the concept of opening the security gap. Mao considered terrorism to be part of forming a guerrilla movement.

===Subversion===

While not every insurgency involves terror, most involve an equally hard to define tactic, subversion. &quot;When a country is being subverted it is not being outfought; it is being out-administered. Subversion is literally administration with a minus sign in front.&quot; The exceptional cases of insurgency without subversion are those where there is no accepted government that is providing administrative services.

While the term &quot;subversion&quot; is less commonly used by current U.S. spokesmen, that may be due to the hyperbolic way it was used in the past, in a specifically anticommunist context. U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk did in April 1962, when he declared that urgent action was required before the &quot;enemy&#x27;s subversive politico-military teams find fertile spawning grounds for their fish eggs.&quot;

In a Western context, Rosenau cites a British Secret Intelligence Service definition as &quot;a generalized intention to (&quot;emphasis added&quot;) &quot;&quot;overthrow&quot; or &quot;undermine&quot; parliamentary democracy by political, industrial or violent means.&quot; While insurgents do not necessarily use terror, it is hard to imagine any insurgency meeting its goals without undermining aspects of the legitimacy or power of the government or faction it opposes. Rosenau mentions a more recent definition that suggests subversion includes measures short of violence, which still serve the purposes of insurgents. Rarely, subversion alone can change a government; this arguably happened in the liberalization of Eastern Europe. To the Communist government of Poland, Solidarity appeared subversive but not violent.

==Political rhetoric, myths and models==
In arguing against the term Global War on Terror, Francis Fukuyama said the United States was not fighting terrorism generically, as in Chechnya or Palestine. Rather, he said the slogan &quot;war on terror&quot; is directed at &quot;radical Islamism, a movement that makes use of culture for political objectives.&quot; He suggested it might be deeper than the ideological conflict of the Cold War, but it should not be confused with Samuel Huntington&#x27;s &quot;clash of civilizations.&quot; Addressing Huntington&#x27;s thesis, Fukuyama stressed that the US and its allies need to focus on specific radical groups rather than clash with global Islam.

Fukuyama argued that political means, rather than direct military measures, are the most effective ways to defeat that insurgency. David Kilcullen wrote &quot;We must distinguish Al Qa&#x27;eda and the broader militant movements it symbolises – entities that use terrorism – from the tactic of terrorism itself.&quot;

There may be utility in examining a war not specifically on the tactic of terror but in co-ordination among multiple national or regional insurgencies. It may be politically infeasible to refer to a conflict as an &quot;insurgency&quot; rather than by some more charged term, but military analysts, when concepts associated with insurgency fit, should not ignore those ideas in their planning. Additionally, the recommendations can be applied to the strategic campaign, even if it is politically unfeasible to use precise terminology. Insurgent groups often struggle to maintain coherency and authority due to their decentralized nature, and thus rely heavily upon ethnic, religious, or ideological bounds to avoid splintering.

While it may be reasonable to consider transnational insurgency, Anthony Cordesman points out some of the myths in trying to have a worldwide view of terror:
*Cooperation can be based on trust and common values: one man&#x27;s terrorist is another man&#x27;s freedom fighter.
*A definition of terrorism exists that can be accepted by all.
*Intelligence can be freely shared.
*Other states can be counted on to keep information secure and use it to mutual advantage.
*International institutions are secure and trustworthy.
*Internal instability and security issues do not require compartmentation and secrecy at national level.
*The &quot;war on terrorism&quot; creates common priorities and needs for action.
*Global and regional cooperation is the natural basis for international action.
*Legal systems are compatible enough for cooperation.
*Human rights and rule of law differences do not limit cooperation.
*Most needs are identical.
*Co-operation can be separated from financial needs and resources.

Social scientists, soldiers, and sources of change have been modeling insurgency for nearly a century if one starts with Mao. Counterinsurgency models, not mutually exclusive from one another, come from Kilcullen, McCormick, Barnett and Eizenstat. Kilcullen describes the &quot;pillars&quot; of a stable society, while Eizenstat addresses the &quot;gaps&quot; that form cracks in societal stability. McCormick&#x27;s model shows the interplay among the actors: insurgents, government, population and external organizations. Barnett discusses the relationship of the country with the outside world, and Cordesman focuses on the specifics of providing security.

Recent studies have tried to model the conceptual architecture of insurgent warfare using computational and mathematical modelling. A recent study by Juan Camilo Bohorquez, Sean Gourley, Alexander R. Dixon, Michael Spagat, and Neil F. Johnson entitled &quot;Common Ecology Quantifies Human Insurgency&quot;, suggests a common structure for 9 contemporary insurgent wars, supported on statistical data of more than 50,000 insurgent attacks. The model explains the recurrent statistical pattern found in the distribution of deaths in insurgent and terrorist events.

===Kilcullen&#x27;s pillars===

Kilcullen describes a framework for counterinsurgency. He gives a visual overview of the actors in his model of conflicts, which he represents as a box containing an &quot;ecosystem&quot; defined by geographic, ethnic, economic, social, cultural, and religious characteristics. Inside the box are, among others, governments, counterinsurgent forces, insurgent leaders, insurgent forces, and the general population, which is made up of three groups: 
#those committed to the insurgents;
#those committed to the counterinsurgents;
#those who simply wish to get on with their lives.

Often, but not always, states or groups that aid one side or the other are outside the box. Outside-the-box intervention has dynamics of its own.

The counterinsurgency strategy can be described as efforts to end the insurgency by a campaign developed in balance along three &quot;pillars&quot;: security, political, and economical.

&quot;Obviously enough, you cannot command what you do not control. Therefore, &quot;unity of command&quot; (between agencies or among government and non-government actors) means little in this environment.&quot; Unity of command is one of the axioms of military doctrine that change with the use of swarming:. In Edwards&#x27; swarming model, as in Kilcullen&#x27;s mode, unity of command becomes &quot;&quot;unity of effort&quot; at best, and collaboration or deconfliction at least.&quot;

As in swarming, in Kilcullen&#x27;s view unity of effort &quot;depends less on a shared command and control hierarchy, and more on a shared diagnosis of the problem (i.e., the distributed knowledge of swarms), platforms for collaboration, information sharing and deconfliction. Each player must understand the others&#x27; strengths, weaknesses, capabilities and objectives, and inter-agency teams must be structured for versatility (the ability to perform a wide variety of tasks) and agility (the ability to transition rapidly and smoothly between tasks).&quot;

===Eizenstat and closing gaps===
Insurgencies, according to Stuart Eizenstat grow out of &quot;gaps&quot;. To be viable, a state must be able to close three &quot;gaps&quot;, of which the first is most important:
*Security: protection &quot;... against internal and external threats, and preserving sovereignty over territory. If a government cannot ensure security, rebellious armed groups or criminal nonstate actors may use violence to exploit this security gap—as in Haiti, Nepal, and Somalia.&quot;
*Capacity: the survival needs of water, electrical power, food and public health, closely followed by education, communications and a working economic system. &quot;An inability to do so creates a capacity gap, which can lead to a loss of public confidence and then perhaps political upheaval. &quot;In most environments, a capacity gap coexists with—or even grows out of—a security gap.&quot; In Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, segments of the population are cut off from their governments because of endemic insecurity. And in postconflict Iraq, critical capacity gaps exist despite the country&#x27;s relative wealth and strategic importance.&quot;
*Legitimacy: closing the legitimacy gap is more than an incantation of &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;elections&quot;, but a government that is perceived to exist by the consent of the governed, has minimal corruption, and has a working law enforcement and judicial system that enforce human rights.

Note the similarity between Eizenstat&#x27;s gaps and Kilcullen&#x27;s three pillars. In the table below, do not assume that a problematic state is unable to assist less developed states while closing its own gaps.

===McCormick Magic Diamond===
McCormick&#x27;s model is designed as a tool for counterinsurgency (COIN), but develops a symmetrical view of the required actions for both the Insurgent and COIN forces to achieve success. In this way the counterinsurgency model can demonstrate how both the insurgent and COIN forces succeed or fail. The model&#x27;s strategies and principle apply to both forces, therefore the degree the forces follow the model should have a direct correlation to the success or failure of either the Insurgent or COIN force.
The model depicts four key elements or players:
#Insurgent force
#Counterinsurgency force (i.e., the government)
#Population
#International community

All of these interact, and the different elements have to assess their best options in a set of actions:
#Gaining support of the population
#Disrupt opponent&#x27;s control over the population
#Direct action against opponent
#Disrupt opponent&#x27;s relations with the international community
#Establish relationships with the international community

===Barnett and connecting to the core===
In Thomas Barnett&#x27;s paradigm, the world is divided into a &quot;connected core&quot; of nations enjoying a high level of communications among their organizations and individuals, and those nations that are disconnected internally and externally. In a reasonably peaceful situation, he describes a &quot;system administrator&quot; force, often multinational, which does what some call &quot;nation-building&quot;, but, most importantly, connects the nation to the core and empowers the natives to communicate—that communication can be likened to swarm coordination. If the state is occupied, or in civil war, another paradigm comes into play: the leviathan, a first-world military force that takes down the opposition regular forces. Leviathan is not constituted to fight local insurgencies, but major forces. Leviathan may use extensive swarming at the tactical level, but its dispatch is a strategic decision that may be made unilaterally, or by an established group of the core such as NATO or ASEAN.

===Cordesman and security===
Other than brief &quot;Leviathan&quot; takedowns, security building appears to need to be regional, with logistical and other technical support from more developed countries and alliances (e.g., ASEAN, NATO). Noncombat military assistance in closing the security gap begins with training, sometimes in specialized areas such as intelligence. More direct, but still noncombat support, includes intelligence, planning, logistics and communications.

Anthony Cordesman notes that security requirements differ by region and state in region. Writing on the Middle East, he identified different security needs for specific areas, as well as the US interest in security in those areas.
* In North Africa, the US focus should be on security cooperation in achieving regional stability and in counterterrorism.
* In the Levant, the US must largely compartment security cooperation with Israel and cooperation with friendly Arab states like Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon, but can improve security cooperation with all these states.
* In the Persian Gulf, the US must deal with the strategic importance of a region whose petroleum and growing gas exports fuel key elements of the global economy.

It is well to understand that counterterrorism, as used by Cordesman, does not mean using terrorism against the terrorism, but an entire spectrum of activities, nonviolent and violent, to disrupt an opposing terrorist organization. The French general, Joseph Gallieni, observed, while a colonial administrator in 1898,
Both Kilcullen and Eizenstat define a more abstract goal than does Cordesman. Kilcullen&#x27;s security pillar is roughly equivalent to Eizenstat&#x27;s security gap:
* Military security (securing the population from attack or intimidation by guerrillas, bandits, terrorists or other armed groups)
* Police security (community policing, police intelligence or &quot;Special Branch&quot; activities, and paramilitary police field forces).
* Human security, building a framework of human rights, civil institutions and individual protections, public safety (fire, ambulance, sanitation, civil defense) and population security.

Anthony Cordesman, while speaking of the specific situation in Iraq, makes some points that can be generalized to other nations in turmoil. Cordesman recognizes some value in the groupings in Samuel P. Huntington&#x27;s idea of the clash of civilizations, but, rather assuming the civilizations must clash, these civilizations simply can be recognized as actors in a multinational world. In the case of Iraq, Cordesman observes that the burden is on the Islamic civilization, not unilaterally the West, if for no other reason that the civilization to which the problematic nation belongs will have cultural and linguistic context that Western civilization cannot hope to equal.

The heart of strengthening weak nations must come from within, and that heart will fail if they deny that the real issue is the future of their civilization, if they tolerate religious, cultural or separatist violence and terrorism when it strikes at unpopular targets, or if they continue to try to export the blame for their own failures to other nations, religions, and cultures.

=== Asymmetric and irregular conflicts ===
Asymmetric conflicts (or irregular conflicts), as the emerging type of insurgencies in recent history, is described by Berman and Matanock in their review as conflicts where &quot;the government forces have a clear advantage over rebels in coercive capacity.&quot; In this kind of conflicts, rebel groups can reintegrate into the civilian population after an attack if the civilians are willing to silently accept them. Some of the most recent examples include the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. As the European countries intervenes in the conflicts, creating asymmetry between the government forces and rebels, asymmetric conflict is the most common form of subnational conflicts and the most civil conflicts where the western countries are likely to be involved. Such interventions and their impacts can be seen in the NATO operation in Libya in 2011 and the French-led intervention in Mali in 2013.

Berman and Matanock suggested an &quot;information-centric&quot; framework to describe asymmetric conflicts on a local level. Three parties are involved in framework: government forces, rebels and civilians. Government forces and rebels attack each other and may inadvertently harm civilians whereas civilians can &quot;anonymously&quot; share local information with government forces, which would allow government forces to effectively use their asymmetric advantage to target rebels. Taking the role of civilians in this framework into consideration, the government and rebels will divert resources to provide services to civilians so as to influence their decision about sharing information with the government.

The framework is based on several assumptions:
* The consequential action of civilians is information sharing.
* Information can be shared anonymously without endangering the civilians who do so and civilians are assumed to respond to incentives.
* Neither side of government forces and rebels will actively target civilians with coercion or intimidation.
This framework leads to five major implications for counterinsurgency strategies:
# The government and rebels have an incentive to provide services to civilians, which increases with the value of the information shared.
# Rebel violence may be reduced by service provision from the government.
#* Projects that address the needs of the civilians in the local communities and conditioned on information sharing by the community are more effective in reducing rebel violence. In practice, these may be smaller projects that are developed through consultation with local communities, which are also more easily revoked when information is not shared.
#* Innovations that increase the value of projects to local civilians, such as including development professionals in project design and implementation, will enhance the effect of violence-reducing.
# Security provided by the government and service provision (i.e. development spending) are complementary activities.
# If either side of the government forces or rebels causes casualties among civilians, civilians will reduce their support for that side.
# Innovations that make anonymous tips to the government easier, of which are often technical, can reduce rebel violence.
These implications are tested by empirical evidences from conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and several other subnational conflicts. Further research on governance, rule of law, attitudes, dynamics and agency between allies are needed to better understand asymmetric conflicts and to have better informed decisions made at the tactical, strategic and public policy levels.

==Counter-insurgency==
Before one counters an insurgency, one must understand what one is countering. Typically the most successful counter-insurgencies have been the British in the Malay Emergency and the Filipino government&#x27;s countering of the Huk Rebellion. In the Philippine–American War, U.S. forces successfully quelled the Filipino insurgents by 1902, albeit with tactics considered unacceptable by the majority of modern populations.

<text>Ijiraq, or Saturn XXII, is a small prograde irregular satellite of Saturn. It was discovered by the team of Brett Gladman, John J. Kavelaars, &quot;et al.&quot; in 2000, and given the temporary designation . It was named in 2003 after the ijiraq, a creature in Inuit mythology.

== Orbit ==

Ijiraq orbits Saturn at an average distance of 11.3 million km in 451 days on an orbit very similar to Kiviuq&#x27;s. Ijiraq is believed to be in Kozai resonance: its orbit is cyclically reducing the inclination while increasing the eccentricity and vice versa. The orbital argument of pericenter oscillates around 90° with an amplitude of 60°. Like Kiviuq and Thrymr, Ijiraq&#x27;s orbital elements overlap strongly with Phoebe&#x27;s, and it is likely to collide with Phoebe in the future.

== Physical characteristics ==
While Ijiraq is a member of the Inuit group of irregular satellites, recent observations revealed that it is distinctively redder than Paaliaq, Siarnaq and Kiviuq. Its spectral slope (a measure of body reflectance in function of the wavelength) is twice as steep as that of other Inuit-group satellites (20% per 100 nm), typical for red trans-Neptunian objects like Sedna but unknown for irregular satellites. In addition, the Ijiraupian (Ijiraqan) spectrum lacks the weak absorption near 0.7 μm, attributed to a possible water hydration, found in the other three.

== Name ==
Ijiraq was named in 2003 after the &quot;ijiraq&quot;, a creature of Inuit mythology.

Kavelaars, an astronomer at McMaster University, suggested this name to help astronomical nomenclature to get out of its Greco-Romano-Renaissance rut. He spent several months trying to find names that were both multi-cultural and Canadian, consulting Amerindian scholars without finding a name that seemed appropriate. In March 2001, he was reading an Inuit tale to his children and had a revelation. The &quot;ijiraq&quot; plays at hide-and-seek, which is what these small moons of Saturn do: they are hard to find, and cold like the Canadian arctic (the team of discoverers includes Canadians, Norwegians and Icelanders—nordicity is their common trait). Kavelaars contacted the author of the tale, Michael Kusugak, to get his assent, and the latter also suggested the names for Kiviuq and 90377 Sedna.

<text>Paaliaq is a prograde irregular satellite of Saturn. It was discovered by J. J. Kavelaars, Brett J. Gladman, Jean-Marc Petit, Hans Scholl, Matthew J. Holman, Brian G. Marsden, Philip D. Nicholson and Joseph A. Burns in early October 2000, and given the temporary designation S/2000 S 2. It was named in August 2003 after a fictional shaman in the book &quot;The Curse of the Shaman,&quot; written by Michael Kusugak, who supplied Kavelaars with the names of giants from Inuit mythology that were used for other Saturnian moons.

Paaliaq is thought to be about 29 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 15.0 million km in 687 days. It is a member of the Inuit group of irregular satellites.

It is light red in color, and in the infrared the Paaliapian (Paaliaqan) spectrum is very similar to the Inuit-group satellites Kiviuq and Siarnaq, supporting the thesis of a possible common origin of the Inuit group in the break-up of a larger body. Its light curve has an unusual pattern of four minima, suggesting that it has a very peculiar shape.

<text>Skathi , also named Saturn XXVII and originally spelled Skadi, is a natural satellite of the planet Saturn. Skathi is one of Saturn&#x27;s irregular moons, in its Norse group of satellites. It was discovered on September 23, 2000, by a team of astronomers led by Brett Gladman. The team announced their discovery on December 7, 2000, along with seven other satellites of Saturn, namely; Tarvos, Ijiraq, Thrymr, Siarnaq, Mundilfari, Erriapus, and Suttungr. The moon was named after Skaði, a figure in Norse mythology, as part of an effort to diversify the largely Greek and Roman names of astronomical objects.

Skathi takes just over 725 days to complete an orbit of Saturn and it is estimated to take hours to rotate on its axis. It orbits at a greater distance from Saturn than many of the planet&#x27;s other satellites, with a large orbital inclination and eccentricity, and it moves in a retrograde direction. Not much is known about Skathi, because it is a dim object. Other than Earth-based observations, it has only been observed by the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe, and even those measurements were taken at a distance of nearly .

Skathi&#x27;s origin remains an open question. One possibility is that it was originally an asteroid that formed elsewhere, and was captured by Saturn&#x27;s gravity as it flew by the planet. Another possibility is that it was originally a portion of one of Saturn&#x27;s moons, like Phoebe, that split off during a collision and became an independent satellite. Its physical composition has not been determined, but it is known to be about across, and to have an irregular shape.

==Discovery==

Skathi was discovered on September 23, 2000, by Brett J. Gladman, John J. Kavelaars, Jean-Marc Petit, Hans Scholl, Matthew J. Holman, Brian G. Marsden, Phil Nicholson, and Joseph A. Burns. The team used images taken by the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories.

At first, Skathi was given the temporary name &quot;S/2000 S 8&quot;: the first &quot;S&quot; denotes that Skathi is a satellite (as opposed to, say, a planetary ring), &quot;2000&quot; specifies that it was discovered in the year 2000, the second &quot;S&quot; is assigned because it orbits the planet Saturn, and the number 8 means that it was the eighth such object discovered in that year.

Skathi&#x27;s name was specifically chosen to diversify the origins of names given to astronomical objects. Most English names for planets are derived from the Roman names for planets, and scientists who have named satellites have tended to follow this pattern. Given this context, the historian Jürgen Blunck wrote that Kavelaars &quot;attempted to help astronomical nomenclature to find its way out of its Greco-Romano-Renaissance rut&quot;, attempting to assign the newly discovered satellites names &quot;that were both multicultural and Canadian&quot;. For Skathi he selected a name from Norse mythology, in which Skaði is a giantess who traveled to Asgard to avenge the death of her father. Several of Saturn&#x27;s other satellites (Ijiraq, Kiviuq, Paaliaq, Siarnaq, and Tarqeq) were given names from Inuit mythology.

When the name of the moon was announced in 2003, it was given as &quot;Skadi&quot;, using as a graphical approximation of the Icelandic letter (&quot;eth&quot;). In 2005, the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature instead decided to use the transliteration .

When Skathi was given its permanent name, it was also assigned the Roman numeral designation Saturn XXVII.

==Orbit and rotation==

All of the members of Saturn&#x27;s Norse group of satellites, including Skathi, have a retrograde orbit, meaning that they orbit in the opposite direction of Saturn&#x27;s orbit. It takes more than 725 days to complete one orbit around Saturn, and it does so at an average distance of . An orbital period of just over two years is fast for an irregular satellite of Saturn, and Skathi completes an orbit faster than any other named retrograde moon of Saturn except Phoebe. Its orbital inclination, which represents how slanted its orbit is, is 149° compared to the ecliptic (the plane on which most objects orbit the Sun) and 150° compared to Saturn&#x27;s equator. This means that it orbits at a sharp angle compared to most objects in the Solar System. Skathi also has an orbital eccentricity of 0.246. A circular orbit has a value of zero; Skathi&#x27;s orbit is more elliptical than the orbit of many objects in the Solar System, such as Earth&#x27;s, which has an eccentricity of 0.017.

Skathi&#x27;s rotation period was initially estimated to be between 11 and 12 hours. As of 2019, the most precise measurements were those taken by the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe, which identified the time taken for Skathi to revolve around its axis of rotation at hours.

==Physical characteristics==
Skathi was first identified by Earth-based observations, and much of the information about Skathi&#x27;s features and composition comes from observations taken from Earth. The &quot;Cassini&quot; probe also observed Skathi on eight occasions between March 2011 and August 2016. However, these observations were conducted during a flyby at a distance of nearly ; even in these observations, Skathi was just a dim point of light.

It has an apparent optical magnitude of 23.6 from Earth, and an absolute visual magnitude of about 14, so it is much less bright from Earth than many hundreds of thousands of objects outside the Solar System. From Earth, it appears close to the much brighter object that it orbits, Saturn, and is assumed to have a low surface albedo of about 0.06.

Observations by &quot;Cassini&quot; suggest that Skathi is about in diameter. The amount of light that Skathi reflects varies substantially as it rotates, which implies that it is an irregularly shaped object. Its spectral slope of +5.2%/100 nm indicates a reddish surface, similar to the Gallic group moons Erriapus and Tarvos.

Many of Saturn&#x27;s moons are composed of water ice and rock, but Skathi&#x27;s chemical composition has not been determined, and it may have different physical composition than Saturn&#x27;s other moons (particularly because it may not have originated in the vicinity of Saturn). The density of Skathi is also not known, but Saturnian irregular satellites are typically not dense, below 1 gram per cubic centimetre, and low densities are thought to characterize most of these objects.

==Origin==
There has been active debate on the origin of Skathi and Saturn&#x27;s other irregular satellites, prompted by how different their orbits are compared to other satellites of Saturn and of the sun. The planets and satellites of a planetary system are thought to usually form by accreting together out of objects in a protoplanetary disk. Because the particles in any part of a protoplanetary disk usually move in similar directions and at similar speeds, a moon that formed from a merger of these particles should have a fairly circular, prograde orbit, approximately on the plane of the protoplanetary disk. But Skathi&#x27;s irregular orbit, like the other natural satellites of Saturn that share similarly irregular orbits, has prompted alternative speculations about its origin.

One possibility is that Skathi originally formed somewhere other than in the vicinity of Saturn, and then began to travel through space before being captured by the planet. However, it is also possible that Skathi is a piece of debris that was knocked off of one of Saturn&#x27;s other moons, during a collision with another object. Because orbits can be extremely chaotic and sensitive to initial conditions, it is possible that some types of collisions could produce an extremely irregular orbit like Skathi&#x27;s, although these orbits are usually not stable over very long timescales.

<text>Albiorix is a prograde irregular satellite of Saturn. It was discovered by Holman and colleagues in 2000, and given the temporary designation S/2000 S 11.

Albiorix is the largest member of the Gallic group of irregular satellites.

==Name==
It was named in August 2003 for Albiorix, &quot;a Gallic giant who was considered to be the king of the world.&quot; The name is known from an inscription found near the French town of Sablet which identifies him with the Roman god Mars (an &quot;interpretatio romana&quot;).

==Orbit==

Albiorix orbits Saturn at a distance of about 16 million kilometers. The rotation period was measured by the ISS camera of the Cassini spacecraft to 13 hours and 19 minutes.

The diagram illustrates the Albiorigian orbit in relation to other prograde irregular satellites of Saturn. The eccentricity of the orbits is represented by the yellow segments extending from the pericentre to the apocentre. 

Given the similarity of the orbital elements and the homogeneity of the physical characteristics with other members of the Gallic group, it was suggested that these satellites could have a common origin in the break-up of a larger moon.

==Physical characteristics==

Measurements from NEOWISE constrain the albedo of Albiorix at , in which case its diameter is a rather large . Albiorix is red in color, but some parts of its surface are less red than others. Varying colours suggest a possibility of a large crater, leading to an alternative hypothesis that Erriapus and Tarvos could be fragments of Albiorix following a near-break-up collision with another body. It has a rotation period of , and while one light curve measured by &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; found two minima with a moderate perturbation in one of them, a different angle showed a sharp minimum and two shallower ones.

<text>Erriapus , or Saturn XXVIII (28), is a prograde irregular satellite of Saturn. It was discovered by Brett Gladman, John J. Kavelaars and colleagues in 2000, and given the temporary designation S/2000 S 10. It was named Erriapo in August 2003 after &quot;Erriapus&quot; (also rendered &quot;Erriappus&quot;), a giant in Gaulish mythology; the name was changed from dative &quot;Erriapo&quot; to nominative &quot;Erriapus&quot; per IAU conventions in late 2007. 

Erriapus is about 10 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 17.5 Gm in 871 days.

As a member of the Gallic group of irregular satellites, which share similar orbital characteristics and a light-red colour, Erriapus is hypothesized to have its origin in the break-up of a common progenitor of the group, or to be a fragment of its largest member, Albiorix. It has a rotation period of , and is thought to rotate on its side, giving it similar seasons to those of Uranus. With a fairly elongated shape, it is a candidate for a contact binary or binary moon.

<text>Siarnaq, also designated Saturn XXIX, is the second-largest irregular moon of Saturn. It was discovered on 23 September 2000 by a team of astronomers led by Brett J. Gladman. It was named after the Inuit goddess of the sea, Siarnaq, who is more commonly known as Sedna. Siarnaq is the largest member of Saturn&#x27;s Inuit group of prograde irregular moons, which orbit far from Saturn in the same direction as the planet&#x27;s rotation. The moons of the Inuit group are believed to have originated as fragments from the collisional breakup of a larger progenitor moon after it was gravitationally captured into orbit around Saturn several billion years ago. Several other small Inuit group moons share similar orbits to Siarnaq, indicating that the moon had experienced another collision after forming from its progenitor.

== Discovery ==

Siarnaq was discovered on 23 September 2000, by an international team of astronomers consisting of Brett J. Gladman, John J. Kavelaars, Jean-Marc Petit, Hans Scholl, Matthew Holman, Brian G. Marsden, Phil Nicholson and Joseph A. Burns. The discovery of Siarnaq formed part of an observational campaign to search for distant irregular satellites around Saturn. The campaign was coordinated by Gladman in late 2000 using various ground-based telescopes equipped with sensitive CCD cameras to survey Saturn&#x27;s Hill sphere, the region within which satellites can have stable orbits around the planet.

In September 2000, Gladman and collaborators conducted a wide-area survey around Saturn down to a R-band limiting magnitude of 24.5 with the 3.6-meter Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii. They reobserved their previous irregular satellite discoveries from August 2000 (Ymir and Paaliaq) and identified two new irregular satellite candidates: Siarnaq and Tarvos. Siarnaq, the brighter of the two, was detected at an apparent magnitude of 20.

=== Follow-up and confirmation ===

Between 25–29 September 2000, follow-up observations of Siarnaq and other newly-discovered Saturnian irregular satellites were made at various observatories. Preliminary orbit calculations ruled out the possibility that the satellites could be foreground asteroids and confirmed they were indeed orbiting Saturn. The discovery of Ymir, Paaliaq, Siarnaq, and Tarvos were formally reported by the International Astronomical Union on 25 October 2000 and announced by Gladman&#x27;s team a day later at a meeting hosted by the American Astronomical Society&#x27;s Division for Planetary Sciences. The discovery of the four satellites raised Saturn&#x27;s known moons to 22, surpassing Uranus&#x27;s moon count of 21 at the time.

Although Siarnaq was confirmed as a satellite, the orbit was poorly known due to an insufficient number of observations. The moon was reobserved by the Kitt Peak National Observatory in December 2000, and later by the Palomar and La Palma observatories in early 2001. In the interim, Gladman&#x27;s team had discovered eight more irregular satellites of Saturn, raising the planet&#x27;s number of known moons to 30 and resultingly overtaking Jupiter as the planet with the most known moons until 2003.

== Name ==
The moon is named after Siarnaq, the Inuit sea giantess or goddess and ruler of the Inuit underworld Adlivun. In other variants of Inuit legend, she is also known by other names such as Nuliajuk and Sedna. Siarnaq is said to reside at the bottom of the ocean and to have conceived all sea life, which she will withhold from Inuit hunters when angered. In some versions of Inuit legend, Siarnaq was once a beautiful maiden who was tricked into marrying a bird-man and then was rescued by her father. They came under attack by a storm, which provoked the desperate father to sacrifice her to the sea in order to save himself.

The moon received its name in a formal notice published by the IAU on 8 August 2003, one month after its approval by the IAU&#x27;s Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature in a general assembly held in July 2003. Siarnaq was also assigned the Roman numeral designation Saturn XXIX, the 29th moon of Saturn.

=== Background ===
Before Siarnaq was given its name, it was formerly known by the provisional designation S/2000 S 3 assigned by the IAU in the discovery announcement. The provisional designation indicates that it was the third Saturnian satellite identified in images taken in 2000. Siarnaq is among the first Saturnian irregular satellites discovered since Phoebe in 1898; the discovery of new satellite groups of Saturn provided the opportunity for their discoverers to establish new naming conventions for each of them.

Kavelaars was advised by his colleagues to deviate from the traditional Greco-Roman mythology theme for Saturnian moons and instead propose names from different cultures. Throughout late 2000, Kavelaars spent several months consulting Amerindian scholars for appropriate name suggestions that were both multicultural and Canadian in origin. In March 2001, he was reading the Inuit tale &quot;Hide and Sneak&quot; to his children and had a revelation. He contacted the author of the tale, Michael Kusugak, to get his assent, and the latter suggested the names Kiviuq and Sedna. Kavelaars then decided that the selected Inuit names should end in the letter q to distinguish the group—hence the name Sedna was changed to Siarnaq. The former name was later used for 90377 Sedna, a distant trans-Neptunian object discovered in 2003.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Diameter and albedo ===
From infrared observations by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) spacecraft, Siarnaq is estimated to be in diameter.

=== Surface and color ===
Siarnaq is light red in color, and the Siarnaupian (Siarnaqan) spectrum in the infrared is very similar to the Inuit-group satellites Paaliaq and Kiviuq, supporting the thesis of a possible common origin in the break-up of a larger body.

Observations of Siarnaq at different phase angles show that its brightness stays relatively constant at high phase angles, where it produces a shallow phase curve, but exhibits a strong opposition surge, where it sharply brightens by 0.2 magnitudes at opposition (zero phase). This phase curve behavior of Siarnaq suggests it has a highly porous surface likely covered with substantial regolith.

=== Shape and rotation ===
The rotation period of Siarnaq was measured by the Cassini spacecraft to be 10.19 hours; this is the shortest rotation period of all prograde irregular moons of Saturn. Siarnaq displays a light curve with three maxima and minima over a full rotation, implying a roughly triangular shape similar to that of Ymir. From &quot;Cassini&quot; observations of Siarnaq at different phase angles, the orientation of its north rotational pole has been determined to be pointing toward 98° ecliptic latitude and −23° ecliptic longitude. This corresponds to a sideways axial tilt, indicating that Siarnaq experiences long, extreme seasons similar to the planet Uranus. 
== Orbit and group ==

Siarnaq orbits Saturn at an average distance of in 896 days (2.45 years). Due to gravitational perturbations the Sun and other planets, the orbit of Siarnaq varies of time. Over a 200-year period, Siarnaq&#x27;s semi-major axis fluctuates between , eccentricity between 0.089–0.554, and inclination between 41.4°–54.3° with respect to the ecliptic. The moon is in a temporary secular resonance with Saturn, in which Siarnaq and Saturn have matching apsidal precession periods. Siarnaq&#x27;s high orbital eccentricity and inclination places it close to the threshold for Lidov–Kozai resonance. 

Siarnaq belongs to Saturn&#x27;s Inuit group of prograde irregular moons, which have average semi-major axes between and high average inclinations between 45°–50°. The Inuit group is further split into three distinct subgroups at different semi-major axes: the Kiviuq group, the Paaliaq group, and the Siarnaq group. The Siarnaq group is the outermost Inuit subgroup and includes seven known members: Siarnaq, Tarqeq, S/2004 S 31, S/2019 S 14, S/2020 S 3, S/2019 S 6, and S/2020 S 5. Moons in the Inuit group appear to be less abundant at smaller sizes, which implies that the Inuit group has existed long enough for collisions to have destroyed most of the smaller moons.

<text>Tarvos , or Saturn XXI, is a prograde irregular satellite of Saturn. It was discovered by John J. Kavelaars et al. on September 23, 2000, and given the temporary designation S/2000 S 4. The name, given in August 2003, is after Tarvos, a deity depicted as a bull god carrying three cranes alongside its back from Gaulish mythology.

==Orbit==

Tarvos orbits Saturn at an average distance of 18 million km in 926 days and is about 15 km in diameter (assuming an albedo of 0.06). It has a high orbital eccentricity of 0.53.

It is a member of the Gallic group of irregular satellites.

==Origin==
With a similar orbit and displaying a similar light-red colour to Albiorix, Tarvos is thought to have its origin in the break-up of a common progenitor or to be a fragment of that body.

<text>Mundilfari, or Saturn XXV, is a natural satellite of Saturn. It was discovered by Brett J. Gladman, et al. in 2000, and given the temporary designation S/2000 S 9. Mundilfari is about 7 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 18,5903 Mm in 952.95 days, at an inclination of 168.4° to the ecliptic, in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.210.

Mundilfari may have formed from debris knocked off Phoebe by large impacts at some point in the Solar System&#x27;s history. With a spectral slope of −5.0%/100 , Mundilfari is the bluest of all the moons studied by Grav and Bauer (2007), slightly more so than Phoebe (−2.5%/100 nm) and about as blue as Erriapus (+5.1%/100 nm) is red. Its rotation period is hours, the second-fastest among all the irregular moons studied by &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; after Hati, and it appears to be very elongated in shape.

It was named in August 2003 from Norse mythology, where Mundilfari is the father of the goddess Sól (Sun) and the god Máni (Moon).

<doc id="589865" wikidata="Q11991625" url="?curid=589865" title="Nob, Israel">
<text>Nob was a priestly town in ancient Israel in the vicinity of Jerusalem. The town is mostly known as the site of a massacre described in the Bible where the town&#x27;s Hebrew priests are massacred by Doeg the Edomite who acted on orders from King Saul.

==Location==
The town is situated in the southern portion of the land associated with the tribe of Benjamin, and is identified within the village of Shuafat, to the north of Jerusalem.

Historical geographers largely identify the site as Bayt Nuba. It likely belonged to the tribe of Benjamin, Jerusalem being at the border between the tribes of Benjamin and Judah.

==In the Bible==
The town is known for its mention in Samuel 21 and 22 as the site of a massacre of the kohenim, the priesthood. The general reading of the incident follows that David visits Nob while being pursued by Saul. David deceives the high priest Ahimelech, who replies in innocence to Saul interrogation. Saul then orders Doeg the Edomite to execute the priests of Nob. One interpretation follows that David was seeking the support of the ecclesiastical establishment as the nation&#x27;s only counter-authority to the state. This reading of the text follows that since Nob was a city of priests, it would be an unlikely place for David to seek food and weapons in his flight from Saul. Priests may not be expected to have arms, and the food locals might bring them as offerings is ritually permitted to priests and their families only (designated as terumah). For this reason, some commentaries note that David eats the showbread, which is more sacred than the priestly food but is not &quot;terumah&quot;. Others interpret the story of David&#x27;s arrival in Nob as an intentional act to eat the sacred showbread and to retrieve Goliath’s sword which was kept in Nob. These acts are performed to downplay the prestige of Saul. An alternate reading suggests that Ahimelech knowingly colluded with David.

Aside from the incident in the Book of Samuel, the town of Nob is mentioned in the Bible in connection with the Neo-Assyrian attack on Israel described in Isaiah 10:32 and concerning the Jewish settlements after the Babylonian captivity listed in Nehemiah 11:33.

In the known as Pseudo-Philo, a first-century work, the town of Nob is identified as the actual location for the biblical incident of the Levite&#x27;s concubine, which takes place in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin.

<text>Thrymr ( ), or Saturn XXX, is a natural satellite of Saturn. It was discovered by Gladman and colleagues in 2000, and given the temporary designation S/2000 S 7. Its name comes from Norse mythology, where Thrymr is a Jotun.

Thrymr is about 8 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 20,810 Mm in 1120.809 days. It may have formed from debris knocked off Phoebe. The Thrymian orbit is retrograde, at an inclination of 175° to the ecliptic (151° to Saturn&#x27;s equator) and with an eccentricity of 0.453. Like Ijiraq and Kiviuq, Thrymr&#x27;s orbit overlaps strongly with Phoebe&#x27;s such that it is likely to collide with it in the future.

Its rotation period is hours, the slowest among the retrograde moons measured by &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; and the second-slowest after Tarqeq. Having two maxima and two minima in its light curve, it may therefore be a contact binary, although this is less likely than for Kiviuq and Bestla. The surface of Thrymr is gray in color and similar to those of Suttungr and Mundilfari, suggesting a common origin as fragments knocked off of Phoebe early in the Solar System&#x27;s history. In particular, it may be part of the same dynamical family as Suttungr, though S/2004 S 7 is probably more closely related.

Its name was announced in its oblique form Thrym in IAU Circular 8177 . However, the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature later decided to add the nominative suffix &quot;-r&quot; to the root &quot;Thrym&quot;.

<text>Ymir , or Saturn XIX, is the second-largest retrograde irregular moon of Saturn. It was discovered by Brett J. Gladman, et al. in 2000, and given the temporary designation S/2000 S 1. It was named in August 2003 after Ymir, who in Norse mythology is the ancestor of all the Jotuns or frost giants.

It takes 3.6 Earth years to complete an orbit around Saturn. Of the moons that take more than 3 Earth years to orbit Saturn, Ymir is the largest, at about in diameter; Ymir is also the second largest member of the Norse group, after Phoebe.

Spectral measurements from &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; show that Ymir is reddish in color, unlike Phoebe&#x27;s gray color, suggesting a separate origin for this moon. It shows a similar light curve as Siarnaq and has a triangular shape, rotating in a retrograde direction about once every 11.9 hours.

<doc id="589877" wikidata="Q456125" url="?curid=589877" title="Betty Boo">
<text>Alison Moira Clarkson (born 6 March 1970), better known as Betty Boo, is a British singer, songwriter and rapper. She first came to mainstream prominence in the late 1980s following a collaboration with the Beatmasters on the song &quot;Hey DJ/I Can&#x27;t Dance (To That Music You&#x27;re Playing)&quot;. Between 1990 and 1992 she had a successful solo career, which spawned a number of chart-placing singles, most notably &quot;Doin&#x27; the Do&quot;, &quot;Where Are You Baby?&quot;, and &quot;Let Me Take You There&quot;.

==Career==
===1987–1999: Betty Boo===
Clarkson studied sound engineering at the Holloway School of Audio Engineering before having several hits between 1989 and 1992. Originally nicknamed &quot;Betty Boop&quot; for her similarity to the cartoon character, she changed it to avoid trademark disputes. Of mixed Dusun and Scottish ancestry, she had an unusual, striking Emma Peel-like look, dressed in mildly revealing outfits and proved to be an influential pop music figure whose &quot;sassy, powerful music and image launched a thousand wannabe&#x27;s&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in August 1990, Lucy O&#x27;Brien noted the difference between the &quot;quietly spoken&quot; Clarkson and her &quot;lovable toughie&quot; pop star alter-ego, describing the latter as &quot;a cartoon combination of Betty Boop, Barbarella and Buck Rogers&quot;.

Whilst still at school, Boo began her musical career in hip-hop groups such as Hit &#x27;N&#x27; Run and the She Rockers, the latter act who were signed to the British independent record label Music of Life. The She Rockers&#x27; success led her to New York and work with Public Enemy, who encouraged her to pursue a solo career. Commenting on her time spent supporting Public Enemy on tour in the US, as well as working with Professor Griff in the recording studio on the song &quot;Give It a Rest&quot;, Boo revealed that things did not go as expected: &quot;They were producing our single and I thought it would sound like their stuff, but it didn&#x27;t at all. And some of the crowds were hostile to us. They didn&#x27;t throw anything, no, but they wanted to see Public Enemy and they just weren&#x27;t interested in us.&quot;

Her big break came when she appeared as a guest vocalist on the 1989 number 7 UK hit single, &quot;Hey DJ – I Can&#x27;t Dance (To That Music You&#x27;re Playing)&quot; by the Beatmasters, which was included in original form on their album &quot;Anywayawanna&quot;. Boo&#x27;s first solo single, &quot;Doin&#x27; the Do&quot;, followed and was also a UK singles chart number 7 success for her in 1990, selling 200,000 copies and reaching number one on Billboard&#x27;s dance chart in the United States. One year later, the song was used as the title tune for &quot;Magic Pockets&quot; video game by the Bitmap Brothers. &quot;Boomania&quot;, her platinum-selling debut album, was largely self-written and self-produced in her bedroom. Her second solo single, &quot;Where Are You Baby?&quot;, which reached number 3 in August 1990, is her biggest solo hit to date. &quot;24 Hours&quot; was the third and final single to be issued from &quot;Boomania&quot;, and although it was a hit, it was less so than previous releases, stalling at number 25 in December 1990. Her initial success was compounded at the 1991 BRIT Awards ceremony where she was voted that year&#x27;s best British Breakthrough Act. In 1991, her &quot;Why, Oh Why?&quot; 1950s-style love ballad featured on the soundtrack of the American film &quot;A Rage in Harlem&quot;.

Her career suffered a setback when in July 1991, while touring Australia, Boo was revealed to be lip-synching at a concert rather than performing live. The 21st Century Dance Club in Frankston, Australia received &quot;hundreds of complaints&quot; after her performance, during which Boo fled the stage after dropping her microphone, revealing she was miming to a backing track. The incident was widely reported, and Boo cancelled the remainder of her tour, citing influenza and fever.

Boo returned with a new record deal in 1992 having signed to WEA. Her follow-up album, &quot;GRRR! It&#x27;s Betty Boo&quot;, suffered very disappointing sales in the UK, peaking at number 62 on the albums chart. It did, nevertheless, spawn another UK hit single titled &quot;Let Me Take You There&quot;, which reached number 12 in August 1992. A further single, &quot;I&#x27;m on My Way&quot;, featured a musical quote from the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; which, unusually, was not a sample—the song&#x27;s brass riff was re-created using all the original players. However, the single did not sell well and entered the chart at number 44 in October 1992. Her next single, &quot;Hangover&quot;, fared even worse, barely scraping the Top 50 upon release in April 1993. Following the release of &quot;GRRR!&quot;, Clarkson turned down an offer to sign with Madonna&#x27;s Maverick Records, and in 1999 a &quot;Best Of&quot; compilation album—effectively an expanded version of &quot;Boomania&quot; with extra remixes and a different running order—was released and sold moderately well.

=== 2006–2014: Subsequent works ===
In 2006, Clarkson formed a pop duo called WigWam, with Alex James, bassist from Blur. Together, they worked with music producer Ben Hillier, along with former Boo collaborators the Beatmasters. Despite working to create &quot;an album of experimental yet accessible 21st century pop&quot;, just one single emerged from their musical partnership, the self-titled &quot;WigWam&quot; released on 3 April 2006 via Instant Karma Records.

In August 2007, Clarkson released a new single titled &quot;Take Off&quot;. The song, which was playlisted on Radio 1&#x27;s dance-orientated shows, was a joint project with the London-based dance act Jack Rokka and, as such, is much more dance-orientated than her previous work. She went on to perform the collaboration in a live set at Manchester Pride in 2007, along with some of her other songs. The video sees Betty Boo&#x27;s trademark look resurrected and even features the &#x27;Boosters&#x27; – Betty Boo&#x27;s backing dancers, who always appear with identical hair and outfits to hers – and the Betty Boo spiral. Clarkson appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Loose Women&quot; on 16 October 2007 to promote the single, and has also appeared as an interviewee on BBC Three&#x27;s &quot;The Most Annoying Pop Songs...&quot; show, passing comment on several songs that made the Top 100 list.

In July 2009, historian Kate Williams reported on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Broadcasting House&quot; that she is working with Clarkson to develop a musical version of Williams&#x27; biography &quot;England&#x27;s Mistress: The Infamous Life of Emma Hamilton&quot;. In June 2011, Clarkson featured as Betty Boo (and is credited) on the track &quot;Virtually Art&quot; by the Feeling on the double-album edition of their 2011 release, &quot;Together We Were Made.&quot; In July 2014, Betty Boo performed on stage at the Penn Festival, while in 2021 she was announced as one of the artists performing as part of the Let’s Rock retro music festival line-ups, at various dates throughout the UK.

===2022–present: Return to music===
On 10 January 2022, Boo announced the release of the single &quot;Get Me to the Weekend&quot;. The second single &quot;Shining Star&quot;, was released on 12 May 2022. Her first album in 30 years, &quot;Boomerang&quot;, was released on 14 October 2022.

On 14 June 2024, Boo released the single &quot;It Was Beautiful&quot; (featuring HEX) from her fourth album &quot;Rip Up the Rulebook&quot;.

==Songwriter==
After her solo career effectively ended when her mother contracted terminal cancer in the early 1990s, Clarkson turned to songwriting, at the request of Chris Herbert, who was in the process of forming a new, all-girl group. Herbert asked her to contribute to the project after revealing that she was his inspiration in forming one of his previous projects, the Spice Girls: &quot;He told me that when they were auditioning for the Spice Girls, they were looking for five Betty Boos – larger-than-life cartoon characters. He asked me to get involved in this other band he was putting together, Girl Thing, because he wanted this signature Betty Boo sound, a bit of hip-hop.&quot;

Clarkson went on to co-write a number of songs for Girl Thing, including &quot;Pure and Simple&quot;. Although the group&#x27;s A&amp;R man, Simon Cowell, initially rejected her song, it was included in the Japanese edition of Girl Thing&#x27;s self-titled debut album, released in 2001. The song became a huge, record-breaking hit single when it was re-recorded and released as the debut single of Hear&#x27;Say—winners of the reality TV show, &quot;Popstars&quot;—in March of the same year. On the release, Clarkson commented: &quot;The arrangement they used was almost identical. I never met the band. It was a bit disheartening&quot;. The song went on to win the Ivor Novello Award for the biggest selling single of 2001, however despite finding renewed success by writing for other artists, Clarkson criticised the audition-based, manufactured pop process which created them.

Clarkson has also written songs for Girls Aloud (reunited with the Beatmasters), Louise, Dannii Minogue, The Tweenies and for Sophie Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Make a Scene&quot; (though her contributions did not make the final album).

<text>Stephano ( ) is a retrograde irregular satellite of Uranus. It was discovered by Brett J. Gladman, &quot;et al.&quot; in 1999, and given the provisional designation S/1999 U 2.

Confirmed as Uranus XX, it was named after the drunken butler in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot; in August 2000.

The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong to the same dynamic cluster as Caliban, suggesting common origin.

<doc id="589885" wikidata="Q257756" url="?curid=589885" title="Margaret Hamilton (actress)">
<text>Margaret Brainard Hamilton (December 9, 1902 – May 16, 1985) was an American actress, vaudevillian and educator, whose fifty-year career in entertainment spanned theatre, film, radio and television. She often played villains and was best known for her portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West and her Kansas counterpart Almira Gulch in the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

A former schoolteacher, she worked as a character actress in films for seven years before she was offered the role that defined her public image. In later years, Hamilton appeared in films and made frequent cameo appearances on television sitcoms and commercials. She also gained recognition for her work as an advocate of causes designed to benefit children and animals and retained a lifelong commitment to public education.

Her role as the Wicked Witch of the West is ranked by the American Film Institute as Hollywood&#x27;s fourth-greatest villain of all time and the all time greatest female villain.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of W.J. Hamilton and Jennie Adams, and practiced her craft doing children&#x27;s theater while she was a Junior League of Cleveland member. She attended Hathaway Brown School. 

Hamilton began her acting career at the Cleveland Play House as an ensemble member in a production of &quot;The Brothers Karamazov,&quot; while studying acting and Pantomime under Maria Ouspenskaya. Her first major role at the Play House was as the First Witch in a production of &quot;Macbeth.&quot; She would go on to play numerous comedic roles, including circus performer Charlotta Ivanovna in Chekov&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, and the sultry Miss Prosperine Garnett in &quot;Candida.&quot; She was praised in the press for her range as both a comedian and a serious actress.

In December of 1929, she starred in a musical vaudeville act titled &quot;Heartrending and Humorous Songs of 1840, 1890, and 1929.&quot; Before she turned to acting exclusively, her parents insisted she attend Wheelock College in Boston, which she did, later becoming a kindergarten teacher.

==Film career==
Hamilton made her screen debut as Helen Hallam in the MGM film adaptation &quot;Another Language&quot; (1933) starring Helen Hayes and Robert Montgomery. She had previously originated the role of Helen Hallam on Broadway. She went on to appear in &quot;These Three&quot; (1936), &quot;Saratoga&quot;, &quot;You Only Live Once&quot;, &quot;When&#x27;s Your Birthday?&quot;, &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; (all 1937), &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (1938), Mae West&#x27;s &quot;My Little Chickadee&quot; (with W. C. Fields, 1940), and &quot;The Sin of Harold Diddlebock&quot;, with Harold Lloyd, 1947. She strove to work as much as possible to support herself and her son. She never put herself under contract to any one studio and was paid $1,000 a week ($ in today&#x27;s money).

Hamilton co-starred opposite Buster Keaton and Richard Cromwell in a 1940s spoof of the long-running local melodrama &quot;The Drunkard&quot;, titled &quot;The Villain Still Pursued Her&quot;. Later in the decade, she was in a little-known film noir, titled &quot;Bungalow 13&quot; (1948), in which she again costarred opposite Cromwell. She appeared regularly in supporting roles in films until the early 1950s and sporadically thereafter. 

Opposite Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, she played a heavily made-up witch in &quot;Comin&#x27; Round the Mountain&quot;, where her character and Costello&#x27;s go toe-to-toe with voodoo dolls representing each other. She appeared, uncredited, in Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s &quot;People Will Talk&quot; (1951) as Sarah Pickett. In 1960, producer/director William Castle cast Hamilton as a housekeeper in his &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; horror film, in which 12-year-old lead Charles Herbert&#x27;s character taunts her about being a witch, including the final scene, in which she is holding a broom in her hand.

On stage and screen, she was known for her rapid fire deadpan delivery, Midwestern accent, and her dark Contralto singing voice. Despite standing at only five feet tall with a slight build, Hamilton&#x27;s commanding stage presence led to a successful career playing villains.

===&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;===
In 1939, Hamilton played the role of the Wicked Witch of the West, opposite Judy Garland&#x27;s Dorothy Gale in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, her most famous role, and one of the screen&#x27;s most memorable villains. Hamilton was cast after Gale Sondergaard, who was first considered for the role, albeit as a more glamorous witch with a musical scene, declined the role when the decision was made that the witch should appear ugly.

On December 23, 1938, Hamilton suffered a second-degree burn on her face and a third-degree burn on her hand during a second take of her fiery exit from Munchkinland, in which the trap door&#x27;s drop was delayed to eliminate the brief glimpse of it seen in the final edit. Hamilton had to recuperate in a hospital and at home for six weeks after the accident, before returning to the set to complete her work on the film. She refused to have anything further to do with fire for the rest of the filming. 

After she recuperated, she said, &quot;I won&#x27;t sue, because I know how this business works, and I would never work again. I will return to work on one condition – no more fireworks!&quot; Garland visited Hamilton while the latter recuperated at home looking after her son. Studio executives cut some of Hamilton&#x27;s more frightening scenes, worrying they would frighten children too much. Later in life, she would comment on the role of the witch in a light-hearted fashion. During one interview, she joked:

I was in need of money at the time, I had done about six pictures for MGM at the time, and my agent called. I said, &#x27;Yes?&#x27; and he said &#x27;Maggie, they want you to play a part on the Wizard.&#x27; I said to myself, &#x27;Oh, boy, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;! That has been my favorite book since I was four.&#x27; And I asked him what part, and he said, &#x27;The Witch&#x27;, and I said, &#x27;The Witch?!&#x27; and he said, &#x27;What else?&#x27;

Hamilton&#x27;s stand-in and stunt double for the Witch, Betty Danko, also suffered an on-set accident, on February 11, 1939. Danko made the fiery entrance to Munchkinland, not Hamilton. She was severely burned during the &quot;Surrender Dorothy!&quot; skywriting sequence at the Emerald City. Danko sat on a smoking pipe configured to look like the Witch&#x27;s broomstick. The pipe exploded on the third take of the scene. She spent 11 days in the hospital and her legs were permanently scarred. The studio hired a new stunt double, Aline Goodwin, to finish the broomstick-riding scene for Danko.

When asked about her experiences on the set of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Hamilton said her biggest fear was that her monstrous film role would give children the wrong idea of who she really was. In reality, she cared deeply about children, frequently giving to charitable organizations. She often remarked about children coming up to her and asking her why she had been so mean to Dorothy. She appeared on an episode of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; in 1975 where she explained to children she was only playing a role and showed how putting on a costume &quot;transformed&quot; her into the witch. She also made personal appearances, and Hamilton described the children&#x27;s usual reaction to her portrayal of the Witch:

Almost always they want me to laugh like the Witch. And sometimes when I go to schools, if we&#x27;re in an auditorium, I&#x27;ll do it. And there&#x27;s always a funny reaction, like &#x27;Ye gods, they wish they hadn&#x27;t asked.&#x27; They&#x27;re scared. They&#x27;re really scared for a second. Even adolescents. I guess for a minute they get the feeling they got when they watched the picture. They like to hear it but they &#x27;don&#x27;t&#x27; like to hear it. And then they go, &#x27;Ooooooh ... !&#x27; The picture made a terrible impression of some kind on them, sometimes a ghastly impression, but most of them got over it, I guess ... because when I talk like the Witch, and when I laugh, there is a hesitation and then they clap. They&#x27;re clapping at hearing the sound again.

In &quot;By Your Leave&quot; (1934), she played his housekeeper, and in &quot;Saratoga&quot; (1937), she has a colloquy with Morgan regarding a cosmetic product he invented, with side glances and eye rolls by Morgan as to its effect on her &quot;beauty&quot;). Hamilton&#x27;s line from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; – &quot;I&#x27;ll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!&quot; – was ranked 99th in the 2005 American Film Institute survey of the most memorable movie quotes. Her son, interviewed for the 2005 DVD edition of the film, commented that Hamilton enjoyed the line so much, she sometimes used it in her real life.

A few months after filming &quot;Oz&quot;, she appeared in &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; (1939) as Jeff Steele&#x27;s aunt, Martha, a society do-gooder who made it her goal to send the gang of child actors, led by Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, to a work farm. In 1945, she played the domineering sister of &quot;Oz&quot; co-star Jack Haley in &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot;, comically trying to prevent him from marrying actress Joan Davis, even going so far as to throw a hatchet at her. Hamilton and Ray Bolger were cast members in the 1966 fantasy film &quot;The Daydreamer&quot;, a collection of stories by Hans Christian Andersen. A few years later, they were reunited on Broadway for the short-lived musical &quot;Come Summer&quot;.

==Radio, television, and stage career==

In the 1940s and 1950s, Hamilton had a long-running role on the radio series &quot;Ethel and Albert&quot;, or &quot;The Couple Next Door&quot;, in which she played the lovable, scattered Aunt Eva, with her name later changed to Aunt Effie. In 1957, she appeared in two episodes of &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;. During the 1960s and 1970s, Hamilton appeared regularly on television. She did a stint as a &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; mystery guest on the popular Sunday night CBS-TV program. She played Morticia Addams&#x27;s mother, Hester Frump, in three episodes of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1965–66). Hamilton had been offered the role of Grandmama, but turned it down. 

In 1962, Hamilton played Leora Scofield, a suffragist who arrives in Laramie, Wyoming, to bolster feminist causes in a territory where women had already obtained the right to vote, in the episode &quot;Beyond Justice&quot; of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Laramie&quot;. 

Having started on the stage in the early 1930s, Hamilton began to work extensively in the theater after leaving Los Angeles. She appeared on Broadway in the musical &quot;Goldilocks&quot; opposite Don Ameche and Elaine Stritch, gave a lighter touch to the domineering Parthy Anne Hawks in the 1966 revival of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, dancing with David Wayne. In 1968, she was the tender Aunt Eller in the Lincoln Center revival of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. Hamilton toured in many plays and musicals, even repeating her role of the Wicked Witch in specially written stage productions of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. For her last stage role, she was cast as Madame Armfeldt in the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;, singing the song &quot;Liaisons&quot; for the national tour costarring with Jean Simmons as her daughter Desiree.

Even with her extensive film career, Hamilton took roles in whatever medium she could get if she was free, making her soap opera debut as the nasty Mrs. Sayre on &quot;Valiant Lady&quot;, who schemed to prevent her daughter from marrying the heroine&#x27;s son. In the 1960s, Hamilton was a regular on another CBS soap opera, &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;, playing the role of Grace Tyrell&#x27;s housekeeper, Katie. For ABC&#x27;s short-lived radio anthology &quot;Theatre-Five&quot;, she played a manipulative, ailing Aunt Lettie to Joan Lorring as the unhappy niece Maude in &quot;Noose of Pearls&quot;. 
In the early 1970s, Hamilton joined the cast of another CBS soap opera, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, on which she played Miss Peterson, Simon Gilbey&#x27;s assistant. She had a small role in the made-for-television film &quot;&quot; (1973) and appeared as a befuddled neighbor on &quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&quot;, a friend of the character played by Mary Wickes. In &quot;The Paul Lynde Halloween Special&quot; (1976), she portrayed Lynde&#x27;s housekeeper, reprising the Wicked Witch role, as well as introducing Lynde to the rock group Kiss. When Hamilton reprised her role as the Wicked Witch in a 1976 episode of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;the show&#x27;s producers were flooded with letters from parents saying it was too frightening for children.&quot; 

She appeared as herself in three episodes of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, between 1975 and 1976, because Fred Rogers wanted his viewers to recognize the Wicked Witch was just a character and not something to be afraid of. Hamilton continued acting regularly until 1982. Her last roles were two guest appearances as veteran journalist Thea Taft in 1979 and 1982, on &quot;Lou Grant&quot;.

Throughout the 1970s, Hamilton lived in New York City&#x27;s Gramercy Park neighborhood and appeared on local (and some national) public-service announcements for organizations promoting the welfare of pets. Her most visible appearances during this period were as general store owner, Cora, in a national series of television commercials for Maxwell House coffee. On October 30, 1975, she guest-starred on the radio revival series &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;. In the episode, entitled &quot;Triptych for a Witch&quot;, Hamilton played the title role.
In 1973, Hamilton produced the stage production of &quot;An Evening with the Bourgeoisie&quot;. Her other mid-1970s stage productions, as the producer, were &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; and &quot;House Party&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hamilton married Paul Boynton Meserve on June 13, 1931, and made her debut on the New York City stage in 1932. While her acting career developed, her marriage began to fail; the couple divorced in 1938. Their separation was publicized, with Hamilton accusing Meserve of physical abuse, including him hitting her and punching her in the face. These allegations were corroborated by the couple&#x27;s housekeeper, who sued Meserve after alleging he physically attacked her. They had one son, Hamilton &quot;Tony&quot; Wadsworth Meserve, whom she raised on her own after getting sole custody. Hamilton had three grandchildren, Christopher, Scott, and Margaret. She never remarried. Bruce Vilanch, who worked with her later in life, stated that she told him she identified as a lesbian.

Her Gramercy Park neighbor Sybil Daneman reported that Hamilton loved children, but they were often afraid to meet her because of her portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Daneman&#x27;s nephew refused to meet Hamilton, because even though he understood she was an actress, he thought it was still possible she really was like the character in the movie.
Hamilton became close friends with &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; castmate Judy Garland, acting as a mentor and confidant. While filming &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; the same year with Garland, Garland would ask Hamilton to spend time in her dressing room with her, as her mother wouldn&#x27;t berate her in the presence of another adult. Garland affectionately referred to Hamilton as &quot;my witch&quot;.Hamilton also remained a lifelong friend of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; castmate Ray Bolger (who played the Scarecrow). Hamilton was a regular parishioner of the Presbyterian church. A Republican, she supported the campaign of Dwight Eisenhower during the 1952 presidential election.

==Final years and death==
Hamilton&#x27;s early experience as a teacher fueled a lifelong interest in educational issues. She served on the Beverly Hills Board of Education from 1948 to 1951 and was a Sunday school teacher during the 1950s. Hamilton lived in New York City for most of her adult life, and summered in a cottage on Cape Island, Southport, Maine. In 1979, she was a guest speaker at a University of Connecticut children&#x27;s literature class. 

Hamilton later moved to Millbrook, New York. She was admitted to a nursing home in Salisbury, Connecticut, six months before her death. She died of a heart attack on May 16, 1985, at the age of 82. Hamilton&#x27;s remains were cremated.

<doc id="589889" wikidata="Q542776" url="?curid=589889" title="Deusdedit of Canterbury">
<text>Deusdedit (died ) was a medieval Archbishop of Canterbury, the first native-born holder of the see of Canterbury. By birth an Anglo-Saxon, he became archbishop in 655 and held the office for more than nine years until his death, probably from plague. Deusdedit&#x27;s successor as archbishop was one of his priests at Canterbury. There is some controversy over the exact date of Deusdedit&#x27;s death, owing to discrepancies in the medieval written work that records his life. Little is known about his episcopate, but he was considered to be a saint after his demise. A saint&#x27;s life was written after his relics were moved from their original burial place in 1091.

==Life==
A post-Norman Conquest tradition, originating with Goscelin, gives Deusdedit&#x27;s original name as &quot;Frithona&quot;, possibly a corruption of Frithuwine. He was consecrated by Ithamar, Bishop of Rochester, on 26 March or perhaps 12 March 655. He was the sixth archbishop after the arrival of the Gregorian missionaries, and the first to be a native of the island of Great Britain rather than an Italian, having been born a West Saxon. One reason for the long period between the Christianization of the Kentish kingdom from Anglo-Saxon paganism in about 600 and the appointment of the first native archbishop may have been the need for the schools established by the Gregorian missionaries to educate the natives to a sufficiently high standard for them to take ecclesiastical office. Deusdedit probably owed his appointment to the see of Canterbury to a collaboration between Eorcenberht of Kent and Cenwalh of Wessex. The name Deusdedit means &quot;God has given&quot; in Latin, and had been the name of a recent pope, Deusdedit, in office from 615 to 618; it was the practice of many of the early medieval Saxon bishops to take an adopted name, often from recent papal names. It is unclear when Deusdedit adopted his new name, although the historian Richard Sharpe considers it likely to have been when he was consecrated as an archbishop, rather than when he entered religious life.

The see of Canterbury seems at this time to have been passing through a period of comparative obscurity. During Deusdedit&#x27;s nine years as archbishop, all the new bishops in England were consecrated by Celtic or foreign bishops, with one exception: Deusdedit consecrated Damianus, Ithamar&#x27;s successor as Bishop of Rochester. Deusdedit did, however, found a nunnery in the Isle of Thanet and helped with the foundation of Medeshamstede Abbey, later Peterborough Abbey, in 657. He was long overshadowed by Agilbert, bishop to the West Saxons, and his authority as archbishop probably did not extend past his own diocese and that of Rochester, which had traditionally been dependent on Canterbury.

The Synod of Whitby, which debated whether the Northumbrian church should follow the Roman or the Celtic method of dating Easter, was held in 664. Deusdedit does not appear to have been present, perhaps because of an outbreak of the plague prevalent in England at the time.

==Death==
Deusdedit died at some time around the Synod of Whitby, although the exact date is disputed. Bede, in the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;, states that &quot;On the fourteenth of July in the above mentioned year, when an eclipse was quickly followed by plague and during which Bishop Colman was refuted by the unanimous decision of the Catholics and returned to his own country, Deusdedit the sixth Archbishop of Canterbury died.&quot; A solar eclipse occurred on 1 May 664, which would appear to make the date of Deusdedit&#x27;s death 14 July 664. But that conflicts with Bede&#x27;s own information earlier in the &quot;Historia&quot;, where he claims that Deusdedit&#x27;s predecessor, Honorius, &quot;died on the 30th of September 653, and after a vacancy of 18 months, Deusdedit, a West Saxon was elected to the archiepiscopal see and became the 6th Archbishop. He was consecrated by Ithamar, Bishop of Rochester, on the 26th of May, and ruled the see until his death nine years, four months, and two days later.&quot; If this information is accurate, then Deusdedit must have died on 28 July 664. Various methods of reconciling these discrepancies have been proposed. Frank Stenton argues that Bede began his years on 1 September; thus the date of Honorius&#x27; death should be considered 30 September 652 in modern reckoning. Further, Stenton argued that medieval copyists had introduced an error into the manuscripts of the &quot;Historia&quot;, and that Bede meant that the length of Deusdedit&#x27;s reign was 9 years and 7 months, rather than 9 years and 4 months as stated in the manuscripts. From this, he concludes that Deusdedit&#x27;s death occurred in the year September 663 to September 664. This would make the year of death correct according to the eclipse, but still leave a discrepancy on the specific day of death, for which Stenton asserted the length calculations given by Bede were more correct than the actual death date given. Thus Stenton concluded that Deusdedit died on 28 October 663.

Other historians, including Richard Abels, P. Grosjean, and Alan Thacker, state that Deusdedit died on 14 July 664. The main argument was put forward by Grosjean, who claimed that Bede had the consecration date wrong, as 26 May was Maundy Thursday in 655, not a date that would normally have been chosen for a consecration. Grosjean argues that the best method for resolving the conflicts is to just take 14 July 664 as the date of death, and figure backwards with the length of reign given by Bede, which gives a consecration date of 12 March 655. Thacker and Abels agree generally, although Thacker does not give a specific consecration date beyond March. Abels adds to Grosjean&#x27;s arguments Bede&#x27;s association of Deusdedit&#x27;s death with that of King Eorcenberht, which Bede gives as occurring on the same day. Bede states that the plague of 664 began soon after the eclipse on 1 May. Nothing in Bede contradicts the date of 14 July 664 for Eorcenberht; therefore, Abels considers that date to be the best fit for the available data. The historian D. P. Kirby agrees that Deusdedit died in 664, although he does not give a precise date within that year.

Most historians state that Deusdedit died of the plague that was prevalent in England at the time. Because Bede records the death of Deusdedit shortly after he mentions the outbreak of the plague, the historian J. R. Maddicott asserts that both Deusdedit and Eorcenberht were struck suddenly with the disease and died quickly. Bede is not specific on the type of plague, but Maddicott argues that because of the time of its eruption and the way it arrived in England it was probably bubonic plague. Although Bede does not describe either Eorcenberht or Deusdedit&#x27;s symptoms he does discuss another victim of the 664 disease, who suffered from a tumour on his thigh, resembling the characteristic groin swellings of bubonic plague.

==Legacy==
Except for the bare facts of his life, little is known about Deusdedit. Deusdedit&#x27;s successor as Archbishop of Canterbury, Wighard, had been one of his clergy. Deusdedit was regarded as a saint after his death, with a feast day of 14 July, although the Bosworth Psalter, a late 10th or early 11th-century psalter produced at , gives a date of 15 July. His feast day is designated as a major feast day, and is included along with those of a number of other early Canterbury archbishops in the Bosworth Psalter. Deusdedit was buried in the church of St Augustine&#x27;s in Canterbury, but was translated to the new abbey church in 1091. A hagiography, or saint&#x27;s biography, on Deusdedit was written by Goscelin after the translation of his relics, but the work was based mainly on Bede&#x27;s account; the manuscript of the &quot;De Sancto Deusdedit Archiepiscopo&quot; survives as part of British Library manuscript (ms) Cotton Vespasian B.xx. Because of the late date of the &quot;Sancto&quot;, Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; is the main source for what little is known about Deusdedit. Other than the hagiography, there is scant evidence of a cult surrounding him. His shrine survived until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s.

<text>Bethphage (; ) or Bethsphage, is a Christian religious site on the Mount of Olives east of historical Jerusalem.

The Synoptic Gospels mention Jesus stopping in Bethphage before his triumphal entry into Jerusalem. There is an annual Catholic Palm Sunday procession into Jerusalem, as there is a Greek Orthodox one (the respective feasts seldom fall on the same day), both beginning in Bethphage.

==New Testament==
Bethphage is mentioned in the New Testament as the place in ancient Israel to which Jesus sent his disciples to find a colt upon which he would ride into Jerusalem. The Synoptic Gospels mention it as being close to Bethany, where he was staying immediately prior to his triumphal entry into Jerusalem.

Unknown villagers living there, the owners of the colt according to Gospel of Luke 19:33, permitted Jesus&#x27; disciples to take the colt away for Jesus&#x27; triumphal entry into Jerusalem, which would have been four days before Passover.

==Location==
Bethphage is about from the modern village of al-Azariya.

Eusebius (&quot;Onom&quot; 58:13) located it on the Mount of Olives. It was likely on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho and the limit of a Sabbath-day&#x27;s journey from Jerusalem, i.e., 2,000 cubits.

==Churches and monasteries==
The Franciscan Church of Bethphage was built on the foundations of a 12th-century crusader chapel.

Just up the hill from the Catholic church is the Greek Orthodox Monastery of Palm-bearing Bethphage. The Greek Orthodox mark the feast day every year at the site.

<doc id="589893" wikidata="Q134116" url="?curid=589893" title="Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)">
<text>Melville Island (; , ) is an uninhabited member of the Queen Elizabeth Islands of the Arctic Archipelago. With an area of , it is the 33rd largest island in the world and Canada&#x27;s eighth largest island.

Mountains on Melville Island, some of the largest in the western Canadian Arctic, reach heights of .

Melville Island is shared by the Northwest Territories, which is responsible for the western half of the island, and Nunavut, which is responsible for most of the eastern half. The border runs along the 110th meridian west. The eastern half of the island contains two subnational pene-exclaves that lie west of the 110th meridian and form part of the Northwest Territories. These can be reached by land only from Nunavut.

== Geography ==
The island is located between Prince Patrick Island in the northwest, Eglinton Island in the west, and Byam Martin Island in the east. Across Viscount Melville Sound in the south lies Victoria Island.

The island has little or no vegetation. Where continuous vegetation occurs, it usually consists of hummocks of mosses, lichens, grasses, and sedges. The only woody species, the dwarf willow, grows as a dense twisted mat crawling along the ground.

Ibbett Bay is a fjord on the western side of the island, running approximately 55 km long.

== Fauna ==
A diverse animal population exists: polar bear, Peary caribou, muskox, northern collared lemming, Arctic wolf, Arctic fox, Arctic hare, and ermine (stoat) are common. A 2003 sighting of a grizzly bear and grizzly tracks by an expedition from the University of Alberta represent the most northerly reports of grizzly bears ever recorded.

Melville Island is one of two major breeding grounds for the brant goose. DNA analysis and field observations suggest that these birds may be distinct from other &quot;brant&quot; stocks. Numbering 4,000–8,000 birds, this could be one of the rarest goose stocks in the world.

== History ==
The first documented European to visit Melville Island was the British explorer, Sir William Parry, in 1819. He was forced to spend the winter at what is now called &quot;Winter Harbour,&quot; until 1 August 1820, owing to freeze-up of the sea.

The island is named for Robert Dundas, 2nd Viscount Melville, who was First Sea Lord at the time. In the search for Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition, its east coast was explored as far as Bradford Point by Abraham Bradford in 1851, while its north and west coasts were surveyed by Francis Leopold McClintock, Richard Vesey Hamilton, and George Henry Richards in 1853.

On January 30, 1920, &quot;The Pioche Record&quot; reported that Icelandic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson discovered a lost cache from the 1853 McClintock expedition on Melville Island. Clothing and food from the cache was in excellent condition despite the harsh arctic conditions.

In 1930, a large sandstone rock marking Parry&#x27;s 1819 wintering site at Winter Harbour, approximately long and high, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

== Fossil fuel deposits ==
Melville has surfaced as a candidate for natural gas deposits. The island was believed to have deposits of coal and oil shale since the first half of the 20th century. The first Canadian Arctic island exploratory well was spudded in 1961 at Winter Harbour.

It drilled Lower Paleozoic strata to a total depth of . In the 1970s, the northern portion of the island on the east side of the Sabine Peninsula proved to contain a major gas field, known as Drake Point. The lease was owned by Panarctic Oils, a joint operation with the Canadian Government.

<text>The little blue heron (Egretta caerulea) is a small heron of the genus &quot;Egretta&quot;. It is a small, darkly colored heron with a two-toned bill. Juveniles are entirely white, bearing resemblance to the snowy egret. During the breeding season, adults develop different coloration on the head, legs, and feet.

They have a range that encompasses much of the Americas, from the United States to northern South America. Some populations are migratory. Climate change will probably cause their distribution to spread north. They can be found in both saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. Their preference for either one depends on where they live.

Nesting behaviors are documented by numerous sources. The adults build nests in trees, in colonies with other bird species. The number of eggs laid varies from place to place. The young mature quickly, requiring little attention from adults after about nineteen days of age. Both young and adults are sometimes preyed on by other species. Adults hunt fish, crabs, and other small animals. As with clutch sizes, diet can vary regionally.

The population of &quot;E. caerulea&quot; is declining. Many possible reasons for this have been proposed. Exposure to heavy metals has been found to have detrimental effects on young birds.

==Taxonomy==
The little blue heron is part of the family Ardeidae, a group whose members can be found throughout much of the world, including the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. It was first described as &quot;Ardea caerulea&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in his 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. It is now a member of the genus &quot;Egretta&quot;. It may be closely related to the snowy egret, another member of its genus, which it greatly resembles when young. Variations of the name include &quot;Ardea coerulea&quot;, &quot;Florida caerulea&quot;, and &quot;Hydranassa caerulea&quot;.

Young birds found in a little blue heron nest in North Dakota, at a site heavily populated by cattle egrets (&quot;Bubulcus ibis&quot;), which displayed traits of both the former and latter, are believed to be an example of hybridization between the two species. Other species they are known to hybridize with include the tricolored heron, little egret, snowy egret, and black-crowned night heron. Of these four, only the black-crowned night heron is not a member of &quot;Egretta&quot;.

==Description==

Males and females have the same coloration. The adults are darkly colored, with purple-maroon heads and blue bodies. During the breeding season, their heads turn dark red. They have two-toned bills, which are a light blue at the base, with black tips. Their eyes are yellow and their legs are greenish. Juveniles are almost completely white, although the upper primaries are somewhat dark in color. Like adults, their bills are two-toned. Immature birds transitioning from the juvenile to adult phase have a combination of light and dark feathers. Both sexes are about , with a wingspan of . They weigh about .

The lores, which are normally a dull green become a shade of turquoise. They also develop long plumes on the crest and back, which can stretch past the tail. The legs and feet become black. The eggs are typically smooth, light blue, and unmarked, measuring about , and weighing around .

==Distribution and habitat==

&quot;Egretta caerulea&quot; can be found regularly in the United States, Mexico, Central America, northern South America (including Venezuela, Colombia, and Peru), and numerous Caribbean islands (including Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola). They have been recorded as a vagrant (a species that appears far outside its natural range) in Greenland, Portugal, and South Africa. Whether or not their range is declining is unknown. In the United States, they can be found from Missouri to Virginia to Florida. They are more common in peninsular Florida than the Florida Panhandle. They can occasionally roam as far north as Canada.

Individuals in central Alabama tend to migrate towards South America and the Caribbean, while those from the Mississippi River west travel to Mexico and Central America. One study found that of seven migratory wading bird species, the little blue heron had the greatest mean dispersal distance, of .

Future climate change is projected to increase its overall range. If global warming continues at its current rate, by the year 2080, its summer range will have increased by 87%. Of its current range, it is expected to lose only 1%. These gains would spread its summer distribution well into more northern parts of the US, such as Michigan and Minnesota, and even into southern Canada.

The little blue heron can be found in freshwater and marine environments. These include mangrove forests, bogs, swamps, salt marshes, tidal flats, estuaries, streams, and flooded fields. They are usually found at low elevations, but can be seen at heights of in the Andes.

In North America, they tend to favor freshwater habitats, while in the Caribbean, they are more often found in saltwater. Towards the southern extent of their range, in Brazil, they are found almost exclusively along the coast, rarely venturing inland at all.

===Regional variations===
Juveniles in San Blas, in the Mexican state of Nayarit have an atypical color-scheme. In these birds, the top of the head is chestnut colored and the wings tips are much darker. Initially, it was suggested that they may be hybrids, however further study concluded they were most likely a natural variation. No other geographic varieties have been observed.

==Behavior and ecology==
Little blue herons prefer to stand still and wait when hunting, rather than chase after prey. They walk slowly and search for fish and other prey items, flying to different spots if needed. They tend to move slower than other related species, which can help distinguish them. They are not usually found in large numbers at any body of water. Occasionally, however, they will gather with other herons, especially if they have found a school of fish trapped in shallow water. They sometimes also feed in grassy fields.

===Reproduction and life cycle===
During courtship, both males and females practice bill-nibbling. Males also use a neck-stretch to attract mates.

====Nesting====
Little blue herons typically nest in trees alongside other roosting birds. They are colonial nesters (nesting in groups). Examples of species they may nest alongside include the scarlet ibis, yellow-crowned night heron, great egret, black-crowned night heron, and snowy egret.

During nest construction, males bring twigs to females, who use them to build the nest. Both males and females help incubate their clutch. They begin incubation after two eggs have been laid, which will cause any later eggs to hatch out of sync. The chicks that hatch later tend to not receive as much food as early-hatching ones, which limits their growth. Clutch sizes vary significantly throughout their range. In Trinidad, there are usually 2–5 eggs, while in Costa Rica, only 2–4 are laid on average. In North America, the mean is 2.67–4.4. The very lowest values are seen in southeastern Brazil and the US states Florida and Georgia, where no more than three are generally laid.

Young herons are able to start climbing around the branches by their nests at 15 days old. Due to the young age at which they develop motor skills in their legs, the young do not rely on their parents for anything besides feeding after 19 days, at which point the adults begin foraging away from the nest. By 20–25 days, they can climb to the very top of the tree their nest is built on, or even into other trees. They can fly short distances at around 30 days of age (some take 35–38), but will still be dependent on adults for about two weeks after that. It is in their second year of life that juveniles begin to lose their white feathers.

===Predation===
There is circumstantial evidence that young black-crowned night herons and crab-eating raccoons prey on nestling little blue herons. Adults have been observed driving a yellow-headed caracara away from their nests. In the presence of a Harris&#x27; hawk, however, the little blue herons fled.

===Parasites===
Twenty-four different species of parasitic worms were found on 33 of 35 little blue herons examined in South Florida. These included trematodes, nematodes, acanthocephalans, and one cestode. The most common trematode was &quot;Posthodiplostomum macrocotyle&quot;, and the most common nematodes were &quot;Contracaecum multipapillatum&quot; and &quot;Contracaecum microcephalum&quot;. The acanthocephalan and cestode species could not be identified (in the latter, neither could the genus).

===Prey===
On the eastern coast of North America, little blue herons primarily feed on fish, however their diet varies significantly throughout their range. In a study of individuals in mangrove forests in southeastern Brazil, 80% of their diet during the breeding season was found to consist of crabs. Compared to the scarlet ibis, the herons preferred arboreal or semi-arboreal species, such as &quot;Aratus pisonii&quot; and &quot;Metasesarma rubripes&quot;, while the former preferred to take burrowing species. This demonstrates their different feeding strategies—scarlet ibises being foragers who hunt using their sense of touch and little blue herons being visual hunters. In another mangrove forest in southwestern Puerto Rico, the entire diet was found to consist of fiddler crabs.

==Conservation==

The little blue heron is listed as a least-concern species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, although its numbers are decreasing. Historically, they were not hunted for their feathers as much as other heron species due to their lack of visually attractive plumes.

The dangers faced by &quot;Egretta caerulea&quot; are not well researched. They could include development along coastlines, habitat disturbance, predators, pesticide exposure, and parasites. The metals cadmium and lead have been found to lead to slower growth rates and higher death rates, respectively, of young birds. In Sepetiba Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, little blue herons were found to have relatively high levels of metal contamination in the liver and kidneys.

In areas with cattle egrets, little blue herons have been found to nest for shorter amounts of time, and produce fewer young that survive to adulthood. Cattle egrets only begin pairing when most little blue herons already have eggs or live young in their nests. The former species has been observed stealing twigs from nests of the latter. This behavior sometimes leads to the young falling out of the nest or the cattle egrets removing them.

<text>The British Rail Class 13 was a type of diesel–electric shunting locomotive. The type was designed in 1965 because of the need to provide more powerful shunters for the Tinsley Marshalling Yard. Due to Tinsley&#x27;s status as a hump yard, it was not possible to use a single locomotive owing to the risk of grounding. So, to achieve the required power, a pair of shunters were permanently coupled in &quot;master and slave&quot; formation, with the slave unit having had its cab removed. Both units were then ballasted to improve traction. Initially coupled cab-to-cab, it was found more practical to couple master nose to slave cab.

==Units==
Three pairs were formed as follows:

==Withdrawal==
With the end of hump shunting at Tinsley the class became obsolete. The unique qualities of the locomotives were not required elsewhere and so withdrawal was inevitable; 13 002 was withdrawn in 1981, with the remaining two locomotives going with the closure of Tinsley hump in 1985. None of this unusual class survives.

<text>USS &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; (LCC-19) is the lead ship of the two amphibious command ships of the United States Navy, and is the flagship of the Seventh Fleet. Her primary role is to provide command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) support to the commander and staff of the United States Seventh Fleet. She is currently forward-deployed to U.S. Navy Fleet Activities, Yokosuka in Japan, and is the third Navy ship named after the Blue Ridge Mountains, a range of mountains in the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; is the oldest deployed warship of the U.S. Navy, following the decommissioning of . &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;, as the U.S. Navy&#x27;s active commissioned ship having the longest total period as active, flies the First Navy Jack instead of the jack of the United States. &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; is expected to remain in service until 2039.

==History==

&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was put &quot;in commission special&quot; on 14 November 1970, at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard as an Amphibious Command and Control (LCC) ship, with Captain Kent J. Carroll as the commanding officer. The ship was sponsored by Mrs. Gretchen Byrd, wife of the U.S. Senator from Virginia, Harry F. Byrd Jr. The principal speaker at the ceremony was John W. Warner, Under Secretary of the Navy and later Senator from Virginia.

&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was the replacement for , but &quot;Estes&quot; was decommissioned earlier than planned in October 1969 due to the budget cuts of the late 1960s.

&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was the lead ship of her class and represented almost seven years of planning and construction work. The result was a ship specifically designed from the keel up as a command and control ship. As designed, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was capable of supporting the staff of both the Commander of an Amphibious Task Force and the staff of the Commanding General of the Landing Force. The advanced computer system, extensive communications package and modern surveillance and detection systems was molded into the most advanced joint amphibious command and control center ever constructed.
At the time of her commissioning, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; joined her sister ship &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; as having the distinction of carrying the world&#x27;s most sophisticated electronics suites, which were said to be some thirty percent larger than that of the aircraft carrier , which had been the most complex. &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was armed with a &quot;main battery&quot; of computers, communications gear, and other electronic facilities to fulfill her mission as a command ship. An extremely refined communications system was also an integral part of the ship&#x27;s radical new design. Through an automated patch panel and computer controlled switching matrix her crew could use any combination of communication equipment desired. The clean topside area is the result of careful design intended to minimize the ship&#x27;s interference with her own communications system. U.S. Navy long-range communications were heavily reliant on high frequency radio systems in the 1970s and have evolved to predominantly satellite communications in the 2000s. This is illustrated by the long wire antennas and the directional HF yagi or log-periodic antenna initially installed on &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; and later removed and replaced with a number of satellite communications antennas.

Besides small arms, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was armed with two twin Mark 33 3&quot;/50 caliber guns at commissioning, though they have since been removed. She also carried two Mark 25 launchers and electronics for the Basic Point Defense Missile System (BPDMS) which was added sometime in the 1970s and removed in the 1990s. Two 20 mm Phalanx CIWS systems were added in the 1980s for point defense. In recent years she has also carried 25 mm Bushmaster cannons.

===1971===

In late January 1971, the ship conducted her first INSURV in the North Atlantic, after transiting the Delaware River, from and return to Philadelphia.

On 11 February 1971, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; steamed on her maiden voyage from the shipyard to the ship&#x27;s first homeport, San Diego, California, around South America via the Strait of Magellan, making liberty calls at Norfolk, Virginia (15 February), Rio de Janeiro (4–6 March), Lima (20–22 March), Rodman Naval Station, Panama Canal Zone (27–28 March), and Acapulco (2–5 April). &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;″s beam is , but the Panama Canal locks at that time were only , creating problems for the &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;-class of ships with fenders and barges for the sponsons.

As the ship crossed the equator on 26 February at 38 degrees and 24 minutes longitude, bound for Rio de Janeiro, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; performed her first crossing the line ceremony, initiating the &quot;wog&quot; majority of the crew, except for one.
Upon entry to the Strait of Magellan, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; took on a passage pilot from the Chilean Navy for the transit. The Chilean patrol boat lost its mast and damaged one of &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;″s basket antennas, just aft of the port sponson, in the boarding operation.

In &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;″s transit from Lima to Rodman Naval Station, Panama, she was assigned the duty of going to the aid of any U.S. tuna fishing boat being harassed or captured by the Ecuadorian Navy because they were fishing in a claimed fishing zone that the U.S. did not recognize. This was known as the Tuna War, but no incident occurred.

&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; arrived at San Diego on 9 April, with Rear Admiral David M. Rubel, U.S. Navy, Commander Amphibious Group Three and staff embarked. Rear Admiral Rubel is the first Flag Officer embarked on &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;. Amphibious Group Three staff came aboard &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; at the Rodman port call with the next port call being Acapulco.

The rest of the year was highlighted by Command Post Exercises 3–7 May and 11–13 August. Refresher training was conducted in late June and early July. &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; acted as amphibious task force and landing force flagship for the major amphibious training exercise of the year, ROPEVAL WESTCO (3-71), from 8–16 September.
For &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;″s first drydock since the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, from 11 October to 19 November she was in the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for Post Shakedown availability. &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;″s power plant was switched from Navy Standard Oil fuel to Navy Distillate fuel.

===1972===
From 1972 until 1979, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific on 6 WestPacs, as the flagship of the Commander Amphibious Force, Seventh Fleet.

===February - WestPac I===

After completing degaussing in the deperming facility at Ballast Point, on 7 January 1972, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; departed home port San Diego and steamed to Pearl Harbor for deployment on the ship&#x27;s first WestPac, with port visits at Guam, Sasebo, Japan, White Beach, Okinawa, Subic Bay, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Making the next leg of the transit to WestPac, Guam, with and , During the transit, four Soviet reconnaissance aircraft overflew the convoy to collect data on the new ship.

As the ship crossed the equator on 27 February 1972 at , bound for Singapore, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; performed her second crossing the line ceremony.

Upon arrival at White Beach, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; became the flagship for Commander Amphibious Group 1], Rear Admiral W. D. TOOLE, in this relieving USS Paul Revere (LPA-248).

Additional port visits were planned, but in late March 1972, as &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; prepared at White Beach, Okinawa for exercise Golden Dragon, North Vietnam invaded South Vietnam across the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on 30 March 1972 in their Easter Offensive. This was the largest invasion since the Korean War, radically departing from previous offensives. It was designed to strengthen the North Vietnamese position as the Paris Peace Accords drew towards a conclusion.

====April - Easter Offensive====
On 3 April 1972, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet (CinCPac) Admiral John S. McCain Jr. cancelled Exercise Golden Dragon. General Miller and the 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade (9th MAB) staff were ordered to remain on &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; for combat or evacuation operations. The 9th MAB had various contingency plans from potentially conducting emergency evacuations to building up their forces.

On 5 April 1972, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; departed for the war zone, the Gulf of Tonkin. &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was the command ship during April through July for the last major combat amphibious engagement of the Vietnam War. The Easter Counter-Offensive was &quot;the largest concentration of wartime amphibious force since the Inchon and Wonsan landings of the Korean War.&quot;

Detachment &quot;N&quot; of the 1st Radio Battalion, which collected radio messages to gain signals intelligence, had deployed with the 9th MAB for the exercise in Korea. It was integrated with the Task Force 76 Joint Intelligence Center and operated from the supplemental radio spaces of &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; using input from the service cryptologic agencies in Southeast Asia. However, operating from &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; posed reception problems because of the distance from shore. From 24 April 1972, two or three direct support elements were in operation from naval gunfire ships at any one time, with control remaining at the headquarters element on &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;. In July 1972, they moved to and when &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; returned to the United States, detachment analysts relocated to the Naval Communications Station, San Miguel, near San Antonio, Zambales, Philippines. As CTU 76.0.1, escorted by , &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; conducted special operations in the Tonkin Gulf in Operation Venture Road.

====June - The Counter-Offensive====
With a lull in the fighting and 64 days at sea, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; made a port call to Subic, from 7 to 14 June, for supplies and sanity, then returned to the Gulf of Tonkin.

Nguyen Van Thieu, president of South Vietnam, came aboard &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; on 28 June 1972 to confer with Vice Admiral Holloway, Admiral Gaddis, General Miller and &quot;to convey his personal thanks to the sailors and Marines of the amphibious forces for &#x27;the preservation of Peace and Freedom&#x27; in South Vietnam.&quot;

On the first of July, while steaming outside of Da Nang Harbor, in the combat zone and the ship&#x27;s port 3-inch gun manned, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; had her first change of command. That day was also the day that &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; earned the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal.

The Easter Counter-Offensive was &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;″s longest time at sea, 64 days from 5 April to 7 June 1972. After 7 days in Subic, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; returned to the Gulf of Tonkin until 18 July 1972 and was then ordered to the Philippines for typhoon relief along with &quot;Tripoli&quot;, &quot;Juneau&quot;, &quot;Alamo&quot;, and &quot;Cayuga&quot;. &quot;The 33d MAU and subordinate units were awarded the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation for their efforts&quot;, but &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was not.

On 18 August 1972, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; returned to San Diego. In September the ship received aboard, CNO Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. and Secretary of the Navy, John Warner for visits. From 5 thru 9 October, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; made a port visit to San Francisco, training and a First Fleet sponsored event.

===1973===
===WestPac II===
From 12 February 1973 until 4 April 1973, Operation Homecoming, returning POWs from Hanoi and VC camps in South Vietnam went to Clark Air Base in the Philippines. With &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; still in her homeport of San Diego, the current ship&#x27;s intelligence officer and prior ship&#x27;s intelligence officer contributed to the operation. &quot;The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines each had liaison officers dedicated to prepare for the return of American POWs well in advance of their actual return. These liaison officers worked behind the scenes traveling around the United States assuring the returnees well being. They also were responsible for debriefing POWs to discern relevant intelligence about MIAs and to discern the existence of war crimes committed against them.&quot;

On 24 February 1973, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; left San Diego for Pearl Harbor (2–3 March) and her second WestPac, with liberty port visits of Sasebo (7–14 June), Yokosuka (25 July-5 Aug), White Beach (15–31 March, 11 April, 16 Aug, 4-19 Sept), Hong Kong (7–12 May), Subic (26 March-5 April, 22-26 Sept, 7-8 Oct), Manila, Singapore (24-29 Aug) and Chilung (1–5 June). &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; conducted training exercises: Operation Golden Dragon in early April off South Korea, Operation Pagasa I in middle May off Philippines, Operation Pagasa II in early October off Philippines.

With Operation End Sweep progressing in the coastal waters of North Vietnam for the mines released there, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; left White Beach again on 10 July 1973 headed for the Gulf of Tonkin. She carried equipment that was needed by U.S. helicopters that were involved in clearing mined North Vietnamese waters. &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; spent two nights in north Vietnamese waters off the coast of Vinh and Hon Matt before departing for Manila in the Philippines.

===Arab Oil Embargo===
Because of the problems associated with the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;, on the transit back to White Beach, Okinawa from port call in Singapore, became the first Seventh Fleet combatant ship to refuel at sea with a commercial tanker, taking on some 158,000 gallons of Navy distillate from the &quot;Falcon Princess&quot;.

Late in &quot;Blue Ridge&#x27;s&quot; second WestPac, the ship was conducting a joint exercise with the Philippine Navy in the South China Sea called PAGASA II, as the command ship. One of &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;″s ensigns went overboard unnoticed and when found absent for a watch muster, a compartment search was conducted aboard the ship for the missing officer. With failure to find him on 28 September 1973, a search and rescue operation commenced without success. Two days later the ensign was declared missing at sea and Exercise PAGASA II resumed. On Monday, 1 October 1973, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow was notified that the Soviet trawler AGI &quot;Kursograph&quot; found an American sailor in &quot;Blue Ridge&#x27;s&quot; operation area and the ensign was returned safely to &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; the next day after diplomatic negotiations.

At the end of Pagasa II, bad tropical weather forced the transfer of the staff from &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; to &quot;Denver&quot;, after a very short stay in Subic Bay, to occur in White Beach instead, on 7 October. On 8 October, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; steamed for homeport San Diego carrying a Patrol Craft Fast on the helicopter deck. &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; arrived in San Diego 23 October [1973].

===1975===
===WestPac III===
Late in March 1975 and late in &quot;Blue Ridge&#x27;s&quot; third WestPac, the deteriorating military and political situation in Cambodia and South Vietnam disrupted &quot;Blue Ridge&#x27;s&quot; operational plans as had occurred in late March 1972.

===Evacuation of Saigon===
&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was at White Beach, Okinawa when the 9th MAB was alerted on 25 March 1975 for immediate departure to Da Nang to reinforce U.S. facilities, but &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; did not get underway for Vietnam until 27 March. Marines and sailors hastily trained for crowd control, evacuation procedures, and a Vietnamese orientation course. The printing section on board &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; reproduced thousands of signs in Vietnamese including a simplified instruction card for the small unit leader that included basic Vietnamese phrases and human relations oriented &quot;do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts. However North Vietnamese forces captured Da Nang on 29 March.
On 12 April, in response to the Cambodian government&#x27;s crumbling defenses around the capital of Phnom Penh, Operation Eagle Pull evacuated 289 Americans, Cambodians and third country nationals by helicopter to the .

After the end of the Battle of Xuân Lộc on 21 April, President Thieu resigned and fled into exile and North Vietnamese forces surrounded Saigon. The fixed wing evacuation from Tan Son Nhut Airport was halted by North Vietnamese artillery fire on the morning of 29 April and the helicopter evacuation Operation Frequent Wind commenced. Admiral Gayler directed USSAG/Seventh Air Force and Seventh Fleet to begin Frequent Wind Option IV at 10:51 (Saigon time), but for some unexplainable reason, dissemination of this message to the participating units had been delayed from 10:52 until 12:15. Evacuation helicopters finally departed with the first wave started landing at 15:06 and returning to fleet at 15:40 with the first load of evacuees.

The commanding officer of ProvMAG 39, Colonel McLenon, exercised control of his Marine aircraft through the Tactical Air Coordination Center (TACC) on board &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;. The Helicopter Direction Center on board &quot;Okinawa&quot;, maintained aircraft spacing and routing. The primary difference between TACC and HDC was that TACC controlled the tactical disposition of the helicopters and HDC controlled the helicopters as long as they were in the Navy&#x27;s airspace. These areas of responsibility often overlapped and at times even merged. Under the conditions existing on the morning of 29 April 1975, the difference in control responsibilities of TACC and HDC at best seemed blurred, at worst redundant. Coordination and control of the overall embarkation operation suffered from more serious communication problems. Direct communications with Admiral Whitmire and 9th MAB Rear were sporadic, at best, requiring a continuous relay by the C-130 Airborne Battlefield Command and Control Center.

The sky over the evacuation fleet was soon filled with Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) helicopters, looking for a place to land and unload their passengers. Five helicopters crashed on the ship that day, not counting ones ditched or abandoned overboard. One crashed, causing a near disaster and showering the ship and personnel with debris. An NBC film crew, with reporter George Lewis, filmed this unexpected arrival of RVNAF helicopters on the flight deck of &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;, showing the processing of the refugees and two helicopters&#x27; rotor blades colliding. To free up space on the flight deck, RVNAF helicopters were ditched by their pilots in the South China Sea after unloading their refugees on ship. Along with the widely published photo of an RVNAF UH-1 &quot;Huey&quot; being pushed over the side of &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;, they filmed one unknown crew member being tossed into a flight deck safety net by the movement of the chopper going over the side.

The evacuation continued until the morning of 30 April with the last helicopter evacuating the Marine Security Guards from the roof of the U.S. Embassy at 07:53 and landing on USS &quot;Okinawa&quot; at 08:30. At 11:30 North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the gates of the Presidential Palace less than 1 km from the Embassy and raised the flag of the Viet Cong over the building, ending the Vietnam War.

===1980s===

With the decommissioning of the 7th Fleet Flagship cruiser in December 1979, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; became the new flagship of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, and has been forward deployed at the Yokosuka Naval Base, Japan ever since.

From 21 July 1979 through 30 June 1984, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; and other ships in the West Pacific engaged in operation Boat People, receiving the Humanitarian Service Medal, rescuing refugees from Vietnam. For example, on 6 October 1980 while transiting the South China Sea, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; embarked Vietnamese refugees onboard from two separate small boats. The first being sighted before noon contained 54 total refugees. The second containing 37 were embarked onboard &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; shortly after 1800. Both boats were dangerously overloaded, and adrift when sighted. Of the 54 total refugees aboard the first boat, all were in good health, having been to sea only a few days. Of the 37 total refugees aboard the second boat, all were severely dehydrated, many so weak they could not stand, and had to be hoisted aboard &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;. Mechanical failure of the second boat had left the 37 adrift well short of the shipping lane. Initially it was unclear how long they had been at sea, though they had been without potable water for many days. Also on 15 May 1984 &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; rescued 35 refugees in the South China Sea, northeast of Cam Ranh Bay.

In May 1989, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;, &quot;Sterett&quot; and visited Shanghai, China. They were the first U.S. warships to enter Shanghai Harbor in 40 years and it was only the second visit by U.S. warships to the People&#x27;s Republic of China since 1949.

===1990s===
&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; performed a nine-and-a-half–month deployment as flagship for commander, United States Naval Forces Central Command (ComUSNavCent), during Operations Desert Shield, and Desert Storm from 28 August 1990 through 24 April 1991, receiving a Navy Unit Commendation.

In July 1996, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; visited Vladivostok for the 300th Anniversary of the Russian Navy.

===2000s===
Blue Ridge participated in the international force East Timor (INTERFET) in February 2000. 

&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; participates routinely in U.S. and allied training exercises each year with countries throughout the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean. For example, in 2009 &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; participated in ANNUALEX 21G (Annual Exercise 21G) with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and PASSEX (Passing Exercise) with the French Navy.
===2010s===
&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was one of several participating in disaster relief in Operation Tomodachi, after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; brought relief supplies from Singapore to Japan but remained in the vicinity of Okinawa where the embarked U.S. Seventh Fleet staff provided command and control for the duration of Operation Tomodachi. The Seventh Fleet Band disembarked from &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; in order to provide the Japanese public with concerts dedicated to the victims of the tsunami. On 9 May 2010, sailors from &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; took part in a Victory Day Parade of the Russian Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet in the city of Vladivostok, being assembled on the city square next to French sailors. The officer inspecting the parade greeted the sailors, to which the sailors responded with a Russian-style threefold loud &quot;Ura&quot;.

===2020s===
On 25 January 2020, an MH-60S helicopter attached to the ship crashed approximately from Okinawa, Japan. Following search and rescue efforts all five crewmembers were found uninjured.

The ship is expected to remain in service until 2039.

==Awards==

On 18 July 1972, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was awarded the Combat Action Ribbon for her action at Tiger Island, and on 9 August 1972, the ship was awarded the Battle &quot;E&quot; by the commander Amphibious Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet. It was the only one &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; received prior to substantial changes made to the award in 1976 and is not listed as a Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon on the unit awards page. &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; received 15 Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon awards from 1977 to 2010.

&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal and has two campaign stars one for Consolidation II &#x27;72 Campaign and the second for Vietnam Ceasefire &#x27;72 Campaign (Easter Counter-Offensive) with a total of 99 days in the combat zone, not counting 18 uncredited days in July 1972. &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; may have earned the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal for six months of service off South Vietnam from February to July 1972 as listed by NavSource.org. However, The Navy Unit awards page does not mention the award and the ship&#x27;s crew did not paint the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal on the ship&#x27;s bridge wing in 1993 or 2011.

Operation Eagle Pull (11–13 April 1975), the evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the Humanitarian Service Medal.

Operation Frequent Wind (29–30 April 1975), the evacuation of Saigon, South Vietnam, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the Humanitarian Service Medal. &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; received Humanitarian Service Medals for two different operations in 1980 and 1984 for rescuing Vietnamese boat people.

&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; received the ship&#x27;s second Navy Unit Commendation along with the Southwest Asia Service Medal, the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia) and Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait) for Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The ship was also awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award and the Humanitarian Service Medal during Operation Tomodachi.

&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; earned the Captain Edward F. Ney Memorial Award several times, including 2010.

<text>Osthryth (died 697), queen of the Mercians, was the wife of King Æthelred and daughter of King Oswiu of Northumbria and his second wife Eanflæd. She probably married Æthelred before 679 and was murdered by the nobles of Mercia.

Osthryth was not the first of her family to become a Mercian queen. Her sister Alhflæd had married Peada, King of South Mercia 654–656. After the death of Peada, who was allegedly murdered with Alhflæd&#x27;s connivance, and possibly Osthryth&#x27;s as well, she retreated to Fladbury in Worcestershire, to judge both from the place-name, which means &quot;stronghold of Flæde&quot;, and from its subsequent history: sometime in the 690s Æthelred granted Fladbury to Oftfor, Bishop of Worcester, to re-establish monastic life there; however, this grant was later contested by Æthelheard, son of Oshere, who maintained that Æthelred had no right to give Fladbury away, as it had been the property of Osthryth. Æthelheard claimed it as her kinsman and heir.

Æthelred and Osthryth loved and favoured Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire. Osthryth placed there the bones of her uncle Oswald of Northumbria, who was venerated as a saint. It is clear from this story that Osthryth played a part in promoting the cult of St Oswald. Many years later she persuaded Oswald&#x27;s widow Cyneburh to take the veil.

Osthryth had to contend with major conflicts of loyalty. In 679 her brother Ecgfrith of Northumbria fought a battle against Æthelred, in which Ecgfrith&#x27;s brother Ælfwine was killed. Bede tells us that he was &quot;a young man of about eighteen years of age and much beloved in both kingdoms, for King Æthelred had married his sister.&quot;

The murder of Osthryth in 697 by Mercian nobles is unexplained in the sources that mention it. Ann Williams attributes it to the hostility between the Mercians and the Northumbrians, while D. P. Kirby suggests that it may have been revenge for her sister&#x27;s alleged involvement in Peada&#x27;s murder. H. P. R. Finberg speculates that she and her kinsman Oshere were suspected of trying to detach the kingdom of the Hwicce from Mercian overlordship.

Osthryth was buried at Bardney Abbey.

Osthryth was probably the mother of Æthelred&#x27;s son, Ceolred, king of Mercia from 709 to 716.

<doc id="589917" wikidata="Q2898480" url="?curid=589917" title="Strategic depth">
<text>Strategic depth is a term in military literature that broadly refers to the distances between the front lines or battle sectors and the combatants&#x27; industrial core areas, capital cities, heartlands, and other key centers of population or military production.

== Concept ==
The key precepts any military commander must consider when dealing with strategic depth are how vulnerable these assets are to a quick, preemptive attack or to a methodical offensive and whether a country can withdraw into its own territory, absorb an initial thrust, and allow the subsequent offensive to culminate short of its goal and far from its source of power.

Commanders must be able to plan for both eventualities, and have measures and resources in place on both tactical and strategic levels to counter any and all stages of a minor or major enemy attack. The measures do not need to be limited to purely-military assets since the ability to reinforce civilian infrastructure or make it flexible enough to withstand or evade assault is very useful in times of war. The issue was the tradeoff between space and time as witnessed by Germany’s failure to defeat the Soviet Union in 1942. In the face of a German invasion, the Soviet military retreated from occupied Poland in June 1941 to the outskirts of Moscow in December 1941, which allowed the Soviet Union to move its industrial base to the east of the Ural Mountains. Thus, the industries that had been moved were able to produce the resources that were needed for the Soviet counterattack.

==In reference to Pakistan==

In Pakistan, the idea of strategic depth was perceived in 1980s by the National Defence University, Pakistan, professor General Mirza Aslam Beg (later Chief of Army Staff working under Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1980s). Since then, the Pakistan military establishment has been repeatedly accused of forming a policy that seeks to control Afghanistan, a policy often referred to by the media as &quot;strategic depth&quot;, which is used as the reason for Pakistan&#x27;s support of certain factions of the Taliban in Afghanistan. In the years 2014–2015, with Pakistan&#x27;s domestic operation against militants in full swing, Pakistani military leaders said that they adhered to no such policy.

===Accusations against the Pakistan military===
The term &quot;strategic depth&quot; has been used in reference to Pakistan&#x27;s utilization and contact with Afghanistan following the neighboring country&#x27;s Soviet intervention, to prevent encirclement from a hostile India and a USSR-supported Afghanistan. Some sources state that the policy to control Afghanistan was formulated by NDU professor, General Mirza Aslam Beg, and an Indian source claims this was continued as an active policy by the Pakistan Armed Forces until the policy was &quot;de jure abolished in 1998 and de facto abolished in 2001&quot;, period when General Pervez Musharraf was the Chairman joint chiefs.

According to Richard Olson, U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, Pakistan military&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;strategic depth&quot; is a concept in which Pakistan uses Afghanistan as an instrument of strategic security in ongoing tensions with India by attempting to control Afghanistan as a pawn for its own political purposes.

It has been speculated that the Pakistan military&#x27;s &quot;strategic depth&quot; policy is either military or non-military in nature. The military version would state that the Pakistan military wishes to use Afghan territory as a &quot;strategic rallying point&quot; where they can, in the event of a successful Indian attack, retreat to and re-group for a counter-attack. The non-military version would be based on the idea that Pakistan can improve relations with other Islamic countries and former Soviet states such as Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, developing improved economic and cultural ties with them and thus making them into strong allies against India.

===View of the Pakistan military===
The former chief of army staff General Ashfaq Kayani and previously the director-general of the ISI, has repeatedly stated to the media that the Pakistan armed force&#x27;s &quot;strategic depth&quot; policy with regards to Afghanistan is not to &quot;control&quot; Afghanistan but to ensure a &quot;peaceful, friendly and stable&quot; relationship with Afghanistan. This policy therefore aims to ensure that Pakistan will not be threatened with long-term security problems on its Western border with Afghanistan. According to Kayani, a &#x27;talibanised&#x27; Afghanistan is not in Pakistan&#x27;s interests.

According to Ejaz Haider, a Pakistani military journalist, there is a confusion in the media regarding the policy on using Afghan territory to as a fallback area for Pakistan military assets. Haider blames General Mirza Aslam Beg for proposing this when he was the chief of army staff of the Pakistan Army under Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, stating that this concept &quot;was unpopular even when he was the chief and it has never been entertained by serious military planners. No one thinks of placing military and other assets in Afghanistan and thus acquiring strategic depth.&quot; Haider states that such a concept has always been impossible &quot;for a host of reasons&quot; and strategic depth is better used to describe achieving security through improving relationships with the governments of neighbouring countries such as Afghanistan and India.

Lieutenant-General Asad Durrani of ISI, has rubbished claims in the media regarding Pakistan intending to use Afghan territory as &quot;strategic depth&quot;. He also denies accusations that the Pakistan military has tried to &quot;install a friendly government in Kabul&quot; in order to &quot;secure this depth&quot;. He gives the Soviet Union as an example, stating that &quot;after the Saur Revolution, the Soviets executed an installed president every three months in pursuit of that objective&quot; and these policies later resulted in the defeat of the Soviets in Afghanistan. He argues that the notion of Pakistan using Afghan territory for its own purposes is a &quot;distortion of a concept or of history&quot; and is being used to vilify Pakistan.

==In Israel==

Israel is a narrow country, and its internationally recognized borders leave it just across at its widest point and at its narrowest (between Tulkarm and Tel Aviv). A number of Israeli leaders (originally Abba Eban) have referred to Israel&#x27;s internationally recognized borders (those the country had from 1948 to 1967) as the &quot;Auschwitz borders&quot; because of the perceived danger of annihilation by regional foes. Since 1967, Israel has occupied the West Bank, somewhat widening the area under the military&#x27;s effective control.

To compensate for the lack of strategic depth, Israel puts a great importance on deterrence (partially by threat of nuclear weapons), superior firepower, and the use of pre-emptive war to prevent threats from encroaching on Israeli territory. Yitzhak Rabin said about the Six-Day War (considered a classic example of pre-emption):
The basic philosophy of Israel was not to initiate war, unless an active war was carried out against us. We then lived within the lines prior to the Six-Day War, lines that gave no depth to Israel—and therefore, Israel was in a need, whenever there would be a war, to go immediately on the offensive—to carry the war to the enemy&#x27;s land.

Israeli leaders consider the issue of strategic depth to be important in negotiating its final borders as part of the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. Issues of contention include the West Bank settlements and potential Israeli control of the Jordan Valley after the creation of a Palestinian state.

<doc id="589919" wikidata="Q1117331" url="?curid=589919" title="Nimrod (1867 ship)">
<text>Nimrod was a wooden-hulled, three-masted sailing ship with auxiliary steam engine that was built in Scotland in 1867 as a whaler. She was the ship with which Ernest Shackleton made his &quot;Nimrod&quot; Expedition to Antarctica in 1908–09. After the expedition she returned to commercial service, and in 1919 she was wrecked in the North Sea with the loss of ten members of her crew.

==Building and registration==
Alexander Stephen and Sons built &quot;Nimrod&quot; in Dundee. She was launched on 6 December 1866, and completed in January 1867. Her registered length was , her beam was and her depth was . Her tonnages were and . She was rigged as a schooner. She had a single screw, driven by a 50 hp steam engine built by Gourlay Brothers of Dundee.

Her principal owner was Thomas B Job, who registered her at Liverpool. Her United Kingdom official number was 55047. They used her for whaling and seal hunting.

By 1874 &quot;Nimrod&quot; was rigged as a barquentine. By 1888 her owners were listed as Job Brothers. By 1889 she had the code letters KWVT, and in that year Job Brothers re-registered her in St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. By 1891 her original engine had been replaced by a two-cylinder compound engine built by Westray, Copeland &amp; Co of Barrow-in-Furness. It was rated at 60 hp and gave her a speed of only .

==&quot;Nimrod&quot; expedition==
In 1907 the shipbuilder William Beardmore bought &quot;Nimrod&quot; and re-registered her in London as a yacht to serve as Shackleton&#x27;s expedition ship. The purchase price was £5,000. She was in poor condition, needing caulking and renewal of her masts. In June 1907 she reached London, where she was overhauled.

King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra visited the ship, and on 11 August she left for Antarctica, captained by Rupert England. She sailed via Australia and New Zealand, and on 1 January 1908 she left New Zealand for the Southern Ocean. To conserve coal in &quot;Nimrod&quot;″s limited bunkers, the Union Steam Ship Company cargo steamship &quot;Koonya&quot; towed her as far as the Antarctic Circle, a distance of about . The Union Company Chairman Sir James Mills and the New Zealand Government each paid half the cost of the tow. From 14 January &quot;Nimrod&quot; continued under her own power.
On 29 January 1908 &quot;Nimrod&quot; reached McMurdo Sound on 3 February she reached Cape Royds, where she landed Shackleton&#x27;s equipment and expedition team. Shackleton became dissatisfied with Captain England, who often moved &quot;Nimrod&quot; away from shore when he feared the sea ice was unsafe. On 22 February she finished unloading and left for New Zealand, leaving Shackleton&#x27;s party ashore to make their expedition.

Shackleton had Captain England replaced by Frederick Pryce Evans, who had captained &quot;Koonya&quot; when she towed &quot;Nimrod&quot; south in January 1908. In January 1909 Evans brought &quot;Nimrod&quot; back to Antarctica to rendezvous with the returning expedition team, which Shackleton had split into parties, each with its own objective. The &quot;Northern Party&quot; had explored Victoria Land, and on 2 February 1909 reached its arranged rendezvous point to meet the ship, but heavy drifting snow prevented &quot;Nimrod&quot;″s lookouts from seeing the Northern Party&#x27;s camp. She continued to the Ferrar Glacier, where she picked up a three-man party who had been doing geological work. She then returned, and two days later succeeded in finding and re-embarking the Northern Party.
&quot;Nimrod&quot; then anchored off the Erebus Glacier Tongue, and between 28 February and 4 March re-embarked Shackleton&#x27;s &quot;Southern Party&quot;, who had made the first successful ascent of Mount Erebus and had unsuccessfully tried to reach the South Pole. She had now re-embarked all of Shackleton&#x27;s team and left Antarctica, reaching New Zealand on 23 March 1909. Shackleton&#x27;s team named some features of Antarctica&#x27;s geography after the ship, including the Nimrod Glacier.

==Later career and loss==
By 1911 Shackleton owned &quot;Nimrod&quot;. In 1913 her owner was a Roland V Webster. By 1917 her owner was The SS Nimrod Ltd, her manager was an Emile Dickers, and her code letters were JNFD.

In January 1919 &quot;Nimrod&quot;, commanded by a Captain Duncan, left Blyth, Northumberland with a cargo of coal for Calais. On the night of 29–30 January she ran aground on the Barber Sands off Caister-on-Sea, Norfolk. Her engine room flooded, killing her chief engineer. Her remaining 11 crew sheltered under her bridge. They fired distress flares, which were seen ashore. The Caister lifeboat tried to reach her, but was unsuccessful. &quot;Nimrod&quot;″s crew launched her lifeboat, but the heavy sea capsized it. After six hours the boat was driven ashore, with two survivors clinging to it.

The bodies of seven of her crew were washed ashore. Captain Duncan&#x27;s body was found north of Caister. Five bodies were found between Gorleston-on-Sea and Hopton-on-Sea, and one was found at California.

<doc id="589920" wikidata="Q1053936" url="?curid=589920" title="Sanskrit literature">
<text>Sanskrit literature is a broad term for all literature composed in Sanskrit. This includes texts composed in the earliest attested descendant of the Proto-Indo-Aryan language known as Vedic Sanskrit, texts in Classical Sanskrit as well as some mixed and non-standard forms of Sanskrit. Literature in the older language begins during the Vedic period with the composition of the Ṛg·veda between about 1500 and 1000 BCE, followed by other Vedic works right up to the time of the grammarian Pāṇini around 6th or 4th century BCE (after which Classical Sanskrit texts gradually became the norm).

Vedic Sanskrit is the language of the extensive liturgical works of the Vedic religion, while Classical Sanskrit is the language of many of the prominent texts associated with the major Indian religions, especially Hinduism and the Hindu texts, but also Buddhism, and Jainism. Some Sanskrit Buddhist texts are also composed in a version of Sanskrit often called Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit or Buddhistic Sanskrit, which contains many Middle Indic (prakritic) elements not found in other forms of Sanskrit.

Early works of Sanskrit literature were transmitted through an oral tradition for centuries before they were written down in manuscript form.

While most Sanskrit texts were composed in ancient India, others were composed in Central Asia, East Asia or Southeast Asia.

Sanskrit literature is vast and includes Hindu texts, religious scripture, various forms of poetry (such as epic and lyric), drama and narrative prose. It also includes substantial works covering secular and technical sciences and the arts. Some of these subjects include: law and custom, grammar, politics, economics, medicine, astrology-astronomy, arithmetic, geometry, music, dance, dramatics, magic and divination, and sexuality.

== Overview ==

Literature in the Vedic and the Classical language differ in numerous respects. The Vedic literature that survives is almost entirely religious, being focused on the prayers, hymns to the gods (devas), sacrifices and other concerns of the Vedic religion. The language of this archaic literature (the earliest being the Rigveda), Vedic Sanskrit, is different in many ways (and much less regular) than the &quot;classical&quot; Sanskrit described by later grammarians like Pāṇini. This literature was transmitted orally during the Vedic period, only later was it written down.

Classical Sanskrit literature is more varied and includes the following genres: scripture (Hindu, Buddhist and Jain), epics, court poetry (kavya), lyric, drama, romance, fairytale, fables, grammar, civil and religious law (dharma), the science of politics and practical life, the science of love and sexual intercourse (kama), philosophy, medicine, astronomy, astrology and mathematics, and is largely secular in subject-matter. On the other hand, the Classical Sanskrit language was much more formalized and homogeneous, partly due to the influence of Sanskrit grammarians like Pāṇini and his commentators.

Sanskrit was an important language for medieval Indian religious literature. Most pre-modern Hindu literature and philosophy was in Sanskrit and a significant portion of Buddhist literature was also written in either classical Sanskrit or Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. Many of these Sanskrit Buddhist texts were the basis for later translation into the Chinese Buddhist Canon and Tibetan Canon. Many Jain texts were also written in Sanskrit, like the &quot;Tattvartha sutra&quot;, Bhaktamara Stotra, etc.

Classical Sanskrit also served as a common language of scholarship and elites (as opposed to local vernacular who were only understood regionally).

The invasions of northern India by Islamic powers in the 13th century severely damaged Indian Sanskrit scholarship and the dominance of Islamic power over India eventually contributed to the decline of this scholarly language, especially since Muslim rulers promoted Middle Eastern languages. However, Sanskrit remains in use throughout India, and is used in rituals, religious practice, scholarship, art, and other Indian traditions.

== Vedic literature ==
=== Chronology ===
Five chronologically distinct strata can be identified within the literature of Vedic Sanskrit:

# Ṛg·vedic Hymns
# Mantras
# Saṃhitā prose
# Brāhmaṇa prose
# Sūtras

The first three are commonly grouped together, as the Saṃhitās comprising the four Vedas: ṛk, atharvan, yajus, sāman, which together constitute the oldest texts in Sanskrit and the canonical foundation both of the Vedic religion, and the later religion known as Hinduism.

=== Ṛg·veda ===
The Ṛg·veda, the first and oldest of the four Vedas, is the foundation for the others. The Ṛg·veda is made of 1028 hymns named &quot;sūktas&quot;, composed of verses in strictly regulated meters. These are collected into saṃhitās. There are about 10,000 of these verses that make up the Ṛg·veda. The Ṛg·vedic hymns are subdivided into 10 &quot;maṇḍala&quot;s, most of which are attributed to members of certain families. Composition of the Ṛg·vedic hymns was entirely oral, and for much of its history, the Ṛg·veda has been transmitted only orally, written down likely no sooner than in the second half of the first millennium of the Common Era.

=== The later Vedas ===
The &quot;Sāmaveda&quot; is not an original composition: it&#x27;s almost entirely (except 75) made of stanzas taken from the &quot;Ṛgveda&quot; and rearranged with reference to their place in the Soma sacrifice. This book is meant to be sung to certain fixed melodies, and may thus be called the book of chants, &quot;sāman&quot;. The &quot;Yajurveda&quot; like the &quot;Sāman&quot; is also largely made of verses taken from the &quot;Ṛgveda&quot;, but also contains several prose formulas. It is called the book of sacrificial prayers &quot;yajus&quot;.

The last of the four, the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;, both by the internal structure of the language used and by comparison with the Ṛg·veda, is a much later work. However, the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; represents a much earlier stage of thought of the Vedic people, being composed mainly of spells and incantations appealing to demons, and is rife with notions of witchcraft, derived from a much earlier period.

=== Brāhmaṇas ===
The &quot;Brāhmaṇas&quot; (a subdivision within the Vedas) concern themselves with the correct application of Vedic ritual, and the duties of the Vedic priest (hotṛ: &#x27;pourer, worshiper, reciter&#x27;) the word being derived from &quot;bráhman&quot; meaning &#x27;prayer&#x27;. They were composed at a period in time by which the Vedic hymns had achieved the status of being ancient and sacred revelations and the language had changed sufficiently so that the priests did not fully understand the Vedic texts. The &quot;Brāhmaṇas&quot; are composed in prose, unlike the previous works, forming some of the earliest examples of prose in any Indo-European language. The &quot;Brāhmaṇas&quot; intend to explain the relation between the sacred text and ritual ceremony.

The later part of the &quot;Brāhmaṇas&quot; contain material which also discuss theology and philosophy. These works were meant to be imparted or studied in the peace and calm of the forest, hence their name the &quot;Āraṇyaka&quot;s (&quot;Of the forest&quot;) The last part of these are books of Vedic doctrine and philosophy that came to be called &quot;Upaniṣads&quot; (&quot;sitting down beside&quot;). The doctrines in the Vedic or &quot;Mukhya&quot; &quot;Upaniṣads&quot; (the main and most ancient &quot;Upaniṣads)&quot; were later developed into the &quot;Vedānta&quot; (&quot;end of the Vedas&quot;) system.

=== Vedic Sūtras ===
The Vedic Sūtras were aphoristic treatises concerned either with Vedic ritual (Kalpa Vedanga) or customary law. They arrived during the later period of the &quot;Brāhmaṇas&quot; when a vast mass of ritual and customary details had been accumulated. To address this, the Sūtras are intended to provide a concise survey of Vedic knowledge through short aphoristic passages that could be easily memorized. The Sūtras forego the need to interpret the ceremony or custom, but simply provide a plain, methodical account with the utmost brevity. The word &quot;sūtra&quot;, derived from the root &quot;siv-&quot;, &#x27;to sew&#x27;, thus meaning &#x27;sewn&#x27; or &#x27;stitched together&#x27; eventually became a byword for any work of aphorisms of similar concision. The sutras in many cases are so terse they cannot be understood without the help of detailed commentaries.

The main types of Vedic Sūtras include the &quot;Śrauta sūtras&quot; (focusing on ritual), &quot;Śulbasûtra&quot; (on altar construction), &quot;Gṛhyasūtras&quot; which focus on rites of passage and &quot;Dharmasūtras.&quot;

== Hindu religious literature ==

Most ancient and medieval Hindu texts were composed in Sanskrit, either epic Sanskrit (the pre-classical language found in the two main Indian epics) or classical Sanskrit (Paninian Sanskrit). In modern times, most ancient texts have been translated into other Indian languages and some in Western languages. Prior to the start of the common era, the Hindu texts were composed orally, then memorized and transmitted orally, from one generation to next, for more than a millennium before they were written down into manuscripts. This verbal tradition of preserving and transmitting Hindu texts, from one generation to next, continued into the modern era.

=== Classification ===

Hindu Sanskrit texts are subdivided into two classes:

* &quot;Śruti&quot; (&quot;that which is heard&quot;) are believed to be &#x27;revealed&#x27;, such as the Vedas and the Upaniṣads.
* The &quot;Smṛti&quot; (&quot;that which is remembered&quot;) Sanskrit texts are a specific body of Hindu texts attributed to an author, as a derivative work they are considered less authoritative than &quot;Śruti&quot; in Hinduism. The &quot;Smṛti&quot; literature includes but is not limited to Vedāṅgas, Itihasas (the Hindu epics such as Mahabharata and Ramayana), the Sūtras and Śāstras, and the Purāṇas, while some traditions also include Kāvya (courtly poetry), &quot;Bhāṣyas&quot;, and numerous &quot;Nibandhas&quot; (digests) covering politics, ethics, culture, arts and society.

=== Indian Epics ===
The first traces of Indian epic poetry are seen in the Vedic literature, among the certain hymns of the Ṛgveda (which contain dialogues), as well as the Ākhyānas (ballads), Itihāsas (&#x27;traditional accounts of past events&#x27;) and the Purāṇas found in the Vedic Brāhmaṇas. These poems were originally songs of praise or heroic songs which developed into epic poems of increasing length over time. They were originally recited during important events such as during the Vedic horse sacrifice (the aśvamedha) or during a funeral.

Another related genre were the &quot;songs in praise of men&quot; (gāthā narasamsi), which focus on the glorious deeds of warriors and princes, which also developed into long epic cycles. These epic poems were recited by courtly bards called &quot;sūtas&quot;, who may have been their own caste and were closely related to the warrior caste. There was also a related group of traveling singers called kusilavas. Indian kings and princes seem to have kept bards in their courts which sung the praises of the king, recite poems at festivals and sometimes even recite poetry in battle to embolden the warriors.

While there were certainly other epic cycles, only two have survived, the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; and the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;.

==== &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; ====
The &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; is in a sense not just a single &#x27;epic poem&#x27;, but can be seen as a &quot;whole&quot; body of literature in its own right, a massive collection of many different poetic works built around the heroic tales of the Bharata tribe. Most of this literature was probably compiled between the 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE by numerous authors, with the oldest preserved parts not much older than around 400 BCE.

Already in the Ṛgveda, the &quot;Bharatas&quot; find mention as a warlike tribe, and the Brāhmaṇas also speak of Bharata, the son of Duṣyanta and Śakuntalā. The core of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; is a family feud in the royal house of the Kauravas (the descendants of Bharata), leading to a bloody battle at Kurukshetra. Over the centuries, an enormous mass of poetry, myths, legends, secondary tales, moral stories and more was added to the original core story. The final form of the epic is thus a massive 100,000 ślokas across 18+1 books.

According to Winternitz, the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; also shows the influence of the Brahmin class, which he argues was engaged in a project of appropriating the poetry of the bards (which was mainly a secular heroic literature) in order to infuse it with their religious theology and values.

The most influential part of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; is the &quot;Bhagavadgītā,&quot; which became a central scripture for the Vedanta school and remains widely read today.

Another important associated text, which acts as a kind of supplement (&quot;khila&quot;) to the &quot;Mahābhārata,&quot; is the &quot;Harivanhśa,&quot; which focuses on the figure of Krishna&quot;.&quot;

==== &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; ====
In contrast to the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; consists of only 24,000 ślokas divided into seven books, and in form is more purely regular, ornate epic poetry, a form of style which is the basis of the later Kāvya tradition. There are two parts to the story of the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;, which are narrated in the five genuine books. The first revolves around the events at the court of King Daśaratha at Ayodhya with one of his wives vying for the succession of the throne to her own son Bharata in place of the one chosen by the king, Rāma. The second part of the epic is full of myth and marvel, with the banished Rāma combating giants in the forest, and slaying thousands of demons. The second part also deals with the abduction of Rāmā&#x27;s wife, Sītā by king Rāvaṇa of Lankā, leading Rāma to carry out to expedition to the island to defeat the king in battle and recover his wife.

=== Purāṇa ===
The &quot;Purāṇa&quot; are a large class of Hindu scriptures which cover numerous topics such as myth, legends of the Hindu gods, cosmogony, cosmology, stories of ancient kings and sages, folk tales, information about temples, medicine, astronomy, grammar and Hindu theology and philosophy. Perhaps the most influential of these texts is the &quot;Bhāgavata Purāṇa&quot;, a central text for Vaishnava theology. Other &quot;Purāṇas&quot; center on different gods, like the &quot;Shiva Purāṇa&quot; and the &quot;Devī Bhāgavata Purāṇa.&quot;

=== Later Upaniṣads ===
The principal Upaniṣads can be considered Vedic literature since they are included within the &quot;Brahmanas&quot; and &quot;Aranyakas&quot;. However, numerous scriptures titled &quot;Upaniṣads&quot; continued to be composed after the closure of the Vedas proper. Of these later &quot;Upaniṣads&quot; there are two categories of texts:

* 95 canonical Upaniṣads which are part of the Muktikā canon. These were composed from about the last centuries of 1st-millennium BCE through about 15th-century CE.
* Newer paracanonical Upaniṣads, which were composed through the early modern and modern eras and which deal with numerous non-Vedic topics.

===Post-Vedic aphoristic literature===

Sūtra style aphoristic literature continued to be composed on numerous topics, the most popular being on the different fields of Hindu philosophy.

The main &quot;Sūtra&quot; texts (sometimes also called &quot;kārikās)&quot; on Hindu philosophy include:

* &quot;Sāṁkhyakārikā&quot;
* &quot;Sāṁkhyapravacanasūtra&quot;
* &quot;Mīmāṁsā Sūtra&quot;
* &quot;Nyāya Sūtra&quot;
* &quot;Vaiśeṣika Sūtra&quot;
* &quot;Yoga Sūtras&quot; of Patanjali
* &quot;Brahma Sūtra&quot; (i.e. &quot;Vedanta sutra&quot;)
* &quot;Gauḍapāda Kārikā&quot;
* &quot;Pāśupata Sūtras&quot;
* &quot;Shiva Sūtras&quot;
* &quot;Spandakārikā&quot;
* &quot;Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikā&quot; of Utpaladeva

=== Commentaries ===

The various Sanskrit literature also spawned a large tradition of commentary texts, which were called &quot;Bhāṣyas&quot;, &quot;Vṛṭṭis, Ṭīkās, Vārttikas&quot; and other names. These commentaries were written on numerous genres of Sanskrit texts, including on Sūtras, on Upaniṣads and on the Sanskrit epics.

Examples include the &quot;Yogabhāṣya&quot; on the &quot;Yoga Sūtras&quot;, Shankara&#x27;s &quot;Brahmasūtrabhāṣya,&quot; the &quot;Gītābhāṣya&quot; and &quot;Śrī Bhāṣya&quot; of Ramanuja (1017–1137), Pakṣilasvāmin Vātsyāyana&#x27;s &quot;Nyāya Sūtra Bhāṣya&quot; and the &quot;Matharavṛṭṭi&quot; (on the &quot;Sāṁkhyakārikā&quot;).

Furthermore, over time, secondary commentaries (i.e. a commentary to a commentary) also came to be written.

=== Tantric literature ===
There are a varied group of Hindu Tantric scriptures titled Tantras or Agamas. Gavin Flood argues that the earliest date for these Tantric texts is 600 CE, though most of them were probably composed after the 8th century onwards.

Tantric literature was very popular during the &quot;Tantric Age&quot; (c. 8th to the 14th century), a period of time when Tantric traditions rose to prominence and flourished throughout India. According to Flood, all Hindu traditions, Shaiva, Vaishnava, Smarta and Shakta (perhaps excepting the Srautas) became influenced by Tantric works and adopted some Tantric elements into their literature.

=== Other ===
There are also numerous other types of Hindu religious works, including prose and poetry.

Among prose works there are important works like the &quot;Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha&quot; (which is important in Advaita Vedanta), the &quot;Yoga-Yājñavalkya&quot; and the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; (a key Shakta work).

When it comes to poetry, there are numerous stotras (odes), suktas and stutis, as well as other poetic genres. Some important works of Hindu Sanskrit poetry include the &quot;Vivekacūḍāmaṇi,&quot; the &quot;Hanuman Chalisa&quot;, the &quot;Aṣṭāvakragītā&quot;, &quot;Bhaja Govindam,&quot; and the &quot;Shiva Tandava Stotra.&quot;

Another group of later Sanskrit Hindu texts are those which focus on Hatha Yoga, and include the &quot;Dattātreyayogaśāstra&quot; (13th century), the &quot;Gorakṣaśataka&quot; (13th century)&quot;,&quot; the &quot;Haṭhayogapradīpikā&quot; (15th century) and the &quot;Gheraṇḍasaṁhitā&quot; (17th or 18th-century).

==Scientific &amp; secular literature==
Over time, Sanskrit works on the secular sciences (&quot;śāstra&quot; or &quot;vidyā&quot;) were composed on a wide variety of topics. These include: grammar, poetry, lexicography, geometry, astronomy, medicine, worldly life and pleasure, philosophy, law, politics, etc.

The learning of these secular sciences took place by way of a guru expounding the subject orally, using works of aphorisms, the sūtra texts, which on account of their terseness would be meaningful only to those who knew how to interpret them. The &quot;bhāṣyas&quot;, the commentaries that followed the sūtras were structured in the style of student-teacher dialogue wherein a question is posed, a partial solution, the &quot;pūrvapakṣa&quot;, proposed, which is then handled, corrected and the final opinion established, the &quot;siddhānta&quot;. In time, the bhāṣyas evolved to become more like a lecture.

The sūtras were initially regarded as definite. This was later circumvented, in the field of grammar, by the creation of &quot;vārttikas&quot;, to correct or amend sūtras. Another form often employed was the &quot;śloka&quot;, which was a relatively simple metre, easy to write and remember. Sometimes a mix of prose and verse was used. Some of the later work, such as in law and poetics, developed a much clearer style which avoided a propensity towards obscurity that verse was prone to.

The study of these secular works was widespread in India. Buddhist institutions like Nalanda also focused on the study of four of these secular sciences, known as the vidyāsthānas. These are: linguistic science (sabdavidya), logical science (hetuvidya), medical science (cikitsavidya), science of fine arts and crafts (silpakarmasthanavidya). The fifth main topic studied at Buddhist universities were the spiritual sciences (adhyatmavidya). These Indian Sanskrit language disciples also had an influence on Himalayan cultures, like Tibet, which not only adopted Buddhist religious literature but also these secular works. The Tibetan scholar Sakya Pandita (1182–1251) was a well known scholar of Sanskrit, and promoted the study of these secular disciplines among Tibetans. The study of Sanskrit grammars and prosody was also practiced in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, even when the Pali language focused Theravada school rose to prominence in those regions.

=== Linguistic literature ===
By the time of the Sūtra period, the Sanskrit language had evolved sufficiently to make increasing parts of the older literature hard to understand, and to recite correctly. This led to the emergence of several classes of works intended to resolve this matter. These works were styled like the religious Sūtras, however they were not religious per se but focused on the linguistic study of the Sanskrit language. The main topics discussed in these works were grammar (&quot;vyākaraṇa&quot;), phonetics (&quot;śikṣā&quot;) and etymology (&quot;nirukta&quot;). These are traditionally part of the vedāṅga (&quot;limbs of the Veda&quot;), six auxiliary disciplines that developed along with the study of the Vedas.

One of the earliest and most important of these works is the Vedic era &quot;Prātiśākhya Sūtras&quot;, which deal with accentuation, pronunciation, prosody and related matters in order to study the phonetic changes that have taken place in Vedic words.

==== The Sanskrit grammatical tradition ====
The early grammatical works of the linguist Yāska (some time between 7th and 4th century BCE), such as his &quot;Nirukta,&quot; provides the foundation of the study of Sanskrit grammar and etymology.

The most influential work for the Indian Sanskrit grammatical tradition is the &quot;Aṣṭādhyāyī&quot; of Pāṇini, a book of succinct Sūtras that meticulously define the language and grammar of Sanskrit and lay the foundations of what is hereafter the normative form of Sanskrit (and thus, defines Classical Sanskrit). After Pāṇini, other influential works in this field were the &quot;Vārttikakāra&quot; of Kātyāyana, the  of the grammarian Patañjali and Bhartṛhari&#x27;s &quot;Vākyapadīya&quot; (a work on grammar and philosophy of language).

Over time, different grammatical schools developed. There was a tradition of Jain grammarians and Buddhist grammarians and a later tradition of Paninian grammarians.

==== Lexicography ====
There were numerous lexicographical works written in Sanskrit, including numerous dictionaries attributed to figures like Bana, Mayura, Murari, and Sriharsha. According to Keith, &quot;of lexica two main classes exist—synonymous, in which words are grouped by subject-matter, and homonymous (anekartha, nanartha), but the important synonymous dictionaries usually include a homonymous section.&quot;

One of the earliest lexicons (&quot;kośaḥ&quot;) is Amarasiṃha&#x27;s &quot;Nāmalingānusāsana&quot;, better known as the &quot;Amarākośa&quot;. According to Keith, Amarasiṃha, who possibly flourished in the 6th century, was &quot;certainly a Buddhist who knew the Mahāyāna and used Kālidāsa.&quot; Other lexica are later works, including the short &quot;Abhidhānaratnamālā&quot; of the poet-grammarian Halāyudha (c. 950), Yādavaprakāsha&#x27;s &quot;Vaijayantī&quot;, Hemacandra&#x27;s &quot;Abhidhānacintāmaṇi&quot; and &quot;Anekarthasabdakosha&quot; of Medinikara (14th century).

=== Dharma literature ===
The Vedic practice of sūtras pertaining to the correct performance of ritual was extended to other matters such as the performance of duties of all kinds, and in social, moral and legal spheres. These works came to be known as &quot;Dharmasūtra&quot;s and &quot;Dharmaśāstras&quot; in contradistinction to the older &quot;gṛhyasūtras&quot; and &quot;śrautasūtras&quot; although no distinction was felt initially. Like other sūtras, this was terse prose peppered with a few ślokas or verses in &quot;triṣtubh&quot; metre to emphasize a doctrine here and there. More broadly, works in the field of civil and religious law come under the banner of &quot;dharmaśāstra&quot;.

Examples of such works are:

* &quot;Gautamīya dharmaśāstra&quot;
* &quot;Hāritā dharmaśāstra&quot;
* &quot;Vasiṣṭha dharmaśāstra&quot;
* &quot;Baudhāyana dharmaśāstra&quot;
* &quot;Āpastambīya dharmasūtra&quot;
* &quot;Vaiṣṇava dharmaśāstra&quot;
* &quot;Vaikhānasa dharmaśāstra&quot;
The most important of all dharma literature however is the &quot;Manusmṛiti&quot;, which was composed in verse form, and was intended to apply to all human beings of all castes. The &quot;Manusmṛiti&quot; deals with a wide variety of topics including marriage, daily duties, funeral rites, occupation and general rules of life, lawful and forbidden food, impurity and purification, laws on women, duties of husband and wife, inheritance and partition, and much more. There are chapters devoted to the castes, the conduct of different castes, their occupations, the matter of caste admixture, enumerating in full detail the system of social stratification. The Manu·smṛti has been dated to the couple of centuries around the turn of the Common Era. According to recent genetic research, it has been determined that it was around the first century CE that population mixture among different groups in India, prevalent on a large scale from around 2200 BCE, ground to a halt with endogamy setting in.

=== Other secular literature ===

Sanskrit literature also covers a variety of other technical and secular topics including:

* The &quot;Bārhaspatya sūtras&quot;, a work of the materialistic Charvaka school of Indian philosophy.
* Astrological and Astronomical literature (Jyotisha), including the &quot;Jyotiṣavedāṅga,&quot; the &quot;Āryabhaṭīya&quot;, the &quot;Sūrya Siddhānta,&quot; and the &quot;Varāhamihira Bṛhatsaṃhitā.&quot; These works also discuss other topics like divination and agriculture.
* Closely associated with jyotisha are Indian Mathematical works such as the &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;
* Alchemical literature (Rasāyana), including the works of Nāgārjuna, such as the &quot;Rasaratanakaram&quot;
* Works on politics, statecraft and other related topics, the most famous of which is the &quot;Arthaśāstram.&quot; Others include the &quot;Nitisara of Kamandaki&quot;, the &quot;Nitivakyamrta&quot; of Somadeva Suri and the &quot;Yuki-ḵalpataru&quot; ascribed to Bhoja.
* Works on archery (dhanurveda) and the science of horses (asvāyurveda).
* The study of jewels (ratnaśāstra).
* Medical Ayurvedic literature, including the great Ayurveda classics such as the &quot;Carakasaṃhitā&quot;, the &quot;Suśrutasaṃhitā&quot; and the works of Vāgbhaṭa&quot;.&quot;
* Kāma Śāstras (works on love, pleasure and sexuality), the most famous of which is the &quot;Kāma-sūtra.&quot; Other works include Kokkaka&#x27;s &quot;Ratirahasya&quot; (13th century) and Kalyanamalla&#x27;s (16th century) &quot;Anangaranga&quot;.
* Indian Architectural literature (&quot;vāstuśāstra&quot;), such as the &quot;Manushyalaya Chandrika&quot; and the &quot;Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra.&quot;
* Literature on arts and crafts (&quot;śilpaśāstra),&quot; such as works on sculpture, music (such as the &quot;Saṅgītaratnākara&quot;), acting and dance (described in the &quot;Nāṭyaśāstra)&quot;, painting (&quot;Vishnudharmottara&quot;), etc.

== Buddhist literature ==

In India, Buddhist texts were often written in classical Sanskrit as well as in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (also known as &quot;Buddhistic Sanskrit&quot; and &quot;Mixed Sanskrit&quot;). While the earliest Buddhist texts were composed and transmitted in Middle Indo-Aryan Prakrits, later Indian Buddhists translated their canonical works into Sanskrit or at least partially Sanskritized their literature.

Beginning in the third century, Buddhist texts also began to be composed in classical Sanskrit. Over time, Sanskrit became the main language of Buddhist scripture and scholasticism for certain Buddhist schools in the subcontinent, especially in North India. This was influenced by the rise of Sanskrit as a political and literary lingua franca, perhaps reflecting an increased need for elite patronage and a desire to compete with Hindu Brahmins. The Buddhist use of classical Sanskrit is first seen in the work of the great poet and dramatist Aśvaghoṣa (c. 100 CE). The Sarvāstivāda school is particularly known for having translated their entire canon into Sanskrit.

Other Indian Buddhist schools, like the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda and Dharmaguptaka schools, also adopted Sanskrit or Sanskritized their scriptures to different degrees. However, other Buddhist traditions, like Theravada, rejected this trend and kept their canon in Middle Indic languages like Pāli.

Sanskrit also became the most important language in Mahayana Buddhism and many Mahāyāna sūtras were transmitted in Sanskrit. Some of the earliest and most important Mahayana sutras are the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras, many of which survive in Sanskrit manuscripts.

Indian Buddhist authors also composed Sanskrit treatises and other works on philosophy, logic-epistemology, jatakas, epic poetry and other topics. While a large number of these works only survive in Tibetan and Chinese translations, many key Buddhist Sanskrit works do survive in manuscript form and are held in numerous modern collections.

Sanskrit was the main scholastic language of the Indian Buddhist philosophers in the Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, Madhyamaka and Yogacara schools. These include well known figures like Kumāralatā, Nāgārjuna, Āryadeva, Asaṅga, Vasubandhu, Yaśomitra, Dignāga, Sthiramati, Dharmakīrti, Bhāviveka, Candrakīrti, Śāntideva and Śāntarakṣita. Some Sanskrit works which were written by Buddhists also cover secular topics, such as grammar (vyākaraṇa), lexicography (koṣa), poetry (kāvya), poetics (alaṁkāra), and medicine (Ayurveda).

The Gupta (c. 4th–6th centuries) and Pāla (c. 8th–12th centuries) eras saw the growth of large Buddhist institutions such as Nālandā and Vikramashila universities, where many fields of knowledge (vidyasthanas) were studied in Sanskrit, including Buddhist philosophy. These universities also drew foreign students from as far away as China. One of the most famous of these was the 7th century Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, who studied Buddhism in Sanskrit at Nalanda and took over 600 Sanskrit manuscripts back to China for his translation project. Chinese pilgrims to India like Yijing described how in these universities, the study of Buddhist philosophy was preceded by extensive study of Sanskrit language and grammar.

During the Indian Tantric Age (8th to the 14th century), numerous Buddhist Tantras and other Buddhist esoteric literature was written in Sanskrit. These tantric texts often contain non-standard Sanskrit, prakritic elements and influences from regional languages like apabhramśa and Old Bengali. These vernacular forms are often in verses (dohas) which may be found within esoteric Sanskrit texts.

== Jain literature ==

The earliest Jain scriptures, the Jain Agamas, were composed and orally transmitted in Prakrit. Later in the history of Jainism (after about the 8th century CE), Jain authors began composing literature in other languages, especially classical Sanskrit while also retaining the use of Jain Prakrit.

The most important Jain Sanskrit work is Umaswati&#x27;s (c. sometime between the 2nd-century and 5th-century CE) &quot;Tattvarthasūtra&quot; (&quot;On the Nature of Reality&quot;). The &quot;Tattvarthasūtra&quot; is considered an authoritative work on Jain philosophy by all traditions of Jainism and thus it is widely studied.

Other influential Jain Sanskrit authors include: Samantabhadra, Pūjyapāda (who wrote the most important commentary to the &quot;Tattvarthasūtra,&quot; entitled &quot;Sarvārthasiddhi)&quot;, Siddhasēna Divākara (c. 650 CE), Akalanka, &lt;dfn&gt;Haribhadra-s&lt;/dfn&gt;ūri (c 8th century) author of the &quot;Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya&quot;, Hemachandra (c. 1088–1172 CE) who wrote the &quot;Yogaśāstra,&quot; and Yaśovijaya (1624–1688) a scholar of Navya-Nyāya.

== Kāvya ==
There is a large corpus of classical Sanskrit poetry from India in a variety of genres and forms. According to Siegfried Lienhard in India, the term &quot;Kāvya&quot; refers to individual poems, as well as &quot;poetry itself, i.e., all those works that conform to artistic and literary norms.&quot; Indian poetry includes epic and lyrical elements. It may be entirely in prose (gadya), entirely in verse (padya) or in a mixed form (misra). Kāvya works are full of alliteration, similes, metaphors and other figures of speech.

Indians divided poetry into two main categories: poetry that can be seen (drsya, preksya, i.e. drama/theater) and poetry that can only be listened to (sravya).

Metrical Indian poetry can also be divided into two other categories:

* &quot;Mahākāvya&quot; (&quot;Major Poetry&quot;), also known as &quot;sargabandha,&quot; which are large poems divided into sections or cantos (sargas)
* &quot;Laghukāvya (Minor Poetry)&quot;, shorter poems or single stanzas
According to Lienhard &quot;whereas metrical poetry led a flourishing existence both as mahakavya and laghukavya, prose poems (gadya) and literature in mixed prose and verse (campu) tended to assume the major form. The only exceptions are the panegyric inscriptions (prasasti) and religious epistles (lekha) commonly found in Buddhist societies which may both be composed in the kavya style. Both are written either all in prose or in a mixture of alternately prose and verse and must therefore be counted as belonging to the minor form representing prose kavya or campu - a point that Indian theorists seem to have neglected.&quot;

Kāvya was employed by court poets in a movement that flourished between c. 200 BCE and 1100 CE. While the Gupta era is considered by many to have seen the highest point of Indian Kāvya, many poems were composed before this period as well as after. Sanskrit Kāvya also influenced the literature of Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and the Malay Archipelago. The study of Sanskrit Kāvya also influenced Tibetan literature, and was promoted by Tibetan Buddhist scholars like Sakya Pandita.

Sanskrit Kāvya poetry also flourished outside the courts, in towns, learned schools and the homes of pandits and other elites and continues to be composed and studied today. Kāvya was often recited in public gatherings, court receptions and in societies which gathered specifically for the study and enjoyment of poetry. Kavis (Kāvya poets) also competed with each other for rewards and for the support of elites and kings (who often appointed court poets). Kavis were highly educated and many of them would have been pandits with knowledge of other sciences such as grammar, lexicography and other fields. Indian authors held that an important quality of these poets was said to be &quot;pratibhā&quot;, poetic imagination.

The beginnings of Kāvya is obscure. Lienhard traces its beginnings to &quot;the close of the Late Vedic Period (about 550 B.C.)...as this was a time that saw the slow emergence of poetic forms with characteristics of their own, quite different both functionally and structurally from previous models.&quot; The earliest Kāvya poems were short stanzas in the minor form &quot;(laghukāvya),&quot; sometimes just being one stanza poems (muktakas)&quot;.&quot; Few of these early works have survived&quot;.&quot;

=== Laghukāvya ===
&quot;Laghukāvya&quot; mainly refers to short poems, which can be single stanza (muktaka), double stanza poems (yugmaka), and several-stanza poems (kulakas). Short poetry was also termed &quot;khandakavya&quot; and a collection of stanzas or anthology was called a &quot;kosa&quot;. The earliest &quot;laghukāvyas&quot; were in prakrits, but some also began to be written in Sanskrit in time.

The earliest &quot;laghukāvyas&quot; where muktakas (also sometimes called gāthā), single stanzas. These were most commonly lyrical nature poems, lyrical love poems, religious poems or reflective didactic poems. According to Lienhard &quot;muktaka poetry generally paints miniature pictures and scenes, or else it carefully builds up a description of a single theme.&quot;

Some of the earliest of these early poems are found in the Buddhist canon, which contain two the verse anthologies: the &quot;Theragāthā&quot; (&quot;Verses of the Elder Monks&quot;) and &quot;Therīgāthā (Verses of the Elder Nuns).&quot; Only the Pali versions of these survive, but they also existed in Prakrit and Sanskrit.

There are also some surviving stanzas which are attributed to important figures like the grammarian Panini, the scholar Patañjali, and Vararuci, but these attributions are uncertain.

Some important Sanskrit poets whose collections of short poems have survived include Bhartṛhari (fl. c. 5th century CE), known for his &quot;Śatakatraya,&quot; Amaru (7th century), author of the &quot;Amaruśataka&quot; (which mainly contains erotic poetry) and Govardhana (12th century), author of the &quot;Āryāsaptaśatī&quot;.

There are numerous anthologies which collect short Sanskrit poetry from different authors, these works are our main source of short Sanskrit poems. One widely celebrated anthology is the &quot;Subhāṣitaratnakoṣa&quot; (&quot;Anthology of Well Said Jewels&quot;) of the Buddhist monk and anthologist Vidyakara (c. 1050–1130). Other important anthologies include: Jalhana&#x27;s &quot;Subhāṣitamuktāvalī&quot; (13th century), Sridharadasa&#x27;s &quot;Saduktikarṇāmṛta&quot; (1205), Śārṅgadharapaddhati (1363) and Vallabhadeva&#x27;s &quot;Subhāṣitāvalī&quot; (&quot;Chain of Beautiful Sayings&quot;, c. 16th century).

=== Samghatas and Khandakavyas ===
In between muktaka and mahākāvya there are medium length Sanskrit poems which are linked stanzas (between eight and one hundred stanzas) using one Sanskrit metre and one theme (such as the six Indian seasons, love and eros, and nature). They are variously called &quot;series of stanzas&quot; (samghata) or khandakavya.

Examples of these medium length poems include: the &quot;Ṛtusaṃhāra,&quot; the &quot;Ghatakarpara Kavyam,&quot; and the &quot;Meghadūta&quot; of Kālidāsa (the most famous of all Sanskrit poets) which popularized the sandeśa kāvya (messenger poem), Jambukavi&#x27;s &quot;Candraduta&quot; (8th to 10th century), Jinasena&#x27;s &quot;Parsvabhyudaya&quot; (a Jain work), Vedanta Desika&#x27;s &quot;Hansasandeśa&quot;, the &quot;Kokila Sandeśa&quot;, and Rūpa Gosvāmin&#x27;s &quot;Haṃsadūta&quot; (16th century). Another genre of medium length poems were panegyrics like the &quot;Rājendrakarṇapūra&quot; of Sambhu.

Religious medium length &quot;kāvya&quot; style poems (often called stotras or stutis) were also very popular and they show some similarities with panegyrics. According to Lienhard, some of the figures which are most widely written about in medium length religious poems include: &quot;Gautama Buddha, Durga-Kali (or Devi), Ganesa, Krsna (Govinda), Laksmi, Nrsimha, Radha, Rama, Sarasvati, Siva, Surya, the Tathagatas, the Tirthamkaras or Jinas, Vardhamana Mahavira and Visnu.&quot; Only some of the Sanskrit hymns to the gods can be considered literary &quot;kāvya&quot;, since they are truly artistic and follow some of the classic kāvya rules.

According to Lienhard, the literary hymns of the Buddhists are the oldest of these. Aśvaghoṣa is said to have written some, but they are all lost. Two Buddhist hymns of the poet Mātṛceṭa* (c. 70 to 150 CE), the &quot;Varṇārhavarṇa Stotra&quot; or &quot;Catuḥśataka&quot; and the &quot;Satapancasataka&quot; or &quot;Prasadapratibha ((Stotra) on the Splendour of Graciousness (of the Buddha))&quot; have survived in Sanskrit. They are some the finest Buddhist stotras and were very popular in the Buddhist community in India. There are also some Buddhist stotras attributed to other Buddhist masters like Nagarjuna (2nd-3rd century CE), Chandragomin (5th century) and Dignāga as well as two Buddhist stotras by King Harshavadana. Some important later Buddhist stotras are &quot;Sragdharastotra&quot; (about 700) by Sarvajñamitra, Vajradatta&#x27;s &quot;Lokesvara-sataka&quot; (9th century), the tantric &quot;Mañjuśrīnāma-saṃgīti&quot; and Ramacandra Kavibharati&#x27;s 15th century &quot;Bhaktisataka&quot; (which is influenced by the Bhakti movement).

There are also many Sanskrit Jaina stotras, most of which are dedicated to the Jain Tirthankaras. They include the &quot;Bhaktacamarastotra&quot; by Manatunga (7th century), Nandisena&#x27;s &quot;Ajitasantistava,&quot; the &quot;Mahavirastava&quot; by Abhayadeva (mid 11th century) and the stotras of Ramacandra (12th century).

There are numerous literary Hindu hymns which were written after the time of Kālidāsa. Some of the most important ones are Bāṇabhaṭṭa&#x27;s &quot;Caṇḍīśataka,&quot; the &quot;Suryasataka&quot; by Mayurbhatta, numerous hymns attributed to Adi Shankara (though the majority of these were likely not composed by him), the &quot;Mahimnastava&quot;, the Shaiva &quot;Pañcāśati&quot; (14th century), Abhinavagupta&#x27;s Shaiva stotras&quot;,&quot; the southern &quot;Mukundamala&quot; and &quot;Narayaniyam,&quot; the &quot;Krishnakarṇāmrutam&quot;, and the poems of Nilakantha Diksita, Jagannātha Paṇḍitarāja, Gangadevi, Ramanuja, Jayadeva, Rupa Goswami, and Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa (17th century).

=== Mahākāvya ===
According to Lienhard, the most important feature of &quot;mahākāvya&quot; (Long poems) is that they are divided into chapters or cantos (sargas). Fully versified &quot;Mahākāvyas&quot; (called sargabandhas) are written in many different metres. &quot;Mahākāvyas&quot; may also be written fully in prose or in a mixture of verse and prose (mostly called campu). Sargabandhas commonly center around a hero and also include villains. They almost never end in a tragic manner. Indian epic poetry like the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; forms an important influence on Sanskrit &quot;mahakāvya&quot; literature.

The oldest extant &quot;mahākāvyas&quot; are those of the Buddhist poet and philosopher Aśvaghoṣa (c. 80 – c. 150 CE). His &quot;Buddhacarita&quot; (&quot;Acts of the Buddha&quot;) was influential enough to be translated into both Tibetan and Chinese. The Chinese pilgrim Yijing (635–713 CE) writes that the &quot;Buddhacarita&quot; was &quot;...extensively read in all the five parts of India and in the countries of the South Sea (Sumātra, Jāva and the neighbouring islands)...it was regarded as a virtue to read it in as much as it contained the noble doctrine in a neat compact form.&quot; Another &quot;mahākāvya&quot; by Aśvaghoṣa is the &quot;Saundarananda&quot;, which focuses on the conversion of Nanda, Buddha&#x27;s half-brother.

==== The great mahākāvyas ====
Kālidāsa, called by many the Shakespeare of India, is said to have been the finest master of the Sanskrit poetic style. Arthur Macdonell describes this great poets&#x27; words as having a &quot;firmness and evenness of sound, avoiding harsh transitions and preferring gentle harmonies; the use of words in their ordinary sense and clearness of meaning; the power to convey sentiment; beauty, elevation, and the employment of metaphorical expressions&quot;. Kālidāsa&#x27;s greatest Kāvyas are the &quot;Raghuvaṃśa&quot; and the &quot;Kumārasambhava.&quot;

This &quot;Raghuvaṃśa&quot; (&quot;The Genealogy of Raghu&quot;) chronicles the life of Rāma alongside his forefathers and successors in 19 cantos, with the story of Rāma agreeing quite closely that in the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;. The narrative moves at a rapid pace, is packed with apt and striking similes and has much genuine poetry, while the style is simpler than what is typical of a mahakāvya. The &quot;Raghuvaṃśa&quot; is seen to meet all the criteria of a &quot;mahākāvya&quot;, such as that the central figure should be noble and clever, and triumphant, that the work should abound in &quot;rasa&quot; and &quot;bhāva&quot;, and so on. There are more than 20 commentaries of this work that are known. The &quot;Kumārasambhava&quot; (&quot;The Birth of Kumāra&quot;) narrates the story of the courtship and wedding of Śiva and Pārvatī, and the birth of their son, Kumāra. The poem finishes with the slaying of the demon Tāraka, the very purpose of the birth of the warrior-god. The &quot;Kumārasambhava&quot; showcases the poet&#x27;s rich and original imaginative powers making for abundant poetic imagery and wealth of illustration. Again, more than 20 commentaries on the Kumāra·sambhava have survived.

These two great poems are grouped by Indian tradition along with four more works into &quot;the six great mahākāvyas&quot;. The other four greats are: Bhāravi&#x27;s (6th century CE) &quot;Kirātārjunīya&quot;, Māgha&#x27;s (c. 7th Century CE) &quot;Śiśupālavadha&quot;, the &quot;Bhaṭṭikāvya&quot; (also known as &quot;Rāvaṇavadha&quot;) and Śrīharṣa&#x27;s (12th century CE) &quot;Naiṣadhīyacarita,&quot; which is the most extensive and difficult of the great mahākāvyas (and contains many references to Indian philosophy)&quot;.&quot; Over time, various commentaries where also composed on these poems, especially the &quot;Naiṣadhīyacarita.&quot;

==== Later mahākāvyas ====
Between Kālidāsa&#x27;s time and the 18th century, numerous other sargabandhas were composed in the classic style, such as Mentha&#x27;s &quot;Hayagrīvavadha&quot; (6th century), King Pravarasena II&#x27;s &quot;Setubandha,&quot; the Sinhalese poet Kumaradasa&#x27;s &quot;Janakiharana,&quot; Rājānaka Ratnākara&#x27;s &quot;Haravijaya,&quot; the &quot;Nalodaya,&quot; the Buddhist Sivasvamin&#x27;s &quot;Kapphinabhyudaya&quot; (9th century), and Buddhaghosa&#x27;s &quot;Padyacudamani&quot; (a life of the Buddha, c. 9th century). Later sargabandhas tended to be more heavily loaded with technical complexity, erudition and extensive decoration. Authors of these later works include the 12th century Kashmiri Shaivas Kaviraja Rajanaka Mankha and Jayaratha, Jayadeva, author of the innovative and widely imitated &quot;Gitagovinda,&quot; Lolimbaraja&#x27;s &quot;Harivilasa&quot; (mid 16th century), the Shaivite &quot;Bhiksatana(kavya)&quot; of Gokula, Krsnananda&#x27;s 13th century &quot;Sahrdayananda,&quot; and the numerous works of &quot;Ramapanivada.&quot;

After the 8th century, many sophisticated Jain mahākāvyas were written by numerous Jain poets (mainly from Gujarat), including Jatasimhanandi&#x27;s &quot;Varangacarita&quot; (7th century), Kanakasena Vadiraja Suri&#x27;s &quot;Yasodharacarita&quot;, and the &quot;Ksatracudamani&quot; by Vadibhasimha Odayadeva. Jain authors also wrote their own versions of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; with Jain themes, such as the &quot;Padmapurana&quot; of Ravisena (678 A.D.).

Other later mahākāvyas are poems based on historical figures which embellish history with classic poetic themes such as Parimala&#x27;s &quot;Navasāhasāṅkacarita,&quot; Bilhana&#x27;s &quot;Vikramāṅkadevacarita&quot; (11th century) and &quot;Madhurāvijayam&quot; (&quot;The Conquest of Madurai&quot;, c. 14th-century) by Gangadevi, which chronicles the life a prince of the Vijayanagara Empire and his invasion and conquest of the Madurai Sultanate. Rashtraudha Kavya by Rudrakavi chronicles the history of Maratha Bagul kings of Baglana and Khandesh and details their role and position in military history involving important figures such as the Bahmanis, Mahmud Begada, Humayun, Akbar, Murad Shah,etc.

Some later poems focused on specific poetic devices, some of the most popular being paronomasia ( slesa) and ambiguous rhyme (yamaka). For example, the poems of Vasudeva (10th century), such as &quot;Yudhiṣṭhira-vijaya&quot; and &quot;Nalodaya&quot;, were all yamaka poems while the &quot;Ramapalacarita&quot; of Sandhyakara Nandin is a slesakavya.

One final genre is the Śāstrakāvya, a kāvya which also contains some didactic content which instructs on some ancient science or knowledge. Examples include Halayudha&#x27;s &quot;Kavirahasya&quot; (a handbook for poets), Bhatta Bhima&#x27;s &quot;Arjunaravaniya&quot; (which teaches grammar) and Hemacandra&#x27;s &quot;Kumarapalacarita&quot; (grammar).

==== Prose mahākāvya ====
While most early mahākāvyas were all in verse, the term mahākāvya could also be applied to any long prose poem and these became more popular after the 7th century, when the great masters of prose (gadya) lived. These are Daṇḍin (author of the &quot;Daśakumāracarita&quot;) Subandhu (author of the &quot;Vāsavadattā&quot;) and Bāṇabhaṭṭa (author of &quot;Kādambari&quot; and &quot;Harshacarita&quot;). Prose mahākāvyas replaced virtuosity in metre with highly complex and artistic sentences. Other important writers of Sanskrit prose poems include Bhūṣaṇa bhaṭṭa, Dhanapala (the Jain author of the &quot;Tilakamañjari&quot;), and Vadibhasimha Odayadeva (author of the &quot;Gadyacintāmaṇi&quot;).

=== Campū ===
Campū (also known as &quot;gadyapadyamayi&quot;) is a poetic genre which contains both verse and prose. This genre was rare during the first millennium CE, but later grew in popularity, especially in South India. The earliest Sanskrit example of this genre is Trivikramabhatta&#x27;s &quot;Nalacampu&quot; (or &quot;Damayanticampu&quot;, c. 10th century). While many other Sanskrit works also contain a mixture of verse and prose, like Āryaśūra&#x27;s &quot;Jātakamālā&quot;, Lienhard notes that these are not true campūs. This is because &quot;in true campū there is a calculated balance between prose that is as perfect as possible and stanzas in the genuine kavya style.&quot;

Some important campūs include Somaprabha Suri&#x27;s &quot;Yaśastilakacampū&quot; (9th century, Jain), Haricandra&#x27;s &quot;Jivandharacampū&quot; (Jain), the &quot;Ramayanacampū,&quot; Divakara&#x27;s &quot;Amogharaghavacampu,&quot; the 17th century female poet Tirumalamba&#x27;s &quot;Varadambikaparinaya,&quot; Venkatadhvarin&#x27;s &quot;Visvagunadarsacampu,&quot; Jiva Gosvamin&#x27;s voluminous &quot;Gopalacampu,&quot; Raghunathadasa&#x27;s &quot;Muktacaritra&quot;, and the 18th century Maithili poet Krishnadutta&#x27;s &quot;Shri Janraj Champu&quot;.

=== Works on prosody and poetics ===
There are also numerous Sanskrit works which discuss prosody and poetics. The earliest work which discusses poetics is Bharatamuni&#x27;s &quot;Nāṭyaśāstra&quot; (200 B.C. to 200 A.D.), a work which mainly deals with drama. Piṅgalá (fl. 300–200 BCE) authored the &quot;Chandaḥśāstra&quot;, an early Sanskrit treatise on prosody.

Gaurinath Bhattacharyya Shastri lists four main school of Indian poetics and their main figures:

* The Alaṅkāra school which draws on Bhāmaha&#x27;s (c. 7th century) &quot;Kāvyālaṅkāra,&quot; Udbhaṭa&#x27;s &quot;Alankarasamgraha&quot; and Rudrata&#x27;s &quot;Kāvyālaṅkāra.&quot;
* The Riti school - Daṇḍin&#x27;s (fl. 7th–8th century) &quot;Kāvyādarśa&quot; is influenced by the Alaṅkāra school and introduces the concept of &quot;guna&quot;. The &quot;Kāvyādarśa&quot; was very influential for Vāmana, the 8th century founder of the Riti school and author of the &quot;Kāvyālaṅkāra Sūtra.&quot;
* The Rasa school draws on the &quot;Nāṭyaśāstra&#x27;s&quot; aphorism on rasa (emotional flavor). The key figure of this school is Bhaṭṭanāyaka, author of the &quot;Hṛdayadarpaṇa.&quot;
* The Dhvani school which makes use of Anandavardhana&#x27;s (c. 820–890 CE) &quot;Dhvanyāloka&quot; and the commentary of Abhinavagupta (who also wrote the &quot;Abhinavabharati&quot;, a commentary on the &quot;Nāṭyaśāstra&quot;). This school emphasizes &quot;aesthetic suggestion&quot; (&quot;dhvani&quot;).

Later influential works on poetics include Mammaṭa&#x27;s (11th century) &quot;Kāvyaprakāśa,&quot; the writings on poetics by Kshemendra, Hemacandra&#x27;s &quot;Kavyanusasana&quot;, Vagbhata&#x27;s &quot;Vagbhatalankara&quot;, and Rupa Gosvamin&#x27;s &quot;Ujjvalanilamani&quot;.

== Subhāṣita ==

Outside of kāvya literature are also numerous poetic works, called subhāṣita, (&quot;well said&quot;) which can be classified as gnomic poetry and didactic poetry. These are mainly poems which contain some wise saying, aphoristic lesson (often ethical), popular maxim or a proverb (lokavakya). These are thousands of Subhāṣitas on many themes. The &quot;Dharmapada&quot; is one important early collection of aphorisms.

There are also many didactic works attributed to Cāṇakya (but actually written by numerous authors), such as the &quot;Rājanītisamuccaya, Cāṇakyanīti, Cāṇakyarājanīti, Vṛddha-Cāṇakya&quot;, and the &quot;Laghu-Cāṇakya&quot;. Another important collection of gnomic sayings is the &quot;Nisataka&quot; of Bhartrhari.

Later examples of this genre include the Jain Amitagati&#x27;s &quot;Subhasitaratnasaridoha&quot;, Kṣemendra&#x27;s &quot;Cārucaryā, Darpadalana&quot; and &quot;Samayamatrka,&quot; Kusumadeva&#x27;s &quot;Dṛṣṭāntaśataka&quot;, Dya Dviveda&#x27;s &quot;Nitimañjari&quot; (1494), and Vallabhadeva&#x27;s &quot;Subhāṣitāvalī&quot; (15th century). There are also numerous anthologies of subhāṣita, such as the &quot;Cātakāṣṭaka&quot;.

== Sanskrit drama ==
Indian classical drama (&quot;dṛśya&quot;, &quot;nātaka&quot;) was also mainly written in Sanskrit and there are many examples of this Sanskrit literary genre. Bharata&#x27;s &quot;Nāṭyaśāstra&quot; (3rd century CE) is the earliest work which discusses Sanskrit dramaturgy. Sanskrit drama focuses on the sentiments and on heroic characters. Classically, the endings are happy, never tragic. References to Sanskrit drama are found throughout ancient Sanskrit texts, including the great epics.

Some of the earliest Sanskrit dramas are those of Aśvaghoṣa (only a fragment of his &quot;Śāriputraprakaraṇa&quot; survives) and the many plays of Bhāsa (c.1st century BCE), most of which are based on the two great epics (&quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Ramayana&quot;). Kalidasa is widely considered to be the greatest Sanskrit playwright, hailed for his linguistic mastery and economy of style. He wrote three plays: &quot;Vikramōrvaśīyam, Mālavikāgnimitram, Abhijñānaśākuntalam.&quot;

Other important plays include the &quot;Mṛcchakaṭika&quot; (&quot;The Little Clay Cart&quot;, 5th century) and the &quot;Mudrārākṣasa.&quot;

Harṣa, a 7th-century Indian emperor, was also known as a great playwright with a simple and delicate style. His &quot;Ratnavali, Nagananda,&quot; and &quot;Priyadarsika&quot; are well known Sanskrit dramas.

The &quot;Mattavilāsaprahasana&quot; (&quot;A Farce of Drunken Sport&quot;) is a short one-act Sanskrit play. It is one of the two great one act plays written by Pallava King Mahendravarman I (571– 630CE) in the beginning of the seventh century in Tamil Nadu.

Bhavabhuti (8th century) is one of the great playwrights after Kalidasa. Other major Sanskrit playwrights include Visakhadatta, Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa, Murari, Rajasekhara, Kshemisvara, Damodaramishra, and Krishnamishra.

Later Sanskrit dramaturgical texts also continued to be written in the second millennium, such as the &quot;Shilparatna&quot; which discusses dance and drama.

== Other Sanskrit narratives ==
There are various classical Sanskrit collections of fables one of the most influential of which is the early &quot;Pañcatantra,&quot; a work that was widely imitated&quot;.&quot; Other works include the &quot;Hitopadeśa&quot; and Srivara&#x27;s &quot;Kathakautuka.&quot; Buddhist Jatakas (tales of the Buddha&#x27;s past lives) is a similar genre and includes the &quot;Divyāvadāna&quot;, Āryaśūra&#x27;s &quot;Jātakamālā&quot; (a collection of Buddhist fables)&quot;,&quot; and Ksemendra&#x27;s various works like the &quot;Avadānakalpalatā.&quot;

Folk tale (or fairy tale) collections include the &quot;Vetala Pañcaviṃśati,&quot; &quot;Siṃhāsana Dvātriṃśikā&quot;, and the &quot;Suktasaptati&quot;. There is also Somadeva&#x27;s &quot;Kathāsaritsāgara&quot; (&quot;Ocean of the Streams of Stories&quot;).

There are also poetic historical chronicles like the &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; of Kalhana, Rashtraudha Kavya of Rudrakavi, Shivbharata and Paramanandkavya of Paramananda, Rajaramcharitra of Keshavbhatt, Sri Janraj Champu of Krishna Dutta.

Hemacandra&#x27;s (1088-1172) &quot;Trisastisalakapurusacaritra&quot; is one example of Jain didactic narrative in Sanskrit.

There are also abridged retellings of more ancient lost texts, such as Budhasvāmin&#x27;s &quot;Bṛhatkathāślokasaṃgraha&quot;.

== Modern Sanskrit literature ==
Literature in Sanskrit continues to be produced. These works, however, have a very small readership. In the introduction to &quot;Ṣoḍaśī: An Anthology of Contemporary Sanskrit Poets&quot; (1992), Radhavallabh Tripathi writes:

Most current Sanskrit poets are employed as teachers, either pandits in &quot;pāṭhaśāla&quot;s or university professors. However, Tripathi also points out the abundance of contemporary Sanskrit literature:

Similarly, , in &quot;Post-Independence Sanskrit Literature: A Critical Survey&quot;, estimates that more than 3000 Sanskrit works were composed in the period after Indian Independence (i.e., since 1947) alone. Further, much of this work is judged as being of high quality, both in comparison to classical Sanskrit literature, and to modern literature in other Indian languages.

Since 1967, the Sahitya Akademi, India&#x27;s national academy of letters, has had an award for the best creative work written that year in Sanskrit. In 2009, Satyavrat Shastri became the first Sanskrit author to win the Jnanpith Award, India&#x27;s highest literary award.
Vidyadhar Shastri wrote two epic poems (&quot;Mahakavya&quot;), seven shorter poems, three plays and three songs of praise (, he received the &quot;Vidyavachaspati&quot; award in 1962. Some other modern Sanskrit composers include Abhiraj Rajendra Mishra (known as &quot;Triveṇī Kavi&quot;, composer of short stories and several other genres of Sanskrit literature), Jagadguru Rambhadracharya (known as &quot;Kavikularatna&quot;, composer of two epics, several minor works and commentaries on &quot;Prasthānatrayī&quot;).

Another great Sanskrit epic that remained largely unrecognised till lately is &quot;Dhruv Charitra&quot; written by Pandit Surya Dev Mishra in 1946. He won laurels of appreciation by renowned Hindi and Sanskrit critics like Hazari Prasad Dwiedi, Ayodhya Singh Upadhyay &quot;Hariaudh&quot;, Suryakant tripathi &quot;Nirala&quot;, Laldhar Tripathi &quot;Pravasi&quot;.

<text>Ulver (Norwegian for &quot;wolves&quot;) is a Norwegian experimental electronica band founded in 1993, by vocalist Kristoffer Rygg. Their early works, such as debut album &quot;Bergtatt&quot;, were categorised as folklore-influenced black metal, but the band has since evolved a fluid and increasingly eclectic musical style, blending genres such as experimental rock, electronica, ambient, trip hop, symphonic and chamber traditions, noise, progressive and experimental music into their oeuvre. 1997 marked their international debut with the release of their third album &quot;Nattens madrigal&quot; through German label Century Media. However, following discord with the label, Rygg formed his own imprint, Jester Records, in 1998.

In 1997, Rygg invited composer and multi-instrumentalist Tore Ylwizaker into the band, and together they changed Ulver&#x27;s musical direction. Their first musical endeavour together, &quot;Themes from William Blake&#x27;s The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;, drew from a variety of non-metal sources, including classical and avant-garde, and the works of William Blake. &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; (1999) and &quot;Perdition City&quot; (2000) followed, showcasing further experimentation and explorations into electronic music. In 2000, author Jørn H. Sværen joined the band, and since then, the core of Ulver has been Rygg, Ylwizaker and Sværen. In 2009, Ulver expanded their line-up: British multi-instrumentalist Daniel O&#x27;Sullivan became the fourth core member, and several other musicians were enlisted as supporting and live members; of the latter, Norwegian musician and producer Ole Alexander Halstensgård has since established himself as another prominent member of the band.

Ulver has performed at several prestigious venues, including Queen Elizabeth Hall (2009), the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet (2010), Teatro Regio di Parma (2013), Labirinto della Masone di Franco Maria Ricci (2017) and held artist residency at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter (2018).

The band have sold in excess of half a million records, been three nominated for the Norwegian Grammy Awards, Spellemannsprisen, in different categories, won &quot;Album of the Year&quot; at the Oslo Awards for &quot;Shadows of the Sun&quot; in 2008, won the NATT&amp;DAG award for &quot;Best Live Act&quot; in 2011, and earned a global reputation for stylistic unpredictability.

Author and musician Julian Cope has said, &quot;Ulver are cataloguing the death of our culture two decades before anyone else has noticed its inevitable demise.&quot;

==History==

===The Black Metal Trilogie (1993–1997)===
The band was founded in 1993 in Oslo by vocalist Kristoffer Rygg together with Grellmund, Robin Malmberg, Carl-Michael Eide, Håvard Jørgensen, and A. Reza. Ulver issued their first demo cassette, &quot;Vargnatt&quot;, in November 1993. Their music and style was consistent with the Norwegian black metal subculture of the early 1990s. However some have noted the avant-garde, jazz, rock and gothic influences that would later shape the band&#x27;s sound. The archaic Dano-Norwegian lyrics were greatly influenced by Scandinavian folktales and inspired by Baroque poets such as Ludvig Holberg and the hymn-writer Thomas Kingo.

Their debut album, &quot;Bergtatt&quot;, the first part of what has become known as Ulver&#x27;s &quot;Black Metal Trilogie&quot;, was issued in February 1995 through Norwegian label Head Not Found. The album was met with critical acclaim, and was notable for blending black metal, harsh vocals and blurred, buzzing guitars with quiet, folk-like acoustic passages. It was praised for its unique atmosphere and was described as &quot;mysterious, melancholic, eerie, and oddly tranquil.&quot;

Prior to their second album, founding member Grellmund committed suicide on New Year’s Day 1996 at the age of 19. &quot;Kveldssanger&quot;, issued March 1996 by Head Not Found, Ulver eschewed a typical black metal sound by incorporating classical guitars, cello and choral chamber chants overlaid with subtle orchestral landscapes. The album was a drastic contrast to &quot;Bergtatt&quot;, whilst still retaining the atmospheric and folk themes. Rygg has since remarked that &quot;Kveldssanger&quot;, despite strong content, was an &quot;immature attempt at making a classical album&quot;. The album was praised for its atmosphere, evoking a feeling of quiet, eerie solitude.

Following the success of their first two albums, Ulver signed with German label Century Media for their third album &quot;Nattens madrigal&quot;, issued in March 1997, marking the band&#x27;s international debut. The album showcases a black metal style similar to &quot;Bergtatt&quot;, abandoning the acoustic and atmospheric elements of &quot;Kveldssanger&quot;, with an intentionally underproduced sound. The album has been described as &quot;raw and grim black metal at its blackest.&quot; A common myth about the album is that the band spent the recording budget on Armani suits, cocaine and a Corvette; and recorded the album outdoors in a Norwegian forest on an 8-track recorder. Rygg, however, has stated that this is not true, and possibly a rumour started by Century Media. The album has been described as &quot;so fast and ferocious and the vocals so garbled that it&#x27;s best just to take the sheer sonic force as reflecting the band&#x27;s concept, rather than trying to piece it all together.&quot;

&quot;Metal Injection&quot; concluded &quot;&quot;Kveldssanger&quot; had no electric instruments, &quot;Nattens madrigal&quot; had no acoustic instruments, but &quot;Bergtatt&quot;, has both acoustic and electric instruments; it&#x27;s like they spliced the elements from &quot;Bergtatt&quot; into two separate albums. If that&#x27;s the case, then &quot;Nattens madrigal&quot; really showcases the black metal prowess of the band. The album answers exactly why people were so angered by Ulver&#x27;s transition away from black metal, and why people are still bitter at their direction today.&quot;

In 1997, Century Media issued &quot;The Trilogie – Three Journeyes Through the Norwegian Netherworlde&quot;, a limited edition collection, containing &quot;Bergtatt&quot;, &quot;Kveldssanger&quot; and &quot;Nattens madrigal&quot; in LP Picture Disc format, housed in a cardboard box, with a booklet and bonus posters.

===Beyond black metal (1998–2002)===
In 1997, Rygg invited composer and sound architect Tore Ylwizaker into the collective in order to expand their artistic and musical visions; and together they stepped over the boundaries of black metal aesthetics, creating a genre-defying work in &quot;Themes from William Blake&#x27;s The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;, released in December 1998. The album was issued through Rygg&#x27;s own imprint, Jester Records, a label born out of discord between Ulver and Century Media. Musically, the album blended electronics, industrial music elements, progressive metal and experimental rock, adding ambient passages. Lyrically, the album incorporates the entire text of William Blake&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;, utilising guest vocalists on several songs. The album received widespread acclaim from critics within both the rock/metal and alternative music press - being awarded &quot;album of the month&quot; in several high-profile magazines such as &quot;Terrorizer&quot;, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, and &quot;Rock Hard&quot; and ranked highly in their end of year&#x27;s best polls. However, the album&#x27;s transitional nature perhaps alienated many fans of the band&#x27;s first three albums — causing a backlash from the black metal scene.

Ulver, now only consisting of Rygg and Ylwizaker, issued an EP, &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, in September 1999. The music moving to the more heavily electronic approach, bridging the gap to the film-noir ambiance of 2000&#x27;s full-length album &quot;Perdition City&quot;. In the sleeve notes to &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, the group declared:
&quot;Perdition City&quot;, issued in March 2000, was described as moody, atmospheric electronica, cinematic in scope, evoking a soundtrack for an imaginary film. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; praised the album, ranking it top ten that year, noting &quot;This ain&#x27;t rock &#x27;n roll. This is evolution on such a grand scale that most bands wouldn&#x27;t even be able to wrap their tiny little minds around it.&quot; Musically, Ulver not only explores new genres, but also shift from extrovert, into more introverted moods, or interior music.

Later that year, Jørn H. Sværen joined the band. The band followed up &quot;Perdition City&quot; with two improv/minimalist/ambient/glitch companion EPs, called &quot;Silence Teaches You How to Sing&quot; and &quot;Silencing the Singing&quot;, in September and December 2001, respectively. The material featured here was loosely recorded during the sessions for the &quot;Perdition City&quot; album. The style is more experimental/atmospheric and less beat-oriented; rather mood pieces that revolve around the &quot;Perdition City&quot; theme. Due to the experimental nature of the music, both &quot;Silence&quot; EPs were limited to two thousand, and three thousand copies. However, both EPs were re-released as one disc, under the title &quot;Teachings in Silence&quot;, in November 2002.

Ulver, now with more confidence in their ambient sensibilities descent into the world of film soundtracks, producing scores for &quot;Lyckantropen&quot; (issued as &quot;Lyckantropen Themes&quot;, in November 2002), &quot;Svidd neger&quot; (issued as &quot;Svidd neger&quot;, in September 2003) and a joint soundtrack with singer/songwriter Tom McRae for the multiple award-winning &quot;Uno&quot;. Ulver were praised for their soundtrack work, and their ability to adapt and providing a sense of continuity to each film. The song &quot;Silence Teaches You How to Sing&quot; was later used in the 2012 supernatural horror film &quot;Sinister&quot;.

Ulver celebrated their ten-year anniversary with a remix album, &quot;1993–2003: 1st Decade in the Machines&quot;, issued in April 2003, featuring contributions from Third Eye Foundation, Bogdan Raczynski, Fennesz, V/Vm and Merzbow among others.

In 2002, the trio announced that they were working on a string remake of &quot;Nattens madrigal&quot;, but Rygg later stated that the project &quot;is in a state of total dormancy.&quot;

===&quot;Blood Inside&quot; and &quot;Shadows of the Sun&quot; (2003–2008)===

In August 2003, Ulver issued an EP, &quot;A Quick Fix of Melancholy&quot;, essentially a teaser for the forthcoming album, &quot;Blood Inside&quot;. A delicate marriage of orchestration and electronica the EP features text by Christian Bök and a remix of a song from &quot;Kveldssanger&quot;.

In 2004, the group collaborated with Sámi vocalist Mari Boine and percussionist Marilyn Mazur to score Mona J. Hoel&#x27;s film &quot;Salto, salmiakk og kaffe&quot;. The film premiered in August 2004, however, the soundtrack remains unreleased.

Ulver issued &quot;Blood Inside&quot; in June 2005, produced together with King Crimson collaborator Ronan Chris Murphy. The album returns to more classical arrangements and instrumentation, described as &quot;a beautifully crafted album of both substance and style. Certainly, &quot;Blood Inside&quot; is still not for everyone, but those who choose to indulge in this will find themselves rewarded on every level.&quot; &quot;[&quot;Blood Inside&quot;] is ambiguous and full of intricate layers and influences working to tell a story that is both haunting and mesmerising. Garm&#x27;s beautiful distorted vocals act as outcries of a desperate man hidden, pushed in the background of the story that the instrumentation tells.&quot; Webzine Avantgarde-metal.com concludes: &quot;the sound of the album is maybe their most extravagant, extrovert, dynamic and wild, ranging from swing band to danceable hard electronic pop, with a lot of peaceful moments in between so much energy.&quot;

Ulver and drone metal band Sunn O))) collaborated on the fifteen-minute track &quot;CUT WOODeD&quot; - a tribute to the deceased film director Ed Wood, which later appeared on Sunn O)))&#x27;s &quot;WHITEbox&quot; box set, issued in July 2006.

&quot;Shadows of the Sun&quot; was issued in October 2007 in Europe and the United States and would include collaborations with artists Pamelia Kurstin contributing theremin, Mathias Eick on trumpet and Christian Fennesz, adding supplemental shimmer. Rygg described it as &quot;our most personal record to date.&quot; Described as &quot;low-key, dark and tragic,&quot; the album received critical acclaim, and in February 2008 the album won the Oslo Awards for &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, in 2008. The album was also voted best album of 2007 at the website Sonic Frontiers.

===Changes in personnel (2009–2012)===
In 2009, Ulver announced it would become a quartet. Its three extant members — Kristoffer Rygg, Tore Ylwizaker and Jørn H. Sværen — enlisted British composer and multi-instrumentalist Daniel O&#x27;Sullivan (Æthenor, Guapo, Mothlite) into the collective. Ole Alexander Halstensgård was another prominent musician to be included in the live-act.

The band accepted an invitation to appear at the Norwegian Festival of Literature, at Maihaugsalen (part of Maihaugen) in Lillehammer, Norway on 30 May 2009. The collective were accompanied by guest musicians Lars Pedersen (aka When) on drums, Pamelia Kurstin playing Theremin and Halstensgård (a founding member of Norwegian group Paperboys). The success of this performance lead to them embarking on a string of other live performances in 2009 and 2010, selling out prestigious venues, such as the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, Volksbühne in Berlin and La Cigale in Paris before they returned to their homeland for their performance at The Norwegian Opera House. Ulver were the first band outside the established Norwegian music scene to be invited to play at the Opera House.

The first album to feature the quartet is &quot;Wars of the Roses&quot;, issued in April 2011 via Kscope, preceded by a single, &quot;February MMX,&quot; in February. The album entered the Norwegian National Album Charts at Number 17. SputnikMusic noted, &quot;&quot;Wars of the Roses&quot;&#x27; thoughtful conception and execution serves only for a thoughtful listen. After all this time, it still remains a privilege to bear witness to these wolves evolve once again.&quot; Murat Batmaz, commenting for &quot;Sea of Tranquility&quot; webzine, noted, &quot;it amalgamates musical traits from its predecessors while re-shaping them with a more direct approach.&quot;

In November 2011, Kscope released &quot;The Norwegian National Opera,&quot; a film documenting Ulver&#x27;s performance at The Norwegian National Opera on 31 July 2010. Described as &quot;mesmerizing and stunningly beautiful&quot; and &quot;a unique and at times hypnotic live experience; far from a conventional one; more akin to a piece of performance art than a standard concert.&quot;

Ulver&#x27;s next project, &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; came in the form of a collection of covers of &quot;60s psychedelic chestnuts&quot;, issued on Jester Records, under license to Kscope, in May 2012. The album, a reinterpretation of &#x27;60s psychedelia, was intended by Ulver as a reflection on lost innocence. The album received favourable reviews; Ben Ratliffe, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; for its treatment of the original music, commenting that &quot;these cover versions reward the ambition of the original songs, draping them with stateliness.&quot; Placing the album in the context of Ulver&#x27;s discography, Ratliffe noted that &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; is &quot;the most straight-ahead Ulver record ever, but still strange&quot;. A music video for &quot;Magic Hollow&quot;, directed by Justin Oakey, was released in April 2012.

In 2012, Roadburn Records issued an installment in their &quot;Roadburn&quot; EP series on 7″ vinyl, featuring the songs &quot;I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night)&quot; b/w &quot;Reverberation (Doubt).&quot; Limited to 500 copies, of which 100 copies is gold vinyl - the release commemorated Ulver&#x27;s performance at the Roadburn Festival, 013, Tilburg, in the Netherlands, on 12 April 2012. The full performance at the festival was issued as &quot;Live at Roadburn&quot; in June 2013 via Roadburn Records. It was the first and only time tracks from &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; were performed live.

Announcing a new DIY approach, Ulver released a press statement, &quot;The Art of Dying&quot;, an articulated rant about the changes in the record industry. The band collected some covers and curiosities, and made them available to download as &quot;Oddities &amp; Rarities#1&quot;, including material from tribute albums and the &quot;Uno&quot; soundtrack.

===&quot;Messe I.X–VI.X&quot; (2012–2015)===
Ulver were commissioned in 2012 by the Tromsø Kulturhus (House of Culture) in Norway, in a cooperation with the Arctic Opera and Philharmonic Orchestra cultural institution to compose and perform a Mass. With additional aid and advice from composer Martin Romberg, and contemporary composers/musicians Ole-Henrik Moe and Kari Rønnekleiv, &quot;Messe I.X–VI.X&quot; was composed and first performed live by Ulver, alongside the Tromsø Chamber Orchestra on 21 September 2012. The band then took the recordings back to Crystal Canyon, Oslo and spent winter and spring in post-production, honing the material for its studio-equivalent. Issued in August 2013, Ulver&#x27;s tenth studio album received universal critical acclaim, described as &quot;a challenging work and an album of rare beauty&quot;.

In January 2014, Ulver collaborated with Norway&#x27;s National Theatre, providing the soundtrack to &quot;Demoner 2014&quot; (translated &quot;Demons 2014&quot;); based on a text by Geir Gulliksen, in turn freely based on the Dostoyevsky novel &quot;Demons&quot; (also known as &quot;The Possessed&quot;), the play premiered on 8 February 2014.

On 2 January 2014, Ulver announced an 11-date European tour, &quot;the February dates will consist of partly new and improv-based material, likely to revolve around motifs already familiar to our familiars. We are looking forward to get out there, and hope for some interesting music to be born those evenings and nights. We also aim to document some of it for those of you who cannot come.&quot;

Ulver released a collaboration album with Sunn O))), entitled &quot;Terrestrials&quot;, issued in February 2014 via Southern Lord. Produced by Rygg and Stephen O&#x27;Malley, it has been described as &quot;three live improvisation pieces&quot;. On 10 December 2013, a sample from the closing track, &quot;Eternal Return,&quot; was released for streaming. It was also streamed on Pitchfork Advance on the day it was released, until 10 February 2014.

In April 2014, Century Media announced &quot;Trolsk Sortmetall 1993-1997&quot;, collecting together the albums &quot;Bergtatt&quot;, &quot;Kveldssanger&quot; and &quot;Nattens madrigal&quot;, as well as the band&#x27;s original demo cassette, &quot;Vargnatt&quot;, and other rarities.

In July 2014, Ulver contributed a cover of Shirley Collins&#x27; &quot;Poor Murdered Woman&quot; in support of Burning Bridges &amp; Fifth Column Film&#x27;s project &quot;The Ballad of Shirley Collins&quot;. A film, book and tribute album honouring the life and work of this musical pioneer and folk legend.

On 3 June 2015 on the band&#x27;s official website, in a statement titled &quot;Only Theatre of Pain,&quot; Ulver announce a number of forthcoming projects; including &quot;Messe in Concert&quot; at the distinguished Teatro Regio, Parma, Italy, 16 November 2013, with the Mg_Inc Orchestra. A live document of their concert featuring Pamelia Kurstin, including 15 minutes of new music written and performed specifically for the scene and topped up with full orchestra versions of &quot;Little Blue Bird&quot; and &quot;Eos&quot;. They continue to announce their newest works, tentatively titled &quot;The Assassination of Julius Caesar&quot;, with texts and themes in development.

===&quot;ATGCLVLSSCAP&quot;, &quot;Riverhead&quot; and &quot;The Assassination of Julius Caesar&quot; (2015–2019)===
On 15 October 2015, in an interview with website &quot;Steel for Brains&quot;, Ulver announced &quot;ATGCLVLSSCAP&quot;, a double album with over 80 minutes worth of material, consisting of multitracked and studio-enhanced live, mostly improvisational, rock and electronic soundscapes, 2/3 of which had never been heard before. Announcing further details on 28 October, the album was released on 22 January 2016 on Vinyl and CD formats via newly formed, London-based label House of Mythology. The basis for the album – which the band worked on under the moniker &quot;12&quot; – arrives from recordings made at twelve different live shows that Ulver performed in February 2014, in which the band played a set improvisatory &quot;free rock&quot; performances. Band member Daniel O&#x27;Sullivan took the multitrack recordings, sculpting and editing hours of material in his North London home, before Anders Møller, Kristoffer Rygg and Tore Ylwizaker got involved, completing the recordings at Subsonic Society and Oak Hill Studios, Oslo.

In 2016, the band composed the score for the Canadian drama film &quot;Riverhead&quot;. In October, a new studio album, &quot;The Assassination of Julius Caesar&quot; was announced to be released on 7 April as well as a performance at the 2017 edition of Roadburn Festival. A string of festival dates were subsequently added. The album showed the band switching directions in terms of musical stylisms once again, focusing on a sound that was described by AllMusic critic Thom Jurek as &quot;drenched in moody &#x27;80s synth pop.&quot; On 11 November 2017, Ulver released &quot;Sic Transit Gloria Mundi&quot;, a 3-track EP with two songs taken from &quot;The Assassination of Julius Caesar&quot; recording sessions, and a Frankie Goes to Hollywood cover, &quot;The Power of Love&quot;.

===&quot;Drone Activity&quot;, &quot;Flowers of Evil&quot;, and &quot;Scary Muzak&quot; (2019–present)===
On 1 March, Ulver shared a short excerpt of music, titled &quot;Blood, Fire, Woods, Diamonds&quot;, on their Facebook page. Two days later, they announced a new live album, titled &quot;Drone Activity&quot;, consisting of four new pieces of live music edited in studio following a process reminiscent of the one used of &quot;ATGCLVLSSCAP&quot;. On 4 April, the band shared a second excerpt from the album, titled &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot;. The album was released on 11 May 2019.

Ulver announced their plans for 2020 through Norwegian publication &quot;Ballade&quot; on 17 October 2019: &quot;Ulver is working on a new album, planned to be released in 2020. (...) The Norwegian cult band is also preparing a retrospective book about the band&#x27;s history through the 1990s and up until today.&quot; A European tour was scheduled for May 2020, however, it was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, &quot;Flowers of Evil&quot; was announced and was released on 28 August through House of Mythology. The singles &quot;Russian Doll&quot;, &quot;Little Boy&quot; and &quot;Nostalgia&quot; were released in advance. On the same day, &quot;Wolves Evolve: The Ulver Story&quot;, a limited edition book written by Tore Engelsen Espedal, Phil Alexander, Nile Bowie and Torolf Kroglund and detailing the band&#x27;s history, was released as well.

Ulver released their thirteenth album &quot;Scary Muzak&quot; on 31 October 2021. Five of the twelve songs on &quot;Scary Muzak&quot; are covers from the soundtrack to John Carpenter&#x27;s 1978 &quot;Halloween&quot;.

On 19 August 2024, Ulver announced through their social media that long-time member Tore Ylwizaker had died three days earlier, on 16 August, his 54th birthday.

== Accolades ==
==Live appearances==
===At the Norwegian Festival of Literature===
On 30 May 2009 Ulver performed live for the first time in 15 years at Maihaugsalen (part of Maihaugen) in Lillehammer, Norway. The concert was a part of the Norwegian Festival of Literature. The three band members were accompanied by guest musicians: Lars Pedersen (aka When) on drums, Daniel O&#x27;Sullivan (also in Æthenor, Guapo, Mothlite) on guitar and bass, Pamelia Kurstin playing theremin and Ole Aleksander Halstensgård (from Paperboys).

Subsequently, the only live appearances outside Norway were held at the Brutal Assault Festival in the Czech Republic on 7 August and at the Gagarin205 club in Athens, Greece (16 November). More festival appearances in Norway were announced: &quot;Øyafestivalen&quot; at Middelalderparken, Oslo (11 August), &quot;Møllafestivalen&quot; in Gjerstad (14 August), &quot;Pstereo &#x27;09&quot; at Marinen, Trondheim (21 August) and London&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall (9 October).

===Ulver at the Opera===
On 31 July 2010 Ulver performed live at the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet with Christian Fennesz and the performance artist Ian Johnstone.

===&quot;Wars of the Roses&quot; Tour===
From 22 March 2011 to 21 April, Ulver played in several European countries to support their 2011 album &quot;Wars of the Roses&quot;. On this tour they performed said album in its entirety, and also added some abstract/improvised passages. Zweizz supported these shows.

===&quot;Messe I.X–VI.X&quot; performances===
Following its original performance at Tromsø Kulturhus in Tromsø, Norway, with Tromsø Chamber Orchestra, on 21 September 2012, Ulver have performed &quot;Messe I.X–VI.X&quot; in its entirety a further three times: On 20 May 2013 at Wave-Gotik-Treffen, Leipzig, Germany with the Stüba Philharmonie, Volkspalast and on 16 November 2013 at Teatro Regio, Parma, Italy with the MG_INC Orchestra and at the Dark MOFO festival, 17 June 2017, in Hobart, Australia, the orchestras being conducted by composer Martin Romberg.

===&quot;The Assassination of Julius Caesar&quot; performances===
In the wake of the release of &quot;The Assassination of Julius Caesar&quot;, Ulver played a few concerts in Europe, and gave their first two shows in Australia. In November, they toured Europe, playing their last album in its entirety, only adding a few songs from their &quot;Sic Transit Gloria Mundi&quot; EP released shortly before the beginning of the tour. Stian Westerhus was their opening act, promoting its solo album &quot;Amputation&quot;, and supporting Ulver on stage as a guitarist during some songs he played on the last Ulver&#x27;s release.

===First North American performances===
On 21 and 22 March 2019, Ulver played at Irving Plaza in New York City, their first North American shows ever. It was described by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; as &quot;New York&#x27;s ultimate goth night&quot;. A return to the United States was cancelled when Ulver announced that pre-sale tickets were &quot;too modest&quot; up against the &quot;big risk&quot; of touring with their production in the US.

<doc id="589925" wikidata="Q982177" url="?curid=589925" title="Larry Fine">
<text>Louis Feinberg (October 4, 1902 – January 24, 1975), better known by his stage name Larry Fine, was an American actor, comedian and musician. He is best known as a member of the comedy act the Three Stooges and was often called &quot;The Middle Stooge&quot;.

==Early life==
Fine was born to a Russian Jewish family at 3rd and South Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on October 4, 1902. Several sources erroneously listed his birthday as October 5. He was the eldest of four children. His father, Joseph Feinberg, and mother, Fanny Lieberman, owned a watch repair and jewelry shop.

In his early childhood, Fine&#x27;s arm was accidentally burned with hydrochloric acid that his father used to test jewelry for its gold content. Fine had picked up the bottle and, mistaking it for a beverage, raised it to his lips when his father noticed and knocked it out of his hand, accidentally splashing the acid on his son&#x27;s forearm, causing extensive damage to it.

Fine&#x27;s parents later gave him violin lessons to help strengthen the damaged muscles in his forearm. He became so proficient that his parents wanted to send him to a European music conservatory, but the plan was thwarted by the outbreak of World War I. Fine later played the violin in the Stooge films. To further strengthen his damaged arm, Fine took up boxing in his teens, winning one professional bout. His father was opposed to Larry&#x27;s fighting in public and put an end to his brief boxing career.

==Acting career==
===Vaudeville===
At an early age, Fine started performing as a violinist in vaudeville. Between 1925 and 1928, while serving as the master of ceremonies at Rainbo Gardens in Chicago, Fine met Shemp Howard and Ted Healy, who were performing in the Shubert Brothers&#x27; &quot;A Night in Spain&quot;. Since Howard was leaving the play for a few months, they asked him to be a replacement &quot;stooge&quot;. Fine joined Ted&#x27;s other stooges, Bobby Pinkus and Sam &quot;Moody&quot; Braun. Howard returned in September 1928 to finish &quot;Spain&quot; national tour.

In early 1929, Healy signed a contract to perform in the Shuberts&#x27; new revue &quot;A Night in Venice&quot;. Healy brought Fine, Shemp Howard, and Moe Howard together for the first time as a trio. &quot;Moe, Larry, and Shemp&quot;, along with Fred Sanborn, appeared in &quot;Venice&quot; from 1929 through March 1930. Fine, Shemp Howard and Moe Howard toured with three different titles: &quot;Ted Healy &amp; His Racketeers&quot;, &quot;Ted Healy and his Southern Gentlemen&quot;, and &quot;Ted Healy and His Three Lost Souls&quot; before going to Hollywood in the summer to film Fox Studio&#x27;s &quot;Soup to Nuts&quot; (1930).

Fine and the Howard brothers broke up with Healy after &quot;Soup to Nuts&quot; and toured as &quot;Howard, Fine, and Howard: Three Lost Soles&quot; from the fall of 1930 to the summer of 1932. In July 1932, Fine and Moe Howard teamed up with Healy again, adding Curly Howard (real first name: Jerome) to the group. The new lineup premiered at RKO Palace Theatre in Cleveland on August 27, 1932. Shemp Howard split off to pursue a solo career.

===Larry&#x27;s hair===
Fine was easily recognized in the Stooge features by his large top bald spot with thick, bushy, curly auburn hair around the sides and back; Moe called him &quot;Porcupine&quot;. According to rumor, his trademark hairstyle had its origin from his first meeting with Healy in which Fine had just wet his hair in a sink, with it drying oddly as they talked. Healy encouraged Fine to keep the hairstyle.

===Three Stooges features===

Beginning in 1934, The Three Stooges set about making 206 short films and several features, their most prolific period starring Fine, Moe Howard, and Curly Howard. Their career with Healy was marked by disputes over pay, film contracts, and Healy&#x27;s drinking and verbal abuse. Fine and the Howard brothers finally left Healy for good in 1934.

In films from the Curly era, the Larry character did more reacting than acting, staying in the background and serving as the voice of reason in contrast to the zany antics of Moe and Curly. He was a surrealistic foil and the middle ground between Moe&#x27;s gruffly &quot;bossy&quot; and Curly&#x27;s childish personae. Like the other Stooges, Larry was often on the receiving end of Moe&#x27;s abuse. His reasonableness was the perfect foil to Moe&#x27;s brusque bluntness and Curly&#x27;s or Shemp&#x27;s boyish immaturity, but Larry sometimes proposed something impossible or illogical and was quickly put down verbally and physically by Moe, who often pulled a handful of hair out of Larry&#x27;s head. Film critic Leonard Maltin wrote, &quot;Larry is the least distinctive character of the trio, but he adds a pleasing touch by siding with either Moe or Curly, depending on the situation, thereby enabling him to show moments of lucidity as well as lunacy.&quot;

After Curly suffered a debilitating stroke in May 1946, Shemp replaced him in the act. The Shemp era marked a period of increased onscreen presence for Larry, who had been relegated to a background role during the Curly era. Upon Shemp&#x27;s return, he was allotted equal onscreen time, even becoming the focus of several films, in particular, &quot;Fuelin&#x27; Around&quot; (1949) and &quot;He Cooked His Goose&quot; (1952).

On November 22, 1955, Shemp died of a heart attack. Joe Palma doubled for Shemp in the next four films; then Joe Besser succeeded him as the third Stooge in 1956. After Columbia Pictures closed its comedy-shorts department at the end of 1957, Joe DeRita replaced Besser.

In the earliest Stooge films, Larry frequently indulged in utterly nutty behavior. Fine livened scenes up with improvised remarks or ridiculous actions. In the hospital spoof &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1934), Larry, dressed as a surgeon and wielding a large kitchen knife, chortles: &quot;Let&#x27;s plug him... and see if he&#x27;s ripe!&quot; In &quot;Disorder in the Court&quot; (1936), a tense courtroom scene is interrupted by Larry breaking into a wild Tarzan yell. Of course, after each of his outbursts, Moe would gruffly put him down. According to Fine&#x27;s brother, Fine developed a callus on one side of his face from being slapped so often by Moe.

Larry&#x27;s goofiness has been described as an extension of Fine&#x27;s own relaxed personality. Director Charles Lamont recalled: &quot;Larry was a nut. He was the kind of guy who always said anything. He was a yapper.&quot; Writer-director Edward Bernds remembered that Fine&#x27;s suggestions for the scripts were often &quot;flaky&quot;, but occasionally contained good comic ideas.

The Three Stooges became a big hit on television in 1959 when Columbia Pictures released a batch of their films, whose popularity brought them to a new audience and revitalized their careers.

==Personal life==
Fine met his wife, Mabel Haney, in 1922, when both were working in vaudeville. They married in 1926. The couple had a busy social life.

Fine was called a &quot;yes man&quot; since he was always so agreeable. His devil-may-care personality carried over to the world of finance. He was a terrible businessman and spent his money as soon as he earned it. He had a significant gambling addiction, leading him to gamble his money away at racetracks or high-stakes gin rummy games. In an interview, Fine admitted that he often gave money to actors who needed help and never asked to be repaid. As Joe Besser and director Edward Bernds recalled, because of his constant free-spending and gambling, Fine was almost forced into bankruptcy when Columbia stopped filming Three Stooges shorts in December of 1957.

Because of his profligate ways and Mabel&#x27;s dislike for housekeeping, Larry and his family lived in hotels—first the President Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where his daughter Phyllis was raised, then the Hollywood Knickerbocker Hotel. He did not own a house until the late 1940s, when he purchased one in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles, California.

On May 30, 1967, Mabel died of a sudden heart attack at age 63. Larry was on the road and about to take the stage for a live show at Rocky Point Amusement Park in Warwick, Rhode Island, when he heard the news. He immediately flew home to California, leaving the other two Stooges to improvise their remaining shows at the park.

Mabel&#x27;s death came five and a half years after the death of their only son, John, in a car crash on November 17, 1961, at age 24. Their daughter, Phyllis, died of cancer on April 3, 1989, aged 60. Phyllis&#x27;s husband, Don Lamond, was a noted television personality in Los Angeles, best known for hosting the Stooges shorts on KTTV for many years; their son (Larry&#x27;s grandson) Eric Lamond represented the family in the Stooges&#x27; holding company (C3 Entertainment) until his death in 2021.

Fine is sometimes erroneously reported to be the father of sportscaster Warner Wolf, who is the son of Jack Wolf, one of several other &quot;stooges&quot; who played in Ted Healy&#x27;s vaudeville act at one time or another.

==Final acting years and death==

In 1965, Fine, Moe Howard, and Joe DeRita started a new TV comedy show, &quot;The New 3 Stooges&quot;, a mixture of live and animated segments. The show produced good ratings, but the men were too old to do slapstick comedy well. Fine began showing signs of mental impairment, such as trouble delivering his lines.

A few years later, the men started working on &quot;Kook&#x27;s Tour&quot;, a new TV series. On January 9, 1970, Fine suffered a debilitating stroke that paralyzed the left side of his body, which marked the end of his performing career. Producer Norman Maurer subsequently re-edited the footage into a feature-length film, with new footage of Moe Howard introducing the premise.

Fine eventually moved to the Motion Picture Country House, an industry retirement community in Woodland Hills, where he spent his remaining years, and used a wheelchair during the last five. Even in his paralyzed state, Fine did what he could to entertain the other patients, and completed his &quot;as told to&quot; autobiography &quot;Stroke of Luck&quot;. He also received visits from Moe Howard. Fine remained accessible to Stooge fans, regularly hosting them despite his disability. When asked if spending his life as a Stooge was enjoyable, he answered, &quot;it wasn&#x27;t fun: it was work—but it paid off good, so I enjoyed it.&quot;

Like Curly Howard, Fine suffered several additional strokes before his death on January 24, 1975, at the nursing home in Woodland Hills, aged 72. He was interred with his wife and son in a crypt at Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in the Freedom Mausoleum, Sanctuary of Liberation. Moe died three months later.

==Legacy==

* The Three Stooges have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in honor of their contributions to the motion-pictures industry at 1560 Vine Street in Hollywood, dedicated on August 30, 1983, with ex-stooge Joe Besser in attendance.
* The voice of Stimpy from &quot;The Ren and Stimpy Show&quot; was modeled after an &quot;amped up&quot; version of Fine, according to Stimpy&#x27;s voice actor Billy West.
* In the 2000 made-for-TV movie, Fine was played by Evan Handler.
* In a 2004 &quot;New Yorker&quot; feature on the Farrelly Brothers&#x27; attempt to write a script for a new Three Stooges movie, Peter Farrelly offered his theory of Stooge appreciation: “Growing up, first you watched Curly, then Moe, and then your eyes got to Larry. He’s the reactor, the most vulnerable. Five to 14, Curly; 14 to 21, Moe. Anyone out of college, if you’re not looking at Larry, you don’t have a good brain.”
* A large mural of Fine appears on a wall at the busy intersection of 3rd and South Streets, near his birthplace in Philadelphia. The effort to create a mural on that site began when a local weekly newspaper suggested that the city should somehow honor him. Dedicated on October 26, 1999, with Fine&#x27;s sister in attendance, that mural showed Larry with a peculiar look on his face. In May 2006, a similar mural showing Larry with a more animated expression and playing the violin was painted over the original mural. This mural stands over Jon&#x27;s Bar and Grill with a sign reading &quot;Birthplace of Larry Fine&quot;.
* On October 15, 2009, the Associated Alumni of Central High School in Philadelphia inducted Fine into that school&#x27;s Hall of Fame, though he never graduated. A member of the Central Alumni Hall of Fame Committee pointed out, &quot;Many people are not even aware that Mr. Fine was a Philadelphian and that is a part of what we’re trying to do.&quot;
* In the 2012 Farrelly brothers&#x27; film &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;, Larry is portrayed by Sean Hayes. Young Larry is portrayed by Lance Chantiles-Wertz.

<text>Beornred (Old English: &quot;Beornrǣd&quot;) (? – 757) was a Mercian Thane who was briefly King of Mercia in 757. Beornred ascended the throne following the murder of King Æthelbald. However, he was defeated by Offa and forced to flee the country, and was killed that same year. There is very little information about him, and the mentions of him are commonly brief.

According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, in 757: &quot;...Æthelbald, king of Mercia, was killed at Seckington, and his body rests at Repton; and he ruled 41 years. And then Beornred succeeded to the kingdom, and held it a little while and unhappily; and that same year Offa put Beornred to flight and succeeded to the kingdom, and held it for 39 years...&quot; According to Ingulf, an 11th-century Benedictine abbot, Beornred was regarded as a tyrant, while Roger of Wendover, a thirteenth-century chronicler, states that he was an unjust king and that the people of Mercia rose in rebellion against him. He was possibly involved in his predecessor&#x27;s death. According to Professor Michelle P. Brown, Beornred has been considered by some historians to have been part of the same dynasty as Beorhtric of Wessex, as well as several other prominent Anglo-Saxon nobles whose names begin with the letter B.

<doc id="589932" wikidata="Q507763" url="?curid=589932" title="Thomas Horsfield">
<text>Thomas Horsfield (May 12, 1773 – July 24, 1859) was an American physician and naturalist who worked extensively in Indonesia, describing numerous species of plants and animals from the region. He was later a curator of the East India Company Museum in London.

==Early life==
Horsfield was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He was the grandson of Timothy Horsfield, Sr. (1708-1773), who was born in Liverpool and emigrated to New York in 1725. The Horsfield family converted from the Church of England to Moravianism, a Protestant denomination with a strong emphasis on education. In 1748, he moved his family to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and joined them the next year. Horsfield&#x27;s father was Timothy Horsfield, Jr. and he married Juliana Sarah Parsons in 1738. Thomas Horsfield was born in Bethlehem on May 12, 1773. He was educated at the Moravian schools in Bethlehem and Nazareth. He studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and graduated in 1798. His thesis on the physiological effects of poison ivy demonstrated his interest in botany.

==Travels in Asia==
In 1799, he accepted a post as surgeon on the vessel &quot;China&quot;, a merchant vessel that was to sail to Java. He passed through Batavia and was struck by the beauty of the region. In 1801, he applied to be a surgeon with the Dutch Colonial Army in Batavia. Taking up appointment there, he took an interest in the flora, fauna, and geology of the region. In particular, he studied the botany and the insects of the region. One of the first of many species to named after him was the butterfly, &quot;Taenaris horsfieldii&quot;. The East India Company took control of the island from the Dutch in 1811, and Horsfield began to collect natural history specimens on behalf of the governor and friend Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles. In 1816, Java was restored to the Dutch and Horsfield moved west to Sumatra. In 1819, he was forced to leave the island due to ill health, and returned to London on board the &quot;Lady Raffles&quot;.

==England==
On returning to London, Horsfield continued to be in contact with Sir Stamford Raffles and became a keeper of the museum of the East India Company on Leadenhall Street, London, working under Charles Wilkins. He stayed in this position, later as a curator, until his death on July 24, 1859. Horsfield took an interest in geology, botany, zoology, and entomology. He was influenced by William Sharp Macleay and his quinarian system of classification. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of London (1828) and a fellow of the Linnean Society (1820), later becoming a vice president. In 1828, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. Horsfield was appointed assistant secretary of the Zoological Society of London at its formation in 1826. In 1833, he was a founder of what became the Royal Entomological Society of London. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1828. In 1838, he became correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands; when that became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851, he joined as foreign member. Horsfield died at his home in Camden Town and was buried at the Moravian cemetery in Chelsea.

==Published works==

Horsfield wrote &quot;Zoological Researches in Java and the Neighbouring Islands&quot; (1824). He also classified a number of birds with Nicholas Aylward Vigors, most notably in their &quot;A Description of the Australian Birds in the Collection of the Linnean Society; With an Attempt at Arranging them According to Their Natural Affinities&quot; (Trans. Linn. Soc. Lond. (1827)). Together with the botanists Robert Brown and John Joseph Bennett he published the &quot;Plantae Javanicae rariores&quot; (1838–52).

==Legacy==
Horsfield is commemorated in the names of a number of animals and plants, including:
* Javanese flying squirrel, &quot;Iomys horsfieldii&quot;
* Horsfield&#x27;s fruit bat, &quot;Cynopterus horsfieldi&quot;
* Horsfield&#x27;s shrew, &quot;Crocidura horsfieldi&quot;
* Horsfield&#x27;s bat, &quot;Myotis horsfieldii&quot;, a species of small bat in the family Vespertilionidae
* Horsfield&#x27;s flying gecko, &quot;Gekko horsfieldii&quot;, a species of Asian gliding lizard
* Russian tortoise, &quot;Testudo horsfieldii&quot; 
* Horsfield&#x27;s spiny lizard, &quot;Salea horsfieldii&quot;, a species of agamid lizard found in southern India in the Nilgiri and Palni Hills
* Malabar whistling thrush, &quot;Myophonus horsfieldii&quot;, a bird found in peninsular India
* Indian scimitar-babbler, &quot;Pomatorhinus horsfieldii&quot;, an Old World babbler found in peninsular India
* White&#x27;s thrush (Horsfield&#x27;s thrush), &quot;Zoothera horsfieldi&quot;, a resident bird in Indonesia.
* Oriental cuckoo, &quot;Cuculus horsfieldi&quot;
* Horsfield&#x27;s bronze cuckoo, &quot;Chrysococcyx basalis&quot;
* Common darkie, &quot;Paragerydus horsfieldii&quot;, a small butterfly found in India
* &quot;Arhopala horsfieldi&quot;, a butterfly of the family Lycaenidae found in Asia
* South Indian blue oakleaf, &quot;Kallima horsfieldii&quot;, a nymphalid butterfly found in India
* &quot;Horsfieldia&quot;, a plant genus in the family Myristicaceae native to Southeast Asia
* Horsfield&#x27;s Tarsier, &quot;Cephalopachus bancanus&quot;

Zoological and botanical specimens collected by Horsfield are deposited in museums and herbaria across the world, including at the Natural History Museum, London of the United Kingdom, the Kew Herbarium, and the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL), Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria.

<text>Lebor Gabála Érenn (literally &quot;The Book of Ireland&#x27;s Taking&quot;; Modern Irish spelling: Leabhar Gabhála Éireann, known in English as The Book of Invasions) is a collection of poems and prose narratives in the Irish language intended to be a history of Ireland and the Irish from the creation of the world to the Middle Ages. There are a number of versions, the earliest of which was compiled by an anonymous writer in the 11th century. It synthesised narratives that had been developing over the foregoing centuries. The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; tells of Ireland being &quot;taken&quot; (settled) by six groups of people: the people of Cessair, the people of Partholón, the people of Nemed, the Fir Bolg, the Tuatha Dé Danann, and the Milesians. The first four groups are wiped out or forced to abandon the island; the fifth group represents Ireland&#x27;s pagan gods, while the final group represents the Irish people (the Gaels).

The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; was highly influential and was largely &quot;accepted as conventional history by poets and scholars down until the 19th century&quot;. Today, scholars regard the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; as primarily myth rather than history. It appears to be mostly based on medieval Christian pseudo-histories, but it also incorporates some of Ireland&#x27;s native pagan mythology. Scholars believe that the goal of its writers was to provide a history for Ireland that could compare to that of Rome or Israel, and which was compatible with Christian teaching. The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; became one of the most popular and influential works of early Irish literature. Mark Williams says it was &quot;written in order to bridge the chasm between Christian world-chronology and the prehistory of Ireland&quot;.

The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; is usually known in English as &quot;The Book of Invasions&quot; or &quot;The Book of Conquests&quot;. In Modern Irish it is &quot;Leabhar Gabhála Éireann&quot; or &quot;Leabhar Gabhála na hÉireann&quot;.

==Origin and purpose==

The writers of &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; sought to create an epic written history of the Irish comparable to that of the Israelites in the Old Testament of the Bible. This history was intended to fit the Irish into Christian world-chronology, to &quot;find a place for Ireland in the Biblical history of the world&quot;. In doing so, it links them to events from the Old Testament and likens them to the Israelites. Ancestors of the Irish were described as enslaved in a foreign land, fleeing into exile, wandering in the wilderness, or sighting the &quot;Promised Land&quot; from afar. The writers also sought to incorporate native pre-Christian stories about the origins of the Irish, and to reconcile them with medieval Christian lore.
The LGE seems to have been influenced by four major Christian works in particular:
* St Augustine&#x27;s &quot;De Civitate Dei&quot;, (The City of God), (413–426 AD)
* Orosius&#x27;s &quot;Historiae adversum paganos&quot;, &quot;Histories&quot;, (417)
* Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot;, translated into Latin by St Jerome as the &quot;Temporum liber&quot; (379)
* Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Etymologiae&quot; (&quot;Etymologies&quot;) (early 7th century)

The pre-Christian elements, however, were never entirely effaced. One of the poems in LGE, for instance, recounts how goddesses from among the Tuatha Dé Danann took husbands from the Gaeil when they &#x27;invaded&#x27; and &#x27;colonised&#x27; Ireland. The pattern of successive invasions recounted in the LGE is reminiscent of Timagenes of Alexandria&#x27;s account of the origins of the Gauls of continental Europe. Cited by the 4th-century historian Ammianus Marcellinus, Timagenes (1st century BC) describes how the ancestors of the Gauls were driven from their native lands in eastern Europe by a succession of wars and floods.

Numerous fragments of Ireland&#x27;s mythological history are scattered throughout the 7th and 8th centuries. In his &quot;Lectures on the Manuscript Materials of Ancient Irish History&quot; (1861), Eugene O&#x27;Curry, Professor of Irish History and Archaeology at the Catholic University of Ireland, discussed various genres of historical tales mentioned in the manuscripts:

The &quot;Tochomladh&quot; was an Immigration or arrival of a Colony; and under this name the coming of the several colonies of &quot;Parthalon&quot; of &quot;Nemedh&quot;, of the Firbolgs, the &quot;Tuatha Dé Danann&quot;, the Milesians, etc., into Erinn, are all described in separate tales. It is probably from the original records of these ancient stories that the early part of the various Books of Invasions has been compiled.

R. A. Stewart Macalister believes that the LGE was a conflation of two independent works: a &quot;History of the Gaedil&quot; (modelled after the history of the Israelites in the Old Testament), and an account of several pre-Gaelic settlements of Ireland (to the historicity of which Macalister gave very little credence). The latter was then inserted into the middle of the other work. Macalister theorised that the quasi-Biblical text had been a scholarly Latin work named &quot;Liber Occupationis Hiberniae&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Taking of Ireland&quot;).

The earliest surviving account of Irish origins is found in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; (&quot;History of the Britons&quot;), written in Wales in the 9th century. The story probably came from a now-lost Irish source. It says that Ireland was settled by three groups of people from the Iberian Peninsula. The first are the people of Partholón, who all die of plague. The second are the people of Nemed, who eventually return to Iberia. The last group are led by three sons of a warrior or soldier from Hispania (&quot;mīles Hispaniae&quot;), who sail to Ireland in thirty ships. They see a glass tower in the middle of the sea and set out to capture it, but when they reach it, all but one of their ships are sunk. Only one ship is saved, and its passengers are the ancestors of all the Irish.

When the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; was first compiled in the 11th century, the three waves of settlers had grown to six. Joseph Lennon says &quot;These waves may, in fact, represent the redactors&#x27; attempts to account for numerous oral accounts in Irish of origin legends&quot;. It is also suggested that there are six waves to match the &quot;Six Ages of the World&quot;.

These stories continued to be enriched and elaborated upon by Irish historian-poets throughout the 9th century. In the 10th and 11th centuries, several long historical poems were written that were later incorporated into the scheme of LGE. Most of the poems on which the 11th–12th century version of LGE was based were written by the following four poets:
* Eochaidh Ua Floinn (936–1004) from Armagh – Poems 30, 41, 53, 65, 98, 109, 111
* Flann Mainistrech mac Echthigrin (died 1056), lector and historian of Monasterboice Abbey – Poems ?42, 56, 67, ?82
* Tanaide (died &quot;c.&quot; 1075) – Poems 47, 54, 86
* Gilla Cómáin mac Gilla Samthainde (&quot;fl.&quot; 1072) – Poems 13, 96, 115

It was late in the 11th century that a single anonymous scholar appears to have brought together these and numerous other poems and fitted them into an elaborate prose framework – partly of his own composition and partly drawn from older, no longer extant sources (i.e. the &quot;tochomlaidh&quot; referred to above by O&#x27;Curry), paraphrasing and enlarging the verse. The result was the earliest version of LGE. It was written in Middle Irish, a form of Irish Gaelic used between 900 and 1200.

==Versions==
Within a century of its compilation there existed a plethora of copies and revisions of &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, with as many as 136 poems between them. It is &quot;somewhat misleading&quot; to refer to the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; as one narrative. No two versions are identical, although many elements remain the same. There are five recensions, surviving in more than a dozen medieval manuscripts:
* First Redaction (R¹): preserved in &quot;The Book of Leinster&quot; (c. 1150) and &quot;The Book of Fermoy&quot; (1373).
* Míniugud (Min): this recension is closely related to the Second Redaction. It is probably older than the surviving MSS of that redaction, though not older than the now-lost exemplar on which those MSS were based. The surviving sources are suffixed to copies of the Second Redaction.
* Second Redaction (R²): survives in no less than seven separate texts, the best known of which is &quot;The Great Book of Lecan&quot; (1418).
* Third Redaction (R³): preserved in both &quot;The Book of Ballymote&quot; (1391) and &quot;The Great Book of Lecan&quot;.
* O&#x27;Clery&#x27;s Redaction (K): written in 1631 by Mícheál Ó Cléirigh, a Franciscan scribe and one of the Four Masters. Unlike the earlier versions of LGE, this redaction is in Early Modern Irish but was admitted as an independent redaction by Macalister because there are indications that the author had access to sources which are no longer extant and which were not used by the compilers of the other four redactions. The work was compiled in the convent of Lisgool, near Enniskillen. O&#x27;Clery was assisted by Gillapatrick O&#x27;Luinin and Peregrine O&#x27;Clery (Michael O Clery&#x27;s third cousin once removed, and one of the Four Masters).

The following table summarises the extant manuscripts that contain versions of LGE. Most of the abbreviations used are taken from R. A. S. Macalister&#x27;s critical edition of the work (see references for details):
 
The LGE was translated into French in 1884. The first complete English translation was made by R. A. Stewart Macalister between 1937 and 1942. It was accompanied by an apparatus criticus, Macalister&#x27;s own notes and an introduction. Macalister&#x27;s translation &quot;synthesizes the versions of this already synthesized text&quot;.

==Contents==
The collection can be divided into ten chapters:

===Genesis===
A retelling of the familiar Christian story of the creation, the fall of Man and the early history of the world. In addition to Genesis, the author draws upon several recondite works for many of his details (e.g. the Syriac &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot;), as well as the four Christian works mentioned earlier (i.e. St. Augustine&#x27;s &quot;City of God&quot;, Orosius&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot;, Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot;, and Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Etymologies&quot;).

This part also contains a genealogy derived via the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; from the 6th-century Frankish Table of Nations, itself relying partly on the 1st-century &quot;Germania&quot; of Tacitus. It gives the descent of the major peoples of Europe from three brothers.

===Early history of the Gaels===
This chapter begins by explaining that all mankind is descended from Adam through the sons of Noah. It tells us how Noah&#x27;s son Japheth is the forebear of all Europeans (see Japhetites), how Japheth&#x27;s son Magog is the forebear of the Gaels and Scythians, and how Fénius Farsaid is the forebear of the Gaels. Fénius, a prince of Scythia, is described as one of 72 chieftains who built the Tower of Babel. His son Nel weds Scota, daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh, and they have a son named Goídel Glas. Goídel crafts the Goidelic (Gaelic) language from the original 72 languages that arose after the confusion of tongues. Goídel&#x27;s offspring, the Goidels (Gaels), leave Egypt at the same time as the Israelites (the Exodus) and settle in Scythia. After some time they leave Scythia and spend 440 years travelling the Earth, undergoing trials and tribulations akin to those of the Israelites. The druid Caicher foretells that their descendants will reach Ireland. After seven years at sea, they settle in the Maeotian marshes. They then sail via Crete and Sicily and eventually conquer Iberia. There, Goídel&#x27;s descendant Breogán founds a city called Brigantia, and builds a tower from the top of which his son Íth glimpses Ireland. Brigantia was the Roman name of Corunna in Galicia and Breogán&#x27;s tower is possibly based on the Tower of Hercules, which was rebuilt at Corunna by the Romans.

===Cessair===

According to the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, the first people to arrive in Ireland are led by Cessair, daughter of Bith, son of Noah. They are told to go to the western edge of the world to escape the oncoming Flood. They set out in three ships, but two are lost at sea. They land in Ireland, at Dún na mBárc on Bantry Bay, forty days before the Flood. The only survivors are Cessair, forty-nine other women, and three men: Fintan mac Bóchra, Bith and Ladra. The women are split evenly among the men. Each also takes one as his wife: Fintán takes Cessair, Bith takes Barrfhind and Ladra takes Alba. However, Bith and Ladra soon die and Ladra is the first man buried in Ireland. When the Flood comes, Fintán is the only one to survive. He becomes a salmon and later an eagle and a hawk, living for 5,500 years after the Flood, whence he becomes a man again and recounts Ireland&#x27;s history.

In an earlier version of the tale, the first woman in Ireland is Banba. Banba, Fódla and Ériu were a trio of land goddesses and their husbands were Mac Cuill (son of hazel), Mac Cecht (son of the plough) and Mac Gréine (son of the Sun). It is likely that Cessair, the three men and their three wives are a Christianised replacement for them. Fintán/Mac Cuill may also be linked to the Salmon of Knowledge, which gains all the world&#x27;s knowledge after eating nine hazelnuts that fall into a well. The women who accompany Cessair appear by their names to represent the world&#x27;s ancestral mothers; they included Alba (ancestor of the Britons), Espa (Spanish), German (Germans), Gothiam (Goths), Traige (Thracians), and so forth. Thus &quot;their arrival can be read as creating a microcosm of the whole world&#x27;s population in Ireland&quot;. Several other companions echo the names of ancient Irish goddesses.

===Partholón===

Ireland is then uninhabited for 300 years, until a second group of people arrive. They are led by Partholón, who is descended from Noah through Magog. They sail to Ireland via Gothia, Anatolia, Greece, Sicily and Iberia. They include Partholón&#x27;s wife Delgnat, their four chieftain sons, and others. When they arrive, there is only one open plain, three lakes and nine rivers. They clear four more plains and a further seven lakes burst from the ground. Named figures are credited with introducing cattle husbandry, ploughing, cooking, brewing, and dividing the island in four. They battle and defeat the mysterious Fomorians, who are led by Cichol Gricenchos. Eventually, Partholón and his people (now 5,000 men and 4,000 women) die of plague in a single week. Only one man, Tuan mac Cairill, survives. Like Fintán, he lives for centuries in a number of forms, so that he can recount Irish history. This chapter also includes the tale of Delgnat committing adultery with a servant.

&quot;Partholón&quot; comes from &quot;Bartholomaeus&quot; (Bartholomew) and he is probably an invention of the Christian writers, possibly being borrowed from a character of that name in the Christian histories of Saint Jerome and Isidore. The Fomorians have been interpreted as a group of deities who represent the harmful or destructive powers of nature; personifications of chaos, darkness, death, blight and drought.

===Nemed===
Ireland is then uninhabited for 30 years, until a third group of people arrive. They are led by Nemed, who is also descended from Noah through Magog.

They set out from the Caspian Sea in 44 ships but, after a year and a half of sailing, the only ship to reach Ireland is Nemed&#x27;s. On board are his wife, his four chieftain sons, and others. During their time in Ireland, the Nemedians clear twelve plains and build two royal forts, and four lakes burst from the ground. They win four battles against the Fomorians.

After Nemed and many others die of plague, the Nemedians are oppressed by the Fomorians Conand and Morc. Each Samhain, they must give two-thirds of their children, their wheat and their milk to the Fomorians. This tribute that the Nemedians are forced to pay may be &quot;a dim memory of sacrifice offered at the beginning of winter, when the powers of darkness and blight are in the ascendant&quot;. Eventually, they rise up against the Fomorians and attack the Tower of Conand with 60,000 warriors (30,000 on sea and 30,000 on land), defeating Conand. Morc then attacks, and almost all of the Nemedians are either killed in the fighting or swept away by the sea. Only one ship of thirty men escapes. Some of them go &quot;into the north of the world&quot;, some go to Britain and become the ancestors of all Britons, and some go south to Greece.

===Fir Bolg===

Those who went to Greece were enslaved by the Greeks and made to carry bags of soil and clay. After 230 years, they sail back to Ireland. They are known as the Fir Bolg (men of bags), and contain two sub-groups known as the Fir Domnann and Fir Gálioin. Led by their five chieftains, they divide Ireland into five provinces: Gann takes North Munster, Sengann takes South Munster, Genann takes Connacht, Rudraige takes Ulster and Slanga takes Leinster. A succession of nine High Kings rule over Ireland for the next 37 years.

===Tuatha Dé Danann===
Those who went into the north of the world are the supernaturally-gifted Tuatha Dé Danann (or Tuath Dé), who represent the main pagan gods of Ireland. They come to Ireland in dark clouds and land on Sliabh an Iarainn in the west, bringing with them Four Treasures. They fight the Fir Bolg for the ownership of Ireland in the First Battle of Mag Tuired (Moytura). The Tuath Dé are victorious. In some versions, the Fir Bolg flee Ireland and settle on remote offshore islands, while in others they are granted the province of Connacht. Nuada, king of the Tuath Dé, loses his hand or arm in the battle and is thus no longer fit to be their king. He is replaced by Bres (a half-Fomorian), who becomes High King of Ireland. However, Bres mistreats the Tuath Dé and neglects his kingly duties. This may reflect the occasional supremacy of the powers of blight (the Fomorians) over the powers of growth (the Tuath Dé). After seven years, Dian Cecht the physician and Credne the metalsmith replace Nuada&#x27;s hand/arm with a working silver one, and he re-takes the kingship. Though in some versions Nuada&#x27;s arm is replaced with a silver one by Dian Cecht immediately, but he is still considered unfit to be king and Dian Cecht&#x27;s son Cian replaces it with an arm made of flesh. The Tuath Dé then fight the Fomorians in the Second Battle of Moytura. Balor the Fomorian kills Nuada, but Balor&#x27;s grandson Lugh kills him and becomes king. The Tuath Dé enjoy 150 years of unbroken rule.

===Milesians===

The tale of the Gaels is now resumed. Íth, who has spied Ireland from the top of Breogán&#x27;s Tower, sails to the island with a group of men. He travels to Aileach Néit where he meets Ireland&#x27;s three kings: Mac Cuill, Mac Cecht and Mac Gréine of the Tuath Dé. However, he is killed by unnamed attackers and his men return to Iberia. The Gaels set sail with a great force to avenge his death and take Ireland. They are referred to here as the Sons of Míl Espáine (or Milesians). The name &quot;Míl Espáine&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;Miles Hispaniae&quot; (&quot;soldier of Hispania&quot;). After they land, they fight against the combined forces of the Tuath Dé and Fomorians. On their way to Tara, they are met on three mountains by the aforementioned Banba, Fódla and Ériu – the wives of Ireland&#x27;s three kings. Each goddess asks that the Gaels name the land after her. One of the Gaels, Amergin, promises that it shall be so. At Tara, they meet the three kings, who defend their claim to the joint kingship of the land. They ask that there be a three-day truce, during which the Gaels must stay a distance of nine waves from land. The Gaels agree, but once their ships are nine waves from Ireland, the Tuath Dé conjure up a great wind that prevents them from sailing back to land. However, Amergin calms the wind by reciting a verse. The surviving ships return to land and the two groups agree to divide Ireland between them. The Gaels take the world above, while the Tuath Dé take the world below (i.e. the Otherworld) and enter the sídhe mounds.

===Roll of the pagan kings of Ireland===
Modelled on the Biblical &quot;Books of Kings&quot;, this chapter recounts the deeds of various kings of Ireland, most of them legendary or semi-legendary, from the time of Éber and Érimón to the early 5th century of the Christian era.

===Roll of the Christian kings of Ireland===
A continuation of the previous chapter, it is the most accurate part of &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, being concerned with historical kings of Ireland whose deeds and dates are preserved in contemporary written records.

==Modern analysis==
For many centuries, the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; was accepted as an accurate and reliable account of the history of Ireland. As late as the 17th century, Geoffrey Keating drew on it while writing his history of Ireland, &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot;, and it was also used extensively by the authors of the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;. Recently, however, the work has been subjected to greater critical scrutiny. One contemporary scholar has placed it in &quot;the tradition of historical fabrication or &quot;pseudohistory&quot;&quot;; another has written of its &quot;generally spurious character&quot; and has drawn attention to its many &quot;fictions&quot;, while acknowledging that it &quot;embodies some popular traditions&quot;. The Irish archaeologist R. A. Stewart Macalister, who translated the work into English, wrote: &quot;There is not a single element of genuine historical detail, in the strict sense of the word, anywhere in the whole compilation&quot;.

The tale of the Gaels coming to Ireland is believed to be an invention of the Christian writers and an attempt to liken the Gaels to the Israelites. The claim of Scythian origins seems to be based on the superficial similarity of the names &quot;Scoti&quot; and &quot;Scythae&quot;. Other medieval pseudo-histories did likewise with other nations. For example, in his earlier &quot;History of the Goths&quot;, described by James Carey as &quot;a model of barbarian pseudohistory&quot;, Isidore concludes that the Goths and Gets are related due to their similar names, and says that they (along with the Scythians) descend from Magog. The claim of Iberian origins may be based on three things: the coincidental similarity of the names &quot;Iberia&quot; and &quot;Hibernia&quot;, Isidore describing Iberia as the &quot;mother[land] of the races&quot;, and Orosius describing Ireland as lying &quot;between Iberia and Britain&quot;. The claim that the Gaels settled in the Maeotian marshes seems to have been taken from the &quot;Book of the History of the Franks&quot;, and their travels to Crete and Sicily may have been based on the tale of Aeneas. Other parts of the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; derive from pagan Gaelic mythology, most notably the divine Tuath Dé and the demonic Fomorians, who have been likened to the Æsir and Vanir of Norse mythology. It is suggested that the Nemedians&#x27; struggle against the Fomorians is &quot;an echo of the primordial clash&quot; between these two groups of supernatural beings, and that the Fir Bolg are the human equivalent of the Fomorians.

While most scholars view the work as primarily myth rather than history, some have argued that it is loosely based on real events. In the 1940s, T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly created a model of Irish prehistory based on his analysis of the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; and the early Irish language. He suggested that there were four waves of Celtic migrations or invasions: the Cruthin (c. 700–500 BC), the Érainn or Builg (c. 500 BC), the Laigin, Domnainn and Gálioin (c. 300 BC), and the Gaels (c. 100 BC). He argued that the first three groups spoke Brittonic languages. O&#x27;Rahilly believed some of the &#x27;invasions&#x27; in &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; are based on these, but that others were invented by the writers. He also argued that many of Ireland&#x27;s &#x27;pre-Gaelic&#x27; peoples continued to flourish for centuries after 100 BC. O&#x27;Rahilly&#x27;s theory has been challenged by historians and archaeologists, and is no longer accepted.

In &quot;The White Goddess&quot; (1948), British poet and mythologist Robert Graves argued that myths brought to Ireland centuries before the introduction of writing were preserved and transmitted accurately by word of mouth before being written down in the Christian Era. Taking issue with Macalister, with whom he corresponded on this and other matters, he declared some of the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;&#x27;s traditions &quot;archaeologically plausible&quot;. &quot;The White Goddess&quot; itself has been the subject of much criticism by archaeologists and historians.

<text>The Tear Garden is a psychedelic/experimental/electronic band, formed by Edward Ka-Spel of The Legendary Pink Dots and cEvin Key of Skinny Puppy in 1985 after Key served as a sound engineer on tour in Canada for Ka-Spel. An EP, &quot;The Tear Garden&quot;, was released that same year. The pair have since released a number of records with the assistance of various guest musicians. Their most recent release, &quot;The Brown Acid Caveat&quot;, was released in July 2017.

==History==
The Tear Garden released the album &quot;Tired Eyes Slowly Burning&quot; in 1987. It featured contributions from Skinny Puppy members Dwayne Goettel, Nivek Ogre, and Dave Ogilvie. The record featured a nearly 17 minute long track titled &quot;You and Me and Rainbows&quot;, described by AllMusic&#x27;s Sean Carruthers as &quot;monolithic... but worth every second&quot;. A reissue of the album included the groups first EP, &quot;The Tear Garden&quot;, with the rest of the album. Members of the Legendary Pink Dots would henceforth contribute to Tear Garden and in 1992 they released the full-length album &quot;The Last Man to Fly&quot;. Another EP, &quot;Sheila Liked the Rodeo&quot;, much of which was recorded during the same sessions as &quot;The Last Man to Fly&quot;, was released in 1993. Only a few tracks feature Ka-Spel&#x27;s vocals.

With the collapse of Skinny Puppy in 1995 and cEvin&#x27;s primary commitment over, he and The Tear Garden released &quot;To Be an Angel Blind, the Crippled Soul Divide&quot; in 1996, followed by &quot;Crystal Mass&quot; in 2000. &quot;Crystal Mass&quot; marked a departure for the group, with more focus seemingly directed toward sound and production than the traditional staple, the lyrics. In 2002 a limited edition compilation of previously unreleased songs, &quot;Eye Spy with My Little Eye&quot; came out on Key&#x27;s Subconscious Communications label. A best of, &quot;For Those Who Would Walk with the Gods&quot; is also available.

The Tear Garden have never toured, which has limited their commercial potential. The only live performance of Tear Garden material by members of both Skinny Puppy and the Legendary Pink Dots was on April 14, 1988 in Leiden, Holland and May 1, 1988 at Foyer St. Arbogast in Strasbourg France, during Skinny Puppy&#x27;s Head Trauma tour, for which Edward Ka-Spel was the opening solo act. At the end of Ka-Spel&#x27;s set cEvin Key joined him on guitar and keyboards for a performance of the song &quot;The Centre Bullet&quot;. The Legendary Pink Dots have performed &quot;Isis Veiled&quot; as an almost necessary encore at every show during their last few tours.

In March 2008, after having successfully collaborated in 2007 on &quot;The Secret Experiment&quot;, cEvin Key made mention that Edward Ka-Spel was due to show up in Los Angeles sometime soon and that new material could possibly arise from any presumed meeting of the pair.

Early in 2017, it was announced that the group would celebrate their 30th anniversary with the release of a new album, &quot;The Brown Acid Caveat&quot;. The album would be accompanied with the release of the rarities collection album &quot;Eye Spy Vol.2&quot;.

<text>Nándor Steven Tánczos (, ; born 29 May 1966) is a New Zealand social ecologist, researcher, educator, activist and political commentator. He is currently a councillor in the Whakatāne District Council. He is also co-director of He Puna Manawa social and political change agency.

Tánczos was a member of the New Zealand Parliament from 1999 to 2008, and represented the Green Party as a list MP.

==Early life==
The younger of two sons, Tánczos was born in King George Hospital, London, and lived in Ilford, Hackney, and Clayhall prior to the family&#x27;s emigration to New Zealand after Christmas 1973.

Tánczos&#x27;s Hungarian-born father fled after the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; his South African-born mother is Cape Coloured and has Khoi, Dutch, and German ancestry.

The family returned to England, where Tánczos studied journalism at Darlington Polytech. While living in County Durham he got involved in supporting the 1984–85 Miners&#x27; Strike by collecting support funds. He later said, “That was the first time I’d ever seen the police used so explicitly as a political force. What I saw in Britain was the police used to destroy a movement.” He also got involved in the anti-nuclear and peace movements, and regularly visited Molesworth Peace Camp.

He attended the Stonehenge Free Festival in 1984 and joined the Peace Convoy the following year. He was at the Battle of the Beanfield and featured in the BBC 2 documentary about those events, &#x27;Trashed&#x27;. He returned to New Zealand in 1986.

Tánczos has a Permaculture Design Certificate, a Diploma in Sustainable Land Management from Carrington Polytech, a Bachelor of Social Sciences and a Post Graduate Diploma in Management and Sustainability from Waikato University and a certificate in Te Reo Māori me Ōna Tikanga from Te Whare Wananga o Aotearoa.

==Career==

First elected in 1999, Tánczos briefly lost his seat in the 2005 General Election, but returned to Parliament following the sudden death of Rod Donald just prior to the first sitting of Parliament, as he was next ranked on the party list. In 2006, he contested the male co-leadership of the Green Party, but was beaten by non-MP Russel Norman in a STV vote by delegates from electorates around the country at the 2006 AGM. In 2008, he resigned from Parliament, though he intended to remain a political activist.

Tánczos was the NZ Green Party spokesperson for the Environment and Sustainable Land Management, Justice, Information and Communication Technology, Constitutional issues, Treaty Issues and Commerce.

The New Zealand media portrayed Tánczos primarily as the voice advocating the liberalisation of the cannabis law in New Zealand, although he also actively campaigned against genetic engineering, and in favour of restorative justice. He also has a reputation as New Zealand&#x27;s first and only Rastafarian MP. His most significant legislative achievement, the Clean Slate Act, conceals non-violent criminal offences if the offender does not re-offend after seven years. His Misuse of Drugs (Hemp) amendment bill led the way for regulation changes to allow hemp growing in New Zealand. He introduced the Waste Minimisation Bill to parliament with a narrow majority but succeeded in building near unanimous support across parliament. Because of this and other activitie such as the Cross Party Accord on Justice that he convened, he built a reputation in Parliament of being able to work collaboratively across party lines. He negotiated the establishment of an Independent Prison Ombudsman, and has advocated for a Criminal Cases Review Office to look at miscarriages of justice, and against unsustainable dairy farming. In addition to his political policies, Tánczos also supports open source software, and uses the Ubuntu Linux-based operating system on his computer.

=== 1999 election ===

Tánczos first gained election to Parliament in the 1999 election, having held the fifth place on the Green Party&#x27;s list. His previous involvement with parliamentary politics had involved the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party. In the 2002 election, Tánczos occupied the fourth Green list place, and remained in Parliament. In the 1999, 2002 and 2005 elections, Tánczos also contested the Auckland Central electorate, winning 9.2%, 20.0% and 14.4% of the vote respectively.

=== 2005 election ===
In April 2005 the Green Party announced their list for the 2005 election. Tánczos ranked 7th, moving down 3 places from 2002.

As of election night (17 September) the Green Party polled 5.07% of the vote, qualifying them for 6 seats, which meant that Tánczos stood to lose his parliamentary seat. In both the 1999 and 2002 elections, the number of special votes for the Green party had sufficed to earn them an extra seat once the official count finished. The final total in 2005 (announced on 1 October) fell just short of the number required for a seventh seat, leaving Tánczos out of parliament.

However, on 6 November 2005, the Green Party co-leader Rod Donald died suddenly, a day before the new parliament met for the first time. This allowed Tánczos to return to Parliament as the next candidate on the Green list.

===Return to grassroots politics===
Following the death of Rod Donald, Tánczos stood for the leadership of the Green Party but was defeated by Russel Norman. On 17 January 2008 Tánczos announced he would not be standing in the 2008 election. It was initially not clear when he would resign his seat as he intended to see his member&#x27;s bill, the Waste Minimisation Bill, through Parliament. The bill was due back in the house in March 2008, after passing its first reading with Government support in 2006. He also wanted Russel Norman the Greens co-leader to enter Parliament in his place (because of the advantages in having the co-leader in Parliament in an election year); ex-MP Mike Ward, who was above Norman on the party list, initially declined to stand aside but changed his mind.

Tánczos left Parliament on 26 June 2008, giving a last speech. He commented that his opinions of parliamentarians had changed during his time as an MP, from initially seeing them as a bunch of &#x27;bastards&#x27; to recognising that &quot;there are many good people here. The very notion that all politicians are dishonest is misconceived.&quot; Expecting politicians to be dishonest and venal is letting them off the hook, he added. He said that he believed most MPs came to Parliament with honest intentions, but not many left with their honesty intact because of how the system itself compromises people. His main point was that in almost every country, governments of whatever flavour are so compromised by corporate agendas that they cannot do what is needed in the face of our environmental crisis. It will be up to people working in community to take control: &quot;When the people lead, the leaders will follow.&quot;

Tánczos ended by noting that he had bought a watch for the first time when he entered Parliament and had since been chained to time as a prison rather than an ally. He then took it off and smashed it, saying, &quot;When I look at the state of our rivers, our atmosphere and our communities, I don&#x27;t need a watch to know what time it is&quot;. In 2010, two years after he left politics, Tanczos cut off his dreadlocks as a part of a purification process following his departure from Parliament.

== Whakatāne District Council ==
Tanczos has been one of 5 councillors for the Whakatāne-Ōhope ward of Whakatāne District Council since 2016. He chairs the Strategy and Policy Committee. Excluding sewage emissions, the council has reduced its carbon footprint by 23%.

== Personal life ==
Tánczos co-founded Hempstore Aotearoa, a business that produces hemp-related products such as cosmetics and clothing.

A Rastafarian, Tánczos has attracted controversy for his admission that he uses cannabis, in accordance with Rastafari ritual. He is, however, a teetotaller. Tánczos has an official exemption from wearing a bike safety-helmet, granted on religious grounds by the New Zealand Police.

He lives in Whakatāne with his wife Ngahuia Murphy, who&#x27;s from Murupara, and their two children.

<doc id="589944" wikidata="Q962190" url="?curid=589944" title="Eadburh">
<text>Eadburh (), also spelled Eadburg, (fl. 787–802) was the daughter of King Offa of Mercia and Queen Cynethryth. She was the wife of King Beorhtric of Wessex, and according to Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life of Alfred the Great&quot; she killed her husband by poison while attempting to poison another. She fled to Francia, where she is said to have been offered the chance of marrying Charlemagne, but ruined the opportunity. Instead she was appointed as the abbess of a convent. Here she is said to have fornicated with an English exile. As a result, she was eventually expelled from the monastery and ended her days begging in the streets of Pavia.

==Family==
Eadburh was the daughter of King Offa and Queen Cynethryth. She was one of five children, four of them girls; they all witnessed a charter in 787.

==Queen==
Eadburh married Beorhtric, king of Wessex from 787 to 802, in 789. Offa was then the most powerful king in England, and Beorhtric gained his support as a result of the marriage. According to Asser, Eadburh became all powerful, and often demanded the executions or exile of her enemies. She was also alleged to have assassinated those men whom she couldn&#x27;t compel Beorhtric to kill through poisoning their food or drink. In 802, according to Asser, Eadburh attempted to poison a young favourite of the king but instead killed both of them. The young man may have been called Worr, as the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records the death of both men shortly before the succession of Egbert, the grandfather of Alfred the Great, as king of Wessex.

==Exile==

Eadburg subsequently fled to Francia and took refuge at the court of Charlemagne, where her husband&#x27;s successor, Egbert of Wessex, had taken refuge after being exiled by Beorhtric. There Asser relates that Charlemagne was smitten by the former queen. He brought in one of his sons and asked her which she preferred, him or his son, as a husband. She answered that, given the son&#x27;s youth, she preferred the son. Charlemagne replied famously: &quot;Had you chosen me, you would have had both of us. But, since you chose him, you shall have neither.&quot; He instead offered her a position as an abbess of a convent which she accepted.

Soon though she was caught in a sexual affair with another Saxon man and, after being duly convicted, was expelled on the direct orders of Charlemagne, penniless, into the streets. In her last years she lived as a beggar on the streets of Pavia.

==Aftermath and legacy==
Two possibly authentic charters of 801 show Eadburh as &quot;regina&quot; (queen), a title which was rarely used for king&#x27;s wives in Wessex in the ninth century. According to Asser this was because of the shame Eadburh had brought on the position. However, Offa and Beorhtric had driven Egbert into exile in the 780s, and the blackening of her name may also have been partly due to a desire to discredit Beorhtric.

Asser also writes that as a result of the aristocracy&#x27;s resentment of Eadburh the status and influence of the subsequent queens was diminished and they were titled not &#x27;queen&#x27; but &#x27;king&#x27;s wife&#x27;; the queen was also prohibited from sitting beside the king on the throne. This changed again when Charles the Bald insisted that his daughter Judith, who married King Æthelwulf, be properly crowned queen.

<text>USS &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; (AGC-2) was an &quot;Appalachian&quot;-class amphibious force flagship in the United States Navy. She was named for the southeasternmost ridge of the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia and North Carolina.

==Commissioning==
&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was built by the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Kearny, New Jersey, under a Maritime Commission contract. The ship was launched on 7 March 1943 under the sponsorship of Mrs. David Arnott. &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was transferred to the Navy on 15 March 1943. The Bethlehem Steel Company of Brooklyn, New York, outfitted the ship as an amphibious force flagship and was commissioned on 27 September 1943..

==Service history==

===1943-1944===
Following trial runs in Long Island Sound, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; departed New York on 8 October 1943, to train in the Chesapeake Bay Area out of Norfolk, Virginia. On 1 November, the ship put to sea with two destroyers, bound for the South Pacific. After transit of the Panama Canal, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; called at the Society, New Caledonia and Fiji Islands, en route to Brisbane, Australia, arriving on 16 December 1943. She pulled out of Brisbane three days later for Milne Bay, New Guinea where 24 December 1943, she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey, USN, Commander Seventh Amphibious Force. She served as the command ship for amphibious operations westward along the New Guinea Coast until 13 October 1944. On that day, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; left Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) as the flagship of Rear Admiral Barbey&#x27;s Northern Attack Force bound for the liberation of the Philippine Islands.
On the night of 19/20 October 1944 &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; and her formation stood through the swept part of Surigao Strait, between Homonhon and Dinagat Islands and entered San Pedro Bay, Leyte, Philippine Islands. She served as a command ship for troops storming the beaches at Leyte the morning of 20 October, and continued in support of the amphibious assault landings for six days. The ship&#x27;s gunners drove off an enemy reconnaissance plane 23 October. The morning of 25 October, a torpedo-bomber made a run along her port side, coming in from her port quarter, and was shot down by her forward 40 mm gunners. That afternoon, the ship fired on 11 enemy planes of various types attacking the transport area.

The morning of 26 October 1944, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; helped fight off five enemy bombers that attacked her formation. That afternoon she helped drive away three more enemy bombers. Several bombs fell in the vicinity during this action, but only one exploded close enough to shake the command ship. As she kept watch off the Leyte beaches, the three-pronged attack of the Japanese Fleet met disaster in the Battle of Surigao Strait, the Battle off Samar and the Battle off Cape Engaño. She stood out of San Pedro Bay in the night of 26 October 1944 to stage at ports of New Guinea in preparation for the liberation landings to be made at Lingayen. She remained the flagship of Vice Admiral Barbey who was designated commander of the San Fabian Attack Force 78. Besides Admiral Barbey and his staff, she embarked Major General Innis P. Swift, commanding the I Army Corps, and Major General Leonard F. Wing, commanding the 43rd Infantry Division, together with their personal staffs.

&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; led the San Fabian Attack Force from Aitape, New Guinea on 28 December 1944. An aerial snooper was driven off by gunfire on 2 January 1945 and covering escort carrier aircraft shot down a bomber twenty miles out from her formation the following day. The night of 4 January 1945 the command ship followed a covering group of cruisers and destroyers through Surigao Strait to enter the Mindanao Sea. On the afternoon of 5 January an enemy submarine fired on the covering group, ten miles ahead, and was forced to surface and rammed by destroyer . Enemy planes attacked the formation 7 January; two being shot down by pilots of the Combat Air Patrol, and three fell victims to combined anti-aircraft fire of the formation. That night four destroyers sank a Japanese destroyer eleven miles to the east of &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;. The command ship helped repel six enemy planes on 8 January 1945 and entered Lingayen Gulf before daybreak of 9 January. Troops stormed ashore that morning, some two hours after a single-engine enemy aircraft sneaked through cover of night, strafed to a point forward of the bow, barely missed the bridge, then overshot and dropped bombs about 500 yards off her port bow. The ship was not damaged and suffered no casualties. During the initial landings, three air attacks came close enough to be a threat to &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;, but veered off in the face of heavy anti-suicide swimmers and small fast suicide boats. To combat this threat, a patrol boat was kept circling &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; and all shipboard security patrols were strengthened.

===1945===
On 13 January 1945 Chief Storekeeper H. G. Williamson reported on board &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;. He was an escaped prisoner of war, having been captured by the Japanese on 18 January 1942, while attached to the Naval Air Station at Cavite. He had escaped on 15 March 1942 and had remained in hiding near San Fabian since then. Williamson was returned to duty at the Naval Base and &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; departed Lingayen Gulf on 15 January 1945. The ship continued to serve as Vice Admiral Barbey&#x27;s flagship at San Pedro Bay and Subic Bay until 8 June 1945. Two days later, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was underway for Saipan and then to Pearl Harbor when she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Jerauld Wright, Commander Amphibious Group Five on 30 June 1945. She hauled down his flag on 20 July and entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for alterations and repairs.

&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 8 September 1945 and reached Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 22 September. That afternoon, she hoisted the flag of Rear Admiral Ingolf N. Kiland, Commander Amphibious Group Seven. The ship got underway on 21 October to serve as a command ship at Tsingtao, China, arriving 24 October 1945. Rear Admiral Kiland shifted his flag to on 6 November 1945 and &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; became the flagship of Rear Admiral Albert G. Noble, Commander Amphibious Group One.

===1946-1947===
The ship departed Tsingtao for Jinsen, Korea on 13 December 1945, then returned off Taku Bar before proceeding to Shanghai, China. She arrived in the Woosung Anchorage of the Yangtze River on 22 December 1945, and served as station command ship for Naval Forces there until 24 February 1946, when the ship departed Shanghai for Hawaii. After a brief stay at Pearl Harbor, she was routed to the western seaboard, arriving at San Pedro, Los Angeles on 18 March 1946. The ship entered the Naval Shipyard at Terminal Island to prepare for participation in &quot;Operation Crossroads&quot;, the atomic bomb tests to be carried out at Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands.

&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; departed San Francisco on 12 June 1946, touching at Honolulu, Hawaii, en route to Kwajalein Atoll where she arrived 28 June 1946. Here the ship completed embarking general and flag officers of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps along with United Nations officials for transportation to Bikini Atoll to observe Atomic Bomb Tests. She hoisted the flag of Vice Admiral Harry W. Hill. The senior officer on board was Vice Admiral Edward L. Cochrane, Chief of the Bureau of Ships. Also on board were Vice Admiral George F. Hussey and Vice Admiral Alfred E. Montgomery.

The ship arrived at Bikini Atoll on 29 June 1946, serving as one of the command and observation ships off Bikini during the Atomic Bomb Test &quot;Able&quot; on 1 July. Thereafter, she called at Ponape and Truk in the Caroline Islands, then proceeded to Kwajalein where, on 23 July, &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; became the flagship of Rear Admiral C. C. Glover. The ship again served as observation flagship for the atomic bomb test of 24 July, hauled down Rear Admiral Glover&#x27;s flag on 27 July, and sailed for home on 30 July. She arrived at San Francisco inactivation overhaul in the Naval Shipyard at Terminal Island; she decommissioned on 14 March 1947.

The ship remained in reserve until 1 January 1960, when her name was struck from the Navy List. She was sold for scrapping 26 August 1960 to Zidell Exploration Incorporated, Portland, Oregon.

<text>Kurla (Pronunciation: ) is a suburb of East Mumbai, India. It is the headquarters of the Kurla taluka of Mumbai Suburban district. The neighbourhood is named after the eponymous East Indian village that it grew out of. It falls under Zone 5, Ward &#x27;L&#x27; of the Bombay Municipal Corporation. Its railway station, spelt as &quot;Coorla&quot; until 1890, is one of the busiest on the Mumbai suburban railway on the central and harbour railway lines of Mumbai as is the Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) for out-station passenger/express trains.

== History ==

Kurla gets its name from the East Indian village of Kurla, whose name, in turn, originated from &quot;Kurli&quot;, the local name for crab, as these were found in plenty in marshes in the vicinity of the village.
The village of Kurla came under Portuguese rule when the Treaty of Bassein (1534) was signed by Sultan Bahadur of Gujarat and the Kingdom of Portugal on 23 December 1534. In 1548, the village of Kurla and six other villages were given by the Governor of Portuguese India to Antonio Pessoa as a reward for his military services. Kurla remained under Portuguese rule until the British occupied Salsette Island in 1774. The island was formally ceded to the East India Company in the 1782 Treaty of Salbai.

In 1805, Kurla was connected to Sion on Bombay Island by the Sion Causeway. Coorla, as it was spelt during the British Raj until 1890, was a major station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway between Bombay and Thane, the first railway line in British India when it opened in 1853.

In 1808, Kurla, along with the villages of Mohili, Kolekalyan, Marol, Sahar, Asalphe, and Parjapur, were given by the British to a Parsi merchant of Bombay, Mr. Hormasji Bamanji Wadia in exchange for a piece of land near the Apollo pier gate in Bombay. His Son, Mr. Ardeshir Hormasji Wadia, after whom the A. H. Wadia Road was named, paid for them a yearly Quit-rent of £358 (Rs. 3587).

Kurla had two cotton mills, one of them, the Dharamsi Punjabhai, being the largest cotton spinning and weaving mill in the Bombay Presidency, with 92,094 spindles and 1280 looms. The other was the Kurla Spinning and Weaving Mill. Kurla village had a population of 9,715 at that time. About half of them worked in the mills, while the rest were fishermen, husbandmen (farmers) and salt-makers. The Holy Cross Church at Kurla, built during the Portuguese rule and rebuilt in 1848, is one of the oldest churches in Mumbai.

The Mithibai Hormasji Wadia Dispensary was built by Mr. Bamanji Hormasji Wadia in 1855, and endowed by him with £1200 (Rs. 12,000). It was in charge of an assistant surgeon, and, in 1880–81, had an attendance of 7367 out-patients. The salt pans covered an area of about and yielded a yearly revenue of £3418 (Rs. 34,180). There was also a considerable manufacture of shell lime. The Stone quarries of Kurla were well known and supplied material for the construction of most of the city&#x27;s famous heritage buildings like the Prince of Wales Museum, and the General Post Office among others.

The beginning of the twentieth century saw Kurla develop as an important centre of the mill industry. In 1910, there were reported to be several mills in Kurla, engaged in the manufacturing of cotton cloth and woollen cloth in steam factories. Kurla, however, was an old textile industrial core, an outlier to the main cotton mill zone. A relatively cheaper land value and nearness to water and power mains enabled rapid industrial expansion of the suburbs and the Kurla-Ghatkopar–Vikhroli–Bhandup belt soon developed into the largest industrial zone in the suburbs of Mumbai.

The Central Railway began its Harbour Line services from Kurla to Reay Road station on 12 December 1910. This service was extended to Victoria Terminus in 1925. The Kurla Railway Car-shed was constructed in 1925 when electrification of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR) Harbour line was undertaken. The first electric train in Asia that ran between CST and Coorla on 3 February 1925 was maintained at this car shed. The Salsette–Trombay Railway, also known as the Central Salsette Tramway, opened in 1928. The 13-kilometre line, a project of the Bombay Improvement Trust run by the GIPR, ran from Trombay to Andheri via Kurla and lasted only a few years.

Premier Automobiles Limited built their first automobile assembly plant in Kurla in 1946 and began production in March 1947, collaborating with American automobile manufacturer Chrysler to manufacture Dodge, Plymouth and Desoto models in India. The iconic Premier Padmini car was also built at Kurla from 1964 until the plant closed down in 1997.
This resulted in the development of the old Kurla neighbourhood into an automobile industrial zone during the late fifties and sixties.

The Bombay Taximen Union began building the Taximens Colony close to the Mithi river in Kurla in 1969. It was inaugurated by union leader George Fernandes in 1972. The Bombay Taximens Cooperative housing society is Mumbai&#x27;s second largest housing society.

The Dairy Development Department of the State Government, in order to cope-up with the increasing demand for milk, established a dairy at Nehru nagar, Kurla (East) in 1975.

A metro station for Kurla Terminus was originally proposed for Metro 2B but was cancelled in September 2020 because it was in the path of the restricted funnel zone for Mumbai Airport. Further, the proposed SG Barve Marg station was only 474 metres away from the proposed Kurla Terminus station. Another issue was that the Kurla Terminus station would have been located in between the Santa Cruz–Chembur Link Road (SCLR) rail overbridge and another permanent structure.

<text>An upper gastrointestinal series, also called a barium swallow, barium study, or barium meal, is a series of radiographs used to examine the gastrointestinal tract for abnormalities. A contrast medium, usually a radiocontrast agent such as barium sulfate mixed with water, is ingested or instilled into the gastrointestinal tract, and X-rays are used to create radiographs of the regions of interest. The barium enhances the visibility of the relevant parts of the gastrointestinal tract by coating the inside wall of the tract and appearing white on the film. This in combination with other plain radiographs allows for the imaging of parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as the pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine such that the inside wall lining, size, shape, contour, and patency are visible to the examiner. With fluoroscopy, it is also possible to visualize the functional movement of examined organs such as swallowing, peristalsis, or sphincter closure. Depending on the organs to be examined, barium radiographs can be classified into &quot;barium swallow&quot;, &quot;barium meal&quot;, &quot;barium follow-through&quot;, and &quot;enteroclysis&quot; (&quot;small bowel enema&quot;). To further enhance the quality of images, air or gas is sometimes introduced into the gastrointestinal tract in addition to barium, and this procedure is called double-contrast imaging. In this case the gas is referred to as the negative contrast medium. Traditionally the images produced with barium contrast are made with plain-film radiography, but computed tomography is also used in combination with barium contrast, in which case the procedure is called &quot;CT enterography&quot;.

==Types==

Various types of barium X-ray examinations are used to examine different parts of the gastrointestinal tract. These include barium swallow, barium meal, barium follow-through, and barium enema. The barium swallow, barium meal, and barium follow-through are together also called an upper gastrointestinal series (or study), whereas the barium enema is called a lower gastrointestinal series (or study). In upper gastrointestinal series examinations, the barium sulfate is mixed with water and swallowed orally, whereas in the lower gastrointestinal series (barium enema), the barium contrast agent is administered as an enema through a small tube inserted into the rectum.
* Barium swallow X-ray examinations are used to study the pharynx and esophagus.
* Barium meal examinations are used to study the lower esophagus, stomach and duodenum.
* Barium follow-through examinations are used to study the small intestine.
* Enteroclysis, also called small bowel enema, is a barium X-ray examination used to display individual loops of the small intestine by intubating the jejunum and administering barium sulfate followed by methylcellulose or air.
* Barium enema examinations are used to study the large intestine and rectum and are classified as &quot;lower gastrointestinal series&quot;.

== Medical uses ==
Barium X-ray examinations are useful tools for the study of appearance and function of the parts of the gastrointestinal tract. They are used to diagnose and monitor esophageal reflux, dysphagia, hiatus hernia, strictures, diverticula, pyloric stenosis, gastritis, enteritis, volvulus, varices, ulcers, tumors, and gastrointestinal dysmotility, as well as to detect foreign bodies. Although barium X-ray examinations are increasingly being replaced by more modern techniques, such as computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, endoscopy and capsule endoscopy, barium contrast imaging remains in common use because it offers the advantages of greater affordability, wider availability, and better resolution in assessing superficial mucosal lesions.

== Mechanism ==
Barium sulfate is swallowed and is a radio opaque substance that does not allow the passage of X-rays. As a result, areas coated by barium sulfate will appear white on an X-ray film. The passage of barium sulfate through the gastrointestinal tract is observed by a radiologist using a fluoroscope attached to a TV monitor. The radiologist takes a series of individual X-ray images at timed intervals depending on the areas to be studied. Sometimes medication which produces gas in the gastrointestinal tract is administered together with the Barium sulfate. This gas distends the gastrointestinal lumen, providing better imaging conditions and in this case the procedure is called double-contrast imaging.

== Procedure ==
Clinical status and relevant medical history are reviewed prior to the studies. Patient consent is required.

=== Barium swallow ===
A barium swallow study is also known as a barium esophagram and needs little if any preparations for the study of the larynx, pharynx, and esophagus when studied alone.

Amongst the uses of barium swallow are: persistent dysphagia and odynophagia despite negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGDS) findings, failed OGDS, esophageal motility disorder, globus pharyngis, assessment of tracheoesophageal fistula, and timed barium swallow to monitor the progress of esophageal achalasia therapy. Barium sulfate suspension such as 100 ml or more of E-Z HD 200 to 250% concentration and Baritop 100% can be used. Water-soluble contrast agent such as Gastrografin (diatrizoate) and Conray (Iotalamic acid) is used instead of barium if oesophageal perforation is suspected. Low osmolar contrast medium with concentration of 300 mg/ml is used instead of gastrografin if there is risk of aspiration or there is tracheoesophageal fistula.

A thick barium mixture is swallowed in supine position and fluoroscopic images of the swallowing process are made. Then several swallows of a thin barium mixture are taken and the passage is recorded by fluoroscopy and standard radiographs. The procedure is repeated several times with the examination table tilted at various angles. A total of 350–450 mL of barium is swallowed during the process. Normally, 90% of ingested fluid should have passed into the stomach after 15 seconds.

Right anterior oblique (RAO) view is to see the oesophagus clearly, away from overlapping spine. AP (anterior-posterior) view is also done to visualise the gastroesophageal junction. AP and lateral views are also done to visualise the hypopharynx during swallowing at a frame rate of 3–4 per second. Left posterior oblique (LPO) position is used to identify hernias, mucosal rings, and varices.

===Barium meal===
Intravenous injection of Buscopan (Hyoscine butylbromide) 20 mg or glucagon 0.3 mg is used to distend the stomach and slow down the emptying of the contrast into the duodenum.

Right anterior oblique (RAO) view is used to demonstrate antrum and greater curve of stomach. Supine position is to demonstrate antrum and body of stomach. Left anterior oblique (LAO) view is used to see the lesser curve of stomach en face. This position is also used to check for gastroesophageal reflux when patient is asked to cough or swallow (water siphon test). Left lateral tilted with head up 45 degrees is used to demonstrate the fundus of the stomach. To demonstrate the duodenal loop, the subject can lie down in prone position on a compression pad to prevent excessive barium flowing into the duodenal loop. Anterior view of duodenal loop can be seen at RAO position. Duodenal cap can be visualised by taking images when subject lie down in prone position, RAO, supine, and then LAO positions or it can be seen on erect position with RAO and steep LAO views. Total mucosal coating of the stomach is done by asking the subject to roll to the right side into a complete circle until RAO position. Arae gastriae in the antrum (fine reticular network of grooves) is visible if good coating is achieved.

=== Small bowel follow-through ===
Indications to do this procedure are: unexplained chronic abdominal pain with weight loss, unexplained diarrhea, anemia which is caused by gastrointestinal bleeding or dependent on blood transfusion where the cause cannot be explained despite OGDS or colonoscopy investigations, partial obstruction of bowel/small bowel adhesive obstruction suspected, and unexplained malabsorption of nutrients. For barium follow-through examinations, a 6-hour period of fasting is observed prior to the study.

Barium is administered orally, sometimes mixed with diatrizoic acid (gastrografin) to reduce transit time in the bowel. Intravenous metoclopramide is sometimes also added to the mixture to enhance gastric emptying. 600 ml of 0.5% methylcellulose can be given orally, after barium meal is given, to improve the images of small bowel follow-through by reducing the time taken for barium to pass through the small intestines, and increase the transparency of the contrast-filled small bowels. Other methods to reduce transit time are to add ice cold normal saline after the administration of barium saline mixture or to give a dry meal.

X-ray images are then taken in a supine position at intervals of 20–30 minutes. Real-time fluoroscopy is used to assess bowel motility. The radiologist may press or palpate the abdomen during images to separate intestinal loops. The total time necessary for the test depends on the speed of bowel motility or transit time and may vary between 1 and 3 hours.

=== Enteroclysis ===
Enteroclysis is also known as small bowel enema. It has been largely replaced by magnetic resonance enterography/enteroclysis and computed tomography enterography/enteroclysis.

In addition to fasting for 8 hours prior to examination, a laxative may also be necessary for bowel preparation and cleansing. The main aim of this study is to distend the proximal bowel through infusion of large amount of barium suspension. Otherwise, the distension of distal small bowel is generally similar with small bowel follow-through. Therefore, there is a need to pass a tube through the nose into the jejunum (nasojejunal tube) to administer large amount of contrast. This can be unpleasant to the subject, requires more staff, longer procedural time, and higher radiation dose when compared to small bowel follow-through. The indications for enteroclysis are generally similar to small bowel follow-through. Barium suspensions such as diluted E-Z Paque 70% and Baritop 100% can be used. After that, 600 ml of 0.5% methylcellulose is administered after 500 ml of 70% barium suspension is given. Bilbao-Dotter tube and Silk tube can be used to administer barium suspension. The subject should be fasted overnight, any antispasmodic drugs should be stopped one day before the examination, and Tetracaine lozenges can be used 30 minutes before the procedure to numb the throat for nasojejunal tube insertion.

The filling of the small intestines can be viewed continuously using fluoroscopy, or viewed as standard radiographs taken at frequent intervals. The technique is a double-contrast procedure that allows detailed imaging of the entire small intestine. However, the procedure may take 6 hours or longer to complete and is quite uncomfortable to undergo.

== Interpretation of results ==

* Enteroclysis has shown to be very accurate in diagnosing small bowel diseases, with a sensitivity of 93.1% and specificity of 96.9%. It permits detection of lesion which may not be seen with other imaging techniques. There is no significant difference in terms of detection of clinically significant findings, sensitivity or specificity between enteroclysis and CT enterography. Enteroclysis compares favorably with wireless capsule endoscopy and double-balloon endoscopy in the diagnosis of mucosal abnormalities of the small bowel.
* The interpretation of standard barium swallow examinations for assessing dysphagia is operator and interpreter dependent. It has poor sensitivity for subtle abnormalities but is more sensitive in detecting esophageal webs and rings than gastroscopy. The best initial evaluation of suspected oropharyngeal dysphagia is a barium study. Barium swallow studies remain the main investigation of dysphagia. Barium studies may detect pharyngeal tumors that are difficult to visualize endoscopically.
* Barium follow-through examinations are the most commonly used imaging technique in assessing patients with Crohn&#x27;s disease, although CT and magnetic resonance imaging are widely accepted as being superior. However Barium examinations remain superior in the depiction of mucosal abnormalities. The features of Crohn&#x27;s disease are well described by barium follow-through examinations, appearing as a typical &quot;cobblestone pattern&quot;, but no information is obtained regarding extraluminal disease. Radiographic imaging in Crohn&#x27;s disease provides clinicians with objective evaluations of small bowel regions that are not accessible to standard endoscopic techniques. Because of its length and complex loops, the small intestine is the most difficult part of the gastrointestinal tract to evaluate. Most endoscopic techniques are limited to the examination of proximal or distal segments, hence Barium follow-through remains in most centres the test of choice for the investigation of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and in particular diseases manifesting mucosal abnormalities such as coeliac and Crohn&#x27;s disease. 
* Barium swallow studies are better than endoscopy at demonstrating the anatomic findings in gastroesophageal reflux disease after anti-reflux surgery.
* Barium fluoroscopic examinations have some advantages over computed tomography and magnetic resonance techniques, such as higher spatial resolution and the ability to examine bowel peristalsis and distension in real time.
* Many infections and parasitic infestations produce patterns of the luminal surface, which are best seen on Barium examinations. Certain parasites are seen as filling defects outlined by Barium and Barium examinations play an important role in the diagnosis of intestinal infections and infestations as compared to other techniques. Barium studies show tapeworms and roundworms as thin, linear filling defects of the bowel. Because roundworms have a developed alimentary tract, barium may outline the parasites&#x27; intestinal tracts on delayed images. In Strongyloidiasis barium studies show intestinal wall oedema, thickening of intestinal folds with flattening, and atrophy of the overlying mucosa. Schistosomiasis caused by infection with flatworms have an appearance resembling colitis ulcerosa, with inflammatory polyps, ulcers, fibrosis, wall thickening, loss of haustration, and stenosis in Barium X-rays. Anisakiasis is demonstrated by Barium X-rays as bowel wall oedema, thickening, ulceration, or stricture due to inflammation. Sometimes worms are seen as long, thread-like, linear filling defects up to 30 cm long. In Typhlitis Barium studies show oedema, ulceration, and inflammation of bowel wall resulting in wall thickening. In pseudomembranous colitis, barium studies show pancolitis with thumb printing and shaggy margins as well as plaque-like eccentric, nodular or polypoid appearance.
* Barium studies and computer tomography are the most common tools used to diagnose gastrointestinal lymphoma. Barium contrast is more sensitive in the demonstration of subtle mucosa and sub-mucosa abnormalities but computer tomography is the method of choice for determining the extent of disease and staging as well as related complications such as fistulation and perforation. Submucosal nodules or masses form a bull&#x27;s-eye or target appearance on barium studies.

== Adverse effects ==

* Radiographic examinations involve radiation exposure in the form of X-rays.
* Although barium ions are toxic, their use is generally regarded as safe because the small amounts of barium ions available in solution and absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract are deemed to be negligible; however, isolated cases of barium encephalopathy have been described following absorption of barium from the intestinal tract.
* Constipation and abdominal pain may occur after barium meals.
* The formation of baroliths, which may need to be removed surgically, is a complication of the use of barium sulfate.
* Barium sulfate may cause serious peritoneal irritation.
* Leakage of barium sulfate into the abdominal cavity may occur in people with duodenal ulcers or other perforations and may lead to peritonitis, adhesion, and granulomas; it is associated with a high mortality rate. Leakage of barium into the mediastinum or peritoneal cavity may lead to endotoxic shock, which is often fatal; as a result, the use of barium as a contrast agent is contraindicated when there is a suspicion or possibility of compromise of bowel wall integrity.
* Aspiration or inhalation of barium sulfate into the lungs during oral application can lead to serious respiratory complications leading to fatal aspiration pneumonia or asphyxiation.
* Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions are rare but some additives contained in barium preparations may induce immune reactions.

Complete gastrointestinal obstruction is a contraindication for barium studies.

== History ==
Barium sulfate as a contrast medium was evolved from the prior use of bismuth preparations which were too toxic. The use of bismuth preparations had been described as early as 1898. Barium sulfate as a contrast medium in medical practice was introduced largely as a result of the works of Krause a director of the Bonn Polyclinic, now the medical faculty of the University of Bonn and his colleagues Bachem and Gunther. In a paper read in 1910 at the radiological congress they advocated for the use of barium sulfate as an opaque contrast medium in medicine.

<text>The Cobb County Public Library System (CCPLS) is a system of 15 public libraries in Cobb County, Georgia, United States, excluding its second-largest city of Smyrna, which runs its own Smyrna Public Library. CobbCat.org is the online database of all CCPLS holdings.

The CCPLS uses an interlibrary loan system among all 15 branches, and allows for loan requests from other counties and areas through WorldCat. Those with a valid library card in the Cobb Country Library system can reserve materials online and pick them up in their local library. Books may be returned at any library in the system.

==History==
===Initial libraries===
Cobb County&#x27;s first library was the Marietta Young Men&#x27;s Debating and Library Association, which debuted in 1874. For eight years this was the sole library of the county, until the opening of the Franklin Lending Library in 1882. With two libraries now present in the county the Marietta Library Association was founded in 1883. The first library building opened on Church Street, Marietta, and was named the Sarah Freeman Clarke Library in honor of the woman who housed the initial Franklin Lending Library collection in her home. Following the opening of the Marietta Library Association, Acworth opened its first library, the Carrie Dyer Reading Club, in 1889. Austell opened its first library through the Austell Woman&#x27;s Club near the end of the 1920s, and the Smyrna Public Library was founded in this decade as well.

===Cobb County-Marietta Public Library Board===
In 1948 the Cobb County Board of Education established the Cobb County Library, taking advantage of state matching funds in order to secure monies for books to support a future county library system. During this time, and into the early 1950s, J. Dennis Kemp became concerned about the lack of library resources in unincorporated areas of Cobb County, and went to the county commissioner to see if library outreach could be afforded to these communities. A county-appointed study committee created in 1956 began to explore the possibilities of joining the Cobb County library collection with the existing Clarke Library. The next year the committee finalized a merger, creating the Cobb County-Marietta Public Library Board, and two years later in 1959 they combined and brought the Clarke and Fort Hill libraries to the system. Prior to this acquisition the Fort Hill branch was, for many decades, the only library black people could utilize. At its inception this county library system consisted of 25,000 books with a budget of $10,500 split into thirds by the city school system, county school system, and the county government.

With the library outreach committee continuing to explore areas of Cobb County to branch into, plans were made to grow the library system. In the late 1950s the Clarke Library moved to a larger building, the old U.S. Post Office, and had two bookmobiles serving the more rural regions. Seeing the success of the library system, the library board decided to construct branch libraries in growing towns with sufficient population densities. Thus, an onslaught of new libraries joined the system.

===Rapid growth for the system===
In 1961 two branches in East Marietta and Powder Springs were added, and in 1962 South Cobb&#x27;s previously private branch joined the system alongside the Oakdale (now Lewis A. Ray) Branch. In 1963 the Acworth Library joined, a new branch was established in Kennesaw, and Central Library moved into the building previously occupied by the old Marietta Post Office (currently the Marietta/Cobb Museum of Art). In 1964 and 1965 the Gritters and Sweetwater Valley branches respectively joined the system.

With a rapidly growing number of branches, a 1965 voters&#x27; referendum authorized $985,000 of library bonds to be divided into library construction, land purchases, books, supplies, and equipment for the system. Due to this bond, from 1966 to 1969 seven new libraries were added: Kennesaw, East Marietta, Acworth, South Cobb, Sibley, Lewis A. Ray, and Powder Springs. All seven opened on the same day in 1967, and were met with public approval.

With such a large number of libraries representing much more than just Marietta, the system changed its name to the present-day Cobb County Public Library System in 1969. The Stratton branch was added in 1974, and the Merchant&#x27;s Walk branch was added in 1979. In 1978 taxpayers overwhelmingly approved a $7.16 million library issue to renovate and expand the Switzer (then Central) library to 64,000 square feet, and construct the Kemp Memorial Library, Mountain View Library, and Vinings Library. The money was also used to renovate the Kennesaw and Powder Springs branches. By the early 1980s the system had grown to fourteen libraries with an annual budget of $1.5 million and passed one million materials circulated annually. The Fort Hill library was rededicated as the Hattie G. Wilson library in memory of the late librarian&#x27;s 33 years of service. The final two libraries added to the sixteen-branch system were the Mountain View and Vinings libraries, constructed in 1989 and 1990 respectively.

During the 1990s the population of Cobb County began to grow rapidly. The speed of the system&#x27;s growth was unable to meet the needs of the growing population, and the amount of books in the collection dropped below one book per citizen. In July 1991 the Friends of the Library and the CCPLS urged the passage of a new $7.06 million bond referendum in order to provide enough books to meet the success of neighboring library systems. Ultimately this bond referendum did not pass by 814 out of 60,000 votes.

===Modern years===
The Cobb County Library System has continued to see growth into the 21st century. In 2002 a library in West Cobb opened, and in 2005 the South Cobb Regional Library opened. In 2007 a new building was secured in Powder Springs, and their town library moved to its new location on Atlanta Road.

In 2010 the East Cobb Library replaced the previously built Merchant&#x27;s Walk Library and doubled the amount of floor space for books and technological improvements. While interest in libraries in this area of Cobb County was high, the Hattie G. Wilson (formerly Fort Hill) library began to show signs of disuse. Citing a 50% loss of circulation, the Wilson Library was unanimously voted to shut down in 2013.

Another renovation was approved in 2016 when the East Marietta Library was chosen for a new location and new building. This new facility, the Sewell Mill Library and Cultural Center, opened on December 4, 2017 at a cost of $10.6 million. It was built in conjunction with the Cobb County Parks Department, and, in addition to a large collection of books, also has a black box theater, open-air amphitheater, art galleries and classrooms, and many individual and group conference rooms.

In 2023, Cobb County Public Library was selected as the Georgia Library of the Year.

<doc id="589955" wikidata="Q371310" url="?curid=589955" title="Bone Machine">
<text>Bone Machine is the eleventh studio album by American singer and musician Tom Waits, released by Island Records on September 8, 1992. It won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and features guest appearances by David Hidalgo, Les Claypool, Brain, and Keith Richards. The album marked Waits&#x27; return to studio albums, coming five years after &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot; (1987).

Recorded in a room in the cellar area of Prairie Sun Recording studios, described by Waits as &quot;just a cement floor and a hot water heater&quot;, the album is often noted for its rough, stripped-down, percussion-heavy style, as well as its dark lyrical themes revolving around death and decay. The album covera blurry, black-and-white, close-up image of Waits screaming while wearing a horned skullcap and protective goggleswas taken by filmmaker Jesse Dylan, son of Bob Dylan. The photo is taken from a freeze frame of the Dylan and Jim Jarmusch directed video for &quot;Goin&#x27; Out West&quot;. They also directed a video for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Grow Up&quot;. The latter song was covered by the Ramones on their last album, &quot;!Adios Amigos!&quot; (1995); the former featured in the movie &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999). &quot;Bone Machine&quot; won the Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album.

==Recording and production==
&quot;Bone Machine&quot; was recorded and produced entirely at the Prairie Sun Recording studios in Cotati, California, in a room of Studio C known as &quot;the Waits Room&quot;, located in the old cement hatchery rooms of the cellar of the buildings. Prairie Sun&#x27;s studio head Mark &quot;Mooka&quot; Rennick said, &quot;[Waits] gravitated toward these &#x27;echo&#x27; rooms and created the &quot;Bone Machine&quot; aural landscape. [...] What we like about Tom is that he is a musicologist. And he has a tremendous ear. His talent is a national treasure.&quot;

Waits said of the bare-bones studio, &quot;I found a great room to work in, it&#x27;s just a cement floor and a hot water heater. Okay, we&#x27;ll do it here. It&#x27;s got some good echo.&quot; References to the recording environment and process were made in the field-recorded interview segments made for the promotional CD release, &quot;Bone Machine: The Operator&#x27;s Manual&quot;, which threaded together full studio tracks and conversation for a pre-recorded radio show format.

&quot;Bone Machine&quot; was the first Waits album on which he played drums and percussion extensively. In 1992, Waits stated: &quot;I like to play drums when I&#x27;m angry. At home I have a metal instrument called a conundrum with a lot of things hanging off it that I&#x27;ve found - metal objects - and I like playing it with a hammer. I love it. Drumming is therapeutic. I wish I&#x27;d found it when I was younger.&quot;

==Critical reception==
In a rave review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Chris Willman wrote that &quot;Waits waxes equally fatalistic on morality and mortality&quot; on &quot;Bone Machine&quot;, and that even &quot;amid all this casual morbidity&quot;, the album&#x27;s &quot;low-fi, home-studio&quot; sounds make the album &quot;so much—in a manner of speaking—fun.&quot; &quot;Rhythmically,&quot; said Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s the most varied and impressive group of songs Waits has written, and damaged voice and all, the tunes are unshakable.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Billy Altman noted that although listeners may find themselves &quot;shocked, thrilled, or just plain unnerved by some startling image or sound&quot; while listening to &quot;Bone Machine&quot;, &quot;beneath his hellacious bellows... and grotesque arrangements... lurks a caring, humanist heart.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; writer Terry Staunton summarized the album as &quot;scary, mournful, morbid and easily one of Tom&#x27;s best.&quot;

Retrospectively, AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey deemed &quot;Bone Machine&quot; &quot;Waits&#x27; most affecting and powerful recording, even if it isn&#x27;t his most accessible&quot;, noting the album&#x27;s &quot;chilling, primal sound&quot; and fixation with &quot;decay and mortality, the ease with which earthly existence can be destroyed.&quot;

<text>The first USS &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; (ID-2432) was a steamship in the United States Navy. The ship was named for the Blue Ridge Mountains.

==Service history==

===In commercial service, 1891–1918===
&quot;Blue Ridge&quot; was originally constructed as the Great Lakes passenger steamer &quot;Virginia&quot; built by Globe Iron Works at Cleveland, Ohio. The ship was launched in 1891 and was operated by the Goodrich Transit Company between Chicago, Illinois and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

In 1893, during the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, the ship and the whaleback steamer competed against each other in races.

===In US Navy service, 1918–1919===
&quot;Virginia&quot; was purchased on 19 April 1918 for use as a Navy transport at Manitowoc, Wisconsin once America entered World War I. The ship was renamed &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; (ID-2432) and commissioned on 17 October 1918.

On 28 December 1918, the ship arrived at the Boston Navy Yard from the Great Lakes. While undergoing repairs, the war ended and eliminated the need for further service. While still at the Navy Yard, the ship&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Avalon&quot; on 18 August 1919.
===&quot;Avalon&quot; — return to commercial service, 1919–1951===
The Edward P. Farley Company of Chicago bought the ship on 21 August 1919.

In 1920 The Wilmington Transportation Company of Los Angeles acquired the ship and renamed it the Avalon. The ship entered the company&#x27;s two-hour daytime Catalina–Los Angeles run &quot;between the Catalina Island Terminal in Wilmington and Avalon on Santa Catalina Island. Los Angeles harbor.&quot;

During World War II, &quot;Avalon&quot; served as a transport in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The ship returned to the Catalina–Los Angeles run in 1946 and remained in this service until laid up at the Catalina Island Terminal on 12 February 1951. Most of the equipment and superstructure were removed.

While being scrapped, the &quot;Avalon&quot; caught fire and burned at Long Beach, California on 18 July 1960. The hulk was towed to Redondo, fitted with a crane and used as a barge. After salvaging parts from the Dominator wreck, the Avalon sank in a storm on 16 September 1964

<doc id="589960" wikidata="Q434512" url="?curid=589960" title="Crystal Gayle">
<text>Brenda Gail Webb (born January 9, 1951), known professionally as Crystal Gayle, is an American country music singer widely known for her 1977 hit &quot;Don&#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot;. Initially, Gayle&#x27;s management and record label were the same as that of her oldest sister, Loretta Lynn. Not finding success with the arrangement after several years, and with Lynn&#x27;s encouragement, Gayle decided to try a different approach. She signed a new record contract and began recording with Nashville producer Allen Reynolds. Gayle&#x27;s new sound was sometimes referred to as middle-of-the-road (MOR) or country pop, and was part of a bigger musical trend by many country artists of the 1970s to appeal to a wider audience. Subsequently, Gayle became one of the most successful crossover artists of the 1970s and 80s. She is known for her floor-length hair.

Gayle was said to have begun her career in the 1960s performing as a background singer in Lynn&#x27;s band (although Gayle says this actually never happened). Lynn helped her sign a recording contract with Decca Records in 1970. Having minor success, she was encouraged to develop her own musical identity. Under the direction of producer Reynolds at United Artists Records, Gayle shifted towards a country pop style that was more successful. In 1975, &quot;Wrong Road Again&quot; became Gayle&#x27;s first major hit. However, it was in 1977 when Gayle achieved her biggest success with &quot;Don&#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot;. The single topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart, crossed over to the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became a major international hit.

Gayle continued having success from the late 1970s and through late 1980s. Her biggest hits included &quot;Ready for the Times to Get Better&quot; (1977), &quot;Talking in Your Sleep&quot; (1978), &quot;Half the Way&quot; (1979) and &quot;You and I&quot; (1982). In the 1990s, Gayle shifted artistic directions by recording various genres of music. This included an album of inspirational music titled &quot;Someday&quot; (1995) and an album of standards called &quot;Crystal Gayle Sings the Heart and Soul of Hoagy Carmichael&quot; (1999). During the decade she also owned and operated a fine arts shop called Crystal&#x27;s Fine Gifts and Jewelry. Her most recent studio release was in 2019 and Gayle has since continued to tour throughout the world.

Gayle has won one Grammy Award and has been nominated for several others since the 1970s. She has also won five Academy of Country Music awards; those awards include receiving the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award in 2016. In addition, she has won two Country Music Association awards and three American Music Awards. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked her among the 100 greatest country artists of all time and CMT ranked her within their list of the 40 greatest women of country music. Gayle has her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was inducted as a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 2017.

==Early life==

Gayle was born Brenda Gail Webb in Paintsville, Kentucky on January 9, 1951. She was the last of eight children born to Clara Marie &quot;Clary&quot; (née Ramey; May 5, 1912 – November 24, 1981) and Melvin Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Webb (June 6, 1906 – February 22, 1959). Unlike her sister Loretta and her other siblings, Gayle was the only child born at the Paintsville hospital, and not at home. Through her matriline, Gayle is a distant cousin of singer Patty Loveless. Gayle and her siblings claim Irish and Cherokee descent, although she is not enrolled with any Native tribe. Gayle&#x27;s father was a coal miner who developed black lung disease. In search of better medical treatment, the family moved to Wabash, Indiana, when Gayle was four years old. They lived in a retired miner&#x27;s community and Clara Webb worked as a nurse&#x27;s aide. Ted Webb died from a stroke in 1959. From an early age, Gayle had an interest in singing. She noted that she could sing before she could walk. The family&#x27;s new home in Wabash was in an urban setting. She was exposed to diverse cultural groups and norms and in turn to various styles of music. She sang along frequently to songs she heard on the radio and was inspired by the music of her sister Loretta Lynn.

Gayle&#x27;s musical interests were shaped further in her teenage years. She started singing in church, performed folk songs, and recorded demonstration tapes. With encouragement from Lynn, she began touring during summers in high school. At age 16, Gayle performed on the Grand Ole Opry in replacement of her sister who had gotten ill. She performed a cover of Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;Ribbon of Darkness&quot;. After graduating from high school in 1970, she signed her first recording contract with her sister&#x27;s label: Decca Records. Upon signing with Decca, the label insisted that Gayle change her first name from &quot;Brenda&quot; to another name. The conflict was because Brenda Lee was already signed to Decca at the time. Shortly thereafter, Lynn drove past a sign for the Krystal fast-food restaurant and said to Gayle, &quot;That&#x27;s your name. Crystals are bright and shiny, like you.&quot; It was then that she changed her name professionally to &quot;Crystal Gayle&quot;, with &quot;Gayle&quot; taken from her middle name (Gail).

==Career==
===1969–1976: Decca Records and musical shifts===
Gayle was first managed by Oliver Lynn (Loretta Lynn&#x27;s husband) after signing with Decca Records. Among her first professional gigs were routine appearances on Jim Ed Brown&#x27;s television show &quot;The Country Palace&quot;. On the program, Gayle performed original songs written by Loretta Lynn including &quot;Sparklin&#x27; Look of Love&quot; and &quot;Mama, It&#x27;s Different This Time&quot;. Her debut single was released in 1970 titled &quot;I&#x27;ve Cried (The Blue Right Out of My Eyes)&quot;. Also written by Lynn, the song peaked within the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; [[Hot Country Singles]] chart. The song was followed by other singles that reached minor positions on the country songs chart: &quot;Everybody Oughta Cry&quot; (1972) and &quot;I Hope You&#x27;re Havin&#x27; Better Luck Than Me&quot; (1972). Gayle&#x27;s career stalled while at the Decca label. This was because the label wanted Gayle to record in the same style as her sister. Steve Huey of [[AllMusic]] criticized her early singles, calling them &quot;little Loretta records&quot;. Writers Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann noted that Gayle was &quot;probably stigmatized&quot; for being the sibling of Loretta Lynn. In a 2019 interview with &quot;[[Forbes]]&quot;, Gayle reflected on the experience, &quot;It didn&#x27;t take me long to realize I was only there because I was Loretta&#x27;s sister.&quot; During this period, Lynn gave Gayle advice that prompted her to expand her musical styles. Lynn said, &quot;quit singing my songs...We have one Loretta Lynn and we don&#x27;t need another.&quot; The conversation led Gayle to ultimately leave Decca in 1974.
Gayle signed a new recording contract with [[United Artists Records]] in 1974. Under the direction of producer [[Allen Reynolds]], her musical style shifted. Reynolds (who had recent success producing [[Don Williams]]) encouraged Gayle to record in a softer, mellower format. He also helped market her music towards a [[crossover music|crossover]] audience. Gayle also released her first United Artists single in 1974, &quot;Restless&quot;. Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann called the song &quot;assertive&quot; and &quot;sexy&quot;. The song peaked at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart. The same year, Gayle&#x27;s [[Crystal Gayle (album)|self-titled debut album]] was issued, reaching number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; [[Top Country Albums]] survey. The following year, she had her first top ten hit on the country chart with &quot;[[Wrong Road Again]]&quot;, also written by Allen Reynolds. She had minor hits with the singles &quot;This Is My Year for Mexico&quot; (1975) and &quot;Beyond You&quot; (1975). The latter song was co-written by Gayle and her husband, Bill Gatzimos. Her second studio album &quot;[[Somebody Loves You (Crystal Gayle album)|Somebody Loves You]]&quot; spawned a second top 10 hit: the [[Somebody Loves You (Crystal Gayle song)|title track]].

Gayle&#x27;s shift towards [[country pop]] was received better than her earlier recordings with Decca. Kurt Wolff of &quot;Country Music: The Rough Guide&quot; praised the new style, calling it a &quot;pleasant, easygoing sort of [[country music|country]]-[[folk music|folk]] blend – a close cousin to music of [[Emmylou Harris]].&quot; Encyclopedic writer Collin Larkin called her new music approach to have the &quot;easygoing charm&quot; of records by Don Williams. Oermann and Bufwack called the new style &quot;ear-catching&quot; and praised Allen Reynolds&#x27;s &quot;gentle rhythm productions.&quot;

Reynolds had limited time to write material for Gayle. Instead, he arranged for songwriters [[Bob McDill]] and [[Richard Leigh (songwriter)|Richard Leigh]] to help compose music. This arrangement proved successful when in 1976, Gayle had her first number 1 hit on the [[Hot Country Songs|&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles]] chart with &quot;[[I&#x27;ll Get Over You]]&quot;, written by Leigh. This was followed by a second number 1 hit, &quot;[[You Never Miss a Real Good Thing (Till He Says Goodbye)]]&quot;, and the number 2 hit, &quot;[[I&#x27;ll Do It All Over Again]]&quot;. Her third studio album, &quot;[[Crystal (Crystal Gayle album)|Crystal]]&quot;, was released in 1976, peaking at number 7 on the Top Country Albums chart.

===1977–1979: Crossover breakthrough===
Producer Allen Reynolds believed Gayle was poised to have [[crossover (music)|crossover pop]] success if the right song were found. In 1977, Richard Leigh had composed a tune called &quot;[[Don&#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue]]&quot;. The song was originally intended for British singer [[Shirley Bassey]]. When Reynolds heard the song he said to Leigh, &quot;You&#x27;re not sending that song anywhere.&quot; As was common practice at the time, according to the documentary the track was recorded alongside a guide or [[scratch vocal]], which Gayle recorded in one single take. Going back later to re-record the final production vocal, after several tries, she said she couldn&#x27;t get the same feeling back as in the original, so this was kept as the master.

&quot;Don&#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot; was released as a single in 1977, peaking at number 1 on the [[Hot Country Songs|&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles]] chart and crossing over to number 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100]]. Internationally, it became a hit in several countries including the [[United Kingdom]], where it reached the number 5 position. Since its release, &quot;Don&#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot; has been received positively by music critics and fans. They have also considered it her [[List of signature songs|signature song]]. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[AllMusic]] praised Gayle&#x27;s vocals, commenting, &quot;She never stressed it too heavily, nor were her vocals cloying — they were pretty and straightforward, making the song quite alluring.&quot;
Gayle&#x27;s fourth studio record, &quot;[[We Must Believe in Magic]]&quot;, was also released in 1977. The album peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart and number 12 on the &quot;[[Billboard 200]]&quot;. &quot;We Must Believe in Magic&quot; has received positive reviews since its initial release. [[AllMusic]] gave the record 3.5 out of 5 stars. Paul Dennis of &quot;My Kind of Country&quot; gave the album a &quot;Grade A&quot; rating, calling it &quot;an eclectic mix of songs ranging from pop standards to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll hits to songs by contemporary country songsmiths.&quot; &quot;We Must Believe in Magic&quot; became the first album by a female country artist to certify platinum in sales by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. In 1978, Gayle earned the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for &quot;Don&#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot;, while Leigh won a Grammy for [[Best Country Song]].

In 1978, her fifth studio album &quot;[[When I Dream]]&quot; was released, also reaching number 2 on the country albums chart. The album peaked at number 52 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and certified by platinum by the RIAA. &quot;When I Dream&quot; also received positive reviews, garnering 3 out of 5 stars from [[AllMusic]] and another &quot;Grade A&quot; rating from &quot;My Kind of Country&quot;. Its lead single was the [[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]]-penned &quot;[[Talking in Your Sleep (Crystal Gayle song)|Talking in Your Sleep]]&quot;. It became a number 1 country single and crossed over to number 18 on the Hot 100. &quot;Talking in Your Sleep&quot; became Gayle&#x27;s second international hit as well, peaking at number 11 in the United Kingdom. The album also included the hits &quot;[[Why Have You Left the One You Left Me For]]&quot; and the [[When I Dream (song)|title track]]. By the end of 1978, Gayle had won &quot;Female Vocalist of the Year&quot; from both the [[Academy of Country Music]] and the [[Country Music Association]]. Before departing from the United Artists label, her sixth studio album &quot;[[We Should Be Together (album)|We Should Be Together]]&quot; (1979) was released. It featured the two top-ten hits: &quot;[[Your Kisses Will]]&quot; and &quot;[[Your Old Cold Shoulder]]&quot;.

===1979–1989: Continued crossover success===
In 1979, Gayle moved to [[Columbia Records]], bringing Reynolds with her. Under Columbia, Gayle began recording more cover versions of songs. This decision received praise from music critics, who credited her for being &quot;versatile&quot;. Her seventh studio album, &quot;[[Miss the Mississippi]]&quot; was released in 1979 as well. It featured three major hits including &quot;[[Half the Way]]&quot;, which became her third crossover pop hit. &quot;Miss the Mississippi&quot; peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart number 36 on the &quot;[[Billboard 200]]&quot; and certified gold in sales from the RIAA. Gayle&#x27;s eighth studio release &quot;[[These Days (Crystal Gayle album)|These Days]]&quot; (1980) spawned two more number 1 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart: &quot;[[If You Ever Change Your Mind]]&quot; and &quot;[[Too Many Lovers]]&quot;. In 1981, Gayle&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;[[Hollywood, Tennessee]]&quot; peaked at number 5 on the country albums chart and number 99 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. Although commercially successful, it received mixed critical reviews. Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann said that the album &quot;symbolized her uptown inspirations&quot; and Jason Ankeny of [[AllMusic]] gave the album only 2.5 out of 5 stars. &quot;Hollywood, Tennessee&quot; spawned three major hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart. This included the crossover hit, &quot;[[The Woman in Me (Crystal Gayle song)|The Woman in Me]]&quot;, and the social awareness tune, &quot;[[Livin&#x27; in These Troubled Times]]&quot;.

As Gayle&#x27;s music crossed multiple genres, she made more appearances outside of the Nashville establishment. Among these was hosting two [[prime time]] television specials: &quot;The Crystal Gayle Special&quot; (1979) and &quot;Crystal&quot; (1980). Both shows aired on [[CBS]] and were given critical acclaim. Gayle would also appear with [[Bob Hope]] on his 1979 television special called &quot;On the Road to China&quot;. For the special, Gayle and Hope taped a performance on the [[Great Wall of China]]. The special made Gayle the first artist to film a performance on the Great Wall.
In 1982, Gayle collaborated with [[Tom Waits]] on the soundtrack of [[Francis Ford Coppola]]&#x27;s film &quot;[[One from the Heart]]&quot;. Originally, [[Bette Midler]] was chosen for the project, however Midler could not fit it into her schedule. At first the soundtrack was delayed by Columbia Records due to a dispute with Coppola&#x27;s Zoetrope Studios. When it was released, the [[One from the Heart|soundtrack]] received positive reviews. Thom Jurek of [[AllMusic]] gave the release 4.5 out of 5 stars, who called it &quot;one of the most beautifully wrought soundtrack collaborations in history&quot;. Steve Pond of &quot;[[Rolling Stone]]&quot; called it &quot;a dreamy series of duets with Crystal Gayle that drift in and out of the film, comment on the action and supply some crucial transitions.&quot;

Also in 1982, Gayle moved from Columbia to [[Elektra Records]], which would later merge with [[Warner Records|Warner Bros.]] Among the first recordings was a duet with [[Eddie Rabbitt]] titled &quot;[[You and I (Eddie Rabbitt and Crystal Gayle song)|You and I]]&quot;. The song reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart and became her second top 10 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Gayle&#x27;s first studio album with Elektra would also be issued in 1982, &quot;[[True Love (Crystal Gayle album)|True Love]]&quot;. First produced by Allen Reynolds, when the album was presented to [[Jimmy Bowen]] (Elektra&#x27;s division head), he commented that it &quot;rocked too much&quot;. For these reasons, Bowen decided to produce three additional tracks for the album. The album would receive a mixed reception. In &quot;[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]]&quot;″s initial review, they praised Gayle&#x27;s vocals despite the use of &quot;tougher arrangements&quot;. Tom Roland of AllMusic praised Gayle&#x27;s performance, notably on the tracks &quot;[[Our Love Is on the Faultline]]&quot; and &quot;Deeper Than the Fire&quot;. Roland also criticized the production arrangements Bowen arranged for. &quot;True Love&quot; spawned three singles that all reached the number 1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart: &quot;Our Love Is on the Faultine&quot;, &quot;Baby, What About You&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Til I Gain Control Again&quot;.

In 1983, Gayle&#x27;s released her next album called &quot;Cage the Songbird&quot;. It was the first of Gayle&#x27;s to be produced entirely by Jimmy Bowen. &quot;Cage the Songbird&quot; peaked at number 5 on the Top Country Albums chart and number 171 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. Among its singles were the crossover hits &quot;The Sound of Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Turning Away&quot;. Gayle had further hits from her next studio releases in 1985 and 1986. Among these were the number one hits, &quot;Straight to the Heart&quot; (1986) and &quot;Cry&quot; (1986). The latter was a song originally popularized by Johnnie Ray. In 1983, she would also record the theme song for the television series &quot;Masquerade&quot;. In 1984, she sang a duet with Hong Kong singer Danny Chan, titled &quot;Tell Me What Can I Do&quot;, it was largely unknown due to lack of promotional budget.

Between 1985 and 1987, Gayle collaborated with country artist Gary Morris on a series of duets. The first being the single &quot;Makin&#x27; Up for Lost Time&quot;. The song reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart in 1986. &quot;Makin&#x27; Up for Lost Time&quot; was referred to as the &quot;Lovers&#x27; Theme&quot; on &quot;Dallas&quot;. It became an anthem for supercouple Bobby (Patrick Duffy) and Pam Ewing (Victoria Principal) on the popular CBS prime time soap opera. The pair also recorded the theme for the NBC soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. Also titled &quot;Another World&quot;, it peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart at number four in February 1986. Gayle would also guest star in the show as herself. The show would ultimately use Morris&#x27; and Gayle&#x27;s recording as the show&#x27;s opening theme for nine years. The duo would release their collaborative studio album in 1986 titled, &quot;What If We Fall in Love?&quot;. The album peaked at number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums list in September 1987. In 1988, Gayle released her final album of the decade entitled &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Angel&quot;. The album produced two singles; the title track and the single &quot;Tennessee Nights&quot;.

Also in 1987, Gayle opened a gift shop in Nashville called &quot;Crystal&#x27;s Fine Gifts and Jewelry&quot;. The store contained various gifts, such as jewelry and stones made by various European artisans. The shop also included various types of crystals. In a 1994 interview, Gayle commented on her business: &quot;The little shop turned into a much larger shop and it takes a lot of work, as anyone in retail well knows. But we have a lot of fun with it.&quot; The shop officially closed in 2008.

===1990–present: Later career and recent years===
In 1990, Gayle signed a new recording contract with Capitol Records and reunited with producer Allen Reynolds. The same year she released seventeenth studio album, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Worry&quot;. Bill Carpenter of AllMusic gave the release 4 out of 5 stars, calling it &quot;an excellent set of country pop&quot;. The album spawned several singles, beginning with &quot;Just an Old Love&quot;. In its initial review &quot;Billboard&quot; gave it a positive response, praising the production style of Reynolds. Its third single, &quot;Never Ending Song of Love&quot;, would become Gayle&#x27;s last charting single to date, reaching number 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart. Her eighteenth studio album came in 1992 called &quot;Three Good Reasons&quot;. The album was produced by Buzz Stone. The album&#x27;s lead single of the same name spawned a music video. Bill Kohlhaase of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the song and video a positive review, saying, &quot;The video, alternating between scenes of Gayle and her swirling tresses with sparsely staged visions of a single mother and her two children, is the kind of heartfelt, yet assertive statement that Gayle has parlayed into major success in the past.&quot; AllMusic also gave the album 3 out of 5 stars.
As the 1990s progressed, Gayle recorded material for smaller labels and issuing specialty projects. Her first small label was the Branson Entertainment Group, where she released an album of re-recorded hits titled &quot;Best Always&quot;. In 1995, she signed with Intersound Records and recorded a pair of gospel studio albums. The first was 1995&#x27;s &quot;Someday&quot;, which she co-produced with Bobby Wood. The album&#x27;s first single included a music that was filmed in Greece. In a 1995 interview, she explained the message behind the title track, &quot;There are songs in there that definitely you&#x27;ve lived. The title track is a song that I think a lot of people, the way it&#x27;s written, definitely relate to.&quot; In 1997, her second gospel collection was released titled &quot;Joy &amp; Inspiration&quot;.

At the dawn of the new millennium, Gayle expanded her musical interests. In 1999, she released an album of jazz and American Standards called &quot;Crystal Gayle Sings the Heart and Soul of Hoagy Carmichael&quot;. It was as a tribute to Hoagy Carmichael, whom Gayle worked with shortly before his death in the early 1980s. It album featured covers of songs he composed, including &quot;Stardust&quot; and &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek gave the release 4 out of 5 stars in his review of &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;. Jurek called it, &quot;a gorgeous set, one that reaffirms Gayle&#x27;s artistry to be sure, but also one that offers the first really new hearing of Carmichael in at least a decade.&quot; &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; praised the lead single, &quot;Two Sleepy People&quot; (a duet with Willie Nelson), calling it &quot;sweet&quot; and &quot;playful&quot;. In 2000, she released a studio album of children&#x27;s music titled &quot;In My Arms&quot;. In 2003, she released her second album of American standards called &quot;All My Tomorrows&quot;. Robert Daniels of &quot;Variety&quot; commented positively, saying, &quot;Gayle&#x27;s singing boasts directness and subtlety. There are no flashy or show-busy theatrics.&quot; AllMusic gave the release 4 out of 5 stars, calling Gayle&#x27;s singing &quot;stunning&quot; and &quot;capable.&quot; In January 2007, fugitive Christopher Daniel Gay escaped from custody at an Interstate 95 welcome center near Hardeeville, South Carolina, and made his way to Tennessee where he stole Gayle&#x27;s tour bus. Gay was arrested the following day and the bus was returned to Gayle.

For several years, Gayle spent time recording her next studio release. She stated the album would consist of covers of country music classics and would be produced by her son, Chris Gatzimos. The project was originally titled &quot;Am I That Easy To Forget&quot;. In 2019, Gayle announced it would be re-titled &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me: Classic Country&quot;. It was officially released in September 2019 via Southpaw Productions and The Orchard. &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot; became Gayle&#x27;s first studio album to chart since 1988, reaching number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; independent albums list. The album received positive reviews from critics. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the release 3 of 5 stars. Erlewine noted that her upper register is &quot;a little diminished&quot;, but she still &quot;sounds amiable&quot;. Markos Papadatos of the &quot;Digital Journal&quot; gave it an &quot;A&quot; rating, commenting, &quot;Overall, Crystal Gayle is sensational on her new album, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot;, which is country as grits. Grab a bottle of wine and let this country queen lure you in with her timeless voice.&quot;

Also during the 1990s, Gayle wrote and recorded &quot;Midnight In The Desert&quot; for Art Bell Coast to Coast AM radio show.

==Personal life==

Gayle and her siblings claim Cherokee ancestry on their maternal and paternal lines. In October 2001, she was inducted into the Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame in honor of her self-identified Cherokee linkage.

Gayle has remained close to her seven siblings since childhood. Before signing a recording contract, she toured alongside her brother, Jay Lee Webb, in his band. Included on her 2019 studio album is a cover of Webb&#x27;s song &quot;You Never Were Mine&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Gayle wished she had &quot;done it a long time ago&quot; because they spent a lot of time touring together. Additionally, older sister Peggy Sue, has been an active member of Gayle&#x27;s road show for several years. Peggy Sue performs background vocals on Gayle&#x27;s show and does her own solo material too.

Gayle also remained close to her oldest sister Loretta Lynn. Music writers and journalists have claimed the pair had &quot;sibling rivalry&quot;. In an interview with &quot;People&quot;, Lynn explained that such a rivalry did not exist: &quot;People try to make it like we compete, but that&#x27;s all in their minds...We fight a little bit, but that&#x27;s just sisters. And we never fight over the music business.&quot; In a 2017 interview Gayle commented, &quot;Of course, we&#x27;re sisters. We can bicker... but we really didn&#x27;t have a problem. You know, I look up to my sister...We both have flaws in different ways, but we&#x27;re not gonna tell what they are, you know? But, I mean, we love each other.&quot;

Gayle has been married to husband Bill Gatzimos since 1971. The couple first dated in high school and while Gayle was signed to United Artists Records, Gatzimos attended law school at Vanderbilt University. Following law school, Gatzimos became Gayle&#x27;s manager and has since been president of the couple&#x27;s company, Gayle Enterprises. According to Gayle, their marriage has been successful because the couple pursues their &quot;own interests&quot; and lets each other &quot;breathe&quot;. The couple have two children: a daughter, Catherine (born 1983) and a son, Christos (born 1986). Gayle&#x27;s son is now a record producer and co-produced her 2019 album.

When Gayle&#x27;s first child was born, she continued working frequently. In 2003 she said, &quot;When I was onstage, I remember coming off stage and breast-feeding and then doing another show.&quot; When the couple had their second child, Gayle stayed home with the children. She also has two grandchildren named Elijah and Björn. Gayle spoke of her appreciation for grandchildren in a 2011 interview, &quot;Holidays are so amazing with Elijah. We make cookies, which is great because I never really got much of a chance to do this with my own children. There&#x27;s a pull when I go on the road when I&#x27;m not around him, and I want to be. He&#x27;s just a bright spot that you want to see all the time. He loves life.&quot;

==Musical styles==
Gayle&#x27;s musical style is rooted in country, but is also in pop and folk music. Unlike her siblings (who mostly were raised in rural Kentucky), Gayle&#x27;s formative years were spent in an urban environment. In this diverse atmosphere, Gayle was exposed to various styles of music. In 2003, she commented, &quot;I&#x27;ve always enjoyed folk, pop, rock, gospel, country, everything...&quot; As a child, she especially liked music by Lesley Gore, Brenda Lee and Patsy Cline. In her teen years, she developed a fondness for folk groups, most predominantly Peter, Paul and Mary.

Yet, Gayle also was attracted to the traditional country sound of her oldest sister Loretta Lynn. However it was Lynn that encouraged Gayle to develop a unique style. In an interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Gayle remarked: &quot;But she (Lynn) said, `No, you gotta go the middle of the road and have a different sound.&#x27; And I&#x27;d never have made it if I had been straight-ahead country...&quot; This perspective encouraged her to record different styles. In 2007, she commented that she likes to be called a singer: &quot;I call myself a singer of songs. I love to sing, whether it&#x27;s country, folk, pop or rock. I grew up singing all different styles, though definitely country is my roots.&quot; Gayle also said that her priority was to find quality material, &quot;I&#x27;ve had great producers. Allen Reynolds is one of them, and he is just fantastic. I would always find great songs that other people wrote, and I wanted to put out really really good songs.&quot;
Music journalists and critics have also described Gayle as having a smooth vocal delivery, different from that of her sister&#x27;s. AllMusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek noted &quot;her signature phrasing and sophisticated material&quot; to be a factor. Stephen L. Betts of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; explained that Gayle had &quot;a polished persona and singing style tailor-made for country-pop crossover.&quot; Kurt Wolff of &quot;Country Music: The Rough Guide&quot; commented that she had a &quot;sweet radio-friendly voice&quot; that &quot;made a picture-perfect pop-country star.&quot;

==Image==
Gayle&#x27;s image has garnered her significant media attention. Notably, she is known for her floor-length hair. As a child, Gayle&#x27;s mother kept her hair short. She was inspired to grow her hair to her knees after seeing a woman with similar hair in Nashville. When her hair increased in length by the late 1970s, Gayle&#x27;s fan club also significantly increased. By the early 1990s, her hair had reached floor&#x27;s length. During that time, she considered significantly cutting her hair due to headaches and time spent maintaining it. However, she ultimately decided not to cut it. Gayle credits her daughter for discouraging a haircut. Gayle&#x27;s daughter told her, &quot;You can&#x27;t cut your hair — you won&#x27;t be Crystal Gayle.&quot; Gayle also stated that it is easier to have long straight hair, &quot;I know some people think: &#x27;Why does she keep it so long?&#x27; I&#x27;d probably love to try all the different styles, but I&#x27;m not a beautician. So, I keep it long. It&#x27;s easy to wash and let it go.&quot; However, according to Gayle, she still continues seeing a hairstylist. Within a year, she cuts 9 to 12 inches of hair.

Gayle&#x27;s physical appearance has also made her a sex symbol. Writers Robert K. Oermann and Mary A. Bufwack wrote in 2003, &quot;Crystal Gayle will be forever recalled by music fans for the sexy toss of her head that sent waves of motion through her Godiva-like brunette tresses.&quot; Author Kurt Wolff described Gayle as having &quot;knockout good looks&quot;. In 1983, &quot;People&quot; named her among the &quot;50 Most Beautiful People in the World&quot;.

==Legacy==
Gayle has been credited as one of the most successful and important country pop crossover artists. Gayle&#x27;s music and career helped open doors for future female country pop artists, including Faith Hill, Shania Twain and Carrie Underwood. Writer Kevin John Coyne described her successes and contributions: &quot;... she had accumulated an astonishing eighteen No.1 hits, two more than her older sister had under her belt, and fourth among all women in country music history, behind Dolly Parton, Reba McEntire and Tammy Wynette.

In recent years, Gayle has been given several awards and accolades for her accomplishments. In 2003, she was included by Country Music Television on their list of the &quot;40 Greatest Women of Country Music&quot;. In 2008, she was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame and Museum. In 2009, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She was joined by artist Tanya Tucker and her family for the ceremony. In 2016, she was presented with the &quot;Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award&quot; from the Academy of Country Music. Gayle commented in 2016, &quot;It&#x27;s nice to think maybe your music has influenced other artists who are out there.&quot;

In November 2016 almost 50 years after making her debut as a guest artist, Gayle was asked to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry by Carrie Underwood. The two performed &quot;Don&#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot; before Underwood announced the invitation. Gayle was officially inducted by Loretta Lynn in January 2017. In 2017, Gayle was included in &quot;Taste of Country&quot;″s list of &quot;Country Music&#x27;s Most Powerful Women&quot;. In 2019, she was among a dozen performers chosen to open the Country Music Association Awards as part of recognizing the women of country music. In the show&#x27;s opening, Gayle performed &quot;Don&#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot;.

<link wikidata="Q862771" start="6005" end="18164" title="Hot Country Songs" label="&amp;quot;Billboard&amp;quot; [[Hot Country Singles]] chart. The song was followed by other singles that reached minor positions on the country songs chart: &amp;quot;Everybody Oughta Cry&amp;quot; (1972) and &amp;quot;I Hope You&amp;#x27;re Havin&amp;#x27; Better Luck Than Me&amp;quot; (1972). Gayle&amp;#x27;s career stalled while at the Decca label. This was because the label wanted Gayle to record in the same style as her sister. Steve Huey of [[AllMusic]] criticized her early singles, calling them &amp;quot;little Loretta records&amp;quot;. Writers Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann noted that Gayle was &amp;quot;probably stigmatized&amp;quot; for being the sibling of Loretta Lynn. In a 2019 interview with &amp;quot;[[Forbes]]&amp;quot;, Gayle reflected on the experience, &amp;quot;It didn&amp;#x27;t take me long to realize I was only there because I was Loretta&amp;#x27;s sister.&amp;quot; During this period, Lynn gave Gayle advice that prompted her to expand her musical styles. Lynn said, &amp;quot;quit singing my songs...We have one Loretta Lynn and we don&amp;#x27;t need another.&amp;quot; The conversation led Gayle to ultimately leave Decca in 1974.
Gayle signed a new recording contract with [[United Artists Records]] in 1974. Under the direction of producer [[Allen Reynolds]], her musical style shifted. Reynolds (who had recent success producing [[Don Williams]]) encouraged Gayle to record in a softer, mellower format. He also helped market her music towards a [[crossover music|crossover]] audience. Gayle also released her first United Artists single in 1974, &amp;quot;Restless&amp;quot;. Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann called the song &amp;quot;assertive&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sexy&amp;quot;. The song peaked at number 39 on the &amp;quot;Billboard&amp;quot; country songs chart. The same year, Gayle&amp;#x27;s [[Crystal Gayle (album)|self-titled debut album]] was issued, reaching number 25 on the &amp;quot;Billboard&amp;quot; [[Top Country Albums]] survey. The following year, she had her first top ten hit on the country chart with &amp;quot;[[Wrong Road Again]]&amp;quot;, also written by Allen Reynolds. She had minor hits with the singles &amp;quot;This Is My Year for Mexico&amp;quot; (1975) and &amp;quot;Beyond You&amp;quot; (1975). The latter song was co-written by Gayle and her husband, Bill Gatzimos. Her second studio album &amp;quot;[[Somebody Loves You (Crystal Gayle album)|Somebody Loves You]]&amp;quot; spawned a second top 10 hit: the [[Somebody Loves You (Crystal Gayle song)|title track]].

Gayle&amp;#x27;s shift towards [[country pop]] was received better than her earlier recordings with Decca. Kurt Wolff of &amp;quot;Country Music: The Rough Guide&amp;quot; praised the new style, calling it a &amp;quot;pleasant, easygoing sort of [[country music|country]]-[[folk music|folk]] blend – a close cousin to music of [[Emmylou Harris]].&amp;quot; Encyclopedic writer Collin Larkin called her new music approach to have the &amp;quot;easygoing charm&amp;quot; of records by Don Williams. Oermann and Bufwack called the new style &amp;quot;ear-catching&amp;quot; and praised Allen Reynolds&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;gentle rhythm productions.&amp;quot;

Reynolds had limited time to write material for Gayle. Instead, he arranged for songwriters [[Bob McDill]] and [[Richard Leigh (songwriter)|Richard Leigh]] to help compose music. This arrangement proved successful when in 1976, Gayle had her first number 1 hit on the [[Hot Country Songs|&amp;quot;Billboard&amp;quot; Hot Country Singles]] chart with &amp;quot;[[I&amp;#x27;ll Get Over You]]&amp;quot;, written by Leigh. This was followed by a second number 1 hit, &amp;quot;[[You Never Miss a Real Good Thing (Till He Says Goodbye)]]&amp;quot;, and the number 2 hit, &amp;quot;[[I&amp;#x27;ll Do It All Over Again]]&amp;quot;. Her third studio album, &amp;quot;[[Crystal (Crystal Gayle album)|Crystal]]&amp;quot;, was released in 1976, peaking at number 7 on the Top Country Albums chart.

===1977–1979: Crossover breakthrough===
Producer Allen Reynolds believed Gayle was poised to have [[crossover (music)|crossover pop]] success if the right song were found. In 1977, Richard Leigh had composed a tune called &amp;quot;[[Don&amp;#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue]]&amp;quot;. The song was originally intended for British singer [[Shirley Bassey]]. When Reynolds heard the song he said to Leigh, &amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re not sending that song anywhere.&amp;quot; As was common practice at the time, according to the documentary the track was recorded alongside a guide or [[scratch vocal]], which Gayle recorded in one single take. Going back later to re-record the final production vocal, after several tries, she said she couldn&amp;#x27;t get the same feeling back as in the original, so this was kept as the master.

&amp;quot;Don&amp;#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&amp;quot; was released as a single in 1977, peaking at number 1 on the [[Hot Country Songs|&amp;quot;Billboard&amp;quot; Hot Country Singles]] chart and crossing over to number 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|&amp;quot;Billboard&amp;quot; Hot 100]]. Internationally, it became a hit in several countries including the [[United Kingdom]], where it reached the number 5 position. Since its release, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&amp;quot; has been received positively by music critics and fans. They have also considered it her [[List of signature songs|signature song]]. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[AllMusic]] praised Gayle&amp;#x27;s vocals, commenting, &amp;quot;She never stressed it too heavily, nor were her vocals cloying — they were pretty and straightforward, making the song quite alluring.&amp;quot;
Gayle&amp;#x27;s fourth studio record, &amp;quot;[[We Must Believe in Magic]]&amp;quot;, was also released in 1977. The album peaked at number 2 on the &amp;quot;Billboard&amp;quot; country albums chart and number 12 on the &amp;quot;[[Billboard 200]]&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;We Must Believe in Magic&amp;quot; has received positive reviews since its initial release. [[AllMusic]] gave the record 3.5 out of 5 stars. Paul Dennis of &amp;quot;My Kind of Country&amp;quot; gave the album a &amp;quot;Grade A&amp;quot; rating, calling it &amp;quot;an eclectic mix of songs ranging from pop standards to rock &amp;#x27;n&amp;#x27; roll hits to songs by contemporary country songsmiths.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We Must Believe in Magic&amp;quot; became the first album by a female country artist to certify platinum in sales by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. In 1978, Gayle earned the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for &amp;quot;Don&amp;#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&amp;quot;, while Leigh won a Grammy for [[Best Country Song]].

In 1978, her fifth studio album &amp;quot;[[When I Dream]]&amp;quot; was released, also reaching number 2 on the country albums chart. The album peaked at number 52 on the &amp;quot;Billboard 200&amp;quot; and certified by platinum by the RIAA. &amp;quot;When I Dream&amp;quot; also received positive reviews, garnering 3 out of 5 stars from [[AllMusic]] and another &amp;quot;Grade A&amp;quot; rating from &amp;quot;My Kind of Country&amp;quot;. Its lead single was the [[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]]-penned &amp;quot;[[Talking in Your Sleep (Crystal Gayle song)|Talking in Your Sleep]]&amp;quot;. It became a number 1 country single and crossed over to number 18 on the Hot 100. &amp;quot;Talking in Your Sleep&amp;quot; became Gayle&amp;#x27;s second international hit as well, peaking at number 11 in the United Kingdom. The album also included the hits &amp;quot;[[Why Have You Left the One You Left Me For]]&amp;quot; and the [[When I Dream (song)|title track]]. By the end of 1978, Gayle had won &amp;quot;Female Vocalist of the Year&amp;quot; from both the [[Academy of Country Music]] and the [[Country Music Association]]. Before departing from the United Artists label, her sixth studio album &amp;quot;[[We Should Be Together (album)|We Should Be Together]]&amp;quot; (1979) was released. It featured the two top-ten hits: &amp;quot;[[Your Kisses Will]]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[[Your Old Cold Shoulder]]&amp;quot;.

===1979–1989: Continued crossover success===
In 1979, Gayle moved to [[Columbia Records]], bringing Reynolds with her. Under Columbia, Gayle began recording more cover versions of songs. This decision received praise from music critics, who credited her for being &amp;quot;versatile&amp;quot;. Her seventh studio album, &amp;quot;[[Miss the Mississippi]]&amp;quot; was released in 1979 as well. It featured three major hits including &amp;quot;[[Half the Way]]&amp;quot;, which became her third crossover pop hit. &amp;quot;Miss the Mississippi&amp;quot; peaked at number 3 on the &amp;quot;Billboard&amp;quot; Top Country Albums chart number 36 on the &amp;quot;[[Billboard 200]]&amp;quot; and certified gold in sales from the RIAA. Gayle&amp;#x27;s eighth studio release &amp;quot;[[These Days (Crystal Gayle album)|These Days]]&amp;quot; (1980) spawned two more number 1 singles on the &amp;quot;Billboard&amp;quot; Hot Country Singles chart: &amp;quot;[[If You Ever Change Your Mind]]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[[Too Many Lovers]]&amp;quot;. In 1981, Gayle&amp;#x27;s ninth studio album &amp;quot;[[Hollywood, Tennessee]]&amp;quot; peaked at number 5 on the country albums chart and number 99 on the &amp;quot;Billboard 200&amp;quot;. Although commercially successful, it received mixed critical reviews. Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann said that the album &amp;quot;symbolized her uptown inspirations&amp;quot; and Jason Ankeny of [[AllMusic]] gave the album only 2.5 out of 5 stars. &amp;quot;Hollywood, Tennessee&amp;quot; spawned three major hits on the &amp;quot;Billboard&amp;quot; country songs chart. This included the crossover hit, &amp;quot;[[The Woman in Me (Crystal Gayle song)|The Woman in Me]]&amp;quot;, and the social awareness tune, &amp;quot;[[Livin&amp;#x27; in These Troubled Times]]&amp;quot;.

As Gayle&amp;#x27;s music crossed multiple genres, she made more appearances outside of the Nashville establishment. Among these was hosting two [[prime time]] television specials: &amp;quot;The Crystal Gayle Special&amp;quot; (1979) and &amp;quot;Crystal&amp;quot; (1980). Both shows aired on [[CBS]] and were given critical acclaim. Gayle would also appear with [[Bob Hope]] on his 1979 television special called &amp;quot;On the Road to China&amp;quot;. For the special, Gayle and Hope taped a performance on the [[Great Wall of China]]. The special made Gayle the first artist to film a performance on the Great Wall.
In 1982, Gayle collaborated with [[Tom Waits]] on the soundtrack of [[Francis Ford Coppola]]&amp;#x27;s film &amp;quot;[[One from the Heart]]&amp;quot;. Originally, [[Bette Midler]] was chosen for the project, however Midler could not fit it into her schedule. At first the soundtrack was delayed by Columbia Records due to a dispute with Coppola&amp;#x27;s Zoetrope Studios. When it was released, the [[One from the Heart|soundtrack]] received positive reviews. Thom Jurek of [[AllMusic]] gave the release 4.5 out of 5 stars, who called it &amp;quot;one of the most beautifully wrought soundtrack collaborations in history&amp;quot;. Steve Pond of &amp;quot;[[Rolling Stone]]&amp;quot; called it &amp;quot;a dreamy series of duets with Crystal Gayle that drift in and out of the film, comment on the action and supply some crucial transitions.&amp;quot;

Also in 1982, Gayle moved from Columbia to [[Elektra Records]], which would later merge with [[Warner Records|Warner Bros.]] Among the first recordings was a duet with [[Eddie Rabbitt]] titled &amp;quot;[[You and I (Eddie Rabbitt and Crystal Gayle song)|You and I]]&amp;quot;. The song reached number 1 on the &amp;quot;Billboard&amp;quot; Hot Country Singles chart and became her second top 10 hit on the &amp;quot;Billboard&amp;quot; Hot 100. Gayle&amp;#x27;s first studio album with Elektra would also be issued in 1982, &amp;quot;[[True Love (Crystal Gayle album)|True Love]]&amp;quot;. First produced by Allen Reynolds, when the album was presented to [[Jimmy Bowen]] (Elektra&amp;#x27;s division head), he commented that it &amp;quot;rocked too much&amp;quot;. For these reasons, Bowen decided to produce three additional tracks for the album. The album would receive a mixed reception. In &amp;quot;[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]]&amp;quot;″s initial review, they praised Gayle&amp;#x27;s vocals despite the use of &amp;quot;tougher arrangements&amp;quot;. Tom Roland of AllMusic praised Gayle&amp;#x27;s performance, notably on the tracks &amp;quot;[[Our Love Is on the Faultline]]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Deeper Than the Fire&amp;quot;. Roland also criticized the production arrangements Bowen arranged for. &amp;quot;True Love&amp;quot; spawned three singles that all reached the number 1 spot on the &amp;quot;Billboard&amp;quot; Hot Country Singles"/>

<text>The Hogg baronetcy, of Upper Grosvenor Street in the County of London, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 20 July 1846 for the lawyer and Conservative politician James Hogg. He was Registrar of the Supreme Court of Judicature and Vice-Admiralty Court in Calcutta for many years and also represented Beverley and Honiton in the House of Commons. His son, the second Baronet, was Chairman of the Metropolitan Board of Works in London from 1870 to 1889. On 5 July 1887 he was created Baron Magheramorne, of Magheramorne in the County of Antrim, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, as part of the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The title is pronounced &quot;Marramorn&quot; and derives from a historic site in County Antrim near Larne.

The barony became extinct on the death of the first Baron&#x27;s third son, the fourth Baron, in 1957, while the baronetcy is extant.

The merchant and philanthropist Quintin Hogg, seventh son of the first Baronet, was the father of The 1st Viscount Hailsham, twice Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.

<doc id="589966" wikidata="Q1754793" url="?curid=589966" title="Foreign Affairs (Tom Waits album)">
<text>Foreign Affairs is the fifth studio album by singer and songwriter Tom Waits, released on September 13, 1977, on Asylum Records. It was produced by Bones Howe, and featured Bette Midler singing a duet with Waits on &quot;I Never Talk to Strangers&quot;.

==Production==
Bones Howe, the album&#x27;s producer and engineer, remembers the album&#x27;s original concept and production approach thus:

&quot;[Waits] talked to me about doing this other material [...] He said, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to do the demos first, and then I&#x27;m gonna let you listen to them. Then we should talk about what it should be.&#x27; I listened to the material and said, &#x27;It&#x27;s like a black-and-white movie.&#x27; That&#x27;s where the cover came from. The whole idea that it was going to be a black-and-white movie. It&#x27;s the way it seemed to me when we were putting it together. Whether or not it came out that way, I don&#x27;t have any idea, because there&#x27;s such metamorphosis when you&#x27;re working on [records]. They change and change.&quot;

==Artwork==
Pictured on the cover with Waits is a Native American woman named Marsheila Cockrell, who worked at the box office of The Troubadour in Los Angeles. &quot;She was a girl who was... not a girlfriend but she &quot;thought&quot; she was a girlfriend.&quot;
&quot;For the album cover Waits wanted to convey the film-noir mood that coloured so many of the songs. Veteran Hollywood portraitist George Hurrell was hired to shoot Waits, both alone and in a clutch with a shadowy female whose ring-encrusted right hand clamped a passport to his chest. The back-cover shot of Tom was particularly good, casting him as a slicked-back hoodlum—half matinee idol, half hair-trigger psychopath. The inner sleeve depicted the soused singer clawing at the keys of his Tropicana upright.&quot;
==Critical reception==

&quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau gave a mixed review of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. He appreciated the Bette Midler duet &quot;I Never Talk to Strangers&quot;, &quot;Jack &amp; Neal&quot;&#x27;s combination of poetry and jazz, the &quot;mumbled monologue&quot; of &quot;Barber Shop&quot;, and the title track, which he described as &quot;Anglophile&quot;, but lamented &quot;Potter&#x27;s Field&quot; for its theatrical music and narrative following &quot;a high-rolling nightstick&quot;. He critiqued the album further in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981):

<text>Protein electrophoresis is a method for analysing the proteins in a fluid or an extract. The electrophoresis may be performed with a small volume of sample in a number of alternative ways with or without a supporting medium, namely agarose or polyacrylamide. Variants of gel electrophoresis include SDS-PAGE, free-flow electrophoresis, electrofocusing, isotachophoresis, affinity electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, counterelectrophoresis, and capillary electrophoresis. Each variant has many subtypes with individual advantages and limitations. Gel electrophoresis is often performed in combination with electroblotting or immunoblotting to give additional information about a specific protein.

==Denaturing gel methods==

===SDS-PAGE===
SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, describes a collection of related techniques to separate proteins according to their electrophoretic mobility (a function of the molecular weight of a polypeptide chain) while in the denatured (unfolded) state. In most proteins, the binding of SDS to the polypeptide chain imparts an even distribution of charge per unit mass, thereby resulting in a fractionation by approximate size during electrophoresis.

SDS is a strong detergent agent used to denature native proteins to unfolded, individual polypeptides. When a protein mixture is heated to 100 °C in presence of SDS, the detergent wraps around the polypeptide backbone. In this process, the intrinsic charges of polypeptides becomes negligible when compared to the negative charges contributed by SDS. Thus polypeptides after treatment become rod-like structures possessing a uniform charge density, that is same net negative charge per unit length. The electrophoretic mobilities of these proteins will be a linear function of the logarithms of their molecular weights.

==Native gel methods==

Native gels, also known as non-denaturing gels, analyze proteins that are still in their folded state. Thus, the electrophoretic mobility depends not only on the charge-to-mass ratio, but also on the physical shape and size of the protein.

===Blue native PAGE===

BN-PAGE is a native PAGE technique, where the Coomassie brilliant blue dye provides the necessary charges to the protein complexes for the electrophoretic separation. The disadvantage of Coomassie is that in binding to proteins it can act like a detergent causing complexes to dissociate. Another drawback is the potential quenching of chemoluminescence (e.g. in subsequent western blot detection or activity assays) or fluorescence of proteins with prosthetic groups (e.g. heme or chlorophyll) or labelled with fluorescent dyes.

===Clear native PAGE===

CN-PAGE (commonly referred to as Native PAGE) separates acidic water-soluble and membrane proteins in a polyacrylamide gradient gel. It uses no charged dye so the electrophoretic mobility of proteins in CN-PAGE (in contrast to the charge shift technique BN-PAGE) is related to the intrinsic charge of the proteins. The migration distance depends on the protein charge, its size and the pore size of the gel. In many cases this method has lower resolution than BN-PAGE, but CN-PAGE offers advantages whenever Coomassie dye would interfere with further analytical techniques, for example it has been described as a very efficient microscale separation technique for FRET analyses. Additionally, as CN-PAGE does not require the harsh conditions of BN-PAGE, it can retain the supramolecular assemblies of membrane protein complexes that would be dissociated in BN-PAGE.

===Preparative native PAGE===

The folded protein complexes of interest separate cleanly and predictably without the risk of denaturation due to the specific properties of the polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresis buffer solution, electrophoretic equipment and standardized parameters used. The separated proteins are continuously eluted into a physiological eluent and transported to a fraction collector. In four to five PAGE fractions each the different metal cofactors can be identified and absolutely quantified by high-resolution ICP-MS. The associated structures of the isolated metalloproteins in these fractions can be specifically determined by solution NMR spectroscopy.

==Buffer systems==

Most protein separations are performed using a &quot;discontinuous&quot; (or DISC) buffer system that significantly enhances the sharpness of the bands within the gel. During electrophoresis in a discontinuous gel system, an ion gradient is formed in the early stage of electrophoresis that causes all of the proteins to focus into a single sharp band. The formation of the ion gradient is achieved by choosing a pH value at which the ions of the buffer are only moderately charged compared to the SDS-coated proteins. These conditions provide an environment in which Kohlrausch&#x27;s reactions determine the molar conductivity. As a result, SDS-coated proteins are concentrated to several fold in a thin zone of the order of 19 μm within a few minutes. At this stage all proteins migrate at the same migration speed by isotachophoresis. This occurs in a region of the gel that has larger pores so that the gel matrix does not retard the migration during the focusing or &quot;stacking&quot; event. Separation of the proteins by size is achieved in the lower, &quot;resolving&quot; region of the gel. The resolving gel typically has a much smaller pore size, which leads to a sieving effect that now determines the electrophoretic mobility of the proteins. At the same time, the separating part of the gel also has a pH value in which the buffer ions on average carry a greater charge, causing them to &quot;outrun&quot; the SDS-covered proteins and eliminate the ion gradient and thereby the stacking effect.

A very widespread discontinuous buffer system is the tris-glycine or &quot;Laemmli&quot; system that stacks at a pH of 6.8 and resolves at a pH of ~8.3-9.0. A drawback of this system is that these pH values may promote disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues in the proteins because the pKa of cysteine ranges from 8-9 and because reducing agent present in the loading buffer doesn&#x27;t co-migrate with the proteins. Recent advances in buffering technology alleviate this problem by resolving the proteins at a pH well below the pKa of cysteine (e.g., bis-tris, pH 6.5) and include reducing agents (e.g. sodium bisulfite) that move into the gel ahead of the proteins to maintain a reducing environment. An additional benefit of using buffers with lower pH values is that the acrylamide gel is more stable at lower pH values, so the gels can be stored for long periods of time before use.

===SDS gradient gel electrophoresis of proteins===
As voltage is applied, the anions (and negatively charged sample molecules) migrate toward the positive electrode (anode) in the lower chamber, the leading ion is Cl− ( high mobility and high concentration); glycinate is the trailing ion (low mobility and low concentration). SDS-protein particles do not migrate freely at the border between the Cl− of the gel buffer and the Gly− of the cathode buffer. Friedrich Kohlrausch found that Ohm&#x27;s law also applies to dissolved electrolytes. Because of the voltage drop between the Cl− and Glycine-buffers, proteins are compressed (stacked) into micrometer thin layers. The boundary moves through a pore gradient and the protein stack gradually disperses due to a frictional resistance increase of the gel matrix. Stacking and unstacking occurs continuously in the gradient gel, for every protein at a different position. For a complete protein unstacking the polyacrylamide-gel concentration must exceed 16% T. The two-gel system of &quot;Laemmli&quot; is a simple gradient gel. The pH discontinuity of the buffers is of no significance for the separation quality, and a &quot;stacking-gel&quot; with a different pH is not needed.

==Visualization==

The most popular protein stain is Coomassie brilliant blue. It is an anionic dye, which non-specifically binds to proteins. Proteins in the gel are fixed by acetic acid and simultaneously stained. The excess dye incorporated into the gel can be removed by destaining with the same solution without the dye. The proteins are detected as blue bands on a clear background.

When more sensitive method than staining by Coomassie is needed, silver staining is usually used. Silver staining is a sensitive procedure to detect trace amounts of proteins in gels, but can also visualize nucleic acid or polysaccharides.

Visualization methods without using a dye such as Coomassie and silver are available on the market. For example Bio-Rad Laboratories markets ”stain-free” gels for SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Alternatively, reversible fluorescent dyes, such as those from Azure Biosystems such as AzureRed or Azure TotalStain Q can be used.

Similarly as in nucleic acid gel electrophoresis, tracking dye is often used. Anionic dyes of a known electrophoretic mobility are usually included in the sample buffer. A very common tracking dye is Bromophenol blue. This dye is coloured at alkali and neutral pH and is a small negatively charged molecule that moves towards the anode. Being a highly mobile molecule it moves ahead of most proteins.

==Medical applications==

In medicine, protein electrophoresis is a method of analysing the proteins mainly in blood serum. Before the widespread use of gel electrophoresis, protein electrophoresis was performed as free-flow electrophoresis (on paper) or as immunoelectrophoresis.

Traditionally, two classes of blood proteins are considered: serum albumin and globulin. They are generally equal in proportion, but albumin as a molecule is much smaller and lightly, negatively-charged, leading to an accumulation of albumin on the electrophoretic gel. A small band before albumin represents transthyretin (also named prealbumin). Some forms of medication or body chemicals can cause their own band, but it usually is small. Abnormal bands (spikes) are seen in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and multiple myeloma, and are useful in the diagnosis of these conditions.

The globulins are classified by their banding pattern (with their main representatives):
* The &quot;alpha&quot; (α) band consists of two parts, 1 and 2:
** α1 - α1-antitrypsin, α1-acid glycoprotein.
** α2 - haptoglobin, α2-macroglobulin, α2-antiplasmin, ceruloplasmin.
* The &quot;beta&quot; (β) band - transferrin, LDL, complement
* The &quot;gamma&quot; (γ) band - immunoglobulin (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM). Paraproteins (in multiple myeloma) usually appear in this band.

<text>USS &quot;Talladega&quot; (APA/LPA-208) was a of the US Navy. She was of the VC2-S-AP5 Victory ship design type. &quot;Talladega&quot; was named for Talladega County, Alabama.

==Construction==
&quot;Talladega&quot; was laid down 3 June 1944, under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MCV hull 556, by Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard No. 2, Richmond, California; launched on 17 August 1944, sponsored by Miss Marie Tomerlin; and commissioned on 31 October 1944.

==Service history==
===World War II period===
Following her shakedown cruise, &quot;Talladega&quot; loaded cargo and passengers at San Francisco; got underway for Hawaii on 5 December; and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 11 December. The attack transport conducted amphibious landing exercises with elements of the 28th Regimental Combat Team (RCT), 5th Marine Division, to prepare for the assault on the Volcano Islands. She departed Pearl Harbor on 27 January 1945, and proceeded via Eniwetok to the Mariana Islands.

====Invasion of Iwo Jima====

&quot;Talladega&quot; sortied from Saipan as a unit of Task Group 56.2, the Assault Group, on 16 February, and arrived off Iwo Jima on the morning of 19 February, &quot;D-day&quot;. Four Marines pictured in Joe Rosenthal&#x27;s famous flag-raising photograph debarked from &quot;Talladega&quot; to climb Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima: Ira Hayes, Franklin Sousley, Harlon Block, and Mike Strank. After landing her troops, she remained off the beaches embarking combat casualties for six days before heading back toward Saipan.

====Troop movements====
&quot;Talladega&quot; was routed onward through Tulagi and New Caledonia to the New Hebrides. She loaded troops and equipment of the 165th RCT, 27th Infantry Division, at Espiritu Santo on 24 March and departed the next day. Her troops were part of the reserve for the invasion of Okinawa; and, after a stop at Ulithi, she arrived off that island on 9 April. She finished unloading her passengers and cargo by the 14th and returned, via Saipan, to Ulithi.

&quot;Talladega&quot; was subsequently ordered to the Philippine Islands and arrived at Subic Bay on 31 May. She remained in the Philippines, training elements of the Americal and 1st Cavalry Divisions for a projected invasion of Japan. However, before the operation began, Japan surrendered.

====Surrender of Japan====
On 25 August, troops of the 1st Cavalry Division embarked, and the transport headed for Yokohama the next day. &quot;Talladega&quot; was the first of the 31 Ship Convoy with occupation troops to dock at Yokohama on VJ Day, 2 September 1945. She disembarked her passengers there between 2 and 4 September, and then returned to the Philippines to pick up soldiers of the 41st Infantry Division for transportation to Japan. The attack transport reached Kure, Honshū, on 5 October.

====Operation Magic Carpet====
&quot;Talladega&quot; returned to Leyte on 16 October, for provisions and fuel. The next day, now taking part in Operation Magic Carpet, she loaded 1,934 veterans at Samar and sailed for the United States. The ship arrived at San Pedro, on 3 November, and disembarked her passengers. She made three more round-trips to the Pacific to return troops: to Okinawa in December 1945, to the Philippines in April 1946, and to China in July. When &quot;Talladega&quot; returned to San Francisco in July, she began preparations for inactivation and assignment to the Reserve Fleet. She was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 27 December 1946, at the Pacific Reserve Fleet, San Francisco Group.

===Korean War recommission===
The outbreak of hostilities in Korea on 25 June 1950, increased the Navy&#x27;s need for active amphibious ships. Consequently, &quot;Talladega&quot; was recommissioned at Hunters Point, California, on 8 December 1951. She operated along the west coast until November 1952, when she embarked aviation personnel at San Francisco and steamed westward as a unit of Transport Division 12. The assault transport arrived at Yokosuka, on 29 November. She loaded men and equipment of the 1st Cavalry Division and headed for the Korean War zone.

&quot;Talladega&quot; arrived at Pusan on 14 December 1952, unloaded, and returned to Japan on 18 December. During the next nine months, the transport provided amphibious training for the United Nations forces in Japan and redeployed troops from one area in Korea to another. She operated in the war zone during each of the first seven months of 1953, but June. She worked along both coasts, transporting troops and supplies to such ports as Inchon, Koje-Do, and Sokcho, before returning to San Diego on 15 August 1953.

===Post-war duty===
During the next 12 years, the transport&#x27;s operations along the west coast were broken by seven deployments to the western Pacific.

In 1955, the &quot;USS Talladega&quot; was featured in the World War II film classic, &quot;Battle Cry&quot;.

===Vietnam War===
In 1965, when United States forces assumed a combat role in South Vietnam, &quot;Talladega&quot; stood out of Long Beach on 27 April, for duty with the 7th Fleet. After calling at Pearl Harbor from 2 to 5 May, she proceeded to Guam where she loaded cargo for Vietnam. She delivered the equipment and supplies at Danang on 30 and 31 May. Following upkeep at Subic Bay, the attack transport moved to Okinawa to combat load the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, for passage to Vietnam. On 1 July, &quot;Talladega&quot; joined Task Group 75.6, composed of and . Marines from the three ships were assault-landed at Qui Nhon and cleared Viet Cong forces from the mountains around Qui Nhon harbor by 6 July. They then reembarked in the ships which remained in the area until 22 July.

From 15 to 25 August, &quot;Talladega&quot; participated in Operation Starlite, landing marines 10 miles south of Chu Lai. On 12 September, she joined Task Group 76.3 which, in mid-September and early October, conducted the first two raids by a Navy-Marine Corps team in the Vietnam War. On 11 October, the ship returned to Subic Bay and disembarked the marines and then proceeded to Okinawa to unload equipment. After calls at Yokosuka and Pearl Harbor, the transport arrived at Long Beach on 17 November 1965.

&quot;Talladega&quot; returned to the western Pacific from 14 January to 17 April 1966. During this period, she transported two loads of marines and their equipment from Okinawa to Chu Lai. In 1967, the transport was deployed from 21 July to 1 December. Elements of the 11th Infantry Brigade were transported to Hawaii in July; and, after calling at Guam, &quot;Talladega&quot; proceeded to Subic Bay. She arrived there on 27 August and began loading supplies for Vietnam. However, a change in orders sent her to Japan. The transport arrived at Yokosuka on 7 September, loaded supplies for Operation Hand Clasp, and headed for Korea the next day. She offloaded supplies at Pusan from 17 to 20 September and returned to Japan. On 12 October, &quot;Talladega&quot; got underway for Vietnam.

&quot;Talladega&quot; arrived at Vũng Tàu on 19 October, and loaded &quot;Hand Clasp&quot; supplies for delivery to Saigon. She offloaded the supplies between 25 and 31 October. The ship then began the return voyage to the United States. After calling at Hong Kong, Buckner Bay, and Pearl Harbor, she arrived at Long Beach, California, on 1 December 1967.

==Decommissioning==
&quot;Talladega&quot; was placed in a caretaker status for 18 months before being decommissioned 1 July 1969. On 1 January 1969, she was redesignated LPA-208. On 20 October 1969, &quot;Talladega&quot; was transferred to the temporary custody of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) and berthed at Olympia, Washington. On 1 September 1971, the ship was transferred to the permanent custody of MARAD. In July 1972, the transport was moved to the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet where she remained into October 1982.

On 26 May 1982, she was sold to C.W. Enterprise and Investment Company, with permission to sell to foreign scrappers. She was removed from the fleet, 1 October 1982.

==Awards==
&quot;Talladega&quot; received two battle stars for World War II, two for Korea, and three for Vietnam.

<doc id="589980" wikidata="Q7559902" url="?curid=589980" title="Somerset Railroad (New York)">
<text>The Somerset Railroad was a railroad that operated in Niagara County, New York. It was operated by CSX Transportation. The railroad was built with the primary objective of providing coal to the Kintigh Generating Station, also known as the Somerset Power Plant, a 675 megawatt coal-fired power plant located in Somerset, New York. The railroad was built in 1983 by the New York State Electric and Gas Co. using new and old rights of way. From Lockport, New York, it runs on the defunct International Railway Co. (IRC) interurban line opened in 1900 under the name Buffalo, Lockport &amp; Olcott Beach (BL&amp;OB) which became part of the IRC in 1902. From Newfane, New York, the SOM sweeps off the IRC (abandoned in 1937) to the Hojack Line in Appleton, New York (Township of Newfane, Niagara County, NY), to West Somerset in the Town of Somerset. It then swings off on new trackage to a series of spurs and a loop at the Kintigh Generating Station.

Although the Somerset Railroad owned 428 rotary-dump gondola cars, CSX provided their motive power and operated the railroad. Prior to the acquisition of Conrail by Norfolk Southern and CSX in 1998, Conrail provided motive power. The Somerset Railroad right of way includes 15.59 miles (25 km) of trackage, known as the Somerset Secondary. Unit coal trains leaving from Youngstown, Ohio, run to Erie, Pennsylvania, followed by Buffalo, then north to the Niagara Branch, where they swing off onto the Lockport Subdivision, and finally in Lockport onto the Somerset Secondary. Even though the Somerset Power Plant owned its own gondolas, CSXT Hoppers were a regular sight at the plant.

The coal cars were unloaded using a rotary car dumper at the power plant. Also on the line in Lockport is a chemical plant, Vanchlor, which receives Chlorine via the railroad. The first train on the line ran in November 1983. Power was provided by four Conrail GE B23-7s, with 1926 as the lead unit.

In March 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the Kintigh Generating Station would shut down. The Somerset plant closure was a direct result of Governor Andrew Cuomo&#x27;s plan to reduce carbon emissions in New York state. Electricity for the area is now purchased and delivered from power plants in Pennsylvania. Shortly after the plant closure, that October CSX filed for abandonment of the line as the plant was the only customer. In late spring 2022, the line was torn up by CSX from just past the chemical plant spur all the way to the power plant. This was the second time the Hojack right of way was abandoned. Prior to line abandonment, all Somerset rail cars were collected by CSX and sent to scrap, with a few remaining in other mixed services.

<doc id="589981" wikidata="Q1711253" url="?curid=589981" title="Franks Wild Years">
<text>Franks Wild Years is the tenth studio album by Tom Waits, released 1987 on Island Records. It is the third in a loose trilogy that began with &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;. Subtitled &quot;Un Operachi Romantico in Two Acts&quot;, the album contains songs written by Waits and collaborators (mainly his wife, Kathleen Brennan) for a play of the same name. The play had its world premiere at the Briar St. Theatre in Chicago, Illinois, on June 22, 1986, performed by the Steppenwolf Theatre Company. &quot;If I Have to Go&quot; was used in the play, but released only in 2006 on &quot;&quot;. The theme from &quot;If I Have to Go&quot; was used under the title &quot;Rat&#x27;s Theme&quot; in the documentary &quot;Streetwise&quot; as early as 1984. The title is derived from &quot;Frank&#x27;s Wild Years&quot;, a track from &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;.

==Background==
Per Steve Hochman, &quot;This rags-to-rags tale completes the trilogy that began with 1983&#x27;s &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; (featuring the song &#x27;Frank&#x27;s Wild Years,&#x27; in which the protagonist torches his suburban SoCal house and heads north on the Hollywood Freeway). Then came 1985&#x27;s &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;, which mixed Brecht-Weill drama with Captain Beefheart bizarreness for an effect that conjured up a Saturday-night fish fry in the freak show of a decrepit circus... The story basically follows Frank on a hazy, ill-fated Orphic journey &#x27;Straight to the Top (Vegas)&#x27; (as one song is titled) through &#x27;Temptation,&#x27; &#x27;Way Down in the Hole&#x27; and, finally, out on the &#x27;Cold Cold Ground.&#x27; At the road&#x27;s end lies &#x27;Innocent When You Dream (78),&#x27; a moral that is told to Frank early on but doesn&#x27;t hit home until the end, when it is heard in a lovely, tinnily nostalgic rendition.

==Critical reception==
The album ranked number 5 among &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; for 1987 in the annual &quot;NME&quot; critics&#x27; poll. 

AllMusic notes the &quot;spare, stripped-down arrangements consisting of instruments like marimba, baritone horn, and pump organ and singing in a strained voice that has been artificially compressed and distorted. The songs themselves often are conventional romantic vignettes, or would be minus the oddities of instrumentation, arrangement, and performance. For example, &#x27;Innocent When You Dream,&#x27; a song of disappointment in love and friendship, has a winning melody, but it is played in a seesaw arrangement of pump organ, bass, violin, and piano, and Waits sings it like an enraged drunk. (He points out the arbitrary nature of the arrangements by repeating &#x27;Straight to the Top,&#x27; done as a demented rhumba in act one, as a Vegas-style Frank Sinatra swing tune in act two.)

Elvis Costello included &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot; on his list of essential albums, highlighting &quot;Hang On St. Christopher&quot; and &quot;Innocent When You Dream&quot;.

==Influence==
Various versions of &quot;Way Down in the Hole&quot; were used as the theme music for the HBO series &quot;The Wire&quot;, including Waits&#x27; original version for the second season. &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;Cold Cold Ground&quot; were used in Jean-Claude Lauzon&#x27;s &quot;Léolo&quot; (1992). &quot;Cold Cold Ground&quot; was also used in the series &quot;&quot;. &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;Straight to the Top (Vegas)&quot; featured in &quot;&quot; (2005), and &quot;Innocent When You Dream&quot; featured in &quot;Smoke&quot; (1995). &quot;Yesterday Is Here&quot; appears in &quot;The Night Shift&quot;, the second episode of &quot;Poker Face&quot;.

Jim Sclavunos recalls that &quot;For the better part of a year after its release, &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot; was the nightly go-to-pump-up album for me and my roommate. Gussying ourselves up to war-song strains of &#x27;Temptation&#x27;, &#x27;Straight to the Top&#x27; etc was an essential part of our ritual of getting ourselves &#x27;in the mood&#x27; before emerging from the squalor of our Lower East Side tenement, ready to take on the world.&quot;

Diana Krall covered &quot;Temptation&quot; on her 2004 album &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot;. Her version was also released as a CD single.

<doc id="589991" wikidata="Q157658" url="?curid=589991" title="Oenothera">
<text>Oenothera is a genus of about 145 species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas. It is the type genus of the family Onagraceae. Common names include evening primrose, suncups, and sundrops. They are not closely related to the true primroses (genus &quot;Primula&quot;).

==Description==
The species vary in size from small alpine plants 10 centimeters tall, such as &quot;O. acaulis&quot; from Chile, to vigorous lowland species growing to 3 meters, such as &quot;O. stubbei&quot; from Mexico. The leaves form a basal rosette at ground level and spiral up to the flowering stems. The blades are dentate or deeply lobed (pinnatifid). The flowers of many species open in the evening, hence the name &quot;evening primrose&quot;. They may open in under a minute. Most species have yellow flowers, but some have white, purple, pink, or red. Most native desert species are white. &quot;Oenothera caespitosa&quot;, a species of western North America, produces white flowers that turn pink with age.
One of the most distinctive features of the flower is the stigma, which has four branches in an X shape.

==Ecology==
&quot;Oenothera&quot; flowers are pollinated by insects, such as moths and bees. Like many other members of the Onagraceae, however, the pollen grains are loosely held together by viscin threads, so only insects that are morphologically specialized to gather this pollen can effectively pollinate the flowers. Bees with typical scopa cannot hold it. Also, the flowers open at a time when most bee species are inactive, so the bees which visit &quot;Oenothera&quot; are generally vespertine temporal specialists: bees that forage in the evening. The seeds ripen from late summer to fall.

&quot;Oenothera&quot; are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the large white-lined sphinx (&quot;Hyles lineata&quot;). The flower moths &quot;Schinia felicitata&quot; and &quot;S. florida&quot; both feed exclusively on the genus, and the former is limited to &quot;O. deltoides&quot;.

In the wild, some species of evening primrose act as primary colonizers, quickly appearing in recently cleared areas. They germinate in disturbed soils, and can be found in habitat types such as dunes, roadsides, railway embankments, and waste areas. They are often casual and are eventually out competed by other species.

Based on observations of evening primroses (&quot;O. drummondii&quot;), a study discovered that within minutes of sensing the sound waves of nearby bee wings through flower petals, the concentration of the sugar in the plant&#x27;s nectar was increased by an average of 20 percent. Experiments were also conducted on flowers with the petals removed. No change in nectar production was noted, indicating that it is indeed the flowers that have the job of the ears.

==Origin==
The genus &quot;Oenothera&quot; may have originated in Mexico and Central America, and spread farther north in North America and into South America. With the advent of international travel, species are now found in most temperate regions of the world. In Europe alone there are about 70 introduced species of &quot;Oenothera&quot;. During the Pleistocene era a succession of ice ages swept down across North America, with intervening warm periods. This occurred four times, and the genus experienced four separate waves of colonization, each hybridizing with the survivors of previous waves. This formed the present-day subsection &quot;Euoenothera&quot;. The group is genetically and morphologically diverse and the species are largely interfertile, so the species boundaries have been disputed amongst taxonomists.

==Genetics==

The pattern of repeated colonizations resulted in a unique genetic conformation in the &quot;Euoenothera&quot; whereby the chromosomes at meiosis can form circles rather than pairs. This is the result of several reciprocal translocations between chromosomes such that the pairing occurs only at the tips. This phenomenon apparently has non-Mendelian genetic consequences; with this mode of chromosome segregation and a system of balanced-lethal genes, genetic recombination is prevented and the plants display the hybrid vigor of heterosis. This resulted in the evolution of many sympatric races in North America east of the Rocky Mountains. Analysis of the cytology of these races and of artificial hybrids between them increased understanding of the genetic and geographic evolution of the &quot;Euoenothera&quot;. This subject was a major area of genetic research during the first half of the 20th century.

The appearance of sudden changes in &quot;Oenothera lamarckiana&quot; led the pioneering geneticist Hugo de Vries to propose what he called &quot;mutation theory&quot; in 1901 (&quot;Mutationstheorie&quot; in the German the original article was written in). This asserted that speciation was driven by sudden large mutations able to produce new varieties in a single step. The understanding that the observed changes in hybrids of the plant were caused by chromosome duplications (polyploidy) rather than gene mutation did not come until much later.

==Taxonomy==

Evening primroses were originally assigned to the genus &quot;Onagra&quot;, which gave the family Onagraceae its name. &quot;Onagra&quot; &#x27;[food of] onager&#x27; was first used in botany in 1587, and in English in Philip Miller&#x27;s 1754 &quot;Gardeners Dictionary: Abridged&quot;. The modern name &quot;Oenothera&quot; was published by Carolus Linnaeus in his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Its etymology is uncertain, but it is believed to be derived from the Greek words οίνος θήρα (&quot;oinos thera&quot;) &#x27;wine seeker&#x27;.

The genus is divided into 18 sections and additionally into several subsections and series.

==Dietary uses and side effects ==
Certain &quot;Oenothera&quot; plants have edible parts. The roots of &quot;O. biennis&quot; are reportedly edible in young plants. So are the flowers which have a sweet, crunchy taste. 

The common evening primrose, &quot;O. biennis&quot;, is commonly sold as a dietary supplement in capsules containing the seed oil. The main phytochemical in this evening primrose seed oil is gamma-linolenic acid.

There is no high-quality scientific evidence that &quot;O. biennis&quot; or evening primrose oil has any effect on human diseases or promotion of health, and specifically no evidence that it is effective to treat atopic dermatitis or cancer. Research indicates that orally-administered evening primrose oil does not relieve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, and does not have an effect on shortening the length of pregnancy or labor.

Consuming evening primrose oil may cause headache or stomach upset, may increase the risk of complications during pregnancy, and may increase the risk of bleeding in people given prescription drugs as anticoagulants, such as warfarin.

== Cultivation ==
A number of perennial members of the genus are commonly cultivated and used in landscaping in the southwestern United States. Popular species include tufted evening primrose (&quot;Oenothera caespitosa&quot;), Mexican evening primrose (&quot;Oenothera berlanderii&quot;), and Saltillo evening primrose (&quot;Oenothera stubbei&quot;).

Annual evening primroses are also popular ornamental plants in gardens. Many are fairly drought-resistant.

The first plants to arrive in Europe reached Padua from Virginia in 1614 and were described by the English botanist John Goodyer in 1621. Some species are now also naturalized in parts of Europe and Asia, and can be grown as far north as 65°N in Finland. The UK National Council for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens, based at Wisley, maintains an &quot;Oenothera&quot; collection as part of its National Collections scheme.

<text>David Leo Diamond (July 9, 1915 – June 13, 2005) was an American composer of classical music. He is considered one of the preeminent American composers of his generation. Many of his works are tonal or modestly modal. His early compositions are typically triadic, often with widely spaced harmonies, giving them a distinctly American tone, but some of his works are consciously French in style. His later style became more chromatic.

==Life and career==
He was born in Rochester, New York, and studied at the Cleveland Institute of Music and the Eastman School of Music under Bernard Rogers, also receiving lessons from Roger Sessions in New York City and Nadia Boulanger in Paris. He won a number of awards including three Guggenheim Fellowships.

Diamond&#x27;s most popular piece is &quot;Rounds&quot; (1944) for string orchestra. Among his other works are eleven symphonies (the last in 1993), concertos including three for violin, eleven string quartets, music for wind ensemble, other chamber music, piano pieces and vocal music.

He composed the musical theme heard on the CBS Radio Network broadcast &quot;Hear It Now&quot; (1950–51) and its TV successor, &quot;See It Now&quot; (1951–58).

Diamond was named honorary composer-in-residence of the Seattle Symphony. He was a longtime member of the Juilliard School faculty, his notable students including Alan Belkin, Robert Black, Kenneth Fuchs, Albert Glinsky, Daron Hagen, Adolphus Hailstork, Anthony Iannaccone, Philip Lasser, Lowell Liebermann, Alasdair MacLean, Charles Strouse, Francis Thorne, Kendall Durelle Briggs and Eric Whitacre. Diamond is also credited with advising Glenn Gould on his mid-career work, most notably his String Quartet, Op. 1.

In 1995, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. In 1991 he was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal.

Diamond was openly gay long before it was socially acceptable, and believed his career was slowed by homophobia and antisemitism. According to an obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; however, &quot;He enjoyed enormous success in the 1940s and early &#x27;50s with champions that included Koussevitzky, Bernstein, Munch, Ormandy and Mitropoulos but, in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, the serial and modernist schools pushed him into the shadows.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; similarly referred to Diamond as &quot;a major American composer whose early brilliance in the 1940s was eclipsed by the dominance of atonal music... He was part of what some considered a forgotten generation of great American symphonists, including Howard Hanson, Roy Harris, William Schuman, Walter Piston and Peter Mennin.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; also suggested that Diamond&#x27;s career troubles may have also been caused by his &quot;difficult personality... he said in the 1990 interview, &#x27;I was a highly emotional young man, very honest in my behavior, and I would say things in public that would cause a scene between me and, for instance, a conductor.&#x27;&quot;

In 2005, Diamond died at his home in Brighton, Monroe County, New York, from heart failure.

<doc id="589997" wikidata="Q3138227" url="?curid=589997" title="Silicon Fen">
<text>Silicon Fen or the Cambridge Cluster is a collective name given to high tech businesses focused on software, electronics, and biotechnology, including Arm and AstraZeneca, in and around the city of Cambridge in England.

The name &quot;Silicon Fen&quot; originated as an analogy with Silicon Valley in California because Cambridge lies at the southern tip of the Fens. The local growth in technology companies started with Sinclair Research and Acorn Computers.

==Business growth==
More than 1,000 high-technology companies established offices in the area during the five years preceding 1998. Some early successful businesses were Advanced RISC Machines and Cambridge Display Technology. In 2004, 24% of all UK venture capital, representing 8% of all venture capital in the European Union, was received by Silicon Fen companies, according to the Cambridge Cluster Report 2004 produced by Library House and Grant Thornton.

The so-called Cambridge phenomenon, which gave rise to start-up companies in a town that previously had only light industry in the electrical sector, is usually dated to the founding of the Cambridge Science Park in 1970 as an initiative of Trinity College at the University of Cambridge.

The characteristic of Cambridge is small companies in sectors such as computer-aided design. They are spread over an area defined by the CB postcode or 01223 telephone area code, or more generously in an area bounded by Ely, Newmarket, Saffron Walden, Royston, and Huntingdon.

In 2000, then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown set up a research partnership between MIT and Cambridge University, the Cambridge–MIT Institute, in order to increase international collaboration between the two universities and strengthen the economic success of Silicon Fen.

In February 2006, Cambridge Judge Business School reported estimates that there were approximately 250 active start-ups directly linked to the university, valued at roughly US$6 billion. Several of these companies have grown into multinationals, including Arm, Autonomy Corporation, AVEVA, and Cambridge Silicon Radio.

In 2012, it was reported that strong employment growth in the Silicon Fen hub was hampered due to its significant concentration on research and development, which was limiting competition in manufacturing and costs.

Cambridge Ahead, the business and academic membership organisation dedicated to the long-term growth of the city and its region, reported in 2015–16, that growth of Cambridge companies was approximately 7% over one, three, and five-year durations. Global turnover of Cambridge companies increased by 7.6% to £35.7bn, up from £33bn the previous year, and global employment grew by 7.6% to 210,292. The number of companies headquartered within 20 miles of Cambridge grew from 22,017 to 24,580.

==Area characteristics==
The Cambridge Network is an organization facilitating networking in the area.

Other possible factors include a high standard of living available in the county, and good transport links, for example to London and with Cambridge Airport having a full service business jet centre. Many graduates from the university choose to stay on in the area, giving local companies a rich pool of talent to draw upon. The high-technology industry has little by way of competition, unlike say in Oxfordshire where many other competing industries exist. Cambridgeshire has only recently become a high-technology centre, which has meant that commercial rents were generally lower than in other parts of the UK and thus giving companies a head-start on those situated in other more expensive regions. However, the recent technology boom has changed the situation and Cambridgeshire now ranks as one of the highest costs of living in the UK outside London, which is home to an even bigger technology centre.

<text>James Macnaghten McGarel-Hogg, 1st Baron Magheramorne, KCB (3 May 1823 – 27 June 1890), was a British politician, Member of Parliament, and local government leader.

==Early life==
James Macnaghten Hogg was born in Calcutta on 3 May 1823 into an Ulster-Scots family, being the son of Sir James Weir Hogg, 1st Baronet, and the former Mary Swinton. His father was the Administrator-General of Bengal and Chairman of the British East India Company. Among his large immediate family were Isabella Hogg (wife of Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth), Florence Hogg (wife of George William Campbell), Charles Swinton Hogg (who married Harriet Anne Stirling, daughter of Sir Walter Stirling, 2nd Baronet), Mary Rosina Hogg (wife of Charles McGarel of Magheramorne), Fergusson Floyer Hogg (who married Elizabeth Helen Parsons, a granddaughter of the 2nd Earl of Rosse), Annie Claudina Hogg (who never married), Sir Stuart Saunders Hogg (who married Selina Catherine Perry, daughter of Sir Thomas Erskine Perry), Sir Frederick Russell Hogg (who married Emily Eckford and Harriett Venn Dicken, sister-in-law of the 5th Marquess of Sligo), Amy Hogg (who married James William MacNabb), Stapleton Cotton Hogg (the Assistant Finance Secretary, India Office), Constance Hogg (who married Francis Augustus Bevan), and Quintin Hogg (who married Alice Anna Graham). 

His paternal grandparents were William Hogg and Mary (née Dickey) Hogg (a James Dickey of Dunmore, County Antrim). His maternal grandparents were Isabella (née Routledge) Swinton and Samuel Swinton of Swinton House, Swinton, Berwickshire.

He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford but left Oxford early without taking his degree to enter the Army and became a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Life Guards, part of the Household Cavalry. 

==Career==
On retiring from the Army he went into politics, being elected unopposed as a Conservative MP for Bath in 1865.

He was also a member of St. George, Hanover Square Vestry, a form of local government similar to a parish council. From 1867 he was chosen by the Vestry to represent them on the Metropolitan Board of Works which co-ordinated cross-London building schemes. He was defeated for re-election in Bath in 1868 and concentrated on his work on the Board, and after the death of Sir John Thwaites who had chaired the Board since it was created, he was elected as the new chairman on 18 November 1870. Hogg was elected MP for Truro in an 1871 byelection and retained that seat until he transferred to Hornsey at the 1885 general election.

His Parliamentary duties made it more difficult for Hogg to be a full-time chairman of the board. While his predecessor had dismissed staff who he felt were not up to the job, Hogg used his influence to try to keep their jobs safe. Unlike Thwaites, he did not look in detail at the work of the staff but let them get on with their work. This meant that departments within the Board became either very efficient, or very inefficient. The Architects department was particularly noted for inefficiency.

Several of the Board&#x27;s big schemes were just being completed when McGarel-Hogg&#x27;s Chairmanship began. The Victoria Embankment had been opened shortly before he was elected, and he got to share in the rewards for the Board&#x27;s successes, being made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1874 when the Chelsea Embankment was opened. Under McGarel-Hogg, the Board bought up all of the bridges over the Thames and freed them of tolls. However, the Board&#x27;s desire for a new bridge by Little Tower Hill could not be fulfilled because its revenue source was not secure. Tower Bridge was eventually built by the City of London Corporation.

The Board also acquired the power to clear slums in 1875, but found the process cumbersome and expensive, resulting in small progress (although it accelerated when further Acts of Parliament removed some restrictions). Several parks were also bought by the Board and opened to the public. However, McGarel-Hogg&#x27;s administration was hit by scandal in 1887 over the sale of surplus land, blighting somewhat the award of a peerage in the celebrations of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. A Royal Commission found officers and two members of the Board guilty of malpractice. This resulted in the decision to abolish the Board and replace it with a directly elected council.

Magheramorne had fought for the Board to get permission to build a tunnel at Blackwall and it had been granted in 1887. The tenders for the contract came in early in 1889, when the London County Council had been elected but was not yet in control. He was determined to grant the contract through the Board and resisted the LCC&#x27;s request that it leave the decision to them; however, when the LCC discovered the Board&#x27;s intention to seal the contracts, they appealed to the Government and the Board was abolished on 21 March 1889.

He died a year after leaving office at the MBW.

==Personal life==

On 31 August 1857, Hogg was married to Hon. Caroline Elizabeth Emma Douglas-Pennant (–1924), the daughter of Edward Gordon Douglas-Pennant, 1st Baron Penrhyn and Juliana Isabella Mary Dawkins-Pennant (a daughter of George Hay Dawkins-Pennant). Together, they were the parents of: 

* Hon. Edith Mary McGarel-Hogg (1859–1939), who married Hon. Arthur Saumarez, son of Col. John Saumarez, 3rd Baron de Saumarez and Margaret Antoinette Northey, in 1881. 
* James Douglas McGarel-Hogg, 2nd Baron Magheramorne (1861–1903), who married Lady Evelyn Harriet Ashley-Cooper, daughter of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 8th Earl of Shaftesbury and Lady Harriet Chichester (a daughter of the 3rd Marquess of Donegall), in 1889. 
* Dudley Stuart McGarel-Hogg, 3rd Baron Magheramorne (1863–1946), who died unmarried. 
* Ronald Tracey McGarel-Hogg, 4th Baron Magheramorne (1863–1957), who died unmarried. 
* Hon. Archibald Campbell McGarel-Hogg (1866–1945), an architect who died unmarried. 
* Hon. Gerald Francis McGarel-Hogg (1868–1942), a Lieutenant in the 4th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers who died unmarried. 

On 8 February 1877, he added the surname McGarel on inheriting the estates of his late brother-in-law Charles McGarel, the husband of his sister, Mary Rosina Hogg. 

He died in 1890, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. He was succeeded in his barony by his son James.

== History ==
&quot;Bidjara&quot; (also known as &quot;Bidyara, Pitjara,&quot; and &quot;Peechara&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Bidjara people. The Bidjara language region includes the local government area of the Shire of Murweh, particularly the towns of Charleville, Augathella and Blackall as well as the properties of Nive Downs and Mount Tabor.

&quot;Kuungkari&quot; (also known as Kungkari and Koonkerri) is a language of Western Queensland. The Kuungkari language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Longreach Region and Blackall-Tambo Region.

&quot;Gungabula&quot; (also known as &quot;Kongabula&quot; and &quot;Khungabula&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the headwaters of the Dawson River in Central Queensland. The language region includes areas within the local government area of Maranoa Region, particularly the towns of Charleville, Augathella and Blackall and as well as the Carnarvon Range.

The region was explored in 1846 by explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell and his party. In 1856, Augustus Gregory passed through the area noting that the landscape was a vast plain lacking vegetation, in contrast to Mitchell&#x27;s description of good country. Blackall was named by Surveyor Abraham H. May after Sir Samuel Blackall, the second Governor of Queensland. During the 1860s the town developed as a service centre for the surrounding pastoral properties. A survey of town allotments was conducted in 1868.

Barcoo Post Office opened on 1 April 1864. It was renamed Blackall in 1868.

Blackall State School opened on 10 September 1877. On 5 October 1964, the school was destroyed by fire, but was subsequently rebuilt.

On Tuesday 29 March 1881, following seven inches of rain, the river burst through the town embankment, completely washing away the stonework of the dam. On Wednesday 30 March, the still-rising river flooded the town&#x27;s main street and many people in the town&#x27;s lower-lying areas were forced to evacuate as their homes became fully submerged.

Blackall was one of the first Queensland towns to sink an artesian bore in 1885. It supplies the town with water from the Great Artesian Basin. The water temperature is 58 degrees Celsius. There is an artesian spa bath at the aquatic centre and locally produced soft drinks are made from the artesian water.

The first Methodist church in Blackall opened on Easter Sunday 13 April 1884. On Thursday 23 January 1913 a new Methodist church opened. The present church building (now the Blackall Uniting Church) was established –1958.

Blackall claims to be the home of the original Black Stump, which marks the original Astro Station established in 1887. Places west of this point are said to be &#x27;beyond the black stump&#x27;. The Black Stump was moved from its original location to make it more accessible to tourists, and can now be found on the boundary of the Blackall State School grounds, Thistle Street, Blackall. Blackall has many attractions for public use and entertainment, including the Blackall showground, the local pool and the historic Blackall Woolscour.

In December 1890 the Australian Labour Federation&#x27;s executive met in Blackall to draw up plans for a proper organisational structure for the Labour Party. Four years earlier, in December 1886, the first meeting of the first shearers&#x27; union, which later became the Australian Labor Party, took place in Blackall. This is commemorated by the Australian Labor Federation Memorial in Short Street.

In Australian folklore, the best known citizen of the town was the sheep shearer Jack Howe. In 1892, he shore a total of 321 sheep at Alice Downs station in 7 hours and 40 minutes, a record for hand shearing that still stands, and was only broken by a shearer using a machine driven handpiece in 1950.

The Blackall and Yaraka railway line branched off from the Central Western railway at Jericho. The line opened to Blackall in 1908 and ran all the way to Yaraka. the Jericho – Yaraka branch line closed on 14 October 2005 and has since been dismantled. Former stations on the line (now all abandoned) within the locality were (from Jericho heading south):

* Ballast railway siding ()
* Lancevale railway station ()
* Yalleroi railway station ()
*Glenusk railway station ()
* Sandy Creek railway siding ()
* Blackall Wool Scour railway siding ()
*Blackall railway station ()
*Glenstuart railway station ()
* Malvernton railway station ()
*Benlidi railway station ()
*Mekaree railway station ()

St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School was established in 1917 by the Sisters of St Joseph. The opening ceremonies were conducted on Saturday 21 July 1917 by Archbishop James Duhig.

The Blackall War Memorial commemorates those soldiers who died in World War I. The memorial was dedicated on 25 April (Anzac Day) 1927 by James Charles Minnis (former mayor of Blackall and a former soldier). The honour roll of those who died in World War II was added later.

According to information published by the Blackall Shire Council, the Cominos opened a café in the 1920s in Shamrock Street, Blackall which they called the Central. A few years later it was taken over by the Logos Brothers who installed a newsagency at one side. The Queensland Country Women&#x27;s Association met at the cafe to farewell their secretary Mrs R.A.G. Malcolm in September 1929.

Blackall Ambulance commenced operations in November 1923 led by Superintendent W.J. King (from Rockhampton). On 15 October 1927 the first permanent building was officially opened by the Mick Kirwan (the Queensland Minister for Public Works) assisted by Frank Bulcock, the local member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Barcoo. On 14 April 1984 the current building in Coronation Drive was officially opened by Roy Hauff.

<text>Andrew John Partridge (born 11 November 1953) is an English guitarist, singer-songwriter and record producer best known for co-founding the band XTC. He and Colin Moulding each acted as a songwriter and frontman for XTC, with Partridge writing and singing about two-thirds of the group&#x27;s material. While XTC were a formative British new wave group, Partridge&#x27;s songwriting drew heavily from 1960s pop and psychedelia and his style gradually shifted to more traditional pop, often with pastoral themes. The band&#x27;s only UK top 10 hit, &quot;Senses Working Overtime&quot;, was written by Partridge.

Partridge is sometimes regarded as the &quot;godfather&quot; of the 1990s Britpop movement. Since the 1980s, he has worked, written with or produced for many other recording artists, including collaborative albums with Peter Blegvad, Harold Budd and Robyn Hitchcock. From 2002 to 2006, Partridge&#x27;s APE House record label released several volumes of his demos and songs as part of the &quot;Fuzzy Warbles&quot; series. Beyond music, he is also an illustrator, toy soldier hobbyist and designer of board games.

==Early life==
Andrew John Partridge was born 11 November 1953 at Mtarfa Royal Navy Hospital in Mtarfa, Malta to English parents. He grew up on Penhill council estate in Swindon, Wiltshire. Partridge was an only child. His father John was a navy signalman, and his mother Vera a shop assistant in a retail chemists. When Partridge entered adolescence, it was discovered that his father was having an extramarital affair, and his mother consequently had a nervous breakdown, leading to her being institutionalised. She &quot;verbally disowned&quot; Andy once he started growing his hair long.

As a teenager, Partridge was a fan of contemporary pop groups like the Beatles, but was intimidated by the process of learning guitar. When the Monkees grew popular, he became interested in joining a music group. He recalled watching local guitarist Dave Gregory performing Jimi Hendrix-style songs at churches and youth clubs: &quot;Sort of acid-skiffle. I thought, &#x27;Ah, one day I&#x27;ll play guitar!&#x27; But I didn&#x27;t think I would be in the same band as this kid on the stage.&quot; He was particularly fond of psychedelic records such as Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;See Emily Play&quot; (1967), Tomorrow&#x27;s &quot;My White Bicycle&quot; (1967), and the Moles&#x27; &quot;We Are the Moles&quot; (1968). The first records he ever bought were the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967) and the Monkees&#x27; self-titled debut (1966).

Partridge eventually obtained a guitar, taught himself how to play it with no formal training, and immediately took to writing songs. He submitted a caricature of Monkee Micky Dolenz to &quot;Monkees Monthly&quot;″s Draw a Monkee competition and won, using the £10 prize to buy a Grundig tape recorder. At the age of 15, he wrote his first song, titled &quot;Please Help Me&quot;, and while in Swindon College attracted the nickname &quot;Rocky&quot; for his early guitar mastery of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot;. Partridge eventually dropped out of school and formed the first of several &quot;loud and horrid&quot; rock bands with the purpose of meeting girls.

By the early 1970s, his music tastes had accordingly transitioned &quot;from the Monkees to having a big binge on this Euro-avant-garde stuff. I got really in deep.&quot; One of his first bands was called &quot;Stiff Beach&quot;, formed in August 1970. In early 1972, Partridge&#x27;s constantly evolving group settled into a four-piece called &quot;Star Park&quot;. By then, he had found a job at a record shop and was engrossed with bands such as the Stooges, the New York Dolls, Alice Cooper, and Pink Fairies.

==XTC==


In late 1972, Partridge&#x27;s Star Park was joined by bassist Colin Moulding and drummer Terry Chambers. The band became known as XTC in 1975 and signed to Virgin Records in 1977. Partridge wrote the majority of XTC&#x27;s songs, was the band&#x27;s frontman and de facto leader, and in Moulding&#x27;s view, typically acted as an &quot;executive producer&quot; for their albums. His early XTC songs were marked by his distinct singing style, something he jokingly described as a &quot;walrus&quot; or &quot;seal bark&quot;, but otherwise an amalgamation of Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;hiccup&quot;, Elvis Presley&#x27;s vibrato, and &quot;the howled mannerisms of Steve Harley.&quot; He later dismissed most of his initial output as premature songs &quot;built around this electric wordplay stuff&quot;.

While XTC were a formative punk group, Partridge&#x27;s music drew heavily from British Invasion songwriters, and his style gradually shifted to more traditional pop, often with pastoral themes. Music critic John Harris said that Partridge exemplified &quot;a very English genre: rock music uprooted from the glamour and dazzle of the city, and recast as the soundtrack to life in suburbs, small towns, and the kind of places – like Swindon – that may be more sizeable, but are still held up as bywords for broken hopes and limited horizons.&quot; He cited Partridge&#x27;s 1981 song &quot;Respectable Street&quot; as one of the &quot;most evocative items&quot; in his catalog.

In 1982, as XTC were about to headline a tour of the United States in support of &quot;English Settlement&quot;, they permanently withdrew from concert touring after Partridge suffered an onstage nervous breakdown and remained a studio-only band from then on. For a period afterward, it was rumoured among fans and industry insiders that the group had stopped performing because Partridge had died, and some American bands put on XTC tribute shows in his remembrance. The group ran into more problems once it was discovered that poor management led to them incurring hundreds of thousands in unpaid value-added taxes. Partridge said that he was eventually left with &quot;about £300 in the bank, which is really heavy when you&#x27;ve got a family and everyone thinks you&#x27;re &#x27;Mr Rich and Famous&#x27;.&quot;

In December 1984, Partridge formed the Dukes of Stratosphear, a neo-psychedelic XTC offshoot that he envisioned as a pastiche of &quot;your favourite bands from 1967&quot;. They recorded the mini-album &quot;25 O&#x27;Clock&quot; (1985) and the LP &quot;Psonic Psunspot&quot; (1987), both of which outsold XTC&#x27;s concurrent studio albums (&quot;The Big Express&quot; and &quot;Skylarking&quot;) in the UK. Around this time, Partridge also established himself as a producer of other artists. However, Virgin Records refused to allow XTC to act as their own producers, which sometimes caused tensions between Partridge and whoever was assigned to produce the band. According to Partridge, he generally got along with the band&#x27;s producers, except for Todd Rundgren on &quot;Skylarking&quot; and Gus Dudgeon on 1992&#x27;s &quot;Nonsuch&quot;.

In the 1990s, Partridge was regarded as &quot;godfather&quot; to the nascent Britpop movement due to his earlier work with XTC. They released several more albums on Virgin and two more on their own label, Idea Records, before going on hiatus in 2006. In July 2008, Partridge wrote in the &quot;Swindon Advertiser&quot; that XTC had dissolved &quot;for reasons too personal and varied to go into here, but we had a good run as they say and produced some real good work.&quot;

Partridge has stated that his favourite XTC album was &quot;Nonsuch&quot; (1992), and considered &quot;Rook&quot; and &quot;Wrapped in Grey&quot; from that album, along with &quot;Easter Theatre&quot; from &quot;Apple Venus Volume 1&quot; (1999), to be the &quot;perfect songs&quot; of his career. For many years, he also regarded &quot;Seagulls Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her&quot; from &quot;The Big Express&quot; as his finest song.

Since XTC&#x27;s breakup, Partridge has acted as curator to the band&#x27;s legacy, overseeing reissues and remasters, and maintaining a web presence. The official XTC Twitter account @xtcfans (now defunct) was originally managed by writer Todd Bernhardt, but Partridge later &quot;sort of took it over, because [he] thought it was weird that there was another person in the way.&quot; In 2016, Partridge and Bernhardt released a book, &quot;Complicated Game: Inside the Songs of XTC&quot;, that contains discussions between the two about 29 XTC songs, one Partridge solo track, and an overview of his approach to songwriting. It was published by Jawbone Press.

==Solo work and collaborations==

Since the 1980s, Partridge has worked, written with, or produced many other musicians and bands, including Peter Blegvad, the Lilac Time, the Nines, Miles Kane, David Yazbek, Voice of the Beehive, the Woodentops, the Wallflowers, Perennial Divide, the Raiders, and Charlotte Hatherley.

===1980s===
In 1980, Partridge and producer John Leckie released a collection of XTC dub remixes on Virgin Records called &quot;Take Away / The Lure of Salvage&quot;, credited to &quot;Mr. Partridge&quot;. Even though no other XTC member was involved with the album&#x27;s production, he does not consider it a solo effort. Virgin Records rejected his request to issue it under the XTC banner as it would have counted toward their record contract. In Japan, the record was hailed as a work of &quot;electronic genius&quot; and outsold all other XTC albums.

Also in 1980, Partridge contributed guitar to Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s album &quot;B-2 Unit&quot; and lead vocals and guitar to the track &quot;Margaret Freeman&quot; from The Residents&#x27; &quot;Commercial Album&quot;, on which he was credited as &quot;Sandy Sandwich&quot;.

Partridge&#x27;s first job producing another artist was Peter Blegvad&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;The Naked Shakespeare&quot;. He said that his services were requested partly because Blegvad had heard a rumour that he had died in 1982.

===1990s===
In 1992, Partridge produced unreleased recordings for Blur&#x27;s album &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; (1993). He was replaced by Stephen Street at the insistence of their record label, Food. According to Partridge, he was not paid for the expenses and received his session payment only. Three of the tracks he produced were later released on the 2012 box set &quot;Blur 21&quot;.

In 1993, Partridge recorded and produced an album with Martin Newell, &quot;The Greatest Living Englishman&quot;. When released in Japan, it was credited as a duo album. The album was well received by critics and ultimately became the most acclaimed of Newell&#x27;s career. Partridge also wrote four songs for Disney&#x27;s version of &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; (1996), but was replaced by Randy Newman due to creative differences between director Henry Selick and Disney regarding the choice of soundtrack composer and the fact that Disney wanted to own the copyright to the songs for perpetuity.

Partridge took on less work as a music producer after the 1990s. He stated in a 2007 interview: &quot;I got asked regularly to produce people, but I said no to everybody; after a while, people just stopped asking. I got sick of the social-worker aspect of it. I found it had very little to do with music ... I also think it&#x27;s kind of odd that everyone wants to sound like 1979 again.&quot;

===2000s===
From 2002 to 2006, Partridge released demos of his songs under his own name as part of the &quot;Fuzzy Warbles&quot; album series on his APE House record label. Eight volumes of &quot;Fuzzy Warbles&quot; were made available, as well as &quot;The Official Fuzzy Warbles Collector&#x27;s Album&quot;, which includes a bonus ninth disc &quot;Hinges&quot;. Partridge said that the impetus for the project was the proliferation of bootleggers who were selling low-quality copies of the material. He added that the &quot;Fuzzy Warbles&quot; set earned him more money than XTC&#x27;s back catalog on Virgin.

In 2007, Partridge released music as part of a trio known as Monstrance, along with Barry Andrews (an early member of XTC) on keyboards, and Martyn Barker on drums. The group has released an album of the same name, as well as a download-only EP known as &quot;Fine Wires Humming a New Song&quot;. That same year, he collaborated once again with Andrews on the Shriekback album &quot;Glory Bumps&quot;.

===2010s–2020s===
In 2010, Partridge released a limited edition CD of music inspired by science fiction illustrator Richard M. Powers&#x27; art titled &quot;Powers&quot;. In 2012, he contributed eight co-written songs to Mike Keneally&#x27;s album &quot;Wing Beat Fantastic&quot;. In 2016, he wrote &quot;You Bring the Summer&quot; for the Monkees&#x27; reunion album &quot;Good Times!&quot;; the 2018 follow-up, &quot;Christmas Party&quot;, included his &quot;Unwrap You at Christmas&quot;. He became involved with the reunion project through the band&#x27;s manager, a former journalist who sought to repay Partridge for an interview conducted decades earlier.

In 2019, Partridge and Robyn Hitchcock completed the 13-years-in-the-making EP &quot;Planet England&quot;. In September, it was reported that the project would later be followed with a full-length LP of songs inspired by the Beatles. As of 2020, Partridge was working on recording versions of &quot;hundreds of songs&quot; that he originally wrote for other artists over the years. He said he would release them as &quot;a series of records tentatively titled &quot;My Failed Songwriting Career&quot;&quot;.

On July 23, 2021, Partridge released Volume 1 of &#x27;My Failed Songwriting Career&#x27; through Burning Shed Records. Tracks included on the EP were &#x27;Ghost Train&#x27;, &#x27;Great Day&#x27;, &#x27;Maid Of Stars&#x27; and &#x27;The Mating Dance&#x27;. In October 2022, he released &#x27;My Failed Christmas Career&#x27;, a collection of seasonal songs written for other artists. That same month, Partridge gave a rare interview in which he stated he has retired from writing new music. In June 2023, Partridge emerged to release a four-song EP with The 3 Clubmen (Partridge, Jen Olive, and Stu Rowe). A project in the works since 2010, Partridge has stated that a future 3 Clubmen release is planned.

==Other activities==
Many of the XTC record sleeves were designed by Partridge and at one point he considered a career as a graphic illustrator. He remembered having an intense interest in comic books and the cover illustrations of science fiction novels as a child, particularly those drawn by Richard M. Powers. Until the late 1970s, he owned a large American comic book collection that he had to sell off due to a mouse infestation at his home. Some of his songs are based on characters from DC Comics, namely Sgt. Rock for &quot;Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)&quot; from &quot;Black Sea&quot;, Supergirl for &quot;That&#x27;s Really Super, Supergirl&quot; from &quot;Skylarking&quot; and Brainiac for &quot;Brainiac&#x27;s Daughter&quot; from &quot;Psonic Psunspot&quot;.

Beyond music, Partridge is an avid collector, sculptor, and painter of toy soldiers, an &quot;obsession&quot; he credits to his mother throwing away his toys as a child. In a 1990 interview, he estimated owning thousands of figures since he started collecting them in 1979, and he reported having recently contributed World War I-era designs to an unspecified &quot;firm that makes these war game figures in North England&quot;. He has also designed board games, such as one called &quot;Dam and Blast&quot;.

During the mid-1980s, Partridge was a regular performer on BBC Radio 1. He has had acting roles, including a character named &quot;Agony Andy&quot;, a spoof aunt on the Janice Long show, and he was a regular panelist on &quot;Roundtable&quot;. In 1987, he filmed a pilot for an ITV children&#x27;s quiz show, &quot;Matchmakers&quot;. In 2004, he contributed the theme song to the Fox television series &quot;Wonderfalls&quot;.

==Personal life==
Partridge was married to Marianne Wyborn from 1979 to 1994. Together, they had two children: Holly and Harry. Harry is an independent web animator who created the comedic short &quot;Saturday Morning Watchmen&quot; (2009), and later, &quot;Dr. Bees&quot;, &quot;Starbarians&quot; and &quot;Trilby Dogtooth&quot;. After his divorce, Partridge entered into a long-term relationship with American singer Erica Wexler. Partridge has attributed the subject matter of XTC songs including &quot;Seagulls Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her&quot; and &quot;Another Satellite&quot; to aspects of their ongoing relationship. Partridge had met Wexler in the early 1980s; they began dating shortly after she split from artist Roy Lichtenstein in 1994, and she has lived with him in Swindon since then.

The subject matter of Partridge&#x27;s songs frequently touch upon politics, religion, his hometown of Swindon, social class, factory work, insects, comic book characters, seafaring, war, and ancient rituals. Partridge did not become interested in politics until the 1979 United Kingdom general election, in which he voted for Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative Party &quot;purely because she was a woman. I was that naive. Now I&#x27;m very left.&quot; He also identifies as an atheist. 

On the back of the &quot;Apple Venus Volume 1&quot; (1999) record sleeve is a version of the Wiccan Rede: &quot;Do what you will but harm none.&quot; While stating that he only had &quot;a smattering of knowledge&quot; on Wicca, he described himself as &quot;interested in the pre-Christian appreciation of the land and the spirit of things, spirits in animate things and inanimate things&quot; in a contemporary interview. XTC&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Dear God&quot;, written by Partridge, was seen as controversial at the time for its anti-religious message; Partridge stated that the song failed to represent his true feelings on religion, as human belief is &quot;such a &quot;vast&quot; subject&quot;. Although an atheist, he believes that heaven and hell exist metaphorically. Another of his songs, &quot;Season Cycle&quot; (1986), included the couplet &quot;Everybody says, Join our religion, get to heaven / I say, no thanks, why bless my soul, I&#x27;m already there!&quot; Explaining the lyric &quot;do what you want to do / just don&#x27;t hurt nobody&quot; from his 1989 song &quot;Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;, he said: &quot;I&#x27;m sure .. what heaven is, really ... is not hurting anyone.&quot;

===Health===

Partridge experiences auditory synesthesia, which he uses in his songwriting process. In later interviews, he stated he believes himself to be on the autistic spectrum, saying in a 2022 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;I think I&#x27;m on the spectrum, yes, but it&#x27;s all helped me and I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way.&quot; He has also had obsessive–compulsive disorder since childhood. At the age of 12, he was professionally diagnosed with ADHD (known at the time as simply &quot;hyperactivity&quot;) and prescribed Valium. He later formed a dependency on the drug that was exacerbated by the pressures of his music career. After disposing of the drug in 1981, he experienced severe withdrawal effects that led to XTC&#x27;s withdrawal from touring.

In 1992, Partridge had an ear infection that left him temporarily deaf, and in 2006, during one of the sessions for &quot;Monstrance&quot;, some of his hearing was destroyed following a studio mishap which caused him to develop severe tinnitus. He later stated that he had &quot;contemplated suicide, just to stop [the tinnitus].&quot;

<text>Marianne Brandt (1 October 1893 – 18 June 1983) was a German painter, sculptor, photographer, metalsmith, and designer who studied at the Bauhaus art school in Weimar and later became head of the Bauhaus &quot;Metall-Werkstatt&quot; (Metal Workshop) in Dessau in 1928. Today, Brandt&#x27;s designs for household objects such as lamps and ashtrays are considered timeless examples of modern industrial design. Although she pursued painting early in life and attended a private art school and the Grand Ducal College of Art in Weimar from 1911–1917, where she produced many works in the Expressionists style and also studied sculpture, the artist is best known for her sleek and elegant industrial designs.Brandt also worked with photography at the Bauhaus, taking photographs that featured unusual angles—in particular, self-portraits—and disorienting and distorting reflections in glass and metal surfaces.She worked as head of the design department of the company Ruppelwerk Metallwarenfabrik GmbH in Gotha until 1932. In 1949, she worked at the University of Applied Arts (now the Berlin Weißensee School of Art) until 1954. In the year, 1954 she also supervised the exhibition &quot;The German applied art of the GDR&quot; in Beijing and Shanghai in 1953–54. She also created photomontages.

==Biography==
Brandt was born into a prominent family in Chemnitz as Marianne Liebe.
Brandt studied painting and sculpture at the Weimar Saxon Grand Ducal Art School from 1911 to 1917. In 1919 she married the Norwegian painter Erik Brandt. From 1919–1920 she and her husband lived abroad, first for a year in Norway, before embarking on a one-year study tour to Paris and the south of France. She studied and taught at the Bauhaus in Weimar and Dessau from 1923 to 1929. Between her studies at these two schools, Brandt worked as a freelance artist. She studied painting with the artists Fritz Mackensen and Robert Weise before studying sculpture with Robert Engelmann.
Although the Bauhaus claimed to welcome “any person of good repute, without regard to age or sex”, there was still a strong gender bias. László Moholy-Nagy was impressed by Brandt’s commitment and work, and so he offered her a spot in the Bauhaus metal workshop. She ultimately became the only woman to attain her degree in the metal workshop. Her fellow students later admitted to Brandt that they had believed that there was no place in the metal workshop for women and so gave her dull, dreary work to do; later they got along well. When Moholy-Nagy departed from his Bauhaus teaching post in 1928, Brandt replaced him as acting director of the workshop. She is thus credited by some as a pioneer for gender equity in the arts.

She trained as a painter before joining the Weimar Bauhaus in January of 1924, where she attended classes with Josef Albers, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee, among others, before joining the metal workshop in summer of the same year. There she became a student of Hungarian modernist theorist and designer László Moholy-Nagy. She quickly rose to the position of workshop assistant; when Moholy-Nagy left the Bauhaus in 1928, she became the workshop&#x27;s acting director, serving in the post for one year and negotiating some of the most important Bauhaus contracts for collaborations with industry. These contracts for the production of lights and other metal workshop designs were a rare example of one of the workshops helping to fund the school. One of her lasting contributions are the lamp fittings that she and designed for the Bauhaus building in Dessau. 

After leaving the Bauhaus for Berlin in 1929, Brandt worked for Walter Gropius in his Berlin studio. From late 1929 through 1932, Brandt was head of design at the Ruppel Metal Goods factory in Gotha, Germany, until she lost her job due to the ongoing Great Depression. 

Brandt’s interest in photography began in 1923 with a self-portrait, Selbstportät mit Lilien (Self-Portrait with Lilies). 1929 was a particularly productive year for her photography and she became active with the Bauhaus magazine.

Early in 1933, at the beginning of the Nazi period in Germany, Brandt first attempted to find work outside of the country, but family responsibilities called her back to Chemnitz. She was unable to find steady employment throughout the Nazi period. In 1939 she became a member of the &quot;Reichskulturkammer,&quot; the Nazi regime&#x27;s official artists&#x27; organisation, in order to obtain art supplies, which would otherwise have been forbidden to her. However, Brandt was never a member of the Nazi Party. After many years of living apart, she and Erik Brandt officially divorced in 1935.

After World War II, Brandt remained in Chemnitz to help rebuild her family&#x27;s home, which had been severely damaged in the bombings. She lived out her days in East Germany, and died in Kirchberg, Saxony, at the age of 89. At the invitation of Mart Stam, from 1949 to 1951 Brandt was a lecturer at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. She taught at the Academy of Applied Art in Berlin from 1951 to 1954.

==Work==
Brandt&#x27;s designs for metal ashtrays, tea and coffee services, lamps, and other household objects are now recognized as among the best of the Weimar and Dessau Bauhaus. Further, they were among the few Bauhaus designs to be mass-produced during the interwar period, and several of them are currently available as reproductions. In an auction in December 2007, one of her teapots —the Model No. MT49 tea infuser—was sold for a record-breaking $361,000.

Beginning in 1926, Brandt also produced a body of photomontage work, though all but a few were not publicly known until the 1970s after she had abandoned the Bauhaus style and was living in Communist East Germany. Some of the photomontages came to public attention after Bauhaus historian Eckhard Neumann solicited the early experiments, stimulated by resurgent interest in modernist experiment in the West. These photomontages often focus on the complex situation of women in the interwar period, a time when they enjoyed new freedoms in work, fashion and sexuality, yet frequently experienced traditional prejudices.

In 1926, Brandt moved with the Bauhaus to Dessau and a year later took charge of lighting design with the metal workshop, before becoming its director from 1928 to 1929. Much of Brandt’s energy was directed into her lighting designs, including collaborations with small number of Bauhaus colleagues and students. One of her early projects was the ME78B hanging lamp (1926). This elegant pendant light made of aluminum featured a simple saucer shade combined with an innovative pulley system and counter-weight, which allowed the height of the lamp to be adjusted with ease; the pendant was used in multiple locations in the Dessau campus, including the metal, weaving and architecture department, as well as the dining room of Gropius’s own house.

During the 1930s and 1940s, Brandt lived in near isolation, despite having many opportunities available to her after her time at Bauhaus. She had just finished showing five photographs at the famed &quot;FiFo&quot; (Film and Photography) exhibition put on by Werkbund. The section her work was shown in was curated by her former mentor Moholy-Nagy. After traveling from job to job and project to project, Brandt lived in her hometown of Chemnitz for sixteen years and did not have any official position. She still produced work, but it was not for a specific purpose or commission. Having picked up painting again during the Nazi period, she continued to paint during the GDR, in both watercolour and tempera. These materials were cheaper and the pieces could be completed more quickly. The paintings are sometimes melancholy and depressing, but this is not surprising considering their timing during her unemployment and the Nazi period.

Brandt is also remembered as a pioneering photographer. She created experimental still-life compositions, but it is her series of self-portraits which are particularly striking. These often represent her as a strong and independent New Woman of the Bauhaus; other examples show her face and body distorted across the curved and mirrored surfaces of metal balls, creating a blended image of herself and her primary medium at the Bauhaus. Brandt was one of few women at Bauhaus who distanced herself from the fields considered more feminine at the time such as weaving or pottery.

Brandt refuses the trope of picturing the female body in a state of dressing or undressing. Nor does she express an intention to contemplate the ideal feminine form. Participating in such compositional choices likely would have detracted from her body as a productive force of material objects, including the photograph itself. By the 20th century there was precedence of images of working women situated in industrial environments, but Brandt opts to capture her craft in the metal that provides her reflection. To this end, the metallic surface that reflects Brandt’s portrait resists a “soft” or “sentimental” effect, instead emanating a quiet coolness. 

== Tea sets ==

Brandt&#x27;s tea sets use geometric forms and incorporated ideas from movements such as Constructivism and De Stijl. There is little ornamentation. The sets used material such as silver plate and brass; and ebony for the handles. The tea sets were almost entirely handmade but it led to mass production of similar products. The reproduction rights to Brandt&#x27;s original 1924 tea set were granted to Alessi, an Italian metalware design company, in 1985. Along with the rights to the tea set, the company also has rights to produce her 1926 ashtray design with removable lid.

Brandt&#x27;s tea set designs are characteristic of the early phases of modernism. Form predominates over ornament and there is a clear sense of at least symbolic compatibility with modern mass-production technology.

==Quotes==
In 1970, Brandt said in the Letter to the Younger Generation, “At first, I was not accepted with pleasure—there was no place for a woman in a metal workshop, they felt. They admitted this to me later on and meanwhile expressed their displeasure by giving me all sorts of dull, dreary work. How many little hemispheres did I most patiently hammer out of brittle new silver, thinking that was the way it had to be and all beginnings are hard. Later things settled down, and we got along well together.”

<text>Calorad Classic is a liquid protein weight loss supplement which was first introduced to the US and Canadian marketplace in 1984. It has been advertised on both television and radio. Calorad Classic is manufactured by NutriDiem and is marketed by several companies including Essentially Yours Industries and Nysante, all of which are headquartered in Canada.

==Composition==

Calorad Classic is a liquid dietary supplement composed primarily of 3,000 mg (3 grams) of Type II hydrolyzed collagen (hydrolysate) from either beef (bovine) or tuna (marine) sources and 8 mg of aloe vera, both of which are listed as active ingredients. The supplement label states that Calorad is fat-free and carbohydrate-free and that 1 serving (1/2 ounce) provides 3 grams of protein and 10 calories. Calorad Classic also comes in a Kosher formulation (marine). The primary claim made for the product is that regular use causes weight loss without loss of lean muscle mass. While weight loss and body fat reduction may be achieved simply by following the labeled instruction to avoid eating within three hours prior to sleep as that can result in eating fewer calories per day, most individuals fasting for 3-hours prior to bed-time alone are not successful in accomplishing long-term weight loss.

Formulator Michel Grise stated that the original version of what later became known as Calorad was developed to treat chickens with fatty liver syndrome. Chickens were developing so much body fat that they stopped laying eggs. The formulation was successful in helping farmers reduce body fat of chickens to get them laying eggs again. This led to the question of whether such a product would work for humans.

==Scientific studies==
Although the manufacturer does not make claims for Calorad Classic in the treatment or cure of disease, the manufacturer does cite published clinical trials in OsteoArthritis and Osteoporosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Fibromyalgia all conducted with Type II hydrolyzed collagen (collagen hydrolysate), the primary ingredient in Calorad.

The manufacturer claims that 40% of subjects will lose weight within 1 month, 75% after 2 months and 87% after 3 months. The distributors of the product offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. In support of these claims, the distributing companies cite a clinical study of Calorad (also unpublished and non-peer reviewed) by Joel B. Lao. Lao is a Doctor of Internal Medicine, and medical consultant in the Philippines who studied the effects of Calorad and its effect on overweight and/or obese individuals. The subjects included 50 overweight or obese individuals who were observed over a 90-day period. One bottle of Calorad was provided to each of the subjects every month for a 3-month period. In month 1, the average weight loss was 5.7 pounds. By month 3, subjects had an average reduction of 10 pounds, and an average inch loss at the waist of 3 inches.

The claim that Calorad Classic facilitates weight loss while building or maintaining lean muscle mass is based upon an unpublished and non-peer reviewed study by Davis &quot;et al.&quot; in which 300 subjects between the ages of 17–77 years, were followed for 1 year, and the majority of whom lost weight (an average of 3.75 pounds per month) but maintained lean muscle mass. Davis states: &quot;We also found that in the entire group, less than 0.6, or less than 1 per cent, had any loss of lean muscle mass. And 36 per cent of the group actually gained lean muscle mass during that time.&quot;

==Marketing claims==

One of the marketing companies, Essentially Yours, states that most subjects on a weight loss regimen lose lean muscle mass along with fat and water weight, so that maintaining lean muscle mass is a benefit seen with Calorad Classic users.

When first introduced, the manufacturer claimed that Calorad Classic could cause the user to &quot;lose weight while you sleep&quot;, repair joints, and prevent or reduce the symptoms of arthritis. The manufacturer has since dropped these claims because they are &quot;medical treatment claims&quot; and require a drug treatment classification approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and are usually only granted following submission of large clinical trials similar to those conducted by pharmaceutical companies in substantiation of these claims. Neither the manufacturer (Nutridiem) or the distributing companies (Nysante or EYI) have conducted this type of rigorous trial on Calorad in support of such claims. The manufacturer and distributing companies have replaced these claims with the current claim that Calorad &quot;promotes sleep and improves the health and appearance of hair, nails and skin&quot; (all of which are not medical treatment claims).

Calorad Classic, like all nutritional supplements, has not been evaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration, and all marketing materials related to the product carry a disclaimer to the effect that it is &quot;a food supplement and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.&quot;

<doc id="590035" wikidata="Q6585346" url="?curid=590035" title="List of U.S. military vessels named after women">
<text>On this list of U.S. military vessels named after women, there are many ships that have seen service with the United States military. Most of these were named in civilian service and then subsequently commissioned into the United States Navy as combat vessels, or as service vessels with U.S. Military Sealift Command. The earliest ships served in the Continental Navy. Overall, few ships have been named after women by the military. Ships often are named after people who served in the Navy, Marines, Coast Guard, or the government. Women have only recently been in such prominent positions, and therefore few have been so honored by the Navy.

==Continental Navy==
*The schooner was commissioned in 1775. 
*The gunboat was commissioned in 1776 and was the first American-armed ship named for a woman. She was a row galley, a small wooden river gunboat, built in 1776 by New York State to defend Hudson River, named in honor of Martha Washington. She remained active, under General Washington&#x27;s command, through June 1777.
* , a frigate in the Continental Navy named for Marie Antoinette.

==United States Maritime Commission==
* , the first ship of the Maritime Commission named for a woman. She was named for Sacagawea in 1942, a Shoshone woman, who served as an interpreter and guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The name was also assigned to a tugboat acquired by the Maritime Commission for the Navy. This &quot;Sacagawea&quot; was retained by the Maritime Commission and not commissioned in the Navy.

==United States Navy==
The following is a list of ships in the United States Navy named after specific women:

*The sidewheel steamer &quot;Harriet Lane&quot; was launched in 1857. She was the first armed ship in service with the U.S. Navy to be named for a woman. Originally a Revenue Cutter, she was named for Harriet Lane, niece of President James Buchanan, who served as Buchanan&#x27;s White House hostess. 

*The sternwheel river steamer was launched in 1856. This name was retained from a former name, of feminist Amelia Bloomer. &quot;Bloomer&quot; was captured from Confederates in 1862, but then served in the U.S. Navy from 1863–65.

* , a screw sloop commissioned in 1860 and,
* , a harbor tug commissioned in 1942, both named for the famed Native American princess Pocahontas.
* Six transports commissioned in 1942:
** , named for Dorothea Dix, first Superintendent of Army Nurses and mental health care activist.

** USS &quot;Anne Arundel&quot; (AP-76), named after a county in Maryland, which in turn was named for English noblewoman Lady Anne Arundell. 
* , a harbor tug acquired in 1942, named for the Native American guide on the Lewis and Clark Expedition.
* , a 1944 harbor tug named for a Potawatomi woman, (the Naval Historical Center says the name Watseka is &quot;possibly a variant spelling of Watsaghika, a former village of the Iruwaitsu Shasta Indian tribe of northern California, at the extreme west end of Scott Valley.&quot;)
* USS &quot;Higbee&quot; (DD-806), 1945 a &quot;Gearing&quot;-class destroyer named for Lenah S. Higbee, Superintendent of Navy Nurse Corps. 
* USS &quot;Hopper&quot; (DDG-70), an named for Grace Hopper, a U.S. Navy Rear Admiral and computer technology pioneer who led the Navy into the digital age. 
* , named for both President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.
* , the second ship named for Sacagawea, launched in 2006, she is the second of a new class of replenishment ships.
* , an oceanographic survey ship launched in October 2000, was named for Commander Mary Sears, a pioneer in oceanography.
* USNS &quot;Amelia Earhart&quot; (T-AKE-6) is a sister ship of &quot;Sacagawea&quot;, named for Amelia Earhart, a pioneer in aviation and women&#x27;s rights activist. 
* USS &quot;Gabrielle Giffords&quot; (LCS-10), an , named for retired U.S. congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt.
* , a named for astronaut Sally Ride launched in 2014.

** USNS &quot;Ruth Bader Ginsburg&quot; (T-AO-211), named for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

==Other Navy ships with a woman&#x27;s name==
Many of these ships served in one or both of World War I, World War II, and some also during the interwar period. Many were the patrol boats (SP), while others were civilian craft (ID) taken into naval service. Others served in the Stone Fleet or were prizes during the Age of Sail. The names often came from a previous owner and almost all were commissioned into the Navy. While some were named by the navy, it is not known which.

<text>The UN Yemen Observation Mission (UNYOM) was established in 1963. 

North Yemen entered into a state of civil war in 1962. Yemen had joined Egypt in 1958, and then in 1962, separated again, sparking the conflict.

To ensure that this conflict did not escalate into an international incident, the UN set up the UN Yemen Observation Mission.

Around 1963, Saudi Arabia and Egypt joined in the civil war. The task of UNYOM was to monitor Saudi Arabia and Egypt in order to make sure they did not tilt the conflict one way or another and avoided causing a potentially harmful dispute through that part of the Middle East.

==Commanders==
UNYOM&#x27;s commanders:
*Major General Carl von Horn (Sweden) – July–August 1963
*Colonel Branko Pavlovic (Yugoslavia) (acting) – August–September 1963
*Lieutenant General P.S. Gyani (India) – September–November 1963

==Chiefs of Staff==
UNYOM&#x27;s Chiefs of Staff:
*Colonel Branko Pavlovic (Yugoslavia) – November 1963
*Colonel S.C. Sabharwal (India) – November 1963 – September 1964

<text>Night lizards (family Xantusiidae) are a group of small scincomorph lizards, averaging from less than to over snout–vent length. Most species are viviparous (live-bearing), with the exception of those in the genus &quot;Cricosaura&quot;. The family has only three living genera, with approximately 34 living species. The genera are divided by geographic range: &quot;Xantusia&quot; in southwestern North America and Baja California, &quot;Cricosaura&quot; in Cuba, and &quot;Lepidophyma&quot;, the most populous night lizard genus, in Central America. Three fossil genera are also known: &quot;Catactegenys&quot;, &quot;Palepidophyma&quot;, &quot;Palaeoxantusia&quot;.

==Biology==

Night lizards were originally thought to be nocturnal because of their secretive lifestyle, but they are at least in some cases diurnal. Night lizards have evolved to live in very narrow environmental niches—&quot;microhabitat specialization&quot;—such as rock crevices or damp logs, and may spend their entire life under the same cover.

Physically, night lizards are characterized by relatively flat bodies and heads. Their heads are covered by large, smooth plates, while their bodies have rougher, granular skin. Their eyes, like those of snakes, are covered by immoveable, transparent membranes that function as eyelids. They feed on insects and sometimes plants.

Contrary to the reproductive strategies of most small lizards, night lizards tend to have very low reproductive rates, with several species giving birth to only one or two offspring, after a gestation period of about three months. They generally take several years to reach sexual maturity. However, the covert lifestyle of night lizards has contributed to a high life expectancy.

===Silver Star citation===
Citation:

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Lieutenant Colonel Paul Xavier Kelley (MCSN: 0-50603), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as Commanding Officer of the Second Battalion, Fourth Marines, THIRD Marine Division (Rein.), FMF, in connection with combat operations against insurgent communist (Viet Cong) forces in the Republic of Vietnam. On 21 March 1966, during Operation TEXAS, Lieutenant Colonel Kelley led his Battalion in a helicopter assault on a Viet Cong fortified area in Quang Ngai Province. Debarking from his helicopter into accurate, intense enemy fire, he realized that the landing zone must be enlarged in order to bring in the balance of the Battalion safely. With great professional competence and composure, he maneuvered his Companies into position to attack the enemy, employing all available supporting arms. As a result of his decisive action, all aircraft and personnel landed without sustaining casualties. In the attack phase, with complete disregard for his own safety, Lieutenant Colonel Kelley placed himself in a strategic, exposed position from which he could best control the assault companies and supporting arms. His personal example and bold leadership were a source of inspiration to all who were engaged in the operation. At the conclusion of the vicious three and a half hour battle, Lieutenant Colonel Kelley&#x27;s Battalion had accounted for 167 Viet Cong killed, many small arms and crew served weapons captured, and tons of supplies destroyed. By his daring leadership, relentless fighting spirit and unswerving dedication to duty throughout, Lieutenant Colonel Kelley upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

==Post-Marine Corps career==
In 1989, Kelley joined the Washington, D.C. public policy firm Cassidy &amp; Associates; he served as the Vice Chairman Emeritus. From 1989 to 1994, he served as Chairman of the American Battle Monuments Commission. Kelley was on the board of directors of a number of corporations, including Allied Signal, Inc., GenCorp, Inc., Saul Centers, Inc., Sturm Ruger &amp; Co., Inc.; and the Wackenhut Corporation. In December 2006, Kelley chaired a panel of military and business leaders looking to improve the United States&#x27;s energy security. They recommended tougher emission standards and greater access to offshore United States gas and oil reserves.

On July 26, 2007, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; published an op-ed by Kelley and Robert F. Turner, in which they warned that the July 20, 2007 executive order issued by President George W. Bush, purporting to define torture and allowable interrogation methods, appeared to violate Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and thus expose the President and other persons to potential liability for war crimes. On November 9, 2010, he was named an honorable Reagan Fellow from Eureka college. Kelley sat on the Honorary Board for the 501 (c) (3) Non Profit Wine Country Marines.

Kelley died of complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at a care facility in McLean, Virginia on December 29, 2019, at the age of 91. He was interred in Arlington National Cemetery on February 13, 2020, following a memorial service at the Fort Myer Memorial Chapel.

==Honors, awards and badges==
===Military===
Kelley&#x27;s decorations, awards, and badges include:

*Note: The gold United States Navy Parachute Rigger badge was worn unofficially by Marine Corps personnel in place of United States Army parachutist badge from 1942 to 1963 before it officially became the Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist insignia on July 12, 1963, per BuPers Notice 1020. Members of the Marine Corps who attended jump school before 1963 were issued the silver Army parachutist badge but may be depicted wearing the gold Navy Parachute Rigger badge as it was common during this time period to do so.

===Civilian===
Kelley was awarded honorary doctoral degrees from Villanova University, Norwich University, Webster University, Jacksonville University, and the United States Sports Academy. He was a recipient of the National Geographic Society&#x27;s Major General O.A. Anderson Award, the Veterans of Foreign Wars&#x27; National Armed Forces Award, the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award presented by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Awards Council member General John W. Vessey, Jr., USA, the Navy League&#x27;s Admiral John M. Will Award, the Ireland Fund&#x27;s Irishman of the Year for Southern California Award, the Reserve Officers Association&#x27;s Minuteman Hall of Fame Award, and the Marine Corps Scholarship Fund&#x27;s Semper Fidelis Award.

Eureka College, alma mater of President Ronald Reagan, named Kelley as its third &quot;Honorary Reagan Fellow&quot; to celebrate his lifetime of service and leadership on November 9, 2010, at the Reagan Building in Washington, D.C. The date was chosen to correspond with the 21st anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
