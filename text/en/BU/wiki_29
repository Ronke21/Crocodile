<text>Gwydir River (locally [gwɑe̯də]), a major inland perennial river of the Barwon catchment within the Murray–Darling basin, is located in the Northern Tablelands, North West Slopes, and Orana districts of New South Wales, Australia.

The river rises at the junction of the Rocky River and Boorolong Creek, at Yarrowyck, northwest of Uralla and flows generally northwest and west, joined by over thirty-four tributaries, including the Horton and Mehi rivers, before reaching its confluence with the Barwon River, north east of Collarenebri; descending over its course.

The flow of the river is impounded by Copeton Dam, with storage used for town water supply, stock, domestic use and irrigation. The Gwydir River below Copeton Dam provides some of the wildest whitewater rafting available in Australia. Before the construction of Copeton Dam and much diversionary work, the Gwydir River flowed into the Gingham and Lower Gwydir Wetlands.

The Gwydir Highway was named after the river.

==Geography==


The Gwydir river rises on the southern part of the Northern Tablelands, near the town of Uralla, and flows about generally north west and then west onto the plains where it branches somewhat, eventually joining the Barwon River, mostly as its main branch the Mehi River, which branches off to the east of Moree, before passing through it. The upper Gwydir River also passes the towns of Bundarra, Bingara, Gravesend, and Pallamallawa. Further distributaries above Moree are the Carole which then joins with the GilGil Creek to the north that flow into the Barwon River when during times of high rainfall/runoff or water deliveries.

The Gwydir River further splits into two anabranch west of Moree – the Lower Gwydir or &quot;Big Leather Watercourse&quot; is the southern channel, and the &quot;Gingham Channel&quot; is the northern branch. The Gingham Channel flows west and becomes undefined in wetlands and floodplains around west of Moree. Only in larger flood events does it then join with the Ballone Creek before it flows into the Barwon River. The Big Leather Watercourse then also loses definition in wetlands and floodplains to the west and only larger floods joins with the Barwon River to the west. In turn, the Mehi River joins the Barwon River near the town of Collarenebri.

Over its entire distance, the Gwydir River falls around in elevation from its headwaters, at an elevation of above sea level to when it joins the Barwon River at an elevation of above sea level. The Gwydir River&#x27;s total length is , in which space and thirty-four tributaries feed into it over its entire length; including the Horton River, Warialda Creek, Laura Creek and Moredun Creek.

==History==
The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Gwydir River were the Aboriginal Kamilaroi peoples.

Explorer Allan Cunningham crossed the river at Gravesend in 1827 and named it after his patron, Peter Burrell, Baron Gwydyr (), who took his title from Gwydir Castle in Wales. The Commonwealth Electoral Division of Gwydir, which was created in 1901 and ceased to exist at the 2007 federal election, was named for the Gwydir River. In Australia the name is pronounced to rhyme with &quot;wider,&quot; whereas the Welsh name is pronounced roughly &quot;Gwidd-eer&quot;.

The iron lattice bridges crossing the Gwydir River at Bundarra and Bingara are regarded as significant bridges of the colonial period. Around mid-1838 a war of extirpation, according to local magistrate Edward Denny Day, was waged all along the Gwydir River. Aborigines in the district were repeatedly pursued by parties of mounted and armed stockmen and Day claimed that great numbers of them had been killed at various spots.
==Agriculture==
A lot of irrigated cotton is grown near Moree, as well as many other crops, livestock and agricultural enterprises. The cotton industry relies on irrigation and has been affected by recent drought with water allocations to farms severely reduced. In 2006 it was calculated that the cotton industry consumed 87% of the agricultural water taken from the Gwydir River.

Irrigation in the upper Gwydir led to a severe reduction in natural flows downstream. The reduction in water flow has affected landholders who traditionally grazed on wetlands and floodplains and in areas where the waters from the river were used to supplement stock drinking water and for minor watering of pasture and small areas of crops. It also reduced or stopped periodical flushes of water into ephemeral creeks, watercourses and wetlands in the Gingham, Lower Gwydir and Mallowa and other smaller systems. These conflicts resulted in the establishment of the Gwydir Regulated River Management Committee in 1997 and then the Gwydir Environmental Contingency Allowance Operation Advisory Committee when the Gwydir Water Sharing Plan came into effect on 1 July 2004.

==Environment==

===Wetlands===
Some of the privately owned Gwydir Wetlands were designated on 14 June 1999 as a Ramsar site as a wetland of international importance.

Some of the Gwydir Wetlands have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because, when they receive adequate water inflows, they support more breeding waterbirds than any other site in the country. At times more than half a million nesting waterbirds have been present, including over 1% of the world populations of nankeen night herons, intermediate egrets, and of white and straw-necked ibises. The endangered Australasian bittern, Black-necked stork and other threatened species have been recorded.

The Namoi River snapping turtle or Bell&#x27;s turtle (&quot;Elseya belli&quot;) is found only in the upper reaches of the Namoi, Gwydir and Macdonald Rivers on the NSW North West Slopes.

<doc id="593485" wikidata="Q347471" url="?curid=593485" title="Stjepan Radić">
<text>Stjepan Radić (11 June 1871 – 8 August 1928) was a Croat politician and founder of the Croatian People&#x27;s Peasant Party (HPSS), active in Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

He is credited with galvanizing Croatian peasantry into a viable political force. Throughout his entire career, Radić was opposed to the union and later Serb hegemony in Yugoslavia and became an important political figure in that country. He was shot in parliament by the Serbian People&#x27;s Radical Party politician Puniša Račić. Radić died several weeks later from the serious stomach wound at the age of 57. This assassination further alienated the Croats and the Serbs and initiated the breakdown of the parliamentary system, culminating in the 6 January Dictatorship of 1929.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Stjepan Radić was born in Desno Trebarjevo, Martinska Ves near Sisak in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia within Austria-Hungary as the ninth of eleven children. After being expelled from his gymnasium in Zagreb, he finished at the Higher Real Gymnasium in Karlovac. In 1888, Radić travelled to Đakovo where he met with bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer to request help for a trip to the Russian Empire. Strossmayer recommended Radić to Metropolitan Mihailo of Belgrade who referred him to a Russian teacher in Kiev. Radić travelled to Kiev and was allowed to stay at the city&#x27;s Monastery of the Caves where he remained for six weeks before returning to Croatia.

In September 1891, he enrolled in law at the University of Zagreb. He was selected as a representative of the student body at the celebration of the 300th anniversary of the Battle of Sisak in 1893. After criticizing the Ban of Croatia Károly Khuen-Héderváry during the ceremony and referring to him as a &quot;Magyar hussar&quot;, Radić was sentenced to four months in prison which he served in Petrinja. He was among a group of students who set fire to the Hungarian tricolour on 16 October 1895, during the visit of Emperor Franz Joseph to Zagreb. For this, Radić received a prison sentence and was expelled from the University of Zagreb, as well as barred from all universities in the Monarchy. After spending some time in Russia and, later, Prague, Radić continued his studies at the École libre des sciences politiques in Paris, where he graduated in 1899.

===Lead up to the first Yugoslavia===

After World War I he had opposed the merging of Croatia with the Kingdom of Serbia without guarantees of Croatian . Radić was selected as a member of the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On 24 November 1918 he famously urged delegates attending a session that would decide the country&#x27;s political future not to &quot;rush like geese into fog&quot;. He was the lone member of the National Council&#x27;s central committee to vote against sending a delegation to Belgrade to negotiate with the Kingdom of Serbia. On 26 November, he was removed from the central committee.

After the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was established, two representatives of Radić&#x27;s party (by then named the Croatian Common-people Peasant Party) were appointed to the Provisional Representation which served as a parliament until elections for the Constituent could be held. Radić refused participation which he saw as legitimizing the unification.

===Arrest===

On 8 March 1919, the central committee passed a resolution penned by Radić that declared &quot;Croatian citizens do not recognize the so called Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes under the Karađorđević dynasty because this kingdom was proclaimed other than by the Croatian Sabor and without any mandate of the Croatian People.&quot; The full statement was included in a Memorandum which was translated into French and sent abroad to be addressed to the Paris Peace Conference. This act provoked a decision by the government to arrest Radić along with several other party members.

He was to be held some 11 months until February 1920, just before the first parliamentary elections of the Kingdom of SHS to a Constitutional Assembly which were held on 28 November when he was amnestied. The result of the November election was 230,590 votes, which equaled to 50 seats in the parliament out of 419. On 8 December, before the first sitting of parliament, Radić held a massive rally in front of 100,000 people in Zagreb. Stjepan Radić and the CCPP held a meeting in which a motion was put forward and voted on that the party will not be part of parliamentary discussions before matters are first resolved with Serbia on the matters of governance, the most sticking issues being the minorisation of the Croatian people and the overt powers of the King with the central government in Belgrade. The party was subsequently renamed to the Croatian Republican Peasant Party, highlighting the party&#x27;s official stance. In December, ban of Croatia Matko Laginja was dismissed by the cabinet of Milenko Radomar Vesnić for allowing the rally to take place.

===The new Constitution===

On 12 December 1920, the Parliament of SHS had their first sitting, without the representatives of CPP (50 representatives) and the Croatian Party of Rights (2 representatives). A total of 342 representatives presented their credentials out of a total of 419. On 28 June 1921, the Constitution of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was made law after a vote of 223 representatives out of the present 285, the total number representatives in the parliament being 419; 35 voted against and 161 abstained or had walked out. The constitution was commonly known as the Vidovdan (St. Vitus Day) Constitution after the anniversary of the Serbian Battle of Kosovo, also the anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914.

In the next parliamentary elections, which were held in March 1923, the stance of Stjepan Radić and the CPP against the central government managed to turn into extra votes. The results of the election were, 70 seats or 473.733 votes, which represented the majority of the Croatian vote in Northern and Southern parts of Croatia, as well as the Croatian votes in Bosnia, as well as Herzegovina.

===Second imprisonment===
Radić still held on to the idea of an independent Croatia, and kept the party out of parliament in protest. This in effect afforded Serbian prime minister Nikola Pašić the opportunity to consolidate power and strengthen his Serb-dominated government. Radić embarked on an unsanctioned overseas trip in 1923 in which he visited England, France, Austria, and the Soviet Union. During this trip he briefly stayed at the home of the writer Richard Hughes, who had been Radić&#x27;s spokesperson during Hughes&#x27;s trip to Zagreb in 1922. On 1 July 1924, he proclaimed that his party would join the Krestintern as long as it was without Yugoslav representation and the Communist International denounced Yugoslav Unitarianism. The party congress approved his party&#x27;s ascension into the Krestintern on 24 August and thereafter, the centralists and monarchists accused him of communism and anti-state activities. On 23 December, the central government declared that the political party CRPP was in contravention of the Internal security law of 1921 in the infamous Obznana declaration, and this was confirmed by King Alexander on 1 January 1924. Stjepan Radić was arrested on 5 January, along with several prominent members of his party.

After the parliamentary elections in February 1925, the CRPP even with its whole executive team behind bars, and with only Stjepan Radić at its helm, CRPP managed to win 67 parliamentary seats with a total of 532,872 votes. Even though the vote count was higher than at the previous election, the gerrymandering by the central government ensured that CRPP received fewer parliamentary seats. In order to increase his negotiating power the CRPP entered into a coalition with the Independent Democratic party (Samostalna demokratska stranka), Slovenian People&#x27;s Party (Slovenska ljudska stranka) and the Yugoslav Muslim Organization (Jugoslavenska muslimanska organizacija).

===Return to Parliament===
Immediately after the parliamentary elections in March 1925, the CRPP changed the party name to Croatian Peasant Party (Hrvatska seljačka stranka). With the backing of the coalition partners, the CPP made an agreement with the major conservative Serbian party - the People&#x27;s Radical Party (Narodna radikalna stranka), in which a power-sharing arrangement was struck, as well as a deal to release the CPP executive from jail. The CPP recognized the central government and the rule of the monarch, as well as the Vidovdan constitution in front of the full parliament on 27 March 1925. Stjepan Radić was made the Minister for Education, whereas other CPP party members obtained ministerial posts: Pavle Radić, Nikola Nikić, Benjamin Šuperina, and Ivan Krajač. This powersharing arrangement was cut short after the passing away of the president of the Peoples Radical Party, Nikola Pašić, on 10 December 1926.

Radić soon resigned his ministerial post in 1926 and returned to the opposition, and in 1927 entered into a coalition with Svetozar Pribićević, president of the Independent Democratic Party, a leading party of the Serbs in Croatia. The Peasant-Democrat coalition had a real chance to end the Radicals&#x27; long-time stranglehold control of the Parliament. Previously they had long been opponents, but the Democrats became disillusioned with the Belgrade bureaucracy and restored good relations with the Peasant Party with which they were allies in the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. With this arrangement, Stjepan Radić managed to obtain a parliamentary majority in 1928. However, he was not able to form a government. The Peasant-Democrat coalition was opposed by some of the Croatian elite, like Ivo Andrić, who even regarded the followers of the CPP as &quot;&quot;...fools following a blind dog...&quot; (the blind dog being Stjepan Radić). As he reached his mid to late 50s, Radić was nearly blind.

===Assassination in Parliament===


Death threats and threats of violent beatings were made against Stjepan Radić in parliament, without any intervention by the president of the Assembly (Parliamentary speaker). On the morning of 20 June 1928, Radić was warned of the danger of an assassination attempt against him and was begged to stay away from the Assembly for that day. He replied that he was like a soldier in war, in the trenches and as such it was his duty to go but he nevertheless promised not to utter a single word.

In the Assembly, Puniša Račić, a member of People&#x27;s Radical Party from Montenegro, got up and made a provocative speech which produced a stormy reaction from the opposition but Radić himself stayed completely silent. Finally, Ivan Pernar shouted in response, &quot;thou plundered beys&quot;&quot; (referring to accusations of corruption related to him). In an earlier speech Radić accused Račić of stealing from civilian population and later refused to apologize when Račić asked him to. Puniša Račić made his way to the speaker podium facing the Croats. He put his hand in his pocket, where he held the pistol, and faced the president Ninko Perić and told him: &quot;I ask of you, Mr. president, to sanction Pernar. If you fail to stop me, I shall punish him myself!&quot; After that threat shouting started in the room. But Račić continued his threats: &quot;Whoever tries to stand between me and Pernar will be killed!&quot; At that moment Puniša Račić took out his Luger pistol. Minister Vujičić, sitting at the bench behind Račić, grabbed his hand in order to stop him. At the same time, minister Kujundžić came to his aid, but Račić, however, being very strong, broke himself free. At exactly 11:25 AM shots were fired - Pernar was hit 1 cm above the heart. When he collapsed, Račić took aim at Stjepan Radić. Đuro Basariček noticed this and leaped to help him. Račić, however, turned his way and shot him, bullet entering his loins and exiting around his scapula. Basariček fainted immediately. Ivan Granđa ran in front of Stjepan Radić and Račić shot him in the arm. As soon as he was down, Račić aimed at Stjepan Radić, and shot him in the chest. At that point Pavle Radić jumped towards Račić, who didn&#x27;t get confused, but remarked: &quot;Ha! I&#x27;ve been looking for you!&quot; and shot him 1 cm below the heart. It was believed Račić would shoot Svetozar Pribičević, sitting next to Stjepan Radić, but Račić instead left the room through the ministers&#x27; chambers. The whole assassination was over in less than a minute. It was one of the first assassinations in a government building in history. Radić was left for dead and indeed had such a serious stomach wound (he was also a diabetic) that he died several weeks later at the age of 57. His funeral was officiated by archbishop Antun Bauer of Zagreb. There was a massive turnout for his burial, and his death was seen as causing a permanent rift in Croat–Serb relations in the old Yugoslavia.

Puniša Račić was convicted of the murders and sentenced to 60 years in prison, which was immediately reduced to 20 years. Račić spent most of his sentence under house arrest in a comfortable villa, where he was attended by three servants and was free to enter and leave at will. The leniency of his sentence likely came as a result of his connection with the Chetniks. He was released from house arrest on 27 March 1941. Račić was shot by the Yugoslav Partisans on 16 October 1944 during the liberation of Belgrade from the Axis powers.

Following the political crisis triggered by the shooting, in January 1929, King Aleksandar Karađorđević abolished the constitution, dissolved the parliament, banned all ethnic, regional and religious political parties, and declared a royal dictatorship.

Radić is buried in the Mirogoj cemetery in Zagreb.

==Legacy==

Radić&#x27;s violent death turned him into a martyr and an icon of political struggle for the peasantry and the working class, as well as an icon of Croatian patriots. The iconography of Stjepan Radić was later used not only by his successor Vladko Maček, but also by other political options in Croatia: right wing or left wing.
The Ustaše used the death of Stjepan Radić as proof of Serbian hegemony, and as an excuse for their treatment of Serbs. However, a number of leading CPP figures who became political opponents of the Ustashe were imprisoned or killed by the regime. The Partisans on the other hand used this as a recruiting point with CPP members who were disillusioned with the Independent State of Croatia, and latter had one brigade named after Antun and Stjepan Radić in 1943.

The image of Stjepan Radić was used extensively during the Croatian Spring movement in the early 1970s. There are many folk groups, clubs, primary and secondary schools which bear the name of Stjepan Radić. Many Croatian cities have streets and squares in his name. In 2008, a total of 265 streets in Croatia were named after him, making Radić the third most common person eponym of streets in the country. Statues of Stjepan Radić are also common. His portrait was depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 200 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. Since 1995 the Republic of Croatia has awarded the Order of Stjepan Radić. In 2015 the Croatian Parliament declared 20 June to be the Memorial Day for Stjepan Radić and the June Victims.

In 1997, a poll in Croatian weekly &quot;Nacional&quot; named Stjepan Radić as the most admired Croatian historic personality.

===Anti-clericalism===
Stjepan Radić was a Roman Catholic, but at the same time extremely anti-clerical. In a 1924 rally in Krašić, birthplace of the late Cardinal Aloysius Stepinac, he stated: &quot;Priests or bishops are teachers of the faith and as such we are listening to them in church, and even outside the church. But when they mistake religion with politics, with such gentile politics of revenge, blood, arrogance and gluttony, they are not teachers, but destroyers of faith and church. (...) When our bishops write a political letter, and when they want to be political leaders to the Croatian people, then it is my and our duty to decipher it and if necessary, condemn it.&quot; In an interview for Nova revija in 1926 he stated that &quot;clericalism means abuse of the most sacred feelings of religion in order to destroy the family, to demolish people in order to gain political power.&quot; He would often repeat the slogan: Believe in God, but not in the priest. He supported the establishment of the Indigenous Croatian Catholic Church, and its separation from the Vatican. The secularist association &quot;Voice of Reason – The Movement for a Secular Croatia&quot; uses his portrait as its logo.

<text>Manilla is a small town in New South Wales, Australia, located on Fossickers Way 45 kilometres northwest of the regional city of Tamworth and 27 kilometres northeast of the historic village Somerton. Manilla is famous for its setting as a fishing, paragliding, and mountain biking area. The name Manilla comes from the Gamilaraay word &#x27;Maneela&#x27;, which is said to mean &#x27;meeting of the rivers&#x27;.

The township of Manilla was established in 1853 at the junction of the Namoi River and the Manilla River. It was formerly the centre of Manilla Shire local government area, but this was amalgamated with Tamworth City Council and portions of Parry, Barraba and Nundle Shire Councils to form Tamworth Regional Council in 2004. It lies next to the Bundarra-Barraba Important Bird Area which is important for the conservation of the critically endangered regent honeyeater. Manilla is also well known for Split Rock Dam on the Manilla River and Lake Keepit on the Namoi River.

==Transport==
Manilla is served by Tamworth Buslines route 443 from Tamworth.

==History==
The junction of the Manilla and Namoi Rivers known as &#x27;Maneela&#x27;, was for generations, a camping ground for the local Indigenous people, members of the large Kamilaroi (Gamilaraay) tribes of northwestern New South Wales. 

Thomas Florance led the first British surveying expedition to the region in 1827. The local Aboriginal clan rolled boulders from the hills onto Florance&#x27;s encampment, whose men then fired upon them. Another skirmish occurred resulting in one of the surveying team being wounded by a spear and Florance shooting an Aboriginal man.

In 1832, Henry Dangar and Sir William Edward Parry conducted further surveying for the Australian Agricultural Company and camped on what is now the present site of the Manilla township. They found several Aboriginal families living there.

Around 1836, British pastoral squatters arrived in the area looking to establish large sheep and cattle stations on so-called crown land for the small leasehold fee of £10 per annum. Three massive properties were soon established in the Manilla region: Greenhatches formed by Joseph Greenhatch on behalf of Sydney businessman Charles Smith; Dinawirindi formed by Otto Baldwin; and Cuerindi formed by Thomas Simpson Hall and his brothers.

Conflict in the area between the colonists and the resident Aboriginal population resulted in the government sending a large detachment of New South Wales Mounted Police under the command of Major James Nunn to the region in early 1838. Nunn&#x27;s force captured around 100 Aboriginal people just to the west of what is now Manilla, with fifteen taken prisoner and one being shot dead. Frontier conflict in the immediate vicinity appears to have ended after Nunn&#x27;s operation, who proceeded north-west with his men, later perpetrating the Waterloo Creek massacre.

In the 1840s, the Greenhatches leasehold was sold to William Wentworth and John Charles Lloyd, and was re-named Manilla. Dinawirindi was later reduced in size and re-named as Durham Court with the Baldwin family holding the property right up until 2016. Cuerindi was also held within the Hall family for generations.

During the 1850s, teamsters with bullock waggons were regularly transporting goods from the Hunter District through the Manilla area to outlying cattle stations and the northern goldfield settlements of Bingara and Bundarra. Teams were often delayed at the junction of the Namoi and Manilla Rivers by high water. In 1853, enterprising Englishman George Veness arrived at ‘The Junction’ to set up a store and wine shop at the teamsters’ camping ground. In doing so, Veness is acknowledged as the founder of the Manilla township which was located on the boundary of the Manilla and Dinawirindi pastoral properties. The town&#x27;s early prosperity was founded on the highly productive wheat and pastoral industries.

In 1864, the nascent township was practically wiped out by an immense flood. It took many years for the town to recover, with the first school being built in 1878 and the first post-office in 1880.

Australian singer-songwriter Darren Hanlon produced a song entitled &#x27;Manilla NSW&#x27; which appeared on his 2006 record, &#x27;Fingertips and Mountaintops&#x27;.

At the 2006 census, Manilla had a population of 2,082, whilst as at the there were 2,386 people.

==Rugby League and Dally Messenger==
In July 1917 Dally Messenger and his wife, Annie, took over the Royal Hotel in Manilla. Shortly after his arrival Dally established the Manilla Rugby League Club. This was difficult as there was a strong Rugby Union Team and many other young men were at Gallipoli or other theatres of World War I. 

His original team included Jack Hiscox, Roy Blanch, Frank and Norman Chapman, Jack Munro and Ivan Miller. Dally played some games but was more concerned, as coach, into forming these local young men into a quality team. In 1918 in the knockout competition held in Tamworth, Manilla defeated Quirindi 10-6 and Tamworth 14 nil. 

In June 1919 Both Dally and Annie caught the Spanish flu pandemic. Dally recovered but tragically Annie died on 23 June 1919 and is buried in the Manilla cemetery. On 23 August 1919 Dally returned to Sydney with his five year old son (Dally II).

Marking the history on the very day of its formation, 8 July 2017, the Manilla Rugby League club under captain Coach Mitch Doring celebrated its 100th anniversary (2017) of formation with a hard fought match against the Bendemeer Mountain Men whom they defeated 34-30. Guests of honour at the celebratory dinner afterwards included Dally Messenger’s grandsons Ken and Dally Messenger, and great grandchildren Cameron Dally Messenger and Genevieve Ann Messenger.

<text>Psychosocial short stature (PSS) is a growth disorder that is observed between the ages of 2 and 15, caused by extreme emotional deprivation or stress.

The symptoms include decreased growth hormone (GH) and somatomedin secretion, very short stature, weight that is inappropriate for the height, and immature skeletal age. This disease is a progressive one, and as long as the child is left in the stressing environment, their cognitive abilities continue to degenerate. Though rare in the population at large, it is common in feral children and in children kept in abusive, confined conditions for extended lengths of time. It can cause the body to completely stop growing but is generally considered to be temporary; regular growth will resume when the source of stress is removed.

==Cause==
Children with PSS have extremely low levels of growth hormone. These children possibly have a problem with growth hormone inhibiting hormone (GHIH) or growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH). The children could either be unresponsive to GHRH, or too sensitive to GHIH.

Children who have PSS exhibit signs of failure to thrive. Even though they appear to be receiving adequate nutrition, they do not grow and develop normally compared to other children of their age.

An environment of constant and extreme stress causes PSS. Stress-released hormones in the body such as epinephrine and norepinephrine engage what is known as the fight-or-flight response. The heart speeds up, and the body diverts resources away from processes that are not immediately important; in PSS, the production of growth hormone (GH) is thus affected. As well as lacking growth hormone, children with PSS exhibit gastrointestinal problems due to the large amounts of epinephrine and norepinephrine, resulting in their bodies lacking proper digestion of nutrients and further affecting development.

While the cure for PSS is questionable, some studies show that placing the child affected with the disease in a foster or group home increases growth rate and socialization skills.

==Society and culture==

One case was a child who was admitted to a hospital with an extremely low weight. One nurse took over his care, and he began to rapidly gain weight and his growth hormone levels increased during this time. The child was so dependent on the nurse emotionally that when she left, his levels returned to what they had been when he was admitted to the hospital, and once she returned, they stabilized once more.

When a police raid in 1987 released the children held by an Australian group known as The Family, one twelve-year-old girl weighed under 20 kg (44 lbs) and was under 120 cm (4 ft) tall. She grew 11 cm (4 in) in the following year, and her growth hormone levels returned to normal.

===Fictional characters===
In Günter Grass&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; (&quot;Die Blechtrommel&quot;), the character Oskar Matzerath &quot;willfully stunted his growth at three feet tall as a three-year-old, although later in the novel he grows to four feet one inch&quot; in reaction to the stress he experiences—the petit-bourgeois German society.

In the novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot; by Victor Hugo, eight-year old Cosette had been abused, neglected and enslaved by the Thènardier family. The extreme abuse and neglect she faces is described as very stressful for her, and as a result she is described as simultaneously being as short as a child half her age and having an expression more appropriate for an older woman. She recovers after she is adopted by Jean Valjean and is of average height as an adult.

In &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, Chief Bromden claims that one of Nurse Ratched&#x27;s orderlies, Williams, a black man with dwarfism, gained his short stature from seeing white men rape his mother.

In the novel &quot;Flowers in the Attic &quot; by V.C. Andrews, twins Cory and Carrie Dollanganger are locked in an attic (with their two older siblings). The stress of their grandmother&#x27;s abuse and lack of attention from their mother—along with arsenic poisoning and lack of outdoor play opportunities—stunts the twins&#x27; growth. Later in the series, Carrie is described as being eight years old, yet her physical appearance is that of a three-year-old.

<text>John Francis Skjellerup (aka James Francis Skjellerup; 16 May 1875 – 6 January 1952) was an Australian amateur astronomer who spent two decades working as a telegraphist in South Africa.

His father Peder Jensen Skjellerup was Danish and died when he was young; his mother was Margaret Williamson, born in England. He was born in Cobden, Victoria, Australia, the tenth of thirteen children. His youngest brother, George Skellerup (who dropped the silent &quot;j&quot; from his surname later in life), became a successful industrialist in New Zealand.

Trained as a telegraphist, Skjellerup went to South Africa when that country needed telegraphists after the Second Boer War; 18 telegraphists left Australia on 21 February 1900 on the &quot;SS Australasian&quot; for Cape Town. Apparently, he was an excellent golfer as well as an astronomer. He married South African Mary Peterson and returned with her to Australia in 1923 where they settled in Melbourne; she died in 1950 and there were no children. He lived in the Melbourne suburb of Oakleigh and died in his hometown on 6 January 1952.

Skjellerup took up astronomy in South Africa. There was no family history in science, let alone astronomy, and Skjellerup was unable to establish a family connection to the Danish astronomer Hans Schjellerup (1827–1887). In 1912, he was a foundation member of the Cape Astronomical Association. He discovered or co-discovered various comets in both South Africa and Australia, including the periodic comet 26P/Grigg–Skjellerup in South Africa and the very bright Skjellerup–Maristany (C/1927 X1) (visible mostly from the Southern Hemisphere) in Australia. In addition to comets, he was also a variable star observer.

<text>Rheumatism or rheumatic disorders are conditions causing chronic, often intermittent pain affecting the joints or connective tissue. Rheumatism does not designate any specific disorder, but covers at least 200 different conditions, including arthritis and &quot;non-articular rheumatism&quot;, also known as &quot;regional pain syndrome&quot; or &quot;soft tissue rheumatism&quot;. There is a close overlap between the term soft tissue disorder and rheumatism. Sometimes the term &quot;soft tissue rheumatic disorders&quot; is used to describe these conditions.

The term &quot;Rheumatic Diseases&quot; is used in MeSH to refer to connective tissue disorders. The branch of medicine devoted to the diagnosis and therapy of rheumatism is called rheumatology.

==Types==
Many rheumatic disorders of chronic, intermittent pain (including joint pain, neck pain or back pain) have historically been caused by infectious diseases. Their etiology was unknown until the 20th century and not treatable. Postinfectious arthritis, also known as reactive arthritis, and rheumatic fever are other examples.

In the United States, major rheumatic disorders are divided into 10 major categories based on the nomenclature and classification proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1983.

* Diffuse connective tissue diseases
** Rheumatoid arthritis
** Juvenile arthritis
** Systemic lupus erythematosus
** Sjögren syndrome
** Scleroderma
** Polymyositis
** Dermatomyositis
** Behçet&#x27;s disease
** Relapsing polychondritis
* Arthritis associated with spondylitis (i.e. spondarthritis)
** Ankylosing spondylitis
** Reactive arthritis
** Psoriatic arthritis
* Osteoarthritis (i.e. osteoarthrosis, degenerative joint disease)
* Rheumatic syndromes associated with infectious agents (direct and indirect or reactive)
* Metabolic and endocrine diseases associated with rheumatic states
** Gout, pseudogout
* Neoplasms
* Neurovascular disorders
* Bone and cartilage disorders
* Extraarticular disorders
** Bursitis/Tendinitis of the shoulder, wrist, biceps, leg, knee cap (patella), ankle, hip, and Achilles tendon
** Capsulitis
* Miscellaneous disorders associated with articular manifestations
** Palindromic rheumatism is thought to be a form of rheumatoid arthritis.

==Diagnosis==
Blood and urine tests will measure levels of creatinine and uric acid to determine kidney function, an elevation of the ESR and CRP is possible. After a purine-restricted diet, another urine test will help determine whether the body is producing too much uric acid or the body isn&#x27;t excreting enough uric acid. Rheumatoid factor may be present, especially in the group that is likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis. A fine needle is used to draw fluid from a joint to determine if there is any build-up of fluid. The presence of uric acid crystals in the fluid would indicate gout. In many cases there may be no specific test, and it is often a case of eliminating other conditions before getting a correct diagnosis.

==Management==
Initial therapy of the major rheumatological diseases is with analgesics, such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Steroids, especially glucocorticoids, and stronger analgesics are often required for more severe cases.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;rheumatism&quot; stems from the Late Latin &quot;rheumatismus&quot;, ultimately from Greek ῥευματίζομαι &quot;to suffer from a flux&quot;, with &quot;rheum&quot; meaning bodily fluids, i.e., any discharge of blood or bodily fluid.

Before the 17th century, the joint pain which was thought to be caused by viscous humours seeping into the joints was always referred to as gout, a word adopted in Middle English from Old French &quot;gote&quot; &quot;a drop; the gout, rheumatism&quot;.

The English term &quot;rheumatism&quot; in the current sense has been in use since the late 17th century, as it was believed that chronic joint pain was caused by excessive flow of &quot;rheum&quot; which means bodily fluids into a joint.

<doc id="593501" wikidata="Q5584750" url="?curid=593501" title="Gordon, New South Wales">
<text>Gordon is a suburb on the Upper North Shore of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia north-west of the Sydney Central Business District and is the administrative centre for the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council. East Gordon is a locality within Gordon, and West Gordon is a locality within West Pymble.

== Geography ==
Gordon is located on the northern outskirts, about 18 kilometres from the Sydney central business district in the upper area of the North Shore. Most of the suburb is residential and sits within bushland along the banks of Stony Creek.

== History ==
The name &#x27;Gordon&#x27; first appears as the name of the survey parish covering most of the upper north shore, assigned by the NSW Surveyor-General Sir Thomas Mitchell. This is believed to commemorate Sir Willoughby Gordon, with whom he had served during the Peninsular War and who was the quartermaster-general of the regiment in which Mitchell had served. The survey parish, and later suburb and municipality of Willoughby also commemorates his name.

Settlement of the area commenced about 1820. The early settlement at Gordon was originally known as Lane Cove. The earliest school at &#x27;Lane Cove&#x27;, as Gordon was then known, was established at the behest of Governor Macquarie in 1816. The first Lane Cove Post Office opened on 1 February 1860. The name of the village and Post Office was changed to Gordon, after the Gordondale estate of Robert McIntosh, on 1 June 1879. Gordon Railway Station on the North Shore Line was built in 1888.

The first meeting of the Ku-ring-gai Shire Council was held at the Parish Hall of St John&#x27;s Anglican Church in Gordon on 8 December 1906. In 1911, a small Shire Council building was built on what is today the Pacific Highway, where Gordon currently remains the administration of local government.

Gordon saw a boom in residential development from World War I. Many middle-class families started to move into the area, attracted by its proximity to Sydney&#x27;s Central Business District (CBD), improved transport connections and the leafy, more suburban atmosphere it offered, compared to the inner-city areas. The development was particularly influenced by the housing boom of the 1920s, with large homes being built on sizeable blocks of land. Gordon became a popular location for professionals and families, who looked to escape the congestion of inner-city living while still being able to commute to work in Sydney. Many of the suburb&#x27;s houses built during the period were in the mix of Federation and Californian Bungalow styles, typical of its era.

In the late 20th century, Gordon was the Australian headquarters of Sun Microsystems Australia (opposite the present Gordon library site). It also had a significant Ikea store on the corner of the Pacific Highway and Ryde Road (opposite the former 3M site on the northern or Pymble side of the intersection, circa 2014-2020 under legally frustrated intent to renovate for use by Bunnings).

Gordon Private Hospital was opened in July 2018.

=== Gordon Public School ===
The former Gordon Public School, now largely demolished and rebuilt as the library and police station, was constructed in 1878 on the Pacific Highway, having been designed by George Mansfield. A Gothic Revival style was used in accordance with the tradition that educational buildings, like churches, were designed in a Gothic style. A second block was added in 1912. The school was originally called Lane Cove School, and the name was officially changed to Gordon Public School in November 1885. The school buildings are one of the few remaining buildings that date back to the pioneering days of northern Sydney. It is listed on the Register of the National Estate. The Gordon Public School was closed in 1989, however East Gordon Public School and West Gordon Public School remain nearby.

=== Heritage listings ===
Gordon has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 17 McIntosh Street: &quot;Eryldene&quot;, Gordon
* Middlemiss Street: Gordon railway station, Sydney
* 691 Pacific Highway: &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, Gordon
* 707 Pacific Highway: &quot;Tulkiyan&quot;
* 799 Pacific Highway: Gordon Public School (former)

In addition, Gordon is home to Sydney&#x27;s largest flying fox colony, land for the protection of which was jointly purchased by the Heritage Council of New South Wales and Ku-ring-gai Council.

=== Notable former residents ===
* Dr John Bradfield (1867–1943), chief engineer of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, lived in Gordon where his grave is located at St Johns Anglican Church. Bradfield also lends his name to the electoral division of Bradfield which contains part of Gordon.
* Tim Schenken, a Formula One driver, was born in Gordon.
* Annie Wyatt was the founder of the National Trust in Australia. She lived for a time in a single-storey cottage in Park Avenue.
* Professor Eben Gowrie Waterhouse, academic linguist, Goethe Medal recipient, camellia breeder, Sydney University garden designer and trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales.
* Clover Moore, Lord Mayor of Sydney, grew up in Gordon.

== Transport ==
Gordon is located on a major transport artery, the Pacific Highway and near the intersection of Ryde and Mona Vale roads which form a link between the Northern Beaches, Homebush Bay and the St George District and Sutherland Shire.

Gordon railway station is on the North Shore railway line of the Sydney Trains network with frequent commuter services and express rail services during peak hours. The railway station was built in 1888 and has an important heritage relationship with its landscaped gardens – it has been preserved as an example of a historic Edwardian station. Lifts to the platforms have been recently added. A bus stop outside the station is a terminus for various routes including those to St Ives, West Pymble, Mona Vale/Warriewood and Macquarie University. These are operated by CDC NSW.

== Churches and education ==
Churches in Gordon comprise: St Johns Anglican Church (with an adjoining cemetery and columbarium), Gordon Uniting Church, Gordon Baptist Church and The Liberal Catholic Church of St. Francis.

Gordon is home to two schools:
*Gordon East Public School (K–6)
*Ravenswood School for Girls (K–12)

Gordon West Public School is named after the suburb, but is located in West Pymble.

Gordon Community Preschool supports children from 3–5 years of age.

== Commercial ==
Gordon has a commercial area with many shops and restaurants along the Pacific Highway and around Gordon railway station. Gordon Centre, is a shopping centre owned by Charter Hall which includes a Harvey Norman, Woolworths and many stores and offices. Gordon Centre was originally built as a Farmers &amp; Co department store, now part of Myer, before reopening as Gordon Centre in 1985. McDonald&#x27;s is also located nearby on the Pacific Highway (southbound side). Gordon Village Arcade is a shopping arcade also owned by Charter Hall and includes many stores including a post office. Gordon Private Hospital located on the Pacific Highway specialises in the treatment of mental health and is a teaching hospital affiliated with UNSW.

The administrative buildings for the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council are located in Gordon.

==Sports==
Rugby Union is the most popular sport in Gordon, and is represented in by the Gordon Rugby Football Club, known as the Gordon Highlanders in the Shute Shield, and the Gordon Gazelles in the Sydney Women&#x27;s Premier Rugby. A close second most popular sport is Cricket and is represented by the Gordon District Cricket Club. Both the Cricket and Rugby Union clubs representing Gordon compete at Chatswood Oval. In Rugby League, Gordon is represented by the North Sydney Bears, officially the North Sydney District Rugby League Football Club. Despite departing the NRL after the 1999 season, and not having NRL representation since the short lived Northern Eagles joint venture with Manly Warringah, the NSDRLFC is the only club that does not compete in the NRL (Although there have been ongoing efforts to resurrect the Bears back into the NRL) in any form (Including joint ventures) to have a Junior Rugby League District. Junior Rugby League teams on the North Shore fall within the North Sydney District, in which clubs compete in a Joint District with Manly Warringah, and Gordon (The seat of Ku-ring-gai Council) is represented by the team that more specifically represents the LGA, the Ku-ring-gai Cubs, who play at Memorial Park in Turramurra

== Residential ==
&quot;Eryldene&quot; is a local historic house that is open to the public. Located in McIntosh Street, the house was designed for Professor Eben Gowrie Waterhouse by William Hardy Wilson and built circa 1913. The extensive garden is a significant part of the property in its own right. House and garden as a whole are listed on the Register of the National Estate. The house also has a state heritage listing.

Another notable home in the area is &quot;Tulkiyan&quot;, located on the Pacific Highway. This home was designed by Bertrand James Waterhouse, an architect who was popular for his residential work (he was also responsible for the design of &quot;Nutcote&quot;, the home of painter May Gibbs). He designed &quot;Tulkiyan&quot; in the Arts and Crafts style that he favoured in much of his work. &quot;Tulkiyan&quot; was built on part of a land grant that went back to 1823. The land changed hands many times until it was acquired by the Donaldson family, who commissioned Waterhouse to design the house. It stayed in the hands of the Donaldson family until 1994, when it was bequeathed to Ku-ring-gai Council. &quot;Tulkiyan&quot; has a state heritage listing.

The Arts and Crafts style favoured by Waterhouse was just one of the styles that were part of the Federation period that went from 1890 to 1915. Other prominent styles were the Federation Queen Anne style—the Australian version of the English Queen Anne style—and the Federation Bungalow style. Some notable examples of the latter style can be seen in Nelson Street, Gordon. Other architects who favoured Federation styles were Walter Liberty Vernon and Howard Joseland.

Gordon is also the location of a notable house designed by the architect Alexander Stewart Jolly. &quot;Nebraska&quot;, in Yarabah Avenue, is a distinctive home reminiscent of a log cabin. One of its features is the irregular stonework. It is heritage-listed.

45.3% of occupied private dwellings in Gordon are separate houses, 48.3% are flats, units or apartments and 3.5% are semi-detached (mainly townhouses). The average household consists of 2.7 people.

==Population==
At the 2021 census, there were 8,795 residents in Gordon.
* The population of Gordon was about the same age as the rest of New South Wales, with a median age of 39 compared to the national median of 38, and 15.8% of people aged 65 years and over.

<doc id="593502" wikidata="Q6552459" url="?curid=593502" title="Lindfield, New South Wales">
<text>Lindfield is a suburb on the Upper North Shore of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is 13 kilometres north-west of the Sydney Central Business District and is in the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council. East Lindfield is a separate suburb to the east, sharing the postcode of 2070.

This suburb of 5.17 square kilometres contains residential housing of California bungalow and federation style, in double brick and tile construction. Australian native bushland in Garigal National Park and Lane Cove National Park borders the suburb.

== History ==
Lindfield was originally the home of the Kuringgai indigenous people.

Europeans first became active in the area in around 1810, when the colonial government set up a timber gathering camp staffed by convicts. By the 1840s, fruit growing and farming became the suburb&#x27;s primary industries. Settlement began to increase in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The Lindfield railway station opened in 1890, and Lindfield Post Office opened on 5 January 1895. Land values increased in the area around the railway and more professionals moved into the area.

The name &quot;Lindfield&quot; means a clearing in the lime forest, and derives from the name given by an early landowner, Francis List, to a cottage he built in the area in 1884. List likely named his cottage after Lindfield, Sussex, England. When a railway line came through the area in 1890s, the name of the property was used to identify the station and neighbourhood.

Lindfield saw significant development during the early 20th century, with a mix of housing, schools and commercial buildings. It bolstered the expansion of public transport, including bus routes, and later, the introduction of trolley buses in the 1930s. It became a popular area for families looking for a suburban lifestyle in close proximity to the Sydney CBD.

During the years after World War II the suburb experienced significant growth. 

== Heritage listings ==
Lindfield has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 33 Tryon Road: Tryon Road Uniting Church

== Infrastructure and development ==
Lindfield railway station is on the North Shore railway line of the Sydney Trains network and is about 30 minutes by train from the Sydney central business district. The Pacific Highway is the main arterial road through Lindfield. Lindfield has a small commercial area on both sides of Lindfield railway station on the Pacific Highway and Lindfield Avenue. The former Commonwealth Bank is an art deco style building on the Pacific Highway.

Lindfield Library is a branch of the Ku-ring-gai Municipal Library Network. There are two community halls: East Lindfield Community Hall at Crana Avenue and West Lindfield Community Hall at Moore Avenue. There are two tennis courts at Lindfield Community Centre (behind the library) and a further two courts at Lindfield Park in Tryon Road.

It offered courses in business, nursing and midwifery, education and travel. The site was then closed in 2015 while an extensive interior fitout was undertaken. It was reopened ahead of the 2019 school year as The Lindfield Learning Village, an unconventional K-12 public school.

<doc id="593505" wikidata="Q511097" url="?curid=593505" title="Psoriatic arthritis">
<text>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a long-term inflammatory arthritis that occurs in people affected by the autoimmune disease psoriasis. The classic features of psoriatic arthritis include dactylitis (sausage-like appearance), skin lesions, and nail lesions. Damage to the nails can include small depressions in the nail (pitting), thickening of the nails, and detachment of the nail from the nailbed. Skin damage consistent with psoriasis (e.g., red, scaly, and itchy plaques) frequently occurs before the onset of psoriatic arthritis but psoriatic arthritis can precede the rash in 15% of affected individuals. It is classified as a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy.
Genetics are thought to be strongly involved in the development of psoriatic arthritis. Obesity and certain forms of psoriasis are thought to increase the risk. 

Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30% of people with psoriasis and occurs in children and adults. Some people with PsA never get psoriasis.

The condition is less common in people of Asian or African descent and affects men and women equally.

== Signs and symptoms ==

===Peripheral pain===
The majority of patients with PsA experience peripheral joint involvement. Pain, swelling, or stiffness in one or more joints is commonly present in psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is inflammatory, and affected joints are generally red or warm to the touch. Asymmetrical oligoarthritis, defined as inflammation affecting two to four joints during the first six months of disease, is present in 70% of cases. However, in 15% of cases, the arthritis is symmetrical. 

The joints of the hand that are involved in psoriasis are the proximal interphalangeal, the distal interphalangeal, the metacarpophalangeal joint, and the wrist. Involvement of the distal interphalangeal joints is a characteristic feature in many cases.

Sausage-like swelling in the fingers or toes, known as dactylitis, occurs in about 40% of PsA cases.

PsA may cause shoulder pain, most commonly felt in the front of the shoulder or the upper part of the arm. It is usually felt when moving the arm and may only be noticed in certain movements. In addition, many people find it painful when lying on the sore side in bed at night.

Enthesitis can occur, causing pain over a wider area around the joint. Pain can also occur in and around the feet and ankles, especially enthesitis in the Achilles tendon (inflammation of the Achilles tendon where it inserts into the bone) or plantar fasciitis in the sole of the foot.

===Axial pain===
Approximately 25–70% of PsA patients have axial involvement.
Axial pain can occur in the area of the sacrum (the lower back, above the tailbone), as a result of sacroiliitis or spondylitis, which is present in 40% of cases.

===Nails===
Nail psoriasis has been found to have a strong association of 80% to 90% with PsA across multiple studies. PsA classically affects the distal interphalangeal joint, which is the joint closest to the nail. Nail pitting often accompanies distal interphalangeal joint involvement and may be essential in differentiating psoriatic arthritis from other diseases.
Psoriasis can also cause damage to the nails, such as pitting or separation from the nail bed, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis under the nails, and horizontal ridging.

===Psoriasis===
Psoriasis classically presents with scaly skin lesions, which are most commonly seen over extensor surfaces such as the scalp, natal cleft, and umbilicus.

===Fatigue===
Severe fatigue is present in approximately 30% of patients with PsA. It is sometimes described as extreme exhaustion that does not go away with adequate rest. The fatigue may be caused directly by the disease itself, or be a secondary effect of other factors.

A small (n=247) 2023 study found poor sleep quality was common among patients with psoriatic arthritis.

===Complications===
Rare complications are uveitis in one or both eyes, slightly higher risk of heart conditions, and increased risks of Crohn&#x27;s disease and of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

===Pattern of activity===
Psoriatic arthritis may remain mild or may progress to more destructive joint disease. Periods of active disease, or flares, will typically alternate with periods of remission. In severe forms, psoriatic arthritis may progress to arthritis mutilans which on X-ray gives a &quot;pencil-in-cup&quot; appearance.

===HLA-B27===
Approximately 40–50% of individuals with psoriatic arthritis have the HLA-B27 genotype. Whilst the incidence of psoriatic arthritis is significantly higher among people positive for HLA-B27 (compared to the overall population), the vast majority of people with HLA-B27 will not have psoriatic arthritis. For instance in the US HLA-B27 incidence is 6-8%, whilst psoriatic arthritis incidence has been estimated at 0.06–0.25%.

== Causes ==

Psoriatic arthritis is an inheritable polygenic disease, with many genes known or theorized to contribute to its clinical presentation (or lack thereof). When someone with the genes for psoriatic arthritis comes into contact with certain substances, these substances may induce an autoimmune reaction, causing the immune system to target normal tissues in the body. The exact strength, location, and clinical effects of this reaction depend on which genes are involved for each individual. The substance that triggers the reaction is typically not known.

Genomic analysis has identified several genes involved in some patients, notably genes related to class I MHC including HLA-B*08, HLA-B*27, HLA-B*38, and HLA-B*39. Other genes relating to the immune system and central tolerance may also be involved, such as interleukin receptor genes. Thematically, these genes are often those that identify human tissues as normal and healthy, or the genes in immune cells designed to recognize those identifiers. In the case of psoriatic arthritis, the genes targeting immune cells are overexpressed, which leads to an increase in the recruitment of phagocytic neutrophils present in psoriatic skin lesions, hereby increasing inflammation and phagocytosis of healthy cells. If the genes are functioning abnormally, then the immune system has a higher risk of attacking normal tissues.

Bone cells such as osteoclasts are theorized to be involved in patients with psoriatic arthritis, in contrast to most people with psoriasis whose bone cells are not significantly involved in the disease.

Health and environmental factors known to be associated with psoriatic arthritis include:

* Current, or history of, severe psoriasis
* Disease of the finger/toenails
* Obesity
* Tissue trauma, or deep lesions associated with sites of trauma

== Diagnosis ==
There is no definitive test to diagnose psoriatic arthritis. 

Several classification criteria have been proposed, but they have wide variability.

A rheumatologist (a physician specializing in autoimmune diseases) may use physical examinations, health history, blood tests, and X-rays to accurately diagnose psoriatic arthritis.

Factors that contribute to a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis include the following:
* Psoriasis in the patient, or a family history of psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis.
* A negative test result for rheumatoid factor, a blood factor associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
* Arthritis symptoms in the distal interphalangeal articulations of hand (the joints closest to the tips of the fingers). This is not typical of rheumatoid arthritis.
* Ridging or pitting of fingernails or toenails (onycholysis), which is associated with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
* Radiologic images demonstrating degenerative joint damage.

Other symptoms that are more typical of psoriatic arthritis than other forms of arthritis include enthesitis (inflammation in the Achilles tendon (at the back of the heel) or the plantar fascia (bottom of the feet)), and dactylitis (sausage-like swelling of the fingers or toes).

===Imaging===

===Differential diagnosis===
Several conditions can mimic the clinical presentation of psoriatic arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, reactive arthritis, gouty arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel disease-associated arthritis. 

In contrast to psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect the proximal joints (e.g., the metacarpophalangeal joints), involves a greater number of joints than psoriatic arthritis, and affects them symmetrically. Involvement of the spinal joints is more suggestive of psoriatic arthritis than rheumatoid arthritis. 
Rheumatoid factor (RF) and cyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibodies are typically found in the blood of people with RA, but not, as a rule, in those with PsA.

Comorbidities may help differential diagnosis.

Osteoarthritis shares certain clinical features with psoriatic arthritis such as its tendency to affect multiple distal joints in an asymmetric pattern. Unlike psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis does not typically involve inflammation of the sacroiliac joint. 

Psoriatic arthritis sometimes affects only one joint and is sometimes confused for gout or pseudogout when this happens.

=== Classification ===
There are five main types of psoriatic arthritis:

* Oligoarticular: This type affects around 70% of patients and is generally mild. This type does not occur in the same joints on both sides of the body and usually only involves fewer than 3 joints.
* Polyarticular: This type accounts for around 25% of cases, and affects five or more joints on both sides of the body simultaneously. This type is most similar to rheumatoid arthritis and is disabling in around 50% of all cases.
* Arthritis mutilans (): Affects less than 5% of patients and is a severe, deforming, and destructive arthritis. This condition can progress over months or years causing severe joint damage. Arthritis mutilans has also been called chronic absorptive arthritis and may be seen in rheumatoid arthritis.
* Spondyloarthritis (): This type is characterized by stiffness of the neck or the sacroiliac joint of the spine, but can also affect the hands and feet, in a similar fashion to symmetric arthritis.
* Distal interphalangeal predominant (): This type of psoriatic arthritis is found in about 5% of patients and is characterized by inflammation and stiffness in the joints nearest to the ends of the fingers and toes. Nail damage is often marked.

== Management ==
Because prolonged inflammation can lead to joint damage, early diagnosis and treatment to slow or prevent joint damage is recommended.

The underlying process in psoriatic arthritis is inflammation; therefore, treatments are directed at reducing and controlling inflammation. The first-line initial treatment for most patients is a TNF inhibitor-type biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD).

The goal of treatment is to achieve minimal or low disease activity. The criteria for minimal disease activity is meeting five of these seven criteria and low disease activity/remission is achieved when all seven criteria are fulfilled: (1) tender joint count ≤1, (2) tender entheseal joints ≤1, (3) swollen joint count ≤1, (4) PASI ≤1 or BSA ≤3%, (5) patient pain VAS ≤15, (6) patient global disease activity VAS ≤20, (7) HAQ ≤0.5.

=== Biological DMARDs ===
Biologics (also called biological response modifiers) are a class of therapeutics developed using recombinant DNA technology. Biologic medications are derived from living cells cultured in a laboratory. Unlike traditional DMARDs that affect the entire immune system, biologics target specific parts of the immune system. They are given by injection or intravenous (IV) infusion.

Biologics prescribed for psoriatic arthritis are TNF-α inhibitors, including infliximab, etanercept, golimumab, certolizumab pegol and adalimumab, as well as the IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor ustekinumab, the IL-17A inhibitor secukinumab, and the IL-23 inhibitor risankizumab.

Biologics may increase the risk of minor and serious infections. More rarely, they may be associated with nervous system disorders, blood disorders or certain types of cancer.

=== Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ===

Typically the medications first prescribed for psoriatic arthritis are NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and naproxen, followed by more potent NSAIDs like diclofenac, indomethacin, and etodolac. NSAIDs can irritate the stomach and intestine, and long-term use can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding. Coxibs (COX-2 inhibitors) e.g. celecoxib or etoricoxib, are associated with a statistically significant 50 to 66% relative risk reduction in gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding complications compared to traditional NSAIDs, but carry an increased rate of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack, and stroke. Both COX-2 inhibitors and other non-selective NSAIDs have potential adverse effects that include damage to the kidneys.

=== Conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ===

Oral small molecules such as methotrexate, leflunomide, cyclosporin, azathioprine, and sulfasalazine are used in persistent symptomatic cases without exacerbation. Rather than just reducing pain and inflammation, this class of drugs helps slow down or halt the progression of the disease, and therefore limit the amount of joint damage that occurs. Most DMARDs act slowly and may take weeks or even months to take full effect. According to a recent Cochrane review, low dose oral methotrexate was slightly more effective than placebos. Immunosuppressant drugs can also reduce psoriasis skin symptoms but can lead to liver and kidney problems and an increased risk of serious infection.

=== Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors ===
A first-in-class treatment option for the management of psoriatic arthritis is apremilast, a small molecule phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved for use by the FDA in 2014. By inhibiting PDE4, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP levels rise, resulting in the down-regulation of various pro-inflammatory factors including TNF-α, interleukin 17 and interleukin 23, as well as the up-regulation of anti-inflammatory factor interleukin 10.

It is given in tablet form and taken by mouth. Side effects include headaches, back pain, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections, as well as depression and weight loss.

It was patented in 2014 and manufactured by Celgene. There is no current generic equivalent available on the market.

=== JAK inhibitors ===
The JAK1 inhibitors tofacitinib (Xeljanz) and upadacitinib (Rinvoq) are approved for the use in active psoriatic arthritis. The TYK2 inhibitor deucravacitinib (Sotyktu), which has been approved for plaque psoriasis, is currently undergoing a Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety on psoriatic arthritis. The Takeda TYK2 inhibitor TAK-279 recently demonstrated a 20% improvement in signs and symptoms of disease at week 12 as compared to placebo in a Phase II clinical trial. Takeda also plans to initiate a Phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAK-279.

=== Other treatments ===

A review found tentative evidence of benefit of low level laser therapy and concluded that it could be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated RA.

Photochemotherapy with methoxsalen and long-wave ultraviolet light (PUVA therapy) are used for severe skin lesions. Doctors may use joint injections with corticosteroids in cases where one joint is severely affected. In psoriatic arthritis patients with severe joint damage orthopedic surgery may be implemented to correct joint destruction, usually with the use of a joint replacement. Surgery is effective for pain alleviation, correcting joint disfigurement, and reinforcing joint usefulness and strength.

===Management of fatigue===
Changes in lifestyle may help manage fatigue.

== Epidemiology ==

Reviews have found psoriatic arthritis incidence globally of 0.11%, with incidence in the USA of 0.06–0.25% and in Europe of 0.19% (95% CI 0.16–0.32). Other studies found an overall prevalence rate of 0.1-0.2%, affecting men and women equally, and an incidence rate of 0.006% annually, 
70% of people who develop psoriatic arthritis first show signs of psoriasis on the skin, 15% develop skin psoriasis and arthritis at the same time, and 15% develop skin psoriasis following the onset of psoriatic arthritis. Some people with PsA never get psoriasis.

Psoriatic arthritis can develop in people who have any level severity of psoriatic skin disease, ranging from mild to very severe. Studies have found that obesity is a significant risk factor and predictor of disease outcome. Other risk factors associated with an increased risk of developing psoriatic arthritis include severe psoriasis, nail psoriasis, scalp psoriasis, inverse psoriasis, and having a first-degree relative with psoriatic arthritis.

Psoriatic arthritis tends to appear about 10 years after the first signs of psoriasis. For the majority of people, this is between the ages of 30 and 55, but the disease can also affect children. The onset of psoriatic arthritis symptoms before symptoms of skin psoriasis is more common in children than adults.

More than 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis will have psoriatic nail lesions characterized by nail pitting, separation of the nail from the underlying nail bed, ridging and cracking, or more extremely, loss of the nail itself (onycholysis).

Enthesitis is observed in 30 to 50% of patients and most commonly involves the plantar fascia and Achilles’ tendon, but it may cause pain around the patella, iliac crest, epicondyles, and supraspinatus insertions

Men and women are equally affected by this condition. Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is more common among Caucasians than African or Asian people.

==Prevention==
Some progress has been made in preventing patients with psoriasis from developing psoriatic arthritis. However, once psoriatic arthritis is established, the inflammatory burden of psoriatic disease might not be susceptible to modulation in many patients.

Ylivieska is also the commercial center of the Oulu South region, the southern part of the late Oulu province.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish. The word &quot;Yli&quot; means &quot;upper&quot;, while the word &quot;Vieska&quot; is supposed to mean a &quot;shallow ford&quot;.

== Geography ==
Ylivieska is located in Northern Ostrobothnia about south of the city of Oulu. Other close cities near Ylivieska are Vaasa () and Kokkola (); the neighbouring municipalities are Oulainen, Haapavesi, Nivala, Sievi, Kalajoki, Alavieska and Merijärvi.

The town is characterized by the Kalajoki River, which runs SE–NW through the town centre. The agricultural and economical area of the Kalajoki river basin is known as Kalajokilaakso.

Ylivieska is situated along the Ostrobothnia railway, which leads from Helsinki, the national capital, to Rovaniemi in the north of the country. The railway was opened in 1886 and it has had a significant role in the town&#x27;s economical development. Ylivieska is junction station with services to Iisalmi and other Eastern Finland. There are also coach services to Jyväskylä and Kajaani.

In recent decades, the role of agriculture has reduced following the development of industry and services. Currently, Ylivieska is home to about 30 industrial enterprises, some of which are also internationally recognized in their respective niche markets.

Regionally, Ylivieska has become an important place for car buyers. There are several stores and agents selling new and used cars, and purchases average about 6,000 cars per year.

<text>Coolah is a town in the central western part of New South Wales, Australia in Warrumbungle Shire. At the 2016 census, Coolah had a population of 1,290. The name Coolah is derived from the Port Jackson Pidgin English word meaning &quot;angry&quot;.

== Council ==

===Current composition and election method===

Ku-ring-gai Council is composed of ten councillors elected proportionally as five separate wards, each electing two councillors. All councillors are elected for a fixed four-year term of office. The mayor is elected bi-annually by the councillors at the first meeting of the council, while the deputy mayor is elected annually. The most recent election was held on 14 September 2024, and the makeup of the council is as follows:

==Council history==
Ku-ring-gai was first incorporated on 6 March 1906 as the &quot;Shire of Ku-ring-gai&quot; and the first Shire Council was elected on 24 November 1906. The first leader of the council was elected at the first meeting on 8 December 1906, when Councillor William Cowan was elected as Shire President. There would not be a Deputy President until the council election on 1 March 1920.

On 22 September 1928, the Shire of Ku-ring-gai was proclaimed as the &quot;Municipality of Ku-ring-gai&quot; and the titles of &#x27;Shire President&#x27; and &#x27;Councillor&#x27; were retitled to be &#x27;Mayor&#x27; and &#x27;Alderman&#x27; respectively. In 1993, with the passing of a new Local Government Act, council was retitled as simply &quot;Ku-ring-gai Council&quot; and aldermen were retitled as councillors.

A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that Ku-ring-gai Council and parts of the Hornsby Shire north of the M2 merge to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 270,000. The Ku-ring-gai Council took the NSW Government to court and, on appeal, the NSW Court of Appeal found that the council had been denied procedural fairness. The proposed merger was stood aside indefinitely. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the Hornsby and Ku-ring-gai local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers.

===Planning and development===
During the term of former Planning Minister, Frank Sartor, planning law reforms were passed that gave development approval to a panel and away from local government. These new laws were controversially implemented in Ku-ring-gai, with immense opposition from the local population who claim that their suburbs, with nationally recognised heritage values in both housing and original native forest, are being trashed by slab-sided apartment developments with no effective protection provided by either the Ku-ring-gai Council or the state government. This has been termed &quot;The Rape of Ku-ring-gai&quot;.

The laws are intended to take development approval power away from local councils and to the Planning NSW, via the development panels. Planning panels are about to be introduced across New South Wales under recently passed planning reforms. In 2005–06, Ku-ring-gai had the second highest reported total development value in the state – A$1.7 billion, more than Parramatta, second only to the City of Sydney.

<doc id="593520" wikidata="Q7593405" url="?curid=593520" title="St Ives, New South Wales">
<text>St Ives is a suburb on the Upper North Shore of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia 18 kilometres north of the Sydney Central Business District in the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council. St Ives Chase is a separate adjacent area, designated suburb, to the west and north.

==History==
The St Ives area was first explored by Governor Arthur Phillip and a party of men in 1788 where they set up a campsite at Bungaroo which is close to what is now Hunter Avenue. The area produced a small-scale timber felling industry. There are still some examples of the thirty-metre and higher trees in nearby Pymble in the Dalrymple-Hay Nature Reserve and near Canisius College. Native turpentine trees were also once abundant and provided useful timber for cabinet making. It was once known for its apple orchards, but due to residential demand, there is no longer any commercial fruit growing in the area. During the Second World War, there were significant numbers of troops barracked in the area, which provided the impetus to build Archbold Road as a supplementary and emergency route to the city. Since 1950 the suburb has expanded from the central shopping areas and the arterial main roads to include hilltop and valley areas bordering on the surrounding Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park to the north, now the area known as St Ives Chase, and Garigal National Park to the east and the south-east.

St Ives Post Office opened on 10 November 1885 and the first public school opened on 6 May 1889. The school was formally opened by John Burns, MLA on Saturday 8 June. After inspecting the &quot;neat and well-designed school and teacher&#x27;s residence&quot; the party had a luncheon to mark the occasion.

St Ives was initially slow to develop due to the perceived remoteness from the city. Settlement increased in the late 1890s, when St Ives was populated by market gardeners, a small dairy, orchard workers and related industries. The suburb since the end of the Second World War has seen its most rapid period of expansion and a steady growth in families moving to the area.

Nowadays, St Ives is recognised in the Greater Sydney Region as a relatively safe and wealthy suburb. According to the 2021 Australian Federal Census, St Ives has a median weekly household income of $2,888, well above the state average of $1,829.

==Commercial area==
St Ives Shopping Village is a medium-sized shopping centre that opened in the 1960s. The centre has over 110 stores, its main tenants are Harris Farm Markets, Coles and Woolworths.

The Village Green is a popular park in St Ives. Village Green is directly opposite of St Ives Shopping Village. The park is bordered by three streets: Memorial Avenue, Village Green Parade and Cowan Road. The park includes sporting fields, baseball fields, tennis courts and a skate park. Furthermore, the Village Green hosts the annual Festival on the Green.

<text>Agder is a county () and traditional region in the southern part of Norway and is coextensive with the Southern Norway region. The county was established on 1 January 2020, when the old Vest-Agder and Aust-Agder counties were merged. Since the early 1900s, the term Sørlandet (&quot;south country, south land, southland&quot;) has been commonly used for this region, sometimes with the inclusion of neighbouring Rogaland. Before that time, the area was considered a part of Western Norway.

The area was a medieval petty kingdom, and after Norway&#x27;s unification became known as &quot;Egdafylki&quot; and later &quot;Agdesiden&quot;, a county within the kingdom of Norway. The name Agder was not used after 1662, when the area was split into smaller governmental units called Nedenæs, Råbyggelaget, Lister, and Mandal. The name was resurrected in 1919 when two counties of Norway that roughly corresponded to the old Agdesiden county were renamed Aust-Agder (East Agder) and Vest-Agder (West Agder). Even before the two counties joined in 2020, they cooperated in many ways; the University of Agder had sites in both Aust-Agder and Vest-Agder, as did many other institutions, such as the Diocese of Agder og Telemark, the Agder Court of Appeal, and the Agder Police District.

==Name==
The name &quot;Agder&quot; is older than the Norwegian language. Its meaning is not known. Just as the Norwegian language derives from Old Norse, Agder derives from the Old Norse word &quot;Agðir&quot;. In the early Viking Age, before Harald Fairhair, Agðir was a petty kingdom inhabited by a people named after it, the Egðir.

Nothing in Old Norse gives any hint as to the word&#x27;s meaning; it was not produced (from known segments) in Old Norse, which means the name is older still. The Egðir are believed to be the same etymologically as the &quot;Augandzi&quot; people mentioned in the &quot;Getica&quot; of Jordanes, who wrote of Scandza (Scandinavia) in the 6th century. If Jordanes&#x27;s Scandza is a palatalized form of *Scandia, then Augandzi is likely a palatalized form of *Augandii, residents of *Augandia.

A name of that period would have to be closer to Proto-Germanic; in fact, a word of that period does present itself and fits the geographical lore of the times: *agwjō (meaning &quot;island&quot;), which Jordanes and all his predecessors writing of Scandinavia believed it to be. A simple metathesis produces a possibly late form, *augjo-, but this derivation is speculative. There is no other evidence on Auganza, and its connection to Egder is hypothetical too.

== Municipalities ==
On 1 January 1838, the formannskapsdistrikt law went into effect, creating local municipalities all over Norway. The municipalities have changed over time through mergers and divisions as well as numerous boundary adjustments. When Agder county was established on 1 January 2020, it had 25 municipalities.

==History==
Norway of the Viking Age was divided into petty kingdoms ruled by chiefs who contended for land, maritime supremacy, or political ascendance and sought alliances or control through marriage with other royal families, either voluntary or forced. These circumstances produced the generally turbulent and heroic lives recorded in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;.

For example, the Ynglinga saga tells us that Harald Redbeard, chief of Agðir, refused his daughter Åsa to Gudröd Halvdanson, on which event Gudröd invaded Agðir, killed Harald and his son Gyrd, and took Åsa whether she would or no. She bore a son, Halvdan (the Black), and later arranged to have Gudröd assassinated. Among the royal families, these events seem to have been rather ordinary. Her word was the last in the argument, as her grandson, Harald Fairhair, unified Norway.

;Kings of Agder

;;Legendary Kings
* Harald Agderking 
* Víkar
* Kissa

;;Monarchs of Agder (790–987)
* Harald Granraude, 7??–815, father of Åsa
* Åsa, between 815 and 834–838, mother of Halfdan the Black
* Halfdan the Black, father of Harald Fairhair, from 838
* Kjotve the Rich, late 9th century
* Harald Gudrødsson Grenske, 976–987

Prior to the Viking Age is a gap in the region&#x27;s history for a few hundred years, but in Jordanes we also find regions of the same but earlier forms of names, presumably also petty kingdoms under now unknown chiefs. The previous most credible source, Ptolemy, gives the briefest of sketches, only citing all of Norway as the Chaedini (&quot;country people&quot;). Perhaps the difference between kingdoms was not sufficiently important to cite them individually.

Prior to then the most credible and respected source, Tacitus in &quot;Germania&quot; Chapter 44 described the Suiones, who were divided into civitates (kingdoms?) along the coast of Scandinavia and were unusual in owning fleets of a special type of ship. These were pointed on both ends and were driven by banks of oars that could be rearranged or shipped for river passage. They did not depend on sail (so Tacitus says) but other than that they do not differ from Viking ships. These civitates went all the way around Scandinavia to the Arctic, or at least to regions of very long days, where they stopped.

It seems clear that in the Roman Iron Age Norway was populated by people of the same identity as Sweden, who were called the Suiones by Latin sources. In settling the coast at some point in prehistory they had been divided into civitates by the terrain. These states took on mainly geographical names or names of individuals or mythological characters. Agder was one of them.

After the unification of Norway by Harold Fairhair and army and allies in the 10th century, all the civitates became provinces () and after their conversion to Christianity, they became dioceses or parishes. The development of Old Norse into local dialects and the dissimilation of customs due to isolation added an ethnic flavor to the area, which is cherished today.

<text>Comet Grigg–Skjellerup (formally designated 26P/Grigg–Skjellerup) is a periodic comet. It was visited by the &quot;Giotto&quot; probe in July 1992. The spacecraft came as close as 200 km, but could not take pictures because some instruments were damaged from its encounter with Halley&#x27;s Comet. The comet last came to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) on 25 December 2023, but was 1.8 AU from Earth and only 31 degrees from the Sun.

==History of observation==
The comet was discovered in 1902 by John Grigg of New Zealand, and rediscovered in its next appearance in 1922 by John Francis Skjellerup, an Australian then living and working for about two decades in South Africa where he was a founder member of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa. In 1987, it was belatedly discovered by Ľubor Kresák that the comet had been observed in 1808 as well, by Jean-Louis Pons. Pons observed the comet on 6 and 9 February, which was insufficient to calculate an approximate orbit.

In 1972 the comet was discovered to produce a meteor shower, the Pi Puppids, and its current orbit makes them peak around April 23, for observers in the southern hemisphere, best seen when the comet is near perihelion.

During the comet&#x27;s 1982 approach it was detected using radar by the Arecibo Observatory.

Having its recent perihelion so close to Earth&#x27;s orbit made it an easy target to reach for the &quot;Giotto&quot; spacecraft in 1992, whose primary mission was to Comet Halley. &quot;Giotto&quot; had a closest approach to Grigg–Skjellerup of 200 km, much closer than its approach to Comet Halley, but was unable to obtain images as its camera was destroyed during the Halley rendezvous in 1986.

The 2002 return (expected perihelion around October 8, 2002) was very unfavorable and no observations were reported.

==Properties==
The comet has often suffered the gravitational influence of Jupiter, which has altered its orbit considerably. For instance, its perihelion distance has changed from 0.77 AU in 1725 to 0.89 AU in 1922 to 0.99 AU in 1977 and to 1.12 AU in 1999.

The comet nucleus is estimated to be 2.6 kilometers in diameter.

The comet is a type locality for the mineral brownleeite.
== Popular culture ==
* In Neal Stephenson&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Seveneves&quot;, 26P/Grigg–Skjellerup serves as a potential source of water and rocket propellant for the &quot;Cloud Ark&quot; survivors, and is frequently referred to by the nickname &quot;Greg&#x27;s Skeleton&quot; by way of homophonic transformation.

<text>Dunedoo ( ) is a village of 1,021 inhabitants situated within the Warrumbungle Shire of central western New South Wales, Australia. Dunedoo is well known to Australian travellers due to its distinctive name (&quot;Dunny&quot; is a colloquial Australian word for a toilet). The name is actually derived from a local Aboriginal word meaning &quot;swan&quot;, which are commonly found in the area&#x27;s lagoons.
The local tip is free of charge residents are able to dump rubbish for free in the designated areas.

The town is located on the north-western edges of the Sydney basin.

==Geography and features==
Dunedoo is located above sea-level on the southern bank of the Talbragar River at the intersection of the Golden and Castlereagh Highways. It is a relatively isolated township with the two nearest rural centres of Mudgee and Dubbo situated approximately to the south and west respectively. It is due to this isolation that Dunedoo has many facilities not usually found in villages of this size. Dunedoo largely functions as a service centre to the surrounding district which focuses on the production of wheat, cattle, mixed farming, timber, lambs and wool. As with many wheat-growing centres of western New South Wales the village&#x27;s skyline is dominated by a large silo. The Dunedoo silo has Winx on it. Dunedoo also features a hospital (Dunedoo War Memorial Hospital), two schools (a government administered combined primary and high school and a catholic primary school), a licensed hotel, a small commercial area, a small freight railway station as well as sporting and special event facilities. Dunedoo also features Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian churches.

==History==
Before European settlement Dunedoo and the surrounding area was occupied by the Gamilaroi and Wiradjuri peoples. 
Allan Cunningham was the first British explorer to discover the area in 1823 while travelling Pandoras Pass over the Warrumbungle ranges to the Liverpool Plains. Surveyors studied the area in 1832 followed by squatters who settled the region. The town was founded somewhere in the 1840s and was originally known as Bolaro and later as Redbank. Dunedoo remained a small village throughout the 19th century and the nearby town of Cobbora was considered to be the regional centre for many years. However, Dunedoo&#x27;s population grew substantially after the construction of the Gwabegar railway line and the opening of passenger services in 1910.
&quot;Bolaro&quot; Post Office opened on 1 November 1876 and was renamed &quot;Dunedoo&quot; in 1909.
The first half of the 20th century saw many of Dunedoo&#x27;s residents fighting in both the first and second world wars, documented by the war memorial currently found in the town&#x27;s park. The gradual loss of railway services in western NSW affected Dunedoo in the 1960s with the loss of passenger railway services, however freight trains still commonly use the line. Other services, such as the village&#x27;s cinema, have also been lost over time.

In 2002, Dunedoo appeared in an ABC documentary entitled &quot;A Loo with a View&quot;. Dunedoo is currently suffering the fate of many small regional towns of NSW in that its population is gradually decreasing. Many locals fear that the town will eventually be deserted and thus many creative ideas have been floated as possible methods of reversing the current trend. The Dunedoo District Development Group had proposed to build &quot;The Big Dunny&quot; in the hope of attracting tourists, as the Big Banana does for Coffs Harbour and big things in other parts of Australia. The documentary centred on &quot;The Big Dunny&quot; proposal, it was to have been a three-storey high building featuring five-star toilets, visitor centre, viewing platform, and even a radio station. Local shire councillor and farmer Frank Gaden was against it, reckoning it would be an embarrassment. Feasibility consultant Ian Farlow concluded it would, unfortunately, attract only 30 visitors a day which would not be enough to make it worthwhile, and proposed instead an environmentally friendly self-composting toilet block. The council decided against the latter and in the end nothing was built.

2005 saw the town incorporated into the newly created Warrumbungle Shire, formed from the previous Coolah and Coonabarabran Shires. The town was briefly divided over the prospect of joining Coonabarabran Shire with many preferring the town be incorporated into the Mudgee-based Mid-Western Regional Council.

==Heritage listings==

==Sport and culture==
Dunedoo features many sporting facilities including Robertson Oval (used for rugby league and netball). The Dunedoo Sports club has a 9-hole golf course and four grass tennis courts, as well as two squash courts. Touch football is also played there during the summer months on part of the golf course close to the club building. Dunedoo also has a lawn bowls club. Competitions are held regularly in each of these sports within the town.

Dunedoo Swans rugby league team play in the Castlereagh Cup rugby league and produced former St George and NSW centre Brian Johnston. Their uniform features the colours green and white.

Between 1957 and 1959, the Dunedoo Car Club held four motor racing meetings on a course located on the &quot;Wargundy&quot; property approximately 10 kilometres south-east of the town. The circuit was less than a mile in length, and originally was dirt with oil bonded into the surface, although later the Club paved several corners, with the intention of paving the whole circuit in the future. Unfortunately for the Club, as the circuit was in private property, it was not covered by any lease, and existed purely on the goodwill of the owner of &quot;Wargundy&quot;. The owner withdrew the goodwill in 1959, and the circuit closed down.

Dunedoo is host to many festivals including the Dunedoo Bush Poetry Festival held annually in April by the Dunedoo District Development Group. The Dunedoo Show is held each February featuring carnival rides and several rodeo-themed events including whip-cracking and bull riding.

<doc id="593532" wikidata="Q572653" url="?curid=593532" title="Ocean Avenue (album)">
<text>Ocean Avenue is the fourth studio album by American rock band Yellowcard. It was released on July 22, 2003, through Capitol Records. After touring to promote their third album &quot;One for the Kids&quot; in 2001, the band signed to the label in early 2002. Following this, bassist Warren Cooke left the band in mid-2002, and was replaced by Inspection 12 guitarist Peter Mosely. In February and March 2003, the band recorded at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, California, with Neal Avron. &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; is a pop-punk and punk rock album, which was compared to Blink-182 and Simple Plan.

Before Yellowcard&#x27;s promotional tour of &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot;, Mosely was replaced by Alex Lewis. Yellowcard appeared on the Warped Tour, during which &quot;Way Away&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on July 22, 2003. The band went on a club tour of the United States, before going on tour with Less Than Jake and Fall Out Boy. &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; was released as the second single on December 16, 2003. Lewis departed from the band and was replaced by Mosely before a co-headlining tour with Something Corporate and a stint in Europe. &quot;Only One&quot; was released as the third and final single in June 2004; they toured Europe, Australia, and Japan. After this, they had a US tour.

&quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; received mostly positive reviews from music critics, some of whom commented on Sean Mackin&#x27;s violin playing and songwriting quality. The album peaked at number 23 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, as well as number 8 in New Zealand, and number 149 in the UK. The album was certified platinum in the US by the RIAA, gold in Canada by Music Canada, and silver in the UK by the BPI. &quot;Way Away&quot; and &quot;Only One&quot; appeared high on the US Alternative Airplay chart; &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; peaked at number 37 on the US Hot 100, and within the top 100 in Scotland and the UK alongside &quot;Way Away&quot;. &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; was certified double platinum by the RIAA and silver by the BPI. &quot;Only One&quot; was certified gold in the US.

In the years following its release, the album has received retrospective acclaim and is widely viewed as one of the greatest pop-punk albums of all time.

==Background and production==
In April 2001, Yellowcard released their third studio album &quot;One for the Kids&quot; through Lobster Records. It was promoted with a tour of the southern United States with Inspection 12, and a two-week tour of the US West Coast with Bordem. Yellowcard had moved from Florida to California, with the hopes of someone from a label would be attached to them. Harper said their manager was adamant about finding them a different label, and made pitches to a number of labels. By April 2002, it was reported that the band had signed to Capitol Records, one of a few major labels who showed interest. Harper said the interest came from a friend of their booking agent, who in turn was friends with an A&amp;R representative at Capitol. This person had seen the band live at six-to-seven of their gigs and won over others at the label. The band subsequently met with Capitol and two other labels, ultimately picking Capitol. Harper explained that Capitol were &quot;just the coolest people. Their president, their vibe, and everything - they have a big catalogue&quot; of acts such as the Beatles, Megadeth, and Pink Floyd. Frontman Ryan Key also reasoned that listeners were unable to purchase &quot;One for the Kids&quot; in stores due to a lack of distribution and wanted a label that could rectify that.

In June and July 2002, the band appeared on Warped Tour, which coincided with the release of the band&#x27;s second EP &quot;The Underdog EP&quot; on July 2, through Fueled by Ramen. Capitol Records had licensed the EP to Fueled by Ramen as not to lose the band punk credibility. Two days after its release, bassist Warren Cooke left the band, citing personal reasons; violinist Sean Mackin said there was in-fighting between them up to eight months before this occurred. Cooke spot was temporarily filled by members of other acts on the tour, Home Grown and the Starting Line. On July 21, 2002, Inspection 12 guitarist Peter Mosely joined Yellowcard as their bassist. In October and November 2002, the band supported No Use for a Name on their headlining US tour, and played a few shows with the Starting Line and Park. In February 2003, Yellowcard played a handful of West Coast shows with Park and Stole Your Woman.

Between signing to Capitol and recording, Yellowcard spent a period of time writing new material in several studios. They spent around four months writing material, before going into pre-production. The band had one song, &quot;Boxing Me&quot;, that their A&amp;R person felt sounded like a single, but the members considered the track &quot;too poppy&quot; and dropped it. Sessions for &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; were held at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, California, in February and March 2003. Neal Avron produced and recorded the album with assistance from engineers Ryan Castle and Travis Huff. Harper knew of Avron through his work with Everclear, New Found Glory, and the Wallflowers. He praised Avron for helping to achieve the &quot;right kind of guitar tone, or master the violin, or help out with drum&quot; sounds. Tom Lord-Alge mixed the recordings at South Beach Studios in Miami Beach, Florida, with assistance from Femio Hernandez, before the album was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound in New York City.

==Composition and lyrics==
The sound of &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; has been described musically as pop-punk and punk rock, and has drawn comparisons to Blink-182 and Simple Plan. The album&#x27;s title refers to a street in the band&#x27;s hometown of Jacksonville, Florida, where they had they spent some of their childhood. Key typically comes up with a melody line and a chord progression, which he then shows to the rest of the band, who build upon it from this bare form. Key and drummer Longineu W. Parsons III wrote together and would often jam material. The band experimented with country and folk-stylized rock in songs like &quot;Empty Apartment&quot;, &quot;View from Heaven&quot;, and &quot;One Year, Six Months&quot;. When asked about a metal influence throughout the album, Key attributed this to Parsons, who was a metalhead. Mosely played bass on every track, except for &quot;Only One&quot;, which was done by Key. Mosely also played piano on &quot;Empty Apartment&quot; and &quot;Only One&quot;, and added vocals. Christine Choi and Rodney Wirtz played cello and viola, respectively, on &quot;Way Away&quot;, &quot;Breathing&quot;, &quot;Empty Apartment&quot;, &quot;Only One&quot;, and &quot;Believe&quot;; Mackin and Avron wrote the string arrangement.

The opening track &quot;Way Away&quot; is about a person leaving their home and finding their own way in life. Key said he had had re-written the verse music, melody and lyrics 30 minutes prior to a show. &quot;Breathing&quot; was a reaction to the end of Key&#x27;s first post-high school relationship. He had written the guitar riff to it in a dressing room at the Glass House venue in Pomona, California while on a tour. &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; is anchored around a distorted staccato punk rock guitar riff; in the song&#x27;s lyrics, Key uses the person he is singing to as a metaphor for Jacksonville. The song was inspired by Ocean Boulevard, a road in Jacksonville. Key said the sign on that road lacked the word boulevard, only being named as such on a map. As he was trying to find a rhyme for the lyrics, he used the word avenue instead. It was nearly left off the album as Key was unable to come up with a chorus that he was satisfied with, until settling on the lyric &quot;Finding out things would get better&quot;. Discussing &quot;Empty Apartment&quot;, he mentioned the various line-up changes the band had gone through, and &quot;sometimes you&#x27;re faced with a decision of: Do you quit? Do we break up and just call it? Or do we move on without this person?&quot; In &quot;Life of a Salesman&quot;, Key talks about how he will act as a father by following his own father&#x27;s example. He said his relationship with his father was strained during the making of the album, and used the song as a way to remind him of his importance.

&quot;Only One&quot; was written partway through the recording sessions, and Key said the lyrics were influenced by &quot;a weird breakup&quot;. He explained it was &quot;one of those where I felt like I had to do it, even though she didn&#x27;t do anything wrong&quot;. The music came about from Key using different amplifiers to achieve a different sound, utilizing a tremolo effect played through a Fender Twin amp. &quot;Miles Apart&quot; was written in the basement of The Nile venue in Phoenix, Arizona; Key thought the riff progression was very simplistic that he referred to it as &quot;my first guitar riff dot com&quot;. &quot;Twentythree&quot; is about growing up, while the country-influenced song &quot;View from Heaven&quot;, with additional vocals from Alieka Wijnveldt, discusses the death of a girlfriend. Key explained that it was about a friend of his who had died of juvenile diabetes at age 18. &quot;Inside Out&quot; is a mid-tempo rock track that is followed by &quot;Believe&quot;, a homage to emergency service members who died in the September 11 attacks. In the context of the latter song, Key said that early on in their career, they would attract a fanbase from the tri-state area. The penultimate track, &quot;One Year, Six Months&quot;, is an acoustic ballad; the band said they wanted something with a heavy amount of reverb as Sunset Sound had one of the earliest-built reverb chambers. The album ends with &quot;Back Home&quot;, which is about the things a person leaves behind in &quot;Way Away&quot;. Key had the clean intro and outro guitar riff for a period of time until it ended up in &quot;Back Home&quot;.

==Release==
In March 2003, Mosely left Yellowcard citing personal reasons and was replaced by Alex Lewis, who was best friends with Harper and Mackin. Following this, they went on tour with the Ataris; during the last night of the trek, Key had injured his jaw from messing around with Mackin. After seeing a doctor, Key stayed with his parents in Jacksonville and had surgery. The rest of the band went on tour with Lagwagon while Peter Munters from Over It temporarily filled in for Key. On May 4, 2003, &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; was announced for release in two months&#x27; time. Later that month, the band went on a brief tour of Japan, followed by headlining shows in California throughout June 2003. They took a week-long break before starting press and in-store in events in the lead up to the album&#x27;s release. Between mid-July and early August 2003, the group appeared on the Warped Tour, and then toured with Don&#x27;t Look Down. &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; was eventually released on July 22, 2003, through Capitol Records after it was originally scheduled to be released on July 8. The artwork features a blurry photo of a high school girl in front of a setting sun in California. The model is Brittany Nash, who was photographed by Sasha Eisenman. The album was released as an enhanced CD in some countries, which included a video entitled &quot;The Making of &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot;&quot; and a music video for &quot;The Underdog EP&quot; track &quot;Powder&quot;. The Japanese edition included &quot;Firewater&quot;, &quot;Hey Mike&quot;, and the acoustic versions of &quot;Way Away&quot; and &quot;Avondale&quot; as bonus tracks; &quot;Way Away&quot; was released on radio the same day. The CD version included &quot;Hey Mike&quot; and an acoustic version of &quot;Avondale&quot;. Key felt it was a &quot;little more tough, a little more edgy&quot; choice as the album&#x27;s first single, wanting to avoid being seen as a poppy band.

After Yellowcard finished performing on the Warped Tour in August, it went on a club tour in the US that was followed by a few radio show appearances. The music video for &quot;Way Away&quot; premiered on &quot;The O.C.&quot; on September 2, 2003. In October 2003, Yellowcard appeared at Shocktoberfest and on &quot;IMX&quot; before playing a handful of shows later that month. In November, the band went on a US tour with Less Than Jake and Fall Out Boy, and performed on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; was released to radio on December 16, 2003. They opened 2004 with a Canadian tour with Eve 6 and Jersey. On March 3, 2004, the band appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Around this time, Lewis was kicked out of the band and replaced by Mosely. In March and April 2004, the band went on a co-headlined a US tour with Something Corporate, and was supported by Steriogram and the Format. The band later toured Europe in May 2004 with Less Than Jake and the A.K.A.s. On May 18, 2004, Yellowcard appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. &quot;Way Away&quot; was released as a single in the UK on May 31, 2004.
In June 2004, &quot;Only One&quot; was released as a single; the CD version included an AOL Session version of &quot;View from Heaven&quot; and a live version of &quot;Miles Apart&quot;. The music video for &quot;Only One&quot; was directed by Phil Harder and was filmed prior to the European tour. According to Key, the video was &quot;a love story that is surrounded by a lot of chaos and confusion&quot;. After appearing at the main stage on Warped Tour, the band performed at the MTV Video Music Awards. They played a few European shows with New Found Glory before embarking on tours in Australia and Japan. &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; was released as a single in the UK on September 6, 2004; the CD version included &quot;Firewater&quot;, an acoustic version of &quot;Way Away&quot;, and the music video for &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot;. The video sees a woman steal something from Key, who then proceeds to chase her; he is in turn being chased by two villains, played by Mackin and Parsons. Around this time, &quot;Believe&quot; was released as a single to honor the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. In October and November 2004, the band went on a six-week tour of the US.

===Reissues and related releases===
In November 2004, the live/video album &quot;Beyond Ocean Avenue: Live at the Electric Factory&quot; was released. It featured footage from a show earlier in the year, as well as a documentary on the history of the band. &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; was pressed on vinyl for the first time in 2011 through Hopeless Records, individually and as part of the box set &quot;2002–2011 Collection&quot;. It was re-pressed by Hopeless Records in 2014, and by Field Day Records in 2021. In 2013, the band released an acoustic version of the album, &quot;Ocean Avenue Acoustic&quot;, in honor of the album&#x27;s tenth anniversary. The band toured the acoustic album later in 2013 and again in early 2014. &quot;Way Away&quot;, &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot;, &quot;Empty Apartment&quot;, &quot;Life of a Salesman&quot;, &quot;Only One&quot;, and &quot;Believe&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s first compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2011).

==Critical reception==

&quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics, many of which commented on the songwriting quality. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Joe Caramanica said the band laid &quot;somewhere between A Simple Plan and blink-182, which is to say they&#x27;re resilient enough not to whine, but too young to have a reason to anyhow&quot;. He added that Key &quot;wails every song without a hint of stylistic variation, subject matter be damned.&quot; Elizabeth Bromstein of &quot;Now&quot; wrote that there was &quot;a certain amount of drive&quot; to the album, which offered &quot;some neat guitar sounds as well as some nice arrangements&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Nick Madsen called the album a &quot;solid and consistent record that has made a believer out of [him]&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; contributor Stephen Haag said the album &quot;arrives at a time when pop punk&#x27;s audience is maturing beyond the typical puerile fare that too many bands offer.&quot; The staff at &quot;DIY&quot; said that the opening track could lead the listener to think of the album as &quot;just another punk rock CD.&quot; In spite of Mackin&#x27;s violin giving the band some diversity from their peers, there was &quot;still a fair share of bog standard punk rock, run of the mill stuff&quot;. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; reviewer Nick Lancaster dismissed Yellowcard as &quot;merely the latest band to hop off the boy-band-punk conveyor belt for their fifteen minutes of minor fame&quot;, though he wrote that it was &quot;[n]ever actively bad, but offensive in its lack of imagination and drive&quot;.

Reviewers were largely positive about the inclusion of Mackin&#x27;s violin skills. &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; writer Cameron Adamson was initially sceptical of the use of violin, but &quot;was pleasantly surprised&quot;; as he listened to more of the album, he noted that the &quot;energy that is felt from the start never dies&quot;. AllMusic reviewer MacKenzie Wilson wrote that the album &quot;delivers despite of its catchy recipe&quot;, with Mackin&#x27;s &quot;impressively skilled&quot; violin playing that helped Yellowcard &quot;in making something sound original and fresh&quot;. Brad Maybe of &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; noted that the band set themselves apart with Mackin&#x27;s violin; the album had &quot;giant hooks and undeniably catchy choruses&quot;, which were &quot;propelled to monstrous levels&quot; by the violin. Madsen wrote that as integral was Key&#x27;s vocals and Harper&#x27;s guitar were to the band, Mackin&#x27;s violin was &quot;more than just a gimmick and absolutely should not be written off as one&quot;. Haag said the band with their violin parts &quot;aren&#x27;t entirely the answer to what is ailing pop punk, but they&#x27;re not part of the problem either&quot;.

==Commercial performance and accolades==
&quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; peaked at number 23 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and has sold 1.8 million copies in the US. It also charted at number 8 in New Zealand, and number 149 in the UK. It reached number 52 on the year-end &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 2004. The album was certified platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), gold in Canada by Music Canada, and silver in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

&quot;Way Away&quot; charted at number 25 on Alternative Airplay. Outside of the US, it reached number 63 in the UK and number 66 in Scotland. &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; charted at number 13 on Mainstream Top 40, number 21 on Adult Top 40 and Alternative Airplay, number 37 on Hot 100, and number 38 on Radio Songs. Outside of the US, the song charted at number 34 in New Zealand, number 61 in Australia, and number 65 in Scotland and the UK. It was certified double platinum by the RIAA and silver by the BPI. &quot;Only One&quot; charted at number 15 on Alternative Airplay, number 22 on Bubbling Under Hot 100, and number 28 on Mainstream Top 40. It was certified gold in the US by the RIAA.

The music video for &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; was nominated for Best New Artist in a Video and MTV2 Award at the MTV Video Music Awards. It has appeared on various best-of pop-punk album lists, being featured on lists by A.Side TV, BuzzFeed, &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;Loudwire&quot;, &quot;Rock Sound&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; is featured on Billboard&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Choruses of the 21st Century&quot; and Cleveland.com&#x27;s list of the top 100 pop-punk songs. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; at number 42 on their list of the best 100 singles from the 2000s. Author Leslie Simon in her book &quot;Wish You Were Here: An Essential Guide to Your Favorite Music Scenes―from Punk to Indie and Everything in Between&quot; (2009) wrote that the album not only launched Key as an &quot;unexpected emo sex symbol but proved that violins are actually more punk rock than you think&quot;.

<doc id="593535" wikidata="Q2496511" url="?curid=593535" title="UNIX System Services">
<text>z/OS UNIX System Services (z/OS UNIX, or informally USS) is a base element of z/OS. z/OS UNIX is a certified UNIX operating system implementation (XPG4 UNIX 95) optimized for mainframe architecture. It is the first UNIX 95 to not be derived from the AT&amp;T source code. Through integration with the rest of z/OS, additional Time Sharing Option (TSO) commands are available alongside the usual UNIX services, making it possible to process UNIX files using ISPF. Extensions in JCL make it possible to use these files in batch processing.

== Overview ==
UNIX System Services allows UNIX applications from other platforms to run on IBM System z mainframes running z/OS. In many cases only a recompile is necessary, although additional effort may be advisable for z/OS integration (such as SMP/E installation support). While z/OS UNIX supports ASCII and Unicode, and there&#x27;s no technical requirement to modify ASCII and Unicode UNIX applications, many z/OS users often prefer EBCDIC support in their applications including those running in z/OS UNIX. Consequently, z/OS UNIX provides application and administrator services for converting to/from EBCDIC. Programs running under z/OS UNIX have full, secure access to the other internal functions of z/OS. Database access (Db2 via Call Attach) is one example of how z/OS UNIX can access services found elsewhere in z/OS. Naturally such programs cannot be ported to non-mainframe platforms without rewriting if they use these z/OS-specific services. Conversely, if a program adheres to UNIX standards such as POSIX and ANSI C, it will be easier to move it between different UNIX operating systems including z/OS UNIX.

The file systems for z/OS UNIX (the older HFS with DFSMS/MVS Version 1 Release 2 and the now preferred zFS), which support UNIX-style long filenames, appear as datasets to the rest of z/OS. Numerous core z/OS subsystems and applications rely on UNIX System Services, including the z/OS Management Facility, XML parsing and generation services, OpenSSH, the IBM HTTP Server for z/OS, the z/OS SDK for Java, and some z/OS PKI services as examples. z/OS UNIX also provides a shell environment, OMVS.

z/OS UNIX&#x27;s predecessor was an operating system component called OpenEdition MVS, first implemented in MVS/ESA SP 4.3 and enhanced in MVS/ESA 5.1. OpenEdition MVS initially only supported the POSIX standards, but X/OPEN, the predecessor to The Open Group, certified MVS/ESA SP V5.1.

IBM continues to enhance UNIX System Services. Typically every release of z/OS includes enhancements to z/OS UNIX.

<text>Talbragar River, a perennial stream that is part of the Macquarie catchment within the Murray–Darling basin, is located in the Orana district of New South Wales, Australia.

The river rises on the western side of the Liverpool Range on south slopes of Great Dividing Range, north of Cassilis and flows generally south west, joined by fifteen tributaries, including the Coolaburragundy River, and reaching its confluence with the Macquarie River near Dubbo; descending over its course.

The river flows through the Dunedoo and is noted for its influence on flood, particularly for its capacity for rapid rise and fall, due to the wide catchment, and the effect of its flood water on Dubbo.

==European history==
The Talbragar River was first encountered by Europeans in the late 1820s when it was called the Putterbatta River. The first bridge over the Talbragar was built in the 1850s, near Dunedoo, by Thomas New.

<text>Taronga Western Plains Zoo, formerly known as (and still commonly referred to as) Western Plains Zoo and commonly known as Dubbo Zoo, is a large zoo in Dubbo, New South Wales, Australia. It opened to the public on 28 February 1977, to provide more living and breeding space for large animals such as elephants and antelopes which needed more space than was available at the restricted Sydney site. The zoo is run by the Taronga Conservation Society (formerly Zoological Parks Board of New South Wales), along with Taronga Zoo Sydney. Western Plains Zoo is located on the Newell Highway in west Dubbo about 5 km from the city.

==History==

In the late 1960s, plans to develop a large plains zoo to complement Sydney&#x27;s Taronga Zoo were established. The new zoo would provide breeding facilities particularly suited to the large plains dwelling animals and to fulfil a need for an open range facility for the display of mainly grazing animals. After considerable planning and preparation, a site on the outskirts of Dubbo in central West New South Wales was chosen. Formerly an army camp during World War Two, the site was transformed into a 300 hectare zoo of woodland and irrigated grasslands.

Western Plains Zoo opened to the public on 28 February 1977. When the zoo opened, it contained 35 different animals from six countries. The zoo is an open-range design, with walls and fences replaced by concealed moats which divide the animals from the visitors. This creates the impression of actually being with the animals in the wild. It was also the first zoo to be built in Australia in 60 years.

Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia visited the Western Plains Zoo in 1992.

In 1994 Western Plains Zoo was awarded as the Best Major Tourist Attraction, the highest honour in Australian Tourism.

On 26 September 2006, &quot;The Daily Liberal&quot; published an article announcing British comedian John Cleese was visiting the zoo &quot;in order to raise money for a new Greater One-Horned rhino exhibit&quot;.

===Name change===
The zoo changed its name to Taronga Western Plains Zoo on 21 January 2008, citing the need to draw attention to the work of the Taronga Conservation Society Australia.

===Zoo friends===
Zoo Friends was an organisation which offered support in form of volunteers and fund raising for both Taronga Zoo Sydney and Western Plains Zoo. Members were eligible to volunteer to help at the Zoo. In 2009 the organisation was disbanded and all assets donated to the Taronga Conservation Foundation. Taronga Zoo Sydney now runs its own volunteer program.

<doc id="593542" wikidata="Q4583899" url="?curid=593542" title="Caracara (subfamily)">
<text>Caracaras are birds of prey in the family Falconidae. They are traditionally placed in subfamily Polyborinae with the forest falcons, but are sometimes considered to constitute their own subfamily, Caracarinae, or classified as members of the true falcon subfamily, Falconinae. Caracaras are principally birds of South and Central America, just reaching the southern United States.

Unlike the &quot;Falco&quot; falcons in the same family, the birds in the five relevant genera are not fast-flying aerial hunters, but are comparatively slow and are often scavengers (a notable exception being the red-throated caracara).

==Species==
==Distribution==
The caracaras are found throughout much of the Americas. The range of the crested caracara extends as far north as the states of Arizona, Texas, and Florida in the United States. In the Southern Hemisphere, the striated caracara inhabits the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego, just off the coast of the southernmost tip of South America.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Caracara&quot; Merrem 1826 was previously known as &quot;Polyborus&quot; Vieillot 1816. Hence, the differing subfamily names Polyborinae or Caracarinae. In addition, different authors give differing scopes to the subfamily, sometimes including the forest falcons, laughing falcon, or spot-winged falconet.

Peters&#x27; checklist in 1931 listed the caracaras in their own subfamily, Polyborinae, containing &quot;Daptrius&quot;, &quot;Milvago&quot;, &quot;Phalcobœnus&quot;, and &quot;Polyborus&quot;. &quot;Ibycter americanus&quot; is included as &quot;Daptrius americanus&quot;.

Whilst recognizing &quot;three major, deep divisions in the Falconidae&quot;, the South American Classification Committee (SACC) of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union voted in 2007 to recognize two subfamilies: Herpetotherinae containing the forest falcons; and Falconinae containing the caracaras and true falcons.

Based on recent research in molecular genetics, John Boyd places the spot-winged falconet (&quot;Spiziapteryx&quot;) in Caracarinae, and the forest falcons in Herpetotherinae. He also comments that &quot;many of the caracaras are closely related, and it would not be unreasonable to merge &quot;Ibycter&quot;, &quot;Milvago&quot;, and &quot;Phalcoboenus&quot; into &quot;Daptrius&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="593547" wikidata="Q1064813" url="?curid=593547" title="Taronga Zoo">
<text>Taronga Zoo is a government-run public zoo located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, in the suburb of Mosman, on the shores of Sydney Harbour. The opening hours are between 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (May to August) and 9:30 am to 5:00 pm (September to April). Taronga is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;beautiful view&quot;.

It was officially opened on 7 October 1916. Taronga Zoo Sydney is managed by the Zoological Parks Board of New South Wales, under the trading name Taronga Conservation Society, along with its sister zoo, the Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo.

Divided into various zoogeographic regions, the Taronga Zoo Sydney is home to more than 5,000 animals of approximately 350 different species. It has a zoo shop, a cafe, and an information centre.

==History==


The Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales opened the first public zoo in New South Wales in 1884 at Billy Goat Swamp in Moore Park, on a site now occupied by Sydney Boys High School and Sydney Girls High School. Inspired by a 1908 visit to the Hamburg Zoo, the secretary of the zoo, Albert Sherbourne Le Souef, envisioned a new zoo based on the bar-less concept. After realising that the Moore Park site was too small, the NSW Government granted of land north of Sydney Harbour. A further were later granted in 1916, and the zoo at its current site opened to the public on 7 October 1916.

===Rustic Bridge===
The &quot;Rustic Bridge&quot; was opened in 1915 and was one of Taronga Zoo&#x27;s earliest landscape features. It was the main way in which visitors could cross the natural gully that it spans. Early photographs show it as a romantic pathway secluded by plantings. The rustic effect was created by embedding stones in the wall and like the aquarium, its design was reminiscent of Italian grottoes.

===Late 20th century===
A critical review in 1967 led to a new emphasis on scientific conservation, education and preservation. New exhibits were built starting with the Platypus and Nocturnal houses, waterfowl ponds and walkthrough Rainforest Aviary. A Veterinary Quarantine Centre was built as was an Education Centre (funded by the Department of Education). Previous attractions such as elephant rides, miniature trains, monkey circus and merry-go-round gave way to educational facilities such as Friendship Farm and Seal Theatre (these latter two exhibits completed in the late 1970s).

==== Sky Safari ====
A gondola lift (known as the Sky Safari) was installed in 1987 and updated in 2000, transporting passengers between the bottom of the park close to the ferry wharf, and to the top end of the zoo. The gondola closed on 31 January 2023 due to reaching the end of its workable life. A proposed update to create a more unforgettable and fully accessible family experience for passengers is in progress. Pending approval, the Sky Safari is scheduled to re-open in 2027-2028.

===2000 master plan and 21st century===

In 2000, TCSA commenced a 12-year $250 million master plan, the majority of which is being spent at Taronga Zoo. The first major master plan item was the Backyard to Bush precinct which opened in April 2003. Under the plan, the zoo received five Asian elephants from the Thailand Zoological Park Organisation for breeding purposes, education, long-term research and involvement of conservation programs. The plan has met opposition from environmental activists in Thailand, who blockaded the trucks hauling the elephants to Bangkok International Airport for their flight on 5 June 2006. The elephants along with other Asian rain forest specimens are housed in the Wild Asia precinct which opened in July 2005 (the elephants arriving from quarantine in November 2006) and aims to immerse visitors in an Asian rain forest environment (though later renamed Rainforest Trail as included species from tropical Africa).

A marine section, Great Southern Oceans, opened in April 2008. Recently, the redevelopment and restoration of the historic entrance opened, further adding to the masterplan. The chimpanzee exhibit also underwent expansion work and re-opened as Chimpanzee Sanctuary allowing its residents more space and also to assist making it easier for the introduction of new individuals by splitting the areas of the exhibit when necessary.

The Tiger Trek precinct opened in August 2017 allowing for multiple exhibits of critically endangered Sumatran tigers.

The zoo&#x27;s African Savannah precinct, which opened in June 2020, was constructed as a major renovation and spatial expansion of the zoos&#x27; previous giraffe and zebra yards.

In June 2024, the Taronga Zoo opened up the Amphibian &amp; Reptile Conservation Centre (ARC).

===Zoo Friends===
Zoo Friends is an annual paid membership program that provides unlimited, year round entry into Taronga and Western Plains Zoo. The membership also includes benefits such as half price parking, discounts in shops and cafes, exclusive access to events, and more.

=== Education ===
The zoo collaborates with TAFE and its Institute of Science and Learning to offer specialized training courses. These programs focus on conservation, animal care, and wildlife management, providing hands-on education to future zoo professionals. Students gain practical experience, preparing them for careers in wildlife conservation and animal husbandry.

==Notable events==
===Platypus birth===
In February 2003, it became the second zoo in Australia to breed the platypus.
===Australia&#x27;s first elephant births===
At 3.04 am on 4 July 2009, Thong Dee, an Asian elephant, gave birth to a male calf named Luk Chai. He is the first calf born in Australia. Thong Dee, and his father Gung, were two of the eight elephants imported into Australia to participate in the Australasian Conservation Breeding Program.

The baby elephant was a major tourist attraction, with thousands of visitors attending the zoo just to see him.

A second baby Asian elephant was thought to have died during labour on 8 March 2010. The calf&#x27;s 18-year-old mother Porntip was in and out of labour over the week beforehand, after a pregnancy lasting almost two years.

Zoo keepers and veterinarians were concerned about the progress of the labour, with Porntip showing unusual movements and behaviour. An ultrasound revealed that the calf was unconscious in the birth canal, and the zoo announced on 8 March 2010 that the calf was believed to be dead. On 10 March 2010 at 3:27 am, the live male calf was born. He was subsequently named Pathi Harn, a Thai expression meaning &quot;miracle&quot;. Pathi Harn&#x27;s father is Bong Su, of the Melbourne Zoo, and was artificially conceived.

In October 2012, Pathi Harn critically injured his keeper by crushing her against a pole; the keeper survived.

The zoo&#x27;s two remaining elephants, females Pak Boon and Tang Mo will leave in 2025 to live at Monarto Safari Park to be joined by two elephants from Perth Zoo there.
===Royal tour===
On 20 April 2014, Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (as they were), along with their 8-month-old son, Prince George, visited Taronga Zoo Sydney to participate in an unveiling ceremony at the bilby exhibit. The bilby was eventually renamed &quot;Bilby George&quot; in honour of the little prince who performed his first official duty. Later, William and Kate visited the zoo again without George meeting the other animals for Easter.

=== Birth of Sumatran tiger cubs ===
On 17 January 2019, Kartika, one of the zoo&#x27;s four Sumatran tigers, gave birth to three cubs, two female cubs, Mawar and Tengah Malam and one male cub Pemanah. Sumatran tigers are critically endangered, with fewer than 350 individuals alive in the wild. In total, 21 tiger cubs have been born at Taronga since 1980.
===Ongoing conservation work news===
Taronga has been involved in numerous conservation captive breeding programs for endangered and vulnerable species for more than fifty years when the zoos management changed Taronga&#x27;s trajectory away from general visitor entertainment to focus on assisting species that are threatened in their wild habitats.

For example, Taronga has been involved with the recovery program of the Regent Honeyeater for over 20 years. During that time they have bred and released over 200 of these birds into the wild, a significant contribution to their wild population. Taronga Zoo staff and volunteers have also helped with their habitat restoration by helping plant over 30000 trees in Capertee valley.

=== Pygmy Hippopotamus Calf Death ===
The zoo&#x27;s female pygmy hippopotamus Kambiri gave birth to a female calf named Amara on 22 November 2021, who died suddenly on 24 December.

===World&#x27;s only leopard seals in a zoo===
Taronga Zoo was once home to the world&#x27;s only leopard seals living in a zoo. Leopard seals are native to Antarctica but on rare occasions, will come up to Australia&#x27;s coastlines during the late winter months. From 1999 - 2014 Taronga housed three different leopard seals, Brooke, Sabine (females) and Casey (male). All three were found separately washed up on beaches sick, malnourished or injured. As leopard seals are from the Antarctic, it was recommended that these seals not be returned to the wild once rehabilitated as they could potentially transfer unknown diseases to the fragile wild population and cause damage to the Antarctic ecosystem.

These three contributed to important research conducted by the Australian Marine Mammal Research Centre (AMMRC), bettering the understanding of this typically remote and lesser understood species. AMMRC conducted important scientific studies using these three as subjects, including leopard seal whisker growth rate, echolocation inaudible to the human ear and the suction and filter feeding that leopard seals use to hunt krill in the Antarctic.

An entire new enclosure was built to house the leopard seals, located in the new Great Southern Ocean Exhibit which opened to the public in 2008. This exhibit now houses Australian sea lions, Californian sea lions and New Zealand fur seals.

Brooke was the first to be rescued. In 1999 Brooke was found on Garie Beach in the Royal National Park. She was underweight, dehydrated and suffering from shark attack injuries. She was taken to Taronga Zoo for rehabilitation, keepers and veterinarians at Taronga were able to nurse Brooke back to health. She was unable to be released after this due to concerns that she harboured unknown diseases. Brooke was very popular with staff and visitors, being the first of her kind on display in the world. In 2008 Brooke suddenly became less active and started refusing food and it was believed that she was succumbing to an unknown infection; on 23 May 2008 she succumbed to her illness and died. It is not known exactly how old Brooke was as she was not born at the zoo, but she was believed to be around 10 years old at her death.

Sabine was the second leopard seal to come into Taronga&#x27;s care, being found on Clontarf Beach in 2007, malnourished and on the brink of death with cookiecutter shark injuries. Sabine was nursed back to health by Taronga&#x27;s keepers. The exact date of Sabine&#x27;s death is unknown.

Taronga&#x27;s final leopard seal Casey was found in 2007 a week after Sabine was found. Casey was found washed ashore at Wattamolla, south of Sydney in poor health with a recent cookiecutter shark wound on his abdomen. Like the other two leopard seals, Casey was also unable to be released back to the Antarctic and was kept at Taronga as a permanent resident. Casey was nursed back to health; once the Great Southern Ocean exhibit opened in 2008 he and Sabine were moved there together, with Brooke dying months before it opened. Taronga Zoo hoped to encourage Casey and Sabine to mate, having the first leopard seal pup born in a zoo, but Casey was so young when he was found stranded that he never learnt his mating call. Taronga played the mating calls of mature male leopard seals for Casey in hopes that he would learn them, but Sabine died before he could learn them. In 2014 Casey&#x27;s health and condition began to decline. Despite Taronga marine mammal and veterinary teams&#x27; efforts to help him Casey showed no signs of recovery. On 20 February 2014 the decision was made to euthanize him.

==Exhibits and wildlife collection==

== Chimpanzee community ==

Taronga Zoo is currently home to a multi-male, multi-female troop of 21 chimpanzees of various ages.

=== Males ===

Samaki was born in November 2001 to Shiba. Samaki and his brother Shabani were known for years by keepers as the &quot;S boys&quot; when Samaki acted as a supporter for older brother Shabani during various alpha challenges against previous alpha Lubutu. Samaki has now successfully taken the alpha role for himself with support in particular from Sule. Samaki is the father of Cebele.

Shabani was born in September 1994 to Shiba. Shabani is not very tolerant of the infants in the group and will occasionally redirect aggression towards the females of the group. Shabani had attempted many times to oust previous alpha male Lubutu from his position, but his lack of popularity meant the females supported Lubutu during any conflicts, now his younger brother Samaki has taken the alpha male role.

Furahi was born in February 2003 to Kuma. He is one of two adolescent males in the troop and has a close relationship with his mother, Kuma. Furahi had offered support to his mother, particularly when his baby brother Fumo was born in 2013. Furahi enjoys displaying, like the adult males in the troop and will occasionally harass the females.

Shikamoo was born in July 2003 to Sasha. Shikamoo has a close friendship with Furahi and is often seen bonding with him. Shikamoo is protective of his brother, Sule, and is popular amongst the females of the troop, particularly Kuma and Kamili. Shikamoo is the father of Fumo.

Sule was born in April 2008 to Sasha. Sule was the youngest member of the troop for five years until the birth of Fumo. Sule had often babysitting Fumo when he was smaller. He has likely learnt this behaviour from his elder brother, Shikamoo, who used to interact with Sule in a similar way. Sule has shown advanced social skills from a young age and often acts as a peacemaker during altercations. He is popular amongst the troop and enjoys showing off to the visitors. He occasionally has tantrums and flicks his hands in the air. Sule is currently the alpha male of the troop.

Fumo was born in October 2013 to Kuma. He is the oldest of the four infants in the community. Kuma has encouraged Fumo&#x27;s development from an early age and he is advanced in his climbing skills. Fumo had recently begun using the artificial termite mound at a very early age. Fumo has created a good relationship with the youngest infant, Cebele.

Sudi was born in August 2014 to Shiba. Sudi has been kept under close protection from his mother, and has not been allowed the freedom to explore, Kuma has allowed Fumo.

Liwali was born in September 2014 to Lisa. Liwali was the youngest chimpanzee in the group for three years until Cebele was born in 2017. Liwali has developed a close bond with the other two infants, Fumo and Sudi, as they have grown up together.

Niambi was born in October 2020 to Naomi.

=== Females ===

Lisa was born at Taronga Zoo in August 1979 to Lulu and is the highest ranking female, and the most senior Chimpanzee in the community. Lisa has had five offspring including a son Lobo who was born in June 1989 and died in November 1996, a son Lubutu who was born in June 1993, a daughter Lani who was born in May 2002 and a son Liwali who was born in September 2014. Lani has since moved zoos.

Sasha was born at Taronga Zoo in June 1980 to Spitter. Sacha has had six offspring including a son Sokwe who was born in August 1989 and died in October 1989, a daughter Kike who was born in April 1991, a son Sandali who was born in February 1996, an unnamed daughter who was born and died in September 2002, a son Shikamoo was born in July 2003 and a son Sule who was born in April 2008. Kike was exported to Perth Zoo in June 1998 and Sandali was exported to Adelaide Zoo in December 2008.

Shiba was born in May 1981 to Susie and has produced five offspring: A son, Shabani, in 1994; an unnamed male who died at birth in 1999; a son, Samaki, in 2001; a daughter, Sembe, in 2008; and a son, Sudi, in 2014. Shiba is a high ranking female in the troop and is independent and tough. Her mother, Susie, died in 1995, leaving Shiba without the maternal support Lisa and Sasha had from their mothers. Today, Shiba has support in conflicts from her two adult sons, Shabani and Samaki. She did not initially accept Lubutu&#x27;s take over as alpha male in 2001 as he was only eight years old, and she likely realised his threat to her son Shabani&#x27;s chances of becoming the alpha male. Shiba is fiercely protective of her offspring and access to her newborn son, Sudi, by the troop was very restricted while he was small.

Shona was born in October 1987 and is the lowest ranking adult. Shona was sterilised during the 1990s and has never produced any offspring. Shona has a good relationship with the alpha male, Lubutu, but receive little support from the other chimpanzee, including her aunt, Shiba. Shona is a small chimpanzee and is often harassed by the males. Shona has a good relationship with Kamili.

Kuma was born in December 1991 to Ficha and has given birth to three offspring, a son Furahi who was born in February 2003, an unnamed daughter who was born and died in October 2012 and a son Fumo who was born in October 2013. Kuma, then an adolescent, had a difficult time raising her first son, Furahi, due to a lack of family support. Furahi, now fully grown, and supported Kuma in raising her second son, Fumo. Kuma has made significant advances in the hierarchy. This success is due to her large size, the support of an adult son, and her ferocity. It is not uncommon to see Kuma take on the alpha or beta male and win, especially if she is defending Furahi in conflicts.

Kamili was born in September 1995 to Koko, and has had three offspring. Her first offspring, was an unnamed daughter, born in 2005, who died in 2005. Kamili gave birth again in 2013, to an unnamed son, which died after birth. Kamili gave birth to her third offspring in 2014, which died shortly after birth due to mismothering. Kamili had been separated, along with her pregnant mother, Koko, to allow the two low ranked females to raise their young in safety during the critical first weeks, but this was unsuccessful. Koko, and Kamili are often involved with conflicts within the group and receive little support from the others. In 2004, Koko and Kamili attacked Shiba&#x27;s juvenile son, Samaki, who probably would have been killed, had Shiba not intervened. Kamili is close to Shona and the pair often spend time grooming each other.

Sembe was born in February 2008 to Shiba. Sembe has always been very close to her mother, Shiba, and had struggled to adjust to the birth of her new sibling, Sudi. Sembe was still riding on her mother&#x27;s back at the age of six but as Shiba&#x27;s pregnancy advanced, she grew less tolerant of this. Sembe often walked, one arm draped over her mother. Sembe is a feisty young female who had struggled to adjust to life within the community when her mother was fully absorbed with Sudi. Sembe lacks the social skills displayed by Sule and will have to work hard if she is to make any connections outside of her family. She remains close to her adult brothers, Shabani and Samaki and often interacts with Sule, who is two months younger. For many years, Sembe was dominant to Sule, but as they entered adolescence, the roles quickly began to reverse.

Naomi was born at Givskud zoo in Denmark. She adjusted well to her move, however is often involved in fights with members within her group.

Ceres was born at Givskud zoo in Denmark. She has had two offspring, including a daughter on 14 November 2017 named Cebele. During the time of birth, Ceres was very protective of Cebele and always made sure that she knew of her whereabouts. Cebele couldn&#x27;t get very far from her mother, who was very selective about who she played with. Cebele was often seen clinging to her mother&#x27;s stomach and cuddling with her mother and Fumo. Sadly Cebele died in July 2023 from an illness just a few weeks before Ceres would give birth again.

Safiri was born in May 2019 to Shiba.

Lemba was born to Lisa in May 2023.

Cekiri was born to Ceres in July 2023. She is currently the youngest Chimpanzee in the community.

===Notable past chimpanzees===
Lubutu was born in June 1993 to Lisa and was the long term alpha male of the chimpanzee troop at Taronga Zoo up until his sudden death from lung failure. Lubutu took on the role of alpha male at the age of nine years after the previous alpha male, Snowy (his father) died suddenly. Lubutu was tolerant of the infants in the group and was often seen playing with them. Through his fair leadership and support from the females in the troop, Lubutu attributed to his success and lengthy tenure as a leader. At one point during Lubutu&#x27;s leadership, Samaki and Shabani stood an excellent chance of taking over the alpha role. Lubutu was the father of Samaki, Furahi, Shikamoo, Sembe and Sule. He was vasectomised in 2009, as his genetics were well represented in the region. Lubutu died in December 2019. 

Spitter was born at Taronga Zoo Sydney in June 1960 to Biddy. Spitter had seven offspring including an unnamed son who was born and died in January 1972, an unnamed son who was born and died in July 1973, a daughter Speedy who was born in May 1975 and died in July 1975, a daughter Sheba who was born in June 1978 and died in September 1978, a daughter Sacha who was born in June 1980, a daughter Sally who was born in January 1985 and a son Gombe who was born in December 1988 and died in May 2001. Sally was transferred to Wellington Zoo in April 1992. Spitter died in March 2022.

Koko was born in January 1972 in the wild, and came to Taronga Zoo Sydney in February 1993. She had five offspring including an unnamed daughter who was born and died in August 1994, a daughter Kamili who was born in September 1995, an unnamed daughter who was born and died in June 1999, an unnamed daughter who was born and died in February 2003 and an unnamed son who was born and died in September 2014. Koko died in May 2019.

==Transport==

The Taronga Zoo ferry services are, for many tourists, the preferred mode of travel to the zoo, providing a 12-minute ride from the city to the zoo. Passengers disembarking at Taronga Zoo ferry wharf, located on Bradleys Head Road, can enter the zoo via its lower entrance or connect with local Keolis Downer Northern Beaches bus services to the top entrance.

Taronga Zoo Sydney also works with various other Sydney Harbour transport operators, such as Captain Cook Cruises and Yellow Water Taxis. Both of these operators offer combined tickets/packages which include tickets covering transport fares and zoo entry.

== Conservation ==
Taronga Zoo engages in a number of conservation efforts aimed at minimising human impact and ensuring ecological sustainability, working both in Australia and internationally.

=== Legacy Species ===
In 2016, the legacy commitment was launched, dedicating the next decade to the conservation of ten critical species, known as the Legacy Species. These species included five native to Australia, the Koala, Regent Honeyeater, Southern Corroboree Frog, Marine Turtles, Platypus, and Greater Bilby, as well as five that are on the brink of extinction in Sumatra; the Sumatran Rhinoceros, Sumatran Tiger, Asian Elephant, Sun Bear, and Sunda Pangolin.

=== Waste management ===
The zoo also focuses on minimising waste, diverting 84% of waste away from landfill and towards 20 different waste streams. One main focus is on single use plastics, encouraging reusable bags, water bottles, and coffee cups on site, and distributing biodegradable bags and food packaging. As part of the Seal talk and demonstration, the zoo encourages sustainable seafood choice through the MSC label.

== Incidents ==
=== 2022 lion escape ===
On the morning of 2 November 2022 at 6.40am, five African lions escaped their enclosure. Police officers were called to the zoo at around 7.00am, and no injuries were reported. The lions were returned to their enclosure with one cub tranquilized. On 1 December 2022, the ABC published CCTV footage, obtained in a Government Information Public Access request, that shows the lions escaping through a hole in a fence.

<text>Automatic Electric Company (A.E. Co.) was an American telephone equipment supplier primarily for independent telephone companies in North America, but also had a worldwide presence. With its line of automatic telephone exchanges, it was also a long-term supplier of switching equipment to the Bell System, starting in 1919.
The company was the largest manufacturing unit of the Automatic Electric Group. In 1955, the company was acquired by General Telephone and Electronics (GT&amp;E). After numerous reorganization within GTE, the company&#x27;s assets came under the umbrella of Lucent in the 1990s, and subsequently part of Nokia. 

==History==
In 1889, Almon Strowger, of Kansas City, Missouri, was inspired by the idea of manufacturing automatic telephone exchanges that would not require switchboard operators. He founded the Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company in 1891, which held the first patents for the automatic telephone exchange. In 1901, with the construction of a new company manufacturing plant at Morgan and Van Buren Streets in West Chicago, Strowger helped form the Automatic Electric Company to which he leased his patents exclusively.

Automatic switches based on the Strowger system proliferated in independent telephone companies in the 1910s and 1920s, well before the Bell System started deployment of Panel switch technology in the 1910s. In 1919, the Bell System was impacted considerably by organized operator strikes and the leadership abandoned its rejection of automatic switching equipment. As a result, Automatic Electric became a long-term supplier of step-by-step switching equipment to the Bell System for installations where the large-scale Panel system was not economical.

General Telephone and Electronics (GT&amp;E) acquired Automatic Electric through a merger with Theodore Gary &amp; Company in 1955, and continued operating the unit into the 1980s. Lenkurt, a manufacturer of carrier equipment, was purchased by GT&amp;E in 1959, and held separately from Automatic Electric.

In 1983, GTE merged Automatic Electric and Lenkurt into GTE Network Systems, which was quickly renamed GTE Communication Systems when AT&amp;T announced the renaming of Western Electric as AT&amp;T Network Systems. GTE Microcircuits, the microelectronics division of GTE Communication Systems known for its G65SC12 CMOS version of the then popular 6502 microprocessor, was sold to California Micro Devices in 1987. In 1989, the remaining assets of the company were placed into a joint venture between AT&amp;T and GTE called AG Communication Systems (the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;G&quot; respectively standing for the partners&#x27; names). At the same time, GTE Communications systems spun off their interconnect business to a joint venture called Fujitsu GTE, later to be renamed as Fujitsu Business Communication Systems, Inc. AG Communication Systems ceased separate existence in 2004, and became fully incorporated into Lucent, subsequently Alcatel-Lucent and then Nokia. Alcatel-Lucent also owned many of the assets of the Western Electric Company, Automatic Electric&#x27;s former rival and Bell System counterpart.

==Facilities==
With the corporate establishment of the Automatic Electric Company in 1901, the facilities of the Automatic Electric Company were located in a six-story complex erected at the intersection of Morgan Street and Van Buren Street in the western part of Chicago.

In 1957, Automatic Electric was relocated to Northlake, Illinois, and maintained research and development facilities in Melrose Park and Elmhurst, Illinois. The company acquired a manufacturing facility in Genoa, Illinois, from Leich Electric, and, in 1978, opened a research and development branch in Phoenix, Arizona. In the mid-1960s, a manufacturing plant was built in Huntsville, Alabama. Public coin-operated telephones and the &quot;Styleline&quot; series of consumer telephones were manufactured there. A smaller rental telephone refurbishment operation was also moved to the Huntsville plant in the 1970s. The plant was closed in the mid-1980s as domestic labour and production costs rose sharply against overseas competitors.

In Canada, Automatic Electric acquired Phillips Electric Works, a cable factory in Brockville, Ontario, in 1930. Telephones were manufactured at that facility from 1935 to 1953, when Automatic Electric sold the cable plant and built a 33-acre, $1.5 million telephone factory at 100 Strowger Boulevard. The Strowger Boulevard factory was sold to BC Tel (as Microtel) in 1979, then was owned by Nortel (as Brock Telecom) from 1990 to 1999; it closed in 2002. The Phillips Cables factory closed in the 1990s and was later demolished.

 In England, the Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Company Ltd. operated a manufacturing plant in Liverpool. British Insulated Cables had founded the company in November 1911 to manufacture the Strowger system under licence from the Automatic Electric Company of Chicago. The first maker of automatic exchanges in the UK, this company (as of 1923) was one of four (later five) which manufactured equipment for Post Office-owned central offices; see General Post Office (GPO or BPO, a government department).. The company became part of International Automatic Telephone Co. in 1920, which changed name to Automatic Electric Co. in 1932 and then to Automatic Telephone and Electric Co. in 1936 to reflect a product range which included sidelines ranging from Xcel heating appliances to traffic signals.

In the 1950s, two Automatic Electric factories were manufacturing in Europe: Automatique Electric SA of Antwerp, Belgium, and Autelco Mediterranea SATAP of Milan, Italy.

==Products==
As its principal product line, Automatic Electric manufactured automatic stepping switches (specifically, &quot;Strowger switches&quot;) which had enabled Strowger&#x27;s vision. These switches allowed customers to connect their own calls without operator assistance.

Automatic Electric&#x27;s rotary dial makes a single clicking sound as it is released but is otherwise fairly silent, while Western Electric&#x27;s rotary dial has a distinctive whirring sound as the dial returns to the normal position. Many Automatic Electric telephones use a distinctive dual-gong ringer, the low and high tones of which are a perfect fifth apart, in contrast to the typical third interval of most Western Electric ringers.

The GTD-5 EAX, GTE Automatic Electric&#x27;s digital class 4/5 central office telephone switch, was first deployed on June 26, 1982.

<doc id="593566" wikidata="Q256345" url="?curid=593566" title="Hanna Ljungberg">
<text>Hanna Carolina Ljungberg (born 8 January 1979) is a Swedish former association football forward. She spent the majority of her club career at Umeå IK and was a Swedish international from 1996 to 2008.

==Club career==
From 1998 to 2009, Ljungberg made 227 appearances and scored 196 goals for Umeå IK in the Damallsvenskan, winning the Diamond Ball (Diamantbollen) in 2002. She also scored a record-setting number of goals that season with 39 goals (roughly 1.78 per game). In the 70th minute of a cup match against AIK on 17 May 2007, Carola Söberg&#x27;s injury forced Ljungberg to play in goal. Fortunately, Umeå IK held on to their clean sheet.

==International career==
Ljungberg debuted for Sweden on 6 February 1996 in an 8-0 win over Spain at age 17. As a highly prolific striker, she was instrumental in the Swedish side that were runners-up at the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup held in the United States, scoring three goals and assisting one more. She was also voted as the third-best World Player of the Year by FIFA in 2003. Until October 2014, when she was surpassed by Lotta Schelin, Ljungberg was the goal leader of the Swedish national team with 72 goals. During the UEFA Women&#x27;s Cup 2002-03, Ljungberg was the top goalscorer in the tournament with 10 goals. Italian men&#x27;s football club Perugia contacted Ljungberg to hire her for their Serie A roster, but the deal was aborted.

==Retirement==
In August 2009, Ljungberg announced her retirement after a knee injury in a league match on 5 July. Her right anterior cruciate ligament, previously reconstructed in 2004, was again partly torn and she decided with her doctors that to continue to play presented too high a risk of permanent disability. Later on, she helped Joakim Blomqvist and his assistant Maria Bergkvist in the coaching of her old team. At the same time, Ljungberg was studying at Umeå University to become a physiotherapist and graduated in June 2012.

==Personal life==
Ljungberg is not related to Freddie Ljungberg. She appeared in the Sveriges Television documentary television series The Other Sport from 2013 and was also depicted on a stamp commemorating the Swedish Football Association&#x27;s 100th anniversary.

==Matches and goals scored at major tournaments==
Ljungberg featured for Sweden at three World Cups (USA 1999, USA 2003, China 2007) and three Olympic Games (Athens 1996, Sydney 2000, Athens 2004.) She scored Sweden&#x27;s lone goal in the 2003 World Cup Final, where Sweden lost to Germany for a second place finish.

==Matches and goals scored at European Championship tournaments==
Hanna Ljungberg appeared at three European Championship tournaments: Norway/Sweden 1997, Germany 2001, and England 2005. In the 2005 Semi-Final, she scored twice against Norway, erasing Norwegian leads each time. Her second goal in the 89th minute knotted the score at 2-2 and forced extra time. Sweden could not find a match winner though, and exited the tournament in a 2-3 defeat.

<text>Damon Kyle Wayans Sr. (; born September 4, 1960) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, producer, and writer. A member of the Wayans family of entertainers, Damon performed as a comedian and actor throughout the 1980s, including a brief stint on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; He later joined his family on Fox&#x27;s sketch comedy show &quot;In Living Color&quot; (1990–1992), and wrote and performed on his own animated series &quot;Waynehead&quot; (1996–1997) and live-action series &quot;Damon&quot; (1998). Since then, he has starred in a number of films and television shows, some of which he has co-produced or co-written, including &quot;Mo&#x27; Money&quot;, &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot;, &quot;Major Payne&quot;, &quot;Bulletproof&quot;, and the sitcoms &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot; and &quot;Poppa&#x27;s House&quot;, the latter featuring his son Damon Wayans Jr. From 2016 to 2019, he starred as Roger Murtaugh in the Fox television series &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;.

== Early life ==
Wayans was born in Harlem in New York City, the son of Elvira Alethia (Green), a homemaker, singer and social worker, and Howell Stouten Wayans, a supermarket manager. He has five sisters—Elvira, Vonnie, Nadia, Kim and Diedra—and four brothers—Keenen, Marlon, Shawn and Dwayne. He was club footed as a child.

This attribute would also be given to his character in &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot;, and his character on the short-lived cartoon series &quot;Waynehead&quot;. Wayans attended Murry Bergtraum High School.

== Career ==
Wayans started doing stand-up comedy in 1982. His earliest film appearance was a brief cameo as an effeminate hotel employee in the Eddie Murphy film of 1984, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;. From 1985 to 1986, he appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a featured player, before getting fired after just eleven episodes for improvising during a live sketch, playing his character as a flamboyant gay cop instead of a straight cop. Wayans later claimed that he wanted to be fired due to lack of creative freedom and screen time. Wayans further explained that Lorne Michaels did not want Wayans to do too much too soon and began drawing comparisons to Eddie Murphy who had just left the show. He also appeared in the syndicated television series &quot;Solid Gold&quot; during the 1980s as a comedian.

With his brother Keenen, Wayans created the Fox sketch comedy series &quot;In Living Color&quot;, which had a mostly African-American cast. The show went on the air in April 1990. It continued running until May 1994, although Wayans left the show in 1992 to pursue a film career.

After &quot;In Living Color&quot;, he starred in films such as &quot;Mo&#x27; Money&quot;, &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot;, &quot;Major Payne&quot;, &quot;Celtic Pride&quot;, &quot;Bulletproof&quot;, and &quot;The Great White Hype&quot;, and wrote and starred in the film &quot;Blankman&quot;. He also appeared in Janet Jackson&#x27;s video &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot; and was considered for the role of the Riddler in &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (the role went to Jim Carrey, his co-star from &quot;In Living Color&quot; and &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;).

In October 1996, he produced &quot;Waynehead&quot;, a short-lived cartoon for The WB, loosely based on his own childhood growing up in a large family, starring a poor boy with a club foot. The show only lasted a season due to poor ratings. From 1997 to 1998, he was the executive producer of &quot;413 Hope St.&quot;, a short-lived drama on the FOX network starring Richard Roundtree and Jesse L. Martin.

In March 1998, he starred in the short-lived comedy television series &quot;Damon&quot;, in which he played a detective from Chicago. It aired on Fox. In 1999, his &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestselling book &quot;Bootleg&quot;, with co author David Asbery was published; it is a humorous compilation of his observations about family.

In October 2000, he was the lead in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Bamboozled&quot;. Wayans starred in the ABC comedy series &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot; from March 2001 to May 2005. He also was a co-creator of the short lived ABC sitcom &quot;Rodney&quot; starring &quot;Rodney Carrington&quot; and &quot;Jennifer Aspen&quot; that ran from 2004–2006. In the end of 2006, he produced and starred in the Showtime sketch comedy series &quot;The Underground&quot;, which also featured his son, Damon Jr. He also hosted the June 2006 BET Awards.

In 2011, he also added author of a serious fictional novel to his credits with &quot;Red Hats&quot;, which is the story of a suicidal 65-year-old woman who finds friendship and happiness, when she joins the Red Hat Society. , Wayans continues to perform stand-up comedy and has developed apps with his company of freelancers &quot;MIMS&quot; (Money in My Sleep). The company created applications such as Flick Dat, Diddeo and VHedz.

On November 12, 2015, at the Irvine Improv, Wayans announced his retirement from stand up commencing December 2015. In September 2016, he was cast as Roger Murtaugh in the television version of &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, a role originated by Danny Glover in the film series. On October 3, 2018, it was reported that Wayans would leave &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; after filming of the first thirteen episodes of Season 3 wrapped. &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; officially ended in February 2019, after three seasons.

Wayans returned to scripted television in the fall of 2024 with his son Damon Jr. on the CBS sitcom &quot;Poppa&#x27;s House&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==
Wayans received four Emmy awards nominations for his acting and writing in &quot;In Living Color&quot;.

For his role in &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot;, he won the 2002 People&#x27;s Choice Awards for Favorite Male Performer in a New TV Series, and received four International Press Academy &quot;Golden Satellite Award&quot; nominations.

== Personal life ==
Wayans was married to Lisa Thorner; they divorced in 2000. He has four children with Thorner: sons Damon Wayans Jr. and Michael Wayans and daughters Cara Mia Wayans and Kyla Wayans. He is also a grandfather. He is the uncle of Damien Dante Wayans, Chaunté Wayans and Craig Wayans.

Wayans was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in January 2013.

In September 2015, Wayans defended comedian Bill Cosby following sexual assault accusations against him, saying &quot;It&#x27;s a money hustle... Forty years – listen, how big is his penis that it gives you amnesia for 40 years? If you listen to them talk, they go, &#x27;Well, the first time...&#x27; The first time? Bitch, how many times did it happen? Just listen to what they&#x27;re saying and some of them really is unrape-able. I look at them and go, &#x27;You don&#x27;t want that. Get outta here.

<text>Teal&#x27;c of Chulak is a fictional character in the 1997 military science fiction television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. Portrayed by Christopher Judge, Teal&#x27;c is a Jaffa warrior from the planet Chulak. As a Jaffa, Teal&#x27;c is a genetically modified human with an abdominal pouch that serves as an incubator for a larval Goa&#x27;uld. The larval symbiote grants enhanced strength, health, healing, and longevity; Teal&#x27;c is around 100 years old during the show&#x27;s run and ages an additional 50 years in the final &quot;SG-1&quot; episode. Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s most notable feature is a golden tattoo found on his forehead, a sign that he once served the System Lord Apophis as First Prime, the most senior Jaffa rank.

Teal&#x27;c is introduced in the pilot episode of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;Children of the Gods&quot;. The character appears in all episodes of &quot;SG-1&quot; except season 8&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;, making him the character with the most episode appearances. Teal&#x27;c also appears in the direct-to-DVD films &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as the &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; season 4 episodes &quot;Reunion&quot; and &quot;Midway&quot;. In 2002, Christopher Judge was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category &quot;Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series&quot;.

==Role in &quot;Stargate&quot;==
===Character arc===
Teal&#x27;c is a Jaffa from the planet Chulak. In the decades before the events of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, the Goa&#x27;uld System Lord Cronus executed Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s father (Cronus&#x27; First Prime, the most senior Jaffa rank) for retreating during a battle that could not be won. In the hopes of avenging his father&#x27;s death one day, Teal&#x27;c joined the armies of the rival System Lord Apophis. Under the direction of Apophis&#x27; then-First Prime, Bra&#x27;tac, Teal&#x27;c learned the ways of a warrior and rose in the ranks to become Apophis&#x27;s new First Prime. His interaction with Bra&#x27;tac and his own personal experiences eventually led Teal&#x27;c to doubt the divinity of the Goa&#x27;uld.

When the SG-1 team is captured on Chulak in the pilot episode of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, Teal&#x27;c defects from Apophis and joins the SG-1 team. He believes this will provide an opportunity eventually to defeat the Goa&#x27;uld and bring freedom to all Jaffa. Teal&#x27;c finds a home at Stargate Command (SGC) on Earth and occasionally visits his wife Drey&#x27;auc and his young son Rya&#x27;c on Chulak &quot;(see section Relationships)&quot;. SG-1 joins forces with Bra&#x27;tac in many missions against Apophis in the next four seasons. Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s integrity in the team is tested after he kills Daniel&#x27;s wife Sha&#x27;re in season 3&#x27;s &quot;Forever in a Day&quot; to stop her torturing Daniel. After SG-1 succeeds in killing Apophis in the season 5 premiere, &quot;Enemies&quot;, Chulak becomes a free planet.

The first major group of Jaffa Resistance warriors is shown in season 5&#x27;s &quot;The Warrior&quot;. By season six, Teal&#x27;c and Bra&#x27;tac have become prominent leaders of the Jaffa Resistance. Earth&#x27;s Alpha site serves as a main site of operation for the Rebel Jaffa and later the Tok&#x27;ra, but the two races have difficulty with trust and collaboration in defeating the Goa&#x27;uld as their enemy. Teal&#x27;c and Bra&#x27;tac lose their symbiotes after a sabotaged Rebel Jaffa summit in season 6&#x27;s &quot;The Changeling&quot;, but the Tok&#x27;ra drug Tretonin sustains them from then on. Tretonin eventually becomes instrumental in liberating Jaffa from physiological reliance on Goa&#x27;uld symbiotes. No longer presenting a security risk to Earth, Teal&#x27;c attempts to have a normal life and moves out of the SGC in season 8&#x27;s &quot;Affinity&quot;. However, Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s alien behavior and a murder case make life difficult for him.

Teal&#x27;c and Bra&#x27;tac eventually lead the Jaffa to victory over the Goa&#x27;uld in season 8&#x27;s &quot;Reckoning&quot;/&quot;Threads&quot;. The Goa&#x27;uld have long weakened one another by continuous civil war amongst the System Lords, and the Jaffa see the Goa&#x27;uld&#x27;s inability to save themselves from the Replicators as proof that they are false Gods. The new Jaffa Nation immediately becomes a major power, inheriting part of the fleets of the System Lords. Teal&#x27;c and Bra&#x27;tac are knighted Bloodkin to all Jaffa, the highest honour that can be bestowed on any Jaffa. The planet Dakara serves as the nation&#x27;s new capital, and Chulak becomes a major stronghold for the Free Jaffa Nation in season 9.

Teal&#x27;c is chosen as a member of the new Jaffa High Council, but the nation is divided between the opposition progressives (including Teal&#x27;c and Bra&#x27;tac) with a vision of a representative democracy, and the ruling traditionalists who support the military oligarchy. Many of the councilors are the former leaders of the Jaffa Resistance, and initially resist the Ori religion after having worshiped false gods for too long. After the death of the traditionalist leader Gerak in season 9&#x27;s &quot;The Fourth Horseman&quot;, Teal&#x27;c supports Bra&#x27;tac as an interim leader before the nation adopts a constitution based on Earth representative democracies in &quot;Stronghold&quot;. After the events of season 9&#x27;s &quot;Camelot&quot;, the Ori take control of Chulak. The Jaffa suffer greatly against the Ori forces, and Dakara is completely destroyed. The last Jaffa episode is season 10&#x27;s &quot;Talion&quot;, in which Teal&#x27;c kills the Jaffa leader of an Ori-devout group named Arkad. The fate of the Jaffa Nation and Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s standing among the Jaffa remain unresolved at the end of the series. In the series finale, &quot;Unending&quot;, Teal&#x27;c spends fifty years frozen in time on the &quot;Odyssey&quot; with the rest of SG-1 when Carter triggers a time dilation device to prevent them being destroyed by an Ori battlecruiser, but when she finds a way to escape and save the &quot;Odyssey&quot; that requires one person to go back to the moment before time froze, Teal&#x27;c volunteers as his Jaffa nature meant that aging fifty years wouldn&#x27;t be as significant to him as it would be to his human colleagues. As a result, Teal&#x27;c is the only one who remembers what took place during the time dilation device, but he vowed to never share that information with others, and apart from having gained a white streak in his hair his physical potential remains relatively unaffected.

Teal&#x27;c appears in the direct-to-DVD films &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He also appears in two episodes of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, set before the events of &quot;Continuum&quot;. In &quot;Reunion&quot;, he wishes Colonel Carter farewell before she leaves to become the new leader of Atlantis. In &quot;Midway&quot;, he comes to Atlantis at Carter&#x27;s request to teach Satedan warrior Ronon Dex how to deal with IOA interviews. While there, they develop a friendly rivalry, culminating in an hour-long sparring match which ended in a draw. When the Wraith leave the Pegasus galaxy and set foot at the SGC, Teal&#x27;c and Ronon work together to stop the enemy.

===Characterization===
Teal&#x27;c is a Jaffa from the planet Chulak, a planet orbiting a binary star system. Jaffa have a human appearance but have an abdominal pouch which serves as an incubator for a larval Goa&#x27;uld. The larval symbiote grants enhanced strength, health, healing, and longevity. Teal&#x27;c states he is 101 years old in season 4&#x27;s &quot;The Light&quot;, and ages an additional 50 years in season 10&#x27;s &quot;Unending&quot;. But since the symbiote also replaces the Jaffa&#x27;s immune system, its removal is known to cause a long and painful death. As a Jaffa, Teal&#x27;c does not require sleep, but must engage in a form of meditation called &quot;kel&#x27;no&#x27;reem&quot; in order to synchronize with his symbiote. However, he later had his symbiote removed and survived on a drug called tretonin. After this, he was weaker, could not perform kel&#x27;no&#x27;reem and needed sleep.

Teal&#x27;c is a &quot;stalwart alien with the unfathomable – and mostly silent – demeanor&quot; and &quot;the most straight-faced member of SG-1&quot;. Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s catchphrase is &quot;Indeed&quot;. Christopher Judge described Teal&#x27;c as a liberator who tries to end his people&#x27;s enslavement. Although Teal&#x27;c has certain advanced physical abilities and powers, he is very much human in his heart and in his mind. Judge also described Teal&#x27;c as a &quot;rebel in a society that doesn&#x27;t tolerate rebels&quot;. Teal&#x27;c is all about honor. By season 7, Teal&#x27;c has become more vocal about expressing his feelings towards situations and other characters. Teal&#x27;c became more accustomed to life on Earth, developed a taste for doughnuts and has gone on fishing trips with O&#x27;Neill, though he is puzzled as to why O&#x27;Neill fishes in a lake known to be devoid of fish. His favorite movie is Star Wars; he has seen it 9 times as of the season 5 episode Ascension. He once stated a dislike for &quot;bovine lactose&quot;, which may be due to an earlier episode (&quot;Unnatural Selection&quot;), in which Teal&#x27;c is seen gorging himself on ice cream and even stealing O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s pint of ice cream from his hand when the Asgard beamed the refrigerated stores onto the Prometheus, implying that Teal&#x27;c may be lactose intolerant. In season 8, Judge wanted to take Teal&#x27;c one step closer to being more aware of Earth customs with a more Earth-like behavior, without him losing his alien perspective. He considered the first half of season 8 &quot;the most my character has been given to do since we first started work on the series&quot;.

===Relationships===
At the beginning of the series, Teal&#x27;c is married to Drey&#x27;auc and has a son, Rya&#x27;c. When Teal&#x27;c defects to Earth, he leaves them behind on his homeworld, Chulak. Teal&#x27;c briefly reunites with his family in season 1&#x27;s &quot;Bloodlines&quot; and season 2&#x27;s &quot;Family&quot; to prevent Goa&#x27;uld influence on their life. Drey&#x27;auc marries Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s childhood friend, Frotak, but Rya&#x27;c and Drey&#x27;auc leave Chulak to live in the Land of Light (from season 1&#x27;s &quot;The Broca Divide&quot;) soon after Frotak&#x27;s death in &quot;Family&quot;. Teal&#x27;c rekindles his feelings with a Tuk&#x27;ac temple priestess named Shau&#x27;nac in season 4&#x27;s &quot;Crossroads&quot;, but she is murdered soon thereafter. Drey&#x27;auc dies in a rebel Jaffa camp in season 6&#x27;s &quot;Redemption&quot; after refusing a new larval symbiote. Teal&#x27;c begins a relationship with the Hak&#x27;tyl leader Ishta in season 7&#x27;s &quot;Birthright&quot;. He continues this relationship until at least season 8&#x27;s &quot;Sacrifices&quot;, where Rya&#x27;c also marries Kar&#x27;yn, a student of Ishta. Teal&#x27;c would also have a brief relationship with his neighbor, Krista.

O&#x27;Neill is suspicious of aliens in general except of Teal&#x27;c. At the beginning of the series, Hammond does not accept Teal&#x27;c but comes to trust and respect him after realizing Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s devotion to the Stargate Program. General Landry also respects Teal&#x27;c as a warrior.

The writers at first wanted to establish animosity between Teal&#x27;c and Daniel, particularly since Teal&#x27;c is indirectly responsible for the abduction of Daniel&#x27;s wife Sha&#x27;re, who was subsequent selected as a host for the Goa&#x27;uld Amaunet by Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s then-master Apophis. &quot;Forever in a Day&quot; almost tries to flesh out this animosity. Judge and Michael Shanks, in real life best friends, protested, as they thought that Daniel would be fascinated by Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s background, and Teal&#x27;c would be quite respectful to humans who have similar nobility despite behaving in a different manner. The producers eventually allowed the actors to show how much their characters care about and respect each other, although the characters may not get on with one another.

For most of the run of &quot;SG-1&quot;, Teal&#x27;c is the only SG-1 member who is not from Earth. With the introduction of the human alien Jonas Quinn in season 6, the writers developed a relationship between the two aliens of the team &quot;without making it seem exclusionary&quot;, and Teal&#x27;c is no longer the &quot;Other&quot; of the show. Teal&#x27;c and Jonas end up bonding because they have similar backgrounds. Christopher Judge explained that his character&#x27;s amusement with Vala in seasons 9 and 10 contributed to Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s loosening up.

When Cameron Mitchell is introduced in season 9, Teal&#x27;c first reacts taken aback to Mitchell&#x27;s enthusiasm, being more used to O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s reserved attitude. Teal&#x27;c is unsure if he likes Mitchell at first, but Mitchell forces Teal&#x27;c to interact with him. By not letting Teal&#x27;c step back and observe, Mitchell makes Teal&#x27;c an active part of the scene. Teal&#x27;c and Mitchell are both warriors and leaders, but as Teal&#x27;c was established as a powerful warrior, the producers eventually established that Mitchell gets beat up all the time in fights.

==Conceptual history==
Christopher Judge had worked with Richard Dean Anderson before. Judge starred in a fifth season episode of &quot;MacGyver&quot; in 1990, where he played a high school student whom MacGyver tries to mentor and motivate despite negative influences.

When the producers conceptualized Teal&#x27;c, they were unsure what they wanted, but had not met anyone who was definitely Teal&#x27;c for them. They were looking for African-American actors, and Judge was one of the last actors to read for the role. Judge was hired because the producers liked what he brought into the audition. They were receptive to Judge&#x27;s input and gave him the freedom to change his lines from the beginning. Judge sat down with the producers at the beginning of each season and discussed what Teal&#x27;c should go through and what would slowly make him more human.

During the first season, Teal&#x27;c seemed less well-integrated into the team than for instance O&#x27;Neill and Daniel. He was the only character who did not benefit as much from the more personal stories in season 3 and seemed to stagnate. Rumors began to surface at the end of season 3 that Judge would leave the show, but they were quickly and firmly denied. The last episodes of season 3 featured Teal&#x27;c in a more prominent role, and he benefited from additional screen time and storylines in season 4.

Judge received his first story credit for the season 5 episode &quot;The Warrior&quot;, and later wrote &quot;The Changeling&quot; on his own, focusing on Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s self-identity. He later penned the season 7 episode &quot;Birthright&quot; and the season 8 episode &quot;Sacrifices&quot;, both dealing with the Jaffa Hak&#x27;tyl faction and Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s new love interest Ishta.

===Make-up and hair===
Since Teal&#x27;c wears a lot of make-up, Judge had to be on-set much earlier than the rest of the cast. The producers&#x27; original idea for Teal&#x27;c included long ears and a specific beard piece, but the make-up department got it down to just a forehead symbol, an Egyptian look, and the character&#x27;s gold skin tone. The make-up was reflective of the Goa&#x27;uld Ra from the &quot;Stargate&quot; feature film. In the beginning of &quot;SG-1&quot;, Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s forehead symbol consisted of three parts, and it took about an hour to apply the parts to Judge&#x27;s forehead. The process was simplified over the years. The season 6 episodes &quot;The Changeling&quot; shows Teal&#x27;c experiencing an extended hallucination of being a human on Earth. For the filming of this episode, the eye make-up and the gold paint on the character was significantly toned down. With the beginning of season 7, when Teal&#x27;c no longer had a Goa&#x27;uld symbiote in his pouch, the gold make-up was dropped.

Playing a bald-shaven head Teal&#x27;c for the first seven seasons, Judge usually let his hair grow during the show&#x27;s hiatus, and shaved his head the morning of his first day back at work. For the season four premiere &quot;Small Victories&quot;, he returned to the set with a small blond chin beard after the hiatus, as the producers had not allowed his character to have scalp hair at the time. Several episodes later, Judge shaved off the beard after acknowledging how it looked. With the beginning of season 8, after &quot;many years of begging, pleading and politicking&quot;, Judge approached the producers again and asked for his character to have hair, and they gave in. Brad Wright was convinced that the audience would hate it. Judge showed the cornrows hairstyle that he thought Teal&#x27;c would have, at a convention, but the hair was cut short before the shooting of season 8 began. The story reasons for Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s hair are never explained in the series, even despite Jack O&#x27;Neill making such an inquiry in &quot;New Order&quot;, as he says, &quot;What&#x27;s with the hair?&quot;.

==Reception==

In 2002, Christopher Judge was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category &quot;Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series&quot;.

<text>Sonata da chiesa (Italian: &quot;church sonata&quot;) is a 17th-century genre of musical composition for one or more melody instruments and is regarded an antecedent of later forms of 18th century instrumental music. It generally comprises four movements, typically a largo prelude followed by a fugal allegro, an expressive slow movement, and an allegro finale, although there are also many variations of this pattern.

During the 17th century, church services were increasingly accompanied by music for ensembles rather than solo organ, with canzonas and sonatas regularly substituted for the Proper during Mass and Vespers. Many of these works, however, were not written explicitly as liturgical music and were often performed as concert pieces for entertainment. The term &quot;sonata da chiesa&quot; was originally used in its literal meaning of &quot;church music&quot;, but later came to be used figuratively to contrast this genre of composition with the &quot;sonata da camera&quot;, which literally meant &quot;chamber music&quot;, but generally comprised a suite of dances.

The exemplary works in this form are by Arcangelo Corelli, whose Op. 1 (1681) and Op. 3 (1689) each consist of 12 trio sonatas with alternating slow-fast-slow-fast movements (the first 8 of the &quot;Twelve concerti grossi&quot;, Op. 6, follow this pattern as well). This four movement scheme is followed in J. S. Bach&#x27;s three sonatas for unaccompanied violin, in the first five of his six sonatas for violin and obbligato harpsichord and in the first two of his three sonatas for viola da gamba and obbligato harpsichord.

By the mid-18th century, however, this style of music was increasingly out of date, although Joseph Haydn, for example, did compose a few early symphonies that followed the largo–allegro–minuet–allegro pattern.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart also composed 17 works that are called &quot;church sonatas&quot;, but these consisted of but a single movement for organ and strings to be played between the Epistle and the Gospel of the Mass.

<doc id="593578" wikidata="Q4517325" url="?curid=593578" title="What Is Art?">
<text>What Is Art? ( &quot;Chto takoye iskusstvo?&quot;) is a book by Leo Tolstoy. It was completed in Russian in 1897 but first published in English in 1898 due to difficulties with the Russian censors.

Tolstoy cites the time, effort, public funds, and public respect spent on art and artists as well as the imprecision of general opinions on art as reason for writing the book. In his words, &quot;it is difficult to say what is meant by art, and especially what is good, useful art, art for the sake of which we might condone such sacrifices as are being offered at its shrine&quot;.

Throughout the book Tolstoy demonstrates an &quot;unremitting moralism&quot;, evaluating artworks in light of his radical Christian ethics, and displaying a willingness to dismiss accepted masters, including Wagner, Shakespeare, and Dante, as well as the bulk of his own writings.

Having rejected the use of beauty in definitions of art (see aesthetics), Tolstoy conceptualises art as anything that communicates emotion: &quot;Art begins when a man, with the purpose of communicating to other people a feeling he once experienced, calls it up again within himself and expresses it by certain external signs&quot;.

This view of art is inclusive: &quot;jokes&quot;, &quot;home decoration&quot;, and &quot;church services&quot; may all be considered art as long as they convey feeling. It is also amoral: &quot;[f]eelings... very bad and very good, if only they infect the reader... constitute the subject of art&quot;.

Tolstoy also notes that the &quot;sincerity&quot; of the artist – that is, the extent to which the artist &quot;experiences the feeling he conveys&quot; – influences the infection.

== Evaluating the content of art ==

While Tolstoy&#x27;s basic conception of art is broad and amoral, his idea of &quot;good&quot; art is strict and moralistic, based on what he sees as the function of art in the development of humanity:

just as in the evolution of knowledge – that is, the forcing out and supplanting of mistaken and unnecessary knowledge by truer and more necessary knowledge – so the evolution of feelings takes place by means of art, replacing lower feelings, less kind and less needed for the good of humanity, by kinder feelings, more needed for that good. This is the purpose of art.

== Christian art ==
Tolstoy&#x27;s analysis is influenced by his radical Christian views (see &quot;The Kingdom of God is Within You&quot;), views which led him to be excommunicated from the Russian Orthodox Church in 1901. He states that Christian art, rooted in &quot;the consciousness of sonship to God and the brotherhood of men&quot;:
can evoke reverence for each man&#x27;s dignity, for every animal’s life, it can evoke the shame of luxury, of violence, of revenge, of using for one’s pleasure objects that are a necessity for other people, it can make people sacrifice themselves to serve others freely and joyfully, without noticing it.

Ultimately, &quot;by calling up the feelings of brotherhood and love in people under imaginary conditions, religious art will accustom people to experiencing the same feelings in reality under the same conditions&quot;.

Tolstoy&#x27;s examples: Schiller&#x27;s &quot;The Robbers&quot;, Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; and &quot;The Chimes&quot;, Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The House of the Dead&quot;, George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Adam Bede&quot;, Ge&#x27;s &quot;Judgement&quot;, Liezen-Mayer&#x27;s &quot;Signing the Death Sentence&quot;, and paintings &quot;portraying the labouring man with respect and love&quot; such as those by Millet, Breton, Lhermitte, and Defregger.

==Universal art==

&quot;Universal&quot; art illustrates that people are &quot;already united in the oneness of life&#x27;s joys and sorrows&quot; by communicating &quot;feelings of the simplest, most everyday sort, accessible to all people without exception, such as the feelings of merriment, tenderness, cheerfulness, peacefulness, and so on&quot;. Tolstoy contrasts this ideal with art that is partisan in nature, whether it be by class, religion, nation, or style.

Tolstoy&#x27;s examples: he mentions, with many qualifiers, the works of Cervantes, Dickens, Moliere, Gogol, and Pushkin, comparing all of these unfavourably to the story of Joseph.
In music he commends a violin aria of Bach, the E-flat major nocturne of Chopin, and &quot;selected passages&quot; from Schubert, Haydn, Chopin, and Mozart. He also speaks briefly of genre paintings and landscapes.

== Evaluating style ==

== Obscurity versus accessibility ==

Tolstoy notes the susceptibility of his contemporaries to the &quot;charm of obscurity&quot;. Works have become laden with &quot;euphemisms, mythological and historical allusions&quot;, and general &quot;vagueness, mysteriousness, obscurity and inaccessibility to the masses&quot;. Tolstoy lambastes such works, insisting that art can and should be comprehensible to everyone. Having emphasised that art has a function in the improvement of humanity – capable of expressing man&#x27;s best sentiment – he finds it offensive that artists should be so wilfully and arrogantly abstruse.

==Artificiality==

One criticism Tolstoy levels against art is that at some point it &quot;ceased to be sincere and became artificial and cerebral&quot;, leading to the creation of millions of works of technical brilliance but few of honourable sentiment. Tolstoy outlines four common markers of bad art: these are not however considered the canon or ultimate indicators
# Borrowing
# Imitation
# Effectfulness
# Diversion

=== Borrowing ===

Involves recycling and concentrating elements from other works, typical examples of which are: &quot;maidens, warriors, shepherds, hermits, angels, devils in all forms, moonlight, thunderstorms, mountains, the sea, precipices, flowers, long hair, lions, the lamb, the dove, the nightingale&quot;.

=== Imitation ===

Imitation is highly descriptive realism, where painting becomes photography, or a scene in a book becomes a listing of facial expressions, tone of voice, the setting, and so on. Any potential communication of feeling is &quot;disrupted by the superfluity of details&quot;.

===Effectfulness===

Reliance on &quot;strikingness&quot;, often involving contrasts of &quot;horrible and tender, beautiful and ugly, loud and soft, dark and light&quot;, descriptions of lust, &quot;crescendo and complication&quot;, unexpected changes in rhythm, tempo, etc. Tolstoy contends that works marked by such techniques &quot;do not convey any feeling, but only affect the nerves&quot;.

=== Diversion ===

Diversion is &quot;an intellectual interest added to the work of art&quot;, such as the melding of documentary and fiction, as well as the writing of novels, poetry, and music &quot;in such a way that they must be puzzled out&quot;. All such works do not correspond with Tolstoy&#x27;s view of art as the infection of others with feelings previously experienced, and his exhortation that art be &quot;universal&quot; in appeal.

== The corruption of art ==

== Causes ==

=== Church Christianity and the Renaissance ===

Tolstoy approves of early Christian art for being inspired by love of Christ and man, as well as its antagonism to pleasure-seeking. He prefers this to the art born of &quot;Church Christianity&quot;, which ostensibly evades the &quot;essential theses of true Christianity&quot; (that is, that all men are born of the Father, are equals, and should strive towards mutual love). Art became pagan – worshipping religious figures – and subservient to the dictates of the Church.

The corruption of art was deepened after the Crusades, as the abuse of papal power became more obvious. The rich began to doubt, seeing contradictions between the actions of the Church and the message of Christianity. But instead of turning back to the early Christian teachings, the upper classes began to appreciate and commission art that was merely pleasing. This tendency was facilitated by the Renaissance, with the aggrandisement of ancient Greek art, philosophy, and culture which, Tolstoy alleges, is inclined to pleasure and beauty worship.

=== Aesthetic theory ===

Tolstoy perceives the roots of aesthetics in the Renaissance. Art for pleasure was validated in reference to the philosophy of the Greeks and the elevation of “beauty” as a legitimate criterion with which to separate good from bad art.

Tolstoy moves to discredit aesthetics by reviewing and reducing previous theories – including those of Baumgarten, Kant (Critique of Judgement), Hegel, Hume, and Schopenhauer – to two main “aesthetic definitions of beauty”: 
# The &quot;objective&quot; or &quot;mystical&quot; definition of beauty in which beauty is &quot;something absolutely perfect which exists outside us&quot;, whether it be associated with &quot;idea, spirit, will, God&quot;
# The &quot;subjective&quot; definition of beauty, in which &quot;beauty is a certain pleasure we experience, which does not have personal advantage as its aim&quot;. This definition tends to be more inclusive, enabling things like food and fabric to be called art
Tolstoy then argues that, despite their apparent divergence, there is little substantive difference between the two strands. This is because both schools recognise beauty only by the pleasure it gives: &quot;both notions of beauty come down to a certain sort of pleasure that we receive, meaning that we recognize as beauty that which pleases us without awakening our lust&quot;. Therefore, there is no objective definition of art in aesthetics.

Tolstoy condemns the focus on beauty/pleasure at length, calling aesthetics a discipline:

according to which the difference between good art, conveying good feelings, and bad art, conveying wicked feelings, was totally obliterated, and one of the lowest manifestations of art, art for mere pleasure – against which all teachers of mankind have warned people – came to be regarded as the highest art. And art became, not the important thing it was intended to be, but the empty amusement of idle people.

=== Professionalism ===

Tolstoy sees the developing professionalism of art as hampering the creation of good works. 
The professional artist can and must create to prosper, making for art that is insincere and most likely partisan – made to suit the whims of fashion or patrons.

Art criticism is a symptom of the obscurity of art, for &quot;[a]n artist, if he is a true artist, has in his work conveyed to others the feelings he has experienced: what is there to explain?&quot;. Criticism, moreover, tends to contribute to the veneration of &quot;authorities&quot; such as Shakespeare and Dante. By constant unfavourable comparison, the young artist is corralled into imitating the works of the greats, as all of them are said to be true art. In short, new artists imitate the classics, setting their own feelings aside, which, according to Tolstoy, is contrary to the point of art.

Art schools teach people how to imitate the method of the masters, but they cannot teach the sincerity of emotion that is the propellant of great works. In Tolstoy&#x27;s words, &quot;[n]o school can call up feelings in a man, and still less can it teach a man what is the essence of art: the manifestation of feeling in his own particular fashion&quot;.

== Consequences ==

# &quot;[T]he enormous waste of working people&#x27;s labour&quot;, with individuals spending so much time contemplating and creating bad art that they become &quot;incapable of anything that is really necessary for people&quot;
# The volume of art produced provides &quot;the amusement which turns these people&#x27;s eyes from the meaninglessness of their lives and saves them from the boredom that oppresses them&quot;, it enables them &quot;to go on living without noticing the meaninglessness and cruelty of their life&quot;
# The confusion and perversion of values. It becomes normal to worship not great religious figures but people who write incomprehensible poems
# The worship of beauty legitimises the disregarding of morality as a criterion for evaluating cultural products
# Modern art &quot;direct corrupts people&quot; by infecting them with feelings of superstition, patriotism, and sensuality

==Criticism of famous artists==

Throughout the book Tolstoy demonstrates a willingness to dismiss generally accepted masters, among them Liszt, Richard Strauss, Nietzsche, and Oscar Wilde. He also labels his own works as &quot;bad art&quot;, excepting only the short stories &quot;God Sees the Truth&quot; and &quot;Prisoner of the Caucasus&quot;.

He attempts to justify these conclusions by pointing to the ostensible chaos of previous aesthetic analysis. Theories usually involve selecting popular works and constructing principles from these examples. Volkelt, for instance, remarks that art cannot be judged on its moral content because then &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; would not be good art. Such retrospective justification cannot, he stresses, be the basis for theory, as people will tend to create subjective frameworks to justify their own tastes.

==Reception==

Jahn notes the &quot;often confusing use of categorisation&quot; and the lack of definition of the key concept of emotion. Bayley writes that &quot;the effectiveness of &quot;What is Art?&quot; lies not so much in its positive assertions as in its rejection of much that was taken for granted in the aesthetic theories of the time&quot;. Noyes criticises Tolstoy&#x27;s dismissal of beauty, but states that, &quot;despite its shortcomings&quot;, &quot;What is Art?&quot; &quot;may be pronounced the most stimulating critical work of our time&quot;. Simmons mentions the &quot;occasional brilliant passages&quot; along with the &quot;repetition, awkward language, and loose terminology&quot;. Aylmer Maude, translator of many of Tolstoy&#x27;s writings, calls it &quot;probably the most masterly of all Tolstoy&#x27;s works&quot;, citing the difficulty of the subject matter and its clarity. For a comprehensive review of the reception at the time of publication, see Maude 1901&quot;b&quot;.

<text>Galveston Bay ( ) is a bay in the western Gulf of Mexico along the upper coast of Texas. It is the seventh-largest estuary in the United States, and the largest of seven major estuaries along the Texas Gulf Coast. It is connected to the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by sub-tropical marshes and prairies on the mainland. The water in the bay is a complex mixture of sea water and fresh water, which supports a wide variety of marine life. With a maximum depth of about and an average depth of only , it is unusually shallow for its size.

The bay has played a significant role in the history of Texas. Galveston Island is home to the city of Galveston, the earliest major settlement in southeast Texas and the state&#x27;s largest city toward the end of the nineteenth century. While a devastating hurricane in 1900 hastened Galveston&#x27;s decline, the subsequent rise of Houston as a major trade center, facilitated by the dredging of the Houston Ship Channel across the western half of the bay, ensured the bay&#x27;s continued economic importance.

Today, Galveston Bay is encompassed by Greater Houston, the fifth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. The Port of Houston, which has facilities spread across the northwestern section of the bay, is the second-busiest port in the nation by overall tonnage. Other major ports utilizing the bay include the Port of Texas City and the Port of Galveston. With its diverse marine life, Galveston Bay also produces more seafood than any estuary in the United States except the Chesapeake.

==History==

The Gulf Coast gained its present configuration during the most recent glacial period approximately 18 ka (thousands of years ago). Low global sea levels allowed the Texas mainland to extend significantly farther south than it does presently, and the Trinity River had carved a deep canyon through present-day Bolivar Roads (the exit of the Houston Ship Channel) on its way to the coast. As the glacial period came to a close, rising sea levels initially filled this narrow canyon, followed by the broad lowlands of present-day Trinity Bay. Rapid sea level rise between 7.7 and 5.5 ka shifted the Gulf coastline northward to its contemporary latitude. This was quickly followed by the formation of Galveston Island (5.5 ka), a barrier island, and Bolivar Peninsula (2.5 ka), which began as a spit.

Human settlement in what is now Texas began at least 10 ka following migrations into the Americas from Asia during the last ice age. The first substantial settlements in the area are believed to have been made by the Karankawa and Atakapan tribes, who lived throughout the Gulf Coast region.
Though several Spanish expeditions charted the Gulf Coast, it was explorer José Antonio de Evia who in 1785 gave the bay and the island the name &quot;Gálvezton&quot; in honor of Spanish viceroy Bernardo de Gálvez. Louis Aury established a naval base at the harbor in 1816 to support the Mexican War of Independence. When he abandoned the base, it was then taken over by pirate Jean Lafitte, who temporarily transformed Galveston Island and the bay into a haven for outlaws before being ousted by the United States Navy. Following its independence from Spain, the new nation of Mexico claimed Texas as part of its territory. Settlements were established around the bay, including Galveston, Anahuac, Lynchburg, and San Jacinto. Following growing unrest, Texas revolted and gained independence in 1836 at the Battle of San Jacinto, near the bay along the San Jacinto River. The new Republic of Texas grew rapidly and joined the United States in 1845.

After the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, residents of Galveston strongly supported secession and sided with the Confederacy as the Civil War broke out. However, separation from the Union did not last long; the city&#x27;s harbor was blockaded by the federal navy starting in July 1861, followed by a full-scale occupation after the Battle of Galveston Harbor in October 1862. However, at the Battle of Galveston in January 1863, a small Confederate force managed to overwhelm the Union&#x27;s naval forces in the bay and retake the island. Despite this victory, the Union continued to blockade the outlets of Galveston Bay until the end of the war. Reconstruction was swift in southeast Texas. Ranching interests were major economic drivers on the mainland in the 19th century. The city of Galveston became a major U.S. commercial center for shipping cotton, leather products, cattle, and other goods produced in the growing state. Railroads were built around the shore and new communities continued to emerge.

The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 devastated the city of Galveston and heavily damaged communities around the bay. Growth moved inland to Houston, as fear of the risks posed by establishing businesses at Galveston limited the island&#x27;s ability to compete. Texas City emerged as another important port in the area. Shipping traffic through the bay expanded dramatically after the federal government completed the dredging of the Houston Ship Channel to a depth of in 1914. The Texas oil boom began in 1901, and by 1915 oil production by the bay was fully underway. Oil wells and refineries quickly developed throughout the area. After frozen transport became available in the 1920s, commercial fishing developed as a substantial industry, producing particularly oysters, finfish, and, later, shrimp. By the end of the 1930s, the Port of Houston was the largest cotton port and third largest port by overall tonnage in the United States.
The establishment of NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center near the bay in the Clear Lake Area in 1963 brought new growth. By the 1970s Houston had become one of the nation&#x27;s largest cities, and its expansion connected it with the bay communities. The bay&#x27;s shoreline became heavily urbanized and industrialized, leading to pollution of the bay. In the 1970s the bay was described by U.S. Representative Robert C. Eckhardt as &quot;the most polluted body of water in the U.S.&quot; The ship channel and Clear Lake were rated by the Galveston Bay Estuary Program as having even worse water quality.

Extraction of oil and groundwater, as well as large wakes from increasing shipping in the bay, led to land subsidence and erosion along the shoreline, especially in the Baytown–Pasadena area. Over the past few decades, approximately of the historic San Jacinto battleground has been submerged; Sylvan Beach, a popular destination in La Porte, has been severely eroded, and the once prominent Brownwood neighborhood of Baytown has been abandoned. Today, the bay is a major destination for recreational and tourist activities, including boating, ecotourism, and waterfowl hunting.

=== Incidents ===

==== 2019 cargo plane crash ====

Atlas Air Flight 3591 was a scheduled domestic cargo flight under the Amazon Air banner between Miami International Airport and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. On February 23, 2019, the Boeing 767-375ER(BCF) crashed into Trinity Bay near Anahuac, Texas, killing both crew members and a passenger, at approximately 12:45 CST (18:45 UTC). Shortly before impact the aircraft made a sharp turn south before going into a rapid descent. Witnesses described the plane as going into a nosedive and thunderous sounds before it crashed.

Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were deployed to the scene while dive teams from the Texas Department of Public Safety, Houston, and Baytown police departments located the aircraft&#x27;s flight recorders. The NTSB later determined that the crash was a result of the first officer&#x27;s inappropriate response to an inadvertent activation of the airplane&#x27;s go-around mode, resulting in his spatial disorientation that led him to place the airplane in a steep descent from which the crew did not recover in time from.

==== 2024 oil spill and partial bridge collapse ====
On May 15, 2024, a tugboat leaving Texas International Terminals, a container terminal next to the Pelican Island causeway, the only bridge connecting Pelican Island to the rest of Galveston, lost control of two barges it was pushing. One of the barges, operated by Martin Operating Partnership, then hit the bridge and two telephone poles at approximately 10:00 CDT (3:00 GMT) collapsing a portion of the bridge, causing a diesel fuel spill, and causing a temporary power outage on the island. Two people were knocked off of the barge or jumped off, but they were quickly rescued. As a result of the collision, the bridge was closed. The barge, which reportedly has a capacity of , spilled between and of oil into Galveston Bay. Some spilled oil stayed on top of the barge and did not leak into the water.

An approximate span of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway was shut down around the bridge in order to help crews clean up the oil spill. Galveston County officials began evacuations for the approximately 200 people who were on the island at the time of the collapse for anyone who needed to leave the island, but warned that they would be unlikely to be able to return in the near future.

==Features==

Galveston Bay covers approximately , and is long and wide. The bay has an average depth of and a maximum undredged depth of . The Galveston Bay system consists of four main bodies of water: Galveston Bay proper (upper and lower), Trinity Bay, East Bay, and West Bay. The bay is bordered by three counties: Chambers, Harris, and Galveston. Significant communities around the bay include Houston, Pasadena, League City, Baytown, Texas City, Galveston, La Porte, Seabrook, and Anahuac.

Galveston Bay has three outlets to the Gulf of Mexico: Bolivar Roads between Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula, San Luis Pass at the west end of Galveston Island, and Rollover Pass across Bolivar Peninsula. Many smaller bays and lakes are connected to the main system, including Christmas Bay, Moses Lake, Dickinson Bay, Clear Lake, Ash Lake, Black Duck Bay, and San Jacinto Bay. Together with its extensions, Galveston Bay forms the largest of the seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas. The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, an inland waterway consisting of natural watercourses and man-made canals, runs between the bay and the Gulf. A majority of the bay&#x27;s inflow comes from the Trinity River, which contributes of freshwater annually. The San Jacinto River contributes another . Local coastal watersheds contribute the remainder.

===Climate===

The climate around the Bay is classified as humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot; in Köppen climate classification system). Prevailing winds from the south and southeast bring heat from the deserts of Mexico and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Summer temperatures regularly exceed , and the area&#x27;s humidity drives the heat index even higher. Winters in the area are mild, with typical January highs above and lows above . Snowfall is generally rare. Annual rainfall averages well over , with some areas typically receiving over .

Hurricanes are an ever-present threat during the fall season. Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula are generally at the greatest risk. However, though the island and the peninsula provide some shielding, the bay shoreline still faces significant danger from storm surge. Hurricane Ike, the most economically and environmentally destructive event on the bay since 1900, struck in 2008. A proposal to build a flood barrier system to prevent against future storm surge, the so-called Ike Dike, has been considered by the state government. In August 2017, the Galveston Bay Area was struck by Hurricane Harvey and received an extraordinary amount of rainfall in a matter of days, with many locations in the bay area observing more than of precipitation during the storm.

==Ecosystem==
This unique and complex mixing of waters from different sources provides nursery and spawning grounds for many types of marine life including crabs, shrimp, oysters, and many varieties of fish, thereby supporting a substantial fishing industry. The deeper navigation channels of the bay provide suitable habitats for bottlenose dolphins, which feed on the abundant fish varieties. Additionally, the bayous, rivers, and marshes that ring the bay support their own collection of ecosystems, containing diverse wildlife and enabling freshwater farming of crawfish.

The wetlands that surround the bay support a variety of fauna. Notable terrestrial species include the American alligator and the bobcat, while bird species include the roseate spoonbill, great and snowy egret, white-faced ibis, and mottled duck.

===Pollution===

In the early 1990s, the Houston Ship Channel had the fifth highest level of toxic chemicals in the nation due to industrial discharge, with over discharged between 1990 and 1994. However, the bay has generally experienced improving water quality since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972. The Houston Area Research Council (HARC) and Galveston Bay Foundation periodically release the Galveston Bay Report Card, which grades a number of metrics indicative of the health of the bay&#x27;s ecosystem and waters. The 2019 report assigned a &quot;C&quot; grade for toxins in bay sediments, citing water and soil pollution, wildlife habitat loss, and the impacts of climate change as challenges facing the estuary. The presence of the San Jacinto Pits Superfund site in the Houston Ship Channel, which contains large amounts of dioxin, is considered a significant threat to the bay&#x27;s health. The entire bay is covered by seafood consumption advisories set by the Texas Department of State Health Services, but the strictness of these standards varies by location. In the Ship Channel, advisories recommend against the consumption of all fish and blue crab, while in the lower bay, advisories only apply to catfish.

Oil spills are a routine consequence of the industrial activity around Galveston Bay, with hundreds of spills taking place in a typical year. On March 22, 2014, a barge carrying marine fuel oil collided with another ship in the Houston Ship Channel, causing the contents of one of the barge&#x27;s tanks to leak into the bay, requiring weeks of cleanup by dozens of boats. Excessive ozone levels can occur due to industrial activities; nearby Houston is ranked among the most ozone-polluted cities in the United States. The industries located along the ship channel are a major cause of ozone pollution.

== Industry ==
Galveston Bay is located in Greater Houston, which is the fifth largest metropolitan area in the United States, and home to one of the nation&#x27;s most significant shipping centers. Houston, the nation&#x27;s fourth largest city, is the economic and cultural center of the region. Important ports served by the bay include the Port of Houston, the Port of Texas City, and the Port of Galveston. The Houston Ship Channel, which connects the Port of Houston to the Gulf, passes through the bay. It is a partially man-made feature created by dredging the Buffalo Bayou, the ship channel subbays, and Galveston Bay.

The area has a broad industrial base including the energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, transportation, and health care sectors. The bayside communities in particular are home to the Johnson Space Center, which houses the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base, Ellington Airport (home of the Houston Spaceport), and a high concentration of petrochemical refineries.

A large commercial fishing industry has grown around Galveston Bay, with significant production of shrimp, blue crab, eastern oyster, black drum, flounder, sheepshead, and snapper. In 2012, the commercial fish harvest in Galveston Bay amounted to , with a wholesale value of roughly $16.4 million.

Galveston Bay supports a significant recreation and tourism industry, especially as a result of its proximity to major population centers. Over 40% of Greater Houston residents participate annually in hiking and swimming along the bay, while 20% go fishing and 15% go boating. The five counties surrounding the bay are home to 88,000 registered pleasure crafts. Fishing expenditures (such as the purchase of fishing bait or lodging) along Galveston Bay and Sabine Lake generate approximately $650 million annually. The recreational fishing industry supports over 3,000 jobs in the bay area.

With over 600 species of birds, Galveston Bay is a popular destination for birdwatching. This sort of ecotourism generates millions in annual revenue for Chambers County, which is home to the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge and High Island.

<text>Christopher Judge is an American actor. He is best known for playing Teal&#x27;c in the Canadian-American military science fiction television series &quot;Stargate SG-1,&quot; and for being the second actor to portray Kratos in the &quot;God of War&quot; video game series, playing the role in &quot;God of War&quot; (2018) and its sequel &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot; (2022). He attended the University of Oregon on a football scholarship and was a Pacific-10 Conference player.

==Early life==
Judge wanted to be an actor from an early age, and studied drama in high school. &quot;The television set was my babysitter growing up. I can remember wanting to invoke the feelings that I was getting from television—I wanted to be the one who was the catalyst for those feelings in other people. Performing was something I&#x27;ve always known I was going to do.&quot; He always knew that sports would be a stepping stone to an acting career.

Judge received a scholarship from the University of Oregon and played defensive back and safety for the Ducks from 1982 to 1985. He led in kickoff return yardage for 1983-84 and interceptions in 1984, and won the Casanova Award in 1982, awarded to the freshman or newcomer of the year. While at Oregon, Judge was a Pacific-10 Conference Selection in 1984 and played in the 1985 Hula Bowl.

Judge won a contest to host a radio show in Oregon, and in his senior year he won a regional contest to host the West Coast FOX KLSR Morning Show, an &quot;MTV talk show type thing&quot;; he used this experience to get an agent and move back to Los Angeles.

==Career==

===Acting===

In 1989 Judge began studying at the Howard Fine Studio in Los Angeles. His early roles in the 1990s included &quot;Bird on a Wire&quot;, &quot;Cadence&quot;, &quot;Neon Rider&quot; and &quot;MacGyver&quot; with future &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; star Richard Dean Anderson. In the ensuing years, Judge had small parts in various television shows and films such as &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; (with future &quot;SG-1&quot; director Peter DeLuise), &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, and &quot;House Party 2&quot;, and as a regular on &quot;Sirens&quot; from 1994 to 1995.

Judge&#x27;s largest role came in 1997 with &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. While at a friend&#x27;s house, he saw his friend&#x27;s roommate practicing for an audition for the show and was intrigued. While the roommate was away, Judge looked at the audition notes, called his agent, and insisted he get him an audition or lose him as a client. At the audition, there were three actors trying out for each of the other principal roles, but eight or ten for the role of Teal&#x27;c. Judge was confident that he had acquired the part when they dismissed everyone who had read for the part except him.

Judge&#x27;s subsequent work includes guest spots on &quot;Andromeda&quot;, &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, &quot;The Mentalist&quot;, the television film &quot;Personal Effects&quot;, and the films &quot;Snow Dogs&quot; and &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Breakfast&quot;, the latter written and directed by fellow Stargate actor David Hewlett. Judge appeared in &quot;Anonymous&quot;, the October 26, 2010 episode of &quot;&quot;, and as one of Bane&#x27;s henchmen in the 2012 film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;.

===Writing===
Judge wrote four &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; episodes: season five&#x27;s &quot;The Warrior&quot;, season six&#x27;s &quot;The Changeling&quot;, season seven&#x27;s &quot;Birthright&quot;, and season eight&#x27;s &quot;Sacrifices&quot;.

After &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was cancelled, Judge began writing a script for a show called &quot;Rage of Angels&quot; that would have enabled him to play &quot;the lead in an hour formatted show and prove that a black lead can be commercially viable and sustainable in overseas markets.&quot; The script was marketed as a two-hour, backdoor pilot with MGM, but is now apparently with Direct TV and Starz Media.

===Voice work===

Judge has also done voice acting for animated series and video games, including Magneto on &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot;, and the canceled &quot;Stargate SG-1: The Alliance&quot;.

In the season eight episode, &quot;Avatar&quot;, Teal&#x27;c informs SG-1 that he plays &quot;Def Jam Vendetta&quot;, alluding to the fact that Judge had provided the voice of D-Mob, the main antagonist in that game. He once again appeared as D-Mob in the sequel, &quot;Def Jam: Fight for NY&quot;. He voiced Jericho in &quot;Turok&quot;.

Judge provided the voice of Zodak on the 2002 &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; cartoon as well as Coach Grey in the Action Man CGI series from 2000.

On June 14, 2016, Judge confirmed he was the voice actor for Kratos in the 2018 &quot;God of War&quot;, replacing longtime voice actor Terrence C. Carson. He reprised the role in &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot;.

==Personal life==
Judge is involved with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Canada and is an avid golfer.

His son, Cameron, is a professional Canadian football linebacker for the Calgary Stampeders; Cameron played college football for UCLA and was drafted 2nd overall in the 2017 CFL Draft. His other son, Christopher Jordan, played college football for Cal Poly and was drafted 71st overall in the 2019 CFL Draft.

According to tweets from Judge, he could not walk in 2019, and he had to undergo surgery to have both his hips replaced, alongside back and knee surgery.

<text>The San Diego County Sheriff&#x27;s Office (SDSO) is a law enforcement agency serving San Diego County, California. It was established in 1850. It is the largest law enforcement agency in the county and one of the largest sheriff&#x27;s offices in the United States, with over 4,700 employees, an annual budget of over $1.1 billion, and a service area over 4,500 square miles extending to a 60-mile international border.

The office provides general law enforcement and public safety services to all unincorporated areas of the county (traffic enforcement, accidents, and other traffic related issues are handled by the California Highway Patrol). Nine incorporated cities within the county (Del Mar, Encinitas, Imperial Beach, Lemon Grove, Poway, San Marcos, Santee, Solana Beach, and Vista) contract with the office for municipal law enforcement and public safety services. Within these cities, traffic enforcement is also provided.

The office operates and provides detention facilities (jails), court services, and specialized regional services (air support, search and rescue, SWAT, etc.) to all of the county and the nine contract cities. The Wireless Services Division is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the San Diego County–Imperial County Regional Communications System. The Sheriff is elected by the voters of San Diego County. The current Sheriff is Kelly Martinez, who was elected in 2022 and took office at the beginning of 2023.

==History==
The San Diego County Sheriff&#x27;s Department was formed in 1850.

The San Diego County Sheriff&#x27;s Department was a co-appellant in the Supreme Court of the United States and Ninth Circuit cases Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352 (1983), which held unconstitutional laws that allow law enforcement to demand that &quot;loiterers&quot; and &quot;wanderers&quot; provide identification; this continues to affect other offices nationwide.

On September 10, 2024, the agency&#x27;s official name was changed to the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office.

==Vehicles==


Over the years, the agency&#x27;s marked vehicles have sported unusual paint schemes. Originally in a traditional black and white, they transitioned to a pink-salmon color in the 1960s. From 1971 to 1991 the vehicles were painted kelly green-and-white which were the campaign colors of Sheriff John F. Duffy. When he retired the fleet was returned to the black-and-white color scheme and has remained so ever since. The office has also had a few all-white cars over the years, but these were for Traffic Enforcement and Volunteer Patrols only.

Today, the San Diego County Sheriff&#x27;s Office utilizes the Ford Explorer as their base model for their fleet.

The SDSO also operates the Following Aircraft: 
Hughes 500, Bell 205, and Bell 407.

==Weapons==
*Glock 17 – standard-issue handgun equipped with a Streamlight TLR-1.
*Glock 22 .40 S&amp;W – previously standard issue, being phased out.
*Glock 23 .40 S&amp;W – used by detectives and other investigators, some regular deputies carry it as well as an off-duty weapon. 
*Glock 27 .40 S&amp;W – backup gun for deputies, used by some investigators as well as an off-duty weapon for some deputies. 
*Colt CAR-15A1/A2 – R6520 variant used as a patrol rifle for deputies as is the R0603 (M16A1) variant can also be seen in patrol vehicles. 
*Remington 870 12-gauge – standard-issue shotgun for deputies, is a pump-action shotgun.
*Springfield Armory M-14 – used for certain situations, is not the standard-issue rifle but the SDSO does have a few M-14s in the agency&#x27;s inventory.

<text>Brigadier-General James Henry Lane (June 22, 1814 – July 11, 1866) was an American politician and military officer who was a leader of the Jayhawkers in the Bleeding Kansas period that immediately preceded the American Civil War. During the war itself, Lane served in the United States Senate and as a general officer in the Union Army. Although reelected as a Senator in 1865, Lane died by suicide the next year.

==Early life==
The son of Amos Lane, Lane was born in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, where he practiced law when he was admitted to the state bar during 1840. During the Mexican–American War, he successively commanded the 3rd and 5th Indiana Regiments. He was a U.S. congressman from Indiana (1853–1855) where he voted for the Kansas–Nebraska Act.

He relocated to the Kansas Territory during 1855. Remaining a Democrat for a time, he eventually became involved with the antislavery movement in Kansas, and joined the Republican party. He was often termed the commander of the Free State Army (&quot;The Red Legs&quot; or Jayhawkers), a major Free Soil militant group. In 1855 he was the president of the convention that drafted the anti-slavery Topeka Constitution. In the summer of 1857, he co-founded Falls City, Nebraska, intending for it to serve as a station on the Underground Railroad.

By 1858, Lane had become a member of the Kansas Danites, a secret-society founded in 1855 to oppose Missouri&#x27;s influence in Kansas. The Kansas Danites were inspired by the earlier Mormon Danites, which had formed in Missouri in 1838, during the 1838 Mormon War in that state.

On June 3, 1858, Lane shot and killed Gaius Jenkins in a land dispute in Lawrence. According to reports Jenkins was coming to get water from a well on the disputed property. Jenkins was reported to have been displaying a revolver. Lane met him with a shotgun. One of the men with Jenkins shot Lane in the leg and Lane returned fire killing Jenkins. Lane was acquitted in the trial, which kept him from participating in the convention drafting of the Wyandotte Constitution, later the official constitution for Kansas.

After the Free Soilers succeeded in getting Kansas admitted to the Union in 1861 as a free state, Lane was elected as one of the new state&#x27;s first U.S. Senators, and reelected in 1865.

==Civil War==
During the American Civil War, in addition to his Senate service, Lane formed a brigade of &quot;Jayhawkers&quot; known as the &quot;Kansas Brigade&quot;, or &quot;Lane&#x27;s Brigade&quot;, composed of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Kansas Volunteers. He commanded the force into action against pro-Southern General Sterling Price of Missouri in the Battle of Dry Wood Creek, as Price began an offensive early in the War to retake Missouri for the pro-Confederate state government that had been deposed by pro-Union forces around St. Louis. Lane lost the battle but stayed behind and attacked pro-South areas in Missouri behind Price. During the subsequent Siege of Lexington, General John Charles Fremont ordered General Henry Lane to make a &quot;demonstration along the Kansas Missouri border with his Jayhawkers&quot;. Lane acted gladly on Fremont&#x27;s official authorization for a raid into Missouri. He raided the village of Morristown near the state line, burned it and swept a wide path of pillage, arson and murder of private citizens through the Missouri territory six miles wide and fifteen miles long. However as it turns out it had little to no effect on Mulligan. &quot;His raids culminated in the Sacking of Osceola, in which Lane&#x27;s forces killed at least nine men, then pillaged, looted, and then burned the town; these events inspired the novel &quot;Gone to Texas&quot; by Forrest Carter, which was the basis for the 1976 Clint Eastwood movie &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;. Lane was criticized for his violence in Osceola, most severely by General Henry Halleck, then Commander of the Department of Missouri. Of their actions, he would state: &quot;The course pursued by those under Lane and Jennison has turned against us many thousands who were formerly Union men. A few more such raids, in connection with the ultra speeches made by leading men in Congress, will make the State as unanimous against us as is Eastern Virginia.&quot; Thus, Lane&#x27;s Brigade was ended.

On December 18, 1861, Lane was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. On March 21, 1862, his commission was canceled in the culmination of an argument over whether a sitting U.S. Senator could concurrently have the rank of General. However, on April 11, 1862, he was reinstated as brigadier general of volunteers with the confirmation of the U.S. Senate. During 1862–1863, he served as recruiting commissioner for the State of Kansas.

On October 27–29, 1862, U.S. Senator Jim Lane recruited the 1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry (Colored) who debuted at the Skirmish at Island Mound. They are the first African-American troops to fight in the war, a year before the 54th Massachusetts. In their first action, 30 of their members defeated 130 mounted Confederate guerrillas.

Lane was the target of the event that became the Lawrence Massacre (or Quantrill&#x27;s Raid) on August 21, 1863. Confederate guerrillas could be heard shouting, &quot;Remember Osceola!&quot; Though Lane was in residence in Lawrence at the time, he was able to escape the attack by racing through a nearby ravine, hiding in a cornfield for the duration of the attack.

In a speech given in 1863, while the 38th United States Congress was debating a bill that would confiscate land from rebelling southerners, Lane said, &quot;I would like to live long enough to see every white man in South Carolina in hell, and the Negroes inheriting their territory. It would not wound my feelings any day to find the dead bodies of rebel sympathizers pierced with bullet holes in every street and alley of Washington. Yes, I would regret this, for I would not like to witness all this waste of powder and lead. I would rather have them hung, and the ropes saved! Let them dangle until their stinking bodies rot and fall to the ground piece by piece.&quot;

During 1864 when Sterling Price invaded Missouri, Lane served as a volunteer aide-de-camp to Samuel R. Curtis, commander of the Army of the Border. Lane was with the victorious Union forces at the battle of Westport.

==Personal life==
Lane was a teetotaller. It was noted by many of his contemporaries that he was never seen to consume alcohol; he specifically ordered his troops to burn stockpiles of whiskey during the Sacking of Osceola. He was well-known, however, for his near-constant use of &quot;dog-leg&quot; chewing tobacco, a form of tobacco which was twisted into a stick and chewed.

Lane&#x27;s critics often accused him of lechery, alleging that he committed adultery with prostitutes and mistresses, and that he had made numerous unsuccessful attempts to seduce various married women while living in Lawrence. This has been disputed by Lane&#x27;s defenders.

Lane&#x27;s wife, Mary Lane, left Lawrence to return to Indiana in 1856, and filed for a divorce. They were remarried in 1857, after which they both returned to Lawrence.

Lane was a Methodist.

==Death and legacy==
On July 1, 1866, Lane shot himself in the head as he jumped from his carriage in Leavenworth, Kansas. He was allegedly deranged, depressed, had been charged with abandoning his fellow Radical Republicans and had been accused of financial irregularities. He died ten days later near Leavenworth, Kansas, a result of the self-inflicted gunshot. Edmund G. Ross was appointed to succeed him in the Senate.

Lane&#x27;s posthumous legacy has been controversial, both among supporters of the Union as well as those of the Confederacy. The Southern view of Lane has been almost entirely negative, often portraying him as a corrupt and genocidal war criminal. Many abolitionists have presented him with almost equal unfavourability, often painting him as an unscrupulous, corrupt political opportunist who feigned his radicalism in order to achieve power in antislavery Kansas.

Much of the criticism directed towards Lane from the Northern side stems from his many disputes with Charles L. Robinson, the first governor of Kansas. The dispute between the two men centered mostly around personal animosity, as well as political rivalry, but it also represents ideological, class, and regional differences as well. Robinson was a long-term Republican and a staunch abolitionist, while Lane was a former Democrat and merely an antislavery man. The Robinson faction in Kansas generally consisted of abolitionist immigrants from New England, many of them religious and well-to-do, who opposed slavery on what they considered a &quot;moral&quot; ground. Lane&#x27;s supporters, on the other hand, were mostly working-class Midwesterners who opposed slavery in the Kansas Territory due to class interests. As such, his reputation has often been maligned among New Englanders, while he is viewed more positively in the Midwest.

While many of Lane&#x27;s pro-Union apologists concede that Lane often made ruthless use of realpolitik, they defend him on the grounds that he did what was needed to defeat slavery in Kansas, as well as to protect its citizens during the Civil War, when many of the more radical and idealistic abolitionists, such as Robinson, were seeking passive and ineffective alternatives.

<doc id="593589" wikidata="Q35941" url="?curid=593589" title="Amorite language">
<text>Amorite is an extinct early Semitic language, formerly spoken during the Bronze Age by the Amorite tribes prominent in ancient Near Eastern history. It is known from Ugaritic, which is classed by some as its westernmost dialect, and from non-Akkadian proper names recorded by Akkadian scribes during periods of Amorite rule in Babylonia (the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC), notably from Mari and to a lesser extent Alalakh, Tell Harmal and Khafajah. Occasionally, such names are also found in early Egyptian texts; and one place name, &quot;Sənīr&quot; (שְׂנִיר) for Mount Hermon, is known from the Bible (Book of Deuteronomy, ).

Amorite is considered an archaic Northwest Semitic language.

Notable characteristics include the following:

* The usual Northwest Semitic imperfective-perfective distinction is found: &quot;Yantin-Dagan&quot;, &#x27;Dagon gives&#x27; (&quot;ntn&quot;); &quot;Raṣa-Dagan&quot;, &#x27;Dagon was pleased&#x27; (rṣy). It included a 3rd-person suffix -&quot;a&quot; (unlike Akkadian or Hebrew) and an imperfect vowel, &quot;a&quot;-, as in Arabic rather than the Hebrew and Aramaic -&quot;i&quot;-.
* There was a verb form with a geminate second consonant — &quot;Yabanni-Il&quot;, &#x27;God creates&#x27; (root &quot;bny&quot;).
* In several cases that Akkadian has &quot;š&quot;, Amorite, like Hebrew and Arabic, has &quot;h&quot;, thus &quot;hu&quot; &#x27;his&#x27;, -&quot;haa&quot; &#x27;her&#x27;, causative &quot;h-&quot; or &quot;ʼ&quot;- (I. Gelb 1958).
* The 1st-person perfect is in -&quot;ti&quot; (singular), -&quot;nu&quot; (plural), as in the Canaanite languages.

In 2022, two large, 3,800-year-old, Amorite-Akkadian bilingual tablets were published, yielding a large corpus of Northwest Semitic. The text, in the Amorite/Canaanite languages, bears a recognizable similarity to Hebrew, and demonstrates that a spoken language very close to Hebrew existed by the second millennium BCE, rather than the first millennium BCE.

<text>Portions of Lubbock, Texas, were struck by a powerful multiple-vortex tornado after nightfall on May 11, 1970, resulting in 26 fatalities and an estimated $250 million in damage (equivalent to $ billion in ). It was in its time the costliest tornado in U.S. history, damaging nearly 9,000 homes and inflicting widespread damage to businesses, high-rise buildings, and public infrastructure. The tornado&#x27;s damage was surveyed by meteorologist Ted Fujita in what researcher Thomas P. Grazulis described as &quot;the most detailed mapping ever done, up to that time, of the path of a single tornado.&quot; Originally, the most severe damage was assigned a preliminary F6 rating on the Fujita scale, making it one of only two tornadoes to receive the rating, alongside the 1974 Xenia tornado. Later, it was downgraded to an F5 rating. The extremity of the damage and the force required to displace heavy objects as much as was observed indicated that winds produced by vortices within the tornado may have exceeded .

Although skies were clear, dry, and sunny in Lubbock during the afternoon of May 11, the westward push of a dry line brought moist air into West Texas, providing suitable conditions for thunderstorm development. After 6:30 p.m., thunderstorms were in progress over the Lubbock area. At least two tornadoes developed prior to the main F5 tornado, including one that tracked across parts of eastern Lubbock near U.S. 87. The primary F5 tornado touched down in southwestern Lubbock at 9:35 p.m. and over the next half-hour carved a path of devastation encompassing roughly a quarter of the city, with the twister lifting near the Lubbock Municipal Airport shortly after 10 p.m. The tornado varied in size, spanning across when it first touched down before narrowing to around by the time it lifted. Severe damage was wrought to high-rises and other buildings in downtown Lubbock, including the 20-story Great Plains Life Building. The tornado briefly moved west and weakened, causing light damage to the campus of Texas Tech University before reintensifying and resuming a northward path. The tornado&#x27;s most destructive impacts were observed in the Guadalupe barrio, north of 4th Street, along Texas State Highway Loop 289, and near the Lubbock County Club. In those locales, some homes were completely leveled and many others were irreparably damaged. Around 119 aircraft were damaged at the Lubbock airport where the Lubbock office of the United States Weather Bureau was located. As of 2024, this remains the westernmost F5/EF5 tornado recorded in the United States.

==Synopsis==
===Developing storms (before 8 p.m.)===

The Severe Local Storms Unit (SELS) within the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC) of the United States Weather Bureautasked with issuing daily outlooks projecting possible severe weather over the U.S.did not initially highlight the possibility of severe weather over West Texas when the agency issued its daily outlook at 4 a.m. early on May 11, 1970. Six hours later, the SELS amended the outlook to indicate that &quot;isolated thunderstorms with large hail&quot; were &quot;expected in High Plains of West Texas east of Pecos late afternoon and early evening.&quot; The afternoon was warm and dry in Lubbock with the temperature rising above and the dew point remaining at around . As the air mass over the region became increasingly unstable, the forecast agency later advised of the possibility that some of the isolated thunderstorms could become severe. However, the atmospheric conditions aloft were generally unsupportive of a tornado outbreak.

The skies over Lubbock were initially clear on May 11, with the ambient moisture too low to support severe convective storms on its own. However, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico spread north-northwest into the area during the day, providing sufficient buoyancy for convective development. Cumulus clouds began to proliferate over the region by around 4 p.m. and towering cumulus clouds began to develop over West Texas, darkening the skies over Lubbock. The WSR-57 weather radar site in Amarillo, Texas, began detecting radar echoes south of Lubbock at 6:30 p.m. Lubbock radar later picked up on a thunderstorm with a diameter of approximately forming near Woodrow, Texas, south of the Lubbock Municipal Airport. Satellite imagery from the ATS-3 satellite showed that the storm emerged about behind the leading edge of the advancing mass of moist air originating from the Gulf. Although the westward retreat of this boundaryknown as a dry linewould typically coincide with nightfall and a stabilizing of the atmosphere, it did not move far from Lubbock during the evening, maintaining a local area of converging winds and moist rising air supportive of thunderstorm growth. These conducive conditions were also bolstered by the approach of a shortwave trough in the mid-levels of the troposphere, serving as another contributor to rising air. By 7 p.m. the northern fringes of the storm were near the Lubbock city limits. A radiosonde launched from Amarillo concurrently showed that the tropopause had risen by to over the preceding 12 hours. The Amarillo weather radar also suggested that the thunderstorm&#x27;s cloud tops were rising to at least .

Ironically, at the time the storm was developing, the Lubbock Civil Defense was holding a meeting to discuss disaster preparation plans, highlighted by showing the documentary film &quot;Tornado!&quot; (1966). The Lubbock Tornado itself became the subject of another documentary, &quot;Twister&quot;, with a subtle emphasis on a bumper sticker: &quot;Lucky Me! I Live in Lubbock!&quot;

With the storm approaching and threatening to become severe, Alan Johnson of the Weather Bureau called Bill Payne, the director of Lubbock Civil Defense, to provide notice of the inclement weather. The emergency operations center (EOC) at the basement of the Lubbock city hall was activated at 7:45 p.m. Following discussion between forecasters at the local Weather Bureau office in Lubbock (Lubbock WBO, located at the Lubbock airport) and the radar operator in Amarillo, a severe thunderstorm warning was issued by the Lubbock WBO for Crosby, Floyd, Lubbock, and Hale counties at 7:50 p.m. with an expiration time set to 9:00 p.m. This warning was disseminated via the Emergency Action Notification Signal and through local radio and television stations such as KFYO. KFYO continuously ran without commercials after this time until 7:30 a.m. on May 14. Despite the increasingly conducive atmospheric conditions for the formation of severe thunderstorms, the NSSFC did not issue a severe thunderstorm watch or tornado watch for the region before storms developed. The Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) wrote in a service assessment of the weather event that the lack of such of a watch from the NSSFC demanded &quot;some explanation,&quot; but also noted that their absence did not affect the operations of the Lubbock WBO.

===Precursor tornadoes develop (8–9 p.m.)===
Large hail the size of grapefruits were reported in the thunderstorm south of Lubbock at around 8 p.m., with baseball-sized hail reaching southeastern Lubbock by 8:13 p.m. Severe Weather Statements were transmitted by the Lubbock WBO over the Weather Wire Service to relay the hail reports as the storm neared Lubbock. Radar data indicated that the thunderstorm&#x27;s cloud tops had increased to by 8:10 p.m. At around the same time, an off-duty policeman reported a funnel cloud southeast of the Lubbock airport and east of the city limits. This, along with the detection of a hook echo on radar, prompted the Lubbock Weather Bureau office to issue a tornado warning for Crosby, eastern Floyd, western Hale, and Lubbock counties at 8:15 p.m. with an expiration time of 9:00 p.m. At 8:30 p.m., a tornadothe first of two to strike the Lubbock areatouched down near the intersection of Broadway and Quint Avenue in eastern Lubbock. Described by tornado researcher Ted Fujita as a &quot;small forerunner&quot; to the main Lubbock tornado, this first twister produced a damage path roughly across and caused structural damage indicative of wind gusts reaching around . The most severe damage occurred near the interchange between U.S. 82 and Parkway Drive, which was under construction at the time. There, 13 concrete beams weighing each and doubly weighted with chains were blown down from a partially-built overpass by the tornado.

At 8:40 p.m., the NSSFC issued a severe thunderstorm watch for the entirety of the Southern Plains. Concurrently, two thunderstorms quickly developed southwest of the Lubbock airport and moved northeast at ; their formation was noted on a Severe Weather Statement issued by the Lubbock WBO at 8:42 p.m. At 8:59 p.m., the office issued a bulletin that extended the preexisting tornado warning to 10 p.m. The bulletin also advised people to prepare to seek shelter with radar imagery and reports continuing to indicate that a tornado was in progress roughly south-southeast of the Lubbock airport. At around 9:00 p.m., a separate tornadolisted as an F1 tornado in the National Centers for Environmental Information&#x27;s &quot;Storm Events&quot; databaseunroofed a barn approximately north of Crosbyton, shearing the sheet metal roof over a nearby pasture.

===The main Lubbock tornado (after 9 p.m.)===
Large hail continued to fall throughout Lubbock, with reports indicating hail the size of golf balls and baseballs. After around 9 p.m., the radar echoes associated with the storms in the Lubbock area began to congeal, resulting in a singular, larger echo. This coalescence had been previously observed in connection with tornadogenesis. By 9:14 p.m., the severe thunderstorm was in diameter based on radar data. At 9:35 p.m., the main Lubbock tornado, much larger and more destructive than the previous tornadoes, touched down near the intersection of 19th Street and University Avenue and began to track towards the north-northeast. The WSR-1 radar site in Lubbock simultaneously observed a hook echo in the thunderstorm coincident with the newly formed tornado. This prompted the Lubbock WBO to alert the Lubbock Civil Defense EOC, which, in combination with a spotter report of a funnel cloud in the area, resulted in the activation of tornado warning sirens. However, the tornado&#x27;s winds had already severed the power lines that serviced many of the sirens, rendering them inoperable and causing their failure to activate. Although police cruisers also sounded their sirens to alert those nearby of the imminent tornado, many ultimately did not hear either signal and thus likely received no warning.

Communications were brought down as the tornado tore through Lubbock and triggered widespread power outages. At 9:43 p.m., Bud Andrews, the radio announcer on KFYO, directed listeners to take shelter shortly before the AM station stopped transmitting. The Lubbock Civil Defense headquarters lost commercial power and communications at 9:46 p.m. with the exception of a single telephone line. The Lubbock WBO was able to reach the EOC at 9:47 p.m. to relay that the hook echo observed on radar was in the vicinity of 4th Street and Avenue U. This was the last communication transmitted by the Lubbock WBO as all communications went offline at 9:49 p.m. The WSR-1 radar also went offline around the same time following the downing of its emergency generator. The personnel at the office abandoned their post and took shelter at 9:55 p.m. shortly before the tornado passed over the Lubbock WBO. With the Lubbock WBO no longer fully operational, dissemination of subsequent tornado warnings were carried out by the agency using the VHF-FM radio of the Lubbock Fire Department; this was ultimately the only line of communication between the Lubbock WBO and the surrounding area and allowed tornado warnings to be communicated to the Abernathy, New Deal, and Petersburg areas at 10:10 p.m. Wind gusts at the nearby airport reached at 10:03 p.m., likely coinciding with the tornado&#x27;s passage over the airport and the Weather Bureau office. The tornado lifted near the airport shortly thereafter. All weather warnings were called off by the Lubbock WBO at 11:30 p.m. once thunderstorms had lessened to a more moderate intensity around Lorenzo, Texas.

==Impact==
The primary Lubbock tornadothe second of two tornadoes that struck the city on May 11produced a damage path long and extending across of ground, beginning at 9:35 p.m. in southwestern Lubbock, tracking through downtown Lubbock, and lifting shortly after 10 p.m. near the Lubbock Municipal Airport This damage path covered nearly a quarter of the city. The tornado was wide when it formed and when it tracked through downtown, tying it with the 1947 Glazier–Higgins tornados as the widest tornado recorded in Texas history. The tornado narrowed as it tracked northeast, reaching a width of when it impacted the Lubbock airport. It was the second tornado in Texas history to strike the downtown area of a city of comparable size, with the first being the 1953 Waco tornado, and one of the most destructive to hit any U.S. city. As the tornado struck after nightfall, no photographs were taken of the twister.

There were 26 fatalities and numerous injuries, with estimates of the lower-bound on the number of casualties ranging from 500 to as high as 2,000. Approximately 1,500 people were treated for injuries and 96 people were hospitalized, with many of the injuries caused by broken glass in the downtown area. Estimates of the tornado&#x27;s damage toll vary: the National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office in Lubbock and the National Centers for Environmental Information Storm Events Database lists the tornado as having caused $250 million (equivalent to $ billion in ) in damage. The May 1970 edition of &quot;Storm Data&quot; initially estimated a $135 million (equivalent to $ billion in ) property damage toll. Nonetheless, the lower estimate made the Lubbock tornado the costliest tornado in Texas history. It also became the costliest tornado in U.S. history, incurring more damage than the tornado that struck Topeka, Kansas, on June 8, 1966; the Lubbock tornado&#x27;s toll was later surpassed by a tornado that struck Omaha, Nebraska, in 1975. According to the National Weather Service, 8,800 homes were damaged, of which 430 were destroyed. The American Red Cross enumerated damage to 1,713 single family homes, of which 460 were destroyed. Additionally, 600 apartment units were destroyed and 250 businesses were damaged or destroyed. Ten thousand vehicles were also damaged or destroyed; some cars were compacted to a height of above the ground. Damage to private vehicles reached approximately $3 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Estacado High School, Thompson Junior High School, and eight elementary schools (Arnett, Jackson, Hunt, K. Carter, McWhorter, North Avenue U, and Sanders) were damaged. The tornado also caused extensive power outages and disruptions to communications, knocking out service to 25,000 telephones. Large trees were also uprooted throughout the damage swath.

The severity of damage along the tornado&#x27;s path varied considerably, a phenomenon the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) ascribed to both the varied structural integrity of the buildings impacted and the varied wind patterns generated by the tornado. In some areas, homes with minor shingle damage remained standing next to homes with total loss of their roofs. While an NBS investigation concluded that two tornadoes touched down east of Texas Tech University before merging into a single tornado north of downtown, analysis of the tornado damage conducted by Ted Fujita deduced there was a singular multiple-vortex tornado composed of smaller vortices that produced smaller areas of serious damage; 25 of the 26 fatalities occurred in the paths of these smaller vortices. Fujita&#x27;s analysis of these vortices, which he termed &quot;section spots&quot;, suggested that rotational winds of were produced by the tornado. Two homes in the path of one of these small vortices were pulverized, with the remaining debris carried away onto a field. One empty fertilizer tank weighing was displaced , with the tank likely remaining airbone for , being lofted by a tornadic vortex above US-87 before rolling to its final position. When Fujita proposed his eponymous scale for rating tornado damage in 1971, he rated the most severe damage from Lubbock as F5, the highest practical rating on the scale. John A. Shanahan of Stone &amp; Webster analyzed several instances of severe damage produced by the tornado, finding that horizontal winds may have ranged between . Supporting evidence for winds of such strength included a steel tank weighing being displaced from its initial supporting structure.

Downtown Lubbock was heavily impacted by the tornado, with skyscrapers and buildings subjected to the tornado&#x27;s violent winds. The tornado also narrowed during its traversal of downtown to a diameter of roughly , producing in a corresponding increase of winds around the tornado. Eighty percent of the plate glass windows in the downtown district were shattered. The tornado&#x27;s periphery struck the 20-story Great Plains Life Building (now known as the NTS Building), distorting the building&#x27;s frame counter-clockwise and disabling three of the building&#x27;s four elevators. The torsion of the entire building resulted in severe cracks in the building&#x27;s stairwells and on the fire protection surrounding steel columns within the tower. Brick was also stripped from the building and windows were blown out by the atmospheric pressure differences induced by the tornado. Interior pressure buildup fractured loadbearing columns and lofted ceilings. As the center of the tornado remained northwest of the skyscraper, the building likely avoided more extreme damage; the damage toll nonetheless reached around $2 million (equivalent to $ million in ). There were around 30 people in the building when the tornado hit; they took shelter in the lobby as the tornado passed nearby. The predominantly glass north and southern façades of the 15-story First National Bank–Pioneer Natural Gas Building (now the Wells Fargo Building) were largely destroyed. The marble veneer of the building&#x27;s eastern and western ends were ripped from their copper wire anchor. Strong winds penetrated the buildings interior, damaging suspended ceilings. Total damage to the building amounted to around $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Signs were ripped from the roof of the Lubbock National Bank Building while the Citizens National Bank Building and Lubbock County Courthouse sustained primarily minor window damage. The two-story plate glass windows on the eastern side of the Lubbock City Hall were shattered, leading to the collapse of some interior walls; overall the city hall sustained moderate damage. Federal government buildings in downtown Lubbock avoided significant damage, with occupied and operational buildings collectively sustaining only around $2,000 in damage. However, $150,000-worth of construction materials were damaged at the site of the eight-story Federal Office Building, which was under construction at the time.
Several churches were damaged: the Broadway Church of Christ lost roof tiles and window panes and the roof of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church collapsed. The publishing facilities of the &quot;Lubbock Avalanche-Journal&quot; were crippled by the tornado. The roof of the Central Fire Station collapsed, smashing the fire trucks below. One dispatcher on duty was struck by shards of flying glass and lost an eye. One Greyhound bus was hurled onto a downtown building by the tornado. The steel frames of the two buildings at Newson&#x27;s Living Center were contorted by the tornado; one of the buildings was destroyed while the other sustained heavy damage on its topmost, second story.

The tornado curved west its initial traversal of downtown Lubbock and weakened markedly, with the swaths of intense damage caused by the tornado&#x27;s smaller vortices becoming less apparent. One of the light towers at the Jones Stadium on the campus of Texas Tech was destroyed while three others on the stadium&#x27;s eastern side were bent by the tornado&#x27;s winds. The stadium itself sustained light damage; this was the extent of the tornadic damage on the university&#x27;s campus. After the tornado reached the intersection of University Avenue and 4th Street, it looped eastward and intensified, becoming increasingly destructive. Student housing in the Overton area of Lubbock was particularly hard-hit, with the severity of damage requiring demolition of the remaining structures. The University Arms apartments on 5th Street and University Avenue sustained moderately damage. The Arnett Benson subdivision sustained significant damage and roofs were damaged and tree limbs were torn near the Clovis Highway. The Brookshire Inn was seriously damaged.
Industrial buildings were hard-hit by the tornado, including several warehouses. Buildings with large segments of exposed and unsupported roofs suffered greatly, experiencing heavy damage or total destruction. Five of the cylindrical grain bins at the Goodpasture Inc. grain elevator, each covered by thick and steel-reinforced concrete, were blown open by the tornado. Damage to public facilities amounted to roughly $10 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Both the Lubbock Power and Light (LP&amp;L) No. 1 power plant near downtown and the LP&amp;L No. 2 power plant on Municipal Hill were knocked out by the tornado.

After clearing the downtown area, the tornado tracked northeast along U.S. Highway 87. Significant residential damage was concentrated north of 4th Street. Apartment complexes along the northern side of 4th Street near Indiana Avenue were unroofed. The motels on Avenue Q North Drive (the Amarillo Highway) were destroyed, while all motels lining 4th Street and Avenue Q north of 10th street were seriously damaged. The Lubbock City-County Health Department headquarters on Avenue Q were destroyed. A Ramada Inn adjacent to US-87 was directly in the path of the center of the tornado and was bombarded by quickly-moving debris, resulting in loss of the motel&#x27;s brick veneer; the motel&#x27;s carport was lofted northward. At two mobile home parks north of downtown, some homes were blown off of their chassis, overturned, and crushed by the tornado; 80 mobile homes in total were destroyed, with another 30 taking severe damage. It was the second tornado strike in two years for one of the mobile home parks; many of the complex&#x27;s residents took shelter in the basement of a nearby house. The most severe residential damage was wrought in the Guadalupe neighborhood, between Avenues A and Q north of 4th Street, along the northern part of Loop 289, and in the Lubbock Country Club west of the Amarillo Highway. The tornado inflicted considerable damage to homes near the Lubbock Country Club. Some homes disintegrated and others were fully unroofed. Without basements or storm shelters, many residents sought shelter beneath mattresses in their homes. Nearby trees were denuded of their leaves and debris in the area was numerous.

The tornado then tracked across the Lubbock Municipal Airport, damaging hangars and buildings. Aircraft were strewn by the powerful winds across the airport tarmac. Roughly 100 private airplanes were destroyed by the tornado both within and outside the hangars, with another 19 small military aircraft irreparably damaged. The rim of the funnel cloud, at the time measuring between in diameter, came as close as to the Lubbock WBO, with the office&#x27;s anomemometer registering a peak gust of .

==Aftermath==
Twenty-six people were killed in the tornado or died due to injuries received during the storm.

Hospitals turned away people with minor injuries due to the sheer number of casualties inflicted by the tornado. With its water pumps rendered inoperable, the city relied on external sources of water including the Pearl Brewing Company in San Antonio. After the storm, Mayor Jim Granberry imposed a curfew, and Police Chief J.T. Alley issued orders that looters would be shot on sight. No looting was reported throughout the ordeal. The city council was directed to lead the rebuilding process, which continued under Granberry&#x27;s successor, Morris W. Turner. The Lubbock Tornado also served as a model for the development of the Fujita scale, developed a year later. Bud Andrews and Ernesto Barton, Lubbock radio broadcasters, were given Presidential Citations from then U.S. President Richard M. Nixon for coverage of the disaster.

Despite the destruction wrought by the tornado, the recovery effort revitalized the stagnating Lubbock economy and helped to bring about a period of sustained economic and physical growth. Numerous buildings throughout Lubbock were damaged beyond repair and were demolished after the tornado. This included the northwestern section of downtown, whose demolition made way for the construction of the Lubbock Memorial Civic Center and the George and Helen Mahon Public Library; civic leaders had lobbied for a civic center and other public development of downtown in years prior and used the redevelopment of downtown to make these visions a reality. New hotels and restaurants were constructed along the largely devastated east side of Avenue Q. The residents of the predominantly Hispanic neighborhood of Guadalupe moved to primarily the southern and western portions of Lubbock. The Lubbock Urban Renewal Agency rebuilt the largely destroyed Guadalupe neighborhood, though progress was slow for many years before substantial reconstruction occurred.

The damage path of the Lubbock tornado was the subject of a detailed mapping carried out by Ted Fujita. Researcher Thomas P. Grazulis described this mapping as the &quot;most detailed mapping ever done, up to that time, of the path of a single tornado,&quot; becoming a seminal work in understanding the relationship between tornado subvortices and extreme damage. The degrees of damage wrought by the tornado also became the basis for the six tiers of the Fujita tornado scale, which served as the standard for classifying tornadoes until it was superseded by the Enhanced Fujita Scale in 2007.
Fifty years after the disaster, a The Lubbock Tornado Memorial Gateway Park was opened at Ave Q and Glenna Goodacre Blvd in downtown Lubbock: a spot along the destructive path of the larger tornado.The memorial includes two flowing black granite-clad walls representing the two paths of the tornadoes. There are also artistically bent street lights representing the power of the tornadoes, and one relic from the destruction: a snapped-off utility pole. The walls are engraved with timelines of the tornado events, a map of the destructive paths overlaid on a street map of the city at the time, and location references on the map indexed to the individual names and ages of the 26 victims who died as a result of the second tornado. There are also quotes from survivors and other details.

<text>The Waverley Cemetery is a heritage-listed cemetery on top of the cliffs at Bronte in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Opened in 1877 and built by R. Watkins (cemetery lodge, 1878) and P. Beddie (cemetery office, 1915), the cemetery is noted for its largely intact Victorian and Edwardian monuments. It is regularly cited as being one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world. The cemetery contains the graves of many significant Australians including the poet Henry Lawson. Also known as General Cemetery Waverley, it was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 October 2016.

The cemetery is owned by Waverley Council and is self-funded, deriving its income from interments – including burial, cremation, memorials and mausolea – of which there has been over 86,000. Waverley Cemetery was used during the filming of the 1979 Mel Gibson film &quot;Tim&quot; and in 2021 the film &quot; Long Story Short&quot;. The cemetery was designed to function along similar lines to Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

Funerals are conducted Monday to Saturday.

== History ==
===Indigenous history===
The land on which Waverley Cemetery is located is traditionally the land of the Cadigal people of the Eora nation. As with most Aboriginal groups in Australia prior to European colonisation, the Cadigal people lived a traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle that utilised the natural resources available in their environment to achieve the physical and spiritual nourishment to sustain their way of life. Evidence of the areas occupation by the Cadigal people is demonstrated in both archaeological (rock shelters, art sites, middens) and non-archaeological forms (creation sites, ceremonial places). Today, the Waverley area is a densely populated and urban environment and, although Waverley Cemetery is not known to contain identified Aboriginal sites (to date), its cliff top environment is regarded as archaeologically sensitive as it is considered likely to contain sites of Aboriginal significance.

===Colonial history===
European exploration into the coastal region of eastern Sydney commenced in the early 19th century when the establishment of a military outpost at South Head and the completion of the first roadway to the South Head Lighthouse (1811) gave settlers their first cursory view of the coastal landscape of the new colony. The opening up of the region soon saw the allocation of early land grants to prominent settlers in the locality.

In the early years of the colony, the first cemetery (although never formally gazetted) was established on the outskirts of the town on the site of today&#x27;s Sydney Town Hall. At the time of its selection and development in the 1790s, the Old Sydney Burial Ground reflected the attitudes of the European colonists of the period towards death and burial – essentially relegating cemeteries to the periphery of the colony out of fear of ill-health, disease and contamination from the dead. At this time, cemeteries were a necessity and not a place of remembrance and commemoration.

By 1820, the Old Sydney Burial Ground was considered full and a new cemetery was laid out at Devonshire Street (Brickfield Hill), today&#x27;s Sydney&#x27;s Central railway station. Soon enough, by the middle of the century, this cemetery too was at capacity and an alternative location for the Sydney Necropolis was sought. In keeping with common social values, Haslem&#x27;s Creek (now Rookwood Cemetery) was selected as the new location in 1862. Sited on the outskirts of both the Sydney and Parramatta settlements, Haslem&#x27;s Creek was also served by the main western railway line. The relocation of burial services away from central Sydney soon caused difficulties for those living along the eastern coastline and those residents quickly became reliant on St. Jude&#x27;s Anglican Church, Randwick (1853). Although a cemetery was planned from the 1840s, interments did not take place at South Head General Cemetery until 1869.

Waverley Municipal Council, itself only proclaimed in 1859, soon recognised that a general cemetery was needed to service the developing community of the eastern suburbs and, in 1868, reserved A£1,200 to purchase for the establishment of the cemetery. Although the selected land remained on the periphery of the community, social attitudes towards death and burial had shifted by this time, away from those held during the early years of the colony. Society now desired picturesque, garden-like spaces where people could visit, remember and commemorate those who had passed. Cemeteries were no longer to be dark and forbidding places, avoided out of fear and paranoia. Following the purchase of a further , Waverley Cemetery was formally opened on 1 August 1877 and its first interment (of Ruth Allen, 85 years), took place on the afternoon of 4 August 1877. From its first intimations, Waverley Cemetery was to be a grand metropolitan cemetery honouring the high moral standard and respect of the Victorian era and it would reflect the social prosperity of the Waverley community.

To manage the operation of the new facility, William Thomas was appointed as the first manager of Waverley Cemetery in 1877. Responsible for its day-to-day operation, Thomas conducted the development of the cemetery in accordance with a strict set of bylaws that governed its objectives with particular regard to style, layout and colours of headstones, grave sites and funerary furniture.

Laid out professionally as a cemetery of the Victorian style and with its recurring use of ethereally white Italian Carrara marble, Waverley Cemetery soon resembled a strategic collection of individual memorials that portrayed a cohesive and unified visual character. Perhaps because of this visually pleasing effect when coupled with its dramatic natural setting, the cemetery proved to be highly popular with the community and its establishment costs were recovered entirely within the first year.

In the years following its establishment and with the extension of the steam tramway to the site in 1890, Waverley Cemetery expanded with the acquisition of a further of land and by 1894 the cemetery had grown to its present size of bounded by Trafalgar, Boundary and St Thomas streets. It also saw the construction of a number of built elements on the site including the Caretaker&#x27;s House, Cemetery Lodge, Waiting Room, Cemetery Gates, shelters, external fencing, sandstone walling and grounds terracing.

Commenced in 1898 and completed by 1901, a substantial memorial to the 1798 Irish Rebellion was constructed at the cemetery. A large and imposing monument of white Carrara marble, intricately decorated with sculptures, plaques, inscriptions, medallions and mosaic and topped with a 30-foot carved cross, the monument was to be a testament to Ireland&#x27;s struggle for self-government and its patriots who fought in the rebellion. Designed by John Hennessy of architectural firm Sherrin and Hennessy, the memorial is the largest monument to the rebellion in the world. Elevating it to a somewhat sacred status, the memorial contains the interred remains of the leader of the revolution movement, Michael Dwyer (d. 1825) and his wife Mary (d.1860). Originally buried at Sydney&#x27;s Sandhills Cemetery (the site of today&#x27;s Central railway station), the Dwyers were exhumed and reinterred at Waverley Cemetery in 1898. Attended by some 100,000 people, the relocation and interment of the Dwyers was the largest gathering of any 1798 rebellion centenary event in the world.

Waverley Cemetery continued to expand throughout the 20th century, both in numbers and architectural diversity. The grand Victorian era of its establishment slowly morphed into the humbler Edwardian times which saw the introduction of cremation services to the cemetery. Its ongoing use also saw the installation of a substantial collection of funerary monuments that ranged in fashion and style, reflecting the cultural diversity and social values of the people of NSW.

The Great Depression and the world wars bought further change to the cemetery and to the monuments and memorials that were being installed.

Over its lifetime, Waverley Cemetery has received numerous high-achieving, famous and notable people from across NSW, Australia and the world, including: Henry Lawson (writer and poet); Henry Kendall (poet); Dorothea Mackellar (poet); Jules François Archibald (journalist and benefactor of the Archibald Prize); Sir Frances Forbes (first Chief Justice of NSW); Sarah &quot;Fanny&quot; Durack (Olympic gold medal swimmer); William Dymock (book retailer); Nicholas Weekes (prominent freemason); John Fingleton OBE (Australian Cricketer and &quot;Bodyline&quot; veteran) and Lawrence Hargrave (aviator and inventor).

Waverley Cemetery continues to be an operational burial facility today (2015). Its naturally picturesque and urban location has made it a particularly sought after and desirable cemetery and it now contains more than 100,000 burials and interments.

Major coastal storms over a weekend in June 2016 led to the collapse of some 77,000m2 of fill in the gully in the centre of the cemetery. The Bondi-to-Bronte coastal walk through the cemetery was closed but has reopened, but the original route hugging the cliff face has been changed for safety concerns.

Environment &amp; Heritage Minister Mark Speakman announced on 23 October 2016 the State Heritage Register listing of Waverley Cemetery. &quot;Waverley Cemetery is the final resting place of many prominent Australians, Mr Speakman said. &quot; Poets Henry Lawson and Dorothea Mackellar...Olympic gold medal swimmer Sarah &quot;Fanny&quot; Durack and cricket batsman Victor Trumper are all buried in Waverley&#x27;. Member for Coogee Bruce Notley-Smith said the heritage listing would be warmly received by the eastern suburbs community.

In April 2017 the 1922 Sir Charles Wade memorial was restored with grant funding from the NSW government, and Waverley Council secured a community war memorial fund grant to do a conservation assessment of the 1894 Middle Head Submarine Mine Explosion Monument.

== Description ==

Waverley Cemetery is uniquely positioned on an elevated urban site overlooking the Tasman Sea to the east and the Waverley townscape to the west. Spanning some 16 hectares, Waverley Cemetery retains much of its Victorian layout and geometric grid-like pattern of burials (north–south axis).

Despite its suburban environment, Waverley Cemetery is dominated by its cliff top location and its expansive views to the ocean and horizon. The contrast of the natural and man-made elements combine to create a picturesque setting for the cemetery.

Containing over 90,000 burials and interments, Waverley Cemetery is dominated by white marble monuments and headstones from the mid-to-late 19th century as well as a selection of later funerary furniture that demonstrate the changing social values and attitudes towards death it has experienced during its operation (1877 to present). The cemetery also contains various additions to older elements for example the Circle Garden containing interment of ashes created in a former garden area.

Inside its boundaries, the cemetery forms its own enclosed townscape where, apart from the ocean view to the east, all other major views are within the cemetery itself across its own landscape and monuments. This occurs because the cemetery occupies a valley and two adjacent ridges. Major monuments and memorials within Waverley Cemetery are situated at key points such as at the junction of main roads and pathways and other key vantage points at the edge of cemetery sections. Major monuments prominent in the landscape include the 1798 Memorial; the Governor Duff monument; the Henry Kendall monument; the Johnston family vault; the Greek Revival monument to Sir James Martin; and the Chowder Bay Monument.

The 1798 Memorial has a central theme of martyrdom. The architect&#x27;s brief called for &quot;a monument in Irish architecture&quot; to the memory of the 1798 rebels. The design was on an imposing scale calculated to make a strong impact. The design was also heavily influenced by the chairman of the organising committee Dr Charles MacCarthy (1848–1919), who was an award-winning sculptor, painter, musician and writer. The base of the memorial is wide and deep. The back wall rises above the ground and the height of the cross is . The main material is Carrara marble. The rear wall is decorated with bronze plaques and the floor has mosaic pictures of thatched cottages and round towers. Commemorations are conducted inside the memorial which effectively forms a &quot;church sanctuary&quot; or stage while onlookers gather on the surrounding driveways and paths. The monument was erected by Ross and Bowman (stonemasons). The memorial is located in the centre of Waverley Cemetery, facing north at the end of a main driveway.

Another individual monument of significance is the Stuart family vault. Dating from 1914 to 1916 this is a surviving work from the partnership of Walter Burley Griffin, Marion Mahony Griffin and J. Burcham Clamp. James Stuart was the founding partner of Stuart Brothers, master builders. The tomb is situated on a prominent junction at the terminal point of two large retaining walls. Built of granite the vault features gothic detailing with a pyramindal roof form built from slabs of stone. Twin doors in heavy bronze face the ocean on the eastern side of the vault. These are cast with a prismatic pattern that at head height forms a double set of diamond shaped vents. The doors are flanked by polished granite tablets with gilded inscriptions to the memory of members of the Stuart family. Other detailing includes buttresses with lancet tracery and more prismatic patterning around the cornice of the vault. There is a granite urn near the entry doors. On the western wall a round ended cross is formed by the intersection of four granite blocks, which also provides ventilation for the vault.

Waverley Cemetery contains a number of early buildings, independent structures and built elements. The cemetery office, residence and amenities building are located at the entrance of the cemetery while a number of shelters are within the cemetery itself. The cemetery also contains substantial sandstone retaining walls and terracing, pathways, and remnants of sandstone road kerbing and guttering. The cemetery also retains key landscape elements including mature Norfolk Island Pines on the boundaries, Canary Island Date Palms within the cemetery and numerous remnant historic shrubs and grave plantings and more recently established garden areas.

=== Condition ===

As at 13 April 2015, historically a self-sustaining facility, funded entirely by the sale of grave plots and interments, Waverley Cemetery is in reasonable condition due to the past allocation of funds towards maintenance over the lifetime of the cemetery. In recent years, some areas of the cemetery have deteriorated. The cemetery is susceptible to damaging forces. As well as human vandalism and general age-related deterioration, the cemetery is also particularly vulnerable to environmentally-caused salt corrosion (metalwork), wind erosion (masonry) and algae and lichen growth on the headstones. Maintenance of individual grave plots is the responsibility of the family of the deceased and therefore some plots are in a more degraded condition than others.

Dominated by white Carrara marble monuments of the mid-to-late 19th century, alternative materials have been introduced to Waverley Cemetery during its operation. Coloured granite (predominantly black and rose), however sparingly used, does detract from the Victorian nature of the site.

==Historical significance==


Waverley Cemetery contains the graves of many people who shaped Australia. This includes literary figures such as Henry Lawson, (one of Australia&#x27;s most famous poets), Jules Archibald, founder of &quot;The Bulletin&quot; and benefactor of the Archibald Prize, nineteenth century writer Louis Becke, nineteenth century Australian boxing champion Larry Foley, nineteenth century poet Henry Kendall, the American actor William E. Sheridan, poet and author Dorothea Mackellar, and author Ethel Pedley. Other significant figures include aeronautical pioneer Lawrence Hargrave, Olympic swimmer Fanny Durack, and New South Wales Premier Sir James Martin, (whose remains were transferred to Waverley Cemetery after the death of his wife in 1909).

The cemetery contains over 200 war graves from various past conflicts, of which there are 132 registered and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (over 100 from World War I and nearly 20 from World War II). The front gates are a memorial to the residents of the area who died during World War I and World War II . Inside the main gates is a memorial to the military forces of NSW which houses the remains of several officers killed in an 1891 sea mine explosion at Middle Head. At least eleven United States Civil War veterans are also buried at Waverley, including Phineas S. Thompson. In addition, the cemetery is home to the Irish memorial, the final resting place of Michael Dwyer (1798 Rebellion), and a memorial to all those who died in that rebellion. There is also a memorial stone commemorating the 1981 Hunger Strikers. As well as nationally famous figures the cemetery contains the graves of notable Sydney identities including Robert (&#x27;Nosey Bob&#x27;) Howard, the state executioner who served until 1904, rugby player Peter Burge and Sydney crime figure George Freeman.

Architecturally, Waverley Cemetery is significant in that it showcases examples of Stonemasonry and funerary art dating back from the 19th century, with features (such as the gates, buildings and fencing) that due to their intact nature are considered of &quot;outstanding aesthetic value&quot;. Included in this is a tomb designed for James Stuart and his family by the architects J. Burcham Clamp and Walter Burley Griffin.

== Heritage listing ==
Waverley Cemetery is listed as a heritage item in the Waverley Council Local Environment Plan. In 2015 local resident action group Residents for Waverley Cemetery nominated the cemetery for inclusion on the State Heritage Register. The nomination was recommended by the Heritage Council and after receiving Ministerial approval was gazetted on 28 October 2016. In 2016 Waverley Council nominated Waverley Cemetery for inclusion on the National Heritage list.

As at 13 August 2015, Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance as a general public Victorian-era cemetery that is the final resting place for more than 100,000 people. Sited in an urban setting, against a dramatic natural landscape of the Pacific Ocean with its steep cliffs and the endless horizon, Waverley Cemetery is a picturesque urban burial ground that contains a collection of highly intact funerary monuments and furniture dating from 1877.

Its earliest elements demonstrate the moral standards and religious philosophies of the Australian community in the Victorian period and, through the continuity of the cemetery&#x27;s use to the present day and the gradual introduction of alternative funerary designs and interment practices throughout the years, the cemetery demonstrates the cultural diversity and changing social values and attitudes of the Australian people towards death and its commemoration over some 140 years. The aesthetic continuity of Waverley Cemetery is largely due to the strict management of the cemetery in the early periods of its development.

Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its association with a number of high-achieving, famous and notable people from across NSW, Australia and the world. Some of its most famous names include Henry Lawson (writer and poet); Dorothea Mackellar (poet); Jules Francoise Archibald (journalist and benefactor of the Archibald art prize); Sir James Martin (NSW Premier); Sarah &quot;Fanny&quot; Durack (Olympic gold medal swimmer); members of the Cavill family of famous swimmers – Arthur, Charles, Ernest and Frederick Cavill; William Dymock (book retailer); Victor Trumper (batsman from the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of cricket); Lawrence Hargrave (aviator and inventor); Nicholas Weekes (prominent freemason); and Michael Dwyer (revolutionary leader of the 1798 Irish Rebellion).

As an operational general public cemetery, Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its demonstration of the historic and contemporary social character of Sydney and NSW. Waverley Cemetery contains a wealth of genealogical, historical, architectural and artistic information which makes it a significant public educational resource for NSW.

Internationally, the Waverley Cemetery has been reported to be one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world – among the likes of England&#x27;s Highgate Cemetery and Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

Waverley Cemetery was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 October 2016 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance as a general public Victorian-era cemetery that is the final resting place for more than 100,000 people.

Opened in 1877, in the picturesque cemetery design of the mid-to-late 19th century, the geometric layout and early funerary monuments of Waverley Cemetery demonstrate the moral standards and religious philosophies of the Australian community in the Victorian period. Through the continuity of the cemetery&#x27;s use to the present day, and the gradual introduction of alternative funerary designs and interment practices throughout the years, the cemetery demonstrates the cultural diversity and changing social values and attitudes of the Australian people towards death and its commemoration over some 140 years.

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales&#x27;s history.

Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its association with a number of high-achieving, famous and notable people from across NSW, Australia and the world. Operating for over a century and the final resting place for over 100,000 people, Waverley Cemetery has buried and interred a diverse selection of notable people from literary, business, arts, political and sporting backgrounds.

Some of its most famous names include Henry Lawson (writer and poet); Henry Kendall (poet); Dorothea Mackellar (poet); Jules Francoise Archibald (journalist and benefactor of the Archibald art prize); Sir Frances Forbes (first Chief Justice of NSW); Sir James Martin (NSW Premier); Sarah &quot;Fanny&quot; Durack (Olympic gold medal swimmer); members of the Cavill family of famous swimmers – Arthur, Charles, Ernest and Frederick Cavill; William Dymock (book retailer); Victor Trumper (batsman from the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of cricket); John Fingleton OBE (Australian Cricketer and &quot;Bodyline&quot; veteran); Nicholas Weekes (prominent freemason); Lawrence Hargrave (aviator and inventor) and George Freeman (Sydney organised crime figure).

Waverley Cemetery contains over 200 various war graves from past conflicts, including over 100 burials from World War I and nearly 20 from World War II. At least eleven United States Civil War veterans are also buried at Waverley Cemetery.

Waverley Cemetery also houses the 1798 Memorial, a commemorative monument to those &quot;Who dared and suffered for Ireland&quot; in the rebellion led by the United Irishmen of 1798. This memorial is also final resting place of Michael Dwyer, &quot;The Wicklow Chief&quot; a revolutionary leader of the 1798 Irish Rebellion who died in Sydney in 1825. The remains of Michael Dwyer and his wife were moved from the Devonshire Street Cemetery to Waverley Cemetery in 1898 (the centenary of the 1798 Rebellion). The 1798 Memorial commemorates subsequent events such as the Easter Rising of 1916 and the Long Kesh Hunger Strikes of 1981 (additional tablet at rear).

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its aesthetic values.

Sited in an urban setting, against a dramatic natural landscape of the Pacific Ocean with its steep cliffs and the endless horizon, Waverley Cemetery is a picturesque urban burial ground that contains a collection of highly intact funerary monuments and grave furniture of a refined palette (marble and stone) which demonstrates a comprehensive range of Victorian and Edwardian artistic elements. Many monuments feature statuary such as angels, cherubs, seraphs, mourning figures and occasional portrait medallions or busts; substantial pedestals topped with urns or spires; and Christian crosses. Smaller monuments such as stone desks often include carved decorations using floral relief, birds, crowns, and other symbolism. There is a consistent palette of materials throughout the site which is dominated by sandstone and white marble with inlaid lead lettering – granite, trachyte and other materials are less prominent.

Inside its boundaries, the cemetery forms its own enclosed townscape where, apart from the ocean view to the east, all other major views are within the cemetery itself across its own landscape and monuments. The cemetery retains a nineteenth century layout with many roadways still lined with sandstone kerbs, gutters and drains.

The architecture and design of much of its earlier elements from the Victorian period reflect the social attitudes towards death and commemoration at the time of its construction. However the ongoing use and expansion of the cemetery has seen the gradual introduction of alternative funerary styles and fashions that reflect the cultural diversity and evolution of the people of NSW over time.

Waverley Cemetery includes an unusual suite of cemetery structures including the main entry gates with iron palisade fence and sandstone pillars; the nearby sandstone office and waiting room building with associated residence and amenities buildings and a series of shelter sheds and sandstone retaining walls throughout the site. The cemetery also retains key landscape elements including mature Norfolk Island Pines on the boundaries, Canary Island Date Palms within the cemetery and numerous remnant historic shrubs and grave plantings.

Major monuments and memorials within Waverley Cemetery are situated at key points such as at the junction of main roads and pathways and other key vantage points at the edge of cemetery sections. This makes these major monuments prominent items in the landscape when within the cemetery. Examples include the Irish Martyrs&#x27; Memorial; the Governor Duff monument; the Henry Kendall monument; the Johnston family vault; the Greek Revival monument to Sir James Martin; and the Chowder Bay Monument.

Internationally, the Waverley Cemetery has been reported to be one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world – among the likes of England&#x27;s Highgate Cemetery and Paris&#x27;s Pere Lachaise Cemetery.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

As an operational general public cemetery, Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its demonstration of the historic and contemporary social character of Sydney and NSW. The fabric of the cemetery reflects the cultural and religious diversity of the Australian community since 1877 and its contemporary social significance is increased by its public accessibility and use by residents and visitors by virtue of its central metropolitan location.

Prominent individuals and families are buried or interred at the cemetery and, as a genealogical resource, Waverley Cemetery is a significant educational asset for NSW.

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its educational and research potential. With its wealth of genealogical, historical, architectural and artistic information, Waverley Cemetery is a significant and readily accessible resource that is available to much of the NSW population by virtue of its central metropolitan location.

The craftsmanship of the funerary monuments, demonstrated by rich examples from the Victorian, Edwardian and Inter-War eras, reflects social values and attitudes towards death and mourning in NSW since 1877. Furthermore, the array of funerary ornamentation demonstrates the changes in social fashions and taste over the decades and serve to reflect the impact of many international events on the activities of people in NSW (such as the Depression and the world wars).

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Cemeteries of the same historical period are generally similar in layout, style and purpose but Waverley Cemetery is a notable example in NSW for its distinctive and picturesque setting on the Bronte cliff tops. The siting makes the cemetery both a place of remembrance as well as a passive recreational facility as part of the popular and well-known coastal walk from Bondi to the popular beaches of Bronte, Clovelly and Coogee.

Once sited on the periphery of the Sydney colony, the retention of Waverley Cemetery in its now urban and desirable setting has seen the cemetery become a strikingly significant and intact open space in metropolitan Sydney.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

Waverley Cemetery is of state heritage significance as a representative example of a burial ground that can demonstrate the principle characteristics of a general public cemetery from the Victorian period in NSW. The geometric layout and early funerary monuments of the Waverley Cemetery reflect the social values and attitudes of the Australian community towards death and commemoration in the mid-to-late 19th century.

The ongoing operation of the cemetery and the gradual introduction of different styles and funerary fashions can also demonstrate the changing attitudes of the community towards funerary practices in NSW over time.

==Operation==

The cemetery after more than 130 years of operation remains an entirely self-funded business. It has never been funded by the public purse or council ratepayers, with individual graves maintained for a fee. Where families no longer wish to maintain their ancestor&#x27;s graves this has led to some significant memorials (such as those belonging to Jules Archibald and Victor Trumper) falling into disrepair. In 2002, the Waverley Council as owners of the business looked for alternative sources of revenue. These included corporate and private sponsorship for grave sites, and a proposed crematorium. This sponsorship plan met with limited success, although some graves have been restored with the assistance of sponsors – including Jules Archibald&#x27;s (by &quot;The Bulletin&quot;), Lawrence Hargrave&#x27;s through the Royal Aeronautical Society, and the grave of Henry Lawson which was restored through a $10,000 grant by the State government. The plan to incorporate an on-site cremation into the existing business encountered vocal opposition, including by Liberal Party MP Malcolm Turnbull, the Federal Member for Wentworth, who spoke in Federal Parliament against the plan. The community opposition led to the plan being cancelled in 2004. A two million dollar boardwalk designed to move joggers and others passersby away from the graves is now a popular part of the Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk.

In late 2007, the National Trust ran an online competition to determine the distribution of $185,000 in funding. Of the nine finalists, the Waverley Cemetery&#x27;s ceremonial gates proved to be the most popular, winning the majority of the votes. Unfortunately, the amount voted to the project was only a little over 25% of the total restoration costs. Waverley Council has committed to funding the balance and work on this project is commencing in 2016.

==Cultural influences==

The earliest known motion picture filmed at the cemetery was the 1977 Italian production &#x27;La Ragazza dal pigiama giallo&#x27;, also known as &#x27;The Pyjama Girl Case&#x27;, a murder story based on the true story of Linda Agostini, the Pyjama Girl. In 1972 the cemetery was featured in filming for Spyforce where Colonel Cato played by Redmond Phillips was supposedly buried. In 1978 the cemetery was a location in filming of the movie Newsfront starring Bill Hunter and Bryan Brown. In 1979 the cemetery was a location in filming of the movie &quot;Tim&quot; starring Mel Gibson. &quot;Baywatch&quot; used the cemetery while filming its Australian movie length episode, and the Australian soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot; buried one of their characters at Waverley in 2004. In 1996, scenes from the season one final of Australian TV show &quot;Water Rats&quot; were filmed at the cemetery. Notable recent films include &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot;. It was also pictured in the Bollywood Blockbuster &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot; in a musical sequence.

The cemetery has been a place of inspiration for many artists, Henry Lawson who ultimately ended up there was fond of using the location in his stories, either as direct reference or indirectly. 

==South Head Cemetery==

South Head Cemetery is situated at the junction of New South Head Road and Old South Head Road, Vaucluse. It is administered by Waverley Council and is a companion cemetery to Waverley Cemetery.

The cemetery was established to cater for the needs of the population in the growing Vaucluse area; its first interment was in 1868. It was run for some time by a private trust, but management was transferred to Waverley Council in 1941. It covers an expanse of and contains the graves of 6,000 people as of 2008. South Head General Cemetery contains the graves of many notable people, including: Australia&#x27;s first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton (1920); NSW Governors Sir Walter Davidson (1923) and Sir Roden Cutler (2002); NSW Premiers Sir John Robertson (1891), Sir William Lyne (1913), Sir Charles Wade (1922) and Sir Joseph Carruthers (1932); Queensland Premier and Federal Treasurer &quot;Red Ted&quot; Theodore (1950); members of the Packer, Fairfax and Norton newspaper dynasties; members of the Street family legal dynasty including two Chief Justices, Sir Philip Whistler Street (1938) and Sir Kenneth Whistler Street (1972); Anglican Archbishop of Sydney John Charles Wright (1933); the Foy retailing family (including a monument to the disappeared Foy heiress Juanita Nielsen); architects Mortimer Lewis (1879), Thomas Rowe (1899), John Horbury Hunt (1904), Robin Dods (1920), Howard Joseland (1930), John Burcham Clamp (1931) and Neville Gruzman (2005); artist George Washington Lambert (1930); writers Jack Moses (1945) and Frank Clune (1971); entertainer Gladys Moncrieff (1976) and founder of the acting dynasty Roy Redgrave (1922); cricketer Warwick Armstrong; and Edmund Resch junior of the Resch&#x27;s brewing family (1963).

The cemetery contains the graves of 22 of the 40 victims of the 1927 &quot;Greycliffe&quot; ferry disaster. There are also Commonwealth war graves of 18 Australian service personnel, 5 of World War I and 13 of World War II, in various parts of the cemetery.

<doc id="593629" wikidata="Q4589662" url="?curid=593629" title="1994 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak">
<text>The 1994 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak was the third notable US tornado outbreak to occur on Palm Sunday and the second to take place in the Southeastern United States. The outbreak produced 29 tornadoes from Texas to North Carolina, killing 40 people and injuring 491, and causing $140 million in damage. The deadliest storm of the outbreak, as well as in the US in 1994, was an F4 tornado that devastated Piedmont, Alabama. It struck the Goshen United Methodist Church right in the middle of the Palm Sunday service, collapsing the roof on the congregation and killing 20 people inside, including the Rev. Kelly Clem&#x27;s 4-year-old daughter Hannah. Two other houses of worship were also destroyed mid-service. The supercell that formed this tornado tracked for to South Carolina.

== Meteorological synopsis ==
The SPC started forecasting the outbreak on March 26, highlighting the risk of severe thunderstorms over the area that would eventually be impacted. They issued a &quot;severe&quot; forecast for most of the Southern, and some of the Mid-Atlantic states, forecasting &quot;the potential for supercell storms, along with the possibility of tornadoes.&quot;

By the morning of March 27, it was apparent that a very strong and potent airmass had set up over the Gulf states, with the SPC issuing a moderate risk for most of Alabama, the southern half of Mississippi, and most of Louisiana in their morning outlook. The 6 AM CST (1200 UTC) 500 MB analysis showed a strong southwest flow of near 80 knots over the Southern U.S., while at the 850 MB level, there existed winds of near 50 knots coming out of the state of Louisiana. At the surface, temperatures in Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia were in the low 70&#x27;s Fahrenheit, with dewpoints were in the upper 60&#x27;s to low 70&#x27;s. CAPE values at Centreville, Alabama were nearing 1,200 j/kg with no cap to speak of. A surface front left by rain during the previous evening was situated over northern parts of Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia.

By 9 AM CST (1500 UTC), thunderstorms and severe weather were not only occurring along the boundary setup by the rain from the previous evening in the northern portions of Alabama and Mississippi, but further to the south as well. At 9:18 AM CST (1518 UTC), the SPC issued a tornado watch for Eastern Mississippi and Northern Alabama. The storms then rapidly intensified, with tornado warnings being issued by the Birmingham and Huntsville NWS offices before 11 AM local time. Both the deadly F4 tornado that struck the Goshen United Methodist Church in Cherokee County and the Marshall County F2 twister formed at about this time. The SPC also issued a PDS Tornado Watch for all of Northern Georgia by 12 PM EST (1700 UTC), with the wording stating, &quot;This is a particularly dangerous situation with the possibility of very damaging tornadoes. Also, large hail, dangerous lightning and damaging thunderstorm winds can be expected.&quot; Severe storms and tornadoes tracked into the northern Georgia region by 12:42 EST, and tornadoes continued to track across northern Georgia during the afternoon.

During the early-mid afternoon, analysis showed a very unstable airmass over the southern U.S., with CAPE values near 2,500 j/kg and SRH values of near 250 m2/s2 at Jackson, Mississippi. The 1800 UTC Centreville, Alabama sounding showed similar conditions, with CAPE over 2,500 j/kg and SRH values of over 500 m2/s2. This resulted in an Energy Helicity Index (EHI) value of 8.49, which is strongly supportive of tornadic thunderstorms. Based on these soundings, the SPC issued a High Risk for their 1930 UTC outlook, noting a rapidly destabilized atmosphere and winds being much stronger than what was originally forecasted. Noting the presence of a shortwave trough that was tracking into Mississippi and Louisiana as well as rapidly falling pressures in advance of a frontal boundary, the SPC issued a tornado watch for eastern Louisiana and central Mississippi, however, there were no reported tornadoes in this region on March 27. The SPC, seeing that storms were tracking into the Carolinas, issued a tornado watch for portions of the western and central Carolinas, as well as the portion of northeast Georgia not already included in the prior tornado watch. Tornadoes continued to track along this area from the mid-late afternoon, with an F3 tornado striking parts of northeast Georgia and the upstate of South Carolina, injuring 12, and another tornado along the border region of North Carolina and South Carolina injuring 13.

In Alabama, tornadoes continued in the central part of the state during the mid-late afternoon. An F1 tornado struck parts of Tuscaloosa County just after 4 PM. Funnel clouds were seen in Hueytown as a storm went over Jefferson County at around 4:30 PM local time. An F2 tornado was produced in Shelby County at 5:30 CST, damaging a high school and a residential neighborhood before destroying two mobile home parks.

During the cleanup from the F4 tornado that struck Cherokee County, emergency responders had to take cover as another funnel cloud was spotted just before 6 PM CST. The storms also produced hail up to in diameter and winds around . The storm system also left behind extensive flooding in Winston and Walker Counties, with $150,000 worth of damage done to roads and bridges in Walker County. The final tornado of the outbreak was reported just before midnight in Greenville County in South Carolina. The National Weather Service offices in Birmingham, Atlanta, and Athens did not stop issuing warnings until late at night on the 27th or early in the morning on the 28th, issuing 75 tornado warnings and 182 severe weather products overall.

Overall, the outbreak of March 27, 1994 was not as synoptically evident as some of the past outbreaks that have occurred, as there was no deep surface low or trough present for forcing in the area where the storms occurred, and many of the ingredients necessary that were the cause of this outbreak were not able to be forecasted until the morning of the event.

== Confirmed tornadoes ==
=== March 27 event ===

===Ragland - Piedmont - Rock Run, Alabama ===

The first violent and the deadliest tornado of the outbreak developed south-southwest of Ragland in St. Clair County, Alabama, at 10:55 a.m. CST. With a forward speed, the tornado first destroyed buildings east of Ragland before killing a woman on a campground west of Neely Henry Lake. Just prior to entering Calhoun County, the tornado destroyed 18 homes and 20 mobile homes. Upon crossing the north side of Ohatchee the tornado threw a van into a ditch, killing a man inside and injuring three other occupants. After causing the death on U.S. Route 431, it passed through sparsely-populated, wooded land about west-northwest of Piedmont. As it passed north of Piedmont, the tornado struck the Goshen United Methodist Church in the former community of Goshen, killing 20 people in the church and injuring 92; some sources say 90 were injured. The tornado also destroyed two nearby churches, but killed no one in their congregations. Parishioners in the Goshen United Methodist Church apparently received no warning while attending services and some were crushed to death as the walls and roof collapsed upon them. An inflow jet caused the south wall—which, being tall and wide, was built solely of masonry block—to collapse inward, so the timber-and-steel gable roof and other walls followed suit, crushing parishioners inside the sanctuary. After striking the church, the tornado continued on and later dissipated northeast of Rock Run, near the Alabama–Georgia state line. Overall, the tornado killed 22 people.
=== Rome–Canton–Jasper, Georgia ===

The second violent tornado of the outbreak developed in a rural area of Floyd County, Georgia, about southeast of Rome, at 1:14 p.m. EST. Upon touching down, the wide tornado uprooted large pines and oaks while causing F0 damage to five or six homes of &quot;mixed brick and wood construction.&quot; The tornado then moved northeast as it snapped trees before intensifying to F1 strength about west of Cartersville. During this, the tornado initially shrunk to wide, but then widened again to as it passed through Cassville, with F1 damage primarily to the roofs of 10–15 homes. The tornado blew down 20 large trees and damaged power lines in Cassville.

Thereafter, the tornado increased greatly in size and intensity as it passed between White and Rydal, with the first and only F4 damage occurring in a rural area northwest of Canton. There, the wide tornado leveled &quot;five two-story brick and wood homes&quot; to the ground in the Indian Springs subdivision. The tornado also severely damaged eight to 10 other homes and slightly damaged 12–15. Overall, the tornado was most destructive at Indian Springs and soon weakened as it continued northeast through wooded lands; however, its path briefly widened. It killed two people in a trailer along Georgia State Route 140 in Bartow County and snapped tall pine trees nearby. Though the wide tornado impacted forested areas, it still caused major damage to 10 mobile homes and six permanent homes, as well as damage to four unspecified vehicles.

Henceforth, the tornado continued to weaken to F2 intensity and contracted to wide as it passed into Pickens County, severely damaging 10–15 chicken coops along with 20–25 homes of brick and wood construction. It killed one more person in a trailer before lifting from the ground about east-southeast of Jasper. Ultimately, it caused almost $7 million (1994 USD) in losses to properties and businesses in Bartow County alone, with another $1.5 million in losses in adjourning Pickens County. The tornado killed three people and over 500,000 chickens along its track and leveled &quot;thousands&quot; of trees, with over $10 million in losses to agricultural interests.
=== Cave Spring/Lindale, Georgia ===

The sixth and final F3+ tornado to hit Georgia on March 27 touched down northwest of Cedartown at about 7:00 p.m. EST. Though mainly impacting rural areas at first, it badly damaged four wood homes and blew down many trees with resultant F1 damage. The tornado appeared reddish to eyewitnesses as it passed through rugged terrain. As it crossed near SR 100, the tornado produced major roof damage to a few homes and destroyed a pair of chicken coops. Widening to wide, the tornado acquired a multiple vortex structure as residents observed two or three funnels rotating around the main vortex. In southern Floyd County, about east of Cave Spring, the multiple-vortex tornado snapped trees in half and badly damaged five double-wide mobile homes along with three or four frail wood homes.

Afterward, the tornado strengthened to F2 intensity, causing more severe damage to wood homes, but soon contracted in size to wide and weakened into an F1 tornado. However, as it neared to within southwest of Lindale, it widened yet again and rapidly strengthened into an F3 tornado as it passed through Leawood Estates. There, it reportedly leveled &quot;fifteen mixed single and two story mixed brick and wood homes of poor construction,&quot; along with some homes that were being built. The tornado caused 30 injuries, including one of a man who was thrown into the street across from his home. Residents reported continuous lightning preceding and during the passage of the tornado and were alerted by their dogs barking. Some residents also reported a smaller tornado south of the primary one.

After hitting Leawood Estates at maximum intensity, the tornado weakened back into an F2 tornado and shrunk to wide as it passed south of Rome. There, it badly damaged three poorly built wood homes, destroyed four mobile homes, and uprooted large trees. Farther along, it decreased in size to just wide but caused significant damage to 15–20 homes of brick and wood construction. As it passed southeast of Rome, the tornado degenerated into an F0 tornado over wooded farmland while causing major roof damage to a few homes before dissipating. According to the National Weather Service, the tornado destroyed 55–60 homes and did at least some damage to 140–150 others, with total losses reaching $6,750,000.
== Effects on National Safety ==

The deaths at Goshen United Methodist Church brought to light the deficiencies in the NOAA Weather Radio network across the United States and the lack of NOAA Weather Radio use in many public spaces. Budget cuts in the 1970s had forced the National Weather Service to cut back on the expansion of new broadcast stations. Most urban and suburban areas in the country had sufficient coverage, but many rural areas had no coverage at all. After a visit to the Goshen site, then Vice President Al Gore pushed for further funding and expansion of the NOAA Weather Radio system, especially in rural areas. This was accomplished through an expansion of private-public partnerships, primarily by the National Weather Service leasing or using donated tower space from entities such as TV stations, public utilities, and state government agencies. Gore, also, pushed for facilities such as schools, hospitals, churches, and nursing homes to have weather radios on hand.

<text>In computer hardware, a CPU socket or CPU slot contains one or more mechanical components providing mechanical and electrical connections between a microprocessor and a printed circuit board (PCB). This allows for placing and replacing the central processing unit (CPU) without soldering.

Common sockets have retention clips that apply a constant force, which must be overcome when a device is inserted. For chips with many pins, zero insertion force (ZIF) sockets are preferred. Common sockets include pin grid array (PGA) or land grid array (LGA). These designs apply a compression force once either a handle (PGA type) or a surface plate (LGA type) is put into place. This provides superior mechanical retention while avoiding the risk of bending pins when inserting the chip into the socket. Certain devices use Ball Grid Array (BGA) sockets, although these require soldering and are generally not considered user replaceable.

CPU sockets are used on the motherboard in desktop and server computers. Because they allow easy swapping of components, they are also used for prototyping new circuits. Laptops typically use surface-mount CPUs, which take up less space on the motherboard than a socketed part.

As the pin density increases in modern sockets, increasing demands are placed on the printed circuit board fabrication technique, which permits the large number of signals to be successfully routed to nearby components. Likewise, within the chip carrier, the wire bonding technology also becomes more demanding with increasing pin counts and pin densities. Each socket technology will have specific reflow soldering requirements. As CPU and memory frequencies increase, above 30 MHz or thereabouts, electrical signalling increasingly shifts to differential signaling over parallel buses, bringing a new set of signal integrity challenges. The evolution of the CPU socket amounts to a coevolution of all these technologies in tandem. 

Modern CPU sockets are almost always designed in conjunction with a heat sink mounting system, or in lower power devices, other thermal considerations.

==Function==
A CPU socket is made of plastic, and often comes with a lever or latch, and with metal contacts for each of the pins or lands on the CPU. Many packages are keyed to ensure the proper insertion of the CPU. CPUs with a PGA (pin grid array) package are inserted into the socket and, if included, the latch is closed. CPUs with an LGA (land grid array) package are inserted into the socket, the latch plate is flipped into position atop the CPU, and the lever is lowered and locked into place, pressing the CPU&#x27;s contacts firmly against the socket&#x27;s lands and ensuring a good connection, as well as increased mechanical stability.

<doc id="593634" wikidata="Q4118628" url="?curid=593634" title="Folklore of India">
<text>The folklore of India encompasses the folklore of the Republic of India and the Indian subcontinent. India is an ethnically and religiously diverse country. Given this diversity, it is difficult to generalize the vast folklore of India as a unit.

Although India is a Hindu-majority country, with more than three-fourths of the population identifying themselves as Hindus, there is no single, unified, and all-pervading concept of identity present in it. Various heterogeneous traditions, numerous regional cultures and different religions to grow and flourish here. Folk religion in Hinduism may explain the rationale behind local religious practices, and contain local myths that explain the customs or rituals. However, folklore goes beyond religious or supernatural beliefs and practices, and encompasses the entire body of social tradition whose chief vehicle of transmission is oral or outside institutional channels.

==Folk art of India==
 The folk and tribal arts of India speak volumes about the country&#x27;s rich heritage. Art forms in India have been exquisite and explicit. Folk art forms include various schools of art like the Mughal School, Rajasthani School, Nakashi art School etc. Each school has its distinct style of colour combinations or figures and its features. Other popular folk art forms include Madhubani paintings &amp; Bhojpuri paintings from Bihar, Kangra painting from Himachal Pradesh and Warli painting from Maharashtra. Tanjore paintings from South India incorporate real gold into their paintings. Local fairs, festivals, deities and heroes (warriors) play a vital role in this art form. In history the arts were made by upper caste but now they are famous worldwide.

Some famous folk and tribal arts of India include:

* Tanjore painting
* Madhubani painting
* Bhojpuri Paintings
* Nirmal paintings
* Warli folk painting
* Pattachitra painting
* Rajasthani miniature painting
* Kalamezhuthu

==Folktales of India==

India possesses a large body of heroic ballads and epic poetry preserved in oral tradition, both in Sanskrit and the various vernacular languages of India. One such oral epic, telling the story of Pabuji, has been collected by Dr. John Smith from Rajasthan; it is a long poem in the Rajasthani language, traditionally told by professional story tellers, known as Bhopas, who deliver it in front of a tapestry that depicts the characters of the story, and functions as a portable temple, accompanied by a &quot;ravanhattho&quot; fiddle. The title character was a historical figure, a Rajput prince, who has been deified in Rajasthan. 

Various performing arts such as Garba and Dandiya Raas of Gujarat, Sambalpuri dance of Odisha, the Chhau, Alkap and Gambhira of West Bengal, Bihu dance of Assam, Ghoomar dance of Rajasthan and Haryanvi, Bhangra and Gidda of Punjab, Dhangar of Goa, Panthi dance of Chhattisgarh, Kummi, and Karagattam of TamilNadu, Kolattam of Andhra Pradesh, Yakshagana of Karnataka, Thirayattam of Kerala and Chang Lo of Nagaland derive their elements from myriads of myths, folktales and seasonal changes.

Noteworthy collections of Indian traditional stories include the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, a collection of traditional narratives made by Vishnu Sarma in the second century BC. The &quot;Hitopadesha&quot; of Narayana is a collection of anthropomorphic fabliaux, animal fables, in Sanskrit, compiled in the ninth century.

Indian folklorists during the last thirty years have substantially contributed to the study of folklore. Devendra Satyarthi, Krishna Dev Upadyhayaya, Prafulla Dutta Goswami, Kunja Bihari Dash, Ashutosh Bhatacharya and many more senior folklorists have contributed for the study of folklore. But it is during the 1970s that some folklorists studied in US universities and trained up themselves with the modern theories and methods of folklore research and set a new trend of folklore study in India. Especially, South Indian universities advocated for folklore as a discipline in the universities and hundreds of scholars trained up on folklore. A.K. Ramanujan was the noted folklorist to analyse folklore from Indian context.

Study of folklore was strengthened by two stremas (sicsic); one is Finnish folklorist Lauri Honko and another is Peter J. Claus of American folklore. These two folklorists conducted their field work on Epic of Siri and led the Indian folklorists to the new folklore study. The Central Institute of Indian Languages has played a major role in promoting folklore studies in India to explore another reality of Indian culture.

Recently scholars such as Chitrasen Pasayat, M. D. Muthukumaraswamy, Vivek Rai, Jawaharlal Handoo, Birendranath Dutta, P. C. Pattanaik, B. Reddy, Sadhana Naithani, P. Subachary, Molly Kaushal, Shyam Sundar Mahapatra, Bhabagrahi Mishra and many new folklorists have contributed in their respective field for shaping folklore study as a strong discipline in representing the people&#x27;s memory and people&#x27;s voice. Recently the National Folklore Support Center in Chennai has taken the initiative to promote folklore in public domain and bridging the gap of academic domain and community domain.

==Indian folk heroes, villains, and tricksters==

Indian folk heroes like Rama, Krishna in Sanskrit epics and history and also in freedom movement are well known to every one. They have found a place in written literature. But in Indian cultural sub-system, Indian folk heroes are most popular. The castes and tribes of India have maintained their diversities of culture through their language and religion and customs. So in addition to national heroes, regional heroes and local folk and tribal heroes are alive in the collective memory of the people. Let&#x27;s take examples of the Santhals or the Gonds. The Santhals have their culture heroes Beer Kherwal and Bidu Chandan. Gonds have their folk hero Chital Singh Chhatti. Banjara folk hero is Lakha Banjara or Raja Isalu.

But not only heroes, the heroines of Indian folklore have also significant contribution in shaping the culture of India. Banjara epics are heroine-centric. These epics reflect the &quot;sati&quot; cult.

Oral epics with heroic actions of heroes and heroines produce a &quot;counter text&quot;, as opposed to the written texts. Therefore, the younger brother becomes hero and kill his elder brother in an oral epic, which is forbidden in classical epics. Folk heroes are some times deified and are worshipped in the village. There is a thin difference of a mythic hero and romantic hero in Indian folklore. In Kalahandi, oral epics are available among the ethnic singers, performed in ritual context and social context. Dr Mahendra Mishra, a folklorist, has conducted research on oral epics in Kalahandi, taking seven ethnic groups. Dr. Chitrasen Pasayat has made an extensive study of different folk and tribal forms of Yatra, like Dhanu yatra, Kandhen-budhi yatra, Chuda-khai yatra, Sulia yatra, Patkhanda yatra, Budha-dangar yatra, Khandabasa yatra, Chhatar yatra, Sital-sasthi yatra and examined the &#x27;hero characters&#x27; of the local deities.

Indian oral epics are found abundantly everywhere there are caste based culture. Prof. Lauri Honko from Turku, Finland with Prof. Vivek Rai and Dr K Chinnapa Gawda have conducted extensive field work and research on Siri Epic and have come out with three volumes on Epic of Siri, not Siri. Similarly Prof. Peter J Claus has done intensive work on Tulu epics. Aditya Mallick on Devnarayan epic, Pulikonda Subbachary on Jambupurana, Dr JD Smith on Pabuji epic are some of the commendable work that have been drawn attention of the wider readership.

In the rural areas of Kerala, there was a practice known as Odiyan (or &quot;odian&quot;) where a group of individuals claimed the ability to terrify people to the point of death using a technique called otiviki. Odiyan is a legendary figure in Kerala folklore, described as half-man, half-beast creatures that would lurk in alleyways during the night. These Odiyans would apply specific herbs to certain parts of their bodies, chant spells, and transform themselves into various animals like bulls, buffaloes, or foxes, depending on their desire. Typically, this practice was associated with the Panan and Paraya communities, although individuals from other communities who possessed the necessary skills could also carry it out.

==Traditional games of India==
India has a long history of board games. You hear about these from the times of the Mahabharata and the Mughal empire. Some of the popular board games that originated from Indian Traditional games include Chess (Chaturanga), Ludo (Pachisi) and Snakes and Ladders (Moksha-Patamu).

Recently, Odisha, a state in eastern India, introduced a child-friendly programme called Srujan (creativity) in the primary schools. About 18 million children took part in four activities like story telling activities, traditional games, traditional art and craft and music and dance and riddles over a period of three years (2007–2010). The result is that while there are hundreds of varieties of folktales, the varieties of traditional games are limited. About three hundred traditional games both indoor and outdoor were commonly played and it was found that the traditional games contain mathematical knowledge (like counting, measurement, shapes and size, geometrical ideas and finally socialization through action). The traditional games are the best ways of teaching and learning. When these are applied in the primary schools, many teachers revealed that children know many games that the teachers have forgotten.

Indoor board game like &quot;Kasadi&quot; ( a wooden board with 14 pits played with tamarind seed by two or more than two girls in the domestic domain) was most popular and it is still not vanished from the society. Dr Mahendra Kumar Mishra, a folklorist and an educator has collected these games and has documented in video form.Besides other games in the domestic domain is the goat and the tiger and ganjifa. These were the forerunners of the card games of today. Ganjifa used to be circular painted stack of card like things which were played using certain rules.

== Indian folklorists ==
The scientific study of Indian folklore was slow to begin: early collectors felt far freer to creatively reinterpret source material and collected their material with a view to the picturesque rather than the representative.

A. K. Ramanujan&#x27;s theoretical and aesthetic contributions span several disciplinary areas. Context-sensitivity is a theme that appears not only in Ramanujan&#x27;s cultural essays, but also appears in his writing about Indian folklore and classic poetry. In &quot;Where Mirrors are Windows,&quot; (1989) and in &quot;Three Hundred Ramayanas&quot; (1991), for example, he discusses the &quot;intertextual&quot; nature of Indian literature, written and oral...He says, &quot;What is merely suggested in one poem may become central in a &#x27;repetition&#x27; or an &#x27;imitation&#x27; of it. His essay &quot;Where Mirrors Are Windows: Toward an Anthology of Reflections&quot; (1989), and his commentaries in The Interior Landscape: Love Poems from a Classical Tamil Anthology (1967) and Folktales from India, Oral Tales from Twenty Indian Languages (1991) are good examples of his work in Indian folklore studies.

Rudyard Kipling was interested in folklore, dealing with English folklore in works such as &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot; and &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot;; his experiences in India led him to also create similar works with Indian themes. Kipling spent a great deal of his life in India and was familiar with the Hindi language. His works such as the two &quot;Jungle Books&quot; contain a lot of stories that are written after the manner of traditional folktales. Indian themes also appear in his &quot;Just So Stories&quot;, and many of the characters bear recognisable names from Indian languages. During the same period, Helen Bannerman penned the now notorious Indian-themed tale of &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot;, which represented itself to be an Indian folktale.

After independence, disciplines and methods from anthropology began to be used in the creation of more in-depth surveys of Indian folklore.

Folklorists of India can be broadly divided into three phases. Phase I was the British Administrators who collected the local knowledge and folklore to understand the subjects they want to rule. next were the missionaries who wanted to acquire the language of the people to recreate their religious literature for evangelical purpose. The third phase was the post-independent period in the country where many universities, institutes and individuals started studying the folklore. the purpose was to search the national identity through legends, myths, and epics. In the course of time, Academic institutions and universities in the country started opening departments on folklore in their respective regions, more in south India to maintain their cultural identity and also maintain language and culture.

After independence, scholars like Dr Satyendra, Devendra Satyarthi, Krishnadev Upadhayaya, Jhaberchand Meghani, Prafulla Dutta Goswami, Ashutosh Bhattacharya, Kunja Bihari Dash, Chitrasen Pasayat, Somnath Dhar, Ramgarib Choubey, Jagadish Chandra Trigunayan and many more were the pioneer in working on folklore. Of course, the trend was more literary than analytical. It was during the 1980s that the central Institute of Indian Languages and the American Institute of Indian Studies started their systemic study on Folklore any after that many western, as well as eastern scholars, pursued their studies on folklore as a discipline.

The pioneer of the folklorists in contemporary India is Jawaharlal Handoo, Sadhana Naithani, Kishore Bhattacharjee, Kailash Patnaik, VA Vivek Rai, late Komal Kothari, Raghavan Payanad, M Ramakrishnan, Nandini Sahu.M.N. Venkatesha and many more. An emerging trend of new folklorists has emerged who are committed to understanding folklore from an Indian point of view than to see the whole subjects from the western model. Some of them are better to prefer to understand folklore from the folklore provider and consultants who are the creator and consumers of folklore. The user of folklore knows what folklore is since their use folklore with purpose and meaning. But theoreticians see folklore from their theoretical angle. Ethics point of view, folklorist should learn from the folk as practicable as possible and folk should give the hidden meaning of folklore to the folklorist so that both of their interpretation can help to give a new meaning to the item of folklore and explore the possibility of use of folklore in the new socio-cultural domain.

Dr Mahendra Kumar Mishra from Kalahandi, Odisha has substantially contributed to the tribal folklore of Middle Indian and Odisha. His seminal book &quot;Oral Epics of Kalahandi&quot; has been translated into Chinese, and Finnish language. He has written Saora folk literature, Paharia Folkliterature, Visioning Folklore, Oral Poetry of Kalahandi. His recent seminal work is three oral Ramakatha in tribal oral tradition. Dr Mishra has written five books on folklore theory and research methodology adopting the folklore of western Odisha and Chhattisgarh. The analytical work of Dr Mishra has been widely studied in the western and eastern world as a part of South Asian folklore.

Now the National Folklore Support Center, Chennai since the last ten years has created a space for the new scholars who are pursuing the study of folklore with their commitment. One important breakthrough in the field of folklore is that it is no more confined to the study in the four walls of academic domain, rather, it has again found its space within and among the folk to get their true meaning.

Dr.Raghavanvpayyanad is a major role in Indian folklore study he has written so many books about folklore, he is also an international face of Indian folkloristics both in English and Malayalam.

==Folk songs and folk music==
India has a rich and varied tradition of folk music and numerous types of folk songs. Some traditional folk song genres have been recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritage listed by UNESCO. Among these traditions, a well-known musical and religious repertoire is known as Baul, which has become famous in the World Music scene. Among the most respected historical figures of the Baul tradition, Lalon Fakir and Bhaba Pagla are often mentioned.

<text>Ferdinand Wythe Peck (1848-1924) was a wealthy Chicago, Illinois, businessman and philanthropist, best known for financing Chicago&#x27;s Auditorium Building.

He was the youngest son of Mary Kent Peck and Phillip F.W. Peck. The family moved from Rhode Island to Chicago in the 1830s and made a fortune in real estate. Peck and his brothers took over the family fortune when their father died, and soon were among the wealthiest families in Chicago.

Ferdinand was a civic-minded individual, and was involved in many projects around the city. He was a founding member of the Illinois humane society, and served on the city board of education. He was also a patron of the arts, particularly concerned with making high art available to the working classes. To this end, he organized the Chicago Grand Opera Festival in 1885.

Out of the Festival grew a desire for a more permanent expression of his ideals. Shortly after the Haymarket Square riot, he began planning in earnest for what would become the Auditorium Building.

To make his idea real, Peck hired architects Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan, who had worked for him previously to prepare the space for the Grand Opera Festival. Peck provided much of the funding and the central vision for the building, and the final design reflected his ideas as well as those of the architects.

Peck served as the Commissioner-General for the United States at the Paris Exposition, 1900.

He died in Chicago on November 4, 1924, and was buried at Rosehill Cemetery.

There is currently an elementary school in southwest Chicago, at 3826 West 58th Street, named after him.

<text>Wellington is a town in the Central Western Slopes region of New South Wales, Australia, located at the junction of the Wambuul Macquarie and Bell Rivers. It is within the local government area of Dubbo Regional Council. The town is northwest of Sydney on the Mitchell Highway and Main Western Railway, and 50 km southeast of Dubbo, the main centre of the Central Western Slopes region.

Wellington was the second European settlement west of the Blue Mountains, first established as a convict establishment in 1823.

==History==

===Aboriginal history===
The area now known as Wellington lies on the traditional lands of the Wiradjuri people.

The &#x27;Wambuul&#x27; (Macquarie River) was an important source of sustenance for this widespread Aboriginal group united by kinship and a common language. Surviving evidence in the Wellington area of the occupation by the Wiradjuri people prior to European contact includes rock shelters with archaeological deposits, a carved tree, scarred trees, open camp sites, grinding grooves sites and bora (ceremonial) grounds.

The city still has a strong Aboriginal presence, largely as a result of early missionary settlements set up there, other Aboriginal campsites, such as the Wellington Common, and, from 1910, the Nanima Aboriginal Reserve, all of which kept local people residing in the area.

In 2007, a group of Wiradjuri people won a Native Title claim, over the area known as the Wellington Common, where many Wiradjuri lived, and that land was returned to its traditional owners.

===European exploration===
The European discovery of the Wellington Valley occurred during the return journey of John Oxley&#x27;s Lachlan River expedition in 1817. While crossing from the Bogan River to the Macquarie River in August 1817 Oxley and his party happening upon the Wellington Valley with the Bell River running through it. They followed the river to its junction with the Macquarie. Oxley was effusive about the valley, describing it as “beautifully picturesque” and “studded with fine trees upon a soil which may be equalled, but can never be excelled”. The Bell River was named “as a compliment to Brevet Major Bell of the 48th Regiment” and the Wellington Valley was named after the Duke of Wellington.

===Convict outpost===
In January 1823 Lieutenant Percy Simpson was appointed by the colonial government to establish a settlement at the junction of the Bell and Macquarie rivers in the Wellington Valley. Simpson and a party of soldiers and convicts arrived at the locality via Bathurst in February with 12 cows and 40 sheep, as well as a provision of wheat. Simpson chose a site for the settlement on high ground above the Bell River (about three kilometres south of the modern cityship). There were early problems, including desertions and stock theft by convicts, but fields of wheat and other staples were eventually established. A muster roll in 1826 recorded 85 men at Wellington. By that stage a number of pastoral runs had been established in the vicinity of the settlement and along the Macquarie River. The convict outpost at Wellington was discontinued in 1831 and &quot;the settlement was used for a time as a Government stock station&quot;. A traveller to the area in 1832 described the settlement as “abandoned” except for “a dozen stockmen and soldiers who remained to protect the buildings from the mischievous spoilation of the natives”.

===Missionary settlement===

In December 1831 the secretary of state for the colonies informed Governor Bourke that an agreement had been entered into with the Church Missionary Society in England “by which the organisation had undertaken to send out and superintend a mission to the natives”. Permission was sought to “establish the Mission at Wellington Valley”, to which the Governor agreed, authorising them to “occupy the Government buildings there and to use for grazing any land they desired to occupy for that purpose”. The missionaries sent to Wellington in 1832 were Rev. William Watson and Rev. James Handt, a Lutheran clergyman.

In 1835 Messrs. Backhouse and Walter, both Quakers, visited the Mission. Backhouse reported that ”the blacks at the station were not numerous”, with “about 30” being the usual number living there. The Aborigines were said to be “very capricious” and “by no means desirous to learn”. They were “attracted” to the food supplied by the Mission and “they were not disposed to work”. A mission report in 1836 stated that “the vocabulary of the native language had been revised and enlarged” and that “services were held in the language”. 
Rev. Handt left Wellington in 1836 “as his wife was ill”. Rev. James Gunther and his wife arrived in August 1837, replacing Handt and his wife.

===Wellington cityship===

In 1840, a village called Montefiores was established on the north side of the Macquarie River crossing. The city of Wellington, on the south bank of the Macquarie River opposite Montefiores, was gazetted in 1846, and on 20 March 1885, Wellington was proclaimed a city.

The first local government body covering Wellington was the Wellington Municipal District, proclaimed in 1879. In 1950 it was amalgamated with Macquarie Shire and part of Cobbora Shire to form Wellington Shire. There was a number of transfer of areas with adjoining shires, and in 2016 Wellington Shire was amalgamated with the local government area of Dubbo City to form Western Plains Regional Council.

Wellington is the second oldest New South Wales settlement west of the Blue Mountains. One of its hotels, the &quot;Lion of Waterloo&quot;, established by Nicolas Hyeronimus in 1842, is the oldest operating west of the Blue Mountains.

Near to The Lion of Waterloo is the location of the last recorded duel fought on Australian soil, in 1854.

As a regional centre Wellington benefited by the development of the gold mining industry in the district from the 1850s. Initially this was working alluvial deposits of gold but later focused on the mining of quartz reefs. Among the mining districts was Mitchells Creek located 8 miles to the north east near the locality of Bodangora. In the first decade of the 20th century, there was a revival of gold mining in the area, when gold dredges operated on the Macquarie River near Wellington.

The extension of the Main Western Railway from Orange to Wellington opened on 1 June 1880. The line was subsequently extended to Dubbo in February 1881.

==Heritage listings==
Wellington has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 9 Amaroo Drive: John Fowler 7nhp Steam Road Locomotive
* Curtis Street: Wellington Convict and Mission Site
* 21 Maughan Street: Wellington Post Office
* University Road: Blacks Camp

==Economy==

Wellington is the centre of rich agricultural land. While alfalfa and vegetables are grown on lands on the river, wheat, wool, lambs and beef cattle are grown on surrounding pastures. The city acts as a commercial centre for the surrounding district.

In September 2008, the Wellington Correctional Centre was opened. A Probation and Parole Office was also opened in the centre of city. Wellington Council hopes this will stimulate economic growth in the area, due to increasing employment opportunities and the need for non-locals to utilise Wellington facilities.

The local newspaper &quot;The Wellington Times&quot;, a Rural Press title, is published three times a week with a circulation in the region of around 1000.

There is a popular Community Radio Station operating on a frequency of 91.5 MHz FM.

KFC was built in 2019.

== Climate ==
Wellington possesses a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa), with hot summers and cool winters. Average maxima vary from in January to in July, while average minima fluctuate between in January and in July. Annual precipitation is moderately low (averaging ), and is spread across 76.4 precipitation days. The town is rather sunny, experiencing 138.1 clear days and 91.9 cloudy days per annum. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 11 February 2017 to on 25 June 1971 and on 20 July 1982.

==Transport links==

Wellington station is served by a daily NSW TrainLink XPT service which runs between Sydney and Dubbo.

The closest commercial airport is that of Dubbo. QantasLink and Rex Airlines service the airport three-five times daily from Sydney. Bodangora Airport for general aviation aircraft is located twelve kilometres east of Wellington.

Ogden&#x27;s Coaches operates return services to Dubbo, with one extending to Narromine as a through-routed service with the Narromine link.

==Nearby attractions==

Lake Burrendong, a man-made lake, is located 30 kilometres south of the city. Its capacity is three and a half times that of Sydney Harbour and supplies water for irrigation schemes downstream. It is also a popular location for anglers, sailors and water skiers. Burrendong Arboretum is a sanctuary for endangered Australian flora and covers 1.60 km2.

The nearby Wellington Caves feature the Cathedral Cave with the massive Altar Rock and has a viewable underground river running at the bottom. Immediately to the East of the cityship lies the Catombal Range with magnificent bushwalks in and around Mt Arthur and Mt Wellesley.

The Wellington Boot, a country racing festival is held in March and April annually. The Bell River Wine Estate is nearby.

<text>The Tlicho language, also known as Tłı̨chǫ Yatıì () or the Dogrib language, is a Northern Athabaskan language spoken by the Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib people) First Nations of the Canadian Northwest Territories. According to Statistics Canada in 2011, there were 2,080 people who speak Tłı̨chǫ Yatıì. As of 2016, 1,735 people speak the language.

Tłıchǫ Yatıì is spoken by the Tłıchǫ, a Dene First Nations people that reside in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Tłı̨chǫ lands lie east of Mackenzie River (Deh Cho) between Great Slave Lake (Tıdeè) and Great Bear Lake (Sahtu) in the Northwest Territories. There are four primary communities that speak the language: Gamèti (formerly Rae Lakes), Behchokǫ̀ (formerly Rae-Edzo), Wekweètì (formerly Snare Lakes) and Whatì (formerly Lac La Martre). From a population number of about 800 during the mid-19th century to about 1,700 by the 1970s, the population has grown to about 2,080 as recorded by the 2011 Census. However, Tłıchǫ Yatıì has seen a decrease in mother tongue speakers, hence placing it under the list of endangered languages.

The Tłıchǫ region covers the northern shore of Great Slave Lake (Tıdeè), reaching up to Great Bear Lake (Sahtu). Behchokǫ̀, is the largest community in Tłıchǫ territory. According to the Endangered Languages Project, approximately 1,350 people speak the language while at home. Speakers are commonly fluent in English.

==History==

Tłıchǫ Yatıì was traditionally only an oral language. Tłı̨chǫ Yatıì was one of the many Indigenous Canadian languages affected by the Canadian Indian residential school system. Through the British North America Act of 1867 and the Indian Act of 1876, the Canadian Government formalised its unilateral control over Indigenous people and their lands. By the 1920s these schools became mandatory for all indigenous children to attend. Indigenous languages were not allowed to be spoken at these schools since the late 19th century. The last of the residential schools closed in 1996. These schools contributed heavily to language shift away from Indigenous languages, including Tłı̨chǫ Yatıì, and towards English.

In 1992, the first edition of the &quot;Tłıchǫ Yatıì Enįhtł’è - A Dogrib Dictionary&quot; was published which provided the Tłıchǫ people with a database of words and spelling. This sparked the interest of community members and became the first step in revitalization efforts.

== Revitalization efforts ==
In 2005, the Tłıchǫ signed the Tłıchǫ Agreement for Self-Governance. This allowed the Tłıchǫ people to prioritize the preservation of their language, culture and way of life. Since its implementation, the Tłıchǫ Government has been working hard to help younger generations of Tłıchǫ learn the language by declaring Tłıchǫ Yatıì as one of two official languages of the Tłıchǫ Government. Revitalization efforts include putting up signs in Tłıchǫ Yatıì, creating on the land programs, providing Tłıchǫ Yatıì classes for community members.

Tłı̨chǫ Yatıì is one of the nine official Indigenous languages of the Northwest Territories (NWT) in Canada. Because of its official status, the NWT&#x27;s department of Education, Culture, and Employment, has been monitoring the language through the Indigenous Languages and Education Secretariat since 2014. This department is devoted to the revitalization of the official languages in the NWT and has policies that ensure the continued use and growth of Indigenous languages. According to the 2018 - 2019 Annual Report on Official Languages, multiple revitalization efforts have been made by the Tłı̨chǫ Government. Some of which include an Elder Evening Story Telling that occurs weekly, transcribing and translating materials into Tłı̨chǫ Yatıì for classes, setting up a radio station, and having community language classes in the language, now including immersion classes in grades K-7. In addition to local efforts, the Official Languages Act ensures that Tłı̨chǫ Yatıì and the other indigenous languages are used in providing government services.

==Geographic distribution==

The language is mainly spoken in the Northwest Territories of Canada. The four official Tłıchǫ communities are Gamètì, Behchokǫ̀, Wekweètì and Whatì. Both communities of Yellowknife and Dettah also have many Tłıchǫ speakers, mostly speaking the Wıı̀lıı̀deh Yatıı̀ dialect.

==Dialects==
The Yellowknives Dene speak a dialect of Tłı̨chǫ called Wıı̀lıı̀deh Yatıı̀. This dialect came into existence when speakers of Chipewyan began speaking Tłı̨chǫ after 1829 and incorporated some Chipewyan words and grammar.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
The consonants of Tłıchǫ Yatıì in the standard orthography are listed below (with IPA notation in brackets):

Tenuis stops may be lightly voiced. Aspirated stops may be fricated before back vowels.
===Vowels===
The language uses long, short and nasal vowels, and distinguishes them in writing, along with low tone:

:* Nasal vowels are marked by an ogonek (called &quot;wı̨ghǫą&quot;, &#x27;its little nose&#x27;, in Tłı̨chǫ Yatıı̀) e.g. ą.
:* Low tone is marked with a grave accent (called &quot;wets&#x27;aà&quot;, &#x27;its hat&#x27;, in Tłı̨chǫ Yatıı̀), e.g. à.
:* High tone is never marked.
:* The letter &#x27;i&#x27; is written without a dot (tittle).

==Grammar==
Typologically, Tłıchǫ Yatıì is an agglutinating, polysynthetic head-marking language, but many of its affixes combine into contractions more like fusional languages. The canonical word order of Tłıchǫ Yatıì is SOV. Tłıchǫ Yatıì words are modified primarily by prefixes, which is unusual for an SOV language (suffixes are expected).

Like Spanish and Portuguese, Tłıchǫ Yatıì has two verbs similar to English &#x27;be&#x27;. One is used for ways of being that are more dynamic or temporary; the other for more permanent and immutable properties. For example, &quot;nàzèe-dǫǫ̀ ts’ı̨ı̨lı̨&quot; and &quot;nàzèe-dǫǫ̀ ats’ı̨ı̨t’e&quot; both mean &#x27;we are hunters&#x27;, but the first means that the speakers are &quot;currently&quot; hunters (for example, part of a hunting party), while the second implies that hunting is their regular profession.

In addition to verbs and nouns, there are pronouns, clitics of various functions, demonstratives, numerals, postpositions, adverbs, and conjunctions in Tłıchǫ. The class of adjectives is very small, probably around two dozen words: most descriptive words are verbs rather than adjectives.

== Examples ==
Example words and phrases:

* – Tłıchǫ people
* – dog
* – dog rib
* – fish
* – duck
* – egg
* – milk
* – wolf
* – poplar

<text>George Levick Street III (July 27, 1913 – February 26, 2000) was a submariner in the United States Navy. He received the Medal of Honor during World War II.

==Early life and career==
Street was born in Richmond, Virginia. He joined the Naval Reserve in 1931 and was selected for an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1933; he graduated in 1937.

After serving in the gunnery and communications departments of and the navigation and engineering departments of , he volunteered for the Submarine School at New London, Connecticut. After graduating, Street served three years in , from her commissioning on April 14, 1941, until February 27, 1944. Street served in this fleet submarine, first as Gunnery and Torpedo Officer, then as First Lieutenant and Torpedo Data Computer Operator and finally as Executive Officer and Navigator.

==World War II==
While serving in &quot;Gar&quot;, he made nine war patrols. Street received two Silver Stars for his &quot;for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action against the enemy while serving as Assistant Approach Officer aboard the ... U.S.S. GAR (SS-206)&quot; on &quot;Gar&quot;&#x27;s first and tenth patrols.

On July 6, 1944, LCDR Street reported to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to fit out the , his first command. Commissioning the ship in November, the captain took his new boat for shakedown training in Long Island Sound and further training in waters off Panama and Hawaii. The ship&#x27;s first war patrol, commencing March 3, 1945, was southwest of Kyūshū, Japan&#x27;s southernmost island. By that point in the war, most of Japan&#x27;s merchant fleet had already been sunk, but Street went into shallow water close to shore and found several ships.

Searching westward of Kyushu, &quot;Tirante&quot; patrolled the approaches to Nagasaki. She had good hunting. She sank the 703-ton tanker &quot;Fuji Maru&quot; on 25 March and followed this success with the sinking of the 1,218-ton freighter &quot;Nase Maru&quot; three days later. After the latter attack, Japanese escorts kept Tirante down for seven hours, before she slipped away from her hunters, unscathed.

On 31 March, &quot;Tirante&quot; shelled and sank a 70-ton lugger with 5-inch and 40-millimeter gunfire and, on 1 April, missed an LST-type vessel with a spread of three torpedoes. The submarine soon shifted to waters off the south coast of Korea, near the Strait of Tsushima. At twilight on 6 April, she battle-surfaced and captured a small Japanese fishing vessel and took its three crewmen prisoner before sinking the prize.

The following day, &quot;Tirante&quot; torpedoed a 2,800-ton cargo freighter loaded with a deck cargo of oil drums. The submarine surfaced, looked over the debris, and directed nearby Korean fishing craft to pick up two survivors who were clinging to pieces of wreckage. Nevertheless, although observers on the submarine reported witnessing the &quot;maru&#x27;s&quot; sinking, post-war examination of Japanese records failed to confirm the &quot;kill.&quot;

Having broken the Japanese codes, American naval intelligence men were able to anticipate Japanese movements. One intercepted enemy message told of an important convoy steaming toward &quot;Tirante&#x27;s&quot; area. In response to this information, the submarine laid an ambush on 9 April. Picking out two targets, she fired three torpedoes at each. One spread missed, but the other struck the 5,500-ton transport Nikko Maru— carrying homeward-bound Japanese soldiers and sailors from Shanghai. As the important auxiliary slipped beneath the waves, enemy escorts leapt to the offensive. To ward off the counterattack, &quot;Tirante&quot; fired a &quot;cutie&quot; (a small anti-escort homing torpedo) at one of the escorts and heard subsequent &quot;breaking-up noises.&quot; But again, post-war accounting failed to confirm the sinking.

On 15 April 1945, following a report from Naval Intelligence, Street took into Cheju harbor — on the surface, to avoid shoals and minefields. Using six of his seven remaining torpedoes, he sank a freighter and two of its escorts. For this action, was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation (US), Street received the Medal of Honor, and his executive officer, LT Edward L. Beach Jr., received the Navy Cross.

Beginning her second patrol, &quot;Tirante&quot; departed from Midway on 20 May 1945 as command ship of the nine-boat &quot;wolfpack&quot; dubbed &quot;Street&#x27;s Sweepers.&quot; They patrolled the Yellow and East China Seas on the lookout for enemy targets—by then dwindling in number. &quot;Tirante&quot; located a four-ship convoy on 11 June, in the first patrol&#x27;s hunting grounds off Nagasaki. She evaded the three escorts long enough to get a shot at the lone merchantman, an 800-ton cargo freighter, and pressed home a successful attack. Post-war Japanese records, though, do not confirm a &quot;kill.&quot;

The next day, &quot;Tirante&quot; pulled off nearly a repeat performance of her hit-and-run raid at &quot;Cheju&quot;. She crept into &quot;Ha Shima&quot; harbor, some seven miles from Nagasaki and picked out the 2,200-ton &quot;Hakuju Maru&quot; moored alongside a colliery. From a range of 1,000 yards, the submarine fired a &quot;down the throat&quot; shot at the &quot;maru&quot; which exploded with a roar. The second torpedo failed to detonate, but the third completed the destruction begun by the first. As shells from shore guns fell around her, &quot;Tirante&quot; bent on speed and cleared the area.

Resuming her roving patrols, &quot;Tirante&quot; and her sister submarines attacked shipping between Korea and Japan, destroying junks carrying supplies from Korea to the Japanese home islands. Boarding parties from the submarine would take off the masters for questioning, put the crew in life boats, and set the craft afire. &quot;Tirante&quot; sank a dozen in this manner and also destroyed two heavily armed picket boats with surface gunfire before returning to Guam on 19 July 1945. For this patrol, LCDR Street was awarded the Navy Cross. That citation reads in part &quot;...For extraordinary heroism ...Tracking his targets relentlessly ...(he) launched his smashing torpedo and gunfire attacks against hostile freighters, junks and picket boats, sinking over 7000 tons of shipping vital to Japanese supply...&quot;

&quot;Tirante&quot; departed Guam on 12 August 1945 on what would have been her third war patrol. The end of the war, however, cut this operation short and the submarine put into Midway on 23 August. Eventually sailing for the east coast of the United States, &quot;Tirante&quot; moored at the Washington Navy Yard in Octoberat which the newly promoted CDR Street received his Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony.

==World War II summary==

&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt; 

==Medal of Honor action==
&quot;Tirante&#x27;s&quot; first war patrol, beginning in March 1945, cost Japan at least six ships. Most notably
while patrolling the Yellow Sea between Quelpart Island (Cheju Do) and the mouth of the Yangtze, she received an intelligence report which informed her that an important Japanese transport was at Cheju, the main port on Quelpart Island. Under cover of darkness, Tirante began her approach on the surface. In defiance of possible enemy radar or patrolling planes or ships, she closed the coast and penetrated the mine- and shoal-obstructed waters within the 10-fathom (60-foot) curve line. Prepared to fight her way out, Tirante then entered the harbor where she found three targets: two escort vessels and the 4,000-ton &quot;Juzan Maru&quot;.

The submarine launched three torpedoes at the &quot;maru&quot;, which blew up in a massive explosion.&quot;A tremendous, beautiful explosion,&quot; Commander Street would write in his report. &quot;A great mushroom of white blinding flame shot 2,000 feet into the air. Not a sound was heard for a moment, but then a tremendous roar flattened our ears against our heads. The jackpot, and no mistake!&quot;The conflagration clearly illuminated Tirante and alerted the &quot;Mikura&quot;-class escort vessels &quot;Nomi&quot; and &quot;Kaibokan No. 31&quot; which immediately got underway toward the invading submersible. While she headed back out to sea at flank speed, Tirante launched a spread of torpedoes which hit and destroyed both pursuers. En route to Midway, the submarine captured two Japanese airmen (bringing her prisoner total to five) and concluded her first war patrol on 25 April.

Tirante&#x27;s stellar performance earned Comdr. Street the Medal of Honor. Lt. Edward L. Beach, the executive officer—and later commander of Triton (SSRN-586) during the submarine&#x27;s submerged circumnavigation of the globe—received the Navy Cross. The ship, herself, was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.
His medal of citation reads:
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as commanding officer of the U.S.S. &quot;Tirante&quot; during the first war patrol of that vessel against enemy Japanese surface forces in the harbor of Cheju, Quelpart Island, off the coast of Korea, on 14 April 1945. With the crew at surface battle stations, Comdr. (then Lt. Comdr.) Street approached the hostile anchorage from the south within 1,200 yards [1100 m] of the coast to complete a reconnoitering circuit of the island. Leaving the 10-fathom [18 m] curve far behind he penetrated the mined and shoal-obstructed waters of the restricted harbor despite numerous patrolling vessels and in defiance of 5 shore-based radar stations and menacing aircraft. Prepared to fight it out on the surface if attacked, Comdr. Street went into action, sending 2 torpedoes with deadly accuracy into a large Japanese ammunition ship and exploding the target in a mountainous and blinding glare of white flames. With the &quot;Tirante&quot; instantly spotted by the enemy as she stood out plainly in the flare of light, he ordered the torpedo data computer set up while retiring and fired his last 2 torpedoes to disintegrate in quick succession the leading frigate and a similar flanking vessel. Clearing the gutted harbor at emergency full speed ahead, he slipped undetected along the shoreline, diving deep as a pursuing patrol dropped a pattern of depth charges at the point of submergence. His illustrious record of combat achievement during the first war patrol of the &quot;Tirante&quot; characterizes Comdr. Street as a daring and skilled leader and reflects the highest credit upon himself, his valiant command, and the U.S. Naval Service.

However, Captain Street was most proud of Tirante&#x27;s Presidential Unit Citation. &quot;As Captain Street put it, &#x27;I really treasure that more than the Medal of Honor because every man was there with us.&#x27;&quot;

==Post-World War II==
Street was promoted to Commander in July 1945 and, in January 1946, left to become the Navy&#x27;s technical adviser for the submarine documentary film &quot;The Silent Service&quot;. That summer, he transferred to the Office of Naval Research and assisted in organizing the first Undersea Symposium. His next assignment, as Commanding Officer of , lasted from November 1946 to June 1948. This included operations as a radar picket submarine supporting aircraft carrier task forces. Following instruction at the Armed Forces Staff College at Norfolk, Virginia, in 1949, Commander Street served on its faculty in the Research and Development Division. In 1951, after attending the Fleet Sonar School at Key West, Florida, he assumed command of the , a destroyer modified for anti-submarine purposes. Street commanded Submarine Division Sixty-Two 1952–1953, evaluating the use of several radar picket submarines working as a team. He then returned to the Office of the Chief of the Naval Operations as Assistant for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Armed Forces Policy Council.

In July 1955, Street was promoted to Captain. Upon completion of classes at the National War College in Washington, D.C., in July 1956, he served on the Staff to the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Returning to sea in July 1958, he commanded the attack transport . A year later, Captain Street became Commanding Officer and Professor of Naval Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at Cambridge, Massachusetts. In October 1961, he took command of Submarine Squadron Five and, the next fall, joined the Staff of the Naval War College. His final assignment, beginning in December 1964, was as Commander Submarine Group, San Francisco Bay Area and Commander Mare Island Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. Upon his retirement, Captain Street was selected as the Senior Naval Science Instructor for one of the newly authorized Navy JROTC units located at Woburn High School, Woburn Massachusetts. He served in this position until 1977 when retired from the Woburn School system.

==Retirement and death==
Captain Street retired from active duty on 10 August 1966. He resided in Andover, Massachusetts, and was a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts.

George L. Street III died on 26 February 2000 at the Academy Manor Nursing Home in Andover. In keeping with his request, half his cremated remains were dispersed at sea from a submarine, and half were buried at Arlington National Cemetery on 15 March 2000.

==Popular culture==
Edward Beach, &quot;Tirante&#x27;s&quot; executive officer on her first patrol, modeled his first novel, &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; (1955), on his wartime experiences.

<text>Moree () is a town in Moree Plains Shire in northern New South Wales, Australia. It is located on the banks of the Mehi River, in the centre of the rich black-soil plains. Newell and Gwydir highways intersect at the town. It can also be reached from Sydney by daily train and air services.

The Weraerai and Kamilaroi peoples are the earliest known inhabitants of the area, and the town&#x27;s name is said to come from an Aboriginal word for &quot;rising sun&quot;, &quot;long spring&quot;, or &quot;water hole&quot;. The town was established by colonial British in the 1850s. They forced the local Aboriginal residents in missions, and later Aboriginal reserves.

The town, and in particular the Moree Baths and Swimming Pool, are known for having been visited by the group of activists on the famous 1965 Freedom Ride. This historic trip through northern NSW was led by Charles Perkins to bring media attention to discrimination against Indigenous Australians.

Moree is a major agricultural centre, noted for its part in the Australian cotton-growing industry, which was established there in the early 1960s. It is situated in the Moree Plains Shire. Moree is noted for artesian hot spring baths that are renowned for their reputed healing qualities.

At the 2021 census, the town of Moree had a population of 7,070.

==History==
===Aboriginal people===
The Weraerai and Kamilaroi peoples, whose descendants live in the town, were the earliest known inhabitants of the area.

===British colonisation===
In 1832, Major Thomas Mitchell led a large expedition to the district after escaped convict George Clarke told the colonial authorities of the supposed existence of a great river called the &quot;Kindur&quot; that flowed through the region. Clarke had been a bushranger living a mostly tribal lifestyle with a Kamilaroi clan in the area to the south from 1827 to 1831. He had gained geographical knowledge important to the colonists. In January 1832, Mitchell crossed what is now known as the Mehi River around ten kilometres east of where the town Moree is now located.

Squatters soon followed in Mitchell&#x27;s wake, establishing pastoral runs in the vicinity, among which were &#x27;Mungie Bundie&#x27; formed by brothers John Henry Fleming and Joseph Fleming in 1837, &#x27;Boolooroo&#x27; formed by Robert Marshall in 1837, &#x27;Wee Bolla Bolla&#x27; formed by Thomas Simpson Hall in 1838, and &#x27;Mooree&#x27; (from a Kamilaroi term believed to mean either &quot;long waterhole&quot;, &quot;rising sun&quot;, or &quot;long spring&quot;) which was formed by James Cox in 1838.

Conflict between the colonists and Aboriginal people occurred soon after the arrival of the pastoralists. The whites murdered hundreds of Aboriginal people. Both groups of squatters and the New South Wales Mounted Police conducted punitive expeditions against the local Kamilaroi in what was termed at the time &quot;a war of extermination&quot;.

For example, a large massacre of Aborigines occurred at John Cobb&#x27;s Gravesend station in 1837, while in 1838 Major James Nunn and his mounted police killed at least forty at Waterloo Creek. Some of the surviving Mehi and Gwydir River Aborigines fled east to avoid the massacres. They were pursued by gangs of colonists, including one led by John Henry Fleming, a free settler of &#x27;Mungie Bundie&#x27; station; in June 1838 he initiated the Myall Creek massacre. Those Kamilaroi who stayed in the region continued to be killed, including nine who died in a massacre by Charles Eyles at Pallamallawa, also in 1838.

The Kamilaroi also suffered deaths from new infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, displacement, and lack of access to life-sustaining resources. The pastoralists took over their water holes and hunting grounds. The Aboriginal people resorted to poaching of livestock to survive, and cycles of retaliation between settlers and the indigenous people continued. The local Aboriginal people mostly suffer second-class status today.

=== Township of Moree ===
In 1851 James Brand and Mary Geddes arrived with their Aboriginal servant girl Jane Laney. They built a general store on the banks of the river in 1852. They added a post office was added the following year. The family sold up and moved to the Hunter Region in 1857 but James died in 1858. The widowed Mary was left with six children to support. She returned to Moree to open another business, and in 1861 she opened the community&#x27;s first inn.

Moree was gazetted as a town in 1862, with land sales proceeding that year.

A court of petty sessions was established in 1863. A severe flood took place in 1864. The first constable arrived and a police station was set up in 1865. The first church (Wesleyan Methodist) was built in 1867, when the town had a population of 43.

As closer settlement proceeded, agriculture emerged as a thriving industry on the fertile flood plains. Banking began in 1876. The first local newspaper was set up in 1881, at which time the population was 295.

The town became a municipality in 1890. During 1894 construction of the Federation-style lands office started; it ended that year with the completion of the ground floor. (The building is now heritage listed.) The second storey was added in 1903.

In 1895 the Great Artesian Basin, which sits under Moree, was tapped; it yields more than thirteen megalitres of water daily. The bore was sunk to deep in order to provide water for agricultural pursuits, but was proved to be unsuitable for this purpose.

The railway line and service from Sydney arrived in 1897. This increased the access to markets and goods for both producers and consumers in the town.

Wheat cultivation increased after World War II, and a flour mill was built at Moree in 1951. Other new crops were added.

The first commercial pecan nut farm was established on the Gwydir Highway east of Moree in 1966. The Trawalla Pecan Nut Farm is the largest pecan nut farm in the southern hemisphere, growing about 75,000 trees. In 1994 the Gwydir Olive Grove Company was established when two Moree families started producing olive oil from olives grown in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tourism Moree, Moree, 2007/2008&quot;&gt;Tourism Moree, Moree, 2007/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Moree was one of the destinations of the famous 1965 Freedom Bus ride, a historic trip through northern NSW led by activist Charles Perkins to bring media attention to discrimination against Indigenous Australians. The racial segregation of rural Australia was brought to the attention of urban Australians, in particular at the Moree Baths and Swimming Pool. Aboriginal people were also refused entry to pubs and theatres.

At the Moree swimming pool, after the Freedom Riders confronted the local council and pool management, they agreed to allow Indigenous children to swim in the pool outside school hours.
Tensions and discrimination have continued. In 1982, after a large, racially charged brawl between young white and black men, gangs of white men went around Moree shooting at Aboriginal people. Geoffrey Wilmot, Warren Ledingham, Steven Delamothe and Ian Bowen, armed with semi-automatic rifles and shot-guns, wounded several Aboriginal people, and killed nineteen-year-old Ronald McIntosh. Ledingham and Delamothe were later found guilty of manslaughter.

===Aboriginal missions and reserves===
After the government establishment the Aboriginal Protection Board (APB) in 1883, it developed Aboriginal reserves, where the indigenous people were supposed to live. The so-called Aborigines Protection Act 1909 enabled the government to conduct forced removals of children from the reserves, for education and welfare. Children of mixed race, called half-caste were among those removed, so that they could be raised with white people. To avoid this, Aboriginal families often left the reserves in order to escape white oversight, setting up fringe camps around towns to survive.

Moree Mission Aboriginal School was operating by 1933.

Aboriginal people moved from the Terry Hie Hie reserve, south-east of Moree, in the early 1920s to escape the forced removals by the APB of Aboriginal and &quot;half-caste&quot; children from their families. They created an informal settlement at Moree known as Top Camp, which existed until 1967. Steel Bridge Camp and Top Camp were both associated with Terry Hie Hie.

Middle Camp was established on the other side of town, next to the Mehi River, and Bottom Camp further downstream. In 1953 this latter camp was enlarged into a station known as Mehi Crescent Reserve or Mehi Mission.

&quot;Moree Aborigines&#x27; Station&quot; was in 1953 described as &quot;a little over two miles west of the town on the left bank of the Mehi&quot;. C. F. Boughton, in an article in the &quot;North West Champion&quot;, describes what the New South Wales Aborigines Welfare Board was doing in its 19 Aboriginal reserves for &quot;the uplift and welfare of the aborigines in this district&quot;.

The station was managed by a Mr E. Morgan. It had a school with a headmaster and two assistants, where girls were taught cookery and sewing. There were 118 students at the school, and some were brought by bus from nearby camps. The residents had formed a Progressive Association in 1951. They had a public address system and a football club, which played in the district competition. The manager&#x27;s wife ran a girl guides troop and there was a boys&#x27; club.

An Aboriginal reserve was declared on 17 July 1970 (effective 21 August 1970), and revoked on 20 September 1974. Other reserves and places of Aboriginal significance at nearby at Terry Hie Hie, and one called Wirajarai on the Gwydir River.

===21st century===

In 2007 the Moree Plains Council announced plans for a $14m upgrade to the hot thermal baths.

<text>Nicole Oresme (; ; 1 January 1325 – 11 July 1382), also known as Nicolas Oresme, Nicholas Oresme, or Nicolas d&#x27;Oresme, was a French philosopher of the later Middle Ages. He wrote influential works on economics, mathematics, physics, astrology, astronomy, philosophy, and theology; was Bishop of Lisieux, a translator, a counselor of King Charles V of France, and one of the most original thinkers of 14th-century Europe.

==Life==
Nicole Oresme was born in the village of Allemagnes (today&#x27;s Fleury-sur-Orne) in the vicinity of Caen, Normandy, in the diocese of Bayeux. Practically nothing is known concerning his family. The fact that Oresme attended the royally sponsored and subsidised College of Navarre, an institution for students too poor to pay their expenses while studying at the University of Paris, makes it probable that he came from a peasant family.

Oresme studied the &quot;arts&quot; in Paris, together with Jean Buridan (the so-called founder of the French school of natural philosophy), Albert of Saxony and perhaps Marsilius of Inghen, and there received the Magister Artium. He was already a regent master in arts by 1342, during the crisis over William of Ockham&#x27;s natural philosophy.

In 1348, he was a student of theology in Paris.

In 1356, he received his doctorate and in the same year he became grand master (&quot;grand-maître&quot;) of the College of Navarre. 

In 1364, he was appointed dean of the Cathedral of Rouen. Around 1369, he began a series of translations of Aristotelian works at the request of Charles V, who granted him a pension in 1371 and, with royal support, was appointed bishop of Lisieux in 1377. In 1382, he died in Lisieux.

==Scientific work==

===Cosmology===

In his &quot;Livre du ciel et du monde&quot; Oresme discussed a range of evidence for and against the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis. From astronomical considerations, he maintained that if the Earth were moving and not the celestial spheres, all the movements that we see in the heavens that are computed by the astronomers would appear exactly the same as if the spheres were rotating around the Earth. He rejected the physical argument that if the Earth were moving the air would be left behind causing a great wind from east to west. In his view the Earth, Water, and Air would all share the same motion. As to the scriptural passage that speaks of the motion of the Sun, he concludes that &quot;this passage conforms to the customary usage of popular speech&quot; and is not to be taken literally. He also noted that it would be more economical for the small Earth to rotate on its axis than the immense sphere of the stars. Nonetheless, he concluded that none of these arguments were conclusive and &quot;everyone maintains, and I think myself, that the heavens do move and not the Earth.&quot;

===Critiques of astrology===
In his mathematical work, Oresme developed the notion of incommensurate fractions, fractions that could not be expressed as powers of one another, and made probabilistic, statistical arguments as to their relative frequency. From this, he argued that it was very probable that the length of the day and the year were incommensurate (irrational), as indeed were the periods of the motions of the moon and the planets. From this, he noted that planetary conjunctions and oppositions would never recur in quite exactly the same way. Oresme maintained that this disproves the claims of astrologers who, thinking &quot;they know with punctual exactness the motions, aspects, conjunctions and oppositions… [judge] rashly and erroneously about future events.&quot;

Oresme&#x27;s critique of astrology in his &quot;Livre de divinacions&quot; treats it as having six parts. The first, essentially astronomy, the movements of heavenly bodies, he considers good science but not precisely knowable.
The second part deals with the influences of the heavenly bodies on earthly events at all scales. Oresme does not deny such influence, but states, in line with a commonly held opinion, that it could either be that arrangements of heavenly bodies signify events, purely symbolically, or that they actually cause such events, deterministically. Mediaevalist Chauncey Wood remarks that this major elision &quot;makes it very difficult to determine who believed what about astrology&quot;.

The third part concerns predictiveness, covering events at three different scales: great events such as plagues, famines, floods and wars; weather, winds and storms; and medicine, with influences on the humours, the four Aristotelian fluids of the body. Oresme criticizes all of these as misdirected, though he accepts that prediction is a legitimate area of study, and argues that the effect on the weather is less well known than the effect on great events. He observes that sailors and farmers are better at predicting weather than astrologers, and specifically attacks the astrological basis of prediction, noting correctly that the zodiac has moved relative to the fixed stars (because of precession of the equinoxes) since the zodiac was first described in ancient times. These first three parts are what Oresme considers the physical influences of the stars and planets (including sun and moon) on the earth, and while he offers critiques of them, he accepts that effects exist. The last three parts are what Oresme considers to concern (good or bad) fortune. They are interrogations, meaning asking the stars when to do things such as business deals; elections, meaning choosing the best time to do things such as getting married or fighting a war and nativities, meaning the natal astrology with birth charts that forms much of modern astrological practice. Oresme classifies interrogations and elections as &quot;totally false&quot; arts, but his critique of nativities is more measured. He denies that any path is predetermined by the heavenly bodies, because humans have free will, but he accepts that the heavenly bodies can influence behaviour and habitual mood, via the combination of humours in each person. Overall, Oresme&#x27;s skepticism is strongly shaped by his understanding of the scope of astrology. He accepts things a modern skeptic would reject, and rejects some things — such as the knowability of planetary movements, and effects on weather — that are accepted by modern science.

===Sense perception===
In discussing the propagation of light and sound, Oresme adopted the common medieval doctrine of the multiplication of species, as it had been developed by optical writers such as Alhacen, Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, John Pecham, and Witelo. Oresme maintained that these species were immaterial, but corporeal (i.e., three-dimensional) entities.

===Mathematics===

Oresme&#x27;s most important contributions to mathematics are contained in &quot;Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et motuum&quot;. In a quality, or accidental form, such as heat, he distinguished the &quot;intensio&quot; (the degree of heat at each point) and the &quot;extensio&quot; (as the length of the heated rod). These two terms were often replaced by &quot;latitudo&quot; and &quot;longitudo&quot;. For the sake of clarity, Oresme conceived the idea of visualizing these concepts by plane figures, approaching what we would now call rectangular coordinates. The intensity of the quality was represented by a length or &quot;latitudo&quot; proportional to the intensity erected perpendicular to the base at a given point on the base line, which represents the &quot;longitudo&quot;. Oresme proposed that the geometrical form of such a figure could be regarded as corresponding to a characteristic of the quality itself. Oresme defined a uniform quality as that which is represented by a line parallel to the longitude, and any other quality as difform. Uniformly varying qualities are represented by a straight line inclined to the axis of the longitude, while he described many cases of nonuniformly varying qualities. Oresme extended this doctrine to figures of three dimensions. He considered this analysis applicable to many different qualities such as hotness, whiteness, and sweetness. Significantly for later developments, Oresme applied this concept to the analysis of local motion where the &quot;latitudo&quot; or intensity represented the speed, the &quot;longitudo&quot; represented the time, and the area of the figure represented the distance travelled.

He shows that his method of figuring the latitude of forms is applicable to the movement of a point, on condition that the time is taken as longitude and the speed as latitude; quantity is, then, the space covered in a given time. In virtue of this transposition, the theorem of the &quot;latitudo uniformiter difformis&quot; became the law of the space traversed in case of uniformly varied motion; thus Oresme published what was taught over two centuries prior to Galileo&#x27;s making it famous. Diagrams of the velocity of an accelerating object against time in &quot;On the Latitude of Forms&quot; by Oresme have been cited to credit Oresme with the discovery of &quot;proto bar charts&quot;.

In &quot;De configurationibus&quot; Oresme introduces the concept of curvature as a measure of departure from straightness, for circles he has the curvature as being inversely proportional to radius and attempts to extend this to other curves as a continuously varying magnitude.

Significantly, Oresme developed the first proof of the divergence of the harmonic series. His proof, requiring less advanced mathematics than current standard tests for divergence (for example, the integral test), begins by noting that for any &quot;n&quot; that is a power of 2, there are &quot;n&quot;/2 − 1 terms in the series between 1/(&quot;n&quot;/2) and 1/&quot;n&quot;. Each of these terms is at least 1/&quot;n&quot;, and since there are &quot;n&quot;/2 of them they sum to at least 1/2. For instance, there is one term 1/2, then two terms 1/3 + 1/4 that together sum to at least 1/2, then four terms 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 that also sum to at least 1/2, and so on. Thus the series must be greater than the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + ..., which does not have a finite limit. This proves that the harmonic series must be divergent. This argument shows that the sum of the first &quot;n&quot; terms grows at least as fast as formula_1. (See also Harmonic series)

Oresme was the first mathematician to prove this fact, and (after his proof was lost) it was not proven again until the 17th century by Pietro Mengoli.

He also worked on fractional powers, and the notion of probability over infinite sequences, ideas which would not be further developed for the next three and five centuries, respectively.

=== On local motion ===
Oresme, like many of his contemporaries such as John Buridan and Albert of Saxony, shaped and critiqued Aristotle&#x27;s and Averroes&#x27;s theories of motion to their own liking. Taking inspiration from the theories of &quot;forma fluens&quot; and &quot;fluxus formae&quot;, Oresme would suggest his own descriptions for change and motion in his commentary of &quot;Physics&quot;. &quot;Forma fluens&quot; is described by William of Ockham as &quot;Every thing that is moved is moved by a mover,&quot; and &quot;fluxus formae&quot; as &quot;Every motion is produced by a mover.&quot; Buridan and Albert of Saxony each subscribed to the classic interpretation of flux being an innate part of an object, but Oresme differs from his contemporaries in this aspect. Oresme agrees with &quot;fluxus formae&quot; in that motion is attributed to an object, but that an object is “set into” motion, rather than “given” motion, denying a distinction between a motionless object and an object in motion. To Oresme, an object moves, but it is not a moving object. Once an object begins movement through the three dimensions it has a new “modus rei” or “way of being,” which should only be described through the perspective of the moving object, rather than a distinct point. This line of thought coincides with Oresme&#x27;s challenge to the structure of the universe. Oresme&#x27;s description of motion was not popular, although it was thorough. A Richard Brinkley is thought to be an inspiration for the modus-rei description, but this is uncertain.

=== Political thought ===

Oresme provided the first modern vernacular translations of Aristotle&#x27;s moral works that are still extant today. Between 1371 and 1377 he translated Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot;, &quot;Politics&quot; and &quot;Economics&quot; (the last of which is nowadays considered to be pseudo-Aristotelian) into Middle French. He also extensively commented on these texts, thereby expressing some of his political views. Like his predecessors Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas and Peter of Auvergne (and quite unlike Aristotle), Oresme favours monarchy as the best form of government. His criterion for good government is the common good. A king (by definition good) takes care of the common good, whereas a tyrant works for his own profit. A monarch can ensure the stability and durability of his reign by letting the people participate in government. This has rather confusingly and anachronistically been called popular sovereignty. Like Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, Peter of Auvergne and especially Marsilius of Padua, whom he occasionally quotes, Oresme conceives of this popular participation as rather restrictive: only the multitude of reasonable, wise and virtuous men should be allowed political participation by electing and correcting the prince, changing the law and passing judgement. Oresme, however, categorically denies the right of rebellion since it endangers the common good. Unlike earlier commentators, however, Oresme prescribes the law as superior to the king&#x27;s will. It must only be changed in cases of extreme necessity. Oresme favours moderate kingship, thereby negating contemporary absolutist thought, usually promoted by adherents of Roman law. Furthermore, Oresme doesn&#x27;t comply to contemporary conceptions of the French king as sacred, as promoted by Évrart de Trémaugon in his &quot;Songe du vergier&quot; or Jean Golein in his &quot;Traité du sacre&quot;. Although he heavily criticises the Church as corrupt, tyrannical and oligarchical, he never fundamentally questions its necessity for the spiritual well-being of the faithful.

It has traditionally been thought that Oresme&#x27;s Aristotelian translations had a major influence on King Charles V&#x27;s politics: Charles&#x27; laws concerning the line of succession and the possibility of a regency for an underage king have been accredited to Oresme, as has the election of several high-ranking officials by the king&#x27;s council in the early 1370s. Oresme may have conveyed Marsilian and conciliarist thought to Jean Gerson and Christine de Pizan.

=== Economics ===
With his &quot;Treatise on the origin, nature, law, and alterations of money&quot; (&quot;De origine, natura, jure et mutationibus monetarum&quot;), one of the earliest manuscripts devoted to an economic matter, Oresme brings an interesting insight on the medieval conception of money. Oresme&#x27;s viewpoints of theoretical architecture are outlined in Part 3 and 4 of his work from &quot;De moneta,&quot; which he completed between 1356 and 1360. His belief is that humans have a natural right to own property; this property belongs to the individual and community. In Part 4, Oresme provides a solution to a political problem as to how a monarch can be held accountable to put the common good before any private affairs. Though the monarchy rightfully has claims on all money given an emergency, Oresme states that any ruler that goes through this is a “Tyrant dominating slaves”. Oresme was one of the first medieval theorists that did not accept the right of the monarch to have claims on all money as well as “his subjects’ right to own private property.”

=== Psychology ===
Oresme was known to be a well rounded psychologist. He practiced the technique of “inner senses” and studied the perception of the world. Oresme contributed to 19th and 20th century psychology in the fields of cognitive psychology, perception psychology, psychology of consciousness, and psychophysics. Oresme discovered the psychology of unconscious and came up with the theory of unconscious conclusion of perception. He developed many ideas beyond quality, quantity, categories and terms which were labeled “theory of cognition”.

==Posthumous reputation==
Oresme&#x27;s economic thought remained well regarded centuries after his death. In a 1920 &quot;Essay on Medieval Economic Teaching&quot;, Irish economist George O&#x27;Brien summed up the favorable academic consensus over Oresme&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on the origin, nature, law, and alterations of money&quot;:
The merits of this work have excited the unanimous admiration of all who have studied it. Roscher says that it contains &#x27;a theory of money, elaborated in the fourteenth century, which remains perfectly correct to-day, under the test of the principles applied in the nineteenth century, and that with a brevity, a precision, a clarity, and a simplicity of language which is a striking proof of the superior genius of its author.&#x27; According to Brants, &#x27;the treatise of Oresme is one of the first to be devoted &quot;ex professo&quot; to an economic subject, and it expresses many ideas which are very just, more just than those which held the field for a long period after him, under the name of mercantilism, and more just than those which allowed of the reduction of money as if it were nothing more than a counter of exchange.&#x27; &#x27;Oresme&#x27;s treatise on money,&#x27; says Macleod, &#x27;may be justly said to stand at the head of modern economic literature. This treatise laid the foundations of monetary science, which are now accepted by all sound economists.&#x27; &#x27;Oresme&#x27;s completely secular and naturalistic method of treating one of the most important problems of political economy,&#x27; says Espinas, &#x27;is a signal of the approaching end of the Middle Ages and the dawn of the Renaissance.&#x27; Dr. Cunningham adds his tribute of praise: &#x27;The conceptions of national wealth and national power were ruling ideas in economic matters for several centuries, and Oresme appears to be the earliest of the economic writers by whom they were explicitly adopted as the very basis of his argument…. A large number of points of economic doctrine in regard to coinage are discussed with much judgment and clearness.&#x27; Endemann alone is inclined to quarrel with the pre-eminence of Oresme; but on this question, he is in a minority of one.

<text>Astro City, also known as Kurt Busiek&#x27;s Astro City, is an American superhero anthology comic book series centered on a fictional American city of that name. Created and written by Kurt Busiek, the series is mostly illustrated by Brent Anderson, with character designs and painted covers by Alex Ross. Its stories focus primarily on everyday life in a superhero comic universe, rather than on superheroic adventures and battles.

The first volume was published from 1995 to 1996 by Image Comics. In 1996, a second volume was launched under the Homage Comics imprint of Image partner studio WildStorm, which was then acquired by DC Comics, where the series later transitioned to the WildStorm Signature Series imprint and continued until 2010. During this period it switched from a regular ongoing series to a sequence of periodic mini-series and special issues. A third, ongoing volume was launched under DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint in 2013 and concluded in 2018, reverting to occasional miniseries and original graphic novels. Counting all series, mini-series and special issues, over 100 issues have been published.

==Themes==
The series portrays different perspectives on what everyday life might be like in a superhero-comic universe, with stories focusing on a variety of different superhero characters and ordinary people. It has been described as representing Busiek&#x27;s effort to move away from the Dark Age of Comic Books toward more optimistic stories, functioning as a &quot;thesis statement&quot; of how superhero comics work. The series examines the archetypes of older superhero comics, functioning as &quot;a vehicle to comment on [topics] buried in the subtext of old comics&quot;

Many of the superheroes in &quot;Astro City&quot; bear similarities to famous characters from Marvel Comics or DC Comics. For instance, the feminist superhero Winged Victory is reminiscent of Wonder Woman, and the superhero team First Family resemble the Fantastic Four.

==Characters==
Some of the more prominent personalities of &quot;Astro City&quot; are listed below:

===Heroes===
* Samaritan (Asa Martin) – an extremely powerful hero. A time-traveler, he appeared in this era in 1985, active as a hero since 1986 and is a current member of Honor Guard. He is sometimes referred to as &quot;Big Red&quot;. Samaritan is the first hero in the series to receive an origin story.
* The Confessor (Jeremiah Parrish) – a mysterious vigilante detective, apparently active from the 1950s to the mid-1990s. His history is a blur of myths and assumptions, as dark as his crime fighting methods. In the &quot;Confession&quot; arc from the second volume of the series, even his new sidekick struggles to know more about his mentor.
* Crackerjack – an egocentric, reckless crime-fighter, with amazing agility and a staff weapon, active since 1991.
* The Hanged Man – a ghostly figure who protects Shadow Hill, appearing as a floating apparition with a burlap sack over his head and a noose around his neck. He is active in Astro City since the 19th century and is rumored to have existed since at least the Middle Ages.
* M.P.H. a.k.a. The Acceleration Ace (Michael Hendrie) – super-speedster and member of Honor Guard. Besides his membership duties with Honor Guard, he operates in his home city of Detroit.
* Jack-in-the-Box (Zachary Johnson) – a clown-themed vigilante with no known powers but agility and an arsenal of clown and toy-inspired weaponry.

He also took 1999&#x27;s Harvey and 2000&#x27;s Eisner for Best Cover Artist, again for bodies of work including &quot;Astro City&quot;.

==Other media==
===Film===
In 2003, Ben Barenholtz, Jonathan Alpers and Busiek hoped to develop an &quot;Astro City&quot; movie, with Barenholtz as producer and Alpers as lead scripter, but the plans did not take off, whereupon Barenholtz subsequently took the project to Working Title Films. In July 2010, Working Title acquired the rights to make a live-action feature film adaptation of &quot;Astro City&quot;. Busiek was to write a script treatment, and also to executive-produce, along with Barenholtz and Alpers. In May 2013, Kurt Busiek said that Working Title&#x27;s option had lapsed but he was in negotiation with another party.

===Television===
In March 2018, FremantleMedia North America announced intentions to produce a live-action &quot;Astro City&quot; TV series with a pilot episode written by Busiek and Rick Alexander.

<text>Definitive Jux was a record label based in New York City. It was co-founded in 1999 by El-P and Amaechi Uzoigwe.

==History==
Definitive Jux was initially known as Def Jux. However, popular hip hop label Def Jam Recordings sued Def Jux over the name similarity in 2001. This lawsuit was settled out of court and the name was officially changed to Definitive Jux.

In February 2010, El-P announced that the label, although it will carry on selling its catalog and merchandise, would be put &quot;on hiatus&quot; as a traditional record label, and that it would be going through some changes in order to keep up with the evolution of the music industry. He also announced that he was stepping down as artistic director of Definitive Jux to focus on producing and being a full-time artist.

<doc id="593666" wikidata="Q60245" url="?curid=593666" title="Günther Prien">
<text>Günther Prien (16 January 1908 – presumed 8 March 1941) was a German U-boat commander during World War II. He was the first U-boat commander to receive the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross and the first member of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to receive the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves of Nazi Germany. It was Germany&#x27;s highest military decoration at the time of its presentation to Prien.

Under Prien&#x27;s command, the submarine was credited with sinking over 30 Allied ships totalling about , along with the British battleship at anchor in the Home Fleet&#x27;s anchorage in Scapa Flow.

==Early life and career==
Prien was one of three children of a judge and completed his basic education. At the age of five, Prien had been living with relatives, the notary Carl Hahn and his wife, in Lübeck. There he attended the Katharineum, a humanistic secondary school. After his parents separated, Prien moved with his mother and siblings to Leipzig where she eked out a living selling peasant lace. Prien joined the &quot;Handelsflotte&quot; (German merchant marine) in mid-1923 to ease the financial burden on his family. He applied to and joined the Finkenwerder–Hamburg Seaman&#x27;s School. After eight years of work and study as a seaman, rising from cabin boy on a sailing ship, Prien passed the required examinations and became the fourth officer on a passenger liner, the . Prien learned telegraphy, ship handling, leadership, and laws of the sea. In 1931 he became first mate and attended school for a commission. Prien received his sea master&#x27;s certificate in January 1932.
Unable to find work due to the severe contraction of the German shipping industry during the Great Depression, he was forced to turn to the &quot;Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst&quot; (&#x27;Voluntary Labour Service&#x27;, FAD). He earned a living dredging fields and digging ditches. Prien joined the Nazi Party in May 1932, but had to resign his membership upon joining the navy prior to Hitler&#x27;s ascent to power. His membership in the party cemented Prien&#x27;s image as a Nazi supporter, though his actions have been described as career advancing opportunism rather than genuine political conviction; one author wrote &quot;it is hard to determine his politics.&quot; However, Donald Macintyre described Prien as &quot;the most Nazified U-boat captain&quot;, &quot;an ardent ruthless Nazi&quot;. Prien applied to the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; in January 1933 when he found the navy was offering officer-candidate programs for merchant marine officers. He was integrated into the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; as a member of &quot;Crew 31&quot; (the incoming class of 1931), but had the age and experience of a 1926 class.

Prien received his military basic training in the 2nd company in the 2nd department of the standing ship division of the Baltic Sea in Stralsund (16 January 1933 – 31 March 1933). During this time he advanced in rank to &quot;Fähnrich zur See&quot; (naval cadet) on 1 March. He then attended the main cadet course at the Naval Academy Mürwik and various weapons courses for cadets at Kiel (1 April 1933 – 30 September 1934). From 1 October 1934 to 30 September 1935, Prien served as watch and division officer on the light cruiser &quot;Königsberg&quot;. On this assignment, he was promoted to &quot;Oberfähnrich zur See&quot; (senior midshipman) on 1 January 1935 and to &quot;Leutnant zur See&quot; (acting sub-lieutenant) on 1 April 1935. Prien then joined the U-boat training force. Prien attended the U-boat school in Kiel from 1 October 1935 to 30 April 1936. His training included a specialized U-boat torpedo course which was held on .

On 11 May 1936, Prien was appointed first Watch Officer on , serving under the command of Werner Hartmann after forming a bond at the training school. At Hartmann&#x27;s request Prien was assigned to his submarine, which served in the Spanish Civil War in 1937. Prien rose steadily in rank, from midshipman in 1933 to &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; (sub-lieutenant) on 1 January 1937. On 1 October 1937, Prien was ordered to the Germaniawerft, the shipbuilding works in Kiel, for construction training of the new Type VIIB . He commissioned &quot;U-47&quot; on 17 December 1938 which was part of the Wegener Flotilla. Prien was promoted to &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; (Captain lieutenant) on 1 February 1939.

Prien married in 1939 to Ingeborg; the couple had two children. Ingeborg Prien later married an &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; in the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; and changed her name to Inge Sturm-Prien.

==World War II==
World War II commenced during Prien&#x27;s first patrol in &quot;U-47&quot;, following the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939. Prien had departed Kiel on 19 August for a patrol lasting 28 days. On 5 September, he sank the British &quot;Bosnia&quot; of , the second ship of the war to be sunk by a U-boat. The prize regulations were in force at the time, so Prien was obliged to stop the ship. After identifying her as British he surfaced alongside her and fired a warning shot from the deck gun. The ship turned away to escape and it took six hits and a fire in her hold full of sulphur to bring it to a stop. Prien asked a passing neutral Norwegian ship to take the crew. The damaged ship was finished with a torpedo. His boat sank two British vessels, &quot;Rio Claro&quot; of on the 6th, and &quot;Gartavon&quot; of on the 7th. The sinkings were notable for Prien&#x27;s use of the deck gun, which was rare. &quot;U-47&quot; returned to Kiel on 15 September having sunk a total tonnage of . Prien was recalled by Dönitz to prevent all boats returning simultaneously leaving none on patrol.

===Second patrol: Scapa Flow===
On 1 October 1939, Karl Dönitz became a &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; (rear admiral) and &quot;Commander of the Submarines&quot; (&quot;Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote&quot;, &quot;BdU&quot;). Dönitz had been encouraged in operations against warships by the sinking of aircraft carrier &quot;Courageous&quot; in September 1939. On 28 September 1939 he said, &quot;it is not true Britain possesses the means to eliminate the U-boat menace.&quot; Dönitz was busy convincing Hitler of the need for 300 operational boats to achieve decisive success against Britain. Dönitz was attracted to the prospect of attacking the Royal Navy anchorage at Scapa Flow at the outbreak of war, to win a victory for his command. In World War I, two German submarines had tried and failed. Undaunted he ordered German submarine &quot;U-16&quot; to reconnoitre the region and requested &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; reconnaissance. From the air and sea reports Dönitz concluded that there was an 18-yard gap in the northeast entrance, between blockships sunk to bar the gap from Lamb Holm and the mainland. Dönitz selected Prien and &quot;U-47&quot; for the task. Prien was his favourite, and according to Dönitz &quot;possessed all the personal qualities and professional abilities required.&quot;

Prien left port to navigate the shallow North Sea on 8 October and did not brief his crew until mid-mission. He avoided all shipping and sat on the sea bed in daylight if possible. Prien approached Orkney in the evening of the 14 October. He surfaced four hours sailing time from the anchorage. While surfaced Prien observed the aurora borealis, which exposed the German submarine. In a post-patrol account Prien remarked it was &quot;disgustingly light&quot; and that – in his words – &quot;the whole bay is lit up&quot;. At 22:00 the Orkney navigation lights came on for thirty minutes which allowed Prien to fix his position. His watch officers spotted a merchant ship and Prien dived to avoid it, but shadowed the vessel and carried out a practice attack. Despite the presence of the lights he could not see the ship through the periscope. With visibility poor while submerged he decided to carry out the attack on the surface.

Prien pressed on and passed through the narrow entrance to the sound. He selected the wrong channel—between Lamb Holm and Burray—recognising the mistake in time. He disregarded Dönitz&#x27;s idea to pass south of the two blockships and instead sailed between the centre and northern block ship. The tide allowed the entry to be made rapidly. Prien and his crew were temporarily snared, or ran aground. Only by reversing at maximum revolutions did the U-boat free itself. &quot;U-47&quot; entered the Flow at 00:27. Prien and his watch officers found the anchorage to be empty. Eventually they spotted &quot;two battleships&quot;, in reality, just one; . The other was the seaplane tender &quot;Pegasus&quot;. Prien began the attack at 00:55 and concluded it at 01:28. He fired seven torpedoes, some of which failed or ran widely off target. Nevertheless, the battleship was struck by several of the second salvo and sank in 13 minutes. The sinking killed 835 of her crew, including Rear Admiral Henry Blagrove, commander of the 2nd Battle Squadron. At 02:15 &quot;U-47&quot; exited the Flow and ordered flank speed to escape. He logged in the war diary, &quot;a pity that only one was destroyed.&quot; Prien thought he had damaged the &quot;Repulse&quot; lying behind &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, but it was not present—the &quot;Pegasus&quot; was not hit. In the U-boat&#x27;s war diary at 02:15 he wrote, &quot;I still have five torpedoes for any merchant targets that come our way.&quot;

He returned to Germany on 17 October to instant fame. Prien and his crew were flown to Berlin aboard Hitler&#x27;s personal aircraft. At the Reich Chancellery the following day, Hitler awarded Prien the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross (). For Dönitz, the operation was a personal triumph. U-boat production did not increase immediately, but he had succeeded in securing Hitler&#x27;s attention. Nazi propaganda exploited the success and gloated over damaged British morale. The Home Fleet did not return to Scapa Flow until March 1940, until the entry points were closed and air defences improved. The fleet was moved to Loch Ewe, but on the way the battleship &quot;Nelson&quot; was damaged by a mine laid by &quot;U-31&quot;.

Purportedly Prien did not enjoy being a propaganda tool, but he cooperated with the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, and conferenced with Joseph Goebbels. The conference was unique in that it was the first time the Nazis showcased an individual military success. American journalist William L. Shirer met Prien but was not impressed by his lack of humility and wrote of Prien that he appeared &quot;cocky&quot; and a &quot;fanatical Nazi.&quot; The story that Prien had simply followed a ship into the harbour was rightly disbelieved; Prien said nothing of his route in. Prien wrote a book of his experiences during the war, &quot;Mein Weg Nach Scapa Flow&quot; (My way to Scapa Flow), released in the autumn, 1940. One historian wrote, &quot;for a story of potentially high propaganda value, it is told with striking restraint.&quot; The media compensated for this apparent modesty. The &quot;Illustrierter Beobachter&quot; lionised Prien. It provided plenty of images of Prien, his crew and Hitler, exalting him as a hero. These sentiments were picked up and spread throughout Germany by other state-controlled media outlets.

Prien received the nickname &quot;Der Stier von Scapa Flow&quot; (&quot;The Bull of Scapa Flow&quot;); the emblem of a snorting bull was painted on the conning tower of &quot;U-47&quot; and soon became the emblem of the entire 7th U-boat Flotilla. The reason, given by 1st watch officer Engelbert Endrass for this, was the sight of Prien&#x27;s demeanour as U-47 entered Scapa Flow, &quot;his frowning face and hunched shoulders reminded him of a bull in a ring.&quot; All U-boats had their number removed from the conning tower in wartime, and commanding officers often applied their own motifs. Two members of the Scapa Flow crew earned the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross during World War II: the chief engineer (&quot;Leitender Ingenieur&quot;) Johann-Friedrich Wessels and 1st watch officer (I. &quot;Wachoffizier&quot;) Engelbert Endrass.

Kept secret by the German naval command was the fact that Prien had fired a total of seven G7e torpedoes at his target; only one from the first salvo hit the target and exploded on the bow, near the anchor chain. The stern torpedo also failed to hit or detonate. The second salvo did strike and explode. The navy had long-standing problems with their depth, steering and their magnetic detonator systems. These problems continued to bedevil the German submariners for a long time. In 2002, part of a torpedo fired during the attack resurfaced near to an anchored tanker. The warhead had detached but the missile contained compressed air necessitating its destruction by a bomb disposal team.

The historian Riederer argues that &quot;Sonderunternehmen P&quot; (Special Operation P), the codename for the attack on Scapa Flow, was very likely predominantly motivated by Nazi propaganda. Following World War I, the German High Seas Fleet was interned at Scapa Flow under the terms of the Armistice whilst negotiations took place over the fate of the ships. Fearing that all the ships would be seized and divided amongst the Allies, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter decided to scuttle the fleet. Whilst the internment was considered a national humiliation by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, the scuttling of the fleet was romanticised as an act ridding the navy of the shame associated with the Kiel mutiny of 3 November 1918. The NS-propaganda spread the interpretation that Prien&#x27;s success at Scapa Flow turned the symbolic triumph of scuttling the fleet, and had finally rid the older generation from the Scapa Flow traumata.

===Third patrol===
&quot;U-47&quot; under the command of Prien with 1st watch officer (I. WO) &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Engelbert Endrass and chief engineer &quot;Oberleutnant (Ing.)&quot; Johann-Friedrich Wessels left Kiel on 16 November 1939. &quot;U-47&quot; attacked a British cruiser on 28 November 1939. Prien had identified the ship to be a &quot;London&quot;-class cruiser. Prien intended to launch a spread of three torpedoes, but only a single torpedo cleared the tube and detonated in the wake of the cruiser. When the periscope cleared the surface, Prien observed what he believed major damage to the stern of the cruiser, her starboard torpedo launchers dislodged and an aircraft tilted. &quot;U-47&quot; surfaced and tried to pursue the cruiser but was driven off by depth charges dropped from the escort. It turned out the cruiser was which was not damaged by the detonation. The war diary of the &quot;Befehlshaber der U-Boote&quot; (BdU) on 17 December 1939 stated that even though a hit was observed the cruiser was not sunk, but German propaganda broadcast that &quot;The bull of Scapa Flow&quot; had sunk the cruiser. Upon inquiry from the Admiralty, &quot;Norfolk&quot; reported herself undamaged; she thought the explosion in her wake had been an aircraft bomb.

On 5 December 1939, &quot;U-47&quot; spotted nine merchant vessels escorted by five destroyers. At 14:40, Prien fired one torpedo. &quot;U-47&quot; continued to attack Allied shipping in the Western Approaches, however eight out of twelve G7e &quot;U-47&quot; carried, failed to detonate either missing or malfunctioning. On 18 December 1939, &quot;U-47&quot; returned to Kiel via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. The claims made by Prien are noted in the war diary of the BdU on 17 December 1939:
# steamer of unknown origin 
# Norwegian tanker 
# Dutch tanker 
for a total of plus one British warship damaged, while the actual tonnage was only . Three ships were confirmed sunk. The identity of the vessels were &quot;SS Navasota&quot; from OB 46 south of Fastnet was the first, tanker &quot;MV Britta&quot; south of Longships Lighthouse, and finally &quot;Tanjandoen&quot; south-southeast of The Lizard. From convoy OB 46, 37 sailors died aboard &quot;SS Navasota&quot;, another 45 were rescued by other merchant vessels &quot;Escapade&quot; and &quot;Clan Farquhar&quot;. &quot;Louis Scheid&quot; rescued 62 men from &quot;Tanjandoen&quot;, but six perished. &quot;Britta&quot; lost six men, a Belgian ship rescued 25.

===Fourth patrol===
Prien&#x27;s fourth patrol started on 29 February 1940 from Kiel. The former 1st watch officer Endrass had been replaced by &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Hans-Werner Kraus. On this patrol, &quot;U-47&quot; headed for the North Sea, the Shetland Islands and the Orkney Islands. On 1 March, &quot;U-47&quot; arrived in Heligoland for a four-day stop. Back at sea again on 11 March, &quot;U-47&quot; sank the &quot;Britta&quot; on 25 March. &quot;U-47&quot; returned to Wilhelmshaven again on 29 March, ending this patrol. The ship was torpedoed without warning northwest of Sule Skerry. 13 men died and five were rescued by the Danish ship &quot;Nancy&quot;.

Torpedo failures still afflicted the U-boat fleet but the number of sinkings rose in the first months of 1940. U-boat commanders, determined to enter the ranks of &quot;aces&quot; such as Prien, were prepared to take greater risks, most often attacking at night on the surface—the Admiralty noted that by February 1940 these reached 58 percent.

===Fifth patrol: &quot;Weserübung&quot;===
In April 1940 the OKM planned Operationsbefehl Hartmut to support Operation Weserübung, the invasions of Denmark and Norway. The purpose was to provide seaborne protection for the German amphibious landings on Norway&#x27;s large coast line from the Royal Navy and French Navy. The German surface fleet could not fight a large-scale surface action against the British and win. Dönitz hoped the U-boats could compensate for this weakness. The faulty G7e torpedo rendered the German submarine fleet useless for the duration of &quot;Weserübung&quot;. The failure of torpedoes was a factor in the German naval defeat in the Battles of Narvik.

Prien formed part of a group patrolling east of the Shetland Islands, Vagsfjord and Trondheim. &quot;U-47&quot; left Wilhelmhaven on its fifth patrol on 3 April, which ended on 26 April in Kiel. Prien&#x27;s 1st watch officer was again &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Kraus. The boat formed part of a 28-strong fleet, practically the entire operational force, committed to waters off the Norwegian and British coast. The German operation attracted an immediate counterattack by the Royal Navy, intense battles were fought at Narvik. The BdU&#x27;s opposition, the Royal Navy Submarine Service, achieved some success: the &quot;Karlsruhe&quot; was crippled and scuttled off Kristiansand.

Prien succeeded in penetrating an Allied-held anchorage again at Vagsfjord fjord. Prien counted three large and three small transport ships, two cruisers, all slightly overlapping—he described it as a &quot;wall of ships&quot;. Prien fired eight torpedoes, but none hit. The first four were fired at two of the large transports and two cruisers under the cover of darkness from ranges of 750–1,500 metres. Unable to explain the failure, Prien surfaced after no discernible action was taken by the British. He went over the torpedoes and firing control data personally before another four-missile salvo was fired. The same result was observed. The torpedoes either missed, failed to detonate or struck rocks after running off course. While on manoeuvres to fire his stern torpedo on the surface, he ran aground damaging his starboard diesel engine as he attempted to break free. He could not wait for high tide to assist while within range of British guns, and daybreak, he noted, was only hours away. His crew eventually rocked the U-boat loose and &quot;U-47&quot; escaped.

On the way home Prien intercepted the battleship &quot;Warspite&quot; on 19 April. He stalked her and fired two torpedoes with the same result—one exploded at the end of its run, alerting the escorts which counterattacked with depth charges. A convoy was sighted later, but Prien did not bother attacking; he had lost faith in his main weapons. Prien angrily signalled Dönitz to tell him they had been sent into battle with &quot;wooden rifles.&quot; A full report was made by Prien: &quot;we found ourselves equipped with a torpedo which refused to function in northern waters either with contact or magnetic pistols. To all intents and purposes, the, U-boats were without a weapon.&quot; The report was crushing to Dönitz.

The commander-in-chief of U-boats conceded of the U-boat operation, &quot;I doubt whether men have ever had to rely on such a useless weapon.&quot; In no fewer than 40 attacks on Allied warships, not a single sinking was achieved. Dönitz appealed to Erich Raeder, and he was forced to agree on the hopeless situation. He ordered all but three submarines to port. The remaining trio were ordered to continue reconnaissance patrols.

===Sixth patrol===
On his sixth war patrol (3 June – 6 July 1940), Prien intercepted Convoy HX 47, part of the HX convoys. This patrol, again Kraus served as 1st watch officer, started and ended in Kiel and targeted the shipping routes in the North Atlantic and the Bay of Biscay west of the English Channel.

Prien was a Wolfpack leader and made the tactical decisions for this patrol line. Wolfpack Prien planned to attack HX 47, west of Lorient prior to its rendezvous with its home–home bound escort. He sank the ship &quot;Balmoralwood&quot;. The merchant had fallen behind. The ship carried 8,730 tons of wheat and four aircraft.

The &quot;San Fernando&quot; from HX 49 was sunk on 21 June. The ship carried 13,500 tons of crude oil and 4,200 tons of fuel oil; all the crew appear to have survived the sinking. The patrol yielded another six ships sunk. The most notable victim was the passenger liner &quot;Arandora Star&quot;, sunk west of the Aran Islands. The 14-year old ship sank with heavy loss of life. It was transporting hundreds of German and Italian internees to Canada. Of the approximately 1,300 people, 200 guards, and 174 crew on board, 805 died. The BdU credited Prien with ten ships sunk totalling . This made Prien&#x27;s sixth war patrol the most successful U-boat operation to date.

===Seventh patrol===
&quot;U-47&quot; remained in Kiel until 27 August 1940 when it sortied again. The 1st watch officer on Prien&#x27;s seventh patrol was again Kraus. Upon the conclusion of the patrol, which had taken &quot;U-47&quot; into the North Atlantic west of the Hebrides, Prien was ordered to the U-boat base at Lorient, in occupied France where it arrived on 26 September 1940. The Battle of France and the occupation of the Atlantic coast afforded the BdU bases. They allowed German submarines to strike deeper into the Atlantic and spend much longer on patrol.

Prien accounted for the destruction of six ships plus a further vessel damaged. His largest victim was &quot;Titan&quot;, over from convoy OA 207. Prien lost one man overboard during the patrol. 89 men survived and six were killed. His greatest success was against the large Convoy SC 2. He attacked and claimed four ships sunk after &quot;U-65&quot; led him to the scene. The attacks were carried out on the surface in dark Atlantic night during poor weather. &quot;U-28&quot; sank another ship, but Otto Kretschmer in &quot;U-99&quot; failed. Dönitz was disappointed, it was not the annihilation battle he hoped for. Dönitz ordered Prien to act as a weather-boat at a point 23° west, mainly for &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; air fleets engaged in the Battle of Britain.

The signals from the 53-strong convoy were decoded on 30 August which gave the time, position and arrival times enabling the BdU to order Prien and a Wolfpack into action. Prien had known where to search. Dönitz and the BdU were reading Admiralty codes and this information had been passed to Prien. The information led to the sinking of &quot;Ville de Mons&quot; in ten minutes. All but one of the crew were saved. The captain reported the sighting of three U-boats, two of which approached him and asked for his ship&#x27;s identity. They were eventually rescued by an Allied merchant ship. The U-boats were forced to abandon the attack when a Short Sunderland appeared and they lost contact with the convoy.

Prien formed part of a Wolfpack that attacked Convoy HX 72. While searching for the previous convoy they ran into HX 72. While the operation was a German success, Prien damaged only one ship with his only remaining torpedo. Six ships were sunk by other U-boats. The Germans waited for the sole escort, &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; to turn away. Prien maintained contact to guide &quot;U-29&quot;, &quot;U-43&quot;, &quot;U-46&quot;, &quot;U-48&quot; and &quot;U-65&quot; into attack. 12 ships were sunk from the convoy amounting to . On the patrol Prien sank of shipping, with another 5,156 damaged. On 21 September &quot;U-48&quot; relieved Prien on shadowing duties.

===Eighth patrol: Oak Leaves===
Prien took &quot;U-47&quot; on its eighth war patrol on 14 October 1940, the last with Kraus as 1st watch officer, patrolling the sea routes in the North Atlantic, from the North Channel to Rockall. A five-strong U-boat pack that were too far away to tackle Convoy SC 7 was called into assist. Prien, who was trying to reach SC 7, formed a wolfpack with &quot;U-28&quot;, &quot;U-38&quot;, &quot;U-48&quot; and &quot;U-100&quot;. Convoy HX 79 was spotted by &quot;U-47&quot; in the morning of the 19 October, just as its 10-ship anti-submarine escort arrived. Only &quot;U-28&quot; failed to get into an attack position by evening. On 20 October 1940, Prien attacked Convoy HX 79 and sank the transports &quot;La Estancia&quot;, &quot;Bilderdijk&quot; and &quot;Wandby&quot;. &quot;Shirak&quot; is also believed to have been sunk by Prien and his crew in the battle. When added to Prien&#x27;s hits, the Focke-Wulf Fw 200s of I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 40 increased the tally to 12 ships sunk.

While at sea, Prien received the message on 21 October that he had been awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves () the day before. He was the fifth member of the Wehrmacht and first of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to be so honored. &quot;U-47&quot; returned to Lorient on 23 October.

Heinz Rühmann, Hans Brausewetter and Josef Sieber sang a persiflage of the 1939 song &quot;Das kann doch einen Seemann nicht erschüttern&quot; (&quot;That won&#x27;t shake a sailor&quot;), written by Michael Jary from the film &quot;Paradies der Junggesellen&quot;—&quot;Bachelor&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, on occasion of the Oak Leaves presentation to Prien. The reworded lyrics are &quot;Das muss den ersten Seelord doch erschüttern&quot; (&quot;That must shake the First Sea Lord&quot;, alluding to Winston Churchill). The lyrics also refer to Neville Chamberlain and mock the song &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; by adapting an English phrase into German: &quot;die Waves zu rulen ist jetzt schluß&quot; (&quot;the rule of the waves is over&quot;).

===Ninth patrol===
The ninth war patrol began on 3 November 1940 from Lorient and took &quot;U-47&quot; to the North Atlantic, west of the North Channel. After 34 days at sea, &quot;U-47&quot; returned to Lorient on 6 December. On this patrol, Prien damaged the &quot;Gonçalo Velho&quot; on 8 November, and sank the &quot;Ville d&#x27;Arlon&quot; and damaged &quot;Conch&quot; on 2 December 1940. The tanker survived Prien&#x27;s attack, then withstood a three torpedo salvo from &quot;U-95&quot;. The ship finally sank after a single torpedo from Otto Kretschmer&#x27;s &quot;U-99&quot;.

===Tenth patrol and death===
On 20 February 1941, &quot;U-47&quot; departed from Lorient on its tenth and final war patrol. Prien located well south of the main wolfpack concentrations. He intercepted and repeatedly attacked convoy OB 290. The solitary attacks sank two ships. Prien continued to pursue the convoy but did not succeed again. West of Ireland, Fw 200s sank seven ships from this convoy making it the most successful intervention of German aircraft in the Atlantic. The success of the Fw 200s, well out to sea, depredations of U-boat concentrations between Iceland and Britain simultaneously with Operation Berlin, in which battleships &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; cruised the convoy lanes was an anxious and operationally complex period for the German Admiralty.

&quot;U-47&quot; went missing after intercepting Convoy OB 293 on 7 March. His attack prompted a five-hour chase from 00:23 on 8 March. At 05:19 Prien was caught on the surface and dived but could not escape the rapid depth charge attack from the escorts. &quot;U-47&quot; has generally been thought to have been sunk by the British destroyer west of Ireland; the submarine was attacked by &quot;Wolverine&quot; and , which took turns covering each other&#x27;s ASDIC blind spots and dropping patterns of depth charges until &quot;U-47&quot; rose almost to the surface before sinking and then exploded with an orange flash visible from the surface. Other British reports of the action mention a large red glow appearing deep below the surface amid the depth charge explosions.

To date, there is no official record of what happened to &quot;U-47&quot; or her 45 crewmen, though a variety of possibilities exists, including mines, a mechanical failure, falling victim to her own torpedoes, and possibly a later attack that did not confirm any kills by the corvette team of and . Posthumously on 18 March, Prien was promoted to &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; (corvette captain/lieutenant commander), effective as of 1 March 1941.

Prien&#x27;s death was kept secret until 23 May. Churchill had personally announced it to the House of Commons, and propaganda broadcasts to Germany had repeatedly taunted listeners with the question &quot;Where is Prien?&quot; until Germany was forced to acknowledge his loss. The announcement was made in the &quot;Wehrmachtbericht&quot; on 24 May 1941 stating: &quot;The U-boat under the command of &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Günter Prien did not return from his last patrol against the enemy. The loss of the boat has to be assumed.&quot; The importance of Prien was known to the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. To offset the negative impact his death might have on the German population, the message was hidden among the information about the tonnage sunk by U-boats.

==Commemoration and in popular culture==
According to one biographer, in contrast with Kretschmer, Prien was purportedly a strict disciplinarian who rarely allowed humanity to compromise or interfere with the running of his boat. His crew despised him for it. He harboured much bitterness because of his difficult beginning. He could be genial among fellow officers but his reputation among subordinates was low.

The 1958 war film &quot;U 47 – Kapitänleutnant Prien&quot;, directed by Harald Reinl, was loosely based on Prien&#x27;s combat record and command of &quot;U-47&quot;. Prien was portrayed by the German actor Dieter Eppler. Prien was portrayed by Werner Klemperer in the 1957 US TV series &quot;The Silent Service&quot; in the episode, &quot;The U-47 in Scapa Flow&quot;.

Prien was a subject of a hagiographic 1981 account by German author Franz Kurowski, &quot;Günther Prien, der Wolf und sein Admiral&quot; (&quot;Günther Prien, the Wolf and his Admiral&quot;). The German scholar classifies Kurowski&#x27;s book, published by extreme right-wing publisher , as an &quot;almost perfect example of a skillful distillation of the Nazi understanding of the Second World War&quot;. The Canadian historian Michael Hadley commented on the narrative&#x27;s goals as follows: 
Here he [Kurowski] wished to commemorate the &quot;meritorious soldier and human being Günther Prien [who is] forgotten neither by the old submariners nor&quot; —and this would have startled most observers in Germany today [in 1995] —&quot;by the young submariners of the Federal German Navy&quot;.

The West German navy, at the time named the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; (Federal Navy), had considered Prien as namesake for the 1967 commissioned guided missile destroyer &quot;Lütjens&quot;. However the legend surrounding Prien, that he had distanced himself from Nazism and had become an active member of the German resistance and was held captive at the &quot;Wehrmachtgefängnis Torgau&quot; (Torgau Wehrmacht Prison), turned out to be false. Consequently, the name &quot;Lütjens&quot;, named after Admiral Günther Lütjens, was chosen instead.

The street &quot;Günther-Prien-Straße&quot; in Schönberg, Plön, is named after him.

==Summary of career==
According to Busch and Röll, Prien sailed on ten war patrols and sank 30 commercial ships of , one warship with a displacement of , and damaged eight commercial ships for and one warship of . According to Blair, the one warship of 10,035 long tons, the heavy cruiser &quot;Norfolk&quot; was not damaged.

<doc id="593675" wikidata="Q271108" url="?curid=593675" title="Optimates and populares">
<text>Optimates (, ; Latin for &quot;best ones&quot;; ) and populares (; Latin for &quot;supporters of the people&quot;; ) are labels applied to politicians, political groups, traditions, strategies, or ideologies in the late Roman Republic. There is &quot;heated academic discussion&quot; as to whether Romans would have recognised an ideological content or political split in the label.

Among other things, &quot;optimates&quot; have been seen as supporters of the continued authority of the senate, politicians who operated mostly in the senate, or opponents of the &quot;populares&quot;. The &quot;populares&quot; have also been seen as focusing on operating before the popular assemblies, generally in opposition to the senate, using &quot;the populace, rather than the senate, as a means [for advantage]&quot;. References to &quot;optimates&quot; (also called &quot;boni&quot;, &quot;good men&quot;) and &quot;populares&quot; are found among the writings of Roman authors of the 1st century BC. The distinction between the terms is most clearly established in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Pro Sestio&quot;, a speech given and published in 56 BC, where he framed the two labels against each other.

With the publication of the &quot;Römische Geschichte&quot; in the 1850s, the German historian Theodor Mommsen set the enduring and popular interpretation that &quot;optimates&quot; and &quot;populares&quot; represented political parties, which he implicitly compared to the German liberal and conservative parties of his own day. Mommsen&#x27;s paradigm, however, has been criticised by generations of historians, first by Friedrich Münzer, followed by Ronald Syme, who considered that Roman politics was marked by familial and individual ambitions, not parties. Other historians have pointed to the impossibility of applying such labels to many individuals, who could pretend to be &quot;popularis&quot; or &quot;optimas&quot; as they saw fit; the careers of Drusus or Pompey are for example impossible to fit into one &quot;party&quot;. Ancient usage was also far from clear: even Cicero, while linking &quot;optimates&quot; to Greek &quot;aristokratia&quot; (&quot;ἀριστοκρατία&quot;), also used the word &quot;populares&quot; to describe politics &quot;completely compatible with... honourable aristocratic behaviour&quot;.

As a result, modern historians do not recognise any &quot;coherent political party&quot; under either &quot;populares&quot; or &quot;optimates&quot;, nor do those labels lend themselves easily to comparison with a modern left–right split. Democratic interpretations of Roman politics, however, have pushed for a re-evaluation which attributes an ideological tendency – e.g. &quot;populares&quot; believing in popular sovereignty – to the labels.

== Meaning ==
With the publication of the &quot;Römische Geschichte&quot; in the 1850s, the German historian Theodor Mommsen set the enduring and popular interpretation that &quot;optimates&quot; and &quot;populares&quot; represented aristocratic and democratic parliamentary-style political parties, with the labels emerging around the time of the Gracchi. His interpretation &quot;owe[d] much to nineteenth century German liberal thought&quot;. Classicists today, however, generally agree that neither &quot;optimate&quot; or &quot;popularis&quot; referred to political parties: &quot;It is common knowledge nowadays that &quot;populares&quot; did not constitute a coherent political group or &#x27;party&#x27; (even less so than their counterparts, &quot;optimates&quot;)&quot;. 

Unlike in modern times, Roman politicians stood for office on the basis of their personal reputations and qualities rather than with a party manifesto or platform. For example, the opposition to the First Triumvirate failed to act as a united front with coherent coordination of its members, acting instead on an ad hoc basis with regular defections to and from those opposing the political alliance depending on the topic of debate, personal relations, etc. These ad hoc alliances and many different methods of gaining political influence meant there were no &quot;neat categories of &quot;optimates&quot; and &quot;populares&quot;&quot; or of conservatives and radicals in a modern sense. Erich S Gruen, for example, in &quot;Last Generation of the Roman Republic&quot; (1974) rejected both &quot;populares&quot; and &quot;optimates&quot;, saying &quot;such labels obscure rather than enlighten&quot; and arguing that &quot;optimates&quot; was used not as a political label, but instead used to praise a member of the political elite.

Moving away from the 19th century view of political parties or factions vying for dominance, the scope of the modern academic debate focuses on whether the terms referred to an ideological split among aristocrats or whether the terms were meaningless or topics of debate themselves.

=== &quot;Optimates&quot; ===
The traditional view of the &quot;optimates&quot; refers to aristocrats who defended their own material and political interests and behaved akin to modern fiscal conservatives in opposing wealth redistribution and supporting small government. To that end, the &quot;optimates&quot; were viewed traditionally as emphasising the authority or influence of the senate over other organs of the states, including the popular assemblies. In other instances, the &quot;optimates&quot; are defined &quot;somewhat mechanically, as those who opposed the &quot;populares&quot;&quot;. 

This definition relying on a &quot;senatorial&quot; party or fiscal conservatives breaks down at a closer reading of the evidence. A &quot;senatorial&quot; party describes no meaningful split, as basically all active politicians were senators.

A definition to the terms based on whether a politician supported land redistribution or grain subsidies runs into two issues. Such measures were not &quot;the sole preserve of the so-called populares&quot; and &quot;were not per se incompatible with traditional senatorial policy, given the extensive colonisation the senate had overseen in the past and the grain provision which members of the elite occasionally organised on a private basis&quot;. Moreover, identifying the &quot;populares&quot; based on the policies they supported in office would place politicians traditionally identified as belonging to one &quot;faction&quot; into the &quot;opposite&quot; camp:

* Publius Sulpicius Rufus, one of the classic &quot;populares&quot;, supported policies that had little &quot;to do with the betterment of the &quot;populus&quot; and in fact appear to have been distinctly unpopular&quot;.
* Marcus Livius Drusus, brought agrarian reform laws with the support of the senate, giving his policies a &quot;popularis&quot; tone, even when senatorial support and agrarian reforms are supposedly dichotomous.
* Cato the Younger, traditionally identified as &quot;the&quot; &quot;optimate&quot;, becomes &quot;popularis&quot; for supporting expansion of the grain dole during his tribunate.
* Sulla, traditionally identified also as an arch-conservative, turns &quot;popularis&quot; for &quot;probably confiscat[ing] and redistribut[ing] more land in Italy than any other Roman politician&quot;.
* And Julius Caesar, traditionally seen as &quot;popularis&quot; (though never self-identifying with that label in his extant texts), emerges as an &quot;optimate&quot; for &quot;substantially reduc[ing] the number of grain recipients in Rome during his dictatorship&quot;.

Other proposed views of &quot;optimates&quot; are that they were leaders of the senate or those acting with the support of the senate. Mouritsen in &quot;Politics in the Roman Republic&quot; (2017) rejects both of the traditional definitions. Of &quot;optimates&quot; being those with the support of the senate:

Usage of the term by contemporaries also was not highly dichotomised. &quot;Optimate&quot; was used generically to refer to the wealthy classes in Rome as well as the aristocracies of foreign cities or states: 

=== &quot;Populares&quot; ===
References to &quot;populares&quot; in scholarship today &quot;do not imply a co-ordinated &#x27;party&#x27; with a distinctive ideological character, a kind of political grouping for which there is no evidence in Rome, but simply allude to a... type of senator&quot; who is &quot;at least at that moment acting as the people&#x27;s man&quot;. This is in contrast to the 19th century view of the &quot;populares&quot; from Mommsen, in which they are a group of aristocrats which supported democracy and the rights and material interests of the common people. 

The highly influential view of Christian Meier redefined the &quot;popularis&quot; as a label for a senator using the popular assemblies&#x27; law-making powers to overrule decisions of the senate, primarily as a political tactic to get ahead in Roman politics. In this view, a &quot;populares&quot; politician is a person who:

[adopts] a certain method of political working, to use the populace, rather than the senate, as a means to an end; the end being, most likely, personal advantage for the politician concerned.

==== &quot;Ratio popularis&quot; ====
The &quot;ratio popularis&quot;, or strategy of putting political questions before the people writ large, was pursued when politicians were unable to achieve their goals through the normal process in the senate. This was in part structural: the &quot;dyadic nature of [the senate and people of Rome, ie the republic] meant that when a senator opposed his peers... there was only recourse available&quot; to the people. This political method involved a populist style of rhetoric, and &quot;only to a limited extent, that of policy&quot; with even less ideological content. 

The content of &quot;popularis&quot; legislation was tied to the fact that politicians choosing to go before the people required needed strong support therefrom to overrule the decision of the senate. This forced politicians choosing a popular strategy to include policies that directly benefited voters in the assemblies, such as debt relief, land redistribution, and grain doles. The earlier &quot;popularis&quot; tactics of Tiberius Gracchus reflected the dominance of rural voters who had resettled to Rome recently, while the later &quot;popularis&quot; tactics of Clodius reflected the interests of the masses of urban poor. 

Material interests like corn subsidy bills were not the whole of &quot;popularis&quot; causes: &quot;popularis&quot; politicians also may have made arguments on the proper role of the Assemblies in the Roman state (ie, a popular sovereignty) rather than just questions of material interests. Other benefits proposed attempted to empower supporters in the popular assemblies, with introduction of secret ballot, restoration of tribunician rights after Sulla&#x27;s dictatorship, promotion of non-senators onto juries before the law courts, and the general election of priests. All of these empowered non-senatorial supporters broadly, including both the wealthy &quot;equites&quot; and the poor urban population in Rome.

==== Ideological view ====
One of the larger issues in modern scholarship is whether the politicians who operated in the &quot;ratio popularis&quot; actually believed in their proposals, scepticism of which &quot;certainly seems well warranted in many cases&quot;.

A democratic interpretation of Roman politics neatly complements an ideological revival by interpreting Roman politicians to vie for popular support at an ideological, but not factional, level. This link, however, remains tenuous, as &quot;candidates apparently never ran on specific policies or associated themselves with particular ideologies during their campaign[s]&quot;. Moreover, speculation as to the inner motivations of Roman politicians cannot be substantiated one way or the other, as the inner thoughts of the Roman elite are almost entirely lost. Even the apparent deaths suffered by &quot;popularis&quot; tribunes cannot be accepted at face value: initial intentions are not final outcomes, it is unlikely that those who followed a &quot;popularis&quot; path expected death.

Mackie argued that &quot;popularis&quot; politicians had an ideological bent towards criticising the senate&#x27;s legitimacy, focusing on the sovereign powers of the popular assemblies, criticising the senate for neglecting common interests, and accusing the senate of administering the state corruptly. She added that &quot;populares&quot; advocated for the popular assemblies to take control of the republic, phrasing demands in terms of &quot;libertas&quot;, referring to popular sovereignty and the power of the Roman assemblies to create law. T. P. Wiseman argues, further, that these differences reflected &quot;rival ideologies&quot; with &quot;mutually incompatible [views on] what the republic was&quot;.

This democratic interpretation did not imply a party structure, instead focusing on motivations and policies. Scholars of the late republic have not reached a consensus as to whether Roman politicians really were divided in these terms. Nor does an ideological approach explain the traditional identification of certain politicians (eg Publius Sulpicius Rufus) as &quot;popularis&quot; when the policies they advanced were only weakly connected to the welfare of the Roman voter. Robb argues, moreover, that the premise of the label, ie that a certain person or policy benefits the people write large, is of little use: &quot;the principle of acting in the popular interest was a central one that all politicians would claim to be following&quot;.

=== In rhetoric ===

The &quot;constitutional framework in which politicians operated automatically turned policy disagreements into rhetorical contests between &quot;populus&quot; and aristocracy&quot;: tribunes which were unable to secure the support of their peers in the senate would naturally go before the people; to justify this they turned to stock arguments for popular sovereignty; opponents would then bring out similar stock arguments for senatorial authority. Young Roman politicians also turned regularly to controversial rhetoric or policies in an attempt to build their name recognition and stand out from the mass of other political candidates in their short one-year terms, with few apparent negative impacts on their longer-term career prospects.

&quot;Popularis&quot; rhetoric was couched &quot;in terms of the consensus of values at Rome at the time: &quot;libertas&quot;, &quot;leges&quot;, &quot;mos maiorum&quot;, and senatorial incompetence at governing the &quot;res publica&quot;&quot;. In public speeches during the republic, legislative disagreements did not emerge in party-political terms: &quot;from the rostra... neither the opponents of Tiberius Gracchus, nor Catulus against Gabinius, nor Bibulus against Caesar, nor Cato against Trebonius even so much as suggested that their advice to the was predicated on an &#x27;optimate&#x27; policy based on a different arrangement of political ends and means from those of the &#x27;popular&#x27; advocates of a bill... there was, it seems, virtually no place on the rostra for ideological bifurcation&quot;. For the Roman in the street, political debate was not related to party affiliations, but the issue and proposer itself: &quot;Is the proposer of this agrarian (or frumentary, etc.) law really championing our interests, as he avows, or is he rather pursuing some private benefit for himself or something else behind the scenes?&quot; which naturally flowed into the themes of personal credibility that recur in republican public rhetoric.

Like most Roman rhetoric, &quot;popularis&quot; rhetoric also drew heavily on historical precedents (&quot;exempla&quot;) – including that from ancient times, such as the revival of the &quot;comitia Centuriata&quot; as a popular law court, – from the abolition of the Roman monarchy to the popular rights and liberties won by the secession of the plebs. &quot;Popularis&quot; rhetoric surrounding secret ballots and land reform were not framed in terms of innovations, but rather, in terms of preserving and restoring the birth-right liberty of the citizenry. And &quot;populares&quot; too could hijack traditionally &quot;optimate&quot; themes by criticising &quot;current&quot; senators for failing to live up to the examples of their ancestors, acting in ways which would in the long run harm the authority of the senate, or framing their own arguments in fiscal responsibility.

Both putative groups agreed on core values such as Roman liberty and the fundamental sovereignty of the Roman people; even those who were supporting the senate at some time or another would not be able to wholly discount the traditional sovereignty attributed to the people. Furthermore, much of the perceived difference between &quot;optimates&quot; and &quot;populares&quot; emerged from rhetorical flourishes unsupported by policy: &quot;no matter how emphatically the people’s interests and &#x27;sovereignty&#x27; may have been asserted, the republic never saw any concrete attempts to change the nature of Roman society or shift the balance of power&quot;.

== Usage by ancient Romans ==
Beyond the modern usage of the two terms in classical studies to refer to the putative political parties, the terms also emerge from the Latin literature of the period. 

In Latin, the word &quot;popularis&quot; is normally used outside the works of Cicero to mean &quot;compatriot&quot; or &quot;fellow citizen&quot;. The word also could be used pejoratively to refer to populists or politicians pandering to the people, politicians with great personal popularity, politicians who were ostensibly acting in the peoples&#x27; interest, and actions before crowds of the people.

The word &quot;optimates&quot;, while infrequent in the surviving canon, is also used to refer to aristocrats or the aristocracy as a whole.

=== Cicero ===
In Cicero&#x27;s letters – rather than his forensic speeches – he used it generally to refer to popularity. In Cicero&#x27;s philosophical works, it was used to refer to &quot;the majority of the people&quot; and to describe &quot;the style of speech most useful for public speaking&quot;.

The oppositional meaning between &quot;populares&quot; and &quot;optimates&quot; emerges mainly from Cicero&#x27;s drawing of a distinction between the two in his speech &quot;Pro Sestio&quot;, a speech made to defend a friend instrumental in recalling Cicero from exile by his political enemy Clodius. Cicero&#x27;s use of the term, that &quot;&quot;populares&quot; aim to please the multitude&quot;, is recognised to be polemical. His remarks that &quot;popularis&quot; tactics emerged from a failure to win the support of the senate and of personal grievances with the senate are also &quot;equally suspect&quot;. Cicero&#x27;s usage in that speech draws a distinction between &quot;optimates&quot; who &quot;are honourable, honest, and upright... [and] safeguard the interests of the state and the liberty of its citizens&quot; with &quot;populares&quot; who are not so honourable and instead engage in failed attempts to cultivate demagoguery. Cicero&#x27;s description of Clodius as &quot;popularis&quot; &quot;concentrates on the demagogic sense of the word, rather than risking attack on the rights of the people&quot;.

Mouritsen writes of Cicero in &quot;Pro Sestio&quot;:

Cicero’s bold rhetorical self-reinvention in the &quot;Pro Sestio&quot; has presented historians with a deceptively simple model which at first sight seems to provide a key to unlocking the secrets of Roman politics. But the terminology Cicero uses turns out to be unique and unlike anything else found in the ancient sources... We are therefore not dealing with an observable phenomenon for which the &quot;Pro Sestio&quot; happens to offer a convenient label. Rather, it is the other way round: Cicero’s use of &quot;popularis&quot; in that particular speech has reified what would otherwise have remained discrete difficult-to-classify events and individuals and turned them into manifestations of a single political movement.

Cicero, however, did not always use the word this way. During his consulship, he &quot;stak[ed] his own claim to being &quot;popularis&quot; [in] the popular mandate he [held] as an elected consul&quot; and drew a distinction between himself and other politicians as to who truly acted in the interests of the Roman people. This usage did not draw a contrast between &quot;populares&quot; and &quot;optimates&quot;. He similarly uses the term &quot;popularis&quot; describe himself in the Seventh Phillipic for his opposition to Antony and later, in the Eighth Phillipic, to describe the actions of Nasica and Opimius &quot;for having acted in the public interests&quot; by killing Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus. This usage also does not contrast to &quot;optimates&quot; but instead suggests that some person is &quot;truly acting in the interest of the people&quot;.

=== Sallust ===
Sallust, a Roman politician who served as praetor during Caesar&#x27;s dictatorship, writing an account of the Catiline conspiracy and the Jugurthine war, does not use the word &quot;optimas&quot; (or &quot;optimates&quot;) at all, and uses the word &quot;popularis&quot; only ten times. None of those usages are political, referring either to countrymen or comrades. Robb speculates that &quot;[Sallust] may have chosen the avoid using the word precisely because it was so imprecise and did not clearly identify a particular kind of politician&quot;.

In his work on the Jugurthine war, he does have a narrative of two parties: one of the people (&quot;populus&quot;) and one the nobles (&quot;nobilitas&quot;), where a small and corrupt section of the senate () is contrasted oligarchically against the rest of society. But because the &quot;nobiles&quot; were defined not by their ideology, but by their ancestry from past holders of curule magistracies, these are not the &quot;optimates&quot; of ideological or political-party conflict, who are themselves &quot;riven by internal divisions&quot;.

Sallust also fails to draw any distinction between popular sovereignty and senatorial prestige as sources of legitimacy or authority. He also gives the &quot;dissenting nobles and their factions&quot; no labels, &quot;for the simple reason that they lacked the common characteristics which would have enabled such a categorisation&quot;, instead presenting a cynical view in which Roman politicians cloaked themselves opportunistically in terms of &quot;libertas populi Romani&quot; and &quot;senatus auctoritas&quot; as means for self-advancement.

=== Other people in the late republic ===
While ancient accounts of the late republic describe &quot;a political &#x27;establishment&#x27; and the opposition&quot; thereto they do not use words such as &quot;populares&quot; to describe that opposition. Because politicians viewed their own status as reflected by the support of the people, the latter acting passively as a judge of &quot;aristocratic merit&quot;, all politicians claimed &quot;to be &#x27;acting in the interest of the people&#x27;, or in other words, &quot;popularis&quot;&quot;. Words used to describe dissent in the vein of Gaius Gracchus and Quintus Varius Severus trended more towards &quot;seditio&quot; and &quot;seditiosus&quot;.

The works of Livy, the author of &quot;Ab Urbe Condita Libri&quot; (known in English as the &quot;History of Rome&quot;), have been used to argue in favour of a distinction between &quot;populares&quot; and &quot;optimates&quot; through to earlier periods such as the Conflict of the Orders. Livy wrote after the late republic, during the Augustan period. However, his treatment of the late Republic does not survive except in an epitome called the Periochae. While it is generally accepted that &quot;Livy applies late republican political language to events from earlier periods&quot;, the terms &quot;optimates&quot; and &quot;populares&quot; (and derivatives) appear infrequently and generally not in a political context.

The vast majority of the usages of &quot;popularis&quot; in Livy denote fellow citizens, comrades, and oratory suitable for public speaking. Usage of &quot;optimates&quot; is also infrequent, the majority of usages referring to foreign aristocrats. Livy&#x27;s terminology in describing the conflict of the orders referred not to &quot;populares&quot; and &quot;optimates&quot; but rather to plebeians and patricians and their place in the constitutional order. Livy only uses the word &quot;popularis&quot; in contrast to &quot;optimates&quot; in political terms only once, in a speech put into the mouth of Barbatus on the tyranny of the Second Decemvirate in the 450s BC, centuries before the late republic.

== Historiography ==

The traditional view comes from scholarship by Theodor Mommsen during the 19th century, in which he identified both &quot;populares&quot; and &quot;optimates&quot; as modern &quot;parliamentary-style political parties&quot;, suggesting that the conflict of the orders resulted in the formation of an aristocratic and a democratic party. For example, John Edwin Sandys, writing 1920 in this traditional scholarship, identified the &quot;optimates&quot; – qua party – as the killers of Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC. Mommsen too suggested that the labels themselves became common in Gracchan times.

This view was re-evaluated, starting with Gelzer&#x27;s &quot;Die Nobilität de Römischen Republik&quot;, with a model of Roman politics in which a candidate &quot;could not rely on the support of an organised party[,] but instead had to cultivate a wide range of personal relationships extending both upwards and downwards in society&quot;. In later work, he returned to a more ideological interpretation of &quot;popularis&quot;, but viewed &quot;popularis&quot; politicians not as democrats, but as demagogues &quot;more concerned about gaining the authority of the people for their plans than implementing [their] will&quot;.

By the 1930s, a far less ideological interpretation emerged, viewing Roman republican politics as dominated by parties, not of like-minded ideologues, but of aristocratic &quot;gentes&quot;. Syme in the 1939 book &quot;Roman Revolution&quot; wrote that:

The political life of the Roman Republic was stamped and swayed, not by parties and programmes of a modern and parliamentary character, not by the ostensible opposition between senate and people, &quot;optimates&quot; and &quot;populares&quot;, &quot;nobiles&quot; and &quot;novi homines&quot;, but by the strife for power, wealth and glory. The contestants were the &quot;nobiles&quot; among themselves, as individuals or in groups, open in the elections and in the courts of law, or masked by secret intrigue.

Syme&#x27;s description of Roman politics viewed the late republic &quot;as a conflict between a dominant oligarchy drawn from a set of powerful families and their opponents&quot; which operated primarily not in ideological terms, but in terms of feuds between family-based factions. Strausberger, writing also in 1939, challenged the traditional view of political parties, arguing that &quot;there was no &#x27;class war&#x27;&quot; in the various civil wars (eg Sulla&#x27;s civil war and Caesar&#x27;s civil war) that started the collapse of the republic. 

Meier noted in 1965 that &quot;&#x27;popular&#x27; politics was very difficult both to understand and describe[, noting] that the people itself had no political initiative but was &#x27;directed&#x27; by the aristocratic magistrates it elected[, meaning that] &#x27;popular&#x27; politics was... the province of politicians not the people&quot;. Moreover, &quot;very few &#x27;populares&#x27; appeared to embrace long term goals and most acted in a way described as &quot;popularis&quot; for only a short time&quot;.

He suggested four meanings for the word &quot;popularis&quot;:

# politicians acting as champions of the people against the senate,
# politicians manipulating the popular assemblies,
# politicians who took up a &quot;causa populi&quot; and paraded the people before the &quot;plebs urbana&quot;, and
# a manner adopted by politicians who used &quot;popular&quot; means to prolong a political career.

His analysis viewed &quot;popularis&quot; in terms of a method &quot;adopted by those who opposed the senatorial majority, [providing] a behavioural model which did not concern itself with attributing motive to political action&quot;. Gruen in the famous &quot;Last Generation of the Roman Republic&quot; in 1974 rejected the terms entirely:

Brunt, writing in the 1980s–90s, took a view trending against political parties but towards an ideological dimension. He emphasised that shifting alliances and loyalties between senators precluded the existence of &quot;durable or cohesive political factions&quot; which could be identified as &quot;optimates&quot; or &quot;populares&quot; and that &quot;optimates and populares did not and could not constitute parties as we know them&quot;. Moreover, he argued there were no &quot;large groups of politicians, bound together by ties of kinship or friendship, or by fidelity to a leader, who [acted] together consistently for any considerable time&quot; and that &quot;of large, cohesive, and durable coalitions of families there is no evidence at all for any period&quot;. Instead, he argued that the distinction was not one of permanent factional strife, but rather, of support and opposition of the senate: &quot;popularis&quot; politicians, while not being &quot;reformers&quot; per se, would resort to the popular assemblies if they felt intervention from the people was desirable, with an ideological distinction dividing Roman politicians as to what was in the public interest.

The &quot;optimates&quot; were explored by Burckhardt in 1988, viewing them as portions of the nobility acting to advance laws against corruption, electoral bribery, and overly flagrant displays of wealth (ie laws on &quot;repetundae&quot;, &quot;ambitus&quot;, and &quot;sumptuaria&quot;) with tactics such as vetoes and obstructionism. Gruen, however, noted in 1995, that this analysis provided &quot;no clear criteria&quot; for determining anything about the makeup, size, or organisation of the group. Identification of &quot;optimates&quot; also continues to be difficult. They have been identified as &quot;members of an &#x27;aristocratic party&#x27; to upholders of senatorial authority to supporters of the class interests of the wealthy&quot;.

Mackie argued in a 1992 influential paper revitalising the ideological view that &quot;ratio popularis&quot; implied and required substantial argumentation based on Roman tradition to justify the intervention of the popular assemblies. Such argumentation took the form of an ideology of popular sovereignty, self-justifying the leadership of the comitia in the state. Hölkeskamp suggested in 1997 that &quot;popularis&quot; ideology reflected a history of senatorial intransigence characterised as &quot;partial and unlawful&quot; which, over time, eroded the legitimacy of the senate in the republic. Morstein-Marx&#x27;s book on mass oratory in the republic – often before &quot;contiones&quot; or assemblies of the people – focused, however, on how both opponents and supporters of legislation attempted to portray themselves as &quot;true&quot; &quot;popularis&quot; acting in the interest of the people and the other as demagoguery.

There continues to be debate as to the utility of the terms in scholarship. In 1994, Andrew Lintott wrote in &quot;The Cambridge Ancient History&quot; that although both factions came from the same social class, there is &quot;no reason to deny the divergence of ideology highlighted by Cicero&quot; with themes and leaders stretching back in Cicero&#x27;s time for hundreds of years.
 T. P. Wiseman similarly lamented an &quot;ideological vacuum&quot; in 2009, promoting the term as a label for ideology rather than for political factionalism in the vein of Mommsen.

Other recent publications have continued to contest the topic. M. A. Robb argued in her 2010 book &quot;Beyond Populares and Optimates&quot; that the labels emerge from Cicero&#x27;s writings and were &quot;far from corresponding with definite parties or definite policies&quot;. It seems Romans did not use the terms themselves: for example, Caesar and Sallust never identified &quot;Caesar&quot; as a member of any &quot;populares&quot; &quot;faction&quot;. &quot;The terms &quot;populares&quot; and &quot;optimates&quot; were not common and everyday labels used to categorise certain types of late republican politician&quot;. Robb rejects usage of both &quot;populares&quot; and &quot;optimates&quot; writ large, as all Roman politicians would have asserted their devotion to public liberty and also have asserted their own excellence; instead of &quot;populares&quot; to describe demagoguery, Romans would have used &quot;seditiosi&quot;. Similarly, Henrik Mouritsen, writing in the 2017 book &quot;Politics in the Roman Republic&quot; rejects the putative categories entirely, supporting a &quot;politics without &#x27;parties&#x27;&quot; in the vein of Meier, where politicians &quot;at certain moments in their career[s] used their powers without the backing of their peers&quot;.

<text>The nobiles ( &quot;nobilis&quot;, ) were members of a social rank in the Roman Republic indicating that one was &quot;well known&quot;. This may have changed over time: in Cicero&#x27;s time, one was notable if one descended from a person who had been elected consul. In earlier periods and more broadly, this may have included a larger group consisting of those who were patricians, were descended from patricians who had become plebeians via &quot;transitio ad plebem&quot;, or were descended from plebeians who had held curule offices.

==History==
The &quot;nobiles&quot; emerged after the Conflict of the Orders established legal equality between patricians and plebeians, allowing plebeians to hold all the magistracies; the state of being &quot;known&quot; was connected to the &quot;nobiles&quot;″s rights to funeral masks () and actors in aristocratic funeral processions. However, the term is largely unattested to in the middle Republic, having been introduced in the late Republic as a description rather than a status. Earning such a mask required holding one of the qualifying curule magistracies.

These elections meant the republican nobility was not entirely closed. Nor in the republic did &quot;nobiles&quot; enjoy special legal privileges. In the later Republic, one who became noble was termed a &quot;novus homo&quot; (), an unusual achievement. Two of the most famous examples of these self-made &quot;new men&quot; were Gaius Marius, who held the consulship seven times, and Cicero. While wholly new men were rare, the political elite as a whole turned over as some families were unable to win elections over multiple generations and other families became more prominent, creating slow-moving and osmotic change.

The prestige of the &quot;nobiles&quot; was connected directly to their election to high office by the people. During the Roman Republic, the &quot;nobiles&quot; never held less than about 70 per cent of the consulships over longer periods; by the time of Cicero, the &quot;nobiles&quot; as a whole held more than 90 per cent of the consulships, a proportion &quot;remarkably untouched by the most violent political crises&quot;. The narrowing of what made someone part of the &quot;nobiles&quot; occurred around the time of the constitutional reforms of Sulla with its &quot;much larger senate with a proportionately smaller circle of elite senators... many new Italians in the Sullan senate, and the increased number of praetors&quot; leading the elite to close ranks to preserve their prestige.

During the time of Augustus, a &quot;nobilis&quot; enjoyed easier access to the consulship, with a lowered age requirement perhaps set at 32. Women who descended from Augustan consuls were also regarded as belonging to the Roman nobility. The term still referred to descendants of republican and triumviral consuls, but by the Antonines, most noble families had died out; one of the last were the Acilii Glabriones who survived into the 4th century.

SPC can be applied to any process where the &quot;conforming product&quot; (product meeting specifications) output can be measured. Key tools used in SPC include run charts, control charts, a focus on continuous improvement, and the design of experiments. An example of a process where SPC is applied is manufacturing lines.

SPC must be practiced in two phases: the first phase is the initial establishment of the process, and the second phase is the regular production use of the process. In the second phase, a decision of the period to be examined must be made, depending upon the change in 5M&amp;E conditions (Man, Machine, Material, Method, Movement, Environment) and wear rate of parts used in the manufacturing process (machine parts, jigs, and fixtures).

An advantage of SPC over other methods of quality control, such as &quot;inspection,&quot; is that it emphasizes early detection and prevention of problems, rather than the correction of problems after they have occurred.

In addition to reducing waste, SPC can lead to a reduction in the time required to produce the product. SPC makes it less likely the finished product will need to be reworked or scrapped.

== History ==
Statistical process control was pioneered by Walter A. Shewhart at Bell Laboratories in the early 1920s. Shewhart developed the control chart in 1924 and the concept of a state of statistical control. Statistical control is equivalent to the concept of exchangeability developed by logician William Ernest Johnson also in 1924 in his book &quot;Logic, Part III: The Logical Foundations of Science&quot;. Along with a team at AT&amp;T that included Harold Dodge and Harry Romig he worked to put sampling inspection on a rational statistical basis as well. Shewhart consulted with Colonel Leslie E. Simon in the application of control charts to munitions manufacture at the Army&#x27;s Picatinny Arsenal in 1934. That successful application helped convince Army Ordnance to engage AT&amp;T&#x27;s George D. Edwards to consult on the use of statistical quality control among its divisions and contractors at the outbreak of World War II.

W. Edwards Deming invited Shewhart to speak at the Graduate School of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and served as the editor of Shewhart&#x27;s book &quot;Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control&quot; (1939), which was the result of that lecture. Deming was an important architect of the quality control short courses that trained American industry in the new techniques during WWII. The graduates of these wartime courses formed a new professional society in 1945, the American Society for Quality Control, which elected Edwards as its first president. Deming travelled to Japan during the Allied Occupation and met with the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) in an effort to introduce SPC methods to Japanese industry.

===&#x27;Common&#x27; and &#x27;special&#x27; sources of variation===

Shewhart read the new statistical theories coming out of Britain, especially the work of William Sealy Gosset, Karl Pearson, and Ronald Fisher. However, he understood that data from physical processes seldom produced a normal distribution curve (that is, a Gaussian distribution or &#x27;bell curve&#x27;). He discovered that data from measurements of variation in manufacturing did not always behave the same way as data from measurements of natural phenomena (for example, Brownian motion of particles). Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation, some processes display variation that is natural to the process (&quot;&quot;common&quot; sources of variation); these processes he described as being &quot;in (statistical) control&quot;. Other processes additionally display variation that is not present in the causal system of the process at all times (&quot;special&quot;&quot; sources of variation), which Shewhart described as &quot;not in control&quot;.

===Application to non-manufacturing processes===

Statistical process control is appropriate to support any repetitive process, and has been implemented in many settings where for example ISO 9000 quality management systems are used, including financial auditing and accounting, IT operations, health care processes, and clerical processes such as loan arrangement and administration, customer billing etc. Despite criticism of its use in design and development, it is well-placed to manage semi-automated data governance of high-volume data processing operations, for example in an enterprise data warehouse, or an enterprise data quality management system.

In the 1988 Capability Maturity Model (CMM) the Software Engineering Institute suggested that SPC could be applied to software engineering processes. The Level 4 and Level 5 practices of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) use this concept.

The application of SPC to non-repetitive, knowledge-intensive processes, such as research and development or systems engineering, has encountered skepticism and remains controversial.

In &quot;No Silver Bullet&quot;, Fred Brooks points out that the complexity, conformance requirements, changeability, and invisibility of software results in inherent and essential variation that cannot be removed. This implies that SPC is less effective in the software development than in, e.g., manufacturing.

==Variation in manufacturing==
In manufacturing, quality is defined as conformance to specification. However, no two products or characteristics are ever exactly the same, because any process contains many sources of variability. In mass-manufacturing, traditionally, the quality of a finished article is ensured by post-manufacturing inspection of the product. Each article (or a sample of articles from a production lot) may be accepted or rejected according to how well it meets its design specifications, SPC uses statistical tools to observe the performance of the production process in order to detect significant variations before they result in the production of a sub-standard article.
Any source of variation at any point of time in a process will fall into one of two classes.
;(1) &quot;Common&quot; causes: &#x27;Common&#x27; causes are sometimes referred to as &#x27;non-assignable&#x27;, or &#x27;normal&#x27; sources of variation. It refers to any source of variation that consistently acts on process, of which there are typically many. This type of causes collectively produce a statistically stable and repeatable distribution over time.
;(2) &quot;Special&quot; causes: &#x27;Special&#x27; causes are sometimes referred to as &#x27;assignable&#x27; sources of variation. The term refers to any factor causing variation that affects only some of the process output. They are often intermittent and unpredictable.

Most processes have many sources of variation; most of them are minor and may be ignored. If the dominant assignable sources of variation are detected, potentially they can be identified and removed. When they are removed, the process is said to be &#x27;stable&#x27;. When a process is stable, its variation should remain within a known set of limits. That is, at least, until another assignable source of variation occurs.

For example, a breakfast cereal packaging line may be designed to fill each cereal box with 500 grams of cereal. Some boxes will have slightly more than 500 grams, and some will have slightly less. When the package weights are measured, the data will demonstrate a distribution of net weights.

If the production process, its inputs, or its environment (for example, the machine on the line) change, the distribution of the data will change. For example, as the cams and pulleys of the machinery wear, the cereal filling machine may put more than the specified amount of cereal into each box. Although this might benefit the customer, from the manufacturer&#x27;s point of view it is wasteful, and increases the cost of production. If the manufacturer finds the change and its source in a timely manner, the change can be corrected (for example, the cams and pulleys replaced).

From an SPC perspective, if the weight of each cereal box varies randomly, some higher and some lower, always within an acceptable range, then the process is considered stable. If the cams and pulleys of the machinery start to wear out, the weights of the cereal box might not be random. The degraded functionality of the cams and pulleys may lead to a non-random linear pattern of increasing cereal box weights. We call this common cause variation. If, however, all the cereal boxes suddenly weighed much more than average because of an unexpected malfunction of the cams and pulleys, this would be considered a special cause variation.

==Application==
The application of SPC involves three main phases of activity:

#Understanding the process and the specification limits.
#Eliminating assignable (special) sources of variation, so that the process is stable.
#Monitoring the ongoing production process, assisted by the use of control charts, to detect significant changes of mean or variation.

The proper implementation of SPC has been limited, in part due to a lack of statistical expertise at many organizations.

===Control charts===
The data from measurements of variations at points on the process map is monitored using control charts. Control charts attempt to differentiate &quot;assignable&quot; (&quot;special&quot;) sources of variation from &quot;common&quot; sources. &quot;Common&quot; sources, because they are an expected part of the process, are of much less concern to the manufacturer than &quot;assignable&quot; sources. Using control charts is a continuous activity, ongoing over time.

====Stable process====
When the process does not trigger any of the control chart &quot;detection rules&quot; for the control chart, it is said to be &quot;stable&quot;. A process capability analysis may be performed on a stable process to predict the ability of the process to produce &quot;conforming product&quot; in the future.

A stable process can be demonstrated by a process signature that is free of variances outside of the capability index. A process signature is the plotted points compared with the capability index.

====Excessive variations====

When the process triggers any of the control chart &quot;detection rules&quot;, (or alternatively, the process capability is low), other activities may be performed to identify the source of the excessive variation.
The tools used in these extra activities include: Ishikawa diagram, designed experiments, and Pareto charts. Designed experiments are a means of objectively quantifying the relative importance (strength) of sources of variation. Once the sources of (special cause) variation are identified, they can be minimized or eliminated. Steps to eliminating a source of variation might include: development of standards, staff training, error-proofing, and changes to the process itself or its inputs.

====Process stability metrics====

When monitoring many processes with control charts, it is sometimes useful to calculate quantitative measures of the stability of the processes. These metrics can then be used to identify/prioritize the processes that are most in need of corrective actions. These metrics can also be viewed as supplementing the traditional process capability metrics. Several metrics have been proposed, as described in Ramirez and Runger.
They are (1) a Stability Ratio which compares the long-term variability to the short-term variability, (2) an ANOVA Test which compares the within-subgroup variation to the between-subgroup variation, and (3) an Instability Ratio which compares the number of subgroups that have one or more violations of the Western Electric rules to the total number of subgroups.

==Mathematics of control charts==
Digital control charts use logic-based rules that determine &quot;derived values&quot; which signal the need for correction. For example,
:derived value = last value + average absolute difference between the last N numbers.

<text>Form follows function is a principle of design associated with late 19th- and early 20th-century architecture and industrial design in general, which states that the appearance and structure of a building or object (architectural form) should primarily relate to its intended function or purpose.

== Origins of the phrase ==
The architect Louis Sullivan coined the maxim, which encapsulates Viollet-le-Duc&#x27;s theories: &quot;a rationally designed structure may not necessarily be beautiful but no building can be beautiful that does not have a rationally designed structure&quot;. The maxim is often incorrectly attributed to the sculptor Horatio Greenough (1805–1852), whose thinking mostly predates the later functionalist approach to architecture. Greenough&#x27;s writings were for a long time largely forgotten, and were rediscovered only in the 1930s. In 1947, a selection of his essays was published as &quot;Form and Function: Remarks on Art by Horatio Greenough&quot;. The earliest formulation of the idea as &quot;in architecture only that shall show that has a definite function&quot; belongs not to an architect, but to a monk Carlo Lodoli (1690–1761), who uttered the phrase while inspired by positivist thinking (Lodoli&#x27;s words were published by his student, Francesco Algarotti, in 1757).

Sullivan was Greenough&#x27;s much younger compatriot and admired rationalist thinkers such as Thoreau, Emerson, Whitman, and Melville, as well as Greenough himself. In 1896, Sullivan coined the phrase in an article titled &quot;The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered&quot;, though he later attributed the core idea to the ancient Roman architect, engineer, and author Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, who first asserted in his book that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of firmness, commodity, and delight — that is, it must be solid, useful, and beautiful. Sullivan actually wrote that &quot;form ever follows function&quot;, but the simpler and less emphatic phrase is more widely remembered. For Sullivan, this was distilled wisdom, an aesthetic credo, the single &quot;rule that shall permit of no exception&quot;. The full quote is:

Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his flight, or the open apple-blossom, the toiling work-horse, the blithe swan, the branching oak, the winding stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over all the coursing sun, &quot;form ever follows function&quot;, and this is the law. Where function does not change, form does not change. The granite rocks, the ever-brooding hills, remain for ages; the lightning lives, comes into shape, and dies, in a twinkling.

It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things physical and metaphysical, of all things human and all things superhuman, of all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, that the life is recognizable in its expression, that form ever follows function. &quot;This is the law.&quot;
Sullivan developed the shape of the tall steel skyscraper in late 19th-century Chicago at a moment in which technology, taste and economic forces converged and made it necessary to break with established styles. If the shape of the building was not going to be chosen out of the old pattern book, something had to determine form, and according to Sullivan it was going to be the purpose of the building. Thus, &quot;form follows function&quot;, as opposed to &quot;form follows precedent&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s assistant, Frank Lloyd Wright, adopted and professed the same principle in a slightly different form.

== Debate on the functionality of ornamentation ==

In 1910, the Austrian architect Adolf Loos gave a lecture titled &quot;Ornament and Crime&quot; in reaction to the elaborate ornament used by the Vienna Secession architects. Modernists adopted Loos&#x27;s moralistic argument as well as Sullivan&#x27;s maxim. Loos had worked as a carpenter in the USA. He celebrated efficient plumbing and industrial artifacts like corn silos and steel water towers as examples of functional design.

== Application in different fields ==
&quot;Form follows function&quot; is closely associated with utilitarian design, a concept of products designed exclusively for utility (&quot;function&quot;) instead of &quot;contemplating pleasure&quot;. 

=== Architecture ===
The phrase &quot;form (ever) follows function&quot; became a battle cry of Modernist architects after the 1930s. The credo was taken to imply that decorative elements, which architects call &quot;ornament&quot;, were superfluous in modern buildings. The phrase can best be implemented in design by asking the question, &quot;Does it work?&quot; Design in architecture utilizing this mantra follows the functionality and purpose of the building. For example, a family home would be designed around familial and social interactions and life. It would be purposeful, without functionless flare. A building&#x27;s beauty comes from the function it serves rather than from its visual design. One aim of the Modernists after World War II was to elevate the living conditions of the masses. Many people around the world were living in less than ideal conditions, worsened by war. The Modernists sought to bring these people into more livable, humane spaces that, while not conventionally beautiful, were extremely functional. As a result, architecture utilizing &quot;form follows function&quot; became a sign of hope and progress.

Despite coining the term, Louis Sullivan himself neither thought nor designed along such lines at the peak of his career. Indeed, while his buildings could be spare and crisp in their principal masses, he often punctuated their plain surfaces with eruptions of lush Art Nouveau and Celtic Revival decorations, usually cast in iron or terracotta, and ranging from organic forms like vines and ivy, to more geometric designs, and interlace, inspired by his Irish design heritage. Probably the most famous example is the writhing green ironwork that covers the entrance canopies of the Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building on South State Street in Chicago. These ornaments, often executed by the talented younger draftsman in Sullivan&#x27;s employ, would eventually become Sullivan&#x27;s trademark; to students of architecture, they are his instantly recognizable signature.

=== Automobile designing ===

If the design of an automobile conforms to its function—for instance, the Fiat Multipla&#x27;s shape, which is partly due to the desire to sit six people in two rows—then its form is said to follow its function.

=== Product design ===

One episode in the history of the inherent conflict between functional design and the demands of the marketplace took place in 1935, after the introduction of the streamlined Chrysler Airflow, when the American auto industry temporarily halted attempts to introduce optimal aerodynamic forms into mass manufacture. Some car-makers thought aerodynamic efficiency would result in a single optimal auto-body shape, a &quot;teardrop&quot; shape, which would not be good for unit sales. General Motors adopted two different positions on streamlining, one meant for its internal engineering community, the other meant for its customers. Like the annual model year change, so-called aerodynamic styling is often meaningless in terms of technical performance. Subsequently, drag coefficient has become both a marketing tool and a means of improving the sale-ability of a car by reducing its fuel consumption, slightly, and increasing its top speed, markedly.

The American industrial designers of the 1930s and 1940s like Raymond Loewy, Norman Bel Geddes and Henry Dreyfuss grappled with the inherent contradictions of &quot;form follows function&quot; as they redesigned blenders and locomotives and duplicating machines for mass-market consumption. Loewy formulated his principle to express that product designs are bound by functional constraints of math and materials and logic, but their acceptance is constrained by social expectations. His advice was that for very new technologies, they should be made as familiar as possible, but for familiar technologies, they should be made surprising.

Victor Papanek (1923–1998) was one influential twentieth-century designer and design philosopher who taught and wrote as a proponent of &quot;form follows function&quot;.

By honestly applying &quot;form follows function&quot;, industrial designers had the potential to put their clients out of business. Some simple single-purpose objects like screwdrivers and pencils and teapots might be reducible to a single optimal form, precluding product differentiation. Some objects made too durable would prevent sales of replacements (see Planned obsolescence). From the standpoint of functionality, some products are simply unnecessary.

An alternative approach referred to as &quot;form leads function&quot;, or &quot;function follows form&quot;, starts with vague, abstract, or underspecified designs. These designs, sometimes generated using tools like text-to-image models, can serve as triggers for generating novel ideas for product design.

=== Software engineering ===
It has been argued that the structure and internal quality attributes of a working, non-trivial software artifact will represent first and foremost the engineering requirements of its construction, with the influence of process being marginal, if any. This does not mean that process is irrelevant, but that processes compatible with an artifact&#x27;s requirements lead to roughly similar results.

The principle can also be applied to enterprise application architectures of modern business, where &quot;function&quot; encompasses the business processes which should be assisted by the enterprise architecture, or &quot;form&quot;. If the architecture were to dictate how the business operates, then the business is likely to suffer from inflexibility and the inability to adapt to change. Service-oriented architecture enables an enterprise architect to rearrange the &quot;form&quot; of the architecture to meet the functional requirements of a business by adopting standards-based communication protocols which enable interoperability. This stands in conflict with Conway&#x27;s law, which states from a social point of view that &quot;form follows organization&quot;.

Furthermore, domain-driven design postulates that structure (software architecture, design pattern, implementation) should emerge from constraints of the modeled domain (functional requirement).

While &quot;form&quot; and &quot;function&quot; may be more or less explicit and invariant concepts to the many engineering doctrines, metaprogramming and the functional programming paradigm lend themselves very well to explore, blur and invert the essence of those two concepts.

The agile software development movement espouses techniques such as &quot;test-driven development&quot;, in which the engineer begins with a minimum unit of user-oriented functionality, creates an automated test for such and then implements the functionality and iterates, repeating this process. The result and argument for this discipline are that the structure or &quot;form&quot; emerges from actual function, and in fact because done organically, makes the project more adaptable long-term, as well of as higher-quality because of the functional base of automated tests.

<text>Bells Beach is a locality in Surf Coast Shire, Victoria, Australia. It is a popular surf beach, located 100 km south-west of Melbourne, on the Great Ocean Road near the towns of Torquay and Jan Juc.

It is named after William Bell, a Geelong businessman and grazier, who owned much of the property there from the 1840s. Many records wrongly accredit the location&#x27;s name to John Calvert Bell of the family that took up a pastoral run there much later in 1905 and built the &#x27;Addiscot&#x27; homestead. John Calvert Bell was, before that time, a resident at Calder Park, Mount Duneed, and not related to William Bell of Bells Beach. The beach and coastal reserve are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

In the 2016 Census, there were 130 people in Bells Beach, 88.7% of whom were born in Australia and 94.5% of whom spoke only English at home.

==Surfing==
Bells Beach is the home of the world&#x27;s longest continuously running pro surfing competition – now known as the Rip Curl Pro Bells Beach. The event was formerly known as the Bells Easter Classic (among a variety of other titles). The competition was first held in January 1962 and then at Easter every year since, although occasionally, when conditions at Bells aren&#x27;t suitable, the competition has been transferred to other breaks such as Johanna and Woolamai.

As early as 1939, surfers from Torquay made their way to Bells but access was a considerable problem until 1960, when Torquay surfers and Olympic wrestler Joe Sweeney hired a bulldozer and cleared a road along the Bells cliff from the Cobb &amp; Co Road, where the concrete wave now stands, down to the beach. He charged one pound per surfer to recover his expenses. This is now part of the Surf Coast walking track.

Nearby surf breaks include &quot;Southside&quot;, &quot;Centreside&quot;, &quot;Rincon&quot;, &quot;Winki Pop&quot;, (Uppers and Lowers), &quot;Boobs&quot; and &quot;Steps&quot;. Although Bells is known internationally as one of the best breaks in Victoria, &quot;Winki Pop&quot; often works better under more diverse conditions than the other nearby breaks.

The first &quot;Surfboard Rally&quot; at Bells Beach was organised by surfing pioneers Peter Troy and Vic Tantau to help promote sales of T Boards, their own brand. Planned to run in December 1961 the event was postponed until 26 January 1962. From the following year the Australian Surfriders Association - ASA (Victorian Branch) - now called Surfing Victoria -hosted and staged the annual surfing competition at Bells Beach held at Easter each year. The ASA also ran the conservation contest at Bells Beach which included tree planting in an effort to help preserve natural values every year since the mid-1970s.

===Surfing competitions===
* Rip Curl GromSearch National Series (under 17s) 
* Rip Curl Pro every Easter since 1962

===Surfers Appreciating the Natural Environment (SANE)===
In 1988 a group of local surfers who were concerned about the human impact that tourism was having on the Bells Beach Surfing Reserve started a group called Surfers Appreciating the Natural Environment. Since 1988 they have met monthly to revegetate the reserve in an effort to bring it back to its original state. They have planted over 100,000 plants there to date.

==In popular culture==
Although the final scene of the film &quot;Point Break&quot; is set at Bells Beach, the scene was not filmed there. Bells Beach is a straight stretch and the beach in the film is a cove with spruce trees atop a hill. The actual location of the film was Indian Beach in Ecola State Park located in Cannon Beach, Oregon in the United States.

Geoffrey Wright filmed the final scene of 1992, Australian picture, Romper Stomper at Bell’s Beach. In a scene where skinhead main protagonist, Hando (played by Russell Crowe) confronts Davey and Gabrielle.

Bells Beach is visited in the 1966 documentary film &quot;The Endless Summer&quot;.

In the 2007 animation film &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, the Australian surfer is shown to be from Bells Beach.

<text>In geometry, a point is an abstract idealization of an exact position, without size, in physical space, or its generalization to other kinds of mathematical spaces. As zero-dimensional objects, points are usually taken to be the fundamental indivisible elements comprising the space, of which one-dimensional curves, two-dimensional surfaces, and higher-dimensional objects consist. 

In classical Euclidean geometry, a point is a primitive notion, defined as &quot;that which has no part&quot;. Points and other primitive notions are not defined in terms of other concepts, but only by certain formal properties, called axioms, that they must satisfy; for example, &quot;there is exactly one straight line that passes through two distinct points&quot;. As physical diagrams, geometric figures are made with tools such as a compass, scriber, or pen, whose pointed tip can mark a small dot or prick a small hole representing a point, or can be drawn across a surface to represent a curve.

A point can also be determined by the intersection of two curves or three surfaces, called a &quot;vertex&quot; or &quot;corner&quot;.
Since the advent of analytic geometry, points are often defined or represented in terms of numerical coordinates. In modern mathematics, a space of points is typically treated as a set, a point set.

An &quot;isolated point&quot; is an element of some subset of points which has some neighborhood containing no other points of the subset.

==Points in Euclidean geometry==

Points, considered within the framework of Euclidean geometry, are one of the most fundamental objects. Euclid originally defined the point as &quot;that which has no part&quot;. In the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, a point is represented by an ordered pair (, ) of numbers, where the first number conventionally represents the horizontal and is often denoted by , and the second number conventionally represents the vertical and is often denoted by . This idea is easily generalized to three-dimensional Euclidean space, where a point is represented by an ordered triplet (, , ) with the additional third number representing depth and often denoted by . Further generalizations are represented by an ordered tuplet of terms, where is the dimension of the space in which the point is located.

Many constructs within Euclidean geometry consist of an infinite collection of points that conform to certain axioms. This is usually represented by a set of points; As an example, a line is an infinite set of points of the form
formula_1where through and are constants and is the dimension of the space. Similar constructions exist that define the plane, line segment, and other related concepts. A line segment consisting of only a single point is called a degenerate line segment.

In addition to defining points and constructs related to points, Euclid also postulated a key idea about points, that any two points can be connected by a straight line. This is easily confirmed under modern extensions of Euclidean geometry, and had lasting consequences at its introduction, allowing the construction of almost all the geometric concepts known at the time. However, Euclid&#x27;s postulation of points was neither complete nor definitive, and he occasionally assumed facts about points that did not follow directly from his axioms, such as the ordering of points on the line or the existence of specific points. In spite of this, modern expansions of the system serve to remove these assumptions.

==Dimension of a point==

There are several inequivalent definitions of dimension in mathematics. In all of the common definitions, a point is 0-dimensional.

=== Vector space dimension ===
The dimension of a vector space is the maximum size of a linearly independent subset. In a vector space consisting of a single point (which must be the zero vector 0), there is no linearly independent subset. The zero vector is not itself linearly independent, because there is a non-trivial linear combination making it zero: formula_2.

===Topological dimension===
The topological dimension of a topological space formula_3 is defined to be the minimum value of &quot;n&quot;, such that every finite open cover formula_4 of formula_3 admits a finite open cover formula_6 of formula_3 which refines formula_4 in which no point is included in more than &quot;n&quot;+1 elements. If no such minimal &quot;n&quot; exists, the space is said to be of infinite covering dimension.

A point is zero-dimensional with respect to the covering dimension because every open cover of the space has a refinement consisting of a single open set.

=== Hausdorff dimension ===
Let &quot;X&quot; be a metric space. If and , the &quot;d&quot;-dimensional Hausdorff content of &quot;S&quot; is the infimum of the set of numbers such that there is some (indexed) collection of balls formula_9 covering &quot;S&quot; with for each that satisfies formula_10

The Hausdorff dimension of &quot;X&quot; is defined by
formula_11

A point has Hausdorff dimension 0 because it can be covered by a single ball of arbitrarily small radius.

==Geometry without points==
Although the notion of a point is generally considered fundamental in mainstream geometry and topology, there are some systems that forgo it, e.g. noncommutative geometry and pointless topology. A &quot;pointless&quot; or &quot;pointfree&quot; space is defined not as a set, but via some structure (algebraic or logical respectively) which looks like a well-known function space on the set: an algebra of continuous functions or an algebra of sets respectively. More precisely, such structures generalize well-known spaces of functions in a way that the operation &quot;take a value at this point&quot; may not be defined. A further tradition starts from some books of A. N. Whitehead in which the notion of region is assumed as a primitive together with the one of &quot;inclusion&quot; or &quot;connection&quot;.

==Point masses and the Dirac delta function ==
Often in physics and mathematics, it is useful to think of a point as having non-zero mass or charge (this is especially common in classical electromagnetism, where electrons are idealized as points with non-zero charge). The Dirac delta function, or function, is (informally) a generalized function on the real number line that is zero everywhere except at zero, with an integral of one over the entire real line. The delta function is sometimes thought of as an infinitely high, infinitely thin spike at the origin, with total area one under the spike, and physically represents an idealized point mass or point charge. It was introduced by theoretical physicist Paul Dirac. In the context of signal processing it is often referred to as the unit impulse symbol (or function). Its discrete analog is the Kronecker delta function which is usually defined on a finite domain and takes values 0 and 1.

<text>Bush House is a Grade II listed building at the southern end of Kingsway between Aldwych and the Strand in London, England. It was conceived as a major new trade centre by American industrialist Irving T. Bush, and commissioned, designed, funded, and constructed under his direction. The design was approved in 1919, work began in 1925, and was completed in 1935. Erected in stages, by 1929 Bush House was already declared the &quot;most expensive building in the world&quot;.

Now part of the Strand Campus of King&#x27;s College London, Bush House previously served as the headquarters of the BBC World Service. Broadcasting from Bush House lasted for 70 years, from winter 1941 to summer 2012. The final BBC broadcast from Bush House was the 12 noon BST news bulletin on 12 July 2012. The BBC World Service is now housed in Broadcasting House in Portland Place. King&#x27;s College London has taken over the premises since acquiring the lease in 2015.

The longtime occupation of part of Bush House by HM Revenue and Customs (and its predecessor department the Inland Revenue) ended in March 2021 when it vacated the South-West Wing. This wing will also become a part of King&#x27;s College London&#x27;s Strand Campus, ensuring all wings of the building are now occupied by the University. 

==History==
The building was commissioned, designed and originally owned by American individuals and companies. Irving T. Bush gained approval for his plans for the building in 1919, which was conceived as a major new trade centre and designed by American architect Harvey Wiley Corbett. The construction was undertaken by John Mowlem &amp; Co.

Sections of Bush House were completed and opened over a period of 10 years: Centre Block was opened in 1925, North-West Wing in 1928, North-East Wing in 1929, South-East Wing in 1930, and South-West Wing in 1935. The full building complex was completed in 1935.

The building&#x27;s opening ceremony was performed by Lord Balfour, Lord President of the Council, on 4 July 1925. It included the unveiling of two statues at the entrance made by American artist Malvina Hoffman. The statues symbolise Anglo-American friendship and the building bears the inscription &quot;To the friendship of English speaking peoples&quot;. Built from Portland stone, Bush House was in 1929 declared the &quot;most expensive building in the world&quot;.

=== Headquarters of the BBC World Service ===
The BBC European Service moved into the South-East Wing of Bush House after bombs damaged Broadcasting House on 8 December 1940 during The Blitz. The move was completed in 1941 and the BBC Overseas Service followed in 1958. The BBC World Service occupied four wings of the building.

In 1944 Bush House suffered external damage from a V-1 flying bomb.

The North-West Wing was formerly occupied by BBC Online until it relocated to the BBC Media Village in 2005, with some studio and office space being retained until 2008. The BBC also moved its World Service to Broadcasting House. The final broadcast from Bush was on 12 July 2012. Bulletins now come from Broadcasting House.

BBC GLR 94.9fm - the Local BBC Radio station for London, moved to Bush House for 24 months in 1999, whilst its Marylebone High Street base was modernised. GLR used two continuity suites for their programmes: the &#x27;new&#x27; Cons 4 and 6. These were &#x27;spare&#x27; continuities, but a reduction in the number of networks meant they were rarely used until GLR moved in. Broadcaster Bob Mills humorously complained about having to work in a building called &#x27;BVSH&#x27; House. GLRs production office, Newsroom and News Booth were located in Bush House North West Wing - this meant an up to 10 minute walk from the office to the studio. News bulletins were read from the newsbooth in North West Wing, a video feed between the Newsbooth and the main studios in centre block (Continuities 4 and 6) showed when the News reader was in their seat and ready to go. All area were linked by talkback/push-to-talk intercoms.

The BBC&#x27;s lease expired at the end of 2012.

=== King&#x27;s College London campus ===
A full refurbishment of Bush House and its adjoining wings was undertaken by John Robertson Architects following the BBC&#x27;s vacation. Bush House, along with North-East Wing, North-West Wing, South-East Wing and Melbourne House were stripped back to CAT A and fully modernised whilst retaining original period features. The intended use was open plan offices with reception spaces for each of the buildings given an individual identity. The courtyard was to remain as a car park/delivery point. Completion of this work transpired in June 2014 as part of the much-marketed Aldwych Quarter.

On 10 March 2015, King&#x27;s College London announced it had acquired a 50-year lease for the Aldwych Quarter. as a substantial part of its expansion of its Strand Campus John Robertson Architects undertook the interior fit-out to convert Aldwych Quarter into a fully operational, modern university campus, including installation of a 400 seat auditorium, lecture theatres, seminar rooms, academic offices and a health centre. The courtyard has been converted from car parking to semi-public realm and features a new glass pavilion offering access to the Students&#x27; Union and undercroft joining the building&#x27;s wings together.

Since its foundation on 1 August 2017, the King&#x27;s Business School has been located inside Bush House. It came forth from the &quot;School of Management and Business&quot; to form the 9th faculty of the university. To ‘support world class education and research with environments which foster creativity and engagement.’ the central block hosts &quot;The Department of Informatics&quot; which brings together innovators from the business and technology worlds.

King&#x27;s College London Students&#x27; Union (KCLSU) also occupies Bush House. Its Union Shop opened in The Arcade in September 2017, followed by a series of other student spaces in Spring 2018. KCLSU represents all students at King&#x27;s, but operates as a charity, independent of the university.
