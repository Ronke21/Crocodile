<text>John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley, (8 July 1882 – 4 January 1958), was a Scottish civil servant and politician who is best known for his service in the War Cabinet during the Second World War, for which he was nicknamed the &quot;Home Front Prime Minister&quot;. He served as Home Secretary, Lord President of the Council and Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Anderson shelters are named after him.

A graduate of the University of Edinburgh and the University of Leipzig where he studied the chemistry of uranium, Anderson joined the Civil Service in 1905, and worked in the West African Department of the Colonial Office. During the Great War he headed the staff of the Ministry of Shipping. He served as Under-Secretary for Ireland from 1921 to 1922 during its transition to independence, and as the Permanent Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office from 1922 to 1931 he had to deal with the General Strike of 1926. As Governor of Bengal from 1932 to 1937, he instituted social and financial reforms, and narrowly escaped an assassination attempt.

In early 1938, Anderson was elected to the House of Commons by the Scottish Universities as a National Independent Member of Parliament, and was a non-party supporter of the National Government. In October 1938 he entered Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s Cabinet as Lord Privy Seal. In that capacity, he was put in charge of air raid preparations. He initiated the development of the Anderson shelter, a small sheet metal cylinder made of prefabricated pieces which could be assembled in a garden and partially buried to protect against bomb blast.

After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Anderson returned to hold the joint portfolio of Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security, a position in which he served under Winston Churchill. He retained responsibility for civil defence. In October 1940, he exchanged places with Herbert Morrison and became Lord President of the Council. In July 1941 as Lord President of the Council he was appointed as minister responsible for the British effort to build an atomic bomb, known as the Tube Alloys project. He became the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1943 and remained in the post until the Labour Party&#x27;s victory in the general election in July 1945.

Anderson left the Commons when the university constituencies were abolished at the 1950 general election. He became Chairman of the Port of London Authority in 1946 and the Royal Opera House in March the same year. He rejected an offer to join Churchill&#x27;s peacetime administration when it was formed in 1951, and was created Viscount Waverley of Westdean in the County of Sussex in 1952.

== Early life ==
John Anderson was born at his parents&#x27; home at 1 Livingstone Place, Edinburgh, on 8 July 1882, the oldest child of David Alexander Pearson Anderson, a printer and stationer, and his wife Janet Kilgour née Briglmen. He had three younger siblings: a brother, Charles, who died from meningitis in infancy, and sisters Catherine (Katie) and Janet (Nettie). The family moved to Braid Hills in May 1890. He attended George Watson&#x27;s College in Edinburgh, where he was dux of the school, earning prizes for Anglo-Saxon, Old English, and Modern Languages.

In October 1899, Anderson sat the examination for students entering the University of Edinburgh, which determined order of merit for scholarships and bursaries. He was ranked eleventh, and awarded a bursary of . In his first year, he was ranked first in his class in mathematics and natural philosophy. In November 1900, the family moved to Eskbank. The previous owner of their new home had been an amateur astronomer and Anderson took over a room with a large telescope.

A neighbour, Andrew Mackenzie, had five daughters, and Anderson became the boyfriend of one of them, Christina (Chrissie) Mackenzie. In 1902 he took a bicycle tour of France and Switzerland, during which he wrote frequently to Chrissie. He graduated the following year with distinction in mathematics, physics and chemistry, earning a Bachelor of Science degree, and first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, earning a Master of Arts degree.

The Anderson, Briglmen and Mackenzie families holidayed together in summer of 1903. On 29 August they were bathing in the River Ythan when a freak wave suddenly swept Nettie Anderson and Chrissie&#x27;s sister Nellie Mackenzie into deep water. Nellie was rescued but Nettie drowned. Anderson and Chrissie were on their way to join the group at the time of the accident, but it fell to him to identify the body and inform his parents.

Along with fellow Scotsmen Joseph Henry Maclagen Wedderburn, Forsyth James Wilson and William Wilson, Anderson went to the University of Leipzig in Germany, where he intended to study physical chemistry under Wilhelm Ostwald. When he arrived he found that Ostwald had abandoned chemistry, so Anderson studied under Robert Luther instead. He chose to examine the chemistry of uranium. Although Henri Becquerel had discovered in 1896 that uranium had radioactive properties, Anderson studied only its chemical properties. On his return to Edinburgh he wrote a paper on the subject, but this was not a PhD thesis.

==Civil Service career==
===Colonial Office===
Although Anderson was a brilliant student, winning numerous prizes, he decided to forsake a career in science for one in the Civil Service. At the time this was the normal career path for graduates of the University of Edinburgh, and his father advised him that if he wished to marry Chrissie the Civil Service would offer greater job security. To prepare, he took an honours course in economics and political science. In July 1905, he travelled to London with a fellow candidate, Alexander Gray and sat the British civil service examination.

In those days a candidate could take tests in as many subjects as they liked, and Anderson took fourteen, earning a score of 4566 out of a possible 7500, which was the highest score that year and the second highest ever; Gray came second with a score of 4107 out of 7900. Anderson was offered the choice of joining the Home Civil Service or the Indian Civil Service. Most candidates preferred the latter, as salaries and allowances were higher, but Anderson&#x27;s parents did not want him to leave Britain, and he did not want to subject Chrissie to the rigours of life in India. He therefore joined the Colonial Office as a Second Class Clerk on an annual salary of .

Anderson commenced work at the Colonial Office on 23 October 1905, in the West African Department. He was known in the department as &quot;young John Anderson&quot; to distinguish him from another John Anderson who became the Governor of the Straits Settlements. In London, Anderson shared accommodation with Gray and William Paterson, a family friend from Eskbank. On 2 April 1907, he married Chrissie at St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh; Gray was his best man and Chrissie&#x27;s sister Kate and William Paterson were witnesses. The newlywed couple rented a house in Sutton, London. They had two children: David Alastair Pearson on 18 February 1911, and Mary Mackenzie on 3 February 1916.

Anderson served on Sir Kenelm Digby&#x27;s 1908 Committee on Northern Nigerian Lands. This did not involve travel to Nigeria, but the following year he went to Hamburg to meet with his German counterparts at the Hamburg Colonial Institute, where his fluency in German was useful. In 1911 he was the secretary of Lord Emmott&#x27;s departmental committee that recommended the introduction of a distinctive local currency in British West Africa.

===Great War===
In 1912, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lloyd George, introduced National Insurance, the start of the welfare state in the United Kingdom. A new government department was created to administer it, chaired by Sir Robert Morant. Anderson and Gray joined the new department. When the position of secretary of the National Insurance Commission fell vacant in May 1913, Anderson was appointed to the position over the head of many more senior civil servants. Anderson formed a good working relationship with the notoriously difficult Morant. &quot;The trouble with young John Anderson&quot;, Morant lamented, &quot;is that he is always so damned right.&quot;

Following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Anderson was involved in securing supplies of medical and surgical implements that had hitherto been imported from Germany. He summoned a group of experts to analyse and produce arsphenamine, known as &quot;606&quot;, a drug formerly sourced from Bayer in Germany. They went on to produce other substances, including aspirin. Anderson registered for service under the Derby Scheme but was placed on the Army Reserve. This did not prevent a young woman from presenting him with a white feather.

Lloyd George became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 7 December 1916, and one of his first acts was to create a Ministry of Shipping under Sir Joseph Maclay, and Morant agreed to release Anderson to become its secretary on 8 January 1917. Although it was not his idea, Anderson recognised the value of an Allied Maritime Transport Council, and threw his support behind it. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the Ministry of Shipping became embroiled in a controversy over the continuance of the blockade of Germany and the shipment of relief supplies for starving civilians. In the end the Germans agreed to turn all their ships over to the Allies to carry supplies. The vessels were eventually retained as reparations. For his wartime service with the Ministry of Shipping, Anderson was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1918 New Year Honours, and was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1919 Birthday Honours.

Anderson became a secretary of the Local Government Board in April 1919, but in July it was merged with the Health Insurance Commission to form the Ministry of Health, and Anderson became the second secretary under Morant, who had requested Anderson&#x27;s appointment as his deputy. However, Anderson did not remain in that position for long either, for on 1 October 1919 he was appointed the Chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, with an annual salary of plus war bonus, which was raised to plus on 1 March 1920.

===Ireland===
Chrissie died on 9 May 1920 during an operation for cancer, leaving Anderson a widower with two young children. Nellie Mackenzie, who was training to be a nurse at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, gave up her career to care for them. On 16 May, Anderson became Under-Secretary for Ireland. He was also the HM Treasury representative, and he became a Privy Counsellor of Ireland on 3 June 1920. The administrative arrangements were unorthodox: he did not supersede his predecessor, James Macmahon, but shared the position with him. They were answerable to the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Sir Hamar Greenwood, but as a cabinet minister, Greenwood was located in London; Field Marshal French, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (known as the viceroy), had wielded special executive powers in 1918 and 1919, but in 1920 reverted to the normal figurehead powers of that post. Anderson therefore wielded great executive power. He had two assistant under-secretaries, Alfred William Cope and Mark Sturgis.

Over eighty members of the Royal Irish Constabulary had been killed during the previous year, and both numbers and morale were low. Anderson oversaw a recruitment campaign among ex-servicemen in England, Scotland and Wales. There were insufficient uniforms for them all, so they wore a mixture of khaki Army service dress and dark green Royal Irish Constabulary uniforms, giving rise to the nickname &quot;Black and Tans&quot;. Major General Hugh Tudor was given a free hand to reorganise and reequip the constabulary, and facilitated cooperation between the constabulary and the military.

In the face of an insurgency, Anderson strove to avoid the appearance that Britain was engaged in a war of reconquest. He travelled in an armoured car with a police escort, and carried a revolver. He was engaged in peace talks with the Sinn Fein, but unlike Cope he was not in his element. A settlement was brokered, and on 16 January 1922, the viceroy (Viscount FitzAlan) formally handed over power to the Provisional Government. For his service in Ireland, Anderson was made an additional Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 1923 New Year Honours.

===Home Office===
All the while Anderson was in Ireland, he was still nominally the chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, and he returned to this role in January 1922. But not for long; in March Sir Edward Troup, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office, retired and Anderson was appointed to succeed him. At the time the Home office had seven divisions, each with its own Assistant Secretary: Aliens Control, Children and Probation, Crime, Factories and Shops, Channel Islands, Northern Ireland, and Police. Anderson worked an eight-hour day, from 10:15 in the morning to 18:15 each night, with an hour and a half for lunch.

Through the Northern Ireland Division, Anderson continued to be involved with Irish issues. He helped negotiate the border between the new Irish Free State and Northern Ireland in 1923. He also chaired the 1925 Committee of Imperial Defence subcommittee on air raid precautions. That year also saw Red Friday, 31 July 1925, when the government capitulated to the demands of the Miners Federation of Great Britain to provide a subsidy of £23 million (equivalent to £ million in ) to the mining industry to maintain miners&#x27; wages and secure industrial harmony.

Appreciating that this might only temporarily stave off a major industrial dispute, the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, appointed Anderson to the chairmanship of an inter-departmental committee to prepare for one. Each department was allocated a specific role: the Board of Trade stockpiled food and coal, the Ministry of Transport arranged for distribution, and the Home Office was responsible for keeping law and order. When the UK General Strike of 1926 commenced on 4 May 1926, Anderson had been preparing for the eventuality for nine months. He was particularly determined to remain even-handed and avoid the appearance of favouring one side over the other. When Winston Churchill suggested sending the Army to the London docks to protect the supplies of paper needed to print the &quot;British Gazette&quot;, Anderson cut him off with: &quot;I would beg the chancellor of the exchequer to stop talking nonsense&quot;.

==Governor of Bengal==
Being the head of a department was the pinnacle of a Civil Service career, and by November 1931, Anderson had been the permanent under-secretary for nine years, but at age 49 he was still eleven years away from retirement. At this point an unexpected offer appeared. The Secretary of State for India, Sir Samuel Hoare, and the Under-Secretary of State for India, Sir Findlater Stewart, were searching for a successor to the Governor of Bengal, Sir Stanley Jackson. The province was a troubled one, and they thought of Anderson, based on his service in Ireland and during the General Strike of 1926. Jackson narrowly escaped an assassin&#x27;s bullet at the University of Calcutta on 6 February 1932. On 3 March, Anderson had lunch at Buckingham Palace with King George V, who made him an additional Knight Grand Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire (GCIE).
Anderson sailed from England on the on 10 March 1932, accompanied by William Paterson, Mary Anderson and Nellie Mackenzie; his son Alastair was studying medicine at Pembroke College, Cambridge. Anderson arrived in Calcutta on 29 March, and was greeted with a 17-gun salute. The position came with an annual salary of approximately , a sumptuary allowance of and a grant of to cover his staff&#x27;s wages. In addition to his personal staff he had 120 servants, a seventy-man mounted bodyguard, and a brass band. There were cars, two special trains, a yacht and a house boat.

There were government houses in Calcutta, Darjeeling, Barrackpore and Dacca. The primary residence of the governor was in Calcutta, but when the weather became hot in April the governor and his staff would move to Darjeeling, returning when the monsoon broke in June. Each year they would spend a month in Dacca in fulfilment of a promise made when Bengal was reunited in 1911. They would then go back to Darjeeling, remaining until it became cold, and then return to Calcutta. Anderson visited all twenty-six districts of Bengal, usually travelling by train, but sometimes by river on a towed barge he named the &quot;Mary Anderson&quot; after his daughter. He regularly attended church services at St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Calcutta and St Columba&#x27;s Church in Darjeeling. On 26 March 1933, he was ordained as an Elder of the Church of Scotland at St Andrew&#x27;s.

Anderson recognised that the root of Bengal&#x27;s problems was financial. The chief source of revenue was collected under the terms of the Permanent Settlement of Bengal that had been concluded by Lord Cornwallis in 1793 and taxed landowners known as zamindars based on the value of their land. Other forms of taxation, such as income tax and export duties were collected by the central government and little was returned to Bengal. As a result, public infrastructure, such as police, education and health, had been run down. The export duty on the jute trade was particularly unfair, as it had been imposed during the Great War when the trade was booming, but by 1932 the trade was in decline due to competition from paper and cotton bags. The global Great Depression caused the prices of agricultural commodities to fall. Anderson negotiated a revision of the financial arrangements with Sir Otto Niemeyer, under which the provinces retained half of their income tax and jute duty receipts and provincial debts to the central government were cancelled.

The other major task that Anderson confronted was dealing with terrorism. Collective fines were imposed on areas that sheltered or supported terrorists, and the funds used to increase the police presence. He was aware that he was a target, but as the King&#x27;s representative he continued to make public appearances, travelling in a Rolls-Royce or an open horse-drawn carriage. On 8 May 1934 a would-be assassin fired at Anderson but the bullet passed between him and Nellie Mackenzie, and the man was wrestled to the ground by Charles William Tandy-Green. A second man fired but also missed Anderson, though wounded the ankle of a teenager sitting behind the governor, and was tackled by Bhupendra Narayan Singh. Tandy-Green and Singh were awarded the Empire Gallantry Medal, which they exchanged for the George Cross in 1940. Five other members of the gang attempted to escape but were captured. The would-be assassins were sentenced to hang, but Anderson commuted the sentences of two of them. By 1935 he was described as the world&#x27;s most-shot-at-man, having survived three assassination attempts. Anderson tackled the problem of what to do with détenus, individuals who had been detained without trial on suspicion of terrorism by giving them training for jobs in agriculture and manufacturing.

Anderson carried out a series of economic and social programs. He waged a campaign against water hyacinth, an invasive plant species that threatened to clog Bengal&#x27;s waterways. He regulated jute production through a system of voluntarily restrictions. He established a panel that examined the problem of rural debt, and sponsored legislation to reduce the debts of farmers. He introduced compulsory primary school education. The Government of India Act 1935 was scheduled to become operative on 1 April 1937, soon after his five-year term of office was due to expire, but at the request of the Secretary of State for India, the Marquess of Zetland, and the viceroy, the Marquess of Linlithgow, Anderson agreed to a six-month extension in order to oversee the transition to self-government, but declined a request from Zetland for his term to be further extended. For his services in India, Anderson was appointed a Knight Grand Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India (GCSI) on 15 December 1937, and was made a Privy Counsellor in the 1938 New Year Honours.

== Political career ==
===Pre-war===
After Ireland and Bengal, the British government could find no more dangerous assignment than Palestine, and on 24 October 1937, the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, offered Anderson the position of High Commissioner for Palestine, but he declined. Another opportunity soon presented itself. The sudden death of Ramsay MacDonald on 9 November 1937 created a casual vacancy in his Scottish Universities seat in the House of Commons, and the Unionist Party now needed to find another candidate. Sir John Graham Kerr, another member for the Scottish Universities, discussed this with Sir Kenneth Pickthorn, one of the members for Cambridge University, who suggested that Anderson might make a worthy candidate. Kerr contacted Katie Anderson, who informed him that Anderson was still en route for the UK on the liner SS &quot;Comorin&quot;.

Anderson arrived back in London on 11 December 1937. He spoke to Kerr, and agreed to stand for election as a National Government candidate without a party label. His candidacy was announced on 4 January 1938. Voting was by postal ballot, which meant that Anderson did not have to campaign but only needed to provide a statement of his political philosophy. In this he affirmed his support for the National Government and gave a qualified support for Scottish nationalism. The results were announced on 28 February; Anderson received more votes than any other candidate, and was declared the winner. He took his seat on 2 March and, after a holiday in Switzerland with Mary Anderson and Nellie Mackenzie, made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 1 June. The occasion was a debate over the provision of funding authorised under the Air Raid Precaution Act of 1937, a subject that he had previously been involved with and with which he would come to be identified.
Mary Anderson and Nellie Mackenzie had preceded Anderson to England and rented a house at 11 Chepstow Villas in Notting Hill for nine guineas a week (). Although this was a bargain, Anderson feared that his income would not be sufficient to keep up the rental payments. Before leaving Calcutta he accepted a directorship from the Midland Bank, and after his return to England he joined the boards of Vickers, Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and the Employers Liability Assurance Corporation. The directors&#x27; fees gave him an annual income of around . He was approached by members of the board of Imperial Airways who were seeking a new full-time chairman with an offer of more than twice that amount. However, Chamberlain stipulated that if he accepted then he would have to resign his other directorships and his seat in the House of Commons at the next general election, which was due in 1940. Anderson therefore declined the appointment. He would sometimes go horse riding in Hyde Park with Mary Anderson, but sought a more rural environment. He disposed of the house in Chepstow Villas in October and bought a property near Merstham in December. During the week he lived with William Paterson and his wife.

In May 1938, Hoare, who was now the Home Secretary, appointed Anderson to chair a new Committee on Evacuation to examine the problems involved in evacuating people and industries from densely populated industrial areas in the event of a war. Over the next eight weeks the committee held twenty-five meetings and examined fifty-seven witnesses. The committee submitted its report in July. The scheme outlined in the report was implemented when the Second World War broke out in September 1939. Meanwhile, in October 1938 Anderson entered Chamberlain&#x27;s ministry as Lord Privy Seal. In that capacity, he was put in charge of civil defence. He initiated the development of a type of air-raid shelter, and engaged William Paterson to design it. Paterson worked with his co-director, Oscar Carl (Karl) Kerrison, and together they devised a small sheet metal cylinder made of prefabricated pieces which could be assembled in a garden and partially buried to protect against bomb blast. It became known as the Anderson shelter. When war broke out in September 1939, some 1.5 million Anderson shelters had been delivered.

===War time===

Under a pre-arranged plan, on the outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, Anderson exchanged places with Hoare and became Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security. In the wake of the Norwegian campaign Chamberlain resigned on 10 May 1940 and Winston Churchill became the Prime Minister but Anderson stayed on as Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security in the new coalition government. Measures taken in Ireland and Bengal were now applied to the UK. Anderson created special tribunals to assess the reliability of aliens resident in the UK. He informed the House of Commons that of the 73,353 aliens in the UK, no less than 55,457 were refugees from Nazi oppression; only 569 were interned. However, as the tide of war turned against the UK, the pressure to act against aliens grew, and on 16 May some 3,000 men whose reliability was classed as uncertain were interned, and in June 3,500 women and children were sent to the Isle of Man. Anderson then decided to intern refugees previously considered reliable, and some 8,000 were transported to Canada and Australia. One transport, the was sunk by a U-boat. Members of the Communist Party of Great Britain, the Peace Pledge Union and the British Union of Fascists were rounded up. In June 1945, there were still 1,847 persons held in detention under Defence Regulation 18B.

Once the Blitz began, the contingencies that Anderson had been preparing for were realised, and Anderson came under heavy attack in the press and the House of Commons over the issue of not providing deep shelters. On 8 October 1940, in a reshuffle precipitated by Chamberlain&#x27;s resignation due to ill-health, Anderson was replaced by Herbert Morrison, a less able administrator, but a more adept politician. Anderson became Lord President of the Council and full member of the War Cabinet. The Lord President served as chairman of the Lord President&#x27;s Committee. This committee acted as a central clearing house which dealt with the country&#x27;s economic problems. This was vital to the smooth running of the British war economy and consequently the entire British war effort. Anderson had no staff of his own, but used that of the War Cabinet, particularly its Economic Section. As chairman of the Manpower Committee, he controlled the allocation of the most critical of wartime resources: people.
In 1941, Anderson began courting Ava Wigram, the daughter of the historian John Edward Courtenay Bodley, and the widow of Ralph Wigram, a senior civil servant who served in the British Embassy in Paris during the 1930s and died in 1936. Their only child, Charles, was born severely disabled in 1929. Anderson arranged with King George VI for himself and Ava to be married in the Chapel Royal at St James&#x27;s Palace. The ceremony was officiated by Edward Woods, the Bishop of Lichfield; Alastair Anderson was the best man; and while John&#x27;s father felt that he was too old to travel, Mary and Katie Anderson were there, as was William Paterson. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon at Polesden Lacey. They now owned three houses between them, so they sold them and bought the Mill House at Isfield in September 1942.

As Lord President of the Council, Anderson was the minister responsible for several scientific organisations, including the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Agricultural Research Council and the Medical Research Council. In August 1941, Anderson became the cabinet minister responsible for the oversight of the British project to build an atomic bomb, known as the Tube Alloys project. A special section of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was created to manage it, under the leadership of Wallace Akers. Anderson negotiated cooperation with the Americans at the Second Washington Conference in June 1942, but after the establishment of the Manhattan Project later that year cooperation broke down. In response to a request from the Americans, Anderson flew to Washington, D.C., on 1 August 1943 for negotiations with James B. Conant and Vannevar Bush. He had to reassure the Americans that Britain&#x27;s interest was in winning the war, and not in profits to be made from nuclear energy afterwards. He then moved on to Canada for negotiations with officials there. The culmination of his efforts was the signing of the Quebec Agreement on 19 August 1943, which paved the way for the British contribution to the Manhattan Project. In 1945 Anderson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society under Statute 12, which covered those who &quot;rendered conspicuous service to the cause of science, and whose election would be of signal benefit to the Society&quot;.

Following the unexpected death on 21 September 1943 of Sir Kingsley Wood, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Anderson was appointed to that office on 24 September. He retained responsibility for Tube Alloys, and his chairmanship of the Manpower Committee. As Chancellor, he introduced the pay-as-you-earn tax system that had been devised by Paul Chambers; the enabling legislation was to have been introduced by Wood on the day that he died. The system was very successful, and was gradually extended to all employers except the armed forces. In a written Commons answer of 12 June 1945, he announced the creation of the Arts Council of Great Britain, a successor body to the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA).
In January 1945, Churchill wrote to King George VI to advise that should he and his second-in-command (and heir apparent) Anthony Eden die during the war, John Anderson should become Prime Minister: &quot;it is the Prime Minister&#x27;s duty to advise Your Majesty to send for Sir John Anderson in the event of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary being killed.&quot; Although not a member of a political party, Churchill thought Anderson had the abilities to lead the National Government, and that an independent figure was essential to the maintenance of the coalition. During the Yalta Conference Anderson opposed the Soviet Union&#x27;s demands for war reparations from Germany because of the role World War I reparations played in the Great Depression and the collapse of the Weimar Republic.

After Germany surrendered on 7 May 1945, Churchill unsuccessfully attempted to broker a continuation of the wartime coalition government until after the end of the war with Japan, which was thought at the time to be over a year away. On 23 May Churchill then submitted his resignation to the King, who called an election for 5 July. Anderson retained his role of Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Churchill caretaker ministry, and remained in the post until the Labour victory in the general election in July 1945. He was returned in his Scottish University electorate, along with Sir John Graham Kerr and Sir John Boyd Orr.
On 29 June 1945, Churchill had initialled a minute from Anderson, seeking &quot;authority to instruct our representatives on the Combined Policy Committee to give their concurrence for the use of the atomic bomb against Japan.&quot; After the bombing of Hiroshima, Anderson gave a broadcast on the BBC Home Service on 7 August 1945 in which he described the challenges and potentialities of nuclear energy in layman&#x27;s terms.

===Post-war===
The new Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, appointed Anderson the chairman of the new Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy on 14 August 1945. On 9 November, he accompanied Attlee to Washington, D.C., for talks on atomic energy with President Harry S. Truman and Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King. Talks took place on the presidential yacht . The President and the two Prime Ministers were joined by Anderson; the President&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy; the United States Secretary of State, James F. Byrnes; Lord Halifax; and Lester B. Pearson. They agreed to continue the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust, and agreed to collaborate, but the Americans soon made it clear that this extended only to basic research. The 1946 McMahon Act ended all cooperation on nuclear weapons. On 7 January 1948, with the post-war British atomic weapons project in full swing and being managed by other committees, Anderson tendered his resignation from the Advisory Committee.

Anderson left the Commons on 23 February 1950 at the general election, when the university constituencies were abolished. He declined offers from the Ulster Unionist Party to contest a safe seat in Northern Ireland, and from Churchill to contest the blue-ribbon Conservative Party seat of East Surrey. At the Boat Race 1951, Attlee tried to get Ava to persuade Anderson to accept a peerage, but Anderson still hoped that university constituencies would be restored and he could contest his old seat. He rejected an offer to become the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in Churchill&#x27;s peacetime administration when it was formed in October 1951; Churchill had wanted Anderson to be an &quot;overlord&quot; of the Exchequer, Board of Trade and Supply, but he declined thinking such an arrangement inappropriate in peacetime. He was created Viscount Waverley, of Westdean in the County of Sussex, on 29 January 1952.

Meanwhile, Anderson had become Chairman of the Port of London Authority in 1946 and Chairman of the Royal Opera House in March the same year. He also became a director of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. He resumed his membership of the boards of ICI, Vickers and the Employers&#x27; Life Assurance Corporation that he had given up when he became a minister, but not the Midland Bank, which in those days would have been considered improper for a former Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Port of London Authority chairman had often been part time and unpaid in the past, but now that a full-time role was called for Anderson insisted on being paid, and was given an annual salary of . The job was an immense one, as the port had been badly damaged by bombing during the war, and a major reconstruction effort was called for. Ava used the Port Authority&#x27;s yacht, the &quot;St Katharine&quot;, to hold party cruises on the river around the London Docks for special guests, and invitations were highly sought after.

In addition to British honours and awards, Anderson received many awards from other countries. These included being made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour by France; a Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy; the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Olav of Norway, the Order of the North Star of Sweden, of the Military Order of Christ of Portugal, and the Order of the Dannebrog of Denmark. He was awarded an honorary D.C.L. by Oxford University, and honorary D.Sc. by McGill University, and honorary LL.D. by the University of Edinburgh, University of Aberdeen, University of Cambridge, University of St Andrews, University of Liverpool, University of Leeds, University of Sheffield and the University of London, and was an Honorary Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. It was intended that he should be awarded the Order of Merit in the 1958 New Year Honours but an operation on 17 August 1957 revealed that he had pancreatic cancer, and it was feared he would not live long enough to receive it, so Queen Elizabeth II made an immediate award, which was conferred at his hospital bed. He died on 4 January 1958 in St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, and was buried in the churchyard in Westdean.

<text>In military aviation, a wing is a unit of command. In most military aviation services, a wing is a relatively large formation of planes. In Commonwealth countries a wing usually comprises three squadrons, with several wings forming a group (around 10 squadrons). Each squadron will contain around 20 planes.

== Commonwealth usage ==
=== Origins ===
On its establishment in 1912, the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was intended to be an inter-service, combined force of the British Army and Royal Navy. Given the rivalry that existed between the army and navy, new terminology was used, in order to avoid marking the corps out as having an army or navy ethos. While the term &quot;wing&quot; had been used in the cavalry, its more general use predominated. Accordingly, the word &quot;wing&quot;, with its allusion of flight, was chosen as the term of subdivision and the corps was split into a &quot;Military Wing&quot; (i.e. an army wing) and a &quot;Naval Wing&quot;. Each wing consisted of a number of squadrons (the term &quot;squadron&quot; already being used by both the Army and the Navy).

By 1914, the naval wing had become the Royal Naval Air Service, and gained its independence from the Royal Flying Corps. In 1915, the Royal Flying Corps had significantly expanded and it was felt necessary to create organizational units which would control two or more squadrons; the term &quot;wing&quot; was re-used for these new organizational units.

The Royal Flying Corps was amalgamated with the Royal Naval Air Service in 1918, creating the Royal Air Force. The RFC usage of wing was maintained in the new service.

===Current use===

In most Commonwealth air forces, as well as some others, a wing is usually made up of three or four squadrons. In these air forces a wing is inferior to a group. Originally all wings were usually commanded by a wing commander (equivalent to a lieutenant colonel). From World War II onwards, operational flying wings have usually been commanded by group captains (equivalent to colonels), whereas ground-based wings have continued to be commanded by wing commanders.

Air forces of NATO member countries which use the term &#x27;wing&#x27; to denote their main formations include the Spanish Air Force (&quot;Ala&quot;), the Hellenic Air Force (&quot;πτέρυγα&quot; [&quot;pteryga&quot;]), Royal Norwegian Air Force (&quot;luftving&quot;, Norwegian for air wing), Royal Danish Air Force (which adopted the English term &quot;wing&quot; directly, although the Danish word is &quot;vinge&quot;), the Belgian Air Component (also adopted the English term &quot;wing&quot; directly), the Polish Air Force (&quot;skrzydło&quot;) and the Slovak Air Force (&quot;krídlo&quot;).

Additionally countries influenced by the US in the building of their modern air forces also use the term &quot;wing&quot;. Several such examples are the Republic of Korea Air Force, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, the Royal Thai Air Force, the Philippine Air Force, the Peruvian Air Force, the Venezuelan Air Force, the Ecuadorian Air Force and the Brazilian Air Force.

A wing may also be used for non-flying units, such as the infantry forces of the RAF Regiment, (in which a wing equates to a battalion). Additionally, RAF stations are administratively divided into wings.

In 2006, expeditionary air wings were established at the RAF&#x27;s main operating bases. These expeditionary air wings consist of the deployable elements of the main operating base and other supplementary forces. Expeditionary air wings may be subordinated to an expeditionary air group.

In the British Air Training Corps, a wing consists of a number of squadrons within a designated geographical area, usually named after the county in which it is based. In this context, a wing is inferior to a &quot;region&quot; which is made up of six wings. In all, there are 36 Air Training Corps wings in six regions within the United Kingdom, each of which is commanded by a RAFVR(T) wing commander.

== Canadian usage ==
While the original pre-unification Royal Canadian Air Force followed the British pattern and used squadrons, which belonged to wings, which in turn belonged to groups, the modern Royal Canadian Air Force has eliminated groups. Squadrons still report to wings which now report to one of two air divisions. Wings vary greatly in size and may comprise personnel numbering in the hundreds or thousands.

In the 1990s, the Canadian Forces Air Command (the post-1968 RCAF until 2011) altered the structure of those bases under its control, declaring them to be wings under the overall control of 1 Canadian Air Division in Winnipeg. For instance, CFB Trenton in Ontario was redesignated 8 Wing Trenton. The base commander of these bases (as well as other wings whose headquarters were stood up on bases not controlled by Air Command, such as 16 Wing at CFB Borden and 1 Wing at CFB Kingston) were re-designated Wing Commanders (or Wg Comd). As well as continuing their functions as the commanding officers of the bases they were assigned to, they also serve as formation commanders to all squadrons and units duly assigned to them by 1 Canadian Air Division or 2 Canadian Air Division (regardless if they are physically located on the base in question or elsewhere; as witness 12 Wing in Nova Scotia, which has one unit, 443 Maritime Helicopter Squadron, based at Patricia Bay near CFB Esquimalt in British Columbia, on the other side of the country from Shearwater).

== United States ==
=== United States Air Force &amp; Civil Air Patrol ===

By comparison, in the United States Air Force, a wing is normally the organizational tier below a Numbered Air Force. Most USAF wings are commanded by a colonel, but some are commanded by brigadier generals. USAF wings are structured to fulfill a mission from a specific base, and contain a headquarters and four groups: an operations group, a maintenance group, a medical group and a mission support group. Such a wing is referred to as a Combat Wing Organization, which is comparable to a brigade in the US Army. Other wings, such as Air Expeditionary Wings, exist for various other purposes, and their scope may extend to one base, one theater or worldwide.

In United States Air Force usage, a military organization above a squadron level (group, wing, air division, numbered air force, air component command, Major Command (MAJCOM)) is an &quot;establishment&quot;, while that of a squadron and lower (squadron, flight, center, complex), if designated as such, is a &quot;unit&quot;.

The U.S. Army Air Service/U.S. Army Air Corps/U.S. Army Air Forces wings that existed before 1947 are not comparable with the wings of the USAF. World War II wings, for example, were expansive administrative and operational organizations that usually controlled several combat groups and numerous service organizations, often located at widely scattered locations. Many World War II wings were redesignated as air divisions after the war. Modern wings began with a service test of combat wings in 1947-1948. These wings were temporary Table of Distribution (T/D) organizations, each having a combat group (the only Table of Organization establishment of the wings), an airdrome group, a maintenance and supply group, and a station medical group. At the end of the service test, the Air Force implemented the Hobson Plan and replaced these T/D wings with permanent Table of Organization and Equipment (&quot;constituted&quot;) combat wings having a combat group, an air base group, a maintenance and supply group, and a medical group.

&quot;Constituted&quot; combat wings are always numbered in a single series beginning with Arabic &quot;1st&quot;. Examples: 1st Fighter Wing, 21st Space Wing, and the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s 509th Bomb Wing. All &quot;constituted&quot; wings have one, two, or three digits in their numerical designations.

In many cases, the numerical designation of the wing &quot;came from the combat group that preceded it&quot; and became an integral part of the post-World War II wing. In other words, when the 14th Fighter Wing (later, 14th Flying Training Wing) came into existence, it received the 14th numerical designation from the 14th Fighter Group, which had already existed for several years and became the wing&#x27;s combat component. At the same time, the other component establishments, and units of these establishments, also received the 14th numerical designations, aligning each of them directly to the 14th Wing. However, the tactical squadrons of the combat group retained their separate and distinct numerical designations.

The Air Force has three basic types of wings: operational, air base, and specialized mission. According to Air Force Instruction 38-101 (1994):
* an &quot;operational wing&quot; is a wing that has an operations group and related operational mission activity assigned to it. When an operational wing performs the primary mission of the base, it usually maintains and operates the base. In addition, an operational wing is capable of self-support in functional areas like maintenance, supply, and munitions, as needed. When an operational wing is a tenant organization, the host command provides it with varying degrees of base and logistics support.
* An &quot;air base wing&quot; usually maintains and operates a base, and often provides functional support to a major command headquarters.
* A &quot;specialized mission wing&quot; may be either a host wing or a tenant wing and performs a specialized mission such as intelligence or training.&quot;

In the Civil Air Patrol, there are 52 wings (each of the 50 states plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico). Each wing supervises the individual groups and squadrons in that state, district or commonwealth, which are the basic operational units of the organization. Some wings, for example Delaware Wing, have only one group due to the small geographical and manpower size of the wing.

=== U.S. Naval Aviation (U.S. Navy and Marine Corps) ===
The United States Navy follows the British structure in that a wing is an administrative formation commanding two or more squadrons of aircraft that are based on land. Several wings are combined into a Naval Air Force. The several wings assigned to each Fleet Naval Air Force control the wing&#x27;s type squadrons. A carrier air wing (CVW, formerly known as a carrier air group) consists of several squadrons and is an operational formation that is based on an aircraft carrier. The squadrons of a CVW are also assigned to administrative type wings (such as Strike Fighter Wing Atlantic). Naval Air Forces are commanded by either a rear admiral (upper half) or a vice admiral and wings are commanded by captains, with the title of commodore. Carrier air wings are commanded by either a Navy captain or a USMC colonel with the title of &quot;CAG&quot; (Commander, Air Group), a legacy title from the former carrier air groups.

In the United States Marine Corps, a Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW) is an overall command, equivalent to a Marine Division, consisting of at least two Marine Aircraft Groups, a Marine Air Control Group (MACG), a Marine Wing Headquarters Squadron (MWHS), and a Marine Wing Headquarters (the Wing Commander and his staff). Being equivalent to a division in size, its commander is usually a major general.

Unlike their USAF counterparts, all USN and USMC air wings are tenant activities ashore and have no command responsibility for the installation at which they are normally based when not afloat or forward deployed. Naval air stations and Marine Corps air stations (and facilities) have separate commanding officers that are independent of the operational wing structure. Many mission support functions on these installations, such as personnel support and medical/dental facilities, are also independent of both the air wing and air station command structures and are independent tenant commands with their own commanding officers or officers-in-charge.

=== United States Space Force ===

The United States Space Force has a single command echelon known as a delta which combines the wing and group echelons found in air forces.

== Equivalents in other languages ==
In other languages, equivalent air force units equivalent to a US wing include: &quot;Geschwader&quot; in the German Luftwaffe; &quot;Aviatsionniy Polk&quot; (Aviation Regiment) in Russia; &quot;Stormo&quot; in Italy; and &quot;escadre&quot; or &quot;régiment&quot; in the French Air Force. (&quot;Escadre&quot; is also the official Canadian French translation of wing in the Canadian Forces.) The French &quot;Escadre&quot; and the German &quot;Geschwader&quot; originate from the naval term squadron. A similar formation in the Swedish Air Force is the Flygflottilj, which translates in English as air wing (literal meaning is air flotilla or flight flotilla). Among the NATO member countries the Turkish Air Force (&quot;Ana Üssü&quot;, Turkish for &quot;main base&quot;) and the Bulgarian Air Force (&quot;авиобаза&quot; [&quot;aviobaza&quot;], Bulgarian for &quot;air base&quot; or &quot;aviation base&quot;) use the term &quot;air base&quot; for their main formations. These air bases are brigade-equivalents commanded by brigadier generals unlike the air wings of other NATO members, which are regiment-equivalents commanded by colonels. The Royal Netherlands Air Force (&quot;vliegbasis&quot;, Dutch for &quot;aviation base&quot; or &quot;air base&quot;), the Portuguese Air Force (&quot;base aérea&quot;), the Czech Air Force (&quot;základna letectva&quot;, Czech for &quot;air base&quot; or &quot;aviation base&quot;) and the Croatian Air Force (&quot;zrakoplovna baza&quot;, Croatian for &quot;aviation base&quot;) use the term air base for regiment-equivalents commanded by colonels in a direct parallel to the wings of other member states.
Non-English equivalents of the British wing include the German &quot;Gruppe&quot;, Italian &quot;Gruppo&quot;, and French &quot;groupe&quot;.

=== German usage in World War II ===
The World War II German Luftwaffe &quot;Geschwader&quot; and &quot;Gruppe&quot; were similar to the wing and group of the United States Army Air Forces of the same era.

<doc id="601380" wikidata="Q1623086" url="?curid=601380" title="Hector Barbossa">
<text>Captain Hector Barbossa is a fictional character of the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; franchise, depicted by Geoffrey Rush and appearing in all five films in the series. Barbossa debuted in &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (2003) as the captain of the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; and a cursed undead skeleton, where he dies at the end of the film. However, the character is revealed to have been resurrected and brought back from the dead by Tia Dalma by the end of &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;, and has since appeared in an anti-heroic role. 

Captain Barbossa was also one of the nine Pirate Lords in &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007), a privateer in service to King George II and the British Navy while also seeking revenge against Blackbeard in &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot; (2011), as well as a rich rogue and influential leader of a prosperous pirate empire and fleet in &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; (2017). Throughout the series, Barbossa has been conceptualized as a &quot;dark trickster&quot; and the evil counterpart of Captain Jack Sparrow. 

==Background and development==
Originally, Rush was second choice for the role behind Robert De Niro, who turned it down as he expected the film to flop like previous pirate films did; he regretted this decision later, and accepted the role of Captain Shakespeare in the movie &quot;Stardust&quot;. While in the first film, Barbossa was conceptualized as a villain, as a &quot;dark trickster&quot; and evil counterpart to Jack Sparrow, Rush felt that he was playing the unsung hero of the film, who only dreamed about lifting the curse and living as a rich rogue with his prized pirate bride. Johnny Depp proposed the character&#x27;s first name &quot;Hector&quot; on set of the first film, although it is never mentioned in the film, but rather only in the DVD commentary. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio originally thought it was fan-made when they saw it on the Internet, and decided to use it nonetheless. Actor Geoffrey Rush has expressed fondness with the potential and development of his character, who evolved throughout the series and ventured into different terrains every film, which kept him challenged as an actor: while he was only a classical evil villain in the first film, he turned into a pirate politician, hosting a &quot;G 20 summit of pirate lords&quot;, and in the fourth films has turned legitimate and works for the king. As for the fifth installment, Rush has referred to Barbossa as a &quot;corporate pirate&quot; who has amassed immense influence and wealth for his fleet and brags of his showcased riches, although it is revealed in the fifth film that part of the reason Barbossa turned to piracy was the difficult feelings he had to live with after giving up his daughter for adoption. Also, he commented on the selfless sacrifice Barbossa makes to save his daughter, referring to it as a nice and final conclusion to the character&#x27;s journey of redemption. Due to this, Rush stated that he cannot see himself portraying the character in a potential sequel again, with the exception of a short cameo as a ghost &quot;annoying Jack Sparrow with his wisdom.&quot; Barbossa&#x27;s name is based on Ottoman admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa.

==Fictional character biography==
===Before the films===
Information concerning Barbossa&#x27;s childhood and youth stem from actor Geoffrey Rush, who devised a backstory for the character in order to portray him more convincingly. According to Rush, Barbossa was born to an impoverished Portuguese noblewoman by an unknown father and hailed from Lisbon in Portugal, though Jack Sparrow surmises a Cornish origin based upon his accent in &quot;The Price of Freedom&quot;. Longing to escape a life of poverty, he ran away from home aged 13 to pursue life as a sailor. At first, Barbossa wanted to be an honest sailor with the merchant marine, but seeing the grandeur of the captains&#x27; cabins on the ships on which he served, he realized that a man from his station could never afford a lifestyle like that whilst remaining an honest sailor, choosing a life of piracy instead.

Nothing is known about his early exploits as a pirate prior to &quot;The Price of Freedom&quot;. In the novel, Barbossa, in his early 40s, is the captain of the pirate schooner &quot;Cobra&quot;. After plundering a French ivory barque, his ship is attacked and sunk by a crew of rogue pirates, and he is narrowly saved from drowning by his crew members Pintel and Ragetti. After managing to reach Tortuga, the then-Pirate Lord of the Caribbean brings them to Shipwreck Cove to report the incident to an assembly of pirates. A few months later, Jack Sparrow finds out that the attacker is Barbossa&#x27;s old friend Boris Palachnik, the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea. The attackers are brought before a pirate court that summons Davy Jones, who confirms Palachnik&#x27;s guilt. Visiting Palachnik in prison, Barbossa is unknowingly granted the title of Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea, as Palachnik gives him his Piece of Eight and his ship. However, before Barbossa can claim his new vessel, the rogue pirates break out of prison and escape on his ship. After that, he is intent to join Captain Teague&#x27;s hunting party and has his Piece of Eight carved into a wooden eye for his crew mate Ragetti.

At some point, after Jack Sparrow attains the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, Hector Barbossa joins him as his first mate. The original backstory was that Jack recruited Barbossa and his cronies, including Pintel and Ragetti, prior to the voyage to Isla de Muerta. However, Hector Barbossa was first mate in the quest for the Shadow Gold in the &quot;Legends of the Brethren Court&quot; book series, where Tia Dalma tasks them with securing seven vials of shadow gold to stop the evil Shadow Lord from gaining total control over the seas by destroying the Brethren Court with his Shadow Army. Over the course of the novels, they are able to collect all vials shattered across the world by allying with or fighting against the other Pirate Lords. They are able to defeat the Shadow Lord with the combined efforts of all Pirate Lords, after which Jack wants to sail for Tortuga to recruit a new crew. Barbossa offers him to handle that in his stead, implying that he recruited men with the intent to mutiny against his captain.

Ten years before the events of &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, Barbossa was first mate aboard the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; prior to the mutiny against Jack Sparrow, having recruited a crew at Tortuga, notably Pintel and Ragetti. Sparrow told Barbossa and the rest of the crew about the curse, though nobody believed this ghost story. Captain and crew agreed to equal shares of the treasure, but devious first mate Barbossa persuaded Jack that equal shares included knowing the treasure&#x27;s location. Jack complied, and soon after Barbossa led a mutiny and marooned Jack on an island with nothing but a pistol containing one shot. Jack hates Barbossa for having violated the code. Barbossa&#x27;s crew finds the treasure, take every bit of the gold, including Barbossa&#x27;s monkey Jack, though at that point had no name. Then as they go out partying, carousing, they discover that they were cursed. Barbossa&#x27;s crew learned how to undo the curse, most likely by going back to read the Aztec writing on the chest, by learning that they needed to put all the gold back. Bootstrap Bill had been feeling guilty because of what they did to Jack and sent one piece of the gold to Will in England, he never wanted the pirates to be able to lift the curse. Barbossa got ticked off and strapped Bootstrap Bill to a cannon, and dropped him into the crushing depths of Davy Jones&#x27; Locker. However, they find out that all the pirates had to get all the gold back and add their blood to the chest.

====&quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;====
Captain Hector Barbossa, now only known as Barbossa, first appears in &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (2003).

Ten years before the events of &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, Barbossa led a mutiny against Jack Sparrow and marooned him on an uncharted island. Arriving at the treasure of Isla de Muerta, 882 identical pieces of Aztec gold, they claim it and spend it all. They realize too late that the gold was cursed, dooming the crew as undead skeletons in the moonlight. Shortly after the mutiny, Barbossa has Bootstrap Bill Turner thrown overboard, attaching a cannon to his foot. The crew spend the next years retrieving the Aztec gold and amassing treasure, unable to find the last piece of gold, as Bootstrap Bill had sent it to his son Will Turner. Eight years prior to the events of the film, Barbossa sailed the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; at the crossing of England, where Will met Elizabeth Swann, who took Will&#x27;s medallion.

When Elizabeth Swann falls into the sea wearing Will&#x27;s medallion, it alerts the cursed pirates to its location. Barbossa has Port Royal attacked and Elizabeth captured, who poses as &quot;Elizabeth Turner&quot;. Mistaking her for Bootstrap Bill&#x27;s child, he takes her to the Isla de Muerta to use her blood in a ritual to break the curse, which fails. Will reveals himself as Bootstrap&#x27;s son and offers Barbossa his blood in exchange for Elizabeth&#x27;s safety. Barbossa has Elizabeth and Jack marooned on exactly the same uncharted island where he marooned Jack years earlier. Before Barbossa can perform the ritual, Jack Sparrow arrives to the island on board a Royal Navy ship and confronts Barbossa. A fight ensues between Barbossa and Jack. As Will breaks the curse, Barbossa is shot to death by his old captain.

====&quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; and &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;====
In &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;, Captain Barbossa&#x27;s undead monkey &quot;Jack&quot; appeared aboard the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; before Jack Sparrow gave the monkey to the voodoo mystic Tia Dalma as payment. While the crew of the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; visits Tia Dalma&#x27;s shack, Sparrow&#x27;s crew sees Barbossa&#x27;s corpse lying there, with only his boots visible. However, the closing scene of the film shows that Tia Dalma brought Barbossa back from the dead, with the resurrected captain biting an apple. It is later revealed in &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; that Tia Dalma is actually the sea goddess Calypso in human form, Barbossa was a Pirate Lord of the Brethren Court, and they both struck a bargain. In return for his resurrection, Barbossa agreed to summon a meeting of the Brethren so they could release the goddess from her human bonds. However, because Jack Sparrow was also a Pirate Lord, they had to go rescue him at Davy Jones&#x27; Locker, where Sparrow was taken by Davy Jones&#x27; leviathan, the Kraken.

&quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; begins with Barbossa joining forces with Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, and the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; crew in their attempt to rescue Jack from the Locker and rally the nine Pirate Lords of the Brethren Court against Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company. As Barbossa negotiates with Pirate Lord Sao Feng, who possesses the navigational charts that serve as a map to the Locker, they are interrupted by an ambush by the EITC soldiers. Having acquired Sao Feng&#x27;s map, as well as a ship and crew, Barbossa helps the crew find Jack, who first calls him &quot;Hector&quot; upon their reunion. After a series of betrayals and alliances, they reach Shipwreck Cove, where Barbossa convenes the meeting of the Pirate Lords. Barbossa proposes to free Calypso, which leads to a fight between the parties, and Elizabeth Swann is elected the new Pirate King. As negotiations fail and war is declared, Barbossa frees Calypso with the nine Pieces of Eight. The wrathful sea goddess creates a maelstrom, in which the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; battles the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;, and Barbossa officiated the marriage of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann in the fight as captain. Barbossa witnessed Will becoming the new captain of the &quot;Dutchman&quot; upon Davy Jones&#x27;s death and East India Trading Company&#x27;s defeat and retreat from the Brethren Court&#x27;s victory in battle. Later, Hector Barbossa steals the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; from Jack Sparrow once again and sails away, planning to use Sao Feng&#x27;s map to find the Fountain of Youth. However, Jack has stolen the map from him in anticipation.

====In between films====
Sometime after these events Hector Barbossa fathers Carina Smyth and leaves her in an orphanage after her mother&#x27;s death. Barbossa also lost the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; to Edward &quot;Blackbeard&quot; Teach, who attacked the ship without warning and used the power embedded in the Sword of Triton to turn the ship against his crew. This attack forced Barbossa to escape with his life by cutting off his right leg via self-dismemberment. Unbeknownst to Barbossa, who believed the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; was sunk, Blackbeard magicked the &quot;Pearl&quot; into a ship in a bottle along with a collection of conquered ships.

====&quot;On Stranger Tides&quot;====
In &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot;, set over a decade and seven years after the third film &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, it is revealed that Hector Barbossa had become a privateer in service to King George II. However, having yet to reveal the details on losing the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; and his right leg, Barbossa does not reveal his true agenda for revenge against Blackbeard as a goal since the very night it happened. When first asked by Jack Sparrow, Barbossa only stated that the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; was lost and sunk. Barbossa excelled so much at his new station that King George personally tasked him with finding the Fountain of Youth, as captain of HMS &quot;Providence&quot;. By this point, Barbossa gained much information and learned at least the basics on Blackbeard. Barbossa knows the name of Blackbeard&#x27;s ship &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, his obsession to find the Fountain of Youth, and even the importance of Blackbeard&#x27;s Sword of Triton. Barbossa specifically knew Blackbeard&#x27;s sword had the power to rule the winds of the ocean, as well as everything associated with the wind, including the ships at sea, their rigging, sails, etc. and that its powers were diminished away from the ship. To replace his missing right leg, Barbossa also started wearing a wooden peg leg with a hidden rum supply. After Jack Sparrow&#x27;s capture and escape from King George, Barbossa forces Joshamee Gibbs, now in possession of the map, into assisting him on his quest. When they arrive at White Cap Bay, the &quot;Providence&quot; is attacked by mermaids. Making their way through the jungle, Barbossa reaches the ship of Ponce de Leon in search for the two chalices required for the ritual, where he meets Jack Sparrow. The two decide to team up to retrieve the missing chalices from the Spanish camp, where they get captured, and later escape with the chalices. Before retrieving the chalices, Barbossa reveals to Sparrow his true agenda: revenge against Blackbeard for the attack on the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, which Barbossa truly believes to be sunk. Reaching the Fountain, Barbossa uses a sword poisoned using the innards of &quot;poisonous toads and engages Blackbeard in a duel, eventually mortally wounding the latter with his poisoned blade. Hector Barbossa claims Blackbeard&#x27;s ship, crew, and sword as payment for his lost leg and returns to a life of piracy. The crew look on in wonder as Barbossa used Blackbeard&#x27;s sword to unfurl the sails and fill them with wind, causing the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; to sail forward at full speed and ordered to make way for Tortuga.

====&quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;====

In &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;, set over 20 years after &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; and about one year after &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot;, Captain Hector Barbossa settled into a growing and prosperous pirate empire, taking possession of the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; as a result of defeating Captain Blackbeard and unaware of the magically shrunk &quot;Black Pearl&quot; in a bottle. Barbossa has achieved great success as a pirate and rules the Caribbean with a fleet of 10 ships, even having acquired a new golden peg leg. However, after three of his ships are sunk by the &quot;Silent Mary&quot;, the ghostly ship of the undead pirate hunter Capitán Armando Salazar, whom Jack Sparrow had unintentionally unleashed, Barbossa confronts Salazar and offers to lead him to Jack Sparrow. When Jack escapes to an island, the ghosts discover they cannot step on land, leading an enraged Salazar starts slaughtering Barbossa&#x27;s crew. Although Barbossa was able to persuade Salazar to send him to fetch Sparrow, he truly intended to double-cross Salazar and enters another uneasy alliance with Sparrow to find the Trident of Poseidon. By this point, Barbossa knows of the current state of the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; as a ship in a bottle. Barbossa helps Sparrow release the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; from its imprisonment, restoring the ship to its former glory, before taking over as captain and attempts to outrun Salazar. Upon seeing Carina&#x27;s diary, Hector realizes she is his daughter. However, Hector chooses not to tell Carina of her true parentage in order to allow her to keep her idealized picture of her father, whom she imagines to be an astronomer. When they reach the island where the Trident of Poseidon is located, a fight between the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; and the &quot;Silent Mary&quot; ensues, which later continues on the bottom of the ocean. Barbossa has himself lowered down with the ship&#x27;s anchor to rescue Jack, Henry, and Carina. When Carina falls, Barbossa catches her, revealing a tattoo of the star constellation Carina, after which Carina realizes he is her father. Barbossa sacrifices his life to protect Carina from an approaching Salazar. Following these events, Carina takes up the last name Barbossa.

According to actor, Geoffrey Rush, he may not appear in any future &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; movies. However, other interviews imply otherwise, as producer Jerry Bruckheimer said they can bring characters back, and Rush himself didn&#x27;t seem completely opposed to returning to the series because he said, &quot;[Barbossa] could come back like Hamlet&#x27;s father, as a ghost. Just to annoy Jack.&quot;

<text>Port Klang () is the principal port of Malaysia on the Strait of Malacca. Known during colonial times as Port Swettenham () but renamed Port Klang in July 1972, it is the largest port in the country. It is located about southwest of the town of Klang, and southwest of Kuala Lumpur.

Port Klang was also known as the &quot;National Load Centre&quot;.

Located in the District of Klang, it was the 14th busiest container port (2022) in the world. It was also the 12th busiest port in by volume (million TEU) in 2018 and was the top location for aluminium stockholding for LME, the top metal exchange in the world.

==History==
Klang was formerly the terminus of the government railway and the port of the State. In 1880, the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to the more strategically advantageous Kuala Lumpur. Rapid development at the new administrative centre in the late 1800s attracted businessmen and job seekers alike from Klang. At this time the only methods of transport between Klang and Kuala Lumpur were by horse or buffalo drawn wagons, or boat ride along the Klang River to Damansara. Due to this Frank Swettenham stated to Selangor&#x27;s British Resident at the time, William Bloomfield Douglas, that the journey to Kuala Lumpur was &quot;rather long and boring&quot;. He continued to suggest a train line be built as an alternative route.

In September 1882, Sir Frank Athelstane Swettenham was appointed Selangor&#x27;s new Resident. Swettenham initiated a rail link between Klang and Kuala Lumpur to overcome the transport problems, particularly of the tin mining interests who needed to convey the ore to Klang&#x27;s port, Pelabuhan Batu. Nineteen and a half miles of rail track from Kuala Lumpur to Bukit Kudu was opened in September 1886, and extended 3 miles to Klang in 1890. River navigation, however, was difficult, as only ships drawing less than of water could come up the jetty, and thus a new port was selected near the mouth of the river as the anchorage was good. Developed by the Malayan Railway and officially opened 15 years later on 15 September 1901 by Swettenham himself, the new port was named &quot;Port Swettenham&quot;.

===British control ===
Both Klang and Port Swettenham were already known as notoriously malaria prone localities with the port itself located on a mangrove swamp. Within two months of its opening, the port was closed due to an outbreak of malaria. Just a few years before, the British doctor Sir Ronald Ross had proved in 1897 that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes; Port Swettenham was the first colonial area to benefit from the discovery. Swamps were filled in, jungle cleared, and surface water diverted to destroy mosquito breeding grounds and combat further disruption to port operations. The threat of malaria was removed completely by the end of the exercise. Trade grew rapidly and two new berths were added by 1914 along with other port facilities. The Selangor Polo Club was founded in Port Swettenham in 1902 but it moved to Kuala Lumpur in 1911.

Between World Wars I and II, the port experienced much growth and expansion, peaking in 1940 when tonnage rose to 550,000 tonnes. During the Second World War Allied aircraft were serviced by RAF Servicing Commandos at airfields in Port Swettenham. Its location is marked on a 1954 map by the United States Army. Much of the port&#x27;s facilities that were damaged during the war were reconstructed. The port expanded to the south with permanent installations to handle more palm oil and latex, two increasingly important exports. Imports also grew tremendously, and tonnage of cargo handled at the port far exceeded what was thought possible before the war.

===Post-independence===
On 1 July 1963, the Malaysian government established the Port Swettenham Authority, which was subsequently changed to Port Klang Authority, as a statutory corporation to take over the administration of Port Klang from the Malayan Railway Administration. In the late 1960s and 1970s new deepwater berths were constructed with wharves suitable for handling container as well as conventional cargoes. The Royal Selangor Yacht Club was first registered here as &quot;Port Swettenham Yacht Club&quot; in July 1969. In November 1972, Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak declared the container terminal open and in May 1974, construction of seven more berths for bulk cargo began and was completed in 1983. In October 1982, construction of the liquid bulk terminal in North Port was completed.

On 17 March 1986, the container terminal facilities operated by Port Klang Authority was privatised to Klang Container Terminal Berhad as part of the privatisation exercise of the government. In January 1988, construction work began on a new berth, as an alternative to the immediate development of West Port. A government directive in 1993 has identified Port Klang to be developed into the National Load Centre. Port Klang has since grown and now establishes trade connections with over 120 countries and dealings with more than 500 ports around the world.

The port is part of the Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region of Trieste with its connections to Central and Eastern Europe.

, Port Klang was the top location for aluminium stockholding for LME, the top metal exchange in the world. LME reported that the port had &quot;taken centre stage in the LME aluminium storage wars over the last couple of years&quot;: 911,000 tonnes or registered stock and 434,000 tonnes of shadow stocks were held there at the end of May 2020.

==Local governance==
===Port Klang Authority===
The Port Klang Authority administers three ports in the Port Klang area namely Northport, Southpoint and Westport. Prior to the establishment of the Port Klang Authority, South Port was the only existing port and was administered by the Malayan Railway Administration. Both Westport and Northport have been privatized and managed as separate entities.

The total capacity of the port is 109,700,000 tons of cargo in 2005 compared to 550,000 tons in 1940.

===Port operators===
====Northport====
Northport is owned and operated by Northport (Malaysia) Bhd and comprises dedicated multipurpose port facilities and services. The Northport entity was a merger of two companies Kelang Container Terminal (KCT) and Kelang Port Management (KPM). Its operations also cover South Port, which was renamed Southpoint for conventional cargo handling, and acquired Northport Distripark Sdn Bhd (NDSB) as part of its logistics division.

====Westport====
Westport is managed by Westports Malaysia Sdn Bhd (formerly known as Kelang Multi Terminal Sdn Bhd). A passenger port, Port Klang Cruise Centre, opened in December 1995 at Pulau Indah which is located next to the cargo terminals of Westport. Cruise line and naval ships drop anchor in any of the three berths at Port Klang Cruise Centre, which was under the management of Star Cruises before being taken over by the Glenn Marine Group.

==Accessibility==
===Car===
Port Klang is the western end of the Federal Highway Federal Route 2 that links it all the way to Kuala Lumpur. The KESAS interchanges with the Pulau Indah Expressway Federal Route 181 in nearby Pandamaran connects to Westports and the PKFZ.

Main roads that link the Port Klang town, Southport and housing area are Persiaran Raja Muda Musa and Jalan Pelabuhan Utara.

Since 2012, Pulau Indah is directly connected to Malaysia&#x27;s administrative capital, Putrajaya and Kajang via the SKVE .

===Public transportation===
There is a frequent bus and commuter train service to Kuala Lumpur via Klang.

Port Klang is served by the KTM Komuter service and trains stop at the Port Klang Komuter station. The electric train service links to Klang, Kuala Lumpur, Subang Jaya, Shah Alam and all the way until Tanjung Malim.

A passenger ferry terminal to Pulau Ketam and an International terminal to Tanjungbalai and Dumai in Indonesia are also located in the area. The old ferry terminal used to serve regular passenger boats to Pulau Lumut and Telok Gonjeng terminal until the completion of Northport Bridge link.

==Politics==
Port Klang is under the jurisdiction of the Klang Municipal Council (MPK). It is represented in the Parliament by the Member of Parliament for , Ganabatirau Veraman. In the State Assembly of Selangor, the township is represented by Azmizam Zaman Huri, the state assemblyman for Pelabuhan Klang.

<doc id="601385" wikidata="Q3315114" url="?curid=601385" title="Minister of National Defence (Canada)">
<text>The minister of National Defence (MND; ) is a minister of the Crown in the Cabinet of Canada responsible for the management and direction of all matters relating to the national defence of Canada. 

The Department of National Defence is headed by the deputy minister of National Defence (the department&#x27;s senior civil servant), while the Canadian Armed Forces are headed by the chief of the Defence Staff (the senior serving military officer). Both are responsible to the minister of National Defence. The King (represented by the governor general of Canada) is Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces and has final authority on all orders and laws for the &quot;defence of the realm&quot;. 

The minister is responsible, through the tenets of responsible government, to Parliament for &quot;the management and direction of the Canadian Forces&quot;. Any orders and instructions for the Canadian Armed Forces are issued by or through the chief of the defence staff. The Department of National Defence exists to aid the minister in carrying out her responsibilities, and acts as the civilian support system for the Canadian Forces.

The current minister of National Defence is Bill Blair. The parliamentary secretary, who represents the minister when he is away from the House of Commons, is Bryan May.

== History ==
On January 1, 1923, the &quot;National Defence Act, 1922&quot; came into effect, merging the Department of Militia and Defence, the Department of the Naval Service, and the Air Board to form the Department of National Defence. The ministerial heads of the former departments, the minister of militia and defence, the minister of the naval service, and the minister of aviation were merged to form a new position, the minister of National Defence. 

During the Second World War, the minister of National Defence was assisted by two subordinate ministers. The minister of national defence for air was an additional minister in the Department of National Defence responsible for the Royal Canadian Air Force; while the minister of National Defence for Naval Services was another minister in the Department of National Defence responsible for the Royal Canadian Navy. The air and naval post was reincorporated into the portfolio of the minister of National Defence following the Second World War.

The Munsinger affair was Canada&#x27;s first national political sex scandal in 1966. The affair involved Gerda Munsinger, a German citizen who had been convicted in Germany as a common prostitute, a petty thief and a smuggler, who emigrated to Canada in 1956 in spite of a warning card dated 1952, and who was in 1960 the mistress of the former Associate Minister of National Defence Pierre Sévigny. Munsinger was &quot;a self-admitted espionage agent&quot; in the employ of the &quot;Russian Intelligence Service&quot;.

== The Defence Portfolio ==
The Defence Portfolio is a collection of organizations and agencies that report to the minister of National Defence. Although deputy heads for individual agencies direct and oversee the activities of their agency, the minister is accountable to Parliament its activities. The Defence Portfolio includes:

* Canadian Armed Forces
* Communications Security Establishment
* Defence Research and Development Canada
* Department of National Defence
* Cadets Canada and Junior Canadian Rangers
* Military Grievances External Review Committee
* Canadian Forces Housing Agency

* Military Police Complaints Commission
* National Search and Rescue Secretariat
* Office of the Chief Military Judge
* Office of the Legal Advisor to the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces (DND/CF LA)
* Office of the National Defence and Canadian Forces Ombudsman

The minister of National Defence is also the designated lead minister for search and rescue (LMSAR) within the federal government.

== List of ministers ==

== Ministers with military experience ==
Bill Graham was enrolled under the University Naval Training Division of the Royal Canadian Naval Reserve and received commission as sub lieutenant in 1960. Graham did not serve in the Navy following his commission and thus does not have military experience.

<doc id="601386" wikidata="Q333429" url="?curid=601386" title="Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood">
<text>Samuel John Gurney Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood (24 February 1880 – 7 May 1959), more commonly known as Sir Samuel Hoare, was a senior British Conservative politician who served in various Cabinet posts in the Conservative and National governments of the 1920s and 1930s.

Hoare was Secretary of State for Air during most of the 1920s. As Secretary of State for India in the early 1930s, he authored the Government of India Act 1935, which granted self-government at a provincial level to India. He was most famous for serving as Foreign Secretary in 1935, when he authored the Hoare–Laval Pact with French Prime Minister Pierre Laval. This partially recognised the Italian conquest of Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia) and Hoare was forced to resign by the ensuing public outcry. In 1936 he returned to the Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty, then served as Home Secretary from 1937 to 1939 and was again briefly Secretary of State for Air in 1940. He was seen as a leading &quot;appeaser&quot; and his removal from office (along with that of Sir John Simon and the removal of Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister) was a condition of Labour&#x27;s agreement to serve in a coalition government in May 1940.

Hoare also served as British ambassador to Spain from 1940 to 1944.

==Youth==
Hoare was born in London on 24 February 1880, the eldest son of Sir Samuel Hoare, 1st Baronet, who was a Conservative MP from a by-election in 1886 until 1906, and to whose baronetcy he succeeded in 1915. His family were the Anglo-Irish branch of an old Quaker family, with a long history of involvement in banking. He was a descendant of Samuel Hoare, but the family had abandoned Quakerism in the mid eighteenth century and Hoare was brought up an Anglo-Catholic.

Hoare was educated at Harrow School, where he was a classical scholar, and New College, Oxford. As an undergraduate he was awarded a blue in racquets and was a member of the Gridiron and Bullingdon Clubs. Initially he studied classics, taking a first in Mods in 1901, before switching to Modern History, graduating with a first class B.A. in 1903. He was awarded his M.A. in 1910. He later became an Honorary Fellow of New College.

Michael Bloch comments that Hoare was &quot;indubitably homosexual&quot;, but being highly ambitious and discreet (his nickname amongst colleagues was &#x27;Slippery Sam&#x27;), may not have acted much upon it. On 17 October 1909, he married Lady Maud Lygon (1882–1962), youngest daughter of The 6th Earl Beauchamp. Their marriage was childless. It was, in the words of R. J. Q. Adams, &quot;not at first a love match&quot; but in time became &quot;a devoted partnership&quot;. His biographer has stated, &quot;it would probably be more appropriate to describe it as a &quot;mariage de convenance&quot;&quot;. Hoare inherited Sidestrand Hall in 1915. His London home was 18 Cadogan Gardens.

Hoare was short, slightly built and a dapper dresser. As a youth he took up games to bolster his physique, including figure skating. He became a tournament-level shot and tennis player. He was a poor speaker but a good writer. He was hard-working but cold.

==Early political career==
In 1905, Hoare&#x27;s father arranged for him to be secretary to the Colonial Secretary Alfred Lyttelton to gain political experience. Hoare stood unsuccessfully in the 1906 General Election for Parliament at Ipswich, but became a justice of the peace for the county of Norfolk that year.

Hoare entered local politics in March 1907, when he was elected to the London County Council as a member of the Municipal Reform Party, the local government wing of the Conservative Party, representing Brixton. He served as Chairman of the London Fire Brigade Committee. He served on the LCC until 1910.

Hoare was elected to the House of Commons at the January 1910 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Chelsea. In the early years, he was a member of the Anti-Socialist Union.

During the Conservative Party leadership contest of November 1911, Hoare wrote pledging support to both leading candidates, Austen Chamberlain and Walter Long. There is no evidence that he made such an offer to Bonar Law, who became leader after the two front-runners withdrew to avoid a potential party split. Hoare showed little interest in the two largest issues of the day: House of Lords reform and Irish Home Rule. He supported tariff reform, female suffrage and public education. He opposed Welsh disestablishment quite strongly. He encouraged colleagues to call him &quot;Sam&quot; at the time to soften his hard and detached image.

Hoare was on the left-wing of the Conservative party and once described himself as &quot;a liberal amongst conservatives and a conservative amongst liberals&quot;. He joined the Unionist Social Reform Committee. Hoare held markedly &quot;progressive&quot; views, outside the mainstream of the Conservative Party, on issues such as education and penal reform. He was almost alone amongst the Conservatives in advocating the abolition of the death penalty.

==First World War==
Aged 34 at the time, Hoare joined the Army soon after the outbreak of the First World War. He was commissioned into the Norfolk Yeomanry as a temporary lieutenant on 17 October 1914. To his disappointment, he was initially only a recruiting officer and illness prevented him from serving at the front. He was promoted to temporary captain on 24 April 1915.

While acting as a recruiting officer, he learnt Russian. In 1916, he was recruited by Mansfield Cumming to be the future MI6&#x27;s liaison officer with the Russian Intelligence service in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg). He soon became head of the British Intelligence Mission to the Russian General Staff with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. In that post, he reported to the British government the death of Rasputin and apologised, because of the sensational nature of the event, for having written it in the style of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

In March 1917 he was posted to Rome, where he remained until the end of the war. His duties included helping to dissuade Italy from dropping out of the war. In Italy, he administered the subsidisation of the former socialist leader Benito Mussolini&#x27;s interventionist newspaper, , with a wage of £100 per week (equivalent to £ in ).

For his services in the war, Hoare was twice mentioned in despatches, appointed Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1917, and awarded the Orders of St Anne and St Stanislas of Russia, and of St Maurice and St Lazarus of Italy.

==Interwar period==
===Secretary of State for Air===
Hoare was re-elected to Parliament in 1918 as a Conservative; his party were then in Coalition with the Lloyd George Liberals. During the Russian Civil War, he strongly supported the call by the War Secretary Winston Churchill (by all accounts the most anti-Communist member of Lloyd George&#x27;s cabinet) for British intervention in the Russian Civil War on the side of Whites. On 31 May 1919, he wrote to Churchill to say: &quot;For the last six months, I have been convinced that the whole future of Europe and indeed of the whole world depends upon the Russian settlement and the destruction of Bolshevism&quot;. In late 1921-early 1922, Hoare served as the deputy League of Nations commissioner for Russian refugees in Asia Minor, and was charged with finding a country willing to accept them. By October 1922, he had become disillusioned with David Lloyd George after the honours scandal and the Chanak Crisis. He helped organise the backbench revolt at the Carlton Club meeting (19 October 1922), which brought down the Lloyd George Coalition. In Bonar Law&#x27;s new Conservative government he was made a Privy Councillor and Secretary of State for Air, but he was not made a member of the Cabinet until Stanley Baldwin succeeded Law as Prime Minister in May 1923.

In 1923, Hoare presided over the merger (with £1 million state subsidy) of the four principal private air carriers to form Imperial Airways, an ancestor of today&#x27;s British Airways. The Conservatives fell from power in January 1924, but Hoare was once again Secretary of State for Air in Baldwin&#x27;s Second Government (1924-1929). As Secretary of State for Air he sided with Trenchard on the importance of the Royal Air Force remaining an independent service. Hoare often quarrelled with the First Sea Lord, Admiral David Beatty, over where to allocate defence expenditure, leading Beatty to label Hoare &quot;an intriguing little brute&quot; who was intent upon starving the Royal Navy of funds in order to build up the Royal Air Force. He established air squadrons at Oxford University and Cambridge University to train students as potential RAF officers and re-established a permanent air cadet college at Cranwell.

Lady Maud was awarded the DBE in February 1927, and Hoare was awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the British Empire (GBE) in June 1927. Hoare and Lady Maud travelled by air whenever possible, including the first civilian flight to India in 1927. In 1927 he published a book, &quot;India by Air&quot;. By 1929 there were regular scheduled routes to India and Cape Town.

Hoare continued his interest in aviation affairs as Honorary Air Commodore of No 601 (County of London) (1930–32) and No 604 (County of Middlesex) (1932–57) Bomber Squadrons of the Auxiliary Air Force.

===In opposition===
Hoare was treasurer of the Conservative Party in opposition in 1929–1931.

In 1930, he published &quot;The Fourth Seal&quot; on World War I Russia.

Hoare was a delegate to the First Round Table Conference on India&#x27;s constitutional future in 1930–1931. He also helped to mediate between Baldwin and the press barons Lords Rothermere and Beaverbrook, who were intriguing for his removal as Conservative leader.

===Secretary of State for India===
Hoare was one of the Conservative negotiators in talks with Ramsay MacDonald in August 1931 over the formation of the National Government. On 26 August 1931 Hoare was appointed Secretary of State for India.

At the Second Round Table Conference, Hoare enjoyed good relations with Mahatma Gandhi. As India Secretary, Hoare was mostly concerned with the Indian Communist Party, which led him to favour the Congress Party as the best alternative. He committed Britain to eventual self-government for India, but that was not enough for Gandhi, who wanted full independence. Lord Lothian&#x27;s report on the extension of the Indian franchise was considered. A major issue that derailed the Round Table talks was the demand that the Indian Muslims along with the &quot;Dalits&quot; (untouchable caste) be awarded separate electorates, a demand that Gandhi rejected. When Gandhi told Hoare in September 1932 that he would &quot;fast unto death&quot; rather than accept a separate electorate for the untouchable caste, Hoare replied: &quot;The dogs bark, the caravan moves on&quot;. A White Paper containing the government&#x27;s legislative proposals for India&#x27;s constitution was drawn up in March 1933. A Select Committee of Both Houses began to meet for over a year and half in April 1933 to consider the government&#x27;s plans. In January 1934, Hoare was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Star of India (GCSI) in the New Year Honours. At his meeting with Ivan Maisky, the new Soviet ambassador, in 1932, Hoare told him: &quot;It would be extremely difficult to persuade the Conservatives in this country [to adopt] a pro-Russian policy if the Soviet government failed to eliminate the source of the trouble which has often poisoned relations in the past&quot;, by which he meant the Comintern support for the British Communist Party.

Hoare&#x27;s Indian policy faced much opposition from the &quot;die hard&quot; right-wing of the Conservative Party, with whom Winston Churchill allied himself. Ill feeling between Hoare and Churchill reached its peak in April 1934. The British government proposed for the Indian government to retain the power to impose tariffs on British textiles. The Manchester Chamber of Commerce, representing the Lancashire cotton trade, initially opposed that since it wanted Lancashire goods to be exported freely to India. Churchill accused Hoare of having, with the aid of the Earl of Derby, breached parliamentary privilege by improperly influencing the Manchester Chamber of Commerce to drop its opposition. Churchill was refused the right to question some witnesses, some documents which he requested were not produced and some of his written evidence was suppressed as contrary to the public interest. It was ruled that Churchill was correct that Hoare and Derby had pressured the Manchester Chamber of Commerce to withdraw their paper objecting to the White Paper, but as the Joint Select Committee was not a judicial committee it was not a breach of privilege to pressure witnesses. Hoare complained that “I do not know which is the more offensive or mischievous, Winston or his son (Randolph Churchill, who was then a journalist).&quot; After Hoare&#x27;s exoneration by the Committee on Privileges, Churchill gave a powerful speech in the Commons Chamber that attacked the committee&#x27;s findings. On 13 June 1934, Leo Amery spoke, arguing that Churchill&#x27;s true aim was to bring down the government under the cover of the doctrine &quot;fiat justicia ruat caelum&quot; (&quot;may justice be done, though the heavens fall&quot;). Churchill, who was neither a lawyer nor a classicist, growled &quot;translate it!&quot; Amery replied that it meant &quot;If I can trip up Sam, the Government&#x27;s bust&quot;. The ensuing laughter made Churchill look ridiculous.

The Select Committee of Both Houses finished its deliberations in November 1934. The result was one of the most complicated pieces of legislation in British parliamentary history, a bill that spent the first half of 1935 passing through Parliament before becoming the Government of India Act 1935. The Bill contained 473 clauses and 16 schedules, and the debates took up 4,000 pages of Hansard. Hoare had to answer 15,000 questions and make 600 speeches and completely dominated the committee stage of the bill, just as he had during the Round Table Conferences, by his mastery of detail and his skill at dealing tactfully with deputations. Alec Douglas-Home, later to be Prime Minister, commented in his autobiography, &quot;The most noteworthy performance of that Parliament was without question the piloting of the India Independence Bill through the House of Commons by the Secretary of State, Sir Samuel Hoare, ably assisted by Mr. R. A. Butler (later Lord Butler)&quot;. Butler, who, as Under-Secretary, had helped to steer the bill through the Commons, later wrote of Hoare that he saw life as &quot;a chapter in a great Napoleonic biography&quot; and added &quot;I was amazed by his ambition; I admired his imagination; I shared his ideals; I stood in awe of his intellectual capacity. But I was never touched by his humanity. He was the coldest fish with whom I ever had to deal&quot;.

Hoare was widely praised for his conduct as India Secretary but was close to exhaustion after the difficult passage of the Bill, which was opposed by Churchill and by many rank-and-file Conservatives. The Act became law in August 1935, when Hoare had moved on to his next position.

Although provincial governments were elected in 1937, the planned federation of Indian States was never set up; the Act was never fully implemented because of the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.

===Foreign Secretary===
In June 1935, Baldwin became prime minister for the third time. He offered Hoare a choice of the job of Viceroy of India or Foreign Secretary. Hoare, who was ambitious to become Prime Minister, chose the latter to enable him to remain active in domestic politics. The position would later make him notorious. Hoare&#x27;s exhausting time as India Secretary had given him little chance to study foreign affairs, and as Foreign Secretary he tended to follow the advice given to him by Robert Vansittart, the Permanent Undersecretary at the Foreign Office who saw Italy as a potential ally against Germany. Vansittart argued to Hoare that Italy could threaten British control of the Mediterranean Sea and hence the sea-lanes running through the Mediterranean to the Suez Canal, Egypt and the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean that linked Britain to its colonies in Asia. Although the bombast of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was not taken very seriously in Britain, Italy, which also controlled Libya, straddled Britain&#x27;s sea route across the Mediterranean. In particular, Vansittart stressed that deployment of naval forces to deter Japan (the Singapore strategy) depended upon a friendly Italy not challenging Britain in the Mediterranean. Finally, Vansittart argued that Italy was the chief supporter of Austria against German ambitions for an Anschluss (e.g. in 1934 when Italy had deployed troops to the Brenner Pass to deter Germany) and that a friendly Italy would allow France to concentrate its forces on the Rhineland. For all reasons, Vansittart argued that Ethiopia would have to be sacrificed to win the friendship of Italy. The historian John Charmley argued it was no accident that Hoare along with other &quot;appeasers&quot; such as Lord Halifax and Sir John Simon had devoted significant parts of their careers to India, which he stated influenced their conduct of foreign affairs, writing: &quot;In both case, nationalists were to be negotiated with until their lowest demands could be discovered and provided they were low enough granted. Nehru, Gandhi, and Hitler, however much the contemporary mind rejects the equation, had much in common to British ministers between the wars&quot;.

Hoare took office against a backdrop of what R.J.Q. Adams described as &quot;much idle talk&quot; of &quot;mutual security&quot;. In March 1935, MacDonald&#x27;s White Paper had committed Britain to limited rearmament. Hoare expressed much distrust of the Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov, who under the guise of collective security via the League of Nations, had been attempting to build up a bloc against aggression. Hoare believed that Litvinov was engaged in an &quot;intrigue&quot; intended to wreck the possibility of Anglo-German understanding and an arms control pact as he felt that the real aim behind Litvinov&#x27;s foreign policy was to manipulate the Western nations into going to war with each other to allow the Soviet Union to dominate Europe.

In April 1935, the then Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon had signed the Stresa Front on 14 April 1935, an alliance with France and Italy (which had joined the Allies in World War One). However, the Stresa Front did not last. It came to nothing after Britain, without consulting the other members, signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. That dismayed France, which soon signed a Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance. On 19 June 1935, Hoare suggested to the cabinet in a prototype of the Hoare-Laval pact that the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie be offered the port city of Zeila in the colony of British Somaliland (modern northern Somalia) in exchange for him ceding most of his empire to Italy. At this state, Hoare told the cabinet that he wanted a resolution to the crisis that &quot;would not destroy Abyssinian independence but gave Italy some satisfaction&quot;. Besides the gathering Abyssinia crisis, Hoare was concerned with pushing through over the opposition of some of his civil servants a loan to China, arguing that building up China&#x27;s strength was crucial to restraining Japan, which had been aggressive in trying to claim all of Asia as being in the Japanese sphere of influence. Hoare was also well aware that the Soviet Union tended despite the Chinese civil war to support the Kuomintang government in Nanking against the Japanese claims that China belonged in the Japanese sphere of influence, and he had been arguing since 1932 that Britain needed to do more to support China in order to prevent China from falling into an alliance with Moscow.

By mid-1935, Mussolini was clearly preparing to attack Abyssinia. For purely self-interested reasons, Baldwin-a prime minister not noted for his interest in foreign affairs-decided to make support for the League of Nations and its policy of collective security the centerpiece of the coming general election. The Labour Party had a platform that somewhat contradictorily called for both disarmament and support for collective security, and Baldwin intended to win the general election by quite ruthlessly exposing that contradiction. Hence as the Abyssinia crisis gathered steam, both Baldwin and Hoare gave speeches stressing that Britain was committed to a policy of collective security via the League of Nations up to and including war. On 12 September 1935 Hoare gave what Adams calls &quot;the greatest speech of his career&quot; to the League of Nations General Assembly at Geneva. He declared: &quot;The League stands and my country stands with it, for the collective maintenance of the Covenant in its entirety and particularly for steady and collective resistance to all acts of unprovoked aggression&quot;. His speech was very well received and promoted much cheering from those who heard it. Hoare did not believe in the contents of his speech, saying afterwards in private that the Baldwin government would take a different position on the Abyssinia crisis after the general election was won. In a dispatch to Sir George Clerk, the ambassador in Paris, Hoare stated: &quot;It is essential that we should play out the League hand in September. If it is then found that there is no collective basis for sanctions, that is to say in particular that the French are not prepared to give their full co-operation...the world will have to face the fact that sanctions are impracticable...it must be the League not the British government that declares that sanctions are impracticable and the British government must on no account lay itself open to the charge we have not done our utmost to make them practical&quot;. His speech was widely praised in the world press but did not deter the full-scale Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October. The League Council (the executive body of the League that played a role analogous to the Security Council in the United Nations) ruled that Italy had committed aggression against a fellow member of the League and that sanctions were to be imposed on Italy. Limited sanctions were imposed on Italy but excluded oil. A general election on 14 November 1935 had over 90% of the candidates support the League of Nations, and there was much support for sanctions against Italy although they were not necessarily in Britain&#x27;s interests.

With the election out of the way, the government, with the agreement of the League Council, authorised Hoare to find a solution. The French premier Pierre Laval was not keen on sanctions on Italy while Hoare used the threat of Britain&#x27;s veto power as a permanent member of the League Council to prevent oil from being added to the sanctions list. Laval&#x27;s instincts were to stick with the alliance he had struck with Mussolini earlier that year, but General Maurice Gamelin advised him that an alliance with Italy would be &quot;valuable&quot; to France, but the help of Britain would be &quot;essential&quot;, as France very badly needed the &quot;continental commitment&quot; (i.e. Britain to send a large expeditionary force to France) to win another war against Germany. As such, Gamelin argued that the Abyssinia crisis should be settled in a manner that did not estrange Britain. Under pressure from Gamelin, Laval attempted to &quot;square the circle&quot; by working out a deal that would allow France to be on good terms with both Britain and Italy. Hoare sent Sir Maurice Peterson, the head of the Foreign Office Abyssinia Department, to Paris to negotiate a compromise offer to Mussolini. An agreement was reached by the end of November: Italy was to gain territory in the north, with the rump of Abyssinia to be an Italian client state and its army under Italian control. Abyssinia had not been consulted. By December 1935, Hoare was still in poor health and suffering from fainting spells since the stressful period of passing the Government of India Act. Suffering from a serious infection, he stopped off in Paris on his way to a skating holiday in Switzerland. On the guise of stopping off for rest, Hoare secretly met with Laval to finish off the talks. His orders from the cabinet written in the third person were that it was hoped that &quot;the Foreign Secretary would take a generous view of the Italian attitude&quot;. Hoare recalled that he was enchanted with Laval&#x27;s &quot;cunning peasant mind&quot;, saying that Laval very much lived up to his &quot;horse trader&quot; image, of a &quot;fixer&quot; who knew how to get what he wanted and to drive a hard bargain. Hoare was gratified that Laval was not committed to an all-out anti-German foreign policy, and he wanted an alliance with Italy to improve France&#x27;s bargaining power in his talks with Adolf Hitler for a Franco-German settlement. The only issue Hoare had with Laval was that he reminded him very much of Lloyd George &quot;with his incessant desire to deal behind everyone&#x27;s back&quot;. The ensuing Hoare–Laval Pact with French Prime Minister Pierre Laval was unanimously approved by the Cabinet on 9–10 December.

It was leaked to the French and then to the British press, causing a public outcry, not least because of memories of Hoare&#x27;s recent Geneva speech. Hoare, who had been injured in a skating accident, returned to Britain on 16 December. In the House of Commons, Hugh Dalton, the Labour shadow foreign secretary, called the Hoare-Laval Pact an attempt to &quot;reward the declared aggressor at the expense of the victim, destroy collective security and conflict with the expressed will of the country and the Covenant&quot;. Faced with massive criticism both outside Parliament and from within as a group of Conservative backbenchers led by Austen Chamberlain denounced the Hoare-Laval Pact, Baldwin decided to sacrifice Hoare. The Cabinet met on the morning of 18 December. Lord Halifax, who was due to make a statement in the Lords that afternoon, insisted that Hoare resign to save the government&#x27;s position, causing J. H. Thomas, William Ormsby-Gore and Walter Elliott to come out for Hoare&#x27;s resignation as well. Privately, however, Halifax was puzzled by the moral outrage as the Hoare-Laval Pact was little different from proposals that had been put forward by the League Committee of Five.

Hoare resigned on 18 December. His successor was Anthony Eden. When Eden had his first audience with King George V, the King is said to have remarked humorously, &quot;No more coals to Newcastle, no more Hoares to Paris.&quot; The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain, wrote to Lady Hoare to assure her that her husband would soon back into the cabinet and &quot;in a short time his reputation will begin to rise again&quot;.

In his memoirs, Hoare admitted that his negotiations in Paris with Laval had caught him at a disadvantage. He noted that in the absence of the Hoare–Laval Pact, the Italians seized all of Abyssinia and drew closer to Germany, which eventually led to the destabilisation of Austria and the indefensibility of Czechoslovakia. The British historian David Dutton wrote that Hoare&#x27;s reputation has never recovered from the Hoare-Laval Pact, which left him to this day with the image of an abject appeaser whose actions belied his noble words in support of collective security. Dutton argued some of the abuse directed against Hoare was unfair as Winston Churchill also supported sacrificing Ethiopia to win an alliance with Italy, and Churchill only criticised Hoare for the pact with Laval because of their prior disputes over the Government of India Act. Dutton noted that the Hoare-Laval Pact is something of a misnomer as the official who pushed it most strongly on the British side was Vansittart, a man generally considered to be an anti-appeaser whose main objective with the pact was to secure Italy as an ally against Germany. Likewise, Dutton noted that Eden as Foreign Secretary was willing to accept the German remilitarisation of the Rhineland in March 1936, which was of far greater importance than the Abyssinia crisis, but because Eden resigned as Foreign Secretary in 1938 and later served as Churchill&#x27;s Foreign Secretary, he has a largely undeserved reputation as an anti-appeaser. Dutton wrote that much of the anger and abuse directed at Hoare was because of the contrast between a Foreign Secretary who promised to stop aggression in his speech in September 1935 versus the plan he devised with Laval in December 1935.

===First Lord of the Admiralty===
It was widely recognised that Hoare had been a scapegoat for Cabinet policy. His return to Baldwin&#x27;s Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty in June 1936 was widely praised in the press. It was too quick for Halifax. Eden later wrote in his memoirs that Halifax &quot;criticised Baldwin sharply for yielding to Hoare’s importunity&quot;. Hoare vigorously endorsed Britain&#x27;s naval rearmament, including ordering the first three &quot;King George V&quot;-class battleships, and worked to reverse the subordination of the British naval aviation to the Royal Air Force. As First Lord of the Admiralty, Hoare frequently fought with Eden over the policy to pursue towards the Spanish Civil War. Hoare still subscribed to the viewpoint that Italy was worth having as an ally and favoured paying lip service to the principle of non-intervention in Spain. Eden by contrast was more concerned about the prospect of Germany and/or Italy having bases in Spain, and he favoured a more vigorous approach to enforcing non-intervention. As Italy was the nation that intervened in Spain on the largest scale, Eden suggested several times imposing a blockade to prevent the Italians from landing more troops in Spain, a proposal that Hoare stoutly resisted. Mussolini sent 80, 000 troops to Spain, by far the largest contingent of any power that intervened in Spain; Germany by contrast only sent 19, 000 troops to Spain. As First Lord of the Admiralty, Hoare was greatly influenced by the First Sea Lord, Admiral Ernle Chatfield, whose sympathies were with the Spanish Nationalists.

Hoare tended to share Chatfield&#x27;s dislike of the Spanish Republic, writing: &quot;For the present it seems clear that we should continue our existing policy of neutrality-When I speak of &#x27;neutrality&#x27; I mean strict neutrality, that is to say a situation in which the Russians neither officially nor unofficially give help to the Communists. On no account must we do anything to bolster up Communism in Spain, particularly when it is remembered that Communism in Portugal, to which it would probably spread and particularly to Lisbon, would be a great danger to the British Empire&quot;. In contrast to Léon Blum in France, British leaders such as Hoare felt that the power to impose a naval blockade on Spain (a nation whose population exceeded its agricultural capacity, making Spain very dependent on food imported from abroad) would deter Franco from going too far with his alliance with Axis powers. Furthermore, the civil war devastated Spain and as Britain had the world&#x27;s third largest economy at the time, it was felt that the appeal of the pound sterling would counter any pro-Axis tendencies in Nationalist Spain as it was believed Franco would not want to be too dependent economically on Germany and Italy for post-war reconstruction. Blum and other French leaders tended to feel that the prospect of a pro-Axis Spain as a neighbour would be a threat to France and were especially worried about the prospect of German and/or Italian bases in Spain as over one-third of the French Army was recruited in France&#x27;s North African colonies, making control of the western Mediterranean Sea a crucial concern for France.

Much like Chatfield, Hoare saw the defense of Britain&#x27;s Asian colonies as second only to the defense of the United Kingdom itself and he was a strong supporter of the Singapore Strategy. He believed that the loss of a colony such as Hong Kong would have such a disastrous effect on British prestige that it would lead to the rapid dissolution of the British empire. At the Imperial Conference in London in May–June 1937 held to honour the coronation of King George VI that was attended by all the Dominion prime ministers, Hoare starkly warned the Australian and New Zealand delegations if the Singapore strategy failed, it was guaranteed that both Australia and New Zealand would be conquered by Japan and turned into Japanese colonies. Hoare engaged in a thought experiment, asking what happen if Japan went to war and there was no British fleet in Singapore, leading him to answer his question that the result would be a Japanese invasion of Australia backed by the &quot;full strength of her naval and her naval air forces&quot;, Hoare went on to say: &quot;I am convinced that, if this act of aggression took place, no Army and no Air Force which the Commonwealth of Australia could conceivably maintain could save her from invasion and defeat at the hands of the Japanese. The Dominion of New Zealand would be exposed to exactly the same danger and every word I have said about Australia is applicable to New Zealand&quot;. Hoare also told the South African and Canadian delegations that if Australia and New Zealand were conquered, they would be next as Hoare stated if Australia was turned into a Japanese colony, the Japanese would dominate the Indian Ocean and would then invade South Africa. Likewise, Hoare stated if the Japan dominated the Pacific Ocean, it would invade Canada. He concluded that the Singapore strategy was the key to maintaining the Commonwealth and that without it, all of the Dominions would be added to the Japanese empire.

===Home Secretary===
On Baldwin&#x27;s retirement, the new Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, offered Hoare any office that he liked except the Exchequer, which Hoare would have liked but had been promised to Sir John Simon. Hoare chose the Home Office (28 May 1937). Hoare was still seen as a possible successor to Chamberlain. The French ambassador Charles Corbin stated in his reports to Paris that British politics in the late 1930s were dominated by a &quot;big four&quot; that consisted of Neville Chamberlain, Lord Halifax, Sir John Simon and Hoare, whom he described as being the most powerful men in the cabinet and all of whom he clearly disliked. Hoare was widely viewed as being too ambitious to be prime minister one day and as a sycophant to Chamberlain. The future prime minister Harold Macmillan, then a rebellious backbencher, called Hoare &quot;one of the worst and most sycophantic of Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s advisers&quot;. Despite his position as Home Secretary, Chamberlain used Hoare as a minister for &quot;general policy&quot; as he served as of Chamberlain&#x27;s most closest and trusted advisers. Much of Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;personal diplomacy&quot; towards Adolf Hitler was due to advice from Hoare that the Foreign Office was too &quot;anti-German&quot; to properly execute the prime minister&#x27;s policies, and that Chamberlain should by-pass the Foreign Office as much as possible. Hoare later stated about Chamberlain&#x27;s leadership: &quot;If nines times out of ten he had his way, it was because it also the Cabinet&#x27;s way&quot;. The &quot;big four&quot; of the Chamberlain cabinet were a part of a wider &quot;inner group&quot; in the Chamberlain government that also included Sir Horace Wilson, the Chief Industrial Adviser to the government and one of Chamberlain&#x27;s closest friends; Rab Butler, the Parliamentary Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs; Sir Joseph Ball who ran the prime minister&#x27;s press office; and Sir Warren Fisher, the Permanent Undersecretary of the Treasury.

Hoare had a long family interest in judicial and penal reform. The Quaker prison reformer Elizabeth Fry was his great-great aunt. RJQ Adams wrote highly of his time as Home Secretary. Roy Jenkins wrote that Hoare was the most liberal Home Secretary between H. H. Asquith (1892–1895) and Rab Butler (1957–1962).

In 1938, Hoare was instrumental in obtaining approval for the British rescue effort on behalf of endangered Jewish children in Europe, which was known as the Kindertransport.

In September 1938, Hoare was part of the informal inner Cabinet, along with Simon and Halifax, and was one of the few consulted by Chamberlain about &quot;Plan Z&quot; to fly to meet Hitler for a summit meeting about Czechoslovakia, a decision that was then popular. Plan Z was a bold bid to solve the Sudetenland crisis under which Chamberlain was to fly to Germany for a summit intended to resolve the crisis once and for all, through Hoare did warn Chamberlain that &quot;Plan Z&quot; carried &quot;great political risk&quot;. Hoare along with Simon, Halifax, Wilson and Cadogan were the only ones aware of &quot;Plan Z&quot; and the rest of the cabinet was not informed in advance nor were the French and Czechoslovak governments. Hoare&#x27;s later account of the Munich Agreement was anguished. Hoare had close links to the Czechoslovak government. In retirement, he stood strongly by Chamberlain&#x27;s essential judgements but regretted Chamberlain&#x27;s lack of sensitivity in foreign affairs and his tendency for personal intervention that led to his failure to retain Eden and to override his Foreign Office advisers. However, Hoare repeatedly pointed out that public opinion was vociferously pacifist and that Chamberlain&#x27;s actions were widely endorsed at the time, not least by US President Franklin Roosevelt. Also, the Labour opposition strongly opposed rearmament and the introduction of conscription, even after Munich.

In late October 1938, Hoare made an extended trip to the English countryside with Herbert von Dirksen, the German ambassador, for informal talks about an Anglo-German settlement. Hoare told Dirksen that he wanted an end to the arms race between Germany and Britain; another treaty to &quot;humanise&quot; aerial war that would ban the bombing of cities and the use of chemical weapons; a deal under which Britain would return the former German colonies in Africa in exchanges for promises of no war in Europe; and a British &quot;guarantee&quot; to protect Germany from the Soviet Union. The British historian D.C. Watt wrote: &quot;This last is often cited by Soviet historians as proof of their thesis that the Cabinet was obsessed with the urge to provoke a German-Soviet war. Taken in its proper context, Hoare&#x27;s ill-chosen remarks make it clear that the offer of a guarantee was intended to disarm any German arguments that Soviet strength in the air necessitated the maintenance of a large German Luftwaffe&quot;. The fact that Hoare&#x27;s offer to Dirksen made no impression in Germany was to disillusion him, and led to Hoare taking a stronger line against Germany in 1939. In January 1939, Hoare urged an increase in defence spending and during the &quot;Dutch War Scare&quot; (a rumoured German attack on the Netherlands, possibly concocted by anti-Nazi elements in German intelligence) that same month advocated closer ties to France.

In spring 1939, Hoare aligned himself very firmly with Chamberlain&#x27;s upbeat belief that war was now unlikely, rather than with Halifax&#x27;s increasing focus on shoring up alliances and rearming for a conflict that to seemed imminent to Halifax.


In a speech given on 10 March 1939 to his local Conservative constituency association in his seat in Chelsea, Hoare predicated a coming &quot;golden age&quot; as he foresaw a bright future full of peace and prosperity for all about to dawn. In the speech Hoare denounced those who called for greater rearmament as “jitterbugs”, commenting that “these timid panic-mongers are doing the greatest harm”. Just days after the &quot;golden age&quot; speech, Germany violated the Munich Agreement on 15 March 1939 by occupying the Czech half of Czecho-Slovakia, which became the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia. Hoare&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot; speech gave him the reputation as a someone with a blindly, almost Panglossian naïve faith in an optimistic future, and Dutton noted that next to Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;peace in our time&quot; speech of 1938, the &quot;golden age&quot; speech is one of the most mocked speeches in British history. Hoare had not actually wanted to deliver the &quot;golden age&quot; speech, which had been imposed on him by Chamberlain who complained that several of his ministers seemed reluctant to talk about foreign affairs.

In 1939, Hoare almost carried the most comprehensive Criminal Justice Reform Bill in British history: he had intended to abolish corporal punishment in prisons and had been keen to work towards the abolition of the death penalty of whose risks he was very aware. The Bill was cancelled because of the outbreak of war. Most of its provisions were successfully reintroduced by James Chuter Ede as Home Secretary in 1948, with support from Hoare, who by then was in the House of Lords.

During the Danzig crisis, Hoare spoke several times in the cabinet about the advantages of having the Soviet Union join a &quot;peace front&quot; meant to deter Germany from invading Poland. In cabinet debates Hoare along with Halifax, Chatfield (now serving as minister for the co-ordination of defence) and the War Secretary Leslie Hore-Belisha favoured broadening the &quot;peace front&quot; to include the Soviet Union as all expressed serious doubts about the ability of Poland to stand alone against Germany in opposition to Chamberlain and Simon. His change in stance from being opposed to any sort of co-operation with the Soviet Union to being an advocate of an alliance with the Soviet Union surprised many. Hoare&#x27;s change in views was dictated by strategical considerations as the Chiefs of Staff stated that the Soviet Union was the only nation that could sent forces directly to Romania and Poland (the two nations in Eastern Europe that most concerned British decision-makers in the Danzig crisis) and supply them with arms. In addition, the Chiefs of Staff stated that the submarines of the Soviet Baltic fleet could cut the shipping lanes that linked Sweden to Germany and in this way supplied the &quot;Reich&quot; with the high-grade iron used to make steel in the blast furnaces of the Ruhr. The Chiefs of Staff argued that having the Soviet Union as an ally would deny Germany the use of its immense natural resources as the Soviet Union was self-sufficient in virtually all of the raw materials needed to sustain a modern industrial economy. Finally, the Chiefs of Staff predicated that the Soviet Union as an ally might deter Japan from aggression. The Chiefs of Staff predicated if war broke out in Europe, it was almost certain that Japan would try to take advantage of the conflict to seize Britain&#x27;s Asian colonies and the Japanese would almost certainly invade Australia if they took Singapore. The Chiefs of Staff stated that Hong Kong was too exposed and was certain to be taken by the Japanese in the event of war, and furthermore predicated the Singapore strategy might be rendered inoperative by the Japanese capturing Singapore first before the British fleet could arrive. For all these reasons, the Chiefs of Staff argued that the Soviet Union would be an &quot;invaluable&quot; ally in helping to achieve the aims of British deterrence diplomacy in both Europe and Asia. Hoare seems to have been impressed by this argument that the Soviet Union would be a most helpful ally in both Europe and Asia, which inspired his &quot;volte-face&quot;. In March 1939, Hoare told the cabinet that he &quot;held no predilections&quot; in the favor of the Soviet Union, but he argued that argued that the current policy of reaching out to the Soviets in a half-hearted manner was self-defeating as it was bound to excite the suspicions of Joseph Stalin. He stated on the basis of information from the British embassy in Moscow that Stalin was moody, sullen and paranoid and was bound to see British policy in the worse possible light. He argued that the main concern at present should be to prevent &quot;Stalin from throwing the weight of Russian power onto the enemy&#x27;s side&quot;. Hoare pumped energy into the Air Raid Precautions Department and the Women&#x27;s Voluntary Service Organisation.

==Second World War==
On the outbreak of war, Hoare became Lord Privy Seal in the nine-man War Cabinet (3 September 1939), with a wide-ranging brief. On 5 April 1940, Hoare briefly returned to the Air Ministry, swapping places with Sir Kingsley Wood, and later that month came under fire during the Norway Debate which brought down the Chamberlain government. Then, the resignations of himself, Chamberlain and Sir John Simon were essential preconditions for Labour to join a coalition government. Hoare was one of the foremost Chamberlain loyalists and was shocked at the apparent disloyalty of others, such as Halifax.

Following Winston Churchill&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister on 10 May 1940, Hoare was dropped from the government altogether unlike Chamberlain, Halifax and even Simon. He still hoped in vain to be Viceroy of India. Of the &quot;big four&quot; of the Chamberlain government, Hoare was the only one excluded from the government that Churchill formed on 10 May 1940 as Chamberlain became the Lord Privy Seal, Halifax continued as Foreign Secretary and Simon became the Lord Chancellor.

Alexander Cadogan saw Hoare as a potential quisling in 1940, but Leo Amery and Lord Beaverbrook thought highly of him. Another Foreign Office mandarin, Robert Vansittart, thought him prim and precise but not a resilient figure in political struggle. Hoare was named as one of the fifteen &quot;Guilty Men&quot; in the influential July 1940 book of the same name. &quot;Guilty Men&quot; inflicted another blow on Hoare&#x27;s reputation, which still lasts to this day.

After a brief period of unemployment Hoare was sent as Ambassador to Spain, with his wife, Lady Maud Hoare. In that demanding and critical role he helped to arrange the return of thousands of Allied prisoners from Spanish gaols and successfully helped to dissuade Francisco Franco from formally joining the Axis. The decision to appoint Hoare as ambassador to Spain was widely seen as an insult, likened by Dutton to being &quot;made a manager of a Siberian power station&quot; (the demeaning job given to former Soviet leader Georgy Malenkov in the late 1950s). Cadogan thought that instead of being made ambassador to Spain Hoare should have been sent to a penal settlement.

Hoare loathed Franco and found him a puzzling and obtuse interlocutor. (Hoare found Franco&#x27;s Portuguese counterpart, António de Oliveira Salazar, much more pleasant to deal with.) His fluent memoir of the period, &quot;Ambassador on Special Mission&quot;, is an excellent insight into the day-to-day life of a demanding diplomatic job, his primary challenges being to dissuade Franco from his preferred drift to the Axis powers and to prevent the Allies from reacting with undue haste to repeated Spanish provocations. Hoare&#x27;s memoir is not completely frank about his deployment of an array of bluff, leaks, bribery and subterfuge to disrupt unfriendly elements in Franco&#x27;s regime and the operations of the German embassy, but those methods were remembered fondly by his team.

In June 1941, Spain, ostensibly remaining non-belligerent, was preparing to send a division of volunteers to fight on the side of Germany against the Soviet Union, the so-called &quot;División Azul&quot; Blue Division. On 24 June, a big demonstration of students was organised by the regime in support of the expedition. The demonstration ended in front of the Falange Party&#x27;s headquarters, where Ramón Serrano Suñer was present and gave a speech. There was much anti-British sentiment in Spain, and some students went to the nearby British embassy and started throwing stones and to attack the embassy building. Hoare called Serrano Suñer on the telephone, and they had a heated exchange. Serrano Suñer asked him if he wanted him to send more police to protect the embassy to which Hoare famously responded, &quot;Don&#x27;t send more police, just send fewer students&quot;.

Hoare also helped to prevent Spanish interference with Operation Torch in November 1942.

On 14 July 1944, he was created Viscount Templewood (the name was that of Templewood, a country house at Sidestrand) of Chelsea in the County of Middlesex. With the issue of Spanish neutrality no longer in doubt, his ambassadorship ended in December 1944, and he returned to Britain.

==Later life==
In the House of Lords, Viscount Templewood served on the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee from 1950 and chaired it from 1954. He gave energetic support to penal reform, the Criminal Justice Act 1948 and the abolition of capital punishment. Templewood was the only Conservative peer who advocated the abolition of the death penalty in the 1950s. He took up many company directorships. In 1948, volume one of Churchill&#x27;s memoirs/History of World War Two, &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;, was published. In &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;, Churchill finished off the assault on Templewood&#x27;s reputation that &quot;Guilty Men&quot; had begun, by portraying the interwar period as a struggle between good vs. evil, and the &quot;appeasers&quot; were portrayed as almost as malevolent as Adolf Hitler. Churchill made the claim that Second World War was the &quot;unnecessary war&quot; that would had been avoided if only he had been prime minister in the 1930s. Churchill indicted the appeasers such as Templewood on two counts. The first count was a moral one, namely that Hitler was a deeply &quot;wicked&quot; man and the appeasers were variously cowardly and/or stupid not to have realised this. The second count was a practical one that they failed to prepare the country for the coming war by not spending money on defence and making the necessary alliances. Churchill&#x27;s immense popularity made &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot; a bestseller in 1948, and the indictment that Churchill presented is still widely accepted today.

Hoare was President of the Lawn Tennis Association (1932–56), an elder brother of Trinity House (1936–1950), Chancellor of the University of Reading (1937 until his death in 1959), Chairman of the Council of the Howard League for Penal Reform (1947–59), President of the Magistrates&#x27; Association (1947–52), President of the Air League of the British Empire (1953-1956), and President of the National Skating Association (1945–57).

Templewood published a number of books after the war, including &quot;Ambassador on Special Mission&quot; (1946) about his time in Spain, &quot;The Unbroken Thread&quot; (1949), a family memoir, &quot;The Shadow of the Gallows&quot; (1951) on capital punishment, and &quot;Nine Troubled Years&quot; (1954), a memoir of the 1930s. Dutton described &quot;Nine Troubled Years&quot; as a &quot;reasonable apologia for Chamberlain and appeasement&quot;, through he noted Templewood had to work within the highly restrictive rules imposed by Maurice Hankey about what he could and could not write about concerning cabinet debates, which gave a highly misleading picture of what actually happened. Furthermore, Dutton noted that Templewood displayed much loyalty to the memory of Chamberlain even when he was allowed to mention debates in the cabinet. For example, Templewood was completely silent in &quot;Nine Troubled Years&quot; about his disagreements with Chamberlain about his preference in 1939 for having the Soviet Union serve as the eastern pivot of the proposed &quot;peace front&quot; instead of Poland as Chamberlain wanted. Dutton noted that had he mentioned this it might had done something to dispel his image as Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;yes man&quot;. Instead, Templewood just made a reference to an assessment by the Chiefs of Staff in 1939 that calculated the Polish Army was superior to the Red Army by a factor of three to one, which gave the impression that Chamberlain was quite rational in choosing Poland instead of the Soviet Union as the eastern pivot of the &quot;peace front&quot;.

In addition to those awarded for his services in the First World War, he held the following foreign honours:

*Grand Cross of the Order of the White Lion of Czechoslovakia.
*Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star of Sweden.
*Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog of Denmark.
*Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau of the Netherlands.

He died aged 79 of a heart attack, at his home, 12a Eaton Mansions, Chelsea, London, on 7 May 1959. He was buried at Sidestrand parish churchyard in Norfolk. As his marriage was childless, and his brother had pre-deceased him, the baronetcy and peerage became extinct upon his death.

Templewood&#x27;s estate was valued for probate at £186,944 3s 6d (just over £4.5m at 2016 prices). His residence, Templewood House, in Frogshall, Northrepps, Norfolk, was inherited by his nephew, the architect Paul Edward Paget.

Hoare&#x27;s widow Viscountess Templewood died in 1962.

<text>William Ellsworth Glasscock (December 13, 1862 – April 12, 1925) was an American politician who served as the 13th governor of West Virginia as a Republican from 1909 to 1913.

Glasscock worked for several years as a teacher, becoming the superintendent of schools in 1887 before leaving education to become the clerk of the county circuit court in 1890. He was admitted to the bar in 1903 and began practicing law. He worked as an attorney for Senator Stephen B. Elkins. At Elkins&#x27; recommendation, Glasscock was appointed as the internal revenue collection for the District of West Virginia in 1905 by President Theodore Roosevelt.

In 1908, Glasscock resigned from this position to run for governor. He ran as the Republican nominee for Governor of West Virginia in 1908, beating Louis Bennett Sr. by 12,133 votes. In his last year as governor, he declared martial law three times, sending troops to quell violent Coal Wars. Glasscock then returned to practicing law.

== Biography ==
Glasscock was born on a farm near Arnettsville, Virginia, now part of Monongalia County, West Virginia on December 13, 1862. He was educated in the local public school system and graduated from West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia. In 1888, he married Mary Miller.

He died in Morgantown, West Virginia and was buried in Oak Grove Cemetery.

<text>The display resolution or display modes of a digital television, computer monitor, or other display device is the number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed. It can be an ambiguous term especially as the displayed resolution is controlled by different factors in cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays, flat-panel displays (including liquid-crystal displays) and projection displays using fixed picture-element (pixel) arrays.

It is usually quoted as &#x27;, with the units in pixels: for example,&#x27; means the width is 1024 pixels and the height is 768 pixels. This example would normally be spoken as &quot;ten twenty-four by seven sixty-eight&quot; or &quot;ten twenty-four by seven six eight&quot;.

One use of the term &quot;display resolution&quot; applies to fixed-pixel-array displays such as plasma display panels (PDP), liquid-crystal displays (LCD), Digital Light Processing (DLP) projectors, OLED displays, and similar technologies, and is simply the physical number of columns and rows of pixels creating the display (e.g. ). A consequence of having a fixed-grid display is that, for multi-format video inputs, all displays need a &quot;scaling engine&quot; (a digital video processor that includes a memory array) to match the incoming picture format to the display.

For device displays such as phones, tablets, monitors and televisions, the use of the term &quot;display resolution&quot; as defined above is a misnomer, though common. The term &quot;display resolution&quot; is usually used to mean &quot;pixel dimensions&quot;, the maximum number of pixels in each dimension (e.g. ), which does not tell anything about the pixel density of the display on which the image is actually formed: resolution properly refers to the pixel density, the number of pixels per unit distance or area, not the &quot;total&quot; number of pixels. In digital measurement, the display resolution would be given in pixels per inch (PPI). In analog measurement, if the screen is 10 inches high, then the horizontal resolution is measured across a square 10 inches wide. For television standards, this is typically stated as &quot;lines horizontal resolution, per picture height&quot;; for example, analog NTSC TVs can typically display about 340 lines of &quot;per picture height&quot; horizontal resolution from over-the-air sources, which is equivalent to about 440 total lines of actual picture information from left edge to right edge.

==Background==
Some commentators also use display resolution to indicate a range of input formats that the display&#x27;s input electronics will accept and often include formats greater than the screen&#x27;s native grid size even though they have to be down-scaled to match the screen&#x27;s parameters (e.g. accepting a  input on a display with a native pixel array). In the case of television inputs, many manufacturers will take the input and zoom it out to &quot;overscan&quot; the display by as much as 5% so input resolution is not necessarily display resolution.

The eye&#x27;s perception of &quot;display resolution&quot; can be affected by a number of factors see image resolution and optical resolution. One factor is the display screen&#x27;s rectangular shape, which is expressed as the ratio of the physical picture width to the physical picture height. This is known as the aspect ratio. A screen&#x27;s physical aspect ratio and the individual pixels&#x27; aspect ratio may not necessarily be the same. An array of  on a 16:9 display has square pixels, but an array of  on a 16:9 display has oblong pixels.

An example of pixel shape affecting &quot;resolution&quot; or perceived sharpness: displaying more information in a smaller area using a higher resolution makes the image much clearer or &quot;sharper&quot;. However, most recent screen technologies are fixed at a certain resolution; making the resolution lower on these kinds of screens will greatly decrease sharpness, as an interpolation process is used to &quot;fix&quot; the non-native resolution input into the display&#x27;s native resolution output.

While some CRT-based displays may use digital video processing that involves image scaling using memory arrays, ultimately &quot;display resolution&quot; in CRT-type displays is affected by different parameters such as spot size and focus, astigmatic effects in the display corners, the color phosphor pitch shadow mask (such as Trinitron) in color displays, and the video bandwidth.

==Aspects==


=== Overscan and underscan ===
Most television display manufacturers &quot;overscan&quot; the pictures on their displays (CRTs and PDPs, LCDs etc.), so that the effective on-screen picture may be reduced from  (480) to  (450), for example. The size of the invisible area somewhat depends on the display device. Some HD televisions do this as well, to a similar extent.

Computer displays including projectors generally do not overscan although many models (particularly CRT displays) allow it. CRT displays tend to be underscanned in stock configurations, to compensate for the increasing distortions at the corners.

=== Interlaced versus progressive scan ===
Interlaced video (also known as interlaced scan) is a technique for doubling the perceived frame rate of a video display without consuming extra bandwidth. The interlaced signal contains two fields of a video frame captured consecutively. This enhances motion perception to the viewer, and reduces flicker by taking advantage of the phi phenomenon.

The European Broadcasting Union has argued against interlaced video in production and broadcasting. The main argument is that no matter how complex the deinterlacing algorithm may be, the artifacts in the interlaced signal cannot be completely eliminated because some information is lost between frames. Despite arguments against it, television standards organizations continue to support interlacing. It is still included in digital video transmission formats such as DV, DVB, and ATSC. New video compression standards like High Efficiency Video Coding are optimized for progressive scan video, but sometimes do support interlaced video.

Progressive scanning (alternatively referred to as noninterlaced scanning) is a format of displaying, storing, or transmitting moving images in which all the lines of each frame are drawn in sequence. This is in contrast to interlaced video used in traditional analog television systems where only the odd lines, then the even lines of each frame (each image called a video field) are drawn alternately, so that only half the number of actual image frames are used to produce video.

==Televisions==
===Current standards===
Televisions are of the following resolutions:

* Standard-definition television (SDTV):
** 480i (NTSC-compatible digital standard employing two interlaced fields of 240 lines each)
** 576i (PAL-compatible digital standard employing two interlaced fields of 288 lines each)
* Enhanced-definition television (EDTV):
** 480p ( progressive scan)
** 576p ( progressive scan)
* High-definition television (HDTV):
** 720p ( progressive scan)
** 1080i ( split into two interlaced fields of 540 lines)
** 1080p ( progressive scan)
* Ultra-high-definition television (UHDTV):
** 4K UHD ( progressive scan)
** 8K UHD ( progressive scan)

== Film industry ==

As far as digital cinematography is concerned, video resolution standards depend first on the frames&#x27; aspect ratio in the film stock (which is usually scanned for digital intermediate post-production) and then on the actual points&#x27; count. Although there is not a unique set of standardized sizes, it is commonplace within the motion picture industry to refer to &quot;&quot;n&quot;K&quot; image &quot;quality&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is a (small, usually even) integer number which translates into a set of actual resolutions, depending on the film format. As a reference consider that, for a 4:3 (around 1.33:1) aspect ratio which a film frame (no matter what is its format) is expected to &quot;horizontally fit in&quot;, &quot;n&quot; is the multiplier of 1024 such that the horizontal resolution is exactly &quot;1024•n&quot; points. For example, 2K reference resolution is pixels, whereas 4K reference resolution is pixels. Nevertheless, 2K may also refer to resolutions like (full-aperture), (HDTV, 16:9 aspect ratio) or pixels (Cinemascope, 2.35:1 aspect ratio). It is also worth noting that while a frame resolution may be, for example, 3:2 ( NTSC), that is not what you will see on-screen (i.e. 4:3 or 16:9 depending on the intended aspect ratio of the original material).

== Computer monitors ==
Computer monitors have traditionally possessed higher resolutions than most televisions.

=== Evolution of standards ===


Many personal computers introduced in the late 1970s and the 1980s were designed to use television receivers as their display devices, making the resolutions dependent on the television standards in use, including PAL and NTSC. Picture sizes were usually limited to ensure the visibility of all the pixels in the major television standards and the broad range of television sets with varying amounts of over scan. The actual drawable picture area was, therefore, somewhat smaller than the whole screen, and was usually surrounded by a static-colored border (see image below). Also, the interlace scanning was usually omitted in order to provide more stability to the picture, effectively halving the vertical resolution in progress. , and on NTSC were relatively common resolutions in the era (224, 240 or 256 scanlines were also common). In the IBM PC world, these resolutions came to be used by 16-color EGA video cards.

One of the drawbacks of using a classic television is that the computer display resolution is higher than the television could decode. Chroma resolution for NTSC/PAL televisions are bandwidth-limited to a maximum 1.5MHz, or approximately 160 pixels wide, which led to blurring of the color for 320- or 640-wide signals, and made text difficult to read (see example image below). Many users upgraded to higher-quality televisions with S-Video or RGBI inputs that helped eliminate chroma blur and produce more legible displays. The earliest, lowest cost solution to the chroma problem was offered in the Atari 2600 Video Computer System and the Apple II+, both of which offered the option to disable the color and view a legacy black-and-white signal. On the Commodore 64, the GEOS mirrored the Mac OS method of using black-and-white to improve readability.

The resolution ( with borders disabled) was first introduced by home computers such as the Commodore Amiga and, later, Atari Falcon. These computers used interlace to boost the maximum vertical resolution. These modes were only suited to graphics or gaming, as the flickering interlace made reading text in word processor, database, or spreadsheet software difficult. (Modern game consoles solve this problem by pre-filtering the 480i video to a lower resolution. For example, Final Fantasy XII suffers from flicker when the filter is turned off, but stabilizes once filtering is restored. The computers of the 1980s lacked sufficient power to run similar filtering software.)

The advantage of a overscanned computer was an easy interface with interlaced TV production, leading to the development of Newtek&#x27;s Video Toaster. This device allowed Amigas to be used for CGI creation in various news departments (example: weather overlays), drama programs such as NBC&#x27;s &quot;seaQuest&quot; and The WB&#x27;s &quot;Babylon 5&quot;.

In the PC world, the IBM PS/2 VGA (multi-color) on-board graphics chips used a non-interlaced (progressive) 640 × 480 × 16 color resolution that was easier to read and thus more useful for office work. It was the standard resolution from 1990 to around 1996. The standard resolution was until around 2000. Microsoft Windows XP, released in 2001, was designed to run at minimum, although it is possible to select the original in the Advanced Settings window.

Programs designed to mimic older hardware such as Atari, Sega, or Nintendo game consoles (emulators) when attached to multiscan CRTs, routinely use much lower resolutions, such as or for greater authenticity, though other emulators have taken advantage of pixelation recognition on circle, square, triangle and other geometric features on a lesser resolution for a more scaled vector rendering. Some emulators, at higher resolutions, can even mimic the aperture grille and shadow masks of CRT monitors.

In 2002, eXtended Graphics Array was the most common display resolution. Many web sites and multimedia products were re-designed from the previous format to the layouts optimized for .

The availability of inexpensive LCD monitors made the aspect ratio resolution of more popular for desktop usage during the first decade of the 21st century. Many computer users including CAD users, graphic artists and video game players ran their computers at resolution (UXGA) or higher such as QXGA if they had the necessary equipment. Other available resolutions included oversize aspects like SXGA+ and wide aspects like WXGA, WXGA+, WSXGA+, and WUXGA; monitors built to the 720p and 1080p standard were also not unusual among home media and video game players, due to the perfect screen compatibility with movie and video game releases. A new more-than-HD resolution of WQXGA was released in 30-inch LCD monitors in 2007.

In 2010, 27-inch LCD monitors with the resolution were released by multiple manufacturers, and in 2012, Apple introduced a display on the MacBook Pro. Panels for professional environments, such as medical use and air traffic control, support resolutions up to (or, more relevant for control rooms, pixels).

=== Common display resolutions ===


In recent years the 16:9 aspect ratio has become more common in notebook displays, and (HD) has become popular for most low-cost notebooks, while (FHD) and higher resolutions are available for more premium notebooks.

When a computer display resolution is set higher than the physical screen resolution (&quot;native resolution&quot;), some video drivers make the virtual screen scrollable over the physical screen thus realizing a two dimensional virtual desktop with its viewport. Most LCD manufacturers do make note of the panel&#x27;s native resolution as working in a non-native resolution on LCDs will result in a poorer image, due to dropping of pixels to make the image fit (when using DVI) or insufficient sampling of the analog signal (when using VGA connector). Few CRT manufacturers will quote the true native resolution, because CRTs are analog in nature and can vary their display from as low as 320 × 200 (emulation of older computers or game consoles) to as high as the internal board will allow, or the image becomes too detailed for the vacuum tube to recreate (i.e., analog blur). Thus, CRTs provide a variability in resolution that fixed resolution LCDs cannot provide.

<text>Frenchs Forest (pron. frenches) is a suburb of northern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Frenchs Forest is 
13 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council. Frenchs Forest is part of Sydney&#x27;s Northern Beaches region and also considered to be part of the Forest District, colloquially known as &quot;The Forest&quot; by its locals.

During the 2010s, the suburb underwent rezoning which includes a new hospital, town centre, new relocated high school, 2,200 new homes and $500 million to upgrade the roads around the new Northern Beaches Hospital.

The rezoning was completed in time for the hospital opening in 2019.

==History==
===Aboriginal culture===
Prior to the arrival of the First Fleet in Port Jackson in 1788, the area of land we now know as Frenchs Forest, and surrounding Warringah areas, was the home of the Dharug language group of the Garigal Aboriginal clan. Evidence of their habitation remains today in the form of rock engravings, rock art, open campsites, rock shelters, scarred trees and middens. The word &quot;Warringah&quot; has many interpretations including &quot;sign of rain&quot;, &quot;across the waves&quot; and &quot;sea&quot;.

===European settlement===
European exploration into Warringah began within the first weeks of settlement at Sydney Cove in 1788. Governor Phillip made a number of journeys throughout the area, detailing the landscape, flora and fauna, as well as observing Aboriginal lifestyle and culture. Although Beacon Hill advertises the &quot;Arthur Phillip lookout&quot; at its peak, it is believed by some historians that Phillip&#x27;s travels actually took him through Bantry Bay and up into Frenchs Forest to gain views over the area.

In 1853 Simeon Henry Pearce (1821–1886) and his brother James acquired in this area. The property was later known as Rodborough when it was acquired by James French, a police constable, who took over Warringah.

Despite its relative proximity to Sydney, Frenchs Forest remained predominantly rural throughout the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century. A 1951 article in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; noted: 

== Geography ==
Frenchs Forest is close to the Garigal National Park. It is elevated (~156 m ASL) regularly having high rainfall compared with the rest of Sydney and is spread along ridgelines surrounded by native bushland. The eastern parts have distant views (3 km) over the Pacific Ocean and the temperature extremes typical of Sydney are moderated by this proximity. The western side has views over Chatswood, St Leonards, North Sydney &amp; The city, bounded by Garigal National Park featuring native wildlife, birds, turtles, wallabies, lizards, snakes. Bush tracks include bluff track and natural bridge track.

=== Climate ===
Frenchs Forest climate is similar to the Climate of Sydney, albeit with a few minor seasonal differences: winters tend to be cooler and wetter than in the city, while summers tend to be less hot.

== Commercial areas ==
Forestway Shopping Centre is at the intersection of Forest Way and Warringah Road. The centre includes an Aldi and Woolworths supermarkets and over 50 speciality stores.

Smaller shopping centres are located at Sorlie Road featuring a variety of restaurants and Skyline shops on Frenchs Forest Road East, the name being derived from the &#x27;Skyline Drive-in Movie Theatre&#x27; that existed nearby until the mid-1980s.

Frenchs Forest Town Centre is a proposed shopping mall, aquatic centre and high-rise residential development.

== Schools ==
Frenchs Forest is home to a number of schools:
* The Forest High School
* Davidson High School
* Frenchs Forest Public School
* Mimosa Public School
* Arranounbai School

== Churches ==
* Frenchs Forest Anglican Church
* Frenchs Forest Uniting Church] (also known as &quot;The Kirk&quot;)
* Forest Alliance Church
* Frenchs Forest Baptist

Although named Frenchs Forest Catholic Parish, the three church buildings that make up the parish are located in the adjoining suburbs of Davidson, Forestville &amp; Terrey Hills.

== Transport ==
=== Road ===
The main routes through Frenchs Forest include the east-west Warringah Road (State route A38), connecting Roseville in the west with Brookvale in the east; the north-south Forest Way, starting at Warringah Road in Frenchs Forest and heading north through Belrose to Terrey Hills, connecting with Mona Vale Road (8 km); and the north-south Wakehurst Parkway (State route 22), starting at Narrabeen in the northeast, crossing Frenchs Forest Road and Warringah Road in Frenchs Forest, and heading south to Seaforth, leading to the Spit Bridge. Following any of these three major roads lead to the only three road routes off the Northern Beaches peninsula.

The intersection of Wakehurst Parkway and Warringah Road was the scene of multiple high speed collisions when these two roads were dirt tracks through the bush. To improve this, a &quot;blinking light&quot; was suspended above the intersection in the first half of the 20th century to warn motorists of the danger, which earned the intersection the enduring name of &#x27;The Blinking Light&#x27;.

===Buses===
CDC NSW connects Frenchs Forest with Chatswood railway station in the west, Westfield Warringah Mall shopping centre at Brookvale in the east and Terrey Hills in the north, with bus services running to Town Hall station in the Sydney central business district. Keolis Downer Northern Beaches runs a number of bus lines through the Frenchs Forest area, including the 160X bus service which connects Chatswood to Dee Why, and other services to Manly and Narrabeen.

==Culture==
* Frenchs Forest Showground has &quot;off leash&quot; areas for dogs and horse events.

===Events===
* Forest Funday, is an annual free fair provided by the combined Christian churches of &quot;The Forest&quot; on Anzac Day, 25 April at Frenchs Forest Showground.
* Eurofest at Ararat Reserve in mid-September involves all the ethnic clubs in the area.

===Clubs===
* The Scout Hall.
* The Girls Guides Hall.
* Ararat Reserve (named after the Ararat plains of Ancient Armenia) on Bantry Bay Road features a number of ethnic clubs.

===Sport and recreation===
* The Warringah Aquatic Centre features an Olympic size indoor heated swimming pool and baseball pitches.
* Lionel Watts Oval provides sports fields for cricket, Australian rules football, soccer, rugby league, netball and has a skate park. Immediately next to the oval is a fenced, dog off-leash area, for dogs to run and play.
* A combination cycle/cycle-pedestrian shared/cycle-road path (completed ) from the corner of Wakehurst Parkway and Frenchs Forest Road, connecting Frenchs Forest with Dee Why. The signposting/painted lines on roads is aged and can be a little difficult to follow.
* The fenced playground for young kids at Lionel Watts Oval (Blackbutts Rd) has a mini-track suitable for toddlers and small kids on tricycles. Rebuilt in 2019.
* Manly Dam Reserve is adjacent to (southeast of) Frenchs Forest, containing pedestrian/mountain bike bush tracks.
* Manly-Warringah Radio Society using callsign VK2MB is the local club for Amateur Radio Operators &amp; services the Frenchs Forest area, with club rooms at Terrey Hills.

<text>In law, a resolution is a motion, often in writing, which has been adopted by a deliberative body (such as a corporations&#x27; board and or the house of a legislature). An alternate term for a resolution is a &quot;resolve&quot;.

==In corporations==

In corporations, a written resolution is especially useful in the case of the board of directors of a corporation, which usually needs to give its consent to real estate purchases or sales by the corporation. Such a resolution, when certified by the corporation&#x27;s secretary, gives assurance to the other side of the transaction that the sale was properly authorized. Other examples include resolutions approving the opening of bank accounts or authorizing the issuance of shares in the corporation.

==Legislative bodies==
In many legislative bodies, the term resolution is the way a motion which has been approved is called. 

In the United States, resolution means a proposal made in writing, while motion means a proposal made verbally.
Houses of a legislature often adopt non-binding resolutions.

However, a legislature also uses resolutions to exercise one of its binding powers that isn&#x27;t a lawmaking power. For example, the United States Congress declares war or proposes constitutional amendments by adopting a joint resolution. A house of a legislature can also use a resolution to exercise its specific powers, as the British House of Commons does to elect its Speaker or as the United States House of Representatives does to impeach an officer of the government.

==Types==
===Non-binding===

In a house of a legislature, the term non-binding resolution refers to measures that do not become laws. This is used to differentiate those measures from a bill, which is also a resolution in the technical sense. The resolution is often used to express the body&#x27;s approval or disapproval of something which they cannot otherwise vote on, due to the matter being handled by another jurisdiction, or being protected by a constitution. An example would be a resolution of support for a nation&#x27;s troops in battle, which carries no legal weight, but is adopted for moral support.

===Substantive and procedural=== 
Substantive resolutions apply to essential legal principles and rules of right, analogous to substantive law, in contrast to procedural resolutions, which deal with the methods and means by which substantive items are made and administered.

==Historical examples of resolutions==
*Gulf of Tonkin Resolution
*Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions
*United Nations General Assembly resolutions
*United Nations Security Council resolutions
*War Powers Resolution

==See also==
*Courtesy resolution
*Main motion
*Preamble

<doc id="601403" wikidata="Q1351465" url="?curid=601403" title="Fatman Scoop">
<text>Isaac Freeman III (August 6, 1968 – August 31, 2024), better known by his stage name Fatman Scoop, was an American hip-hop recording artist and radio personality. Noted for his booming, raw vocal presence on various hip-hop songs, he was best known for his guest performances on the 2005 singles &quot;Lose Control&quot; by Missy Elliott and &quot;It&#x27;s Like That&quot; by Mariah Carey, as well as his 1999 sleeper hit single, &quot;Be Faithful&quot; (featuring the Crooklyn Clan), which topped the UK Singles Chart in 2003.

==Early life==
Isaac Freeman III was born on August 6, 1968, in Manhattan, New York City, and grew up in Harlem, the son of Clara and Isaac Freeman Jr. He was educated at Cardinal Hayes High School and the New York Institute of Technology.

==Career==
Freeman adopted the stage name &quot;Fatman Scoop&quot; from the nickname given to him by his Uncle Jack as a child, because he loved ice cream. He first came to prominence with the release of the single &quot;Be Faithful&quot; (featuring the Crooklyn Clan), which topped the charts in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in October 2003, four years after its original release, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Denmark and Australia.

Throughout his career, Fatman Scoop collaborated with numerous artists, including on Ying Yang Twins&#x27; 2004 remix of &quot;Salt Shaker&quot;, Janet Jackson&#x27;s 2006 remix of &quot;So Excited&quot;, The Pussycat Dolls&#x27; 2008 remix of &quot;When I Grow Up&quot;, David Guetta&#x27;s 2009 remix of &quot;One Love&quot;, and Skrillex&#x27;s 2014 single &quot;Recess&quot;.

In 2004, Fatman Scoop was featured in the UK TV series &quot;Chancers&quot;, broadcast on Channel 4, mentoring six British musicians trying to achieve success in the United States. In 2007, he had a role on the animated television series &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, appearing as himself in season 2, episode 5, &quot;The Story of Thugnificent&quot; and episode 15, &quot;The Story of Gangstalicious Part 2&quot; from the same season. In 2008, Fatman Scoop and his then-wife Shanda hosted a reality show and podcast on MTV called &quot;Man and Wife&quot;. The show covered topics such as jobs, finance, relationships, and sex.

On August 27, 2015, Fatman Scoop entered the &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 16: UK vs. USA&quot; house in the United Kingdom as a contestant. On September 14, he was the third housemate to be evicted, on day 20 where he finished in 11th place.

In July 2018, Fatman Scoop was featured on the remix to Ciara&#x27;s single &quot;Level Up&quot;, which also featured Missy Elliott; the single remix was the first song to feature all three artists since 2005&#x27;s &quot;Lose Control&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, being unable to travel, Fatman Scoop had to give up being a hype man, so he started up other businesses, including trucking and an ice cream company.

On August 30, 2024, Fatman Scoop released two collaborations; the first, with Bingo Players and Disco Fries on the single &quot;Our House&quot;. The second was &quot;Let It Go&quot; with Dyce Payso; an official music video was released on the same day. &quot;Our House&quot; heavily samples the instrumental to Ray J&#x27;s 2001 single &quot;Wait a Minute&quot;.

==Personal life==
Freeman had two children. He married twice, once to Shanda. They divorced after 13 years together.

==Death==
On August 30, 2024, Freeman collapsed during a performance in Hamden, Connecticut; CPR was administered at the scene and he was rushed to a nearby hospital. The following day, it was announced that he had died at the age of 56. His death was determined to be from natural causes, due to hypertensive heart disease and atherosclerosis.

<text>The Zafarnāma (Gurmukhi: ਜ਼ਫ਼ਰਨਾਮਾ; ) was a spiritual victory letter sent by Guru Gobind Singh in 1705 to the Mughal Emperor of India, Aurangzeb, after the Battle of Chamkaur.

== Background ==
In the aftermath of the second battle of Chamkaur, the Guru wanted to write a letter of condemnation to the Mughal emperor for breaking his oath swore upon the Quran by attacking the Sikhs who were evacuating the fort of Anandpur after a long siege when they were promised safe passage by Aurangzeb. The Guru did not rely upon the Mughal couriers to deliver the letter as he did not trust them to do so and he wanted to know how the emperor would react to its contents so he decided to send Daya Singh and Dharam Singh to deliver the letter personally. Daya Singh had previously delivered a letter from the Guru addressed to the emperor from Ghulal on 26 December 1704. Guru Gobind Singh sent 5 Singhs including Daya Singh, Dharam Singh and Sambhal Singh with the help of Naib Subedar Haji Sardar Shah to deliver the Zafarnama to Emperor Aurangzeb in Ahmednagar on 5 January 1707, the last day of Ramadaan that year.

The letter was written at Kangar village in modern-day Bathinda district and dispatched from the same place, or from the nearby village of Dina in modern-day Moga district. According to Sikh tradition, the village of Dina located near the district&#x27;s border with the neighbouring Bathinda district is where Guru Gobind Singh rested for a few days after the Second Battle of Chamkaur. Scholar Louis E. Fenech states the Guru rested at Dina at the house (specifically an upper story room called a &quot;chubārā&quot;) of a local Sikh named Bhai Desu Tarkhan after sending the Zafarnama from Kangar village, entrusted in the hands of Bhai Dharam Singh and Bhai Daya Singh. A gurdwara, &quot;Zafarnama Gurdwara Lohgarh Sahib Pind Dina Patishahi Dasvin&quot;, commemorates his stay at Dina, Moga, and a sign there claims the Guru stayed at the location for 3 months and 13 days. Harbans Singh in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Sikhism&quot; states the Guru only stayed at Dina for a few days conversely to the claims of the Gurdwara. He further states that he stayed with two local Sikhs named Chaudhry Shamir and Lakhmir, the grandsons of a local cheiftain named Rai Jodh, whom had served the sixth Sikh guru, Hargobind, and fought and died at the Battle of Mehraj. Guru Gobind Singh gathered an army of hundreds of locals from Dina and the surrounding area and continued on his journey.

== Content ==
Christopher Shackle divides the work into five parts:

# the invocation of God
# the loss of Anandpur
# the battle of Chamkaur
# the address to Aurangzeb
# the conclusion

In this letter, Guru Gobind Singh reminds Aurangzeb how he and his soldiers had broken their oaths sworn upon the Qur&#x27;an, when they promised safe passage to the Guru but launched a hidden attack of an army described as much larger, on forty famished Sikh soldiers. He tells Aurangzeb this was not a battle, it was a slaughter. As such, in spite of losing most of his Sikhs in this attack, he had won a moral victory over the Emperor who had broken his vows to Allah. He also states that despite sending a huge army to capture or kill the Guru, the Mughal forces did not succeed in their mission.

In the 111 verses of this notice, Guru Gobind Singh rebukes Aurangzeb for his weaknesses as a human being and for his lack of morality as a leader. Guru Gobind Singh also confirms his confidence and his unflinching faith in the Almighty even after suffering extreme personal loss of his father, mother, all four of his sons, and many fellow Sikhs to Aurangzeb&#x27;s tyranny.
Guru Gobind Singh then invites Aurangzeb to meet him in Kangar village near Bathinda (Punjab) and assures him the Brar tribe will not harm him (Aurangzeb) as they are under his command.

&quot;On the way there will be no danger to your life, for, the whole tribe of Brars accepts my command.&quot;

Of the 111 or 112 verses, the maximum numbers of 34 verses are to praise God; 32 deal with Aurangzeb’s invitation for the Guru to meet him and the Guru&#x27;s refusal to meet the Emperor – instead the Guru asks Aurangzeb to visit him; 24 verses detail the events in the Battle of Chamkaur, which took place on 22 December 1704; 15 verses reprove Aurangzeb for breaking promise given by him and by his agents to the Guru; In verses 78 and 79, Guru Gobind Singh had also warned Aurangzeb about the resolve of the Khalsa not to rest till the Mughal Empire is destroyed; 6 verses praise Aurangzeb.

In the work, the criteria for invoking dharamyudh is listed:

The work is sometimes considered to be the first of the &quot;Hikayats&quot;, with the remaining 11 works following it in the Dasam Granth.

== Language ==
The letter is written in Persian. However, in one recension there are four verses in Braj. It was originally written in the Perso-Arabic script rather than in Gurmukhi. The version currently in circulation found in the Dasam Granth, the compilation of Guru Gobind Singh’s poetry, is in Gurmukhi script and Persian verse. Copies printed and sold today are usually in Gurmukhi script.

== Manuscripts ==

A still-extant copy of the original document is said to have been prepared by Bhai Daya Singh. 

== Authenticity ==
Academics Anil Chander Banerjee and Christopher Shackle believe the extant work is not the authentic one as originally written by Guru Gobind Singh. According to Banerjee, the current text is unsuited for political correspondence and the original letter may have been written in prose which was later transformed into a poetic piece, which is the present composition that has been handed down. A similar position was held by Shackle, who thought the original work was in prose but was later rewritten in a poetic style, emulated upon the epic metres of the Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnama&quot;, effectively borrowing elements of Islamicate literature to have a more powerful effect of undercutting the &quot;moral authority&quot; of the recipient, Aurangzeb, a devout Muslim. One view is that the original prose of the authentic letter by the Guru was transformed into poetry by Bhai Nand Lal, but Banerjee finds holes in this theory as the text is incorporated as part of the Dasam Granth, presented as the Guru&#x27;s writings alongside other works of his. 

The &quot;Zafarnama&quot; is similar to the &quot;Fatehnama&quot;, another purported work ascribed to the tenth Guru. The Fatehnama survives as a work of complete couplets and one incomplete couplet.

== Translations ==
The work was first translated into Punjabi. It has been translated into English by Navtej Sarna.

<text>A network security policy (NSP) is a generic document that outlines rules for computer network access, determines how policies are enforced and lays out some of the basic architecture of the company security/ network security environment. The document itself is usually several pages long and written by a committee. 

A security policy is a complex document, meant to govern data access, web-browsing habits, use of passwords, encryption, email attachments and more. It specifies these rules for individuals or groups of individuals throughout the company. The policies could be expressed as a set of instructions that understood by special purpose network hardware dedicated for securing the network.

Security policy should keep the malicious users out, and also exert control over potential risky users within an organization. 

Understanding what information and services are available and to which users, as well as what the potential is for damage and whether any protection is already in place to prevent misuse are important when writing a network security policy. In addition, the security policy should dictate a hierarchy of access permissions, granting users access only to what is necessary for the completion of their work. The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides an example security-policy guideline.

<text>The National Assembly of the Republic of Korea () is the unicameral national legislature of South Korea. Elections to the National Assembly are held every four years. The latest legislative elections were held on 10 April 2024. The current National Assembly held its first meeting, and also began its current four year term, on 30 May 2024. The current Speaker was elected 5 June 2024. The National Assembly has 300 seats, with 253 constituency seats and 47 proportional representation seats; 30 of the PR seats are assigned an additional member system, while 17 PR seats use the parallel voting method.

The unicameral assembly consists of at least 200 members according to the South Korean constitution. In 1990 the assembly had 299 seats, 224 of which were directly elected from single-member districts in the general elections of April 1988. Under applicable laws, the remaining seventy-five representatives were elected from party lists. By law, candidates for election to the assembly must be at least thirty years of age. As part of a political compromise in 1987, an earlier requirement that candidates have at least five years&#x27; continuous residency in the country was dropped to allow Kim Dae-jung, who had spent several years in exile in Japan and the United States during the 1980s, to return to political life. The National Assembly&#x27;s term is four years. In a change from the more authoritarian Fourth Republic and Fifth Republic (1972–81 and 1981–87, respectively), under the Sixth Republic, the assembly cannot be dissolved by the president.
==Building==
The main building in Yeouido, Seoul, is a stone structure with seven stories above ground and one story below ground. The building has 24 columns, which means the legislature&#x27;s promise to listen to people 24/7 throughout the year.

==Structure and appointment==
===Speaker===

The constitution stipulates that the assembly is presided over by a Speaker and two Deputy Speakers, who are responsible for expediting the legislative process. The Speaker and Deputy Speakers are elected in a secret ballot by the members of the Assembly, and their term in office is restricted to two years. The Speaker is independent of party affiliation (to compared to the two vice-speakers who are affiliated with the two leading political parties), and the Speaker and Deputy Speakers may not simultaneously be government ministers.

The Secretary General of the National Assembly is the head of the Secretariat of the National Assembly, which is the department that oversees the affairs of the National Assembly. They are government officials and are treated as ministers. (Ministerial level). As with the President of the National Assembly, party membership is limited and he must be affiliated to no political party during his term in the Assembly.

===Negotiation groups===
Parties that hold at least 20 seats in the assembly form floor negotiation groups (, Hanja: 交涉團體, RR: ), which are entitled to a variety of rights that are denied to smaller parties. These include a greater amount of state funding and participation in the leaders&#x27; summits that determine the assembly&#x27;s legislative agenda.

In order to meet the quorum, the United Liberal Democrats, who then held 17 seats, arranged to &quot;rent&quot; three legislators from the Millennium Democratic Party. The legislators returned to the MDP after the collapse of the ULD-MDP coalition in September 2001.

===Legislative process===

For a legislator to introduce a bill, they must submit the proposal to the Speaker, accompanied by the signatures of at least ten other assembly members. A committee must then review the bill to verify that it employs precise and orderly language. Following this, the Assembly may either approve or reject the bill.

=== Committees ===
There are 17 standing committees which examine bills and petitions falling under their respective jurisdictions, and perform other duties as prescribed by relevant laws.

* House Steering Committee
* Legislation and Judiciary Committee
* National Policy Committee
* Strategy and Finance Committee
* Education Committee
* Science, ICT, Broadcasting and Communications Committee
* Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee
* National Defense Committee
* Public Administration and Security Committee
* Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee
* Agriculture, Food, Rural Affairs, Oceans and Fisheries Committee
* Trade, Industry, Energy, SMEs and Startups Committee
* Health and Welfare Committee
* Environment and Labor Committee
* Land Infrastructure and Transport Committee
* Intelligence Committee
* Gender Equality and Family Committee

===Election===


The National Assembly has 300 seats, with 254 constituency seats under FPTP and 46 proportional representation seats. With electoral reform taken in 2019, the PR seats apportionment method was replaced by a variation of additional member system from the previous parallel voting system. However, 17 seats were temporarily assigned under parallel voting in the 2020 South Korean legislative election.

Per Article 189 of Public Official Election Act, the PR seats are awarded to parties that have either obtained at least 3% of the total valid votes in the legislative election or at least five constituency seats. The number of seats allocated to each eligible party is decided by the formula:

formula_1

where

* = total number of seats in the National Assembly.
* = number of seats obtained by ineligible parties and independents.
* = number of constituency seats obtained by the party.
* = total number of seats allocated for additional member system.

If the integer is less than 1, then is set to 0 and the party does not get any seats. Then the sum of initially allocated seats is compared to the total seats for the additional member system and recalculated.

formula_2

formula_3

Final seats are assigned through the largest remainder method, and if the remainder is equal, the winner is determined by lottery among the relevant political parties.

The voting age was also lowered from 19 to 18 years old, expanding the electorate by over half a million voters.

==Legislative violence==
From 2004 to 2009, the assembly gained notoriety as a frequent site for legislative violence. The Assembly first came to the world&#x27;s attention during a violent dispute on impeachment proceedings for then President Roh Moo-hyun, when open physical combat took place in the assembly. Since then, it has been interrupted by periodic conflagrations, piquing the world&#x27;s curiosity once again in 2009 when members battled each other with sledgehammers and fire extinguishers. The National Assembly since then has taken preventive measures to prevent any more legislative violence.

== Historical composition ==
==History==
===First Republic===

Elections for the assembly were held under UN supervision on 10 May 1948. The First Republic of Korea was established on 17 July 1948 when the constitution of the First Republic was established by the Assembly. The Assembly also had the job of electing the president and elected anti-communist Syngman Rhee as president on 10 May 1948.

Under the first constitution, the National Assembly was unicameral. Under the second and third constitutions, the National Assembly was to be bicameral and consist of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors, but in practice, the legislature was unicameral because the House of Representatives was prevented from passing the law necessary to establish the House of Councillors.




===Second Republic===


===Third Republic===
Since the reopening of the National Assembly in 1963 until today, it has been unicameral.
===Fourth Republic===

===Fifth Republic===

===Sixth Republic===

<doc id="601429" wikidata="Q333773" url="?curid=601429" title="Michael Stewart, Baron Stewart of Fulham">
<text>Robert Michael Maitland Stewart, Baron Stewart of Fulham, (6 November 1906 – 10 March 1990) was a British Labour Party politician, life peer and Fabian Socialist who was a Member of Parliament for 34 years, and served twice as Foreign Secretary in the first cabinet of Harold Wilson.

==Early life==
The son of Robert Wallace Stewart, author and lecturer, and Eva Stewart née Blaxley, Robert Michael Maitland Stewart was born in Bromley. He was educated at Brownhill Road Elementary School, Catford, Christ&#x27;s Hospital and St. John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first class BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1929. Whilst at Oxford he was involved in student politics and was elected as President of the Oxford Union for Michaelmas Term 1929. He was also the president of St John&#x27;s Labour Club that same year.

Stewart began his career as an official in the Royal Household during 1931. He worked for a short period with the Secretariat of the League of Nations, before becoming a schoolmaster, first at the Merchant Taylors&#x27; School in London, then at Coopers&#x27; Company&#x27;s School, Mile End, and then at Frome, Somerset. During World War II, Stewart served in the Middle East, joining the Intelligence Corps in 1942, before transferring to the Army Educational Corps in 1943. He was promoted to captain in 1944.

On 26 July 1941 he married Mary Birkinshaw, later Baroness Stewart of Alvechurch; they had no children. They were one of the few couples who both held titles in their own right.

==Political career==
Stewart had contested the Lewisham West constituency in 1931 and 1935, and Fulham East in 1936; after the war he became MP for Fulham East 1945–55, then for Fulham 1955–74, and Hammersmith, Fulham 1974–79. Soon after his initial election, he was made one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury (more commonly known as a junior whip), then a junior minister, as Under-Secretary of State for War (1947–51) and later as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply (May–October 1951). Following Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 1951 election, Stewart was a rising figure on the shadow front bench, serving as Shadow Minister of Education (1955–59) and then as Shadow Minister of Housing and Local Government (1959–64).

On May 21, 1952 during the British Malayan headhunting scandal, Stewart asked Henry Hopkinson in the House of Commons if the government intended to punish British soldiers caught posing with decapitated human heads in images taken during the Malayan Emergency and leaked by the &quot;Daily Worker.&quot; Hopkinson confirmed to Stewart that none of the British soldiers would be punished, claiming that said soldiers had never explicitly been forbidden from mutilating corpses.

Stewart was Fabian Summer School director in 1952 and lecturer in 1954. He was Fabian New Year School lecturer in 1954–55 and publicist in 1956. He is listed as a member of the Fabian Society International Bureau Committee during 1957–58 and was mentioned in &quot;Fabian News&quot; November – December 1964 as a former member of the Fabian Executive Committee.

==Government 1964–70==
When Harold Wilson became Prime Minister in 1964, Stewart was appointed Secretary of State for Education and Science. He was promoted to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in January 1965 after his predecessor Patrick Gordon Walker&#x27;s bid to regain a House of Commons seat in the 1965 Leyton by-election failed. He was described by the press as relatively unknown to the public but was extremely well known within Fabian socialist circles. He became Secretary of State for Economic Affairs in 1966. From 1966 to 1968, he was First Secretary of State. He returned to the Foreign Office from 1968 to 1970. As foreign secretary, he was instrumental in supplying arms to support the Nigerian military dictatorship&#x27;s crushing of the secessionist Republic of Biafra in the Nigerian Civil War (when up to one million people died), later saying &quot;It would have been quite easy for me to say: This is going to be difficult – let&#x27;s cut off all connexion with the Nigerian Government. If I&#x27;d done that I should have known that I was encouraging in Africa the principle of tribal secession – with all the misery that could bring to Africa in the future.&quot;

==Post-Government==
A committed pro-European, Stewart was leader of the Labour Delegation to the Council of Europe in June 1970, and joint president of the Labour Committee for Europe with George Brown and Roy Jenkins. He served as a member of the European Parliament from 1975 to 1976.

Stewart was a supporter of a United Ireland, supporting a peaceful resolution to the partition of Ireland.

Stewart was made a member of the Privy Council in 1964. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 1969 New Year Honours. He retired from the House of Commons in 1979. He was elevated to the House of Lords, being created a life peer with the title Baron Stewart of Fulham, of Fulham in Greater London, on 5 July 1979.

Brian Harrison recorded an oral history interview with Stewart, in March 1978, as part of the Suffrage Interviews project, titled &quot;Oral evidence on the suffragette and suffragist movements: the Brian Harrison interviews.&quot;  Stewart discusses his teaching career and his connection with the Association for Education in Citizenship.

He died at a hospital in London on 10 March 1990, at the age of 83.

<text>David Pratt (born 3 January 1955) is a former Canadian politician. He was the Member of Parliament for Nepean—Carleton from 1997 until 2004.

==Early political career==
Before Pratt was elected federally, he served in public office municipally. In 1988, he won a seat on Nepean City Council. His re-election in 1991 also gave him a seat on the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Municipality Council. In the municipal election of 1994, his candidacy was uncontested and he was acclaimed. On Nepean Council, Pratt served a term as Deputy Mayor and chaired the committees of Public Works and Parks and Recreation. On Regional Council, he worked on transportation and environment issues and was a member of the Ottawa-Carleton Police Services Board and the OC Transpo Commission. He served for five years on the board of directors of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities where he was involved in community safety and crime prevention issues, district energy and international development programs in Africa.

==National politics==
As Minister of National Defence, Pratt received cabinet support for several major procurement projects totalling $7 billion including the Maritime Helicopter Program (Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone) to replace the aging Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King fleet, the M1128 mobile gun system (later cancelled) and a new fixed wing search and rescue aircraft to replace the CH-115 and C-130H Herįcules (CC-295). He also obtained federal cabinet approval for the Joint Support Ship program to provide new supply ships for the Canadian Navy. As the local Ottawa cabinet minister in 2004, he worked with provincial and municipal officials to assemble $600 million in funding for a proposed light rail transit system (LRT) Following the election in 2006 of a new Ottawa Mayor, Larry O’Brien, who replaced Mayor Bob Chiarelli, and with the support of the local Conservative Cabinet Minister, John Baird, the transit project was cancelled by the City of Ottawa. Long delays in planning and construction meant that the first section of the LRT system was only opened in 2019.

As Chair of the Commons Defence Committee, he was a strong advocate for increased military spending both before and after the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001. Under his leadership, the defence committee released a report entitled: &quot;Facing Our Responsibilities: The state of readiness of the Canadian Forces&quot; which called for substantial new investments in Canada&#x27;s military capabilities. As committee chair, Pratt also argued strongly for a more bi-partisan approach to defence issues and for regular reviews of Canadian foreign and defence policy. He successfully sponsored a resolution in Parliament to declare the first Sunday in June &quot;Canadian Forces Day&quot; and contributed to policy debates on defence and security matters with two papers: &quot;Fostering Human Security: A Joint Canada-US Brigade,&quot; (October 2000) and &quot;Does Canada Need A Foreign Intelligence Agency?&quot; (March 2003).
In 1999, Pratt served as a Special Envoy for Lloyd Axworthy, Minister of Foreign Affairs to Sierra Leone and performed the same role for Axworthy&#x27;s successor, John Manley. He visited the war torn country on several occasions. He met and held talks with the former Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, and former President Charles Taylor of Liberia, President Lansana Conte of Guinea. There were also meetings and consultations with other senior officials and diplomatic representatives including Revolutionary United Front leader Foday Sankoh. He wrote two reports - &quot;The Forgotten Crisis&quot; (April 1999) and &quot;Sierra Leone: Danger and Opportunity in a Regional Conflict&quot; (July 2001). His recommendations called for more Canadian aid to Sierra Leone and more direct Canadian involvement to bring peace to the region. He also suggested that Liberian President Charles Taylor be investigated by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in prolonging the regional conflict. Pratt also introduced the first legislation in Canada to certify diamonds under the United Nations sanctioned Kimberley Process to stop the trade in blood diamonds and to protect the integrity of the Canadian diamond industry. Similar government sponsored legislation was eventually passed by Parliament.

An advocate of physical fitness, in July 2003, he completed the gruelling four-day 160 kilometre International Four Days Marches Nijmegen with members of the Canadian Forces – the first Canadian Member of Parliament to do so. In the 2004 federal election, he lost his seat to Conservative Party of Canada candidate Pierre Poilievre, forcing his departure as Defence Minister three weeks later.

==Career after politics==

Following his electoral loss, Pratt joined the Canadian Red Cross as a Special Advisor in November 2004. He worked on issues related to conflict prevention, small arms and light weapons and international humanitarian law. During the aftermath of the December 2004 South East Asia Tsunami, he visited Thailand and Sri Lanka where, with the cooperation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), he submitted a report to the Canadian Red Cross with recommendations for Canadian aid. In 2006, he helped initiate the Canadian Red Cross&#x27;s Auxiliary to Government project. The project sought to improve the cooperation between the Canadian Red Cross and governments at all levels in Canada, especially in the area of emergency management. It emphasized the special and distinct role that Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have under domestic and international law and the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The project also sought to obtain new legislation to replace the outdated The Canadian Red Cross Society Act, 1909. As the project leader, Pratt authored a discussion paper entitled: &quot;Toward a Renewed Canadian Red Cross – Forging Stronger Partnerships In Support of a Humanitarian Agenda&quot; and the project&#x27;s interim report entitled: &quot;Revitalizing the Framework of Cooperation with Public Authorities&quot;.

In July 2008, Pratt left the Canadian Red Cross and ran as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Ottawa West—Nepean where he faced incumbent minister John Baird. He received 20,161 votes or 36.1 percent compared to Baird&#x27;s 25,109 votes and 44.9 percent of the vote. Following the election, Pratt worked as a consultant. In 2009 and 2010, he spent over five months in Baghdad, Iraq employed by AECOM on the USAID sponsored Iraq Legislative Strengthening Program. Pratt was responsible for organizing an orientation and training program for newly elected Iraqi MPs. He also provided teaching material on legislative committees, the concept of parliamentary privilege and codes of ethics for parliamentarians. In August 2009, a three vehicle convoy in which Pratt and four other colleagues were travelling was hit by an IED. The explosion, which occurred in the Red Zone in Baghdad, caused significant vehicle damage and blew out windows in the surrounding area, but no one was hurt.

In January 2011, Pratt accepted the position of Senior Vice President of Public Affairs with GCI Canada, a public affairs company with offices in Toronto and Ottawa. In September 2012, Pratt started his own company, David Pratt &amp; Associates, which is a government relations and strategic consulting firm based in Ottawa. His clients are predominantly defence and security companies interested in procurement opportunities with the Government of Canada. They have included major international defence companies such as Raytheon, Nexter, Leonardo, L3 Harris and Oshkosh Defense as well as cybersecurity and IT companies - large and small.

Pratt served as a Senior Fellow of the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute. He is also an honorary member of the Royal Military College of Canada. He has served on the board of directors of Serenity House, a residential substance abuse treatment centre in Ottawa. In October 2014, Pratt was inducted into the Order of St George, the Canadian priory, which traces its roots back to King Kàroly Robert of Hungary in 1326. Since 2014, Pratt has served as the Honorary Consul in Ottawa for the Government of Sierra Leone.

He has authored several papers and lectures including: &quot;Re-tooling for New Challenges: Parliaments as Peace-builders&quot;, (June 2005), &quot;Is There a Grand Strategy in Canadian Foreign Policy&quot; Ellis Lectures, University of Calgary, Centre for Military and Strategic Studies, (12–14 June 2007) and &quot;Canadian Grand Strategy and Lessons Learned&quot; (April 2008), Journal of Transatlantic Studies, United Kingdom). He authored a paper on Canada&#x27;s Reserve Forces entitled &quot;Canada’s Citizen Soldiers: A Discussion Paper&quot; (March 2011) for the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute. In October 2018, Pratt participated in the Oxford Union debates and spoke in favour of the proposition act &quot;The War on Terror has been its own worst enemy&quot;.

<text>Sveti Stefan (Montenegrin and Serbian: Свети Стефан, ; lit. &quot;Saint Stephen&quot;) is a town in Budva Municipality, on the Adriatic coast of Montenegro, approximately southeast of Budva. The town is known for the Aman Sveti Stefan resort, a 5-star franchise of the international group of Aman Resorts.

Sveti Stefan consists of a small island now connected to the mainland by a narrow tombolo and the mainland part, where most of the residents live.

==Geography==

The island has a coast line in the central part of Montenegro Adriatic coast line. It is situated to the south of Budva between Pržno and Petrovac na Moru. The pink sandy beaches of Sveti Stefan, Miločer Beach, and Queen&#x27;s Beach are part of the coastline. The island encompasses an area of .

==History==
The earliest record of Sveti Stefan is as the capital of the Paštrovići community, which became a protectorate of the Republic of Venice in 1423, having been independent since the twelfth century. The Paštrovići accepted Venetian sovereignty because they were fearful of attack from the Turks. They retained considerable autonomy and paid no tribute to Venice, in return for ceasing piracy against Venetian ships.

According to a legend recounted by Stjepan Mitrov Ljubiša, the town fortification was funded after Paštrovići looted Turkish ships moored in front of Jaz during Barbarossa&#x27;s siege of Kotor in 1539. The town was razed shortly after, during the Fourth Ottoman–Venetian War. After continuous pleas by Paštrovići, the Venetian Republic agreed to rebuild it in the 16th century. In the 15th century, the fortified village was built to defend against the Turks and became a haven for pirates of the Adriatic.

Initially, the island with its fortress had twelve families. In the 1800s, a village was established on the island with a population of about 400 people. Villa Miločer was built between 1934 and 1936 as the summer residence of Queen Marija Karađorđević (1900–1961) of the Karađorđević family of Serbia, which was refurbished as part of the Aman Sveti Stefan resorts that opened in 2008–2009. The villa, surrounded by 800 olive trees, is laid out over a plot.

The population of the island declined in the first half of the twentieth century, as residents left to join the armed forces or to move overseas. From 400 inhabitants in the nineteenth century, there were just 20 remaining by 1954. The Yugoslav government converted it into a luxury hotel and moved the remaining inhabitants to the mainland, and the island village became an exclusive resort frequented by high-profile elites of the world.

One of the four churches belonging to Praskvica Monastery on Sveti Stefan was turned into a casino by the government. The resort was visited by many celebrities, including Orson Welles, Elizabeth Taylor, Sophia Loren, Marilyn Monroe, Princess Margaret, Carlo Ponti, Ingemar Stenmark, and Kirk Douglas. It was described as &quot;a &#x27;70s Adriatic playground on a hilly peninsula that&#x27;s barely connected to the mainland&quot;. It was also a venue for political conferences and an occasional chess venue, attracting top-class players such as Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer. However, the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s brought a decline to the resort.

The Government of Montenegro proposed to recreate the old charm of the island, inviting international bids for a revitalization project. The contract was awarded to Aman Resorts in 2007, and the refurbished resort was completed in 2009. The Aman Sveti Stefan has a 30-year lease. On 13 July 2010 Montenegrin Statehood Day, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli gave a concert at the resort to mark the Golden Jubilee of the hotel. The hotel won the Hotel of the Year award from Gallivanter&#x27;s Guide in 2010.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 364.

Population by ethnicity in 2011:

* 127 Montenegrins
* 206 Serbs
* 15 Undeclared
* 16 Others

== Aman Sveti Stefan ==
Aman Sveti Stefan (formerly Sveti Stefan Hotel) is a hotel resort in the town of Sveti Stefan, on the Adriatic coast of Montenegro. The resort includes the islet of Sveti Stefan and part of the mainland, where the Villa Miločer () part of the resort is located. The hotel is a 5-star franchise hotel of the international group of Aman Resorts, completed in 2009 and operating under a 30-year lease. The hotel has been closed since early 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic, and remains closed with no announced reopening date.

=== Facilities ===
The Aman Sveti Stefan resort has 58 guest rooms, cottages, and suites, including 8 suites that are part of the Villa Miločer.

Out of the eight suites of Villa Miločer, two are Queen Marija Suites forming an annex structure. The main dining of the resort on the island of Sveti Stefan is The Piazza, an open-air square in the heart of the island&#x27;s village which includes the &quot;Taverna&quot;, &quot;Enoteca&quot;, &quot;Pasticceria&quot;, an Antipasti Bar, and a Cigar Room.

<text>The University System of Georgia (USG) is the government agency that includes 26 public institutions of higher learning in the U.S. state of Georgia. The system is governed by the Georgia Board of Regents. It sets goals and dictates general policy to educational institutions as well as administering the Public Library Service of the state which includes 58 public library systems. The USG also dispenses public funds (allocated by the state&#x27;s legislature) to the institutions but not the lottery-funded HOPE Scholarship. The USG is the sixth largest university system in the United States by total student enrollment, with 344,392 students in 26 public institutions as of 2023. USG institutions are divided into four categories: research universities, regional comprehensive universities, state universities, and state colleges.

The system designates four institutions as &quot;research universities&quot;: Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Georgia, Augusta University, and Georgia State University. The University of Georgia is the state and system&#x27;s flagship university, the state&#x27;s oldest institution of higher learning, and one of the state&#x27;s two land-grant universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;UGA/GRU Medical Partnership: About&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After its 2016 merger with Georgia Perimeter College, Georgia State University became the largest institution of higher learning in the USG, with over 50,000 students. University of North Georgia is the state&#x27;s designated military school. There are three historically black schools housed within the USG: Savannah State University, Albany State University, and the state&#x27;s second land-grant university, Fort Valley State University.

In 2012, all USG institutions combined had a $14.1 billion economic impact on the state of Georgia. Georgia Tech in Atlanta and University of Georgia in nearby Athens had the largest impacts on their regional economies: $2.6 billion and 20,869 jobs at Georgia Tech and $2.2 billion and 22,196 jobs at the University of Georgia. Georgia State University&#x27;s central campus in Atlanta had a $1.6 billion economic impact with 13,736 jobs; given its merger with Perimeter College, with an economic impact of $600 million, Georgia State&#x27;s overall economic impact on the Atlanta metro area is $2.2 billion.

==History==

=== Early years ===
The University System of Georgia was created with the passage of the Reorganization Act of 1931 by the Georgia General Assembly in 1931. The Reorganization Act created a Board of Regents to oversee the state&#x27;s colleges and universities and the 26 boards of trustees that had provided oversight over the various institutions before passage of the act. The Board of Regents officially took office on January 1, 1932, and consisted of eleven members to be appointed by the Governor of Georgia pending approval from the Georgia Senate. The Governor held an &quot;ex officio&quot; position on the Board. The regents were to elect a chairman and select a secretary. One regent was appointed from each of Georgia&#x27;s ten congressional districts and the eleventh member was chosen at large.

Governor Richard Russell Jr.&#x27;s initial appointees included Cason Jewell Callaway Sr., Martha Berry, Richard Russell Sr. (the governor&#x27;s father), George C. Woodruff, William Dickson Anderson Sr. (1873–1957), Egbert Erle Cocke Sr. (1895–1977) and Philip Robert Weltner Sr. (1887–1981). Anderson was elected chairman, Weltner vice-chairman and Cocke was appointed as the secretary/treasurer. Prior to the Reorganization Act, Georgia university chief executives held the title of chancellor; however, after the Act, University heads were given the title of president and a new chancellor position was created. The USG chancellor was selected and overseen by the board. At the request of the regents, Charles Snelling, the presiding head of the University of Georgia (UGA), stepped down from his position at UGA to become the initial chancellor of the entire system.

The 1932 Annual Report for the Board stated outstanding debts of $1,074,415. Over the next few years the USG endeavored to transform the state&#x27;s institutions of higher learning by reorganizing schools, merging and closing others and transforming course offerings and curriculum.

=== Modern history ===
In 2011, Chancellor Hank Huckaby recommended four consolidations among eight institutions, which would be implemented in 2013. The same year, the Board of Regents adopted six &quot;Principles for Consolidation&quot;, which has led to multiple consolidations in the subsequent years. As of 2018, these consolidations have decreased the number of USG colleges and universities from 35 to 26.

In Fall 2018, the university system saw enrollment reach an all-time high of 328,712 students enrolled across the system&#x27;s 26 colleges and universities. 

On March 6, 2019, an Atlanta court upheld a USG policy barring unauthorized immigrants from attending Georgia State, Georgia Tech, and the University of Georgia. 

In regards to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the USG decided against making wearing face coverings mandatory for the Fall 2020 semester before deciding to mandate them.

On April 1, 2022, former Georgia Governor and United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue became the system&#x27;s 14th Chancellor. That same month, the system was censured by the American Association of University Professors over changes to tenure protections.

Additionally, the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography was aligned with the University of Georgia, which became effective July 1, 2013.

==Georgia Research Alliance==
The Georgia Research Alliance is an Atlanta, Georgia-based nonprofit organization that coordinates research efforts between Georgia&#x27;s public and private sectors. While GRA receives a state appropriation for investment in university-based research opportunities, its operations are funded through foundation and industry contributions. In its first 19 years, GRA leveraged $525 million in state funding into $2.6 billion of additional federal and private investment.

In 2007, GRA coalesced the strengths of several universities into a focused research effort built around new types of vaccines and therapeutics.

GRA Eminent Scholars

GRA Eminent Scholars are top scientists from around the world recruited by the Georgia Research Alliance. For each scholar, GRA invests $750,000 for an endowment, an amount that the research university matches in private funds on a minimum 1-1 basis. Eminent Scholars often bring a research team, significant federal funding and private support for their research. Georgia&#x27;s investment in GRA Eminent Scholars has yielded more than $1 billion in outside grants and contracts for the state and helped to launch some 35 companies.

GRA&#x27;s Cancer Initiative
After 10 years as an independent nonprofit organization, the Georgia Cancer Coalition became an initiative of the Georgia Research Alliance on January 18, 2012. The move was part of a larger effort to align Georgia&#x27;s economic development assets in a more effective way.

GRA VentureLab

The Georgia Research Alliance set out to help launch companies around Georgian university research results, GRA launched its lead commercialization program, VentureLab, in 2002.

GRA also works with established Georgia companies through the Georgia Department of Economic Development and the Georgia Centers of Innovation in aerospace, logistics, life sciences, energy, agriculture and advanced manufacturing. The COIs help find technology solutions to industry challenges, in part by connecting companies to leading-edge research at Georgia&#x27;s universities.

From 2002 to 2010, GRA directed $19 million of state funding into VentureLab. During that time, more than 700 university inventions or discoveries have been evaluated for commercial potential. More than 107 active companies have been formed, which employ more than 650 Georgians. These companies have also attracted $460 million in equity investment and generated $77 million in revenue.

GRA Centers of Research Excellence

Centers of Research Excellence are collaborative and individual efforts that focus on one area of scientific research.

==List of institutions==

==History==


Aichi District was one of the ancient subdivisions of Owari Province, and its name (under a variety of spellings) appears in Nara period records and artifacts recovered from the ruins of Heijō-kyō Palace. It was occasionally referred to as , although the present name appears to have become standard after the middle of the Edo period. During the Sengoku period, this area was the stronghold of the Oda clan and was the birthplace of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, it came under the control of Owari Domain.

===District Timeline===
Following the Meiji Restoration, in 1871, former Owari Domain was renamed Nagoya Prefecture. However, for reasons still unclear, the name was changed to Aichi Prefecture. With the formal establishment of the municipality system on October 1, 1887, the modern Aichi District was established, with two towns (Atsuta and Narumi) and 46 villages. Yobitsugi was raised to town status on July 12, 1897, followed by Chikusa on February 13, 1902, and Aichi on December 10, 1904. In a major cadastral reorganization in 1906–1907, the number of remaining villages was reduced from 41 to 16, and the town of Atsuta was annexed by the city of Nagoya. The town of Shimonoisshiki was created on July 6, 1917. In another cadastral reform in 1921, the number of villages was reduced from 16 to 7, with the towns of Aichi and Yobitsugi annexed by Nagoya. The city of Nagoya further annexed Shimonoisshiki in March 1937, leaving the district with one town and 7 villages at the eve of World War II.

On February 11, 1955, the village of Hanyama merged into the city of Seto. Later that year, on April 5, 1955, the village of Chotaka merged into Chikusa-ku, Nagoya. The village of Tempaku (later Tempaku-ku) merged into Showa-ku, Nagoya. On January 1, 1957 Toyoake gained town status, following by Nisshin on January 1, 1958. On April 1, 1963 Narumi merged into Midori-ku, Nagoya.

Tōgō gained town status on April 1, 1970, followed by Nagakute on April 1, 1971. Toyoake was elevated to city status on August 1, 1972, followed by Nisshin on October 1, 1994.

===Recent mergers===
* On January 4, 2012 - The town of Nagakute gained city status to become the city of Nagakute.

<text>The Eisenhower Tunnel, officially the Eisenhower–Edwin C. Johnson Memorial Tunnel, is a dual-bore, four-lane vehicular tunnel in the western United States, approximately west of Denver, Colorado. The tunnel carries Interstate 70 (I-70) under the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains. With a maximum elevation of above sea level, it is one of the highest vehicular tunnels in the world. The tunnel is the longest mountain tunnel and highest point on the Interstate Highway System. Opened in 1973, the westbound bore is named after Dwight D. Eisenhower, the U.S. President for whom the Interstate system is also named. The eastbound bore was completed in 1979 and is named for Edwin C. Johnson, a Colorado governor and U.S. Senator who lobbied for an Interstate Highway to be built across Colorado.

==Description==

The Eisenhower Memorial Bore (westbound tunnel) is long, while the Edwin C. Johnson Memorial Bore (eastbound tunnel) is long. The tunnels are sloped with a 1.64% grade, with an elevation of at the east portal and at the west portal.

At its dedication, the Eisenhower Tunnel was the highest vehicular tunnel in the world. While it remains the highest vehicular tunnel in the US, and longest mountain tunnel and highest point on the Interstate Highway System, higher tunnels have since been constructed elsewhere, such as the Fenghuoshan Tunnel, a rail tunnel in China.

The tunnel bores measure . The traveled portion is a rectangular shape just over tall. The space above is used for forced air ventilation while the space below the roadway is used for drainage.

, more than 434 million vehicles had passed through the tunnel. This figure includes a significant number of visitors to Colorado&#x27;s ski resorts.

===Height restriction===
Due to additional height restrictions from variable-message signs and lighting systems, the original posted clearance of the tunnels was . The trucking industry lobbied the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) to increase the vertical clearance. In 2007, the tunnel was retrofitted with lower-profile lighting and signs, increasing its clearance by to .

A height detector near each tunnel entrance sounds a siren and turns traffic signals red, stopping all traffic, if an overheight vehicle attempts to enter the tunnel. The entrance will remain closed until the vehicle is removed from the freeway, which can cause severe delays. CDOT noted that prior to the retrofit, about 20,000 vehicles per year tripped the alarm. The trucking industry argued that many of these trucks were under the height requirement but tripped the alarm due to their air suspensions (which can be lowered during their journey through the tunnel) or due to snow and ice atop the trailer. During this time, the trucking industry estimated the number of alarms would drop by as much as 80% if the clearance could be raised even a few inches.

The 2007 retrofit also added a weigh-in-motion system that calculates a safe speed for trucks on the 7% grades and curves on the departures from the tunnels and displays it to each driver.

===Alternate route===
While the tunnel has largely supplanted the older route of U.S. Highway 6 over Loveland Pass, hazardous material carriers (hazmats), bicycles, and pedestrians are prohibited from the tunnel and must use the pass, which is longer, steeper, and higher at . And while the tunnel&#x27;s route is less formidable than the pass, its approaches are steep nonetheless and have runaway truck ramps.

If Loveland Pass is closed—such as for construction or storms—the hazmat prohibition is temporarily lifted and the tunnel is closed to regular traffic once per hour to allow hazmats to be escorted through the tunnel in a convoy.

==History==
The idea for a tunnel under Loveland Pass existed since at least the 1950s. William A.H. Loveland had an idea of a tunnel under the divide in 1867, but instead got the wagon road now known as Loveland Pass built. Serious discussion began when the state of Colorado lobbied for the Interstate Highway System to route a transcontinental highway across Colorado. After a round of negotiations with Utah officials, it was decided the best option was to follow the US Route 6 corridor. Engineers recommended tunneling under the pass, rather than attempt to build a route across conforming to Interstate Highway standards.

The Eisenhower–Johnson Memorial Tunnel was known as the Straight Creek Tunnel during construction, named for the waterway that runs along the western approach to the tunnel. Before the tunnel was dedicated, it was renamed to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower and Edwin C. Johnson. The original Pioneer bore to access the two larger bores was &quot;holed through&quot; in late 1964, after fourteen months. Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines in the path of the tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores. The first construction contractor went bankrupt excavating rock in this fault zone. These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. Despite the best efforts of engineers, three workers were killed boring the first tube and four in boring the second.

Further complicating construction, the boring machines could not work as fast as expected at such high elevations and so the productivity was significantly less than planned. The frustration prompted one engineer to comment, &quot;We were going by the book, but the damned mountain couldn&#x27;t read.&quot; Though the project was supposed to take three years, the tunnel was not opened to traffic until a March 8, 1973, dedication ceremony by Governor John Love. Initially, the northern Eisenhower bore was used for two-way traffic, with one lane for each direction. The amount of traffic through the tunnel exceeded predictions, and efforts soon began to expedite construction on the southern bore. Construction began on the eastbound Edwin C. Johnson tunnel on August 18, 1975, and finished on December 21, 1979. The initial engineering cost estimate for the Eisenhower bore was $42 million, but the actual cost was $108 million (equivalent to $ million in 2025). Approximately 90% of the funds were paid by the federal government, with the state of Colorado paying the rest. At the time, it set a record for the most expensive federally aided project. The excavation cost for the Johnson bore was $102.8 million (equivalent to $ million in 2025). Not included in the figures is about $50 million in non-boring expenses during the construction of both tunnels.

Upon opening, it became the highest-elevation tunnel in the world, taking the title from the Salang Tunnel in Afghanistan.

The tunnel&#x27;s construction highlighted issues relevant to the feminist movement. When Janet Bonnema applied for a position as an engineering technician with the Colorado Department of Transportation she was given an assignment on the Straight Creek Tunnels project. Her supervisor misread her resume and thought that he was hiring &quot;James.&quot; When the supervisor discovered that the department had hired a woman, she was tasked with doing support work from the office. There was opposition to a woman entering the construction site. One supervisor stated that if she entered, &quot;Those workers would flat walk out of that there tunnel and they&#x27;d never come back.&quot; The workers, most of whom had a mining background, expressed a common superstition that a woman brought bad luck to a mine. One worker insisted, &quot;It&#x27;s a jinx. I&#x27;ve seen too many die after a woman was in the tunnel.&quot;

Bonnema sued the department for the right to work inside the tunnel. She countered she was in better shape and more agile than most of the men who were working on the tunnel. Emboldened by the passage of an equal rights law in Colorado, she finally entered the tunnel, with an entourage of reporters, on November 9, 1972. Some workers walked off the job, and at least one of them yelled, &quot;Get those women out of here.&quot; She remained determined and re-entered the tunnel a few days later. The next time, she dressed in coveralls and was even assigned tasks on the roof of the tunnel overlooking the men below. Surprised that nobody had apparently noticed that she was a woman, she stated, &quot;I had a good disguise.&quot; Bonnema continued to dress in coveralls during her subsequent work in the tunnel so as not to attract attention.

In November 2023, CDOT opened an updated operations center and new garage bays at the tunnels.

===Plane crash during construction===

On Friday, October 2, 1970, during the tunnel&#x27;s construction, workers constructing the tunnel were among the first on scene of a plane crash that had occurred less than northeast of the east portal. A Martin 4-0-4 charter aircraft, one of two carrying the college football team of Wichita State University, crashed just north of the highway (). Of the 40 passengers and crew on board, only nine survived. The team was on its way to a game with Utah State University in Logan and had recently refueled at Denver&#x27;s Stapleton International Airport. The plane carrying the team&#x27;s starters departed Denver and traveled a poorly planned scenic route. The other plane, carrying reserve players, followed the original route and landed safely in Logan.

==Water diversion==
While the Eisenhower Tunnel was primarily intended as a transportation tunnel, it also serves as a water tunnel for water diversion from the western side of the Continental Divide to the eastern side. Water from the Straight Creek watershed (a tributary of the Blue River), along with all seepage entering the tunnel, is discharged into Clear Creek for delivery to the Coors Brewing Company. Typically, the tunnel delivers over of water per year.

<doc id="601475" wikidata="Q664261" url="?curid=601475" title="Doom Patrol">
<text>Doom Patrol is a superhero team from DC Comics. The original Doom Patrol first appeared in &quot;My Greatest Adventure&quot; #80 (June 1963), and was created by writers Arnold Drake and Bob Haney, along with artist Bruno Premiani. Doom Patrol has appeared in different incarnations in multiple comics, and have been adapted to other media. The series&#x27; creator has suspected that Marvel Comics copied the basic concept to create the X-Men, which debuted a few months later.

Doom Patrol are a group of super-powered misfits whose &quot;gifts&quot; caused them alienation and trauma. Dubbed the &quot;world&#x27;s strangest heroes&quot; by editor Murray Boltinoff, the original team included the Chief (Niles Caulder), Robotman (Cliff Steele), Elasti-Girl (Rita Farr), and Negative Man (Larry Trainor); Beast Boy (Garfield Logan) and Mento (Steve Dayton) joined soon after. The team remained the featured characters of &quot;My Greatest Adventure&quot;, which was re-titled &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; as of issue #86 (March 1964). The original series was canceled in 1968 when Drake killed the team off in issue #121, last of that series, (September–October 1968). The team wouldn&#x27;t come back until 1987 at the hand of comic writer Paul Kupperberg until most of the new team were killed during the Invasion! event, at the nineteenth issue of the second volume of Doom Patrol, Scottish comic writer Grant Morrison transformed the title into a much more surreal and bizarre story that explored topics of mental health, gender identity, and sexual discovery in an abstract manner.
Morrison&#x27;s run garnered critical acclaim, and the mature themes of their stories led to the comic being integrated into Vertigo Comics. 

==Publication history==
===&quot;My Greatest Adventure&quot;: &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; (volume 1)===

Doom Patrol first appeared in 1963, when the DC title &quot;My Greatest Adventure&quot;, an adventure anthology, was being converted to a superhero format. The task, assigned to writer Arnold Drake, was to create a team that fit both of these formats. With fellow writer Bob Haney and artist Bruno Premiani, he created Doom Patrol, a team of super-powered misfits who were regarded as freaks by the world at large. According to Drake, editor Murray Boltinoff told him &quot;My Greatest Adventure&quot; was in danger of cancellation and he wanted him to create a new feature which might save it. Boltinoff was enthusiastic about Drake&#x27;s initial pitch with Elasti-Girl and Automaton (changed to Robotman by the team&#x27;s third appearance, issue #82), but Drake wanted a third character and enlisted Haney&#x27;s help in coming up with Negative Man. The team was initially announced as &quot;The Legion of the Strange&quot;.

Doom Patrol were announced on the cover art of &quot;My Greatest Adventure&quot; #80 (cover dated June 1963). Drake and Haney devised the plot for the issue together, and then each scripted half the issue independently (Drake the first half, Haney the second). Doctor Niles Caulder motivated the original Doom Patrol, bitter from being isolated from the world, to use their powers for the greater good. &quot;My Greatest Adventure&quot; was officially retitled &quot;The Doom Patrol&quot; beginning with issue #86.

In an interview, Drake discussed the conception of Doom Patrol.

The members of the Doom Patrol often quarrelled and had personal problems, something that was already common among superhero teams published by Marvel Comics such as Fantastic Four, but was novel among the DC lineup. Doom Patrol&#x27;s rogues gallery matched the strange, weird tone of the series. Villains included the immortality-seeking General Immortus, the shape-shifting Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man, and the Brotherhood of Evil led by the Brain, a disembodied brain kept alive by technology. The Brotherhood of Evil also included the intelligent gorilla Monsieur Mallah and Madame Rouge, who was given powers similar to those of Elongated Man, with the extra attribute of a malleable face, allowing her to impersonate various people.
The Doom Patrol had two crossovers: one with the Challengers of the Unknown, teaming up to fight Multi-Man and Multi-Woman; and second with the Flash in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #65.

As the popularity of the book waned, the publisher cancelled it. Drake killed off the entire Doom Patrol in the final issue, &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; #121 (September–October 1968) where Doom Patrol sacrificed their lives to Madame Rouge and General Zahl to save the small fishing village of Codsville, Maine. This was the first time in comic book history that a cancelled title was concluded with the death of its cast. Artist Bruno Premiani and editor Murray Boltinoff appeared at the beginning and the end of the story, asking fans to write to DC to resurrect Doom Patrol, although the latter was supposed to have been Arnold Drake. According to the writer, he was replaced with the editor because he had just resigned over a pay dispute and moved to Marvel Comics. He finished the script only out of friendship for Boltinoff. A few years later, three more issues appeared, reprints of earlier issues (#89, #95 and #90 appeared as #122, #123 and #124 respectively). A proper &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; revival did not occur until 1977, nine years after the original&#x27;s demise.

Some similarities exist between the original Doom Patrol and Marvel Comics&#x27; original X-Men; Marvel acknowledged the similarity in its humor title &quot;Not Brand Echh&quot;. Both include misfit superheroes shunned by society and both are led by men of preternatural intelligence who use wheelchairs. These similarities ultimately led series writer Arnold Drake to argue that the concept of the X-Men must have been based on the Doom Patrol.

Drake stated:
In an interview shortly before his death in 2007, Drake took a more moderate position, stating that while it is possible Lee took his ideas from Doom Patrol, he could also have arrived at a similar concept independently: &quot;Since we were working in the same vineyards, and if you do enough of that stuff, sooner or later, you will kind of look like you are imitating each other.&quot;

The Doom Patrol and the X-Men have many similarities. Both series feature stories that show the protagonists struggling with the mantle of heroism. Both teams are family-oriented with internal problems that are resolved through the aid of other members of the team. And both share some of the same writers such as Grant Morrison and John Byrne. However, while the Doom Patrol tends to go on bizarre and zany adventures, the X-Men tend to be more focused on the themes of racism and prejudice.

The four lead characters of the original series have much in common with the members of The Fantastic Four. Both teams, composed of a woman and three men, have one member with stretching powers, another with great strength trapped in a distorted or inhuman orange body, and a third whose form seems ablaze with fire or energy. One can extend the comparison by saying that the fourth member is either invisible or behind the scenes. This has inspired fan speculation that The Doom Patrol was inspired by, or imitative of, the earlier series. John Byrne, who has written and drawn all three sets of characters, has written that &quot;I wish someone would ask Arnold Drake about the Doom Patrol&#x27;s similarities with the Fantastic Four, instead of always bringing up the X-Men comparison.&quot;

===&quot;Showcase&quot;: Paul Kupperberg&#x27;s &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;===
Writer Paul Kupperberg, a longtime &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; fan, and artist Joe Staton introduced a new team in &quot;Showcase&quot; #94 (August–September 1977). DC was then lining up features for the &quot;Showcase&quot; revival—the series was initially an anthology that would debut new characters who could springboard into their own series if they proved sufficiently popular, and &quot;Showcase&quot; #94 was the first new issue of the series in almost seven years. Editor Paul Levitz instructed Kupperberg and Staton to do a Doom Patrol feature. Kupperberg opted to create a new lineup because he wanted to respect the story in which the Doom Patrol met their deaths, and was inspired by Len Wein and Dave Cockrum&#x27;s then-recent &quot;all-new, all-different X-Men&quot;. Kupperberg has since said he is not proud of the reboot, remarking that &quot;[I was] missing the point of the Doom Patrol. The original group were outsiders and freaks, while my new guys were just comic-book superheroes. I was young and inexperienced and new to writing, with about two years under my belt before getting the gig.&quot;

The new team is led by Celsius (Arani Desai), the Chief&#x27;s previously unseen wife, who recreates the Doom Patrol to protect herself from General Immortus. Robotman is the only survivor of the original Doom Patrol, and his ruined body is replaced by a new, futuristic one built by Dr. Will Magnus. The Negative Spirit now possesses Russian cosmonaut Valentina Vostok, making her Negative Woman (although its presence does not render her radioactive), and she is able to transform her own body into its form rather than sending it out under control. The final member is Tempest aka Joshua Clay, a Vietnam veteran/deserter who fires energy blasts from his hands.

This new version of the team did not receive its own series following its three-issue tryout. Kupperberg said this was most likely due to poor sales, as even in the months prior to the DC Implosion he heard no word of a new &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; series. However, the team did receive a series of guest appearances in various DC titles, such as &quot;Superman Family&quot; (in a three part arc in the Supergirl feature that was intended for the recently canceled &quot;Super-Team Family&quot;), &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; (teaming up with Superman in a story which revealed that Vostok&#x27;s powers had changed to match Larry Trainor&#x27;s exactly), and &quot;Supergirl&quot;. Robotman also appeared as an occasional supporting character in the Marv Wolfman and George Pérez era of &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, where it was revealed that Changeling, formerly DP associate Beast Boy, had arranged for Dayton Industries technicians to recreate the Caulder body design for Cliff. His first storyline here had him, the Titans, and a new Brotherhood of Evil battle Madame Rouge and General Zahl, the murderers of the original Doom Patrol, who died in the battle.

Eclipse Comics published &quot;Doom Patrol: The Official Index&quot; with covers drawn by John Byrne in 1984. The two-part series included all of their appearances from &quot;My Greatest Adventure&quot; #80 to their final appearance before their 1980s return.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; relaunch (volume 2, part 1)===
Kupperberg&#x27;s enthusiasm for the Doom Patrol remained, and in addition to writing some of the team&#x27;s post-&quot;Showcase&quot; appearances, he eventually wrote a proposal for a new Doom Patrol series. The proposal was green-lit, and Kupperberg laid the groundwork for the new series by writing the John Byrne-illustrated &quot;Secret Origins Annual&quot; #1, published in 1987, which recapped the origins of the two iterations of the Doom Patrol that had existed thus far. In October 1987, DC relaunched &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, written by Kupperberg and illustrated by Steve Lightle. Lightle took on the assignment with reluctance, having read and disliked Kupperberg&#x27;s new Doom Patrol in &quot;Showcase&quot; #94–96, and soon quit due to several grievances, such as not being involved in plotting the comic despite the editor repeatedly promising that he would be. He was replaced by a young Erik Larsen after issue #5. Kupperberg later commented, &quot;I like Erik&#x27;s work, but I don&#x27;t think he was exactly right for the Doom Patrol. To tell the truth, I don&#x27;t think either Erik or myself were happy with the arrangement, but we did our best to make it work.&quot; For his part, Larsen said he was perfectly happy on the series, in part because on the few occasions where he disliked an aspect of Kupperberg&#x27;s plots, he would simply revise the plot when he drew the issue. In retrospect, Larsen felt that this practice was overstepping his bounds, but said the editor never objected to it.

This incarnation was a more conventional superhero series than the original volume. It included new members who were hired to the team: the magnetically empowered strong-girl Lodestone (Rhea Jones); Karma (Wayne Hawking), whose psychic power make anyone trying to attack him fall over themselves; and Scorch (Scott Fischer), whose body generates phenomenal quantities of heat focused through his hands, requiring him to wear protective gloves at all times. A DC Comics Bonus Book appeared in issue #9 (June 1988). According to Kupperberg, sales on the series &quot;started out okay, and descended to the point where I was removed from the book and replaced by Grant Morrison in the hopes he could salvage the title.&quot;

===Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; (volume 2, part 2)===
After the first 18 issues (and various crossovers and annuals), Kupperberg was replaced by Grant Morrison and the comic was no longer submitted to the CCA for approval (relieving the stories and images depicted of several constraints), starting with issue #19. Kupperberg agreed to help Morrison by writing out characters Morrison did not want to use: Celsius and Scott Fischer died before issue #18: Celsius was killed in an explosion in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Invasion!&quot; event, and Scott Fischer (already experiencing a recurrence of childhood leukemia) was the only known active superhero casualty of the Dominators&#x27; gene-bomb (also in &quot;Invasion!&quot;); Karma had left the team as he was still on the run from the law (he became a member of the Suicide Squad and died on his first mission with them in the &quot;War of the Gods&quot; crossover event); the Negative Spirit left Negative Woman&#x27;s body; and Lodestone plunged into a coma, where she would remain for the first half of Morrison&#x27;s run on the book. Tempest gave up fieldwork to become the team&#x27;s physician. Conversely, Morrison picked up a throw-away character from &quot;DP&quot; #14, who was slipped into the art on the last page of #18 to set up Morrison&#x27;s use: Dorothy Spinner is an ape-faced girl with powerful &quot;imaginary friends.&quot; Morrison also substantially retooled Negative Man: Larry Trainor (revealed to be alive in the Kupperberg run, as a prisoner of an underground society but now powerless) is forcibly merged with the Negative Spirit (now a cosmic entity) and his doctor Eleanor Poole, creating an agender gestalt entity known as Rebis. The new writer introduced some new characters to the team, including Crazy Jane, who had multiple personalities, and sentient neighborhood Danny the Street.

Morrison used DC&#x27;s &quot;Invasion&quot; crossover to restart the book. They incorporated bizarre secret societies, elements of Dada, surrealism, and the cut-up technique pioneered by William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin. They also borrowed the ideas of Jorge Luis Borges and Heinrich Hoffmann. The original creator, Arnold Drake, said Morrison&#x27;s was the only subsequent run to reflect the intent of the original series.
Over the course of the series, Morrison dedicated some issues to parody and homage. Willoughby Kipling led the Doom Patrol on a parody of the Brujería story arc of &quot;Swamp Thing: A Murder of Crows&quot; in issues #31–32. Issue #42 featured the origin of Flex Mentallo, who was supposed to be the character in the Charles Atlas ad. A belated lawsuit from the Charles Atlas Company showed that DC was protected under Fair Use doctrine in addition to an expired statute of limitations. Issue #53 featured a dream sequence that mimicked the Stan Lee/Jack Kirby &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, borrowing plot points from &quot;The Galactus Trilogy&quot; (&quot;FF&quot; #48–50) and &quot;FF&quot; #51, &quot;This Man... This Monster!&quot;. A 1992 special called &quot;Doom Force&quot; was released as a one-shot and was meant to mimic and parody the &quot;X-Force&quot; book by Rob Liefeld. Issue #45 parodied Marvel&#x27;s Punisher and Alan Moore in a satire called the Beard Hunter, a perpetually clean-shaven serial killer who murders bearded men and targets the Chief.

Morrison&#x27;s villains were extremely unusual and strange, even by Doom Patrol&#x27;s eccentric standards. For example:

* Red Jack is a near-omnipotent being who thinks he is both Jack the Ripper and God. He lives in a house without windows, torturing butterflies to create the pain he needs to survive.
* The Brotherhood of Dada are an anarchistic group who fight against reality and reason. It features members such as Sleepwalk, who can only use her tremendous powers when asleep (she takes sleeping pills and listens to Barry Manilow before battles), The Quiz, who has &quot;every superpower you hadn&#x27;t thought of&quot; and a pathological fear of dirt, and Number None, who never materializes but is responsible for everyday annoyances, like bumping into doors that are ajar.
* The Scissormen, a race of alien beings from the dimension of Orqwith that attack non-fictional beings in the &quot;real world&quot; (i.e., the world the Doom Patrol live in) with their large scissor-like hands and cut people out of reality.

In issue #57, it was revealed that the Chief had secretly caused the &quot;accidents&quot; which turned Cliff, Larry Trainor, and Rita Farr into super beings. Chief stated he caused them to gain their powers because of his hatred for them. He felt they were spoiled and narcissistic as well as shallow individuals, and that by turning them into &quot;freaks&quot;, he could improve them as human beings. He further revealed that he lied about not being married to Celsius (the leader of the second Doom Patrol, who Caulder claimed was insane/lying about being married to him) out of anger. He was upset over how the experiments performed on her (like with Elasti-Girl) only gave her super-powers and did not turn her into a freak. When Tempest and Robotman found out his role in &quot;creating&quot; Robotman, Elasti-Girl, and Negative Man, Tempest was killed and Robotman paralyzed. Having been exposed as a villain, Caulder planned to unleash nanobots into the world, hoping to create a catastrophe that would improve humanity, regardless of the carnage it would cause. But Caulder&#x27;s plan was hijacked by the Candlemaker, a violent cosmic horror who is freed by Dorothy in exchange for his resurrection of Tempest (whom Candlemaker re-killed). Candlemaker then decapitated Caulder and sought to use the nanobots to enslave humanity. Dorothy, Crazy Jane, and Robotman (freed by the former two) defeated Candlemaker with help from the new reborn version of Rebis. Rebis briefly left the team to reproduce as part of a cosmic ritual. However, during the battle, Jane was sent flying into a portal and landed in a world without heroes. Forcibly institutionalized for her mental issues in this new world, the final issue of Morrison&#x27;s run had Robotman locate Jane as she was about to kill herself and take her to live with Cliff within the confines of Danny the Street. The cycle aptly ends with the words &quot;There is another world... There is a better world... Well there must be&quot;, from the song &quot;Asleep&quot; by The Smiths.

A four-issue Flex Mentallo mini-series illustrated by Frank Quitely spun out from this run.

===Rachel Pollack&#x27;s &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; (volume 2, part 3)===
Morrison left the book with issue #63, and Rachel Pollack took over writing the book the next issue. Pollack&#x27;s first issue was also the first under the new Vertigo imprint of DC Comics (although the trade paperback editions of Morrison&#x27;s work do bear the imprint, the original issues did not). Returning characters for Rachel Pollack&#x27;s run included Cliff Steele, Niles Caulder (kept alive by the nanobots, but reduced to a disembodied head, usually kept on a tray filled with ice), and Dorothy Spinner. Pollack&#x27;s run had Dorothy as a primary member of the Patrol; she brought her imaginary friends to her aid in combat. Overall, Pollack&#x27;s run dealt with issues such as the generation gap, humanity, identity, transgender issues, bisexuality, and borrowed elements from Judaism and Kabbalah in the last few issues. The angel Akatriel is used as a major character in the last seven issues.

The first story arc of her run was called &quot;Sliding in the Wreckage&quot;. Cliff&#x27;s computer brain started to malfunction, and he regressed into flashbacks from previous storylines. Dorothy was haunted by African spirits while dealing with living alone in the real world. The Chief was given a new body by Will Magnus, but to atone for his sins, Caulder ripped his head off the body and was kept in cryogenic storage. Meanwhile, the entire Earth had been suffering from random outbreaks of weirdness, contributed by the arrival of something called &quot;The Book of Ice&quot;. A government agency known as the Builders, similar to the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E., were trying to stop the outbreak, which was apparently linked to a race of shapeshifters known as the Teiresias. As the Chief was kept in a cryogenic state, he appeared in the land of the Teiresias as a face carved in a mountain. They warned him that his arrival in this world was causing the craziness in the real world. Throughout the storyline, little people with backward letters for heads had been seen altering people. These people were apparently older version of nanomachines, referred to as &quot;nannos&quot;. At the Doom Patrol headquarters, Builder agents attacked, and in the craziness, two of the Teiresias approached Dorothy with a new brain for Cliff, but to insert it she needed the Chief&#x27;s expertise. In the Teiresias world, nannos &quot;repaired&quot; the Chief so he could live as a severed head. After his awakening, the craziness seemed to stop, and Dorothy, Cliff, and the Chief each realized that they needed to be together.

The team relocated to Violet Valley&#x27;s Rainbow Estates, a house haunted by ghosts of those who died in sexual accidents. There, three new members joined: The Bandage People, George and Marion, who were once two workers for the Builders but managed to escape, and the Inner Child, a manifestation of the ghosts&#x27; purity and innocence. Another later newcomer of the team was Kate Godwin, aka Coagula, one of the first transgender superheroes. A one-time ally of the team called the Identity Addict, who could become different superheroes by shedding her skin like a lizard, integrated herself back into the team while using the False Memory identity to change the team&#x27;s memories until she was kicked out by Dorothy.

Villains that the team fought, besides the Builders, included the Fox and the Crow, two animal spirits whose feud Dorothy and Cliff were subsequently pulled into; the Master Cleaner, a being with a human fetus inside a bubble for a head who began &quot;cleaning&quot; the world by stripping it down to nothing and replacing the stolen items, including people, with a paper ticket; and a group of Hassidic healers who called themselves the False Healers and their leader, the Rabbi of Darkness.

Toward the end of the series, Cliff Steele&#x27;s brain became entirely robotic, until Dorothy Spinner used her imaginary friends to &quot;repair&quot; it. The Chief would later die after trying to enter the Sephirot or Tree of Life.

A new artist, Ted McKeever, took over the artwork for most of the final 13 issues. Pollack continued writing the title until its cancellation with issue #87, in February 1995.

===John Arcudi&#x27;s Doom Patrol (volume 3)===
In December 2001, writer John Arcudi and artist Tan Eng Huat launched a new &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; series. This relaunch was not under the Vertigo imprint and returned the title to the mainstream DC universe. The series lasted for 22 issues before it was cancelled.

Arcudi&#x27;s run largely ignored Morrison and Pollack&#x27;s runs at first; Arcudi stated in interviews at the time, that the disconnect with the Vertigo run was due to DC editorial having an agreement in play banning writers from using characters and concepts from his run; most notably Rebis/Negative Man and Crazy Jane. However, due to negative fan response to the run; Arcudi was allowed to make reference to the Vertigo series to explain what had happened to the characters from the Pollack run.

The run featured two Doom Patrols: a corporate run Doom Patrol employed by Thayer Jost for Jost Enterprises featuring existing DC characters (Metamophoro, Elongated Man, the second Doctor Light and Beast Boy) and a second &quot;underground&quot; Doom Patrol, run by Robotman and featuring new characters: Fast Forward who could look 60 seconds into the future, Kid Slick who could become entirely frictionless, Fever who could set herself alight, and Freak who possessed mysterious powers from a parasitic entity in her soul. The later Doom Patrol were the main characters of the run, with the Jost owned group disbanding when it is revealed by Metamorpho that Robotman had reportedly died four years earlier which results in the &#x27;imposter&#x27; Robotman in the team to vanish into nothingness.

The Doom Patrol later rebuild the real Robotman once they recover his head and come to an agreement that Thayer Jost will fund the group so long as Jost has the distributing rights to the Doom Patrol which he uses to create a Doom Patrol TV series based on the Silver Age Team. Over the course of the run Fast Forward loses control of his powers when he tries to look beyond 60 seconds into the future and has to suppress them with medicine to function while Kid Slick and Fever start a relationship with one another despite the latter accidentally hospitalising the former with her powers. It is later revealed that part of Robotman&#x27;s agreement with Jost involves Jost funding for Dorothy Spinner&#x27;s healthcare as she has been in a coma for the last four years, Cliff deduces that the &#x27;imposter&#x27; Robotman was an imaginary Cliff that Dorothy had subconsciously manifested.

Visiting Dorothy, Cliff regained his lost memories about how Dorothy became comatose. Deciding to end the Doom Patrol, Coagula and Cliff took Dorothy to Kentucky to meet her previously unknown birth mother to offer Dorothy a chance at a more &#x27;normal&#x27; life, but fearing that Coagula and Cliff were abandoning her, Dorothy had an explosive psychic outburst that reportedly killed Coagula and Cliff, and left her comatose. After finding out that Dorothy was permanently brain dead, Cliff gave the doctors permission to turn off her life support. The death of Dorothy ended Robotman&#x27;s contract with Jost resulting in Fast Forward, Fever, Kid Slick and Freak being evicted and striking out together with royalty money that Jost gave them from his Doom Patrol TV series, while Cliff set off into the world once again alone.

Arcudi&#x27;s characters have made few subsequent appearances, mainly constituting cameos.

===John Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; (volume 4)===
In August 2004, DC launched a new &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; series after the new team debuted in &quot;JLA&quot;. John Byrne wrote and illustrated this series, with inks by Doug Hazlewood. Touted as &quot;Together again for the first time!&quot;, Byrne rebooted the series, eliminating all previous Doom Patrol continuity.

The series debuted as part of a six-part storyline that ran in &quot;JLA&quot; #94–99 as &quot;The Tenth Circle&quot;, though Byrne only drew this arc as it was written by Chris Claremont. This team introduced several new members such as Ava, Grunt, Nudge, and Vortex alongside the 1960s heroes.

This reboot was both controversial and short-lived. Besides the removal of the popular Morrison run (and its characters) from canon and the butterfly effect it had on the Teen Titans (which did its best to limit references to Beast Boy&#x27;s past and avoided using the Brotherhood of Evil until the Byrne run was canceled and Geoff Johns could restore the previous lore), the series garnered controversy over a scene where Robotman and Elasti-Girl are sent back in time and inhabit their younger selves&#x27; bodies. During their time in the past, Robotman declares his love for Elasti-Girl. However, due to an age gap between the two heroes, Rita is trapped in her twelve-year-old self&#x27;s body when the adult Cliff reveals his romantic feelings and kisses her. DC canceled Byrne&#x27;s series with issue #18.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and &quot;One Year Later&quot;===
DC editorial used the events of the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline to restore the Doom Patrol&#x27;s continuity. In escaping from the paradise dimension they had inhabited since the end of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Superboy-Prime and Alex Luthor created temporal ripples which spread throughout reality, causing overlaps on parallel timelines of certain events (Hypertime), such as restoring Jason Todd to life.

In the reprinted edition of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, additional scenes added to the collection showed Fever, Kid Slick, Ava, Nudge, Grunt, and Vortex among a two-page spread of heroes.

While assisting the Teen Titans in battling Superboy-Prime, members of the Doom Patrol had flashbacks to their original history. Robotman and Niles Caulder regained memories of the previous Doom Patrol teams with which they had worked. This battle apparently undid some of Superboy-Prime&#x27;s timeline changes and resulted in a timeline incorporating all previous incarnations of the Doom Patrol, but with Rita Farr and Larry Trainor still alive. The Chief confirmed that Rita was indeed killed by Zahl&#x27;s explosion. The Chief claimed that he later found her skull and treated it with synthetic proteins until her malleable body was regrown from it.

Steve Dayton is again using the Mento helmet and he is mentally unstable; however, he remembers his time as the villainous Crime Lord. The Chief appears to be manipulating the Doom Patrol members once again; he claims to wish to return them to normal so &quot;maybe one day [they] won&#x27;t be freaks anymore&quot;. After the Doom Patrol encounters the Titans, the Chief tells them that Kid Devil should be a member of the Doom Patrol instead of the Titans, since his unique appearance and nature will always separate him from others. However, Beast Boy, Elasti-Girl, and Mento all stand up to the Chief and force him to step down as the Doom Patrol&#x27;s leader, with Mento taking over that role.

Two former members of the Teen Titans were dramatically altered during the course of the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. Mal Duncan, now code-named Vox, and his wife (Bumblebee) now reside in the Doom Patrol&#x27;s castle headquarters.

The Doom Patrol later appear in &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot; series (2007), with Caulder back in charge. According to &quot;Titans&quot; (vol. 2) #1, Beast Boy has recently become the team leader.

In &quot;DC Universe: Decisions&quot;, Robotman has a supporting role while Mento appears in issue #4.

===Keith Giffen&#x27;s &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; (volume 5)===
On February 7, 2009, it was announced at the New York Comic Con that Keith Giffen would be spearheading a revival of Doom Patrol, a title which he has long said he wanted to write. He was joined by artist Matt Clark, who has also long expressed a desire to work on the team. The new series focused on the core members Elasti-Girl, Negative Man, Robotman, and the Chief, while other members such as Mento, Bumblebee, and Vox were to be seen later. The title launched with a 10-page ongoing Metal Men co-feature written by J. M. DeMatteis.

In the first issue, Rita takes on the alias &quot;Elasti-Woman&quot;, and according to the team shrink, she&#x27;s &quot;mothering&quot; Bumblebee, who&#x27;s now eight inches tall after being shrunk to the size of a bee in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;.

Nudge, Byrne&#x27;s addition to the team, was killed in the line of duty and Grunt took off with her corpse.

The current team is working out of Oolong Island (from &quot;52&quot;), which has been turned into a resort town while still maintaining a large super-science background. The Challengers of the Unknown&#x27;s Rocky Davis is also working closely with the team for spiritual support.

Former member Crazy Jane appears in issue #7. Danny the Street, in a reduced aspect, appears in issue #8.

Ambush Bug joined the team at the end of issue #9.

The series was canceled, due to a decrease in sales, with issue #22 in May 2011.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, the Doom Patrol is briefly mentioned in issue #24 of Justice League. The team is depicted to be identical in appearance to Paul Kupperberg&#x27;s 1977 Doom Patrol, consisting of members Celsius, Joshua Clay, and Negative Woman, with additional members Karma and Scott Fischer.

During the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, Valentina Vostok, Karma, and Scott are killed during a confrontation with Johnny Quick and Atomica of the Crime Syndicate, while Celsius and Joshua Clay are presumably killed. Upon learning of his team&#x27;s demise, Doctor Niles Caulder sets about assembling a new Doom Patrol.

Following the defeat of the Crime Syndicate, the newly created Doom Patrol is introduced in issue #30 of Justice League. The team includes Robotman, Elasti-Girl, Negative Man and M.I.A. Justice League member Element Woman, whom Caulder refuses to let leave the group and tricks into thinking she was abandoned by the Justice League.

The team attempt to capture Jessica Cruz, the new Power Ring, to force her to join the team. During their attempt to capture her, Caulder demands the team refuse to save civilians in a collapsing building to allow him to lobotomize Cruz and force her to serve him. The Justice League save the people in the building and Lex Luthor manages to hold Caulder back so Batman can convince Cruz to go with the League instead. During their fight, Luthor reveals that Caulder (as he did in the Morrison run) was responsible for causing the &quot;accidents&quot; that gave the Doom Patrol their powers and that both Celsius and Joshua Clay used the chaos of the events of &quot;Forever Evil&quot; to fake their deaths and escape from Caulder. It is also revealed that Caulder poisoned an entire fishing village as part of an experiment, and cured the residents only after Luthor discovered the truth and threatened to expose him.

===Gerard Way&#x27;s &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; (volume 6)===
A new Doom Patrol series written by Gerard Way and drawn by Nick Derington was created as part of the Young Animal imprint. The first issue was published on September 14, 2016. The series has created a multitude of original characters as well as some taken from former team rosters.

Casey Brinke, a fictional character that Danny The Street created to communicate with people through comic books, was contacted by Danny when he became threatened by a group of aliens known as Vectra. They wished to profit from his power to create life by turning his fictional people into cheap meat at a fast food restaurant. Danny reached out to Casey, hoping that she could find and join the Doom Patrol after explaining her origin story, both the fictional origin story he had created for her and how she had become a real person.

Casey agreed to help. She piloted Danny, currently taking the form of an ambulance, into his attackers&#x27; headquarters, discovering that the leader of the organization was none other than her fictional father Torminox, accidentally brought to life when Vectra had tortured Danny. Alongside Torminox was an evil version of Casey, known as Doodle Bug. She was also created when Danny was tortured and reflects his concern regarding how Casey would become in the real world. Despite the family drama, Casey and the Doom Patrol defeated Vectra and freed Danny from Vectra&#x27;s clutches.

Afterward, the team sets out to find Crazy Jane, who was running a cult under the influence of her current dominant ego Dr. Harrison. Harrison wished to purge the 63 other personalities within Jane&#x27;s mind by distributing them among the mind-controlled cult members using a gene bomb. After the process, she would kill them all. Jane and the team managed to stop this plan and save the cult members while also killing the Dr. Harrison personality within Jane.

The team is contacted by Niles Caulder in a later issue and embark on a mission with him leading. The mission goes haywire and it is revealed that Niles Caulder is gambling again, leading the team to evict him as a leader and as a member of the team. This marks the team embracing being a new iteration of the Doom Patrol.

Other characters introduced in Way&#x27;s run included Terry None, Casey&#x27;s roommate, eventually revealed to be Mr. Nobody&#x27;s daughter; Lotion, originally Casey&#x27;s cat but given humanoid form (with a cat head) by Terry; and the Reynolds family (paramedic Sam, his wife Valerie, and their magic-wielding son Lucius). This series ran 12 issues.

First published in July 2019, &quot;Doom Patrol: Weight of the Worlds&quot; retained the oversight of Gerard Way&#x27;s Young Animal imprint, and directly continued from the ending of Volume 6. The series saw the return of Elasti-Girl and Mento to the team and a brief appearance of Beast Boy. The plot primarily concerned Cliff Steele acquiring a new robot body that was ever upgrading to the point that he became an entire planet in an attempt to protect the universe from hurt, motivated by his mother disowning him and the loss of Dorothy Spinner.
Cliff was eventually persuaded to stop by Crazy Jane who helped to deconstruct him into an infantile form.
The series was cancelled in October 2019 and came to a conclusion with its seventh issue in July 2020.

===&quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;===
Following the cancellation of their series, Robotman, Elasti-Girl, and Negative Man were reintroduced to the main DC continuity, alongside Niles Caulder, in issue #1 of &quot;Batman/Superman: World&#x27;s Finest&quot;. The team helped the titular superheroes defeat Metallo and later performed surgery on Superman to cure him of red kryptonite poisoning.

===&quot;Unstoppable Doom Patrol&quot; (volume 7)===
The seven-issue &quot;Unstoppable Doom Patrol&quot; series by writer Dennis Culver, artist Chris Burnham, and colorist Brian Reber launched March 28, 2023. It portrayed the Doom Patrol with a new mission: saving, protecting and training metahumans. The series had a primary team consisting of Robotman, Negative Man, Elasti-Woman, and led by a new personality of Crazy Jane calling herself &quot;The Chief&quot;. New team members included Degenerate (who gained strength from negative emotions) and Beast Girl (who could encourage or discourage &quot;primal instincts&quot; in others). Supporting cast included Niles Caulder (no longer leading the team, but advising), Mento, Willoughby Kipling, Lotion, Lucius Reynolds, Flex Mentallo, and new members including Psylosimon (who had fungus-based superpowers) and Starbro (a metahuman who merged with a spore from Starro the Conqueror). This team was pursued by US government forces led by Peacemaker and fought a new version of the Brotherhood of Evil, led by General Immortus, who sought to gain the power of the Candlemaker.

==Enemies==

The Doom Patrol faces a diverse array of foes. General Immortus, an immortal military mastermind, leads a cultish criminal syndicate, while The Brain, a disembodied genius, commands the Brotherhood of Evil. Madame Rouge, a French instructor with an elastic body and the ability to shapeshift, often impersonates others to carry out her deadly missions. General Zahl, a former Nazi U-boat captain, masterminds the apparent destruction of the Doom Patrol, frequently partnering with Madame Rouge. Monsieur Mallah, a gorilla transformed into a genius by The Brain’s experiments, is another formidable member of the Brotherhood. Mr. Nobody, once a criminal named Mr. Morden, becomes a shadowy, insane figure after a transformation that allows him to drain sanity, leading the chaotic Brotherhood of Dada. Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man, a scientist named Dr. Sven Larsen, gains the ability to change his form into anything organic or mineral after a lab accident. Garguax, a massive alien invader with advanced technology, and his army of Plastic Men threaten Earth with their overwhelming power. Shrapnel, a former bomber turned human weapon, gains the ability to launch explosive metal projectiles after a lab accident.

The area of Fuso was mostly part of Owari Domain under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. After the Meiji restoration, the villages of Yamana and Toyokuni were established within Niwa District, Aichi in 1872 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Fusō Village was established on October 1, 1906 through the merger of Yamana and Toyokuni with a portion of neighboring Takao and Kashiwamori. Fusō was raised to town status on August 1, 1952.

==Economy==
During the pre-modern period, the area was noted for sericulture and the production of mulberry leaves. Agriculture, notably the growing of daikon radishes, is a mainstay of the local economy.

==Education==
Fusō has four public elementary schools and two public junior high schools operated by the town government, and one public high school operated by the Aichi Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private high school.

<text>The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF or Alaska) is a public land-, sea-, and space-grant research university in College, Alaska, United States, a suburb of Fairbanks. It is the flagship campus of the University of Alaska system. UAF was established in 1917 and opened for classes in 1922. Originally named the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines, it became the University of Alaska in 1935. Fairbanks-based programs became the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 1975.

UAF is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity.&quot; In addition to the Fairbanks Troth Yeddha&#x27; campus, UAF encompasses six rural and urban campuses: Bristol Bay Campus in Dillingham; Chukchi Campus in Kotzebue; the Fairbanks-based Interior Alaska Campus, which serves the state&#x27;s rural Interior; Kuskokwim Campus in Bethel; Northwest Campus in Nome; and the UAF Community and Technical College, with headquarters in downtown Fairbanks. UAF is also the home of UAF eCampus, which offers fully online programs.

In fall 2017, UAF enrolled 8,720 students. Of those students, 58% were female and 41% were male; 87.8% were undergraduates, and 12.2% were graduate students. As of May 2018, 1,352 students had graduated during the immediately preceding summer, fall, and spring semesters.

==History==
===Founding===

The University of Alaska Fairbanks was established in 1917 as the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines, but its origins lie in the creation of a federal agricultural experiment station in Fairbanks in 1906. The station set the tone for the strongly research-oriented university that developed later.

In the spring of 1915, the U.S. Congress approved legislation that reserved about 2,250 acres of land for a campus around the research station. It also allowed the federal government to give the college land that had been surveyed and unclaimed in the Tanana Valley; the proceeds from the sale and development were supposed to help fund the operation of the college. However, because most of the land in Tanana Valley remained unsurveyed for years, the college only received 12,000 acres. In 1929, Congress attempted to remedy the situation by granting the college an additional 100,000 acres anywhere in Alaska, but those rights were extinguished in 1959 when Alaska became a state.

Four months after Congress approved the legislation for the campus land in 1915, a cornerstone for the college was laid by Territorial Delegate James Wickersham on a bluff overlooking the lower Chena River valley. The ridge, which the indigenous Athabaskan people called Troth Yeddha&#x27;, soon became known as College Hill. Charles E. Bunnell was appointed the university&#x27;s chief executive and served the university for 28 years. Classes began at the new institution on September 18, 1922. It offered 16 different courses to a student body of six (at a ratio of one faculty member per student) on opening day. In 1923, the first commencement produced one graduate, John Sexton Shanly.

In 1935, the Alaska Legislature passed a bill that officially changed the name of the college to the University of Alaska. When William R. Wood became the university&#x27;s president in 1960, he divided the academic departments of the university into six select colleges: Arts and Letters; Behavioral Sciences and Education; Biological Sciences and Renewable Resources; Business, Economics, and Government; Earth Sciences and Mineral Industry; and Mathematics, Physical Sciences, and Engineering. From that point on, both the university&#x27;s student population and research mission grew tremendously. With the appointment of Chancellor Howard A. Cutler in 1975, the University of Alaska became the University of Alaska Fairbanks. It was, and still is, the primary research unit of the statewide university system.

The two other primary UA institutions are the University of Alaska Anchorage and the University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau.

===Significant events===
The Alaska Constitutional Convention was held in the freshly constructed Student Union Building on the Fairbanks campus from November 1955 to February 1956. While the convention progressed, the building became known as Constitution Hall, where the 55 delegates drafted the legal foundation of the 49th state. The campus&#x27; old library and gymnasium was renamed Signers&#x27; Hall after the Alaska Constitution was signed there in February 1956.

==Academics==
===Schools and colleges===
UAF has nine academic schools and colleges: 
*College of Engineering and Mines (CEM)
*College of Liberal Arts (CLA)
*College of Natural Science and Mathematics (CNSM)
*College of Rural and Community Development (CRCD)
*Graduate School
*School of Education
*College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (CFOS)
*College of Business and Security Management (CBSM)
*School of Natural Resources and Extension (SNRE)

There are 190 different degree and certificate programs available in more than 120 disciplines.

===Honors College===
The UAF Honors College was created in 1983 and provides additional opportunities for students to prepare for professional school admission. Students complete core curriculum courses for their degrees in the Honors Program, maintain at least a 3.25 grade-point average in all courses, and complete a thesis project.

=== Libraries ===
*Elmer E. Rasmuson Library
**The Alaska Film Archives, housed in the library&#x27;s Alaska and Polar Regions Collections and Archives, holds the largest collection of film-related material about Alaska.
**BioSciences Library (permanently closed as of June 2014)
*Keith B. Mather Library (housed in the International Arctic Research Center)

=== Research units ===
UAF is Alaska&#x27;s primary research university, conducting more than 90% of UA system research. Research activities are organized into several institutes and centers, some of which are listed:
*the Geophysical Institute, established in 1946 by an act of Congress, specializes in seismology, volcanology and aeronomy, among other fields.
*the Research Computing Systems unit, located within the Geophysical Institute, is the high-performance computing unit of UAF.
*the International Arctic Research Center researches the circumpolar North and the causes and effects of climate change.
*the Institute of Northern Engineering, an arm of the College of Engineering and Mines, conducts research in many different areas of engineering.
*the Alaska Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station conducts research focused on solving problems related to agriculture and forest sciences.
*the Institute of Arctic Biology conducts research focused on high-latitude biological systems.
*the Robert G. White Large Animal Research Station conducts long-term research with muskoxen, reindeer and cattle.
*the Institute of Marine Science, a branch of the College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences, investigates topics in oceanography, marine biology, and fisheries.
*the research vessel Sikuliaq, a 261-foot ice-resistant ship outfitted with modern scientific equipment, is operated by the College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences for the National Science Foundation.

==Student life==

===Housing===
UAF has several student residence halls on both lower and middle Fairbanks campus. Housing is offered year-round. All halls are smoke-free, as is the entire campus. Each hall has a kitchen, laundry facility, exterior door hall access system and maintenance services. The halls vary from each other slightly to suit different preferences of the student population. Additional housing locations on campus are available to graduates, families, employees and nontraditional students.

===Representation===
The Associated Students of the University of Alaska Fairbanks (ASUAF) is the representative group for students attending UAF.

Fairbanks, CTC, and eCampus student pay $53 per credit in Consolidated Fees, students at rural campuses pay $21 per credit; ASUAF receives 2.2% of Consolidated Fee revenue.

ASUAF holds general elections each semester. As per the ASUAF Constitution, there is a president, a vice president and no more than 16 senators, all of whom must be in good academic standing (2.0+ CGPA). Senators, the president and the vice president have terms of one full academic year.

== Athletics ==
University of Alaska Fairbanks sports teams are the Alaska Nanooks, with the word Nanook derived from the Inupiaq word for &quot;polar bear.&quot; Though often known as UAF within the state, the university prefers to be called simply &quot;Alaska&quot; for athletics purposes. The school colors are blue and gold.

The Alaska Nanooks compete at the NCAA Division I level in hockey as an Independent. The Nanooks play home games at the 4,500-seat Carlson Center, located in downtown Fairbanks. The Alaska Nanooks also have a Division II rifle team which has won 11 NCAA National Rifle Championships (1994, 1999–2004, 2006–2008, 2023). The rifle team is a member of the Patriot Rifle Conference. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, cross country running, and women&#x27;s volleyball teams are Division II members of the Great Northwest Athletic Conference, while the women&#x27;s swim team is a member of the Pacific Collegiate Swimming Conference (PCSC), and the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Nordic skiing teams are members of the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association (RMISA). The men&#x27;s basketball team, women&#x27;s basketball team, and women&#x27;s volleyball team play home games in the 1,622-seat Patty Center. Due to its isolation from the Lower 48 and the lack of a dome to protect against the harsh elements, Alaska does not have a football program, as is true for all three branches of the University of Alaska.

Since the UAF athletics program was operating at a financial deficit, a new student fee was initiated in 2008. This fee charges UAF students $10 per credit hour they are enrolled in, up to a maximum of $120 per semester. The fee grants students free admission to select UAF athletic events.

In fiscal year 2010, the department was able to meet financial obligations without additional year-end funding for the first time.

The department has increased scholarships for women by 95% since 2005, and was recognized by &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; for Title IX compliance in an article titled &quot;Turnaround Stories.&quot;

== Publishing ==
There are several book publishers at UAF, including the University of Alaska Press, the Alaska Native Language Center, Alaska Sea Grant, the University of Alaska Museum of the North, UAF Cooperative Extension Service, and the Alaska Native Knowledge Network. The University of Alaska Foundation also publishes books.

Serial publications include: 
*&quot;Aurora&quot;, produced once annually by UAF University Relations
*&quot;Agroborealis&quot;, produced twice annually by the School of Natural Resources and Extension
*&quot;Ice Box&quot;, the UAF student literary magazine
*&quot;Permafrost&quot;, the UAF English Department&#x27;s literary journal
*&quot;The Alumnus&quot;, the UAF Alumni Association newsletter, published twice annually

The student newspaper is titled &quot;The Sun Star,&quot; formed after the merger of &quot;The Polar Star&quot;, an independent student paper, and &quot;The Northern Sun&quot;, the journalism department&#x27;s student newspaper.

== Arts ==
The Fine Arts Complex hosts the Charles Davis Concert Hall, the Lee H. Salisbury Theatre and the Eva McGown Music Room. The building is also home to the UAF Art Gallery, which is used for student art shows, thesis shows and faculty shows.

The Reichardt Building was completed in 1994 is a three-story 117,435-square-foot steel-frame structure that features an extensive artwork collection.

<doc id="601503" wikidata="Q436648" url="?curid=601503" title="Richey Edwards">
<text>Richard James Edwards (22 December 1967 – disappeared 1 February 1995, declared dead 24 November 2008), also known as Richey James or Richey Manic, was a Welsh musician who was the lyricist and rhythm guitarist of the alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. He was known for his dark, politicized and intellectual songwriting which, combined with an enigmatic and eloquent character, has assured him cult status. Edwards has been cited as a leading lyricist of his generation.

Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995. On 24 November 2008, he was legally declared dead &quot;on or since&quot; 1 February 1995. The ninth Manic Street Preachers album, &quot;Journal for Plague Lovers&quot;, released on 18 May 2009, is composed entirely of songs with lyrics left by Edwards. the remaining members of Manic Street Preachers were still paying 25% royalties into an account in his name.

==Early life==
Richard James Edwards was born and raised in Blackwood, Caerphilly, Wales, to Graham and Sherry Edwards. He had one younger sister, Rachel (born 1969), with whom he was close:

Edwards attended Oakdale Comprehensive School, where he met future bandmates Nicky Wire, Sean Moore and James Dean Bradfield. From 1986 to 1989, he attended University of Wales, Swansea, and graduated with a 2:1 degree in political history.

==Career==
Edwards was initially a driver and roadie for Manic Street Preachers. He was accepted as the band&#x27;s main spokesman and fourth member in 1989. Edwards showed little musical talent; his real contribution to the band was in their lyrics and design. He frequently mimed playing the guitar during early live performances and accordingly only played on two songs during the band&#x27;s studio career, but was, along with bassist Nicky Wire, their principal lyricist. Edwards is said to have written approximately 80% of the lyrics on their third album, &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;. Both are credited on all songs written before Edwards&#x27; disappearance, with Edwards receiving sole credit on three tracks from the 1996 album &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;, and co-writing credits on another two.

Edwards expressed a desire to create a concept album described as &quot;Pantera meets Nine Inch Nails meets &quot;Screamadelica&quot;&quot;. Bradfield, the band&#x27;s lead guitarist and vocalist, later expressed doubt over whether the Manic Street Preachers would have produced such an album: &quot;I was worried that as chief tune-smith in the band I wasn&#x27;t actually going to be able to write things that he would have liked. There would have been an impasse in the band for the first time born out of taste.&quot;

Edwards suffered from severe depression, and was open about it in interviews. He self-harmed, mainly through stubbing cigarettes on his arms and cutting himself: &quot;When I cut myself I feel so much better. All the little things that might have been annoying me suddenly seem so trivial because I&#x27;m concentrating on the pain. I&#x27;m not a person who can scream and shout so this is my only outlet. It&#x27;s all done very logically.&quot; On 15 May 1991, after a gig at the Norwich Arts Centre, &quot;NME&quot; journalist Steve Lamacq questioned how serious Edwards was about his art; Edwards responded by carving the words &quot;4 Real&quot; into his forearm with a razor blade. The injury required eighteen stitches.

Edwards also suffered from insomnia, and used alcohol to help himself sleep at night. Before the release of &quot;The Holy Bible&quot; in 1994, he checked into Whitchurch Hospital and later the Priory hospital, missing out on some of the promotional work for the album and forcing the band to appear as a three piece at the Reading Festival and T in the Park. Following his release from the Priory in September, Manic Street Preachers toured Europe with Suede and Therapy? for what would be the last time. Edwards&#x27; final live appearance was at the London Astoria, on 21 December 1994. The concert ended with the band smashing their equipment and damaging the lighting system, prompted by Edwards&#x27; violent destruction of his guitar towards the end of set closer &quot;You Love Us&quot;. On 23 January 1995, Edwards gave his last interview to Japanese music magazine &quot;Music Life&quot;.

==Disappearance and presumed death==
Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995, on the day when he and Bradfield were due to fly to the United States on a promotional tour of &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;. In the two weeks before his disappearance, Edwards withdrew £200 a day from his bank account, which totaled £2,800 by the day of the scheduled flight (equivalent to £7,321 in March 2024). It is unknown if he intended to spend the cash during the U.S. tour or whether a part of it was to pay for a desk he had ordered from a shop in Cardiff. There is no record of the desk being purchased, which would only have explained half the money withdrawn.

According to Emma Forrest, as quoted in &quot;A Version of Reason&quot;, &quot;The night before he disappeared Edwards gave a friend a book called &quot;Novel with Cocaine&quot;, instructing her to read the introduction, which details the author staying in a mental asylum before vanishing.&quot; Whilst staying at the Embassy Hotel in Bayswater Road, London, according to Rob Jovanovic&#x27;s biography, Edwards removed some books and videos from his bag. Among them was a copy of the play &quot;Equus&quot;. Edwards placed them in a box with a note that said, &quot;I love you&quot;, wrapped the box like a birthday present and decorated it with collages and literary quotations, including a picture of a Germanic-looking house and Bugs Bunny. The package was addressed to Edwards&#x27; on/off girlfriend, Jo, whom he met some years prior, although they had split a few weeks earlier.

Edwards&#x27; sister Rachel, contributing to an article about Edwards&#x27; final lyrics by Guy Mankowski, proposed that Sylvia Plath&#x27;s poem &quot;Tulips&quot; &quot;summed up everything he [Edwards] thought at the time he went.&quot; She added, &quot;Why do I know this? Because he told me, he kept a copy of it, and he asked for it to be read at his funeral.&quot; Rachel Edwards said, &quot;[H]is thoughts must have been dominated by this poem—the themes and messages.&quot; The poem is generally considered to depict the tension between the speaker&#x27;s desire for the simplicity of death and the tulip&#x27;s encouragement towards life.

The next morning, Edwards collected his wallet, car keys, some Prozac and his passport. He reportedly checked out of the Embassy Hotel at 7:00 a.m., leaving his toiletries, packed suitcase and some of his Prozac. He then drove to his flat in Cardiff, leaving behind his passport, his Prozac and a Severn Bridge tollbooth receipt. In the two weeks that followed, Edwards was apparently spotted in the Newport passport office and at Newport bus station by a fan who was unaware that he was missing. The fan was reported to have discussed a mutual friend, Lori Fidler, before Edwards departed.

This timeline was turned on its head in 2018, due to the original assumption made over the toll booth receipt found from the Severn Bridge. It had been assumed that &#x27;2:55&#x27; on the ticket was 2:55 PM, but in 2018 the original software engineer at the bridge was located and he confirmed the software printed out the 24-hour clock, meaning Edwards passed this location at 2:55 a.m. Therefore, the timeline of events and subsequent appeals for information were no longer valid.

On 7 February, a taxi driver from Newport supposedly picked up Edwards from the King&#x27;s Hotel and drove him around the valleys, including Edwards&#x27; hometown of Blackwood. The driver reported that the passenger had spoken in a Cockney accent, which occasionally slipped into a Welsh one, and that he had asked if he could lie down on the back seat. Eventually they reached Blackwood and its bus station, but the passenger reportedly said, &quot;This is not the place,&quot; and asked to be taken to Pontypool railway station. It was later ascertained, according to Jovanovic&#x27;s account, that Pontypool did not have a telephone. The passenger got out at the Severn View service station near Aust, South Gloucestershire, and paid the £68 fare in cash.

On 14 February, Edwards&#x27; Vauxhall Cavalier received a parking ticket at the Severn View service station, and on 17 February, the vehicle was reported as abandoned. Police discovered the battery to be dead, with evidence that the car had been lived in. The car also had photos Edwards had taken of his family days prior. Due to the service station&#x27;s proximity to the Severn Bridge, a known suicide site, it was widely believed that Edwards had jumped from the bridge. Edwards had referred to suicide in 1994, saying, &quot;In terms of the &#x27;S&#x27; word, that does not enter my mind. And it never has done, in terms of an attempt. Because I am stronger than that. I might be a weak person, but I can take pain.&quot;

Since then, Edwards has reportedly been spotted in a market in Goa, India, and on the islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. There have been other alleged sightings, especially in the years immediately following Edwards&#x27; disappearance. However, none of these has proved conclusive, and none has been confirmed by investigators.

The investigation into Edwards&#x27; disappearance has received criticism. In his 1999 book &quot;Everything (A Book About Manic Street Preachers)&quot;, Simon Price states that aspects of the investigation were &quot;far from satisfactory&quot;. He asserts police may not have taken Edwards&#x27; mental state into account when prioritizing his disappearance, and also records Edwards&#x27; sister as having &quot;hit out at police handling&quot; after CCTV footage was analyzed two years after Edwards had vanished. Price records a member of the investigation team as stating &quot;that the idea that you could identify somebody from that is arrant nonsense.&quot; While Edwards&#x27; family had the option of declaring him legally dead from 2002 onwards, they chose not to for many years, and his status remained open as a missing person until 23 November 2008, when he became officially &quot;presumed dead&quot;.

===Legacy===
Edwards&#x27; disappearance attracted a great deal of media attention.

On 8 April 1995, an issue of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was released in conjunction with the Samaritans regarding depression, self-harm and suicide. The magazine had received a number of letters from fans distressed at both the anniversary of the death of Kurt Cobain and the disappearance of Edwards. The 8 April edition saw &quot;Melody Maker&quot; assemble a panel of readers to discuss the issues related to both cases. Then-editor Allan Jones placed the inspiration for the special nature of the issue firmly in the hands of the readers: &quot;Every week the mailbag is just full of these letters. Richey&#x27;s predicament seems to be emblematic of what a lot of people are going through.&quot; Jones saw the debate as focusing on the notion of whether &quot;our rock stars are more vulnerable these days, and is that vulnerability a reflection of the vulnerability of their audience? And if so, why?&quot;

On 21 April, Caitlin Moran, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, commented that Edwards became &quot;a cause celebre among depressives, alcoholics, anorexics, and self-mutilators, because he was the first person in the public eye to talk openly about these subjects, not with swaggering bravado and a subtext of &#x27;look how tortured and cool I am&#x27;, but with humility, sense and, often, bleak humour&quot;. Moran dismissed the mainstream media&#x27;s narrative, which was geared towards the idea that Edwards inspired copycat actions in fans. With regard to the 8 April edition of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Moran wrote of her distaste of the media treatment in general: &quot;Arms were flung aloft and tongues tutted two weeks back, when the first anniversary of Kurt Cobain&#x27;s suicide coincided with the two-month marking of ... Richey Edwards&#x27; disappearance, and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; instigated a debate on escalating teenage depression, self-mutilation and suicide.&quot; Nevertheless, Moran said &quot;Cobain&#x27;s actions and, to a greater extent, Richey Edwards&#x27;s actions, have legitimised debate on these subjects&quot;.

== Literature and other cultural influences ==
As well as an interest in music, Edwards displayed a love for literature. He chose many of the quotes that appear on Manics record sleeves and would often refer to writers and poets during interviews. This interest in literature has remained integral to the band&#x27;s music and lyrics. Albert Camus, Philip Larkin, Yukio Mishima, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Arthur Rimbaud are known to have been among his favorite authors. In a dressing room interview, he also mentioned admiration for Primo Levi. Edwards&#x27; lyrics have often been of a highly poetic nature and at times they reflected his knowledge of political history.

==Books about Edwards==
In 2009, Rob Jovanovic&#x27;s book &quot;A Version of Reason: The Search for Richey Edwards of the Manic Street Preachers&quot; was published. The book was written with the goal of providing an authoritative factual account, pieced together through testimonials from those close to Edwards before his disappearance. A novel by Ben Myers, entitled &quot;&quot;, was published on 1 October 2010 through Picador. &quot;Richard&quot; purports to be a fictionalized account of Edwards&#x27; life &quot;as he might have told it.&quot; A 2015 novel by Guy Mankowski, entitled &quot;How I Left The National Grid&quot;, was heavily informed by Edwards and his disappearance. Howard Marks has also written a book about Edwards, &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, although his name has been changed to fictionalize the story.

In 2019, Sara Hawys Roberts and Leon Noakes published &quot;Withdrawn Traces: Searching for the Truth About Richey Manic&quot;, a book that claimed to provide fresh evidence that Edwards staged the disappearance. The book was published with consent from Edwards&#x27; sister, Rachel Edwards, who also wrote the foreword.

==History==


Chita District was one of the ancient districts of Owari Province and is mentioned in Nara period records. One of the castles that guarded the area was Ōno Castle.

Modern Chita District dates to the cadastral reforms of the early Meiji period, and was initially given to Nukata Prefecture in former Mikawa Province, whereas the holdings of former Owari Domain became &quot;Nagoya Prefecture&quot;. With the creation of Aichi Prefecture, Chita District again came to be considered part of former Owari Province.

===District Timeline===
With the organization of municipalities on October 1, 1889, Chita District was divided into four towns (Handa, Kamezaki, Yokosuka, Ono) and 63 villages. In December 1890, Narawa and Tokoname were also elevated to town status, followed by Taketoyo in February 1891, Arimatsu in September 1892 and Utsumi in November 1893. Otaka and Morozaki became towns in September 1894, followed by Kyōwa and Otaka in May 1903 and Toyohama in February 1905. The number of remaining villages was consolidated from 52 to 14 in 1906, leaving the district with 14 towns and 14 villages.

Nishiura became a town in December 1911, followed by Obu in November 1915 and Yawata in March 1922. Handa was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1937, merging with the towns of Kamezaki and Narawa. The village of Ueno became a town in February 1940, followed by Noma in July 1942. This left Chita District with 16 towns and nine villages at the end of World War II.

In June 1946, the village of Higashiura was elevated to town status. In October 1951, the village of Onizaki became a town, followed by Asahi in April 1952, Kosugaya in July 1952, Agui in January 1953. On April 1, 1954 the city of Tokoname was established by the merger of the towns of Tokoname, Ōno, Onizaki and Nishiura and the village of Sanwa.

On April 1, 1955 Kyōwa and Noma towns merged to form the town of Mihama. On the same day, the towns of Yawata, Okada and Asahi merged to form the town of Chita. Kosugaya Town was dissolved on March 31, 1957, with portions joining neighboring Tokoname and Mihama. On June 1, 1961, the towns of Utsumi, Toyohama, and Morozaki merged to form Minamichita. In December 1964, the towns of Arimatsu and Otaka were annexed by Nagoya, becoming part of Midori-ku. On April 1, 1969, the city of Tōkai was established by the merger of the towns of Ueno and Yokosuka.

On September 1, 1970 the towns of Obu and Chita were both elevated to city status, leaving the district with 5 towns.

==History==


Hazu District was one of the ancient districts of Mikawa Province, and was mentioned in Heian period &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; records under a variety of &quot;kanji&quot; spellings. Bordering on Mikawa Bay, one of its noted products was sharkskin and dried shark meat, which was sent as taxes to the Imperial household in Kyoto.

===District Timeline===
Modern Hazu District was created on 1 October 1889 as part of the cadastral reforms of the early Meiji period. Initially, it consisted of the town of Nishio and 36 villages. On 13 May 1892, the villages Isshiki and Yokosuka were elevated to town status. However, both reverted back to village status in 1906, and in a round of consolidation, the remaining number of villages was reduced to 14. Isshiki regained its town status on 1 October 1923, followed by Yoshida and Hirasaku in 1924, Hazu in 1928, and Terazu in 1929, leaving the district with 6 towns and 6 villages by 1932.

On 15 December 1953, Nishio was elevated to city status, annexing the towns of Hirasaku and Terazu and two villages later that year. On 10 March 1955, Yoshida and the village of Yokosuka were merged to form the town of Kira, leaving the district with three towns and no villages.

===2011 merger===
* On 1 April 2011 - The towns of Hazu, Isshiki and Kira were merged into the expanded city of Nishio. Therefore, Hazu District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

==History==


Nukata is one of the ancient counties of western Mikawa Province. During the Sengoku period, most of the area of the district was controlled by the Matsudaira clan. In the Edo period, under the Tokugawa shogunate, large portions were administered by the feudal domains of Okazaki Domain, Okutono Domain and Nishi-Ohira Domain. After the Meiji Restoration, the area became the short-lived &quot;Nukata Prefecture&quot;, which was then merged into Aichi Prefecture.

===District Timeline===
In the cadastral reforms of the early Meiji period, on October 1, 1889, Nukata District was divided into one town (Okazaki) and 26 villages. The village of Fukuoka was raised to town status on November 8, 1893, followed by Hirohata village on May 13, 1895. In a round of consolidation in May 1906, the remaining number of villages was reduced from 24 to 15. The town of Hirohata was annexed by Okazaki on October 1, 1914. Okazaki attained city status on July 1, 1916. The village of Iwazu became a town on September 1, 1928 and later the same year, three neighboring villages were annexed by Okazaki, leaving the district with two towns and 11villages.

Following World War II, on April 1, 1952 the village of Kōta gained town status. On August 1, 1954 the village of Toyosaka (from Hazu District) was merged into the town of Kōta.

The towns of Iwazu and Fukuoka, and the villages of Motojuku, Yamanaka, Fujikawa, Ryudani and Tokiwa were merged into the city of Okazaki on February 1, 1955; and on September 30, 1956, the villages of Toyotomi, Miyazaki, Katano, and parts of Shimoyama were merged to form the town of Nukata.

Despite pressure from the central government, on November 14, 2003 Kōta declined to participate the Okazaki-Nukata Region Merger Conference. As a result of this Conference, on January 1, 2006 Nukata merged into the city of Okazaki, leaving Kōta as the only remaining portion of Nukata District.

===Recent mergers===
* On January 1, 2006 - The town of Nukata was merged into the expanded city of Okazaki.

As of December 1, 2004, the village had an estimated population of 4,353 and a population density of 58.4 persons per km2. Its total area was 74.54 km2. Obara was well known as the home of traditional Japanese &quot;Washi&quot; mulberry paper.

Obara Village was created on July 1, 1906, through the merger of the hamlets of Kiyohara, Honjo, Fukuhara and Toyohara. On July 13, 1972, the village was partly destroyed by landslides following heavy rains, with the loss of 32 lives.

On April 1, 2005, Obara, along with the town of Fujioka (also from Nishikamo District), the towns of Asuke, Asahi and Inabu, and the village of Shimoyama (all from Higashikamo District), was merged into the expanded city of Toyota, and has ceased to exist as an independent municipality.

Obara is the only place in Japan where 10,000 rare &quot;shikizakura&quot; (四季桜, &quot;four-seasons-cherry blossom&quot;) cherry trees grow, which bloom twice a year in spring and autumn. These trees are said to have originated in the early 1800s when the samurai physician Fujimoto Genseki was presented with one of those trees from a temple in Nagoya.

;Notes:
==History==


Kamo District (加茂郡) was one of the ancient districts of Shinano Province, but was transferred to Mikawa Province during the Sengoku period. In the cadastral reforms of the early Meiji period, on July 22, 1878, Kamo District was divided into Nishikamo District and Higashikamo District within Aichi Prefecture. With the organization of municipalities on October 1, 1889, Nishikamo District was divided into 30 villages.

===District Timeline===
The village of Koromo was elevated to town status on January 29, 1892. In a round of consolidation, the remaining number of villages was reduced from 29 to seven in 1906. On March 1, 1951, Koromo gained city status and on April 1, 1953, the village of Sanage gained town status, merging with two neighboring villages on March 1, 1955. The village of Takahashi was annexed by Komoro in 1956. On April 1, 1958, the village of Miyoshi gained town status; however, on April 1, 1967, the town of Sange was merged into the city of Toyota. The village of Fujioka gained town status on April 1, 1978, leaving the district with two towns and one village. On August 5, 2003, Miyoshi rejected plans to merge with the city of Toyota.

===Recent mergers===
* On April 1, 2005 - The town of Fujioka, and the village of Obara, along with the towns of Asahi, Asuke and Inabu, and the village of Shimoyama (all from Higashikamo District), were merged into the expanded city of Toyota.
* On January 4, 2010 - The town of Miyoshi was elevated to city status. Therefore, Nishikamo District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

;Notes:
==History==


Kamo District (加茂郡) was one of the ancient districts of Shinano Province, but was transferred to Mikawa Province during the Sengoku period. In the cadastral reforms of the early Meiji period, on July 22, 1878, Kamo District was divided into Higashikamo District and Nishikamo District within Aichi Prefecture. With the organization of municipalities on October 1, 1889, Higashikamo District was divided into 18 villages.

===District Timeline===
* The village of Asuke was elevated to town status on December 17, 1890, and two new villages were created in 1889 and 1890. In a round of consolidation, the remaining number of villages was reduced from 19 to six in 1906.
* On April 1, 1955, three of the remaining villages (Morioka, Kamo, and Aro) were annexed by the town of Asuke; however, a new village (Asahi) was created through a border adjustment with parts of the village of Sanno (formerly from Ena District, Gifu Prefecture).
* On November 1, 1961, the village of Matsudaira gained town status, followed by the village of Asahi.
* On April 1, 1967, the town of Matsudaira was annexed by the city of Koromo.

===Recent mergers===
* On October 1, 2003 - The town of Inabu was transferred from Kitashitara District to Higashikamo District, leaving the district with two towns and one village.
* On April 1, 2005 - The towns of Asuke, Asahi and Inabu, and the village of Shimoyama, along with the town of Fujioka, and the village of Obara (both from Nishikamo District), were all merged into the expanded city of Toyota. Therefore, Higashikamo District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

<text>was a village located in Kitashitara District, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.

As of May 1, 2004, the village had an estimated population of 218 and a density of 6.3 persons per km2. Its total area was 34.78 km2.

==Geography==

The completion of the Sakuma Dam in 1955 flooded much of the arable land in the village, forcing the resettlement of most of the inhabitants, and leaving Tomiyama with the distinction of being the least populous village in Japan (aside from some isolated islets).

On November 27, 2005, Tomiyama was merged into expanded the village of Toyone and has ceased to exist as an independent municipality.

<text>was a town located in Minamishitara District, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.

As of May 1, 2004, the town had an estimated population of 13,565 and a density of 51.45 persons per km2. Its total area was 263.66 km2.

==Geography==
Hōrai was located in east-central of Aichi Prefecture. Some 90 percent of the village area was covered in mountains and forest, and most was within the borders of the Aichi Kōgen Quasi-National Park

==History==

Hōraiji village was created in the early Meiji period cadastral reform on 1878, but has existed since at least the Muromachi period as a monzen machi to the mountain cult temple of Hōrai-ji.

On April 1, 1956, Hōraiji and Nagashino villages merged with Nanago village and Ono Town from Yana District to form the town of Hōrai. They were joined by Ebi Town from Minamishitara District and Yamayoshida Village from Yana District on September 30 of the same year.

On October 1, 2005, Hōrai, along with the village of Tsukude (also from Minamishitara District), was merged into the expanded city of Shinshiro and has ceased to exist as an independent municipality.

==Recreation==
Mount Horai, Aichi is a climbing area located just north of Shinshiro.
It is an area with both bouldering and hard sport climbing, up to 5.14d, on steep volcanic rock.

&quot;Byaku-dou&quot; (V15) and &quot;Epitaph&quot; (V15) are well known boulder problems opened by Dai Koyamada.

Climbers are not allowed to leave quick-draws hanging from the routes overnight. According to the priests in charge of the many shrines on Mount Horai, this would greatly upset the numerous spirits that visit the forest.

==History==


Hoi District was one of the ancient districts of Mikawa Province, and is mentioned in Nara period records. Originally covering all of eastern Mikawa, Shitara District to the north was separated from Hoi in 903. The district contained the provincial capital of Mikawa along with the provincial temple, both of which were located in what is now part of the city of Toyokawa. During the Sengoku period, the area was controlled by various samurai clans, including the Makino and branches of the Honda and Matsudaira clans, all of whom rose to high positions within the Tokugawa shogunate. The area was also a battlefield between the forces of the Imagawa clan and the Oda and Tokugawa clans during the late Sengoku period.

===District Timeline===
In the cadastral reforms of the early Meiji period, on July 22, 1878 modern Hoi District was created, with its headquarters at Goyu-shuku, a former station on the Tōkaidō. With the organization of municipalities on October 1, 1889, Hoi District was divided into 33 villages.

The villages of Gamagōri and Uchikubo were elevated to town status on October 6, 1891. They were followed in rapid succession by the village of Shimoji (October 16, 1891), the village of Goyu (January 29, 1892), the village of Toyokawa (March 13, 1893), the villages of Akasaka and Kō (June 23, 1894), and the village of Miya (December 10, 1894). In a round of consolidation, the remaining number of villages was reduced from 25 to 11 in 1906. The district office was transferred to the town of Kō in 1923. The village of Katahara was raised to town status on April 1, 1924, the village of Kosakai on September 12, 1926, and the village of Mito on February 11, 1930. On September 1, 1932, the town of Shimoji was annexed by the neighboring city of Toyohashi. The city of Toyokawa was formed on June 1, 1943 by the merger of the towns of Toyokawa, Ushikubo and Kō, and the village of Yawata. The village of Nishiura was raised to town status on February 11, 1944.

On April 1, 1954, the city was Gamagōri was formed by the merger of the towns of Gamagōri and Miya, and the village of Shiotsu. In a further round of consolidations in 1955, the town of Otowa was formed on April 1, 1955 and the structure of the district became six towns and one village. On April 1, 1959, the town of Goyu was annexed by the city of Toyokawa. The village of Ichinomiya was raised to town status on April 1, 1961. The towns of Katahara and Nishiura were annexed by the city of Gamagōri on April 1, 1962 and April 1, 1963 respectively. In a final round of mergers, the town of Ichinomiya was annexed by the city of Toyokawa on February 1, 2006, followed by the towns of Otowa and Mito on January 15, 2008. When the town of Kozakai was merged into Toyokawa on February 1, 2010, Hoi ceased to exist as an administrative division.

===Recent mergers===
* On February 1, 2006 - The town of Ichinomiya (a.k.a. Mikawaichinomiya) was merged into the expanded city of Toyokawa.
* On January 15, 2008 - The towns of Otowa and Mito were merged into the expanded city of Toyokawa.
* On February 1, 2010 - The town of Kozakai was merged into the expanded city of Toyokawa. Therefore, Hoi District dissolved as a result of this merger.

<text>was a district located in southern Aichi Prefecture, Japan, located on the Atsumi Peninsula in Mikawa Bay.

As a result of various consolidations and mergers of municipalities, the district was incorporated into the cities of Toyohashi and Tahara in 2005.

As of 2004 (the last data available before its dissolution), the district had an estimated population of 21,657 with a density of 263.5 persons per km2. Its total area was 82.18 km2.

==Municipalities==
Prior to its dissolution, the district consisted of only one town:

* Atsumi

;Notes:
==History==


Atsumi-gun is one of the ancient counties of southern Mikawa Province and is mentioned in Nara period records. Due to its geographic proximity to Ise Province, during the Nara and Heian period, large portions of its lands were managed as &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by Ise Shrine or under the direct control of the Imperial family. During the Muromachi period, the Isshiki clan rose to prominence, but after the Ōnin War were displaced by the Toda clan, who built Tahara Castle. However, in the Sengoku period, the Doi were challenged by the rising power of the Makino clan and Matsudaira clan to the north, and the Imagawa clan to the east. In the Edo period, under the Tokugawa shogunate, most of the district was administered by the feudal domains of Tahara Domain, Yoshida Domain and Hatagamura Domain. After the Meiji Restoration, the area was merged into Aichi Prefecture.

===District Timeline===
In the cadastral reforms of the early Meiji period, on October 1, 1889, Atsumi District was divided into the town of Toyohashi and 32 villages (35 villages by 1891 due to reorganization). The village of Tahara was raised to town status on October 3, 1892, followed by the village of Okawa on June 23, 1893, and the village of Fukue on February 22, 1897. In a round of consolidation in May 1906, the town of Fukagawa was created, and the remaining number of villages was reduced from 33 to 10. Toyohashi was also raised to city status on August 1, 1906. Toyohashi annexed two neighboring villages in 1932, leaving the district with three towns and eight villages.

After World War II, in another round of consolidation in 1955, the town of Futagawa was merged into the city of Toyohashi; and the town of Atsumi was created. With the elevation of the village of Akabane to town status on November 1, 1958, the district was left with only three towns.

===Recent mergers===
* On August 20, 2003 - The town of Tahara absorbed the town of Akabane to form the city of Tahara.
* On October 1, 2005 - The town of Atsumi was merged into the expanded city of Tahara. Therefore, Atsumi District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

<doc id="601557" wikidata="Q193697" url="?curid=601557" title="Sugababes">
<text>The Sugababes are an English girl group composed of Mutya Buena, Keisha Buchanan, and Siobhán Donaghy. The lineup changed three times before returning to the original lineup in 2011.

Formed in 1998 by Ron Tom, the manager of All Saints, Sugababes released their debut album, &quot;One Touch,&quot; through London Records in November 2000. It achieved moderate success and produced the top-ten single &quot;Overload&quot;. In 2001, Donaghy was replaced by Heidi Range. With Range, Sugababes released three multi-platinum albums: &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (2002), &quot;Three&quot; (2003), and &quot;Taller in More Ways&quot; (2005). In December 2005, Buena was replaced by Amelle Berrabah. Following the release of their , the Sugababes released the albums &quot;Change&quot; (2007) and &quot;Catfights and Spotlights&quot; (2008).

In 2009, after 11 years in Sugababes, Buchanan, the final original member, was replaced by Jade Ewen. Sugababes released &quot;Sweet 7&quot; (2010), after which they signed to RCA Records, before taking an indefinite hiatus in 2011. That year, the original lineup re-formed as &quot;Mutya Keisha Siobhán&quot; and released the single &quot;Flatline&quot;. The trio regained the name Sugababes in 2019, and in 2021, the Sugababes rereleased &quot;One Touch&quot; for its 20th anniversary. In 2022, they released &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot;, an album of previously unreleased material.

Sugababes have achieved six number-one singles in the UK: &quot;Freak like Me&quot;, &quot;Round Round&quot;, &quot;Hole in the Head&quot;, &quot;Push the Button&quot;, &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, and &quot;About You Now&quot;. The Spice Girls are the only British girl group to have had more. They have also released five UK top-ten albums, four of which were certified platinum in the UK, and have been nominated for six Brit Awards, winning for Best British Dance Act in 2003. They have been a long-term fixture in the British tabloids due to their lineup changes and reports of alleged infighting.

==History==
===1998–2001: &quot;One Touch&quot; and Donaghy&#x27;s departure ===
Sugababes were formed in 1998 by All Saints manager Ron Tom and Sarah Stennett, and First Access Entertainment. Siobhán Donaghy and Mutya Buena, both aged just 13, had been signed as solo artists, but decided to work together after performing at the same showcase. While working in the studio, Buena invited her best friend Keisha Buchanan to watch them. Manager Ron Tom decided the three girls were to be a trio, likening their different appearances to the United Colors of Benetton campaign. Originally dubbed &quot;the Sugababies&quot;, the group&#x27;s name was tweaked to &quot;Sugababes&quot; when they were signed by London Records to give the group a more mature image.

The group&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Overload&quot;, peaked at number 6 on the UK Singles Chart in 2000 and was nominated for a BRIT Award for Best Single. The group co-wrote most of the tracks on debut album &quot;One Touch&quot; with the help of All Saints producer Cameron McVey. &quot;One Touch&quot; peaked at number 26 on the UK Albums Chart. The album produced three more top 40 hits—&quot;New Year&quot;, &quot;Run for Cover&quot; and &quot;Soul Sound&quot;. The sales of &quot;One Touch&quot; did not meet London Records&#x27; expectations, and they dropped the group in 2001. It was later certified Gold by the BPI and had sold 220,000 copies in the UK by 2008 according to &quot;Music Week&quot;.

During a Japanese promotional tour in August 2001, Donaghy left the group. She stated initially that she wanted to pursue a fashion career, but was eventually diagnosed with clinical depression amid reports of in-fighting amongst the group&#x27;s members. Donaghy later stated that she was forced out of the group by Buchanan and called Buchanan the &quot;first bully&quot; in her life. Former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range replaced Donaghy.

===2002–2004: &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; and &quot;Three&quot;===
Having already started work on a second album with new member Range, the trio looked for a new record label, eventually signing to Island Records. Their first single on the new label, &quot;Freak like Me&quot; scored the group their first UK number 1 single. Follow-up single &quot;Round Round&quot; also debuted on top of the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number 2 in Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand. Both singles were certified silver by the BPI. On the back of the success of the singles, the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;, debuted at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart and was later certified triple Platinum, selling almost a million copies in the UK alone. It is to date their highest-selling album. In the UK, the third single from the album, a ballad titled &quot;Stronger&quot;, gained the girls their third consecutive top ten hit in their native country. The track was released as a double-A side with &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; in the UK, the latter song chosen as the theme tune to &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;. A fourth single, the Sting-sampling &quot;Shape&quot;, made the top ten in the Netherlands and Ireland in early 2003.
The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Three&quot;, was released in late 2003 and reached number 3 on the UK Albums Chart, earning the group a BRIT Award nomination for Best Album. Certified double Platinum, it has sold 855,000 copies to date. The album was preceded by lead single &quot;Hole in the Head&quot;, which became the group&#x27;s third UK number 1 single. It also reached number 2 in Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway, and became the Sugababes&#x27; first (and to date only) single to chart in the United States, reaching number 96 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Follow-up single &quot;Too Lost in You&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Love Actually&quot; and went top ten in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;In the Middle&quot;, was released in 2004 and garnered the group another BRIT Award nomination for Best Single; like its successor, the ballad &quot;Caught in a Moment&quot;, it went to number 8 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2004, the trio sang on the Band Aid 20 remake of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, which went to number 1 in the UK in December.

Around this time, the group&#x27;s perceived &quot;moodiness&quot;, alleged backstage catfights, and press junket tantrums were tabloid fodder in Britain. They were surrounded by continuous rumours of in-fighting within the group and constant split reports. Rumours suggested that Buchanan and Buena had bullied Range, although Range herself repeatedly denied such allegations; Buena later admitted that she did not speak to Range when she first joined. According to Buchanan, there was only one serious fallout between herself and Range during a 2004 gig in Dublin, a disagreement around Britney Spears&#x27;s song &quot;Toxic&quot;.

===2005–2006: &quot;Taller in More Ways&quot;, Buena&#x27;s departure, and compilation===
After a hiatus, during which Buena gave birth to her daughter Thalia, the Sugababes released their thirteenth single, &quot;Push the Button&quot; in October 2005. The song debuted at number 1 in the UK and remained in the position for three consecutive weeks. It also peaked at number one in Ireland, Austria and New Zealand, and reached the top three across Europe and in Australia. Certified silver in the UK, it was later nominated at the BRIT Awards for Best Single. Parent album &quot;Taller in More Ways&quot; became the group&#x27;s first UK number 1 album. The group was number 1 on the singles, album, airplay and download charts simultaneously, making them the first girl group to achieve such a feat. &quot;Taller in More Ways&quot; was certified double Platinum in the UK.

Following an illness that prevented her from promoting follow-up single &quot;Ugly&quot;, Buena left the Sugababes on 21 December 2005. Buena later stated that she was suffering from postnatal depression after the birth of her daughter combined with the group&#x27;s increasingly hectic schedules, and chose to leave to spend more time with her daughter. Amelle Berrabah joined the Sugababes in late December 2005, having been chosen by the group&#x27;s management as a replacement. Prior to Buena&#x27;s departure, the group recorded the track &quot;Spiral&quot; from the William Orbit album, &quot;Hello Waveforms&quot;, which was released in February 2006.

The third single from &quot;Taller in More Ways&quot; was a re-recorded version of &quot;Red Dress&quot;, which was released in early 2006, and gave the Sugababes their third consecutive top five hit from the album, entering the UK Singles Chart at number 4. Berrabah re-recorded three of the album&#x27;s twelve tracks and co-wrote a new song with Buchanan and Range named &quot;Now You&#x27;re Gone&quot;. The tracks appeared on a re-release of &quot;Taller in More Ways&quot; that reached number 18 on the UK Albums Chart. The fourth and final single from &quot;Taller in More Ways&quot; was &quot;Follow Me Home&quot;, released only in the UK in June, where it charted at number 32.

In mid-2006, the group returned to the studio to record two new tracks for their first greatest hits collection, titled &quot;&quot;. The lead single from the compilation, &quot;Easy&quot; peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst the compilation album, released in November 2006, peaked at number 3. The album, certified Platinum by the BPI, has sold 598,000 copies. During this time, the group had also announced that they had begun work on their then-untitled fifth studio album.

===2007–2008: &quot;Change&quot; and &quot;Catfights and Spotlights&quot;===
In March 2007, the Sugababes collaborated with fellow British girl group Girls Aloud for their eighteenth single, a cover of the song &quot;Walk This Way&quot; by Aerosmith. The track was released as the official single for &quot;Comic Relief&quot;. &quot;Walk This Way&quot; became the group&#x27;s fifth UK number one single.
Following their Greatest Hits Tour, the Sugababes returned to the recording studio in mid-2007 to continue working on &quot;Change&quot;, their fifth studio album, and the first to feature Berrabah on all tracks. &quot;About You Now&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single in September 2007. Upon release, the song became the group&#x27;s sixth UK number one hit and first Hungarian chart-topper. It remained atop the UK Singles Chart for four weeks. &quot;About You Now&quot; was nominated for a 2008 BRIT Award for Best British Single and is to date their highest-selling single, with sales standing at almost 500,000 copies. In the 2009 edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, &quot;About You Now&quot; was listed as the &quot;first track by a British pop act to top the singles chart solely on downloads&quot;. The song was also named as the &quot;biggest chart mover to the number one position in the UK&quot;.

In October 2007, &quot;Change&quot; became the group&#x27;s second UK number 1 album. For the second time, the group topped the singles, album and download charts simultaneously. The album&#x27;s title track &quot;Change&quot;, was released as the second single in December 2007 and peaked at number 13 in the UK. The album sold 494,000 copies in the UK, and was certified Platinum. The third and final single from &quot;Change&quot; was &quot;Denial&quot;, which reached number 15. From March to May 2008, the Sugababes travelled the UK on the thirty-date Change Tour, their biggest tour to date.

Following the Change Tour, Sugababes returned to the studio to write and record tracks for their sixth studio album, &quot;Catfights and Spotlights&quot;. It was reported that producer Timbaland had approached the Sugababes to work on their sixth album, but due to time restrictions, a collaboration did not occur. &quot;Girls&quot;, the lead single from &quot;Catfights and Spotlights&quot; was released in October 2008. The single peaked at number 3 in the UK, making it their first lead single since &quot;One Touch&quot; not to reach number 1. The album peaked at number 8 in the UK Albums Chart. Its second and final single, &quot;No Can Do&quot;, was released in December and peaked at number 23 in the UK. The Performing Right Society named Sugababes the fourth-hardest-working band of 2008 due to the number of concerts they had performed during that year.

===2009–2010: Buchanan&#x27;s departure and &quot;Sweet 7&quot;===
After the release of &quot;No Can Do&quot;, the group decided not to go on tour in 2009 and instead focus on writing and recording material for their seventh studio album. The Sugababes travelled to the United States to work on their seventh studio album, &quot;Sweet 7&quot;. In April 2009, the Sugababes signed a contract with Jay-Z&#x27;s label Roc Nation, resulting in working with high profile producers. Berrabah also collaborated with Tinchy Stryder for the track &quot;Never Leave You&quot;, the third single from his second album, &quot;Catch 22&quot;, in August 2009. The single debuted on top of the UK charts, making Berrabah the only member of the Sugababes, past and present, to achieve a number one single outside of the group. The lead single from &quot;Sweet 7&quot;, &quot;Get Sexy&quot;, debuted at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in September 2009. In September 2009, Berrabah was reported to have left the Sugababes as she had missed two engagements promoting &quot;Sweet 7&quot;. It was also rumored that Jade Ewen, the UK&#x27;s 2009 Eurovision Song Contest entrant, would be joining the group and replacing Berrabah. On 21 September, it was revealed that Buchanan, the sole remaining original member of the group, had departed from the Sugababes and replaced by Ewen. Buchanan revealed on Twitter that it was not her decision to leave, resulting in some journalists describing her as having been &quot;sacked&quot;.

Critics and fans reacted very negatively to the news, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; published an article titled &quot;Why the Sugababes&#x27; show can&#x27;t go on without Keisha&quot;. Digital Spy ran an article titled &quot;Keisha Buchanan, We Salute You&quot; in which they thanked her for her contribution to &quot;incredible pop songs&quot;. According to Berrabah and Range, both women had wanted to quit the Sugababes themselves and alleged that Buchanan had become too difficult to work with, so their group&#x27;s management decided that they would follow them rather than find two new members for Buchanan. Buchanan stated in 2020 that she did not know that she was ousted from the group until after the public announcement of her departure had already been made.

The new member, Ewen, was flown to the United States to film the music video for single &quot;About a Girl&quot; mere days after Buchanan had left the group. &quot;About a Girl&quot; reached number 8 in the UK, during a truncated promotion schedule due to Berrabah flying to Austria for treatment for nervous exhaustion resulting from the line-up change. In late 2009, &quot;Wear My Kiss&quot; was confirmed for release in February 2010 as the third single, with the album, originally set for a late November 2009 release, delayed until March 2010. &quot;Wear My Kiss&quot; debuted and peaked at number 7 in the UK, making &quot;Sweet 7&quot; the Sugababes&#x27; first album since &quot;Taller in More Ways&quot; to contain at least three top ten hits. The album debuted and peaked at number 14 in the UK but was critically panned due to the loss of an identifiable sound, soul and originality stemming from Buchanan&#x27;s departure.

In March 2010, former group member Mutya Buena applied to the European Trademarks Authority for ownership of the group&#x27;s name. The application was submitted amid the controversy of Buchanan&#x27;s departure, in which Buena insisted that &quot;the Sugababes have ended&quot; without a founding member still in the group. It was confirmed that Buena had obtained rights to use the name on paper, cardboard and goods; namely stationery, paper gift wrap and paper gift wrapping ribbons. In the same month the group was dropped by Roc Nation, due to poor sales of &quot;Sweet 7&quot;.

===2011: Cancelled album and disbandment===

The Sugababes initially began recording an eighth studio album in April 2010. In June 2011, the group and their managers Sarah Stennett and Mark Hargreaves Crown Music Management Services left their record label of ten years, Island Records, for a new three-album distribution deal with Sony Music&#x27;s RCA Records, with Crown Music Management Services as the acting record label. In July, the Sugababes commented on their new album, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s a bit darker, tougher and quite edgy.&quot; In another interview, the group stated the new album showcased their personalities. At the Wireless Festival in London, Buchanan and the current line-up were reported to have had a &quot;teary&quot; reunion and put the past behind them. It was the first time in two years that she had seen Range and Berrabah, as well as the first time she had officially met her &quot;replacement&quot; Jade Ewen. In a later interview, Buchanan said that she was disappointed by the treatment she received back in 2009, but went on to wish the current line-up &quot;the best of luck&quot;.

Their first and only single under the new label, &quot;Freedom&quot;, was released for free on 25 September 2011. Afterward, the group began a hiatus to work on solo projects: Range participated in the seventh series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, Berrabah worked on solo material and Ewen competed as a contestant on the first series of &quot;Splash!&quot;

In March 2013, Ewen stated that the Sugababes would likely reform to record new music by the end of the year; though with no set release date, and in May, Berrabah said the group had been writing songs for their new album and hoped to release new music in 2014. However, later the same year, Ewen stated that they were &quot;pretty much done&quot;. This was initially denied by Berrabah, who stated she believed the band would get back together in late 2014. In September 2013, Ewen reaffirmed that the group had split two years prior, saying &quot;We kind of fizzled out about two years ago. I do think the lineup changes have obviously got to be a factor, you can&#x27;t get away from it.&quot; In January 2014, Range contradicted Ewen&#x27;s statement, saying that the group was merely on hiatus to pursue solo projects. However, she later admitted in a June 2020 interview that the group had conceded in 2011 that it would not be fair for them to continue further due to the controversy and their declining popularity after Buchanan&#x27;s departure.

In March 2019, Berrabah revealed that the Sugababes had been approached several times about reforming for a farewell tour for the fans. In July, in an interview with Irish broadcaster RTÉ, she said that there were discussions about a reunion tour featuring all six members of the group.

===2011–2018: Original lineup re-formation as Mutya Keisha Siobhán===
Buchanan was contacted in June 2010, just nine months after being ousted, about potentially getting back with Buena and Donaghy. In October 2011, several news outlets reported that the original line-up of the Sugababes would reform. both Buena and Buchanan tweeted in January 2012 that they were in the studio with &quot;two other females&quot; and British rapper Professor Green, fuelling further speculation that the group would reunite were sparked. Buena later denied this on Twitter. Despite this, Scottish singer-songwriter Emeli Sandé confirmed to MTV UK that she had written new songs for Buena, Buchanan and Donaghy.

In April 2012, it was reported that the line-up had signed a £1 million record deal with Polydor Records. In July 2012, it was confirmed that the group had reformed under the name Mutya Keisha Siobhán and were working on a new album under Polydor. The name was officially registered through the European Union on 27 June 2012. The group attended the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony on 27 July 2012 and posted pictures on their official Instagram page, marking the trio&#x27;s first public appearance together in eleven years. On 6 August, the group confirmed they had written two songs with Shaznay Lewis, member of the All Saints. The next day, Donaghy tweeted &quot;With the girls in the studio. I think the album is finished!!!&quot; Their return was named the eleventh biggest moment of 2012 in NME&#x27;s &#x27;75 Moments That Defined 2012&#x27; countdown.

The group appeared on the cover of fashion magazine &quot;Ponystep&quot; in December 2012. That same month, they performed an intimate gig at &quot;Ponystep&quot;&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve party. The performance marked the first time Buena, Buchanan and Donaghy had performed together in over a decade. On 7 January 2013, the group uploaded a short a cappella clip of &quot;Boys&quot; on Buchanan&#x27;s YouTube account. The same day, Popjustice released a three-second clip of its studio version. The group signed with Storm Model Management. On 14 March, the group&#x27;s producer Dev Hynes uploaded &quot;Lay Down in Swimming Pools&quot; on his official SoundCloud page, a reinterpretation of Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s &quot;Swimming Pools (Drank)&quot; that features the group. On 26 March, the group featured on a remix of Phoenix&#x27;s single &quot;Entertainment&quot;. The group released the single &quot;Flatline&quot; in June 2013. MKS performed their first official headlining gig at Scala on 1 August. In early October, Mutya Keisha Siobhán appeared on the Google+ Sessions series. On 6 November 2013, Buena said that she was open to reclaiming the Sugababes name. During 8–16 November 2013, the group embarked on the Sacred Three Tour, playing six dates across the UK.

In June 2016, at London Pride&#x27;s WandsworthRadio special, Donaghy said the album was due the following year. In August 2017, Buchanan said in an interview that the group were working on new material after their previous work was leaked online. In June 2018, Donaghy was a guest on Tom Aspaul&#x27;s podcast &quot;Battle Pop&quot; and revealed &quot;We&#x27;re still working together. That&#x27;s really easy to [say] and reassure fans. We&#x27;re kind of stronger than ever.&quot; She added that she had no idea when, or even if, an album would be released.

===2019–present: Reclaiming the Sugababes name and &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot; ===
Buchanan, Buena and Donaghy won back the rights to the group name Sugababes in 2019. Later that year, the group appeared with DJ Spoony on his album &quot;Garage Classical&quot;, covering the 2000 song &quot;Flowers&quot; by Sweet Female Attitude. This marked the group&#x27;s first release under the name Sugababes after eight years of working as Mutya Keisha Siobhán. Their comeback performance took place on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; on 18 October 2019. Following their performance on Graham Norton&#x27;s show, the group revealed that they were working on new music and a special project for the 20th anniversary of &quot;One Touch&quot;; however, plans were put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 11 May 2021, Sugababes released a reworking of 2001 single &quot;Run for Cover&quot; featuring MNEK. The same day they announced an expanded &quot;20 Year Anniversary&quot; edition of &quot;One Touch&quot; that would feature unheard demos and remixes. On 22 June 2021, the Sugababes released a Blood Orange remix to &quot;One Touch&quot; track &quot;Same Old Story&quot;. The album peaked at number 18 on the UK Albums Chart, outperforming the original peak of 26.

Sugababes headlined the second day of June 2022&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Hoopla&quot; festival in Herne Hill, London. On 20 May 2022 it was announced the band would be supporting Westlife on their Dublin leg. They made a number of further appearances at music festivals over the summer, including Glastonbury, Portsmouth&#x27;s Victorious Festival and the Margate Pride Festival. On 3 June 2022, the 2013 Mutya Keisha Siobhan single, &quot;Flatline&quot;, was re-released under the Sugababes name. Sugababes announced their 17-date headlining tour, their first in 9 years, on 23 June 2022, starting on 16 October 2022 in Bristol and concluding on 7 November 2022 in Glasgow.

On 24 December 2022, Sugababes surprise-released the album &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot; online. The album was originally recorded in 2013 but never received an official release. In a statement online the group stated: &quot;We wrote this album almost 8 years ago and for various reasons it didn&#x27;t get an official release, so it&#x27;s with great pride that &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot; is available now on all streaming platforms&quot;. The album was released independently. &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot; debuted at number 2 on the UK Album Downloads Chart Top 100.

On 15 September 2023, Sugababes released the single &quot;When the Rain Comes&quot;. The song was the first single to be released by the band&#x27;s new record label BMG. The same day, the Sugababes performed at the O2 for their One Night Only concert. In December 2023, the group featured on the Joy Anonymous remix &quot;Push the Button&quot;, titled &quot;JOY (Push the Button)&quot;. The band appeared on &quot;Jools&#x27; Annual Hootenanny&quot; on 31 December 2023. Sugababes were awarded the &quot;Impact Award&quot; at the 26th MOBO Awards, and continued to appear at various events and festivals throughout 2024, including Parklife, Capital&#x27;s Summertime Ball, Glastonbury Festival for which they appeared on the West Holts stage, as well as TRNSMT, Rock Oyster, Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival, Kendal Calling, Siren Bristol, Victorious Festival and Lowlands in the Netherlands.

The district name is very ancient, and is mentioned in the &quot;Engishiki&quot; records. Kamo District was one of the original districts of Izu Province, having been separated from Suruga Province along with Tagata District in the cadastral reform of 680 AD.

Modern Kamo District was established in the July 22, 1878 cadastral reforms initiated by the Meiji government with one town (Shimoda) and 119 villages.

In a round of consolidation on April 1, 1889, this was reduced to 1 town and 26 villages. On June 1, 1891, Atami was raised to town status. However, on April 4, 1896, the area of the district was reduced by the transfer of Atami and nine villages to Tagata District.

On September 1, 1958 Kawazu was elevated to town status. This was followed by the establishment of Higashiizu on May 3, 1959. Shimoda gained city status on January 1, 1971
On April 1, 2005 - Kamo Village, the one remaining village in the district, merged with the town of Nishiizu

<text>was a village located in Tagata District, Shizuoka, Japan on the Suruga Bay coast of Izu Peninsula. Views of Mount Fuji can be seen from the village, which is a tourist resort.

As of March 1, 2005, the village had an estimated population of 3,681 and a density of 105.4 persons per km2. The total area was 34.92 km2.

On April 1, 2005, Heda was merged into the expanded city of Numazu.

On December 23, 1854, &quot;Diana&quot;, the flagship of the Russian fleet bearing Admiral Yevfimy Putyatin and his delegation for the negotiation of the Treaty of Shimoda was struck by a tsunami from the Ansei Tōkai earthquake and sank. The survivors stayed in Heda, where they cooperated with Japanese carpenters and shipbuilders to construct a new vessel (christened &quot;Heda&quot;) to take them back to Russia. This marked the first cooperative venture between Japanese and Europeans since the start of the national seclusion policy at the start of the Edo period.

In the April 1, 1889 cadastral reform of Meiji period Japan, Heda was organized as Heda Village.

Heda is known for the Japanese spider crab called &quot;takaashi-gani&quot; in Japanese which can grow up to 4 metres in length. Smaller versions of &quot;takaashi-gani&quot; (about 1 metre) are available in several restaurants and hotels around the village.

==History==

Tagata District was one of the original districts of Izu Province, having been separated from Suruga Province in the cadastral reform of 680 AD, and covered most of central Izu Peninsula.

Modern Tagata District was established in the July 22, 1878 cadastral reforms initiated by the Meiji government with one town (Nirayama) and 61 villages. In a round of consolidation on April 1, 1889, this was reduced to seven villages, with Nirayama reduced to village status. However, on April 4, 1896, the area of the district was greatly expanded by portions of the former Kimisawa District and Kamo District, to have two towns (Mishima and Atami) and 27 villages.

Itō was raised to town status on January 1, 1906. In 1924, Ajiro and Shuzenji were also raised to town status, followed by Izunagaoka in 1936.
Atami was elevated to city status on April 10, 1937. The village of Toi was elevated to town status on April 1, 1938, followed by Ōhito on December 10, 1940. Mishima was elevated to city status on April 29, 1941, and Itō on August 10, 1947.

On September 30, 1956, Shimokarino Village was merged into Shuzenji Town and Seizu Village merged into Toi Town. On April 1, 1957, Ajiro Town was merged into Atami City.

On January 1, 1958 the villages of Shimoomi, Nakaomi, and Kamiomi merged to form the town of Nakaizu, with parts of Kitakarino Village merging separately with Shuzenji Town and Ōhito Town on April 10, 1959.

On November 1, 1960, the villages of Nakakarino and Kamikarino merged to form the town of Amagiyugashima. Nirayama Village was elevated back to town status on April 1, 1962. Kannami Village was elevated to town status on April 1, 1963. 
On April 1, 2004, the towns of Shuzenji, Amagiyugashima, Nakaizu, and Toi merged to form the city of Izu. This was followed by the merger of the towns of Nirayama, Izunagaoka, and Ōhito to form the city of Izunokuni on April 1, 2005.
The village of Heda merged into Numazu City on the same day.</text><links>

<text>was a town located in Ihara District, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.

As of March 1, 2006, the town had an estimated population of 12,777 and a density of 870 persons per km2. The total area was 14.69 km2.

On March 31, 2006, Kanbara was merged into the Shimizu-ku Ward of the expanded city of Shizuoka and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

During the Edo period, Kanbara developed as Kanbara-juku, a post station on the Tōkaidō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. From the Meiji period onward, Kanbara became an industrial town in Shizuoka Prefecture, with aluminum smelters from Nippon Light Metals Company predominating until been closed in 2014. It was the last remaining aluminum smelter in Japan, having survived on cheap hydro-electric power after all other smelters in Japan were closed in 1975-1987 period.

The town was served by Kambara Station on the Tōkaidō Main Line railway and by an interchange on the Tōmei Expressway.

<text>10cc are an English rock band formed in Stockport southeast of Manchester in 1972. The group initially consisted of four musicians, Graham Gouldman, Eric Stewart, Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, who had written and recorded together since 1968. The four members contributed to songwriting, working together in various permutations. Godley and Creme’s songwriting has been said to be inspired by art and cinema. The four members were multi-instrumentalists, singers, writers and producers. Most of the band&#x27;s records were recorded at their own Strawberry Studios (North) in Stockport and Strawberry Studios (South) in Dorking, with most of those engineered by Stewart.

From 1972 to 1978, 10cc had five consecutive UK top-ten albums: &quot;Sheet Music&quot; (1974), &quot;The Original Soundtrack&quot; (1975), &quot;How Dare You!&quot; (1976), &quot;Deceptive Bends&quot; (1977), and &quot;Bloody Tourists&quot; (1978). 10cc also had twelve singles reach the UK Top 40, three of which were the chart-toppers &quot;Rubber Bullets&quot; (1973), &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot; (1975), and &quot;Dreadlock Holiday&quot; (1978). &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot; was their breakthrough worldwide hit, and is known for its innovative backing track. 

In 1976, Godley and Creme quit the band to concentrate on developing an electronic music device, &quot;The Gizmo&quot;, and being in video production and music as Godley &amp; Creme. Stewart left the band in 1995. Since 1999, Gouldman has led a touring version of 10cc.

==First collaborations==
Three of the founding members of 10cc were childhood friends in the Manchester area. As boys, Godley and Creme knew each other; Gouldman and Godley attended the same secondary school, and their musical enthusiasm led to their playing at the local Jewish Lads&#x27; Brigade.

==1964–1969: Early bands==
Their first recorded collaboration was in 1964, when Gouldman&#x27;s band The Whirlwinds recorded the Lol Creme composition &quot;Baby Not Like You&quot;, as the B-side of their only single, &quot;Look At Me&quot;. The Whirlwinds then changed members and name, becoming The Mockingbirds (including singer-guitarist Gouldman, bassist Bernard Basso and drummer Kevin Godley, formerly of The Sabres with Creme). The Mockingbirds recorded five singles in 1965–66 without any success, before dissolving. The guitarist in both The Whirlwinds and The Mockingbirds was Stephen Jacobson, brother of writer Howard Jacobson.

In June 1967, Godley and Creme reunited and recorded a solitary single (&quot;Seeing Things Green&quot; b/w &quot;Easy Life&quot; on UK CBS) under the name &quot;The Yellow Bellow Room Boom&quot;. In 1969, Gouldman took them to a Marmalade Records recording session. The boss of Marmalade Records, Giorgio Gomelsky, was impressed with Godley&#x27;s falsetto voice and offered them a recording contract. In September 1969, Godley &amp; Creme recorded some basic tracks at Strawberry Studios, with Stewart on guitar and Gouldman on bass. The song, &quot;I&#x27;m Beside Myself&quot; b/w &quot;Animal Song&quot;, was released as a single, credited to Frabjoy and Runcible Spoon.

Gomelsky (an ex-manager of The Yardbirds) planned to market Godley &amp; Creme as a duo, in the vein of Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Plans for an album by Frabjoy and Runcible Spoon faltered, however, when Marmalade ran out of funds. Solo tracks by Godley and Gouldman, however–both involved Stewart and Creme–were released on a 1969 Marmalade Records compilation album, &quot;100 Proof&quot;. Gouldman&#x27;s track was &quot;The Late Mr. Late&quot;; a year later, Godley&#x27;s song &quot;To Fly Away&quot; reappeared as &quot;Fly Away&quot;, in the debut Hotlegs album, &quot;&quot;.

Gouldman, meanwhile, had made a name for himself as a hit songwriter, penning &quot;Heart Full of Soul&quot;, &quot;Evil Hearted You&quot; and &quot;For Your Love&quot; for The Yardbirds, &quot;Look Through Any Window,&quot; and &quot;Bus Stop&quot; for The Hollies as well as &quot;No Milk Today&quot;, &quot;East West,&quot; and &quot;Listen People&quot; for Herman&#x27;s Hermits.

==1965–1968: The Mindbenders==
Guitarist Eric Stewart was a member of Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, a group that hit No. 1 with &quot;The Game of Love&quot;, and scored a number of other mid-1960s hits. When Fontana left the band in October 1965, the group became known simply as the Mindbenders, with Stewart as their lead vocalist. The band scored a hit with &quot;A Groovy Kind of Love&quot; (released December 1965) and made an appearance in the 1967 film &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot; with &quot;It&#x27;s Getting Harder All the Time&quot; and &quot;Off and Running&quot;.

In March 1968, Gouldman joined Stewart in the Mindbenders, replacing bassist Bob Lang and playing on some tour dates. Gouldman wrote two of the band&#x27;s last three singles, &quot;Schoolgirl&quot; (released November 1967) and &quot;Uncle Joe the Ice Cream Man&quot; (August 1968). Those singles did not chart, and the Mindbenders broke up after a short tour of England in November.

==1968–1970: Birth of Strawberry Studios; the bubblegum era==
In the dying days of the Mindbenders, Stewart began recording demos of new material at Inner City Studios, a Stockport studio then owned by Peter Tattersall, a former road manager for Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas. In July 1968, Stewart joined Tattersall as a partner in the studio, where he could further hone his skills as a recording engineer. In October 1968, the studio was moved to bigger premises and renamed Strawberry Studios, after the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;.

In 1969, Gouldman also began using Strawberry to record demos of songs he was writing for Marmalade. He had become much more in demand as a songwriter than as a performer. By the end of the year, he too was a financial partner in the studios.

By 1969, all four members of the original 10cc line-up were working together regularly at Strawberry Studios. Around the same time, American bubblegum pop writer-producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz of Super K Productions came to England and commissioned Gouldman to write and produce formulaic bubblegum songs, many of which were recorded at Strawberry Studios, and were either augmented or performed entirely by varying combinations of the future 10cc line-up. Among the recordings from this period was &quot;Sausalito&quot;, a No. 86 US hit credited to Ohio Express and released in July 1969. In fact the song featured Gouldman on lead vocal, and vocal and instrumental backing by the other three future 10cc members.

In December 1969, Kasenetz and Katz agreed to a proposal by Gouldman that he work solely at Strawberry, rather than move constantly between Stockport, London and New York. Gouldman convinced the pair that these throwaway two-minute songs could all be written, performed and produced by him and his three colleagues, Stewart, Godley and Creme, at a fraction of the cost of hiring outside session musicians. Kasenetz and Katz booked the studio for three months.

Godley recalled:We did a lot of tracks in a very short time – it was really like a machine. Twenty tracks in about two weeks – a lot of crap really – really shit. We used to do the voices, everything – it saved &#x27;em money. We even did the female backing vocals.
The three-month project resulted in a number of tracks that appeared under various band names owned by Kasenetz-Katz, including &quot;There Ain&#x27;t No Umbopo&quot; by Crazy Elephant, &quot;When He Comes&quot; by Fighter Squadron and &quot;Come on Plane&quot; by Silver Fleet (all three with lead vocals by Godley), and &quot;Susan&#x27;s Tuba&quot; by Freddie and the Dreamers (which was a hit in France and featured lead vocals by Freddie Garrity, despite claims by some that it was Gouldman). Lol Creme remembered: &quot;Singles kept coming out under strange names that had really been recorded by us. I&#x27;ve no idea how many there were, or what happened to them all.&quot;

But Stewart described the Kasenetz-Katz deal as a breakthrough: &quot;That allowed us to get the extra equipment to turn it into a real studio. To begin with they were interested in Graham&#x27;s songwriting and when they heard that he was involved in a studio I think they thought the most economical thing for them to do would be to book his studio and then put him to work there – but they ended up recording Graham&#x27;s songs and then some of Kevin and Lol&#x27;s songs, and we were all working together.&quot;

==1970–1971: Hotlegs; Doctor Father; The New Wave Band; Festival==
When the three-month production deal with Kasenetz-Katz ended, Gouldman returned to New York to work as a staff songwriter for Super K Productions and the remaining three continued to dabble in the studio.

With Gouldman absent, Godley, Creme and Stewart continued recording singles. The first, &quot;Neanderthal Man&quot;, released under the name Hotlegs, began life as a test of drum layering at the new Strawberry Studios mixing desk, but when released as a single by Fontana Records in July 1970, climbed to No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart and became a worldwide hit, selling more than two million copies. Around the same time, the trio released &quot;Umbopo&quot; under the name of Doctor Father. The song, a slower, longer and more melancholic version of the track earlier released under the name of Crazy Elephant, failed to chart.

Reverting to the successful band name Hotlegs, in early 1971 Godley, Creme and Stewart recorded the album &quot;&quot;, which included &quot;Neanderthal Man&quot;. They then recalled Gouldman for a short tour supporting the Moody Blues, before releasing a follow-up single &quot;Lady Sadie&quot; b/w (Backed With) &quot;The Loser&quot;. Philips Records reworked their sole album, removing &quot;Neanderthal Man&quot; and adding &quot;Today&quot;, and issued it as &quot;Song&quot;. Stewart, Creme and Godley released another single in February 1971 under yet another name, The New Wave Band, this time with former Herman&#x27;s Hermits member Derek &quot;Lek&quot; Leckenby on guitar. The song, a cover version of Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Cecilia&quot;, was one of the few tracks the band released that they had not written. It also failed to chart.

The band also continued outside production work at Strawberry, working with Dave Berry, Wayne Fontana, Peter Cowap and Herman&#x27;s Hermits, and doing original compositions for various UK football (soccer) teams. In 1971 they produced and played on &quot;Space Hymns&quot;, an album by New Age musician Ramases; in 1972–73 they co-produced and played on two Neil Sedaka albums, &quot;Solitaire&quot; and &quot;The Tra-La Days Are Over&quot;. The experience of working on &quot;Solitaire&quot;, which became a success for Sedaka, was enough to prompt the band to seek recognition on their own merits. Gouldman—who by 1972 was back at Strawberry Studios—said:

Stewart said the decision was made over a meal in a Chinese restaurant: &quot;We asked ourselves whether we shouldn&#x27;t pool our creative talents and try to do something with the songs that each of us was working on at the time.&quot; Once again a four-piece, the group re-recorded the Hotlegs track &quot;Today&quot; (b/w a new Stewart/Gouldman song &quot;Warm Me&quot;), which was released under the name Festival. The single failed to chart, and the band moved on to record a Stewart/Gouldman song, &quot;Waterfall&quot;, in early 1972. Stewart offered the acetate to Apple Records. He waited months before receiving a note from the label saying the song was not commercial enough to release as a single.

==1972–1976: Original line-up==
Undeterred by Apple&#x27;s rejection, the group decided to plug another song which had been written as a possible B-side to &quot;Waterfall&quot;, a Godley/Creme composition titled &quot;Donna&quot;. The song was a Frank Zappa-influenced 1950s doo-wop parody, a sharp mix of commercial pop and irony with a chorus sung in falsetto. Stewart said: &quot;We knew it had something. We only knew of one person who was mad enough to release it, and that was Jonathan King.&quot; Stewart called King, who drove to Strawberry, listened to the track and &quot;fell about laughing&quot;, declaring: &quot;It&#x27;s fabulous, it&#x27;s a hit.&quot;

King signed the band to his UK Records label in July 1972 and dubbed them 10cc. By his own account, King chose the name after having a dream in which he was standing in front of the Hammersmith Odeon in London where the boarding read &quot;10cc The Best Band in the World&quot;. A widely repeated claim, disputed by King and Godley, but confirmed in a 1988 interview with Creme, is that the band name represented ten cubic centimetres, a volume of semen that was the average amount ejaculated (according to Creme), thus emphasizing their potency or prowess.

However, in a 2025 interview, Gouldman stated: &quot;We got bored with giving the long-winded reason for how we got the name, then someone told us the average male ejaculation was 9cc. Since we were 1cc more, we started saying it was the average male ejaculation. Is it a real fact? I have no idea! But it is now.&quot; &quot;Donna&quot;, released as the first 10cc single, was chosen by BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Tony Blackburn as his Record of the Week, helping to launch it into the Top 30. The song peaked at No. 2 in the UK in October 1972.

Although their second single, a similarly 1950s-influenced song called &quot;Johnny Don&#x27;t Do It&quot;, was not a major chart success, &quot;Rubber Bullets&quot;, a catchy satirical take on the &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; concept, became a hit internationally and gave 10cc their first British No. 1 single in June 1973. They consolidated their success a few months later with &quot;The Dean and I&quot;, which peaked at No. 10 in September. They released two singles, &quot;Headline Hustler&quot; (in the US) and the self-mocking &quot;The Worst Band in the World&quot; (in the UK) and launched a UK tour on 26 August 1973, joined by second drummer Paul Burgess, before returning to Strawberry Studios in November to record the remainder of their second LP, &quot;Sheet Music&quot; (1974), which included &quot;The Worst Band in the World&quot; along with other hits &quot;The Wall Street Shuffle&quot; (No. 10, 1974) and &quot;Silly Love&quot; (No. 24, 1974). &quot;Sheet Music&quot; became the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, remaining on the UK charts for six months and paving the way for a US tour in February 1974.

In February 1975, the band announced they were splitting with Jonathan King and that they had signed with Mercury Records for US$1 million. The catalyst for the deal was one song–&quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot;. Stewart recalled:At that point in time we were still on Jonathan King&#x27;s label, but struggling. We were absolutely skint, the lot of us, we were really struggling seriously, and Philips Phonogram wanted to do a deal with us. They wanted to buy Jonathan&#x27;s contract. Our manager Ric Dixon invited them to listen to what we&#x27;ve done. Head of A &amp; R Nigel Grainge came up to our Strawberry Studio, heard the album and freaked. He said &quot;This is a masterpiece, it&#x27;s a done deal!&quot;. We did a five-year deal with them for five albums and they paid us a serious amount of money. It was Grainge&#x27;s idea to release &#x27;Life Is A Minestrone&#x27; as the first single holding back the big one to give us more longevity for the album.

Speaking in the BBC Four documentary &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love: The Story of 10cc&quot; in 2015, Stewart expanded on the background, explaining that their royalty returns under the contract with King were a mere 4%. Creme therefore planned to sign with Richard Branson&#x27;s new Virgin label. Stewart and Creme gave power of attorney to their manager Harvey Lisberg to finalise the deal, as they were both to go on holiday. Contrary to their instructions, Lisberg then accepted a revised offer from Phonogram. Creme said that he felt &quot;horrified, embarrassed and disgusted – to this day I still am&quot;.

&quot;The Original Soundtrack&quot;, which was already complete, was released just weeks later. It was both a critical and commercial success, and featured distinctive cover art created by the Hipgnosis team and drawn by musician and artist Humphrey Ocean. It is also notable for its opening track, Godley and Creme&#x27;s &quot;Une Nuit A Paris (One Night in Paris)&quot;, an eight-minute, multi-part &quot;mini-operetta&quot; that is thought to have been an influence on &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; by Queen.

Although it bore an unlikely title (picked up from a radio talk show), &quot;Life Is a Minestrone&quot; (1975) was another UK Top 10 placing, peaking at No. 7. Their biggest success came with the dreamy &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot;, which gave the band their second UK No. 1 in June 1975. The song provided them with their first US chart success when the song reached No. 2. A collaborative effort built around a title by Stewart, &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot; is notable for its innovative production, especially its richly overdubbed choral backing. Godley said:If I was to pick one track from everything we&#x27;ve done, &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot; would be my favourite. It&#x27;s got something that none of our other tracks have at all. It&#x27;s not clever in a conscious way but it says it all so simply in, what, six minutes. – &quot;NME&quot;, February 1976

During that time, 10cc also collaborated with Justin Hayward on the single &quot;Blue Guitar&quot;, being a backing band and doing production work. The song was also released on later reissues of the &quot;Blue Jays&quot; album by Hayward and John Lodge.

10cc&#x27;s fourth LP, &quot;How Dare You!&quot; (1976), featuring another Hipgnosis cover, furnished two more UK Top Ten hits—the witty &quot;Art for Art&#x27;s Sake&quot; (No. 5 in January 1976) and &quot;I&#x27;m Mandy, Fly Me&quot; (No. 6, April 1976). However, by this time the once close personal and working relationships between the four members had begun to fray, and it was the last album with the original line-up. 10cc&#x27;s success prompted the 1976 re-release of the Hotlegs album under the new title &quot;You Didn&#x27;t Like It Because You Didn&#x27;t Think of It&quot; with two additional tracks. The title track was the epic B-side of &quot;Neanderthal Man&quot;, a section of which had been reworked as &quot;Fresh Air for My Mama&quot; on the &quot;10cc&quot; album.

==1976: Split==
Frictions mounted between the group&#x27;s two creative teams during the recording of &quot;How Dare You&quot;, with each pair realising how far apart their ideas had become. At the beginning of the sessions for the band&#x27;s fifth album, further creative differences occurred; and Godley and Creme left 10cc to work on a project that eventually evolved into the triple-LP set &quot;Consequences&quot; (1977), a sprawling concept album that featured contributions from satirist Peter Cook and jazz vocalist Sarah Vaughan.

The first of a series of albums by Godley &amp; Creme, &quot;Consequences&quot; began as a demonstration record for the &quot;Gizmotron&quot;, an electric guitar effect they had invented. The device, which fitted over the bridge of an electric guitar, contained six small motor-driven wheels attached to small keys (four wheels for electric basses); when the key was depressed, the Gizmotron wheels bowed the guitar strings, producing notes and chords with endless sustain. First used during the recording of the &quot;Sheet Music&quot; track &quot;Old Wild Men&quot;, the device was designed to further cut their recording costs: by using it on an electric guitar with studio effects, they could effectively simulate strings and other sounds, enabling them to dispense with expensive orchestral overdubs.

In a 2007 interview with the ProGGnosis—Progressive Rock &amp; Fusion website, Godley said: &quot;We left because we no longer liked what Gouldman and Stewart were writing. We left because 10cc was becoming safe and predictable and we felt trapped.&quot; But speaking to &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine 10 years earlier, he expressed regret about the band breaking up as they embarked on the &quot;Consequences&quot; project:

In a BBC Radio Wales interview Stewart gave his side of the split:
Stewart said that there were immediate benefits in the absence of Godley and Creme. &quot;It became clear things went much smoother and the atmosphere was much more pleasant than with Lol and Kevin,&quot; he said.

Godley &amp; Creme went on to achieve success as a songwriting and recording duo, scoring several hits and releasing a string of LPs and singles. Having honed their skills on the clips that they made to promote their own singles (e.g. their 1985 single &quot;Cry&quot;) they returned to their visual arts roots and became directors of music videos in the 1980s, creating videos for acts including George Harrison (&quot;When We Was Fab&quot;), Asia (&quot;Heat of the Moment&quot;, &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot;) The Police (&quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;), Duran Duran (&quot;Girls on Film&quot;), Frankie Goes to Hollywood (&quot;Two Tribes&quot;), Peter Gabriel&#x27;s duet with Kate Bush (&quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;), Yes’ “Leave It,” and Herbie Hancock (&quot;Rockit&quot;). They also directed a video for Stewart and Gouldman&#x27;s &quot;Feel the Love&quot;.

==1977–1983: Second era==
After the departure of Godley and Creme, Stewart and Gouldman opted to continue as 10cc, working with drummer Paul Burgess, who had up to that point been their tour backup drummer. Their first album as a three-piece band was &quot;Deceptive Bends&quot; (1977), named after a sign on the Mickleham bends on the A24 between Leatherhead and Dorking in Surrey. The album, recorded at the newly completed Strawberry South Studio in Dorking, Surrey, reached No. 3 in Britain and No. 31 in the US and also yielded three hit singles, &quot;The Things We Do for Love&quot; (UK No. 6, US No. 5), &quot;Good Morning Judge&quot; (UK No. 5, US No. 69) and &quot;People in Love&quot; (US No. 40). Stewart later said he and Gouldman felt vindicated by its success: &quot;I was out to prove also that we could write a hit album without Kevin and Lol ... we did!&quot;

In 1977, 10cc embarked on an international tour with guitarist Rick Fenn, keyboardist Tony O&#x27;Malley (Kokomo) and an additional drummer Stuart Tosh (ex-Pilot) and recorded a live album, &quot;Live and Let Live&quot; (1977), which mixed the hits with material by Stewart and Gouldman from 10cc&#x27;s career (alongside two songs written with Godley and Creme). Fenn, Tosh, Burgess and keyboardist Duncan Mackay, who replaced Tony O&#x27;Malley after the tour, were now full members of the band and performed on 1978&#x27;s &quot;Bloody Tourists&quot;, which provided the band with their international No. 1 single, the reggae-styled &quot;Dreadlock Holiday&quot;, also their third UK No. 1. Both &quot;Bloody Tourists&quot; and &quot;Dreadlock Holiday&quot; were very successful around the world; however, additional songs released as singles became only minor hits, with the second UK single &quot;Reds in My Bed&quot;, featuring lead vocals by Tosh, failing to chart.

The band suffered a major setback in January 1979 when Stewart was seriously injured in a car crash. Due to his injuries he was unable to work on music, and 10cc had to be put on hold. This led to the cancellation of part of a tour, and to other band members working on solo projects. Stewart later told the BBC:

Gouldman, too, considered the aftermath of Stewart&#x27;s accident to be a turning point. In a 1995 BBC interview he said:
While Stewart recovered, Gouldman recorded the title track to the film &quot;Sunburn&quot; with the help of some of the 10cc band members, which became a minor UK hit in 1979. Gouldman also recorded the soundtrack to the animated film &quot;Animalympics&quot;, which was originally intended as a 10cc project. Rick Fenn had great success touring with Mike Oldfield and recording with Nick Mason, after being introduced to them by Eric Stewart, while Duncan Mackay took part in recording of the Kate Bush album &quot;Never for Ever&quot;.

Filling the gap between 10cc releases, a greatest-hits compilation (&quot;Greatest Hits 1972–1978&quot;) was issued in late 1979, a single came out coupling &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot; with &quot;For You and I&quot;, which failed to chart. As Stewart recovered, he recorded the soundtrack to the film &quot;Girls&quot;, mainly working with Duncan Mackay, with other 10cc band members making guest appearances. The band signed with Warner Bros. Records, producing a new 10cc offering entitled &quot;Look Hear?&quot; The lead single &quot;One-Two-Five&quot; failed to chart in their native UK, and the album proved to be less successful than previous 10cc albums. In the aftermath of the tour in support of it, Eric Stewart, Graham Gouldman and the rest of the band members again embarked on a number of side projects.

Gouldman and Stewart then decided to continue 10cc as a duo with other members becoming session and touring musicians. The band returned to the Mercury label to record &quot;Ten Out of 10&quot; (1981) featuring Fenn and Burgess on a number of tracks. The UK release of the album (and its associated singles &quot;Les Nouveaux Riches&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Me Away&quot;) failed to chart. In a bid to inject an American flavour to the album and bolster its commercial appeal, Warner Bros. invited singer-songwriter Andrew Gold to contribute to a revised North American version of the LP. Gold wound up co-writing and playing on three new tracks which appeared on the North American release of &quot;Ten Out of 10&quot;. This ultimately led to an offer from Gouldman and Stewart to officially join 10cc, an offer that Gold declined because of other commitments. Gouldman later admitted greater involvement by Gold might have lifted the band&#x27;s early 1980s output from its mediocrity:

Though revisions were made to the album for the North American market, &quot;Ten Out of 10&quot; did not chart in US, nor did any singles pulled from the LP. However, the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Me Away&quot; was a minor hit in Canada, reaching No. 38. Ironically, this track was one that appeared on the original &quot;less commercial&quot; UK version of the LP, and was &quot;not&quot; one of the tracks that had been specially added to the North American release.

The band embarked on their 10th anniversary tour in early 1982, with Fenn, Burgess and Tosh joining Stewart and Gouldman, along with new keyboardist Vic Emerson of Sad Café. They released &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, co-written with Andrew Gold, as a single, which did not chart. &quot;Run Away&quot;, released as a single in June 1982, reached No. 50 in the UK; &quot;We&#x27;ve Heard it all Before&quot; (October 1982) did not chart. All three of the singles were tracks from the revised North American version of &quot;Ten Out of 10&quot;, and had not previously been issued in the UK. Stewart also released a 1982 solo album, &quot;Frooty Rooties&quot;, with Burgess as a drummer and participation from Gouldman and Fenn on one track.

10cc began a UK tour in March 1983, coinciding with the release of the single &quot;24 Hours&quot;. The song was made available both as a 7&quot; and 10&quot; single, with live versions of &quot;Dreadlock Holiday&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot; on the B-sides. It failed to chart, as did a further single, &quot;Feel The Love (Oomachasaooma)&quot;/&quot;She Gives Me Pain&quot;, issued in July 1983. &quot;Feel The Love (Oomachasaooma)&quot; was promoted by a tennis-themed video clip, directed by former 10cc members Godley and Creme, by now well into their joint careers as music video pioneers. The next 10cc LP, &quot;Windows in the Jungle&quot; (October 1983), used session heavyweights including drummer Steve Gadd, but the album was dominated by Stewart; Gouldman only performed partial lead vocals on one song. It reached No. 70 on the UK chart. The band toured the UK in October, with drummer Jamie Lane in place of Paul Burgess (who was working with Jethro Tull). This turned out to be their last tour until they reformed eight years later.

==1984–1991: Separate projects==
After 1983, the band went into recess as Stewart produced recordings for Sad Café and Gouldman produced tracks for the Ramones. Stewart continued his association with Paul McCartney; he had already appeared on &quot;Tug of War&quot; in 1982 and &quot;Pipes of Peace&quot; in 1983. During 1984, he appeared in the video for the US single &quot;So Bad&quot; which also featured Ringo Starr and the feature film/soundtrack for &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot;. He then co-wrote much of the &quot;Press to Play&quot; album (1986), though he was critical of the album&#x27;s production. He also produced the album &quot;Eyes of a Woman&quot; (1985) by Agnetha Fältskog of ABBA.

Gouldman, meanwhile, teamed with Andrew Gold to form the duo Common Knowledge, which after two unsuccessful singles changed their name to Wax. The duo&#x27;s albums included &quot;Magnetic Heaven&quot; (1986), &quot;American English&quot; (1987) and &quot;A Hundred Thousand in Fresh Notes&quot; (1989). The duo scored some success, including a Spanish No. 1 single and their only British hit, &quot;Bridge to Your Heart&quot; (1987), which reached No. 12. Gouldman also assembled and produced the charity single &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; by The Crowd in aid of the Bradford City stadium fire. Released in 1985, the single reached No. 1 on the UK chart. A compilation album, &quot;Changing Faces – The Very Best of 10cc and Godley &amp; Creme&quot;, was released in 1987 and gave the band their biggest hit album since 1978. A four CD box set, &quot;Greatest Songs and More&quot;, was issued in Japan in 1991, which included many b-sides available on CD for the first time.

==1991–1995: 10cc reunited==
In 1991, the original four members reunited to record &quot;...Meanwhile&quot; (1992), an album produced by Gary Katz of Steely Dan fame. Katz was suggested by the record label Polydor who wanted 10cc to enjoy success in America, and because of his links to Steely Dan—a similar-sounding 1970s band. All the album&#x27;s songs were written by Stewart and Gouldman (with the exception of one track which was co-written by Stewart and Paul McCartney in the late 1980s with additional writing from Gouldman). Creme and Godley agreed to guest on the album to fulfil their obligation to Polydor—both had owed Polydor one album when they split in the late 1980s. Godley and Creme sang background vocals on several tracks on the album. Godley also sang the lead on one song, &quot;The Stars Didn&#x27;t Show&quot;.

&quot;...Meanwhile&quot; did not spawn any major hits, but was relatively well received in Japan and in Europe. It prominently featured session musicians Jeff Porcaro of Toto on drums, Freddie Washington on bass, Michael Landau on lead and rhythm guitar, and Bashiri Johnson on percussion. Also appearing on the album were Dr. John (Mac Rebennack) on piano, David Paich (also of Toto fame) on keyboards, longtime 10cc collaborator Andrew Gold on guitar and many other renowned session musicians and singers. &quot;...Meanwhile&quot; is believed to be Porcaro&#x27;s last session work before he died of a heart attack. Dr. John was recommended by producer Gary Katz and invited along to the sessions.

Gouldman, in a 1995 interview, was philosophical about the album: &quot;When we finally did come back to record again, it was based on market research that our record company had done, that said a new 10cc album would do really, really well. And, ah, history has proved that wrong.&quot; Yet according to Stewart, both he and Gouldman had approached the album positively. &quot;We wrote in a three-month period, 22 songs. Every day we were coming up with new ideas, and they were getting better and better, as far as we were concerned. And they sounded like 10cc songs again.&quot;

A tour in 1993 followed the album, with former members Rick Fenn and Stuart Tosh returning alongside new players Steve Piggot (keyboards, synthesisers) and Gary Wallis (drum, percussion). This tour was captured on the live album and DVD &quot;Alive&quot;.

In 1995, the band released &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot;, produced by Gouldman, Stewart and Adrian Lee of Mike + The Mechanics, and without participation from Godley or Creme. Despite initial objections by Gouldman, &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot; included an acoustic version of &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot; which became a No. 29 UK hit single, but overall the album did not fare very well. Gouldman has described &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot; as &quot;almost like two-halves of an album&quot;, largely a result of the fact that he and Stewart recorded in separate countries. &quot;I don&#x27;t like to say we hoodwinked the people, but you could say it&#x27;s not quite what it appears to be, and anyone with any sense, who reads the credits, could see that,&quot; he told &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine. Their recording arrangement also provided further evidence of a fractured relationship between Stewart and Gouldman: aside from &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot;, Stewart did not appear on any of the tracks Gouldman played or sang on, while Gouldman did not appear on any of Stewart&#x27;s tracks. In the spring of 1995, the band toured Europe and Japan with a line-up of Stewart, Gouldman, Fenn, Tosh, Alan Park (keyboards, synthesisers) and Geoff Dunn (drums, percussion).

Stewart left the band after this tour, and has since commented: &quot;10cc is well and truly finished as far as I am concerned.&quot; Married to a pair of sisters, Stewart and Creme have kept in touch.

==1999–present: 10cc touring band, GG/06==
In 1999, Gouldman convened a 10cc line-up consisting of himself, Fenn, Paul Burgess, and new recruits Mick Wilson (vocals, guitar) and Mike Stevens (vocals, keyboards, sax, guitar). This version of the band played their first gig at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in Birmingham and then began touring regularly in 2002. This iteration of the group toured both the UK and overseas, playing 10cc hits plus a section of songs from Gouldman&#x27;s songwriting career Wax. Wilson handled the majority of the lead vocals, taking over from Eric Stewart on that front. Founding guitarist Lol Creme, discussing his newest live act in 2012, opined:
In January 2004, Godley and Gouldman reconvened to write more songs. The band started offering the new songs through their website in 2006 and eventually released the EP &quot;GG/06: EP - 1&quot;. A few of the songs were added to the 10cc live set, while the song &quot;Son of Man&quot; later became the opening theme for 10cc shows with Godley providing the video. Kevin Godley also joined 10cc live on several occasions.

A new 10cc touring member, Keith Hayman (keyboards), switched with Mike Stevens in 2006 and continued to do so until 2011. The band released a live album and DVD titled &quot;Clever Clogs&quot; in 2008 featuring Kevin Godley on several songs, including GG/06&#x27;s &quot;BeautifulLoser.com&quot;. In early 2009, Gouldman&#x27;s 10cc launched its website, 10ccworld.com (now 10cc.world). Since the release, the website offered various live recordings of the shows through its online store. Regarding new 10cc studio releases, Gouldman has said that without Stewart, Creme or Godley, there will never be another 10cc album, though he is happy to play past albums in concert. Celebrating the 40th anniversary of the band&#x27;s formation, 10cc performed a concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 10 May 2012 with Kevin Godley performing several songs with the band. Universal Music also issued two box sets for this occasion. The first one titled &quot;Tenology&quot;, a four-CD/one-DVD retrospective, was released on 19 November 2012. All four original members helped choose the track listing and gave interviews to Paul Lester as part of the project. The second box set titled &quot;Classic Album Selection&quot; featured albums from &quot;The Original Soundtrack&quot; to &quot;Live and Let Live&quot; along with bonus tracks.

In December 2015, BBC Four released the hour-long documentary titled &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love: The Story of 10cc&quot;. In 2016 Godley recorded a video performance of &quot;Somewhere in Hollywood&quot; for 10cc&#x27;s live performance of the album &quot;Sheet Music&quot; during that year. The same year, Keith Hayman again replaced Mike Stevens on keyboards.

In July 2017, a box set titled &quot;Before, During and After: The Story of 10cc&quot; was released. The four-disc set contains 10cc material as well as material from the late 1960s and early 1970s that the band recorded under various names and material from various projects that band members were involved in after leaving the band. Eric Stewart also released a solo boxset through Cherry Records while promoting his autobiography. In late 2017, the 10cc concert line-up changed with Iain Hornal taking Wilson&#x27;s place permanently as vocalist, after filling in regularly since 2013. And Paul Canning subbed for Hornal briefly during 2018, then once again in November of 2023. In 2020-2021, guitarist Nick Kendall subbed for Rick Fenn. On 19 July 2023 Graham and the group appeared on &quot;This Morning&quot;, a UK breakfast TV show, performing &quot;The Things We Do for Love&quot;, with Nick Kendall once again standing in for Rick Fenn. Keyboardist Ciaran Jeremiah accompanied the group on a November 2023 European tour filling in for Keith Hayman, who was touring with Cliff Richard.

On March 11, 2024, the band announced their first North American tour in forty six years, The Ultimate, Ultimate Greatest Hits Tour, due to commence on July 24, 2024, at the Wellmont Theater in Montclair, New Jersey. Andy Park (vocals, guitars, bass, percussion, mandolin, keyboards) was brought in to sub for Iain Hornal, who was out performing with Jeff Lynne&#x27;s ELO.

In 2025, Kevin Godley reunited with Graham Gouldman for a special performance as 10cc for an edition of &quot;BBC Radio 2&#x27;s Piano Room&quot; with the BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Anne Dudley. Three songs were performed including I&#x27;m Not in Love, new composition I Don&#x27;t Want To Go To Heaven and a cover version of All I Have To Do Is Dream.

<text>was a town located in Haibara District, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. As of 2005, the town had an estimated population of 20,364 and a density of 318.29 persons per km2. The total area was 64.36 km2.

==History==
On May 5, 2005, Kanaya was merged into its long-time twin city, the expanded city of Shimada and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

Kanaya was developed from the Edo period as Kanaya-juku, a post town on the Tōkaidō. Located on the west bank of the Ōi River, Kanaya prospered from the Tokugawa Shogunate&#x27;s policy of not allowing any bridge or ferry to be established on the Ōi River in order to strengthen Edo&#x27;s defenses. Travellers waiting to cross the river on foot were often trapped in Kanaya for days, if not weeks, waiting for the river to become shallow enough to ford.

Kanaya Town was established in 1889. It merged with neighboring Goka Village in 1957.

==Economy==
Its main industry was green tea production.
