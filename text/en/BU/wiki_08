<text>Jari Pekka Kurri (; born 18 May 1960) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey player. Beginning in 1980, he played right wing for five National Hockey League (NHL) teams: the Edmonton Oilers, the Los Angeles Kings, the New York Rangers, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, and the Colorado Avalanche. Kurri played 17 seasons in the NHL and was the first Finnish player to be enshrined into the Hockey Hall of Fame, in 2001. He was a member of a Stanley Cup–winning team five times, all with the Oilers. In 2017, Kurri was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history. He won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy in 1985, and was the NHL goal scoring leader in the 1985–86 season.

Kurri&#x27;s jersey #17 was retired by the Edmonton Oilers and Jokerit. Internationally, Kurri played on the Finland men&#x27;s national ice hockey team, and was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2000. Since 2019, Kurri is the general manager and owner of Jokerit.

==Playing career==
===Early years (1977–1980)===
He began his pro career with Jokerit in the Finnish SM-liiga. After an eleven-point rookie season for Jokerit in 1977–78, Kurri scored 30 and 39 points the next two years, playing all 33 games in each season.

On March 20, 1979, in a game of seemingly minor consequence at the time, Kurri accompanied the Finnish national team to play in Edmonton, Alberta. The Finns had been invited by the World Hockey Association to play the WHA-leading Edmonton Oilers - while essentially an exhibition game for the Finnish team, the WHA counted the game in its standings. Finland lost the game 8–4, nevertheless, Kurri impressed the Oilers&#x27; management. His performance in Edmonton that night would have a profound impact on his later career.

===Edmonton Oilers (1980-1990)===
After his third professional season, Kurri was eligible for the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. However, he was also widely believed to still be liable for military service in NHL circles, and thus was ignored by most NHL teams. The Oilers, who had joined the NHL after the WHA merged following the 1978–79 season, had closely tracked Kurri&#x27;s career after watching him play in Edmonton. They made discreet inquiries to the Finnish government and were able to determine that Kurri had already fulfilled his military service obligations. Taking advantage of this information, the Oilers waited until the fourth round before selecting Kurri with the 69th overall pick. Kurri remains regarded as one of the greatest &quot;steals&quot; in the history of the NHL draft.

When Kurri joined the Oilers, he was soon paired with Wayne Gretzky. Kurri and Gretzky became one of the most prolific scoring duos ever to play in the NHL. Despite not always playing on the same line, Gretzky assisted on 364 of Kurri&#x27;s 601 career goals, while Kurri had an assist on 196 Gretzky goals.

During his career in Edmonton, he was nicknamed the &quot;Finnish Flash&quot; (a title since bestowed on Teemu Selänne). Kurri was &quot;by far our most complete player&quot;, according to Oilers&#x27; director of personnel Barry Fraser. Although Kurri never won the Selke Trophy, he was regarded as one of the best defensive forwards in the NHL. Alongside Kurri, Esa Tikkanen and Gretzky, Edmonton had future hall-of-famers Paul Coffey, Grant Fuhr, Glenn Anderson, Kevin Lowe and Mark Messier. The team won four Stanley Cups during Gretzky&#x27;s tenure. In 1988, Gretzky was traded, along with team enforcer Marty McSorley, to the Los Angeles Kings. Following Gretzky&#x27;s trade, Kurri recorded 195 points in 154 games, leading the Oilers to their fifth and last Stanley Cup in 1990.

Kurri won five Stanley Cups, all with Edmonton (1984, 1985, 1987, 1988 and 1990). In 1984–85 he had 135 points and scored 50 goals in his first 50 games; however, his 50th game was the Oilers&#x27; 53rd game so it does not count as an official 50 goals in 50 games. A year later, he led the league in goals with 68. In 1984–85 Kurri set a record for goals by a right winger when he scored 71, which was broken by Brett Hull when he scored 72 goals in 1989–90 (Hull&#x27;s 86 goals in 1990–91 is the current record). Kurri also scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in game seven against the Philadelphia Flyers in 1987.

Kurri&#x27;s 19 goals in the 1985 post-season (18 games played) tied an NHL record set by the Flyers&#x27; Reggie Leach in the 1976 playoffs (16 games played). Those 19 goals included four hat tricks, a still-standing record in a playoff season. Kurri scored three of the hat tricks against the Blackhawks in the conference finals, also a feat that no player has ever equaled. He scored five goals in a single game, on November 19, 1983. The achievement was not repeated by the Finnish player until November 24, 2018, when Patrik Laine had a five-goal game. Kurri registered three goals and two assists in Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals in Boston, on May 18, 1990, setting a record for scoring in a single Finals game in the modern era, on his 30th birthday. Kurri had also set up Petr Klíma&#x27;s goal in triple overtime in Game 1.

===Later career (1990–1998)===
Kurri&#x27;s contract with the Oilers expired in 1990 but his NHL rights were still owned by the Oilers. Instead of accepting a new contract from the Oilers, Kurri opted for a season in Italy and played for Devils Milano of the Italian Serie A. Kurri had 27 goals and 48 assists in 30 games while he played in the Italian league.

After a season in Italy, Kurri&#x27;s rights were traded to the Philadelphia Flyers and then to the Los Angeles Kings on the same day. He made an impression in his first game as a King, scoring 3 goals on opening night. For the first time since the 1988 trade, Kurri was reunited with Wayne Gretzky. The pair had a fairly successful campaign in 1993 leading the Los Angeles Kings to the Stanley Cup Finals where they faced off against the Montreal Canadiens. Kurri managed to put together 17 points in 24 games during the run, in which the Kings ultimately fell short and lost the series in 5 games. Kurri followed the run up with a few more solid seasons as a Los Angeles King, scoring 146 points in 176 games; his decline in scoring was primarily due to his transition into a more defensive-minded forward in a somewhat reduced role. (Though they were back on the same team, by this time he and Gretzky were not usually playing on the same line.)

Kurri&#x27;s best season for the Kings was during the successful 1992–93 season when Kurri posted 27 goals and 60 assists in 82 games.

During the 1994–95 NHL lockout Jari Kurri represented Jokerit, the team for which he played before his NHL career. Kurri played alongside Teemu Selänne, the 1993 winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy who had established himself as one of the top stars in Finland during early success in the NHL. Kurri had one memorable moment during his visit to SM-liiga when Jokerit faced their local rivals HIFK. Kurri played against his former Oilers linemate Esa Tikkanen and another Finnish NHL player, Christian Ruuttu. Kurri, Selänne, and Jokerit captain Waltteri Immonen led Jokerit to a 4–2 victory over Russian HC Lada Togliatti in 1994 European Cup Finals.

After the lockout, Kurri returned to Los Angeles but was traded to New York Rangers in 1996 for their playoff run.

Kurri played the remainder of the 1995–96 NHL season with the Rangers and posted one goal and four assists in 14 games. While he may not have put up the points the Rangers expected him to at the end of the regular season, Kurri proved some of his value by notching 8 points in 11 playoff games with the Rangers.

After his short period with the Rangers, Kurri signed with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. Kurri intended to play alongside Teemu Selänne and Paul Kariya, but was ultimately reduced to a smaller role on the second and third lines, despite a newfound confidence from rigorous summer training. The Mighty Ducks made it to the playoffs and defeated the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round but were swept by the Detroit Red Wings in the second round.
After his single season with the Mighty Ducks, Kurri was signed by the Colorado Avalanche, the 1996 Stanley Cup champions. Kurri had a more defensive role with the Avalanche. Kurri&#x27;s highlight of the season was his 600th NHL career goal, which he scored during a regular season game between the Avalanche and the Kings. Despite having a strong team with players like Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg and Patrick Roy, the Avalanche were eliminated quickly in the playoffs by the Oilers.

==Legacy==
Kurri finished his career as the highest-scoring European-born-and-trained player in NHL history, with 601 goals, 797 assists, and 1,398 points. (Stan Mikita, who was born in Slovakia, but raised in Canada, retired 18 seasons before Kurri with 926 assists and 1,467 points.) Kurri has since been passed in all three categories by Jaromír Jágr, who also passed all of Mikita&#x27;s marks. Kurri has since also been bested in goals by Teemu Selänne (the current record-holder for NHL goals scored by a Finn), and in assists by Nicklas Lidström. He was also the highest ranked &quot;non-Canadian&quot; in NHL points and goals; the only non-Canadian with more assists at Kurri&#x27;s retirement was American Phil Housley, since passed by Mike Modano. Kurri finished with 106 career playoff goals and 233 playoff points, third all-time behind Gretzky and Messier. His 1,398 points are 19th all-time, and the third highest among players trained in Europe behind Jágr and Selänne. He is 18th in all-time goals with 601 and was the leading Finn in that department until Selänne passed him in 2010. He is the third leading point-scorer in Oilers history, with 1,043 points in 754 games, behind Gretzky and Connor McDavid. His No. 17 has been retired by the Edmonton Oilers, the Finnish national team, and Jokerit. In addition, the Jari Kurri trophy is given to the most valuable player in the SM-liiga playoffs. In 2000, he was named along with longtime linemate Gretzky to the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame. In 1998, he was ranked number 50 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, the highest-ranking Northern European player (1998). In addition, he was the first Finn to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, doing so in 2001.

==International play==
Kurri also had a lengthy international career for the Finnish national team. Kurri debuted during 1980 Winter Olympics when Finland played in the Olympic ice hockey tournament. Kurri scored two goals and an assist in his international debut.

Since NHL players were unable to participate in the Winter Olympics and World Championships, Kurri&#x27;s national team appearances were limited after he started his NHL career. Kurri was part of the Finnish national team during 1981 Canada Cup. Finland lost four games and had a 4–4 tie with the United States. Kurri had a disappointing performance, with only one assist in five games.

After the Oilers were eliminated in the 1982 NHL playoffs, Kurri was able to join the Finnish national team in 1982 World Championships. The tournament was held in Finland. Kurri formed Finland&#x27;s top line along with SM-liiga players Reijo Leppänen of TPS and Kari Jalonen of Kärpät. The lineup led the Finnish team in points and played well during the tournament but Finland was not able to advance to the medal round.

Kurri was part of the Finnish team at the 1987 Canada Cup and the 1989 World Championships, but Finland was unable to gain success in those tournaments, ranking 6th of 6 and 5th of 8, in those respective tournaments.

In 1991, Kurri represented Finland at the 1991 World Championships held again in Finland. Finland ranked 5th of 8 teams. Later that year, at the 1991 Canada Cup, Finland lost 3–7 to the United States in the semi-finals.

At the 1994 World Championships, Kurri managed to get his first international medal when Finland earned silver after losing 1–2 in a shootout against Canada.

At the 1998 Winter Olympics, Kurri faced Gretzky on ice for the last time, when Finland and Canada played for the Olympic bronze medal in Nagano. Finland was the underdog against Canada, but Finland won the game 3–2. Kurri scored the first goal of the game, which turned out to be his last goal for the Finnish national team.

==After retirement==

After being long-time general manager of the Finnish national men&#x27;s ice hockey team, scouting players and assisting the head coach.

Kurri was the general manager of the first Finnish KHL league team Jokerit. In the summer of 2019, Hjallis Harkimo sold the Jokerit to Kurri. in 2022 Kurri sold his share of team and is no longer part of its ownership.

==Personal life==

<doc id="587880" wikidata="Q5490403" url="?curid=587880" title="Frank Wills (security guard)">
<text>Frank Wills (February 4, 1948 – September 27, 2000) was an American security guard best known for his role in foiling the June 17 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee inside the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. Then 24, Wills called the police after discovering that locks at the complex had been tampered with. Five men were arrested inside the Democratic headquarters, which they had planned to bug. The arrests triggered the Watergate scandal and eventually the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974. Although hailed as a hero, Wills did not receive much financial reward or a promotion and later had difficulty finding work. He did media appearances and played himself in the 1976 film &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, but spent much of his life jobless and in poverty.

==Early life==
Wills was born in Savannah, Georgia on February 4, 1948. His parents separated when he was a child and he was primarily raised by his mother, Margie.

After dropping out of high school in 11th grade, Wills studied heavy machine operations in Battle Creek, Michigan and earned his equivalency degree from the Job Corps. He found an assembly-line job working for Ford in Detroit, Michigan. He later had to give up his assembly-line job due to health issues, namely asthma. Wills then traveled to Washington, D.C., and worked at a few hotels before landing a job as a security guard at the Watergate hotel.

==Watergate hotel==
In June 1972, Wills, at the age of 24, was working as a private security guard at the Watergate office building on the shores of the Potomac River. This was the location of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters. In the one year that Wills had worked there, there had been only one attempted burglary. In fact, it was considered so safe that security officers in the building carried around only a can of mace.

In the early hours of the morning of June 17, Wills noticed a piece of duct tape on one of the door locks when he was making his first round. The tape was placed over the latch bolt to prevent the door from latching shut. He removed the tape and continued on his patrol. Thirty minutes later, Wills returned to the door and noticed there was more tape on the same door. Without hesitation, Wills rushed up to the lobby telephone and asked for the Second Precinct police. The police turned off the elevators and locked the doors while accompanying Wills to search the offices one by one. Five men were found in the DNC offices. Wills recalled in 1997, &quot;When we turned the lights on, one person, then two persons, then three persons came out, and on down the line.&quot; Details that emerged during their questioning and trials triggered the Watergate scandal. The five men arrested were Bernard L. Barker, Virgilio Gonzalez, Eugenio Martinez, James W. McCord Jr., and Frank Sturgis.

==Aftermath==
One story reports that after the Watergate break-in, he received a raise of $2.50 per week () above his previous $80 per week salary (). Another story states he wanted, but did not receive, a promotion for discovering the burglary.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Wills quit his job because he did not receive a raise. He then struggled staying employed because media opportunities and appearances kept him away from work, most of which consisted of minimum wage jobs. 

Wills played himself in the 1976 film &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men.&quot; The book and film were based on Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein&#x27;s 1974 book accounting their investigation into the Watergate scandal. Wills also appeared briefly on the talk show circuit.

Wills&#x27; log entry made on June 17, 1972, at 1:47 a.m. is memorialized in the .

==Later life and poverty==
Over the next 20 years, Wills struggled to establish and maintain roots and stability while suffering bouts of unemployment. He shuttled between Washington and other southern cities, with some time spent in The Bahamas. He said in an interview that Howard University feared losing their federal funding if they hired him. A security job with Georgetown University did not last long. Also, he worked in a failed stint as a diet food spokesperson for the comedian Dick Gregory.

In the mid-1970s, Wills finally settled in North Augusta, South Carolina, to care for his aging mother, who had suffered a stroke. Together, they survived on her $450 per month Social Security checks. In 1979, Wills was convicted of shoplifting and fined $20. Four years later, he was convicted of shoplifting a pair of sneakers from a store in Augusta, Georgia and sentenced to one year in prison. By the time of his mother&#x27;s death in 1993, Wills was so destitute that he had to donate her body to medical research because he had no money with which to bury her.

Only when significant anniversaries of the Watergate break-in occurred did the waning spotlight reach out towards him again. In 1992, on the 20th anniversary of the burglary of the DNC headquarters, reporters asked if he were given the chance to do it all over again, would he? Wills replied with annoyance, &quot;That&#x27;s like asking me if I&#x27;d rather be white than black. It was just a part of destiny.&quot; That same year, Wills told a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reporter, &quot;I put my life on the line. I went out of my way... If it wasn&#x27;t for me, Woodward and Bernstein would not have known anything about Watergate. This wasn&#x27;t finding a dollar under a couch somewhere.&quot; Wills was quoted saying, &quot;Everybody tells me I&#x27;m some kind of hero, but I certainly don&#x27;t have any hard evidence. I did what I was hired to do but still I feel a lot of folk don&#x27;t want to give me credit, that is, a chance to move upward in my job&quot;.

Otherwise, Wills tended his garden, made the local library his study, and led a quiet life with his cats. Frank Wills died at the Medical College of Georgia hospital in Augusta, Georgia at the age of 52 from a brain tumor.

==Recognition==
Frank Wills was honored by the NAACP. The civil rights organization presented him with a truck.

Musician Harry Nilsson dedicated his 1973 album &quot;A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night&quot; to Wills for his role in bringing down Nixon.

The Democratic National Committee gave Wills an award, and the chairman said he had played &quot;a unique role in the history of the nation.&quot; 

According to Wills&#x27; obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;most eloquent description of his role&quot; in American history came on July 29, 1974; Rep. James Mann (D-South Carolina), while casting his vote to impeach Nixon on the House Judiciary Committee, said:&quot;If there is no accountability, another president will feel free to do as he chooses. But the next time there may be no watchman in the night.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Wills portrayed himself, discovering the break-in in the opening scene of the 1976 film, &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;.

An alternative version of events is depicted in the 1994 film, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, in which Wills (voice actor uncredited) is alerted to the burglary when answering a call from the eponymous hotel guest who was disturbed by the burglars’ flashlights.

In 2004, an imaginary scene of Wills discovering the taped door latches was enacted in the film &quot;She Hate Me&quot;, directed by Spike Lee, starring Anthony Mackie and Kerry Washington.

In 2017, Wills discovering the taped door latches was enacted as the closing scene of the film &quot;The Post&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks.

In 2022, Wills was portrayed by Patrick Walker in the political thriller television limited series &quot;Gaslit&quot; on Starz, starring Julia Roberts and Sean Penn, which depicts Wills making his rounds at the hotel and discovering the door being taped open two different times.

In 2023, Wills was portrayed by Eddie K. Robinson Jr. in the third episode of the HBO miniseries &quot;White House Plumbers&quot;.

<text>UMAX Technologies (), originally known as UMAX Computer Corporation, is a manufacturer of computer products, including scanners, mice, and flash drives, based in Taiwan. The company also uses the Yamada and Vaova brand names.

==History==

UMAX was formerly a maker of Apple Macintosh clones, using the &quot;SuperMac&quot; brand name outside of Europe. Their models included the SuperMac S900/S910, J700, C500 and C500e/i/LT, C600e/v/LT/x and Aegis 200. The C500 was marketed as the Apus 2000 in Europe. After Steve Jobs returned to Apple as the new CEO, he revoked all of the clone producers&#x27; licenses to produce Mac clones except for UMAX, due to their sub-US$1,000 low-end offerings, a market in which Apple was not strong, and UMAX&#x27;s stated desire to expand the Macintosh platform&#x27;s presence in East Asian markets. UMAX&#x27;s license for Mac OS 8 expired in July 1998. UMAX could not remain profitable selling only these systems, however; it briefly made IBM PC compatible computers in the mid-1990s, but since then UMAX has mainly concentrated on manufacturing scanners.

In 1995, UMAX was the leading Taiwanese scanner maker, with a market share of 13% second worldwide behind Hewlett-Packard (HP). This continued to be the case throughout 1996. According to &quot;PC Data&quot; figures, in 1997 UMAX briefly overtook HP in some monthly sales. According to the same source however, by 1999 UMAX was being &quot;eclipsed&quot; by HP whose scanner market share doubled that year from 13% to 26%. In some markets with high price-sensitivity like India for example, UMAX continued to have a slight lead on HP throughout 1999–2000 with the two companies claiming 44% and 40%, respectively, of the scanner sales in this country; 85% of which were for products costing less than 10,000 Rs.) By 2003, HP and Canon were dominating the world&#x27;s flatbed scanner market, &quot;accounting for a combined unit market share of 81 per cent.&quot;

In 2002, UMAX started to charge its US customers for driver upgrades for its scanners—a practice that soon proved controversial.

Until their exit from the desktop scanner market in 2002, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen used UMAX as its OEM for these products.

UMAX also made a 1.3 megapixel digital camera called the AstraPix 490. It is capable of recording video clips, functioning as a webcam and can even be used to listen to music encoded in MP3 format.

== Scanners ==

* Astra 610S and 1200S; these were cloned and/or repackaged (OEM&#x27;d) for many other manufacturers
* Astra 1220P
* Astra 2000U
* Astra 2100U
* Astra 2400S, NCR 53C80 SCSI/Intel 8031 based 600x1200dpi
* Astra 3450
* Astra 4900
* Astra 4950
* Astra 5600
* Astra 6700
* AstraSlim
* AstraSlim SE
* PowerLook 1000
* PowerLook 1120
* PowerLook 2100XL
* PowerLook 180
* PowerLook 270

== Scanner software ==
UMAX offers some semi-free (in the sense that some versions/updates cost money and some do not) basic scanner software for Microsoft Windows (up to Windows XP) and Mac OS:
* VistaScan is their basic TWAIN scanner module, which also contains Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) drivers in its newer versions. It features a simpler interface compared to MagicScan. However, not all versions work with all products. In general, VistaScan versions after 3.55 no longer support SCSI scanners. The German site of UMAX has a (bilingual) webpage/wizard that helps the user select the proper version for their scanner.
* MagicScan is the higher-end version of VistaScan, with a user interface aimed at more experienced users; it did not ship with the cheaper scanners (Astra, etc.) but only with the higher-end (PowerLook) scanners. It does however work with many of the cheaper UMAX scanners. Versions after 4.71 no longer ship with SCSI drivers.

Additionally, UMAX offers more sophisticated (typically non-free) third-party photo scanning/correction software:
* binuscan PhotoPerfect, which is a standalone application and has a plug-in for MagicScan; PhotoPerfect is also bundled with high-end scanners and sold separately for others 
* SilverFast is compatible with many UMAX scanner (especially the SCSI ones); its entry-level (SE) version is shipped with some newer UMAX scanners. and offered separately for others

For optical character recognition, some UMAX scanners came bundled with OmniPage and others with ABBYY FineReader.

The Unix SANE software generally supports well the UMAX SCSI scanners, with varying degrees of support for the other ones (USB, FireWire, parallel).

<doc id="587885" wikidata="Q7413938" url="?curid=587885" title="San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard">
<text>The San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard was a short-lived shipyard formed in 1965 with the combination of the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard and the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. The combined yards were the largest naval shipyard in the world, but the desired cost savings did not materialize, and the two yards reverted to separate management in February 1970. The Hunters Point shipyard was used for radioactive testing when the United States was testing the atomic bombs. The site has since been contaminated. The Hunters Point Naval Shipyard became a Superfund site, as designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It is the Navy&#x27;s requirement to clean up the site to &quot;reasonable&quot; levels to those who live adjacent to the shipyard.

The two shipyards were called:
*San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard Hunters Point Division (San Francisco Naval Shipyard)
*San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard Mare Island Division 

==Pacific Reserve Fleet, San Francisco==
Pacific Reserve Fleet, San Francisco Group was the combination United States Navy reserve fleets of &quot;mothballed&quot; stored ships and submarines. Pacific Reserve Fleet, San Francisco Group being made of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Mare Island and Pacific Reserve Fleet, Hunters Point (Pacific Reserve Fleet, San Francisco Group may also refer to only the Reserve Fleet at Hunters Point). Some ships in the fleet were reactivated for the Vietnam War.

<doc id="587894" wikidata="Q372145" url="?curid=587894" title="USS Okinawa (LPH-3)">
<text>USS &quot;Okinawa&quot; (LPH–3) was the second &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;-class amphibious assault ship of the United States Navy. She was the second Navy ship assigned the name &quot;Okinawa&quot;, in honor of the World War II Battle of Okinawa.

== Construction ==
&quot;Okinawa&quot; was laid down on 1 April 1960 (15th anniversary of the invasion of Okinawa) by the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; launched on 19 August 1961; sponsored by Mrs. John L. McClellan, wife of Arkansas Senator John L. McClellan; and commissioned on 14 April 1962.

== History ==

===Early career===
Following commissioning and sea trials, &quot;Okinawa&quot; departed Philadelphia on 20 June 1962 for her homeport, Norfolk, Va., where she spent a month fitting out. After a six-week shakedown cruise out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and another month in Norfolk, the amphibious assault ship began participation in her first fleet exercise in the Caribbean, 15 October. Shortly thereafter the Cuban Missile Crisis arose and &quot;Okinawa&quot; remained in the area, lending force to the United States&#x27; stand, until 3 December, when she returned to Norfolk.

The first half of 1963 was spent in availability at the Philadelphia and Norfolk Naval Shipyards and further trial operations in the Caribbean and out of Norfolk. On 9 July, &quot;Okinawa&quot; began her first formal Caribbean deployment, returning to Norfolk on 1 October and spending the remainder of that year and the first part of the next in that area. During June 1964, she sailed to Newport, Rhode Island and New York City for the World&#x27;s Fair. On 7 October, she left on her first trip to European waters, for operation &quot;Steel Pike I,&quot; an amphibious exercise off the coast of Spain. After a stop in France and a goodwill visit to Plymouth, England, &quot;Okinawa&quot; arrived back in Norfolk at the end of November.

===Dominican Republic===
In April 1965, while participating in an exercise off Puerto Rico, &quot;Okinawa&quot; was alerted and sent to an area off the Dominican Republic to act as medical evacuation ship with HMM-263 (Reinf) and the 1st Bn., 2d Marines during the Dominican crisis. The mission concluded on 29 May. Then, following the end of her deployment, she proceeded via Norfolk to Philadelphia for overhaul. In April 1966 she returned to Norfolk and began her third Caribbean deployment on 13 June. &quot;Okinawa&quot; was transferred to the Pacific Fleet; she set sail for the West Coast on 24 January 1967 and arrived at San Diego, her new home port, on 8 February.

===Vietnam and Apollo spacecraft recovery===
&quot;Okinawa&quot; left on 10 March for her first deployment off Vietnam. On 13 April, while sailing from &quot;Okinawa&quot; to Taiwan, the ship was diverted by a distress call, and the next day rescued all 38 persons from the grounded Panamanian vessel &quot;Silver Peak&quot; near the Sento Shosho Islands. While off Vietnam, &quot;Okinawa&quot; was a mobile base from which a well-equipped force of marines could quickly strike via helicopters at the Communist insurgents. She returned to San Diego on 5 December.

On 4 April 1968, after an intensive period of special training, &quot;Okinawa&quot; recovered the unmanned Apollo 6 space capsule 380 miles north of Kauai, Hawaii. With further exercises and upkeep, she conducted her second Westpac deployment from 2 November to 26 June 1969, when she arrived in San Diego for leave and upkeep.

On 17 May 1970, &quot;Okinawa&quot; delivered ten A-4K Skyhawk single-seaters, and four TA-4K two-seaters to New Zealand, after their purchase for the Royal New Zealand Air Force. The ship survived a severe storm after leaving Hawaii and the captain considered dumping the aircraft into the sea to save his ship but the storm abated.

In 1970 &quot;Okinawa&quot; was awarded the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation for her humanitarian assistance to the people of Lagonoy Gulf, Republic of the Philippines, who had been devastated by Typhoon Jean in October 1970.

On 7 August 1971, &quot;Okinawa&quot; was the recovery ship for the Apollo 15 spacecraft and crew of the fourth crewed Apollo program lunar landing mission.

===The Downfall of Republic of Cambodia ===
In April 1975, &quot;Okinawa&quot; participated in Operation Eagle Pull, the evacuation of Phnom Penh, Cambodia and Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon, Vietnam.

===Persian Gulf===
From 7 October 1987 to 7 April 1988, &quot;Okinawa&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of mine sweeping operations and MAGTF 1-88. She began her deployment heading West and continued West, circumnavigating the world.

&quot;Okinawa&quot; was the command ship of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit in August 1990 as part of a WestPac deployment when it was diverted to the Persian Gulf in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm during the Gulf War. Helicopters were launched as a diversion during the start of the ground phase of the war.

===Fate===
&quot;Okinawa&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; on 17 December 1992. She was transferred to MARAD and laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, in Suisun Bay, Benicia, Calif.

The ship was sunk as a target in a COMSUBPAC ship sinking exercise (SINKEX) on 6 June 2002, off the coast of Southern California, in 2,020 fathoms (3,700 m) at . After being hit by several Maverick, Harpoon missiles, and general-purpose bombs, the ex-&quot;Okinawa&quot; was finally sunk by a Mk 48 torpedo fired by the USS &quot;Portsmouth&quot;.

<doc id="587895" wikidata="Q185736" url="?curid=587895" title="Spaghetti-tree hoax">
<text>The spaghetti-tree hoax was a three-minute hoax report broadcast on April Fools&#x27; Day 1957 by the BBC current-affairs programme &quot;Panorama&quot;, purportedly showing a family in southern Switzerland harvesting spaghetti from a &quot;spaghetti tree&quot;. At the time of the report&#x27;s broadcast, spaghetti was relatively unknown in the United Kingdom, and a number of viewers contacted the BBC afterwards for advice on growing their own spaghetti trees. Decades later, CNN called this broadcast &quot;the biggest hoax that any reputable news establishment ever pulled&quot;.

==Broadcast==
The news report was produced as an April Fools&#x27; Day joke in 1957, and presented a family in the canton of Ticino in southern Switzerland gathering a bumper spaghetti harvest after a mild winter and &quot;virtual disappearance of the spaghetti weevil&quot;. Footage of a traditional &quot;Harvest Festival&quot; was aired along with a discussion of the breeding necessary to develop a strain to produce the perfect length of spaghetti. Some scenes were filmed at the (now closed) Pasta Foods factory on London Road, St Albans, in Hertfordshire, and at a hotel in Castagnola, Switzerland.

&quot;Panorama&quot; cameraman Charles de Jaeger dreamed up the story after remembering how teachers at his school in Austria teased his classmates for being so stupid that if they were told that spaghetti grew on trees, they would believe it. The editor of &quot;Panorama&quot;, Michael Peacock, told the BBC in 2014 how he gave de Jaeger a budget of £100 and sent him off. The report was made more believable through its voice-over by respected broadcaster Richard Dimbleby. Peacock said Dimbleby knew they were using his authority to make the joke work, and that Dimbleby loved the idea and went at it eagerly.

At the time, 7 million of the 15.8 million homes (about 44%) in Britain had television receivers. Pasta was not an everyday food in 1950s Britain, and it was known mainly from tinned spaghetti in tomato sauce and considered by many to be an exotic delicacy. An estimated eight million people watched the programme on 1 April 1957, and hundreds phoned in the following day to question the authenticity of the story or ask for more information about spaghetti cultivation and how they could grow their own spaghetti trees; the BBC told them to &quot;place a sprig of spaghetti in a tin of tomato sauce and hope for the best&quot;.

<text>Brice Lalonde (; born 10 February 1946) is a former green party leader in France, who ran for President of France in the Presidential elections, 1981. In 1988 he was named Minister of the Environment, and in 1990 founded the green Ecology Generation party.

==Life and career==
Lalonde was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, the son of Alain Lalonde and Fiona Forbes. His maternal grandparents were Americans James Grant Forbes II of the Forbes family and Margaret Tyndal Winthrop of the Dudley–Winthrop family. Through Fiona&#x27;s sister Rosemary, he is a first cousin of politicians John Kerry and Cameron Kerry. Lalonde&#x27;s paternal grandfather changed his surname from Lévy to Lalonde, and converted from Judaism to Catholicism. James Grant Forbes II was a poppy botanist and opium dealer in the China trade during the Opium Wars, who wrote a book on Chinese plants.

Lalonde was a student leader during the May 1968 student uprisings in France.

In 1968, Lalonde was a member of Union Nationale des Étudiants de France (UNEF), the French national students&#x27; union, and chairman of UNEF-Sorbonne, which brought France to a standstill with protests and riots. Later Lalonde, with David McTaggart, an activist involved in the Greenpeace protests against French nuclear tests at Mururoa atoll, helped create the confrontational strategies of boarding ships at sea in the 1970s. In July 1973, he was arrested by the French Navy during protests against nuclear tests in Mururoa, along with General Jacques Pâris de Bollardière, priest Jean Toulat and writer Jean-Marie Muller.

He was the Mouvement d&#x27;écologie politique (MEP) candidate for President of France in 1981 (3.88% of the vote), spokesman for Amis de la Terre in 1982 and later Environment Secretary of France (1988–90) and Environment Minister of France (1990–92). From 1995 to 2008, he was the mayor of Saint-Briac-sur-Mer, a small Breton village where the Forbes family have a villa.

In 1990 Lalonde founded the Ecology Generation party, which enjoyed runaway electoral success in 1992 but then declined in face of competition from the French Green Party. He was unable to run for president in the 1995 elections, being unable to obtain the necessary 500 signatures from French mayors or MPs. In 2002, he left the leadership of his party and politics. He became a consultant, working on development projects in Africa.

In 2007 Brice Lalonde was appointed French Ambassador for Climate Change and was heavily involved in multilateral climate change negotiations until the end of 2010, when UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed him Assistant Secretary-General, Executive Coordinator of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), which was held in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012.

Lalonde lives in Paris.

<doc id="587901" wikidata="Q232529" url="?curid=587901" title="Ghada Shouaa">
<text>Ghada Shouaa (; born September 10, 1972) is a retired Syrian heptathlete. At the 1996 Summer Olympics, she won her country&#x27;s first and only Olympic gold medal. She was also a World and Asian heptathlon champion. She is considered one of the best Asian and Arab female athletes of all time. She was a Syrian flag bearer at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.

She has represented Syria in her two strongest multi-event disciplines, the individual high jump and long jump events. She holds the Syrian high jump records with 1.87 m outdoors (1996), in javelin with 54.82 m (1999) in 200 m with 23.78 (1996), in long jump with 6.77 (1996) and in shot put with 16.25 (1999).

Shouaa&#x27;s heptathlon results include finishing 25th at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, 24th at the 1991 World Championships, third at the 1999 World Athletics Championships and first at the 1994 Asian Games. She is also multiple gold medalist at the Arab Athletics Championships. With a performance of 6942 points at the Hypo-Meeting, which moved her into the world all-time Top 25 and she went down in history as the best Asian and Arab heptathlete.

Shouaa&#x27;s career coincided with those of older compatriot, three-time Olympic champion and four-time World champion legend Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Olympic champion Denise Lewis.

==Early life==
Shouaa was born to a Greek Orthodox Christian family in the small Syrian city of Mhardeh in the Hama Governorate. Growing up in rural Syria, Ghada Shouaa first realised her sporting potential at the age of 12 when she managed to catch a rabbit that had escaped from the hands of an old man in her village. She was soon harnessing her natural speed, competing in cross-country races. However, it was in basketball that she made her initial foray into the world of elite sport. She played for the Syrian national team for a few years, but then decided to compete in athletics.

==Career==
In 1991, Shouaa took part in a competitive heptathlon in Aleppo for the first time and set a new Syrian national record with a points tally of 4,010. She was immediately sent to the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo, where she placed last. She concluded her first athletics season with a silver medal in the 1991 Asian Athletics Championships.

Shouaa debuted at the Olympics in the 1992 Barcelona Games, placing 25th in spite of an injury. Her breakthrough did not come until 1995, when she won the important heptathlon meet in Götzis, scoring 6715 points. This boosted her to one of the favourites for the title at the 1995 World Athletics Championships, held in Gothenburg. After co-favorite Sabine Braun dropped out with an injury, Shouaa won the title with a comfortable margin.

The following season, Shouaa again won the 1996 Hypo-Meeting, bringing the still-standing Asian record to 6942 points. In Atlanta, three months later, she confirmed her status as the best heptathlete at the time, winning Syria&#x27;s first Olympic gold medal.

A serious injury ruined the following season, and she was unable to make a serious comeback until 1999, when she placed third at the World Championships behind Eunice Barber. Shouaa attempted to defend her Olympic title in Sydney, but she again became injured and did not even finish the first event. After this disappointment, she decided to retire from athletics. After 2001, she was declared the best Syrian athlete of the 20th century.

===Civil War in Syria===
During a visit to Syria in 2013 or 2014 in the midst of civil war, Shouaa appeared in a picture with a heavy machine gun while accompanying the National Defence Forces, a branch of the Syrian Army.
In a speech, Shouaa greeted the Syrian Arab Army, saying the army&#x27;s motto &#x27;Homeland, Honor, Honesty&#x27; represents &quot;each and every honest Syrian from which he/she draws the ability for steadfastness and making achievements for Syria&#x27;s sake&quot;. She now lives in Germany.

<text>Horia Sima (3 July 1906 – 25 May 1993) was a Romanian fascist politician, best known as the second and last leader of the fascist paramilitary movement known as the Iron Guard (also known as the Legion of the Archangel Michael). Sima was also the Vice President of the Council of Ministers and &quot;de facto&quot; co-leader in Ion Antonescu&#x27;s National Legionary State. Sima had previously served briefly as State Secretary of Education under Gheorghe Tătărescu in 1940, and as a short-lived Minister of Religion and Arts in the government of Ion Gigurtu.

In January 1941, Sima initiated and led the Legionnaires&#x27; Rebellion against &quot;Conducător&quot; Ion Antonescu and the Romanian Army, for which he was sentenced to death, as well as the Bucharest pogrom, the largest and most violent pogrom against Jews in the history of Muntenia. Following the rebellion, Sima escaped to Germany, and later to Spain, where he lived until his death. In 1946, the Romanian People&#x27;s Tribunals again sentenced Sima to death &quot;in absentia&quot; as a war criminal.

==In Romania==
Sima was born on 3 July 1906 to Silvia and Gheorghe Sima in Mundra, Fogaras County, Transylvania, Kingdom of Hungary (today Mândra, Brașov County, Romania), although some sources incorrectly list his birthplace as the nearby city of Făgăraș and his birth year as 1907. Between 1926 and 1932, Horia Sima studied at the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy of the University of Bucharest, serving as councillor of the National Union of Christian Students of Romania. Beginning in 1932 he began to work as a high school teacher of logic, Latin, and philosophy in Caransebeș, later transferring to a school in Lugoj, and finally to Timișoara.

In October 1927, when a student, he joined the newly formed Iron Guard and became responsible for the Banat area. In the early 1930s, Sima participated in the Legion&#x27;s &quot;Excursions among the People&quot;, wherein Iron Guard members would promote their movement in rural areas among peasants, and had become a leading organizer for the Legion in Severin County by the 1930s. Sima was named in initial lists of Iron Guard electoral candidates for the 1933 Romanian general election, but the party was ultimately banned from participating. In 1935, he was promoted to the position of Legionary commander of the Timișoara region, and in the 1937 Romanian general elections, he ran as a candidate in Severin County. Sima became commander of the Iron Guard in late 1938 after its founder and leader, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, was imprisoned and later murdered. The Iron Guard had initially formed an interim leadership including Sima, Ion Belgae, Iordache Nicoară, Ion Antoniu, and Radu Mironovici in April 1938, but by August, Sima remained the only leader not imprisoned by the Romanian government, eventually allowing him to bypass the hierarchy of leadership previously established and become leader of the Iron Guard. Prior to his ascension to leadership, tension had built significantly both within the organization and country-wide following a series of assassinations of Iron Guard members, including of Codreanu (who was killed by order of King Carol II).

In early 1939, Sima fled to Nazi Germany through Yugoslavia, wherein he and a number of Romanian exiles attempted to plan a coup; this plot was discovered by German police and a number of Legionnaires were arrested. In the summer of the same year, he was sent back to prepare for and conduct the assassination of the Romanian Prime Minister, Armand Călinescu, on 21 September 1939 — following Călinescu&#x27;s murder, a group of Legionnaires led by Sima assumed control of Romania&#x27;s national radio broadcaster.

After a power struggle for Legionary leadership between Sima and a splinter group led by Vasile Noveanu that had formed while in exile, Sima was brought in by the short-lived Gheorghe Tătărescu government to serve as state secretary within the Ministry of Education. He occupied this position for only six days, and the Tătărescu government resigned on 3 July. On 4 July 1940, he joined the cabinet of Ion Gigurtu as the undersecretary of state in the Ministry of Public Education, as well as Minister of Religion and Arts, alongside two other Iron Guard members. Sima resigned from the Gigurtu cabinet after only four days. Under this cabinet, antisemitism became codified in Romanian law, and by 9 August 1940, marriage between ethnic Romanians and Jews was prohibited, as was access to public education for Jews. Following the secession of Northern Transylvania to Hungary (known as the Second Vienna Award) on 30 August 1940, the Gigurtu government collapsed.

Beginning in August 1940, prior to this secession, the Iron Guard faction controlled by Sima began to organize for a coup against King Carol II in reaction to the concession of Northern Transylvania. Sima, alongside Nicolae Petrașcu, attempted to organize and arm groups of Legionnaires but managed to only gather about 1000 members willing to sacrifice themselves. On the occasion of the Second Vienna Award, Sima visited German authorities in an attempt to form an Axis-allied nationalist government, but left without success. By September he had prepared a manifesto for distribution and had set the date of the coup to 3 September. Due to a lack of manpower (only 500 of the intended 1,000 Legionnaires participated) the coup was not carried out as planned — Legionnaires and police officers exchanged gunfire and clashed in centres such as Brașov, Constanța and Bucharest, and by the end of the day most Legionnaires had surrendered. Although the coup was unsuccessful, it spurred a number of protests against Carol II, and by 4 September the King had appointed General Ion Antonescu to the position of Prime Minister, thus halting the uprising.

==National Legionary State==

In September 1940, Carol II abdicated and the Iron Guard entered a tense political alliance with General Ion Antonescu, forming what was proclaimed the National Legionary State. At that point, Sima was able to officially return from exile and rise to power as deputy prime minister in the new government, as well as resume his activities as leader of the Iron Guard in Romania. Sima appointed five Legionnaires into ministerial positions within the National Legionary State, and Legionnaires assumed leadership roles as prefects in each of Romania&#x27;s administrative districts. Romanian territorial cessions in the summer of 1940, secretly implemented by his Nazi protectors, offered him the pretext for sparking a wave of xenophobic and antisemitic attacks. As a member of the government, Sima immediately initiated a series of brutal pogroms, assassinations, and de-possessions of Jews and competing politicians.

Tension and issues began to arise in Romania under the Sima-Antonescu partnership, and Antonescu became increasingly frustrated with the Iron Guard, telling Sima that it was now &quot;...time for order and legality&quot; and that Legionnaires would &quot;not [be] allowed to demand audiences with the Ministers whenever they want.&quot; Additionally, Sima had failed to win the total support of his German allies, who feared that the Legionnaires were unprepared to administer the country effectively. Infrastructure in Bucharest began to fail, and following a November earthquake, a number of deaths and the destruction of buildings in the capital further exposed the government&#x27;s disorganization. By the end of 1940, prices fluctuated greatly and crops began to fail, producing 70% less food than the year prior. Frustration from citizens and Legionnaires fell on Sima, and Ion Zelea Codreanu, Corneliu&#x27;s father, referred to Sima as &quot;a Satan, in whom the soul of Stelescu lives&quot; (referencing the dissident Legionnaire Mihai Stelescu, who was accused of plotting to assassinate Codreanu). Sima responded to dissent within the Iron Guard by placing a number of prominent Legionnaires under house arrest, including Corneliu Zelea Codreanu&#x27;s brothers and father. Alongside a group of dissatisfied Legionnaires, the senior Codreanu occupied the Iron Guard&#x27;s Bucharest headquarters, the Casa Verde, and attempted a putsch. A number of Legionnaires also called for Sima&#x27;s assassination. A movement within the Iron Guard soon arose to clear the late Corneliu Zelea Codreanu of his treason charges, and his body was exhumed.

Both Sima and Antonescu were invited by the German government to Obersalzberg to meet with Adolf Hitler in order to mediate relations between the two Romanian leaders and to discuss German-Romanian relations. Sima refused to attend the meeting, citing both apprehension regarding the flight and that he felt it improper for both leaders to leave the country. Thus, Antonescu met with Hitler alone on 14 January 1941. By 17 January, encouraged by Hitler, relations between Antonescu and Sima ceased to exist, and the General had published an open letter denouncing Sima and accusing him of maintaining an &quot;anti-national attitude&quot;.

In January 1941, the Iron Guard, increasingly dissatisfied with their suppression by Antonescu, staged a three-day rebellion, commonly known as the Legionnaire&#x27;s Rebellion. Antonescu prompted Adolf Hitler to choose between the military wing of the Romanian government and the Iron Guard. When Hitler decided to back him over the Guard, Antonescu proceeded with the suppression of the Legion. In the Bucharest pogrom, staged alongside this power struggle, Iron Guardists destroyed synagogues, vandalized and ransacked Jewish homes and stores, and killed and tortured 121 Jews (as well as an additional 30 in smaller towns, specifically in Ploiești and Constanța). In addition to widespread torture and rape of Jews, the Legionary Movement was responsible for the mock &quot;shechita&quot; of five Jews, including a five-year-old girl, who had their stomachs cut open, entrails removed, and were hung from meat hooks and labelled &quot;Kosher&quot; in a Bucharest slaughterhouse. According to then-American minister to Romania, Franklin Mitt Gunther, &quot;Sixty Jewish corpses were discovered on the hooks used for carcasses. They were all skinned... and the quantity of blood about was evidence that they had been skinned alive&quot;.

==Exile==
Unlike most Legionnaires, who were imprisoned by Antonescu following the suppression of the coup attempt, Sima escaped imprisonment. Being secretly housed first at the Sicherheitsdienst headquarters in Bucharest, Sima was evacuated on 23 January and hidden in the home of the Gestapo representative to Romania, but soon moved to his sister&#x27;s residence in Bucharest. Soon after he was again moved by the Sicherheitsdienst to Brașov, and finally to Sibiu, disguised as an SS officer. Sima, alongside a number of other hidden Legionnaires, was able to leave Romania for Germany via Bulgaria, where they were placed in a villa in Berlin, with a large group of Legionnaires living in nearby Berkenbrück. Though at first enjoying freedom of movement in Berlin, Sima and his companions were moved to Berkenbrück on 19 April 1941 and placed under strict surveillance. Meanwhile, Romanian authorities sentenced him (on 16 June 1941) to 12 years hard labour &quot;in absentia&quot; to ensure his permanent exile.

In 1942, Sima escaped and fled to Italy, but was soon extradited back to Germany on the orders of Galeazzo Ciano. In his political journal, on 26 December 1942, Ciano wrote that, &quot;Since [Sima] got out of Germany with a false passport, Himmler demands his extradition. For my part, I advised the Duce to grant his extradition forthwith, especially since his presence here would create friction with Antonescu. And then, all things considered, there will be one less crook.&quot; After travelling to Italy, having disobeyed a contract signed with Germany meant to limit the political activities of the exiled Legionnaires, Sima and the others exiled were imprisoned in a special, humane section of the Buchenwald concentration camp specifically meant for Iron Guard members. By October 1943, Sima had been sentenced once more in Romania, this time to a lifetime of hard labour, a fine of 10,000 lei, and five years of correctional imprisonment.

While interned at Buchenwald, Sima was faced with the dissent of several groups of Legionnaires who distanced themselves from his policies, stating that they did not approve of the way in which he had run the country and the movement, and who began to appeal to the German supervisors for distinctions to be made in their case. , a leading Legionary figure who had served as the undersecretary of the State Department of Finance under the National Legionary State, would later describe Sima as a &quot;terrorist&quot;, noting that he &quot;[took] advantage of and abused... his connections&quot;, and that Sima possessed &quot;non-discipline... [and] a dangerous dilettantism, not to mention infantilism.&quot; Legionnaires increasingly began to blame Sima&#x27;s leadership of the Iron Guard for the death of Codreanu, citing his previous actions as commander in 1938 as &quot;terroristic&quot; and &quot;tumultuous&quot;. This controversy was to enforce the split which is still present in the political legacy of the Iron Guard. By 1943, the Iron Guard — now in exile in Rostock, Germany — had split into at least three distinct groups with separate leadership, not including the Legionnaires who considered Sima their legitimate leader. Sima was transferred to Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg in April 1943, where he would be detained in a prison cell until August 1944.

When Romania changed sides in World War II, joining the Allies in August 1944, Sima was released and instructed to create a pro-Nazi puppet government-in-exile in Vienna, and would broadcast instructions to fascist battalions via German radio. As the Soviet offensive proved unstoppable, he fled to Altaussee under the alias &quot;Josef Weber&quot;. Living in Paris, in Italy, and finally in Spain, he was sentenced to death in Romania in 1946.

During his exile, the question of leadership within the Iron Guard was still a salient issue, and the now-disjointed organization was fraught with infighting and factionalism. In January 1954, Sima was formally and publicly &quot;disowned&quot; by the Legionary Movement through a 13-page document published in &quot;Vatra&quot; magazine after controversy arose over the alleged existence of an illegitimate child: on 6 November 1948, Mardarie Popinciuc, a Romanian living in exile in Argentina, forwarded a letter to Legionary leaders alleging that Sima had illegitimately fathered the child of a fellow Legionnaire identified only as &quot;B&quot; while in France, a claim supposedly backed by the mother of the child and a number of other Legionnaires. The publication of these accusations in &quot;Vatra&quot;, alongside other political tensions, caused the resignation of a number of members of the Guard, as well as the foundation of a new faction named &quot;Moța-Marin&quot; under the leadership of Ovidiu Găină. Central Intelligence Agency documents claim that Sima, in light of these allegations, had originally planned to end his career by parachuting into Romania, where he had previously been sentenced to death following two separate trials. In addition to this split and the formation of the &quot;Moța-Marin&quot; group, there also existed controversies surrounding Sima&#x27;s politics and policies: one splinter group denounced Sima&#x27;s leadership as &quot;reactionary&quot; and &quot;doomed to failure,&quot; and a further number of distinct groups with conflicting ideologies, tactics, and leadership formed.

Until the 1990s, Sima attempted to form connections with mainstream ideologies of anti-Communism, insisting on the Guard&#x27;s allegiance to the Free World. The party oriented itself towards denunciations of Communist Romania, and Sima continued to publish ideological literature in exile in Spain, including a monthly newsletter titled &quot;Țara și Exilul&quot; (&quot;The Country and Exile&quot;), which found readership in Israel, Australia, Germany, and the United States. This adoption of a new image was, in part, successful — beginning in 1949, the United States helped to fund NATO missions to parachute Iron Guard members into Romania in an attempt to undermine the socialist government. Sima and other exiled Guardists participated in the Yaroslav Stetsko-headed Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations as well as the World Anti-Communist League. In Spain, Sima forged close connections with several Francoist and Falangist politicians, including Luis Carrero Blanco and Blas Piñar. He also continued to lead (or be affiliated with) Legionary front organizations in Canada, the United States, Germany, Austria, and France.

After the death of his wife Elvira in 1974, Sima resided with fellow exiled Iron Guard member Gheorghe Costea in Madrid, and the two used funds from publishing and donations as income. From the 1970s onwards, Sima published a series of anti-communist, anti-Masonic, and antisemitic books through Blas Piñar&#x27;s Fuerza Nueva Editorial.

Sima reportedly died in Madrid on 25 May 1993, aged 86, although some sources cite his place of death as Augsburg, Germany. He was buried near his wife Elvira Sima in Torredembarra, near Barcelona, Spain.

<text>USS &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; (LPH-7), the third &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;-class amphibious assault ship (helicopter), was launched by the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard 16 March 1963, sponsored by Zola Shoup, wife of General Shoup, the former Commandant of the Marine Corps; and commissioned 20 July 1963. It was the second ship in the Navy to bear the name.

==Operational history==
Upon completion of sea trials and outfitting, &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; departed Philadelphia to join the Amphibious Forces, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. One of a new class of ships designed from the keel up to embark, transport, and land assault marines by means of helicopters, she lent new strength and flexibility to amphibious operations. After departing Norfolk 23 October 1963 for six weeks&#x27; shakedown training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; steamed to Onslow Beach, North Carolina, 6 December for practice amphibious landings. She then carried on training and readiness operations with the Atlantic Fleet, based in Norfolk until departing for Panama 11 February 1964. Following 2 months on station as flagship for Commander PhibRon 12 with the 12 Marine Expeditionary Unit embarked and ready to land anywhere needed. &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard 26 May, but was deployed again 7 October as a unit of Operation &quot;Steel Pike 1&quot;, a NATO landing exercise on the beaches of southern Spain.

Career highlights include 21 July 1966, when she recovered the Gemini X astronauts and their spacecraft after they landed in the Atlantic east of Cape Kennedy, and 13 March 1969, when she recovered the Apollo 9 capsule and crew off the Bahamas. In October 1985 the ship logged its 100,000th aircraft landing.

In 1987 &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; was leading minesweeping operations in the Persian Gulf when she encountered &quot;Iran Ajr&quot; laying mines in the shipping lanes. Helicopters from &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; attacked the ship; troops from &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; boarded and captured the ship. (&quot;Iran Ajr&quot; was the second enemy warship captured on the high seas by the U.S. Navy since 1815; the first was the , captured in 1944 by the first USS &quot;Guadalcanal&quot;, an escort carrier.) &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; also provided the Marines for the first wave of Operation Provide Comfort, the Kurdish relief operations in Northern Iraq immediately following the Persian Gulf War in 1991.

&quot;Guadalcanal&quot; was decommissioned in 1994, and stored as part of the James River Reserve Fleet until she was used as a target and sunk in the Virginia Capes area on 19 May 2005.

When the ship was being decommissioned, the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum in New York City had tried to acquire &quot;Guadalcanal&quot;, berth her next to the , and use her as a floating heliport to replace the West 30th Street Heliport. The plan was abandoned in 1996 after local residents objected that &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; would block their views of the Hudson River.

==Other incidents==

On 1 November 1966, a UH-2B Seasprite helicopter assigned to the ship crashed as it was taking off from the flight deck. &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; was in the Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, VA to start a major overhaul at the time. Three Navy men and one civilian shipyard worker were killed and 12 others were hospitalized. Nine more sailors and civilians were treated for minor injuries.

On 9 May 1968 she floated adrift off North Carolina due to a burned out bearing in the propulsion system.

On 27 January 1976 she went aground in Augusta Bay, Sicily on a peak of coral which pushed in areas on either side of the bow, but did not crack or hole the ship. Three days later, with cargo, personnel, helicopters, and fuel off-loaded to assist the effort, the ship was refloated.

On 17 September 1981 near Sardinia, Italy, a USMC CH-53D helicopter crashed while attempting to land aboard the ship during training exercises killing all five crewmen.

On 24 September 1981 &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; and the , collided during underway replenishment south of Sardinia, Italy, causing minor damage but no injuries.

On 25 May 1993 &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; and the USS &quot;Monongahela&quot; (AO-178), collided during underway replenishment off of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina when &quot;Guadalcanal&quot;&#x27;s main gyrocompass failed. Five crew suffered minor injuries and $1.635M in damage was caused to the two ships.

<text>The Hunters Point Naval Shipyard was a United States Navy shipyard in San Francisco, California, located on of waterfront at Hunters Point in the southeast corner of the city.

Originally, Hunters Point was a commercial shipyard established in 1870, consisting of two graving docks. It was purchased and built up in the late 19th and early 20th century by the Union Iron Works company, later owned by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Company and named Hunters Point Drydocks, located at Potrero Point.
Known as &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Shipping Yard&quot;, President Theodore Roosevelt trusted his Great White Fleet of battleships to be serviced at Hunters Point in 1907 according to historical records.

The shipyard was purchased by the Navy in 1940, a year before the attack on Pearl Harbor. It began operations the next year as the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, and operated until 1974 when it was deactivated and renamed Hunters Point Naval Shipyard. Used commercially for a time, in 1986 it was taken over by the Navy again as the home port of the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; battlegroup, under the name Treasure Island Naval Station Hunters Point Annex.

The base was named redundant as part of the Base Realignment and Closure effort in 1991, and was closed permanently in 1994. Since then the site has been part of a superfund cleanup effort to remediate the remains of decades of industrial and radiological use. Parcels have been sold as they were remediated, mostly for condominium development.

== History ==
The original docks were built on solid rock. In 1916 the drydocks were thought to be the largest in the world. At over 1000 feet in length, they were said to be big enough to accommodate the world&#x27;s largest warships and passenger steamers. Soundings showed an offshore depth of 65 feet. During the early 20th century much of the Hunters Point shoreline was extended by landfill extensions into the San Francisco Bay.

Between World War I and the beginning of World War II the Navy contracted with the private owners for the use of the docks. The docks provided deep-water facilities between San Diego and Bremerton, Washington. The main naval base in the area was at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, but silting in the area made it only suitable for shallow-draft ships. A Congressional hearing on Pacific Coast Naval Bases was held in San Francisco in 1920 at San Francisco City Hall, wherein city representatives, Mayor Rolph, City Engineer O&#x27;Shaughnessy and others testified on behalf of permanently siting the Navy at Hunters Point.

===Navy purchase===

At the start of WWII the Navy recognized the need for greatly increased naval shipbuilding and repair facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area, and in 1940 acquired the property from the private owners, naming it Hunters Point Naval Shipyard. A bill that would have set aside $6 million for the purchase of the Hunters Point property from Bethlehem Steel was deferred in March 1939. The property became one of the major shipyards of the west coast. It was later renamed Treasure Island Naval Station Hunters Point Annex. During the 1940s, many workers moved into the area to work at this shipyard and other wartime related industries.

The key fissile components of the first atomic bomb were loaded onto in July 1945 at Hunters Point for transfer to Tinian. After World War II and until 1969, the Hunters Point shipyard was the site of the Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory, the US military&#x27;s largest facility for applied nuclear research. The yard was used after the war to decontaminate ships from Operation Crossroads. Because of all the testing, there is widespread radiological contamination of the site. After the war, with an influx of blue collar industry, the area remained a naval base and commercial shipyard.

In 1947 the Hunter&#x27;s Point crane completed construction at the site by the American Bridge Company. It was the largest crane in the world, and was intended to be used to remove the turrets of battleships so the guns could be quickly replaced while the old set was being refurbished on land. The Hunter&#x27;s Point crane succeeded &quot;YD-171&quot;, better known as &quot;Herman the German&quot;, as the largest crane in America.

In 1959 the gantry crane was the site of Operation Skycatch, where dummy Polaris missiles were fired and caught via a string of arresting cables, before being lowered to the ground for testing. Previous versions of the test had the missiles flung out into the bay and retrieved from the ocean floor. 

A large trapezoidal frame was erected atop the gantry crane for the UGM-73 Poseidon missile test facility; the structural members were lifted by Marine Boss in 1967. The addition of the frame brought the total height of the crane to nearly . The crane dominates the landscape in the area, as it is easily visible from miles around.

===Pacific Reserve Fleet, Hunters Point===
Pacific Reserve Fleet, Hunters Point, also called Pacific Reserve Fleet, Hunters Point Group, was a United States Navy reserve fleet at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard. The mothball fleet of World War II ships was next to the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard. Some ships there were reactivated for the Korean War and Vietnam War.

===Navy closure===
The Navy operated the yard as a repair facility until 1974, when it leased most of it to a commercial ship repair company, who used it until 1986. A copy of the planned closure list was obtained by the Associated Press in 1973. The Hunters Point Shipyard was reactivated briefly between 1986 and 1989 as an annex to Naval Station Treasure Island.

The Hunters Point Shipyard Artists (HPSA) is a community of artists who rent studios in the former U.S. naval shipyard on Hunters Point in the Bayview community of San Francisco. An artist community since 1983, the Hunters Point Shipyard is now home to more than 250 artists.
In 1987, the Navy considered reopening the shipyard as the home port for the newly reactivated , which would move from Long Beach. Rear Admiral Robert L. Toney and Mayor Dianne Feinstein signed an agreement that committed San Francisco to spend up to $1 million per year to maintain the infrastructure, including dredging and traffic improvements. After Feinstein was succeeded as mayor by Art Agnos, Agnos declared his opposition to the new home port, stating the costs would outweigh potential benefits. A referendum was held on the issue in the November 1988 general election. One proposition offered support for the Navy&#x27;s plan, and another proposition, sponsored by Agnos, stated the infrastructure costs would be borne by the Navy, and 351 new civilian jobs were required to be created. Despite the passage of the proposition supporting the Navy&#x27;s plan, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) recommended building the base for &quot;Missouri&quot; at Long Beach, San Diego, or Pearl Harbor. In 1989, the base was declared a Superfund site requiring long-term clean-up.
===BRAC, remediation of environmental contamination, 1994===
in 1994, the Navy closed the shipyard and base as part of the next round of Base Realignment and Closure recommendations. Besides radioactive contamination, Hunter&#x27;s Point had a succession of coal- and oil-fired power generation facilities which left a legacy of pollution, both from smokestack effluvium and leftover byproducts that were dumped in the vicinity. The BRAC program has managed the majority of the site&#x27;s numerous pollution remediation projects.

=== Shipyard Redevelopment ===

As of August 2020, the former shipyard site is still being decontaminated, and has been split into multiple parcels to allow the Navy to declare them clean and safe for redevelopment separately. While Lennar has built and sold hundreds of new condominium units on the property, regulators, activists, and cleanup workers have claimed that the site is still heavily contaminated and that Tetra Tech, the company contracted to handle the cleanup and testing, has repeatedly violated established cleanup protocols, deliberately falsified radiation test results at the site to falsely show that there is little remaining radiation, and fired employees who attempted to force workers to perform radiation tests as required. According to an article published in 2017, the Navy stated that at least 386 out of the 25,000+ soil samples that have been collected over the past two decades were identified as &quot;anomalous.&quot;
New homes built on the property were set to be available to tenants in the winter of 2014/2015. The first residents began moving into homes in June 2015.

In September 2016, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) halted the transfer of additional land at Hunters Point from the Navy to the city and to real estate developers. Per a letter sent from the EPA to the Navy, the process was placed on hold until &quot;the actual potential public exposure to radioactive material at and near&quot; the shipyard can be &quot;clarified.&quot;

===Proposition P, 2000===

In 2000, San Francisco voters passed Proposition P in a landslide, with 86% voting &quot;yes&quot;. The proposition stated that the Navy would be responsible for cleaning up the shipyard to the highest standard. The year after the proposition passed, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed, and the mayor signed, a resolution titled &quot;Adoption of Proposition P as Official City Policy for the Environmental Remediation of Hunters Point Shipyard.&quot; The resolution made it clear that it was the city&#x27;s policy that Hunters Point &quot;be cleaned to a level which would enable the unrestricted use of the property - the highest standard for cleanup established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.&quot; The Navy modified its Record of Decision (ROD) for Parcel B of Hunters Point Shipyard, which weakened the cleanup standards for the parcel. Despite this, the Navy still found contamination levels higher than its cleanup standards, and in 2009 moved to rework its entire cleanup strategy for the parcel. The Navy once again amended the ROD for Parcel B, this time to change its remediation strategy from removing all contaminated soils from the parcel to installing covers in the soil as a means of suppressing the contamination. By abandoning its commitment to pursue a remediation effort based on cleanup, the Navy also abandoned its commitment to clean up Hunters Point to unrestricted residential release standards.

In Parcel G the Navy followed a similar pattern of disregarding Proposition P, and therefore San Francisco city policy, by lowering cleanup standards and shifting the future land use of the area. The 2009 ROD for Parcel G outlined its future use as mostly industrial, and therefore required lower cleanup standards than a parcel set for residential use. In 2017, the Navy released an Explanation of Significant Differences for the Parcel G ROD which stated that the parcel would be zoned largely for residential use. This shift occurred without tightening the cleanup standards to a residential level; the Navy instead put &quot;action levels&quot; in place, which are still lower than the criteria for residential use. In Parcel C and Parcel E the Navy bypassed its commitment to a full cleanup as outlined by Proposition P, relying instead on soil covers and &#x27;institutional controls&#x27;. Under the National Contingency Plan (NCP), which is the central regulating process for governing Superfund sites, community acceptance is one of the nine criteria for establishing cleanup requirements. The text of Proposition P and the Board of Supervisors resolution adopting it as city policy references the NCP and the community acceptance provision. The proposition and the resolution both make clear that the community is committed to the highest level of cleanup. Thus, the Navy, by refusing to establish cleanup standards that allow for unrestricted residential use, is violating federal superfund law under CERCLA and putting future residents of Hunters Point at risk. 
===Attempts to reinstate the RAB, 2020===
In 2020, the Navy BRAC decision not to reestablish the Restoration Advisory Board was based on a limited survey return of 40 respondents, which did not match the response of over 200 petitioners who signed the community-led initiative to reestablish the RAB. Biomonitoring funded by the Lucile Packard Foundation for Children&#x27;s Health detected thallium and manganese in high frequency among shipyard workers and residents.

She holds the degrees of MA, PhD, and LittD from the University of Cambridge.

McKitterick&#x27;s doctoral thesis was entitled &quot;The Carolingian Renaissance: A Study in the Education of a Society&quot;. It was submitted under McKitterick&#x27;s maiden name of Pierce. The thesis was approved on 24 February 1976. McKitterick&#x27;s supervisor was Walter Ullmann.

==Academic career==
In 1971 she returned to Cambridge University to pursue her career. She was a Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge and then became a professorial fellow of Sidney Sussex College. McKitterick has been described as a &quot;doyenne in her field; her decades of tireless research and teaching have been poured into a steady stream of major publications on Carolingian subjects.&quot; Thomas F. X. Noble considers McKitterick to be &quot;one of the most original and productive historians of Europe&#x27;s early Middle Ages&quot;. She has supervised 42 PhD theses to completion, as of October 2015, with five more in progress. She has been a member of the council of the British School at Rome.

==Honours==
McKitterick was a Balsdon Fellow at the British School in Rome, April–June 2002. Her research focus was &quot;Charlemagne in Italy&quot;. From 2005 to 2006 she was a Fellow at the Netherlands Institute of Advanced Study.

In 2010 McKitterick was awarded the Dr A. H. Heineken International Prize for History by the Royal Dutch Academy. The prize was established in 1990 and is awarded bi-annually for outstanding scholarly achievement in the field of history. Other awardees include Judith Herrin and Aleida Assman. In 2015 McKitterick was elected to the Lectio Chair at the Katholieke Universiteit of Leuven&#x27;s Centre for the Transmission of Texts and Ideas in Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance.

On 16 March 2017, McKitterick was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA). She is also an elected Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA). She was the President of the Ecclesiastical History Society (2018–19). McKitterick is a Fellow of the Medieval Academy of America, Monumenta Germaniae Historica, and the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

On 15 October 2018 McKitterick delivered the James Lydon Lecture in Medieval History and Culture at Trinity College Dublin with &quot;Rome and the Invention of the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages&quot;.

In 2018 McKitterick was honoured with a &quot;Festschrift&quot;, &quot;Writing the Early Medieval West&quot;, to mark her retirement in September 2016. The volume consists of contributions from fifteen of McKitterick&#x27;s former students.

==Personal life==
She married David McKitterick, Librarian of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1976. They have one daughter.

<text>Hans Küng (; 19 March 1928 – 6 April 2021) was a Swiss Catholic priest, theologian, and author. From 1995 he was president of the Foundation for a Global Ethic (Stiftung Weltethos).

Küng was ordained a priest in 1954, joined the faculty of the University of Tübingen in 1960, and served as a theological adviser during the Second Vatican Council. In 1978, after he rejected the doctrine of papal infallibility, he was not allowed to continue teaching as a Catholic theologian, but he remained at Tübingen as a professor of ecumenical theology until he retired with the title professor emeritus in 1996. He remained a Catholic priest until his death. He supported the spiritual substance of religion, while questioning traditional dogmatic Christianity. He published &quot;Christianity and the world religions: paths of dialogue with Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism&quot; in 1986, wrote &quot;Dying with Dignity&quot; together with Walter Jens in 1998, and signed the appeal &quot;Church 2011, The Need for a New Beginning&quot;. He was awarded honorific doctorates internationally, and received numerous awards including the Otto Hahn Peace Medal in 2008.

== Life and work ==
===Education===
Küng was born in Sursee, Canton of Lucerne. He was the eldest of seven siblings; his father managed a shoe store. He studied philosophy and theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and was ordained in 1954. He said his first Mass in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica preaching to the Swiss guard, many of whom he knew personally. He continued his education in various European institutions, including the Sorbonne and the Institut Catholique de Paris, where he obtained a doctorate in theology in 1957. He then did pastoral work in Lucerne for two years. At the invitation of Karl Barth, he delivered a lecture on the prospects for reform of the Catholic Church—he was very optimistic—just a week before Pope John XXIII announced his plans for a council in January 1959.

===Career===
Küng taught for a year at the University of Münster and then, in 1960, he was appointed professor of fundamental theology at the University of Tübingen in Germany. He launched his writing career that same year with &quot;The Council, Reform and Reunion&quot; in which he outlined much of what became the program of the upcoming council; it proved a bestseller in several countries. In 1962 he was appointed &quot;peritus&quot; by Pope John XXIII, serving as the youngest (34) expert theological advisor to participants in the Second Vatican Council until its conclusion in 1965. At Küng&#x27;s instigation, the Catholic faculty at Tübingen appointed another &quot;peritus&quot;, Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI, as professor of dogmatic theology.

During a 1963 tour of the United States, Küng gave the lecture &quot;The Church and Freedom&quot; to enthusiastic audiences of more than 25,000 at several universities around the country, but was not allowed to appear at the Catholic University of America. He received the first of many honorary doctorates from the Jesuits&#x27; St. Louis University that year, but the school was chastised for not getting Rome&#x27;s permission to do so. In April 1963, he accepted an invitation to visit John F. Kennedy at the White House, where Kennedy introduced him to a group of politicians saying &quot;this is what I would call a new frontier man of the Catholic Church&quot;.

Küng&#x27;s doctoral thesis was published in English in 1964 as &quot;Justification: The Doctrine of Karl Barth&quot;. It identified a number of areas of agreement between Barthian and Catholic theologies of justification, concluding that the differences were not fundamental and did not warrant a division in the Church. (The book included a letter from Karl Barth attesting that he agreed with Küng&#x27;s representation of his theology. Barth however did not agree with Küng&#x27;s conclusion that the Reformation was an overreaction.) In this book Küng argued that Barth, like Martin Luther, overreacted against the Catholic Church which, despite its imperfections, has been and remains the body of Christ. Veteran newsperson Patricia Lefevere, writing for the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;, says the Holy Office &quot;opened a secret file (the infamous 399/57i) on Küng shortly after he wrote [this book]&quot;.
In the late 1960s, he became the first major Catholic theologian since the late 19th century Old Catholic Church schism to publicly reject the doctrine of papal infallibility in his book &quot;Infallible? An Inquiry&quot; (1971). It was published three years after the Vatican had first asked Küng to address accusations against his earlier volume, &quot;The Church&quot;. After the publication of &quot;Infallible&quot;, Vatican officials requested he appear in Rome to answer charges. Küng stood his ground, demanding to see the file the church had amassed and to speak with whoever was evaluating his work. But Küng had also criticized celibacy, wanted to open the clergy and the diaconate to women, called the ban on dispensations for priests who wanted to leave the priesthood &quot;a violation of human rights&quot;, and had written that current Catholic practices &quot;contradicted the Gospel and ancient Catholic tradition and ought to be abolished&quot;. On 18 December 1979, he was stripped of his license to teach as a Catholic theologian. Sixty American and Canadian theologians protested the Vatican action and contradicted the Vatican&#x27;s ruling by saying: &quot;We publicly affirm our recognition that he is indeed a Roman Catholic theologian.&quot; A thousand students at Tübingen held a candlelight vigil in protest. Küng later described the Vatican&#x27;s ruling as &quot;my personal experience of the Inquisition&quot;. Lefevere writes that:
 He remained a priest. Since he could no longer teach on Tübingen&#x27;s Catholic faculty, the university removed the Institute for Ecumenical Research, which Küng had founded and had headed since the 1960s, along with his professorship, outside of that faculty&#x27;s jurisdiction. Küng continued to teach as a tenured professor of ecumenical theology until his retirement in 1996.

While a guest professor at the University of Chicago for three months in 1981, he was invited to only one Catholic institution, the University of Notre Dame. He appeared on the Phil Donahue Show. In October 1986, he participated in the Third Buddhist–Christian Theological Encounter held at Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana. Küng said his inter-faith studies &quot;solidified his own roots in a living faith in Christ&quot; which he said lasted his entire career. &quot;Indeed, Küng long held that steadfastness in one&#x27;s own faith and a capacity for dialogue with those of another belief are complementary virtues&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Küng initiated a project called &quot;Weltethos&quot; (&quot;Global Ethic&quot;), which is an attempt at describing what the world&#x27;s religions have in common (rather than what separates them) and at drawing up a minimal code of rules of behaviour that everyone can accept. His vision of a global ethic was embodied in the document &quot;Towards a Global Ethic: An Initial Declaration&quot;. This Declaration was signed at the 1993 Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions by religious and spiritual leaders from around the world. Later Küng&#x27;s project would culminate in the United Nations Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations (2001) to which Küng was assigned as one of 19 &quot;eminent persons&quot;. Even though it was completed shortly after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 (in September 2001), it was not covered in the U.S. media, a fact about which Küng complained.

In 1986, he met in person with Charles Curran, a theologian who was then being threatened with the loss of his license to teach as a Catholic theologian. He encouraged Curran to continue his work and shared his experience of support and betrayal by his colleagues. In the 1990s, Küng spoke out on behalf of fellow Catholic theologian Eugen Drewermann who lost his license to teach Catholic theology and was suspended as a priest because he, like Küng, challenged dogmatic structures. Küng delivered the laudatio when Drewermann was awarded the Herbert-Haag-Prize for Freedom in the Church in 1992 at the University of Tübingen. Years later when the possible beatification of Pope John Paul II was under consideration, Küng objected that his was &quot;an authoritarian pontificate which suppressed the rights of both women and theologians&quot;. He said John Paul&#x27;s treatment of Latin American liberation theologians like Gustavo Gutiérrez and Leonardo Boff was unchristian.

In March 1991, he gave a talk titled &quot;No Peace Among Nations until Peace Among the Religions&quot; at UCSD&#x27;s Price Center. He visited the nearby Beth El synagogue and spoke there on modern German–Jewish relations.

In 2003, Küng saw the beatification of Pope Pius IX as evidence of the degeneration of canonizations to &quot;gestures of church politics&quot;.

Küng made more than a dozen attempts to meet with Pope John Paul without success. On 26 September 2005, he had a friendly discussion over dinner at Castel Gandolfo with Pope Benedict XVI, avoiding topics of obvious disagreement and focusing instead of Küng&#x27;s interreligious and cultural work. The pope acknowledged his efforts to contribute to a renewed recognition of crucial human moral values in dialogue between religions as well as with secular reason. Küng reported that Benedict himself authored the Vatican&#x27;s statement about their meeting; he said &quot;I approved every word&quot;.

In a 2009 interview with &quot;Le Monde&quot;, Küng sharply criticised Pope Benedict for lifting the excommunications of four bishops of the Society of Saint Pius X. He blamed the pope&#x27;s lifelong isolation from contemporary society and said that as a consequence of Benedict&#x27;s desire for a smaller and purer church &quot;the church risks becoming a sect&quot;. His remarks drew a rebuke from Cardinal Angelo Sodano, dean of the College of Cardinals.

In April 2010, he published an open letter to all Catholic bishops in which he criticized Pope Benedict&#x27;s handling of liturgical, collegial, and inter-religious issues and also the sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church. He further called on bishops to consider six proposals, ranging from speaking up and working on regional solutions to calling for another Vatican council.

He was a signatory of Church 2011, &quot;The Need for a New Beginning&quot;, a German-language memorandum demanding reform of the Catholic Church that was promulgated by Catholic theology professors.

Küng died at home in Tübingen on 6 April 2021 at the age of 93. The Pontifical Academy for Life tweeted: &quot;Disappears a great figure in the theology of the last century, whose ideas and analyzes must always make us reflect on the Catholic Church, the Churches, the society, the culture.&quot; His fellow theologian Charles Curran, who had experienced similar treatment by the Vatican, described Küng as &quot;the strongest voice for reform in the Catholic Church during the last 60 years&quot; and wrote that he was so prolific that &quot;I do not know of anyone who was ever able to even read all that he had written.&quot;

In October 2021 Inge Jens, widow of Küng&#x27;s close friend and colleague Walter Jens, confirmed that he had a life partner, who lived in his house.

===Works===
In &quot;On Being a Christian&quot; (1974), Küng traces Christianity to its roots, extensively using modern scholarship to extract from the Gospels what can be known of the historical Jesus. Rather than beginning with the teaching of Church councils and the highly developed theological propositions propounded from human authorities, he asked if an alternative were possible: &quot;Would it not perhaps correspond more to the New Testament evidence and to modern man&#x27;s historical way of thinking if we started out like the first disciples from the real human being Jesus, his historical message and manifestation, his life and fate, his historical reality and historical activity, and then ask about the relationship of this human being Jesus to God, about his unity with the Father?&quot;

In 1998, he published &quot;Dying with Dignity&quot;, co-written with Walter Jens, in which he affirmed acceptance of euthanasia from a Christian viewpoint.

In 2005, Küng published a critical article in Italy and Germany on &quot;The failures of Pope Wojtyla&quot; in which he argued that the world had expected a period of conversion, reform, and dialogue but, instead, John Paul II offered a restoration of the pre-Vatican II status, blocking reform and inter-church dialogue, and reasserting the absolute dominion of Rome.

Based on his &quot;Studium Generale&quot; lectures at Tübingen University, in &quot;Der Anfang aller Dinge&quot; (&quot;The beginning of all things&quot;) he discussed the relationship between science and religion. In an analysis ranging from quantum physics to neuroscience, he also commented on the debate about evolution in the United States, dismissing those opposed to the teaching of evolution as &quot;naive [and] un-enlightened&quot;.

In his 2010 book &quot;Was ich glaube&quot;, he described his own personal relationship with nature, and how he learned to observe it correctly, which meant drawing strength from God&#x27;s creation without falling victim to a false and fanatic love of nature.

In 2013, Küng wrote in &quot;Erlebte Menschlichkeit&quot; (&quot;Experienced Humanity&quot;) that he believed people had the right to end their own lives if physical illness, pain, or dementia made living unbearable. He indicated he was considering the option of assisted suicide for himself because he was suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and was losing the ability to see and write. Küng wrote that he did not wish to follow the example of Pope John Paul II.

<doc id="587937" wikidata="Q7869893" url="?curid=587937" title="USS Guam (LPH-9)">
<text>USS &quot;Guam&quot; (LPH-9), was an &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;-class amphibious assault ship, and was laid down by the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 15 November 1962; launched on 22 August 1964, sponsored by Mrs. Vaughn H. Emory Green, and commissioned on 16 January 1965. She was the third US Navy ship to carry the name, after the US Territory of Guam.

==1960s==

After fitting out and builder&#x27;s trials, the new amphibious assault ship joined the U.S. Atlantic Fleet on 21 April 1965 and sailed for Norfolk, her homeport. Arriving Hampton Roads the next day for training off the Virginia Capes, she departed Hampton Roads for underway training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

&quot;Guam&quot; returned to Norfolk on 5 July 1965 for intensive amphibious training. She sailed from Hampton Roads on 29 November 1965 to participate in amphibious and anti-submarine warfare exercises en route to the Caribbean. On 10 December 1965, &quot;Guam&quot; joined the Amphibious Ready Squadron in the Caribbean as flagship for Amphibious Squadron 12. There she operated at peak readiness to protect the peace and security of the Caribbean and Central America.
From 16 to 28 February 1966, &quot;Guam&quot; patrolled south of the Dominican Republic ready to land forces on the volatile island of Hispaniola if necessary. She conducted amphibious exercises until entering Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 1 June 1966 for post shakedown availability.

She departed Philadelphia on 2 August 1966 and prepared for service as the primary recovery ship for the Gemini 11 space flight. On 15 September, at 0959 EDT, &quot;Guam&quot; recovered Astronauts Pete Conrad and Dick Gordon east of Cape Kennedy. From 28 November to 12 December, &quot;Guam&quot; participated in Exercise &quot;Lantflex 66&quot;, and on the latter date became flagship of Amphibious Squadron 8 and Caribbean Amphibious Ready Group.

==1970s==

In the summer of 1971, &quot;Guam&quot; was chosen as a test vessel for Admiral Elmo Zumwalt&#x27;s Sea Control Ship concept. This ship was to operate a few VSTOL fighters and some ASW helicopters in order to free up supercarriers from convoy duty during a conflict with the Soviet Union. On 18 January 1972, she began extensive testing and in 1974 deployed in the Atlantic as a sea control ship with Marine Corps AV-8A Harrier VSTOL fighters and Sea King ASW helicopters. &quot;Guam&quot; completed the SCS tests and reassumed her role as an Amphibious Assault Ship on 1 July 1974. In October 1974 her aircraft complement, operated by the US Marine Corps, comprised six AV-8A, eight CH-46F Sea Knights, five CH-53D Sea Stallions and two Bell UH-1N Iroquis utility helicopters.
On 17 January 1977, in Barcelona, Spain, a landing craft being used as a liberty boat by USS &quot;Trenton&quot; and USS &quot;Guam&quot;, was run over by a freighter. The Mike8 boat capsized and came to rest against the fleet landing pier. Crewmembers from both vessels were on hand to assist with rescue operations. There were over one hundred sailors and marines on board the landing craft. 49 sailors and marines were killed. A memorial is erected at the landing pier in memory.

==1980s==
While operating 50 km southeast of Morehead City, North Carolina (USA), on 19 July 1981, a Sikorsky CH-53 &quot;Sea Stallion&quot; helicopter crashed into another CH-53 and a Bell UH-1N &quot;Twin Huey&quot; on landing. 4 crewmen died and 10 were injured.

Guam deployed to Beirut in 1982 for the Lebanese civil war as part of a multi-national peacekeeping force.

In October 1983, bound for another stint off the coast of Lebanon, she was redirected to the Caribbean to serve as the flagship for Operation Urgent Fury, the invasion of Grenada. Vice Adm. Joseph P. Metcalf III and his command team of 50 directed the week-long invasion from the flag plot of the Guam, a control center designed to accommodate one quarter that number. After operations in Grenada, she continued onto Lebanon with Amphibious Squadron Four/22nd Marine Amphibious Unit embarked, finally returning to CONUS on 1 May 1984.

In early 1985, the ship was drydocked at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and given a massive overhaul lasting several months. Two Phalanx CIWS were added to the ship at this time.

On 28 January 1986, the USS &quot;Guam&quot; was steaming south from Norfolk, VA en route to Operational Trials, &quot;Oppies&quot;, in the Caribbean sea when, while many crewmen were watching it on TV, the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; blew up just 750 miles South of their location off the coast of FL. USS &quot;Guam&quot; recovered many floating pieces of debris from the disaster, including a nose-cone from one of the booster rockets. For her around-the-clock efforts in the recovery mission her crew earned a Joint Navy/Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Citation.

May through November 1986 she was deployed on MARG 2–86 in the Mediterranean. During this deployment, the ship was damaged while sailing through a tropical storm off the East Coast of the United States while en route to Rota, Spain. Gross command error had decided to sail directly through the storm, rather than go around it (a very similar event took place off the N.C. coast in 1983). A sailor on an escort ship was killed in a fall (not verified:https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/NHC/accidents.htm). Waves stripped the decking from the fantail, normally 50 ft above the water. All personnel were confined to racks for three days due to immense rocking. The ship stayed at port in Toulon, France for almost three weeks for repairs.

==1990s and fate==

She departed from Norfolk in August 1990, under the command of Captain Chuck Saffell, to deploy to the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm.

On 2 January 1991, the &quot;Guam&quot; along with the USS &quot;Trenton&quot; were dispatched from anchorage off Oman to Somalia to airlift the US embassy in Somalia&#x27;s capital Mogadishu, which had been suddenly enveloped by violence when rebels entered the city and the central government collapsed. On 5–6 January 281 US and foreign nationals were airlifted from the embassy, including all of the embassy&#x27;s staff along with diplomats from several nations (notably, the Soviet ambassador to Somalia and 38 Soviet diplomats). The vessels returned to Oman and the evacuees disembarked on 11 January, ending Operation Eastern Exit.

In 1993, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet.

In 1996, the USS &quot;Guam&quot; supported the 22nd MEU in Operation Assured Response off the coast of Liberia.

In addition to the MEU&#x27;s Aviation Combat Element&#x27;s helicopter load out, the MEU had a CONUS standby package of 4 AV-8Bs (Harriers) that &quot;Guam&quot; was capable of adding to the flight deck in support of contingency operations. She also conducted Harrier ops as part of the deployment work-up on a regular basis with the exception of the final voyage from September 1997 through April 1998. The last operation conducted was in May 1998 before the final ammunition offload at Naval Weapon Station Yorktown.

The &quot;USS Guam&quot; was decommissioned on 25 August 1998 and spent several months at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard while the Navy decided what to do with the ship. &quot;Guam&quot; was disposed of as a target off the US east coast on 16 October 2001. The SINKEX was conducted by the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; Battle Group. USNS &quot;Mohawk&quot; towed her out to sea and a carrier air wing operating from &quot;Kennedy&quot; conducted SINKEX. She took over 12 hours to sink most likely due to all watertight compartments sealed by the decommissioning crew. The exact location was 031° 14&#x27; 22.0&quot; North, 071° 16&#x27; 35.0&quot; West.

Her dual 3&quot;/50cal Mk33 anti aircraft mount is preserved at the Mesa-Arizona Commemoration Air Force Museum. Gemini 11 is now on display at California Science Centre in Los Angeles.

<text>Watu Gunung is a figure in the foundation mythology of the Indonesian island of Java. He is a descendant of the gods, the son of King Palindriya of Gilingwesi and Dewi Sinta. One day, when he is very young, his mother scolds him for troubling her. This upsets him, and he runs away to live in another kingdom. After he grows up, he overthrows the king of that kingdom and takes the throne, but not before the king has cursed him. Not knowing his own parentage, he invades Gilingwesi in order to marry the reputedly beautiful wives of king Palindriya. He then marries his mother, Dewi Sinta, and his aunt/stepmother, Dewi Landep, and has 27 sons by them. The true identity of the incestuous parties is eventually uncovered. Watu Gunung, who is already virtually indestructible because of his godly nature, becomes more and more arrogant, and builds an iron city to live in. The other gods, resenting his pride, go to war with him. In some versions of the myth, he is betrayed by his kinfolk, who tell the enemy about his single vulnerability. Ultimately, peace is secured and Watu Gunung, his wives and children all ascend to heaven. Lessa describes the story as containing elements of Oedipal type.

<doc id="587943" wikidata="Q10573277" url="?curid=587943" title="MK Indy">
<text>The MK Indy is a Lotus 7 replica based on the Locost principle, production started in 1997 and built by MK Sportscars in Maltby, Rotherham. The Indy has an independent rear suspension using the differential and drive shafts from a Ford Sierra. It uses many other components from the Sierra, including front hubs and steering rack. Further, it can be fitted with any of a variety of engines, the most popular choices being the Ford Pinto engine from the Sierra for its ease and cheapness or a large motorcycle engine for its light weight and high rpm.

Resurrected in November 2016, the company is now based in Braintree, Essex with a more modern take on the build. 
By using the engine and running gear from the NB Mazda MX-5, the updated MK Indy RX-5 ignites the spark from the little Japanese engine once more. 
The mixture of a low price entry kit and the options from there on, allows for a perfect B-road cruiser to an ultimate track weapon. 

The newer form of the MK Indy, now houses one of two huge power-plants;
The Honda Civic Type-R V-tec K20 engine or the vicious Suzuki Hayabusa 1340cc motorbike engine. 

Updates to the chassis have made the car more nimble and precise than ever, propelling the car to enter into race track domination.
The Cup 200 car begins its racing journey with the 750 Motor Club in April 2023 with sights set on having a full MK Cup 200 grid, opening the door for a pure skill based event to rival all.

<text>Harris Lake, or Shearon Harris Reservoir, is a reservoir in New Hill, North Carolina, approximately 20 miles southwest of Raleigh, the state capitol. Lying above sea level, the lake covers in southwestern Wake County and southeastern Chatham County. It is the source and outlet of cooling water for the Shearon Harris nuclear power plant. The lake is approximately 2.5 miles from B. Everett Jordan Lake. It was created by impounding Buckhorn Creek. There are two public boat ramps; one is near the southern end off North Carolina Highway 42, and the other near the northern end by Avent Ferry Road.

Harris Lake County Park is located on the northeastern section of the lake. The park was leased to Wake County by Duke Energy in 1985, and opened to the public in 1999. The 680-acre park features five miles of hiking trails, almost eight miles of bike trails, and other amenities including picnic areas, a fishing pier, and a disc golf course. The park is home to several historic sites from an agricultural community, including the remains of the Womble, Smith, and Holleman households. The park also protects valuable Longleaf Pine forests.

<doc id="587953" wikidata="Q5150169" url="?curid=587953" title="Columbus Zoo and Aquarium">
<text>The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium is a non-profit zoo located near Powell in Liberty Township, Delaware County, Ohio, United States, north of the city of Columbus. The land lies along the eastern banks of the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Reservoir on the Scioto River, at the intersection of Riverside Drive and Powell Road. It has a worldwide reputation, largely attributable to the efforts and promotion of director emeritus Jack Hanna. In 2009, it was named by the USA Travel Guide as the number one zoo in the United States. It was also ranked number one best zoo in 2012 by Besties Readers Choice.

The Columbus Zoo is home to more than 7,000 animals representing over 800 species and sees over 2 million visitors annually. The animal exhibits are divided into regions of the world, with the zoo currently operating eight such regions. In addition the zoo owns an 18-hole golf course, known as the Safari Golf Club which encompasses . The zoo also owns Zoombezi Bay which encompasses . In total, the zoo owns of land, with dedicated to the zoo itself.

The zoo operates its own conservation program, donating money to outside programs as well as participating in their own conservation efforts. Over the past five years the zoo has contributed over $3.3 million to more than 70 projects in 30 countries. The zoo also has a close working relationship with the Wilds, a animal conservation center located in southeast Ohio and featured on the Columbus Zoo&#x27;s website.

Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, and by extension The Wilds, are prominently featured in the Nat Geo Wild series &quot;Secrets of the Zoo&quot;, a series focusing on various activities done with the animals in the zoo.
==History==

=== Early history ===

The first zoo in Columbus, known as &quot;the Zoo&quot; was operated by the Columbus Zoological Company (not affiliated with today&#x27;s Columbus Zoo). It was located in the present-day Old Beechwold Historic District in Clintonville. The zoo opened in May 1905 but closed for unknown reasons only five months later in October 1905. The former monkey house can still be seen on the property of 150 West Beechwold Boulevard where it is used as a barn. The zoo&#x27;s original brick entrance can also be seen on North High Street at Beechwold Road.

The present Columbus Zoo opened in 1927 as Riverside Park on 21-acres by the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Reservoir. The zoo was initially conceived by Harry P. Wolfe, owner of the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot;, and the Columbus Mayor on a trip to the St. Louis in 1920 where they visited the zoo. Wolfe began purchasing exotic animals for the zoo and kept them in the Franklin Park Conservatory until the park was ready. Its first building housed lions and tigers and was completed in 1932.

In 1937, the zoo&#x27;s name changed to the Columbus Municipal Zoo and utilized membership fees to fund its growth but by 1950 was struggling financially.

=== 1950 to present ===
The city of Columbus took over management of the zoo in 1951, but later gave up ownership to the Zoological Park Association, Inc., a non-profit organization, in 1970. The city continued providing funds from the city&#x27;s general fund, however, until 1986.
Jack Hanna became the director of the Columbus Zoo in 1978 and remained director until 1993. The zoo benefited greatly from his oversight, rising to national recognition during his tenure. Prior to his arrival, the zoo saw an average annual attendance of about 360,000. In addition, the animal facilities were in need of renovation. Hanna put an extensive amount of effort into turning the Columbus Zoo into a model facility, including personally picking up trash after hours. Cage enclosures were also removed during his time and replaced with more natural looking habitats. His enthusiasm, along with his national television recognition, helped attract more visitors to the zoo, with over 1.4 million visitors annually by 1992. Hanna was named director emeritus of the zoo in 1993 and continued to be the public face for the zoo in its marketing campaigns until 2020.

In 2004, voters passed a measure that would raise an estimated $180 million to expand the zoo over 10 years. The expansion includes additional parking, Polar Frontier, an exhibit including polar bears and Arctic foxes as well as Heart of Africa, the most recent exhibit, which includes lions, antelope, cheetahs, giraffe, zebras, etc. To make room for these new exhibits, bordering Powell Road has been relocated around the eastern and southern border of the zoo. A new entrance was constructed along the new roadway, which opened in early 2008. Long-term plans include the possibility of a resort-style hotel to attract tourists along with its outdoor water-amusement park, Zoombezi Bay.

On June 28, 2009, Jeff Swanagan, the executive director of the zoo, died suddenly at the age of 51. Dale Schmidt, the zoo&#x27;s chief operating officer, was named executive director on November 20, 2009.

==== Loss and restoration of accreditation ====
Additionally, zoo executives were reported by &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot; as having inappropriate businesses practices that used zoo resources for personal use. Zoo officials addressed the allegations, admitting to mistakes and cut ties to institutions involved but did not clarify specific issues. On October 7, 2021, the Columbus Zoo was to lose its Association of Zoos and Aquariums accredited status for financial mismanagement and animal endangerment. The zoo appealed the decision, and kept its accreditation provisionally. In December 2021 this appeal was denied, with an option to reapply in autumn 2022.

In December 2021, Tom Schmid became the president and CEO of the Columbus Zoo. Schmid came to Columbus from the Texas State Aquarium in Corpus Christi, Texas, and planned to improve the zoo&#x27;s image and restore its accreditation.

The zoo regained AZA accreditation in March 2023. It is also accredited by the Zoological Association of America.

==Exhibits==
The Columbus Zoo is divided into regions, each housing animals from a particular region of the world. Each region is themed for the particular area of the world they are representing, though older regions are themed less than the newly constructed ones. Food and souvenir shops are located throughout the zoo, each one also themed for the region the shop is in.

There are three modes of transportation through the zoo other than walking. These include a train that circles the North America region, a tram that borders the southern part of the North America Region that takes visitors to Polar Frontier, and a boat ride around the Islands of Southeast Asia region.

Polar Frontier opened in May 2010 as an extension of the North America region, featuring animals native to colder climates including Arctic foxes and brown bears. The region also marked the return of polar bears to the zoo, whose habitat includes a pool and an underwater viewing area. The center of the exhibit includes a Conservation/Education Building and a new play area. The zoo added a third polar bear in 2013 and further expanded Polar Frontier in 2014.

In 2015, one of the bears in the Polar Frontier, Aurora, gave birth to a bear cub, which the zoo named Nora. Nora, born on November 6, 2015, was the first polar bear born and raised at the zoo since the opening of Polar Frontier. She now resides at the Hogle Zoo in Utah.

Visitors entering Asia Quest pass a waterfall flanked by two habitats, travel through a cave containing the indoor habitats, exit into a Chinese forest, and finally enter an Asia Quest aviary designed to look like an abandoned Asian garden. Instead of fences, habitats are either recessed and separated via rock walls, or on ground level and separated by the rock walls and glass. Asia Quest also promotes donations for animal conservation, as many of the region&#x27;s animals are threatened in the wild.

==Notable animals==

On December 22, 1956, Colo, a western lowland gorilla, became the world&#x27;s first captive-born gorilla at the Columbus Zoo. When she died in January 2017, at the age of 60, she was the oldest gorilla in human care. Colo&#x27;s extended family includes one child, ten grandchildren, four great-grandchildren, and two great-great-grandchildren living in zoos throughout the country. The Columbus Zoo currently houses fifteen gorillas, six of which are related to Colo. The Columbus Zoo has a gorilla breeding program, with 31 gorillas born at the zoo since 1956. Colo was named after Columbus, the city of her birth.
In March 2007, Fluffy, a reticulated python (&quot;Malayopython reticulatus&quot;) and Guinness World Records holder for the longest snake in captivity, measuring , was put on display at the zoo.

In September 2007, the zoo purchased Fluffy from her owner, and she was on permanent display afterwards. On October 26, 2010, the , 18-year-old snake died. A necropsy found a tumorous mass on one of her ovaries. The zoo has since acquired her daughter named Hanna.

==Other attractions==

===Mangels-Illions Carousel===

In the spring of 2000, the zoo added its restored 1914 Mangels-Illions carousel. This carousel had originally been built for the former Olentangy Park in Clintonville. When the park closed in 1937 and the land and rides sold in 1938, the carousel was moved to Wyandot Lake where it continued operating for sixty years, though in deteriorating condition.

In 1999, the carousel was removed from Wyandot Lake and underwent a million dollar restoration before being moved to a new location at the zoo. With 52 hand carved horses, two chariots, and a Wurlitzer #153 band organ (which plays upon request), this rare &quot;grand carousel&quot; in the Coney Island style is one of only a few manufactured by the William F. Mangels Company with wooden horses carved by M. C. Illions and Sons Carousell Works, and is thus known as a Mangels-Illions carousel. It was ridden 42,000 times in its first month of operation at the zoo, and celebrated its one millionth rider on July 28, 2004.

===Zoombezi Bay===
The zoo purchased Wyandot Lake at the end of 2006 and have renovated the park into &quot;Zoombezi Bay&quot;. The water park opened in May 2008 and contains 17 major slides and attractions.

===Rides At Adventure Cove===

When the zoo bought Wyandot Lake, it split the park into two sections. They used &quot;Jungle Jack&#x27;s Landing&quot; as the name for the dry ride section of the park when it first opened in May 2008 alongside Zoombezi Bay, it features 14 rides and attractions, including the historical Sea Dragon roller coaster. In 2020, &quot;Jungle Jack&#x27;s Landing&quot; was renamed to &quot;Rides At Adventure Cove&quot; to tie into the neighboring Adventure Cove area of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium which opened for the first time on the same year.

==Conservation==

The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium runs a conservation program that funds multiple projects outside of the zoo. In 2010, the zoo provided more than $2 million worth of grants to support conservation projects worldwide. These monies come from fundraisers, visitor donations and privately raised funds. Projects the zoo supports include the &quot;Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund&quot;, the &quot;International Elephant Foundation&quot;, and the &quot;Ohio Wildlife Center.&quot;

In an effort to increase funding for, and public awareness of, the conservation projects around the world, the Columbus Zoo has in recent years incorporated information about threatened and endangered species into exhibits. In addition to helping visitors become more aware, the zoo has also added donation boxes that help fund the many projects the Columbus Zoo supports.

The Columbus Zoo is also involved in conservation programs internally. Manatee Coast, while built as an exhibit, is also a rehabilitation facility for injured manatees. Due to the threatened status of manatees in the wild, Manatee Coast attempts to inform its visitors of the manatee&#x27;s situation, with an entire room dedicated to manatee conservation. This room includes a video describing the manatee&#x27;s natural habitat and what can be done to protect them.

The Columbus Zoo also runs a breeding program for Mexican wolves. This program has the goal of having a population of at least 100 wolves living in what was once their natural range. Mexican wolves became extinct in the wild in the mid-20th century due to being trapped, poisoned, and shot. Since the zoo became involved in 1992, 29 pups have been born at their facility.

<doc id="587955" wikidata="Q1169285" url="?curid=587955" title="List of regional county municipalities and equivalent territories in Quebec">
<text>This is a list of the regional county municipalities (RCM or MRC) and equivalent territories (TE) in the province of Quebec, Canada. They are given along with their geographical codes as specified by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, and the administrative regions to which they belong.

RCMs are county-like units of government at the supralocal level. However, not all municipalities belong to an RCM. In order to use RCMs for statistical purposes, some municipalities (mostly Indian reserves) are viewed as belonging to RCMs they do not belong to legally. The possibly enlarged RCMs are called &quot;municipalités régionales de comté géographiques&quot; (MRCG) as opposed to the legal ones known as &quot;municipalités régionales de comté juridiques&quot; (MRCJ). The remaining municipalities are grouped into &quot;territories equivalent to an RCM&quot; (French: &quot;territoires équivalents à une MRC&quot;) or TEs, which are also considered MRCGs. This way, MRCGs cover the entire territory of Quebec and do not overlap.

There are 87 RCMs and 17 TEs in Quebec, for a total of 104 MRCGs. 14 of the TEs correspond exactly (or very nearly correspond) to cities or urban agglomerations. The only 3 exceptional cases are the TEs of Jamésie, Kativik and Eeyou Istchee. These TEs lie in Northern Quebec and cover large areas with many, mostly small, municipalities.

Because of cooperation between the Institut de la statistique du Québec and Statistics Canada, RCMs and TEs correspond neatly to census divisions in most cases. See the section &quot;Use as census divisions&quot; below.

For further details, see Regional county municipality.

==Lists==

Municipalities with populations of at least 5,000 as of the 2006 Census are listed, with their legal status in parentheses. Those with populations over 20,000 are highlighted.

The seat of the regional county municipality (RCM) is indicated with an asterisk (*). If its population is less than 5,000, then it appears in italics.

The information concerning (legal) RCMs, including their seats, is taken from the database of municipalities of the Ministère des Affaires municipales et régionales. Information concerning geographical RCMs is taken from a list published by the Ministère de la Faune et des Ressources naturelles. Relevant definitions can be obtained from the website of the Institut de la Statistique du Québec.

==Use as census divisions==

Statistics Canada divides Quebec into 98 census divisions that are mostly coextensive with Quebec&#x27;s regional county municipalities and equivalent territories.

93 of these census divisions correspond to a single regional county municipality or equivalent territory in the list above. In these cases the census division and the corresponding RCM or TE share a single two-digit geographical code, except for Lévis, whose code is 251.

The census divisions that are an exception to this are shown below, with geographical codes in parentheses:

* The CD of Francheville (37) consists of the TE of Trois-Rivières (371) and the RCM of Les Chenaux (372). These two divisions formerly constituted the single RCM of Francheville, which was dissolved in 2002.
* The CD of Le Saguenay-et-son-Fjord (94) consists of the TE of Saguenay (941) and the RCM of Le Fjord-du-Saguenay (942). Le Fjord-du-Saguenay formerly included the smaller cities which were amalgamated to create the new city of Saguenay in 2002.
* The CD of Sept-Rivières—Caniapiscau (97) consists of the RCMs of Sept-Rivières (971) and Caniapiscau (972).
* The CD of Minganie–Le Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent (98) consists of the RCMs of Minganie (981) and Le Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent (982). The latter superseded Basse-Côte-Nord in 2010; Basse-Côte-Nord itself was part of Minganie until 2002.
* The CD of Nord-du-Québec (99) is coextensive with the administrative region of Nord-du-Québec and consists of the TEs of Jamésie (991), Kativik (992) and Eeyou Istchee (993).

<text>Rail transport operations are the day-to-day operations of a railway. A railway has two major components: the infrastructure (the permanent way, tracks, stations, freight facilities, viaducts, tunnels, etc.) and the rolling stock (the passenger coaches, locomotives, freight cars, etc.)

Ownership and operation of these two components varies by location. In some places (notably, most of North America) private railway companies own and operate both the infrastructure and rolling stock (for example, Union Pacific). In the United Kingdom, the infrastructure is owned and maintained by Network Rail while rolling stock is largely owned and operated by private railway companies. In countries with nationalized rail systems such as China and France, both the infrastructure and rolling stock are owned and operated directly or indirectly by the national government.

==Operation==
The operation of the railway is through a system of control, originally by mechanical means, but nowadays more usually electronic and computerized.

==Intrinsic factors==

=== Signalling ===
Signalling systems used to control the movement of traffic may be either of fixed block or moving block variety.

==== Fixed block signalling ====

Most blocks are &#x27;fixed&#x27; blocks, i.e. they delineate a section of track between two defined points. On timetable, train order, and token-based systems, blocks usually start and end at selected stations. On signalling-based systems, blocks usually start and end at signals. Alternatively, cab signalling may be in use.

The lengths of blocks are designed to allow trains to operate as frequently as necessary. A lightly used branch line might have blocks many kilometres long, whilst a busy commuter railway might have blocks a few hundred metres long.

==== Moving block signalling ====

A disadvantage of fixed blocks, is that: the faster trains are permitted to run, the longer the stopping distance, and therefore the longer the blocks need to be. This decreases a line&#x27;s capacity.

With moving block, computers are used to calculate a &#x27;safe zone&#x27;, behind each moving train, which no other train may enter. The system depends on precise knowledge of where each train is and how fast it is moving. With moving block, lineside signals are not provided, and instructions are passed directly to the trains. It has the advantage of increasing track capacity by allowing trains to run much closer together. The system is only used on very few independent networks such as underground lines.

===Types of rail system===
Most rail systems serve a number of functions on the same track, carrying local, long-distance and commuter passenger trains, and freight trains. The emphasis on each varies by country. Some urban rail transit, rapid transit and light rail systems are isolated from the national system in the cities they serve. Some freight lines serving mines are also isolated, and these are usually owned by the mine company. An industrial railway is a specialized rail system used inside factories or mines. Steep grade railways are usually isolated, with special safety systems.

===Permanent way and railroad construction===

The permanent way trails through the physical geography. The tracks&#x27; geometry is limited by the physical geography.

===Types of vehicle===


Trains are pushed/pulled by one or more locomotive units. Two or more locomotives coupled in multiple traction are frequently used in freight trains. Railroad cars or rolling stock consist of passenger cars, freight cars, maintenance cars and in America cabooses. Modern passenger trains sometimes are pushed/pulled by a tail and head unit (see top and tail), of which not both need to be motorised or running. Many passenger trains consist of multiple units with motors mounted beneath the passenger cars.

===Passenger operations===
Most public transport passenger operations happen in the train station and in the passenger car. The passenger buys a ticket, either in the station, or on the train (sometimes at a higher fare).

There are generally speaking two ways of validating a ticket:

* the passengers validate the tickets themselves (by perforating it, for instance) which is randomly checked by a ticket controller. This method is sometimes referred to as Proof-of-payment and is used extensively on one-man operated rail and bus lines, and may be controlled through the use of ticket barriers at entrances, especially in larger stations, or
* a conductor checks all persons on the train for valid tickets and devaluate them, so they cannot be used again.

Some passenger cars, especially in long-distance high-speed trains, have a restaurant or bar. These need to be catered. In recent times, train catering has been diminished somewhat by vending machines in the train station or on the train.

When not in use, passenger cars are stored, maintained and repaired in coach yards.

===Freight operations===
Freight or cargo trains are loaded and unloaded in intermodal terminals (also called container freight stations or freight terminals), and at customer locations (e.g. mines, grain elevators, factories). Intermodal freight transport uses standardized containers, which are handled by cranes. Along their routes, freight trains are routed through rail yards to sort cars and assemble trains for their final destinations, as well as for equipment maintenance, refueling, and crew changes. Within a freight yard, trains are composed in a classification yard. Switcher or shunter locomotives help the composing.

A unit train (also called a block train), which carries a block of cars all of the same origin and destination, does not get sorted in a classification yard, but may stop in a freight yard for inspection, engine servicing and/or crew changes.

Combining freight and passenger operations on a single track with passing loops poses operational problems, because of the different demands of freight operators and public transport. In many smaller countries passenger operations are done during the day, while freight trains operate mostly during the night. Dedicated tracks have been assigned to some operations.

===Locomotive operations===
Inactive locomotives may be housed in a locomotive depot (UK term) or engine house, also known as an engine shed or roundhouse (US). In engine facilities, or a traction maintenance depot, locomotives are cleaned, inspected for wear, repaired, updated, or otherwise improved. Decommissioned locomotives with steam generation capacities were sometimes positioned in semi-permanent locations and their boiler capacity was used to provide steam to heat facilities, power machinery, warm passenger cars, or snow and ice clearing activities such as defrosting railroad switches in cold weather conditions.

Railroad equipment that is considered obsolete by being outdated or inefficient when compared to newer equipment, or by being worn to a point that is un-repairable, may be taken out of railroad service. These pieces of equipment may have usable parts removed by the railroad company for reuse on other machines, or may be sold as complete units for reconditioning and reuse by another user. If the equipment is considered completely un-serviceable, and it is financially unwise to attempt to make it so, the entire machine may be declared scrap and is usually sold to be taken away and dismantled for recycling of the raw materials. If the process of salvage or scrapping is financially unrecoverable, the equipment may be left in place until it becomes possible to do so. In some cases a significant or desirable piece of equipment will be purchased for preservation. There units may be placed in railway museums or may be purchased by railway preservation groups or private collectors.

Steam locomotives were frequently housed in a circular train depot, known as a roundhouse that surrounded a turntable.

===Maintenance of way operations===
The presence of a work train on a given section of track will temporarily decrease the capacity of the route. The normal method in such operations is to cease other traffic altogether during the track &#x27;occupation&#x27;. Services may be diverted by an alternative route, if available; alternatively, passenger services may be maintained using a replacement bus service. It is therefore more economically viable to plan such track occupations for periods of reduced usage (e.g. &#x27;off-peak&#x27;, overnight or holiday times) to minimise the impact on normal services and revenue.

==Background factors (feasibility)==

Each transport system represents a contribution to a country&#x27;s infrastructure, and as such must make economic sense or eventually close. From this, each has a particular role or roles. These may change with time but they affect the specifications of each particular system.

==Extrinsic factors==
Rail transport systems are built into the landscape, including both the physical geography (hills, valleys, etc.) and the human geography (location of settlements). The rail transport system may in turn feedback into the human geography.

===Physical geography===
The permanent way of a system must pass through the geography and geology of its region. This may be flat or mountainous, may include obstacles such as water and mountains. These determine, in part, the intrinsic nature of the system. The slope at which trains run must also be calculated correctly. In this stage, it is decided where tunnels pass.

===Human geography===
Rail transport systems affect the human geography. Large cities (such as Nairobi) may be founded by a railroad passing through. Historically, when a station has been built outside the town or city it is intended to serve, that town has expanded to include the station, or buildings (especially Inns) sprung up near the station. The existence of a station may increase the number of commuters who live in a town or village and so cause it to become a dormitory town. The transcontinental railroad was a large factor in American colonization of the Western frontier. China&#x27;s railroad expansion into Tibet may have similar consequences.

===Historical factors===
Rail transport systems are often used for purposes they were not designed for, but have evolved into due to changes in human geography. Politics can play a large part in decisions about railways, such as the Beeching Axe. In the UK, building or rebuilding a railway usually requires an Act of Parliament. In many countries, rail subsidies allow unprofitable, but socially desirable, railways to continue to operate.

<text>Clopidogrel, sold under the brand name Plavix among others, is an antiplatelet medication used to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in those at high risk. It is also used together with aspirin in heart attacks and following the placement of a coronary artery stent (dual antiplatelet therapy). It is taken by mouth. Its effect starts about two hours after intake and lasts for five days.
Common side effects include headache, nausea, easy bruising, itching, and heartburn. More severe side effects include bleeding and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. While there is no evidence of harm from use during pregnancy, such use has not been well studied. Clopidogrel is in the thienopyridine-class of antiplatelets. It works by irreversibly inhibiting a receptor called P2Y12 on platelets.
Clopidogrel was patented in 1982, and approved for medical use in 1997. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 47th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication.

== Medical uses ==
Clopidogrel is used to prevent heart attack and stroke in people who are at high risk of these events, including those with a history of myocardial infarction and other forms of acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and those with peripheral artery disease.

Treatment with clopidogrel or a related drug is recommended by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology for people who:
* Present for treatment with a myocardial infarction with ST-elevation including
:* A loading dose given in advance of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), followed by a full year of treatment for those receiving a vascular stent
:* A loading dose given in advance of fibrinolytic therapy, continued for at least 14 days
* Present for treatment of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina
:* Including a loading dose and maintenance therapy in those receiving PCI and unable to tolerate aspirin therapy
:* Maintenance therapy for up to 12 months in those at medium to high risk for which a noninvasive treatment strategy is chosen
* In those with stable ischemic heart disease, treatment with clopidogrel is described as a &quot;reasonable&quot; option for monotherapy in those who cannot tolerate aspirin, as is treatment with clopidogrel in combination with aspirin in certain high risk patients.

It is also used, along with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin), for the prevention of thrombosis after placement of a coronary stent or as an alternative antiplatelet drug for people intolerant to aspirin. It is available as a fixed-dose combination with aspirin.

A meta-analysis found clopidogrel&#x27;s benefit as an antiplatelet drug in reducing cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke to be 25% benefit in smokers, with little (8%) benefit in non-smokers.

Consensus-based therapeutic guidelines also recommend the use of clopidogrel rather than aspirin (ASA) for antiplatelet therapy in people with a history of gastric ulceration, as inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins by ASA can exacerbate this condition. In people with healed ASA-induced ulcers, however, those receiving ASA plus the proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole had a lower incidence of recurrent ulcer bleeding than those receiving clopidogrel. However, prophylaxis with proton-pump inhibitors along with clopidogrel following acute coronary syndrome may increase adverse cardiac outcomes, possibly due to inhibition of CYP2C19, which is required for the conversion of clopidogrel to its active form. The European Medicines Agency has issued a public statement on a possible interaction between clopidogrel and proton-pump inhibitors. However, several cardiologists have voiced concern that the studies on which these warnings are based have many limitations and that it is not certain whether an interaction between clopidogrel and proton-pump inhibitors is real.

== Adverse effects ==
Serious adverse drug reactions associated with clopidogrel therapy include:

* Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (incidence: four per million patients treated)
* Hemorrhage – the annual incidence of hemorrhage may be increased by the coadministration of aspirin.

In the CURE trial, people with acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation were treated with aspirin plus either clopidogrel or placebo and followed for up to one year. The following rates of major bleed were seen:
* Any major bleeding: clopidogrel 3.7%, placebo 2.7%
* Life-threatening bleeding: clopidogrel 2.2%, placebo 1.8%
* Hemorrhagic stroke: clopidogrel 0.1%, placebo 0.1%

The CAPRIE trial compared clopidogrel monotherapy to aspirin monotherapy for 1.6 years in people who had recently experienced a stroke or heart attack. In this trial the following rates of bleeding were observed.
* Gastrointestinal hemorrhage: clopidogrel 2.0%, aspirin 2.7%
* Intracranial bleeding: clopidogrel 0.4%, aspirin 0.5%

In CAPRIE, itching was the only adverse effect seen more frequently with clopidogrel than aspirin. In CURE, there was no difference in the rate of non-bleeding adverse events.

Rashes and itching were uncommon in studies (between 0.1 and 1% of people); serious hypersensitivity reactions are rare.

== Interactions ==
Clopidogrel generally has a low potential to interact with other pharmaceutical drugs. Combination with other drugs that affect blood clotting, such as aspirin, heparins and thrombolytics, showed no relevant interactions. Naproxen did increase the likelihood of occult gastrointestinal bleeding, as might be the case with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. As clopidogrel is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2C19, in cellular models it has been theorized that it might increase blood plasma levels of other drugs that are metabolized by this enzyme, such as phenytoin and tolbutamide. Clinical studies showed that this mechanism is irrelevant for practical purposes.

In November 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that clopidogrel should be used with caution in people using the proton-pump inhibitors omeprazole or esomeprazole, but pantoprazole appears to be safe. The newer antiplatelet agent prasugrel has minimal interaction with , hence might be a better antiplatelet agent (if no other contraindications are present) in people who are on these proton-pump inhibitors.

== Pharmacology ==
Clopidogrel is a prodrug which is metabolized by the liver into its active form. The active form specifically and irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 subtype of ADP receptor, which is important in activation of platelets and eventual cross-linking by the protein fibrin.

=== Pharmacokinetics and metabolism ===
After repeated oral doses of 75 mg of clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet-inhibiting effect, are very low and, in general, are below the quantification limit (0.258 μg/L) beyond two hours after dosing.

Clopidogrel is a prodrug, which is activated in two steps, first by the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and CYP2B6, then by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP3A. The thiophene ring is converted to a thiolactone, which undergoes ring-opening. The active metabolite has three sites that are stereochemically relevant, making a total of eight possible isomers. These are: a stereocentre at C4 (attached to the —SH thiol group), a double bond at C3—C16, and the original stereocentre at C7. Only one of the eight structures is an active antiplatelet drug. This has the following configuration: &quot;Z&quot; configuration at the C3—C16 double bond, the original &quot;S&quot; configuration at C7, and, although the stereocentre at C4 cannot be directly determined, as the thiol group is too reactive, work with the active metabolite of the related drug prasugrel suggests the &quot;R&quot;-configuration of the C4 group is critical for P2Y12 and platelet-inhibitory activity.

The active metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 0.5 to 1.0 h, and acts by forming a disulfide bridge with the platelet ADP receptor. Patients with a variant allele of CYP2C19 are 1.5 to 3.5 times more likely to die or have complications than patients with the high-functioning allele.

Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled clopidogrel in humans, about 50% was excreted in the urine and 46% in the feces in the five days after dosing.

* Effect of food: Administration of clopidogrel bisulfate with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.
* Absorption and distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses of 75-milligram clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (about 3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring around one hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of clopidogrel. Absorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel-related metabolites.
Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly &quot;in vitro&quot; to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is not saturable &quot;in vitro&quot; up to a concentration of 110 μg/mL.

* Metabolism and elimination: &quot;In vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;, clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.

In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a boxed warning, later updated, to Plavix, alerting that the drug can be less effective in people unable to metabolize the drug to convert it to its active form.

=== Pharmacogenetics ===
CYP2C19 is an important drug-metabolizing enzyme that catalyzes the biotransformation of many clinically useful drugs, including antidepressants, barbiturates, proton-pump inhibitors, and antimalarial and antitumor drugs. Clopidogrel is one of the drugs metabolized by this enzyme.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a boxed warning on clopidogrel in 2010 about CYP2C19-poor metabolizers. People with variants in cytochrome P-450 2C19 (CYP2C19) have lower levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel, less inhibition of platelets, and a 3.58-times greater risk for major adverse cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, and stroke; the risk was greatest in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.

A published review showed that some mutations of &quot;CYP2C19&quot;, &quot;CYP3A4&quot;, &quot;CYP2C9&quot;, &quot;CYP2B6&quot;, and &quot;CYP1A2&quot; genes could affect the clinical efficacy and safety of clopidogrel treatment. For instance, patients carrying the mutations &quot;CYP2C19*2&quot;, &quot;CYP2C19*3&quot;, &quot;CYP2C9*2&quot;, &quot;CYP2C9*3&quot;, and &quot;CYP2B6*5&quot; alleles may not respond to clopidogrel due to poor platelet inhibition efficacy revealed among them.

=== Mechanism of action ===
The active metabolite of clopidogrel specifically and irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 subtype of ADP receptor, which is important in activation of platelets and eventual cross-linking by the protein fibrin. Platelet inhibition can be demonstrated two hours after a single dose of oral clopidogrel, but the onset of action is slow, so a loading dose of either 600 or 300 mg is administered when a rapid effect is needed.

== Society and culture ==
=== Economics ===

Plavix is marketed worldwide in nearly 110 countries, with sales of in 2009. It was the second-top-selling drug in the world in 2007 and was still growing by over 20% in 2007. US sales were in 2008.

Before the expiry of its patent, clopidogrel was the second best-selling drug in the world. In 2010, it grossed over in global sales.

In 2006, generic clopidogrel was briefly marketed by Apotex, a Canadian generic pharmaceutical company before a court order halted further production until resolution of a patent infringement case brought by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The court ruled that Bristol-Myers Squibb&#x27;s patent was valid and provided protection until November 2011. The FDA extended the patent protection of clopidogrel by six months, giving exclusivity that would expire in May 2012. The FDA approved generic versions of clopidogrel in May 2012.

<text>Abitibi County (, ) was a historical county in southwestern Quebec. The county seat was in Amos, and the area known for its mines and boreal forests. It extended from the Ontario border in the west to the Gouin Reservoir in the east, and included the communities of La Sarre and Val-d&#x27;Or in addition to Amos. The county was bounded on the north by Abitibi Territory, on the east by Champlain County, on the west by the Ontario districts of Cochrane and Timiskaming, and on the south by Témiscamingue County, Pontiac County, Montcalm County, Joliette County, Berthier County, Maskinongé County and St. Maurice County. Abitibi County is now part of the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region. The area has a rich culture that dates back thousands of years.

In the early 1980s, Abitibi County was divided into Regional County Municipalities. The western panhandle section became Abitibi-Ouest MRC, the north-central section went to Abitibi MRC, the east-central and southern sections went to Vallée-de-l&#x27;Or MRC, the farthest eastern section went to Le Haut-Saint-Maurice MRC (now La Tuque), and a small part in the southwest went to Rouyn-Noranda MRC (now Ville de Rouyn-Noranda).

<text>Argenteuil County (, ) is an historic county in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It was located on the Ottawa River between Gatineau and Montreal. The county seat was Lachute. Argenteuil was bounded on the north by Terrebonne County, on the east by Deux-Montagnes County, on the west by Papineau County and on the south by the United Counties of Prescott and Russell in Ontario.

In the early 1980s, Quebec&#x27;s counties were abolished; as a result, most of Argenteuil County became the Argenteuil Regional County Municipality. The northwestern corner was transferred to Les Laurentides Regional County Municipality the northern parts to Les Pays-d&#x27;en-Haut Regional County Municipality and some eastern parts to Deux-Montagnes Regional County Municipality.

<text>Jack Bushnell Hanna (born January 2, 1947) is an American retired zookeeper and director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. Commonly nicknamed &quot;Jungle Jack&quot;, he was director of the zoo from 1978 to 1992, and is viewed as largely responsible for elevating its quality and reputation. His media appearances, particularly with David Letterman, James Corden, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and Maury Povich made him one of the most notable animal experts in the United States.

==Early life==
Hanna was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. He grew up on his family&#x27;s farm and volunteered for the family veterinarian, Dr. Roberts, when he was 11. He attended The Kiski School, an all-boys boarding school in Saltsburg, Pennsylvania, for high school, graduating in 1965. He majored in business and political science at Muskingum College in New Concord, Ohio, where he got in trouble for keeping ducks in his dorm room and a donkey in a shed behind his fraternity house (The M.A.C.E. Club). In his senior year, Hanna married Suzi, a cheerleader at Muskingum, and graduated in 1968.

==Career==

Although unable to secure zoning as a zoo for his family&#x27;s farm, Hanna and Suzi opened a pet shop and petting zoo. In 1972, a three-year-old boy was mauled by a lion at Hanna&#x27;s farm and lost an arm after slipping past the protective barrier. Hanna settled a later lawsuit out of court, shut down the petting zoo, and moved his family to Florida.

From 1973 to 1975, Hanna worked for a wildlife adventure company and directed the Central Florida Zoo and Botanical Gardens. When he was offered the position at the Columbus Zoo in 1978, one of the reasons he accepted was because he believed Columbus Children&#x27;s Hospital had the best treatment available for his daughter Julie&#x27;s leukemia. She recovered by the age of six, although she needed to have a brain tumor removed later in life.
At the time he became the zoo&#x27;s director, the grounds of the zoo were unkempt and the facilities run down. Hanna initially struck many as a &quot;zealous&quot; zoo director, often traveling around the zoo grounds after closing to personally pick up trash. He also realized the importance of increasing the profile of the Columbus Zoo in central Ohio to get more public support and funding, and the &quot;everyman&quot;-seeming Hanna proved to be very well-suited to public relations for the zoo. From 1981 to 1983, Hanna hosted a local television program, &quot;Hanna&#x27;s Ark&quot;, which aired on the local CBS affiliate in Columbus, WBNS. Hanna&#x27;s live animal demonstrations on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and David Letterman&#x27;s talk show incarnations brought national attention to the Columbus Zoo as well as to Hanna himself. Over the course of Hanna&#x27;s tenure as director, the zoo made the transition from cage-like enclosures to habitat environments, and the grounds were significantly expanded. The annual attendance of the Columbus Zoo increased by over 400% during this time. Hanna was named director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in 1992.

Hanna published his autobiography, &quot;Monkeys on the Interstate&quot;, in 1989. He has published many books for children as well. He has hosted the syndicated television shows &quot;Jack Hanna&#x27;s Animal Adventures&quot;, &quot;Jack Hanna&#x27;s Into the Wild&quot;, and &quot;Jack Hanna&#x27;s Wild Countdown&quot;, all produced and distributed by Litton Entertainment. Hanna also occasionally contributed commentary as an animal expert on various local and national news programs, and has done guest spots on other shows such as &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;Nancy Grace&quot;, &quot;Maury&quot;, and &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;. On September 25, 2003, Hanna made a special guest appearance on an episode of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; (season 5, episode 35, &quot;Animals in Our House?&quot;). He was also named one of the &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; by &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1996. Hanna also appeared in Neal McCoy&#x27;s 2005 music video for &quot;Billy&#x27;s Got His Beer Goggles On&quot; with a hyacinth macaw, a sloth and an albino burmese python. Hanna, along with Emmy Award-winning musician Mark Frye, released an album through Virgin Records in 1996 entitled &quot;Jack Hanna&#x27;s World.&quot;

He was granted honorary doctorates from Muskingum University, Otterbein College, Capital University, and Ohio University.

On October 19, 2011, Hanna assisted Ohio police in tracking down several escaped exotic animals near Zanesville, Ohio. He provided police assistance with expertise in tracking down the animals, which included lions, leopards, wolves, primates, bears, and eighteen tigers.

In May 2018 at the Los Angeles Zoo&#x27;s annual Beastly Ball, Hanna received the Tom Mankiewicz Leadership Award for his work in conservation.

In June 2020, Hanna announced his retirement from the Columbus Zoo effective at the end of the year.

===Criticism of Copenhagen Zoo giraffe culling===
Hanna criticized the killing of the healthy eighteen-month-old giraffe Marius in Copenhagen Zoo, which was killed rather than offered for adoption after being classified as genetically over-represented in zoo breeding programs. Hanna said this would not happen in an American zoo. Soon after, he raised money to prevent a separate male giraffe culling at the Jyllands Park Zoo, also in Denmark, where zookeepers had said they might kill the giraffe if they brought in some females for breeding. Hanna said he was willing to provide refuge including transport for this giraffe. The Jyllands Park Zoo later stated that they did not plan to bring in a new female or to kill the male at the facility.

==Health==
In 2019, Hanna was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He retired from public life in 2021, and he and his wife, Suzi, moved to Montana. In April 2021, Hanna&#x27;s family publicly announced his diagnosis, and that he would make no further public appearances. His daughters stated that &quot;his condition has progressed much faster in the last few months than any of us could have anticipated&quot;. By 2023, Hanna&#x27;s Alzheimer&#x27;s disease had progressed to the point where he no longer recognized most family members.

==Allegation of improper animal trading practices==
On April 6, 2021, filmmakers of an independent documentary, &quot;The Conservation Game&quot;, alleged that the Columbus Zoo misrepresented where its ambassador animals had been acquired from or had been transferred to and that the zoo had been dealing with unaccredited private facilities that, in some cases, may not have provided appropriate animal care. The documentary directly connected Hanna to exploiting immunocompromised animal cubs, including snow leopards, with some of the cubs he used dying at early ages or disappearing from record, despite Hanna&#x27;s assurances that the cats were healthy and safe.

Zoo officials responded to the documentary by cutting ties with most of the unaccredited private institutions named in the documentary. Former zoo official Suzi Rapp defended one of the private institutions, saying that the lack of certification of the facility does not necessarily indicate that the institution is not a good facility. Columbus Zoo Senior Vice President of Animal Care and Conservation Dr. Jan Ramler says the zoo no longer has relationships with those vendors or any vendors. “The film advocates for the passage of the Big Cat Public Safety Act now being considered in Congress,” a Zoo statement read. “The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium shares and applauds this goal.” Hanna&#x27;s family released a statement saying they had not seen the documentary, could not speak for him, and could not consult him on the matter due to the effects of his dementia.

It was formed from the townships of Warwick, Standold, Arthabaska, Chester-Est, Chester-Ouest and Tingwick, as well as part of the townships of Maddington, Blandford, Horton, Bulstrode, Simpson, and Aston.

In the early 1980s Quebec&#x27;s counties were abolished and most of Arthabaska County became the Arthabaska Regional County Municipality. The northeastern part of the county was transferred to L&#x27;Érable Regional County Municipality.

The name of the county comes from the name of the township of Arthabaska, itself originating from the Cree language, in which it means &quot;where there are reeds&quot;.

<text>John Haywood (born Edgecombe County, North Carolina, February 23, 1755; died Raleigh, Wake County, North Carolina, November 18, 1827) was an American politician, who was the longest-serving North Carolina State Treasurer from 1787 until his death in 1827.

==Early and family life==
Haywood&#x27;s father was North Carolina politician, judge and patriot William Haywood (1730–79),who had married Charity Hare (of Hertford County, North Carolina), who bore nine children, including banker Sherwood Haywood. This John Haywood was named for his grandfather, another John Haywood (1685-), who was born in Barbados, arrived in North Carolina about 1730 and became active in local politics.

For many years this John Haywood and his first wife, Sarah Leigh, used their new premises to entertain official state dignitaries. Sarah gave John one son, named Leigh.

After Sarah died in 1791, John remarried, on March 9, 1798, Eliza Eagles Asaph Williams, by whom he had 12 children, including sons William Haywood, John S. Haywood, Ernest Haywood, Dr. Edmund Burke Haywood, and Dr. Fabius Haywood.

==Career==
Haywood began public service in 1781 as clerk of the State Senate, and held this office for five years, after which the state legislature elected him the state Treasurer, a position he would hold forty years, until his death. Haywood also became the first Intendant of Police, or Mayor of Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1795.

==Financial scandal==
In 1820 &quot;Treasurer John,&quot; one of the most popular men in the state, was accused of &quot;abusing his trust.&quot; The legislature promptly exonerated him following an inquiry, but an examination of the records after his death in 1827 disclosed that public funds in excess of $68,000 were, in fact, unaccounted for. That was a massive shortfall in those days – more than half the state&#x27;s entire budget for the year. Haywood&#x27;s heirs reimbursed the state nearly $48,000 for the missing money, but examiners shortly afterward discovered an additional shortage of almost $22,000 in Cherokee bonds, revenue from the sale of public lands in western North Carolina.

The historian William K. Boyd commented that the accounting of public funds in those days was deficient in three respects: &quot;First, the comptroller did not have oversight of the actual money in the treasury; the auditing by the comptroller did not include all state funds; and the method of bonding the treasurer was not adequate.&quot; In 1784 a law had been enacted requiring the Treasurer to post a bond in the amount of &quot;one hundred thousand pounds,&quot; but an 1801 statute reduced the amount of the required bond to a sum equal to the balance of existing treasury funds, plus estimated annual revenue for the following year. It stipulated moreover that no penalty would be imposed for failure to comply with the requirement.

Although banks were operating in Raleigh and throughout North Carolina, Haywood preferred to keep the state&#x27;s money in a &quot;Public Chest&quot; in his office, dipping into it as necessary to pay governmental and perhaps personal expenses. Since he had posted no bond from 1826 to 1827, when the shortfall was discovered in his accounts, state officials had no practical means of recovering the missing money.

They took Haywood&#x27;s estate to court, but to no avail. The court held that the executor had properly dispersed all but slightly more than $7,000 of Haywood&#x27;s assets. This meager sum was duly awarded to the state, minus a small amount for his widow&#x27;s dower rights.

==Death and legacy==
When Haywood died in Raleigh in 1827, &quot;a great procession was given in his honor and his funeral was conducted in the Presbyterian Church by Reverend Doctor McPheeters&quot;. The legislature elected his son, John S. Haywood, to succeed him as treasurer, but the son declined the office, as the magnitude of his father&#x27;s malfeasance was becoming clear.
From 1797 to 1809, Haywood owned Locust Grove plantation at Ingleside, North Carolina. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

When a law was passed requiring state officials to live in Raleigh, Haywood bought land bounded by New Bern, Blount, Edenton and Person Streets, and built Haywood Hall. Although it was sold to pay his debts because of the scandal noted above, it survives today. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and remains a popular venue for small groups.

Haywood County was named in his honor during his lifetime (it was created in 1808), and he also subsequently had a town named after him in Chatham County.

<text>Railroads played a large role in the development of the United States from the Industrial Revolution in the Northeast (1820s–1850s) to the settlement of the West (1850s–1890s). The American railroad mania began with the founding of the first passenger and freight line in the country, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, in 1827, and the &quot;Laying of the First Stone&quot; ceremonies and the beginning of its long construction heading westward over the obstacles of the Appalachian Mountains eastern chain in the next year. It flourished with continuous railway building projects for the next 45 years until the financial Panic of 1873, followed by a major economic depression, that bankrupted many companies and temporarily stymied and ended growth.

Railroads not only increased the speed of transport, they also dramatically lowered its cost. The first transcontinental railroad resulted in passengers and freight being able to cross the country in a matter of days instead of months and at one tenth the cost of stagecoach or wagon transport. With economical transportation in the West (which had been referred to as the Great American Desert) now farming, ranching and mining could be done at a profit. As a result, railroads transformed the country, particularly the West (which had few navigable rivers).

For example, before the railroads were built in the West, if a farmer were to ship a load of corn only 200 miles to Chicago, the shipping cost by wagon would exceed the price for which the corn could be sold. So, under such circumstances, farming could not be done at a profit. Mining and other economic activity in the West were similarly inhibited because of the high cost of wagon transportation. One Congressman referring to the West, bluntly stated that “All that land wasn’t worth ten cents until the railroads came.”

Freight rates by rail were a small fraction of what they had been with wagon transport. When the United States bought the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, people thought that it would take 300 years to populate it. With the introduction of the railroad, it took only 30 years. The low cost of shipping by rail resulted in the Great American Desert becoming the great American breadbasket. 

Although the antebellum South started early to build railways, it concentrated on short lines linking cotton regions to oceanic or river ports, and the absence of an interconnected network was a major handicap during the Civil War (1861–1865). The North and Midwest constructed networks that linked every city by 1860 before the war. In the heavily settled Midwestern Corn Belt, over 80 percent of farms were within of a railway, facilitating the shipment of grain, hogs, and cattle to national and international markets. A large number of short lines were built, but due to a fast-developing financial system based on Wall Street and oriented to railway bonds, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890. State and local governments often subsidized lines, but rarely owned them. Because of the economic importance and complexity of this new national system and failures in how they were run, the first federal regulatory agency, the Interstate Commerce Commission was created in the 1880s.

The system was largely built by 1910. However, federal and state policies to subsidize, fund, and prioritize competition with railroads resulted in its decline. With the proliferation of a system of highways built and owned by the state, operated at a loss and were not restricted by the requirement to make a profit, trucks began to eat away freight traffic and automobiles (and later airplanes,
which were also subsided by the state via airports, air traffic control, etc.) devoured the passenger traffic. After 1940, the replacement of steam with diesel electric locomotives made for much more efficient operations that needed fewer workers on the road and in repair shops.

A series of bankruptcies and consolidations left the rail system in the hands of a few large operations by the 1980s. Almost all long-distance passenger traffic was shifted to Amtrak in 1971, a government-owned operation. Commuter rail service is provided near a few major cities, including New York City, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. Computerization and improved equipment steadily reduced employment, which peaked at 2.1 million in 1920, falling to 1.2 million in 1950 and 215,000 in 2010. Route mileage peaked at in 1916 and fell to in 2011.

Freight railroads continue to play an important role in the United States&#x27; economy, especially for moving imports and exports using containers, and for shipments of coal and, since 2010, of oil. Productivity rose 172% between 1981 and 2000, while rates rose 55% (after accounting for inflation). Rail&#x27;s share of the American freight market rose to 43%, the highest for any rich country, primarily due to external factors such as geography and higher use of goods like coal. In recent years, railroads have gradually been losing intermodal traffic to trucking.

==History==
===Early period (to 1860)===

The animal powered Leiper Railroad followed in 1810 after the preceding successful experiment—designed and built by merchant Thomas Leiper, the railway connected Crum Creek to Ridley Creek, in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. It was used until 1829, when it was temporarily replaced by the Leiper Canal, then it was reopened to replace the canal in 1852. This was the first railroad meant to be permanent, and the first to evolve into trackage of a common carrier after an intervening closure.

In 1826 Massachusetts incorporated Quincy&#x27;s Granite Railway as a common freight carrier to primarily haul granite for the construction of the Bunker Hill Monument; operations began later that year, and which still had a section of it operating until the 1940s.

Other railroads authorized by states in 1826 and constructed in the following years included the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company&#x27;s gravity railroad; and the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, to carry freight and passengers around a bend in the Erie Canal. To link the port of Baltimore to the Ohio River, the state of Maryland in 1827 chartered the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O), the first section of which opened in 1830. Similarly, the South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company was chartered in 1827 to connect Charleston to the Savannah River, and Pennsylvania built the Main Line of Public Works between Philadelphia and the Ohio River.

The Americans closely followed and copied British railroad technology. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was the first common carrier and started passenger train service in May 1830, initially using horses to pull train cars. 
===Steam locomotives===
The South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company was the first to use steam locomotives regularly beginning with the Best Friend of Charleston, the first American-built locomotive intended for revenue service, in December 1830.

The B&amp;O started developing steam locomotives in 1829 with Peter Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;. This was the first American-built locomotive to run in the U.S., although it was intended as a demonstration of the potential of steam traction rather than as a revenue-earning locomotive. Many of the earliest locomotives for American railroads were imported from England, including the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot; and the &quot;John Bull&quot;, but a domestic locomotive manufacturing industry was quickly established, with locomotives like the &quot;DeWitt Clinton&quot; being built in the 1830s. The B&amp;O&#x27;s westward route reached the Ohio River in 1852, the first eastern seaboard railroad to do so.

By 1850, of railroad lines had been built. 

===Land grants===

The federal government operated a land grant system between 1855 and 1871, through which new railway companies in the west were given millions of acres they could sell to prospective farmers or pledge to bondholders. A total of were granted to the railroads before the program ended, supplemented by a further granted by the states, and by various government subsidies. This program enabled the opening of numerous western lines, especially the Union Pacific-Central Pacific with fast service from San Francisco to Omaha and east to Chicago. West of Chicago, many cities grew up as rail centers, with repair shops and a base of technically literate workers.

In return for the land grants, the railroads were required to haul government personnel and cargo at significantly reduced rates (generally half of the normal rate). In addition, the land was granted in a checkerboard fashion, with the government retaining every other section. The land that the government retained typically doubled in value as a result of the railroad being built. The land grants were a good deal for the government.

The government guaranteed loans to several Pacific railroads, which were all paid off by 1899 ($63 million in principal, and $105 million in interest). After receiving rate discounts of approximately 50% on government personnel and cargo for 80 years (including during two world wars), Congress finally discontinued the rate reductions at the end of World War II. The land grants had been more than paid for (several times over).

===Displacing water routes===

Railroads soon replaced many canals and turnpikes and by the 1870s had significantly displaced steamboats as well. The railroads were superior to these alternative modes of transportation, particularly water routes because they lowered costs in two ways. Canals and rivers were unavailable in the winter season due to freezing, but the railroads ran year-round despite poor weather. And railroads were safer: the likelihood of a train crash was less than the likelihood of a boat sinking. The railroads provided cost-effective transportation because they allowed shippers to have a smaller inventory of goods, which reduced storage costs during winter, and to avoid insurance costs from the risk of losing goods during transit.

===Changing style of travel===
Likewise, railroads changed the style of transportation. For the common person in the early 1800s, transportation was often by horse or stagecoach. The network of trails along which coaches navigated were riddled with ditches, potholes, and stones. This made travel fairly uncomfortable. Adding to injury, coaches were cramped with little leg room. Travel by train offered a new style. Locomotives proved themselves a smooth, headache free ride with plenty of room to move around. Some passenger trains offered meals in the spacious dining car followed by a good night sleep in the private sleeping quarters.

===Networks===
Railroad companies in the North and Midwest constructed networks that linked nearly every major city by 1860. In the heavily settled Corn Belt (from Ohio to Iowa), over 80 percent of farms were within of a railway. A large number of short lines were built, but due to a fast-developing financial system based on Wall Street and oriented to railway securities, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890. Most of these railroads made money and ones that didn&#x27;t were soon bought up and incorporated in a larger system or &quot;rationalized&quot;. Although the transcontinental railroads dominated the media, with the completion of the First transcontinental railroad in 1869 dramatically symbolizing the nation&#x27;s unification after the divisiveness of the Civil War, most construction actually took place in the industrial Northeast and agricultural Midwest, and was designed to minimize shipping times and costs. The railroads in the South were repaired and expanded and then, after a lot of preparation, changed from a 5-foot gauge to standard gauge of 4 foot 8 ½ inches in two days in May 1886.

With its extensive river system, the United States supported a large array of horse-drawn or mule-drawn barges on canals and paddle wheel steamboats on rivers that competed with railroads after 1815 until the 1870s. The canals and steamboats lost out because of the dramatic increases in efficiency and speed of the railroads, which could go almost anywhere year-round. The railroads were faster and went to many places a canal would be impractical or too expensive to build or a natural river never went. Railroads also had better scheduling since they often could go year-round, more or less ignoring the weather. Canals and river traffic were cheaper if you lived on or near a canal or river that wasn&#x27;t frozen over part of the year, but only a few did. Long-distance transport of goods by wagon to a canal or river was slow and expensive. A railroad to a city made it an inland &quot;port&quot; that often prospered or turned a town into a city.

===Civil War and Reconstruction (1861–1877)===
Rail was strategic during the American Civil War, and the Union used its much larger system much more effectively. Practically all the mills and factories supplying rails and equipment were in the North, and the Union blockade kept the South from getting new equipment or spare parts. The war was fought in the South, and Union raiders (and sometimes Confederates too) systematically destroyed bridges and rolling stock — and sometimes bent rails — to hinder the logistics of the enemy.

In the South, most railroads in 1860 were local affairs connecting cotton regions with the nearest waterway. Most transports were by boat, not rail, and after the Union blockaded the ports in 1861 and seized the key rivers in 1862, long-distance travel was difficult. The outbreak of war had a depressing effect on the economic fortunes of the railroad companies, for the hoarding of the cotton crop in an attempt to force European intervention left railroads bereft of their main source of income. Many had to lay off employees, and in particular, let go skilled technicians and engineers. For the early years of the war, the Confederate government had a hands-off approach to the railroads. Only in mid-1863 did the Confederate government initiate an overall policy, and it was confined solely to aiding the war effort. With the legislation of impressment the same year, railroads and their rolling stock came under the de facto control of the Confederate military.

Conditions deteriorated rapidly in the Confederacy, as there was no new equipment and raids on both sides systematically destroyed key bridges, as well as locomotives and freight cars. Spare parts were cannibalized; feeder lines were torn up to get replacement rails for trunk lines, and the heavy use of rolling stock wore them out. In 1864–65 the Confederate railroad network collapsed; little traffic moved in 1865.
The Southern states had blocked westward rail expansion before 1860, but after secession the Pacific Railway Acts were passed in 1862 and 1863, which respectively established the central Pacific route and the standard gauge to be used. With federal financing in the form of bonds and generous land grants and with the heroic help of the mainly Chinese and Irish laborers, Central Pacific Railroad working eastward and Union Pacific Railroad working westward combined to complete in 1869 the major breakthrough First transcontinental railroad, which linked by rail the eastern states with the Pacific coast and made possible moving from New York to San Francisco Bay in only six days. In addition, other transcontinentals were built in the South (Southern Pacific, Santa Fe) and in the North along the Canada–US border (Northern Pacific, Great Northern), accelerating the settlement of the West by offering inexpensive farms and ranches on credit, carrying pioneers and supplies westward, and cattle, wheat and minerals eastward. In 1860 before the transcontinentals, railroads carried less than half as much freight as inland waterways, whereas by 1890 railroads carried five times as much freight as waterways.
During the Reconstruction era, Northern money financed the rebuilding and dramatic expansion of railroads throughout the South; they were modernized in terms of track gauge, equipment and standards of service. The Southern network expanded from 11,000 miles (17,700 km) in 1870 to 29,000 miles (46,700 km) in 1890. The lines were owned and directed overwhelmingly by Northerners. Railroads helped create a mechanically skilled group of craftsmen and broke the isolation of much of the region. Passengers were few, however, and apart from hauling the cotton crop when it was harvested, there was little freight traffic.

The Panic of 1873 was a major global economic depression which ended rapid rail expansion in the United States. Many lines went bankrupt or were barely able to pay the interest on their bonds, and workers were laid off on a mass scale, with those still employed subject to large cuts in wages. This worsening situation for railroad workers led to strikes against many railroads, culminating in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, involving over 100,000 people in multiple cities.

The Great Strike began on July 14 in Martinsburg, West Virginia, in response to the cutting of wages for the second time in a year by the B&amp;O Railroad. The strike, and related violence, spread to Cumberland, Maryland, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Philadelphia, Chicago and the Midwest. The strike lasted for 45 days, and ended only with the intervention of local and state militias, and federal troops. Labor unrest continued into the 1880s, such as the Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886, which involved over 200,000 workers.

===Expansion and consolidation (1878–1916)===
By 1880 the nation had 17,800 freight locomotives carrying 23,600 tons of freight, and 22,200 passenger locomotives. The U.S. railroad industry was the nation&#x27;s largest employer outside of the agricultural sector. The effects of the American railways on rapid industrial growth were many, including the opening of hundreds of millions of acres of very good farm land ready for mechanization, lower costs for food and all goods, a huge national sales market, the creation of a culture of engineering excellence, and the creation of the modern system of management.

On January 12, 1883, the southern section of the second transcontinental railroad line was completed as the Southern Pacific tracks from Los Angeles met the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway at a location west of the Pecos River near Langtry, Texas.

New York financier J.P. Morgan played an increasingly dominant role in consolidating the rail system in the late 19th century. He orchestrated reorganizations and consolidations in all parts of the United States. Morgan raised large sums in Europe, where an active section of the London Stock Exchange was dedicated to &quot;American rails&quot;, but instead of only handling the funds, he helped the railroads reorganize and achieve greater efficiencies. He fought against the speculators interested in speculative profits, and built a vision of an integrated transportation system. In 1885, he reorganized the New York, West Shore &amp; Buffalo Railroad, leasing it to the New York Central. In 1886, he reorganized the Philadelphia &amp; Reading, and in 1888 the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio. He was heavily involved with railroad tycoon James J. Hill and the Great Northern Railway.

Industrialists such as Morgan, Cornelius Vanderbilt and Jay Gould became wealthy through railroad ownerships, as large railroad companies such as the Grand Trunk Railway and the Southern Pacific Transportation Company spanned several states. In response to monopolistic practices and other excesses of some railroads and their owners, Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act and created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1887. The ICC indirectly controlled the business activities of the railroads through the issuance of extensive regulations.

Morgan set up conferences in 1889 and 1890 that brought together railroad presidents in order to help the industry follow the new laws and write agreements for the maintenance of &quot;public, reasonable, uniform and stable rates.&quot; The conferences were the first of their kind, and by creating a community of interest among competing lines paved the way for the great consolidations of the early 20th century. Congress responded by enacting antitrust legislation to prohibit monopolies of railroads (and other industries), beginning with the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890.

The Panic of 1893 was the largest economic depression in U.S. history at that time. It was the result of railroad overbuilding and shaky railroad financing, which set off a series of bank failures. One-quarter of U.S. railroads had failed by mid-1894, representing over . The failed lines included the Northern Pacific Railway, the Union Pacific Railroad and the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad. Acquisitions of the bankrupt companies led to further consolidation of ownership. As of 1906, two-thirds of the rail mileage in the U.S. was controlled by seven entities, with the New York Central, Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), and Morgan having the largest portions.

James J. Hill joined forces with Morgan and others to gain control of the Northern Pacific. Hill formed the Northern Securities Company to consolidate the operations of the Northern Pacific with Hill&#x27;s own Great Northern, but President Theodore Roosevelt, a trust-buster, strongly disapproved and took it to court. In 1904 the federal courts dissolved the Northern Security company (&quot;see Northern Securities Co. v. United States&quot;) and the railroads had to go their separate, competitive ways. By that time Morgan and Hill had ensured the Northern Pacific was well-organized and able to survive easily on its own.

In 1901 the Union Pacific Railroad acquired all of the stock of the Southern Pacific. The federal government charged UP with violating the Sherman Act, and in 1913 the Supreme Court ordered UP to divest itself of all SP stock. This ruling was received with considerable alarm throughout the industry, as UP and SP were widely considered at that time not to be significant competitors. (Later in the 20th century, with different economic conditions and changes in the law, UP successfully acquired the SP. &quot;See&quot; Resurgence of freight railroads in the 1980s.)

Continuing concern over rate discrimination by railroads led Congress to enact additional laws, giving increased regulatory powers to the ICC. The 1906 Hepburn Act gave the ICC authority to set maximum rates and review the companies&#x27; financial records. The Mann-Elkins Act of 1910 strengthened the ICC&#x27;s authority over railroad rates. Subsequently, railroads had difficulty securing revenue sufficient to keep pace with their rising costs, and by 1915 one-sixth of the railroad trackage in the country belonged to roads in receivership (bankruptcy).

US railroads were at their peak length of trackage in 1916 with of tracks.

===Nationalized management (1917–1920)===
The United States Railroad Administration (USRA) temporarily took over management of railroads during World War I to address inadequacy in critical facilities throughout the overall system, such as terminals, trackage, and rolling stock. President Woodrow Wilson issued an order for nationalization on December 26, 1917. Management by USRA led to standardization of equipment, reductions of duplicative passenger services, and better coordination of freight traffic. Federal control of the railroads ended in March 1920 under the Esch–Cummins Act.

===Railroads in the early automobile/trucking era (1921–1945)===
Following the war, some members of Congress, the ICC, and some railroad executives developed concerns about inefficiencies in the American railroad system. Memories of the 1893 panic, the continuing proliferation of railroad companies, and duplicative facilities, fueled this concern. To an extent, the need to nationalize the system during the war was an example of this inefficiency. These concerns were the impetus for legislation to consider improvements to the system. The Esch-Cummins Act directed the ICC to prepare and adopt a plan for the consolidation of the railroad companies into a limited number of systems.

During the 1920s the railroad industry, with its rates and routes continuing to be set by the ICC, was facing increasing competition from other modes of transportation: trucking and airplanes. These competing modes were basically unregulated at the time; this competition was not acknowledged in the railroad legislation. The newer transport modes also received extensive financial assistance from government, such as in the construction of highways and rural roads, and the construction of airports. The competition contributed to the railroads&#x27; eventual decline in the 1920s and beyond, and which was amplified in the 1930s during the Great Depression. 

In 1929 the ICC published its proposed &quot;Complete Plan of Consolidation,&quot; also known as the &quot;Ripley Plan,&quot; after its author, William Z. Ripley of Harvard University. The agency held hearings on the plan, but none of the proposed consolidations was ever implemented. Many small railroads failed during the Great Depression. Of those lines that survived, the stronger ones were not interested in supporting the weaker ones. In 1940 Congress formally abandoned the Ripley Plan.

===Modern era (1946–present)===
During the post-World War II boom many railroads were driven out of business due to competition from airlines and Interstate highways. The rise of the automobile led to the end of passenger train service on most railroads. Trucking businesses had become major competitors by the 1930s with the advent of improved paved roads, and after the war they expanded their operations as the Interstate highway network grew, and acquired increased market share of freight business. Railroads continued to carry bulk freight such as coal, steel and other commodities. However, the ICC continued to regulate railroad rates and other aspects of railroad operations, which limited railroads&#x27; flexibility in responding to changing market forces.

In 1966, Congress created the Federal Railroad Administration, to issue and enforce rail safety regulations, administer railroad assistance programs, and conduct research and development in support of improved railroad safety and national rail transportation policy. The safety functions were transferred from the ICC. The FRA was established as part of the new federal Department of Transportation.

Two of the largest remaining railroads, the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central, merged in 1968 to form the Penn Central. At the insistence of the ICC the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad was added to the merger in 1969; in 1970 the Penn Central declared bankruptcy, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history until then. Other bankrupt railroads included the Ann Arbor Railroad (1973), Erie Lackawanna Railway (1972), Lehigh Valley Railroad (1970), Reading Company (1971), Central Railroad of New Jersey (1967) and Lehigh and Hudson River Railway (1972).

In 1970 Congress created a government corporation, Amtrak, to take over operation of Penn Central passenger lines and selected inter-city passenger services from other private railroads, under the Rail Passenger Service Act. Amtrak began operations in 1971.

Congress passed the &quot;Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;3R Act&quot;) to salvage viable freight operations from the bankrupt Penn Central and other lines in the northeast, mid-Atlantic and midwestern regions, through the creation of the Consolidated Rail Corporation (ConRail), a government-owned corporation. Conrail began operations in 1976. The 3R Act also formed the United States Railway Association, another government corporation, taking over the powers of the ICC with respect to allowing the bankrupt railroads to abandon unprofitable lines.

Amtrak acquired most of the right-of-way and facilities of the Penn Central Northeast Corridor from Washington, D.C. to Boston, under the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act (the &quot;4R Act&quot;) of 1976.

In addition to freight railroads, Conrail inherited commuter rail operations from several predecessor railroads in the northeast, and these operations continued to be unprofitable. State and local government transportation agencies took over the passenger operations and acquired the various rights-of-way from Conrail in 1983, pursuant to the &quot;Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981.&quot; To replace the loss of commuter passenger rail service outside of the northeast region, state and local agencies established their own commuter systems in several metropolitan areas, generally by leasing rail lines from Amtrak or freight railroads.

The National Association of Railroad Passengers, a non-profit advocacy group, was organized in the late 1960s to support the operation of passenger trains.

Beginning in the late 1970s Amtrak eliminated several of its lightly traveled lines. Ridership stagnated at roughly 20 million passengers per year amid uncertain government aid from 1981 to about 2000. Ridership increased during the first decade of the 21st century after implementation of capital improvements in the Northeast Corridor and rises in automobile fuel costs.

In 1980 Congress enacted the Staggers Rail Act to revive freight traffic, by removing restrictive regulations and enabling railroads to be more competitive with the trucking industry. The &quot;Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981&quot; authorized additional deregulation of northeast railroads. Among other things, these laws reduced the role of the ICC in regulating the railroads and allowed the carriers to discontinue unprofitable routes. More railroad companies merged and consolidated their lines in order to remain successful. These changes led to the current system of fewer, but profitable, Class I railroads covering larger regions of the United States.

Since the beginning of the current deregulatory era, the following Class I railroads have been involved in mergers:
* Union Pacific acquired the Missouri Pacific and Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad in the 1980s, the Chicago and North Western in 1995, and the Southern Pacific in 1996
* CSX was formed in 1986 from the Chessie System and the Seaboard System
* BNSF Railway was formed in 1996 from the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe (the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;) and Burlington Northern
* Norfolk Southern was formed in 1982 from the Norfolk and Western and Southern Railway
* Canadian Pacific acquired the Delaware and Hudson in 1991, and purchased the Kansas City Southern Railway in 2021
* Canadian National acquired the Illinois Central in 1999
* CSX and Norfolk Southern acquired most of the Conrail freight rail assets in 1997.

In 1995, when most of the ICC&#x27;s powers had been eliminated, Congress finally abolished the agency and transferred its remaining functions to a new agency, the Surface Transportation Board.

;21st century
In the early 21st century, several of the railroads, along with the federal government and various port agencies, began to reinvest in freight rail infrastructure, such as intermodal terminals and bridge and tunnel improvements. These projects are designed to increase capacity and efficiency across the national rail network. Two examples are the Heartland Corridor and the National Gateway.

Both the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations had announced plans for new high-speed rail lines in their first terms. In the case of Clinton era, the only tangible outcome was the introduction of Amtrak&#x27;s Acela Express, serving the Northeast Corridor, in 2000. Obama even mentioned his rail plans in his State of the Union address, the first time in decades a President had done so. While several small scale improvements to rail lines were financed by federal money, more ambitious plans in Florida, Ohio and other states failed when newly elected Republican governors stopped existing high-speed rail plans and returned federal funding.

In 2015 construction began on the California High-Speed Rail line. The Phase I portion, which would link Los Angeles and San Francisco in under three hours, was originally projected to be completed in 2029 at a cost of $40 billion. By 2018 however, the project experienced numerous delays and cost miscalculations, with an estimated completion date of 2033 and a cost of $98.1 billion.

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, enacted in 2021, provides a major funding increase for passenger rail systems, including new rail lines and replacement of level crossings. Improvements to the Northeast Corridor funded by the law include bridge replacements and the construction of new rail tunnels under the Hudson River (&quot;see&quot; Gateway Program).

==Technology==

The B&amp;O established its Mount Clare Shops in Baltimore in 1829. This was the first railroad manufacturing facility in the U.S., and the company built locomotives, railroad cars, iron bridges and other equipment there. Following the B&amp;O example, U.S. railroad companies soon became self-sufficient, as thousands of domestic machine shops turned out products and thousands of inventors and tinkerers improved the equipment.

===Rail manufacturing===
In general, U.S. railroad companies imported technology from Britain in the 1830s, particularly strap iron rails, as there were no rail manufacturing facilities in the United States at that time. Heavy iron &quot;T&quot; rails were first manufactured in the U.S. in the mid-1840s at Mount Savage, Maryland and Danville, Pennsylvania. This improved rail design permitted higher train speeds and more reliable operation. Discovery of high-quality iron ores in the mid-19th century, particularly in the Great Lakes region, led to the fabrication of better-quality rails.

Steel rails began to replace iron later in the 19th century. Several railroads imported steel rails from England in the 1860s, and the first commercially available steel rails in the U.S. were manufactured in 1867 at the Cambria Iron Works in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. By the mid-1880s U.S. railroads were using more steel rails than iron in building new or replacement tracks.

===Track gauge===

Through the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, not only local projects, but long-distance links, were completed, so that by 1860 the eastern half of the continent, especially the Northeast, was linked by a network of connecting railroads. However, although Great Britain had early adopted a standard gauge of , once Americans started building locomotives, they experimented with different gauges, resulting in the standard gauge, or a close approximation, being adopted in the Northeast and Midwest U.S., but a gauge in the South, and a gauge in Canada. In addition, the Erie Railway was built to broad gauge, and in the 1870s a widespread movement looked at the cheaper narrow gauge.

The Pacific Railway Act of 1863 established the standard gauge for the first transcontinental railroad. Except for the narrow gauge, gauges were standardized across North America after the end of the Civil War in 1865.

===Locomotives===

In the early years American railroads imported many steam locomotives from England. While the B&amp;O and the PRR built many of their own steam locomotives, other railroads purchased from independent American manufacturers. Prominent among the early steam manufacturers were Norris, Baldwin and Rogers, followed by Lima and Alco later in the 19th and 20th centuries.

The Jeffrey Manufacturing Company of Columbus, Ohio built the first American electric mining locomotive in 1888.

Diesel locomotives were first developed in Europe after World War I, and U.S. railroads began to use them widely in the 1930s and 1940s. Most U.S. roads discontinued use of steam locomotives by the 1950s. A diesel engine was expensive to build, but was less complex and easier to maintain than a steam locomotive, and required only one person to operate. This meant reduced costs and greater reliability for the railroads. Several companies developed fast streamliner trains, such as the Super Chief and the California Zephyr during the 1930s and 1940s. Their locomotives used either diesel or similar internal combustion engine designs. &quot;See&quot; Dieselisation in North America.

Though electric railways expanded in Europe, they never reached the same popularity in North America. They were built primarily in the north-west and the north-east beginning in the late 19th century. While some railroads used electric locomotives for both freight and passenger trains, by the end of the 20th century most freight trains were pulled only by diesel locomotives. The Northeast Corridor, the most heavily traveled passenger line in the US, is one of few long lines currently operating with electrification. &quot;See&quot; Railroad electrification in the United States.

===Signalling and communications===

Early forms of American railroad signaling and communication were virtually non-existent; the railroads initially managed their train operations using timetables. However, there was no means of timely communication between engineers and dispatchers, and occasionally two trains inadvertently would be sent on a collision course, or &quot;cornfield meet.&quot; With the advent of the telegraph in the 1840s, more-sophisticated systems were developed that allowed the dissemination of alterations to the timetable, known as train orders. These orders temporarily overrode the timetable, allowing the rescheduling and cancellation or addition of trains. The earliest recorded use of train orders was by the Erie Railroad in 1851.

The development of the electrical track circuit in the 1870s led to the use of systems of block signals, which improved the railroads&#x27; safety, speed and efficiency. Mechanical interlockings, which prevented conflicting movements at rail junctions and crossings, were also introduced in the U.S. in the 1870s, after their initial development in Britain. By the mid-20th century railroads had begun replacing mechanical interlockings with electronic interlocking systems.

The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 strengthened several aspects of railroad safety. Most notable is a requirement for installation of positive train control technology on most of the US railroad network. The technology was operational on all required railroads in 2020.

==Labor relations and worker safety==
Railways changed employment practices in many ways. Lines with hundreds or thousands of employees developed systematic rules and procedures, not only for running the equipment but in hiring, promoting, paying and supervising employees. The railway system of management was adopted by all major business sectors. Railways offered a new type of work experience in enterprises vastly larger in size, complexity and management. At first workers were recruited from occupations where skills were roughly analogous and transferable, that is, workshop mechanics from the iron, machine and building trades; conductors from stagecoach drivers, steamship stewards and mail boat captains; station masters from commerce and commission agencies; and clerks from government offices.

In response to the strikes of the 1870s and 1880s, Congress passed the &quot;Arbitration Act of 1888,&quot; which authorized the creation of arbitration panels with the power to investigate the causes of labor disputes and to issue non-binding arbitration awards. The Act was a complete failure: only one panel was ever convened under the Act, and that one, in the case of the 1894 Pullman Strike, issued its report only after the strike had been crushed by a federal court injunction backed by federal troops.
Congress attempted to correct these shortcomings in the Erdman Act, passed in 1898. This law likewise provided for voluntary arbitration, but made any award issued by the panel binding and enforceable in federal court. It also outlawed discrimination against employees for union activities, prohibited &quot;yellow dog&quot; contracts (employee agrees not to join a union while employed), and required both sides to maintain the status quo during any arbitration proceedings and for three months after an award was issued. The arbitration procedures were rarely used. A successor statute, the Newlands Labor Act, was passed in 1913 and proved more effective, but was largely superseded when the federal government nationalized the railroads in 1917.

As railroads expanded after the Civil War, so too did the rate of accidents among railroad personnel, especially brakemen. Many accidents were associated with the coupling and uncoupling of railroad cars, and the operation of manually operated brakes (hand brakes). The rise in accidents led to calls for safety legislation, as early as the 1870s. In the 1880s, the number of on-the-job fatalities of railroad workers was second only to those of coal miners. Through that decade, several state legislatures enacted safety laws. However, the specific requirements varied among the states, making implementation difficult for interstate rail carriers, and Congress passed the Safety Appliance Act in 1893 to provide a uniform standard. The law required railroads to install air brakes and automatic couplers on all trains, and led to a sharp drop in accidents.

The Esch–Cummins Act of 1920 terminated the nationalization program and created a Railway Labor Board (RLB) to regulate wages and issue non-binding proposals to settle disputes. In 1921 the RLB ordered a twelve percent reduction in employees&#x27; wages, which led to the Great Railroad Strike of 1922, involving rail shop workers nationwide, followed by a court injunction to end the strike. Congress passed the Railway Labor Act of 1926 to rectify the shortcomings of the RLB procedures.

Congress added railroad worker safety laws throughout the 20th century. Significant among this legislation is the &quot;Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970,&quot; which gave the FRA broad responsibilities over all aspects of rail safety, and expanded the agency&#x27;s authority to cover all railroads, both interstate and intrastate.

==Impact on American economy and society==
According to historian Henry Adams the system of railroads needed:
:the energies of a generation, for it required all the new machinery to be created—capital, banks, mines, furnaces, shops, power-houses, technical knowledge, mechanical population, together with a steady remodelling of social and political habits, ideas, and institutions to fit the new scale and suit the new conditions. The generation between 1865 and 1895 was already mortgaged to the railways, and no one knew it better than the generation itself. The impact can be examined through five aspects: shipping, finance, management, careers, and popular reaction.

===Shipping freight and passengers, and the overall significance of the railroads===
First they provided a highly efficient network for shipping freight and passengers across a large national market. The result was a transforming impact on most sectors of the economy including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture and finance. Supplemented with the Telegraph that added rapid communications, the United States now had an integrated national market practically the size of Europe, with no internal barriers or tariffs, all supported by a common language, and financial system and a common legal system. The railroads at first supplemented, then largely replaced the previous transportation modes of turnpikes and canals, rivers and intracoastal ocean traffic. Highly efficient Northern railroads played a major role in winning the Civil War, while the overburdened Southern lines collapsed in the face of an insurmountable challenge. In the late 19th century pipelines were built for the oil trade, and in the 20th century trucking and aviation emerged.

Railroads not only increased the speed of transportation, they also dramatically lowered its cost. The first transcontinental railroad resulted in passengers and freight being able to cross the country in a matter of days instead of months and at one tenth the cost of stagecoach or wagon transport. This was particularly significant in the West, which has few navigable rivers. As a result of the tremendous reduction in freight rates that rail transportation provided compared to the high cost of wagon transportation, now farming, ranching and mining could be done at a profit throughout the West.

For example, before the railroads were built in the West, if a farmer were to ship a load of corn only 200 miles to Chicago, the cost of shipping it there by wagon would exceed the price for which the corn could be sold. So, under such circumstances, farming could not be done at a profit. Mining and other economic activity in the West were similarly inhibited because of the high cost of wagon transportation. One Congressman referring to the West, bluntly stated that “All that land wasn’t worth ten cents until the railroads came.”

Freight rates by rail were a small fraction of what they had been with wagon transport. By 1887, it was calculated that the railroads were hauling a thousand ton-miles of freight for every person in the United States annually, and that if this freight were hauled by wagon, it would cost 20 times as much (and cost more than the entire value of the country’s gross national product). When the United States bought the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, people thought that it would take 300 years to populate it. With the introduction of the railroad, it took only 30 years. The low cost of shipping by rail resulted in what had been referred to on maps as the Great American Desert becoming the great American breadbasket.

===Basis of the private financial system===
Railroads financing provided the basis of the private (non-governmental) financial system. Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories or canals. The famous Erie canal, long in upstate New York, cost $7 million of state money, which was about what private investors spent on one short railroad in Western Massachusetts. A new steamboat on the Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, or Ohio rivers cost about the same as one mile of track.

In 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897 it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion).
Funding came from financiers throughout the Northeast, and from Europe, especially Britain. The federal government provided no cash to any other railroads. However it did provide unoccupied free land to some of the Western railroads, so they could sell it to farmers and have customers along the route. Some cash came from states, or from local governments that use money as a leverage to prevent being bypassed by the main line. The larger sound came from the southern states during the Reconstruction era, as they try to rebuild their destroyed rail system. Some states such as Maine and Texas also made land grants to local railroads; the state total was 49 million acres. The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds. Boston was the first center, but New York by 1860 was the dominant financial market. The British invested heavily in railroads around the world, but nowhere more so than the United States; The total came to about $3 billion by 1914. In 1914–1917, they liquidated their American assets to pay for war supplies.

===Inventing modern management===
The third dimension was in designing complex managerial systems that could handle far more complicated simultaneous relationships that could be dreamed of by the local factory owner who could patrol every part of his own factory in a matter of hours. Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads. The leading innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1840s, the Erie in the 1850s and the Pennsylvania in the 1860s.

After a serious accident, the Western Railroad of Massachusetts put in place a system of responsibility for district managers and dispatchers to keep track of all train movements. Discipline was essential—everyone had to follow the rules exactly to prevent accidents. Decision-making powers had to be distributed to ensure safety and to juggle the complexity of numerous trains running in both directions on a single track, keeping to schedules that could easily be disrupted by weather mechanical breakdowns, washouts or hitting a wandering cow. As the lines grew longer with more and more business originating at dozens of different stations, the Baltimore and Ohio set up more complex system that separated finances from daily operations. The Erie Railroad, faced with growing competition, had to make lower bids for freight movement, and had to know on a daily basis how much each train was costing them. Statistics was the weapon of choice. By the 1860s, the Pennsylvania Railroad—the largest in the world—was making further advances in using bureaucracy under John Edgar Thomson, president 1852–1874. He divided the system into several geographical divisions, which each reported daily to a general superintendent in Philadelphia. All the American railroads copied each other in the new managerial advances, and by the 1870s emerging big businesses in the industrial field likewise copied the railroad model.

=== Career paths===
The fourth dimension was in management of the workforce, both blue-collar workers and white-collar workers. Railroading became a career in which young men entered at about age 18 to 20, and spent their entire lives usually with the same line. Young men could start working on the tracks, become a fireman, and work his way up to the engineer. The mechanical world of the roundhouses have their own career tracks. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer, be promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakeman at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57. Women were not hired.

White-collar careers paths likewise were delineated. Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters. At each level, they had more and more knowledge experience and human capital. They were very hard to replace, and were virtually guaranteed permanent jobs and provided with insurance and medical care. Hiring, firing and wage rates were set not by the foreman, but by central administrators, in order to minimize favoritism and personality conflicts. Everything was by the book, and increasingly complex set of rules told everyone exactly what they should do it every circumstance, and exactly what their rank and pay would be. Young men who were first hired in the 1840s and 1850s retired from the same railroad 40 or 50 years later. To discourage them from leaving for another company, they were promised pensions when they retired. Indeed, the railroads invented the American pension system.

===Early attitudes towards railroads===
Boosters in every city worked feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it. The mechanical size, scope and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression; people would dress in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in. David Nye argues that:
:The startling introduction of railroads into this agricultural society provoked a discussion that soon arrived at the enthusiastic consensus that railways were sublime and that they would help to unify, dignify, expand and enrich the nation. They became part of the public celebrations of Republicanism. The rhetoric, the form, and the central figures of civic ceremonies changed to accommodate the intrusion of this technology... [Between 1828 and 1869] Americans integrated the railroad into the national economy and enfolded it within the sublime.

Travel became much easier, cheaper and more common. Shoppers from small towns could make day trips to big city stores. Hotels, resorts and tourist attractions were built to accommodate the demand. The realization that anyone could buy a ticket for a thousand-mile trip was empowering. Historians Gary Cross and Rick Szostak argue:
: with the freedom to travel came a greater sense of national identity and a reduction in regional cultural diversity. Farm children could more easily acquaint themselves with the big city, and easterners could readily visit the West. It is hard to imagine the United States of continental proportions without the railroad.

The engineers became model citizens, bringing their can-do spirit and their systematic work effort to all phases of the economy as well as local and national government. By 1910, major cities were building magnificent palatial railroad stations, including Pennsylvania Station in New York City, and Washington Union Station in Washington D.C.

As early as the 1830s, novelists and poets began fretting that the railroads would destroy the rustic attractions of the American landscape. By the 1840s concerns were rising about terrible accidents when speeding trains crashed into helpless wooden carriages. By the 1870s, railroads were vilified by Western farmers who absorbed the Granger movement theme that monopolistic carriers controlled too much pricing power, and that the state legislatures had to impose maximum prices. Local merchants and shippers supported the demand and got some &quot;Granger Laws&quot; passed. Anti-railroad complaints were loudly repeated in late 19th century political rhetoric. The idea of establishing a strong rate fixing federal body was achieved during the Progressive Era, primarily by a coalition of shipping interests. Railroad historians mark the 1906 Hepburn Act that gave the ICC the power to set maximum railroad rates as a damaging blow to the long-term profitability and growth of railroads. After 1910 the lines faced an emerging trucking industry to compete with for freight, and automobiles and buses to compete for passenger service.

== Environmental history of railways ==
Railways also disrupted the natural tendencies of the environment through an increased capacity for transportation. Railroads throughout the United States allowed quicker, more efficient transport of goods and people that were previously unavailable. Agriculture, animals, soldiers, goods, and natural resources were now able to move large distances in much shorter amounts of time. As a result, things that were not harvested before like certain tracts of arable land or animal populations were now being used.

=== Impact on buffalo population ===
During the first half of the 19th century, herds of buffalo were plentiful throughout the Midwestern states of America, but the American people through Manifest Destiny drastically changed the American landscape. Before the Civil War, 8 million buffalo roamed free, but only 4–6 million remained after the war because their hides had become valuable throughout the country and domestic horses and cattle had begun to occupy the same space and graze the same land as the bison. William Hornaday, an influential zoologist and student of the American bison, wrote, &quot;as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country, the slaughter began.&quot; Railroads gave rise to the consumption of buffalo because hunters and businessmen could transport parts of the buffalo to distant parts of the country where demand was high. Before, it was not plausible to commercialize the buffalo because the hide, meat, and bones since it would take so much longer to get to their destination. Since railroads made transportation much quicker, it was now plausible for people to make money off the seemingly endless resource in the plains of the Midwest: the buffalo. So extreme was the mass hunting of buffalo thanks to the new railroads that wolves could not consume all of the carcasses that were left behind.

As a result of the rapidly declining bison population, economic opportunities arose through the creation of jobs. Men acquired jobs hunting and skinning bison on the plains, as well as maintaining railroad infrastructure used to transport the valuable bison hides.

=== Railroads in popular culture ===
The aggressive operation of a locomotive at the imaginary “Pile-up station” by fictional engineer “Joe Smashup” formed the basis of a satire that appeared in US newspapers in and around the year 1855.

==Historiography==
There is no question about the importance of railroads in American history. Churella finds that back in the 1950s business and economic historians, led by Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. and Robert Fogel, made railroads the centerpiece of advanced historiography. That era has passed as courses on railroad history do not make the curriculum, and the historiography has shifted away from professional historian to the &quot;railfans&quot;—very well informed amateur writers fascinated by the memorabilia, technology and locomotives of the steam era. Looking at the voluminous output of railfan authors, Klein says:

:&quot;The vast bulk of this work is devoted to minute descriptions of power, rolling stock, obscure short lines, and technical subjects... But few address the larger questions of railroad history or place their topic in broader contexts.&quot;

The result is a multiplicity of histories of specific railroads, large and small. Typically they deal with standard topics: the builders and their organizational, legislative and financial dealings; colorful construction crews laying down wood ties and steel rail; the development of locomotives and passenger cars; boosters who sought a stop in their little town else it would die; the 1880–1920 golden age of the passenger long-distance travel and local excursions; the steady erosion of passenger service during the automobile age; the freight agent and the small-town depot. They end with the more recent saga of retrenchment, merger, and abandonment. From outside the field of railroad history, academic labor historians now deal with the culture of the workers, strikes, the careers for blue collar and white collar men, and racial discrimination. Academic political historians deal with the Granger, Populist and Progressive attacks, and in federal or state regulation.

<text>Waste treatment refers to the activities required to ensure that waste has the least practicable impact on the environment. In many countries various forms of waste treatment are required by law.

==Solid waste treatment==

The treatment of solid wastes is a key component of waste management. Different forms of solid waste treatment are graded in the waste hierarchy.

==Waste water treatment ==
===Agricultural waste water treatment===
Agricultural wastewater treatment is treatment and disposal of liquid animal waste, pesticide residues etc. from agriculture.

===Industrial wastewater treatment===
Industrial wastewater treatment is the treatment of wet wastes from factories, mines, power plants and other commercial facilities.

===Sewage treatment===
Sewage treatment is the treatment and disposal of human waste. Sewage is produced by all human communities. Treatment in urbanized areas is typically handled by centralized treatment systems. Alternative systems may use composting processes or processes that separate solid materials by settlement and then convert soluble contaminants into biological sludge and into gases such as carbon dioxide or methane.

==Radioactive waste treatment==

Radioactive waste treatment is the treatment and containment of radioactive waste.

<text>Wastewater treatment is a process which removes and eliminates contaminants from wastewater. It thus converts it into an effluent that can be returned to the water cycle. Once back in the water cycle, the effluent creates an acceptable impact on the environment. It is also possible to reuse it. This process is called water reclamation. The treatment process takes place in a wastewater treatment plant. There are several kinds of wastewater which are treated at the appropriate type of wastewater treatment plant. For domestic wastewater the treatment plant is called a Sewage Treatment. Municipal wastewater or sewage are other names for domestic wastewater. For industrial wastewater, treatment takes place in a separate Industrial wastewater treatment, or in a sewage treatment plant. In the latter case it usually follows pre-treatment. Further types of wastewater treatment plants include Agricultural wastewater treatment and leachate treatment plants.

One common process in wastewater treatment is phase separation, such as sedimentation. Biological and chemical processes such as oxidation are another example. Polishing is also an example. The main by-product from wastewater treatment plants is a type of sludge that is usually treated in the same or another wastewater treatment plant. Biogas can be another by-product if the process uses anaerobic treatment. Treated wastewater can be reused as reclaimed water. The main purpose of wastewater treatment is for the treated wastewater to be able to be disposed or reused safely. However, before it is treated, the options for disposal or reuse must be considered so the correct treatment process is used on the wastewater.

The term &quot;wastewater treatment&quot; is often used to mean &quot;sewage treatment&quot;.

== Types of treatment plants ==

Wastewater treatment plants may be distinguished by the type of wastewater to be treated. There are numerous processes that can be used to treat wastewater depending on the type and extent of contamination. The treatment steps include physical, chemical and biological treatment processes.

Types of wastewater treatment plants include:
* Sewage treatment plants
* Industrial wastewater treatment plants
* Agricultural wastewater treatment plants
* Leachate treatment plants

=== Sewage treatment plants ===

===Industrial wastewater treatment plants===
===Agricultural wastewater treatment plants===
=== Leachate treatment plants ===

Leachate treatment plants are used to treat leachate from landfills. Treatment options include: biological treatment, mechanical treatment by ultrafiltration, treatment with active carbon filters, electrochemical treatment including electrocoagulation by various proprietary technologies and reverse osmosis membrane filtration using disc tube module technology.

== Unit processes ==
The unit processes involved in wastewater treatment include physical processes such as settlement or flotation and biological processes such oxidation or anaerobic treatment. Some wastewaters require specialized treatment methods. At the simplest level, treatment of most wastewaters is carried out through separation of solids from liquids, usually by sedimentation. By progressively converting dissolved material into solids, usually a biological floc or biofilm, which is then settled out or separated, an effluent stream of increasing purity is produced.

=== Phase separation ===

Phase separation transfers impurities into a non-aqueous phase. Phase separation may occur at intermediate points in a treatment sequence to remove solids generated during oxidation or polishing. Grease and oil may be recovered for fuel or saponification. Solids often require dewatering of sludge in a wastewater treatment plant. Disposal options for dried solids vary with the type and concentration of impurities removed from water.

Solids such as stones, grit, and sand may be removed from wastewater by gravity when density differences are sufficient to overcome dispersion by turbulence. This is typically achieved using a grit channel designed to produce an optimum flow rate that allows grit to settle and other less-dense solids to be carried forward to the next treatment stage. Gravity separation of solids is the primary treatment of sewage, where the unit process is called &quot;primary settling tanks&quot; or &quot;primary sedimentation tanks&quot;. It is also widely used for the treatment of other types of wastewater. Solids that are denser than water will accumulate at the bottom of quiescent settling basins. More complex clarifiers also have skimmers to simultaneously remove floating grease such as soap scum and solids such as feathers, wood chips, or condoms. Containers like the API oil-water separator are specifically designed to separate non-polar liquids.

=== Biological and chemical processes ===
====Oxidation====
Oxidation reduces the biochemical oxygen demand of wastewater, and may reduce the toxicity of some impurities. Secondary treatment converts organic compounds into carbon dioxide, water, and biosolids through oxidation and reduction reactions. Chemical oxidation is widely used for disinfection.

=====Biochemical oxidation (secondary treatment)=====
=====Chemical oxidation=====

Advanced oxidation processes are used to remove some persistent organic pollutants and concentrations remaining after biochemical oxidation. Disinfection by chemical oxidation kills bacteria and microbial pathogens by adding hydroxyl radicals such as ozone, chlorine or hypochlorite to wastewater. These hydroxyl radical then break down complex compounds in the organic pollutants into simple compounds such as water, carbon dioxide, and salts.

==== Anaerobic treatment ====
Anaerobic wastewater treatment processes (for example UASB, EGSB) are also widely applied in the treatment of industrial wastewaters and biological sludge.

===Polishing===

Polishing refers to treatments made in further advanced treatment steps after the above methods (also called &quot;fourth stage&quot; treatment). These treatments may also be used independently for some industrial wastewater. Chemical reduction or pH adjustment minimizes chemical reactivity of wastewater following chemical oxidation. Carbon filtering removes remaining contaminants and impurities by chemical absorption onto activated carbon. Filtration through sand (calcium carbonate) or fabric filters is the most common method used in municipal wastewater treatment.

<text>Portneuf County (, ) is a historic county in Quebec, Canada west of Quebec City on the Saint Lawrence River in Canada.

The county seat was Cap-Santé. Previously named Hampshire County (after Hampshire, England) formed in 1792 at the end of the French Regime from the former Montreal District and as a constituent riding for the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada before being renamed Portneuf County by a law of the province of Lower Canada (9 George IV ch. LXXII) in 1829. It was bounded on the west by Champlain County on the northeast by Quebec County, and on the south by Lotbiniere County. Portneuf County consisted of six former seigneuries.

In the early 1980s, Quebec abolished its counties and most of Portneuf County became the Portneuf Regional County Municipality. The southeastern part of the county was transferred to La Jacques-Cartier Regional County Municipality and the Quebec Urban Community (now Quebec City) while parts of western Portneuf County were transferred to Mékinac Regional County Municipality.

<text>Alexandra Konstantinovna Kosteniuk (; born 23 April 1984) is a Russian and Swiss chess grandmaster who was the Women&#x27;s World Chess Champion from 2008 to 2010 and Women&#x27;s World Rapid Chess Champion in 2021. She was European women&#x27;s champion in 2004 and a two-time Russian Women&#x27;s Chess Champion (in 2005 and 2016). Kosteniuk won the team gold medal playing for Russia at the Women&#x27;s Chess Olympiads of 2010, 2012 and 2014; the Women&#x27;s World Team Chess Championship of 2017; and the Women&#x27;s European Team Chess Championships of 2007, 2009, 2011, 2015 and 2017; and the Women&#x27;s Chess World Cup 2021. In 2022, due to sanctions imposed on Russian players after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, she switched federations, and as of March 2023 she represents Switzerland.

==Chess career==
Kosteniuk learned to play chess at the age of five after being taught by her father. She graduated in 2003 from the Russian State Academy of Physical Education in Moscow as a certified professional chess trainer. As a child, she played casual chess for money, in order to earn resources for chess trips.

Kosteniuk won the girls under 10 division of the European Youth Chess Championship in 1994 and the girls under 12 title at both the European Youth Championships and World Youth Chess Championships in 1996. At twelve years of age she also became the Russian women&#x27;s champion in rapid chess.

In 2001, at the age of 17, she reached the final of the World Women&#x27;s Chess Championship won by Zhu Chen.

Kosteniuk became European women&#x27;s champion by winning the tournament in Dresden, Germany. As she achieved this with a performance rating above 2600, she was awarded the grandmaster title in November 2004, becoming the tenth woman to receive the highest title of the World Chess Federation (FIDE). Before that, she had also obtained the titles of Woman Grandmaster in 1998 and International Master in 2000.
In 2005, she won the Russian Women&#x27;s Championship.

In August 2006, she became the first Chess960 women&#x27;s world champion after beating Germany&#x27;s top female player Elisabeth Pähtz by 5½–2½. She defended that title successfully in 2008 by beating Kateryna Lagno However, Kosteniuk&#x27;s greatest success so far has been to win the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship 2008, beating in the final the young Chinese prodigy Hou Yifan with a score of Later in the same year, she won the women&#x27;s individual blitz event of the 2008 World Mind Sports Games in Beijing.

In the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship 2010 Kosteniuk was eliminated in the third round by the eventual runner-up, Ruan Lufei, and thus lost her title.

In 2013, Kosteniuk became the first woman to win the &quot;men&#x27;s&quot; (i.e. universal) Swiss Chess Championship. She also won the women Swiss champion title.

In 2014, she tied for first place with Kateryna Lagno in the Women&#x27;s World Rapid Championship, which was held in Khanty-Mansiysk, and took the silver medal on tiebreak, as Lagno won the direct encounter.

In 2015 Kosteniuk won the European–ACP Women&#x27;s Rapid Championship in Kutaisi. In July of the same year, she lost the Swiss championship playoff to Vadim Milov, and was declared women&#x27;s Swiss champion. Kosteniuk again won the Russian Women&#x27;s Championship.

In 2017 she won the European ACP Women&#x27;s Blitz Championship in Monte Carlo.

In late May, Alexandra faced Ukrainian-American International Master Anna Zatonskih in the quarterfinal match of the 2019 Women&#x27;s Speed Chess Championship, an online blitz and bullet competition hosted by Chess.com. Kosteniuk dominated the match and won with an overall score of 20–8. In late November, Kosteniuk won the European Women&#x27;s rapid and blitz championships in Monaco. In December, she shared first place in the second leg of FIDE Women&#x27;s Grand Prix 2019–20 in Monaco.

<text>The University of Libya () was a public university based in Tripoli and Benghazi, Libya. The university was established in 1955 and disestablished in 1973, when its colleges were split into two new universities: the University of Tripoli (later Al Fateh University) in Tripoli, and the University of Benghazi (later Garyounis University) in Benghazi.

== History ==

===Origins ===
Despite its difficult economic situation at the time, in the 1950s the Libyan government decided to found a university. Towards that goal it sent a delegation to Egypt in 1955 to meet the then-prime minister Gamal Abdul Nasser, and request him to lend some lecturers working in Egypt. The Egyptian government agreed, and promised to pay the salaries of the four borrowed lecturers for four years. The U.S. nominated Professor Majid Khadduri to be the dean of Faculty of Literature, and committed to pay his salary.

A royal decree was issued on 15 December 1955 for the founding of the university. The first faculty to be formed was the Faculty of Literature in Benghazi, and the royal palace &quot;Al Manar&quot;, from which King Idris I of Libya declared the country&#x27;s independence on 24 December 1951, was assigned to be the campus.

===Expansion===
The next step was of course to extend the university and establish new faculties:
*Faculty of Science, Tripoli, 1956.
*Faculty of Economics, Benghazi, 1957.
*Faculty of Law, Benghazi, 1962.
*Faculty of Agriculture, Tripoli, 1966.
*Faculty of Medicine, Benghazi, 1970.

On 6 October 1968, a celebration was held for the founding of a new campus in Garyounis district of Benghazi. The celebration was attended by King Idris I, Wanis al-Qaddafi, the Prime Minister, and Abdel Moula Dughman, President of the university.

===Split===

In August 1973 the university split to form two new universities:
*the Tripoli Campus formed the University of Tripoli; and

After 7 April 1976 the two new universities were renamed as follows:
*the University of Tripoli became Al Fateh University; and 
*the University of Benghazi became Garyounis University.

==Presidents==
A list of presidents of the University of Libya:
*Mahmud El Bishti (1956–1958)
*Abdel Jawad el Freitees (1958–1961)
*Bakry Gaddura (1961–1963)
*Mutapha Bayo (1963–1967)

<doc id="588018" wikidata="Q435755" url="?curid=588018" title="Tudor Arghezi">
<text>Ion Nae Theodorescu (21 May 1880 – 14 July 1967) was a Romanian writer who wrote under the pen name Tudor Arghezi (. He is best known for his unique contribution to poetry and children&#x27;s literature.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He graduated from Saint Sava High School in October 1896, started working to pay for his studies, and made his debut in 1896, publishing verses in Alexandru Macedonski&#x27;s magazine &quot;Liga Ortodoxă&quot; under the name &quot;Ion Theo&quot;. Soon after, Macedonski, the herald of Romanian Symbolism, publicized his praise for the young poet: 
&quot;This young man, at an age when I was still prattling verses, with an audacity that knows no boundaries, but not yet crowned by the most glittering success, parts with the entire old versification technique, with all banalities in images in ideas that have for long been judged, here and elsewhere, as a summit of poetry and art.&quot;

He began stating his admiration for Symbolism and other trends pertaining to it (such as the Vienna Secession) in his articles of the time, while polemicizing with &quot;Junimea&quot;&#x27;s George Panu over the latter&#x27;s critique of modernist literature. In 1904, he and Vasile Demetrius published their own magazine, &quot;Linia Dreaptă&quot;, which ceased to exist after only five issues. Arghezi, Gala Galaction, and Demetrius maintained a close friendship, as witnessed by the latter&#x27;s daughter, the actress and novelist Lucia Demetrius.

After a four-year-long stint as an Orthodox monk at Cernica Monastery, he traveled abroad in 1905. He visited Paris and then moved to Fribourg, where he wrote poetry and attended courses at the local University; dissatisfied with the Roman Catholic focus encouraged by the latter, he moved to Geneva, where he was employed in a jeweler&#x27;s workshop. During the Romanian Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1907, the poet, known for his left-wing discourse and vocal criticism of the violent repression of the peasant movement, was kept under surveillance by Swiss authorities; a local newspaper claimed that Arghezi&#x27;s mail had been tampered with, causing a scandal that led to the resignation of several officials. News he gathered of the revolt itself left a lasting impression on Arghezi: much later, he was to dedicate an entire volume to the events (his &quot;1907-Peizaje&quot;, &quot;Landscapes of 1907&quot;, which he described as &quot;dealing with [...] the contrast between a nation and an abusive, solitary, class&quot;).

===Early 1910s===
He returned to Romania in 1910, and published works in &quot;Viața Românească&quot;, &quot;Teatru&quot;, &quot;Rampa&quot;, and N. D. Cocea&#x27;s &quot;Facla&quot; and &quot;Viața Socială&quot;, as well as editing the magazine &quot;Cronica&quot; in collaboration with Galaction; his output was prolific, and a flurry of lyrics, political pamphlets and polemical articles gained him a good measure of notoriety among the theatrical, political and literary circles of the day. Cocea contributed to his early fame by publishing one of Arghezi&#x27;s first influential poems, &quot;Rugă de seară&quot; (&quot;Evening Prayer&quot;).

During the period, Arghezi also became a prominent art critic, and engaged in the defense of Ștefan Luchian, a painter who was suffering from multiple sclerosis and was facing charges of fraud (based on the suspicion that he could no longer paint, and had allowed his name to be signed to other people&#x27;s works).

He became a regular presence at the Bucharest Kübler Café, where a Bohemian circle of artists and intellectuals was being formed — it included the writers Ion Minulescu, Liviu Rebreanu, Eugen Lovinescu, Victor Eftimiu, Mihail Sorbul and Corneliu Moldovanu, as well as the painters Iosif Iser, Alexandru Satmari, Jean Alexandru Steriadi, the composer Alfons Castaldi, and the art collector Krikor Zambaccian. According to Zambaccian, Arghezi was more rarely seen at Bucharest&#x27;s other major literary venue, Casa Capșa. By that time, he was also an associate of the controversial political figure and art patron Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, and, with Galaction, Cocea, Minulescu, Adrian Maniu and various visual artists, he regularly attended a circle hosted by Bogdan-Pitești on Știrbey-Vodă, nearby the Cișmigiu Gardens. He authored a small poem in honor of Bogdan-Pitești.

After the outbreak of World War I, Arghezi wrote against the political camp led by the National Liberals and the group around Take Ionescu, both of whom aimed to have Romania enter the conflict on the side of the Entente (as an attempt the conquer Transylvania from Austria-Hungary); instead, he was a supporter of Bessarabia&#x27;s union with the Romanian Old Kingdom, and resented the implicit alliance with Imperial Russia. In 1915, he wrote:
&quot;A barbaric war. Once upon a time, we had pledged our duty to fight against the arming of civilized states. With every newborn baby, the quantity of explosive matter destined to suppress him was also being created. As progress and «rational outlook» were being viewed as calamities, arms and ammunitions factories were increasing the shell storages, were fabricating the artillery used in extermination.&quot;

===German occupation and Văcărești Prison===
Eventually, he collaborated with the German authorities who had occupied most of Romania in late 1916 (&quot;see Romanian Campaign&quot;), and wrote articles for the German-backed &quot;Gazeta Bucureștilor&quot;; he was one among the diverse grouping of intellectuals to do so — it also included Bogdan-Pitești, Galaction, Constantin Stere, Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu, Alexandru Marghiloman, Ioan Slavici, Grigore Antipa, and Simion Mehedinți.

Arrested along with eleven other newspapermen and writers, among them Slavici, he was accused of &quot;collaboration with the enemy&quot; for his anti-Entente activities. According to Arghezi himself, the Royal Commissioner charged with investigation had initially kept the group secluded in a Bucharest hotel, arguing that they were an ongoing danger to Allied forces in Bucharest.

Sentenced and detained in the Văcărești Prison, Arghezi pleaded his cause in letters and petitions addressed to a &quot;Mr. General&quot;, who has been tentatively identified with Premier Artur Văitoianu, asking for a conditional release after his illegitimate son, Eli Lotar, with Constanța Zissu, who had been born in 1905, left home and went missing. Despite their political rivalry, Nicolae Iorga, who had given his full backing to the Entente during the war, repeatedly called on authorities to pardon Arghezi free; his plea was eventually granted, and Arghezi was released in late 1919. Expressing his thanks to Iorga for his intervention, he nonetheless continued to oppose him on several issues, and the polemic, turned sarcastic, was to prolong itself over the next two decades.

===Interwar literature===
In 1927, he published his first volume of collected poems, titled &quot;Cuvinte Potrivite&quot; (&quot;Fitting Words&quot; or &quot;Suitable Words&quot;), which made the Poporanist paper &quot;Viața Românească&quot;&#x27;s Mihai Ralea hail Arghezi as &quot;our greatest poet since Eminescu&quot; (while likening his &quot;mixture of the sublime and the awkward&quot; to &quot;nihilism&quot;). The avant-garde magazine &quot;Integral&quot; celebrated Arghezi with a special issue in 1925 – in it, Benjamin Fondane wrote: &quot;Arghezi is against all things: in his poetry, against eloquence, in favour of reinstating modesty, decency [...] [i]n his prose, against cowardice in expression, in favour of violence and indecency&quot;.

Arghezi was in charge of the satirical newspaper &quot;Bilete de Papagal&quot; and published his first prose effort, &quot;Icoane de Lemn&quot; (&quot;Wooden Icons&quot;), in 1928. In 1932, he published &quot;Flori de Mucigai&quot; (&quot;Flowers of Mildew&quot;) and &quot;Poarta Neagră&quot; (&quot;The Black Gate&quot;) – collections of poetry inspired by the years he spent in detention (in itself, a theme never before used in Romanian poetry) and influenced by the works of Charles Baudelaire and other Symbolists. He also began writing the works that made him most familiar to the public, his poems and short prose for children. Among the more famous are &quot;Cartea cu Jucării&quot; (&quot;The Toy-Laden Book&quot;), &quot;Cântec de Adormit Mitzura&quot; (&quot;A Song to Get Mitzura to Sleep&quot;), &quot;Buruieni&quot; (&quot;Weeds&quot;) and, the most popular of all, &quot;Zdreanță&quot; (&quot;Rag&quot;), about a lovable mutt.

In 1933–1934, he completed two satirical pieces, the dystopian novel &quot;Tablete din Țara de Kuty, povestiri swiftiene&quot; (&quot;Tablets from the Land of Kuty. Swiftian Stories&quot;) and &quot;Cimitirul Buna-Vestire&quot; (&quot;Buna-Vestire Cemetery&quot; – a large-scale pamphlet described as an &quot;apparent novel&quot; by George Călinescu), as well as a long novel on the topic of maternal love and filial devotion, &quot;Ochii Maicii Domnului&quot; (&quot;Our Lord&#x27;s Mother&#x27;s Eyes&quot;).

He routinely visited art shows throughout the 1920s (accompanied by Vasile and Lucia Demetrius), helping to establish the artistic reputation of painters such as Oscar Han, Nicolae Dărăscu, Camil Ressu, Francisc Șirato, and Nicolae Vermont. He also authored the preface to Nicolae Tonitza&#x27;s first art catalog, and welcomed &quot;Arta Română&quot;, the modernism group established by Tonitza and Gheorghe Petrașcu in 1920. By the mid-1930s, Arghezi contributed the art chronicle to the newspaper &quot;Mișcarea&quot; – mouthpiece of the National Liberal Party-Brătianu.

===Interwar polemic===
In 1934, his lyrical works were virulently attacked by Nicolae Iorga, who saw them as &quot;comprising all of the most repulsive in concept and all of the most trivial in shape&quot;; such accusations against Arghezi and the group of writers around him became commonplace in the Iron Guard&#x27;s press – writing in &quot;Sfarmă-Piatră&quot;, Vintilă Horia accused Arghezi of &quot;a willing adhesion to pornography&quot; and of &quot;betrayal&quot;. The latter statement centered on Arghezi&#x27;s earlier collaboration with &quot;Gândirea&quot; – the newspaper published by Nichifor Crainic, an intellectual figure on the far right who shared Arghezi&#x27;s initial religious traditionalism. &quot;Gândirea&quot; and its affiliated magazines alleged that the influence of Crainic&#x27;s thought (&quot;Gândirism&quot;) had played a major part in Arghezi&#x27;s early works, while attacking his Jewish editors with anti-Semitic slurs (and implying that his works would have decreased in quality because of their influence). To these, Arghezi replied with a dose of irony: &quot;[...] I have never ever read &quot;Gândirea&quot;, not even when I was contributing articles to it&quot;.

Shortly before his death, Arghezi reflected upon his status in the interwar period, rendering a dramatic picture:
&quot;[...] for a while, all the cultural institutions were associated against my writing: the University, the Academy, the poets, the press, the police, the courts, the censorship, the Gendarmerie and even the closest colleagues.&quot;

His political attitudes at the time were more complex, and he continued collaboration with left-wing magazines such as &quot;Dimineața&quot; and &quot;Adevărul&quot; while expressing staunchly monarchist views and support for King Carol II. According to some views, Arghezi developed a sympathy for the Iron Guard towards the end of the 1930 (his poem &quot;Făt-Frumos&quot; was contended to be a homage to the movement&#x27;s leader, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, assassinated in late 1938). This perspective, notably favored by essayist Alex Mihai Stoenescu, was disputed by the literary critic Ion Simuț, who argued that evidence to support it was sporadic and contradictory.

===World War II===
In 1939, Arghezi became suddenly and severely ill, being incapacitated by sciatica. The extreme pain and mysterious causes became topics of major interest, and it was rumored that his was an unprecedented disease. Upon examination (made difficult by Arghezi&#x27;s iatrophobia), some of Romania&#x27;s top physicians, including Nicolae Gh. Lupu, George Emil Palade, and Constantin Ion Parhon, decided that Arghezi&#x27;s sciatic nerve was being pressed on by an unknown body. Dumitru Bagdasar identified the cause as a cancerous tumor, and Arghezi underwent radiation therapy — the verdict and suffering caused the poet to maintain a growing animosity towards Bagdasar, which he later expressed in writing. After a period of deterioration, he regained his health unexpectedly.

During World War II the newspaper &quot;Informația Zilei&quot; took up the publishing of comments by Arghezi, as a column named after his former magazine, &quot;Bilete de Papagal&quot;. In 1943, it published virulent satires of the Romanian government, its military leader – Ion Antonescu, and Romania&#x27;s allegiance to Nazi Germany (&quot;see Romania during World War II&quot;). On 30 September 1943 Arghezi caused an outrage and a minor political scandal, after getting the paper to publish his most radical attack, one aimed at the German ambassador Manfred Freiherr von Killinger – &quot;Baroane&quot; (&quot;Baron!&quot; or &quot;Thou Baron&quot;). The piece centered on accusations of political and economic domination:
&quot;A flower blossomed in my garden, one like a plumped-up red bird, with a golden kernel. You blemished it. You set your paws on it and now it has dried up. My corn has shot into ears as big as Barbary Doves and you tore them away. You took the fruits out of my orchard by the cartload and gone you were with them. You placed your nib with its tens of thousands of nostrils on the cliffs of my water sources and you quaffed them from their depths and you drained them. Morass and slobber is what you leave behind in the mountains and yellow drought in the flatlands — and out of all the birds with singing tongues you leave me with bevies of rooks.&quot;

The authorities confiscated all issues, and the author was imprisoned without trial in a penitentiary camp near Târgu Jiu, in which communist political leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Nicolae Ceausescu, and Ion Gheorghe Maurer were also imprisoned. He was freed in 1944, only days after the August Coup, which resulted in the fall of the Antonescu regime.

===Arghezi and the Communist regime===
A controversial intellectual, Arghezi had a fluctuating relationship with the newly established Communist regime. Although he was awarded several literary prizes under during the period of Soviet-induced transition to a people&#x27;s republic, he became a harsh critic of censorship and agitprop-like state control in media, and was targeted as a decadent poet very soon after the communist-dominated republican institutions took power (1948). A series of articles written by Miron Radu Paraschivescu and Sorin Toma (son of the Stalinist literary figure Alexandru Toma) in the Romanian Communist Party&#x27;s official voice, &quot;Scînteia&quot;, described his works as having their origin in Arghezi&#x27;s &quot;violent insanity&quot;, called his style &quot;a pathological phenomenon&quot;, and depicted the author as &quot;the main poet of Romanian &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;&quot;; the articles were headlined &quot;Poezia Putrefacţiei sau Putrefacția Poeziei&quot; (&quot;The Poetry of Decay or the Decay of Poetry&quot;, in reference to Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;The Misery of Philosophy&quot; – the title of which in turn mocked Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of Misery&quot;).

The writer had to retreat from public life, spending most of these years at the house he owned in Văcărești, Bucharest, the one he called &quot;Mărțișor&quot; (the name it still goes by today); his main source of income was provided by selling the yields of cherries the surrounding plot returned.

However, as Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, who was also an inmate in penitentiary camp near Târgu Jiu, consolidated his power over the state and Party post-1952, Arghezi was discovered as an asset to the new, more &quot;national&quot; tone of the regime — as several other censored cultural figures, he was paid a visit by Miron Constantinescu, the Communist activist overseeing the rehabilitation process.

Once exonerated, he started being awarded numerous titles and prizes. Arghezi was elected a member of the Romanian Academy in 1955, and celebrated as national poet on his 80th and 85th birthdays. Although never turned-Socialist Realist, he adapted his themes to the requirements – such as he did in &quot;Cântare Omului&quot; (&quot;Ode to Mankind&quot;) and &quot;1907&quot;. In 1965, Arghezi also won recognition abroad, being the recipient of the Herder Prize.

Arghezi&#x27;s mysterious illness resurfaced with the same symptoms in 1955, and he was rapidly interned in the care of Ion Făgărășanu. He was diagnosed with a chronic infection that had originated in surgery he had undergone in 1934, provoking an abscess in the area around his lumbar vertebrae; he was released soon completing a treatment which included streptomycin injections.

He died and was buried in the garden of his house next to his wife Paraschiva in 1967 (she had died the previous year), with tremendous pomp and funeral festivities orchestrated by Communist Party officials. His home is now a museum. It was managed by his daughter, Mitzura until her death in 2015. Arghezi and Paraschiva also had a son, known as Baruțu, but actually called Iosif.

==Arghezi&#x27;s work==
Arghezi is perhaps the most striking figure of Romanian interwar literature, and one of the major poets of the 20th century. The freshness of his vocabulary represents a most original synthesis between the traditional styles and modernism. He has left behind a vast &quot;oeuvre&quot;, which includes poetry, novels, essays, journalism, translations and letters.

The impact of his writings on Romanian poetic language was revolutionary, through his creation of unusual lyrical structures, new subgenres in prose – such as the poetic novel, the &quot;tablet&quot; (&quot;tableta&quot;) and the &quot;ticket&quot; (&quot;biletul&quot;). He excelled at powerful and concise formulations, the shock value of which he exploited to startle lazy or conformist thinking, and his writings abound in paradoxes, as well as metaphysical or religious arguments. Evidencing the satirical genre&#x27;s leading role throughout Arghezi&#x27;s literary career, George Călinescu argued that it had become a contributing factor to much of his poetry and prose fiction.

Arghezi re-established an aesthetic of the grotesque, and experimented at length with prosody. In much of his poetry (notably in his &quot;Flori de mucigai&quot; and &quot;Hore&quot;), Arghezi also built upon a tradition of slang and argot usage, creating an atmosphere which, according to Călinescu, recalled the universe of Anton Pann, as well as those of Salvatore Di Giacomo and Cesare Pascarella. He introduced a vocabulary of intentional ugliness and decay, with the manifest goal of extending the limits of poetic language, the major theme in his &quot;Cuvinte Potrivite&quot;; nevertheless, the other half of Arghezi&#x27;s poetic universe was that of family life, childhood, and small familiar spaces, rendered in minutely detailed poems. In an era when the idea of the impossibility of communication was fashionable, he stood against his contemporaries through his strong belief in the power of the written word to communicate ideas and feelings — he was described by Tudor Vianu as &quot;a fighting poet, subject to attacks as well as returning them&quot;.

Despite his association with the Communist regime, Arghezi is widely acknowledged as a major literary figure. His work has traditionally been a staple of Romanian literature textbooks for decades.

==In cultural reference==
Aside from various sketches Arghezi had drawn of himself, his portrait was drawn by various artists he met or befriended. Around 1910, he was included in group portraits by Ary Murnu and Camil Ressu, both of which depicted the literary society formed around the Kübler Café in Bucharest. An abstract depiction of Arghezi, showing him as a figure with a hunter case-shaped head, and sitting on an electric chair, was published by M. H. Maxy. Shortly before they died, Arghezi and his wife were the subject of an oil painting by Corneliu Baba.

Tudor Arghezi was several times portrayed in Romanian film: in 1958, Grigore Vasiliu Birlic played a major part in Arghezi&#x27;s &quot;Doi Vecini&quot; (a character loosely based on the author); an eponymous film based on the life of Ștefan Luchian was released in 1981, starring Florin Călinescu as Arghezi.

<doc id="588036" wikidata="Q4356710" url="?curid=588036" title="North York City Centre">
<text>North York City Centre is a central business district in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the administrative district of North York. It is located along Yonge Street, between just south of Sheppard Avenue northward to Finch Avenue with its focus around Mel Lastman Square, a civic square, and spreads eastwards and westwards a few blocks, generally as far as Doris Avenue and Beecroft Road. The district is a high-density district of condominium and office towers with ground-floor commercial uses along the wide six lanes of Yonge Street.

The district was developed following the extension of the Yonge subway north to Finch Station. In the 1970s and 80s, the former City of North York encouraged the development of the area as a downtown, locating its civic offices, a public square, a central library, an arts centre and an aquatic centre on the west side of Yonge, about 600 metres north of Sheppard. The area&#x27;s growth increased following the opening of North York Centre station at Mel Lastman Square and the Sheppard subway line. A shopping mall and cinemas were developed on the east side of Yonge Street across from Mel Lastman Square in the 1990s.

It is mostly located in the larger official neighbourhood of Willowdale, part of the former city of North York, and a former municipality (postal district) of its own, but also abuts the Lansing neighbourhood on the east side of Yonge Street near Sheppard Avenue. Following the amalgamation of North York with the rest of Toronto, North York City Centre became the largest of four central business districts in the new city outside Downtown Toronto. All of the civic facilities were retained by the new City of Toronto.

==History==
In the 1800s, the forests in the area were cleared for farmland, around settlements made by Jacob Cummer and David Gibson alongside Yonge Street, which was the main road for travel from Toronto northward, and which served as Provincial Highway 11 from 1920 until 1998. The postal village of Willowdale was established within York County. North York Township was formed in 1923 from York Township. To the east and west, low-density single-family housing subdivisions were built beginning in the 1920s. As the area&#x27;s population grew, the roadside became lined with commercial establishments, some being one-level highway arterial-type uses such as gas stations, with others being tightly knit two-storey buildings.

The post-World War II period saw the rapid growth of the suburbs of Toronto. To accommodate the growth, the township was changed into the Borough of North York after Metropolitan Toronto was split off from York County in 1953. The large expansion of Ontario Highway 401, known as the Toronto Bypass, just to the south connected the district to the rest of the Toronto area by freeway. The area was filled in by the 1960s with residential single-family subdivisions. By the 1960s, some high rise development was occurring, such as a Canadian Government Building at Yonge and Elmhurst Street and the twin-tower Sheppard Centre commercial and office complex at Yonge and Sheppard. The 1970s saw the extension of the Yonge–University line to Finch, connecting the area to downtown Toronto.

Following the opening of the subway extension, the area along Yonge Street, between Sheppard and Finch Avenues, was chosen by North York and Metropolitan Toronto to be developed into a central business district as the borough (which developed from a rural township and thus had no true historic downtown save for the original small Willowdale village where the city centre developed) was promoted to the status of city. An official plan by Metropolitan Toronto encouraged high-density commercial and residential developments in the area. The former City of North York chose to encourage the development of the area as a downtown by building a civic centre complex consisting of its civic offices, a public square, a central library, an arts centre, and an aquatic centre on the west side of Yonge, about 600 metres north of Sheppard at southwest corner of Park Home Avenue and Yonge.

Following the completion of the Scarborough RT, the City of North York convinced the Toronto Transit Commission to construct North York Centre station, an infill station on the Yonge–University line, to connect the new North York Civic Centre complex directly to the subway, which opened in 1987. On the east side of Yonge Street across from the Civic Centre, the Empress Walk mixed-use development, consisting of a shopping mall, cinema, and two condominium towers, was completed in 1997–2000. The streets sidewalks were widened and landscaped. The area&#x27;s growth has continued steadily since then. The new Sheppard subway line opened in 2002, running along Sheppard Avenue from Don Mills Road in the east, to the expanded Sheppard-Yonge Station which crossroads with the Yonge-University line. The Sheppard Centre, originally built in the 1970s, had a cinema added in the late 1990s, then it was extensively renovated from 2016 to 2021.

Canada&#x27;s deadliest vehicle-ramming attack occurred on April 23, 2018, when a rented van collided with numerous pedestrians, killing 10 and injuring 16 others on Yonge Street between Finch and Sheppard Avenues. One became quadriplegic and permanently required a ventilator at an assisted-living facility where she died in November 2021.

==Landmarks==
The North York Civic Centre office complex and Mel Lastman Square, on the west side of Yonge Street, are central to the area. Across Yonge Street to the east is Empress Walk, a shopping mall that connects directly to the local subway station. North York Central Library, the Toronto Centre for the Arts, and the Toronto District School Board headquarters are all located adjacent to the square. The Joseph Shepard Building, a federal government office, is located on the west side of Yonge Street one block north of Sheppard Avenue. Further north and south along Yonge Street, office towers, condominium apartment towers and street-level shops line the street.

Gibson House, a museum converted from a mid-19th-century house built by the Canadian politician David Gibson, a Scottish immigrant, land surveyor and participant of the Rebellion of 1837, is also located in this neighbourhood. Earl Haig Secondary School is located on Princess Avenue nearby.

The district is directly served by the North York Centre subway station, while and subway stations are located at the southern and northern edges of the area, respectively. Finch station is a hub for GO Transit services for commuters from north of Toronto. The area is known for the high-level of traffic on the six lanes of Yonge Street, which connects to the Ontario Highway 401 south of Sheppard.

<text>West End is an unincorporated community in Moore County, North Carolina, United States. The community is located at the multiplex of two primary state highways, North Carolina Highway 211 (NC 211) and North Carolina Highway 73 (NC 73). It is named for when it was the western terminus of a railroad from Aberdeen, from about 1890–1898.

==History==
In the late 1880s, turpentine distillery operator Daniel McDonald of Moore County petitioned local railroad owner Allison Page to extend rail lines to his property to allow him to ship his products. Page agreed and extended the Aberdeen &amp; Star Railroad northwest from Aberdeen to McDonald&#x27;s land. The western terminal of this line was dubbed West End, and a community arose around it with the same name. All buildings in the community but the train station and a drug store were destroyed by fire in 1898.

In the aftermath of the fire, the community was rebuilt on an agricultural economy, with particular emphasis on the cultivation of peaches. In 1927, peach grower J.B. Von Cannon established a factory which eventually became the Sandhills Furniture Corporation. The facility was purchased by Stanley Furniture in 1965. In early 2002, Stanley Furniture closed its West End plant, eliminating a work force of 400 jobs. In 2019, the facility was razed to make way for the widening of NC 211 into a four-lane divided boulevard.

<doc id="588056" wikidata="Q5236501" url="?curid=588056" title="USS Tripoli (LPH-10)">
<text>USS &quot;Tripoli&quot; (LPH-10), an , was laid down on 15 June 1964 at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 31 July 1965; sponsored by Jane Cates, the wife of General Clifton B. Cates, former Commandant of the Marine Corps; and commissioned on 6 August 1966 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. &quot;Tripoli&quot; was the second US Navy ship named for the Battle of Derna in 1805. It was the decisive victory of a mercenary army led by a detachment of US Marines and US Army soldiers against the forces of Tripoli during the First Barbary War and was the first recorded land battle of the United States fought overseas.

Following three months fitting out at Philadelphia, the ship put to sea on 6 November 1966, bound for the west coast. She transited the Panama Canal at mid-month and arrived at her home port, San Diego, on 22 November 1966. Final acceptance trials, shakedown training, and post-shakedown availability at Long Beach occupied the warship until she embarked Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron HMH-463, elements of Marine Observation Squadron VMO-6, and some members of the staff of the Commander, Amphibious Squadron 8 on 1 May 1967 and departed San Diego, bound for the western Pacific.

==Vietnam Service, 1967–1973==
&quot;Tripoli&quot; served on three deployments to Vietnamese waters during the Vietnam War, participating in numerous operations.

===First tour===
Except for a round-trip voyage to Okinawa early in September, the ship operated out of US Naval Base Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines for the remainder of her deployment. Main propulsion plant problems, however, continued to plague her. On the return trip, the ship went dead in the water not far to the northwest of Subic Bay. went out and towed her into port. After repairs, &quot;Tripoli&quot;, occupied her remaining time in the Far East with amphibious exercises in the Philippines. On 11 December 1967, relieved her as flagship of TG 76.4, and &quot;Tripoli&quot; headed for home. &quot;Tripoli&quot; arrived in San Diego on 23 December 1967 and remained there through the end of the year.

On 22 May 1967, &quot;Tripoli&quot; arrived in the combat zone off the coast of South Vietnam and disembarked HMH-463 and VMO-6 at Danang on the 23rd and 24th before joining TG 76.5, just then finishing up amphibious landing Operation Belt Tight in the I Corps zone just south of the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Vietnam. She headed for the Philippines on 25 May, arrived in Subic Bay on the 27th, and relieved as flagship of Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) Bravo VTG 76.5. In that capacity, she embarked not only the task group commander&#x27;s staff but also the staff of the Commander, Special Landing Force (SLF) Bravo CTG 79.5, the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, the men and aircraft of Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron HMM-164, Surgical Evacuation Team Bravo, and Detachment Bravo of Tactical Squadron (TacRon) 11. On 8 June, she departed Subic Bay for an extended tour of duty in Vietnamese waters.

During its 1967 deployment, &quot;Tripoli&quot; participated in eight amphibious operations, all conducted along the coast of the I Corps. Her first operation, codenamed Beacon Torch, began on 18 June when US Marines of SLF Bravo were flown into the vicinity of Hoi An, located on the coast midway between the DMZ and the southern limit of I Corps tactical zone. Between 18 June and 2 July, the Marines operated ashore, initially engaging an enemy force of about 100 men. After an air strike broke the enemy resistance, the Marines concluded their mission with a search and destroy sweep to wipe out the remnants of that force. All the while, &quot;Tripoli&quot; remained offshore providing logistic support, medical evacuation services for casualties and a platform from which to launch air support missions by the embarked Marine attack squadron. On 2 July, she received the special landing force back on board and immediately headed north to the coast of Quảng Trị Province to answer a call for assistance from Marine Corps units near Con Thien, which had suffered heavily from bombardments by the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN). The ensuing Operation Beaver Track pitted SLF Bravo against the PAVN troops to relieve the pressure on Marine Corps units based ashore with the III Marine Amphibious Force (MAF). Simultaneously with Operation Beaver Track, SLF &quot;Alfa&quot;, embarked on USS &quot;Okinawa&quot;, went ashore to engage the same enemy force in Operation Bear Claw. The two battalion landing teams joined III MAF Marines based ashore in a week-long struggle, followed by an eight-battalion search and destroy sweep. Throughout the 12 days of &quot;Beaver Track/Bear Claw,&quot; &quot;Tripoli&quot; steamed offshore within easy helicopter range to provide logistical, medical, and ground support. The two landing forces were later credited with a third of the 1,100 PAVN casualties and with no small part in breaking up the PAVN attack.

&quot;Beaver Track/Bear Claw&quot; ended on 14 July, and both battalion landing teams returned to their ships on the 7th. The respite from combat, however, proved brief. At dawn three days later, &quot;Tripoli&quot;″s Marines stormed ashore in a combined waterborne-airborne amphibious assault on the exposed seaward flank of the Viet Cong (VC) 806th Battalion near Quảng Trị City. The VC avoided contact with the Marines by retiring hastily to the west, where they were badly mauled by South Vietnamese troops. BLT 2/3 re-embarked in &quot;Tripoli&quot; on the 27th for another brief rest before the equally brief amphibious Operation Kangaroo Kick, which commenced on 1 August. &quot;Tripoli&quot;&#x27;s Marines landed in Quảng Trị Province, north of Hue. Though the operation ended only three days later, the Marines did not re-embark for the voyage to Subic Bay. Instead, they changed operational control to III MAF, while &quot;Tripoli&quot; and the rest of TG 76.5 spent two weeks at the Philippine naval base for upkeep.

&quot;Tripoli&quot; returned to the Vietnamese coast near Huế on the 20th and backloaded SLF Bravo in time for the Marines to participate in Operation Belt Drive. On 27 August, the battalion landing team once more went ashore, via both helicopter and landing craft, in Quang Tri Province. PAVN/VC resistance proved slight; and, after a three-day sweep of the Hai Lang forest, the Marines reembarked in &quot;Tripoli&quot; on 5 September. That same day, suffered a hit from enemy guns on Cape Lay, North Vietnam. &quot;Tripoli&quot;, located not far away, went to her assistance and evacuated 12 casualties by helicopter for treatment on board the ship. On the 17th, because her entire complement of CH-46A Sea Knight helicopters had been grounded, &quot;Tripoli&quot; launched the first all-boat landing from an LPH. In spite of swells high, a rain squall, 30- to winds, and visibility frequently less than , the boat landings for Operation Fortress Sentry came off almost without a hitch. Ashore near the Cua Viet River some south of the DMZ, the Marines moved inland, but encountered no enemy resistance until the 23d. Then, artillery and air support quickly extinguished the PAVN&#x27;s will to fight, and the operation was terminated on the 25th. The Marines reembarked between 25 September and 27 September, and the task group headed back to Subic Bay for six days in port.
&quot;Tripoli&quot; returned to Vietnam at Danang early in October and loaded 39 defective CH-46A helicopters for transportation to Okinawa, where their tail pylons were to be replaced. Shortly after she departed Danang on 7 October, her lookout spied an Air Force F-105 Thunderchief, which crashed into the sea about ahead. One of her helicopters flew to the scene, rescued the pilot, and returned him to the ship for medical treatment. Not long thereafter, her lookouts caught sight of a second survivor of the crash. By the time her helicopter arrived on the scene, an Air Force chopper had already picked up the man. &quot;Tripoli&quot;&#x27;s helicopter assisted in the operation by taking on board the Air Force crewman who had jumped in to assist the survivor into the lift harness.

&quot;Tripoli&quot; returned from the Ryukyus Islands (Japan) to Vietnamese waters at mid-month. On the 17th, CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters carried the battalion landing team to a point south of Phu Bai Combat Base in Thừa Thiên Province. The following day, the Marines changed operational control to III MAF ashore for a search and destroy sweep along Route 1. Meanwhile, &quot;Tripoli&quot; supplied logistic support until she cleared Vietnamese waters on 1 November, bound for Okinawa with another 18 defective CH-46A helicopters. After brief stops at Okinawa and Subic Bay, the ship returned to Danang on 10 November. After re-embarking SLF &quot;Bravo,&quot; she prepared for her last amphibious operation of the deployment, Operation Badger Hunt. On the 14th, the landing force was lifted some inland to the area near An Hoa Combat Base in Quảng Nam Province. After silencing sporadic enemy resistance near the landing site, &quot;Tripoli&quot;&#x27;s Marines joined elements of the shore-based 7th Marines in a successful search-and-destroy operation. &quot;Tripoli&quot; supported the landing force through the end of the operation on the 27th, when the Marines returned to the ship. She entered Danang on the 29th and began transferring the Marines of the battalion landing team and their supporting elements to . The next day, 30 November, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; relieved &quot;Tripoli&quot; as flagship, TG 76.5; and &quot;Tripoli&quot; got underway to return to the United States via Okinawa and Yokosuka, Japan. She arrived in San Diego on 23 December 1967, and began post-deployment standdown.

&quot;Tripoli&quot; completed a restricted availability at Long Beach between late January and the end of March 1968. During the first three weeks of April, she conducted a series of individual ship exercises and then rounded out the month with amphibious training. From 6 to 17 May, the ship conducted refresher training and then returned to San Diego to prepare for her second WestPac deployment. On 12 June 1968, the ship stood out of San Diego on her way to the Far East. She stopped briefly at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and at Okinawa before arriving at Subic Bay on 1 July. Between the 2nd and the 5th, she embarked the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, HMM-265, Detachment Bravo of TacRon 13 and other supporting units of the ARG &quot;Bravo.&quot; On the 6th, she departed Subic Bay and arrived the following day in the Vietnam combat zone.

===Second tour===
&quot;Tripoli&quot;&#x27;s second tour of duty closely followed the pattern of the first. During the next seven months, she patrolled the coast of South Vietnam near the I Corps tactical in a position to launch her landing contingent quickly whenever they were needed by Marine Corps, Army and South Vietnamese forces operating ashore. The first of her eight amphibious operations came the day after she arrived in the combat zone. Following preliminary naval bombardment, Operation Eager Yankee opened with a combined airborne and waterborne assault. The Marines of SLF Bravo went ashore about east of Phu Bai Combat Base. They then wheeled right and pressed north toward a known VC haven. The VC avoided contact; and, on the 16th, the Marines joined shore-based forces in Operation Houston IV. That operation ended on 22 July, and the battalion landing team returned to the ship the same day.

While &quot;Tripoli&quot; proceeded to the scene of a new operation, feverish preparations allowed her to send SLF Bravo ashore again just 17 hours after the completion of reembarkation. For Operation Swift Play, the Marines rode helicopters ashore to an area about southwest of An Hoa, deep inland in Quảng Nam Province. The assault forces spotted several enemy formations, but no engagements resulted. The following day, BLT 2/7 transferred to the control of III MAF to conclude an operation designed to parry a major enemy thrust toward Danang. The landing force remained ashore operating under the commanding general, 1st Marine Division, in defense of Danang through the months of August, September and November. Meanwhile, &quot;Tripoli&quot; steamed on station offshore providing logistics and medical support, departing Vietnamese waters twice between 22 July and 5 November. In mid-August, she steamed to Subic Bay for repairs; and, in early October, she voyaged via Subic Bay to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, for a liberty call. During all other periods, she remained off the Vietnamese coast providing support services to the Marines of BLT 2/7 operating ashore.

On 5 November, the special landing force ended more than three months of combat duty ashore and re-embarked on &quot;Tripoli&quot;. Five days later, HMM-165&#x27;s helicopters and &quot;Tripoli&quot;&#x27;s landing craft carried the Marines ashore once again. In Operation Daring Endeavor, the Marines located, closed with and destroyed enemy fortifications and captured large quantities of rice. They concluded the action on the 17th and returned to the ship that same day. Three days later, &quot;Tripoli&quot; launched her fourth landing, another combined waterborne and airborne operation directed at an area in Quảng Nam Province, just south of Danang. During Operation Swift Move, initial opposition proved very light; and the landing force quickly transferred to the control of the 1st Marine Division for further action ashore in the continued defense of Danang against PAVN and Vietcong forces. &quot;Tripoli&quot; continued support activities for the battalion landing team until 3 December when she offloaded what remained aboard of the Marines&#x27; equipment at Danang, in preparation for departing Vietnam for a liberty call in Hong Kong. After a five-day visit, she continued on to Subic Bay for a two-week availability. On 27 December 1968, she headed back to Danang. On 1 January 1969, she embarked BLT 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines and HMM-164 to reconstitute SLF &quot;Bravo.&quot;

During the remainder of her second tour of duty, &quot;Tripoli&quot; participated in two more amphibious operations. The first of these, Operation Bold Mariner, was hailed as the largest such maneuver since the Allied landings during World War II. Aimed at the Batangan Peninsula of Quảng Ngãi Province, where the entire population was considered hostile, the operation sought to cordon off the peninsula and trap the 300 or so Vietcong operating there. Both special landing forces &quot;Alfa&quot; and &quot;Bravo,&quot; joined South Vietnamese troops and soldiers of the US Army&#x27;s Americal Division in forming the cordon. Following a feint near Mo Duc, the amphibious force headed for the real landing area. Navy guns softened the objective beaches, and the Marines went ashore on 13 January, many by helicopter. Marines from Company H, 2nd Battalion, 26th Marines went ashore in landing craft, M-Boats carried platoons and reinforced companies which landing on the beach forming the east side of the cordon. While the operation continued, &quot;Tripoli&quot; remained offshore providing her Marines with the ever-needed logistical support and medical facilities. By 6 February, the soldiers and Marines ashore had thoroughly combed the peninsula for VC troops, so BLT 3/26 turned the mop-up operation over to the American and South Vietnamese soldiers and returned to the ship.

The re-embarkation of the Marines was completed by 9 February, just in time for &quot;Tripoli&quot; to launch her last amphibious operation of the deployment. The expected enemy Tet 1969 offensive required South Vietnamese troops to be withdrawn from Operation Taylor Common, then in progress near An Hoa in Quang Nam Province. SLF Bravo was to replace those troops in Operation Defiant Measure. The landings began at 08:00 on the morning of 10 February, and the offloading of men and equipment continued for several days. &quot;Tripoli&quot; remained in the area until the 16th. Operation Defiant Measure was concluded on that day, though the Marines remained ashore to continue Operation Taylor Common. HMM-164 was disembarked before &quot;Tripoli&quot; began her voyage home. She departed Vietnam that same day, and arrived in Subic Bay on the 18th. There, she turned over her duties to USS &quot;Valley Forge&quot;. On the 22nd, she got underway for badly needed repairs in Yokosuka, Japan, and before continuing on to the United States. She finally arrived back in San Diego on 19 March and began post-deployment standdown.

&quot;Tripoli&quot; remained on the west coast until November. After leave and upkeep, she began an availability period at the San Diego yard of the National Steel Company, which continued until 11 August. Following refresher training in September and amphibious training in October, she stood out of San Diego on 1 November to return to the Far East. After a brief stop at Guam on the 15th for fuel, she continued on to Danang, South Vietnam, arriving five days later.

===Third tour===
During &quot;Tripoli&quot;&#x27;s third deployment to the western Pacific, the combat operations along the Vietnamese coast, which had characterized her first two deployments were totally absent. Instead, she conducted a series of amphibious training exercises and a series of &quot;Keystone&quot; operations redeploying Marine Corps units. Her first mission, Operation Keystone Cardinal, began on 20 November 1969 when she loaded the Marines and equipment of BLT 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines for transportation to Okinawa. At Okinawa between 24 November and 2 December, she disembarked BLT 3/4 and embarked BLT 2/9, HMM-165, and supporting units to constitute SLP &quot;Alfa.&quot; On 2 December, she departed Okinawa bound for the Philippines. She conducted upkeep at Subic Bay between 5 December and 12 December and two amphibious exercises at Zambales on the 13th and 14th.

&quot;Tripoli&quot; returned to Vietnamese waters on the 17th and cruised the area without incident until the 25th, when she headed back to Subic Bay. In the Philippines, minor repairs and more amphibious exercises occupied her until 6 January 1970. She made a six-day cruise to Vietnam and then returned to the Philippines on the 12th for more training. On the 25th, she disembarked SLF &quot;Alfa&quot; at Subic Bay in preparation for a voyage to Vietnam to pick up homeward-bound marines. She entered Danang on 31 January and began embarking personnel from HQ, III MAF, 1st Marine Air Wing, 1st Marine Division, and III MAF Logistics Command. Later that evening, she got underway for home. After a non-stop voyage of 17 days, the ship arrived in San Diego on 16 February. She moved to Long Beach on the 23d to replace a cracked screw and departed that port on the 27th to return to the western Pacific reaching Subic Bay on 15 March.

&quot;Tripoli&quot; operated in the Philippines and at Okinawa conducting amphibious exercises in preparation for an exercise with units of South Korean forces. She arrived in Korean waters on 18 April and, two days later, began Operation Golden Dragon. The combined American-South Korean amphibious exercise lasted until the 25th. &quot;Tripoli&quot; returned to Okinawa on the 27th. She briefly operated off Danang at the end of the first week in May and then visited Hong Kong for a week in mid-month. Late in May, she returned via Subic Bay to Okinawa to disembark SLF &quot;Alfa&quot; and then moved to Danang, where she disembarked ComPhibRon 9 and his staff and took on cargo for the voyage home. &quot;Tripoli&quot; got underway on 7 June 1970 and reached San Diego on the 24th.
&quot;Tripoli&quot; spent the next 15 months on the west coast. Following post-deployment&#x27; upkeep and local operations, she conducted carrier qualifications in the southern California operation area in August and an amphibious exercise off Camp Pendleton. For the remainder of 1970, the ship occupied herself with individual ship&#x27;s exercises and upkeep in preparation for an overhaul, which began on 1 February 1971. She left Hunters Point on 1 June, fully revitalized, and returned to San Diego on the 3rd to prepare for refresher training, which took place in late June and early July. Amphibious refresher training filled the latter half of July. She made two brief training cruises during the first week in August: one with NROTC midshipmen embarked and the other with Marine Corps reservists on board. Local operations and preparations for her fourth WestPac deployment occupied the rest of August and the entire month of September. On 1 October, &quot;Tripoli&quot; stood out of San Diego bound for the Far East. After stops at Pearl Harbor and Okinawa, she arrived in Subic Bay on the 28th.

The ship conducted amphibious training operations in the Philippines and made port visits to such places as Keelung and Kaohsiung in Taiwan and Sasebo, Japan. During her return from Sasebo to Subic Bay, she received orders to deploy to the Indian Ocean with TF-74, a special contingency task force built around in response to the Indo-Pakistani War, which erupted on 3 December. The ship remained in the Indian Ocean for the duration of the brief war. The fighting ended on 15 December; and, two days later, Pakistan officially accepted the loss of its eastern provinces, which became the independent nation, Bangladesh. &quot;Tripoli&quot; remained with TF 74 in the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal until early 1972.

She returned to Subic Bay on 14 January and resumed training operations punctuated by visits to Singapore, Hong Kong and Kobe, Japan. She began operations in Vietnamese waters at the beginning of April, operating on Yankee Station to provide search-and-rescue and medical evacuation services. She departed the combat zone twice, once for upkeep at Subic Bay and later to exchange battalion landing teams at Okinawa. At the end of June, she resumed flight operations in connection with troop movements. However, instead of carrying embarked Marines inland for amphibious landings, her helicopters moved South Vietnamese troops from point to point ashore. On 29 June, &quot;Tripoli&quot;-assigned helicopters helped to transport 1,400 Vietnamese Marines from Tam My to the vicinity of Quang Tri City during the allied counteroffensive to recapture areas of the I Corps tactical zone, which had been overrun by PAVN during the Easter Offensive. As this operation, codenamed &quot;Lam Son 72&quot; progressed, &quot;Tripoli&quot; remained off shore, evacuating casualties and waiting should the reserves be required. That necessity came shortly before noon on 11 July, when her helicopters helped to insert the reserve Vietnamese Marines battalion, picking them up near Route 553 and landing them behind enemy lines, about north-northwest of Quang Tri City. On the 20th, &quot;Tripoli&quot; departed Vietnamese waters bound for the Philippines where heavy monsoons had caused extensive flooding. She reached Subic Bay on 23 July and conducted relief operations until 4 August, at which time she set course for the United States.

&quot;Tripoli&quot; arrived at San Diego on 20 August and, remained there until 10 October. After a six-day amphibious exercise near Hunter Liggett Point, &quot;Tripoli&quot; returned to home port, where she stayed through the end of the year. During the first two months of 1973, she operated out of San Diego and prepared to deploy to the Far East once more. &quot;Tripoli&quot; stood out of San Diego on 6 March for her fifth deployment to the western Pacific. Steaming via Pearl Harbor, where she made a three-week stop for repairs to her high-pressure turbine, she arrived in Subic Bay on 17 April. The ship remained there and, when not plagued by material casualties to her main propulsion plant, conducted training preparatory to Operation End Sweep, the removal of American mines from North Vietnamese waters. Though scheduled to sail for Haiphong on 16 June, she was delayed by more problems in her propulsion plant. Nevertheless, early the next morning, &quot;Tripoli&quot; headed for North Vietnam and arrived at Haiphong on the 19th. The clearing of US mines in North Vietnamese waters, particularly Haiphong, was the last remaining precondition to the release of the US prisoners of war. That morning, the commander of TF 78, Rear Admiral Brian McCauley, embarked on the &quot;Tripoli&quot; and began negotiations with North Vietnamese representatives over the conduct of Operation End Sweep. McCauley spent his childhood in China and spoke fluent Chinese as the son of Commodore Cleaveland McCauley, who was military attache to China in the 1920s, and the negotiations were conducted in Chinese. Meanwhile, &quot;Tripoli&quot;&#x27;s embarked air group began providing logistics support and inter-ship transportation services.

Major issues in the negotiations were resolved by 28 June, and minesweeping operations began early that morning. Throughout the operation, the ship provided a platform for helicopters engaged both in minesweeping operations and for those providing logistics and transport services. Periodically, she retired from the area to replenish and to evade typhoons. Otherwise, she remained in the minesweeping area until 18 July when it departed North Vietnamese waters in company with and , bound for Luzon. Four days after her arrival back in Subic Bay, the last American operation in Vietnamese territory ended, and the End Sweep task force was dissolved. Operations reverted to CTG 76.5/ARG &quot;Bravo.&quot; That organization lasted only two days because on the 27th, the Commander, PhibRon 1, broke his flag on &quot;Tripoli&quot;, and she became flagship for TG 76.4/ ARC &quot;Alfa.&quot;

==Operational readiness, 1974–1979==
Between January 1974 and the end of 1976, &quot;Tripoli&quot; made two relatively routine deployments to the western Pacific. The first lasted from late July 1974 until late January 1975. During that time period, she operated out of Subic Bay and engaged primarily in amphibious training exercises in the Philippines. The second deployment, from mid-February to late October 1976, saw a repetition of this routine, but also included a voyage to Guam for disaster relief duty as a result of Super Typhoon Pamela. She also participated in two joint American-Korean amphibious exercises conducted near Pohang, Korea, in March and June, respectively. The second deployment ended on 25 October, when she arrived in San Diego, remaining there into 1977.

The first six months of 1977 were spent in a Planned Restricted Availability (PRAV) at Naval Station San Diego, for the purpose of increasing propulsion reliability during the next deployment. While the PRAV concluded on 28 June, it was necessary to tow &quot;Tripoli&quot; to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard to use the yard&#x27;s extensive facilities for the reinstallation of &quot;Tripoli&quot;&#x27;s low pressure turbine. The work was completed on 26 July; and, following successful sea trials, &quot;Tripoli&quot; returned to San Diego on 28 July. Succeeding months were spent in refresher training and workup for the ship&#x27;s forthcoming deployment to the western Pacific. On 3 November, &quot;Tripoli&quot; departed San Diego. Chopping to control by the Commander, 7th Fleet, on 25 November, the ship spent the next seven months in WestPac, returning to San Diego on 22 July 1978. Following post-deployment standdown, &quot;Tripoli&quot; received an inspection by the Naval Board of Inspection and Survey in September. On 16 October, the ship commenced a three-month PRAV in preparation for a scheduled deployment to the western Pacific in 1979.

With the Vietnam War over, &quot;Tripoli&quot; was kept operationally ready through countless drills, exercises and maritime deployments. The Pacific Fleet introduction of the AV-8A Harrier occurred between 17 June and 13 August 1974. Also in 1974, after proving that she could handle Harrier flight operations, &quot;Tripoli&quot; became the first amphibious warfare ship to carry a full squadron of AV-8s.

==1980s==

&quot;Tripoli&quot; sailed on 12 November 1981 from San Diego for a western Pacific and Indian Ocean deployment as flagship of Amphibious Ready Group Alpha/Amphibious Squadron One (, , ) during which USS &quot;Tripoli&quot; and Amphibious Squadron One visited Perth and Fremantle, in Western Australia for R&amp;R from 28 January to 3 February 1982. &quot;Tripoli&quot; returned home to San Diego, on 15 May 1982.

In 1982, the ship was the test platform for the XV-15 experimental tilt-rotor aircraft, the precursor of the V-22 Osprey.

==Stationed in the Arabian Sea, 1990–1995==

In 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein became the focal point of international interest when, on 2 August his troops invaded Kuwait. Over 100 US Naval ships were sent in response, and on 1 December 1990, &quot;Tripoli&quot; was sent into action once again. &quot;Tripoli&quot; proceeded into the northern Persian Gulf and assumed duties as flagship for airborne mine countermeasures operations there with HM-14 and Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 773 (HMLA-773) deployed aboard. On the morning of 18 February 1991, at 04:36 &quot;Tripoli&quot; was rocked by a LUGM-145 mine explosion on her starboard bow. The explosion ripped a 16 by 20 ft hole in the ship&#x27;s hull. After 20 hours of damage control, the ship was stabilized and was actually ready to resume operations. However, her JP5 fuel tanks were damaged by the mine hit and she was unable to deploy her MH-53E Seadragons due to a lack of fuel. &quot;Tripoli&quot; remained on station for seven days before finally setting course for Jubail to allow HM-14 to crossdeck to the and then to Bahrain&#x27;s Arab Shipbuilding and Repair Yard Company. After 30 days of quick repairs, &quot;Tripoli&quot; returned to the Persian Gulf where she spearheaded the U.N. mine sweeping operation to clear the naval mine fields laid down by Iraq.

 and sister MSO&#x27;s were her escorts. &quot;Impervious&quot; was responsible for removing these mines that threatened the Tripoli. Soon after the Iraqi invasion, it became clear that Iraq was laying mines in international waters. US ships discovered and destroyed six mines during December. The US Mine Countermeasures Group (USMCMG) was established with the objective of clearing a path to the beach for a possible amphibious landing and battleship gunfire support.

The minesweepers , &quot;Impervious&quot; and , along with the newly commissioned mine countermeasures ship , arrived in the Persian Gulf aboard the heavy-lift ship &quot;Super Servant III&quot;. More than 20 Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams were also deployed to support the mine countermeasures force. Allied minesweepers from Saudi Arabia, Great Britain and Kuwait, and the MH-53E Sea Dragons of Mine Countermeasures Helicopter Squadron 14 joined the mine countermeasure effort.

After months of training off Dubai, United Arab Emirates, USMCMG staff embarked on &quot;Tripoli&quot; on 20 January, and proceeded to the northern part of the Persian Gulf waters to perform their mission. As flagship for the combined operation, &quot;Tripoli&quot;&#x27;s flight deck was the base for the mine-sweeping helicopters. Six British minesweepers joined their US counterparts, with UK and US warships providing air defense.

USMCMG began its work east of the Kuwaiti coastline, working initially to clear a long, wide path. The mine-clearing task force spent the first few weeks of Desert Storm pushing to Point Foxtrot, a by box, which became the battleship gunfire support area south of Faylaka Island. While sweeping further toward shore, the task group was targeted by Iraqi fire control radars associated with Silkworm missile sites inside Kuwait. Task force ships moved out of Silkworm range and worked to locate the radar site. During those maneuvers on 18 February, Iraqi mines found their mark. Within three hours of each other, &quot;Tripoli&quot; and were rocked by exploding mines. As damage control teams successfully overcame fires and flooding aboard &quot;Tripoli&quot; and &quot;Princeton&quot;, &quot;Impervious&quot;, &quot;Leader&quot;, and &quot;Avenger&quot; searched for additional mines in the area. &quot;Adroit&quot; led the salvage tug toward &quot;Princeton&quot; to tow her to safety.

&quot;Tripoli&quot; was able to continue her mission for several days, until she was relieved by and and proceeded to Bahrain for repairs. &quot;New Orleans&quot; provided the helicopter deck while the mine group staff moved aboard &quot;La Salle&quot; to coordinate the operation. &quot;Princeton&quot; restored her TLAM strike and AEGIS anti-air warfare defense capabilities within fifteen minutes of the mine strike, whereupon she reassumed duties as local anti-air warfare coordinator and remained on station, providing defense for the mine countermeasures group for an additional 30 hours, until relieved.
Charts and intelligence captured from Iraq showed the mine field where &quot;Tripoli&quot; and &quot;Princeton&quot; were hit was one of six laid in a arc from Faylaka Island to the Saudi-Kuwaiti border. Within that arc, there were four additional mine lines—a total of more than 1,000 mines—laid over a five-month period. Three days later, the massive 31-ship amphibious task force moved north to assist in battlefield preparation as the deadline for the ground offensive neared. As &quot;Wisconsin&quot; and &quot;Missouri&quot; steamed in the vicinity of recently cleared Point Foxtrot, their gun crews continued to hit Iraqi targets. Marine AV-8B Harriers launched from the flight deck of &quot;Nassau&quot; conducted strikes ashore. Three crewmen received Bronze Stars, three others received Silver Stars and the ship was awarded the Combat Action Ribbon for exceptional performance during the incident.

When Somali warlords controlled the city of Mogadishu, &quot;Tripoli&quot; was ordered to respond. On 3 December 1992, &quot;Tripoli&quot; arrived off the coast of Somalia and conducted the first landing of forces in support of Operation Restore Hope. During the night landing, &quot;Tripoli&quot;&#x27;s Marines were able to secure the airport and seaports in Mogadishu.

When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein began to redeploy his forces along the border of Kuwait in late 1994, &quot;Tripoli&quot; was sent as the initial show of force. Assuming duties with other ships in the northern Persian Gulf, &quot;Tripoli&quot; prepared to conduct amphibious operations in response to any further southward movement by Iraqi forces. Operation Vigilant Warrior resulted in the withdrawal of Hussein&#x27;s forces from Kuwait&#x27;s border.

==Decommissioning==

&quot;Tripoli&quot; was decommissioned in 1995 and as of 2004, she was on loan to the US Army, but remained laid up at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. In December 2006, the ship was towed to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she had a high-tech role as a launch platform with the United States&#x27; developing ballistic missile defense program. Three times the ship was towed some off shore and used to launch small ballistic missiles, which were then intercepted by Terminal High Altitude Area Defense Missiles, test-fired from the Pacific Missile Range Facility. The last test in the series was performed 26 October, when the ship fired a &quot;Scud-like&quot; missile, which was successfully intercepted. The ship was towed back to the San Francisco Bay Area for the winter. As the Hawaiian island of Kaua&#x27;i lacked a suitable land-based launch site, and the costs of building one would far exceed the approximately $600,000 per year it costs to use the old warship, so the vessel returned to Pearl Harbor for a second series of tests in late spring 2008. In March 2015, the ship was towed back through the Panama Canal and stored with the Beaumont Reserve Fleet. In August 2016 the US Maritime Administration designated her for disposal. In July 2018, &quot;Tripoli&quot; was towed from Beaumont to Brownsville, Texas, for scrapping by European Metal Recycling.

<text>Joses () is a name, usually regarded as a form of Joseph, occurring many times in the New Testament:

* Joses, one of the four &quot;brothers&quot; of Jesus ()
* Joses or Joseph, son of a Mary of Clopas and brother of a James (James the Less according to Mark 15:40), mentioned in Mark 15:40, Mark 15:47, and Matthew 27:56
* Joses or Joseph, the real name of Barnabas according to Acts 4:36
* There is also a Ἰησοῦ or a Ἰωσή (&quot;Jose&quot;, &quot;Joshua&quot; or &quot;Jesus&quot;) in Luke 3:29

== Etymology ==
&quot;Joses&quot; is a short Greek form of Joseph. Unlike Greek &quot;Joseph,&quot; however, which remains frozen as &quot;Joseph&quot; in all grammatical cases, &quot;Joses&quot; functions like a true Greek name and is declined in Greek, taking the ending &quot;&quot; in the genitive case, hence &quot;Jose&quot;/&quot;Josetos&quot; (/), &#x27;of Joses&#x27;.

Although spelling of Joseph is fairly constant in Greek, spellings of the short forms Joses and Josis vary. Tal Ilan&#x27;s catalogue of Jewish name inscriptions of the period (2002) notes variation in the spelling of &quot;Joseph&quot; (indeclinable in Greek) and various shorter (and sometimes declined) Greek variants, but also notes that the full form &quot;Joseph&quot; is dominant with 47 of 69 Greek inscriptions.

== New Testament ==
&quot;Joses&quot; and &quot;Joseph&quot; in their various grammatical cases are often found as textual variants in the New Testament.

=== Joses, brother of Jesus ===
A minority of (Alexandrian, Western) Greek manuscripts in Matthew 13:55 read &quot;Joseph&quot; () the standard spelling of the name. Roman Catholics hold that Joses the brother of Jesus is the same as Joses the brother of James referred in Matthew 27:56 and Mark 15:40.

=== Joses, brother of James (the Less?) ===
In Mark 15:40 and Mark 15:47, a Joses is identified as the son of a certain Mary, who is also the mother of a certain James. For both verses, Ἰωσῆτος and Ἰωσῆ are found as textual variants, but both are genitives of Ἰωσὴς meaning &quot;of Joses&quot;. 
Matthew 27:56 also refers to a Mary, mother of a James, but it is unclear whether her other son is called &quot;Joses&quot; (Ἰωσῆ, favoured by Stephanus Textus Receptus 1550, Scrivener&#x27;s Textus Receptus 1894, RP Byzantine Majority Text 2005, and the Greek Orthodox Church) or &quot;Joseph&quot; (Ἰωσὴφ, favoured by Westcott and Hort 1881, Westcott and Hort / [NA27 and UBS4 variants], Tischendorf&#x27;s 8th Edition 1864–94, and Nestle 1904). Modern English Bible translations are about evenly split on which textual variant to follow, with half including the New International Version (1978) rendering it as &quot;of Joseph&quot;, and the other half including the English Standard Version (2001) as &quot;of Joses&quot;.
In the New Testament, the name &quot;James the Less&quot; appears only in Mark 15:40, who, by parallel accounts of the women at the crucifixion is usually equated with the James in &quot;Mary the mother of James,&quot; who in turn is sometimes equated with Mary of Clopas, mentioned only in John 19:25. According to a tradition of Hegesippus (Eusebius III.11), this Clopas was a brother of Joseph, making his wife Mary Jesus&#x27; aunt and this James the younger and Joses to be Jesus&#x27; cousins.

James Tabor speculates that Mary the mother of James is the same person with Mary the mother of Jesus and that Clopas was her second husband, thus making Joses half brother of Jesus. Roman Catholic tradition follows Jerome&#x27;s view that Mary the mother of James (wife of Clopas) is the sister of Mary the mother of Jesus, though they need not be literally sisters, in light of the usage of the said words in Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic.

=== Acts 4:36 (Barnabas) ===
Acts 4:36 states that the person whom the apostles surnamed/nicknamed/called &quot;Barnabas&quot; (Βαρνάβας) was actually named Ἰωσὴφ (&quot;Joseph&quot;) according to Westcott and Hort 1881, Westcott and Hort / [NA27 and UBS4 variants], Tischendorf&#x27;s 8th Edition 1864–94, and Nestle 1904, or Ἰωσὴς (&quot;Joses&quot;) according to Stephanus Textus Receptus 1550, Scrivener&#x27;s Textus Receptus 1894, RP Byzantine Majority Text 2005, and the Greek Orthodox Church. Most modern English Bible translations such as the New International Version (1978) render it as &quot;Joseph&quot;, a minority including the King James Version (1611) as &quot;Joses&quot;.

=== Luke 3:29 ===
In the Lukan genealogy of Jesus, Luke 3:29 mentions a Ἰησοῦ or a Ἰωσή (both in genetive) as the 15th descendant of David in the line from Solomon&#x27;s younger brother Nathan. Ἰησοῦ &quot;Iēsou&quot; is the textual variant favoured by Westcott and Hort 1881, Westcott and Hort / [NA27 and UBS4 variants], Tischendorf&#x27;s 8th Edition 1864–94, and Nestle 1904, while the variant Ἰωσῆ &quot;Iōsē&quot; is favoured by Stephanus Textus Receptus 1550, Scrivener&#x27;s Textus Receptus 1894, RP Byzantine Majority Text 2005, and the Greek Orthodox Church. Most modern English Bible translations such as the New International Version (1978) render it as &quot;Joshua&quot;, many others including the King James Version (1611) as &quot;Jose&quot;, and a few including the American Standard Version (1900) as &quot;Jesus&quot;.

The Greek spelling (, ) is a variant of Joses.

== Bishops of Jerusalem ==
A &quot;Joses&quot; appears in the bishop lists of Epiphanius (&quot;Josis&quot;) and Eusebius (&quot;Joseph&quot;) of the early bishops of Jerusalem.

== Christian traditions ==
In the medieval &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, Joses is also identified with Joseph Barsabbas, also called Justus, who in the Acts of the Apostles 1:23 is mentioned as a candidate to fill the vacancy created by the death of Judas Iscariot.

Eusebius lists Justus as the third Bishop of Jerusalem after James the Just and Simeon of Jerusalem. He does not, however, specify whether this Justus is to be identified with Joses, the brother of Jesus:
:&quot;But when Symeon also had died in the manner described, a certain Jew by the name of Justus succeeded to the episcopal throne in Jerusalem. He was one of the many thousands of the circumcision who at that time believed in Christ.&quot;

Conversely, in the second book of Panarion, Epiphanius identifies the third Bishop of Jerusalem as &quot;Judah&quot;, and the Apostolic Constitutions similarly calls him &quot;Judas the son of James&quot;.

<text>Hanno Drechsler (24 March 1931 – 4 January 2003) was the Lord Mayor of the City of Marburg, Germany between 1970 and 1992, and the instigator of its restoration after urban renewal; he was also an important Social Democratic politician and political scientist.

== Life ==
=== Education ===
Hanno Drechsler went to school in Saxony, where after High School he studied to become a teacher and was certified for doing so on all levels, becoming very early the Principal of the &quot;Oberschule&quot; in Falkenstein. Because of political conflicts with the SED regime (such as the toleration of students who were members of a church), he and his wife fled East Germany in 1955, and settled in Marburg, West Germany. Here, Drechsler studied again, at the University of Marburg (1955–1961), mostly Political Science, History, and the German language, and became a student and then assistant of the political scientist Wolfgang Abendroth who was the main representative of political science of the &quot;Frankfurt School&quot;. In 1962, he received his PhD with a thesis on the Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands (SAP), and became an expert on the small parties &quot;between&quot; social democrats and communists during the Weimar Republic.

=== Career ===
Afterwards, he became &quot;(Ober-)Studienratim Hochschuldienst&quot; (lecturer and senior lecturer or assistant professor, but with tenure) at the University of Giessen&#x27;s Political Science Department. He remained active in Marburg municipal and Hesse politics as a social democrat, where he soon held positions in the City Parliament. In 1970, he was elected – after declining to become the president of the newly founded University of Kassel – Lord Mayor of the City of Marburg, a position he held until his retirement for health reasons in 1992, drawing in the end popular support of well over 75% of the citizens.

=== Achievements ===
He provided tenacious and strong support and implementation of the restoration of the &quot;Oberstadt&quot; (uptown) of Marburg, one of the most important old German cities largely untouched by the war, full with timbered and stone houses of Gothic and Renaissance times and with famous castle, churches, including the earliest Gothic church in Germany dedicated to St. Elisabeth of Hungary. In the beginning, this was a battle against the zeitgeist, as the idea in the early 1970s was still to raze the old houses to the ground, make the town centre accessible to traffic, etc. To restore all houses individually, create pedestrian zones, but to make the &quot;Oberstadt&quot; livable and not just a tourist attraction was largely his idea, and he implemented it against then strong opposition.

He significantly promoted art and culture as well, using his contacts and charisma to assist artists and musicians in Marburg. Much in the international success of Rose Nabinger and the jazz band &quot;Kreisjazzwerkerschaft&quot; probably came from their appearances he made possible in the sister cities all over Europe.

=== Party functions ===
Since 1956, Drechsler was a member of the SPD and held numerous party function, also on the state and federal level. He was for decades the chairman of the local government SPD council in Hesse and on the board of the Deutscher Städtetag, the German Council of Independent Cities. He was a strong promoter, also in scholarly work and writings, of municipal autonomy, as well as of German Reunification. Offers of other positions, such as SPD candidate (with a great likelihood to win) for Lord Mayor of Frankfurt am Main, or as Minister of the Interior of Hesse, he always declined.

=== Honours ===
Among the many honours Drechsler received are the &quot;Bundesverdienstkreuz&quot; (Federal Merit Cross) 1st Class, the Merit Cross of the State of Hesse, the Silver Merit Cross of the Red Cross Germany, and the Freiherr vom Stein-Plaque, the highest German award for merits in the area of local governance and municipal autonomy. He was also an honorary citizen of Poitiers, France, a sister city of Marburg, and of Marburg itself. One of the issues closest to him – a Methodist – which he promoted very strongly was the dialogue and re-invitation of the Jewish former citizens of Marburg, the reopening of a synagogue and the reemergence of a Jewish community in Marburg; the recognitions and awards he received for that were those especially important to him. In fact, it was a stroke (after some earlier heart attacks) that he suffered after, against his doctors&#x27; advice, speaking in an outside ceremony to memorialize the &quot;Reichskristallnacht&quot; at the place of the former synagogue in 1991 that ended his career.

=== Family ===
Hanno Drechsler was married, for 53 years, to Gisela Drechsler née Streller (2 March 1931 – 19 October 2008); their son is the social scientist Wolfgang Drechsler.

=== Memorials ===
Today, Hanno Drechsler is remembered by the &quot;Hanno-Drechsler-Platz&quot;, an urban space that forms the south-westerly gate to the &quot;Oberstadt&quot; for pedestrians, with a fountain and trees, but mostly by the intact and restored &quot;Oberstadt&quot; itself.

<text>Bournemouth Football Club ( ) is an English football team currently playing in the , in the ninth tier of the English football league system. Their nickname is &quot;The Poppies&quot;, and they are often known as Bournemouth Poppies to avoid confusion with the Premier League club AFC Bournemouth. The club plays at Victoria Park, Namu Road, in Bournemouth and are founding members of the Hampshire FA and Bournemouth FA.

==History==
The club was founded as Bournemouth Rovers on 11 September 1875 at a meeting held in Abbotts Auction Mart in Old Christchurch Road. In 1878 on Tuesday 26 November the club participated in one of the first floodlit matches, when they played under experimental electric lights at Dean Park for &quot;a grand exhibition of the new electric light&quot;. In 1888 the club moved to Dean Park, and changed their name to Bournemouth Dean Park. The club changed its name again to Bournemouth F.C. in 1889 when the club amalgamated with local side Bournemouth Arabs, and moved grounds a season later to Victoria Park. In 1896–97 the club became founder members of the Hampshire League.

The club won the West Division in 1905 and repeated this again in 1910, this time playing at their new home of Namu Road. Namu Road was given to the club in 1908 by Mr. Jack Joy, a local landowner and former member of the club. A year later a grandstand was erected and formally opened by the Mayor. The Poppies had more success in the early years becoming County Division Champions either side of the Great War in 1914 and 1922. However, in 1929 the club was relegated into the newly formed Division Two, but were promoted back to Division One as champions in 1932. After the war, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time in the 1946–47 season. The club achieved some success in other cup competitions in winning the Hampshire Intermediate Cup in 1950 and again in 1970 and 1972. In 1974 the stand that had been erected in 1909 was destroyed by fire.

The club at the end of the 1978–79 season were promoted back to Division one of the Hampshire League but could only last a season in the top division. This relegation was followed two seasons later by a further relegation putting the club back into Division Three. They would remain in this division until joining the newly formed Wessex League in 1985. The club two seasons later made its Debut in the FA Vase losing to Bridport in the Extra Preliminary round in the 1987–88 season. The club has since remained in this division with its best performance being in the 1994–95 season when under manager Alex Pike, they finished as runners-up to Fleet Town.

In the 2010–11 campaign the club won the League Cup, winning the final 1–0 against Winchester City.

==Club officials==
==Ground==
Bournemouth play their games at Victoria Park, Namu Road, Winton, Bournemouth. The ground was sold to Bournemouth Council after the Second World War for £4,500, they now lease it to the club on a peppercorn rent. The clubhouse was opened in 1985. The ground features a 205-seater stand and several rows of bench seating replacing the stand that was destroyed by fire in 1974. The remaining three sides are flat standing separated from the playing area by a permanent metal barrier.

<text>In the field of comparative religion, many scholars, academics, and religious figures have looked at the relationships between [[Hinduism]] and [[major religions|other religions]].

==Indian religions==

===Ayyavazhi===

Ayyavazhi and Hinduism are two belief systems in India. Though Ayyavazhi continues to officially exist within Hinduism and is considered by some observers to be a Hindu denomination, members of the religion claim that it is independent. The most notable distinction from Hindu are the Ayyavazhi religion&#x27;s concepts of good, evil and dharma.

Hindus view Vedas, Gita, and other texts from the Shastra as canonical scriptures, instead of the Akilam. The Ayyavazhi believe that the Hindu scriptures were once canonical, but now have lost their Substance because of the advent of Akilam. Kaliyan bought the Vedas as a Boon and so all the previous religious books including Agamas and Puranas lost their Substances, leaving Akilattirattu Ammanai as the only book of perfection. Several dubious claims state that the present day Vedas are not accepted by Ayyavazhi as books of Perfection, because there is a quote in Akilam about Venneesan &quot;Avan pilathaal vedamondruntakki&quot; (He created a Veda of his own intention). All previous religious texts have lost their Substance in the vision of Ayyavazhi at the very moment Kaliyan came to the world.

Though Ayyavazhi has many differences from popular Hinduism, it has many beliefs and practices in common. As Hinduism is really a tree of many branches, Ayyavazhi is closest to Smartism and its Advaita beliefs in thought.

===Buddhism===
Buddhism and Hinduism have common origins in the Ganges culture of northern India during the &quot;second urbanisation&quot; around 500 BCE. They have shared parallel beliefs that have existed side by side, but also pronounced differences.

Buddhism attained prominence in the Indian subcontinent as it was supported by royal courts, but started to decline after the Gupta era and virtually disappeared from India in the 11th century CE, except in some pockets. It has continued to exist outside of India and has become the major religion in several Asian countries.

Hinduism and Buddhism originated in Northern India, but later expanded throughout Asia.

===Jainism===

Hinduism and Jainism have a rather similar view on the topic of asceticism, or, in simpler terms, abstinence. It is thought that their beliefs on the topic come from the early belief that some meditative and monastic practices cleanse the body of impurity. The Hindu theory of Karma gave Jainism a great deal of support to start promoting asceticism. Both of these traditions attribute human greed, hatred, and delusion to the presence of impure residues (samskaras or vasanas) that must be cleansed as the individual person moves towards &quot;freedom&quot; (death). Both of these religions believe that practicing asceticism is not only to the benefit of the individual but also to the benefit of the society as a whole. Nonviolence plays a large role in both of these religions so the concept of asceticism relies greatly on both of their beliefs.

===Sikhism===
The historical interaction between Sikhism and Hinduism occurred because both were founded on the Indian subcontinent and have the majority of their followers there.

==Abrahamic religions==

===Christianity===


====History====
There has been some debate on historical connections between Christianity and Indian religion, it has focused on both Buddhism (via Greco-Buddhism) as well as Hinduism. While it is evident that a number of Indian sages visited Constantinople in Classical Antiquity, claims of significant influence in either direction have failed to gain wide acceptance. Christianity revolves heavily around the life of Jesus Christ as detailed in the Bible, Nevertheless, some scholars have studied whether there are links between the story of Jesus and that of Krishna; &quot;Krishnology&quot; is a term coined to express these claimed theological parallels between Krishnaism and the Christological dogmas of Christianity.

Although little is known of the immediate growth of the church, Bar-Daisan (154–223 CE) reports that in his time there were Christian tribes in North India which claimed to have been converted by Thomas and to have books and relics to prove it.

Contemporary Christian-Hindu relations are a mixed affair. Hinduism&#x27;s historical tendency has been to recognize the divine basis of various other religions, and to revere their founders and saintly practitioners; this continues today. The declaration &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; by the Second Vatican Council officially established inter-religious dialogue between Catholics and Hindus, promoting common values between the two religions (among others). There are over 17.3 million Catholics in India, which represents less than 2% of the total population, still making it the largest Christian church in India. 
(See also: Dalit theology).

====Doctrine====
Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity differ on fundamental beliefs on heaven, hell and reincarnation, to name a few. From the Hindu perspective, heaven (Sanskrit: &quot;swarga&quot;) and hell (&quot;naraka&quot;) are temporary places, where every soul has to live, either for the good deeds done or for their sins committed. After a soul suffers its due punishment in hell, or after a soul has enjoyed enough in heaven, it again enters the life-death cycle. There is no concept in Hinduism of a permanent hell like that in Christianity; rather, the cycle of &quot;karma&quot; takes over. Permanent heaven or bliss is &quot;moksha&quot;.

Indian philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, wrote: 

The Holy Trinity of Christianity, consisting of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is sometimes seen as roughly analogous to the Trimurti of Hinduism, whose members—Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva—are seen as the three principal manifestations of Brahman, or Godhead. The specific formulation of this trinitarian relationship is not identical between the two religions; for example, in Hinduism there is a Parabrahma, or an ultimate creator who created the Trimurti, for which there exists no parallel in Christianity. Some consider Brahma to be more similar to the demiurge of Christian gnosticism, in that he (at least initially) wrongly thought himself as the &quot;Creator&quot; and also as the highest or even the only god. In this case, the Hindu version of the Trinity could be seen as Brahma (Father), Sankarshan or Vishnu (Holy spirit), and Mahesh or Shiva (Son; analogous to Christ).

There have been Christian writers such as the 17th century mystic Jane Leade and the 19th-20th century theologian Sergei Bulgakov, who have described the feminine Sophia (wisdom) as an aspect of the Godhead. This may serve as a rough analogue to Hinduism&#x27;s description of Sita in the Ramayana, who is saved by Hanuman (an incarnation of Shiva) from the demon king Ravana to be reunited with her husband Rama, representing God. Nevertheless, although the concept that we can come to know God through &quot;sophia&quot; has played a role in Christian thought, no major Christian denominations profess Sophia as an independent aspect of God.

In Hinduism (also in Jainism and Sikhism), the concept of moksha is akin to that of Buddhism&#x27;s nirvana, but some scholars further claim that it is akin as well to Christianity&#x27;s doctrine of salvation. Hindu sannyasi Swami Tripurari states:... in theory the sinners of the world are the beneficiaries of Christ’s sacrifice, but it is God the father for whose pleasure Christ underwent the crucifixion, even when the father’s joy in this scenario lies in the salvation of sinners. Christ represents the intermediary between God and humanity, and his life aptly illustrates the fact that it is sacrifice by which we come to meet our maker. Thus in Christ the Divine teaches us “the way” more than he does the goal. The Christ conception represents “the way” in the sense that the way is sacrifice, out of which love arises. The Krishna conception represents that for which we not only should, but must sacrifice, compelled by the Godhead’s irresistible attributes, etc. depicted therein.

The Christian Ashram Movement, a movement within Christianity in India, embraces Vedanta and the teachings of the East, attempting to combine the Christian faith with the Hindu ashram model, and Christian monasticism with the Hindu &quot;sannyasa&quot; tradition. In Western countries, Vedanta has influenced some Christian thinkers (see also: Pierre Johanns, Abhishiktananda, Bede Griffiths), while others in the anti-cult movement have reacted against the activities of immigrant gurus and their followers.

===Islam===
Hindu–Islamic relations began when Islamic influence first came to be found in the Indian subcontinent during the early 7th century. Hinduism and Islam are two of the world&#x27;s four largest religions. Hinduism is the socio-religious way of life of the Hindu people of the Indian subcontinent, their diaspora, and some other regions which had Hindu influence in the ancient and medieval times. Islam is a strictly monotheistic religion in which the supreme deity is Allah ( : see God in Islam), the last Islamic prophet being Muhammad ibn Abdullah, whom Muslims believe delivered the Islamic scripture, the Quran. Hinduism mostly shares common terms with the other Indian religions, including Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. Islam shares common characteristics with Abrahamic religions–those religions claiming descent from the prophet Abraham–being, from oldest to youngest, Judaism, Christianity, Islam.

The Qur&#x27;an is the primary Islamic scripture. Muslims believe it to be the verbatim, uncreated word of Allah. Second to this in religious authority, and whence many practices of Islam derive, especially for Sunnis, are the Sunni six major collections of hadīth, which are traditional records of the sayings and acts of Muhammad. The scriptures of Hinduism are the &quot;Shrutis&quot; (the four &quot;Vedas&quot;, which comprise the original Vedic Hymns, or Samhitas, and three tiers of commentaries upon the Samhitas, namely the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads); Furthermore, Hinduism is also based on the &quot;Smritis&quot; (including the &quot;Rāmāyana&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavad Gītā&quot; [part of the Mahabharata cycle], and the &quot;Purānas&quot;), which are considered to be of secondary authority and of human creation of sages but the 18 Puranas.

===Judaism===
Hinduism and Judaism are amongst the oldest existing religions in the world. They have shared a notable relationship throughout historical and modern times.

==Other religions==

Many theologians interpret Hinduism to teach that since all souls will eventually arrive at salvation, every religion can lead to it.

===Baháʼí Faith===

Hinduism is recognized in the Baháʼí Faith as one of four known religions and its scriptures are regarded as predicting the coming of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh (Kalki avatar). Krishna is included in the succession of Manifestations of God. The authenticity of the Hindu scriptures is seen as uncertain.

===Zoroastrianism===
Hinduism and Zoroastrianism share a common root in Proto-Indo-Iranian religion. Zoroastrianism in India shares more than a thousand years of history with the culture and people of India. The Zoroastrians of India are known as Parsis.

The &quot;Council of Dharmic Faiths&quot; (UK) regards Zoroastrianism, whilst not originating in the Indian subcontinent, also as a Dharmic religion.

=== Yezidism ===
Recently, some people have found similarities between the customs of Hindus and Yezidis, suggesting that in ancient times they may have even been one people. Recent comparisons and historical research between the two people have revealed many links that now thousands of Hindus and Yezidis believe that they are part of the same family.

<doc id="588084" wikidata="Q3245066" url="?curid=588084" title="List of Cornish saints">
<text>This is a list of Cornish saints, including saints more loosely associated with Cornwall: many of them will have links to sites elsewhere in regions with significant ancient British history, such as Wales, Brittany or Devon.

==List of some of the well-known Cornish saints==
For more information see the works of Canon Doble (1880–1945),Nicholas Orme&#x27;s book, &quot;The Saints of Cornwall&quot; (2000), and the works of Charles Henderson

&quot;N.B.&quot; All these have dedications in Cornwall but not all have legends or traditions associating them with Cornwall.
==Honorary canons of Truro==

The 24 honorary canons of Truro Cathedral occupy stalls named after 24 saints (almost all of them Cornish): Carantoc; Buriana; Germoe; Conan; Winwalloe; Nectan; Petroc; Adwenna; Piran; Constantine; Cybi; Paul; Breaca; Neot; Rumon; Sampson; German; Meriadoc; Euni; Ia; Endelienta; Columb; Corentin; Aldhelm.

==Modern Cornish saints==

More recent Cornishmen recognized for sanctity include the Irish-Cornish martyr Blessed John Cornelius.

<text>John Wise (August 15, 1652 – April 8, 1725) was a Congregationalist reverend and political leader in Massachusetts during the American colonial period. Wise was noted for his political activism, specifically his protests against British taxation, for which he was once jailed As the pastor of the Chebacco Parish from 1680 to his death in 1725, Wise lived in Ipswich, Massachusetts, often called &quot;the birthplace of American independence.&quot;

==Life==
Wise was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, the son of Joseph and Mary (Thompson) Wise. Mary was daughter of Alice Freeman Thompson Parke.

He attended the Roxbury Latin School, in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, graduating in 1669. He then was admitted to Harvard College (now Harvard University). After graduating from Harvard in 1673, he began studying theology, and preached in Branford, Connecticut and Hatfield, Massachusetts. On August 12, 1683, Wise was ordained as the pastor of the newly organized Chebacco Parish, a new parish formed out of Ipswich.

In 1688, Wise led Ipswich citizens in a protest against royal governor Edmund Andros and colonial taxation, after the revocation of the Charter of the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1684 which was superseded by the Dominion of New England. Andros took a hard-line position to the effect that the colonists had left behind all their rights as Englishmen when they left England. When in 1687 Wise rallied his parishioners to protest and resist taxation, Andros had him arrested, convicted and fined. As an Andros official explained, &quot;Mr. Wise, you have no more privileges Left you then not to be Sold for Slaves.&quot;.

Calvin Coolidge referred to him as one of the inspirations for the Declaration of Independence. John Wise Avenue, a section of Route 133 in Massachusetts, is named after him. Liberty ship , launched on June 14, 1942 and scrapped in 1971, was also named after him.

== Family ==
On December 5, 1678 he married Abigail Gardner, granddaughter of Thomas Gardner (Roxbury). They had seven children:
#Rev Jeremiah Wise (November 2, 1679 – January 20, 1756) married Mary Shipway 
#Lucy Wise (born c. 1681 – March 5, 1727) married John White
#John Wise (born c. 1683 – August 31, 1762) married Mary Rogers
#Mary Wise (May 12, 1685 – March 23, 1735/36) 
#Joseph Wise (February 16, 1686 – September 23, 1745) married Martha Appleton
#Amni Ruhami Wise (born c. 1688 – July 6, 1749) married Mary Ringe
#Henry Wise (born c. 1697 – November 12, 1775) married Mary Wade

Through his wife, Rev John was a great-uncle of President John Adams.

<doc id="588100" wikidata="Q1064777" url="?curid=588100" title="Charles Hartshorne">
<text>Charles Hartshorne (; June 5, 1897 – October 9, 2000) was an American philosopher who concentrated primarily on the philosophy of religion and metaphysics, but also contributed to ornithology. He developed the neoclassical idea of God and produced a modal proof of the existence of God that was a development of Anselm of Canterbury&#x27;s ontological argument. Hartshorne is also noted for developing Alfred North Whitehead&#x27;s process philosophy into process theology.

== Early life and education ==
Hartshorne was born in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, and was a son of the Reverend Francis Cope Hartshorne (1868–1950) and Marguerite Haughton (1868–1959), who were married on April 25, 1895, in Bryn Mawr, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. the Rev. F. C. Hartshorne, who was a minister in the Protestant Episcopal Church, was rector of St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Kittanning from 1897 to 1909, then rector of St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania for 19 years (from 1909 to 1928). After resigning from the ministry in late 1927 or early 1928, within a few years Francis was appointed pension fund manager of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Philadelphia.

Among Charles&#x27;s brothers was the prominent geographer Richard Hartshorne.

Charles attended Haverford College between 1915 and 1917, but then spent two years as a hospital orderly serving in the US Army. He then studied at Harvard University, where he earned the B.A. (1921), M.A. (1922) and PhD (1923) degrees. His doctoral dissertation was on &quot;The Unity of Being&quot;. He obtained all three degrees in only four years, an accomplishment believed unique in Harvard&#x27;s history.

From 1923 to 1925 Hartshorne pursued further studies in Europe. He attended the University of Freiburg, where he studied under the phenomenologist Edmund Husserl, and also the University of Marburg, where he studied under Martin Heidegger. He then returned to Harvard University as a research fellow from 1925 to 1928, where he and Paul Weiss edited the &quot;Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce&quot; v. 1–6 and spent a semester assisting Alfred North Whitehead.

== Career ==

After Hartshorne worked at Harvard University, he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago (1928 to 1955), and was also a member of the university&#x27;s Federated Theological Faculty (1943 to 1955). He then taught at Emory University (1955–62), followed by the University of Texas (1962–retirement). He published his last article at age 96 and delivered his last lecture at 98.

In addition to his long teaching career at the previous three universities, Hartshorne was also appointed as a special lecturer or visiting professor at Stanford University, the University of Washington, Yale University, the University of Frankfurt, the University of Melbourne and Kyoto University. He served as president of the Metaphysical Society of America in 1955. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1975.

== Intellectual influences ==
Hartshorne acknowledged that he was greatly influenced by Matthew Arnold (&quot;Literature and Dogma&quot;), Emerson&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;, Charles Sanders Peirce, and especially by Alfred North Whitehead. He acknowledged these and other &#x27;giants&#x27; in a 1983 lecture. Rufus Jones was his Haverford teacher and continuing mentor. He also found inspiration in the works of Josiah Royce (&quot;Problem of Christianity&quot;), William James, Henri Bergson, Ralph Barton Perry and Nikolai Berdyaev. He conducted a lengthy correspondence over some twenty-three years with Edgar S. Brightman of Boston University about their respective philosophical and theological views.

In turn Hartshorne has been a seminal influence on the theologians Matthew Fox, Daniel Day Williams, Norman Pittenger, Gregory A. Boyd, Schubert M. Ogden (born March 2, 1928) and John B. Cobb, on the American philosophers Frank Ebersole, Donald Viney and Daniel Dombrowski, and on the Australian biologist-futurologist Charles Birch.

== Philosophy and theology ==
The intellectual movement with which Hartshorne is associated is generally referred to as process philosophy and the related area of process theology. The roots of process thinking in Western philosophy can be found in the Greek Heraclitus and in Eastern philosophy in Buddhism. Contemporary process philosophy arose in large measure from the work of Alfred North Whitehead, but with important contributions by William James, Charles Peirce, and Henri Bergson, while Hartshorne is identified as the seminal influence on process theology that emerged after World War Two.

The key motifs of process philosophy are: empiricism, relationalism, process, and events.

The motif of empiricism in process thought refers to the theme that experience is the realm for defining meaning and verifying any theory of reality. Unlike classical empiricism, process thought takes the category of feeling beyond just the human senses of perception. Experiences are not confined to sense perception or consciousness, and there are pre-sensual, pre-conscious experiences from which consciousness and perception derive.

The motif of relationalism refers to both experiences and relationships. Humans experience things and also experience the relationship between things. The motif of process means that all time, history and change are in a dynamic evolutionary process. The final motif of events refers to all the units (organic and inorganic) of the world.

While Hartshorne acknowledges the importance of Whitehead on his own ideas, many of the elements of his philosophy are evident in his dissertation, written in 1923, prior to his encounter with Whitehead. Moreover, Hartshorne was not always in agreement with Whitehead, especially on the nature of possibility. Whitehead construed the realm of possibilities in terms of what he called Eternal Objects. Hartshorne was never happy with this way of speaking and followed Peirce in thinking of the realm of possibility as a continuum which, by definition, has no least member and which can be &quot;cut&quot; in infinitely many ways. Definite qualities, for example, a particular shade of blue, emerge in the creative process.

Another difference between Whitehead and Hartshorne is that the Englishman usually spoke of God as a single actual entity whereas Hartshorne thought it better to think of God as a personally ordered series of actual entities, each exhibiting the abstract character of divinity, as necessarily supreme in love, knowledge and power. In Hartshorne&#x27;s process theology God and the world exist in a dynamic, changing relationship. God is a &#x27;di-polar&#x27; deity. By this Hartshorne meant that God has both abstract and concrete poles. The abstract pole refers to those elements within God that never vary, such as God&#x27;s self-identity, while the concrete pole refers to the organic growth in God&#x27;s perfect knowledge of the world as the world itself develops and changes. Hartshorne did not accept the classical theistic claim of &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot; (creation out of nothing), and instead held to &quot;creatio ex materia&quot; (creation out of pre-existent material), although this is not an expression he used.

One of the technical terms Hartshorne used is pan-en-theism, originally coined by Karl Christian Friedrich Krause in 1828. Panentheism (all is in God) must be differentiated from Classical pantheism (all is God). In Hartshorne&#x27;s theology God is not identical with the world, but God is also not completely independent from the world. God has his self-identity that transcends the universe, but the world is also contained within God. A rough analogy is the relationship between a mother and a fetus. The mother has her own identity and is different from the unborn, yet is intimately connected to the unborn. The unborn is within the womb and attached to the mother via the umbilical cord.

Hartshorne reworked the ontological argument for God&#x27;s existence as promulgated by Anselm of Canterbury. In Anselm&#x27;s formula, &quot;God is that than which no greater can be conceived.&quot; Anselm&#x27;s argument used the concept of perfection. While Hartshorne believed that his reformulated ontological argument is sound, he never claimed that it was sufficient unto itself to establish the existence of God. Throughout his career, from the time of his dissertation, he relied upon a multiple argument strategy, commonly called a cumulative case, to establish the rationality of his di-polar theism.

Hartshorne accepts that, by definition, God is perfect. However, he maintains that classical theism, be it Jewish, Christian, or Muslim, has held to a self-contradictory notion of perfection. He argues that the classical concept of a deity for which all potentialities are actualized fails. Hartshorne posited that God&#x27;s existence is necessary and is compatible with any events in the world. In the economy of his argument Hartshorne has attempted to break a perceived stalemate in theology over the problem of evil and God&#x27;s omnipotence. For Hartshorne, perfection means that God cannot be surpassed in his social relatedness to every creature. God is capable of surpassing himself by growing and changing in his knowledge and feeling for the world.

Hartshorne acknowledged a God capable of change, as is consistent with pandeism, but early on he specifically rejected both deism and pandeism in favor of panentheism, writing that &quot;panentheistic doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations&quot;.

Hartshorne did not believe in the immortality of human souls as identities separate from God, but explained that all the beauty created in a person&#x27;s life will exist for ever in the reality of God. This can be understood in a way reminiscent of Hinduism, or perhaps Buddhism&#x27;s Sunyata (emptiness) ontology namely that a person&#x27;s identity is extinguished in one&#x27;s ultimate union with God, but that a person&#x27;s life within God is eternal.
Hartshorne regularly attended services at several Unitarian Universalist churches, and joined the First Unitarian Universalist Church in Austin, Texas.

By the end of his life, in his late nineties, Hartshorne viewed metaphysics as the most rewarding aspect of philosophy: &quot;the search for necessary truths, truths that are not only true, but they couldn’t have been false.” 

== Criticisms ==
Hartshorne&#x27;s philosophical and theological views have received criticism from many different quarters. Positive criticism has underscored that Hartshorne&#x27;s emphasis on change and process and creativity has acted as a great corrective to static thinking about causal laws and determinism. Several commentators affirm that his position offers metaphysical coherence by providing a coherent set of concepts.

Others indicate that Hartshorne has quite properly placed a valuable emphasis on appreciating nature (even evidenced in Hartshorne&#x27;s hobby for bird-watching). His emphasis on nature and human-divine relationships to the world has goaded reflective work on developing theologies about pollution, resource degradation and a philosophy of ecology. Allied to this has been Hartshorne&#x27;s emphasis on aesthetics and beauty. In his system of thought science and theology achieve some integration as science and theology provide data for each other.

Hartshorne has also been an important figure in upholding natural theology, and in offering an understanding of God as a personal, dynamic being. It is accepted by many philosophers that Hartshorne made the idea of perfection rationally conceivable, and so his contribution to the ontological argument is deemed to be valuable for modern philosophical discussion.

It has been said that Hartshorne has placed an interesting emphasis on affirming that the God who loves the creation also endures suffering. In his theological thought the centrality of love is very strong, particularly in his interpretation of God, nature and all living creatures. Hartshorne is also appreciated for his philosophical interest in Buddhism, and in stimulating others in new approaches to inter-religious co-operation and dialogue.

Langdon Gilkey questioned Hartshorne&#x27;s assumptions about human reasoning experiences. Gilkey pointed out that Hartshorne assumes there is an objective or rational structure to the whole universe, and he then assumes that human thought can acquire accurate and adequate knowledge of the universe.

In Hartshorne&#x27;s theology there is no literal first event in the universe, and the universe is thus regarded as an actually infinite reality. This has led some to point out that as Hartshorne has emphasized that every event has been partly determined by previous events, his thought is susceptible to the fallacy of the infinite regress.

Other critics question the adequacy of panentheism. The point of tension in Hartshorne&#x27;s theology is whether God is really worthy of worship since God needs the world in order to be a complete being. Traditional theism posits that God is a complete being before the creation of the world. Others find that his argument about God&#x27;s perfection is flawed by confusing existential necessity with logical necessity.

In classical Protestant and Evangelical thought, Hartshorne&#x27;s theology has received strong criticism. In these theological networks Hartshorne&#x27;s panentheist reinterpretation of God&#x27;s nature has been deemed to be incompatible with Biblical revelation and the classic creedal formulations of the Trinity. Critics such as Royce Gordon Gruenler (born January 10, 1930), Ronald Nash and Norman Geisler argue that Hartshorne does not offer a tripersonal view of the Trinity, and instead his interpretation of Christ (Christology) has some affinities with the early heresy of the Ebionites. It is also argued that Hartshorne&#x27;s theology entails a denial of divine foreknowledge and predestination to salvation. Hartshorne is also criticized for his denial or devaluing of Christ&#x27;s miracles and the supernatural events mentioned in the Bible.

Other criticisms are that Hartshorne gives little attention to the classical theological concepts of God&#x27;s holiness, and that the awe of God is an undeveloped element in his writings. Alan Wayne Gragg (born July 17, 1932) criticizes Hartshorne&#x27;s highly optimistic view of humanity, and hence its lack of emphasis on human depravity, guilt and sin. Allied to these criticisms is the assertion that Hartshorne overemphasizes aesthetics and is correspondingly weak on ethics and morality. Others have indicated that Hartshorne failed to understand traditional Christian views about petitionary prayer and survival of the individual in the afterlife.

==Personal life==

Hartshorne was a vegetarian. He did not own a car and preferred to use his bicycle. He was a supporter of feminism. Hartshorne was interested in bird vocalization. In 1973, he authored &quot;Born to Sing: An Interpretation and World Survey of Bird Song&quot; which argued that some bird species have evolved to appreciate melody and sing for pleasure.

<text>Wenna () was a medieval princess and Christian martyr who flourished in Wales and Cornwall. Later venerated as a saint, she is honoured at multiple churches in Cornwall and Devon.

== Life ==
According to the 12th-century &quot;Life of Nectan&quot;, Wenna was one of the twelve daughters of Brychan, a legendary king of Brycheiniog (modern-day Wales). Her siblings included Nectan, Mabyn, Ninnoc, and numerous other Brythonic saints. According to tradition, she was martyred by Saxons at Talgarth in 492.

== Veneration ==
Two churches and two chapels have been dedicated to a saint by the name of Wenna: a 12th-century chapel at Cheristow in Hartland parish in Devon, the 13th-century parish church of St Wenn, a 14th-century chapel at St Kew, and the 15th-century parish church of Morval, Cornwall. The dedication of the parish church of Morval, however, is sometimes attributed to another Saint Wenna, a 5th-century queen of Cornwall and sister of Saint Non. Wenna may have also had a holy well dedicated to her at St Wenn, but no specific records corroborate this.

Her feast day is 18 October, which is shared with the other Saint Wenna.

<text>John Sergeant Wise (December 27, 1846 – May 12, 1913) was an American author, lawyer, and politician in Virginia. He was the son of Henry A. Wise and Sarah Sergeant.

==Early life==

John was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1846, while his father was U.S. Minister to the Empire of Brazil. He lived as a youth with his father and others at Rolleston, their plantation on the Elizabeth River outside Norfolk, Virginia. His father served as a US Congressman before being elected as Governor of Virginia in 1856. After being privately tutored as a youth, Wise attended Virginia Military Institute.

Still a student when the American Civil War began, Wise served with the VMI Corps of Cadets at the Battle of New Market. Ordered to guard the Cadets&#x27; baggage train, he defied those orders to stay there, and took part in the Cadets&#x27; famous charge. After the battle, Wise accepted an officer&#x27;s commission in the Confederate States Army.

==Law and politics==
After the war, Wise studied law at the University of Virginia, where he was initiated as a Brother of Beta Theta Pi fraternity in 1867. That same year he graduated and was admitted to the bar.

Wise practiced law in Richmond, Virginia for many years. In 1880, he was an unsuccessful candidate for U.S. Representative. In May 1882, he was appointed United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, serving until March 1883.

Later in 1882, Wise was elected U.S. Representative for Virginia&#x27;s at-large seat as a &quot;Readjuster&quot; – a label used by a coalition of Republicans and dissident Virginia Democrats. He served in the 48th United States Congress, from 1883 to 1885.

Before the 1884 elections, Virginia&#x27;s districts were redrawn, abolishing the at-large seat. Wise did not seek re-election from a district. Instead, in 1885 he ran for Governor of Virginia as a Republican, but lost to Democrat Fitzhugh Lee.

In November 1902, Wise was the attorney of records in two federal lawsuits--&quot;Jones v. Montague&quot;, 194 U.S. Reports 147-153 (1904) and &quot;Selden v. Montague&quot;, 194 U.S. Reports 153 (1904)--which concerning the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1902. The former was on behalf of voters in Virginia&#x27;s 3rd congressional district against Virginia&#x27;s Governor Andrew Jackson Montague as well as the Secretary of the Commonwealth and the Auditor of Public Accounts, and sought a writ of prohibition against counting the November 1902 election returns and also complained that the party in power sought to disenfranchise colored voters. The convention&#x27;s delegates by a 47 to 38 majority voted not to submit their work product (which disenfranchised most Black and poor white voters) to voters as promised earlier, but instead proclaimed it as in effect as of July 10, 1902. The federal courts ruled they had no jurisdiction and relied upon a South Carolina constitutional convention case, &quot;Mills v. Green&quot;, 159 U.S. 651 (1895). U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brewer took judicial notice that the U.S. House of Representatives had seated the congressmen elected by Virginia voters that year and &quot;the thing sought to be prohibited has been done and cannot be undone by order of court&quot;, so the U.S. Supreme Court declined to get involved. By the 1904 election, fifty percent fewer white, and ninety percent fewer black men voted.

==Last years==
Wise later moved to New York City, and practiced law there until his retirement. He died in 1913, near Princess Anne, Maryland.

==Literary career==

John Wise wrote several books, most notably a memoir entitled &quot;The End of an Era&quot; (1899), which has been reprinted in numerous editions since its first publication. A full text edition is available online at the University of North Carolina&#x27;s website, &quot;Documenting the American South&quot;. It describes his boyhood in the last days before the Civil War, while he was living on his father&#x27;s plantation &quot;Rolleston&quot; in Virginia, with a childhood slave companion and friend. He also discusses the war years, his father&#x27;s role in the war, and his family.

=== Principal literary works ===
*&quot;Diomed: The Life, Travels, and Observations of a Dog&quot; (1897)
*&quot;The End of an Era&quot; (1899)
*&quot;The Lion&#x27;s Skin: a Historical Novel and a Novel History&quot; (1905)
*&quot;Recollections of Thirteen Presidents&quot; (1906)

== Family ==
On November 3, 1869, he married Evelyn Byrd Beverly Douglas, daughter of Hugh Douglas and Nancy Hamilton. John and Evelyn had nine children, seven sons and two daughters:
#John Sergeant Wise (died young)
#Hugh Douglas Wise
#Henry Alexander Wise
#John Sergeant Wise (as was custom, he was given the same name as an older brother who died young, in order to carry on his father&#x27;s name)
#Hamilton Wise
#Eva Douglas Wise
#Jennings Cropper Wise (recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross during the First World War, he became Commandant of Virginia Military Institute)
#Margaretta Watnough Wise
#Byrd Douglas Wise

New York State Senator Henry A. Wise (1906–1982) was his grandson.

==In popular culture==
Wise was portrayed by Luke Benward in the 2014 film &quot;Field of Lost Shoes&quot;, which depicted the Battle of New Market.

<doc id="588111" wikidata="Q188289" url="?curid=588111" title="Pakistani rupee">
<text>The Pakistani rupee (ISO code: PKR) is the official currency in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The issuance of the currency is controlled by the State Bank of Pakistan. It was officially adopted by the Government of Pakistan in 1949. Earlier the coins and notes were issued and controlled by the Reserve Bank of India until 1949, when it was handed over to the Government and State Bank of Pakistan, by the Government and Reserve Bank of India.

In Pakistani English, large values of rupees are counted in thousands; lac (hundred thousands); crore (ten-millions); arab (billion); kharab (hundred billion). Numbers are still grouped in thousands

==History==

The word &quot;rūpiya&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;rūpya&quot;, which means &quot;wrought silver, a coin of silver&quot;, in origin an adjective meaning &quot;shapely&quot;, with a more specific meaning of &quot;stamped, impressed&quot;, whence &quot;coin&quot;. It is derived from the noun &quot;rūpa&quot; &quot;shape, likeness, image&quot;. &quot;Rūpaya&quot; was used to denote the coin introduced by Sher Shah Suri during his reign from 1540 to 1545 CE.

The Pakistan (Monetary System and Reserve Bank) Order, 1947 was issued on 14 August 1947, by the Governor General of pre-partition British India, following the advice of an expert committee. It designated the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as the temporary monetary authority for both India and Pakistan until 30 September 1948. During this transitional period, currency notes issued by the RBI and the Government of India were to remain legal tender in Pakistan. The order also allowed these notes to bear inscriptions of Government of Pakistan in Urdu and English, to be circulated from 1 April 1948. Like the Indian rupee, it was originally divided into 16 &quot;annas&quot;, each of 4 &quot;pice&quot; or 12 &quot;pie&quot;.

For the first seven months following partition, currency issued by the RBI and the Government of India continued to circulate in Pakistan. Modified RBI notes in denominations of 2, 5, 10, and 100 rupees, and 1-rupee notes from the Government of India were later introduced. The modifications involved inscribing Government of Pakistan in English and &quot;Hakumat-e-Pakistan&quot; in Urdu on the front of the notes.

An early 1948 agreement between the governments of India and Pakistan resulted in an amendment to the Pakistan (Monetary System and Reserve Bank) Order, 1947, moving up the deadline for the RBI&#x27;s role as Pakistan&#x27;s monetary authority from 30 September 1948, to 30 June 1948. Concurrently, the arrangement for the RBI to supply inscribed Indian notes to Pakistan was terminated on 30 June 1948.

In January 1961, the currency was decimalised, with the rupee subdivided into 100 pice, renamed (in English) paise (singular paisa) later the same year. However, coins denominated in paise have not been issued since 1994.

In 1972, the newly independent Bangladesh introduced the taka originally at parity with the Pakistani rupee. Afterwards, the Pakistani rupee ceased to be legal tender in Bangladesh.

== Coins ==


In 1948, coins were introduced in denominations of 1 pice, , 1 and 2 annas, , and 1 rupee. 1 pie coins were added in 1951. In 1961, coins for 1, 5 and 10 pice were issued, followed later the same year by 1 paisa, 5 and 10 paise coins. In 1963, 10 and 25 paise coins were introduced, followed by 2 paise the next year. Re. 1/- coins were reintroduced in 1979, followed by Rs. 2/- in 1998 and Rs. 5/- in 2002. 2 paise coins were last minted in 1976, with 1 paisa coins ceasing production in 1979. The 5, 10, 25 and 50 paise all ceased production in 1996. There are two variations of Rs. 2/- coins: most have clouds above the Badshahi Mosque but many don&#x27;t. The Re. 1/- and Rs. 2/- coins were changed to Aluminium in 2007.

Paisa-denominated coins ceased to be legal tender in 2013, leaving the Re. 1/- coin as the minimum legal tender. On 15 October 2015, the Pakistan government introduced a revised Rs. 5/- coin with a reduced size and weight and having a golden colour, made from a composition of copper-nickel-zinc, and also in 2016 a Rs. 10/- coin was introduced into circulation.

In 2019 the Pakistan government introduced a commemorative Rs. 50/- coin to celebrate the 550th birthday of Guru Nanak and in tribute of opening of new Gurdwara of Kartarpur, Pakistan.

==Banknotes==
On 1 April 1948, provisional notes were issued by the Reserve Bank of India and the Government of India on behalf of the Government of Pakistan, for use exclusively within Pakistan, without the possibility of redemption in India. Printed by the India Security Press in Nasik, these notes consist of Indian note plates engraved (not overprinted) with the words GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN in English and &quot;Hukumat-e-PAKISTAN&quot; in Urdu added at the top and bottom, respectively, of the watermark area on the front only; the signatures on these notes remain those of Indian banking and finance officials. Additionally, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Thomas De La Rue and Company, along with Bradbury Wilkinson and Company, manufactured various denominations for Pakistan.
After independence, the Pakistani government established a national security printing facility in 1949, named the Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC). This venture, a partnership between Thomas De La Rue &amp; Co. Ltd. (holding a 40% stake) and the Pakistani Government (with a 60% stake), started with a capital of 7.5 million rupees. The foundation for the facility was laid in Karachi by the Governor General of Pakistan on 11 March 1949. In selecting a printing method, the PSPC chose the intaglio process over the lithographic method due to concerns about counterfeiting and regional security issues with India. This decision reflected a preference for a higher-security printing technique.

Regular government issues commenced in 1948 in denominations of Re. 1/-, Rs. 5/-, Rs. 10/- and Rs. 100/-. The government continued to issue Re. 1 notes until the 1980s but another note-issuing was taken over by the State Bank of Pakistan in 1953 when Rs. 2/-, Rs. 5/-, Rs. 10/- and Rs. 100/- notes were issued. Only a few Rs. 2/- notes were issued. Rs. 50/- notes were added in 1957, with Rs. 2/- notes reintroduced in 1985. In 1986, Rs. 500/- notes were introduced, followed by Rs. 1,000/- the next year. Rs. 2/- and Rs. 5/- notes were replaced by coins in 1998 and 2002. Rs. 20/- notes were added in 2005, followed by Rs. 5,000/- in 2006. Until 1971, Pakistan banknotes were bilingual, featuring Bengali translation of the Urdu text (where the currency was renamed &quot;taka&quot;), since Bengali was the state language of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).

The PSPC began issuing its own 1- and 5-rupee notes in the fiscal year 1952-53. These notes resembled those previously produced by Thomas de la Rue &amp; Company, but the 1-rupee note featured a notable change: a blue back without under-print, different from the purple back of the British versions. This new design was circulated on 31 January 1953.

On 14 December 1963, the State Bank of Pakistan started operating its printing press, eventually taking over all national banknote production. Later, the 1-rupee note was modified to include a purple back with pink and blue under-print, similar to the De La Rue design. Variations of the 1-rupee note are identified by differences in the serial number font and signature styles.

Although the PSPC had been printing lower denomination notes since July 1953, the third series of the 100-rupee note, released in September 1953, was initially produced by Thomas De La Rue in the UK. Subsequently, these notes were printed by the PSPC, with the change in production source identifiable by variations in the serial number font.

In 2024 was released that Pakistan plans to roll out new banknotes of all denominations, the new currency notes would be of different colors, distinct serial numbers, design and include &quot;high security features.&quot; the transition to new banknotes would not be abrupt. Pakistan&#x27;s central bank will introduce a new polymer plastic currency banknote later this year while also redesigning all existing banknotes to enhance security and incorporate hologram features.In addition to the redesign, the State Bank plans to introduce a new polymer plastic banknote in one denomination later this year. &quot;If it is received well by the public, plastic currency will be introduced in other denominations,&quot; Ahmed stated (The denominations to be redesigned include Rs 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000).Governor Ahmed also confirmed that there are no plans to cancel the Rs 5,000 note, despite suggestions from some members of the Senate committee, including Mohsin Aziz, who argued that the high-denomination note facilitates corruption.

===Banknote features===
All banknotes other than the Re. 1/- and Rs. 2/- feature a portrait of Muhammad Ali Jinnah on the obverse along with writing in Urdu. The reverses of the banknotes vary in design and have English text. The only Urdu text found on the reverse is the Urdu translation of the Prophetic Hadith, &quot;Seeking an honest livelihood is an act of worship.&quot; which is (Hasool-e-Rizq-e-Halal Ibaadat hai).

The banknotes vary in size and colour, with larger denominations being longer than smaller ones. All contain multiple colours. However, each denomination does have one colour which predominates. All banknotes feature a watermark for security purposes. On the larger denomination notes, the watermark is a picture of Jinnah, while on smaller notes, it is a crescent and star. Different types of security threads are also present in each banknote.

===List of banknotes===
The State Bank has started a new series of banknotes, phasing out the older designs for new, more secure ones.

=== Special Banknotes ===

=== Haj ===
Pakistan put foreign exchange controls in place in 1949, restricting the export and import of currency except for when needed for Hajj in Saudi Arabia. This created an opportunity for smuggling, leading Pakistan to issue special Haj notes for use by pilgrims. These were differentiated by an overprint in English &quot;For pilgrims from Pakistan for use in Saudi Arabia and Iraq&quot;.

Although other means of exchange were considered, the high level of illiteracy amongst the Pakistani pilgrims and the additional costs that would be incurred through the need to purchase such means prevented the government from these methods of exchange. The State Bank Order to allow the issue of these Haj notes was made in May 1950.

A new series of notes was released in 1972, under the name of the State Bank of Pakistan rather than the Government of Pakistan. These had an Urdu overprint as well as an English one, saying &quot;For Hajj [sic] pilgrims from Pakistan for use in Saudi Arabia only&quot;. New notes were printed in 1975 and 1978, reflecting changes in the standard notes. The use of Haj notes continued until 1978.

Until this date, stocks of notes were used without the necessity of printing new notes with the signatures of the later Governors. It is believed that, once the use of Haj Notes was discontinued, most of the remaining stock of notes was destroyed. However, many notes entered the collector market following their sale to a banknote dealer by the State Bank of Pakistan.

=== Pakistan&#x27;s 75th Independence Commemorative Bank Note ===
On 14 August 2022, State Bank of Pakistan released the design of the commemorative 75 Rupees note marking the 75th anniversary of Independence day of Pakistan. The note was signed by the former governor of State Bank of Pakistan Raza Baqir and was made available to the public from September 30, 2022.

=== State Banks 75th Anniversary Banknote ===
On July 4, 2023, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmad introduced a commemorative Rs. 75 banknote to celebrate the central bank&#x27;s 75th anniversary.

==== Security Features ====
The Rs75 commemorative note is equipped with security features as with the other currency notes. These include the Urdu numeral &#x27;75&#x27; which appears complete when the note is held in the light, Pure Image security thread with pulsing holographic rainbow effect and micro-lettering of &#x27;SBP&#x27; and &#x27;75&#x27;, among others.

Moreover, the portraits and numbers on the note have raised printing, allowing identification of the banknote by the visually impaired.

==== Controversies Regarding Legal Status ====
During Eid al-Fitr, shopkeepers across Pakistan refused to accept Rs. 75 notes, sparking rumors about the note’s possible demonetization.

In response, SBP spokesperson Abid Qamar posted a video on the central bank’s official Twitter account, reassuring the public that the Rs. 75 commemorative note is fully valid for transactions. He explained that the SBP issues all currency under Section 25 of its Act, and the Rs. 75 note has no expiration date.

Qamar also dismissed rumors that the government had withdrawn or discontinued the banknote.

The commemorative note issued in 2022 for Pakistan’s 75th independence anniversary featured Quaid-e-Azam, Fatima Jinnah, Allama Iqbal, and Sir Syed Ahmad Khan. This selection stirred some debate, as certain individuals felt the omission of figures like Pakistan’s first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, was significant.

==== Supply ====
He explained that the commemorative Rs. 75 banknote, a legal tender, will not impact the overall money supply. Of the 4.3 billion notes being circulated this year, only 65 million will be the Rs. 75 denomination, making it a limited, one-time release.


== Exchange rate ==

Between 1948 and July 1955, the Pakistani rupee was effectively pegged to the U.S. dollar at approximately Rs.3/ per U.S. dollar. Afterwards, this was changed to approximately Rs.4/ per U.S. dollar, a devaluation of 30%, to match the Indian rupee&#x27;s value. This fixed exchange rate was maintained until 11 May 1972, in which the rupee was devalued to Rs.11/- per dollar.

Initially, the Indian and Pakistani rupees were at parity until sterling was devalued in 1949, in which India followed suit but Pakistan did not. This caused the Pakistani rupee to be valued at a 44% premium to the Indian rupee until the Pakistani rupee was devalued in 1955, returning to parity with the Indian rupee. This parity lasted until India devalued their currency in 1966.

Since the United States dollar suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper currency into any precious metal, the Pakistani rupee has been fiat money. Before the collapse of Bretton Woods system, the currency was pegged at a fixed exchange rate to the United States dollar for international trade, with the dollar convertible to gold for foreign governments only.

The rupee was pegged to British Pound until 1982 when the government of General Zia-ul-Haq changed to a managed float. As a result, the rupee devalued by 38.5% between 1982–83 and 1987–88 and the cost of importing raw materials increased rapidly, causing pressure on Pakistani finances and damaging much of the industrial base. The Pakistani rupee depreciated against the United States dollar until the turn of the century when Pakistan&#x27;s large current account surplus pushed the value of the rupee up against the dollar. The State Bank of Pakistan then stabilized the exchange rate by lowering interest rates and buying dollars, to preserve the country&#x27;s export competitiveness.

2008 was termed a disastrous year for the rupee after the elections: between December 2007 and August 2008, it lost 23% of its value, falling to a record low of Rs.79/ against the US dollar. The major reasons for this depreciation were huge current and trade accounts deficits that had built up since the credit boom in Pakistan after 2002. Due to rising militancy in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and its tribal areas, foreign direct investment began to fall, and the structural problems of the balance of payment were exposed; foreign exchange reserves fell disastrously to as low as US$2 billion.

The rupee continued to slowly decline until the start of 2018 when it began to rapidly devalue. The crash worsened midway through 2021, with the Pakistani rupee losing almost half its value between May 2021 and May 2023. This is largely attributed to political instability, devastating flooding, and a debt crisis.

The Pakistani rupee gained value from the end of September until mid-October 2023, when Pakistan&#x27;s Federal Investigation Agency embarked on a country-wide raid on exchange companies involved in illegal dollar transactions, which involved the buying and selling of dollars through informal channels without documentation. Since then, the Pakistani rupee became the best-performing currency of September 2023 against the US dollar.

<text>Ursula (Latin for &#x27;little she-bear&#x27;) was a Romano-British virgin and martyr possibly of royal origin. She is venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican Communion. Her feast day in the pre-1970 General Roman Calendar and in some regional calendars of the ordinary form of the Roman Rite is 21 October.

== History ==
There is little information about Ursula or the anonymous group of holy virgins who accompanied her and, on an uncertain date, were killed along with her at Colonia Agrippina. They remain in the Roman Martyrology, although their commemoration does not appear in the simplified General Roman Calendar of the 1970 Missale Romanum. 

The earliest evidence of a cult of martyred virgins at Cologne is an inscription from in the Church of St. Ursula, located on Ursulaplatz in Cologne; it states that the ancient basilica had been restored on the site where some holy virgins were killed. The earliest source to name one of these virgins as &quot;Ursula&quot; dates from the 10th century.

Her legendary fame comes from a medieval story. The tale depicts her as a princess who at the request of her father, the semi-legendary King Dionotus of Dumnonia in south-west Britain in the late-4th century, set sail along with 11,000 virginal handmaidens to join her and her future husband, the pagan governor Conan Meriadoc of Armorica. After a miraculous storm brought them over the sea in a single day to a Gaulish port, Ursula declared that before her marriage she would undertake a pan-European pilgrimage. She headed for Rome with her followers and persuaded the Pope, Cyriacus (unknown in the pontifical records, though from late AD 384 there was a Pope Siricius), and Sulpicius, bishop of Ravenna, to join them. After setting out for Cologne, which was being besieged by Huns, all the virgins were beheaded in a massacre. The Huns&#x27; leader fatally shot Ursula with an arrow in about AD 383 (the date varies).

There is only one church dedicated to Saint Ursula in the United Kingdom. It is located in Wales at Llangwyryfon, Ceredigion.

The Ursulines and the Virgin Islands are named after Saint Ursula and her companions.

==The Legend of St Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Companions==
===Lack of historical credibility===
The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1912) article on Ursula states that &quot;this legend, with its countless variants and increasingly fabulous developments, would fill more than a hundred pages. Various characteristics of it were already regarded with suspicion by certain medieval writers, and since [Caesar] Baronius have been universally rejected&quot;. Neither Jerome nor Gregory of Tours refers to Ursula in his writings. Gregory of Tours mentions the legend of the Theban Legion, to whom a church that once stood in Cologne was dedicated. The most important hagiographers (Bede, Ado, Usuard, Notker the Stammerer, Hrabanus Maurus) of the early Middle Ages also do not enter Ursula under 21 October, her feast day.

===Tenth-century legend===
A legend resembling Ursula&#x27;s appeared in the first half of the tenth century; it does not mention the name &quot;Ursula&quot;, but rather gives the leader of the martyred group as &quot;Pinnosa&quot; or &quot;Vinnosa&quot;. Pinnosa&#x27;s relics were transferred about 947 from Cologne to Essen, and from this point forward Ursula&#x27;s role was emphasised. In 970, for example, the first &quot;Passio Ursulae&quot; was written, naming Ursula rather than Pinnosa as the group&#x27;s leader (although Pinnosa is mentioned as one of the group&#x27;s members). This change might also be due in part to the discovery at this time of an epitaph speaking of Ursula, the &quot;innocent virgin&quot;.

===Misreading of Latin===


According to Geoffrey of Monmouth, a 12th-century British cleric and writer, Ursula was the daughter of Dionotus, ruler of Cornwall. However, this may have been based on his misreading of the words &quot;Deo notus&quot; in the second &quot;Passio Ursulae&quot;, written about 1105. The plot may have been influenced by a story told by the 6th-century writer Procopius about a British queen sailing with 100,000 soldiers to the mouth of the Rhine in order to compel her unwilling groom Radigis, king of the Varni, to marry her.

While there was a tradition of virgin martyrs in Cologne by the fifth century, their number may have been limited to between two and eleven, according to different sources. Yet the cleric Wandelbert of the Abbey of Prüm stated in his martyrology in 848 that the number of martyrs counted &quot;thousands of saints&quot; who were slaughtered on the boards of the River Rhine. The figure of 11,000 first appears in the late-9th century; suggestions as to where this number came from have included the reading of a name &quot;Undecimillia&quot; or &quot;Ximillia&quot; as a number, or reading the letters &quot;XI. M. V.&quot; as &#x27;eleven thousand [in Roman numerals] virgins&#x27; rather than as &#x27;eleven martyred virgins&#x27;. One scholar has suggested that in the eighth or ninth century, when the relics of virgin martyrs were found, they included those of a girl named Ursula, who was eleven years old—in Latin, &quot;undecimilia&quot;. This was subsequently misread or misinterpreted as &quot;undicimila&quot; (&#x27;eleven thousand&#x27;), thus producing the legend of the 11,000 virgins. In fact, the stone bearing the virgin Ursula&#x27;s name states that she lived eight years and two months. Another theory suggests that there was only one virgin martyr, named Undecimilla, &quot;which by some blundering monk was changed into eleven thousand&quot;.
It has also been suggested that &quot;cum [...] militibus&quot;, &quot;with [...] soldiers&quot;, was misread as &quot;cum [...] millibus&quot;, &quot;with [...] thousands&quot;. Most contemporary sources, however, cling to the number 11,000. The &quot;Passio&quot; from the 970s tries to bridge conflicting traditions by stating that the eleven maidens each commanded a ship containing one thousand virgins. Implicitly, the legend also refers to the twelve heavenly legions, mentioned in Matthew 26:53.

===Skeletal remains===

The Basilica of St. Ursula in Cologne holds the alleged relics of Ursula and her 11,000 companions. It contains what has been described as a &quot;veritable tsunami of ribs, shoulder blades, and femurs ... arranged in zigzags and swirls and even in the shapes of Latin words&quot;. The Goldene Kammer (Golden Chamber), a 17th-century chapel attached to the Basilica of St. Ursula, contains sculptures of their heads and torsos, &quot;some of the heads encased in silver, others covered with stuff of gold and caps of cloth of gold and velvet; loose bones thickly texture the upper walls&quot;. The peculiarities of the relics themselves have thrown doubt upon the historicity of Ursula and her 11,000 maidens. When skeletons of little children ranging in age from two months to seven years were found buried with one of the sacred virgins in 1183, Hermann Joseph, a Praemonstratensian canon at Steinfeld, explained that they were distant relatives of the eleven thousand. A surgeon of eminence was once banished from Cologne for suggesting that, among the collection of bones which are said to pertain to the heads, there were several belonging to full-grown mastiffs. The relics may have come from a forgotten burial ground. Parts of a skull attributed to St. Ursula were reportedly brought to Ireland in the early 1700s and is held at the Galway City Museum in Ireland.

===Official stance of the Roman Catholic Church===
Nothing reliable is known about the girls said to have been martyred at the spot. A commemoration of Saint Ursula and her companions in the Mass of Saint Hilarion, formerly in the General Roman Calendar on 21 October, was removed in 1969, because &quot;their &quot;Passio&quot; is entirely fabulous: nothing, not even their names, is known about the virgin saints who were killed at Cologne at some uncertain time&quot;. However, they are still mentioned in the Roman Martyrology, the official but professedly incomplete list of saints recognised by the Roman Catholic Church, which speaks of them as follows: &quot;At Cologne in Germany, commemoration of virgin saints who ended their life in martyrdom for Christ in the place where afterwards the city&#x27;s basilica was built, dedicated in honour of the innocent young girl Ursula who is looked on as their leader&quot;.

==Veneration==
===Roman Catholic order===
* The Order of Ursulines, founded in 1535 by Angela Merici, and devoted to the education of young girls, has also helped to spread Ursula&#x27;s name throughout the world. Ursula was named the patroness saint of school girls.

===Celebrations===
* The town of Binangonan in the province of Rizal in the Philippines also has a church dedicated to Saint Ursula, where her feast is celebrated on 21 October. A fluvial procession at Laguna Lake is carried out to commemorate Ursula&#x27;s journey. It is made up of a group of men and women in colourful, traditional Filipino costumes dancing in the streets with the image of Ursula and chanting joyfully. Prior to her feast day, a nine-day novena is held at the 224-year-old Santa Ursula Church. During this novena, a woman is assigned as cantor to sing a chant in honour of Ursula.
* The town of Valls, Catalonia, Spain, celebrates the &quot;&quot; in the days around 21 October. The fair concludes on the Sunday after 21 October with &quot;one of the most important&quot; castell (human tower) competitions.

===Church music and art===
* Hildegard of Bingen composed many chants in honour of Ursula.
* Catherine of Bologna is credited with painting one if not two images of St. Ursula.
* Michael Haydn wrote the &quot;Missa in honorem Sanctae Ursulae&quot; to commemorate the day Ursula Oswald joined a Benedictine Abbey.
* Hans Memling fashioned during the 1480s a wooden shrine that contained the relics of Ursula, which is now at the Hans Memling Museum in Bruges. It tells the story of Ursula in six bow-arched panels, with the two front panels showing Ursula accompanied by 10 virgins, each representing 1,000 virgins.
* There is also a painting by Caravaggio, &quot;The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula&quot; in the Gallaria d&#x27;Italia in Naples. His last known work.

===Places named after her companions===
* Christopher Columbus named the Virgin Islands in the Caribbean in her honour when sailing past them in 1493.
* Ferdinand Magellan rounded Cape Virgenes on 21 October 1520, and entered the Straits of Magellan, naming the cape after Ursula&#x27;s virgins. 
* João Álvares Fagundes, a Portuguese explorer, gave in 1521 the name &quot;Eleven Thousand Virgins&quot; to what is now known as Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.
* Basel, a Swiss city about 400 km south of Cologne, has tradition of Ursula and her companions passing through Basel intending to go to Rome. The legend gave name to the Eleven Thousand Virgins Alley (&quot;Elftausendjungfern-Gässlein&quot;), which climbs one side of the Münsterberg, a hill in the center of the city.

===UK and Anglican Church===
* The small village of Llangwyryfon, near Aberystwyth in west Wales, has a church dedicated to Ursula. The village name translates as &#x27;Church of the Virgins&#x27;.
* There are Anglican churches dedicated to Saint Ursula in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the United States and the Caribbean.
* The street in London called St Mary Axe is named after the Church of St Mary Axe, originally dedicated to Saint Mary the Virgin, Saint Ursula and the 11,000 virgins. It was demolished in the late 16th century; the site is located close to where the skyscraper informally known as &quot;The Gherkin&quot; now stands. A manuscript dated 1514 claims that the church contained a holy relic: an axe used by the Huns to execute the virgins.
* Whitelands College in Roehampton, London, the oldest educational institution of the Church of England, has been under the patronage of Saint Ursula since its formation. She is the patroness saint of the college&#x27;s chapel.

===Visions===
* It was recorded that Elizabeth of Schönau experienced a vision that revealed to her the martyrdom of Ursula and her companions.

==Cordula, Ursula&#x27;s companion==

Cordula was, according to a legend in an edition of the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot; presented in an English translation on a traditionalist Catholic website, one of Ursula&#x27;s companions: &quot;Being terrified by the punishments and slaughter of the others, Cordula hid herself, but repenting her deed, on the next day she declared herself to the Huns of her own accord, and thus was the last of them all to receive the crown of martyrdom&quot;. In his &quot;Albert the Great&quot;, Joachim Sighart recounts that, on 14 February 1277, while work was being done at the church of St John the Baptist (&quot;Johanniterkirche&quot;) in Cologne, Cordula&#x27;s body was discovered; it was fragrant and on her forehead was written: &quot;Cordula, Queen and Virgin&quot;. When Albert the Great heard of the finding, he sang mass and transferred the relics. Later, Cordula&#x27;s supposed remains were moved to Königswinter and Rimini. Cordula&#x27;s head was claimed by the Cathedral of Palencia. She is listed in the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot; on 22 October.

==Similarities with Sunniva==
There are striking parallels between the 11th-century legend of Ursula and the story of Sunniva of Selje. Their names were sometimes confused by contemporaries. Both saints were considered to be Christian princesses who fled their homeland by ship in order to postpone or avert an undesired marriage with a pagan king. Both were accompanied by a large group of associates, both became victims of hostile foes. The development of their legends may have been interdependent. The martyrdom of Sunniva, however, took place after the first draft of the &quot;Passio Ursulae&quot;.

<text>Pezcore is the debut full-length album released by the American ska punk band Less Than Jake through Dill Records.

==Release and legacy==
It was originally released on Dill Records in 1995 on CD and cassette.

The album reissued on Asian Man in 1996 on CD only, but was missing two tracks found on the Dill version (&quot;Jeffersons&quot; and &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot;).

In October 2002, Less Than Jake released a tenth anniversary version of &quot;Pezcore&quot; to celebrate the band&#x27;s 10 years of existence. Issued on Less Than Jake drummer Vinnie Fiorello&#x27;s Fueled by Ramen label, the recordings were remixed and remastered.

The band announced on January 5, 2008 that another reissue of &quot;Pezcore&quot; would be released on the band&#x27;s label, Sleep It Off Records. The record was re-released on March 18, 2008 accompanied with a live DVD.

*The story behind &quot;Johnny Quest Thinks We&#x27;re Sellouts&quot;: &quot;Ha. Well, he&#x27;s a friend of mine I&#x27;ve known since elementary school. He&#x27;s an architect student at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, Florida, where we&#x27;re from. And we played this show in town, it was a battle of the bands and we won, and we got to play at the great opening of this record store, and this guy wrote in his work office at the Architect School, &quot;Less Than Jake are sellouts&quot;. And as for the name Johnny Quest, that was his moniker, his nickname, he never heard us before or anything. He just wrote it just because. So we just shrugged our shoulders and decided to write a silly song about it.&quot; -Chris

<doc id="588126" wikidata="Q703378" url="?curid=588126" title="German Autumn">
<text>The German Autumn () refers to the period and political atmosphere in the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) during September and October 1977. This period was marked by a series of attacks by the Red Army Faction (RAF), a far-left militant group designated as a terrorist organization by the West German government. The German Autumn included the kidnapping and murder of German industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer, the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181, and the suicides of the imprisoned leading members of the first generation of the RAF. These events represented the final act of the RAF&#x27;s so-called &quot;Offensive 77&quot;. The German Autumn is considered one of the most serious crises in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The term &quot;German Autumn&quot; is derived from the 1978 film &quot;&quot; (&quot;Germany in Autumn&quot;), a collage of several documentaries by eleven directors of the &quot;New German Cinema.&quot; The film critically examines the state&#x27;s reaction to terrorism from different perspectives.

==Events in the spring and summer of 1977==
In 1977, the activities of the so-called second generation of the RAF reached their peak. However, the events before September are generally not considered to be part of the German Autumn.

===Siegfried Buback killing===

On 7 April 1977, the Federal Prosecutor General Siegfried Buback, his driver Wolfgang Göbel, and the head of the Federal Prosecutor&#x27;s Office&#x27;s motor pool, Georg Wurster, were shot dead in their car by the RAF&#x27;s &quot;Ulrike Meinhof Commando&quot; (&quot;Kommando Ulrike Meinhof&quot;) from a motorcycle in Karlsruhe.

===Jürgen Ponto killing===

On 30 July 1977, Jürgen Ponto, the spokesman for the board of Dresdner Bank AG, was murdered in a failed kidnapping attempt. RAF member Susanne Albrecht, who knew Ponto personally, visited him accompanied by Brigitte Mohnhaupt and Christian Klar. Unaware of Albrecht&#x27;s political radicalization, Ponto received her unsuspectingly at his private home on &quot;Oberhöchstadter Strasse&quot; in Oberursel. When Ponto resisted the kidnapping, Klar and Mohnhaupt shot him several times, fatally wounding him. The three then fled in the getaway car driven by Peter-Jürgen Boock, which was waiting in front of Pontos&#x27; villa.

On 25 August 1977, an attack on the Federal Prosecutor&#x27;s Office building in Karlsruhe failed.

==Course of autumn 1977==
===Hanns-Martin Schleyer kidnapping===

On 5 September 1977, the President of the Confederation of German Employers&#x27; Associations (&quot;Bundesvereinigung der Deutschen Arbeitgeberverbände&quot;, BDA) and the Federation of German Industries (&quot;Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie&quot;, BDI), Hanns Martin Schleyer, was kidnapped in Cologne. His driver and three police officers were murdered. The kidnappers demanded the release of eleven imprisoned RAF terrorists.

===Lufthansa &quot;Landshut&quot; hijacking===

As the German government did not give in to the blackmail—unlike with the kidnapping of Peter Lorenz two years earlier—terrorists from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), allied with the Red Army Faction (RAF), tried to increase the pressure by hijacking the Lufthansa plane &quot;Landshut&quot; on 13 October 1977. After an odyssey through the Middle East and the murder of the pilot, Captain Jürgen Schumann, the plane landed at Mogadishu International Airport, the capital of Somalia. Here, the &quot;Landshut&quot; was stormed by the West German counter-terrorism unit GSG 9 on 18 October at around 00:05 Central European Time (CET). Later that morning, a special report on Deutschlandfunk announced that &quot;all hostages have been freed. We do not yet know whether there were any dead or injured among them...&quot; All 87 hostages were rescued, including four of the five crew members. Three of the hijackers were killed and one hijacker was seriously wounded.

===Night of death in Stammheim Prison===
Shortly afterward, in the early morning hours of 18 October 1977, known as the &quot;Night of death in Stammheim&quot;, RAF members Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, who were imprisoned in Stuttgart-Stammheim supermax prison, reportedly took their own lives. Irmgard Möller, who was also imprisoned there, survived an alleged suicide attempt, sustaining multiple stab wounds to her chest. The kidnapped Hanns Martin Schleyer was subsequently murdered by his captors. His body was found on the evening of 19 October in the trunk of a green Audi 100 GL, parked on a side street in Mulhouse, Alsace, France, close to the German and Swiss border.

==Political reaction==
===Political divides===
During the German Autumn, West German political parties engaged in heated arguments. The opposition, comprising the center-right Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU), suspected that the ruling social-liberal coalition of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) under Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt (SPD) was ideologically close to the terrorists. In response, the coalition accused the opposition of hysterical overreactions and of attempting to transform the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) into a police state.

===Policy agreements===
Despite these differences, at the beginning of the Schleyer kidnapping, Chancellor Schmidt convened the so-called Great Crisis Committee (&quot;Großer Krisenstab&quot;), which included members of all parliamentary groups in the West German Bundestag. Historian Wolfgang Kraushaar later described this period as an &quot;undeclared state of emergency&quot; (state of exception). One result of the cross-party consensus was the &quot;Contact Ban Act&quot; (&quot;Kontaktsperre&quot;) passed in the autumn of 1977, which allowed for a contact ban for prisoners, including discussions with lawyers. SPD politician and lawyer Hubert Weber welcomed this act, stating that &quot;The Federal Republic is not in a state of emergency,&quot; and thus it was wrong for the courts to strain the legal definition of an emergency. Additionally, the Code of Criminal Procedure (&quot;Strafprozessordnung&quot;) was amended to limit defendants to appoint a maximum of three defense attorneys.

<text>Salomon (also known as Selyf, Selevan) was a late 5th century Cornish &#x27;warrior prince&#x27;, possibly a King of Cornwall. His feast day takes place on the 18 October. He was the father of the Cornish bishop Saint Cybi.

==Narrative==
According to Sabine Baring-Gould, Salomon was the son of Geraint ab Erbin, Prince of Dumnonia. This agrees with the &quot;Bonedd y Saint&quot;, a Welsh genealogical tract detailing the lineages of the early British saints. Salomon married Gwen ferch Cynyr, the daughter of Cynyr Ceinfarfog who had settled at Caer-Goch near St David&#x27;s in Pembrokeshire. Gwen ferch Cynyr was the sister of Saint Non. 

According to the &quot;Life of St Cybi&quot;, Selevan, (a Brythonic form of Solomon) was a Cornishman and the father of Cybi. Salomon is described as a &quot;princeps militiae&quot; at a court between the River Tamar and the River Lynher, possibly Gelliwig. Welsh historian Arthur Wade-Evans interpreted this title as &#x27;captain of the guard&#x27;, while others believe he was a sub-king of Cornwall. David Nash Ford suggests that he succeeded to the realm of his cousin, King Mark.

Lansallos is a foundation of Salomon. Baring-Gould mentions a holy well of his sister-in-law, Non, and a church of his son, Cybi, in the area between Roseland and Grampound. 

Salomon is identified with Selevan, of St Levan in Cornwall and Penmon on Anglesey. On the cliff at St Levan is St Levan&#x27;s Well and below it the probable remains of his chapel, which were described by William Borlase in his &quot;Antiquities&quot;. The &quot;Selus stone&quot; at St Just in Penwith Parish Church is thought to refer to Salomon. The identity of Saint Just is not known. Among the possibilities mentioned is the Welsh hermit, Saint Iestyn, said to be a son of Geraint ab Erbin.

In the department of Morbihan in Brittany are four places connected to a Saint Saloman. Baring-Gould suggests this is a second, separate individual.

<text>A wayport is a major airport, built on the outskirts of or away from an urban area, having the primary purpose of serving connecting and origin destination flights, cargo, express mail and general aviation as part of the national airport network. Wayports have been proposed as a potential solution in the United States to deal with increasing congestion and delays at major urban airports.
No wayports have been built, but the idea is being considered by the Federal Aviation Administration as it reviews future needs of the air transportation network in the United States. Due to the high number of connecting passengers, cargo and express mail using city airports which are neither the passengers&#x27; origin nor destination, wayports could offload some of this demand by funneling these passengers through facilities designed expressly for this purpose, allowing city airports to deal primarily with passengers originating or terminating their travel at that location. This would increase city airport capacity without new construction.

For example, Pittsburgh International Airport is an existing major airport that is currently vastly underused on account of the loss of US Airways hub status in the early 2000s. Its fully modern air traffic control and ground operations capabilities, in conjunction with its three parallel runways, give it the ability to easily handle a high number of aircraft operations per hour, even in poor weather conditions. Estimates indicate that only 15% of the airport&#x27;s capacity is being utilized, and therefore the airport has been proposed as a wayport for lessening the tremendous load on congested and delay-prone airspace around Philadelphia International Airport and the New York City airports (Newark, JFK, and LaGuardia).

The concept of wayports has existed for over twenty years but has been touted by former FAA officials James Sheppard and William Shea as an answer for future air system development.

<text>The Asian openbill or Asian openbill stork (Anastomus oscitans) is a large wading bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. This distinctive stork is found mainly in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is greyish or white with glossy black wings and tail. Adults have a gap between the arched upper mandible and recurved lower mandible which is thought to be an adaptation that aids in the handling of snails, their main prey. Young birds are born without this gap. Although resident within their range, they make long distance movements in response to weather and food availability.

==Taxonomy==

The Asian openbill was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; from a specimen collected in Pondichery, India. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea oscitans&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The Asian openbill is now placed in the genus &quot;Anastomus&quot; that was erected by the French naturalist Pierre Bonnaterre in 1791. The genus name &quot;Anastomus&quot; is from the Ancient Greek αναστομοω &quot;anastomoō&quot; meaning &quot;to furnish with a mouth&quot; or &quot;with mouth wide-opened&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;oscitans&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;yawning&quot;.

==Description==

The Asian openbill stork is predominantly greyish (non-breeding season) or white (breeding season) with glossy black wings and tail that have a green or purple sheen. The name is derived from the distinctive gap formed between the recurved lower and arched upper mandible of the beak in adult birds. Young birds do not have this gap. The cutting edges of the mandible have a fine brush like structure that is thought to give them better grip on the shells of snails. The tail consists of twelve feathers and the preen gland has a tuft. The mantle is black and the bill is horn-grey. At a distance, they can appear somewhat like a white stork or Oriental stork. The short legs are pinkish to grey, reddish prior to breeding. Non-breeding birds have a smoky grey wings and back instead of white. Young birds are brownish-grey and have a brownish mantle. Like other storks, the Asian openbill is a broad-winged soaring bird, which relies on moving between thermals of hot air for sustained flight. They are usually found in flocks but single birds are not uncommon. Like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched. It is relatively small for a stork and stands at 68 cm height (81 cm long).
==Habitat and distribution==
The usual foraging habitats are inland wetlands and are only rarely seen along river banks and tidal flats. On agricultural landscapes, birds forage in crop fields, irrigation canals, and in seasonal marshes. Birds may move widely in response to habitat conditions. Young birds also disperse widely after fledging. Individuals ringed at Bharatpur in India have been recovered 800 km east and a bird ringed in Thailand has been recovered 1500 km west in Bangladesh. Storks are regularly disoriented by lighthouses along the southeast coast of India on overcast nights between August and September. The species is very rare in the Sind and Punjab regions of Pakistan, but widespread and common in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia. It has recently expanded its range into southwestern China. In Thirunavaya Lotus Lake Wetland Malappuram district of Kerala state in India, they are mostly seen in the months of September–February season

Asian Openbills appear to be susceptible to dying during hailstorms. In Xishuangbanna, in south China, 45 Asian Openbills were counted dead after a hailstorm, but carcasses of other bird species were not seen.
==Food and foraging==

During the warmer part of the day, Asian openbills soar on thermals and have a habit of descending rapidly into their feeding areas. Groups may forage together in close proximity in shallow water or marshy ground on which they may walk with a slow and steady gait. The Asian openbill feeds mainly on large molluscs, especially &quot;Pila&quot; species, and they separate the shell from the body of the snail using the tip of the beak. The tip of the lower mandible of the beak is often twisted to the right. This tip is inserted into the opening of the snail and the body is extracted with the bill still under water. Jerdon noted that they were able to capture snails even when blindfolded. The exact action being difficult to see, led to considerable speculation on the method used. Sir Julian Huxley examined the evidence from specimens and literature and came to the conclusion that the bill gap was used like a nutcracker. He held the rough edges of the bill as being the result of wear and tear from such actions. Subsequent studies have dismissed this idea and the rough edge of the bill has been suggested as being an adaptation to help handle hard and slippery shells. They forage for prey by holding their bill tips slightly apart and make rapid vertical jabs in shallow water often with the head and neck partially submerged. The gap in the bill is not used for handling snail shells and forms only with age. Young birds that lack a gap are still able to forage on snails. It has been suggested that the gap allows the tips to strike at a greater angle to increases the force that the tips can apply on snail shells. Smaller snails are often swallowed whole or crushed. At one location in Thailand, Asian Openbills discarded the male’s testes and female’s albumen glands of &quot;Pomacea canaliculata.&quot; They also feed on water snakes, frogs and large insects. When foraging on agricultural landscapes with a variety of habitats, Asian openbills preferentially use natural marshes and lakes (especially in the monsoon and winter), and irrigation canals (especially in the summer) as foraging habitat.

==Breeding==

The breeding season is after the rains, during July to September in northern India and Nepal, and November to March in southern India and Sri Lanka. They may skip breeding in drought years. The Asian openbill breeds colonially, building a rough platform of sticks often on half-submerged trees (often &quot;Barringtonia&quot;, &quot;Avicennia&quot; and &quot;Acacia&quot; species), typically laying two to four eggs. The nesting trees are either shared with those of egrets, cormorants and darters, or can be single-species colonies like in lowland Nepal. Nesting colonies are sometimes in highly disturbed areas such as inside villages and on trees located in crop fields. Colonies are also found in small cities such as Udaipur in Rajassthan, India, which has several large artificial wetlands within the city limits. In lowland Nepal, 13 colonies found in an agricultural landscape had an average colony size of 52, ranging from 5 nests to 130 nests. The majority of these colonies were located on &quot;Bombax ceiba&quot; trees, with much fewer located on &quot;Ficus religiosa&quot; and &quot;Dalbergia sissoo&quot; tree species. Asian openbills preferred trees that were much taller and bigger than trees that were available on the landscape, and selectively used wild and native tree species entirely avoiding species that were important for resources such as fruits (e.g. &quot;Mangifera indica&quot;) despite such trees being much more common. Religious beliefs have secured important trees such as &quot;Ficus&quot; species, and agro-forestry has secured the most preferred species, &quot;Bombax ceiba&quot;, that Asian openbills prefer to locate colonies in lowland Nepal. The nests are close to each other leading to considerable aggressive interactions between birds on neighbouring nests. Both parents take turns in incubation, the eggs hatching after about 25 days. The chicks emerge with cream coloured down and are shaded by the loosely outspread and drooped wings of a parent.
Initiation of nests in lowland Nepal was highly synchronized, with colonies started during July and August. Breeding success at nests in these colonies was impacted by proximity of colonies to human habitation, and the progression of the breeding season. Colonies closer to human habitation had lower success, and colonies initiated later during the breeding season (when flooding of the rice fields had reduced to allow ripening of the crop) had lower success. Number of chicks that fledged from colonies located on trees in agricultural landscapes in lowland Nepal were similar to that observed in a protected, mangrove reserve in eastern India suggesting that agricultural areas are not always detrimental to large waterbirds such as Asian openbills.

Nesting openbills in Nepal took an average of 27 minutes to return to nests with food for nestlings and fledglings. The time taken to find food was most impacted by the location of wetlands around colonies, and the progression of the breeding season. Adults look the least time to return with food earlier in the season when the dominant rice crop was most flooded, and time increased as the rice ripened along with the drying out of the fields. Adult birds in Nepal provisioned chicks at nest with snails of the genus &quot;Filopaludina&quot; and &quot;Pila.&quot; Hatchlings received 87-120 g/day of food, while older nestlings received 272-386 g/day of food.

Like other storks, they are silent except for clattering produced by the striking of the male&#x27;s bill against that of the female during copulation. They also produce low honking notes accompanied by up and down movements of the bill when greeting a partner arriving at the nest. Males may sometimes form polygynous associations, typically with two females which may lay their eggs in the same nest.

==Relationship with other organisms==
Young birds at the nest are sometimes preyed on by imperial, steppe and greater spotted eagles. &quot;Chaunocephalus ferox&quot;, an intestinal parasite, is a trematode worm found in about 80% of the wild populations in Thailand while another species &quot;Echinoparyphium oscitansi&quot; has been described from Asian openbills in Thailand. Other helminth parasites such as &quot;Thapariella anastomusa&quot;, &quot;T. oesophagiala&quot; and &quot;T. udaipurensis&quot; have been described from the oesophagus of storks. The tick &quot;Argas (Persicargas) robertsi&quot;, commonly seen on domestic fowl, has been recovered from nesting Asian Openbills. 

In colonial India, sportsmen shot the openbill for meat, calling it the &quot;beef-steak bird&quot; (although this name was also used for the woolly-necked stork).

<text>The openbill storks or openbills are two species of stork (family Ciconiidae) in the genus Anastomus. They are large wading birds characterized by large bills, the mandibles of which do not meet except at the tip. This feature develops only in the adults. Both species feed predominantly on molluscs. The roof of the upper bill is fringed with plate-like structures (&quot;lamellae&quot;) in the African openbill, but these are absent in the Asian openbill.
==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Anastomus&quot; was erected by the French naturalist Pierre Bonnaterre in 1791. The type species was subsequently designated as the Asian openbill (&quot;Anastomus oscitans&quot;). The name &quot;Anastomus&quot; is from the Ancient Greek αναστομοω &quot;anastomoō&quot; meaning &quot;to furnish with a mouth&quot; or &quot;with mouth wide-opened&quot;.

There are two species of openbilled storks:

<text>(45) Eugenia I Petit-Prince is the larger, outer moon of asteroid 45 Eugenia. It was discovered in 1998 by astronomers at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Initially, it received the provisional designation S/1998 (45) 1. Petit-Prince was the first asteroid moon to be discovered with a ground-based telescope. Previously, the only known moon of an asteroid was Dactyl, discovered by the Galileo space probe, around 243 Ida.

==Characteristics==
Petit-Prince is 13 km in diameter, compared to 45 Eugenia&#x27;s 214 km. It takes five days to complete an orbit around Eugenia.

==Name==
The discoverers chose the name in honour of Empress Eugénie&#x27;s son, the Prince Imperial. However, they also intended an allusion to the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Little Prince&quot; by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, which is about a prince who lives on an asteroid.

In their submission of the name to the IAU, the discovers justified the double meaning by arguing for similarities between the Prince Imperial and the Little Prince:
:&quot;Both princes were young and adventurous, and had little fear of danger. Both were of rather small stature. They both left the confines of their cozy little worlds (asteroid B612 for the Little Prince and Chislehurst for the Prince Imperial). They both then undertook long journeys to end up in Africa, whereupon they both meet rather violent deaths ... And in both cases, they lay alone for one night each after &quot;death&quot; and then &quot;returned&quot; back home...&quot;

<doc id="588158" wikidata="Q4922543" url="?curid=588158" title="Blackballing">
<text>Blackballing is a rejection in a traditional form of secret ballot, where a white ball or ballot constitutes a vote in support and a black ball signifies opposition. The system is commonly used where an organization&#x27;s rules provide that one or two objections, rather than a percentage of the vote (for example, more than 50%), are sufficient to defeat a proposition. Since the seventeenth century, these rules have commonly applied to elections to membership of many gentlemen&#x27;s clubs and similar institutions such as Masonic lodges and fraternities.

The principle of such election rules in a club is that it tends to preserve the current ethos of the club by ensuring that candidates are congenial to (almost) all the existing members. As a public difference of opinions could be divisive, the election is secret. 

In America, members of fraternal clubs often voted at their meetings without paper ballots as early as the 17th century. In order to progress, votes had to be unanimous in nature, as a single vote against was enough to apply veto. A blackball box was used instead of paper ballots for this reason.

==Process==
A large supply of black and white balls is provided for voters. Each voter audibly casts a single ball into the ballot box under cover of the box, or of a combination of a cloth and the box itself, so that observers can see who votes but not how they are voting. When all voting is complete, the box is opened and the balls displayed: all present can immediately see the result, without any means of knowing which members are objecting.

The number of votes in support is often irrelevant, except to prove a quorum. Whilst in many such cases even a single black ball will be fatal to the election, rules in larger clubs ensure that a single member cannot exercise a veto to the detriment of the future of the club. For example, two black balls are required to exclude; a limited category or committee of members vote, rather than all members; or in the event of a blackball, the election may be repeated immediately to ensure that there is no mistake, or after a fixed period to allow further information or opinions to be discussed discreetly. A variant sometimes used is that all incoming candidates are voted on as a group; if the group as a whole is blackballed, then each member must be voted on individually.

The practice also found popularity in areas outside of social clubs. In the Soviet Union, dissertation panels would typically cast their vote on a thesis defense using this system.

&quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; notes that the use of black and white balls can be ordered by passing an incidental motion to that effect. The manual notes, &quot;This custom, however, is apparently declining.&quot;

The term still remains in use for many different electoral systems which have applied from club to club and from time to time: for example, instead of differently coloured balls, ballot-balls may be dropped into separate &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; drawers inside the ballot box.

In some Masons&#x27; lodges, a black cube is used instead of a black ball.

==An example ==
The following example from the rules of election to the Travellers Club, which is quoted from &quot;Dickens&#x27;s Dictionary of London&quot; (1879), provides an illustration of the principle:

<text>The Blohm &amp; Voss Ha 139 was a four-engined all-metal inverted gull wing floatplane designed and built by the German aircraft manufacturer Blohm &amp; Voss. At the time of the first aircraft&#x27;s completion, it was one of the largest float-equipped seaplanes to have been built.

Development of the Ha 139 started in 1935 to fulfil a specification issued by the German flag carrier &quot;Deutsche Luft Hansa&quot;. Built to serve on the airline&#x27;s long distance routes, it was equipped with four hydraulically-actuated landing flaps, was powered by four Junkers Jumo 205C diesel engines, and was suitable for catapult-assisted takeoffs. The Ha 139A was promptly followed by the Ha 139B, a variant that possessed greater size and weight. Continued development of the aircraft led to a land-based version, the Blohm &amp; Voss BV 142, while a proposed reconnaissance/bomber variant of the Ha 139 for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was never realised.

During October 1936, Ha 139 V1, the first aircraft, performed its maiden flight. Between 1937 and 1939, the type was flown by &quot;Deutsche Luft Hansa&quot; on various transatlantic routes, predominantly in the South Atlantic. Such flights ceased following the start of the Second World War; instead, the aircraft were adopted by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and used for military purposes during the conflict. Its service life was cut short by a lack of components, no aircraft survived the conflict.

==Design and development==
During the early 1930s, the Blohm &amp; Voss shipbuilding company in Hamburg was suffering financial hardship due to a prolonged downturn in orders amid the Great Depression affecting global demand; company officials opted to diversify via the creation of a new subsidiary company, Hamburger Flugzeugbau, which specialised in the design and manufacture aircraft. This new company quickly set about the development of its first flying boat, the tri-engined Blohm &amp; Voss BV 138 Seedrache; the project was considered a natural fit for the firm, being owned by a shipbuilding company meant that many staff already had good knowledge of the maritime environment and suitable construction practices thereof, while the company&#x27;s main complex was sited on the Elbe, permitting direct access to a large body of water.

During 1935, the firm, having been satisfied with the progress of the Seedrache, decided to embark on design work for a larger four-engined floatplane. From any early stage of development, the prospective against was intended for civilian use by the German flag carrier &quot;Deutsche Luft Hansa&quot;; the airline&#x27;s requirements included the carriage of a payload over a staged route at a cruising speed of 250 kmph. The aircraft was also to possess a durable structure and possess favouring handling characteristics (such as being able to takeoff and alight on rough seas) while also being suitable for catapult-assisted takeoffs.

To meet these requirements, the design team produced a low-wing monoplane powered by four Junkers Jumo 205C diesel engines and equipped with pylon-mounted floats, designated &quot;Ha 139&quot;. The inboard engines were mounted at the joint between the inboard anhedral and outboard dihedral wing sections above the floats. The parallel-chord inverted gull wing featured a main spar composed of large-diameter steel tubing; this tubular spar also functioned as a fuel tank. This wing, which had a mixed covering made of both metal (in the centre) and fabric (on the outer panels), was equipped with four hydraulically-actuated landing flaps. The all-metal single-step floats were attached to the were attached to the wings via a steel stub that was surrounded by a metal fairing that housed a radiator. The fuselage had a circular cross-section and featured metal monocoque construction. It had a stepped cockpit that was typically occupied by a crew of four, including a pair of pilots, during lengthy flights.

Shortly after testing of the Ha 139 commenced in 1937, Blohm &amp; Voss started work on a land-based derivative that would be designated BV 142. From the onset, this derivative was to incorporate as much of the design and components of the Ha 139 as realistically possible. While originally intended for civil use, it would ultimately see use by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during the war.

==Operational history==

During March 1937, &quot;Deutsche Luft Hansa&quot; received the first aircraft, Ha 139 V1; shortly thereafter, the airline commenced trials in the North Atlantic between the Azores and New York using both V1 and V2 and a pair of seaplane depot ships. During these flights, the aircraft routinely achieved average cruising speed just shy of the specification, however, the discovery of several faults led to the trials being temporarily halted in November 1937 while remedial work was undertaken. These modifications included replacement rudders and fins with counterparts possessing greater surface area (to counteract directional instability) and the elimination of all inner-engine radiators in favour of an underwing arrangement.

In July 1938, a new round of trials commenced; this rounded included the first Ha 139B aircraft, which possessed increased dimensions and weight as well as lower-mounted engines. Following the successful completion of trials, regular service commenced during the closing months of 1938. The type was flown by &quot;Deutsche Luft Hansa&quot; on various transatlantic routes, predominantly in the South Atlantic between Bathurst, The Gambia and Natal, Brazil. When catapult-launched from an aircraft tender, a Ha 139 was capable of transporting up to of airmail over a distance of up to .

Shortly following the outbreak of the Second World War, all three aircraft were transferred to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; for military service. In accordance with this change in use, their appearance was altered and modifications made to enable them to perform reconnaissance and minesweeping operations. The included the addition of an elongated and extensively glazed nose to accommodate an observer while a degaussing loop was installed around the aircraft and field-generating apparatus was installed within the fuselage.

Introduced to service during the Norwegian campaign, the militarised Ha 139s were typically used to perform transport (of both troops and freight), reconnaissance and minesweeping sorties over the Baltic Sea. The Ha 139 did not have a lengthy military service, in large part due to a lack of spare components. Proposals to produce a reconnaissance/bomber variant of the aircraft were formulated but never put into action.

==Variants==
;Projekt 15
:Catapult launched floatplane mail-carrier design for Deutsche Lufthansa (DLH), became the Ha 139.

;Projekt 20
:A reconnaissance-bomber derivative of Projekt 15 submitted to the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) (German air Ministry) which generated little interest.

;Ha 139 V1
:&quot;D-AMIE&quot;, named &quot;Nordmeer&quot; — First of two initial prototypes.

;Ha 139 V2
:&quot;D-AJEY&quot;, named &quot;Nordwind&quot; — Second of two initial prototypes.

;Ha 139 V3
:&quot;D-ASTA&quot;, named &quot;Nordstern&quot; — Third prototype with longer wingspan, increased wing area and modified engine mounts.

;Ha 139B
:The Ha 139 V3 was given new triangular fins, and re-designated while in service with DLH.

;Ha 139B/Umbau
:After service with DLH, the Ha 139B was modified as the Ha 139B/Umbau with an extended glazed nose accommodating a navigator and a spherical Ikaria mount for a machine-gun. Additional machine guns were mounted in the cockpit roof hatch and in lateral mountings on either side of the rear fuselage.

;Ha 139B/MS
:The Ha 139B/Umbau was later modified into a minesweeper &quot;(Minensuch)&quot; with a magnetic cable loosely run between the nose, wing-tips, and tail.

<doc id="588165" wikidata="Q7872242" url="?curid=588165" title="USS New Orleans (LPH-11)">
<text>USS &quot;New Orleans&quot; (LPH-11) was an &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;-class amphibious assault ship in the United States Navy. She was the third Navy ship to be so named, and is the first named for the Battle of New Orleans, which was the last major battle of the War of 1812.

&quot;New Orleans&quot; was laid down on 1 March 1966 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was launched on 3 February 1968 and sponsored by Mrs. Arthur A. De la Houssaye. She was commissioned on 16 November 1968.

==1960s and 1970s==
&quot;New Orleans&quot; made her first appearance in the Western Pacific in August 1969 as flagship for Amphibious Ready Group Bravo. Her embarked Marine helicopter squadron and battalion leading team were ready to be landed within hours. In October, she hosted the Eighth Vietnamese Awards. Later that month, she participated in Operation Keystone Cardinal, a retrograde movement of Marines out of South Vietnam. The ship&#x27;s first deployment terminated in March 1970. After having participated in five amphibious exercises, conducted many weeks of Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) maneuvers in the South China Sea, and visiting such ports as Hong Kong, Manila, Subic Bay, Okinawa, and Taipei, &quot;New Orleans&quot; returned to San Diego.

Two other interesting assignments were given to &quot;New Orleans&quot; prior to her next Western Pacific deployment. In August 1970, she became flagship for Commander First Fleet and provided support for president Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and made a port call to Acapulco. Then, in late 1970, she prepared for the recovery of Apollo 14. On 9 February 1971, she picked up astronauts Alan Shepard, Stuart Roosa, and Edgar Mitchell some south of American Samoa.

In May 1971, &quot;New Orleans&quot; made her second Western Pacific appearance, conducting various contingency exercises, a multi-national cruising exercise simulating a convoy under combat conditions, and a simulated assault with the Marines on the island of Mindoro, Republic of the Philippines. This deployment was completed in November of that same year.
Following a rather extensive yard period, &quot;New Orleans&quot; began her next Western Pacific deployment on 17 July 1972. She became flagship for Amphibious Squadron Three and later Amphibious Ready Group Alfa. During late July and early August, &quot;New Orleans&quot; and her embarked units participated in the Philippine flood relief operations, earning the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation.

The helicopter carrier became engaged in contingency operations again with the ready group off the coast of Vietnam until early February 1973, at which time she became the flagship for Commander Task Force 78 and the control ship for Operation End Sweep. CTF 78, headed by Rear Admiral Brian McCauley, was tasked with de-mining operations for the coast and harbors of North Vietnam. She ceased operations in Haiphong Harbor on 17 April 1973.

&quot;New Orleans&quot; next participated in recovery operations for the final two crewed Skylab missions: Skylab 3 on 25 September 1973, and the Skylab 4 mission on 8 February 1974. She was also present for the recovery of astronauts Thomas Stafford, Deke Slayton, and Vance Brand during the joint American–Soviet Apollo–Soyuz mission of 24 July 1975. That was the last splashdown of an American crewed spacecraft in the 20th century as NASA would go on to use the Space Shuttle, which landed like an airplane on land-based runways.

==1980s==

In 1980, the ship deployed and spent several months in the Indian Ocean during the Iran hostage crisis. She completed a major overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in 1981. Deployments and exercises in 1982 and 1983 included RIMPAC &#x27;82, Exercise Kernel Usher &#x27;83-1, Operation Team Spirit 83, and WESTPAC &#x27;83. From May to December 1984, &quot;New Orleans&quot; sailed the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific, participating in eight major amphibious operations. These included Operation Beach Guard, Operation Cobra Gold &amp; Operation Valiant Usher and was honored as the first US ship to land troops ashore at the island of Iwo Jima since WWII as well as troops at Inchon, Korea since the Korean War. While on WESTPAC in 1986, she served in an alert status off the Philippine coast during that country&#x27;s national elections. She also served as the medical and communications support ship for president Ronald Reagan&#x27;s trip to Bali, Indonesia.

Upon her return to home port, &quot;New Orleans&quot; participated in two major exercises leading to her thirteenth deployment to the Western Pacific. During this time, she participated in four amphibious exercises, including Cobra Gold &#x27;88, Valiant Usher &#x27;89-1, and Valiant Blitz &#x27;89-1. The ship called on the port of Perth, Australia, during that country&#x27;s bicentennial. In 1989, she made port visits to Mazatlán (Mexico) and Seattle, Washington, for the Seattle Sea Fair. She also conducted a humanitarian relief effort in Cabo San Lucas (Mexico).

==1990s==

Following completion of a phased maintenance availability in January 1990, &quot;New Orleans&quot; sailed the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Persian Gulf in support of Operations Desert Storm, Desert Saber and Desert Shield from 1 December 1990 to 28 August 1991. She served as a member of CTG-36/CTF-156, the largest amphibious task force to deploy from the West Coast of the United States in 25 years. Significant accomplishments included the off-load of 1,700 Marine combat troops on G-Day and aviation mine countermeasures in the North Persian Gulf, ten nautical miles (19 km) off the coast of Kuwait.

In November 1991, &quot;New Orleans&quot; returned to San Diego for a six-month overhaul. In October 1992, she hosted festivities at Fleet Week &#x27;92 in San Francisco. After returning to San Diego, she was the first LPH to go through Afloat Training Group Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Tailored Ship&#x27;s Training Availability&quot; and was instrumental in developing a training track for LPH-class ships. In September 1993, &quot;New Orleans&quot; deployed on her fifteenth WESTPAC cruise where she participated in Exercise Valiant Usher &#x27;93 and was a member of the Amphibious Ready Group that conducted operations in support of Operation Restore Hope at Mogadishu, Somalia. New Orleans became part of Naval Battle Force, Somalia, under Rear Admiral Arthur K. Cebrowski, in October–November 1993. Other elements of the force included USS America, USS Simpson, USS Cayuga (LST-1186), USS Denver (LPD 9), USS Comstock (LSD 45), and the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit. New Orleans received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and a Meritorious Unit Commendation for Somalia related operations from 18 October 1993 to 1 February 1994.[3]

&quot;New Orleans&quot; next sailed onto the movie screen in November 1994 when astronaut Captain Jim Lovell, USN, director Ron Howard, and actors Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton came aboard to film several portions of the Oscar-winning film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. She portrayed the then-decommissioned USS &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;, one of her sister ships.

June 1995 saw &quot;New Orleans&quot; underway again for WESTPAC operations. She was present to support the Marine raid on the Al Hamra Facility on 24 October of that year. She returned to San Diego on 22 December 1995, after embarking 198 Sea Scouts as part of a &quot;Tiger Cruise&quot; during the last leg of her journey from Pearl Harbor to San Diego. The ship got underway again on 31 January 1997, for another WESTPAC cruise which included boarding the Marines from the 31st MEU(SOC) based out of Okinawa, Japan and participating in Operation Tandem Thrust &#x27;97 in Townsville, Australia in which it weathered Cyclone Justin before returning to port on 2 May.

==Fate==
&quot;New Orleans&quot; was decommissioned and placed in reserve in San Diego, California, in October 1997. She was the recipient of the Navy Unit Commendation, four Battle Efficiency Awards, the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the Navy Expeditionary Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Southwest Asia Campaign Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the Kuwait Liberation Medal. She was mothballed in Suisun Bay, California at 38° 4&#x27;37.86&quot;N, 122° 5&#x27;24.66&quot;W from 1997 until 2006 while a group tried to save her as a museum in Long Beach, California.

In 2006, the ship was relocated to Pearl Harbor to be prepared for a &#x27;SINKEX&#x27;. In February 2008, &quot;New Orleans&quot; was listed for scrapping, instead of sinking, however, as of June 2010, &quot;New Orleans&quot; was once again scheduled to be sunk. Finally, &quot;New Orleans&quot; was sunk on 10 July 2010 during the RIMPAC 2010 exercise. The ship first sustained direct hits by at least seven Harpoon missiles. After the Harpoon strikes, B-52s from 2d Bomb Wing and 5th Bomb Wing dropped five 2000-pound GBU-10 precision bombs. As the ship began to list, a joint force of the five participating nations – United States, Japan, Australia, Canada and France – struck the ship with the majority hitting above the water line.

<text>SM EVM (СМ ЭВМ, abbreviation of Система Малых ЭВМ—literally System of Mini Computers) are several types of Soviet and Comecon minicomputers produced from 1975 through the 1980s.

Most types of SM EVM are clones of DEC PDP-11 and VAX. SM-1 and SM-2 are clones of Hewlett-Packard minicomputers.

The common operating systems for the PDP-11 clones are translated versions of RSX-11 (ОС РВ) for the higher spec models and RT-11 (РАФОС, ФОДОС) for lower spec models. Also available for the high-end PDP-11 clones is MOS, a clone of UNIX.

<text>Dragon Hill is a small hillock immediately below the Uffington White Horse on the border of the civil parishes of Uffington and Woolstone in the English county of Oxfordshire. In 1974 it was transferred from Berkshire.

Dragon Hill is a natural chalk hill with an artificially flattened top (on the scarp slope of White Horse Hill); according to legend, Saint George slew the dragon here. A bare patch of chalk upon which no grass will grow is purported to be where the dragon&#x27;s blood spilled. It has been suggested as some sort of Iron Age ritual site associated with the nearby hill figure.

It is part of the White Horse group of monuments in the care of the National Trust, and a Scheduled Monument in its own right.

==Influence and cultural references==
The hill was used as the setting for the music video of the Kate Bush song &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;.
