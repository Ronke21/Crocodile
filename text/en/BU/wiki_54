<text>Mordvins (also Mordvinians, Mordovians; ; no equivalents in Moksha and Erzya) is an official term used in the Russian Federation to refer both to Erzyas and Mokshas since 1928.

==Names==
While Robert G. Latham had identified &quot;Mordva&quot; as a self-designation, identifying it as a variant of the name &quot;Mari&quot;, Aleksey Shakhmatov in the early 20th century noted that &quot;Mordva&quot; was not used as a self-designation by the two Mordvinic tribes of the Erzya and Moksha. Nikolai Mokshin again states that the term has been used by the people as an internal self-defining term to constitute their common origin. The linguist underlines that the Mordvins do not use the name &#x27;Mordvins&#x27; as a self-designation. Feoktistov wrote &quot;So-called Tengushev Mordvins are Erzyans who speak the Erzyan dialect with Mokshan substratum and in fact they are an ethnic group of Erzyans usually referred to as Shokshas. It was the Erzyans who historically were referred to as Mordvins, and Mokshas usually were mentioned separately as &quot;Mokshas&quot;. There is no evidence Mokshas and Erzyas were an ethnic unity in prehistory&quot;. Isabelle T. Keindler writes:Gradually major differences developed in customs, language and even physical appearance (until their conversion to Christianity the Erzia and Moksha did not intermarry and even today intermarriage is rare.) The two subdivisions of Mordvinians share no folk heroes in common – their old folksongs sing only of local heroes. Neither language has a common term to designate either themselves or their language. When a speaker wishes to refer to Mordvinians as a whole, he must use the term &quot;Erzia and Moksha&quot;

===Early references===
The ethnonym &quot;Mordva&quot; is possibly attested in Jordanes&#x27; &quot;Getica&quot; in the form of &quot;Mordens&quot; who, he claims, were among the subjects of the Gothic king Ermanaric. A land called &quot;Mordia&quot; at a distance of ten days journey from the Petchenegs is mentioned in Constantine VII&#x27;s &quot;De administrando imperio&quot;.

In medieval European sources, the names &quot;Merdas, Merdinis, Merdium, Mordani, Mordua, Morduinos&quot; have appeared. In the Russian Primary Chronicle, the ethnonyms &quot;Mordva&quot; and &quot;mordvichi&quot; first appeared in the 11th century. After the Mongol invasion of Rus&#x27;, the name Mordvin rarely gets mentioned in Russian annals, and is only quoted after the Primary Chronicle up until the 15th–17th centuries.

===Etymologies===
The name &quot;Mordva&quot; is thought to originate from an Iranian (Scythian) word, &quot;mard&quot;, meaning &quot;man&quot;. The Mordvin word &quot;mirde&quot; denoting a husband or spouse is traced to the same origin . This word is also probably related to the final syllable of &quot;Udmurt&quot;, and also in and perhaps even in .

The first written mention of &quot;Erzya&quot; is considered to be in a letter dated to 968 AD, by Joseph, the Khazar khagan, in the form of &quot;arisa&quot;. More controversially, it is sometimes linked to the &quot;Aorsy&quot; and &quot;Alanorsi&quot; mentioned in the works of Strabo and Ptolemy. (However, the consensus view is that the Alans, a nomadic Iranian tribe from east Central Asia, were also known as the Aorsi/Alanorsi.) Estakhri, from the 10th century, has recorded among the three groups of the Rus people the &quot;al-arsanija&quot;, whose king lived in the town of &quot;Arsa&quot;. The people have sometimes been identified by scholars as Erzya, sometimes as the &quot;aru&quot; people, and also as Udmurts. It has been suggested by historians that the town &quot;Arsa&quot; may refer to either the modern Ryazan or Arsk In the 14th century, the name Erzya is considered to have been mentioned in the form of &quot;ardzhani&quot; by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, and as &quot;rzjan&quot; by Jusuf, the Nogaj khan In Russian sources, the ethnonym Erza first appears in the 18th century.

The earliest written mention of Moksha, in the form of Moxel, is considered to be in the works of a 13th-century Flemish traveler, William of Rubruck, and in the Persian chronicle of Rashid-al-Din, who reported the Golden Horde to be at war with the Moksha and the Ardzhans (Erzia).
In Russian sources, &#x27;Moksha&#x27; appears from the 17th century.

=== Restoration of Erzya and Moksha ethnonyms ===
Mokshas from Altä velä wrote a collective open letter to Literaturnaya Gazeta in 1991.
On the First Erzya and Moksha Peoples&#x27; Congress in 1989 the first point of the Congress Declaration was renaming Mordovia to Moksha and Erzya Autonomous Republic and banning the term &quot;Mordva&quot;.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The Gorodets culture dating back to around 500 BC has been associated with these people. The north-western neighbours were the Muromians and Merians who spoke related Finno-Ugric languages. To the north of the Mordvins lived the Maris, and to the south the Khazars. The Mordvins&#x27; eastern neighbors, possibly remnants of the Huns, became the Bulgars around 700 AD.

Researchers have distinguished the ancestors of the Erzya and the Moksha from the mid-1st century AD by the different orientations of their burials and by elements of their costumes and by the variety of bronze jewellery found by archaeologists in their ancient cemeteries. The Erzya graves from this era were oriented north–south, while the Moksha graves were found to be oriented south–north.

===Modern history===

Although the Mordvins were given an autonomous territory as a titular nation within the Soviet Union in 1928, Russification intensified during the 1930s, and knowledge of the Mordvin languages by the 1950s was in rapid decline.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Mordvins, like other indigenous peoples of Russia, experienced a rise in national consciousness. The Erzya national epic is called &quot;Mastorava&quot;, which stands for &quot;Mother Earth&quot;. It was compiled by A. M. Sharonov and first published in 1994 in the Erzya language (it has since been translated into Moksha and Russian). &quot;Mastorava&quot; is also the name of a movement of ethnic separatism founded by D. Nadkin of the Mordovian State University, active in the early 1990s.

Finno-Ugric peoples, whose territories were included in the former USSR as well as many others, had a very brief period of national revival in 1989–1991. Finno-Ugric peoples of Idel-Ural were able to conduct their own national conventions: Udmurts (November 1991), Erzya and Moksha (March 1992), Mari (October 1992), the united convention of Finno-Ugric folks of Russia in Izhevsk (May 1992). All these conventions accepted similar resolutions with appeals to democratize political and public life in their respective republics and to support the national revival of Finno-Ugric peoples. Estonia had a strong influence on moods and opinions that dominated these conventions, (especially among national-oriented intellectuals) because many students at the University of Tartu were from Finno-Ugric republics of Russia.

==Languages==
The Mordvinic languages, a subgroup of the Uralic family, are Erzya and Moksha, with about 275,000 native speakers together. Both are official languages of Mordovia alongside Russian. The medieval Meshcherian language may have been Mordvinic, or close to Mordvinic.
Erzya is spoken in the northern and eastern and north-western parts of Mordovia, as well as in the adjacent oblasts of Nizhny Novgorod, Penza, Samara, Saratov, Orenburg, and Ulyanovsk, and in the republics of Chuvashia, Tatarstan, and Bashkortostan. Moksha is the majority language in the western part of Mordovia.

Due to differences in phonology, lexicon, and grammar, Erzya and Moksha are not mutually intelligible, to the extent that the Russian language is often used for intergroup communications. The two Mordvinic languages also have separate literary forms. The Erzya literary language was standardised in 1922 and the Mokshan in 1923. Both are currently written using the standard Russian alphabet.

=== Reconstruction of &quot;Mordvin&quot; language ===
The Moksha and Erzya languages are closely related, therefore they are thought to share a common ancestry. As to the degree of the languages&#x27; proximity, Arnaud Fournet presumes that if Moksha and Erzya had been a single language, they started to diverge 1500 years ago—the same time as French and Italian divided. Serebrenikov proves that Moksha preserves more archaic forms than those existing in Erzya.

=== Classification ===
Until ca. 2010s most Finnic linguists considered Mordvinic and Mari languages as a single subdivision of the so-called Volga-Finnic branch of the Uralic family. Currently, this approach is rejected by most scholars, and Mordvinic and Mari are considered distinct from each other: Mordvinic languages are believed to have a common ancestor with Balto-Finnic languages (Estonian and Finnish), while the Mari languages are closer to the Permic languages.

==Ethnic structure==

The Mordvins are divided into two ethnic subgroups and three further subgroups:
* the Erzya people or Erzyans, (Erzya: Эрзят/&quot;Erzyat&quot;), speakers of the Erzya language. Less than half of the Erzyans live in the autonomous republic of Mordovia, Russian Federation, Sura River and Volga River. The rest are scattered over the Russian oblasts of Samara, Penza, Orenburg, as well as Tatarstan, Chuvashia, Bashkortostan, Siberia, Far East, Armenia and USA.
* the Moksha people or Mokshans, (Moksha: Мокшет/&quot;Mokshet&quot;), speakers of the Moksha language. Less than half of the Moksha population live in the autonomous republic of Mordovia, Russian Federation, in the basin of the Volga River. The rest are scattered over the Russian oblasts of Samara, Penza, Orenburg, as well as Tatarstan, Siberia, Far East, Armenia, Estonia, Australia and USA.
*the Shoksha or Tengushevo Mordvins constitute a transitional group between the Erzya and Moksha people and live in the Tengushevsky and Torbeevsky districts of Republic of Mordovia.
*the Karatai Mordvins or Qaratays live in the Republic of Tatarstan. They no longer speak a Volga-Finnic language but have assimilated with Tatars.
*the Teryukhan Mordvins live near Nizhny Novgorod had been completely Russified by 1900 and today unambiguously identify as ethnic Russians.

Mokshin concludes that the above grouping does not represent subdivisions of equal ethnotaxonomic order, and discounts Shoksha, Karatai and Teryukhan as ethnonyms, identifying two Mordvin sub-ethnicities, the Erzya and the Moksha, and two &quot;ethnographic groups&quot;, the Shoksha and the Karatai.

Two further formerly Mordvinic groups have assimilated to (Slavic and Turkic) superstrate influence:
*The Meshcheryaks are believed to be Mordvins who have converted to Russian Orthodox Christianity and have adopted the Russian language.
*The Mishars are believed to be Mordvins who came under Tatar influence and adopted the language (Mishar Tatar dialect) and the Sunni Muslim religion. This however is only one theory; there is no consensus on the subject of Mishar ethnogenesis and some have heavily criticized given version.

==Demographics==

Latham (1854) quoted a total population of 480,000. Mastyugina (1996) quotes 1.15 million. The 2002 Russian census reports 0.84 million.

According to estimates by Tartu University made in the late 1970s, less than one third of Mordvins lived in the autonomous republic of Mordovia, in the basin of the Volga River.

Others are scattered (2002) over the Russian oblasts of Samara (116,475), Penza (86,370), Orenburg (68,880) and Nizhni Novgorod (36,705), Ulyanovsk (61,100), Saratov (23,380), Moscow (22,850), Tatarstan (28,860), Chuvashia (18,686), Bashkortostan (31,932), Siberia (65,650), Russian Far East (29,265).

Populations in parts of the former Soviet Union not now part of Russia are: Kyrgyz Republic 5,390, Turkmenistan 3,490, Uzbekistan 14,175, Kazakhstan, (34,370), Azerbaijan (1,150), Estonia (985), Armenia (920).

==Cultures, folklores and mythologies==
According to Tatiana Deviatkina, although sharing some similarities, no common Mordvin mythology has emerged, and therefore the Erza and Moksha mythologies are defined separately.

In the Erza mythology, the superior deities were hatched from an egg. The mother of gods is called &quot;Ange Patiai&quot;, followed by the Sun God, &quot;Chipaz&quot;, who gave birth to &quot;Nishkepaz&quot;; to the earth god, &quot;Mastoron kirdi&quot;; and to the wind god, &quot;Varmanpaz&quot;. From the union of &quot;Chipaz&quot; and the Harvest Mother, &quot;Norovava&quot;, was born the god of the underworld, &quot;Mastorpaz&quot;. The thunder god, &quot;Pur’ginepaz&quot;, was born from &quot;Niskende Teitert&quot;, (the daughter of the mother of gods, &quot;Ange Patiai&quot;).
The creation of the Earth is followed by the creation of the Sun, the Moon, humankind, and the Erza. Humans were created by &quot;Chipaz&quot;, the sun god, who, in one version, molded humankind from clay, while in another version, from soil.

In Moksha mythology, the Supreme God is called &quot;Viarde Skai&quot;. According to the legends, the creation of the world went through several stages: first the Devil moistened the building material in his mouth and spat it out. The piece that was spat out grew into a plain, which was modeled unevenly, creating the chasms and the mountains. The first humans created by &quot;Viarde Skai&quot; could live for 700–800 years and were giants of 99 &quot;archinnes&quot;. The underworld in Mokshan mythology was ruled by &quot;Mastoratia&quot;.

Latham reported strong pagan elements surviving Christianization. The 1911 &quot;Britannica&quot; noted how the Mordvins:
===Religion===

Erzya practices Christianity (Eastern Orthodox and Lutheranism brought by Finnish missionaries in the 1990s) and a native religion.

== National representative bodies ==
On 1 May 2020 the Aťań Eźem approved new system of national representative bodies. Statute on creation and functioning of national representative bodies of Erzya people consists of six chapters, describing aims and tasks of Erzya national movement, its governing bodies, their plenary powers and structure. According to the document, national movement directed by Promks – convention of delegates from Erzya political parties and public organizations. Convention forms Aťań Eźem, that is operative between Promks sessions and elects Inyazor, who presents Erzya people and speaks on behalf of all the nation. In the event that there are any legal limitations for creation and operation of national parties (such prohibition exists in Russian Federation nowadays), then plenary powers of Promks are carried by Aťań Eźem. The main objective of Promks, Aťań Eźem and Inyazor, is to provide and defend national, political, economic and cultural rights of Erzya, including right to national self-determination within national Erzya territories.

== Genetics ==
Autosomally, Mokshas and Erzyas show homogeneity. About 11% of their ancestry is Nganasan-like. This East Eurasian component is typical for Uralic-speaking populations. They also have high level of Steppe-related admixture, as it can be modelled to be about half of their ancestry.

==Appearance==

The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; noted that the Mordvins, although they had largely abandoned their language, had &quot;maintained a good deal of their old national dress, especially the women, whose profusely embroidered skirts, original hair-dress large ear-rings which sometimes are merely hare-tails, and numerous necklaces covering all the chest and consisting of all possible ornaments, easily distinguish them from Russian women.&quot;

&quot;Britannica&quot; described the Mordvins as having mostly dark hair and blue eyes, with a rather small and narrow build. The Moksha were described as having darker skin and darker eyes than the Erzya, while the Qaratays were described as &quot;mixed with Tatars&quot;.

Latham described the Mordvins as taller than the Mari, with thin beards, flat faces and brown or red hair, red hair being more frequent among the Ersad than the Mokshad.

James Bryce described &quot;the peculiar Finnish physiognomy&quot; of the Mordvin diaspora in Armenia, &quot;transplanted hither from the Middle Volga at their own wish&quot;, as characterised by &quot;broad and smooth faces, long eyes, a rather flattish nose&quot;.

<text>The PZL.37 &quot;Łoś&quot; (&#x27;moose&#x27;) was a Polish twin-engined medium bomber designed and manufactured by national aircraft company Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze (PZL). It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;PZL P.37&quot;, but the letter &quot;P&quot; was reserved for fighters of Zygmunt Puławski&#x27;s design (such as the PZL P.11).

Upon its introduction to service, it was popularly considered to be not only the most modern and effective weapon then possessed by Poland, but also to be one of the most advanced bombers then operational in the world. From mid-1938 onwards, interest was expressed by various nations in potential export sales of the PZL.37; in response to this highly favourable reception, PZL, being keen to meet the demands, developed additional variants that were intended for the export market, such as the PZL.37C (which was to be powered by a pair of Gnome-Rhone 14N-0/1 radial engines). An improved enlarged derivative, known as the PZL.49 Miś, was also developed for the Polish Air Force.

The Łoś was extensively used in the defense of Poland during the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy/McNiece&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 1939, the Polish Air Force had roughly 86 PZL.37s in total, but less than a half of those actually saw active combat use due to aircraft being used by training units, being in maintenance, or having been held in reserve. The bombers suffered from a high attrition rate due to lack of fighter protection, and the final Polish combat missions were performed on 19 September. In October 1940, around 26-27 of the PZL.37s that had been evacuated from Poland were seized by the Romanian government and 23 of these aircraft were subsequently used by the Royal Romanian Air Force in the invasion of the Soviet Union.

==Development==
===Background===
Throughout the majority of the interwar period, the dominant military philosophies and practices within the leadership of Poland was that aircraft were of a secondary importance and a separate air-oriented service within the Polish Armed Forces would be of questionable value. Instead, it was decided to develop the nation&#x27;s aviation assets to principally function as a means of providing aerial support to the newly formed Polish Land Forces. As such, a relatively minimal budget was allocated for aviation matters while no dedicated doctrine in respect to air power was developed, neither was an effective bomber force pursued in any form throughout much of this period and, when such a force was established, it was met with controversy and heavy criticism from officers who were sceptical that Poland required any bomber aircraft at all.

Despite this unpromising lack of interest, a separate service, known as the &quot;Wojska Lotnicze&quot; (Polish Air Force), had been formed during 1918. During the Polish–Soviet War of 1919, there had been proposals mooted for the formation of a specialised bomber group equipped with modified Breguet 14 B2 biplanes; however, these were not quickly followed up upon due to a lack of understanding and appreciation amongst senior officers. During April 1920, the first Polish bomber squadron was stood up at Poznań–Ławica Airport, Greater Poland, equipped with a variety of captured ex-German aircraft such as Gotha G.IVs, AEG G.IVs, and Friedrichshafen G.IIIs. However, following the end of the conflict with the Soviets, this bomber squadron was amalgamated with a reconnaissance-orientated squadron.

During 1920, the Polish Air Force heavily benefited from an extensive re-armament and expansion programme headed by General Włodzimierz Zagórski, under which the formation of dedicated bomber regiments was envisioned. Accordingly, an order was placed for 32 French-built Farman F.68 BN.4 Goliath twin-engined night bombers, with which it was intended to equip and launch these squadrons. An additional pair of army co-operation squadrons were repurposed as light bomber units instead, equipped with French Potez XV B2 aircraft. Unfortunately, Zagórski&#x27;s reforms were abandoned following the May Coup led by Józef Piłsudski.

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, some officials within Poland remained interested in the establishment of a national bomber force, in some cases for prestige value rather than in terms of strict military value. During 1927, the Department of Aeronautics authorised the development of the Lublin R-VIII, a large single-engined reconnaissance bomber. In the following year, the department ordered Polish aviation manufacturer Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze (PZL) to make preparations towards the development of a heavy multi-engined night bomber; while numerous proposals and design studies were made by both PZL and private factories, but none were approved for further development by the department. Instead, it was decided to procure a number of Dutch-built Fokker F.VII to meet the bomber role, the first of which being delivered during 1929, despite condemnation of the aircraft&#x27;s poor defensive armament, limited payload capacity, and excessive weight.

===Emergence===
Despite not being approved for further development, PZL decided to independently continue refining their designs for a multi-engined night bomber. These studies, led by aircraft engineer Wladyslaw Zalewski, developed an advanced concept for an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane bomber known as the PZL.3. The bomber was to be powered by an arrangement of four Bristol Jupiter radial engines positioned in tandem pairs and armed with a pair of side-mounted gun turrets in addition to an internally-stowed bombload of 3,000 kg (6,613 lb). However, during December 1930, all work on this concept was abandoned as an economy measure and the construction of a prototype was abandoned. Reportedly, technical data for the PZL.3 was later received by French manufacturer Potez.

During the 1930s, discussions were held regarding a potential replacement of Poland&#x27;s Fokker F.VIIs. Numerous concepts were explored by the Department of Aeronautics, the most impressive submission was deemed to have been made by Polish aeronautical engineer Jerzy Dąbrowski, who had produced the initial proposals that would lead to the PZL.37 during spring 1934 and submitted to the department in July 1934. The concept was of a very quick monoplane bomber manned by a crew of four, featuring all-metal stressed-skin construction and powered by a pair of radial engines capable of producing 800–1,200 hp. The airframe was aerodynamically clean and was to be capable of very high performance, far in advance of contemporary bombers; wind tunnel testing using scale models of the aircraft were extremely encouraging.

During October 1934, the instruction to proceed with the proposal, initially designated &quot;P.37&quot;, was received by PZL. An express priority was placed upon performance over armament and equipment, relying upon its high speed for its defence; as such, only a single 7.7 mm machine gun was allocated to each turret position instead of the twin-guns and 20 mm dorsal cannon previously considered. On 14 April 1935, the department issued its approval of a full-scale wooden mock-up of the aircraft, authorising the construction of a pair of prototypes along with a structural test frame.

During early 1936, the necessity of revising the design&#x27;s structure delayed the construction of the partially-assembled first prototype. During May 1936, the prototype commenced ground testing and taxiing trials; however, on 15 June, while being rolled out for its intended first flight, an engine failure was sustained prior to the attempt, resulting in its delay. On 30 June 1936, the first PZL.37/I prototype, which was fitted with a single vertical stabilizer, performed its maiden flight successfully. In August 1936, the initial factory tests were completed, after which the first prototype participated in official airworthiness and service trials. These revealed a handful of shortcomings, including rear fuselage flutter, excessive vibration on the instrumentation panel, overheating of the cylinder heads, and criticism of the cockpit&#x27;s lack of space, however, test pilots were typically highly impressed with the aircraft.

In response to the feedback from the first prototype&#x27;s testing, several improvements and other modifications were made, some of which were introduced on the original prototype while more extensive changes were introduced upon the second prototype designated as PZL.37/II. This second prototype featured the adoption of twin-vertical stabilizers, a re-worked cockpit and an altered ventral gun position amongst other changes, functioned as a representative aircraft of the anticipated production bomber and performed its first flight during autumn 1936. Suitably impressed, the department accepted the aircraft for production, placing an initial order for 10 pre-production aircraft, as well as bestowing a name upon the bomber, &quot;Łoś&quot;.

===Production===

Production of the Łoś commenced during the winter of 1936–1937. During 1938, the first 10 serial aircraft were manufactured, designated as PZL.37A; these were furnished with a single vertical stabilizer. The next 19 interim aircraft were constructed to the PZL.37A bis standard, having been outfitted with the newer twin tail configuration. All of these aircraft were powered by the British-developed Bristol Pegasus XII B radial engine, which was produced in Poland under licence.

The main production variant, the PZL.37B (or: Łoś II), was furnished with the twin tail arrangement along with newer Pegasus XX engines. During autumn 1938, production of the PZL.37B commenced for the Polish Air Force. During the initial period of service, 2 prototypes and 6 serial aircraft were lost in separate crashes; these had been caused by several technical problems, most of which involved the rudder seizing (due to being aero-dynamically overbalanced) and consequent total loss of control. Following the implementation of some structural changes, the PZL.37B became a highly reliable aircraft. By the outbreak of the Second World War, roughly 92 PZL.37 bombers had been produced and delivered to the Polish Air Force, and a further 31 were in different phases of production.

Prior to the Second World War, the PZL.37B Łoś was widely considered to be one of the most advanced bombers then operational in the world. It was able to carry a heavier bombload than considerably larger aircraft, such as the British-built Vickers Wellington, though over shorter range and the dimensions of the individual bombs were limited. Being smaller than most contemporary medium bombers, the Łoś was relatively fast and easy to handle. As a consequence of a favourable landing gear arrangement, having been fitted with double wheels, the bomber could operate from austere airstrips as well as rough fields or meadows. Typically amongst bombers of the late 1930s, its defensive armament consisted of only three machine guns, which subsequently proved too weak against enemy fighters in combat.

===Export interest and further development===
Starting with a presentation at a salon in Belgrade in June 1938 and in Paris in November, the PZL.37 met with a huge interest. For export purposes, new variants were developed: the PZL.37C with Gnome-Rhone 14N-0/1 radial engines of 985 cv (971 BHP, 724 kW), maximum speed 445 km/h and the PZL.37D with 14N-20/21 of 1,065 cv (1,050 BHP, 783 kW), maximum speed 460 km/h. In 1939, 20 PZL.37Cs were ordered by Yugoslavia, 12 by Bulgaria, 30 PZL.37Ds and license by Romania and 10, raw materials and parts for next 25 and license by Turkey and, finally, 12 aircraft for Greece.

The Belgian company Constructions Aéronautiques G. Renard was granted permission to perform the license production of between 20 and 50 aircraft for the Second Spanish Republic; however, the venture was abandoned due to the victory of the opposing Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. In addition to the Belgian venture, it is known that Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Iran were all at various stages of negotiation for their own acquisitions of the type. The Polish military were not allowed to establish an arrangement with Iran due to &quot;lack of production abilities&quot;. Nevertheless, the outbreak of the war acted to prevent the production of any of these aircraft. At that time, PZL developed the next variant for the Polish Air Force, the PZL.49 Miś, but this was not completed before the war. Possessing slightly bigger dimensions, the Miś (&quot;Bear&quot;) was to be fitted with Bristol Hercules II radial engines of 1,350 bhp (1,370 cv, 1,007 kW), capable of a maximum speed of 520 km/h along with the addition of an upper turret.

==Design==

The PZL.37 Łoś was a twin-engined all-metal monoplane medium bomber. The first production variant PZL.37A was relatively conventional in layout, being outfitted with low-set wings, a single vertical stabilizer, and a metal-covered airframe. The late A series (designated Abis) and B series aircraft received a double vertical stabilizer which improved flight stability and increased the field of fire of the dorsal gunner. The aircraft was quite small for its bomb load and range; its carrying capacity was achieved in part by a lift-generating, airfoil-shaped fuselage, which was an innovative feature (previously used e.g. on PZL.26 sports plane). It was shorter and had smaller wings than its German and French counterparts but carried comparable bomb load and defensive armament. The crew consisted of four: pilot, commander-bombardier, radio operator and a dorsal gunner. The bombardier was accommodated in the glazed nose, with a forward-firing machine gun. The radio operator sat inside the fuselage, above the bomb bay, and also operated the ventral machine gun during combat.

The Łoś featured retractable main undercarriage, which retracted into purpose-built alcoves located within the engine nacelles. The undercarriage was double-wheeled, complete with independent suspension for each wheel. The bomber was powered by a pair of Bristol Pegasus radial engines; the PZL.37A model had Pegasus XII B engines (normal power: 860 BHP (873 cv, 642 kW), maximum: 940 BHP (953 cv, 701 kW)), the PZL.37B variant had Pegasus XX engines (normal power: 905 HP (918 cv, 675 kW), maximum: 970 BHP (984 cv, 723 kW)).

Originally, it was intended for a popular wing profile, designed by Ryszard Bartel (also used in many other successful Polish airframes incl. PZL P.11) to be used for the aircraft; however, the requirement of providing bomb storage with the internal space of the wings necessitated modification to the design. Some publications claim the resulting profile displayed laminar-flow properties (one of the first in the world), but this is disputed – its shape which resembled laminar flow wings developed in later years, but this was largely fortuitous, and at any rate achieving the laminar flow regime would have required additional construction features (most importantly extremely smooth wings shaped with extreme precision) which the aircraft simply lacked. However, the profile did display lower drag than expected and the initial PZL.37A version possessed a maximal speed 10 per cent higher than the originally planned 360 km/h. The modified profile was viewed as highly successful and was later re-used for other projects (sometimes in further modified form; e.g. PZL.46 Sum, PZL.49 Miś, PZL.50 Jastrząb).

The bomber&#x27;s offensive payload was spread across a two-section bomb bay set within the fuselage (providing space for up to 4 bombs) and a total of 8 compact bomb bays located in the central section of the wings (which had space for a maximum of 16 bombs). This arrangement of bomb bays imposed considerable restrictions on the types of bombs that could be carried, especially in the wing bays which were quite small due to the need to fit between the ribs of the wing. The maximum load was 2,580 kg (2 × 300 kg and 18 × 110 kg). Apart from a pair of 300 kg bombs in one of the fuselage bomb bays, it could not carry bombs larger than 110 kg. When flown at the maximum loadout, the majority of the weight of the bombs was carried inside the wings. There were no provisions for mounting bombs on the outside of the aircraft. During the invasion of Poland in 1939, 110 kg was the maximum weight used, since the 300 kg bombs were available only in small quantities, and were difficult to load at improvised airfields with little infrastructure. 50 kg bombs were also used. Maximal bomb load taken from soft surface runways was reduced to about 800–1200 kg.

==Operational history==
===Poland===
During early 1938, the Polish Air Force started to receive the Łos A variant; it was followed by deliveries of the improved PZL.37B to operational units, which had been slowed by delays in supply of the Pegasus XX engines and other equipment, during the autumn of 1938. It was planned that by April 1939, the air force should have 128 aircraft but less than half had been accepted into service and half of those were early production not up to standard and issued to conversion training units. 
On 1 September 1939, the Polish Air Force had roughly 86 PZL.37s in total, but less than a half of those were used in combat. 36 PZL.37Bs were in four bomber escadres of a Bomber Brigade: the 11th, 12th, 16th and 17th escadres (two escadres with nine aircraft each, constituted a group, in Polish: &quot;dywizjon&quot;; the PZL.37 were in groups X and XV). The remainder of the Bomber Brigade&#x27;s aircraft were PZL.23 Karaś. About 50 remaining PZL.37s were assigned to the reserve XX group, training units or in repairs. As a consequence of there only having been a few months available to train the crews and complete the equipping of the bombers, the planes were not fully ready when the war broke out. For example, the extra internal fuel tanks for the type were not yet in service, thus the maximum range of the bomber that had been quoted in specifications was in practice not achievable.

Only the PZL.37s of the Bomber Brigade actively participated in the defence of Poland. By 1 September, they had been deployed to rural improvised airfields, so they were not destroyed on the ground by the Germans in their initial attack on the main Polish airbases. However, because of this move away from developed airfields to short fields with poor surfaces, during the campaign the planes could take off with only a fraction of their maximum bomb load (typically 800 kg or 8 x 100 kg bombs), which limited their effectiveness. During the invasion of Poland, from 4 September onward the planes of the Bomber Brigade were attacking German armoured columns in day attacks, forced by the desperate situation to perform this mission for which they were not designed (the original plans to bomb targets inside Germany were quickly abandoned). Most notably, they hampered the advance of the XVI Army Corps near Częstochowa and Radomsko.

During these engagements, the PZL.37 suffered heavy losses as a result of a lack of adequate fighter protection, which was further amplified by the operational tactics employed, usually flying missions in units of no more than three aircraft at a time. The last combat flights took place on 16 September. During the campaign, the combat units were reinforced with several other aircraft, and about 46 PZL.37s were used in combat. Of the Bomber Brigade aircraft, ten PZL.37s were shot down by fighters, five shot down by enemy anti-aircraft artillery, two bombed on the ground and a further ten lost in other ways. A number of not fully completed, training or reserve PZL.37s were also destroyed on airfields and in factories (18 PZL.37s were bombed in a reserve base in Małaszewicze and in a factory in Warsaw – Okęcie).

===Captured aircraft===
Twenty-six or twenty-seven Polish Air Force PZL.37s (17 from the Bomber Brigade and ten training ones) were withdrawn in 1939 to Romania. During October 1940, these aircraft were seized by the Romanian government and 23 of these aircraft would be used by the Romanian Air Force in the 4th Group, consisting of the 76th and 77th bomber escadres. Some were uparmed with four machine guns (the Polish PWU machineguns were still used). About one third were lost in crashes due to lack of experience of Romanian pilots with the PZL.37&#x27;s handling and its high wing loading, and due to engine faults. About 15 were used in combat against the Soviet Union from 22 June 1941. Among others, they first operated in Bessarabia, while they were later used to conduct bombing missions targeting Kiev and Odessa. Some of the bombers were lost on these missions, mostly due to anti-aircraft fire. Because of a lack of spare parts, the remaining planes were withdrawn from the front in October 1941; after this, the type was mainly used for training. During April 1944, the 76th escadrille returned to combat, with nine aircraft, but it was withdrawn from the front on 3 May 1944. After Romania joined the Allies, on 1 September 1944, German aircraft destroyed five PZL.37s on the ground during retaliatory attacks against Romanian targets.

Additionally, a number of captured planes underwent testing by both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Relatively few PZL.37s fell into German hands, probably only two aircraft; this is partially due to the efforts of Polish factory workers who scrapped roughly 30 PZL.37s that remained in factories in Okęcie and Mielec, under the pretext of cleaning up the area, during October 1939, before the German authorities were able to reconnoiter.

==Preserved parts and replicas==
There are no surviving PZL.37 aircraft.

An original PZL Pegaz 20 engine of the type used in PZL.37 Łoś is in the collection of the Polish Aviation Museum in Kraków. This engine was sent from Poland to the United States in the spring of 1939 to be exhibited at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and thus survived the war, and was returned to Poland in 2006.

A 1:1 scale non-flying model of PZL.37 Łoś was assembled at PZL Mielec factory, in the factory hall used to construct these bombers before the war. The dimensions of the model were determined only from photographs as very little of the original blueprints for the aircraft survive; nevertheless, the model&#x27;s external shape matches the original very closely. It was constructed from aluminium and steel leftovers from aircraft under construction at the factory and was presented to the public in September 2012. The interior of the plane was not reproduced, except the bombardier&#x27;s position in the nose. Currently the model is exhibited outdoors on the grounds of the Mielec factory.()

A number of crash sites of PZL.37 Łoś shot down in September, 1939 have been identified and aircraft parts have been recovered from them. One crash site has a simple 1:1 model of the aircraft displayed as a monument.

<text>A franchise agreement is a legal, binding contract between a franchisor and franchisee. In the United States franchise agreements are enforced at the State level.

Prior to a franchisee signing a contract, the US Federal Trade Commission regulates information disclosures under the authority of The Franchise Rule. The Franchise Rule requires a franchisee be supplied a Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) (originally called Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (UFOC)) prior to signing a franchise agreement, a minimum of fourteen days before signing a franchise agreement.

Once the Federal ten-day waiting period has passed, the Franchise Agreement becomes a State level jurisdiction document. Each state has unique laws regarding franchise agreements.

A franchise agreement contents can vary significantly in content depending upon the franchise system, the state jurisdiction of the franchisor, franchisee, and arbitrator.

It overall provides the investor with a product, a branded name and recognition, and a support system.

A typical franchise agreement contains
* Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD)
* Disclosures required by state laws
* Parties defined in the agreement
* Recitals, such as Ownership of System, and Objectives of Parties
* Definitions, such as
:Agreement, Territory Area, Area Licensee, Authorized deductions, Gross Receipts, License Network, The System Manual, Trademarks, Start Date, Trade name, Termination, Transfer of license.

<doc id="599052" wikidata="Q1069363" url="?curid=599052" title="Shotgun wedding">
<text>A shotgun wedding is a wedding arranged in response to pregnancy resulting from premarital sex. The phrase comes from the figurative imagining that the relatives of the pregnant bride threaten the reluctant male groom with a shotgun in order to ensure that he marries the woman.

== Rationale ==
One purpose of such a wedding can be to get recourse from the man for the act of impregnation; another reason is trying to ensure that the child is raised by both parents. In some cases, as in early U.S. and in the Middle East, a major objective was restoring the social honor of the mother. The practice is a loophole method of preventing the birth of illegitimate children, or if the marriage occurs early enough in the gestation period, to conceal the fact that conception had already occurred prior to marriage.

In some societies, the stigma attached to pregnancy out of wedlock can be enormous, and coercive means (in spite of the legal defense of undue influence) for gaining recourse are often seen as the prospective father-in-law&#x27;s &quot;right&quot;. Often, a couple will arrange a shotgun wedding without explicit outside encouragement, and some religious groups consider it a moral imperative to marry in that situation.

== By culture ==
=== Middle East ===
Premarital sexual relations remain taboo across all social strata throughout the Arab world. In many cases, fornication is illegal and even a criminal offence under Sharia law. Even when it is not, the social response can be extreme, especially against women who have lost their virginity prior to marriage.

In Arabian culture, shotgun weddings serve to obscure the fact that a baby was conceived prior to marriage. When that proves impossible, the social standing of the couple involved is irreparably damaged. Nevertheless, shotgun weddings help prevent the individuals involved, especially the women, from becoming social pariahs.

Apart from instances of regional slang, there is no universal, specific term for &quot;shotgun weddings&quot; in Arabic. This is because they are not recognised as a regular social phenomenon and because a successfully conducted Middle Eastern shotgun wedding is generally unknown to the guests. In some Persian Gulf nations, the term &quot;police station marriage&quot; (Arabic: زواج مخفر) may be the closest colloquial analogue for the concept of a &quot;shotgun wedding&quot;.

=== East Asia ===

*In Japan, the slang term , or for short, emerged in the late 1990s. The term can literally be translated as &quot;oops-we-did-it-marriage&quot;, implying an unintended pregnancy. A quarter of all Japanese brides are pregnant at the time of their wedding, according to the Health Labor and Welfare Ministry, and pregnancy is one of the most common motivations for marriage. The prevalence and celebrity profile of &quot;dekichatta-kon&quot; has inspired Japan&#x27;s wedding industry to introduce an even more benign phrase, .
*In China, the term 奉子成婚 () means that the couple married because conception occurred outside of marriage. It is a pun on the phrase 奉旨成婚, pronounced &quot;Fengzhichenghun&quot; and implying that a wedding is approved by imperial edict. It is becoming increasingly common among China&#x27;s youngest generation. However, in the same age group, there is objection and criticism to such a practice.
*In South Korea, the slang term 속도위반 (RR: &quot;Sokdowiban&quot;; literally: &quot;speeding over the limit&quot;) refers to the situation in which the pregnancy preceded the marriage.
*In Vietnam, the term &quot;Bác sĩ bảo cưới&quot; (literally meaning &quot;because [the] doctor said so&quot;) is often used with humorous intention.

===Southeast Asia===
*The Philippines has a shotgun wedding tradition (Tagalog: &quot;pikot&quot;) where a man is forced to marry a woman for various reasons. Although the most common ground is impregnation, another variant of this practise include the woman&#x27;s parents forcing marriage on the man to their daughter due to his social status or wealth, rather than his desire to marry her for love; this occurs even if the former did not penetrate the latter. Weapons may or may not be used in coercion, but other means include litigation, particularly when the woman&#x27;s family threatens to file rape and lascivious acts charges against the man.
*Indonesia has a similar condition with the Philippines; this is usually called &quot;married by accident&quot;.

=== Europe ===
Because of the sexual revolution beginning in the 1960s, the concepts of love, sexuality, procreation and marriage began to separate after being intimately entangled in social consciousness for centuries. However, sexual practice had not always followed social convention, resulting in shotgun or Knobstick weddings.

*In the United Kingdom, one source reports that almost 40% of all brides were pregnant in 1850.
*In Denmark, a 1963 study found that 50% of all brides were pregnant.
*In the Netherlands and Belgium, the Dutch term &quot;moetje&quot; was a commonly used euphemism for marriage resulting from unintended pregnancy. The noun is formed from imperative of the verb &quot;moeten&quot; (&quot;must&quot;, &quot;to have to&quot;) with the added suffix &quot;-je&quot;, indicating a diminutive. Thus, it might be translated as a &quot;little must&quot; or a &quot;little you-have-to&quot;, i.e. one is compelled to marry to avoid the shame of giving birth out of wedlock.&quot;Moetjes&quot; were a common occurrence in Belgium and the Netherlands during the first half of the 20th century. In the early 1960s, about a quarter of all marriages in the Netherlands were shotgun marriages; however, in some areas, up to 90% of the brides were pregnant. By the late 2000s, the practice had become so rare that the term was growing obsolete. According to a 2013 by the Centrum voor Leesonderzoek, the word &quot;moetje&quot; was recognised by 82.5% of the Dutch and 43.1% of the Flemish.
*In Spain shotgun weddings are called casarse de penalty in Spanish or casar-se de penal in Catalan (marry by penalty), in which language also the expression fer Pasqua abans de Rams (celebrate Easter before Palm Sunday, or to put the cart before the horse) is widely used.
*In Italy they are known as matrimonio riparatore (mending marriage)

=== North America ===
In the United States and Canada, the use of duress or violent coercion to marry is no longer common, although many anecdotal stories and folk songs record instances of such coercion in 18th- and 19th-century America and Canada. Pressure to marry immediately due to pregnancy has become less common as the stigma associated with out-of-wedlock births has declined and the number of such births has increased. As a result, the typical, voluntary wedding during pregnancy might be more neutrally termed a &quot;mid-pregnancy marriage&quot;. Mid-pregnancy weddings are common enough that many suppliers of both bridal gowns and maternity clothing sell wedding dresses that fit during the later stages of pregnancy.

While a 2016 study suggests that couples who wed while pregnant do not necessarily have an increased risk of subsequent divorce, another study by Duke University from that same year demonstrated that, among whites, divorce rates increased from 19% for non-pregnant brides to 30%.

<doc id="599053" wikidata="Q842494" url="?curid=599053" title="Italian aircraft carrier Cavour">
<text>Cavour () is an Italian aircraft carrier launched in 2004. She is the flagship of the Italian Navy.

==Design==
The ship is designed to combine fixed-wing V/STOL and helicopter air operations, command and control operations, and the transport of military or civil personnel and heavy vehicles. The , hangar space can double as a vehicle hold capable of holding up to 24 main battle tanks (typically Ariete) or many more lighter vehicles (50 Dardo IFV, 100+ Iveco LMV), and is fitted aft with access ramps rated to 70 tons, as well as two elevators rated up to 30 tons for aircraft. &quot;Cavour&quot; can also operate as landing platform helicopter, accommodating heavy transport helicopters (AgustaWestland UH-101A ASH) and 325 marines (91 more, on option). The &quot;Cavour&quot; has a displacement of 27,900 tons but can reach more than 30,000 tons at full military capacity.

It complemented the Italian Navy&#x27;s other aircraft carrier, the , before the older ship was decommissioned in 2024.

The Italian Navy will replace its 16 Harriers with 15 (originally 22) Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning IIs. By May 2020, the modernization to allow &quot;Cavour&quot; to support the F-35B was completed, and the carrier was ready for subsequent integration trials. &quot;Cavour&quot; will have room for ten F-35Bs in the hangar, and six more parked on deck.

==Name==
The ship was named in honor of Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour (after proposals such as Luigi Einaudi and Andrea Doria were discarded) and became the NUM (New Major Unit) of the Italian Navy, joining the aircraft carrier &quot;Giuseppe Garibaldi&quot;. Its name holds historical significance for the Italian Navy, as a tribute to the strong impetus that Count of Cavour gave to the expansion and development of the Italian Navy, born from the fusion of the pre-unification navies, in the aftermath of Italy&#x27;s unification.

==Construction==
&quot;Cavour&quot; was laid down by Fincantieri in June 2001, and was launched from the Riva Trigoso shipyard at Sestri Levante, on 20 July 2004. Sea trials began in December 2006, and she was officially commissioned on 27 March 2008. Full operational capability (FOC) was reached on 10 June 2009.

==Service history==

On 19 January 2010, &quot;Cavour&quot; was dispatched to Haiti as part of Operation White Crane, Italy&#x27;s operation for 2010 Haiti earthquake relief. This was the first mission of the aircraft carrier, where it supplemented international efforts to provide relief for the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

It was reported that modernization works on &quot;Cavour&quot; has been completed. In May 2020, it was announced the Italian aircraft carrier would undertake a preparatory training before sailing to the U.S. where the ship would conduct trials with the F-35B STOVL. In February 2021, &quot;Cavour&quot; deployed to the United States for its initial period of flying trials with the F-35B. This saw the ship engage in four weeks of verification to determine the performance envelope of the aircraft when operating from the flight deck, using a pair of aircraft from VX-23, the US Navy&#x27;s Test and Evaluation Squadron. Once these trials were completed, and the ship was passed for operation of the F-35B, it would move to the next phase of fixed-wing flying trials, which would see Italy&#x27;s own aircraft begin operating from the carrier. On 9 March 2021, replenished her in the western Atlantic Ocean. Then on 20 March, she operated alongside in the Atlantic Ocean. On 26 March, she was in Norfolk, Virginia when the F-35B trial was completed. She left Norfolk on 16 April and returned to homeport Taranto on 30 April. Initial operating capability for the F-35s is expected for 2024.

In February 2022, she was part of interoperability training operations with the American carrier and the French carrier in the lead up to the Russo-Ukrainian War. 

In June 2024, the &quot;Cavour&quot; Strike Group began a five-month deployment to the Indo-Pacific.
On 5 and 6 October, carrier strike groups of the Indian Navy and the Italian Navy led by and &quot;Cavour&quot; and accompanied by and participated in a bilateral maritime exercise in the Arabian Sea. The exercise included aircraft like MiG-29K, F-35B and AV-8B Harrier II and integral helicopters. Operations in the sea phase included intense flight operations with fighter jets and helicopters for combined large force engagements, air combat missions, helicopter operations and search and rescue missions as well as co-ordinated weapon firings and joint manoeuvres to enhance joint operations, command and control capabilities and interoperability. The exercise also saw the participation of the Indian Air Force. During the harbour phase from 1 to 4 October, the exercise saw subject matter expert exchanges and other key interactions as well as a pre-sail planning conference.

<doc id="599054" wikidata="Q1070477" url="?curid=599054" title="Equity theory">
<text>Equity theory focuses on determining whether the distribution of resources is fair. Equity is measured by comparing the ratio of contributions (or costs) and benefits (or rewards) for each person. Considered one of the justice theories, equity theory was first developed in the 1960s by J. Stacey Adams, a workplace and behavioral psychologist, who asserted that employees seek to maintain equity between the inputs that they bring to a job and the outcomes that they receive from it against the perceived inputs and outcomes of others. According to Equity Theory, in order to maximize individuals&#x27; rewards, we tend to create systems where resources can be fairly divided amongst members of a group. Inequalities in relationships will cause those within it to be unhappy to a degree proportional to the amount of inequality. The belief is that people value fair treatment which causes them to be motivated to keep the fairness maintained within the relationships of their co-workers and the organization. The structure of equity in the workplace is based on the ratio of inputs to outcomes. Inputs are the contributions made by the employee for the organization.

==Background==
Equity theory stems from Social Exchange Theory. It proposes that individuals who perceive themselves as either under-rewarded or over-rewarded will experience distress, and that this distress leads to efforts to restore equity within the relationship. Equity is measured by comparing the ratios of contributions and benefits of each person within the relationship. Partners do not have to receive equal benefits (such as receiving the same amount of love, care, and financial security) or make equal contributions (such as investing the same amount of effort, time, and financial resources), as long as the ratio between these benefits and contributions is similar. Much like other prevalent theories of motivation, such as Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, equity theory acknowledges that subtle and variable individual factors affect each person’s assessment and perception of their relationship with their relational partners. According to Adams in 1965, anger is induced by underpayment inequity and guilt is induced with overpayment equity. Payment whether hourly wage or salary, is the main concern and therefore the cause of equity or inequity in most cases.

In any position, an employee wants to feel that their contributions and work performance are being rewarded with their pay. If an employee feels underpaid then it will result in the employee feeling hostile towards the organization and perhaps their co-workers, which may result in the employee not performing well at work anymore. It is the subtle variables that also play an important role in the feeling of equity. Just the idea of recognition for the job performance and the mere act of thanking the employee will cause a feeling of satisfaction and therefore help the employee feel worthwhile and have better outcomes. Employees can also feel positive inequity which may cause the worker to feel guilty and attempt to compensate for those feelings of guilt.

===Definition of equity===
Individuals compare their job inputs and outcomes with those of others and then respond to eliminate any perceived inequities.
Referent comparisons:

===Inputs and outcomes===

====Inputs====
Inputs are defined as each participant’s contributions to the relational exchange and are viewed as entitling them to rewards or costs. The inputs that a participant contributes to a relationship can be either assets – entitling them to rewards – or liabilities - entitling them to costs. The entitlement to rewards or costs ascribed to each input vary depending on the relational setting. In industrial settings, assets such as capital and manual labor are seen as &quot;relevant inputs&quot; – inputs that legitimately entitle the contributor to rewards. In social settings, assets such as physical beauty and kindness are generally seen as assets entitling the possessor to social rewards. Individual traits such as boorishness and cruelty are seen as liabilities entitling the possessor to costs. Inputs typically include any of the following:

* Time
*Education 
*Εxperience
*Effort
* Loyalty
*Hard Work
*Commitment
*Ability
*Adaptability
* Flexibility
* Tolerance
*Determination
* Enthusiasm
*Personal sacrifice
*Trust in supervisors
*Support from co-workers and colleagues
*Skill

====Outcomes====
Outputs are defined as the positive and negative consequences that an individual perceives a participant has incurred as a consequence of their relationship with another. When the ratio of inputs to outputs is close, then the employee should have much satisfaction with their job. Outputs can be both tangible and intangible. Typical outputs include any of the following:

* Job security
* Salary
* Employee benefit
*Expenses
*Recognition
* Reputation
* Responsibility
*Sense of achievement
*Praise
*Thanks
*Stimuli

===Propositions===
Equity theory consists of four propositions:

* self-inside: Individuals seek to maximize their outcomes (where outcomes are defined as rewards minus costs).
* self-outside: Groups can maximize collective rewards by developing accepted systems for equitably apportioning rewards and costs among members. Systems of equity will evolve within groups, and members will attempt to induce other members to accept and adhere to these systems. The only way groups can induce members to equitably behave is by making it more profitable to behave equitably than inequitably. Thus, groups will generally reward members who treat others equitably and generally punish (increase the cost for) members who treat others inequitably.
* others-inside: When individuals find themselves participating in inequitable relationships, they become distressed. The more inequitable the relationship, the more distress individuals feel. According to equity theory, both the person who gets &quot;too much&quot; and the person who gets &quot;too little&quot; feel distressed. The person who gets too much may feel guilt or shame. The person who gets too little may feel angry or humiliated.
* other-outside: Individuals who perceive that they are in an inequitable relationship attempt to eliminate their distress by restoring equity. The greater the inequity, the more distress people feel and the more they try to restore equity.

==Practical applications==
Equity theory has been widely applied to business settings by industrial psychologists to describe the relationship between an employee&#x27;s motivation and his or her perception of equitable or inequitable treatment. In a business setting, the relevant dyadic relationship is that between employee and employer. As in marriage and other contractual dyadic relationships, equity theory assumes that employees seek to maintain an equitable ratio between the inputs they bring to the relationship and the outcomes they receive from it. Equity theory in business, however, introduces the concept of social comparison, whereby employees evaluate their own input/output ratios based on their comparison with the input/outcome ratios of other employees. Inputs in this context include the employee’s time, expertise, qualifications, experience, intangible personal qualities such as drive and ambition, and interpersonal skills. Outcomes include monetary compensation, perquisites (&quot;perks&quot;), benefits, and flexible work arrangements which impact motivation, performance, and satisfaction of workers. Employees who perceive inequity will seek to reduce it, either by distorting inputs and/or outcomes in their own minds (&quot;cognitive distortion&quot;), directly altering inputs and/or outcomes, or leaving the organization. Workers will change the quality of their work based on their perceived compensation. These perceptions of inequity are perceptions of organizational justice, or more specifically, injustice. Subsequently, the theory has wide-reaching implications for employee morale, efficiency, productivity, and turnover.

Equity theory has also been applied to intimate relationships. Scholars address the notion that intimate relationships also exemplify equity theory in action because partners evaluate the fairness of their inputs and outputs. According to scholars, equity theory may explain how individuals choose their partner and the functionality of the relationship This concept has been applied to exploitative relationships, reciprocal relationships, and altruistic relationships. Further, scholars state that equity theory explains that inequalities in the relationship can lead to feelings of distress and depression.

===Assumptions of equity theory applied to business===
The three primary assumptions applied to most business applications of equity theory can be summarized as follows:

# Employees expect a fair return for what they contribute to their jobs, a concept referred to as the &quot;equity norm&quot;.
# Employees determine what their equitable return should be after comparing their inputs and outcomes with those of their co-workers. This concept is referred to as &quot;social comparison&quot;.
# Employees who perceive themselves as being in an inequitable situation will seek to reduce the inequity either by distorting inputs and/or outcomes in their own minds (&quot;cognitive distortion&quot;), by directly altering inputs and/or outputs, or by leaving the organization.

===Implications for managers===
Equity theory has several implications for business managers:

*People measure the totals of their inputs and outcomes. This means a working mother may accept lower monetary compensation in return for more flexible working hours.
*Different employees ascribe personal values to inputs and outcomes. Thus, two employees of equal experience and qualification performing the same work for the same pay may have quite different perceptions of the fairness of the deal.
*Employees are able to adjust for purchasing power and local market conditions. Thus a teacher from Alberta may accept lower compensation than his colleague in Toronto if his cost of living is different, while a teacher in a remote African village may accept a totally different pay structure.
*Although it may be acceptable for more senior staff to receive higher compensation, there are limits to the balance of the scales of equity and employees can find excessive executive pay demotivating.
*Staff perceptions of inputs and outcomes of themselves and others may be incorrect, and perceptions need to be managed effectively.
*An employee who believes he is overcompensated may increase his effort. However he may also adjust the values that he ascribes to his own personal inputs. It may be that he or she internalizes a sense of superiority and actually decrease his efforts.

==Criticisms and related theories==
Criticism has been directed toward both the assumptions and practical application of equity theory by people such as Leventhal who assert that Equity Theory is too unidimensional, ignores procedure, and overestimates how important the concept of fairness is in social interactions. Scholars have questioned the simplicity of the model, arguing that a number of demographic and psychological variables affect people&#x27;s perceptions of fairness and interactions with others. Furthermore, much of the research supporting the basic propositions of equity theory has been conducted in laboratory settings, and thus has questionable applicability to real-world situations. Critics have also argued that people might perceive equity/inequity not only in terms of the specific inputs and outcomes of a relationship, but also in terms of the overarching system that determines those inputs and outputs. Thus, in a business setting, one might feel that his or her compensation is equitable to other employees&#x27;, but one might view the entire compensation &quot;system&quot; as unfair.

Researchers have offered numerous magnifying and competing perspectives:

===Equity sensitivity construct===
The Equity Sensitivity Construct proposes that individuals has different preferences for equity and thus react in different ways to perceived equity and inequity. Preferences can be expressed on a continuum from preferences for extreme under-benefit to preferences for extreme over-benefit. Three archetypal classes are as follows:

*Benevolent individuals, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to be less than those of their relational partner. In other words, the benevolent prefers to be under-benefited.
*Equity Sensitives, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to be equal to those of their relational partner.
*Entitled individuals, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to exceed those of their relational partner. In other words, the entitled prefers to be over-benefited.

===Fairness model===
The Fairness Model proposes an alternative measure of equity/inequity to the relational partner or &quot;comparison person&quot; of standard equity theory. According to the Fairness Model, an individual judges the overall &quot;fairness&quot; of a relationship by comparing their inputs and outcomes with an internally derived standard. The Fairness Model thus allows for the perceived equity/inequity of the overarching system to be incorporated into individuals&#x27; evaluations of their relationships.

===Game theory===
Behavioral economics has recently started to apply game theory to the study of equity theory. For instance, Gill and Stone in 2010 analyze how considerations of equity influence behavior in strategic settings in which people compete and develop the implications for optimal labor contracts.

<doc id="599066" wikidata="Q866214" url="?curid=599066" title="Scapular">
<text>A scapular () is a Western Christian garment suspended from the shoulders. There are two types of scapulars, the monastic and devotional scapular; both forms may simply be referred to as &quot;scapular&quot;. As an object of popular piety, a scapular serves to remind wearers of their commitment to live a Christian life.

The &quot;monastic scapular&quot; appeared first, perhaps as early as the 7th century AD in the Order of Saint Benedict. It is a length of cloth suspended both front and back from the shoulders of the wearer, often reaching to the knees. It may vary in shape, color, size and style. Monastic scapulars originated as aprons worn by medieval monks, and later became part of the habits for members of religious organizations, orders or confraternities. Monastic scapulars now form part of the religious habit of monks and nuns in many religious orders.

The &quot;devotional scapular&quot; is a much smaller item and evolved from the monastic scapular. Devotional scapulars may be worn by individuals who are not members of a monastic order. The devotional scapular typically consists of two small (usually rectangular) pieces of cloth, wood or laminated paper, a few inches in size, which may bear religious images or text. These are joined by two bands of cloth. The wearer places one square on the chest, rests the bands one on each shoulder and lets the second square drop down the back.

In many cases, both forms of the scapular come with a set of promises made by or to the faithful who wear them. Some of the promises are rooted in tradition.

==History==
The scapular may have emerged from an apron-like piece of cloth worn by monks. Item 55 of the Rule of Saint Benedict, dating to the 7th century, refers to the use of the scapular. In the Catholic Church the key elements of a monk&#x27;s habit eventually became the tunic, the cincture, the scapular and the hood. A nun&#x27;s clothing included the tunic, the scapular and the head veil. Some authors interpret the scapular as a symbolic apron based on the fact that monks and nuns, when engaged on some manual labor, tend to cover it with a protective apron or carefully tuck it up or throw the front length back over their shoulder to prevent it from getting in the way.

==Varieties==
===Monastic scapular===
Today, the monastic scapular is part of the garb, the habit, of many Christian religious orders, of both monks and nuns. It is an outer garment about the width of the chest, from shoulder to shoulder. It hangs down in the front and back almost to the feet, but is open on the sides (it was originally joined by straps at the waist). It is related to the &quot;analavos&quot; worn in the Eastern tradition.

Historically, the monastic scapular was at times referred to as &quot;scutum&quot; (i.e. shield), as it was laid over the head, which it originally covered and protected with one portion (from which the hood afterwards developed). A specific aspect of the use of the monastic scapular from its earliest days was obedience and the term &quot;jugum Christi&quot;, i.e. &quot;yoke of Christ&quot;, was used to refer to it. The term &quot;yoke of Christ&quot; signified obedience and removing a scapular was like removing the yoke of Christ, i.e. rebelling against authority. For instance, the Carmelite constitution of 1281 prescribed that the scapular should be worn to bed under penalty of serious fault, and the constitution of 1369 included automatic excommunication for a Carmelite saying Mass without a scapular.

Over the centuries the religious orders adapted the basic scapular as they considered appropriate for themselves, as a result of which there are now several distinct designs, colors, shapes and lengths in use. The Carthusians and others attached a hood to their scapular, rather than keeping the former a separate item of their habit, while some, like the Dominican Order or Carmelites, wear it beneath another layer, like a shoulder cape or capuce (that is, the &quot;hood&quot;). The color selection could change over time; for instance, prior to 1255, the Augustinian scapulars for novices were black and those of the lay brethren were white, but thereafter all scapulars but those of the lay brethren had to be white.

In some cases the monastic scapular was used to distinguish the rank or level of the wearer within a religious order. In some Byzantine monastic practices, two levels of fully professed monk or nun exist: those of the &quot;little habit&quot; and those other of the &quot;great habit&quot;, these being more senior and not having to do manual labor. In these cases, the &quot;great habit&quot; was simply distinguished from the &quot;little habit&quot; by the addition of a scapular decorated with the instruments of the Passion.

Just as the stole is the vestment that came to mark the office of a priest, the monastic scapular became the equivalent for those in the monastic life and even today, a long scapular identifies its wearer as a member of a religious order. It is a symbol of the confraternal way, combining in itself the principle of &quot;ora et labora&quot; (prayer and work), and so the form was later adopted by pious laity who wished to have an open sign of their devotion.

===Non-monastic reduced scapular===
Some authors suggest that the tradition of wearing a reduced form of a non-monastic scapular started in the 11th century with Saint Peter Damian and the monastic scapular was gradually transformed from an item of clothing that was part of the habit of monks and nuns to a smaller item that expressed devotion by individuals, called oblates, who lived in the world, but wished to be affiliated with a monastery.

In the Middle Ages, it became common for Christian faithful to share in the spirituality of the new mendicant orders in an auxiliary sense, sometimes called Third Orders because they were founded after the initial orders of the friars and nuns. Although these people (called Tertiaries) were permitted to wear the &quot;tertiary habit&quot;, because they had not taken religious vows they were not usually permitted to wear the full habit of the order. With time, it was considered a high honor and great privilege to be granted a small cloth attached by bands which would be worn over the torso in the same manner as the full monastic scapular. Confraternities came to be formed in which people would be granted the wearing of this item as a mark of their sharing in the good works of a particular order. Among Franciscans, they were known as &quot;Cordbearers&quot;, due to their also wearing a small cord around the waist in imitation of the one worn by the friar.

After the disruptions of religious life during the period of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic invasions of France and Italy, wearing of the tertiary habit became prohibited. Thus it eventually became common that a smaller form of an order&#x27;s scapular would be bestowed upon the non-monastic. Rather than a full length of cloth, it consisted of two rectangles (several inches wide, and much larger than a modern devotional scapular) of wool joined by bands in some fashion. These are still worn today by the &quot;Third Order&quot; members of the Franciscans, Carmelites, and Dominicans. In order to gain the benefits of the order, the members must wear these scapulae constantly. However, in 1883 in his &quot;Constitution On the Law of the Franciscan Third Order&quot; called &quot;Misericors Dei Filius&quot;, Pope Leo XIII declared that wearing either these medium-sized scapulae of the &quot;Third Order&quot; or the miniature forms of the smaller devotional scapular entitled the wearer equally to gain the indulgences associated with the order.
Some religious orders still give a short version (sometimes called the &quot;reduced scapular&quot;, but this usage is archaic) of their large scapular to non-monastics that are spiritually affiliated with them. Such short scapulars are designed to be unobtrusive and can be worn under regular clothing at home and at work.

===Devotional scapular===
Devotional scapulars are objects of popular piety, primarily worn by Roman Catholics, as well as some Anglicans and Lutherans, designed to show the wearer&#x27;s pledge to a confraternity, a saint, or a way of life, as well as reminding the wearer of that promise. Some devotional scapulars bear images, or verses from scripture. 
Devotional scapulars typically consist of two rectangular pieces of cloth, wool or other fabric that are connected by bands. One rectangle hangs over the chest of the wearer, while the other rests on the back, with the bands running over the shoulders. Some scapulars have extra bands running under the arms and connecting the rectangles to prevent them from getting dislodged underneath the wearer&#x27;s top layer of clothes.

The roots of devotional scapulars can be traced to the gathering of laity into confraternities for spiritual direction, whereby the faithful would be assigned some badge or token of affiliation and devotion. The image or message on the scapular usually reflects the order&#x27;s focus, tradition or favored devotion. Devotional scapulars and the indulgences attached to them grew along with the growth of Catholic confraternities during the 17th and 18th centuries. 
The fact that specific promises and indulgences were attached to the wearing of scapulars helped increase their following, as was seen with the early example of the Brown Scapular, habit of the Carmelites. This promise was based on the Carmelite tradition that the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to St. Simon Stock at Cambridge, England, in 1251 in answer to his appeal for help for his oppressed order and recommended the Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel to him and promised salvation for the faithful who wore it piously. Regardless of the scholarly debates regarding the exact origin of the Brown Scapular, it is clear that it has been a part of the Carmelite habit since the late 13th century.
The Blue Scapular of the Immaculate Conception that dates to 1617 was eventually granted a significant number of indulgences, and many graces were promised to those who would honor the Immaculate Conception by wearing the Blue Scapular and live chastely according to their state in life. In 1885 Pope Leo XIII approved the Scapular of the Holy Face (also known as &quot;The Veronica&quot;), and elevated the &quot;Priests of the Holy Face&quot; to an archconfraternity. He also approved the Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel and the Scapular of St. Joseph, both in 1893, and the Scapular of the Sacred Heart in 1900. In 1611, the Servite Order&#x27;s confraternity and their Black Scapular of the Seven Sorrows of Mary received indulgences from Pope Paul V.

During the 19th century, a number of other Scapulars were approved. The green Scapular of the Immaculate Heart of Mary was approved by Pope Pius IX in 1877 and the white Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel received the approval of Leo XIII in 1893 for the purpose of invoking Mary&#x27;s guidance upon its wearer. The black Scapular of Our Lady Help of the Sick, (for the Confraternity founded by St. Camillus de Lellis) was approved by Pius IX in 1860. In 1863 he also approved the Green Scapular, which is not from a Confraternity but an image inspired by a vision of the Blessed Mother experienced by Sr. Justine Bisqueyburu from the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul.

By the early 20th century the devotional scapular had gained such a strong following among Catholics worldwide that Joseph Hilgers, in the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1912 stated: &quot;Like the rosary, [the Brown Scapular] has become the badge of the devout Catholic&quot;. In the 1917 reported apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared &quot;with a Rosary in one hand and a scapular in the other&quot;. Sister Lúcia (one of the three Fátima children visionaries) stated that the Virgin Mary told her: &quot;The Rosary and the Scapular are inseparable&quot;. In the United States &quot;Scapular Magazine&quot; helped enroll one million Americans to pray the Rosary based on the Fatima messages.

While a number of scapulars (e.g. the Scapular of the Holy Face, also known as &quot;The Veronica&quot;) are entirely Christocentric, the most widespread scapulars (including the Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the Blue Scapular of the Immaculate Conception) relate to Marian devotions and consecrations. John Paul II stated that he received his first Brown Scapular of Mount Carmel at age ten when his Marian devotion was taking shape and he continued to wear it into his papacy.

Of all the types recognized by the Roman Catholic Church the best-known, and perhaps the most popular, is the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, sometimes referred to as the Brown Scapular from the color of its bands. The wearing of a devotional scapular has been viewed as a &quot;constant meditation&quot; by Bishop Leo De Goesbriand: &quot;Wherever I am, whatever I am doing, Mary never sees me without seeing upon my body an evidence of my devotion to her.&quot; This scapular, with its history in Britain, along with the Scapular of Our Lady of Walsingham are also popular devotions in the Anglican Church. The Green Scapular, &quot;instituted for the conversion of those without faith&quot; is another popular scapular among the Christian community.

===In Protestant churches===
Scapular wearing is sometimes found in Protestant churches including Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Presbyterian Churches. Instructions are provided in United Methodist Church allowing scapular to be worn over the alb by anyone lay or clergy, not as a pastoral stole or chasuble, either colored for the Church season or not.

Some Anglican churches use the scapular to designate the difference of vestments between choristers boys and girls, a tradition that continues in Church of South India for women and men.

Lutheran churches sometimes use scapulars as vestments for both men and women servers over cassocks which are regarded as clerical clothing not vestments. Scapulars in Protestant churches do not necessarily have the same meaning as in Catholic church.

Choirs may wear scapular over alb in Lutheran colleges.

==Investment, blessing and rules==
Though each scapular has its own particular qualifications and usage, the Roman Catholic Church has set down certain rules that pertain to all its types, be they monastic or devotional. A scapular associated with a confraternity must be invested by an ordained representative of that group. A scapular associated with a mystery or devotion may simply be blessed by a priest and given to the wearer. To receive the benefits or indulgences granted the scapular generally must be worn constantly. It may be placed aside for a time but, during that period, the wearer does not receive the scapular&#x27;s benefits. Should the wearer take up the wearing of it again, the benefits are again conferred.

A devotional scapular must be in good repair with both bands intact. Multiple scapulae may be worn on the same bands, but the bands must be the color of those prescribed by the scapular with the most preeminence, and that scapular must be foremost with the others behind in order of precedence. If a scapular becomes damaged to the point where it cannot be in good repair, it must be replaced. However, it is not necessary for the wearer to be reinvested as it is the devotion of the wearer, not the object itself, that confers the benefit of the scapular.

The 2004 &quot;Enchiridion Indulgentiarum&quot; grants the partial indulgence to the faithfuls of Christ who use a crucifix or cross, a crown, a scapular, or a medal blessed by a priest.

<doc id="599069" wikidata="Q7732677" url="?curid=599069" title="The Everlasting (song)">
<text>&quot;The Everlasting&quot; is the second single to be lifted from the Manic Street Preachers&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot;. It was released on 30 November 1998 through Epic, it peaked on number 11 on the UK Singles Chart, breaking their run of consecutive top-ten hits. All three members of the band—James Dean Bradfield, Sean Moore and Nicky Wire—share the writing credits.

==Background==
The title, &quot;The Everlasting&quot;, was borrowed from a poem by Nicky Wire&#x27;s brother Patrick Jones, after Wire had spent some time trying to think of a title similar to Blur&#x27;s &quot;The Universal&quot; or Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;The Eternal&quot;. &quot;The Everlasting&quot; has been described as grand, elegiac and in some ways quite profoundly sad. The lyric hints at life&#x27;s diminishing returns as one ages and lose one&#x27;s idealism.

Although some strings and an acoustic guitar were used during the recording process, the song leans quite heavily on synthetic instrumentation, including drum loops and simulated strings.

A shortened edit of the song is also featured on the 2002 compilation Forever Delayed.

==Release==
The single was released on 30 November 1998, peaking at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. It broke their run of five consecutive top-10 hits but stayed on the chart for 12 weeks. Outside the UK the single reached number 47 in the Netherlands, remaining in the chart for five weeks and in Germany it peaked at number 88, remaining on the country&#x27;s chart for seven weeks. In Iceland, it peaked at number three.

The first of two CD singles included &quot;Black Holes for the Young&quot; - a duet with Sophie Ellis-Bextor which is a criticism of London culture - and &quot;Valley Boy&quot;. The second CD single featured remixes of &quot;The Everlasting&quot; - &quot;Deadly Avenger Mix&quot; and &quot;Stealth Sonic Orchestra Mix&quot;.

===Promotional video===
The promotional video that accompanied the song was censored because it included shots of people on fire. The original version was considered insensitive as the release of the single coincided with the well-publicised inquest into the death of Michael Menson, who had been set on fire by three men in a street attack. Two versions of the video were therefore produced - one with computer generated flames, one without. The video was filmed at Euston railway station in London.

<text>Rainer Schönfelder (born 13 June 1977) is an Austrian former skier who won the 2003–2004 men&#x27;s World Cup slalom title.

==Career==
Born in Bleiburg, Carinthia, Austria, Schönfelder made his debut in the 1995–1996 season, finishing 115th in the overall rankings. He quickly began to excel in the slalom events, and improved his position in the overall World Cup standing to 10th place by the 2003–2004 season.

Apart from his slalom success in the 2003–2004 World Cup, his other achievements include 2 bronze medals (combined and slalom) at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy and a 4th place in the combined event at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.

On 27 March 2004, Schönfelder tested positive for the stimulant Etilephrine at the Austrian slalom championships. However, he was not banned and continued competing in 2004–05, since it was found that he had taken the substance inadvertently while undergoing treatment of influenza.

Rainer Schönfelder has also had some success as a pop singer in Austria, especially with a cover version of Wolfgang Ambros&#x27; classic hit &quot;Schifoan&quot; (meaning &quot;skiing&quot;).

Schönfelder made headlines on 10 January 2007 by skiing nude after losing a bet with his physiotherapist.

== Trivia ==

Before the race in Chamonix Schönfelder slipped in the bathroom and got a contusion on his testicles.

<doc id="599079" wikidata="Q170366" url="?curid=599079" title="Ahvaz">
<text>Ahvaz (; ) is a city in the Central District of Ahvaz County, Khuzestan province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district. It is home to Persians, Arabs, Lursand other groups such as Turks and Kurds. Languages spoken in the area include Persian, Arabic, Luri and dialects such as Bakhtiari, Dezfuli and Shushtari.

Ahvaz is home to over 1.3 million people within its metropolitan area. Census results suggest a steady increase in population.

As the most watery river in Iran, the Karun flows through the center of the city, which is one of the two navigable rivers in Iran, alongside the Arvand Rud.

Ahvaz has earned the reputation of being the City of Bridges due to its numerous big bridges built on the Karun to facilitate better communication between the east and west parts of the city, although since the beginning of the 20th century, this city has always been known as the Oil Capital of Iran, along with other cities of Khuzestan province.

This city has a long history, dating back to the Achaemenid period. In ancient times, the city was one of the main centers of the Academy of Gondishapur.

==Etymology==
The original inhabitants of the Khuzestan province, the Huzi, are the source of the name &quot;Ahvaz&quot;.

==History==
===Ancient history===
Later the name was changed to &quot;Hormazd-Ardašēr&quot; (Persian: &quot;Hormozd ardeshir&quot;) and it became abbreviated to Daravashir later, but as a matter of fact, it&#x27;s not quite clear if this change was by the King Ardashir I, in 230 (cf. &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, al-Muqaddasi, et al.) or by his grandson Hormizd I (according to the Middle Persian &quot;Šahrestānīhā ī Ērānšahr (shahrestān hā-ye Irānshahr)&quot;.

The city had two sections; the nobles of the city lived in one part while the other was inhabited by merchants.

=== Modern history ===
In the 19th century, &quot;Ahvaz was no more than a small borough inhabited mainly by Sabeans (1,500 to 2,000 inhabitants according to Ainsworth in 1835; 700 according to Curzon in 1890).&quot;

In the 1880s, during the Qajar era, the Karun River was dredged and re-opened to commerce. A newly built railway crossed the Karun at Ahvaz. The city again became a commercial crossroads, linking river and rail traffic. The construction of the Suez Canal further stimulated trade. A port city was built near the old village of Ahvaz, and named &quot;Bandar-e-Naseri&quot; in honor of Naser ed-Din Shah Qajar.

Oil was found near Ahvaz in the early 20th century, and the city once again grew and prospered as a result of this newfound wealth. From 1897 to 1925, the city of Ahvaz was in the hands of heshmatoddoleh Ghajar, who acted as governor and Sarhang Reza Gholi Khane Arghoon commander of Ghajari&#x27;s army based in Khuzestan. Sheikh Khaz&#x27;al was recognized by Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar as hereditary ruler of Mohammerah, Sardar Asad Bakhtiari as the most powerful leader of Khuzestan&#x27;s Bakhtiaries. He had power and authority over most regions of Khuzestan, such as Dezful, Shushtar, Izeh, even Ahvaz and Amir mojahede bakhtiari in Ramhormoz and Behbahan. At this time, the newly founded Ahvaz was named &quot;Nâseri&quot; in honour of its founder Nasser ed-Din Shah Qajar. Afterwards, during the Pahlavi era, it resumed its old name, &quot;Ahvaz&quot;. The government of the Khūzestān Province was transferred there from Shûshtar in 1926. The Trans-Iranian Railway reached Ahvaz in 1929 and by World War II, Ahvaz had become the principal built-up area of the interior of Khūzestān. Professional segregation remained well marked between various groups in that period still feebly integrated: Persians, sub-groupings of Persians and Arabs. Natives of the Isfahan region held an important place in retail trade, owners of cafes and hotels and as craftsmen.

Iraq attempted to annex Khūzestān and Ahvaz in 1980, resulting in the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988). Ahvaz was close to the front lines and suffered badly during the war.

Iraq had pressed its claims to Khūzestān. Iraq had hoped to exacerbate ethnic tensions and win over popular support for the invaders. Most accounts say that the Iranian Arab inhabitants resisted the Iraqis rather than welcome them as liberators. However, some Iranian Arabs claim that as a minority they face discrimination from the central government; they agitate for the right to preserve their cultural and linguistic distinction and more provincial autonomy. See &quot;Politics of Khūzestān&quot;.

In 1989, the &quot;Foolad Ahvaz&quot; steel facility was built close to the town. This company is best known for its company-sponsored football club, Foolad F.C., which was the champion of Iran&#x27;s Premier Football League in 2005.
In 2005 the city witnessed a series of bomb explosions. Many government sources relate these events to developments in Iraq, accusing foreign governments of organizing and funding Arab separatist groups. The Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz claimed credit for several of the bombings, including four bombs on 12 June 2005, that killed 8 people.

Gunmen killed at least 29 people in an attack on a crowd watching a military parade on 22 September 2018.

== People ==
According to the 2016 census, the city had an estimated population of 1,184,788 people.

=== Languages ===
Based on a survey taken by the Iranian ministry of culture in 2010, the most common languages in Ahvaz are Persian (44.8%), Arabic (35.7%), and Bakhtiari (15.8%). Many Ahvazis are bilingual, speaking both Persian and one of the following languages/Dialects. The Arabic spoken in Ahvaz is a variety of Khuzestani Arabic. Another part of Ahvazis speak Bakhtiari dialect. Modern Mandaic (or &quot;Mandae&quot;) language is also spoken among the Mandaeans of Ahvaz. It is a descendant of the Classical Mandaic language that has been partially influenced by Khuzestani Persian.
== Bridges ==
There are 9 bridges over the Karun river.

=== Pol-Siah (Black Bridge) ===
The Black Bridge, also known as the Victory Bridge, was the first modern bridge over the Karun River. The bridge was built during World War II and used to supply the Allies in the Soviet Union and had a major impact on Allied victory.

=== Pol-Sefid (White Bridge) ===
White Bridge is an arch bridge completed on 21 September 1936 and inaugurated on 6 November 1936. The bridge remains a symbol of the city still today.

The other 7 bridges are third bridge, Naderi bridge, Fifth bridge, Sixth bridge, Seventh bridge (also named &quot;Dialogue among civilizations bridge&quot;), Cable bridge, and Ninth bridge.

<text>The Sapygidae are a family of solitary kleptoparasitic aculeate wasps. They are generally black wasps, similar in appearance to some Tiphiidae or Thynnidae, with white or yellow markings developed to various degrees.

The female oviposits her eggs into the nests of solitary bees, and the developing larvae consume both the host larvae and the supply of food provided for them.

The Sapygidae are a small family with only about 80 species described, and they are not of major economic importance. However, some of their host species are important pollinators, and it may sometimes be necessary to control the level of predation on them.

Fossil sapygids have been found in mid-Cretaceous amber in Myanmar and Upper Eocene Baltic amber.

<doc id="599082" wikidata="Q1392543" url="?curid=599082" title="Flextime">
<text>Flextime, also spelled flex-time or flexitime (BE), is a flexible hours schedule that allows workers to alter their workday and adjust their start and finish times. In contrast to traditional work arrangements that require employees to work a standard 9a.m. to 5p.m. day, Flextime typically involves a &quot;core&quot; period of the day during which employees are required to be at work (e.g., between 11a.m. and 3p.m.), and a &quot;bandwidth&quot; period within which all required hours must be worked (e.g., between 5:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m.). The working day outside of the core period is &quot;flexible time&quot;, in which employees can choose when they work, subject to achieving total daily, weekly or monthly hours within the bandwidth period set by employers, and subject to the necessary work being done. The total working time required of employees on an approved Flextime schedule is much the same as those who work under traditional work schedule regimes.

A flextime policy allows staff to determine when they will work, while a flexplace policy allows staff to determine where they will work. Advantages include allowing employees to coordinate their work hours with public transport schedules, with the schedules of their children, and with daily traffic patterns to avoid high congestion times such as rush hour. Some claim that flexible working will change the nature of the way we work. The idea of flextime was invented by Christel Kammerer and Wilhelm Haller. The World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization estimate that over 745,000 people die from ischemic heart disease or stroke annually worldwide because they have worked 55 hours or more per week, making long working hours the occupational hazard with the largest disease burden.

== From practitioners&#x27; viewpoint ==
The industrial perspective of flexible working emphasizes the practical definition of flexibility. Employees being allowed to work from many different places as long as their level of production is maintained, if not increased. Moreover, research reports gave quantitative interpretation backed by statistical evidence showing the changing attitude of organizations in different countries (especially the UK) toward flexible working. An estimate of 50% of the companies in the UK started to consider flexible working as a common practice and 73% of the managers in the survey showed an ultimate support to it. On the other hand, employees showed great preference to flexible working to the point that 40% of workers in the UK choose it over their salary. Also, greater focus was put to explain the increased demand for such arrangements by both stakeholders by which it was clarified by their advantages of contributing to the high quality of output results while creating the &quot;perfect&quot; working conditions for workers.

Additionally, as seen recently, most business organizations have started to introduce flexible working patterns for their employees as a way to increase their productivity level, increasing profitability. Flexible working is also seen as a family-friendly policy, which leads to a &quot;good work–life balance&quot; for employees. Some examples of organizations with flexible working arrangement include Agilent technologies, NetApp and Qualcomm Inc.

Flexible working arrangements is a way for organizations to expand and increase their operations nationally and internationally at lower cost compared to permanent or non-flexible working arrangements. While both employees and employers acknowledge the benefits of flexible working, drawbacks might include extra expenses and responsibilities the organization could incur in order to provide these arrangements and the decreased benefits offered to employees in accordance with their reduced working hours.

== Empirical evidence ==
Flexible working was academically introduced in 1970 and since then this topic continues to be the interest of many research papers.

For four decades, academic papers have contributed to the increased knowledge and interest in flexible working. A descriptive background of the evolution of the concept of flexibility as well as highlighting the main factors contributed to its growth were the main focus of academic studies. Also, they deliver evidence of the significant amount and the ongoing increase in the use of flexible working in many countries.

Studies examining access to flextime have shown that it is the high skilled/educated workers in higher occupational jobs, and supervisory roles that are most likely to have access. Unlike what many assume, women do not have better access to flextime arrangements, and female-dominated workplaces have worse access to flextime compared to workplaces where there are more men or an equal number of men and women. Many studies examine the outcomes of flexible working. For example, a study by Origo and Pagani based on a sample of European countries, gave a deep analysis of the concept of flexible working by testing the level of heterogeneity in the effect of flexibility on job satisfaction, the study found some positive link with some aspects of the job while negative or no relation was found against other aspects. There is increasing evidence for the &quot;business case&quot; of flexible working. A meta-analysis of studies has shown that flexible working can provide a wide range of benefits for companies, including increase in performance, productivity, and reduction in absenteeism.

Flexible working can both prevent and create opportunities. There is generally a positive relationship between flexible working and perceptions of job quality in term of work–life balance, and helping to improve and control autonomy particularly for remote workers, but some factors such as opportunities for advancement will be negatively affected due to the variations on different dimensions of job quality. Flexible working has also been linked to increased recruitment and retention of workers. Chung and van der Horst have shown that the use of flextime significantly reduces the likelihood of mothers decreasing their working hours after childbirth and reduces the likelihood of first-time mothers leaving their work altogether. Flexible employment is one of the vital factors in the European Union policy discourse. It is a means to reduce unemployment, increase economic and social cohesion, maintain economic competitiveness and enhance equal opportunities between women and men. However, flexible working has some problems. Studies have also shown that flexible working can lead to an increase in overtime hours.

== The European Commission ==
In 2017, the European Commission proposed a directive on work–life balance which includes the extension of the right to request flexible working arrangements (reduced working hours, flexible working hours and flexibility in place of work) to all working parents of children up to 12 and careers with dependent relatives. It also includes non-legislative measures, ensuring protection against discrimination and dismissal for parents (including pregnant women and workers coming back from a leave) and careers, the directive also encourages a gender-balanced use of family-related leaves and flexible working arrangements. The proposal was approved as Directive (EU) 2019/1158.

== United Kingdom ==
Haller founded a company in the UK in 1971 and registered the trademark &quot;Flextime&quot;, the mark remains the property of the company&#x27;s successor HFX Ltd. In the Spring of 2003, 17.7% of men and 26.7% of women were employed with flextime arrangements in the United Kingdom, In the United Kingdom, flextime working is commonplace in both the private and public sectors. The practice is often found in administrative and back-office functions of commercial organizations and local councils.

In 2003, the UK Government introduced legislation that gave parents of children under 6, or the parents of disabled children under 18 the right in law to request a flexible working arrangement from their employer. A survey in 2005 by the National Office of Statistics showed that 71% of female workers and 60% of male workers were aware of the rights created under the 2003 legislation. Between 2003 and 2005 more than 14% of all workers had requested a change to flexible working. Since April 2007 the right to request flexible working also applies to carers of adults.

On 13 November 2012, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced plans to extend the right to request flexible working to all employees, this legislation took effect in April 2014. Lawyers have suggested that this will lead to &quot;major headaches&quot; for employers.

Now being enforced by the law on 30 June 2014, industrial reports concentrate on workers&#x27; right to request for flexible working and how it is guided by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS). They explained how this code is designed to help employers, employees and their representatives to deal with disciplinary and grievance situations in the workplace.

Shift workers are generally excluded from flextime schemes as are senior managers. Other groups of workers for whom flextime arrangements are rare include those who serve the public during specific opening times.

The advantages of Flextime for the individuals include a &quot;better work–life balance&quot;, fewer commutes, less fatigue, more days off and lower sickness rates. The benefits for the company include better motivated workers, more efficient and effective operation, less fatigued workers and fewer errors; Flextime also gets&#x27; people working overtime hours without paying overtime rates, make fewer facilities required, and lower sickness rates.

For employers, flextime can aid the recruitment and retention of staff. It has been a particularly popular option in 2009 for employers trying to reduce staff costs without having to make redundancies during the recession. It can also help provide staff cover outside normal working hours and reduce the need for overtime. Additionally, flextime can also improve the provision of equal opportunities to staff unable to work standard hours.

Flextime can give employees greater freedom to organize their working lives to suit personal needs. In addition, travelling can be cheaper and easier if it is out of peak time.

== United States ==
In Florida, flextime workers, like salaried workers, are exempted from insurance regulations, and are given broad leeway in setting their own work schedule. Unlike exempted salaried workers, employers are still required to pay overtime to a flextime worker if they work more than 40 hours per week.

In recent years, the term &quot;flextime&quot; has acquired a more controversial definition when used to describe proposals to overhaul the nation&#x27;s overtime regulations. Under one such proposal by the Bush administration made public on 5 August 2004, employers would not be required to pay non-exempt employees&#x27; overtime for working more than 40 hours in a week so long as the employee works no more than 80 hours over a two-week period. For example, a worker could be required to work 70 hours one week and receive no overtime compensation as long as they work 10 hours or less the following week. Such arrangements are opposed by trade unions such as the AFL–CIO.

In certain industries and disciplines, such as information technology, flextime permits workers to vary their schedule. For example, they may opt to work four 10-hour days per week, taking Monday or Friday off. Another flextime schedule is to work nine-hour days Monday through Thursday, an eight-hour day on Friday, taking every other Friday off, called the &quot;9/80 work schedule&quot;.
Some agencies of the United States government allow employees to work such a schedule, and designate it as an alternative work schedule (AWS). Workers may arrange to coordinate their days off so that their responsibilities are adequately covered.

Other workers may opt simply to come in early, such as 5 or 6a.m., and leave in the mid-afternoon, or come in late and therefore leave late. One benefit of such a schedule is that commuting times occur outside of the congested rush hour traffic within a given geographic region. Flextime arrangements also help parents: one parent works 10a.m. – 6p.m. and is in charge of the children before school / daycare, while the other parent works 7a.m. – 3p.m. and is in charge of the children after school / daycare. This allows parents time to commute. Flextime is also beneficial to workers pursuing an education.

== Australia ==
Flextime in Australia is usually referred to accumulated overtime hours that an employee can build up and exchange for the equivalent amount of time off. (Example: Jane works 7a.m. – 3p.m. Monday to Friday. Over the past month, Jane has worked 8 hours overtime meaning she is eligible for a paid day off.)

If employees accumulate too many flex hours, they are required to perform a &quot;flex burndown&quot;, as they are burning down the flex. Similarly, taking a flex day off is known as &quot;flexing off&quot;.

It is implemented formally in the federal Australian Public Service and is available for staff in most state and territory government departments. With current changes to industrial relations laws (2006), from State to Federal level there are no new published guidelines (online) for flextime.

== Recording working ==
There are many different methods used for recording working time ranging from sophisticated software (computer programs) to handwritten time sheets. Most of these methods are associated with the payment of wages in return for hours worked. As a result, they often do not address a fundamental difference of most flexible working systems – namely the intention of flexible working to allow an employee to &quot;trade hours&quot; with their employer in return for a fixed wage.

== Millennials ==
&quot;Millennial&quot; is the name most commonly used to describe those born between 1981 and 1996. As the right to request for flexible working is extended to all by law, many benefits are expected to rise. With Millennials becoming the interest of many organizations, flexible working attracts them. As ethnic diversity and high level of education are their main characteristics, it is seen that Millennials are more likely to change their jobs more than the previous generation for economic reasons. Additionally, due to the delay in the retirement of baby boomers&#x27; generation, gaps in workforce were created, waiting for the Millennial generation to fill them.

== Advantages and criticisms ==
Flexible working is a pattern of working arrangements that enable employees to decide the time, duration, and location of their work. Flexible working patterns have gained the interest of both academics and industrial practitioners for some time, with implementation into law in certain countries as far back as 1930, but also in recent years. Existing literature highlights the fundamental importance of flexible working to both academics and organizations as a means of establishing a good work–life balance for employees. Work–life balance for employees is theorized to increase employee efficiency, which in turns leads to increase in productivity of the organization. This would also be suggested from research on the decreasing returns of working hours.

Academic literature has identified benefits of flexible working patterns to employees including life satisfaction, better wellbeing, a good work–life balance, and health benefits but some researchers argue that although there are such benefits, there are some negative effects such as work intensities, job insecurities associated with the flexible working arrangement. Research works such as Evans et al., (2000) also highlight that flexible working pattern may not be applicable to all occupational fields, the authors also highlighted medical professions (doctor, pharmacist, nurse, etc.) as one of such fields. A further critique is that some patterns of work deemed &quot;flexible&quot; such as a compressed work week may be put forward by the employer, rather than suiting the individual employee, and thus may not capture the same benefits as employee-chosen flexible working.

Industrial sources also have been able to highlight one of the positive effects of flexible working patterns as being able to attract highly qualified professionals, but Brookins established some negative effects flexible working patterns had to employers as it adds expenses and responsibility in the organization, negative availability perspectives of employees on the customers, and employee availability.

Both academics and industrial sources were established that in some professions flexible working arrangement may not be available or its availability will have a negative perspective on employees by others with a non-flexible arrangement, example of such profession is medical professions. A research done by Evans et al., (2000) on flexible working patterns on medical professions emphasized how some medical doctors may attribute negative perception with colleagues with flexible working patterns. In 1930, Employees in the United Kingdom were given the right to request for flexible working arrangements, but there were no instructions or guidelines on the way for this would work. Flexible working concepts are also a relatively new form of working arrangement and this has limited its application in other parts of the world such as a country in Africa.

Flexible working patterns is a working arrangement that enable employees to determine the duration, time and location of their work. It has been seen both by academics and industrial sources to have benefit including increase of work–life balance for employees, which in turns leads to increase in productivity for the employer or organization. Organizations hoping to adopt this form of working pattern for its employee should conduct research on how flexible working patterns can be successfully conducted, thus avoiding some of the expenses and pitfalls existing research has linked to flexible working practices.

== Flexible working time accounts ==
Flexible working time accounts are also known as deposited working-time accounts or work bank account systems. It is derived from the German Federal Labor Government&#x27;s reform program, which was passed by the German Federal Government on 21 August 2002. Then Federal Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, announced that the program would invite the former Director of Human Resources Management of Volkswagen, Peter Hartz, chaired the Labour Market Reform Committee. This program&#x27;s goal is to make the rigidity of the labor system more flexible and to change the old social welfare policy, in order to lighten heavy financial burden.

===Definitions===
The concept of flexible working time accounts is to establish labor-self accounts, and laborers can save their working hours, just like saving money, into their own accounts. The working hours in their accounts are their assets, so that employers and workers on both sides can increase or decrease the work required by each other without affecting salaries or welfare. While achieving the purpose of flexible labor, the account-system may be short-term, long or permanent for the convention.

===Characteristics===

A flexible working time account system has the following four characteristics:
# Flexible working time accounts shall be calculated for a period of at least one year.
# The calculation of a long-term account system is usually based on time and money. Occasionally, things may be passed on from other laborers&#x27; accounts. The situation is only applicable to short-term working time.
# When using long-term working time accounts, there are two features that can be used for classification:
## Optional long-term accounts are mostly used in the period that laborers are still holding a post in their own company. Laborers can withdraw from accounts after negotiating with employers, usually due to laborers&#x27; personal needs.
## Age-related long-term accounts can be used late into a laborer&#x27;s career, when they prepare for early retirement, semi-retirement, or conventional retirement.
# Unlike the short-term account system, there is the lowest-limit standard of withdrawing hours. However, standards are set in accordance with the differing demands of laborers.

<text>A ( , Ashkenazi pronunciation , plural: , , &quot;circumciser&quot;) is a Jewish man trained in the practice of , the &quot;covenant of male circumcision&quot;. Women who are trained in the practice are referred to as a &quot;mohelet&quot;.

==Etymology==

The noun ( in Aramaic), meaning &quot;circumciser&quot;, is derived from the same verb stem as (circumcision). The noun appeared for the first time in the 4th century as the title of a circumciser (Shabbat (Talmud) 156a).

==Origins of circumcision in Judaism==

For Jews, male circumcision is mandatory, as it is prescribed in the Torah. In the Book of Genesis, it is described as a mark of the covenant of the pieces between Yahweh and the descendants of Abraham: 

In Leviticus:
==Functions==
Biblically, the infant&#x27;s father () is commanded to perform the circumcision himself. However, as most fathers are not comfortable or do not have the training, they designate a or . are specially trained in circumcision and the rituals surrounding the procedure. Many are doctors or rabbis (some are both) or cantors, and today are required to receive appropriate training, both religious and medical.

Traditionally, use a scalpel to circumcise the newborn. Today, doctors and some non-Orthodox use a perforating clamp before they cut the skin. The clamp makes it easier to be precise and shortens recovery time. Orthodox have rejected perforating clamps, arguing that by crushing and killing the skin it causes a great amount of unnecessary pain to the newborn, cutting off the blood flow completely, which according to Jewish law is dangerous to the child and strictly forbidden, and also renders the (foreskin) as cut prior to the proper ritual cut.
Under Jewish law, must draw blood from the circumcision wound. Most do it by hand with a suction device, but some follow the traditional practice of doing it by mouth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning in 2012 about the health implications of the latter practice, citing eleven cases of neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) and two recorded fatalities. A 2013 review of cases of neonatal HSV infections in Israel identified ritual circumcision as the source of HSV-1 transmission in 31.8% of the cases.

Many continue the practice of listing the names and birthdates of the boys they circumcise in little booklets. These books have become important documents for genealogical scholarship. Increasingly, these notes on circumcision are being digitized.

==Women==
According to traditional Jewish law, if no Jewish male expert is available, a Jewish woman who has the required skills is also authorized to perform the circumcision. Non-Orthodox Judaism allows women to be (, plural of , , feminine of ), without restriction. In 1984, Deborah Cohen became the first Reform Jewish to be certified (by the Berit Mila Program of Reform Judaism).

==In popular culture==
* In the popular sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, a played by Charles Levin appears in the episode &quot;The Bris&quot;.
* In the parody film &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot;, Rabbi Tuckman (a parody of Friar Tuck, played by Mel Brooks) serves as Nottingham&#x27;s &quot;mohel extraordinaire&quot; using a miniature guillotine.
* &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s song Pretty Fly for a Rabbi, a parody of Pretty Fly (For a White Guy), contains the line &quot;The parents pay the mohel and he gets to keep the tip!&quot;
* In the &quot;Rugrats&quot; Hanukkah episode, the characters walk through the town center of ancient Israel past a shop titled advertising a &quot;cut rate&quot;
* Philip Sherman, one of the most prolific &quot;mohalim&quot; in the United States, was called America&#x27;s Top Mohel&quot; and &quot;the busiest mohel in New York&quot; in national and regional media

<text>A mutual bank is a cooperative financial institution owned by its depositors or customers. They include mutual organization, mutual savings banks and cooperative banking. Unlike traditional banks, which prioritize shareholder profits, mutual banks focus on serving their members&#x27; interests. They reinvest profits back into the institution to benefit customers, offer a range of banking services, and often have a community-oriented approach. Regulations around mutual banking vary by country.

<doc id="599122" wikidata="Q739221" url="?curid=599122" title="Astereognosis">
<text>Astereognosis (or tactile agnosia if only one hand is affected) is the inability to identify an object by active touch of the hands without other sensory input, such as visual or sensory information. An individual with astereognosis is unable to identify objects by handling them, despite intact elementary tactile, proprioceptive, and thermal sensation. With the absence of vision (i.e. eyes closed), an individual with astereognosis is unable to identify what is placed in their hand based on cues such as texture, size, spatial properties, and temperature. As opposed to agnosia, when the object is observed visually, one should be able to successfully identify the object.

Individuals with tactile agnosia may be able to identify the name, purpose, or origin of an object with their left hand but not their right, or vice versa, or both hands. Astereognosis refers specifically to those who lack tactile recognition in both hands. In the affected hand(s) they may be able to identify basic shapes such as pyramids and spheres (with abnormally high difficulty) but still not tactilely recognize common objects by easily recognizable and unique features such as a fork by its prongs (though the individual may report feeling a long, metal rod with multiple, pointy rods stemming off in uniform direction). These symptoms suggest that a very specific part of the brain is responsible for making the connections between tactile stimuli and functions/relationships of those stimuli, which, along with the relatively low impact this disorder has on a person&#x27;s quality of life, helps explain the rarity of reports and research of individuals with tactile agnosia.

Astereognosis is associated with lesions of the parietal lobe or dorsal column or parieto-temporo-occipital lobe (posterior association areas) of either the right or left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex. Despite cross-talk between the dorsal and ventral cortices, fMRI results suggest that those with ventral cortex damage are less sensitive to object 3D structure than those with dorsal cortex damage. Unlike the ventral cortex, the dorsal cortex can compute object representations. Thus, those with object recognition impairments are more likely to have acquired damage to the dorsal cortex.

While astereognosis is characterized by the lack of tactile recognition in both hands, it seems to be closely related to tactile agnosia (impairment connected to one hand). Tactile agnosia observations are rare and case-specific. Josef Gerstmann recounts his experience with patient JH, a 34-year-old infantryman who suffered a lesion to the posterior parietal lobe due to a gunshot. Following the injury, JH was unable to recognize or identify everyday objects by their meaning, origin, purpose and use with his left hand using tactile sensation alone. His motility performance, elementary sensitivity, and speech were intact, and he lacked abnormalities in brain nerves.

The majority of all objects JH touched with his left hand went unrecognized, but very simple objects (i.e. globes, pyramids, cube, etc.) were regularly recognized based on form alone. For more complex objects, his behavior and recognition varied daily based on his tactile resources that changed over time and depended on his fatigue. That is, JH’s ability to recognize depended on his concentration and ability to recognize simple forms and single qualities like size, shape, etc. With further interrogation and greater effort, he was able to correctly identify more specific features of an object (i.e. softness, rounded or cornered, broad or narrow) and could even draw a copy of it, but he was often left unable to identify the object by name, use, or origin. This behavioral deficit occurred even if JH had handled the object in his fully intact right hand.

Interventions tend to focus on helping these patients and their family and caregivers cope and adapt to the condition, and furthermore, to help patients function independently within their context.

<doc id="599125" wikidata="Q1888034" url="?curid=599125" title="The Delgados">
<text>The Delgados are a Scottish indie rock band formed in Glasgow in 1994. The band is composed of Alun Woodward (vocals, guitar), Emma Pollock (vocals, guitar), Stewart Henderson (bass guitar), and Paul Savage (drums).

==Biography==
The band was formed after friends Woodward, Henderson and Savage were ejected from the band Bubblegum. Joined by Savage&#x27;s then-girlfriend (and later wife) Pollock, the band named themselves after Pedro Delgado, a Spanish former professional road bicycle racer who won the 1988 Tour de France.

Their first commercial release came with the inclusion of their track &quot;Liquidation Girl&quot; on the compilation album &quot;Skookum Chief Powered Teenage Zit Rock Angst&quot; by Nardwuar. Instead of signing to a record label, the band started their own, Chemikal Underground, on which they released their own records and also some from other local bands, among them Mogwai and Arab Strap. Chemikal Underground&#x27;s first release was the Delgados first single &quot;Monica Webster&quot;/&quot;Brand New Car&quot;. The single caught the attention of BBC Radio 1 disc jockey (DJ) John Peel, and the band quickly became one of his favourites, going on to record seven sessions for his show.

The cost of Chemikal Underground&#x27;s second release, the single &quot;Disco Nation 45&quot; by Bis, left the cash-strapped label unable to afford another release by the Delgados, so their next release &quot;Lazarwalker&quot; came from the London-based Radar Records. Tempted by Radar to a five-album deal, the band declined, instead poaching their A&amp;R contact, Graeme Beattie, for work at Chemikal Underground.

Another single, &quot;Cinecentre&quot; followed in early 1996 as the band juggled work at the label with several tours, and recorded their debut studio album. The band released two more singles, this time taken from their album &quot;Domestiques&quot; (also a cycling reference) released in November 1996. The song &quot;Under Canvas, Under Wraps&quot; being voted number three in John Peel&#x27;s Festive Fifty that year.

The band released their second studio album in 1998, &quot;Peloton&quot; – another cycling reference. The single &quot;Pull the Wires from the Wall&quot; gave the Delgados their first charting single in the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 69. The band&#x27;s close relationship with Peel continued, with &quot;Pull the Wires from the Wall&quot; voted to number one in the Festive Fifty (it would also make the all time chart made in 2000).

The Delgados&#x27; evolution continued with &quot;The Great Eastern&quot; in 2000. The record was produced by Dave Fridmann. Their next single, &quot;American Trilogy&quot;, reached number 61 in the UK chart. The record was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize.

Their fourth studio album, &quot;Hate&quot;, was released on Mantra rather than the band&#x27;s own label. The song &quot;The Light Before We Land&quot; was used as the opening theme for the Japanese anime series &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot;, while the song &quot;Woke from Dreaming&quot; is played at the beginning of episode 7.

The band returned to their own label for their fifth and final studio album &quot;Universal Audio&quot; (2004).

The band announced they were splitting up in April 2005 due to the departure of Henderson who found it difficult &quot;to pour so much of my energy and time into something that never quite seemed to get the attention or respect [he] felt it deserved.&quot; The four will continue to run Chemikal Underground together. Songwriters Pollock and Woodward are pursuing individual projects, while Savage will continue production duties at the band&#x27;s Chem19 in a new studio.

Since the band&#x27;s separation, the track &quot;I Fought the Angels&quot; from &quot;Universal Audio&quot; has been used in the fourth episode in the second season of the Golden Globe Award-winning medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; in 2006, and in the opening scene in the series premiere of BBC Three&#x27;s &quot;Lip Service&quot; in 2010.

A double disc containing 29 tracks, &quot;The Complete BBC Peel Sessions&quot;, was released on 12 June 2006 in Europe, and later in the year in the United States. Woodward released his debut solo studio album in June 2009 under the name Lord Cut-Glass. Savage also played on the album.

In June 2022, the band announced that they had reformed and would play together for the first time in 17 years. A UK tour of five gigs, ending in their home city of Glasgow, is scheduled for January 2023. Further dates for festivals were later confirmed, including Primavera Sound (Spain) and Deer Shed (England).

<doc id="599137" wikidata="Q17090798" url="?curid=599137" title="Ohio Gang">
<text>The Ohio Gang was a gang of politicians and industry leaders closely surrounding Warren G. Harding, the 29th president of the United States. Many of these individuals came into Harding&#x27;s personal orbit during his tenure as a state-level politician in Ohio, hence the name. 

During the Harding administration, several members of the Ohio Gang became involved in financial scandals. These included the Teapot Dome scandal and apparent malfeasance at the U.S. Department of Justice, some of which ended in prison terms and a suicide. Following Harding&#x27;s sudden death of a heart attack in 1923, many members of the Ohio Gang were effectively removed from the corridors of power by Harding&#x27;s vice president and successor, Calvin Coolidge.

==Background==
Warren G. Harding was elected president by promising to return the nation to &quot;normalcy&quot;, and opposing the idealism of his predecessor Woodrow Wilson. He captured 60% of Americans’ votes and won by a landslide. After Harding had won the election, he appointed many of his allies and campaign contributors to powerful political positions in control of vast amounts of government money and resources.

Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty and Interior Secretary Albert B. Fall were considered to have been responsible for acts of corruption and cronyism.

Albert Fall was responsible for the Teapot Dome scandal. Teapot Dome was considered America&#x27;s biggest political scandal up until Watergate. The group met regularly at the infamous Little Green House on K Street. Also associated with the secret hide out was Jesse W. Smith who was said to have committed suicide because he faced scrutiny from Harding&#x27;s supporters about his activities.

There is no information that proves that Harding knew of the scandals that were going on during his time in office. He may not have learned much of it until the eve of his death. Fall was mainly responsible for the Teapot Dome scandal and was eventually jailed for taking bribes. Later President Coolidge forced the resignation of Daugherty for the same crimes.

===Internal opposition===

Not every member of the Harding administration was a member of the so-called &quot;Ohio Gang.&quot; Among the critics of the clique was Harding&#x27;s straitlaced Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, who while generally appreciative of Harding viewed the motivations and behavior of the Ohio Gang with thinly concealed disgust.

In his memoirs, published in 1952, Hoover depicted Harding&#x27;s Ohio cronies as a reflection of a character flaw:
[Harding] had another side which was not good. His political associates had been men of the type of Albert B. Fall, whom he appointed Secretary of the Interior; Daugherty, whom he appointed Attorney General; Forbes, whom he appointed Director of the Veterans&#x27; Bureau; Thomas W. Miller, whom he appointed Alien Property Custodian, and Jesse W. &quot;Jess&quot; Smith who had office room in the Department of Justice.
He enjoyed the company of these men and his old Ohio associates in and out of the government. Weekly White House poker parties were his greatest relaxation. The stakes were not large, but the play lasted most of the night... I had lived too long on the frontiers of the world to have strong emotions against people playing poker for money if they liked it, but it irked me to see it in the White House.

Although the religious Hoover was invited to the White House poker party only once and never invited back, he was nevertheless held in esteem by Harding, and he was abruptly added to the entourage for the President&#x27;s July 1923 trip to Alaska, which came in the wake of Jess Smith&#x27;s suicide.

Even as Harding prepared to leave Washington, DC, Hoover found him &quot;nervous and distraught,&quot; and his mood changed little on board ship to Alaska. Hoover later recalled:
One day after lunch when we were a few days out, Harding asked me to come to his cabin. He plumped at me the question: &quot;If you knew of a great scandal in our administration, would you for the good of the country and the party expose it publicly or would you bury it?&quot; My natural reply was &quot;Publish it, and at least get credit for integrity on your side.&quot; He remarked that this method might be politically dangerous. I asked for more particulars. He said that he had received some rumors of irregularities, centering around Smith, in connection with cases in the Department of Justice. He had followed the matter up and finally sent for Smith. After a painful session he told Smith that he would be arrested in the morning. Smith went home, burned all his papers, and committed suicide. Harding gave me no information about what Smith had been up to. I asked what Daugherty&#x27;s relations to the affair were. He abruptly dried up and never raised the question again.

During his Alaskan trip Harding suffered the first heart attack in what would prove to be his last days. Following Harding&#x27;s death, Hoover and his co-thinker, Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, approached new President Calvin Coolidge and asked him to remove prominent Ohio Gang member Daugherty as Attorney General. Harding&#x27;s death had done nothing to stem the tide of emerging scandals revolving around his Ohio clique, with the news dominated by the story of Teapot Dome bribery and allegations of wrongdoing in the Office of the Alien Property Custodian, the Veterans&#x27; Bureau, and the Office of the Attorney General.

Hoover recalled:
Coolidge was loath to believe that such things were possible. He greatly delayed the removal of Daugherty from the Cabinet. From this man&#x27;s long-time character, he should never have been in any government... Coolidge had a high sense of justice and asserted that he had no definite knowledge of wrongdoings by Daugherty and could not remove him on rumors. We urged that Daugherty had lost the confidence of the whole country and himself should be willing to retire for the good of public service.

Finally, on March 28, 1924, Coolidge requested and received a letter of resignation from Daugherty, effectively terminating the Ohio Gang&#x27;s last leading member.

The term &quot;Ohio Gang&quot;, while used as an epithet by some during the decade of the 1920s and subsequently, was embraced by others. In his 1932 memoir Harry Daugherty unabashedly declared:
&quot;...I was a true son of Ohio, the battle ground of the Nation. I frankly confess to a leadership in the so-called &#x27;Ohio Gang&#x27; for about forty years. On the lips of rival politicians the &#x27;Ohio Gang&#x27; is an epithet. I wear its badge as a mark of honor.&quot;

<text>Alizarine ink was created in 1855 by Professor Christian August Leonhardi of Dresden, Germany, by adding alizarin dye (derived from the root of the madder plant) to conventional iron gall ink. This added an attractive coloration to the ink, which was quite popular until it was replaced by more modern chemical inks.

An 1881 recipe for Alizarine ink may be found in the &quot;Household Cyclopedia of General Information&quot;.

<text>Pamela Bellwood (born Pamela King) is an American actress known for her role as Claudia Blaisdel Carrington on the 1980s prime time soap opera, &quot;Dynasty&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Bellwood became interested in an acting career when she portrayed Emily in &quot;Our Town&quot;. She studied acting in New York with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse, and in London. By 1972 she was on Broadway, taking over from Blythe Danner in &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot; and appearing with Barbara Bel Geddes in &quot;Finishing Touches&quot;. Her performance in &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot; earned her a Clarence Derwent Award in 1972.

Early on, Bellwood was credited as Pamela Kingsley because there was already a working actress named Pamela King. In 1974, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers&quot;. Later in 1974, she appeared as Jill Martin in an episode of &quot;Rhoda&quot; entitled &quot;9-E is available&quot;. In 1978, she played the starring role of TV executive Ellen Cunningham in &quot;W.E.B.&quot;, an NBC drama about a fictional television network. Poor ratings led to the show being cancelled after only five episodes.

Bellwood was an original cast member of &quot;Dynasty&quot; in January 1981, and was written out of the series early in the third season, in late 1982. She appeared once in March 1983 to help usher in Jack Coleman as a recast Steven Carrington, and later returned full-time in October 1983. She remained a key character for several seasons until leaving the series a final time in 1986 to become a full-time mother. 20 years later, in 2006, she appeared with her former &quot;Dynasty&quot; castmates in the non-fiction special &quot;Dynasty Reunion: Catfights &amp; Caviar&quot;.

Bellwood posed for an eight-page pictorial in the April 1983 edition of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

She also appeared in such films as &quot;Two-Minute Warning&quot;, &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; and &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot;, as well as a number of TV movies. She continues to perform in film and on stage. She is now known and often credited as Pamela Bellwood-Wheeler.

==Personal life==
In the early 1970s, Bellwood was married to writer Peter Bellwood. In 1984, she married photographer Nik Wheeler.

<doc id="599152" wikidata="Q1415489" url="?curid=599152" title="Managed float regime">
<text>A managed float regime, also known as a dirty float, is a type of exchange rate regime where a currency&#x27;s value is allowed to fluctuate in response to foreign-exchange market mechanisms (i.e., supply and demand), but the central bank or monetary authority of the country intervenes occasionally to stabilize or steer the currency&#x27;s value in a particular direction. This is in contrast to a pure float where the value is entirely determined by market forces, and a fixed exchange rate where the value is pegged to another currency or a basket of currencies.

Under a managed float regime, the central bank might buy or sell its own currency in the foreign exchange market to counteract short-term fluctuations, to prevent excessive depreciation or appreciation, or to achieve certain economic goals such as controlling inflation or boosting exports.

In an increasingly integrated world economy, the currency rates impact any given country&#x27;s economy through the trade balance. In this aspect, almost all currencies are &quot;managed&quot; since central banks or governments intervene to influence the value of their currencies. According to the International Monetary Fund, as of 2013, 82 countries and regions used a managed float, or 43% of all countries, constituting a plurality amongst exchange rate regime types.

International financial organizations, like the IMF, categorize countries&#x27; exchange rate regimes based on specific criteria, but these classifications aren&#x27;t necessarily objective and may not fully capture the nuances of a country&#x27;s exchange rate policies. For example, a country may normally have a floating exchange rate regime but intervene in times of extreme volatility, a country may formally claim to be following one exchange rate regime (de jure) while having another in practice (de facto).

For more detail on each country&#x27;s exchange rate regime, it is recommended to read IMF&#x27;s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions.

==Countries with managed floating currencies==

The below is a list of countries where, in 2022, the IMF has classified the regime as &quot;Other managed arrangement&quot; or &quot;Stablized arrangement&quot;, or where the IMF states that the &quot;de jure&quot; arrangement is a managed float. The IMF reclassifies the countries frequently based on the actions of their central banks.

In its annual report, the IMF also notes instances where central banks have intervened, even for countries where it still classifies the currency as free floating. For instance, the Japanese Ministry of Finance, it notes, has &quot;intervened in the foreign exchange market in September 22, October 21, and October 24, 2022, to address excess volatility and disorderly exchange rate movement for the first time since 2011&quot;.

<doc id="599157" wikidata="Q7601939" url="?curid=599157" title="Stark's ink">
<text>Stark&#x27;s ink is one of a number of types of homemade inks whose recipes were widely available in the 19th century. People often made their own ink before 
commercially available ink was inexpensively and easily obtainable.
James Stark was a chemist during the 19th century who experimented with ink recipes for 23 years. He tested 229 recipes for their durability on various kinds of paper to find the most stable iron gall ink recipe. He submitted his findings in 1855 to the Society of Arts in Edinburgh, Scotland. This recipe was the one he personally used.

== Recipe ==
This iron gall ink recipe is taken from the &quot;Household Cyclopedia of General Information&quot;, published in 1881. It is not in common use now, though the preparation of inks with similar methods was common at one time. 
:Recipe for of ink:
:*, nut-galls
:*, sulfate of indigo 
:*, copperas
:* of gum arabic
:*A few cloves

The addition of the sulfate of indigo renders the ink less stable on the page and prone to premature browning over time, but less liable to mould in the inkwell. It is blue when first written with, but soon becomes an intense black.

The ink can be made without the sulfate of indigo, which will make it considerably less expensive yet more archival. Without it, the ink will appear pale initially then quickly blacken as it dries. The ink is very permanent and waterproof.

<doc id="599178" wikidata="Q188843" url="?curid=599178" title="Cosmopolitanism">
<text>Cosmopolitanism is the idea that all human beings are members of a single community. Its adherents are known as cosmopolitan or cosmopolite. Cosmopolitanism is both prescriptive and aspirational, believing humans can and should be &quot;world citizens&quot; in a &quot;universal community&quot;. The idea encompasses different dimensions and avenues of community, such as promoting universal moral standards, establishing global political structures, or developing a platform for mutual cultural expression and tolerance.

For example, Kwame Anthony Appiah articulates a cosmopolitan community where individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.). In a looser but related sense, &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; is also used to describe places where people of various ethnic, cultural and/or religious backgrounds live together and interact with each other.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the , or &quot;kosmopolitês&quot;, formed from &quot;&quot;, &quot;kosmos&quot;, i.e. &quot;world&quot;, &quot;universe&quot;, or &quot;cosmos&quot;, and , &quot;politês&quot;, i.e. &quot;citizen&quot; or &quot;[one] of a city&quot;. Contemporary usage defines the term as &quot;citizen of the world&quot;.

==Definitions==
Definitions of cosmopolitanism usually begin with the Greek etymology of &quot;citizen of the world&quot;. However, as Appiah points out, &quot;world&quot; in the original sense meant &quot;cosmos&quot; or &quot;universe&quot;, not earth or globe as current use assumes.

In the United States, two forms of cosmopolitanism have been established. For one, there is a political cosmopolitan nationalism that has defined and constructed other races. On the other hand, ethno-cultural cosmopolitanism that celebrates multiculturalism has benefited from an upswing in the United States after World War II. A definition of cosmopolitanism that handles this issue is given in a recent book on political globalization:

Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality.
The ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi in preserved scripts said that &quot;universal love and mutual benefit&quot; could be attained &quot;to regard other people&#x27;s countries as one&#x27;s own&quot;. The Chinese term &quot;tianxia&quot; (all under Heaven), a metonym for empire, has also been re-interpreted in the modern age as a conception of cosmopolitanism, and was used by 1930s modernists as the title of a Shanghai-based, English-language journal of world arts and letters &quot;T&#x27;ien Hsia Monthly&quot;.

==Philosophical==
===Philosophical roots===

Cosmopolitanism can be traced back to Diogenes of Sinope (), the founder of the Cynic movement in Ancient Greece. It was said that when Diogenes was &quot;Asked where he came from, he answered: &#x27;I am a citizen of the world (&quot;kosmopolitês&quot;)&#x27;&quot;. At the time, the broadest basis of social identity among Greeks was either the individual city-state or the culturally and linguistically homogeneous &quot;Hellenic&quot; group.

Stoicism, another Greek school of thought that was founded roughly a century later, built upon Diogenes&#x27; idea, with many of its thinkers and adherents stressing that each human being &quot;dwells [...] in two communities – the local community of our birth, and the community of human argument and aspiration&quot;. A common way to understand Stoic cosmopolitanism is through Hierocles&#x27; circle model of identity, which states that individuals should regard themselves as concentric circles: the first one around the self, followed by immediate family, extended family, local group, citizens, countrymen, humanity. Within these circles human beings feel a sense of &quot;affinity&quot; or &quot;endearment&quot; towards others, which the Stoics termed &quot;Oikeiôsis&quot;. The task of world citizens becomes then to &quot;draw the circles somehow towards the centre, making all human beings more like our fellow city dwellers, and so forth&quot;.

===Modern cosmopolitan thinkers===
In his 1795 essay &quot;Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch&quot;, Immanuel Kant stages a &quot;ius cosmopoliticum&quot; (cosmopolitan law/right) as a guiding principle to help global society achieve permanent, enduring peace. Kant&#x27;s cosmopolitan right stems from an understanding of all human beings as equal members of a universal community. Cosmopolitan right thus works in tandem with international political rights, and the shared, universal right of humanity.

Kant&#x27;s cosmopolitan right is fundamentally bound to the conditions of universal hospitality and the right of resort. Universal hospitality is defined as the right to be welcomed upon arrival in foreign territory, but is contingent on a guest arriving in a peaceful manner. Kant makes the additional claim that all human beings have the basic right of resort: the right to present oneself in a foreign land. The right of resort is derived from Kant&#x27;s understanding of the Earth&#x27;s surface as essentially communal, and further emphasizing his claims on equally shared universal rights among all human beings.

The philosophical concepts of Emmanuel Levinas, on ethics, and Jacques Derrida, on hospitality, provide a theoretical framework for the relationships between people in their everyday lives and apart from any form of written laws or codes. For Levinas, the foundation of ethics consists in the obligation to respond to the Other. In Being for the Other, he writes that there is no &quot;universal moral law,&quot; only the sense of responsibility (goodness, mercy, charity) that the Other, in a state of vulnerability, calls forth. The proximity of the Other is an important part of Levinas&#x27;s concept: the face of the Other is what compels the response.

For Derrida, the foundation of ethics is hospitality, the readiness and the inclination to welcome the Other into one&#x27;s home. Ethics, he claims, is hospitality. Pure, unconditional hospitality is a desire that underscores the conditional hospitality necessary in our relationships with others. Levinas&#x27;s and Derrida&#x27;s theories of ethics and hospitality hold out the possibility of an acceptance of the Other as different but of equal standing. Isolation is not a feasible alternative in the world, therefore, it is important to consider how best to approach these interactions, and to determine what is at stake for ourselves and the others: what conditions of hospitality to impose, and whether or not we have responded to the call of the Other. Further, both theories reveal the importance of considering how best to interact with the Other and others, and what is at stake.

Derrida in an interview with Bennington (1997) summarized &quot;cosmopolitanism&quot;,
A further state of cosmopolitanism occurred after the Second World War. As a reaction to the Holocaust and other atrocities, the concept of crimes against humanity became a generally accepted category in international law. This clearly shows the appearance and acceptance of a notion of individual responsibility that is considered to exist toward all of humankind.

Philosophical cosmopolitans are moral universalists: they believe that all humans, and not merely compatriots or fellow-citizens, come under the same moral standards. The boundaries between nations, states, cultures or societies are therefore morally irrelevant. A widely cited example of a contemporary cosmopolitan is Kwame Anthony Appiah.

Some philosophers and scholars argue that the objective and subjective conditions arising in today&#x27;s unique historical moment, an emerging planetary phase of civilization, creates a latent potential for the emergence of a cosmopolitan identity as global citizens and possible formation of a global citizens movement. These emerging objective and subjective conditions in the planetary phase include improved and affordable telecommunications; space travel and the first images of our fragile planet floating in the vastness of space; the emergence of global warming and other ecological threats to our collective existence; new global institutions such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, or International Criminal Court; the rise of transnational corporations and integration of markets often termed economic globalization; the emergence of global NGOs and transnational social movements, such as the World Social Forum; and so on. Globalization, a more common term, typically refers more narrowly to the economic and trade relations and misses the broader cultural, social, political, environmental, demographic, values and knowledge transitions taking place.

===Contemporary cosmopolitan thinkers===
Thich Nhat Hanh discusses what he calls &quot;Interbeing&quot; as a way of living one&#x27;s life in relation to others; &quot;Interbeing&quot; might easily be compared to cosmopolitanism. Nhat Hanh&#x27;s philosophical beliefs are grounded in the precepts of Buddhist teachings, which involve compassion and understanding to protect and live in harmony with all people, animals, plants, and minerals. He further describes what he calls &quot;Mindfulness Training of the Order of Interbeing&quot; as being aware of sufferings created by, but not limited to, the following causes: fanaticism and intolerances that disrupt compassion and living in harmony with others; indoctrination of narrow-minded beliefs; imposition of views; anger; and miscommunication. Understanding and compassion for others seems to be achieved by the understanding of others&#x27; suffering and the root causes of suffering. Therefore, to be responsible is to recognize and understand suffering, which then leads to compassion. It is through this process that others can be recognized as people.

Other theorists, philosophers, and activists contend that recognizing suffering is necessary to end violence. In &quot;Scared Sacred&quot;, Velcrow Ripper takes a journey to different sites of great suffering that ultimately leads him toward developing compassion. In &quot;The Planet&quot;, Paul Gilroy explores how the construction and naturalization of race and the hierarchies produced by difference shape the hatred of others. It is the deconstruction of these ideologies that can lead to the compassion and humanization of others. Thus individual responsibility is being aware of what Judith Butler calls the precariousness of life in self and other; being a cosmopolitan seems to be, above all, a social, ethical enterprise.

In &quot;Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers&quot;, Kwame Anthony Appiah notes how social ethics seem to operate: Whatever obligation one might have to another, especially a foreign other, that obligation does not supersede the obligations one has to those people most familiar to them. However, as Judith Butler questions, &quot;at what cost do I establish the familiar as the criterion&quot; for valuing others? If one values the familiar more than the foreign, what are the consequences? Paul Gilroy offers a possible alternative to this emphasis on familiarity arguing that &quot;methodical cultivation of a degree of estrangement from one&#x27;s own culture and history ... might qualify as essential to a cosmopolitan commitment.&quot; This estrangement entails a &quot;process of exposure to otherness&quot; in order to foster &quot;the irreducible value of diversity within sameness.&quot;

For Gilroy, being cosmopolitan seems to involve both a social, ethical enterprise and a cultural enterprise. In &quot;The Planet&quot;, Gilroy describes the cases of Tom Hurndall and Rachel Corrie; each seems to exemplify what might be considered Gilroy&#x27;s figure of the cosmopolitan. Both Hurndall and Corrie removed themselves (geographically) from their home cultures, presumably both physically and mentally estranging themselves from their own cultures and histories. Hurndall and Corrie were both killed in 2003 (in separate incidents). Gilroy&#x27;s model of estrangement might actually undermine itself through its examples; this might be construed as a failure of Gilroy&#x27;s theory to address the practical difficulties of estranging oneself from the familiar.

The Venus Project, an international, multidisciplinary educational organization created by Jacque Fresco, works to spread cosmopolitan ideas by transcending artificial boundaries currently separating people and emphasizing an understanding of our interdependence with nature and each other.

Some forms of cosmopolitanism also fail to address the potential for economic colonization by powerful countries over less powerful ones. Frantz Fanon, in &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot;, observes that when nations achieved independence from European colonizers, frequently there was no system in place to secure their economic future, and they became &quot;manager[s] for Western enterprise...in practise set[ting] up its country as the brothel of Europe.&quot; When &quot;third world&quot; nations are drawn into economic partnerships with global capital, ostensibly to improve their national quality of life, often the only ones benefitting from this partnership are well-placed individuals and not the nation itself. Others highlighted the importance of moving beyond Western liberal values. Drawing on classical realism, they consider liberalism insufficient to promote equality between nations, breaking the iron laws of competition between states; instead, they look at Byzantine and other pre-modern cultures. Likewise, Mahmood Mamdani in &quot;Good Muslim, Bad Muslim&quot; suggests that the imposition of Western cultural norms, democracy and Christianity to name only two, has historically resulted in nationalist violence; however, Appiah has implied that democracy is a pre-requisite for cosmopolitan intervention in developing nations.

Much of the political thinking of the last two centuries has taken nationalism and the framework of the sovereign nation-state for granted. With the advance of globalization and the increased facility of travel and communication, some thinkers consider that the political system based on the nation-state has become obsolete and that it is time to design a better and more efficient alternative. Jesús Mosterín analyzes how the world political system should be organized in order to maximize individual freedom and individual opportunity. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social interaction.

Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) in the name of the nation, the church, or the party. From this point of view, the Internet provides a much more attractive model than the nation-state. Neither is there any just reason for restraining the free circulation of people, ideas, or goods. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without sovereign nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.

Criticizing the abstract nature of most versions of cosmopolitanism, Charles Blattberg has argued that any viable cosmopolitanism must be &quot;rooted,&quot; by which he means based upon a &quot;global patriotism.&quot;

More general philosophical reviews of cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism are also available. Carol Nicholson compares John Searle&#x27;s opposition to multiculturalism with Charles Taylor&#x27;s celebration of it. She uses Richard Rorty as a triangulation point in that he remains neutral about multiculturalism, but his philosophical analysis of truth and practice can be deployed to argue against Searle and in favor of Taylor. At a conference on &quot;Philosophy in a Multicultural Context&quot;, Rasmus Winther excavated the philosophical assumptions and practices connected with cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism. He develops Bruno Latour&#x27;s conception of the philosopher as public diplomat.

==Political and sociological==
Emile Durkheim (1858–1917) observed the development of what he called the &#x27;cult of the individual&#x27;, which is a new religion that replaced the Christianity that was dying out, and which is centered around the sacredness of human dignity. This new religion would provide the new foundations of Western society, and these foundations are closely related to human rights and individual nation&#x27;s constitutions. A society&#x27;s sacred object would be the individual&#x27;s human dignity, and the moral code guiding the society is found in that country&#x27;s way of interpreting human dignity and human rights. Thus, rather than finding solidarity through national culture, or a particular traditional religious doctrine, society would be unified by its adherence to political values, i.e. individual rights and a defence of human dignity. Durkheim&#x27;s cult of the individual has many similarities to John Rawls&#x27; political liberalism, which Rawls developed almost a century after Durkheim.

In his posthumously published (1957) &quot;Professional Ethics and Civic Morals&quot; Durkheim wrote that:

Ulrich Beck (May 15, 1944 – January 1, 2015) was a sociologist who posed the new concept of cosmopolitan critical theory in direct opposition to traditional nation-state politics. Nation-state theory sees power relations only among different state actors, and excludes a global economy, or subjugates it to the nation-state model. Cosmopolitanism sees global capital as a possible threat to the nation state and places it within a meta-power game in which global capital, states and civil society are its players.

It is important to mark a distinction between Beck&#x27;s cosmopolitanism and the idea of a world state. For Beck, imposing a single world order was considered hegemonic at best and ethnocentric at worst. Rather, political and sociological cosmopolitanism rests upon these fundamental foundations:
* &quot;Acknowledging the otherness of those who are culturally different&quot;
* &quot;Acknowledging the otherness of the future&quot;
* &quot;Acknowledging the otherness of nature&quot;
* &quot;Acknowledging the otherness of the object&quot;
* &quot;Acknowledging the otherness of other rationalities&quot;

A number of philosophers, including Emmanuel Levinas, have introduced the concept of the &quot;Other&quot;. For Levinas, the Other is given context in ethics and responsibility; we should think of the Other as anyone and everyone outside ourselves. According to Levinas, our initial interactions with the Other occur before we form a will—the ability to make choices. The Other addresses us and we respond: even the absence of response is a response. We are thus conditioned by the Other&#x27;s address and begin to form culture and identity. After the formation of the will, we choose whether to identify with the addresses by others and, as a result, continue the process of forming identity.

During this process, it is possible to recognize ourselves in our interactions with Others. Even in situations where we engage in the most minimal interaction, we ascribe identities to others and simultaneously to ourselves. Our dependence on the Other for the continuous formation of language, culture, and identity means that we are responsible to others and that they are responsible to us. Also once we&#x27;ve formed a will, it becomes possible to recognize this social interdependence. When we have gained the capacity for recognition, the imperative is to perform that recognition and thereby become ethically responsible to the Other in conscience.

Cosmopolitanism shares some aspects of universalism – namely the globally acceptable notion of human dignity that must be protected and enshrined in international law. However, the theory deviates in recognising the differences between world cultures.

In addition, cosmopolitanism calls for equal protection of the environment and against the negative side effects of technological development. Human dignity, however, is convoluted because it is necessary to first distinguish who has the right to be respected and second to consider what rights are protectable. Under cosmopolitanism, all humans have rights; however, history shows that recognition of these rights is not guaranteed.

As an example, Judith Butler discusses a Western discourse of &quot;human&quot; in &quot;Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence&quot;. Butler works through the idea of &quot;human&quot; and notes that &quot;human&quot; has been &quot;naturalized in its &#x27;Western&#x27; mold by the contemporary workings of humanism&quot; (32). Thus, there is the idea that not all &quot;human&quot; lives will be supported in the same way, indeed, that some human lives are worth more protection than others. Others have extended this idea to examine how animals might be reconfigured as cosmopolitan, present the world-over with varying identities in different places.

This idea is reiterated in Sunera Thobani&#x27;s &quot;Exalted Subjects: Studies in the Making of Race and Nation in Canada,&quot; where she discusses a discourse in which Muslim people fall into a good/bad dichotomy: a &quot;good Muslim&quot; is one who has been Westernized and a &quot;bad Muslim&quot; is one who visibly rejects Western cultural influences. Thobani notes that it is through media representations that these ideas become naturalized. Individuals who embrace Western ideals are considered fully &quot;human&quot; and are more likely to be afforded dignity and protection than those who defend their non-Westernized cultural identities.

According to those who follow Beck&#x27;s reasoning, a cosmopolitan world would consist of a plurality of states, which would use global and regional consensus to gain greater bargaining power against opponents. States would also utilize the power of civil society actors such as Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and consumers to strengthen their legitimacy and enlist the help of investors to pursue a cosmopolitan agenda.

Other authors imagine a cosmopolitan world moving beyond today&#x27;s conception of nation-states. These scholars argue that a truly cosmopolitan identity within global citizenship will take hold, diminishing the importance of national identities. The formation of a global citizens movement would lead to the establishment of democratic global institutions, creating the space for global political discourse and decisions, would in turn reinforce the notion of citizenship at a global level. Nested structures of governance balancing the principles of irreducibility (i.e., the notion that certain problems can only be addressed at the global level, such as global warming) and subsidiarity (i.e., the notion that decisions should be made at as local a level possible) would thus form the basis for a cosmopolitan political order.

Daniele Archibugi proposes a renewed model for global citizenship: institutional cosmopolitanism. It advocates some reforms in global governance to allow world citizens to take more directly a part into political life. A number of proposals have been made in order to make this possible. Cosmopolitan democracy, for example, suggests strengthening the United Nations and other international organizations by creating a World Parliamentary Assembly.

==Criticism==

&quot;Cosmopolitanism&quot; became a rhetorical weapon used by nationalists against &quot;alien&quot; ideas that went counter to orthodoxy. European Jews were frequently accused of being &quot;rootless cosmopolitans.&quot; Joseph Stalin in a 1946 Moscow speech attacked writings in which &quot;the positive Soviet hero is derided and inferior before all things foreign and cosmopolitanism that we all fought against from the time of Lenin, characteristic of the political leftovers, is many times applauded.&quot;

In the German Democratic Republic, cosmopolitanism was characterized as a bourgeois-imperialist ideology that rejects the nations&#x27; right to independence and national sovereignty. Cosmopolitanism was said to promote the dismantling of national and patriotic traditions and national culture. It was said to be advocated by the Anglo-American imperialism with an aim to establish world hegemony (World Government) operating in the interests of monopoly capitalism. Its opposite was not chauvinist bourgeois nationalism, but patriotism; love of one&#x27;s native place, one&#x27;s country. Love of the homeland was said to be one of the deepest feelings of the working people, expressed in the struggle against conquerors and oppressors. Television journalist Jeff Greenfield believes that in the 21st century cosmopolitanism was viewed by Vladimir Putin as a threat to Russian nationalism, and also by nationalists in Hungary and Poland. In modern times, Stephen Miller, a Trump administration senior policy advisor, publicly criticized CNN reporter Jim Acosta as exhibiting &quot;cosmopolitan bias&quot; during a discussion on the government&#x27;s new immigration plan.

<doc id="599189" wikidata="Q873000" url="?curid=599189" title="Canzone">
<text>Literally &quot;song&quot; in Italian, a  (; : &quot;canzoni&quot;; cognate with English &quot;to chant&quot;) is an Italian or Provençal song or ballad. It is also used to describe a type of lyric which resembles a madrigal. Sometimes a composition which is simple and songlike is designated as a canzone, especially if it is by a non-Italian; a good example is the aria &quot;Voi che sapete&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s Marriage of Figaro.

The term &quot;canzone&quot; is also used interchangeably with canzona, an important Italian instrumental form of the late 16th and early 17th century. Often works designated as such are &quot;canzoni da sonar&quot;; these pieces are an important precursor to the sonata. Terminology was lax in the late Renaissance and early Baroque music periods, and what one composer might call &quot;canzoni da sonar&quot; might be termed &quot;canzona&quot; by another, or even &quot;fantasia&quot;. In the work of some composers, such as Paolo Quagliati, the terms seem to have had no formal implication at all.

Derived from the Provençal &quot;canso&quot;, the very lyrical and original Italian canzone consists of 5 to 7 stanzas typically set to music, each stanza resounding the first in rhyme scheme and in number of lines (7 to 20 lines). The canzone is typically hendecasyllabic (11 syllables). The &quot;congedo&quot; or &quot;commiato&quot; also forms the pattern of the Provençal &quot;tornado&quot;, known as the French &quot;envoi&quot;, addressing the poem itself or directing it to the mission of a character, originally a personage. Originally delivered at the Sicilian court of Emperor Frederick II during the 13th century of the Middle Ages, the lyrical form was later commanded by Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, and leading Renaissance writers such as Spenser (the marriage hymn in his &quot;Epithalamion&quot;).
The canzone (German: &quot;Kanzone&quot;) is the characteristic strophic form of , the Middle High German lyric genre. In , the canzone follows the tri-partite structure of the Provençal &quot;canso&quot;: two metrically identical (&quot;supports&quot;) form the (literally &quot;up-song&quot;), which is followed by a metrically distinct (&quot;down-song&quot;). The following rules generally apply:
* each line in the first rhymes with the matching line in the second
* the introduces new rhymes and may contain a non-rhyming line
* the is longer than a single but shorter than the entire .

This basic pattern is typical of early . As the genre develops, more complex forms are found. For example, one of Neithart&#x27;s Winter Songs, &quot;Winder, dîniu meil&quot; (No. 32), has a 14-line canzone with the rhyme scheme a b c d | a b c d || e e f g f g.

The earliest canzone in date from the late 12th Century and are part of the more general influence of the Romance lyric.

<text>Octavo, a Latin word meaning &quot;in eighth&quot; or &quot;for the eighth time&quot;, (abbreviated 8vo, 8º, or In-8) is a technical term describing the format of a book, which refers to the size of leaves produced from folding a full sheet of paper on which multiple pages of text were printed to form the individual sections (or &quot;gatherings&quot;) of a book. An octavo is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets (e.g. of A2 paper) on which 16 pages of text were printed, which were then folded three times to produce eight leaves. Each leaf of an octavo book thus represents one eighth the size of the original sheet. Other common book formats are folios and quartos. &quot;Octavo&quot; is also used as a general description of the &quot;size&quot; of books that are about tall (almost A4 paper size), and as such does not necessarily indicate the actual printing format of the books, which may even be unknown as is the case for many modern books. These terms are discussed in greater detail in book sizes.

==Format==
An octavo is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper on which 16 pages of text were printed, which were then folded three times to produce eight leaves. Each leaf of an octavo book thus represents one eighth the size of the original sheet.

There are many variations in how octavos were produced. For example, bibliographers call a book printed as an octavo (eight leaves per full sheet), but bound in gatherings of 4 leaves each, an &quot;octavo in 4s.&quot;

The actual size of an octavo book depends on the size of the full sheet of paper on which it was printed. The size of such sheets varied in different localities and times. A sixteenth century octavo printed in France or Italy is about the size of a modern cheap paperback, whereas an eighteenth-century octavo printed in England is larger, about the size of a modern hardcover novel.

The Gutenberg Bible was printed as a folio in about 1455, in which four pages of text were printed on each sheet of paper, which were then folded once. Several such folded conjugate pairs of leaves were inserted inside another to produce the sections or gatherings, which were then sewn together to form the final book.

=== History ===
The oldest surviving octavo book apparently is the so-called &quot;Turkish calendar&quot; for 1455, presumably printed in late 1454, about the same time as the Gutenberg Bible. Numerous other octavos survive beginning from about 1461. The British Library Incunabula Short Title Catalogue currently lists about 28,100 different editions of surviving books, pamphlets and broadsides (some fragmentary only) printed before 1501 of which about 2,850 are octavos, representing 10 percent of all works in the catalog.

Johann Froben was the first in 1491 to print Bible in octavo and with illustration, his edition became known as &quot;Poor man&#x27;s Bible&quot; due to its affordability. Beginning in 1501, Aldus Manutius of Venice began to print classical works in small octavo format which were easily portable. These editions contained only the text of the works, without the commentary and notes, and became very popular with educated readers. As a result, Aldus became closely associated with the octavo format.

==Size==
Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, technology permitted the manufacture of large sheets or rolls of paper on which books were printed, many text pages at a time. As a result, it may be impossible to determine the actual format (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the number of leaves formed from each sheet fed into a press). The term &quot;octavo&quot; as applied to such books may refer simply to the size of the book. The use of the term &quot;octavo&quot; as applied to such books refers to books which are generally between tall, the most common size for modern hardbound books. More specific sizes are denoted by reference to certain paper sizes as follows:

*Foolscap octavo, 
*Crown octavo 
*Demy octavo, 
*Globe octavo, ? × ?
*Royal octavo,

<text>A witch doctor (also spelled witch-doctor), or witchcraft doctor, is a kind of magical healer who treats ailments believed to be caused by witchcraft. The term is often misunderstood, and they could more accurately be called &quot;anti-witch doctors&quot;. The term is now more commonly used to refer to healers, particularly in regions which use traditional healing rather than contemporary medicine.

==Original meaning of the term==
In its original meaning, witch doctors were not exactly witches themselves, but rather people who had remedies to protect others against witchcraft.

Witchcraft-induced conditions were their area of expertise, as described in this 1858 news report from England:

Recourse was had by the girl&#x27;s parents to a cunning man, named Burrell, residing at Copford, who has long borne the name of &quot;The Wizard of the North:&quot; but her case was of so peculiar a character as to baffle his skill to dissolve the spell, Application was next made to a witch doctor named Murrell, residing at Hadleigh, Essex, who undertook to effect a cure, giving a bottle of medication, for which he did not forget to charge 3s. 6d., and promising to pay a visit on Monday evening to the &quot;old witch,&quot; Mrs. Mole, and put an end to her subtle arts...

...the news of the expected coming of the witch-doctor spread far and wide, and about eight o&#x27;clock there could not have been less than 200 people collected near the cottage of Mrs. Mole to witness the supernatural powers of the Hadleigh wizard.

==In Europe==

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the first record of the use of this term was in 1718, in Francis Hutchinson&#x27;s work &quot;An Historical Essay concerning Witchcraft, with Observations upon Matters of Fact; Tending to Clear the Texts of the Sacred Scriptures, and Confute the Vulgar Errors about that Point.&quot; Hutchinson used the phrase in a chapter defending a prisoner who was charged with witchcraft, by asserting that the &quot;Witch-Doctor&quot; himself was the one using sorcery:
The said Dorothy Durent, having been with a Witch-Doctor, acknowledges upon Oath, that by his Advice she hang&#x27;d up her Child&#x27;s Blanket in the Chimney, found a Toad in it at Night, had put it into the Fire, and held it there tho&#x27; it made a great and horrible Noise, and flash&#x27;d like Gunpowder, and went off like a Pistol, and then became invisible, and that by this the Prisoner was scorch&#x27;d and burn&#x27;d lamentably. 
Charles Mackay&#x27;s book, &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot;, first published in 1841, attests to the practice of belief in witch doctors in England at the time.

In the north of England, the superstition lingers to an almost inconceivable extent. Lancashire abounds with witch-doctors, a set of quacks, who pretend to cure diseases inflicted by the devil. The practices of these worthies may be judged of by the following case, reported in the &quot;Hertford Reformer,&quot; of the 23rd of June, 1838. The witch-doctor alluded to is better known by the name of the cunning man, and has a large practice in the counties of Lincoln and Nottingham. According to the writer in &quot;The Reformer,&quot; the dupe, whose name is not mentioned, had been for about two years afflicted with a painful abscess and had been prescribed for without relief by more than one medical gentleman. He was urged by some of his friends, not only in his own village but in neighbouring ones, to consult the witch-doctor, as they were convinced he was under some evil influence. He agreed and sent his wife to the cunning man, who lived in New Saint Swithin&#x27;s, in Lincoln. She was informed by this ignorant impostor that her husband&#x27;s disorder was an infliction of the devil, occasioned by his next-door neighbours, who had made use of certain charms for that purpose. From the description he gave of the process, it appears to be the same as that employed by Dr. Fian and Gellie Duncan, to work woe upon King James. He stated that the neighbours, instigated by a witch, whom he pointed out, took some wax, and moulded it before the fire into the form of her husband, as near as they could represent him; they then pierced the image with pins on all sides – repeated the Lord&#x27;s Prayer backwards, and offered prayers to the devil that he would fix his stings into the person whom that figure represented, in like manner as they pierced it with pins. To counteract the effects of this diabolical process, the witch-doctor prescribed a certain medicine, and a charm to be worn next to the body, on that part where the disease principally lay. The patient was to repeat the 109th and 119th Psalms every day, or the cure would not be effectual. The fee which he claimed for this advice was a guinea.
==In Africa==

In southern Africa, traditional healers are known as &quot;sangomas&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the first use of the term &quot;witch doctor&quot; to refer to African shamans (i.e. medicine men) was in 1836 in a book by Robert Montgomery Martin.

BBC News reported, on March 12, 2015, that, &quot;More than 200 witchdoctors and traditional healers have been arrested in Tanzania in a crackdown on the murder of albino people. 
The killings have been driven by the belief – advanced by some witchdoctors – that the body parts have properties that confer wealth and good luck. According to the Red Cross, witchdoctors are prepared to pay $75,000 (£57,000) for a complete set of albino body parts. Nearly 80 albino Tanzanians have been killed since 2000, the UN says. The latest victims include a one-year-old albino boy, killed in north-western Tanzania. The government banned witchdoctors in January 2015 as part of its efforts to prevent further attacks and kidnappings targeting people with albinism.&quot;

== In Nepal and Northeastern India ==
&quot;Jhākri&quot; () is the Nepali word for shaman. It is sometimes reserved specifically for practitioners of Nepali shamanism, such as that practiced among the Tamang people and the Magars; it is also used in the Indian states of Sikkim and West Bengal, which border Nepal.

Jhākri shamanism is practiced among numerous ethnic groups of Nepal and Northeast India, including the Limbu, Rai, Sunwar, Sherpa, Kami, Tamang, Gurung, Magars, Lepcha and Khas. Belief in spirits is prevalent, hence also the fear of spirit possession. Some vernacular words for &quot;jhākri&quot; are &quot;phedangbo&quot; in the Limbu language, &quot;maangpa&quot; or &quot;nakchyong&quot; in Khambu, and &quot;boongthing&quot; in Lepcha.

Jhākris perform rituals during weddings, funerals, and harvests. They diagnose and cure diseases. Their practices are influenced by Hinduism, Tibetan Buddhism, Mun, and Bön rites.

Even now the indigenous ethnic groups of Assam, Northeastern India (especially in the Mayong region as well other rural places) have shamanistic medicine men who treat diseases using sorcery as well as witchcraft and black magic for which the area was once renowned. Similar Shamans and Medicine Man are prevalent among the indigenous communities throughout the rural areas of NE India.

<text>This is a list of new-age music artists with articles on Wikipedia.

New-age music is broadly defined as relaxing, even &quot;meditative&quot;, music that is primarily instrumental. Unlike relaxing forms of classical music, new-age music makes greater use of electronica and non-Western instrumentation. There is some debate on what can be considered &quot;new-age music&quot;; for example several musicians in Celtic music or Smooth jazz have expressed annoyance at being labeled &quot;new-age musicians&quot;. For more on that debate, see the article on new-age music. In addition, several musicians object to the label because they fear it implies a connection to the New Age movement.

<text>An advance reading copy, advance review copy, advance reader&#x27;s edition, advance copy, or a reader&#x27;s edition (ARC or ARE) is a free copy of a new book given by a publisher to booksellers, librarians, journalists, celebrities, or others, or as a contest or school prize, before the book is printed for mass distribution.

==Overview==
ARCs may lack the final dust jacket, formatting, and binding of the finished product. The text of an advance edition may also differ slightly from the market book (the final version that is distributed for sale), because changes may be made after advance readers make comments or find errors in the manuscript. They sometimes also lack the interior illustrations shown in the final product. When a celebrity reader or journalist gives an endorsement, that may be added to the dust-cover and other promotional items.

ARCs are normally distributed three to six months before the book is officially released to the general public.

Book collectors often seek ARCs, which may contain text errors or typos that add value, as coins or stamps with errors do.

On rare occasions (for instance, on the publication of an eagerly awaited or controversial book), a publisher may require the recipients of an ARC to sign a confidentiality of content agreement. However, in most cases the sheer number of ARCs produced and distributed makes that impractical. A typical genre publisher will produce 5,000 ARCs for a new book by a moderately popular writer.

Before it was a common practice to produce and distribute ARCs in this way, publishers used uncorrected, bound galley proofs only for the editing and proof-reading process. Typically, they were bound in plain paper covers without illustrations, printed in black and white, and significantly larger than their market book counterparts. In contrast, ARCs usually are printed in full color, and have bindings, format, and illustrations that are similar to those of the market book. The phrase &#x27;uncorrected proof&#x27; appears on the ARC cover.

ARCs are usually paperback, and may have alternate cover art, a placeholder, or resemble the final cover. Most advance copies have a printed-on label on the spine and possibly the front cover with the release year and month of the final book. 

Although ARCs are usually free promotional items, some early versions of books, even some labeled by the publisher as ARCs, are sold to the public. An example is &quot;Captain Vorpatril&#x27;s Alliance&quot; by Lois McMaster Bujold. More recently, &#x27;collectible&#x27; ARCs have been made to promote certain books, often with multiple variations in cover or format.

==Digital advance copies==

Publishers who produce galley proofs in electronic form rather than as a physical book do not use them as ARCs. However, with the rise of ebooks and ereaders, it is now common for ARCs (in contrast to galley proofs) to be distributed as eBooks on websites such as NetGalley. Both traditionally published and self-published ARCs may be available for distribution on such sites. Recently, eARC has come into common use for advance copies of eBooks. This usage dates back to at least 2010 and was promoted by Baen Books for their trade eBooks from at least June, 2005 onward.

<doc id="599203" wikidata="Q5142470" url="?curid=599203" title="Raynaud syndrome">
<text>Raynaud syndrome, also known as Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon, is a medical condition in which the spasm of small arteries causes episodes of reduced blood flow to end arterioles. Typically the fingers, and, less commonly, the toes, are involved. Rarely, the nose, ears, nipples, or lips are affected. The episodes classically result in the affected part turning white and then blue. Often, numbness or pain occurs. As blood flow returns, the area turns red and burns. The episodes typically last minutes but can last several hours. The condition is named after the physician Auguste Gabriel Maurice Raynaud, who first described it in his doctoral thesis in 1862.
Episodes are typically triggered by cold or emotional stress. Primary Raynaud&#x27;s is idiopathic (spontaneous and of unknown cause) and not correlated with another disease. Secondary Raynaud&#x27;s is diagnosed given the presence of an underlying condition and is associated with an older age of onset. In comparison to primary Raynaud&#x27;s, episodes are more likely to be painful, asymmetric and progress to digital ulcerations. Secondary Raynaud&#x27;s can occur due to a connective-tissue disorder such as scleroderma or lupus, injuries to the hands, prolonged vibration, smoking, thyroid problems, and certain medications, such as birth control pills and stimulants. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms.
The primary treatment is avoiding the cold. Other measures include the discontinuation of nicotine or stimulant use. Medications for treatment of cases that do not improve include calcium channel blockers and iloprost. There is little evidence that alternative medicine is helpful. Severe disease may in rare cases lead to complications, specifically skin sores or gangrene.
About 4% of people have the condition. Onset of the primary form is typically between ages 15 and 30 and occurs more frequently in females. The secondary form usually affects older people. Both forms are more common in cold climates.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The condition can cause localized pain, discoloration (paleness), and sensations of cold and/or numbness.

When exposed to cold temperatures, the blood supply to the fingers or toes, and in some cases the nose or earlobes, is markedly reduced; the skin turns pale or white (called pallor) and becomes cold and numb.
These events are episodic, and when the episode subsides or the area is warmed, the blood flow returns and the skin color first turns red (rubor), and then back to normal, often accompanied by swelling, tingling, and a painful &quot;pins and needles&quot; sensation. All three color changes are observed in classic Raynaud&#x27;s yet not all patients see all of the aforementioned color changes in all episodes, especially in milder cases of the condition. The red flush is due to reactive hyperemia of the areas deprived of blood flow.

In pregnancy, this sign normally disappears due to increased surface blood flow. Raynaud&#x27;s has occurred in breastfeeding mothers, causing nipples to turn white and painful.
== Causes ==

=== Primary ===
Raynaud&#x27;s disease, or primary Raynaud&#x27;s, is diagnosed if the symptoms are idiopathic, that is, if they occur by themselves and not in association with other diseases. Some refer to primary Raynaud&#x27;s disease as &quot;being allergic to coldness&quot;. It often develops in young women in their teens and early adulthood. Primary Raynaud&#x27;s is thought to be at least partly hereditary. In a large genetic study two genes were identified that predispose for the condition: ADRA2A (alpha-2A-adrenergic receptor for adrenaline) and the transcription factor IRX1.

Smoking increases the frequency and intensity of attacks, and a hormonal component exists. Caffeine, estrogen, and nonselective beta-blockers are often listed as aggravating factors, but evidence that they should be avoided is not solid.

=== Secondary ===
Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon, or secondary Raynaud&#x27;s, occurs secondary to a wide variety of other conditions.

Secondary Raynaud&#x27;s has a number of associations:
* Connective tissue disorders:
** Scleroderma
** Systemic lupus erythematosus
** Rheumatoid arthritis
** Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome
** Dermatomyositis
** Polymyositis
** Mixed connective tissue disease
** Cold agglutinin disease
** Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
* Eating disorders:
** Anorexia nervosa
* Obstructive disorders:
** Atherosclerosis
** Buerger&#x27;s disease
** Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis
** Subclavian aneurysms
** Thoracic outlet syndrome
* Drugs:
** Beta-blockers
** Cytotoxic drugs – particularly chemotherapeutics and most especially bleomycin
** Cyclosporin
** Bromocriptine
** Ergotamine
** Sulfasalazine
** Anthrax vaccines whose primary ingredient is the Anthrax Protective Antigen
** Stimulant medications, such as those used to treat ADHD (amphetamine and methylphenidate)
** OTC pseudoephedrine medications (Chlor-Trimeton, Sudafed, others)
* Occupation:
** Jobs involving vibration, particularly drilling and prolonged use of a string trimmer (weed whacker), experience vibration white finger
** Exposure to vinyl chloride, mercury
** Exposure to the cold (e.g., by working as a frozen food packer)
* Others:
** Physical trauma to the extremities
** Lyme disease
** Hypothyroidism
** Cryoglobulinemia
** Cancer
** Chronic fatigue syndrome
** Reflex sympathetic dystrophy
** Carpal tunnel syndrome
** Magnesium deficiency
** Multiple sclerosis
** Erythromelalgia (clinically presenting as the opposite of Raynaud&#x27;s, with hot and warm extremities, often co-exists in patients with Raynaud&#x27;s)
** Chilblains (also clinically presenting as the opposite of Raynaud&#x27;s, with hot and itchy extremities; however, it affects smaller areas than erythromelalgia, for instance, the tip of a toe rather than the whole foot)

Raynaud syndrome can precede these other diseases by many years, making it the first presenting symptom. This may be the case in the CREST syndrome, of which Raynaud&#x27;s is a part.

Patients with secondary Raynaud&#x27;s can also have symptoms related to their underlying diseases. Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon is the initial symptom that presents for 70% of patients with scleroderma, a skin and joint disease.

When Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon is limited to one hand or one foot, it is referred to as unilateral Raynaud&#x27;s. This is an uncommon form, and it is always secondary to local or regional vascular disease. It commonly progresses within several years to affect other limbs as the vascular disease progresses.

==Mechanism==
Three main changes are seen in the mechanism of Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon which are reduced blood flow, blood vessel constriction, and neurogenic, inflammatory, and immune responses. It is induced by mental stress and a cold atmosphere. In all cases, the primary cause is an underlying hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. Although, with different types, the exact pathophysiology differs. In the primary type, there is an increase in sensitivity due to the reasons mentioned above resulting in vasoconstriction. In the secondary type, normal activity of blood vessels is disrupted due to the same reasons mentioned above causing vasoconstriction which leads to ischemia and tissue death.

== Diagnosis ==
Distinguishing Raynaud&#x27;s disease (primary Raynaud&#x27;s) from Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon (secondary Raynaud&#x27;s) is important. Looking for signs of arthritis or vasculitis, as well as several laboratory tests, may separate them. Nail fold capillary examination or &quot;capillaroscopy&quot; is one of the most sensitive methods to diagnose RS with connective tissue disorders, i.e. distinguish a secondary from a primary form objectively.

If suspected to be secondary to systemic sclerosis, one tool which may help aid in the prediction of systemic sclerosis is thermography.

A careful medical history will seek to identify or exclude possible secondary causes.
* Digital artery pressures are measured in the arteries of the fingers before and after the hands have been cooled. A decrease of at least 15 mmHg is diagnostic (positive).
* Doppler ultrasound to assess blood flow
* Full blood count may reveal a normocytic anaemia suggesting the anaemia of chronic disease or kidney failure.
* Blood test for urea and electrolytes may reveal kidney impairment.
* Thyroid function tests may reveal hypothyroidism.
* Tests for rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and autoantibody screening may reveal specific causative illnesses or an inflammatory process. Anti-centromere antibodies are common in limited systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome).
* Nail fold vasculature (capillaroscopy) can be examined under a microscope.

To aid in the diagnosis of Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon, multiple sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed. Table 1 below provides a summary of these various diagnostic criteria.

Recently, International Consensus Criteria were developed for the diagnosis of primary Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon by a panel of experts in the fields of rheumatology and dermatology.

== Management ==
Secondary Raynaud&#x27;s is managed primarily by treating the underlying cause, and as primary Raynaud&#x27;s, avoiding triggers, such as cold, emotional and environmental stress, vibrations, and repetitive motions, and avoiding smoking (including passive smoking) and sympathomimetic drugs.

===Medications===
Medications can be helpful for moderate or severe disease.
* Vasodilators – calcium channel blockers, such as the dihydropyridines nifedipine or amlodipine, preferably slow-release preparations – are often first-line treatment. They have the common side effects of headache, flushing, and ankle edema, but these are not typically of sufficient severity to require cessation of treatment. The limited evidence available shows that calcium-channel blockers are only slightly effective in reducing how often the attacks happen. Although, other studies also reveal that CCBs may be effective at decreasing the severity of attacks, pain, and disability associated with Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon. People whose disease is secondary to erythromelalgia often cannot use vasodilators for therapy, as they trigger &#x27;flares&#x27; causing the extremities to become burning red due to too much blood supply.
* People with severe disease prone to ulceration or large artery thrombotic events may be prescribed aspirin.
* Sympatholytic agents, such as the alpha-adrenergic blocker prazosin, may provide temporary relief to secondary Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon.
* Angiotensin receptor blockers, such as Losartan, or ACE inhibitors may aid blood flow to the fingers, and some evidence shows that angiotensin receptor blockers (often losartan) reduce frequency and severity of attacks, and possibly better than nifedipine.
* The prostaglandin iloprost is used to manage critical ischemia and pulmonary hypertension in Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon, and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan is used to manage severe pulmonary hypertension and prevent finger ulcers in scleroderma.
* Statins have a protective effect on blood vessels, and SSRIs such as fluoxetine may help symptoms, but the data is weak.
* PDE5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil and tadalafil, are used off-label to treat severe ischemia and ulcers in fingers and toes for people with secondary Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon; as of 2016, their role more generally in Raynaud&#x27;s was not clear.

=== Surgery ===
* In severe cases, an endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy procedure can be performed. Here, the nerves that signal the blood vessels of the fingertips to constrict are surgically cut. Microvascular surgery of the affected areas is another possible therapy, but this procedure should be considered as a last resort.
* A more recent treatment for severe Raynaud&#x27;s is the use of botulinum toxin. The 2009 article studied 19 patients ranging in age from 15 to 72 years with severe Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon of which 16 patients (84%) reported pain reduction at rest; 13 patients reported immediate pain relief, three more had gradual pain reduction over 1–2 months. All 13 patients with chronic finger ulcers healed within 60 days. Only 21% of the patients required repeated injections. A 2007 article describes similar improvement in a series of 11 patients. All patients had significant relief of pain.

===Alternative medicine===
Evidence does not support the use of alternative medicine, including acupuncture and laser therapy.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis of primary Raynaud syndrome is often very favorable, with no mortality and little morbidity overall. In some very rare cases, gangrene has been known to develop. The prognosis of secondary Raynaud is related to the course of the underlying disease, and how effective blood flow-restoring maneuvers are.

<text>Mervyn Edward Griffin Jr. (July 6, 1925 – August 12, 2007) was an American television show host and media mogul. He began his career as a radio and big band singer, later appearing in film and on Broadway. From 1962 to 1986, Griffin hosted his own talk show, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. Griffin also created several game shows, including &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, through his production companies, Merv Griffin Enterprises and Merv Griffin Entertainment.

==Early life==
Griffin was born July 6, 1925, in San Mateo, California, to Mervyn Edward Griffin Sr., a stockbroker, and Rita Elizabeth Griffin (née Robinson), a homemaker. He had an older sister named Barbara. As a child, Griffin played Hangman with his sister during family road trips. These games later inspired him to create the game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. The family was Irish-American and Roman Catholic. Griffin began singing in his church choir as a child. By his teenage years, he was earning money as a church organist. His abilities as a pianist played a part in his early entry into show business.

Griffin graduated from San Mateo High School in 1942 and later contributed financially to the school. He attended San Mateo Junior College and then the University of San Francisco. Griffin was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

During World War II, Griffin was classified as 4F and exempt from military service after failing several physical examinations due to a minor heart murmur. During the Korean War, he was reexamined and found fit for service; however, he was exempt from the draft as he was over the age of 26.

==Career==
===Singing===
Griffin started as a singer on radio at age 19, appearing on &quot;San Francisco Sketchbook&quot;, a nationally syndicated program based at KFRC. He was overweight as an adolescent and a young man, which led to some disappointment among fans who met him in person. In his autobiography, Griffin later revealed efforts to keep his appearance hidden from the public. Determined to change his appearance, he lost 80 pounds in four months.

Freddy Martin heard Griffin on the radio and invited him to tour with his orchestra, which he did for four years. By 1945, Griffin was able to form his own record label, Panda Records, which produced &quot;Songs by Merv Griffin&quot;, the first U.S. album recorded on magnetic tape. In 1947, Griffin had a 15-minute weekday singing program on KFRC.

Griffin gained widespread popularity through his radio performances and nightclub appearances. In 1949, his recording of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts&quot;, performed with Freddy Martin and his Orchestra, sold three million copies.

During a nightclub performance, Griffin was discovered by Doris Day, who arranged a screen test at Warner Bros. for a role in &quot;By the Light of the Silvery Moon&quot; (1953). Griffin did not get the part, but was subsequently cast in supporting roles in other musical films, including &quot;So This Is Love&quot; (1953). The film featured a scene with an open-mouthed kiss between Griffin and Kathryn Grayson, which attracted attention for being the first such kiss in a Hollywood film since the implementation of the Hays Code in 1934. Griffin also played minor roles in &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; (1953) &quot;The Boy from Oklahoma&quot; (1954) and &quot;Phantom of the Rue Morgue&quot; (1954). Dissatisfied with the film industry, Griffin bought out his Warner Bros. contract and shifted his focus to television.

In 1954, Griffin appeared in Cinécraft Productions sponsored films, including a musical, &quot;Milestones of Motoring&quot;, with Joe E. Brown. While moving to New York City that summer, Griffin and Betty Ann Grove co-hosted &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; on CBS. The show featured live music with the hosts while simulating a trip to various places in the world.

Griffin initially stayed with Loring Buzzell upon arriving in New York and became friends with him and his fiancée, Lu Ann Simms. Griffin later claimed in interviews that he was best man at their wedding in July 1954, but was in fact one of four ushers. When Buzzell and Simms had their first child, Cynthia Leigh Buzzell, on September 11, 1955, Griffin was named her godfather. After Buzzell&#x27;s death in 1959, Griffin remained close to Simms and often featured her as a guest on his talk show.

===Game show host===
From 1958 to 1962, Griffin hosted &quot;Play Your Hunch,&quot; a game show produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman. Griffin also hosted the primetime ABC game show &quot;Keep Talking&quot;. He also filled as a temporary host for Bill Cullen on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and Bud Collyer on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;.

In 1963, NBC offered Griffin the role of host for a new game show, &quot;Word for Word&quot;, which he also produced. He went on to produce additional game shows, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Play Post Office&quot; for NBC in 1965, &quot;Reach for the Stars&quot; for NBC in 1967, and &quot;One in a Million&quot; for ABC in 1967.
===Talk show host===

Griffin gained attention when &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host Jack Paar accidentally walked onto the set of &quot;Play Your Hunch&quot; during a live broadcast. Griffin persuaded Paar to stay for a spontaneous interview. At the time, both shows shared Studio 6B at Rockefeller Center, with &quot;Play Your Hunch&quot; airing live in the morning and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; taping later in the day. After Paar departed from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and before Johnny Carson assumed the role, Griffin served as one of several guest hosts during the interim period. He was regarded as the most successful of the guest hosts and, as a result, was given his own daytime talk show on NBC in 1962. The live 55-minute program was not successful and was canceled in 1963.
In 1965, Griffin launched a syndicated talk show titled &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; through Westinghouse Broadcasting. The program aired in various time slots across North America, with some stations broadcasting it during the daytime, others in primetime, and a few placing it opposite &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Arthur Treacher, Griffin&#x27;s mentor, served as the show&#x27;s announcer and sidekick until 1970. After Treacher&#x27;s departure, Griffin took over the announcing role, entering the stage with the phrase, &quot;And now...here I come!&quot; According to Griffin&#x27;s obituary in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; won 11 Emmy Awards.

The show covered a range of topics, often addressing controversial issues such as the Vietnam War. Guests included a mix of entertainers, authors, politicians, and public figures like Zsa Zsa Gabor, as well as controversial figures including George Carlin, Dick Gregory, Richard Pryor, Norman Mailer, and Bertrand Russell. In 1974, Arnold Schwarzenegger made his U.S. talk show debut on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. In 1975 and 1977, Griffin dedicated two episodes to Transcendental Meditation and its founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The 1977 episode was aired as a standalone special in some regions, including Canada. Griffin was an enthusiastic practitioner of meditation.

In 1969, Griffin moved from syndication to CBS, which launched a late-night talk show hosted by Griffin to compete with &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. His three-year tenure at CBS was contentious, as the network frequently objected to his choice of guests, particularly those critical of the Vietnam War and other sensitive topics. In April 1970, when Abbie Hoffman appeared as a guest, CBS blurred the video of Hoffman to obscure his American flag-patterned shirt, despite the fact that other guests had worn similar attire uncensored. Griffin expressed frustration with CBS&#x27;s censorship policies.

Frustrated with these restrictions and anticipating his departure from CBS, Griffin signed a deal with Metromedia for a syndicated daytime talk show to begin immediately if his CBS program was canceled. When CBS terminated his show in February 1972, Griffin&#x27;s new program debuted the following month and ran until 1986. By then, profits from his successful game shows had made Griffin one of the wealthiest entertainers in the world.

A hallmark of the show was Griffin&#x27;s interaction with audience members. One regular attendee, Lillian Miller, became a recurring presence on the program throughout its run.

Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Murphy, Griffin&#x27;s best friend since sixth grade, was the producer of &quot;The Merv Griffin Show,&quot; and eventually became president of Merv Griffin Enterprises.

==Game show creator==
Griffin created and produced the television game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;. In an Associated Press profile released prior to its debut, he explained the origins of the show:
The show, originally titled &quot;What&#x27;s the Question?&quot;, premiered on NBC in 1964, with Art Fleming as host, and ran for 11 years. Griffin composed the 30-second music piece for the &quot;Final Jeopardy!&quot; round, which later became the theme song for the syndicated version hosted by Alex Trebek starting in 1984.

After 11 years on the air, NBC canceled &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; while it still had a year remaining on its network contract. The final episode aired on January 3, 1975. &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, another game show created by Griffin, premiered the following Monday. The show became a cultural phenomenon when its nighttime syndicated version debuted in 1983. Around this period, Griffin composed the show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Changing Keys,&quot; which was used in various forms until 2000 and returned in 2021. NBC canceled the daytime version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; in 1989, after which CBS aired it for a year before it returned to NBC. The daytime version remained on NBC until its final cancellation in 1991.

Two revivals of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; were produced: a five-month run on NBC in 1978 and 1979 with Art Fleming, and a syndicated version starting September 10, 1984, hosted by Alex Trebek. Both &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; continue to air in syndication today.

In 1990, Griffin attempted to adapt the board game &quot;Monopoly&quot; into a game show, which was cancelled after 12 episodes. His final game show, &quot;Ruckus&quot;, aired from the Resorts International Hotel &amp; Casino, which Griffin owned, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The show aired locally in the New York metropolitan area. After 60 episodes, a contract dispute led to its cancellation before syndication, scrapping plans for national syndication. Reruns later aired on Game Show Network.

On May 6, 1986, Griffin sold his production company, Merv Griffin Enterprises, to Columbia Pictures Television for $250 million. At the time, it was the largest sale of an entertainment company owned by a single individual. Forbes declared Griffin the wealthiest Hollywood performer in history. He retained the title of creator for his game shows.

The success of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; inspired spin-offs, including &quot;Wheel 2000&quot; (1997-1998), &quot;Jep!&quot; (1998), and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Jeopardy!&quot; (1998-2001). Grffin also created &quot;Click!&quot; (1997-1999) and co-developed &quot;Headline Chasers&quot; (1985-1986) with Wink Martindale. From 2007 to 2008, Merv Griffin Entertainment produced the syndicated game show &quot;Merv Griffin&#x27;s Crosswords&quot;.

On May 14, 2003, Griffin received the Broadcast Music, Inc. President&#x27;s Award at the annual Film and Television Awards for his contributions to game show music.

==Business ventures==

Griffin expanded into real estate by purchasing The Beverly Hilton in 1987.

In 1988, Griffin purchased Resorts International and two of its properties: one in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and another on Paradise Island in The Bahamas, from Donald Trump and other investors. As part of the transaction, Trump purchased Resorts&#x27; interest in the under-construction Taj Mahal project for $273 million and retained ownership of Resorts International Air, which included three Sikorsky S-61 helicopters. Earlier that year, Trump had sought to take Resorts private, instead Griffin through his company Griffin Gaming &amp; Entertainment, offered minority shareholders a more competitive bid in April 1988. After purchasing Resorts International for $101 million in 1987, Trump sold it to Griffin for $365 million with the assumed hotel-casino&#x27;s debt of $925 million on November 15, 1988.

Within ten months, the company reported a loss of $46.6 million. Griffin had financed the acquisition with $325 million in junk bond financing at nearly 14% from Drexel Burnham Lambert&#x27;s Michael Milken, and suspended interest payments in early 1989. By that year, the company&#x27;s cash flow was about $70 million short of the amount needed to service its debt. On December 23, 1989, Griffin sought bankruptcy court protection for Resorts International.

The bankruptcy filing followed an involuntary petition by bondholders, who had previously reached a tentative agreement with Resorts. These bondholders sought protection of their legal claims against Trump, whom Griffin had outbid for Resorts in 1988. The bankruptcy affected not only Resorts International but also three affiliated entities: Griffin Resorts Inc., Resorts International Financing Inc., and Griffin Resorts Holding Inc.

An active desert resident and supporter of the La Quinta Arts Festival, Griffin owned the Merv Griffin Givenchy Resort &amp; Spa in Palm Springs (later The Parker) and a ranch near La Quinta, California, where he raised thoroughbred racehorses. In County Galway, Ireland, he owned St. Clerans Manor, a boutique hotel on an 18th-century estate previously owned by John Huston. In the 1980s, Griffin purchased the Paradise Island Resort and Casino in the Bahamas for $400 million from Trump, and later sold it for $125 million. Griffin sold his empire to The Coca-Cola Company for $250 million in 1986 and subsequently focused on hotel acquisitions, with his wealth estimated at $1.2 billion in 2003.

==Personal life==
Griffin was married to Julann Elizabeth Wright, a comedian and a founder of First Women&#x27;s Bank of California, from 1958 to 1976. The two met when Griffin appeared as a guest on the &quot;Robert Q. Lewis Show.&quot; The couple had one son, Anthony Patrick &quot;Tony&quot; Griffin, born in 1959, who later had two children of his own.

In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; published on May 26, 2005, Merv Griffin &quot;said with a sly grin&quot; about his private life: &quot;I tell everybody that I&#x27;m a quarter-sexual, I will do anything with anybody for a quarter.&quot; He was otherwise secretive about his business and personal lives.

Following Griffin&#x27;s death, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; published an article stating Griffin was a closeted gay man. This report was later altered after objections from Griffin&#x27;s friends and business associates.

In 1991, Griffin faced two lawsuits. Deney Terrio, host of the Griffin-created &quot;Dance Fever&quot;, sued Griffin, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him, which was dismissed. That same year, Brent Plott, a former employee who had worked as a bodyguard, horse trainer, and driver, filed a $200 million palimony lawsuit, which was also dismissed. Griffin characterized both lawsuits as extortion attempts. Regarding Plott&#x27;s lawsuit, Griffin claimed that Plott had been paid $250 a week, lived in one of two apartments under Griffin&#x27;s former house as part of his security function, and left the payroll six or seven years before the lawsuit. Griffin dismissed the charges as untrue.

Griffin maintained a close friendship with Eva Gabor from the mid-1980s until her death in 1995. Gabor stated in 1990 that they were not romantically involved.

Griffin was a longtime member of the Republican Party.

On being wealthy, Griffin said, &quot;when you walk down the street and everybody knows you&#x27;re rich, they don&#x27;t talk to you.&quot; His net worth was estimated at over $1 billion. Griffin claimed to not know his exact worth, stating it might cause unnecessary stress.

Griffin shared a birthday with Nancy Reagan on July 6, and they exchanged birthday greetings annually. A close friend of the Reagan family, Griffin served as an honorary pallbearer at Ronald Reagan&#x27;s funeral in 2004.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1974, Griffin was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Walk of Stars in Palm Springs was dedicated to him. In 2005, Griffin accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the National University of Ireland, Galway. In 2008, Griffin was posthumously inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.

On September 29, 2022, Merv and Julann Griffin were posthumously inducted into the inaugural class of the &quot;Jeopardy! Hall of Fame&quot; at the first &quot;Jeopardy! Honors&quot; event. Their son, Tony, accepted the awards on their behalf.

==Illness and death==
Griffin was treated for prostate cancer in 1996. The cancer returned in 2007. He was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where his condition deteriorated. Griffin died on August 12, 2007, at the age of 82.

Funeral services were held on August 17, 2007, at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Attendees included Nancy Reagan; Arnold Schwarzenegger, who gave the eulogy with Tony Griffin; Maria Shriver, Pat Sajak, Vanna White, Alex Trebek, Dick Van Dyke, Jack Klugman, Dick Van Patten, Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Ryan Seacrest, Johnny Mathis, Catherine Oxenberg and Casper Van Dien. Pallbearers included Griffin Group vice-chairman Ron Ward, President Robert Pritchard, Vice President Michael Eyre, and Tony Griffin. Griffin&#x27;s 7-year-old grandson, Donovan Mervyn, and Nancy Reagan were honorary pallbearers, while his 12-year-old granddaughter, Farah, gave a reading. A post-burial reception was held at the Beverly Hilton, owned by Griffin from 1987 to 2003.

Griffin was buried at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park, His epitaph reads, &quot;I will not be right back after this message,&quot; an idea he had shared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; with Tom Snyder. In his 2003 book &quot;Merv&quot;, written with David Bender, he had mentioned an alternate epitaph: &quot;Stay Tuned.&quot;

GSN paid tribute to Griffin by airing ten-episode marathons of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; during the weekend of August 18–19, 2007. The &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; marathon included episodes featuring Griffin, such as Pat Sajak&#x27;s departure from the daytime version in 1989 and a 1992–93 episode where Griffin performed with his band, &quot;The MervTones,&quot; and Vanna White at a dinner club in Orlando, Florida. The &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; marathon featured a rerun of the 2002 Million Dollar Masters Tournament.

In 2013, Griffin&#x27;s home was sold for $7 million.

<text>A synchrotron is a particular type of cyclic particle accelerator, descended from the cyclotron, in which the accelerating particle beam travels around a fixed closed-loop path. The strength of the magnetic field which bends the particle beam into its closed path increases with time during the accelerating process, being &quot;synchronized&quot; to the increasing kinetic energy of the particles.

The synchrotron is one of the first accelerator concepts to enable the construction of large-scale facilities, since bending, beam focusing and acceleration can be separated into different components. The most powerful modern particle accelerators use versions of the synchrotron design. The largest synchrotron-type accelerator, also the largest particle accelerator in the world, is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland, built in 2008 by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). It can accelerate beams of protons to an energy of 7 tera electronvolts (TeV or 1012 eV).

The synchrotron principle was invented by Vladimir Veksler in 1944. Edwin McMillan constructed the first electron synchrotron in 1945, arriving at the idea independently, having missed Veksler&#x27;s publication (which was only available in a Soviet journal, although in English). The first proton synchrotron was designed by Sir Marcus Oliphant and built in 1952.

== Types ==
Large synchrotrons usually have a linear accelerator (linac) to give the particles an initial acceleration, and a lower energy synchrotron which is sometimes called a &quot;booster&quot; to increase the energy of the particles before they are injected into the high energy synchrotron ring. Several specialized types of synchrotron machines are used today:
*A collider is a type in which, instead of the particles striking a stationary target, particles traveling in two countercirculating rings collide head-on, making higher-energy collisions possible.
*A storage ring is a special type of synchrotron in which the kinetic energy of the particles is kept constant.
*A synchrotron light source is a combination of different electron accelerator types, including a storage ring in which the desired electromagnetic radiation is generated. This radiation is then used in experimental stations located on different beamlines. Synchrotron light sources in their entirety are sometimes called &quot;synchrotrons&quot;, although this is technically incorrect.

== Principle of operation ==
The synchrotron evolved from the cyclotron, the first cyclic particle accelerator. While a classical cyclotron uses both a constant guiding magnetic field and a constant-frequency electromagnetic field (and is working in classical approximation), its successor, the isochronous cyclotron, works by local variations of the guiding magnetic field, adapting to the increasing relativistic mass of particles during acceleration.
In a synchrotron, this adaptation is done by variation of the magnetic field strength in time, rather than in space. For particles that are not close to the speed of light, the frequency of the applied electromagnetic field may also change to follow their non-constant circulation time. By increasing these parameters accordingly as the particles gain energy, their circulation path can be held constant as they are accelerated. This allows the vacuum chamber for the particles to be a large thin torus, rather than a disk as in previous, compact accelerator designs. Also, the thin profile of the vacuum chamber allowed for a more efficient use of magnetic fields than in a cyclotron, enabling the cost-effective construction of larger synchrotrons.

While the first synchrotrons and storage rings like the Cosmotron and ADA strictly used the toroid shape, the strong focusing principle independently discovered by Ernest Courant et al. and Nicholas Christofilos allowed the complete separation of the accelerator into components with specialized functions along the particle path, shaping the path into a round-cornered polygon. Some important components are given by radio frequency cavities for direct acceleration, dipole magnets (&quot;bending magnets&quot;) for deflection of particles (to close the path), and quadrupole / sextupole magnets for beam focusing.
The combination of time-dependent guiding magnetic fields and the strong focusing principle enabled the design and operation of modern large-scale accelerator facilities like colliders and synchrotron light sources. The straight sections along the closed path in such facilities are not only required for radio frequency cavities, but also for particle detectors (in colliders) and photon generation devices such as wigglers and undulators (in third generation synchrotron light sources).

The maximum energy that a cyclic accelerator can impart is typically limited by the maximum strength of the magnetic fields and the minimum radius (maximum curvature) of the particle path. Thus one method for increasing the energy limit is to use superconducting magnets, these not being limited by magnetic saturation. Electron/positron accelerators may also be limited by the emission of synchrotron radiation, resulting in a partial loss of the particle beam&#x27;s kinetic energy. The limiting beam energy is reached when the energy lost to the lateral acceleration required to maintain the beam path in a circle equals the energy added each cycle.

More powerful accelerators are built by using large radius paths and by using more numerous and more powerful microwave cavities. Lighter particles (such as electrons) lose a larger fraction of their energy when deflected. Practically speaking, the energy of electron/positron accelerators is limited by this radiation loss, while this does not play a significant role in the dynamics of proton or ion accelerators. The energy of such accelerators is limited strictly by the strength of magnets and by the cost.

=== Injection procedure ===
Unlike in a cyclotron, synchrotrons are unable to accelerate particles from zero kinetic energy; one of the obvious reasons for this is that its closed particle path would be cut by a device that emits particles. Thus, schemes were developed to inject pre-accelerated particle beams into a synchrotron. The pre-acceleration can be realized by a chain of other accelerator structures like a linac, a microtron or another synchrotron; all of these in turn need to be fed by a particle source comprising a simple high voltage power supply, typically a Cockcroft-Walton generator.

Starting from an appropriate initial value determined by the injection energy, the field strength of the dipole magnets is then increased. If the high energy particles are emitted at the end of the acceleration procedure, e.g. to a target or to another accelerator, the field strength is again decreased to injection level, starting a new &quot;injection cycle&quot;. Depending on the method of magnet control used, the time interval for one cycle can vary substantially between different installations.

== In large-scale facilities ==

One of the early large synchrotrons, now retired, is the Bevatron, constructed in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The name of this proton accelerator comes from its power, in the range of 6.3 GeV (then called BeV for billion electron volts; the name predates the adoption of the SI prefix giga-). A number of transuranium elements, unseen in the natural world, were first created with this machine. This site is also the location of one of the first large bubble chambers used to examine the results of the atomic collisions produced here.

Another early large synchrotron is the Cosmotron built at Brookhaven National Laboratory which reached 3.3 GeV in 1953.

Among the few synchrotrons around the world, 16 are located in the United States. Many of them belong to national laboratories; few are located in universities.

=== As part of colliders ===
Until August 2008, the highest energy collider in the world was the Tevatron, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, in the United States. It accelerated protons and antiprotons to slightly less than 1 TeV of kinetic energy and collided them together. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which has been built at the European Laboratory for High Energy Physics (CERN), has roughly seven times this energy (so proton-proton collisions occur at roughly 14 TeV). It is housed in the 27 km tunnel which formerly housed the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider, so it will maintain the claim as the largest scientific device ever built. The LHC will also accelerate heavy ions (such as lead) up to an energy of 1.15 PeV.

The largest device of this type seriously proposed was the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), which was to be built in the United States. This design, like others, used superconducting magnets which allow more intense magnetic fields to be created without the limitations of core saturation. While construction was begun, the project was cancelled in 1994, citing excessive budget overruns — this was due to naïve cost estimation and economic management issues rather than any basic engineering flaws. It can also be argued that the end of the Cold War resulted in a change of scientific funding priorities that contributed to its ultimate cancellation. However, the tunnel built for its placement still remains, although empty. 
While there is still potential for yet more powerful proton and heavy particle cyclic accelerators, it appears that the next step up in electron beam energy must avoid losses due to synchrotron radiation. This will require a return to the linear accelerator, but with devices significantly longer than those currently in use. There is at present a major effort to design and build the International Linear Collider (ILC), which will consist of two opposing linear accelerators, one for electrons and one for positrons. These will collide at a total center of mass energy of 0.5 TeV.

=== As part of synchrotron light sources ===

Synchrotron radiation also has a wide range of applications (see synchrotron light) and many 2nd and 3rd generation synchrotrons have been built especially to harness it. The largest of those 3rd generation synchrotron light sources are the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, the Advanced Photon Source (APS) near Chicago, United States, and SPring-8 in Japan, accelerating electrons up to 6, 7 and 8 GeV, respectively.

Synchrotrons which are useful for cutting edge research are large machines, costing tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to construct, and each beamline (there may be 20 to 50 at a large synchrotron) costs another two or three million dollars on average. These installations are mostly built by the science funding agencies of governments of developed countries, or by collaborations between several countries in a region, and operated as infrastructure facilities available to scientists from universities and research organisations throughout the country, region, or world. More compact models, however, have been developed, such as the Compact Light Source.

<text>WTTE (channel 28) is a television station in Columbus, Ohio, United States, airing programming from TBD. It is owned by Cunningham Broadcasting, which maintains a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Sinclair Broadcast Group—owner of ABC and Fox affiliate WSYX (channel 6)—for the provision of certain services, and is operated from studios on Dublin Road alongside CW affiliate WWHO (channel 53). WTTE&#x27;s transmitter is located in the Franklinton section of Columbus.

WTTE was the third station built by Sinclair. It signed on June 1, 1984, as the first mainstream independent station in the Columbus market, joining the Fox network at its launch two years later. After years of false starts, it began airing a local newscast in 1996 produced by WSYX, which was then under separate ownership. When Sinclair was able to acquire WSYX from River City Broadcasting in 1998, it transferred the WTTE license to Glencairn, Ltd.—predecessor to Cunningham—and continued to run it under an LMA. The newscasts on WTTE were the highest-rated produced by the two stations&#x27; combined news operation. In 2021, the Fox program stream moved from WTTE to Sinclair-owned WSYX and was replaced on channel 28 by TBD, a Sinclair-owned digital multicast television network.

==Prior attempt to build channel 28==
Peoples Broadcasting Company, a subsidiary of Columbus-based insurer Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, was selected for the construction permit for channel 47 in Columbus by a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) hearing examiner in 1966. It then received the permit in May 1967. To run the station, Nationwide formed a new subsidiary, Nationwide Communications Inc. (NCI), to run the station, which was designated WNCI-TV. NCI applied in January 1968 for a taller tower and higher-power facilities than initially proposed and began lengthy discussions with WOSU-TV (channel 34), the public station owned by Ohio State University, to potentially share a tower. However, Ohio State had objections about a high-power facility interfering with its radio astronomy observatory, blotting out weaker signals.

In January 1970, the FCC approved a proposal by Nationwide, formulated in conjunction with Ohio State, to make a three-way channel shift to resolve the issue. This moved channel 47 from Columbus to Mansfield, whose channel 31 was moved to Newark for use by WGSF, whose channel 28 allocation was shifted to Columbus for WNCI-TV. Nationwide entered into an agreement to pay half the cost of a new tower in Westerville, to be shared by WOSU-TV and WNCI-TV. Soon after, Nationwide opted not to construct WNCI-TV in light of a pending rulemaking at the FCC that proposed limiting one company to owning one television station, one radio station, or one newspaper in a market. Nationwide, which already owned AM and FM stations, arranged to sell the permit to the Columbus-based Laurel Broadcasting Company. The FCC approved the transaction at a reported value of $288,000 in August 1971, but the deal fell through weeks later after the parties reached an impasse.

==History==
===Early years===
In January 1976, the Commercial Radio Institute (CRI) of Baltimore announced its intention to file for channel 28. It chose Columbus after passing on prospects in Boston and Louisville, Kentucky. Shortly after, a second application was received by Christian Voice of Central Ohio, owner of Christian radio station WCVO (104.9 FM) in Gahanna, which proposed a religious and family-friendly outlet in contrast to the more traditional independent station format contemplated by the Commercial Radio Institute. FCC administrative law judge David Kraushaar ruled in favor of the Commercial Radio Institute application in October 1979 because Christian Voice of Central Ohio already owned a station in the market. Christian Voice appealed, expressing a desire to sell WCVO if necessary to obtain channel 28. It was unsuccessful in overturning the initial decision at the FCC&#x27;s review board and with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Construction on the station, dubbed WTTE, finally began to move ahead in 1983 after the company secured revenue bonds from Franklin County; work to add channel 28 to WOSU-TV&#x27;s tower began. However, WTTE was bogged down by continual delays. By October, the station was still months away from air, even though CRI had secured a studio site at 6130 Sunbury Road. Wet weather left the tower site muddy and made it impossible to maneuver heavy equipment, leading the station to scrap an April 1984 planned sign-on.

WTTE began broadcasting on June 1, 1984. It was CRI&#x27;s third station after independent outlets in Baltimore (WBFF-TV) and Pittsburgh (WPTT-TV). Its format—children&#x27;s shows, reruns, movies, and religious programs—was familiar to those used to independent stations elsewhere in the country but not so much in Columbus. It also provided an outlet for programming that the local network affiliates passed up, including sporting events not aired by the local NBC and ABC affiliates. The station joined the Fox network upon its launch in 1986. That year, the Commercial Radio Institute broadcasting division took the name Sinclair Broadcast Group.

As early as 1989, WTTE officials floated the possibility of airing a 10 p.m. newscast, either by setting up an in-house news department or by partnering with another station. In 1990, general manager Mike Quigley told &quot;Columbus Business First&quot; that the station was targeting 1991 to debut such a newscast on weeknights, though the $2 million start-up costs had resulted in delays to the plan. A newscast continued to be discussed by Quigley for years. When WCMH-TV debuted a 10 p.m. newscast production on WWHO-TV in 1994, observers believed it had been hurried to air to spoil a pending joint venture between WTTE and WBNS-TV, the market&#x27;s leading local news station.

WTTE became a secondary affiliate of UPN when the network launched in January 1995. UPN programs aired in alternative time slots to not conflict with Fox shows. Where UPN shows aired on Monday and Tuesday nights in the network&#x27;s first year, WTTE presented the network on Saturday and Sunday. This arrangement ended in January 1998 after WWHO-TV was sold to Paramount Stations Group, the network&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations division, and added UPN programming to its WB affiliation.

===Consolidation with WSYX and newscasts===
In 1996, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced the purchase of River City Broadcasting, which in Columbus owned ABC affiliate WSYX-TV (channel 6). The deal was soon amended at the behest of federal regulators to omit WSYX-TV, which Sinclair had originally planned to control under a local marketing agreement. In spite of Sinclair not immediately buying WSYX, the station became very important to WTTE. On September 16, 1996, WSYX-TV began producing a newscast for WTTE, &quot;Fox News at 10&quot;, from its studios. The arrangement was similar to one adopted by Sinclair-owned Fox affiliate WDKY-TV in Lexington, Kentucky, the year prior. It was anchored by Lorene Wagner, a former reporter and anchor for WSYX and WBNS. While it had a dedicated set and news anchors, it drew on WSYX for weather and sports personalities. &quot;Fox News at 10&quot; made a strong showing, quickly eclipsing the WCMH–WWHO newscast in the ratings. The WWHO news was canceled in October 1997, leaving WTTE with the only 10 p.m. news program in Columbus.

The U.S. Department of Justice approved Sinclair to acquire WSYX&#x27;s non-license assets, including its facilities and personnel, in 1998. Sinclair then exercised its option to buy the WSYX license and sold the WTTE license to Glencairn, Ltd. for $2.3 million. The deals triggered the consolidation of the two stations in WSYX&#x27;s facilities and under WSYX&#x27;s general manager; Wagner moved to WSYX&#x27;s evening newscasts and was replaced on WTTE by Kirstin Cole, a WSYX reporter and weekend anchor. &quot;Fox News at 10&quot; was expanded to a full hour later in 1998. Local newscasts from both stations were combined under the umbrella brand &quot;NewsCenter&quot; in September 1999.

In April 2000, WWHO dropped Kids&#x27; WB programming entirely; it downgraded its WB affiliation to essentially secondary status in order to air UPN programming in pattern, though it continued to air all WB prime time shows. While WTTE could not pick up the entire children&#x27;s lineup because of its own Fox Kids offering, weekday airings of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime were added to WTTE&#x27;s schedule under agreement with The WB. 

The &quot;NewsCenter&quot; partnership extended to morning news beginning in August 2000, when WTTE debuted a 7 a.m. extension of WSYX&#x27;s morning newscast. An 8 a.m. hour was added in 2005, bringing the stations&#x27; total morning news output to four hours. In 2005, WTTE became the home of Ohio Lottery drawings under an agreement that saw the lottery pay less than it had been to WBNS-TV. By this time, WTTE&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast was the highest-rated news program on either station. In May 2014, WTTE was the highest-rated Fox affiliate in prime time in the United States, and its 10 p.m. newscast had twice as many viewers as WSYX at 11 p.m.

===Move of Fox to WSYX subchannel===
On January 1, 2021, Sinclair quietly sent a letter to cable and satellite providers saying that it had consolidated the Fox affiliations of stations in five markets where it had been on a station operated via an LMA onto Sinclair-owned stations, putting those affiliations directly in Sinclair&#x27;s control. WTTE was one of the affected stations. While most markets transitioned on that day, the transition of WTTE–Fox&#x27;s programming schedule onto WSYX&#x27;s spectrum took place on January 7, the day WWHO-TV became the market&#x27;s ATSC 3.0 lighthouse station. On that date, Fox 28 moved to WSYX 6.3. It was broadcast from both WSYX and WTTE until February 3, when WTTE&#x27;s main signal switched to the Sinclair-owned TBD network.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WTTE began broadcasting a digital signal on October 28, 2002. It and WWHO were the only full-power television stations in the Columbus market that honored the original DTV transition date of February 17, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 36, using virtual channel 28.

WTTE relocated its signal from channel 36 to channel 27 on April 9, 2019, as a result of the 2016 United States wireless spectrum auction.

<doc id="599220" wikidata="Q213121" url="?curid=599220" title="New-age music">
<text>New-age is a genre of music intended to create artistic inspiration, relaxation, and optimism. It is used by listeners for yoga, massage, meditation, and reading as a method of stress management to bring about a state of ecstasy rather than trance, or to create a peaceful atmosphere in homes or other environments. It is sometimes associated with environmentalism and New Age spirituality; however, most of its artists have nothing to do with &quot;New Age spirituality,&quot; and some even reject the term.

New-age music includes both acoustic forms, featuring instruments such as flutes, piano, acoustic guitar, non-Western acoustic instruments, while also engaging with electronic forms, frequently relying on sustained synth pads or long sequencer-based runs. New-age artists often combine these approaches to create electroacoustic music. Vocal arrangements were initially rare in the genre, but as it has evolved, vocals have become more common, especially those featuring Native American-, Sanskrit-, or Tibetan-influenced chants, or lyrics based on mythology such as Celtic legends.

There is no exact definition of new-age music. However, it is often judged by its intent according to the Grammy screening committee in that category. An article in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine in 1987 commented that &quot;New Age music may be the most startling successful non-defined music ever to hit the public consciousness&quot;. Many consider it to be an umbrella term for marketing rather than a musical category, and to be part of a complex cultural trend.

New-age music was influenced by a wide range of artists from a variety of genres. Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;Music for Zen Meditation&quot; (1964) is considered the first new-age recording. Paul Horn (beginning with 1968&#x27;s &quot;Inside&quot;) was one of the important predecessors. Irv Teibel&#x27;s &quot;Environments&quot; series (1969–79) featured natural soundscapes, tintinnabulation, and &quot;Om&quot; chants and were some of the first publicly available psychoacoustic recordings. Steven Halpern&#x27;s 1975 &quot;Spectrum Suite&quot; was a key work that began the new-age music movement.

==Definition==
New-age music is defined more by the use and effect or feeling it produces rather than the instruments and genre used in its creation; it may be acoustic, electronic, or a mixture of both. New-age artists range from solo or ensemble performances using classical-music instruments ranging from the piano, acoustic guitar, flute, or harp to electronic musical instruments, or from Eastern instruments such as the sitar, tabla and tamboura. There is also a significant overlap of sectors of new-age music with ambient, classical, jazz, electronica, world, chillout, pop, and space music, among others.

The two definitions typically associated with the new-age genre are:

* New-age music with an ambient sound that has the explicit purpose of aiding meditation and relaxation, or aiding and enabling various alternative spiritual practices, such as alternative healing, yoga practice, guided meditation, or chakra auditing. The proponents of this definition are almost always musicians who create their music expressly for these purposes. To be useful for meditation, music must have repetitive dynamic and texture without sudden loud chords or improvisation, which could disturb the meditator. It is minimalist in conception, and musicians in the genre are mostly instrumentalists rather than vocalists. Subliminal messages are also used in new-age music, and the use of instruments along with sounds of animals (like whales, wolves and eagles) and nature (waterfalls, ocean waves, rain) is also popular. Flautist Dean Evenson was one of the first musicians to combine peaceful music with the sounds of nature, launching a genre that became popular for massage and yoga. Other prominent artists who create new-age music expressly for healing or meditation include Irv Teibel, Paul Horn, Deuter, Steven Halpern, Paul Winter, Lawrence Ball, Karunesh, Krishna Das, Deva Premal, Bhagavan Das, and Snatam Kaur.
* Music found in the new-age sections of record stores. This is largely a definition of practicality, given the breadth of music classified as &quot;new age&quot; by retailers that are often less interested in finely grained distinctions between musical styles than are fans of those styles. Music that falls into this definition usually cannot be easily classified into other, more common definitions, but can contain almost any kind of music; it is more of a marketing slogan rather than musical category.

===Debate and criticism===
Stephen Hill, founder of &quot;Hearts of Space&quot;, considers that &quot;many of the artists are very sincerely and fully committed to New Age ideas and ways of life&quot;. Some composers like Kitarō consider their music to be part of their spiritual growth, as well as expressing values and shaping the culture. Douglas Groothuis stated that from a Christian perspective, rejection of all music labeled as &quot;new age&quot; would be to fall prey to a taboo mentality, as most of the music belongs to the &quot;progressive&quot; side of new-age music, where composers necessarily do not always have a New Age worldview.

However, it is often noted that &quot;new-age music&quot; is a mere popular designation that successfully sells records. J. Gordon Melton argued that it does not refer to a specific genre of music, but to music used for therapeutic or other new-age purposes. Kay Gardner considered the label &quot;new age&quot; an inauthentic commercial intention of so-called new-age music, saying, &quot;a lot of new age music is schlock&quot;, and how due to record sales, everyone with a home studio put in sounds of crickets, oceans or rivers as a guarantee of sales. What started as ambient mood music related with new-age activity became a term for a musical conglomeration of jazz, folk, rock, ethnic, classical, and electronica, among other styles, with the former, markedly different musical and theoretical movement.
Under the umbrella term, some consider Mike Oldfield&#x27;s 1973 progressive rock album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; one of the first albums to be referred to under the genre description of new-age. Others consider music by Greek composer Vangelis and general modern jazz-rock fusion as exemplifing the progressive side of new-age music. Other artists included are Jean-Michel Jarre (even though his electronic excursions predate the term), Andreas Vollenweider, George Winston, Mark Isham, Michael Hedges, Shadowfax, Mannheim Steamroller, Kitarō, Yanni, Enya, Clannad, Era, Tangerine Dream and Enigma.

However, many musicians and composers dismiss the labeling of their music as &quot;new age&quot;. When the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album was first created in 1987, its first winner, Andreas Vollenweider, said, &quot;I don&#x27;t have any intention to label my music... It&#x27;s ridiculous to give a name to anything that is timeless&quot;. Peter Bryant, music director of WHYY-FM and host of a new-age program, noted that &quot;I don&#x27;t care for the term... New-age has a negative connotation... In the circles I come in contact with, people working in music, &#x27;new-age&#x27; is almost an insult&quot;, that it refers to &quot;very vapid, dreamy kinds of dull music... with no substance or form or interest&quot;, and that the term has &quot;stuck&quot;.
Harold Budd said, &quot;When I hear the term &#x27;new-age&#x27; I reach for my revolver... I don&#x27;t think of myself as making music that is only supposed to be in the background. It&#x27;s embarrassing to inadvertently be associated with something that you know in your guts is vacuous.&quot; Vangelis considers it to be a style that &quot;gave the opportunity for untalented people to make very boring music&quot;. Yanni stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t want to relax the audience; I want to engage them in the music, get them interested&quot;, and that &quot;New age implies a more subdued, more relaxed music than what I do. My music can be very rhythmic, very energetic, even very ethnic.&quot; David Van Tieghem, George Winston and Kitarō also rejected the label of new-age artist. David Lanz said that he &quot;finally figured out that the main reason people don&#x27;t like the term new age is because it&#x27;s the only musical category that isn&#x27;t a musical term&quot;. Andreas Vollenweider noted that &quot;we have sold millions of records worldwide before the category new age was actually a category&quot;, and shared the concern that &quot;the stores are having this problem with categorization&quot;.
Ron Goldstein, president of Private Music, agreed with such a standpoint, and explained that &quot;Windham Hill was the hub of this whole thing. Because of that association, new-age has come to be perceived as this West Coast thing&quot;. However, Windham Hill&#x27;s managing director Sam Sutherland argued that even the label&#x27;s founders William Ackerman and Anne Robinson &quot;shied away from using any idiomatic or generic term at all. It&#x27;s always seemed a little synthetic&quot;, and they stopped making any kind of deliberate protests to the use of the term simply because it was inappropriate. Both Goldstein and Sutherland concluded that the tag helped move merchandise, and that new-age music would be absorbed into the general body of pop music within a few years after 1987.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Jon Pareles noted that &quot;new-age music&quot; absorbed other styles in more softer form, but those same, well-defined styles do not need the new-age category, and that &quot;new-age music&quot; resembles other music because it is aimed as a marketing niche—to be a &quot;formula show&quot; designated for urban &quot;ultra-consumers&quot; as status accessory; he also said the Andean, Asian and African traditional music influences evoke the sense of &quot;cosmopolitanism&quot;, while nature in the album artwork and sound evoke the &quot;connection to unspoiled landscapes&quot;.

===Alternative terms===
The borders of this umbrella genre are not well-defined, but music retail stores will include artists in the &quot;new-age&quot; category even if they belong to different genre, and those artists themselves use different names for their style of music.

Kay Gardner called the original new-age music &quot;healing music&quot; or &quot;women&#x27;s spirituality&quot;. Paul Winter, considered a new-age music pioneer, also dismissed the term, preferring &quot;earth music&quot;.

The term &quot;instrumental music&quot; or &quot;contemporary instrumental&quot; can include artists who do not use electronic instruments, such as solo pianist David Lanz. Similarly, pianists such as Yanni and Bradley Joseph use this term as well, although they use keyboards to incorporate layered orchestral textures into their compositions. Yanni has distinguished the music genre from the spiritual movement bearing the same name. The term &quot;contemporary instrumental music&quot; was also suggested by Andreas Vollenweider, while &quot;adult alternative&quot; by Gary L. Chappell, which was the term by which &quot;Billboard&quot; called the new-age and world-music album charts.

==History==

The concept arose with the involvement of professional musicians in the New-Age movement. Initially, it was of no interest to the musical industry, so the musicians and related staff founded their own small independent recording businesses. Sales reached significant numbers in unusual outlets such as bookstores, gift stores, health-food stores and boutiques, as well as by direct mail. With the demand of a large market, the major recording companies began promoting new-age music in the 1980s.

New-age music was influenced by a wide range of artists from a variety of genres—for example, folk-instrumentalists John Fahey and Leo Kottke, minimalists Terry Riley, Steve Reich, La Monte Young, and Philip Glass, progressive rock acts such as Pink Floyd, ambient pioneer Brian Eno, synthesizer performer Klaus Schulze, and jazz artists Keith Jarrett, Weather Report, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Paul Horn (beginning with 1968&#x27;s &quot;Inside&quot;), Paul Winter (beginning in the mid-1960s with the Paul Winter Consort) and Pat Metheny.

Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;Music for Zen Meditation&quot; (1964) is sometimes considered the first new-age recording, but initially it was popular mostly in California, and was not sold nationally until the 1980s. Another school of meditation music arose among the followers of Rajneesh; Deuter recorded &quot;D&quot; (1971) and &quot;Aum&quot; (1972), which mixed acoustic and electronic instruments with sounds of the sea. Kay Gardner&#x27;s song &quot;Lunamuse&quot; (1974) and first recording &quot;Mooncircles&quot; (1975), which were a synthesis of music, sexuality and Wiccan spirituality, were &quot;new-age music before it got to be new-age music&quot;. Her &quot;A Rainbow Path&quot; (1984) embraced Halpern&#x27;s theory of healing music from that time with women&#x27;s spirituality, and she became one of the most popular new-age sacred-music artists. Mike Orme of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; writes that many key Berlin school musicians helped popularise new-age.

Paul Winter&#x27;s &quot;Missa Gaia/Earth Mass&quot; (1982) is described as &quot;a masterpiece of New Age ecological consciousness that celebrates the sacredness of land, sky, and sea&quot;. His work on the East Coast is considered to be one of the most important musical expressions of new-age spirituality. On the West Coast, musicians concentrated more on music for healing and meditation. The most notable early work was Steven Halpern&#x27;s &quot;Spectrum Suite&quot; (1975), the musical purpose of which was described as to &quot;resonate specific areas of the body... it quiets the mind and body&quot;, and whose title relates &quot;to the seven tones of the musical scale and the seven colors of the rainbow to the seven etheric energy sources (chakras) in our bodies&quot;. In the 1970s his music work, and the theoretical book &quot;Tuning the Human Instrument&quot; (1979), pioneered the contemporary practice of musical healing in the United States.

In 1976 the record label Windham Hill Records was founded, with an initial $300 investment, and would gross over $26 million annually ten years later. Over the years many record labels were formed that embraced or rejected the new-age designation, such as Narada Productions, Private Music, Music West, Lifestyle, Audion, Sonic Atmospheres, Living Music, Terra (Vanguard Records), Novus Records (which mainly recorded jazz music), FM (CBS Masterworks) and Cinema (Capitol Records).

Between the intentional extremes of the U.S.&#x27; coasts are some of the most successful new-age artists, like George Winston and R. Carlos Nakai. Winston&#x27;s million-selling &quot;December&quot; (1982), released by Windham Hill Records, was highly popular. Most of Nakai&#x27;s work, with his first release &quot;Changes&quot; in 1983, consists of improvised songs in native North American style. During the 1990s, his music became virtual anthems for new-age spirituality.

In 1981, Tower Records in Mountain View, California added a &quot;new age&quot; bin. By 1985, independent and chain record retail stores were adding sections for new age, and major labels began showing interest in the genre, both through acquisition of some existing new-age labels such as Paul Winter&#x27;s Living Music and through signing of so-called &quot;new-age&quot; artists such as Japanese electronic composer Kitarō and American crossover jazz musician Pat Metheny, both signed by Geffen Records. Most of the major record labels accepted new age artists by the beginning of the next year. In the late 1980s the umbrella genre was the fastest-growing genre with significant radio broadcast. It was seen as an attractive business due to low recording costs.

Stephen Hill founded the new-age radio show &quot;Hearts of Space&quot; in 1973. In 1983, it was picked up by NPR for syndication to 230 affiliates nationally, and a year later Hill started a record label, Hearts of Space Records. On Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1987, the former Los Angeles rock radio station KMET changed to a full-time new-age music format with new call letters KTWV, branded as &quot;The Wave&quot;. During The Wave&#x27;s new-age period, management told the station employees to refer to The Wave as a &quot;mood service&quot; rather than a &quot;radio station&quot;. DJs stopped announcing the titles of the songs, and instead, to maintain an uninterrupted mood, listeners could call a 1–800 phone number to find out what song was playing. News breaks were also re-branded and referred to as &quot;wave breaks&quot;. Other new-age-specialty radio programs included Forest&#x27;s &quot;Musical Starstreams&quot; and John Diliberto&#x27;s &quot;Echoes&quot;. Most major cable television networks have channels that play music without visuals, including channels for New age, such as the &quot;Soundscapes&quot; channel on Music Choice. The two satellite radio companies Sirius Satellite Radio &amp; XM Satellite Radio each had their own channels that played new-age music. Sirius—Spa (Sirius XM) (73), XM—Audio Visions (77). When the two merged in November 2008 and became SiriusXM, the Spa name was retained for the music channel with the majority of Audio Vision&#x27;s music library being used.
In 1987, the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album was introduced, while in 1988 the &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s New Age weekly charts. In 1989, Suzanne Doucet produced and held the first international New-Age Music Conference in Los Angeles. By the end of 1989, there were over 150 small independent record labels releasing new-age music, while new-age and adult-alternative programs were carried on hundreds of commercial and college radio stations in the U.S., and over 40 distributors were selling new-age music through mail-order catalogs.

In the 1990s, many small labels of new-age style music emerged in Japan, but for this kind of instrumental music the terms &quot;relaxing&quot; or &quot;healing&quot; music were more popular. Enigma&#x27;s &quot;Sadeness (Part I)&quot; became an international hit, reaching number one in 24 countries, including the UK, and number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, selling over 5 million worldwide. At the time Holland was the home of two leading European new-age labels—Oreade and Narada Media. Oreade reported that in 1997 the latest trend was &quot;angelic&quot; music, while Narada Media predicted that the genre would develop in the direction of world music (with Celtic, Irish and African influences). In 1995 some &quot;new-age&quot; composers like Kitarō, Suzanne Ciani and Patrick O&#x27;Hearn moved from major to independent record labels due to lack of promotion, diminishing sales or limited freedom of creativity.

In 2001, Windham Hill celebrated its 25th anniversary, Narada and Higher Octave Music continued to move into world and ethno-techno music, and Hearts of Space Records were bought by Valley Entertainment. Enya&#x27;s &quot;Only Time&quot; peaked at #10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and the album &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; at #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making Enya the number one new-age artist of the year.

<doc id="599222" wikidata="Q255731" url="?curid=599222" title="Recto and verso">
<text>Recto is the &quot;right&quot; or &quot;front&quot; side and verso is the &quot;left&quot; or &quot;back&quot; side when text is written or printed on a leaf of paper () in a bound item such as a codex, book, broadsheet, or pamphlet.

In double-sided printing, each leaf has two pages – front and back. In modern books, the physical sheets of paper are stacked and folded in half, producing two leaves and four pages for each sheet. For example, the outer sheet in a 16-page book will have one leaf with pages 1 (recto) and 2 (verso), and another leaf with pages 15 (recto) and 16 (verso). Pages 1 and 16, for example, are printed on the same side of the physical sheet of paper, combining recto and verso sides of different leaves. The number of pages in a book using this binding technique must thus be a multiple of four, and the number of leaves must be a multiple of two, but unused pages are typically left unnumbered and uncounted. A sheet folded in this manner is known as a folio, a word also used for a book or pamphlet made with this technique.
Looseleaf paper consists of unbound leaves. Sometimes single-sided or blank leaves are used for numbering or counting and abbreviated &quot;l.&quot; instead of &quot;p.&quot; for the number of pages.

==Etymology==
The terms are shortened from Latin: and &#x27; (which translate as &quot;on the right side of the leaf&quot; and &quot;on the back side of the leaf&quot;). The two opposite pages themselves are called &#x27; and &quot;&quot; in Latin, and the ablative &#x27;, &#x27; already imply that the text on the page (and not the physical page itself) are referred to.

==Usage==

In codicology, each physical sheet (&#x27;, abbreviated &quot;fol.&quot; or &quot;f.&quot;) of a manuscript is numbered, and the sides are referred to as &#x27; and &#x27;, abbreviated as &quot;r&quot; and &quot;v&quot; respectively. Editions of manuscripts will thus mark the position of text in the original manuscript in the form &quot;fol. 1r&quot;, sometimes with the &quot;r&quot; and &quot;v&quot; in superscript, as in &quot;1r&quot;, or with a superscript &quot;o&quot; indicating the ablative &#x27;, &quot;&quot;, as in &quot;1ro&quot;. This terminology has been standard since the beginnings of modern codicology in the 17th century.

In 2011, Martyn Lyons argued that the term &quot;&quot; &quot;right, correct, proper&quot; for the front side of the leaf derives from the use of papyrus in late antiquity, as a different grain ran across each side, and only one side was suitable to be written on, so that usually papyrus would carry writing only on the &quot;correct&quot;, smooth side (and just in exceptional cases would there be writing on the reverse side of the leaf).

The terms &quot;recto&quot; and &quot;verso&quot; are also used in the codicology of manuscripts written in right-to-left scripts, like Syriac, Arabic and Hebrew. However, as these scripts are written in the other direction to the scripts witnessed in European codices, the recto page is to the left while the verso is to the right. The reading order of each folio remains first verso, then recto, regardless of writing direction.

The terms are carried over into printing; &quot;&quot; is the norm for printed books but was an important advantage of the printing press over the much older Asian woodblock printing method, which printed by rubbing from behind the page being printed, and so could only print on one side of a piece of paper. The distinction between recto and verso can be convenient in the annotation of scholarly books, particularly in bilingual edition translations.

The &quot;recto&quot; and &quot;verso&quot; terms can also be employed for the front and back of a one-sheet artwork, particularly in drawing. A drawing is a sheet with drawings on both sides, for example in a sketchbook—although usually in these cases there is no obvious primary side. Some works are planned to exploit being on two sides of the same piece of paper, but usually the works are not intended to be considered together. Paper was relatively expensive in the past; good drawing paper still is much more expensive than normal paper.

By book publishing convention, the first page of a book, and sometimes of each section and chapter of a book, is a recto page, and hence all recto pages will have odd numbers and all verso pages will have even numbers.

In many early printed books or incunables and still in some 16th-century books (e.g. &#x27;s ), it is the (&quot;leaves&quot;) rather than the pages, that are numbered. Thus, each carries a consecutive number on its recto side, while on the verso side there is no number. This was also very common in &quot;e.g.&quot; internal company reports in the 20th century, before double-sided printers became commonplace in offices.

<doc id="599231" wikidata="Q1971115" url="?curid=599231" title="Mother's boy">
<text>Mother&#x27;s boy, also commonly and informally mummy&#x27;s boy, mommy&#x27;s boy or mama&#x27;s boy, is a derogatory term for a man seen as having an unhealthy dependence on his mother at an age at which he is expected to be self-reliant (e.g. live on his own, earn his own money, be married). Use of this phrase is first attested in 1901. The term mama&#x27;s boy has a connotation of effeminacy and weakness. The counter term, for women, would be a father complex.

In classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the term Oedipus complex denotes a child&#x27;s desire to have sexual relations with the parent of the opposite sex. Sigmund Freud wrote that a child&#x27;s identification with the same-sex parent is the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex. This theory came into the popular consciousness in America in the 1940s.

== Psychological explanations ==

=== Psychoanalytic theory ===
The psychoanalytic theory, often referred to as the psychodynamic approach, provides a key psychological explanation for human gender development. &#x27;Gender development&#x27; refers to a process in which individuals come to understand and internalise gender-related concepts and roles. It is a gradual formation of cognitive frameworks and internal schemas in relation to gender dynamics amongst society.

In the psychoanalytic theory, Sigmund Freud highlighted the significance of the unconscious mind in shaping human behaviour and personality. This Freudian perspective emerged in the early 1900&#x27;s, in which he addressed physical traits such as being a &quot;mother&#x27;s boy&quot; by exploring and resolving conflicts within the internal mind.
==== Psychosexual stages ====
Freud proposed that child development occurs in five psychosexual stages, each marked by various conflicts that children must &quot;overcome&quot; in order to successfully progress onto the next. The Oedipus complex/conflict is encountered in the &quot;phallic stage&quot; when children are 3-6 years old as they begin gender development. Prior to the phallic stage, children have no concept nor awareness of gender. This notion is further supported by Kohlberg&#x27;s theory of gender development.

==== Oedipus complex ====
The Oedipus complex is defined by a boy&#x27;s unconscious, incestuous feelings toward his mother. This is accompanied by jealousy and hostility toward his father, whom the boy deems as a sexual rival for his mother&#x27;s affection. However, this desire is tempered by the boy&#x27;s fear of retaliation from his father, leading to &quot;castration anxiety&quot;, when the boy fears he may be castrated by his own father. To resolve and overcome this conflict, the boy typically gives up his love for his mother, and instead begins to identity with his father. This enables him to internalise traits and personalities observed from the same sex parent.

However, if the psychosexual Oedipus conflict remains unresolved, fixation can occur, resulting in the child becoming &quot;stuck&quot; with phallic personality traits into adulthood. These phallic personality traits are depicted by a man&#x27;s over dependence on his mother, both emotionally and physically. Freud argues this occurrence is particularly noticeable in cases of absent fathers, where the lack of identification and internalisation with the father causes the boy to seek gender identification with the mother instead, thus leading to what modern society calls a &quot;mother&#x27;s boy&quot;.

=== Attachment theory ===
Psychologists John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth investigated the emotional bond (reciprocity) formed between infants and their mothers. Attachment theory proposes that in the case of &quot;mother&#x27;s boys&quot;, their intense dependency on their primary caregiver (the mother) results in a reluctance to assert independence, heightened anxiety in her absence, and difficulty forming and maintaining relationships beyond the maternal bond upon adulthood.

In Ainsworth&#x27;s &quot;strange situation&quot; experiment in 1970, she explored the long term implications of various attachment styles for adult functioning. She identified three primary attachment styles in children:

# Secure attachment
# Insecure-avoidant attachment
# Insecure-resistant attachment.

Further studies has indicated that children who develop an insecure attachment style with their mothers especially exhibit difficulties in forming healthy relationships in adulthood. Additionally, psychologist Diana Baumrind identified that parenting styles characterised by overprotection and lack of boundaries may exacerbate an insecure attachment style and intensify &quot;mother&#x27;s boy&quot; dynamics. Attachment studies therefore highlights the importance of early attachment and parenting styles in shaping individuals&#x27; interpersonal behaviour and overall psychological well-being.

== Criticism and controversies ==
The term &quot;mother&#x27;s boy&quot; is not without its criticisms and controversies due to its potential to stigmatise males who maintain a close relationship with their mothers. It may enforce existing gender stereotypes that men should be strong and not emotionally reliant on their mothers, which could invalidate their emotional bonds with mothers.

The Freudian psychoanalytic theory, from which the term &quot;mother&#x27;s boy&quot; stems, can be largely criticised in contemporary psychology. Critics argue the theory&#x27;s speculative nature and reliance on clinical observations lack empirical evidence and scientific rigour. As his methodology was largely grounded in case studies of the unconscious mind, his findings also lack falsifiability. Moreover, Freud&#x27;s work only reflects the cultural and historical context of late 19th century Vienna, leading to concerns about cultural relativism and ethnocentrism.

Similar limitations can also be identified in Mary Ainsworth&#x27;s attachment theory in 1970. Her &quot;strange situation&quot; study has been criticised for its ethnocentric bias and lack of universality. Meta-analyses following Ainsworth&#x27;s research, such as the study by Van IJ &amp; K highlighted cultural differences in attachment types, with insecure attachment being more prevalent in collectivist Asian cultures (Japan, China, India) in comparison to the Western individualistic cultures (Germany, UK, USA).

== Cultural and media depictions ==
The term &quot;mother&#x27;s boy&quot; is perceived differently across cultures and media representations due to varying cultural attitudes towards masculinity and gender roles of males in society.

The term &quot;mother&#x27;s boy&quot; carries negative connotations in Western cultures. By contrast, Asian cultures, including those in countries like India, Pakistan, and China, often place a strong emphasis on family values and filial piety (the virtue of showing respect for one&#x27;s parents and elders). Sons are traditionally expected to show respect and obedience to their mothers as a sign of familial honour due to the mother&#x27;s traditional gender role of being a homemaker.

=== Notable examples in media ===

This was portrayed in the 2020 Netflix TV sitcom &quot;Never Have I Ever&quot;, where character Devi Vishwakumar is rejected by her love interest Des, as his mother disapproves of their relationship, stating &quot;Look, Devi, you’re cool and all, but dating you isn’t worth angering my mom. I mean, she still pays for my phone.”

The mother&#x27;s boy phenomenon is also comically portrayed in other popular TV sitcoms such as &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, starring Simon Helberg as Howard Wolowitz, a man who still lives with his mother in his late 20&#x27;s. Howard&#x27;s relationship with his overbearing mother is a recurring source of humour. His constant need for his mother&#x27;s approval and his reluctance to fully separate from her highlights the stereotype of the mother&#x27;s boy in Western culture. There is also a portrayal as a running joke in the comedy series &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, where one child-like character, Buster Bluth, is attached to his mother, Lucille, and participated in an annual mother-son dinner dance called &quot;Motherboy&quot; for around 30 years, well into his adulthood. 

Equally notable and much more visible, Marie Barron, plays an overbearing, meddling mother-in-law in Everybody loves Raymond. Sons, Ray &amp; Robert Baron, often reluctantly succumb to their mothers wishes, which infuriates Ray&#x27;s wife, Debra. Fans were so taken aback that they compiled a medley of Marie&#x27;s most choice moments.
More famously, in the 1960&#x27;s American horror films &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;Bates Motel&quot;, Norman&#x27;s intense and unhealthy relationship with his mother depicts the dark side of being a mother&#x27;s boy. Norman&#x27;s deep emotional attachment to his mother, coupled with her extreme influence, contributes to his descent into madness and eventual transformation into an infamous killer in the film.

Overall, the term &quot;mother&#x27;s boy&quot; reflects the complex dynamics observed in mother-son relationships amongst Western society.

<text>AB Karlstads Mekaniska Werkstad (&quot;trans.&quot; Karlstad Mechanical Works Ltd), known as Kamewa, was a Swedish manufacturing company in the city of Kristinehamn. Kamewa started as a brand name of the controllable-pitch propellers manufactured by KMW. KMW was founded in the city of Karlstad in 1860. KMW also manufactured pulp and paper machines for paper mills and hydro power turbines. Kamewa was acquired by the British company Vickers plc in 1986. In 1999, Rolls-Royce acquired Vickers. In 2019 the Commercial Marine part of Rolls-Royce was acquired by the Kongsberg group and integrated into its maritime division Kongsberg Maritime. The Swedish part of the business is now called Kongsberg Maritime Sweden AB and is based in Kristinehamn.

== Water jets ==
The Kamewa waterjets are still traded by Kongsberg Maritime under that name and are offered in five product lines in two product series.

Previous products from Kamewa has been the A-series, a mix flow pump in aluminum, the SII and P62 pumps in stainless steel and the Kamewa Advanced Propulsion Systems (APS) Waterjet developed specifically for the Volvo Penta diesel engine.

== Propellers ==
Kongsberg also produces Kamewa and Kamewa Ulstein propellers.

== U.S. Distributors ==
In 2016, Pacific Power Group was awarded the company&#x27;s first distributorship to serve the Western U.S.

<text>The Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) is an astronomical observatory located on the summit of Mt. Cerro Tololo in the Coquimbo Region of northern Chile, with additional facilities located on Mt. Cerro Pachón about to the southeast. It is approximately east of La Serena, where support facilities are located. 
The principal telescopes at CTIO are the 4 m Víctor M. Blanco Telescope, named after Puerto Rican astronomer Víctor Manuel Blanco, and the 4.1 m Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope, which is situated on Cerro Pachón. Other telescopes on Cerro Tololo include the 1.5 m, 1.3 m, 1.0 m, and 0.9 m telescopes operated by the SMARTS consortium. CTIO also hosts other research projects, such as PROMPT, WHAM, and LCOGTN, providing a platform for access to the southern hemisphere for U.S. and worldwide scientific research.

==History==
In 1959, German astronomer Jürgen Stock arrived in Santiago to look for the optimum site for an observatory, working on behalf of the Yerkes Observatory by the University of Chicago under Gerard Kuiper. He went to the semi-arid region of Coquimbo, South of the Atacama Desert, and climbed numerous mountains, carrying a Danjon telescope and an interferometer to determine visibility and accurately measure the wavelength of light. He did not have a barometer to do meteorological forecasting and learnt from muleteers to observe animal behavior, like condor accumulations, for weather changes.

The site for the Inter-American Observatory on Mt. Cerro Tololo was identified by a team of scientists from Chile and the United States in 1959, and it was selected in 1962. Construction began in 1963 with Stock as the first director, and regular astronomical observations commenced in 1965.

In 1974, construction of large buildings on Cerro Tololo ended with the completion of the Víctor Blanco Telescope, but smaller facilities have been built since then. 
Cerro Pachón is still under development, with two large telescopes (Gemini South and SOAR) inaugurated since 2000, and one in the final stages of construction as of 2023 (the Vera C. Rubin Observatory)

== Organization ==

CTIO is one of two observatories managed by NOIRLab, the other being Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) near Tucson, Arizona. NOIRLab is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), which owns the property around the two peaks in Chile and at the headquarters in La Serena, Chile. AURA also operates the Space Telescope Science Institute and the Gemini Observatory. The Gemini South Telescope located on Cerro Pachón is managed by AURA separately from CTIO for an international consortium. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is the funding agency for NOIRLab.

The Small and Medium Research Telescope System (SMARTS) is a consortium formed in 2001 after NOAO, the predecessor to NOIRLab, announced it would no longer support anything smaller than two meters at CTIO. The member institutions of SMARTS now fund and manage observing time on four telescopes that fit that definition. Access has also been purchased by individual scientists. SMARTS contracts with NOIRLab to maintain the telescopes it controls at CTIO, and NOIRLab retains the right to 25% of the observing time, and Chilean scientists retain 10%. SMARTS began managing telescopes in 2003.
CTIOPI is the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory Parallax Investigation. It began in 1999 and uses two telescopes at Cerro Tololo, the SMARTS 1.5 m reflector and the SMARTS 0.9 m reflector. The purpose of CTIOPI is to discover nearby red, white, and brown dwarfs that lurk unidentified in the solar neighborhood. The goal is to discover 300 new southern star systems within 25 parsecs by determining trigonometric parallaxes accurate to 3 milliarcseconds.

== Telescopes ==

* The Víctor M. Blanco Telescope (Blanco 4m) was completed in 1974 and is very similar to the Nicholas U. Mayall Telescope that was completed at KPNO in 1973. Testing of the telescope and instruments lasted until the beginning of 1976 when science operations began. The Blanco 4m is the only telescope on Cerro Tololo managed directly by NOIRLab.
* The Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR) is an optical and near-infrared telescope located on Cerro Pachón. It was dedicated in 2004 and is managed by NOIRLab for an international consortium of which NOIRLab is a partner.

=== SMARTS telescopes ===

* The SMARTS Telescope is a Cassegrain reflector on an equatorial mount. Regular observations began in 1968.
* The SMARTS Telescope is a Cassegrain reflector on an equatorial mount. It was built by M3 Engineering and Technology Corporation and used for the 2-micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). It began operating in 1998 and was given to CTIO in 2001 after the survey was completed.
* The SMARTS Yale Telescope is a closed-tube Cassegrain reflector built by Boller and Chivens. It was first installed in 1965 at the Bethany Observing Station of the Yale University Observatory. It was moved to CTIO in 1974. From 1998 to 2002, it was used by the Yale University–AURA–University of Lisbon–Ohio State University (YALO) consortium with a custom-built sensor. In 2004 it was integrated into SMARTS.
* The SMARTS Telescope is a closed-tube Cassegrain reflector. It was installed at CTIO in 1966.

=== Tenant telescopes ===

* The Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA) South Telescope is a reflecting telescope built by Boller and Chivens. Installed in 1968 for the International Planetary Patrol Program, it was owned and operated by Lowell Observatory. At some point control shift to CTIO, which lasted until 1996, after which Lowell used the telescope intermittently. It was refurbished by SARA and put back into use in 2010. Observing time is shared between the members of the SARA consortium. 
* The Curtis-Schmidt Telescope is a Schmidt camera that was installed at CTIO in 1966. Previously, it was located at the University of Michigan&#x27;s Portage Lake Observatory. It is currently used for the Michigan Orbital DEbris Survey Telescope (MODEST) project, which is part of NASA&#x27;s program to detect and catalog orbital debris. Two-thirds of observing time was at the discretion of NOAO prior to 2001. From 1989 to 1995 it was used in part by the Calán/Tololo Survey. 
* The Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) is a custom-built telescope used to study the warm ionized medium. In 2009, it was moved to CTIO from KPNO, where it operated from 1996 to 2008.
* A reflecting telescope built by Officina Stellare of Italy was installed in 2010 as part of the Chilean Automatic Supernova Search (CHASE). The project is run by the Center for Excellence in Astrophysics and Associated Technologies (CATA) of the University of Chile Department of Astronomy. The telescope will also be part of Global Robotic-telescopes Intelligent Array (GLORIA). It is located in the building that previously housed the Millimeter-wave Telescope. The existing dome was replaced by a new clamshell-style dome as part of the project. CHASE has used the PROMPT telescopes for 10% of the time since 2009.
* The Panchromatic Robotic Optical Monitoring and Polarimetry Telescopes (PROMPT) installation consists of five Ritchey-Chrétien reflectors built by RC Optical Systems. Each telescope is fitted with a filter and camera designed to observe gamma ray bursts at different wavelengths. When not observing an event, the telescopes are used remotely by public school students in North Carolina. Construction of six fully automated domes started in 2004 and the telescopes began operating in 2006. The status of a sixth telescope, originally planned to observe at near-infrared wavelengths, is unclear. The building for a seventh PROMPT telescope, a larger unit, was completed in 2011.
* The Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) deployed an observing station to study helioseismology in 1995.
* Eight 40 cm telescopes, each equipped with a CCD camera sensitive to red optical and near-infrared light used by the MEarth Project.
* Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network operates three and two telescopes at Cerro Tololo. Construction of the domes began in 2010 and was completed in 2011. The telescopes were installed and commissioned in 2012.
* The Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), led by the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI), operates a telescope as part network of three telescopes dedicated to detecting exoplanets. The large CCD camera was installed on the telescope in September 2014.
* The Evryscope is a multiple-aperture (22x telescopes) wide-field survey telescope taking approximately 5000 images per night.
* The T80S telescope is operated by the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) collaboration.

=== Former telescopes ===
* The Millimeter-wave Telescope is a Cassegrain reflector with a primary mirror made of machined aluminum, remachined in USA by Phelps-Dodge to a surface accuracy of lambda/400. It was installed at CTIO in 1982, and an identical telescope is located at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian. It was used for spectrometric mapping-surveys of the distribution of Carbon Monoxide at a rest-wavelength of 2.6 millimeters in molecular clouds in the third and fourth quadrants of the Milky Way, and in the Magellanic Clouds while at CTIO. In 2009, it was moved to the Chilean National Astronomical Observatory&#x27;s campus on Cerro Calán near Santiago.
* A telescope was transported to the summit on mules in 1961 to perform site testing. It was later installed in a dome at CTIO in 1965. Its dome was used by the Millimeter-wave Telescope beginning in 1982.
* A second telescope was installed in 1965. It was removed at some point and the building was used for UCAC.
* A astrograph was used by the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC) project from 1998 to 2001. It was located in one of the 16-inch telescope domes. After surveying the southern sky, it was moved to United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station to complete its mission.
* The Southern H-Alpha Sky Survey Atlas (SHASSA) operated at CTIO from 1997 to 2006 in its own small dome, which was dubbed &quot;El Enano&quot; (&#x27;the Dwarf&#x27;) by the local staff. It was removed at the end of the project and donated to a school in La Serena.

=== Future telescopes ===

* The Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST) is a reflecting telescope under construction on Cerro Pachón. Construction began in 2011 and first light is expected in late 2015. It will be used for an astronomical survey similar to the 2MASS survey performed at CTIO. As with Gemini, the LSST will be managed separately from CTIO.. A smaller 1.4-meter support telescope for LSST will be built on an adjacent peak.

=== Other scientific projects ===
* The Andes Lidar Observatory is a National Science Foundation project to measure the upper atmosphere above the Andes which uses several passive optical instruments.

== Discoveries ==



On the morning of Saturday, December 7, 2013, Luis González, a research assistant at the University of Chile, discovered what would later be confirmed as a supernova by José Maza, an astronomer at University of Chile and a researcher for CATA (Centro de Astrofísica y Tecnologías Afines or “Centre for Astrophysics and Related Technologies”). The supernova is the first discovery to be made by the CATA 500, a robotic telescope designed and operated by a Chilean team located in Santiago, approximately 500 kilometres to the south. It is part of the GLORIA project, which provides open access to astronomers from around the world to a network of remotely operated robotic telescopes.
The new supernova lies in the galaxy ESO 365-G16, located 370 million light years from Earth, and has a mass eight times that of the Sun.

Gomez&#x27;s Hamburger, believed to be a young star surrounded by a protoplanetary disk, was discovered in 1985 on sky photographs obtained by Arturo Gomez, support technical staff at the Observatory.

<text>The fallacy of the single cause, also known as complex cause, causal oversimplification, causal reductionism, root cause fallacy, and reduction fallacy, is an informal fallacy of questionable cause that occurs when it is assumed that there is a single, simple cause of an outcome when in reality it may have been caused by a number of only jointly sufficient causes.

Fallacy of the single cause can be logically reduced to: &quot;X caused Y; therefore, X was the only cause of Y&quot; (although A,B,C...etc. also contributed to Y.)

Causal is a specific kind of false dilemma where conjoint possibilities are ignored. In other words, the possible causes are assumed to be &quot;A xor B xor C&quot; when &quot;A and B and C&quot; or &quot;A and B and not C&quot; (etc.) are not taken into consideration; i.e. the &quot;or&quot; is not exclusive.

<doc id="599254" wikidata="Q666014" url="?curid=599254" title="Convivio">
<text>Convivio (;) (&quot;The Banquet&quot;) is an unfinished work written by Dante Alighieri roughly between 1304 and 1307. It consists of four &quot;books, or, &quot;&quot;tratatti&quot;: a prefatory one, plus three books that each include a canzone (long lyrical poem) and a prose allegorical interpretation or commentary of the poem that goes off in multiple thematic directions.

== Summary ==
The &quot;Convivio&quot; is a kind of vernacular encyclopedia of the knowledge of Dante&#x27;s time; it touches on many areas of learning, not only philosophy but also politics, linguistics, science, astronomy, and history. The treatise begins with the prefatory book, or proem, which explains why a book like the &quot;Convivio&quot; is needed and why Dante is writing it in the vernacular instead of Latin. It is one of Dante&#x27;s early defenses of the vernacular, expressed in greater detail in his (slightly earlier) linguistic treatise &quot;De vulgari eloquentia&quot; (On Eloquence in the Vernacular). 

Books 2 and 3 form a unit, both focusing on Dante&#x27;s new love after the death of Beatrice—his love for Lady Philosophy, &quot;the most beautiful and dignified daughter of the Emperor of the universe,&quot; as he calls her. Book 2 discusses allegory and Lady Philosophy using the canzone &quot;Voi che ’ntendendo il terzo ciel movete&quot; (You who move the third heaven with an act of the intellect), which opens the book. It also discusses such subjects as astronomy, angelology, and the soul&#x27;s immortality. Book 3 is a hymn of praise for philosophy, launched by an allegorical interpretation of Dante&#x27;s great canzone &quot;Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona&quot; (Love, who speaks to me in my mind). In this book, Dante asserts that true philosophy cannot arise from any ulterior motives, such as prestige or money—it is only possible when the seeker has a love of wisdom for its own sake. 

Book 4 is by far the longest of the &quot;Convivio&quot;, and is noticeably distinct from the two books that precede it. The subject of book 4 is the nature of nobility. It opens with the longest canzone of the Convivio, &quot;Le dolci rime d’amor&quot; (Those sweet poems of love), which is explicitly about gentilezza or nobility, as well as a condemnation of avarice, asserting that reason and the spirit of acquisition are mutually incompatible. The first half of book 4&#x27;s thirty chapters are dedicated to debunking the false idea of nobility as an inherited trait, one restricted to the aristocracy, while the final fifteen chapters delineate what true nobility consists of—the perfection of a thing according to its nature—and how nobility manifests in people at various stages of life. The &quot;Convivio&quot;, in its autobiographical passages and in the trajectories of its lines of thought, gives us a rich portrait of Dante himself, of great importance for an understanding of his work as a whole, especially the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;.

== Analysis ==
The &quot;Convivio&quot; is a major stage of development for Dante, very different from the visionary world of the &quot;Vita Nuova&quot; (although like the earlier work it too is a medium for the author’s evolving sense of artistic vocation and philosophical-spiritual quest). This difference is reflected in how the two works use the &quot;prosimetrum&quot; format: in the &quot;Vita Nova&quot; there is a complex interrelation and intertwining between the prose and the poetry, while in the &quot;Convivio&quot; large blocks of prose have an autonomous existence apart from the poems; the content of the poetry is not amplified or edited in the prose so much as commented upon prosaically, to serve as points of departure for the various subjects that the &quot;Convivio&quot; discusses. Dante himself tells us that the prose of the &quot;Convivio&quot; is &quot;temperate and virile,&quot; in contrast to the &quot;fervid and passionate&quot; prose of the &quot;Vita Nova&quot;; and that while the approach to this in the work of his youth was &quot;like dreaming&quot; the &quot;Convivio&quot; approaches it subjects soberly and wide awake, often modeling its style on Scholastic authors.

<doc id="599261" wikidata="Q466880" url="?curid=599261" title="American Society of Civil Engineers">
<text>The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) is a tax-exempt professional body founded in 1852 to represent members of the civil engineering profession worldwide. Headquartered in Reston, Virginia, it is the oldest national engineering society in the United States. Its constitution was based on the older Boston Society of Civil Engineers from 1848.

ASCE is dedicated to the advancement of the science and profession of civil engineering and the enhancement of human welfare through the activities of society members. It has more than 143,000 members in 177 countries. Its mission is to provide essential value to members, their careers, partners, and the public; facilitate the advancement of technology; encourage and provide the tools for lifelong learning; promote professionalism and the profession; develop and support civil engineers.

==History==
The first serious and documented attempts to organize civil engineers as a professional society in the newly created United States were in the early 19th century. In 1828, John Kilbourn of Ohio managed a short-lived &quot;Civil Engineering Journal,&quot; editorializing about the recent incorporation of the Institution of Civil Engineers in Great Britain that same year, Kilbourn suggested that the American corps of engineers could constitute an American society of civil engineers. Later, in 1834, an American trade periodical, the &quot;American Railroad Journal,&quot; advocated for a similar national organization of civil engineers.

=== Institution of American Civil Engineers ===
On December 17, 1838, a petition started circulating asking civil engineers to meet in 1839 in Baltimore, Maryland, to organize a permanent society of civil engineers. Prior to that, thirteen notable civil engineers largely identifiable as being from New York, Pennsylvania, or Maryland met in Philadelphia. This group presented the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia with a formal proposal that an Institution of American Civil Engineers be established as an adjunct of the Franklin...&quot; Some of them were: 
* Benjamin Wright. In 1969, the American Society of Civil Engineers declared Wright to be the &#x27;Father of American Civil Engineering&#x27;.
* William Strickland 
* Pennsylvanians Edward Miller and Solomon. W. Roberts, the latter being Chief Engineer for the Allegheny Portage railroad, the first crossing of the Allegheny mountains (1831–1834) 
Forty engineers actually appeared at the February 1839 meeting in Baltimore, including J. Edgar Thomson (Future Chief Engineer and later President of the Pennsylvania Railroad), Wright, Roberts, Edward Miller, and the Maryland engineers Isaac Trimble and Benjamin Henry Latrobe II and attendees from as far as Massachusetts, Illinois, and Louisiana. Subsequently, a group met again in Philadelphia, led by its Secretary, Edward Miller to take steps to formalize the society, participants now included such other notable engineers as: 
* John B. Jervis
* Claudius Crozet
* William Gibbs McNeill
* George Washington Whistler
* Walter Gwynn 
* J. Edgar Thompson
* Sylvester Welch, brother of future ASCE president Ashbel Welch
* Jonathan Knight
* Benjamin Henry Latrobe II
* Moncure Robinson. 
Miller drafted a proposed constitution that defined society&#x27;s purpose as &quot;the collection and diffusion of professional knowledge, the advancement of mechanical philosophy, and the elevation of the character and standing of the Civil Engineers of the United States.&quot; Membership in the new society restricted membership to engineers, and &quot;architects and eminent machinists were to be admitted only as Associates.&quot;
The proposed constitution failed, and no further attempts were made to form another society. Miller later ascribed the failure to the difficulties of assembling members due to available means for traveling in the country at the time. One of the other difficulties members would have to contend with was the requirement to produce each year one previously unpublished paper or &quot;...present a scientific book, map, plan or model, not already in the possession of the Society, under the penalty of $10.&quot; 
In that same period, the editor of the &quot;American Railroad Journal&quot; commented that effort had failed in part due to certain jealousies that arose due to the proposed affiliation with the Franklin Institute. That journal continued discussion on forming an engineers&#x27; organization from 1839 thru 1843 serving its own self-interests in advocating its journal as a replacement for a professional society but to no avail.

=== The American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects ===
During the 1840s, professional organizations continued to develop and organize in the United States. The organizers&#x27; motives were largely to &quot;improve common standards, foster research, and disseminate knowledge through meetings and publications.&quot; Unlike earlier associations such as the American Philosophical Society, these newer associations were not seeking to limit membership as much as pursue &quot;more specialized interests.&quot; Examples of this surge in new professional organizations in America were the American Statistical Association (1839), American Ethnological Society (1842), American Medical Association (1847), American Association for the Advancement of Science, (1848) and National Education Association (1852).

During this same period of association incorporations in the 1840s, attempts were again made at organizing an American engineer association. They succeeded at first with the Boston Society of Civil Engineers, organized in 1848, and then in October 1852, with an effort to organize a Society of Civil Engineers and Architects in New York. Led by Alfred W. Craven, Chief Engineer of the Croton Aqueduct and future ASCE president, the meeting resolved to incorporate the society under the name &quot;American Society of Civil Engineers And Architects&quot;. Membership eligibility was restricted to &quot;civil, geological, mining and mechanical Engineers, architects, and other persons who, by profession, are interested in the advancement of science.&quot; James Laurie was elected the society&#x27;s first president. At an early meeting of the Board of Direction in 1852, instructions were given for the incorporation of the &quot;American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects&quot; but this was the proper steps were never taken, and therefore this name never legally belonged to the association. The ASCE held its first meetings at the Croton Aqueduct Department building in City Hall Park, Manhattan. The meetings only went through 1855 and with the advent of the American Civil War, the society suspended its activities.

=== Late 19th century ===
The next meeting was more than twelve years later in 1867. A number of the original founders, such as James Laurie, J.W. Adams, C. W. Copeland, and W. H. Talcott, were at this meeting and were dedicated to the objective of resuscitating the society. They also planned to put the society on a more permanent footing and elect fifty-four new members. With success in that effort, the young engineering society passed a resolution noting that its preservation was mainly due to the persevering efforts of its first president, James Laurie. The address of President James Pugh Kirkwood delivered at that meeting in 1867 was the first publication of the society, appearing in Volume 1 of &quot;Transactions&quot;, bearing date of 1872.

On March 4, 1868, by a vote of 17 to 4, the name was changed to &quot;American Society of Civil Engineers&quot;, but it was not until April 17, 1877, that the lack of incorporation was discovered and the proper steps taken to remedy the defect. The society was then chartered and incorporated in New York state. 

The reconvened ASCE met at the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York until 1875 when the society moved to 4 East 23rd Street. The ASCE moved again in 1877 to 104 East 20th Street and in 1881 to 127 East 23rd Street. The ASCE commissioned a new headquarters at 220 West 57th Street in 1895. The building was completed in 1897 and served as the society&#x27;s headquarters until 1917 when the ASCE moved to the Engineering Societies&#x27; Building. 

===20th century===
Nora Stanton Barney was among the first women in the United States to earn a civil engineering degree, graduating from Cornell University in 1905. In the same year, she was accepted as a junior member of the organization and began work for the New York City Board of Water Supply. She was the first female member of ASCE, where she was allowed to be a junior member, but was denied advancement to associate member in 1916 because of her gender. In 2015, she was posthumously advanced to ASCE Fellow status.
In 1999, the ASCE elected the top-ten &quot;civil engineering achievements that had the greatest positive impact on life in the 20th century&quot; in &quot;broad categories&quot;. Monuments of the Millennium were a &quot;combination of technical engineering achievement, courage and inspiration, and a dramatic influence on the development of [their] communities&quot;.
The achievements and monuments that best exemplified them included:

* Airport design and development the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan
* Dams the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River in the United States
* Interstate Highway System &quot;the system overall&quot;
* Long-span bridges like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California
* Rail transportation as exemplified by the Eurotunnel rail system connecting the UK and France
* Sanitary landfills and solid waste disposal &quot;sanitary waste disposal advances overall&quot;
* Skyscrapers the Empire State Building in Midtown Manhattan, New York City
* Wastewater treatment the Chicago wastewater system
* Water supply and distribution the California State Water Project
* Water transportation the Panama Canal

==Overview==
ASCE&#x27;s mission is to deliver essential value to &quot;its members, their careers, our partners, and the public&quot; as well as enable &quot;the advancement of technology, encourage and provide the tools for lifelong learning, promote professionalism and the profession.&quot; The society also seeks to &quot;develop and support civil engineer leaders, and advocate infrastructure and environmental stewardship.&quot; The society as an exempt organization in the United States (Section 501(c)(3)) was required to reported its program service accomplishments and related expenses and revenues.

===Publications===

ASCE stated that dissemination of technical and professional information to the civil engineering profession was a major goal of the society. This is accomplished through a variety of publications and information products, including 35 technical and professional journals amongst them:

* &quot;ASCE Journal of Structural Engineering&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Environmental Engineering&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Hydraulic Engineering&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Hydrologic Engineering&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Transportation Engineering, Part A: Systems&quot;

* &quot;Journal of Transportation Engineering, Part B: Pavements&quot;

* &quot;Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management&quot;
* &quot;Civil Engineering&quot;, the society&#x27;s monthly magazine

They also publish an online bibliographic database, conference proceedings, standards, manuals of practice, and technical reports. 

The ASCE Library contains 470+ E-books and standards, some with chapter-level access and no restrictive DRM, and 600+ online proceedings.

===Conferences, meetings, and education===
Each year, more than 55,000 engineers earn continuing education units (CEUs) and/or professional development hours (PDHs) by participating in ASCE&#x27;s continuing education programs. ASCE hosts more than 15 annual and specialty conferences, over 200 continuing education seminars and more than 300 live web seminars. Meetings include &quot;...committees, task forces, focus groups, workshops and seminars designed to bring together civil engineering experts either from specific fields or those with a broad range of experience and skills. These meetings deal with specific topics and issues facing civil engineers such as America&#x27;s failing infrastructure, sustainability, earthquakes, and bridge collapses.&quot;

===Engineering programs===
The engineering programs division directly advances the science of engineering by delivering technical content for ASCE&#x27;s publications, conferences and continuing education programs. It consists of eight discipline-specific institutes, four technical divisions, and six technical councils. The work is accomplished by over 600 technical committees with editorial responsibility for 28 of ASCE&#x27;s 33 journals. On an annual basis, the division conducts more than twelve congresses and specialty conferences. As a founding society of ANSI and accredited standards development organization, ASCE committees use an established and audited process to produce consensus standards under a program supervised by the society&#x27;s Codes and Standards Committee.

Civil Engineering Certification Inc. (CEC), affiliated with ASCE, has been established to support specialty certification academies for civil engineering specialties and is accredited by the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards (CESB). CEC also handles safety certification for state, municipal, and federal buildings, formerly the province of the now-defunct Building Security Council. The Committee on Critical Infrastructure (CCI) provides vision and guidance on ASCE activities related to critical infrastructure resilience, including planning, design, construction, O&amp;M, and event mitigation, response and recovery.

Certification is the recognition of attaining advanced knowledge and skills in a specialty area of civil engineering. ASCE offers certifications for engineers who demonstrate advanced knowledge and skills in their area of engineering.
*American Academy of Water Resources Engineers (AAWRE)
*Academy of Geo-Professionals (AGP)
*Academy of Coastal, Ocean, Port &amp; Navigation Engineers (ACOPNE)

==Institutes==
ASCE also has nine full-service institutes created to serve working professionals working within specialized fields of civil engineering:
*Architectural Engineering Institute (AEI)

==Advocacy==
To advance its policy mission, ASCE &quot;...identifies legislation to improve the nation&#x27;s infrastructure, and advance the profession of engineering specifically, ASCE lobbied on legislation at the Federal, State and local levels. In 2015, ASCE&#x27;s Lobbying at the Federal level was focused primarily upon:
*Reauthorization of the federal surface transportation programs such as Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21)
*Reauthorization of the brownfields revitalization and environmental restoration act. 
*Reauthorization of the national dam safety program and creation of a national levee safety program due to National Levee Safety Act Of 2007, WRDA Title IX, Section 9000.
*Reauthorization of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund program 
*Reauthorization of the drinking water state revolving fund program 
*Water resources development act 
*funding for stem education programs 
*Reauthorization of the 1977 national earthquake hazards reduction program 
*Reauthorization of the national windstorm impact reduction act 
*Safe building code incentive act 
*Appropriations for federal programs relating to civil engineering, including surface transportation, aviation, water resources, environment, education, homeland security, and research and development. 
Lobbying at the state and local level focused primarily upon licensure of civil engineers, procurement of engineering services, continuing education, and the financing of infrastructure improvements as well as lobbying at the state level to raise the minimum requirements for licensure as a professional engineer as part of ASCE&#x27;s Raise the Bar (RTB) and Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge (CEBoK) initiatives.

For 2018, ASCE identified Federal advocacy priorities as follows:
* Civil engineering education (higher education)
* Clean water, drinking water and wastewater issues
* Natural hazards mitigation &amp; infrastructure security
* Qualifications-Based Selection for engineering services
* Research and Development Funding
* Science, technology, engineering and math(STEM) education &amp; support (K-12)
* Sustainability, implicitly sustainable engineering
* Transportation infrastructure 
The State advocacy priorities in 2018 are as follows:
* Licensing
* Natural Hazards Impact Mitigation
* Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education &amp; support (K-12)
* State support for civil engineering higher education
* Sustainability, implicitly sustainable engineering
* Tort reform &amp; indemnification for pro bono services
* Transportation infrastructure financing

===Strategic issues and initiatives===
To promote the society&#x27;s objectives and address key issues facing the civil engineering profession, ASCE developed three strategic initiatives: Sustainable Infrastructure, the ASCE Grand Challenge, and Raise the Bar.

==Awards and designations==

ASCE honors civil engineers through many Society Awards including the Norman medal (1874), Wellington prize (1921), Huber Civil Engineering Research Prize, the Outstanding Projects and Leaders (OPAL) awards in the categories of construction, design, education, government and management, the Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement (OCEA) for projects, the Henry L. Michel Award for Industry Advancement of Research and the Charles Pankow Award for innovation, 12 scholarships and fellowships for student members. 
Created in 1968 by ASCE&#x27;s Sanitary Engineering Division, the Wesley W. Horner award is named after former ASCE President Wesley W. Horner, and given to a recently peer reviewed published paper in the fields of hydrology, urban drainage, or sewerage. Special consideration is given to private practice engineering work that is recognized as a valuable contribution to the field of environmental engineering.
The Lifetime Achievement Award has been presented annually since 1999 and recognizes five different individual leaders. One award is present in each category of design, construction, government, education, and management.

=== Walter L. Huber Civil Engineering Research Prize ===

In July 1946, the Board of Direction authorized annual awards on recommendation by the society&#x27;s Committee on Research to stimulate research in civil engineering. In October 1964, Mrs. Alberta Reed Huber endowed these prizes in honor of her husband, Walter L. Huber, past president, ASCE. The Huber Prize is considered the highest level mid-career research prize in civil engineering and is awarded for outstanding achievements and contributions in research with respect to all disciplines of civil engineering.

====LTPP International Data Analysis Contest Award====

The LTPP International Data Analysis Contest is an annual data analysis contest held by the ASCE in collaboration with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The participants are supposed to use the LTPP data.

==ASCE Foundation==
The ASCE Foundation is a charitable foundation established in 1994 to support and promote civil engineering programs that &quot;... enhance quality of life, promote the profession, advance technical practices, and prepare civil engineers for tomorrow.&quot; It is incorporated separately from the ASCE, although it has a close relationship to it and all the foundation&#x27;s personnel are employees of ASCE. The foundation board of directors has seven persons and its bylaws require that four of the seven directors must be ASCE officers as well and the ASCE executive director and chief financial officer must also be ASCE employees. The foundation&#x27;s support is most often to ASCE&#x27;s charitable, educational and scientific programs. The foundation&#x27;s largest program is supporting three strategic areas; lifelong learning and leadership, advocacy for infrastructure investment and the role of civil engineers in sustainable practices. In 2014, this foundation&#x27;s support in these areas was almost US$4 million.

==Criticisms and historical controversies==
===Controversies in New Orleans levee investigations===
====Press release of expert review panel 2007====
ASCE provides peer reviews at the request of public agencies and projects as a &quot;means to improve the management and quality of [public agency] services and thus better protect the public health and safety with which they are entrusted&quot;. 
After the 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans, the commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Lt Gen Carl Strock P.E., M.ASCE) requested that ASCE create an expert review panel to peer review the corps-sponsored Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force, the body commissioned by the corps to assess the performance of the hurricane protection system in metro New Orleans. Lawrence Roth, deputy executive director of the ASCE led the ERP development, served as the panel&#x27;s chief of staff and facilitated its interaction with IPET. 
The expert panel&#x27;s role was to provide an independent technical review of the IPET&#x27;s activities and findings, as stated at a National Research Council meeting in New Orleans: &quot;an independent review panel ensure[s] that the outcome is a robust, credible and defensible performance evaluation&quot;. On February 12, 2007, Lt. Gen Strock gave all expert review panel members an Outstanding Civilian Service Medals.

On June 1, 2007, the ASCE issued its expert review panel report, and an accompanying press release. The press release was considered controversial because it contained information not present in the report, conflicting with the report, and minimized the Army Corps&#x27; involvement in the catastrophe: &quot;Even without breaching, Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s rainfall and surge overtopping would have caused extensive and severe flooding—and the worst loss of life and property loss ever experienced in New Orleans.&quot; The report stated that had levees and pump stations not failed, &quot;far less property loss would have occurred and nearly two-thirds of deaths could have been avoided.&quot; The ASCE administration was criticized by the &quot;Times-Picayune&quot; for an attempt to minimize and understate the role of the Army Corps in the flooding.

====Ethics complaint====
In October 2007, Raymond Seed, a University of California-Berkeley civil engineering professor and ASCE member, submitted a 42-page ethics complaint to the ASCE alleging that the corps of engineers with ASCE&#x27;s help sought to minimize the corps&#x27; mistakes in the flooding, intimidate anyone who tried to intervene, and delay the final results until the public&#x27;s attention had turned elsewhere. The corps acknowledged receiving a copy of the letter and refused to comment until the ASCE&#x27;s Committee on Professional Conduct (CPC) had commented on the complaint. It took over a year for the ASCE to announce the results of the CPC. The ASCE self-study panel did not file charges of ethical misconduct and blamed errors on &quot;staff&quot; and not review panel members having created the June press release.&quot;

====Review panels to examine alleged ethics breaches====
On November 14, 2007, ASCE announced that U.S. Congressman Sherwood Boehlert, R‑N.Y. (ret), would lead an independent task force of outside experts to review how ASCE participated in engineering studies of national significance. ASCE President David Mongan said the review was to address criticism of ASCE´s role in assisting the Army Corps of Engineers-sponsored investigation of Katrina failures. Mongan assured citizens of metro New Orleans in a letter to the &quot;Times Picayune&quot;, that ASCE took &quot;this matter very seriously and that appropriate actions are being taken&quot;.

The panel recommended in results released on September 12, 2008, that ASCE should immediately take steps to remove the potential for conflict of interest in its participation in post-disaster engineering studies. The most important recommendations were that peer review funds over $1 million should come from a separate source, like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), that ASCE should facilitate but not control the assessment teams, and that information to the public and press should be disseminated not under the extremely tight controls that Ray Seed and his team experienced. It concluded that ASCE should draw up an ethics policy to eliminate questions of possible conflicts of interest.

On April 6, 2009, an internal probe with the ASCE issued a report that ordered a retraction of the ASCE&#x27;s June 1, 2007, press release. The panel determined that the press release had &quot;inadvertently conveyed a misleading impression regarding the role of engineering failures in the devastation of New Orleans&quot;, that it incorrectly said that surge levels along Mississippi&#x27;s coastline were higher than water levels caused by a tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004, and that it had incorrectly repeated estimates of deaths and property damage in New Orleans that might have occurred if levees and floodwalls had not been breached.

==== Grassroots group spoof of ASCE–USACE relationship ====
On November 5, 2007, New Orleans–based grassroots group &quot;Levees.org&quot; led by Sandy Rosenthal criticized the ASCE&#x27;s close relationship with the United States Army Corps of Engineers in a spoof online public service announcement. On November 12, 2007, the ASCE asked Levees.org to remove the video from the internet, threatening the organization with legal action if it did not comply. On November 13, the Times-Picayune posted the video on its website. Flanked by lawyers with Adams and Reese in the presence of extensive media coverage, the group ignored the threat and posted the video to YouTube citing Louisiana&#x27;s Anti-SLAPP statute, a &quot;strategic lawsuit against public participation&quot;, which allows courts to weed out lawsuits designed to chill public participation on matters of public significance. In a response for comment, ASCE President Mongan replied, &quot;Since the video has already been widely reposted by other organizations, moving forward, we feel our time and expertise are best utilized working to help protect the residents of New Orleans from future storms and flooding.&quot;

====USACE grant money for disinformation, 2008====
In March 2008, Levees.org announced that records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that as early October 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers had directed and later paid the ASCE more than $1.1 million for its peer review (Grant Number: W912HZ-06-1-0001). The grant also paid for a series of misleading ASCE presentations attempting to shift blame away from the corps and onto local levee officials. Members of the ASCE are forbidden from making false or exaggerated statements and also from making statements for an interested party unless this is disclosed. Levees.org claimed the records showed how the external peer review would be done in four phases: Phase 1 was research and analysis on the performance of the levees, floodwalls and other important structures. Phase 2 was provision of information on the current system to prevent future flooding. Phase 3 was provision of information to evaluate alternative approaches to flood protection. Phase 4 was transfer information and knowledge gained to a broader audience within Corps and its consultancy community to communicate lessons learned. The group claimed that these records were proof that ASCE&#x27;s routine powerpoint presentation from 2007 and 2008 were a public relations campaign to repair the corps&#x27; reputation. ASCE officials responded that ASCE paid for the powerpoint presentations itself and had not used USACE grant money for that purpose.

<text>The pyramidal tracts include both the corticobulbar tract and the corticospinal tract. These are aggregations of efferent nerve fibers from the upper motor neurons that travel from the cerebral cortex and terminate either in the brainstem (&quot;corticobulbar&quot;) or spinal cord (&quot;corticospinal&quot;) and are involved in the control of motor functions of the body.

The corticobulbar tract conducts impulses from the brain to the cranial nerves. These nerves control the muscles of the face and neck and are involved in facial expression, mastication, swallowing, and other motor functions.

The corticospinal tract conducts impulses from the brain to the spinal cord. It is made up of a lateral and anterior tract. The corticospinal tract is involved in voluntary movement. The majority of fibres of the corticospinal tract cross over in the medulla oblongata, resulting in muscles being controlled by the opposite side of the brain. The corticospinal tract contains the axons of the pyramidal cells, the largest of which are the Betz cells, located in the primary motor cortex.

The pyramidal tracts are named because they pass through the pyramids of the medulla oblongata. The corticospinal fibers converge to a point when descending from the internal capsule to the brain stem from multiple directions, giving the impression of an inverted pyramid. Involvement of the pyramidal tract at any level leads to pyramidal signs.

The myelination of the pyramidal fibres is incomplete at birth and gradually progresses in cranio-caudal direction and thereby progressively gaining functionality. Most of the myelination is complete by two years of age and thereafter it progresses very slowly in cranio-caudal direction up to twelve years of age.

==Structure==

The term &quot;pyramidal tracts&quot; refers to upper motor neurons that originate in the cerebral cortex and terminate in the spinal cord (&quot;corticospinal&quot;) or brainstem (&quot;corticobulbar&quot;). Nerves emerge in the cerebral cortex, pass down and may cross sides in the medulla oblongata, and travel as part of the spinal cord until they synapse with interneurons in the grey column of the spinal cord.

There is some variation in terminology. The &quot;pyramidal tracts&quot; definitively encompass the corticospinal tracts, and many authors also include the corticobulbar tracts.

===Corticospinal tract===

Nerve fibres in the corticospinal tract originate from pyramidal cells in layer V of the cerebral cortex. Fibres arise from the primary motor cortex (about 30%), supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex (together also about 30%), and the somatosensory cortex, parietal lobe, and cingulate gyrus supplies the rest. The cells have their bodies in the cerebral cortex, and the axons form the bulk of the pyramidal tracts. The nerve axons travel from the cortex through the posterior limb of internal capsule, through the cerebral peduncle and into the brainstem and anterior medulla oblongata. Here they form two prominences called the medulla oblongatary pyramids. Below the prominences, the majority of axons cross over to the opposite side from which they originated, known as decussation. The axons that cross over move to the outer part of the medulla oblongata and form the lateral corticospinal tract, whereas the fibres that remain form the anterior corticospinal tract. About 80% of axons cross over and form the lateral corticospinal tract; 10% do not cross over and join the tract, and 10% of fibres travel in the anterior corticospinal tract. 

The nerve axons traveling down the tract are the efferent nerve fibers of the upper motor neurons. These axons travel down the tracts in the white matter of the spinal cord until they reach the vertebral level of the muscle that they will innervate. At this point, the axons synapse with lower motor neurons. The majority of axons do not directly synapse with lower motor neurons, but instead synapse with an interneuron that then synapses with a lower motor neuron. This generally occurs in the anterior grey column. Nerve axons of the lateral corticospinal tract that did not cross over in the medulla oblongata do so at the level of the spinal cord they terminate in.

These tracts contain more than 1 million axons and the majority of the axons are myelinated. The corticospinal tracts myelinate largely during the first and second years after birth. The majority of nerve axons are small (&lt;4μm) in diameter. About 3% of nerve axons have a much larger diameter (16μm) and arise from Betz cells, mostly in the leg area of the primary motor cortex. These cells are notable because of their rapid conduction rate, over 70m/sec, the fastest conduction of any signals from the brain to the spinal cord.

===Corticobulbar tract===

Fibres from the ventral motor cortex travel with the corticospinal tract through the internal capsule, but terminate in a number of locations in the midbrain (cortico-mesencephalic tract), pons (Corticopontine tract), and medulla oblongata (cortico-bulbar tract). The upper motor neurons of the corticobulbar tract synapse with interneurons or directly with the lower motor neurons located in the motor cranial nerve nuclei, namely oculomotor, trochlear, motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, abducens, facial nerve and accessory and in the nucleus ambiguus to the hypoglossal, vagus and accessory nerves. These nuclei are supplied by nerves from both sides of the brain, with the exception of the parts of the facial nerve that control muscles of the lower face. These muscles are only innervated by nerves from the contralateral (opposite) side of the cortex.

==Function==
The nerves within the corticospinal tract are involved in movement of muscles of the body. Because of the crossing-over of fibres, muscles are supplied by the side of the brain opposite to that of the muscle. The nerves within the corticobulbar tract are involved in movement in muscles of the head. They are involved in swallowing, phonation, and movements of the tongue. By virtue of involvement with the facial nerve, the corticobulbar tract is also responsible for transmitting facial expression. With the exception of lower muscles of facial expression, all functions of the corticobulbar tract involve inputs from both sides of the brain.

The extrapyramidal system refers to tracts within the spinal cord involved in involuntary movement but not part of the pyramidal tracts. Their functions include the control of posture and muscle tone.

==Clinical significance==

# Damage to the fibres of the corticospinal tracts, anywhere along their course from the cerebral cortex to the lower end of the spinal cord, can cause an upper motor neuron syndrome. 
# A few days after the injury to the upper motor neurons, a pattern of motor signs and symptoms appears, including spasticity, hyperactive reflexes, a loss of the ability to perform fine movements, and an extensor plantar response known as the Babinski sign. 
# Symptoms generally occur alongside other sensory problems. 
# Causes may include disorders such as strokes, cerebral palsy, subdural hemorrhage, abscesses and tumours, neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple system atrophy, inflammation such as meningitis and multiple sclerosis, and trauma to the spinal cord, including from slipped discs.
# If the corticobulbar tract is damaged on only one side, then only the lower face will be affected, however if there is involvement of both the left and right tracts, then the result is pseudobulbar palsy. This causes problems with swallowing, speaking, and emotional lability.
# Severe disabling involuntary movements such as hemiballismus or severe chorea might exhaust the patient and become a life-threatening situation. 
# In the past, this condition was treated by partial section of the pyramidal tract either at the primary motor cortex or at the cerebral crus (pedunculotomy).

In &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot;, the Griswold family wins a vacation on a game show called &quot;Pig in a Poke&quot; when their opponents fail to correctly answer a question about the pyramidal tracts, despite Clark Griswold (played by Chevy Chase) mistakenly answering that they are a housing development outside Cairo.

<text>WrestleMania 21 (marketed as WrestleMania Goes Hollywood) was the 21st annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion&#x27;s Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on April 3, 2005, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California.

The main event of the show, which was the main match from the Raw brand, saw Batista challenge Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Batista won by pinfall after executing a Batista Bomb. The main match on the SmackDown! brand, which was the event&#x27;s penultimate match, saw John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) defend the WWE Championship against John Cena, which Cena won by pinfall after performing an FU marking Cena&#x27;s first world title reign of his world record sixteen. 

The undercard featured the first-ever Money in the Bank ladder match, as well as two inter-promotional matches with Randy Orton vs. The Undertaker and Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels. The event also featured the return of Stone Cold Steve Austin who then started his part-time appearances with WWE and also the final WrestleMania event that Eddie Guerrero competed in, going against his tag team partner Rey Mysterio. Guerrero succumbed to heart failure in November that same year.

WrestleMania 21 was the first WrestleMania held at Staples Center, but the fifth to take place in the Los Angeles metropolitan area (after 2, VII, XII, and 2000). Tickets sold out in less than one minute for the event, making it the fastest ticket sell-out in the company&#x27;s history as well as the fastest ticket sell-out at Staples Center. The event drew a Staples Center record attendance of 20,193 people from 37 countries and 50 states and grossed more than $7.1 million in ticket sales, making it the highest grossing WWE event ever at Staples Center. In addition to those in attendance, the event was seen by millions of fans in more than 190 countries.

===Background===

WrestleMania is considered World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s (WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE&#x27;s original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the &quot;Big Four&quot;. WrestleMania 21 was scheduled to be held on April 3, 2005, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. The event featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands. It was the first WrestleMania held at Staples Center, but the fifth to take place in the Los Angeles metropolitan area (after 2, VII, XII, and 2000).

In line with the event&#x27;s location and tagline, WrestleMania 21 was promoted on television with a series of parody movie trailers with WWE talent playing the starring roles from famous movies.

===Storylines===

At New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 9, Triple H won an Elimination Chamber match to win the vacant World Heavyweight Championship by last eliminating Randy Orton following outside interference from Evolution members Batista and Ric Flair. Three weeks later at the Royal Rumble, Triple H successfully defended the title against Orton while Batista won the 2005 Royal Rumble match, earning the right to compete in the main event of WrestleMania 21 against the champion of his choice. On the February 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H defeated Edge to retain the World Heavyweight Championship due to Batista&#x27;s interference. Afterward, as Batista raised Triple H&#x27;s hand and his championship, Batista got a close look at the World Heavyweight Championship, then stared Triple H down, looking as if he was thinking about challenging Triple H for the title. In an attempt to persuade Batista to challenge WWE Champion John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) rather than him at WrestleMania, Triple H concocted a scheme to have Batista run over by a limousine resembling the one used by JBL. Initially, Batista did not want help from Evolution and wanted to confront JBL by himself. Triple H insisted that Evolution accompany Batista anyway, saving him from the oncoming limousine. Batista became aware of the plot while eavesdropping on his fellow Evolution members and signed a contract guaranteeing him a match with Triple H at WrestleMania, thus leaving Evolution and officially turning him face. Batista pretended to sign with the SmackDown! brand, giving Triple H and Flair the &quot;thumbs up&quot;, but turned it into a &quot;thumbs down&quot; (alluding to the way Randy Orton was kicked out of Evolution after becoming World Heavyweight Champion at SummerSlam 2004) before attacking the pair. This led to Batista&#x27;s departure from the stable.

At No Way Out, John Cena defeated Kurt Angle to earn a spot in the SmackDown! main event at WrestleMania. During the latter event, John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) successfully defended the WWE Championship against the Big Show in a Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match. As a result of Cena&#x27;s win, he began a feud with JBL and his Cabinet. On the February 24 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, JBL was hosting a party as a celebration in honor of his win. Before the party could get started, however, Big Show came out and interrupted the celebration and attacked JBL and the Cabinet. Soon after, Cena came down and smashed the portrait over JBL&#x27;s head. Later that night, Cena and Big Show defeated JBL and Orlando Jordan. The following week, JBL cut a promo on Cena, and insulted him, while Cena defended his WWE United States Championship against Jordan. Jordan won the match and the United States Championship after the Basham Brothers distracted the referee, and JBL hit Cena with the WWE Championship belt. JBL then destroyed Cena&#x27;s customized United States Championship belt and replaced it with the original one. Later that night, Cena brought a steel lead pipe to the ring with him and ordered JBL to come out to the ring and fight him, only to have the SmackDown! General Manager, Theodore Long make his way to the ring and inform Cena that he had to wait until WrestleMania to get his hands on JBL. Cena then gave the ultimatum for Long to be part of a solution or part of the problem. Cena then stated, &quot;Since you&#x27;re not going to bring JBL out here, then you&#x27;re part of the problem.&quot; Cena then nailed Long with an FU and was thrown out of the arena. During JBL&#x27;s match that night, Cena returned and attacked The Cabinet. The next week, Long announced that if Cena laid a hand on JBL, apart from in matches, he would lose his WrestleMania match. In a Six-Man Tag Team match that night, Cena and the WWE Tag Team Champions, Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio defeated JBL and the Basham Brothers, but Cena had to stop himself from attacking JBL after the bell had rung. On the March 24 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Long clarified that if JBL physically provoked Cena, then Cena could retaliate. Cena then attempted to provoke JBL, by vandalizing his limousine, cutting off his tie, pouring water into his hat and spray painting &quot;FU&quot; on his shirt. On the last &quot;SmackDown!&quot; before WrestleMania, however, JBL interrupted Cena&#x27;s match against Carlito and had Cena arrested for vandalism. Once Cena was handcuffed, JBL nailed him with a low blow and ended the show by mocking Cena with his signature &quot;you can&#x27;t see me&quot; taunt.

At the Royal Rumble, two months before WrestleMania, SmackDown! superstar Kurt Angle relentlessly attacked Raw superstar Shawn Michaels after Michaels had eliminated him from the Royal Rumble match. The next month at No Way Out, Angle lost a number one contenders match to John Cena, losing a spot in the SmackDown! main event at WrestleMania. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Michaels told SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long to inform Angle that he had challenged him to a match at WrestleMania.&lt;ref name=&quot;PWWEW - 2/21 Raw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OWW - 2/21 Raw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the February 28 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, after Michaels defeated Edge in a Street Fight, Angle attacked Michaels and accepted his challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;PWWEW.net - 2/28 Raw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;411mania.com - 2/28 Raw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the next edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Michaels ambushed Angle in the ring, and the two of them brawled, until security broke it up. Angle claimed that he was better than Michaels, and said he would prove it by achieving everything that Michaels had, but doing it faster. He then won a ladder match, mocking Michaels&#x27; match from WrestleMania X. He then challenged Marty Jannetty, Michaels former tag team partner to a match. He won after Jannetty tapped out. Angle also persuaded Michaels&#x27; former manager, Sensational Sherri to do a spoof of Michaels&#x27; theme song, &quot;Sexy Boy&quot;, calling his version &quot;Sexy Kurt&quot;. Michaels, however, interrupted and played a video highlighting all his accomplishments. When Sherri got emotional from watching the video, Angle put her in the Ankle Lock. Angle also interfered in Michaels&#x27; match against Muhammad Hassan on the last edition of &quot;Raw&quot; before the pay-per-view, which resulted in Michaels defeating Hassan by disqualification.
The other interpromotional match on the card was between Randy Orton and The Undertaker, with Orton representing Raw and Undertaker representing SmackDown!. The feud first started on the March 7 edition of &quot;Raw&quot; when Orton challenged Undertaker to a match at WrestleMania billed as &quot;Legend vs. Legend Killer&quot; match.&lt;ref name=&quot;PWWEW.net - 3/07 Raw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OWW - 3/07 Raw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Orton had been inspired by Superstar Billy Graham, who encouraged him to &quot;go where no wrestler has gone before&quot;. Three days later on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Undertaker accepted Orton&#x27;s challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;PWWEW.net - 3/10 SmackDown!&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SLAM! Sports - 3/10 SmackDown!&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the March 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, during Chris Jericho&#x27;s &quot;Highlight Reel&quot; segment, Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts, attempted to give Orton advice about his match with Undertaker at WrestleMania, but received an RKO by Orton when Orton was not cooperating.&lt;ref name=&quot;411mania.com - 3/14 Raw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OWW - 3/14 Raw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, a contract signing for the match was scheduled to take place, and was attended by the SmackDown! General Manager, Theodore Long, and Raw General Manager, Eric Bischoff.&lt;ref name=&quot;PWWEW.net - 3/17 SmackDown!&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;411mania.com - 3/17 SmackDown!&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Undertaker immediately signed the contract; however, before Orton signed the contract, he cut a promo on the Undertaker, stating that he has nothing but respect for him and then claimed that the legend of the Undertaker will become a myth when his 12–0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania, would soon be 12–1. Afterwards, he then slapped the Undertaker. Orton fled the ring after the Undertaker began to fill the arena with smoke, and didn&#x27;t sign the contract. The next week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton claimed that his confidence was at an all-time high, despite what happened on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; the week before. Shortly thereafter, Orton turned heel and furthered his &quot;Legend Killer&quot; gimmick by performing an RKO on Stacy Keibler, who was his girlfriend at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;411mania.com - 3/21 Raw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OWW - 3/21 Raw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Orton taunted the Undertaker for the next couple weeks, but the Undertaker responded with taunts of his own, as he attacked other superstars. On the final SmackDown! before WrestleMania, Orton&#x27;s father, &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob Orton, begged the Undertaker to have mercy on Orton. It ultimately proved to be a set-up, however, as Orton attacked the Undertaker and performed an RKO on him just to show an example of what could happen at WrestleMania when he faces the Undertaker.

Another match on the card was the Money in the Bank ladder match between Chris Jericho, Christian, Chris Benoit, Edge, Kane, and Shelton Benjamin. The idea for the Money in the Bank match was introduced by Jericho who proposed a six-man ladder match, for the event in which the winner would receive a contract for a World title match at the place and time of his choosing. Raw General Manager, Eric Bischoff, booked the match at WrestleMania 21 soon after. According to Jericho, the first idea was a submission match between Edge, Jericho and Benoit and a ladder match between the other wrestlers.

==Event==
===Pre-show===
Before the event went live on pay-per-view, a dark match was held. It was exclusive on DVD releases, not on Sunday Night Heat. A 30-man interpromotional Battle Royal, which featured: Booker T, Paul London, Heidenreich, Spike Dudley, Nunzio, Funaki, Doug Basham, Danny Basham, Orlando Jordan, Mark Jindrak, Luther Reigns, Scotty 2 Hotty, Hardcore Holly, Charlie Haas, Billy Kidman, and Akio from SmackDown and Simon Dean, William Regal, Tajiri, Rob Conway, Sylvain Grenier, Snitsky, The Hurricane, Rosey, Chris Masters, Viscera, Rhyno, Val Venis, Tyson Tomko, and Maven from Raw. Booker T last eliminated Chris Masters to win the Battle Royal.

Lilian Garcia performed &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at the beginning of the event.

===Preliminary matches===
The first televised match was between Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero. At the beginning of the match, Mysterio jumped over the top rope, knocking Guerrero down. Mysterio also attempted another aerial attack but was countered by Guerrero into a Powerbomb. Guerrero performed the Three Amigos on Mysterio and attempted a Frog splash but was unsuccessful. Following a Hurricanrana on Guerrero, Mysterio pinned Guerrero to win. After the match, both men shook hands in the ring.

John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) and Orlando Jordan were then shown backstage discussing JBL&#x27;s match against John Cena. Triple H and Ric Flair walked by as Triple H mocked JBL. JBL retaliated by advising Triple H to worry about losing the World Heavyweight Championship to Batista and assured him that Cena would be unsuccessful at defeating JBL for the WWE Championship. Triple H responded that only the end of the night would reveal who would still be champion.

The match that followed was the first Money in the Bank ladder match which featured Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Shelton Benjamin, Edge, Kane, and Christian with Tyson Tomko at ringside. The match contained many notable moments, including points where Jericho, Christian, Benjamin, and Kane all jumped over the top rope to the outside of the ring to knock down multiple opponents. Another moment included Benjamin executing a T-Bone Suplex on Edge off a ladder and later using an inclined ladder as a ramp to run up and perform a Clothesline on Jericho. Benoit also executed a Diving headbutt off a ladder onto Kane. In the conclusion of the match, Benoit climbed a ladder to attempt to retrieve the Money in the Bank briefcase but was stopped by Kane, who had also climbed the ladder. Benoit used repeated headbutts to knock Kane to the floor and attempted to retrieve the briefcase once more but was knocked down by Edge, who struck him with a steel chair. Edge then climbed the ladder and successfully retrieved the briefcase to win the match.

In an interlude, Eugene came down to the ring and shared his excitement about being at his first WrestleMania with the crowd in attendance. While attempting to recall his favorite WrestleMania moments, Muhammad Hassan and Daivari interrupted him, with Hassan expressing his outrage for not being included in a match for the event. Hassan concluded that since he wasn&#x27;t scheduled to compete at the event and was therefore denied the opportunity to experience his own WrestleMania &quot;moment&quot;, he would have to create a &quot;moment&quot; of his own. Following this remark, Hassan and Daivari began to assault Eugene. With Eugene placed into a Camel clutch while Daivari verbally attacked him, Hulk Hogan came down to the ring, knocking Hassan and Daivari out of the ring. Hogan celebrated by posing in the ring for the crowd.

The third match featured The Undertaker and Randy Orton. Bob Orton Jr., Randy&#x27;s father, interfered and attacked Undertaker with his arm cast, resulting in Orton gaining control of the match. Undertaker attempted to chokeslam Orton, but Orton countered the maneuver with an RKO for a near-fall. Orton then attempted a Tombstone piledriver on Undertaker but it was reversed by Undertaker into a Tombstone of his own to win the match and continued his undefeated streak at WrestleMania with a 13–0 record.

The next match was for the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship, an encounter between Trish Stratus and Christy Hemme with Lita at ringside. Stratus controlled most of the match though Hemme attempted many pinning maneuvers that were unsuccessful. Hemme then executed a Twist of Fate on Stratus for a near-fall. After a roll-up attempt by both Stratus and Hemme, Stratus performed a Chick kick to win the match and retain the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship.

The fifth match was the encounter of Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle. The beginning of the match saw back-and-forth action between the two. Mid-way in the match, Michaels hit Angle with a low blow, after he countered a suplex from Angle. Following the low blow, which was not seen by the referee, Michaels leapfrogged from the ring and laid out Angle on a broadcast table. Angle would then gain control of the match, as he would force Michaels to submit to the Ankle Lock to win the match. After the match, Shawn Michaels was given a standing ovation from the audience.
&quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper confronted &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin in Piper&#x27;s Pit until Carlito interrupted and insulted them. Carlito received a Stone Cold Stunner from Austin and Piper threw him out of the ring. Both ended the segment celebrating with beer until Austin gave Piper a Stone Cold Stunner.

The next match was between Akebono and Big Show in a Sumo match. The match was a little over a minute and Akebono won the match after he threw Big Show out of the ring.

The next match was John Cena versus John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) for the WWE Championship. JBL controlled most of the bout. Cena won the match after ducking a Clothesline from Hell attempt and executing an FU to win the title.

===Main event===
The main event was Triple H defending his World Heavyweight Championship against Batista. Triple H entered to &quot;The Game&quot; performed live by Motörhead. The action was back and forth, with neither man in control for very long periods. While the referee was down, Triple H attacked Batista with a low blow and the title belt for a near fall. In the climax, Batista would pin Triple H after a Batista Bomb to win the match and title.

==Reception==
WrestleMania 21 received universally positive reviews from critics and fans. However, critics noted the matches for the WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship were disappointing compared to the rest of the card. John Powell of Canadian Online Explorer&#x27;s professional wrestling section noted that &quot;The changing of the guard that many people expected came with a whimper instead of a bang. In a total reversal from last year&#x27;s show – where a largely mundane card was saved by the emotional title victories of Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero – this year&#x27;s elevation of rising stars John Cena and Dave Batista had no such drama. Unable to live up to the high standards set by the Undertaker-Randy Orton and Shawn Michaels-Kurt Angle bouts, the &quot;main events&quot; offered the worst kind of anticlimax and would have been right at home buried in the middle of the card.&quot; He rated the entire event 7 out of 10 stars, which has a higher rating than the previous year&#x27;s event. The main event between Batista and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship was rated 6 out of 10 stars, the match between John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield and John Cena was rated 5 out of 10 stars, the match between Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels received the highest rating of 9 out of 10 stars, the match between The Undertaker and Randy Orton and The Money in the Bank ladder match were rated 8 out of 10 stars. Robert Leighty Jr. of &quot;411Mania&quot; gave the event an overall score of 7.0 out of 10.0 noted that &quot;If the two Title matches would have delivered this would have gone down as one of the greatest WrestleMania&#x27;s ever, but they didn&#x27;t and that left a flat ending to the show. Everything up to Shawn/Angle is fantastic and things kind of close with a whimper. Still, this is a historic show as it cemented the rise of Batista/Cena/Orton as Main Event players. It also has two great matches with Shawn/Angle and Money in the Bank. Definitely a good WrestleMania, but it could have been much more.&quot; J.D. Dunn of &quot;411Mania&quot; response towards WrestleMania 21 was also positive. He stated that &quot;this was on its way to being every bit as good as last year&#x27;s Mania&quot; but like most of the other critics who thought the main events were disappointing also said that &quot;then it hit a wall in the last 90 minutes.&quot; He later stated that &quot;If this were a regular PPV with the Michaels vs. Angle match being the main event, this would be one of the greatest PPV&#x27;s ever. Unfortunately, it drags on after that and limps to a finish.&quot; Although he praised the booking of the event saying that, &quot;they made all the right moves booking-wise, so while the matches weren&#x27;t great, they still have a certain historic value.&quot; 

The match between Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels would go on to win the 2005 Pro Wrestling Illustrated match of the year award. In 2019, WWE named it the fifth best WrestleMania match of all time. Dave Meltzer gave the match 4 and 3/4 stars out of 5. Angle himself has called it &quot;the greatest match of all time.&quot;

The Sumo match between the Big Show and Akebono was universally panned with Dave Meltzer giving it no stars, and it has frequently topped lists for worst WrestleMania matches and worst matches in overall. Reflecting on the match in 2018, Big Show said that he believed it was the &quot;most embarrassing moment in wrestling.&quot; 

For the Staples Center&#x27;s 10th anniversary in 2009, WrestleMania 21 was ranked number 7 on the list of greatest moments in the venue&#x27;s history as voted by fans.

==Aftermath==
Batista and Triple H&#x27;s feud would continue to Backlash where Batista and Triple H had a rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship. Batista won the match after a Batista Bomb. Following that, the two concluded their storyline at Vengeance where Batista scored the third and final win over his former mentor inside Hell in a Cell. Shortly thereafter, Batista was drafted to the SmackDown! brand, ending their feud and taking the title with him to his new brand, while Triple H went on hiatus. 14 years later, at WrestleMania 35, Triple H (as a face) would defeat Batista (as a heel) in a No Holds Barred match with Triple H&#x27;s career on the line, which also was&#x27;s Batista&#x27;s last match as an in ring competitor as he would retire shortly after.

John Cena and JBL continued to feud until Judgment Day, where they faced off in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match for the WWE Championship, which Cena won. Shortly after, Cena was drafted to Raw, ending their feud and taking the title with him.

Edge would hold on to his Money in the Bank briefcase until the following year at New Year&#x27;s Revolution, where he cashed in the briefcase on John Cena after Cena just competed in an Elimination Chamber match, to retain his WWE Championship.

Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle would continue their feud and face off again at Vengeance with Michaels picking up the win.

==Results==
===WWE Championship #1 Contender&#x27;s Tournament===
The tournament to determine the number one contender for the WWE Championship match at WrestleMania 21 was held between February 1 and February 20, 2005. At WrestleMania 21, John Cena defeated John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield to become the new champion. The tournament brackets were:

<doc id="599275" wikidata="Q351931" url="?curid=599275" title="Harry M. Daugherty">
<text>Harry Micajah Daugherty (; January 26, 1860 – October 12, 1941) was an American politician. A key Republican political insider from Ohio, he is best remembered for his service as Attorney General of the United States under presidents Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge, as well as for his involvement in the Teapot Dome scandal during Harding&#x27;s presidency.

Despite his status as a key political leader of the Ohio Republican Party from the 1880s to the first decade of the 20th century, Daugherty was only briefly a statewide elected politician by serving just two terms in the Ohio General Assembly, working closely during the last two years with state governor William McKinley. Although he sought national office several times, Daugherty was thwarted in his effort to obtain the nomination of his party and was never elected to office again.

Daugherty remained an influential figure behind the election of several U.S. representatives and senators. He was Harding&#x27;s campaign manager at the 1920 Republican National Convention. Following Harding&#x27;s successful election, Daugherty was named attorney general. In that capacity, he was instrumental in winning presidential pardons for jailed anti-war dissidents such as Eugene V. Debs. Twice the subject of federal corruption investigations, Daugherty was forced in 1924 to resign his post as attorney general by Coolidge.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Harry M. Daugherty was born on January 26, 1860, in the small town of Washington Court House, Ohio. Daugherty&#x27;s father, John H. Daugherty, was the Pennsylvania-born son of Irish immigrants and worked as a farmer and tailor. His mother, Jane Draper Daugherty, was from a prominent Ohio family with Virginia roots dating back to the time of the American Revolution. Daugherty was a first cousin of actress Majel Coleman.

Daugherty&#x27;s father died of diphtheria when Harry was just four years old, as did one of his brothers, leaving his mother as the sole provider for the household. Harry and his older brother, Mally, were forced by economic necessity to take a variety of jobs from a relatively early age to help with the family&#x27;s living expenses. Daugherty&#x27;s mother later recalled that he was so young when he worked in a local grocery store that he had to stand on a wooden crate to reach the cash register.

Daugherty&#x27;s mother wanted him to become a Methodist minister, but the prospect of life as a clergyman held no appeal for him. Instead, after graduating from high school in Washington Court House, Daugherty studied medicine for a year before taking a position as a cub reporter for &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer.&quot;

In 1878 Daugherty entered the University of Michigan Law School, accepted there despite not having first obtained an undergraduate education. He supplemented his insufficient income by gambling, winning a significant sum betting on the election of James Garfield in the 1880 presidential election. Sports betting was also an area of some interest to Daugherty and his brother, who went so far as to tap telegraph wires so that they could obtain game information in advance. Initially successful, this ethically shady activity was ultimately discovered and exposed by local gamblers puzzled by the brothers&#x27; uncanny success.

Daugherty graduated from law school in 1881 and returned home to Ohio, where he accepted a job in the office of a Washington Court House attorney, spending his spare time preparing to take the Ohio state bar examination.

===Factional soldier===

In 1882 Daugherty was elected by the Fayette County Republican Central Committee as the recording secretary of the organization. He ran for political office in the election of 1882, winning election as the clerk of nearby Union Township. In this capacity Daugherty served a single two-year term, earning a salary of $1500 per year.

The following year Daugherty was elected secretary of the Fayette County Executive Committee, where he earned a reputation as an intense and astute young political activist. He was selected as one of five delegates from the Fayette Country Republican Party as a delegate to the Ohio State Republican Convention in 1883, held in Columbus. There Daugherty helped select an aggressive young Cincinnati judge named Joseph B. Foraker as the party&#x27;s 1883 gubernatorial nominee.

A close political relationship developed between Foraker and Daugherty, with Daugherty exerting himself in support of Foraker&#x27;s unsuccessful 1883 campaign. When Foraker was elected as Governor of Ohio in 1885, he was able to return the favor, boosting his protégé Daugherty&#x27;s career. The connection between the two was tightened further in September 1884, when Daugherty married Lucille Walker of Wellston, Ohio – a cousin of Foraker&#x27;s wife.

Daugherty was elected to a two-year term on the city council in the election of 1885, serving from 1886 to 1887. He was elected as chairman of the Fayette County Republican Central Committee in 1886 but spent most of his time helping to establish a law practice. After practicing alone for three years, Daugherty formed a partnership with Horatio B. Maynard, a prominent local lawyer, and the new practice soon emerged as a leading law firm in the county.

In 1889 Republican David Worthington decided not to seek reelection to the Ohio General Assembly and Daugherty threw his hat into the ring. After eking out a narrow victory in the Republican primary election, Daugherty emerged victorious in November, winning election to the Ohio House of Representatives by slightly more than 800 votes out of 5,100 ballots cast. Although Daugherty won his race, his close political ally Joseph Foraker lost his bid for a third term as Governor and the Democratic Party won control of the Assembly as well, forcing Daugherty to participate as a member of the minority party.

Daugherty won reelection to the Ohio House of Representatives in the fall of 1891, beating his Democratic opponent by more than 750 votes out of about 4,900 cast. This time Ohio Republicans recaptured not only the Governor&#x27;s mansion – electing William McKinley to the state&#x27;s chief executive office – but also the majority of the state assembly. Since in this era United States Senators were elected by state legislatures rather than by direct vote of the people, this meant that a Republican would be sent to Washington, DC to fill the expiring term of Senator John Sherman when the assembly reconvened in January 1892.

===Change of alliances===

The Ohio Republican Party had for several years been deeply split along factional lines, with Senator Sherman and former Governor Foraker leading rival groups of party activists and political functionaries. Foraker was determined to challenge Sherman for his Senate seat and sought assurances from Daugherty that he would continue to support him when the matter came before the legislature.

This placed Daugherty in a difficult position, since his native Fayette County was solidly behind the Sherman faction, which included Governor McKinley and the significant financial clout of Cleveland businessman Mark Hanna. Forced by the logic of the situation to switch alliances rather than risk being cast into political oblivion, Daugherty abandoned Foraker in the final contest of the Ohio Republican caucus on January 2, 1892, joining 52 others in voting for Sherman, against 38 for the insurgent campaign of Foraker.

In the aftermath of the caucus that would determine Ohio&#x27;s U.S. Senator, editorials of the Democratic &quot;Columbus Post&quot; charged that Daugherty and fourteen other Ohio legislators had changed their support from Foraker to Sherman based upon &quot;intimidation, threats, promises, and actual purchase&quot; and accused Daugherty by name of having accepted cash payments. A formal investigation of this charge by a bi-partisan four member committee of the Ohio State Senate followed, with Daugherty being unanimously cleared of all charges in a report issued in April 1892.

The 1892 Senatorial campaign marked the formal attachment of Daugherty to the dominant Sherman-Hanna faction of the Ohio Republican Party after the better part of a decade as a trusted adherent of the rival Foraker faction. The move broadened Daugherty&#x27;s political possibilities, and he was made chairman of the powerful Corporations Committee and named a member of the Judiciary Committee. In 1893 Daugherty was chosen as chairman of the Ohio Republican State Convention which nominated McKinley as the party&#x27;s candidate for Governor.

Governor McKinley also named Daugherty as his floor leader in the House of Representatives, keeping party members in line behind the governor&#x27;s legislative agenda. Over the next two years McKinley and Daugherty forged a close political friendship, working together closely and frequently sharing meals at breakfast and in the evening. With the Foraker faction, however, Daugherty became &quot;persona non grata&quot; due to what was perceived as his duplicitous political disloyalty.

Daugherty attempted to gain nomination as a Republican candidate for Congress in 1892, but the 7th District Republican Convention which put forward the party&#x27;s nominee was irreconcilably split between Daugherty and his former law partner, A.R. Creamer, and wound up backing a dark horse candidate as a compromise, George W. Wilson. Wilson won his race in the November 1892 general election and wound up serving four years in Congress on behalf of the 7th District.

In the aftermath of his failure to win a seat in Congress, Sherman offered Daugherty a political appointment as Assistant District Attorney in Columbus. Daugherty ultimately decided to decline this position, instead opening a new law office in that city, while still remaining a resident and practicing attorney in his hometown of Washington Court House.

===The Washington Court House riot=== 

On October 9, 1894, a black man named William Dolby was accused of assaulting a white woman named Mary C. Boyd in her home at Parrett&#x27;s Station, a small settlement near Washington Court House. Dolby fled but was soon arrested and taken back to the jail at Washington Court House, where signs quickly pointed to an outburst of mob violence. Dolby supposedly confessed to the crime &quot;upon being apprehended&quot;. The Fayette County sheriff called upon Governor McKinley to send out the militia to defend the prisoner from a prospective lynch mob following his sentencing to twenty years in prison at a hearing held on October 16.

On October 17 two companies of militiamen arrived at Washington Court House to guard Dolby for his coming transport to the Ohio Penitentiary at Columbus. That evening a mob gathered and began a siege of the jail, attempting to batter down the jailhouse doors so that the prisoner could be removed and violently killed. Commander of the National Guard forces, Colonel Alonzo Coit, ordered his troops to fire upon the enraged lynch mob, which they did, killing five rioters and wounding fifteen others. The mob still failed to disperse and fears grew that an armed assault would be launched by furious local citizens on the militiamen defending the jail. Around 2 am a second volley was fired by the defenders, this time over the heads of the rioters, with the gunfire finally having its desired effect of breaking up the unlawful gathering.

In the aftermath, Governor McKinley appointed a special court of inquiry to investigate the riot and militia shooting. Following an investigation, the court of inquiry returned an indictment against Col. Coit, charging him with manslaughter in the incident. McKinley then called upon Daugherty to shoulder the politically unpopular job of defending Coit at trial, in the face of a wrathful Fayette County citizenry which sought his conviction. Daugherty accepted the Coit case, and on March 5, 1895, won his acquittal of manslaughter charges.

===From politician to political operator===

Although Daugherty sought nomination by the Ohio Republican Party for Governor in 1895, Hanna decided to support another candidate instead, so Daugherty decided to launch a run for Ohio Attorney General instead. The Ohio Republican Convention was dominated by the Foraker faction, however, and Foraker loyalist Frank S. Monnett was nominated for the Attorney General post over the deeply distrusted Daugherty.

Not daunted by his loss, in 1896 Daugherty announced his desire to win election to Congress. An advisory primary election was held among Fayette County Republicans in March 1896, in which Daugherty narrowly won a bitterly fought race. The actual nomination was to be made by the 7th District Republican Convention, however, and there Daugherty fell victim to factional machinations, with the nomination going instead to Walter L. Weaver, who would ultimately serve two terms in Congress. For a second time Daugherty had been denied.

The Republican National Committee recognized Daugherty&#x27;s gifts as an indefatigable partisan and effective stump speaker, however, and sent him out on the road in support of McKinley&#x27;s campaign for President of the United States in 1896. Daugherty traveled through Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Ohio, logging over 9,000 miles traveled in delivering some 47 campaign speeches in support of McKinley and the Republicans&#x27; successful effort.

In 1898 conflict emerged between Daugherty and Hanna over the slow payment of thousands of dollars of legal fees incurred by then-U.S. Senator Hanna in defending himself against a Senate investigation of electoral bribery charges. While Daugherty&#x27;s insistence upon being paid had made for a tense relationship, the actual parting of their ways came in 1899, when Daugherty again sought the Republican nomination for Governor of Ohio. Neither Foraker nor Hanna supported Daugherty for the position, with Hanna lending his support to George K. Nash and Foraker clearly still seething over Daugherty&#x27;s 1892 abandonment. Daugherty took his fight all the way to the Ohio Republican Convention before losing to Nash, 461 delegate votes to 205.

Over the next five years Daugherty skillfully built political influence in the Ohio Republican establishment by dealing with leaders of both of the party&#x27;s major factions. Daugherty maintained considerable influence with Republicans in the state legislature, who had known and worked with Daugherty for years. His political rehabilitation was only partial, however, for as long as Foraker and Hanna remained the top factional leaders of Ohio Republican politics there remained a very real ceiling beyond which Daugherty could never hope to rise.

Hanna&#x27;s death in February 1904 and a subsequent discrediting of some of his top allies such as George B. Cox on grounds of political bossism again cleared the way for Daugherty&#x27;s emergence. By 1906 Daugherty stood as a leader of a new insurgent political faction which included Congressman Theodore E. Burton of Cleveland and former Governor Myron T. Herrick. Daugherty and Burton aligned themselves with supporters of William Howard Taft, Secretary of War under progressive Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, and together the factional allies forced Foraker out of the United States Senate and into political retirement, aided by muckraking news reports that Foraker had received nearly $30,000 as a political retainer from the Standard Oil Trust.

Daugherty was instrumental in helping his ally Burton win election to the Senate in 1908 but was once again relegated to a key backstage role instead of himself standing for election to high office. Daugherty&#x27;s position as a political boss rather than a public politician had once again been confirmed.

During the party split of 1912, Daugherty was a staunch supporter of Taft and old guard Republican conservatism against the progressive Republicanism espoused by Roosevelt. Daugherty was a key figure on the ground in Ohio in behalf of the Taft campaign, issuing a major address on May 18 which was so well regarded that it was reproduced as a pamphlet by the Taft organization. Although Daugherty&#x27;s machinations along with Cuyahoga County boss Maurice Maschke carried the state Republican convention for Taft, a split of the Republican field in the November election propelled Democrat Woodrow Wilson to the presidency with a plurality of under 42% of the vote.

===The Harding campaign===

The establishment of primary elections for the U.S. Senate in 1914 greatly reduced the power of political bosses such as Daugherty. He remained fully engaged as a political operative in spite of this major change, however, attaching himself to a powerful state senator named Warren G. Harding. Daugherty had known Harding since the autumn of 1899, when he had been prominent in Ohio politics and Harding was a 35-year-old upstart. It would not be too many years before these roles were reversed, however, with Harding elected to the state senate in 1901 and appointed Republican floor leader in that same session. Harding was an eloquent speaker and a skilled negotiator of political compromise and emerged as one of the top leaders of the Foraker faction.

During the 1912 party split, Daugherty and Harding forged a political friendship working on behalf of the Taft campaign, with Daugherty filling the role of Ohio Republican Party chairman with Harding&#x27;s newspaper, the Marion &quot;Daily Star&quot;, giving Daugherty its full support. Both were politically ambitious and while they enjoyed one another&#x27;s company, they were not intimate personal friends. Harding managed to win election to the Senate in 1914. Daugherty ran for the Republican Senate nomination in 1916, campaigning against former Senator Charles W.F. Dick and former Governor Herrick. Herrick won the nomination, and lost the general election to Atlee Pomerene.

Ever the political manipulator, in January 1918 Daugherty observed the significance of the growing temperance movement and opportunistically attempted to become a movement leader in the state. Daugherty was himself a drinker but was not a man to let personal habits stand in the way of political possibility.

As an Ohio Republican boss in 1920, Daugherty engineered Harding&#x27;s ascendancy as the presidential nominee at that year&#x27;s Republican National Convention in Chicago. The decision to propel Harding forward, if the nomination wasn&#x27;t decided on the first ballot, was made in what became known in American politics as the smoke-filled room in the Blackstone Hotel. Harding won the nomination after the vote deadlocked between Leonard Wood and Frank Lowden, an event whose possibility Daugherty had suggested months before in an interview. Daugherty subsequently served as campaign manager for Harding in the presidential election of 1920. He ran the campaign based on Harding&#x27;s affable personality and fairly neutral political stance, advocating a return to &quot;normalcy&quot; after World War I.

===Attorney General of the United States===
Following the resounding Republican victory in the fall of 1920, Daugherty was named Attorney General of the United States by President-elect Harding. Daugherty was confirmed by the Senate and assumed office on March 4, 1921.

===The &quot;Ohio Gang&quot;===
Having achieved power, Harding gathered around him a group of political cronies, including factional friends from the Ohio Republican establishment like Daugherty and others of like mind from other states, a group known colloquially as the &quot;Ohio Gang.&quot; Critics such as Harding&#x27;s Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover viewed the clique with thinly disguised disgust:[Harding] had another side which was not good. His political associates had been men of the type of Albert B. Fall, whom he appointed Secretary of the Interior; Daugherty, whom he appointed Attorney General; Forbes, whom he appointed Director of the Veterans&#x27; Bureau; Thomas W. Miller, whom he appointed Alien Property Custodian, and Jesse Smith who had office room in the Department of Justice.
He enjoyed the company of these men and his old Ohio associates in and out of the government. Weekly White House poker parties were his greatest relaxation. The stakes were not large, but the play lasted most of the night... I had lived too long on the frontiers of the world to have strong emotions against people playing poker for money if they liked it, but it irked me to see it in the White House.

Several of Harding&#x27;s Ohio Gang associates lost no time enriching themselves at the public expense. Soon rumblings began to be heard over possible malfeasance in various government departments, including Daugherty&#x27;s Department of Justice. Then on April 14, 1922, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; broke a sensational story about a secret bribery scheme involving oil company kickbacks to government officials in exchange for the granting of extraordinarily favorable oil extraction leases via single-bid contracts. The next day Democratic Senator John B. Kendrick of Wyoming introduced a resolution which set in motion the Senate investigation that would ultimately expose this so-called Teapot Dome scandal, involving an illegal financial relationship between Fall, Harding&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior, and a subsidiary of the Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation.

In May 1922, Arkansas Senator Thaddeus H. Caraway called for Daugherty&#x27;s resignation because of the role Daugherty had played ten years earlier in procuring a presidential pardon for Charles W. Morse. Morse, a multi-millionaire who had just begun a fifteen-year prison sentence, pretended to be dying in order to plead for a pardon on humanitarian grounds from President William Howard Taft. Daugherty, hired because of his closeness to Taft, and promised a fee of $100,000 if a pardon were obtained, advanced the scheme by repeatedly telling Taft&#x27;s secretary that Morse was near death, even stating at one point that Morse would not likely survive another 24 hours. In fact, after receiving the pardon, Morse lived another 21 years.

Daugherty was also accused by opponents of the administration of having been complicit in the Teapot Dome affair by failing to intervene after he had learned of the malfeasance. A pair of special prosecutors – Republican Assistant Attorney General Owen J. Roberts and former Democratic Senator Atlee Pomerene – were appointed to conduct a more thorough investigation of the matter.

After taking testimony on the matter the pair cleared Daugherty of wrongdoing, their final report indicating that the Attorney General had neither been aware of the fraudulent oil contracts nor had he taken any bribes related to the affair. This very specific absolution did not mean that all was on the level at the Justice Department, however. In July 1923, just as Harding was preparing to leave on a working cruise to Alaska, Daugherty&#x27;s personal assistant, Jess Smith, suddenly committed suicide. Although as a pious Quaker, Hoover was never part of the President&#x27;s inner circle, yet was abruptly added to the traveling party on the cruise by a &quot;nervous and distraught&quot; Harding, who apparently sought his counsel.

Hoover later recalled:

One day after lunch when we were a few days out, Harding asked me to come to his cabin. He plumped at me the question: &quot;If you knew of a great scandal in our administration, would you for the good of the country and the party expose it publicly or would you bury it?&quot; My natural reply was &quot;Publish it, and at least get credit for integrity on your side.&quot; He remarked that this method might be politically dangerous. I asked for more particulars. He said that he had received some rumors of irregularities, centering around Smith, in connection with cases in the Department of Justice. He had followed the matter up and finally sent for Smith. After a painful session he told Smith that he would be arrested in the morning. Smith went home, burned all his papers, and committed suicide. Harding gave me no information about what Smith had been up to. I asked what Daugherty&#x27;s relations to the affair were. He abruptly dried up and never raised the question again.

Returning from his Alaskan trip Harding suffered the first heart attack in what would prove to be the beginning of his terminal last days, finally dying in San Francisco on August 2, 1923. Harding&#x27;s death did nothing to quell the tide of emerging scandals revolving around his Ohio clique, with the news dominated by the story of Teapot Dome bribery and allegations of wrongdoing in the Office of the Alien Property Custodian, the Veterans&#x27; Bureau, and the Office of the Attorney General. While new President Calvin Coolidge initially resisted calls to sack Daugherty, Hoover and Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes prevailed upon him to eliminate a man whom they considered to be a corrupt official. In his memoirs Hoover remembered:

Coolidge was loath to believe that such things were possible. He greatly delayed the removal of Daugherty from the Cabinet. From this man&#x27;s long-time character, he should never have been in any government... Coolidge had a high sense of justice and asserted that he had no definite knowledge of wrongdoings by Daugherty and could not remove him on rumors. We urged that Daugherty had lost the confidence of the whole country and himself should be willing to retire for the good of public service.

On March 28, 1924, Coolidge acquiesced, demanding and receiving a letter of resignation from Daugherty. He was quickly replaced as Attorney General by Harlan Fiske Stone, dean of the Columbia Law School.

===American Metal Company affair===
In 1926, Daugherty was indicted on charges that he improperly received funds in the sale of American Metal Company assets seized during World War I. The indictment came down one year after Smith, Republican political boss John T. King of Connecticut, and former Alien Property Custodian Thomas W. Miller were charged with the same misconduct. Daugherty&#x27;s case went to trial twice, with the first jury deadlocking with 7–5 in favor of conviction. He was acquitted after a single juror remained unconvinced of his guilt in the second trial.

===Midland Bank controversy===
Daugherty and others in the Harding Administration were implicated by Thomas W. Miller for pressuring him to deposit funds in the Midland National Bank, which Daugherty&#x27;s brother Mally &quot;Mal&quot; S. Daugherty served as president of, when Daughterty refused to investigate the Teapot Dome Scandal. On January 17, 1927, in the &quot;McGrain v. Daugherty&quot; ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a contempt conviction against Mally Daughterty which was related to a contempt citation which was issued against him in 1924. for his refusal to cooperate with a U.S. Senate committee investigating his brother&#x27;s failures to prosecute the perpetrators in the Teapot Dome Scandal. However, the Supreme Court decision to uphold Mail&#x27;s contempt conviction would also result in the Midland Bank case against Daugherty passing into history. Mal would later be convicted on March 5, 1931 of a more serious charge of bank fraud related to his Ohio Bank assets, for which he would received a sentence of 10 years in prison.

===Later years, death, and legacy===
Daugherty returned to practicing law until his retirement in 1932, and that year published, with ghostwriter Thomas Dixon, &quot;The Inside Story of the Harding Tragedy&quot; about his time in the Harding administration. In the book he claimed that Fall had become Secretary of the Interior by forging Daugherty&#x27;s signature, and that Smith, his close friend, had killed himself because of diabetes, not a guilty conscience.

Spending many of his final years in Florida and Mackinac Island, Michigan, Daugherty planned to write more books to clear his reputation, but in October 1940, he suffered two heart attacks and was stricken with pneumonia. Bedridden and blind in one eye during this last year, he died peacefully in his sleep with his son and daughter at his side on October 12, 1941.

Daugherty was buried at Washington Cemetery in Washington Court House, Ohio. Some of his papers, consisting primarily of correspondence between him and President Warren Harding, are housed at the Ohio Historical Society in Columbus.

==Popular culture==
Daugherty is portrayed by Christopher McDonald on the HBO series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;. Like the real life Daugherty, the character is portrayed as Warren G. Harding&#x27;s 1920 campaign manager and later as his Attorney General. He also faces corruption charges and his relationship with Jess Smith and Gaston Means is also shown. Daugherty is also portrayed by Barry Sullivan in the 1979 NBC mini-series &quot;Backstairs at the White House&quot;.

<text>In cryptography, WAKE is a stream cipher designed by David Wheeler in 1993.

WAKE stands for Word Auto Key Encryption. The cipher works in &quot;cipher feedback&quot; mode, generating keystream blocks from previous ciphertext blocks. WAKE uses an S-box with 256 entries of 32-bit words.

The cipher is fast, but vulnerable to chosen plaintext and chosen ciphertext attacks.

== Characteristics and vulnerability ==
WAKE is noted for its speed, making it suitable for applications requiring fast encryption. However, it has been found to be vulnerable to both chosen plaintext and chosen ciphertext attacks. These vulnerabilities arise from the cipher&#x27;s reliance on previous ciphertext blocks for keystream generation, which can be exploited in certain attack scenarios.

Research has indicated that WAKE&#x27;s design allows for effective chosen plaintext attacks, where an attacker can choose arbitrary plaintexts to be encrypted and analyze the resulting ciphertexts to gain insights into the key or the encryption process. Similarly, chosen ciphertext attacks can also be executed, where an attacker can manipulate ciphertexts and observe the corresponding plaintext outputs.

== Recent developments ==
While WAKE has been overshadowed by more modern stream ciphers, its study remains relevant in cryptographic research. Ongoing analyses focus on its security properties and potential improvements to mitigate identified vulnerabilities. For instance, some studies have proposed modifications to the S-box structure or alternative feedback mechanisms to enhance resistance against chosen plaintext and ciphertext attacks.

<text>Ye Jianying (; 28 April 1897 – 22 October 1986) was a Chinese Communist revolutionary leader and politician, one of the Ten Marshals of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He was the top military leader in the 1976 coup that overthrew the Gang of Four and ended the Cultural Revolution, and was the key supporter of Deng Xiaoping in his power struggle with Hua Guofeng between 1978 and 1981, which ended in Hua fading into political obscurity. In his capacity as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, Ye served as China&#x27;s head of state from 1978 until 1983.

== Life ==
Born Ye Yiwei () into a wealthy Christian Hakka merchant family in an old rural village at Jiaying county, renamed as the Meixian District, Meizhou, Guangdong, in the modern day. His courtesy name was Cangbai () and most of Ye Jianying&#x27;s siblings died before being adults due to severe illness.

After graduation from the Yunnan Military Academy in 1919, he joined the Kuomintang (KMT). He taught at the Whampoa Military Academy, and in 1927 joined the Communist Party.

That year, he participated in the failed Nanchang Uprising and was forced to flee to Hong Kong with two other uprising leaders, Zhou Enlai and Ye Ting (no relation), with only a pair of handguns to share between them. Shortly after, he faithfully carried out his assigned duties during the Guangzhou Uprising, although he had been opposed to it; upon this uprising&#x27;s failure he was once again obliged to flee to Hong Kong with Ye Ting and Nie Rongzhen. However, Ye was far more fortunate than Ye Ting, who was made a scapegoat for the Comintern&#x27;s failures and forced into exile. Ye was not blamed, and subsequently studied military science in Moscow.

After returning to China in 1932 he joined the Jiangxi Soviet, serving as Chief of Staff of Zhang Guotao&#x27;s Fourth Front Army. However, after Zhang&#x27;s fighters met up with Mao Zedong&#x27;s force during the Long March, the two leaders disagreed on the subsequent movement of the Chinese Red Army. Zhang insisted on turning southward to establish a new base in the regions inhabited by Tibetan and Qiang minorities. (This later proved to be a disaster, as Mao had anticipated, with Zhang losing over 75% of his men and retreating to the Communist base at Yan&#x27;an.) During the two leaders&#x27; disagreement, Ye – though he was Zhang&#x27;s Chief of Staff – sided with Mao; and instead of supporting Zhang unconditionally as he had during the Guangzhou Uprising, Ye absconded to Mao&#x27;s headquarters with Zhang&#x27;s code books and maps. As a result, Zhang&#x27;s communications with Comintern were cut, while Mao was able to establish a radio link, leading to Comintern&#x27;s acceptance of Mao&#x27;s leadership. Mao would never forget Ye&#x27;s contribution, observing later that &quot;Ye Jianying saved the (Chinese Communist) Party, the (Chinese) Red Army, and the (Chinese) Revolution&quot;.

After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Ye was placed in charge of Guangdong, which was to cost him his political career under Mao&#x27;s reign. Ye understood that the economic conditions in the province were very different from those in the rest of China, since most Cantonese landlords were peasants themselves who participated in production without exploiting their tenants. He therefore declined to dispossess the landlords, and instead protected their businesses and land. However, Ye&#x27;s policies contradicted the general directives of the Party-mandated land reform, which emphasized class struggle. His policies deemed too soft, Ye and his local cadres were soon replaced by Lin Biao&#x27;s, and a much harsher policy was implemented and hundreds of thousands of Cantonese landlords were executed, with Ye&#x27;s political career effectively over.

However, Mao did not forget what Ye had done for him during the Long March, and thus removed him only from political posts while preserving his military positions. As a result, until 1968, Ye remained active in various military functions, having been made a marshal in 1955. Ye was clever in using his military influence to provide limited support and he was responsible for interfering with assassination attempts on reformers.

Lin Biao died in an aircraft crash in 1971 (the Lin Biao incident). During the subsequent Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign, many generals who had been supported by Lin were removed and military programs Lin had implemented were canceled. In 1973, the PLA completed a thorough re-organization. Thereafter, Ye handled the PLA&#x27;s operations in consultation with Zhou Enlai. In 1975, Ye was appointed Defense Minister, filling Lin Biao&#x27;s former post. From 1973, he was also a Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

Ye led the group of generals and Party elders that overthrew Jiang Qing and the Gang of Four; during initial planning at his residence, he and Li Xiannian communicated by writing, although they sat next to each other, because of the possibility of bugging. On 6 October 1976, Ye ordered the arrest of the Gang of Four and Mao Yuanxin.

Thanks to Ye&#x27;s support of Chairman Hua Guofeng, he was confirmed as party vice-chairman at the Eleventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 1977. Because the physical demands of Defense Minister were too great for the octogenarian Ye, he resigned from that position in 1978 and was appointed Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, filling a post left unoccupied since Zhu De&#x27;s death in 1976. As such, Ye was China&#x27;s ceremonial Head of State. 

Consistent with Deng&#x27;s one country, two systems approach, Ye elaborated on peaceful reunification with Taiwan through his 30 September 1981 &quot;Nine Points Proposal&quot; in which Taiwan would have a high degree of autonomy following reunification. The Nine Points Proposal also talked of trade, transportation, and postal services as &quot;three links&quot; across the strait and &quot;four exchanges&quot; in the areas of culture, academics, economics, and sports.

Ye retired from the Chair of the NPC Standing Committee in 1983 and in 1985 he withdrew completely from the Politburo Standing Committee. He died a little over a year later at the age of 89 on October 22, 1986.

== Family ==
Ye married six times and had six children. His sons include Ye Xuanping (1924–2019), Ye Xuanning (1938–2016), and Ye Xuanlian (, born 1952). Ye&#x27;s granddaughter Robynn Yip (born 1986), daughter of Xuanlian, is a professional musician based in Hong Kong.

== Awards ==
: Order of Victory of Resistance against Aggression (1946)
: Order of August 1 (1st Class Medal) (1955)
: Order of Independence and Freedom (1st Class Medal) (1955)
: Order of Liberation (1st Class Medal) (1955)

<text>Vitriol is the general chemical name encompassing a class of chemical compounds comprising sulfates of certain metalsoriginally, iron or copper. Those mineral substances were distinguished by their color, such as green vitriol for hydrated iron(II) sulfate and blue vitriol for hydrated copper(II) sulfate.

These materials were found originally as crystals formed by evaporation of groundwater that percolated through sulfide minerals and collected in pools on the floors of old mines. The word &quot;vitriol&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;vitriolus&quot;, meaning &quot;small glass&quot;, as those crystals resembled small pieces of colored glass.

Oil of vitriol was an old name for concentrated sulfuric acid, which was historically obtained through the dry distillation (pyrolysis) of vitriols. The name, abbreviated to vitriol, continued to be used for this viscous liquid long after the minerals came to be termed &quot;sulfates&quot;. The figurative term &quot;vitriolic&quot; in the sense of &quot;harshly condemnatory&quot; is derived from the corrosive nature of this substance.
 

==History==
The study of vitriol began during ancient times. Sumerians had a list of types of vitriol that they classified according to the substances&#x27; color. Some of the earliest discussions of the origin and properties of vitriol is in the works of the Greek physician Dioscorides (first century AD) and the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD). Galen also discussed its medical use. Metallurgical uses for vitriolic substances were recorded in the Hellenistic alchemical works of Zosimos of Panopolis, in the treatise &quot;Phisica et Mystica&quot;, and the Leyden papyrus X.

Medieval Islamic chemists like Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (died c. 806–816 AD, known in Latin as Geber), Abū Bakr al-Rāzī (865–925 AD, known in Latin as Rhazes), Ibn Sina (980–1037 AD, known in Latin as Avicenna), and Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm al-Watwat (1234–1318 AD) included vitriol in their mineral classification lists.

Sulfuric acid was termed &quot;oil of vitriol&quot; by medieval European alchemists because it was prepared by roasting &quot;green vitriol&quot; (iron(II) sulfate) in an iron retort. The first vague allusions to it appear in the works of Vincent of Beauvais, in the &quot;Compositum de Compositis&quot; ascribed to Saint Albertus Magnus, and in pseudo-Geber&#x27;s &quot;Summa perfectionis&quot; (all thirteenth century AD).

<doc id="599306" wikidata="Q3445479" url="?curid=599306" title="ABA routing transit number">
<text>In the United States, an ABA routing transit number (ABA RTN) is a nine-digit code printed on the bottom of checks to identify the financial institution on which it was drawn. The American Bankers Association (ABA) developed the system in 1910 to facilitate the sorting, bundling, and delivering of paper checks to the drawer&#x27;s (check writer&#x27;s) bank for debit to the drawer&#x27;s account.

Newer electronic payment methods continue to rely on ABA RTNs to identify the paying bank or other financial institution. The Federal Reserve Bank uses ABA RTNs in processing Fedwire funds transfers. The ACH Network also uses ABA RTNs in processing direct deposits, bill payments, and other automated money transfers.

==Management==
Since 1911, the American Bankers Association has partnered with a series of registrars, currently Accuity, to manage the ABA routing number system. Accuity is the Official Routing Number Registrar and is responsible for assigning ABA RTNs and managing the ABA RTN system. Accuity publishes the &quot;American Bankers Association Key to Routing Numbers&quot; semi-annually. The &quot;Key Book&quot; contains the listing of all ABA RTNs that have been assigned.

There are approximately 26,895 active ABA RTNs currently in use. Every financial institution in the United States has at least one. The Routing Number Policy allows for up to five ABA RTNs to be assigned to a financial institution. Many institutions have more than five ABA RTNs as a result of mergers.

ABA RTNs are only for use in payment transactions within the United States. They are used on paper check, wire transfers, and ACH transactions. On a paper check, the ABA RTN is usually the middle set of nine numbers printed at the bottom of the check. Domestic transfers that use the ABA RTN will usually be returned to the paying bank.

Incoming international wire transfers also use a BIC code, also known as a SWIFT code, as they are administered by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and defined by ISO 9362. In addition, many international financial institutions use an IBAN code.

The IBAN was originally developed to facilitate payments within the European Union but the format is flexible enough to be applied globally. It consists of an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, followed by two check digits that are calculated using a mod-97 technique, and Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) with up to thirty alphanumeric characters. The BBAN includes the domestic bank account number and potentially routing information. The national banking communities decide individually on a fixed length for all BBAN in their country.

== History ==
The bank numbers in the United States were originated by the American Bankers Association (ABA) in 1911. Banks had been disagreeing on identification. The ABA arranged a meeting of clearing house managers in Chicago in December 1910. The gathering chose a committee to assign each bank in the country convenient numbers to use. In May 1911, the American Bankers Association released the codes. The numerical committee was W. G. Schroeder, C. R. McKay, and J. A. Walker. The publisher of the new directory was Rand-McNally and Company. The ABA clearing house codes are like the sub-headings in a decimal outline. The prefixes mean locations and the suffixes banking firms within those locations. Half of the prefixes represent major cities the other half represent regions of the United States. Lower prefixes are used for higher populations, first based on the 1910 U. S. Census. Likewise, within each prefix area banks are numbered in order of city population and bank seniority, although single-bank towns are numbered in alphabetical order. When a new bank is being organized, the current publisher of the directory of banks assigns it a transit code. The American Bankers Association asked banks to use the directory exclusively so banks would agree on how to sort checks. The book was abbreviated &quot;Key to Numerical System of The American Bankers Association,&quot; and as the &quot;Key&quot;. It was published by Rand McNally &amp; Co. In 1952 Rand McNally moved its corporate headquarters to Skokie, Illinois, and became more interested in publishing maps. Also in Skokie is a company called Accuity, which from its history has been the official registrar of ABA bank numbers since 1911. By 2014 it was the publisher of the semi-annual &quot;ABA Key to Routing Numbers&quot; and was owned by Reed Business Information, British publisher of reference works for professionals, which in turn is owned by Reed-Elsevier, English-Dutch publisher of online format reference works for professionals. Over the years the ABA&#x27;s identification numbers for banks accommodated the Federal Reserve Act, the Expedited Funds Act and the Check 21 Act. By 2014 the &quot;Key&quot; included the U. S. Federal Reserve&#x27;s nine-digit magnetic-ink routing numbers.

==Formats==

The ABA RTN appears in two forms on a standard check – the fraction form and the MICR (magnetic ink character recognition) form. Both forms give essentially the same information, though there are slight differences.

The MICR forms are the main form – it is printed in magnetic ink, and is machine-readable; it appears at the bottom left of a check, and consists of nine digits.

The fraction form was used for manual processing before the invention of the MICR line, and still serves as a backup in check processing should the MICR line become illegible or torn; it generally appears in the upper right part of a check near the date.

The MICR number is of the form
: XXXXYYYYC
where XXXX is Federal Reserve Routing Symbol, YYYY is ABA Institution Identifier,
and C is the Check Digit, while the fraction is of the form:
: PP-YYYY/XXXX
where PP is a 1 or 2 digit Prefix, no longer used in processing, but still printed, representing the bank&#x27;s check processing center location, with 1 through 49 for processing centers located in a major city, and 50 through 99 representing processing is done at a non-major city in a particular state. Sometimes a branch number or the account number are printed below the fraction form; branch number is not used in processing, while the account number is listed in MICR form at the bottom. Further, the Federal Reserve Routing Symbol and ABA Institution Identifier may have fewer than 4 digits in the fraction form. The essential data, shared by both forms, is the Federal Reserve Routing Symbol (XXXX), and the ABA Institution Identifier (YYYY), and these are usually the same in both the fraction form and the MICR, with only the order and format switched (and left-padded with 0s to ensure that they are 4 digits long).

The prefix and the Federal Reserve Routing Symbol (XXXX) are determined by the bank&#x27;s geographical location and treatment by the Federal Reserve type, while the remaining data (YYYY, and Branch number, if present) depends on the specific bank, and are unique within a Federal Reserve district.

In the check depicted above right, the fraction form is &quot;11-3167/1210&quot; (with &quot;01&quot; below it) and MICR form is &quot;129131673&quot; which are analyzed as follows:
* the &quot;prefix&quot; 11 corresponds to San Francisco,
* 3167 (common to both) is the ABA Institution Identifier,
* 1210 and 1291 are the Federal Reserve Routing Symbols (generally equal, here different probably due to obfuscation, see image file history for more information), with the initial &quot;12&quot; corresponding to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the third digits (&quot;1&quot; and &quot;9&quot;) corresponding to check processing centers, and the fourth digits (&quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;) corresponding to where the bank is located – &quot;0&quot; indicates &quot;in the Federal Reserve city of San Francisco&quot;, while &quot;1&quot; indicates &quot;in the state of California&quot;.
* the final &quot;3&quot; in the MICR is the check digit, and
* the &quot;01&quot; below the fraction form is the branch number.

In the case of a MICR line that is illegible or torn, the check can still be processed without the check digit. Typically, a repair strip or sleeve is attached to the check, then a new MICR line is imprinted. Either 021200025 or 0212-0002 (with a hyphen, but no check digit) may be printed, and both are 9 digits. The former (with check digit) is preferred to ensure better accuracy, but requires computing the check digit, while the latter is easily determined by inspection of the fraction, with minimal clerical handling.

===MICR routing number format===
The MICR routing number consists of nine digits:
: XXXXYYYYC
where XXXX is Federal Reserve Routing Symbol, YYYY is ABA Institution Identifier,
and C is the check digit.

====Federal Reserve====
The Federal Reserve uses the ABA RTN system for processing its customers&#x27; payments. The ABA RTNs were originally assigned in the systematic way outlined below, reflecting a financial institution&#x27;s geographical location and internal handling by the Federal Reserve. Following consolidation of the Federal Reserve&#x27;s check processing facilities, and the consolidation in the banking industry, the RTN a financial institution uses may not reflect the &quot;Fed District&quot; where the financial institution&#x27;s place of business is located. Check processing is now centralized at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.

The first two digits of the nine digit RTN must be in the ranges 00 through 12, 21 through 32, 61 through 72, or 80.

The digits are assigned as follows:
* 00 is used by the United States Government
* 01 through 12 are the &quot;normal&quot; routing numbers, and correspond to the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. For example, 0260-0959-3 is the routing number for Bank of America incoming wires in New York, with the initial &quot;02&quot; indicating the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
* 21 through 32 were assigned only to thrift institutions (e.g. credit unions and savings banks) through 1985, but are no longer assigned (thrifts are assigned normal 01–12 numbers). Currently they are still used by the thrift institutions, or their successors, and correspond to the normal routing number, plus 20. (For example, 2260-7352-3 is the routing number for Grand Adirondack Federal Credit Union in New York, with the initial &quot;22&quot; corresponding to &quot;02&quot; (New York Fed) plus &quot;20&quot; (thrift).)
* 61 through 72 are special purpose routing numbers designated for use by non-bank payment processors and clearinghouses and are termed Electronic Transaction Identifiers (ETIs), and correspond to the normal routing number, plus 60.
* 80 is used for traveler&#x27;s checks

The first two digits correspond to the 12 Federal Reserve Banks as follows:

The third digit corresponds to the Federal Reserve check processing center originally assigned to the bank.

The fourth digit is &quot;0&quot; if the bank is located in the Federal Reserve city proper, and otherwise is 1–9, according to which state in the Federal Reserve district it is.

====ABA Institution Identifier====
The fifth through eighth digits constitute the bank&#x27;s unique ABA identity within the given Federal Reserve district.

====Check digit====
The ninth, check digit provides a checksum test using a position-weighted sum of each of the digits. High-speed check-sorting equipment will typically verify the checksum and if it fails, route the item to a reject pocket for manual examination, repair, and re-sorting. Mis-routings to an incorrect bank are thus greatly reduced.

The following condition must hold:

: (Mod or modulo is the remainder of a division operation.)
In terms of weights, this is 371 371 371. This allows one to catch any single-digit error (incorrectly inputting one digit), together with most transposition errors. 1, 3, and 7 are used because they (together with 9) are coprime to 10; using a coefficient that is divisible by 2 or 5 would lose information (because formula_1), and thus would not catch some substitution errors. These do not catch transpositions of two digits that differ by 5 (0 and 5, 1 and 6, 2 and 7, 3 and 8, 4 and 9), but captures other transposition errors.

As an example, consider 111000025 (which is a valid routing number of Bank of America in Virginia). Applying the formula, we get:

====Routing symbol====
The symbol that delimits a routing transit number is the MICR E-13B transit character ⑆ This character, with Unicode value U+2446, appears at right.

===Fraction format===
The fraction form looks like a fraction, with a numerator and a denominator.

The numerator consists of two parts separated by a dash. The prefix (no longer used in check processing, yet still printed on most checks) is a 1 or 2 digit code (P or PP) indicating the region where the bank is located. The numbers 1 to 49 are cities, assigned by size of the cities in 1910. The numbers 50 to 99 are states, assigned in a rough spatial geographic order, and are used for banks located outside one of the 49 numbered cities.

The second part of the numerator (after the dash) is the bank&#x27;s ABA Institution Identifier, which also forms digits 5 to 8 of the nine digit routing number (YYYY).

The denominator is also part of the routing number; by adding leading zeroes to make up four digits where necessary (e.g. 212 is written as 0212, 31 is written as 0031, etc.), it forms the first four digits of the routing number (XXXX).

There might also be a fourth element printed to the right of the fraction: this is the bank&#x27;s branch number. It is not included in the MICR line. It would only be used internally by the bank, e.g. to show where the signature card is located, where to contact the responsible officer in case of an overdraft, etc.

For example, a check from Wachovia Bank in Yardley, PA, has a fraction of 55-2/212 and a routing number of 021200025. The prefix (55) no longer has any relevance, but from the remainder of the fraction, the first 8 digits of the routing number (02120002) can be determined, and the check digit (the last digit, 5 in this example) can be calculated by using the check digit formula (thus giving 021200025).

This table is up to date as of 2020. One weakness of the current routing table arrangement is that various territories like American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands share the same routing code.

<text>Valley Parade, which is currently known as University of Bradford Stadium, is an all-seater football stadium in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. The stadium was built in 1886 as the home of Manningham Rugby Football Club; it remained so until 1903, when the club changed code from rugby league to association football, and became Bradford City A.F.C.. Valley Parade has since been Bradford City&#x27;s home ground, and is now owned by the pension fund of the club&#x27;s former chairman Gordon Gibb. The stadium has also hosted Bradford (Park Avenue) for one season and the rugby-league side Bradford Bulls for two seasons, and has accommodated a number of England youth team fixtures.

In 1908, the football architect Archibald Leitch was commissioned to redevelop the ground when Bradford City were promoted to the First Division. Few changes were made until a fatal fire on 11 May 1985, when 56 supporters were killed and at least 265 were injured. Following the fire, the stadium underwent a £2.6-million redevelopment and was re-opened in December 1986. The ground underwent significant changes in the 1990s and the early 2000s, and now has a capacity of 25,136. The attendance record of 39,146 was set in 1911 at an FA Cup tie against Burnley, making it the oldest-surviving attendance record at a Football League ground in England. The highest attendance at Valley Parade, as it is now, is 24,343, was set at a pre-season friendly against Liverpool in 2019. In 2022, the stadium&#x27;s name was changed because of sponsorship from the University of Bradford.

==History==
Manningham Rugby Football Club,which was formed in 1876, played games at Cardigan Fields in the Carlisle Road area of Bradford. When their ground was sold to facilitate the construction of Drummond School, the club bought one-third of the Valley Parade site in Manningham, taking a short-term lease on the rest of the land in time to play there for the 1886–1887 season. The new ground and the road upon which it was built adopted the area&#x27;s name Valley Parade, which was derived from the steep hillside below Manningham. The land was previously a quarry, and formed part of a larger site that was owned by Midland Railway Company.

The club spent £1,400 appointing designers to oversee the excavation and levelling of the land, and moved a one-year-old stand from Carlisle Road to the highest part of the new ground. The original ground comprised the relocated stand, a 2,000-capacity stepped enclosure with the players&#x27; changing rooms beneath the stand, the playing area, a cinder athletics track and fencing to limit the capacity to 18,000. The playing field was made of ballast, ashes, soil and sods. The ground was officially opened on 27 September 1886 for a game against Wakefield Trinity, which was watched by a capacity crowd, but construction work meant most of Manningham&#x27;s early games were away fixtures.

On 25 December 1888, 12-year old Thomas Coyle was killed at the ground when the barrier under which he was sitting collapsed on him, breaking his neck. An inquest decided the death was an accident that happened due to the weight of spectators leaning on the barrier. The takings from the game, totalling £115, were distributed to Coyle&#x27;s family and those of other boys who were injured in the incident.

Manningham RFC continued playing until 1903, when financial difficulties caused by relegation at the turn of the 20th century prompted club officials to change codes from rugby league to association football. The first association-football game to be played at Valley Parade on 6 April 1903 was a promotional fixture between a side of West-Yorkshire footballers and Sheffield United&#x27;s 1903 FA Cup-winning side. The game was organised to stimulate interest in the sport in Bradford and attracted 8,000 fans. The new football club, Bradford City, were elected to The Football League&#x27;s Division Two the following month. Bradford City&#x27;s first game at Valley Parade came on 5 September 1903 against Gainsborough Trinity, drawing a crowd of 11,000. As a result of alterations first implemented in 1897, City players originally changed in a shed behind one end of the ground and visiting teams used the old rugby club&#x27;s dressing rooms at the back of the nearby Belle Vue Hotel. After City&#x27;s 5–1 defeat by Manchester United on 10 February 1906, United player Bob Bonthron was attacked as he left the ground. As a result, The Football Association (FA) closed the ground for 14 days, ordering City to switch its changing rooms to the nearby Artillery Barracks for the 1906–07 season. Several supporters faced criminal proceedings for the incident.

After Bradford City won the Division Two championship in 1907–08, the club hurriedly reconstructed the ground to prepare for the club&#x27;s first season in Division One. Football architect Archibald Leitch was commissioned to design new terracing in the paddock—a standing area in front of the 5,300-seat main stand that was built in 1908—and build a Spion Kop at the north side of the ground and an 8,000-capacity stand at the Midland Road end opposite the main stand. Further work was done to lower the railings, erect barriers, move the pitch and add extra turnstiles. The changing rooms were moved and a tunnel leading from the rooms underneath the Kop along the main-stand side of the ground was built. The total project cost £9,958, and raised the capacity to 40,000. The work was completed midway through the 1908–09 season. Following the work, the first match took place on 25 December 1908, when 36,000 fans saw Bradford City host Bristol City. The improvements allowed Bradford City to set their attendance record of 39,146 on 11 March 1911 against Burnley during the club&#x27;s FA-Cup-winning run. It is the longest-surviving attendance record at any league ground in England.

On 17 March 1932, Bradford City paid Midland Railway Company £3,750 for the remaining two-thirds of the site to become outright owners of the ground, which was now 45 years old. The stadium had remained almost unchanged since 1908, and did so until 1952, when its capacity was reduced after examinations of the foundations were ordered following the 1946 Burnden Park disaster. The investigation resulted in the closure of half of the Midland Road stand, whose steel frame was sold to Berwick Rangers for £450, and a smaller replacement stand was built at Valley Parade in 1954. Six years later, the stand was again demolished because of continuing foundation problems. Six years later, all four stands at Valley Parade were able to be opened for the first time. To enable construction of a new stand on the Midland Road side of the ground, the club directors had the pitch moved closer to the main stand. The new stand was then the narrowest in the league. Further improvements to the stand were made in 1969, ready for the club&#x27;s FA Cup tie with Division One side Tottenham Hotspur on 3 January 1970, which ended in a 2–2 draw in front of 23,000 fans. The cost of the work forced the club to sell Valley Parade to Bradford Corporation for £35,000, but it was bought back in 1979 for the same price.

From 1908 to 1985, the club carried out other work on the rest of the ground. These works included the introduction of floodlights in English football. Valley Parade&#x27;s first floodlights cost £3,000 and were mounted on telegraph poles running along each side of the ground, and were first used for a match against Hull City on 20 December 1954. The floodlights were replaced in 1960 and again used for the first time against Hull City; in 1962, one floodlight collapsed and an FA Cup match against Gateshead went ahead with only three pylons, prompting an FA inquiry. In 1985, the football-ground writer Simon Inglis described the view from the main stand, which was still the same as when it was in 1908, as &quot;like watching football from the cockpit of a Sopwith Camel&quot; because of its antiquated supports and struts.

On 11 May 1985, 56 people died and at least 265 were injured in the Bradford City stadium fire at Valley Parade&#x27;s main stand; it was one of the UK&#x27;s worst sporting disasters. The fire started 40 minutes into the club&#x27;s final game of the 1984–85 season against Lincoln City. The main stand was destroyed in nine minutes. For the next season and the first five months of the 1986–87 season, Bradford City played home games at Leeds United&#x27;s stadium at Elland Road, Huddersfield Town&#x27;s ground at Leeds Road and Bradford Northern&#x27;s Odsal Stadium, while Valley Parade was rebuilt. The Huddersfield-based firm J Wimpenny carried out the £2.6 million work, which included funding from insurance pay-outs, The Football League stadium grants, club funds, and a £1.46 million Government loan obtained by the Bradford MPs Geoffrey Lawler and Max Madden. A new, 5,000 all-seater main stand that was longer than the previous structure, was built. The Kop was covered for the first time and increased to a 7,000 capacity. Other minor work was carried out to the ground&#x27;s other two stands. On 14 December 1986, 582 days after the fire, The Hon Sir Oliver Popplewell, who had conducted the inquiry into the fire, opened the new stadium before an exhibition match against an England international XI. The new stand was first used for a league game on 26 December when City lost 1–0 to Derby County

The two stands that were not altered after the fire were improved during the 1990s. In 1991, the Bradford end of the ground was made a double-decker, all-seater stand, with a new scoreboard. FollowingCity&#x27;s promotion to Division One in 1996, the club&#x27;s chairman Geoffrey Richmond announced the construction of a 4,500-seat stand on the Midland Road side. The new stand was first used for a Yorkshire derby against Sheffield United on 26 December 1996 and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 27 March 1997. Richmond continued his plans to redevelop the ground asthe club continued to rise through the league. The roof of the Kop, which was the largest safe-standing terrace in England at the time, was removed and the capacity reduced during City&#x27;s 1998–99 promotion season to prepare for a summer £6.5 million rebuilding programme. The Kop was converted into a two-tier, 7,500-seat stand. An additional 2,300-seat capacity corner section was built, filling the corner between the main stand and the Kop. The new section was opened in December 2000, taking the capacity of Valley Parade to more than 20,000 for the first time since 1970. A suite of offices and a shop were added at the same time. Once the work was completed, a second tier was added to the main stand at the cost of £6.5 million. It was opened in 2001, increasing the main stand&#x27;s capacity to 11,000, and the ground&#x27;s capacity to 25,000.

Richmond also planned to increase the main stand&#x27;s capacity by a further 1,800 seats by building new changing rooms and office blocks, and adding a second tier to the Midland Road stand to increase the ground&#x27;s capacity to more than 35,000. In May 2002, the club went into administration and Richmond was replaced by new co-owners Julian Rhodes and Gordon Gibb. The following year, Valley Parade was sold to Gibb&#x27;s pension fund for £5 million, and the club&#x27;s offices, shop and car park were sold to the London-based company Development Securities for £2.5 million. In 2011, Bradford City&#x27;s annual rent bill to Gibb&#x27;s pension fund was £370,000. The total budget for the year, including other rent payments, rates, maintenance and utility bills was £1.25 million.

Valley Parade has been renamed several times for sponsorship reasons. Sponsors have included the radio station The Pulse of West Yorkshire, the bank Bradford &amp; Bingley, the electronics firm Intersonic and the double-glazing firm Coral Windows. The ground was renamed Northern Commercials Stadium in July 2016 but was still commonly known as Valley Parade. In July 2019 it was re-sponsored and renamed the Utilita Energy Stadium. This deal concluded in July 2022 and the stadium was subsequently renamed University of Bradford Stadium.

==Structure and facilities==
The Valley Parade stadium is divided into five all-seater stands, the JCT600 Stand, the Kop, the Midland Road Stand, the North West Corner and the TL Dallas Stand. All five stands, except for a small part of the main stand, are covered and all but the Midland Road Stand are two-tiered. Most of the stands are cantilever structures, and because of the ground&#x27;s location on the hillside, the Midland Road Stand overhangs the road.

Many of the stands have more-traditional names but have since been renamed because of sponsorship deals. The JCT600 Stand is the ground&#x27;s main stand, and fans often call thus, but is also known as the Sunwin Stand after its former sponsor. The Kop, was the standing area whose name was derived, like at many stadia across England, from the Battle of Spion Kop. The East Stand, which is sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road Stand because of the road on that side of the ground. The TL Dallas Stand is also known as the Bradford end because it is nearest to the city centre.

The capacity of Valley Parade is 24,840. The largest stand is the Morrisons Family Stand, which holds 9,004 supporters, followed by the Kop, which has a capacity of 7,392. The Bradford Lifts Stand holds 4,500 and the North West Corner 2,300. The TL Dallas Stand is the smallest of the five stands with a capacity of 1,644. The stadium includes 1,34 seats for media representatives.

The Sunwin Stand has further room for expansion, and is unusual because it covers only three-quarters of the length of the pitch. The rest of this side is taken up by a brick building in the south-west corner of the stadium that houses the club&#x27;s changing rooms and security offices. The Sunwin Stand also includes the ground&#x27;s 17 executive boxes and conference facilities, which have capacity of 700 people. A second function room, called the Bantams Bar, in the Kop can accommodate 300 people. There is more office space, a club store, ticket office and a museum in the car park behind the Kop. From early 2010, the area near the store includes a dental surgery, which will be run by NHS Bradford and Airedale in partnership with the football club.

Visiting team fans sat in the TL Dallas Stand from 1995 to 2008, but have also been given other parts of the ground for large matches. In March 2008, the club announced the TL Dallas Stand would be made available for home fans during the 2008–2009 season. The decision came after an overwhelmingly positive text-message poll from the club&#x27;s supporters to use the Bradford End of the ground. Fans of visiting teams have been accommodated in the end blocks of the East Stand since the start of the 2008–2009 season.

==Fire disaster==

On 11 May 1985, 11,076 people attended Bradford City&#x27;s final Division Three game of the 1984–1985 season against Lincoln City. The Bradford side had won the Division Three title the week before when they defeated Bolton Wanderers 2–0. The league trophy was presented to City&#x27;s skipper Peter Jackson before the Lincoln game. The score was still 0–0 after 40 minutes of the game when a small fire was noticed three rows from the back near one end of the main stand. The flames became more visible within minutes, and police started to evacuate people in the stand less than six minutes later.

The club&#x27;s chairman Stafford Heginbotham, who was in the main stand, described the effect and his reaction to the disaster: &quot;The fire just spread along the length of the stand in seconds. The smoke was choking. We couldn&#x27;t breathe. It was to be our day.&quot; The game was stopped and the wooden roof caught fire. The fire spread the length of the stand, and timber and the roof began to fall onto the crowds. Black smoke enveloped the rear passageways, where fans were trying to escape. The fire killed 56 spectators, ranging in age from 11-year-old children to the 86-year-old former chairman of the club Sam Firth. At least 265 supporters were injured. In some cases, the few narrow escape routes led to locked doors and the only escape for most spectators was directly onto the pitch. The match was abandoned and never replayed; The Football League ordered the score at the time of abandonment to stand. According to Steve Smith, a former club official: 

In 1986, Sir Oliver Popplewell published his inquiry into the fire, which led to the introduction of new safety legislation for sports grounds across England. The forensic scientist David Woolley believed the cause of the fire was a discarded cigarette or a match that had dropped through gaps between the seating to a void below the stand where rubbish had built up. A number of police officers and 22 spectators were given bravery awards for their actions during the incident.

The stand&#x27;s wooden roof was due to be replaced the day after the Lincoln match because it did not meet the safety regulations required for Division Two, in which the team would be playing in the following season. Work did not begin until July 1986. The ground was used for reserve-team fixtures from September 1985 but only journalists and club officials were able to watch. Bradford City&#x27;s senior team played home games at other grounds in West Yorkshire for 19 months while Valley Parade was rebuilt. The new ground, which cost £2.6 million (£ million today) to rebuild, was reopened in December 1986.

More than £3.5 million (£ million today) was raised for victims of the fire and their families through the Bradford Disaster Appeal Fund. Memorials have been erected at the ground and at Bradford City Hall, the latter of which was provided by Bradford&#x27;s twin town of Hamm, Germany. The disaster is also marked by an annual remembrance ceremony on 11 May at Bradford City Hall, and an annual Easter-weekend youth tournament, which is contested between Bradford, Lincoln and other European teams.

==Other uses==
Valley Parade was the headquarters of The 2nd West Riding Brigade Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Force). The ground hosted its first international football game just two months after its first Football League match. The game&#x27;s governing bodies wanted to promote football in the West Riding of Yorkshire and chose Valley Parade to host a game between an English League side and an Irish League side, despite the ground being below standard. An estimated 20,000 spectators attended the match on 10 October 1903, which the English League won 2–1. Over the next 20 years, the ground hosted a number of other representative games, including an England international trial, the 1904 FA Amateur Cup Final and an under-15s schoolboy international between England and Scotland. On 6 April 1987, the ground hosted another international when England under-18s drew 1–1 with Switzerland.

Other under-18 fixtures have been played since 1987, the last of which was between England and Belgium in November 2000. It hosted two England under-21 international friendlies; the first was against Denmark&#x27;s under-21s side on 8 October 1999, which ended with a score of England 4–1 Denmark. The other was against Italy&#x27;s under-21s on 26 March 2002, which ended in a 1–1 draw with 21,642 in attendance. Valley Parade&#x27;s next international came seven years later when Bradford City hosted an under-19s European Championship qualifying game, in which England defeated Slovakia 4–1. The England women&#x27;s team have also played at Valley Parade, including their 1994 first home match under the auspices of The Football Association (FA) against Spain.

Bradford (Park Avenue) have played 29 games at Valley Parade, including a 2–0 friendly victory over Swiss side AC Lugano in 1962, and all of their home fixtures in 1973–1974, their last season before the club&#x27;s extinction. Bradford&#x27;s rugby league side Bradford Northern played a number of fixtures at Valley Parade between 1920 and 1937, as well as three games in the 1980s and the 1990s. Bradford Northern became Bradford Bulls with the advent of the Super League, and played two seasons at Valley Parade in 2001 and 2002 while their home ground Odsal Stadium was redeveloped.

==Records==
The record attendance at Valley Parade is 39,146 for Bradford City&#x27;s FA Cup fourth round tie against Burnley on 11 March 1911. The highest league attendance of 37,059 was for a Bradford derby match between Bradford City and Bradford (Park Avenue) on 17 September 1927 in Division Three (North). The record attendance since the Valley Parade grounds were rebuilt in 1986 with all-seated attendance is 24,343, which was set on 14 July 2019 during a pre-season friendly against Liverpool. The highest attendance for a competitive fixture is 24,321, which was set on 7 March 2015 in the 2015 FA Cup quarter-finals draw against Reading, exceeding the previous record of 23,971, which was set on 10 December 2012 in the club&#x27;s 2012–13 Football League Cup quarter-finals win against Arsenal. The lowest attendance for a league home match at Valley Parade is 1,249, which occurred on 15 May 1981, for a Division Four fixture with Hereford United. The record gate receipts for Bradford City is £181,990 for the Premier League game with Manchester United on 13 January 2001.

The Football League did not record official attendance figures for league games until 1925. City&#x27;s official highest-average attendance at Valley Parade since then is 18,551 for the 1928–29 promotion season from Division Three (North), although the club reported an average of 22,585 in 1920–21. After Bradford City were promoted to the Premier League in 1999, the club again recorded average attendances in excess of 18,000. City recorded an average attendance of 18,030 in 1999–2000, and 18,511 the following season.

During their two years at Valley Parade, Bradford Bulls recorded their highest attendance of 16,572 on 4 March 2001 against St. Helens. Bulls averaged 11,488 in 2002 for Super League VII. The highest crowd for a Bradford Northern fixture at Valley Parade was 20,973 on 13 February 1926 for a Challenge Cup game against Keighley, which finished 2–2.

==Transport==
Bradford is served by two railway stations; Bradford Interchange, which is also the city&#x27;s main bus terminus, and from Valley Parade. The other is Bradford Forster Square, which is away from the ground. Bradford Interchange connects to Leeds railway station for London North Eastern Railway and CrossCountry train services, Grand Central provide a direct service to London, and provides First Bradford and Keighley Bus Company buses to the ground. Forster Square, which provides train services operated by Northern, also connects to Leeds. The stadium has no parking facilities available to supporters on match days. In 2000, as part of the expansion of Valley Parade, the club drew up a green transport plan to ease traffic congestion around the ground. Proposals included a new railway station on the line between Leeds and Bradford Forster Square, and a discounted bus service. , no railway station had been built and a discounted bus route was withdrawn because of low patronage.

<text>Titan is a science fiction novel by American writer John Varley, the first book in his Gaea Trilogy, published in 1979. It won the 1980 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and was nominated for both the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1979, and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1980.

==Plot==
A scientific expedition to the planet Saturn in 2025, aboard the ship &quot;Ringmaster&quot;, discovers a strange satellite in orbit around the planet. Commanding the ship is Cirocco Jones, a tall NASA career woman, aided by astronomer Gaby Plauget, the clone twin physicists April and August Polo, pilot Eugene Springfield, physician Calvin Greene and engineer Bill (whose last name is never given).

As they reach the satellite they realize it is a huge hollow torus, a Stanford torus habitat. Before they can report this, the ship is entangled in cables from the object. The crew is rendered unconscious and later wake up inside the habitat. Initially separated, Cirroco and Gaby find each other and travel together through the world inside the torus to find the rest of the crew.

They find Calvin living as a companion inside a &quot;Blimp&quot;, an intelligent gasbag a kilometer long, one of many that swim forever in the air inside the habitat. Calvin can speak to the blimp and understand its responses, which consist of whistles. His blimp&#x27;s name is &quot;Whistlestop&quot;, in human terms. Calvin helps Gaby and Cirocco find the other crew members (except April). He ultimately decides to leave his human companions to live with the blimp permanently.

The remaining companions encounter the Titanides, strange centaur-like beings who speak a language based on music. Cirocco finds she has the ability to speak their language. The Titanides are in a perpetual state of war with the Angels, birdlike humanoid creatures. They fight because of an impulse that occurs when they are near each other, but do not know why they have the impulse.

The humans learn from the Titanides that the torus itself is alive, and a controlling intelligence, called &quot;Gaea&quot;, lives in the hub of the torus 600 km above them. Cirocco, Gaby, and Gene decide to climb up to this place using the support cables that maintain the structure against centrifugal force. During the journey, Gene&#x27;s behavior becomes increasingly erratic. He rapes and assaults Gaby and leaves her for dead, and then rapes Cirocco. However, Gaby is not dead and rescues Cirocco, cutting off Gene&#x27;s ear with a hatchet and destroying his face. The two women continue climbing for months. High in one of the spokes of the great wheel they find April, who has been transformed into an angel. She, like the other Angels, is solitary by nature, and can hardly bear to be near them.

Finally reaching the hub, they discover Gaea, who presents herself as a frumpy middle-aged woman. She explains that the great wheel is very old. Some of the regional intelligences around the rim have rebelled against the center, and it was one of these regional intelligences that captured the &quot;Ringmaster&quot; and altered its crew, not Gaea herself. Gaea rescued them and, unable to change them back, placed them where they would be happy. 

Gaea has been watching television signals from Earth and is obsessed by movies, especially from Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age. Having seen war movies, and deciding that humanity will inevitably declare war on her, the Titanide-Angel war was a way for her to practice.

Gaea offers to give Cirocco a long life and unusual abilities in exchange for being Gaea&#x27;s agent at the Rim, her &quot;Wizard&quot;. Cirocco accepts, with the condition that the war between the Titanides and Angels must stop.

<text>In Greek mythology, Theoclymenus (; Ancient Greek: Θεοκλύμενος) was a prophet from Argos. He is a character in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, in which he accompanies Telemachus from Pylos back to Ithaca. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, he forsees Odysseus&#x27; return to Ithaca and the death of Penelope&#x27;s suitors, but he is not believed when he reveals these visions.

== Family ==
Theoclymenus was the son of Polypheides and Aechme, daughter of Haemon, and brother of Harmonides. In some accounts, his parents were Thestor and possibly Polymele, and thus, the brother of Leucippe, Theonoe and Calchas.

== Mythology ==
In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, he escaped from Argos after killing one of his relatives. He fled to Pylos and sought refuge aboard the ship of Telemachus, who had come to inquire about the fate of his father, Odysseus. Telemachus obliged, and Theoclymenus accompanied him back to Ithaca. There, Theoclymenus interpreted the auspices of the birds, predicting that Telemachus would become head of the royal house of Ithaca. He also prophesied that Odysseus was already in Ithaca, disguised and watching as events unfolded. When he told Penelope of these signs, she did not believe him. Later, at dinner, he had a vision of the death of the suitors, but they laughed at his predictions, not knowing they would be killed that night.

== Theoclymenos of Egypt ==
Theoclymenos is also the name of the king of Egypt in Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Helen&quot;. He is the son of Proteus, who he succeeds as kind, and the brother of the seer Theonoe.

<text>Lake Inari (, , , , , ) is the largest lake in Sápmi and the third-largest lake in Finland. It is located in the northern part of Lapland, north of the Arctic Circle. The lake is above sea level, and is regulated at the Kaitakoski power plant in Russia. The freezing period normally extends from November to early June.

The best-known islands of the lake are Hautuumaasaari (&quot;Graveyard Island&quot;), which served as a cemetery for ancient Sami people, and Ukonkivi (&quot;Ukko&#x27;s Stone&quot;), a sacrificial place of the ancient inhabitants of the area. There are over 3,000 islands in total. Trout, lake salmon, Arctic char, white fish, grayling, perch and pike are found in Lake Inari.

The lake covers . It empties northwards through the Paatsjoki at the mouth of the Varangerfjord, which is a bay of the Barents Sea.

The lake depression is a graben bounded by faults active in the Cenozoic.

The name of Lake Inari comes possibly from a Pre-Finno-Ugric substrate language.

On 28 December 1984, a Soviet guided missile crashed into the Lake Inari.

<text>A factsheet or fact sheet, also called fact file, is a single-page document containing essential information about a product, substance, service or other topic. Factsheets are frequently used to provide information to an end user, consumer or member of the public in concise, simple language. They generally contain key safety points, operating instructions or basic information about a topic depending on the purpose of the fact sheet.

==Typical contents==
Factsheets frequently make use of elements such as lists, tables and diagrams to convey meaning quickly and effectively. The language and content of a factsheet depend on its target audience; a factsheet aimed at professional engineers may use more technical language than one aimed at an end-user.

==History==
Factsheets were traditionally printed and physically distributed, often included in the packaging of a product. Many manufacturers now provide digital factsheets as well as or instead of paper-and-ink documents.

== Examples ==
*The World Health Organization provides fact sheets on wide range of health issues
* The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration provides planetary fact sheets.
* The US conservation organization Defenders of Wildlife provides fact sheets about animals.
* The World Factbook, a collection from the US Central Intelligence Agency of tabular factsheets on various countries.
* The Federal Republic of Germany has published a fact sheet on the unique dual vocational training system.

<doc id="599326" wikidata="Q51960" url="?curid=599326" title="Marisa Monte">
<text>Marisa de Azevedo Monte (Brazilian Portuguese: ) (born 1 July 1967) is a Brazilian singer, composer, instrumentalist, and producer of Brazilian popular music and samba. As of 2011, she had sold 10 million albums worldwide and has won numerous national and international awards, including four Latin Grammys, seven Brazilian MTV Video Music Awards, nine Multishow de Música Brasileira awards, 5 APCAs, and six Prêmio TIM de Música. Marisa is considered by &quot;Rolling Stone Brasil&quot; to be the second greatest singer, behind only Elis Regina. She also has two albums (&quot;MM&quot; and &quot;Verde, Anil, Amarelo, Cor-de-Rosa e Carvão&quot;) on the list of the 100 best albums of Brazilian music.

==Biography==
Monte was born in Rio de Janeiro, daughter of the engineer Carlos Saboia Monte and Sylvia Marques de Azevedo Monte. On her father&#x27;s side, she is descended from the Saboias, one of the oldest Italian families in Brazil. She studied singing, piano, and drums as a child, and began studying opera singing at 14.

At the age of 19, Monte went to Italy to study bel canto, while also performing Brazilian music in bars and clubs, leading her to meet famous producer Nelson Motta. Upon her return to Rio in 1987, Motta produced her live concert, where Monte became a hybrid of MPB diva and pop rock performer. While most of her music is in the style of modern MPB, she has also recorded traditional samba and folk tunes, largely in collaboration with such musicians and songwriters as Carlinhos Brown, Arnaldo Antunes, and Nando Reis and producer Arto Lindsay. She has also collaborated with the New York pop music vanguard, including Laurie Anderson, David Byrne, Marc Ribot, Bernie Worrell and Philip Glass.

===Career===
In 1988, Monte signed with EMI and took the opportunity of Rede Manchete wanting a TV special covering her live concert to release it as the LP and VHS &quot;MM&quot; in 1989, a critical and commercial success pushed by the single &quot;Bem Que Se Quis&quot;, a Motta-penned Portuguese version of Pino Daniele&#x27;s &quot;E Po&#x27; Che Fa&#x27;&quot;.

Monte owns the rights to all of her songs; it was her chief demand for renewing her contract with EMI Music.

Her 2008 single &quot;Não é Proibido&quot; was used in the soundtrack of a video game by EA Sports, &quot;2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa.&quot;

Presto was also used to power the Opera Mini and Opera Mobile browsers.

Presto is a dynamic engine. Web pages can be re-rendered completely or partially in response to DOM events. Its releases saw a number of bug fixes and optimizations to improve the speed of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) engine. It is proprietary and only available as a part of the Opera browsers.

==ECMAScript engines==
A succession of ECMAScript engines have been used with Opera. (For the origin of their names, see Cultural notes below.) Pre-Presto versions of Opera used the Linear A engine. Opera versions based on the Core fork of Presto, Opera 7.0 through 9.27, used the Linear B engine. The Futhark engine is used in some versions on the Core 2 fork of Presto, namely Opera 9.5 to Opera 10.10. When released it was the fastest engine around, but in 2008 a new generation of ECMAScript engines from Google (V8), Mozilla (SpiderMonkey), and Apple (JavaScriptCore) took one more step, introducing native code generation. This opened up for potential heavy computations on the client side and Futhark, though still fast and efficient, was unable to keep up.

In early 2009, Opera introduced the Carakan engine. It featured register-based bytecode, native code generation, automatic object classification, and overall performance improvements. Early access in the Opera 10.50 pre-alpha showed that it is as fast as the fastest competitors, being the winner in 2 out of the 3 most used benchmarks.

==History and development==

==Presto-based applications==

===Web browsers===
*Opera
**Opera 7 to 12
**Opera Mobile 9.5 to 12
**Opera Mini (continues to use Presto rendering on an intermediate server on keypad phones and as Extreme mode on Android devices)
*Nintendo
**Nintendo DS Browser (based on Opera)
**Nintendo DSi Browser (based on Opera)
**Wii Internet Channel Browser (based on Opera)
*Nokia 770 Browser (based on Opera)
*Sony Mylo COM-1&#x27;s Browser (based on Opera)

===HTML editors===
*Macromedia Dreamweaver MX to Dreamweaver CS3 (CS4/CS5 use WebKit)
*Adobe Creative Suite 2 and 3

== Source code leak ==
The source code for version 12.15 was leaked to GitHub on February 11, 2016. It remained unnoticed until January 12, 2017 and was taken down two days later in response to a DMCA request. Opera Software has confirmed the authenticity of the source code.

==Cultural notes==
The ECMAScript engines used with Opera have been named after ancient and traditional writing scripts, including undeciphered Linear A, Ancient Greek Linear B, Runic Futhark, and Javanese Carakan.

<doc id="599340" wikidata="Q6627887" url="?curid=599340" title="List of medieval land terms">
<text>The feudal system, in which the land was owned by a monarch, who in exchange for homage and military service granted its use to tenants-in-chief, who in their turn granted its use to sub-tenants in return for further services, gave rise to several terms, particular to Britain, for subdivisions of land which are no longer in wide use. These medieval land terms include the following:

* a &quot;burgage&quot;, a plot of land rented from a lord or king
* a &quot;hide&quot;: the hide, from the Anglo-Saxon word meaning &quot;family&quot;, was, in the early medieval period, a land-holding that was considered sufficient to support a family. This was equivalent to 60 to 120 acres depending on the quality of the land. The hide was the basis for the assessment of taxes. The hide was not ubiquitous in Anglo-Saxon England, with, for example, land in Kent being assessed in sulungs (approximately twice the size of the average hide).
* a &quot;Knight&#x27;s fee&quot;: is the amount of land for which the services of a knight (for 40 days) were due to the Crown. It was determined by land value, and the number of hides in a Knight&#x27;s Fee varied.
* a &quot;hundred&quot;: a division of an English shire consisting of 100 &quot;hides&quot;. The hundreds of Stoke, Desborough and Burnham in Buckinghamshire are known as the Chiltern Hundreds.
* a &quot;franconian Lan&quot; used in Poland since the 13th century, consisted of 43.2 morgs = 23 to 28 hectares. The term &quot;Lan&quot; was also used to indicate a full-sized farm, as opposed to one split up into a number of smaller sections.
* a &quot;wapentake&quot;: a subdivision of a county used in Yorkshire and other areas of strong Danish influence. It is similar to &quot;hundred&quot; or a &quot;ward&quot;. It was used in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland.
* a &quot;shire&quot; was originally a type of a subdivision of a county; some shires evolved into administrative areas equivalent to a county; a shire was headed by a shire reeve (becoming sheriff, in Saskatchewan the mayor of a rural municipality is a reeve); shires were most commonly subdivided into hundreds, but other types of subdivisions were also made
* a &quot;rape&quot;: Sussex was divided into six rapes, which were intermediate divisions between the county and the &quot;hundred&quot;. A rape was to have its own river, forest and castle.
* a &quot;lathe&quot;: Kent was divided into five &quot;lathes&quot;, from the Old English &quot;laeth&quot;, meaning district.
* a &quot;riding&quot;: was a division of land in Yorkshire and in Lindsey, which was the northern part of modern day Lincolnshire. The riding was a third part of the shire. The name is derived from the Old Norse , meaning &quot;one-third&quot;.
* a &quot;ward&quot;: a ward is a subdivision of a county, equivalent to a &quot;wapentake&quot; or a &quot;hundred&quot;. It was used in Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland, and Durham.

<text>Kenneth Harold Norrie (born 1946) is a Canadian economic historian specializing in the economy of Western Canada at the turn of the century.

Born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Norrie received his undergraduate degree from the University of Saskatchewan and his PhD from Yale University. He spent much of his career at the University of Alberta, serving as chair of the Department of Economics and then as dean of the Faculty of Arts (1999–2001). He was provost of McMaster University from January 1, 2002, succeeding psychologist Harvey Weingarten who had left to become president of the University of Calgary. On September 22, 2006, Norrie suddenly resigned the provost position and resumed teaching and research activities as a member of the Faculty of Social Science. Since then he has been appointed as Vice-President (Research) of the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario.

Norrie is perhaps best known for his work with prairie wheat farming. He was a key researcher for the MacDonald Commission of the early 1980s, which recommended signing the Canadian-American Free Trade Agreement.

<text>The Ems Ukaz or Ems Ukase (; ), was an internal decree (&quot;ukaz&quot;) of Emperor Alexander II of Russia issued on banning the use of the Ukrainian language in print except for reprinting old documents. The ukaz also forbade the import of Ukrainian publications and the staging of plays or lectures in Ukrainian. It was named after the city of Bad Ems, Germany, where it was promulgated.

== Background ==
In the 1860s, a decade and a half after the Imperial Russian government had broken up the Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius in Kiev (March 1847) and exiled or arrested its founder Mykola Kostomarov and other prominent figures, Ukrainian intellectuals gained further awareness of their cultural background. &quot;Hromada&quot; cultural associations, named after the traditional village assembly, started in a number of cities, and Sunday schools started in the cities and towns since the Russian Imperial administration had neglected education. The new cultural movement was partly driven by publications in both Russian and Ukrainian, including journals (such as Kostomarov&#x27;s &quot;Osnova&quot;, 1861–62, and Hlibov&#x27;s &quot;Chernyhosvs&#x27;kyy Lystok&quot;, 1861–63), historical and folkloristic monographs (Kostomarov&#x27;s biography of the Cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Kulish&#x27;s two-volume folklore collection &quot;Zapiski o Yuzhnoy Rusi&quot;, &quot;Notes on Southern Rus&quot;&#x27;, 1856–57), and elementary primers (Kulish&#x27;s &quot;Hramatka&quot;, 1857, 1861, Shevchenko&#x27;s &quot;Bukvar Yuzhnoruskiy&quot;, 1861). In &quot;Osnova&quot;, Kostomarov published his influential article &quot;Dve russkiye narodnosti&quot; (&quot;Two Russian Nationalities&quot;).

Although Ukrainianism had been considered popular and somewhat chic in Russian cultural circles, a debate began at the time over its relation to the ideology of Russian Pan-Slavism, epitomised by a quotation of Pushkin (&quot;will not all the Slavic streams merge into the Russian sea?&quot;), and a rhetoric of criticism emerged. Conservative Russians called the Ukrainian movement a &quot;Polish intrigue&quot;, and Polish commentators had been complaining that Ukrainianism had been used as a weapon against Polish culture in Right-Bank Ukraine.

After the 1861 emancipation of the serfs in the Russian Empire, many landowners were unhappy with the loss of their serfs, and peasants were generally displeased with the terms of the emancipation. In the atmosphere of discontent, increasing reports reached the imperial government that Ukrainian leaders were plotting to separate from Russia. The 1863 January Uprising in Poland raised tensions around the issue of ethnic separatism in general even further. Several Ukrainian activists were arrested, Sunday schools and hromadas were closed, and their publication activities were suspended.

A new Ukrainian translation by Pylyp Morachevskyi of parts of the New Testament was vetted and passed by the Imperial Academy of Sciences but rejected by the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church because it was considered politically suspect. In response, Interior Minister Count Pyotr Valuyev issued a decree through an internal document circulated to the censors on 18 July 1863, known as Valuyev&#x27;s Circular, which implemented a policy based on the opinion of the Kyiv Censorship Committee, cited in the circular, that &quot;the Ukrainian language never existed, does not exist, and shall never exist&quot;. The circular banned the publication of secular and religious books, apart from &quot;belles-lettres&quot;, on the premise that the distribution of such publications was a tool to foster separatist tendencies, coming primarily from Poland.

== Ems Ukaz ==

In the 1870s, the Kyiv Hromada and the South-Western Branch of the Imperial Russian Geographic Society began to publish important works in Kyiv in the Russian language on Ukrainian ethnography. Authors included Mykhailo Drahomanov, Volodymyr Antonovych, Ivan Yakovych Rudchenko, and Pavlo Chubynsky. They held an Archaeological Congress in 1874, and published in the Russian-language paper &quot;Kyiv telegraf&quot;.

A member of the Geographic Society, Mikhail Yuzefovich, sent two letters to Saint Petersburg warning of separatist activity. Tsar Alexander II appointed an Imperial Commission on Ukrainophile Propaganda in the Southern Provinces of Russia, which found evidence of a danger to the state and recommended extending the scope of the Valuev Circular of 1863. While enjoying a spa in Bad Ems, Germany, on May 18, 1876, Alexander signed what would come to be called the Ems Ukaz, which extended the publication ban to all books and song lyrics in the &quot;Little Russian dialect&quot; and prohibited the import of such materials. Also, public lectures, plays, and song performances in Ukrainian were forbidden, as well as teaching of any discipline in Ukrainian. Prohibited was also preservation or circulation of any Ukrainian book in school libraries. Teachers suspected of Ukrainophilism were removed from teaching.

The ukaz coincided with other actions against the Ukrainian culture. Drahomanov and the fellow activist Mykola Ziber were removed from their posts at Kyiv&#x27;s University of St Vladimir and emigrated, along with other cultural leaders such as Fedir Vovk and Serhiy Podolynsky. The situation was exposed by professor Mykhailo Drahomanov at the 1878 Paris International Literary Congress.

=== &quot;Yaryzhka&quot; ===

In 1881, the new Emperor Alexander III amended the ukaz. Ukrainian lyrics and dictionaries were now allowed, but the &quot;Kulishivka&quot; Ukrainian alphabet was still prohibited, and such publications had to write Ukrainian with Russian orthography. That usage was disparagingly called the &quot;Yaryzhka&quot; (, ) by some Ukrainians in reference to the Russian letter &quot;yery&quot; . Performance of Ukrainian plays and humorous songs could be approved by governors or governors-general, but Ukrainian-only theatres and troupes could not be established. Earlier, in 1879, Russian Interior Minister Mikhail Loris-Melikov allowed the organization of theatrical performances and concerts in the Ukrainian language, but only on rural themes and outside Kiev.

Many illegal performances and publications were delivered by ingenuity and bribery, but Ukrainian cultural development practically ceased.

== Effectiveness of the ban ==
The Ems Ukaz significantly limited the development of Ukrainian culture in Russia. The Hromada association, which had about 100 members before the ukaz, had only 14 after it, and in 1900 it was still only 25. The Ukrainian language was excluded from education at every level. No press, scientific papers or modern, ambitious literature were published in the Ukrainian language. The Ukrainian language was slowly becoming the language of the lower, uneducated masses.

Nonetheless according to Ukrainian historian George Shevelov a plan to silence and annihilate Ukrainian literature failed completely. Books in Ukrainian were still published in the Russian Empire, albeit in the Russian alphabet and often after many years of effort. The &quot;Kievskaia Starina&quot; editors owned a bookstore with Ukrainian books in Kyiv. In 1898, the Moscow-based began printing Ukrainian books for the Ukrainian peasantry. In 1903, Kiev Governor-General Mikhail Dragomirov allowed &quot;Kievskaia Starina&quot; to publish fiction in Ukrainian.

The ban on the import of Ukrainian newspapers and books into Russia has been similarly ineffective. Ukrainian newspapers published in Galicia had numerous subscribers in Russian Ukraine (, for example, had 400 subscribers in 1890-1896).

== Aftermath ==
After the Russian Revolution of 1905, the Imperial Academy of Sciences recommended the lifting of the ukaz&#x27;s restrictions. Ukrainian-language newspapers began publication; &quot;Prosvita&quot; (‘Enlightenment’) educational societies were formed; some university professors lectured in Ukrainian; and the Orthodox bishop of the Podolia vicariate, Parfeniy Levytsky, allowed the language to be used in services and church schools there.

In 1910, concerned about potential revolutionary activity, Interior Minister Pyotr Stolypin restored the ukaz&#x27;s restrictions and shut down the Prosvita societies and Ukrainian-language publications. The Russian-language press and intellectuals launched a campaign against the idea of Ukrainian autonomy or separatism.

Thus, self-aware Ukrainians remained a small intelligentsia in Dnieper Ukraine that was out of touch with a much larger rural population, which lacked the opportunity for a cultural education. The Russian imperial ideology dominated the schools and the army, and the Russian language was the only one used for official business in the urban workplace, government offices, and public services. In the meantime, Ukrainian self-identity would grow in Austro-Hungarian Galicia, which was out of reach of Russian imperial authorities.

The ukaz was never cancelled but became void, along with all other Imperial Russian laws, in the February Revolution of 1917–18. After the Revolution, Ukrainian language, education and culture was allowed to flower in the Ukrainian National Republic and the Hetmanate, and briefly, under the Ukrainization policies of Soviet Ukraine before 1931.

<doc id="599356" wikidata="Q3324468" url="?curid=599356" title="Mort Sahl">
<text>Morton Lyon Sahl (May 11, 1927 – October 26, 2021) was a Canadian-born Jewish American comedian, actor, and social satirist, considered the first modern comedian. He pioneered a style of social satire that pokes fun at political and current event topics using improvised monologues and only a newspaper as a prop.

Sahl spent his early years in Los Angeles and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he made his professional stage debut at the hungry i nightclub in 1953. His popularity grew quickly, and after a year at the club, he traveled the country doing shows at established nightclubs, theaters, and college campuses. In 1960 he became the first comedian to be featured in a &quot;Time&quot; cover story. He appeared on various television shows, played a number of film roles, and performed a one-man show on Broadway.

Television host Steve Allen said that Sahl was &quot;the only real political philosopher we have in modern comedy&quot;. His social satire performances broke new ground in live entertainment, as a stand-up comic talking about the real world of politics at that time was considered &quot;revolutionary&quot;. It inspired many later comics to become stage comedians, including Lenny Bruce, Jonathan Winters, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Lewis Black and Woody Allen. Allen credits Sahl&#x27;s new style of humor with &quot;opening up vistas for people like me&quot;.

Numerous politicians became his fans, with John F. Kennedy asking him to write his jokes for campaign speeches, though Sahl later turned his barbs at the president. After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in 1963, Sahl focused on what he said were the Warren Report&#x27;s inaccuracies and conclusions and spoke about it often during his shows. This alienated much of his audience and led to a decline in his popularity for the remainder of the 1960s. By the 1970s, his shows and popularity staged a partial comeback that continued over the ensuing decades. A biography of Sahl, &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;, by James Curtis, was released in 2017.

==Early life and education==
Sahl was born on May 11, 1927, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the only child of Jewish parents. His father, Harry Sahl, came from an immigrant family on New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side, and hoped to become a Broadway playwright. Harry had met his wife, Dorothy (Schwartz), when she responded to an advertisement he placed in a poetry magazine. Unable to break into the writing field, they moved to Canada where he owned a tobacco store in Montreal.

Sahl&#x27;s family later relocated to Los Angeles, where his father, unable to become a Hollywood writer, worked as a clerk and court reporter for the FBI. Sahl notes, &quot;My dad was disappointed in his dreams and he distrusted that world for me.&quot; Sahl went to Belmont High School in Los Angeles, where he wrote for the school&#x27;s newspaper. Actor Richard Crenna was a classmate.

When the U.S. entered World War II after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Sahl, then aged 14, joined the school&#x27;s Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC). He won a medal for marksmanship and an American Legion &quot;Americanism award&quot;. Wanting to express his patriotism, he wore his ROTC uniform to school and in public and, when he turned fifteen, he dropped out of high school to join the United States Army by lying about his age. His mother tracked him down and brought him back home two weeks later after she had revealed his true age.

After Sahl graduated from high school, his father tried to get him into West Point and had received his Congressman&#x27;s help, but Sahl had by then already enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces. He was later stationed in Alaska with the 93rd Air Depot Group. In the military, however, he resisted the discipline and authoritarian control it exerted over his life. He expressed his nonconformity by growing a beard and refusing to wear a cap as required. He also wrote articles for a small newspaper criticizing the military that resulted in his being penalized with three months of KP duty. In an interview, Sahl stated he found his military experience a good one, that he described as &quot;spiritual&quot;.

Sahl was discharged in 1947 and enrolled in Compton College, followed by the University of Southern California. He received a B.S. degree in 1950 with majors in traffic engineering and city management. He continued with a masters program, but dropped out to become an actor and playwright.

==Career==
===Breaking into comedy===
Between 1950 and 1953 Sahl attempted to get jobs as a stand-up comedian in about 30 nightclubs in Los Angeles, but with no success. NBC, where he auditioned, told him he would never succeed as a comedian. He offered to perform free during intermissions for the chance to show his talent. He recalled of that period: &quot;Despite all the folklore about the faith of friends in the struggling young artist, my friends constantly discouraged me.&quot; He and a friend then rented an old theater, which they called Theater X, for &quot;experimental,&quot; and he began writing and staging one-act plays. One of his plays was titled &quot;Nobody Trusted the Truth&quot;. Unable to attract a large enough audience, they eventually closed the theater.

For income, Sahl began doing odd jobs and writing. He worked as a used car salesman and a messenger, and wrote a novel, which went unpublished, and short stories. He went to New York hoping to sell his plays, but only managed to earn about eighteen dollars a week. He recalled ... &quot;I couldn&#x27;t get a thing going. I was working on a novel, I was out of work, and I was out of gas.&quot; As a result, he decided to try something different, by performing his plays as monologues. He felt it would be easier to do his monologue on stage instead of trying to sell it to others. &quot;I knew that if I was going to get anything done, I&#x27;d have to do it myself,&quot; he says. He returned to Los Angeles, where he appeared at some clubs, but his new style of monologue comedy received little attention.

In 1953 he began dating Sue Babior. When she moved to Berkeley to study at the University of California, Sahl hitchhiked there to be with her. He spent his time auditing classes and hanging out at local coffee houses. For income, he wrote for a few &quot;avant-garde&quot; publications. He slept in the back seat of a friend&#x27;s car; Babior was living with roommates. &quot;Things were simple then,&quot; he said. &quot;... All we had to worry about was the destiny of man.&quot; He felt at home in the San Francisco Bay Area, commenting, &quot;I was &#x27;born&#x27; in San Francisco.&quot; He stated that the three years he lived in Berkeley were a valuable experience.

Sahl sought clubs where he could perform stand-up, and Babior suggested he audition for the hungry i, a nightclub in San Francisco. Its owner, Enrico Banducci, took an immediate liking to Sahl&#x27;s comedy style and offered him a job at $75 a week (about $720 in 2020 money), which became his first steady job as a stand-up comedian.

Word about Sahl&#x27;s satirical comedy act spread quickly. He received good reviews from influential newspaper columnist Herb Caen. The reviews gave Sahl instant credibility: &quot;I don&#x27;t know where Mr. Sahl came from, but I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s here,&quot; Caen wrote after watching the show. Caen began inviting his own friends, such as film comedians Danny Kaye and Eddie Cantor, to watch Sahl&#x27;s performances. Cantor took him &quot;under his wing&quot; and gave him suggestions.By the end of Sahl&#x27;s first year at the hungry i, he was earning $3,000 a week (about $29,000 a week in 2020 money) and performing to full houses. Later in his career, he said, &quot;I&#x27;d be washing cars if it weren&#x27;t for Enrico.&quot;

===Nightclub shows and national acclaim===
After a year at the hungry i, Sahl began appearing at other clubs, including the Black Orchid and Mister Kelly&#x27;s in Chicago, the Crescendo in Los Angeles, and the Village Vanguard and The Blue Angel nightclub in New York City. Some of the clubs had never had a stand-up comedian; Sahl had to break in as a new kind of act. &quot;I had to build up my own network of places to play,&quot; he said.

Celebrities saw his shows after they heard about the &quot;new phenomenon,&quot; referring to Sahl&#x27;s unique style of comedy. Woody Allen, who saw his show at the Blue Angel in 1954, commented that &quot;he was suddenly this great genius that appeared who revolutionized the medium.&quot; British comedy actor John Cleese became immediately interested in Sahl&#x27;s radical style of humor and accorded to Sahl the same level of respect that The Beatles reserved for Elvis Presley.
Television host Steve Allen, who originated the &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, said he was &quot;struck by how amateur he seemed,&quot; but added that the observation was not meant as a criticism, but as a &quot;compliment&quot;. He noted that all the previous successful comics dressed formally, were glib and well-rehearsed, and were always in control of their audiences. Allen said that Sahl&#x27;s &quot;very un-show business manner was one of the things I liked when I first saw him work.&quot;

Sahl dressed casually, with no tie and usually wearing his trademark V-neck campus-style sweater. His stage presence was seen as being &quot;candid and cool, the antithesis of the slick comic,&quot; stated theater critic Gerald Nachman. And although Sahl acquired a reputation for being an intellectual comedian, it was an image he disliked and disagreed with: &quot;It was absurd. I was barely a C student,&quot; he said. His naturalness on stage was partly due to his preferring improvisation over carefully rehearsed monologues. Sahl explained:

His casual style of stand-up, where he seemed to be one-on-one with his audience, influenced new comedians, including Lenny Bruce and Dick Gregory. Sahl was the least controversial, however, because he dressed and looked &quot;collegiate&quot; and focused on politics, while Bruce confronted sexual and language conventions and Gregory focused on the civil rights movement. After seeing Mort Sahl on stage, Woody Allen, whose writings were often about his personal life, decided to give it a try: &quot;I&#x27;d never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.&quot;

Commenting on Sahl&#x27;s monologues, Nachman described him as a &quot;gifted narrator, so good at taking you along on his travels that you didn&#x27;t quite realize until the show was over that you had been on a labyrinthine journey.&quot; The speed with which Sahl gave his monologues was also notable. British film critic Penelope Gilliatt recalled how Sahl&#x27;s improvisation &quot;goes on a breakneck stammering loop and you think it will never make the circle. It always does.&quot; For her it was like watching a circus act: &quot;He freewheels a bike on a high wire tightrope with his brain racing and his hands off the handlebars.&quot;

Sahl&#x27;s popularity &quot;mushroomed like an Atomic cloud during the 50s,&quot; says filmmaker Robert B. Weide, adding, &quot;Simply put, Mort Sahl reinvented stand-up comedy.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1960 published a cover story about him and his rise to fame, in which they described him as &quot;the best of the New Comedians [and] the first notable American political satirist since Will Rogers.&quot; Along with his nightclub performances, he appeared in some films and on television shows, including his network debut on &quot;The NBC Comedy Hour&quot; in May 1956. He was one of the interim hosts on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; following Jack Paar&#x27;s departure as the network waited for Johnny Carson to become available.

His audience had also widened to include not only students and a &quot;hip&quot; public, but now even noted politicians sought out his shows. Some became friends, such as presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, who asked him to prepare a bank of political jokes he could use at public functions. Kennedy liked his style of political satire and what he described as Sahl&#x27;s &quot;relentless pursuit of everybody.&quot; Adlai Stevenson and Hubert Humphrey were fans, Humphrey stating that &quot;whenever there is a political bloat, Mort sticks a pin in it.&quot; Sahl considered Ronald Reagan one of his closest friends.

They valued the fact that he stayed current and took material from major newspapers and magazines. He kept his material fresh, wrote few notes, and entertained his audiences by presenting otherwise serious news with his brand of humor. He was not fond of television news, however, which he blamed in 1960 for &quot;spoon-feeding&quot; the public, and was therefore responsible for the &quot;corruption and ignorance that may sink this country.&quot;

As a result of Sahl&#x27;s popularity, besides getting on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;, he also became the first comedian to make a record album, the first to do college concerts, and was the first comedian to win a Grammy.

===Declining career in 1960s===
Once Kennedy was in office, Sahl returned to his policy of making jokes about the incumbent with Sahl saying, “If you were the only person left on the planet, I would have to attack you&quot;. JFK&#x27;s father Joseph Kennedy made a few calls, Sahl’s club bookings began to dry up. One morning, Banducci went to the Hungry i who were still booking Sahl and found the doors chained and padlocked by the IRS in demand of back taxes
“My so-called liberal supporters have all moved in with the establishment,” he said from the stage at one preview. “The same people who like jokes about John Foster Dulles and Goldwater suddenly freeze when they hear satirical humor about Vietnam or the war on poverty. That’s my job”.

Following Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in 1963, Sahl&#x27;s interest in who was responsible was so great that he became a deputized member of District Attorney of New Orleans Jim Garrison&#x27;s team to investigate the assassination and in 1968 used his influence to get Garrison a spot on The Tonight Show hosted by Johnny Carson. As a result, Sahl&#x27;s comedy would often reflect his politics and included readings and commentary about the Warren Commission Report, of which he consistently disputed the accuracy. He alienated much of his audience, was effectively blacklisted, and more of his planned shows were cancelled. His income dropped from $1 million to $13,000 by 1964. According to Nachman, the extensive focus on the Kennedy assassination details was Sahl&#x27;s undoing and wrecked his career. Sahl later admitted that &quot;there&#x27;s never been anything that had a stronger impact on my life than this issue,&quot; but added that he nonetheless &quot;thought it was a wonderful quest.&quot;
===Partial comeback===
By the 1970s, the rising tide of counterculture eventually fueled Sahl&#x27;s partial comeback as a veteran comedian, and he was included with the new comedians breaking into the field, such as George Carlin, Lily Tomlin, and Richard Pryor. In the 1980s he headlined for Banducci&#x27;s new clubs in San Francisco. In the late 1980s he was trying to write screenplays, besides doing sporadic shows around the country. In 1987 he had a successful multiweek run in Australia.

In 1988 Sahl was back in New York City and performed a one-man Off-Broadway show, &quot;Mort Sahl&#x27;s America&quot;, which, despite getting good reviews from critics, was not a box office success. The &quot;New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;History has returned Mort Sahl to the spotlight when he is most needed. His style has an intuitive spontaneity. His presence is tonic.&quot; Robert Weide produced a biographical documentary, &quot;Mort Sahl: The Loyal Opposition&quot;, which ran on PBS in 1989.

Sahl found his previous level of success increasingly difficult to recapture.. One &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic wrote, &quot;Sahl is a man with a country but not a stage.&quot; A number of television specials gave him a venue to perform in front of live audiences. Beginning in November 1991, the Monitor Channel broadcast a series of eight shows called &quot;Mort Sahl Live&quot; .

From the 1990s on he performed, but less often and mostly in theaters and college auditoriums. When Woody Allen saw him perform in 2001 at one of his rare New York club appearances, Allen told him, &quot;this is crazyyou should be working all the time.&quot; Allen then called his manager Jack Rollins: &quot;Listen, this guy is hilarious. We gotta bring him to New York.&quot; Sahl then did shows at Joe&#x27;s Pub in Manhattan to standing-room only audiences.

In 2008, Sahl performed at B.B. King&#x27;s Blues Club &amp; Grill on 42nd Street with Woody Allen, Elaine May, and Dick Cavett in attendance.

Sahl was ranked #40 on Comedy Central&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time, ranked between Billy Crystal and Jon Stewart. In 2003 he received the Fifth Annual Alan King Award in American Jewish Humor from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture. In 2011, the Library of Congress placed his 1955 recording, &quot;At Sunset&quot;, on the National Recording Registry.

===Satire comedy style===
Sahl&#x27;s humor was based on current events, especially politics, which led Milton Berle to describe him as &quot;one of the greatest political satirists of all time.&quot; His trademark persona was to enter the stage with a newspaper in hand, casually dressed in a V-neck sweater. He would often recite some news stories combined with satire. He was dubbed &quot;Will Rogers with fangs&quot; by Time magazine in 1960.

Sahl would discuss people or events almost as if he were reporting them for the first time, and would digress into related stories or his own experiences. TV executive Roger Ailes said he saw him read the paper one day and after a few hours Sahl got up onstage with an entire evening&#x27;s worth of new material. &quot;With no writers, he just did what he had seen in the afternoon paper. He was a genius.&quot;

Sahl&#x27;s presentation of news commentary as a form of social satire created a wide assortment of celebrity and political fans, including Adlai Stevenson, Marlene Dietrich, S.J. Perelman, Saul Bellow, and Leonard Bernstein. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. said his popularity was due to the public&#x27;s &quot;yearning for youth, irreverence, trenchancy, satire, [and] a clean break with the past.&quot; And Steve Allen introduced him on one of his shows as being &quot;the only real political philosopher we have in modern comedy.&quot;

Combined with his improvisational skill, Sahl&#x27;s naturalness was also considered unique for a stage performer. Woody Allen notes that other comics were jealous of Sahl&#x27;s stage persona and did not understand how he could perform by simply talking to the audience. Nachman stated that the &quot;mere idea of a stand-up comic talking about the real world was in itself revolutionary ... [and] the comedians who followed himLenny Bruce, Woody Allen, Dick Gregory, Phyllis Diller, Shelley Berman, Jonathan Winterswere cast in a familiar nightclub mold.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In the September 28, 1960 &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip, Schroeder is reading aloud to Lucy from a biography on his all-time favorite composer, Ludwig van Beethoven where he describes his idol as someone who &quot;would sometimes startle people in public places,&quot; then at times &quot;flew out in anger against all that was petty, dull, or greedy in men., [and] Often, however, his scorn would turn to high hilarity and humorous jests.&quot; Lucy then asks, &quot;Are you reading about Beethoven or Mort Sahl?&quot;

==Personal life==
Sahl was married three times. He wedded Sue Babior in 1955; the marriage ended in divorce less than three years later. In the early 1960s his steady girlfriend was Tippi Hedren. Sahl also dated Dyan Cannon and Julie Newmar.

In 1967, he married actress and model China Lee and they divorced in 1991. They had one son, Mort Sahl Jr., who died in 1996, aged 19, from an unknown drug-related reaction.

In 1997, he married Kenslea Ann Motter; they divorced around 2009. He regretted the end of their marriage and said &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I divorced Kenslea; I&#x27;m still in love with my wife. If you love a woman it&#x27;ll make her a better woman.&quot;

In 1976, Sahl wrote an autobiography called &quot;Heartland&quot;.

In June 2007, a number of star comedians, including George Carlin and Jonathan Winters, gave Sahl an 80th birthday tribute.

In 2008, Sahl moved from Los Angeles to Mill Valley, California, a suburb of San Francisco, where he became friends with comedian Robin Williams, who lived nearby.

Until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Sahl worked every Thursday night at the Throckmorton Theater in Mill Valley, California taking questions from a live audience and from Periscope/Twitter.

Sahl died of natural causes at his home in Mill Valley on October 26, 2021, at age 94.

<doc id="599359" wikidata="Q154615" url="?curid=599359" title="Archduke">
<text>Archduke (feminine: Archduchess; German: &quot;Erzherzog&quot;, feminine form: &quot;Erzherzogin&quot;) was the title borne from 1358 by the Habsburg rulers of the Archduchy of Austria, and later by all senior members of that dynasty. It denotes a rank within the former Holy Roman Empire (962–1806), which was below that of Emperor, and roughly equal to King, Prince-Archbishop, and Grand prince, but above that of a Grand Duke, Sovereign Prince, and Duke.

The territory ruled by an archduke or archduchess was called an archduchy. All remaining archduchies ceased to exist in 1918. The current head of the House of Habsburg is Karl Habsburg.

==Terminology==
The English word is first recorded in 1530, derived from Middle French &#x27;, a 15th-century derivation from Medieval Latin &#x27;, from Latin &quot;-&quot; (Greek ) meaning &quot;authority&quot; or &quot;primary&quot; (see &quot;&quot;) and &quot;&quot; &quot;duke&quot; (literally &quot;leader&quot;).

&quot;Archduke&quot; (; ) is a title distinct from &quot;Grand Duke&quot; (; ; ; ), a later monarchic title borne by the rulers of other European countries (for instance, Luxembourg).

==History==
The Latin title &quot;archidux&quot; is first attested in reference to Bruno the Great, who ruled simultaneously as Archbishop of Cologne and Duke of Lotharingia in the 10th century, in the work of his biographer Ruotger of Cologne. In Ruotger, the title served as an honorific denoting Bruno&#x27;s unusual position rather than a formal office.

The title was not used systematically until the 14th century, when the title &quot;Archduke of Austria&quot; was invented in the forged &quot;Privilegium Maius&quot; (1358–1359) by Duke Rudolf IV of Austria, called Rudolf the Founder (German: Rudolf der Stifter). Rudolf originally claimed the title in the form &quot;palatinus archidux&quot; (&quot;palatine archduke&quot;). The title was intended to emphasize the claimed precedence (thus &quot;Arch-&quot;) of the Duchy of Austria, in an effort to put the Habsburgs on an even level with the Prince-Electors of the Holy Roman Empire, as Austria had been passed over when the Golden Bull of 1356 assigned that dignity to the four highest-ranking secular Imperial princes and three Archbishops. Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV refused to recognise the title, as did all the other ruling dynasties of the member countries of the Empire. But Duke Ernest the Iron and his descendants unilaterally assumed the title of &quot;Archduke&quot;.

The archducal title was only officially recognized in 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, when the Habsburgs had solidified their grip on the throne of the &quot;de jure&quot; elected Holy Roman Emperor, making it &quot;de facto&quot; hereditary. Despite that imperial authorization of the title, which showed a Holy Roman Emperor from the Habsburg dynasty deciding over a title claim of the Habsburg dynasty, many ruling dynasties of the countries which formed the Empire refused to recognize the title &quot;Archduke&quot;. Ladislaus the Posthumous, Duke of Austria, who died in 1457, never got in his lifetime the imperial authorization to use it, and accordingly, neither he nor anyone in his branch of the dynasty ever used the title. Emperor Frederick III himself simply used the title &quot;Duke of Austria&quot;, never &quot;Archduke&quot;, until his death in 1493. The title was first granted to Frederick&#x27;s younger brother, Albert VI of Austria (d. 1463), who used it at least from 1458.

In 1477, Frederick III also granted the title of &quot;Archduke&quot; to his first cousin, Sigismund of Austria, ruler of Further Austria (). Frederick&#x27;s son and heir, the future Emperor Maximilian I, started to use the title, but apparently only after the death of his wife Mary of Burgundy (d. 1482), as &quot;Archduke&quot; never appears in documents issued jointly by Maximilian and Mary as rulers in the Low Countries (where Maximilian is still titled &quot;Duke of Austria&quot;). The title appears first in documents issued under the joint rule of Maximilian and his son Philip in the Low Countries.

&quot;Archduke&quot; was initially borne by those dynasts who ruled a Habsburg territory—i.e., only by males and their consorts, appanages being commonly distributed to cadets. But these &quot;junior&quot; &quot;archdukes&quot; did not thereby become sovereign hereditary rulers, since all territories remained vested in the Austrian crown. Occasionally a territory might be combined with a separate gubernatorial mandate ruled by an archducal cadet.

==Usage==
From the 16th century onward, &quot;Archduke&quot; and its female form, &quot;Archduchess&quot;, came to be used by &quot;all&quot; the members of the House of Habsburg (e.g. Queen Marie Antoinette of France was born Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria). Upon extinction of the male line of the Habsburgs and the marriage of their heiress, the Holy Roman Empress-consort Maria Theresa, Queen of Hungary and Archduchess of Austria, to Francis Stephen, Duke of Lorraine, who was elected Holy Roman Emperor, their descendants formed the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire this usage was retained in the Austrian Empire (1804–1867) and the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1867–1918).

The official use of titles of nobility and of all other hereditary titles, including &quot;Archduke&quot;, has been illegal in the Republic of Austria for Austrian citizens since the Law on the Abolition of Nobility (&quot;Gesetz vom 3. April 1919 über die Aufhebung des Adels, der weltlichen Ritter- und Damenorden und gewisser Titel und Würden&quot;). Thus those members of the Habsburg family who are residents of the Republic of Austria are simply known by their first name(s) and their surname &quot;Habsburg-Lothringen&quot;. However, members of the family who reside in other countries may or may not use the title, in accordance with laws and customs in those nations.

For example, Otto Habsburg-Lothringen (1912–2011), the eldest son of the last Habsburg Emperor, was an Austrian, Hungarian and German citizen. As he lived in Germany, where it is permitted to use hereditary titles as part of the civil surname (including indications of origin, such as &quot;von&quot; or &quot;zu&quot;), his official civil name was Otto von Habsburg (literally: Otto &quot;of&quot; Habsburg), whereas in Austria he was registered as Otto Habsburg.

The King of Spain also bears the nominal title of Archduke of Austria as part of his full list of titles, as the Bourbon dynasty adopted all the titles previously held by the Spanish Habsburgs when they took over the Spanish throne. However, &quot;Archduke&quot; was never considered by the Spanish Bourbons as a substantial dignity of their own dynasty, but rather as a traditional supplementary title of the Spanish Kings since the days of the Habsburg dynasty on the royal throne (1516–1700). Hence, no member of the royal family other than the King bears the (additional) title of &quot;Archduke&quot;.

== Insignia ==
The insignia of the Archduke of Lower and Upper Austria was the archducal hat, a coronet which is kept in Klosterneuburg Monastery.

<text>The Paatsjoki River (, , , , , , &quot;Paz or Patsoyoki&quot;) is a river that flows through Finland, Norway, and Russia. 
Since 1826, the river has marked parts of the Norway–Russia border, except from 1920 to 1944 when it was along the Finland–Norway border.

The river is the outlet from the large Lake Inari in Finland and flows through Norway and Russia to discharge into the Bøkfjorden (which later flows into the Varangerfjorden and then the Barents Sea), not far from the town of Kirkenes. The river has a watershed of , and is long. A series of hydroelectric stations, known as the Paatsjoki River Hydroelectric Plants, are along the river. Five of those seven power stations, are Russian.

The river provides good fishing opportunities for Atlantic salmon, although fishermen must ensure that their fishing lines do not cross the international border.

<text>This is a list of places which are named or renamed after Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known by his alias [[Lenin]]. Some or all of the locations in former Soviet republics and satellites were renamed (frequently reverting to pre-Soviet names) after the fall of the Soviet Union, while Russia and aligned countries (mainly Belarus) retained the names of the thousands of streets, avenues, squares, regions, towns, and cities that were given Lenin&#x27;s name as part of his cult of personality.

==Streets and squares==
Almost every town in the Soviet Union had a street named after Lenin. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, some of streets and squares (primarily outside of Russia and Belarus) reverted to their former names or were given new ones. In Russia, there are still 5,000 streets named after Lenin. This concerns also the names of city districts. Listed below are some of the streets named after Lenin, with an emphasis on those outside of the former USSR or its Eastern Bloc.

On 15 May 2015 President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a bill into law that started a six months period for the removal of communist monuments and the mandatory renaming of settlements and (the many) streets and squares with names related to the communist regime. Places in Crimea, the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic, and Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic were not practically affected by this law due to their occupation by Russia.
