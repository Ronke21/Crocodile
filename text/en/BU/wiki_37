<text>Hucknall Town Football Club is a football club based in the town of Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, England. The club is a member of the and plays at the RM Stadium.

==History==
Hucknall Town were renamed from Hucknall Colliery Welfare in 1987 and for the next two seasons finished first in the Notts Alliance. They moved into the Central Midlands League where they finished first in both 1989–90 and 1990–91 and runners up in 1991–92 to Lincoln United. The league cup was also won in all three seasons with the losing finalists being the now defunct Crookes, Nottingham neighbours Arnold Town and Nettleham.

Hucknall Town were promoted to the Northern Counties East League Division One and then to the Premier Division where they struggled in the Premier Division until 1996–97, when they recovered from a poor start to finish sixth. However, the League Cup and President&#x27;s Cup made their way to Watnall Road with Hucknall beating Pontefract Colleries and Belper Town in the respective finals. It was the second time they had won the League Cup, having beaten Thackley in 1994.

In 1997–98, they won the Northern Counties East League and retained the league cup with North Ferriby United finishing second in both competitions. The following season came as a major surprise as Hucknall finished second in the Division One, behind Droylsden. The title would have been won but for an early season points deduction.

From 1999 to 2004 they played in the Northern Premier League Premier Division, winning the championship in the 2003–04 season. However, as their Watnall Road ground did not meet the standards of the Football Conference they were refused promotion to the Conference National division and had to settle for a place in the new Conference North.

They were due to be relegated from the Conference North to the Northern Premier League Premier Division following the 2007–08 season. This would have been the first relegation from any league in the club&#x27;s history. However, Halifax Town&#x27;s financial woes meant that they were reprieved. The club were eventually relegated at the end of the 2008–09 season.

Relegation following the 2010–2011 season saw them drop into the Division One South and further financial woes lead to them relegated again, three levels in 2012–13 to Central Midlands League South Division.
In the 2014–15 season Hucknall Town finished 4th in the Central Midlands League and won the Central Midlands League Cup, beating Clifton All Whites 3–0 at Alfreton Town&#x27;s North Street ground.

Hucknall Town became Central Midlands League South divisional champions in the 2018–19 season.

Following the 2022–2023 season, with Andy Ingle as the first team manager, Hucknall Town were promoted from the United Counties following two penalty shoot-out wins during the end of season promotion play-offs. The semi-final was against Bourne Town and the final against Birstall United

==Stadium==
The club played at the Watnall Road ground, which has a 5,000 capacity with 270 seats with the development side. Hucknall Town Sunday and the Vet&#x27;s team also played home fixtures at Watnall Road on the training pitch.

In May 2008, Worksop Town of the Northern Premier League became Hucknall&#x27;s tenants, although the agreement was not renewed after the 2008–09 season.

In May 2015, it was announced that work had started on a new stadium. The club had hoped to move into the new stadium just off Aerial Way (across the road from the current stadium) for the 2017–18 season. Their final games were both 2–0 defeats, the last league game was against Aylestone Park, 806 fans attended the match, then 4 days later on 19 October 2022, 290 fans watched the yellows play at Watnall Road for one final time, against Basford United in the Nottinghamshire Senior Cup.
Hucknall Town finally moved to their new stadium off Aerial Way, called RM Stadium (sponsored by RM Resources) and was opened by Nigel Clough, The Yellows won their first game 3-2 vs Harrowby United on 7 January 2023 in front of 392 fans.

==First Team squad==



 







==Managers==
The manager from 1995 to 2001 as Town rose from the Northern Counties East League to the Northern Premier League Premier Division was Geordie John Ramshaw. He was followed by Phil Starbuck and then Steve Burr. Former Leek Town and Gainsborough Trinity boss Ernie Moss was manager for a short spell during the first part of the 2004–05 season.

Former Bury player Dean Barrick was player-manager until January 2006. Dean Barrick was popular amongst the club&#x27;s fans, and was voted BBC Radio Nottingham Sports Personality of the year in 2005 having led the club to the FA Trophy final.

Barrick was replaced in February 2006 by Kevin Wilson, the former Northampton Town and Kettering Town manager.

In January 2007, Wilson was sacked as manager, and former Welsh international player Andy Legg was appointed as the new player-manager. Legg remained as manager until September 2007, when he resigned following six consecutive defeats at the start of the season. David Lloyd replaced Legg, but having failed to avoid a relegation position was sacked before the final game of the 2007–08 season and replaced by Mick Galloway and Andy Miller.
In November 2008 former Eastwood Town manager Brian Chambers was appointed as Director of Football. Galloway and Miller were appointed as coaches. However, the clubs stated that he was to work with Galloway, rather than replace him. Although after a further defeat against King&#x27;s Lynn, Galloway and Miller were dismissed and replaced by Chambers Chambers resigned as manager in January 2010

In May 2022 Andy Graves the clubs longest serving manager resigned following defeat in United Counties Division One play off semi-final against Hinckley A.F.C. 

Former reserve team manager Andy Ingle took over first-team affairs with former player Michael Banister taking up the role of assistant manager, with the help of Darren Jubb the trio achieved promotion via a 3-5 penalty shoot out win, in the play-off final against Birstall United.

Hucknall struggled after the promotion, on 8 September assistant manager Micheal Banister stepped down as he felt that he could no longer commit the enormous amount of time that is required for the role of Assistant Manager going forward and then almost a week later on the 14th, manager Andy Igles also stepped down due to the significant demands of the role, Andy was no longer able to commit the time needed to address the current and ongoing challenges of step 5 football. Phil Henry and Darren Jubb took charge of a couple of games before Hucknall appointed joint managers Reece Limbert &amp; Louis Bland on 3 October. The joint appointment was short-lived as Louis Bland received an offer from step 4 club Grantham Town in the capacity of First Team Manager on a full-time basis. Reece Limbert took full charge of the first team. Limbert resigned after 12 months with the club after Town&#x27;s 4-1 defeat to Heanor Town.

Town appointed former yellows player Tris Whitman as their new manager, with Aaron Large as his assistant, both came from a successful time at Stapleford Town.

<doc id="595238" wikidata="Q1378584" url="?curid=595238" title="Byeonhan confederacy">
<text>Byeonhan (, ), also known as Byeonjin, (, ) was a loose confederacy of chiefdoms that existed from around the beginning of the Common Era to the 4th century in the southern Korean peninsula. Byeonhan was one of the Samhan (or &quot;Three Hans&quot;), along with Mahan and Jinhan.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Byeonhan (弁韓)&quot; is believed to be a combination of Old Korean words. &quot;Byeon (변)&quot; in native Korean meant &quot;Shiny/Shimmering&quot; while &quot;Han (한)&quot; meant &quot;big&quot;, giving the meaning of Byeonhan, the &quot;Big Nation of Shimmering&quot;.

As part of the Samhan, Jinhan meant &quot;Big Nation of the East&quot; and Mahan meant &quot;Big Nation of the South&quot;.

== History ==
This early part of the Three Kingdoms period is sometimes called the Proto–Three Kingdoms period. Byeonhan, like the other Samhan confederacies, appears to be descended from the Jin state of southern Korea.

Archaeological evidence indicates an increase in military activity and weapons production among the Byeonhan in the 3rd century, especially an increase in iron arrowheads and cuirasses (Barnes 2000). This may be associated with the decline of Byeonhan and the rise of the more centralized Gaya Confederacy, which most Byeonhan states joined. Gaya was subsequently annexed by Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

Various cultural aspects supposedly unique to Byeonhan overlap with Jinhan, but are not universal in Byeonhan. One notable tradition was tattooing, which was done by both men and women. Another tradition was the burying of feathers and pottery in graves alongside the dead body as it was believed that the feathers helped the afterlife souls fly into the sky.

Byeonhan as a political grouping was also sometimes referred to by a calque of &quot;Byeon&quot; () and &quot;Jin&quot; () as Byeonjin with the ethnonym &quot;Han&quot; () being used by its inhabitants, identical to that of its neighbours.

There are also two hypotheses about the Byeonhan constituting a separate ethnicity distinct from the Jinhan:

# The Wa people of the Japanese archipelago, described in early Chinese records as present on the southern coasts of the peninsula.
# Any ethnic who traveled through ancient southern trade routes seen through the distribution of dolmens culture. According to recent studies that excavated Kofuns in South Jeolla Province, analysis of the components of glass beads there suggests that the raw material production area is Thailand.
However, there is no distinct evidence that indicates an ethnic separation of Byeonhan and Jinhan as the two shared essentially the same culture, with varying religious customs, and apparently were not separated by a clear boundary according to the contemporary Chinese chronicle &quot;San Guo Zhi&quot;.

==Culture and language==
The &quot;Dongyi&quot; (&quot;Eastern Barbarian&quot;) in the &quot;Wei Shu&quot; section of the Chinese &quot;Sanguo Zhi&quot; states that the culture of Byeonhan was similar to that of Jinhan (言語法俗相似) and that their populations lived &quot;intermingled together&quot; (弁辰與辰韓雑居), while having similar language and customs.

The fifth century &quot;Hou Han Shu&quot; however notes on differences in their language and customs as “languages and customs have differences” (言語風俗有異), after stating that their enclosed settlements and clothing are the same.

Furthermore, the &quot;Wei shu&quot; states that “Chinhan men and women are close to Wa (男女近倭),” the ethnonym for the contemporary inhabitants of the Japanese archipelago, and like the Wa tattoo their bodies. The &quot;Hou Han shu&quot; however identifies this with Byeonhan, stating that “their country is close to Wa, therefore they frequently have tattoos.”

The linguist John Whitman summarizes the situation as such:

In fact, the texts indicate a more complex (and plausible) interrelationship between language, ethnicity, and protopolitical grouping. [...] The Chinhan population lives intermixed with Pyŏnhan; the Chinese reporters struggle to describe the resultant demographic complexity. Their languages may be similar, or different; some resemble the Wa, some tattoo their bodies. While Wa-like toponyms are more frequent in the Pyŏnhan grouping, one such toponym is identified with Chinhan. This is exactly the kind of complexity we might expect to be associated with the situation described by Ahn, where a population associated with Mumun wet rice growing culture lives alongside more recently arrived members of the Korean-style bronze dagger culture.

==Politics and trade==
Byeonhan may have simply been a political description for decentralized polities south and west of the Nakdong River valley that were not formal members of the Jinhan confederacy.

Byeonhan was internationally known for its production of iron, which was also its main export good to the Lelang Commandery to the northwest, the Japanese archipelago, and the rest of the Korean peninsula. It was also a center of stoneware manufacture.

==Member statelets==
According to the &quot;Records of Three Kingdoms&quot;, Byeonhan consisted of 12 statelets:

* Mirimidong (), present-day Miryang.
* Jeopdo (), present-day Haman.
* Gojamidong (), present-day Goseong.
* Gosunsi (), present-day Jinju, Sacheon or Goseong.
* Ballo (), present-day Seongju.
* Nangno (), present-day Hadong or Namhae.
* Gunmi (), present-day Sacheon.
* Mioyama (), present-day Changwon.
* Gamno (), present-day Gimcheon.
* Guya (), present-day Gimhae.
* Jujoma (), present-day Gimcheon.
* Anya (), present-day Haman.
* Dongno (), present-day Dongnae.

<doc id="595240" wikidata="Q7621767" url="?curid=595240" title="Strategic Army Corps">
<text>The Strategic Army Corps (STRAC) was a command of the United States Army, with a mission of high readiness, active in the 1960s. In 1961 it was merged into the United States Strike Command (STRICOM). The word &quot;STRAC&quot; was also used to describe a well organized, well turned-out soldier or unit.

==Background==
STRAC was a designation given to the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in 1958. The designation was, in reality, the assignment of an additional mission rather than a true designation. The additional mission was to provide a flexible strike capability that could deploy worldwide on short notice without declaration of an emergency. The 4th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington, 
Combat Command A of the 1st Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas, and the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, were designated as STRAC&#x27;s first-line divisions, while the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas, and the 82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg were to provide backup in the event of general war. The 5th Logistical Command (later reflagged as 1st Logistical Command), also at Fort Bragg, would provide the corps with logistics support, while Fort Bragg&#x27;s XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery would control artillery units.

Airlift assets were made available to U.S. forces based on the possible outbreak of a general war in Europe. In his paper, &quot;Not War But Like War: The American Intervention in Lebanon&quot;, prepared for the Army Command and General Staff College&#x27;s Combat Studies Institute, Roger J. Spiller notes:

==Operations==
Training included unidentified semi-annual maneuvers (Desert Strike, Swift Strike) with the 82nd and 101st Airborne held under the auspices of the XVIII and STRAC.

The 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment returned to the United States from Germany in February 1958, and was once again stationed at Fort Meade. The regiment became part of STRAC and, from 1958 to 1961, it was the recipient of four STRAC streamers, awarded for superior readiness and training. In reaction to the Berlin Crisis, the regiment redeployed to Germany in October 1961. Alerted for movement on 10 October, although scattered at different training sites along the Eastern Seaboard, the regiment arrived at its new duty stations of Baumholder and Kaiserslautern exactly thirty days later.

STRAC and the XVIII Airborne Corps provided the Army forces to the Navy&#x27;s CINCLANT as unified commander during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

==Flexible response==
In September 1961, Fort Hood again became the home for the III Corps, and in February 1962, III Corps was assigned as part of the STRAC.

In March 1962 the 2nd Infantry Division was designated as a Strategic Army Corps (STRAC) unit. Following this the Division became engaged in intensified combat training, tactical training, and field training exercises, in addition to special training designed to improve operational readiness.

==Limitations==
Although the STRAC mission was to provide an easily deployable force for use in a limited war or other emergency, its ability to deploy overseas was limited by airlift constraints. Without the declaration of a national emergency, the required lift assets would not be released to support a STRAC deployment.

The Army faced problems with both the Air Force who would provide the expected transportation and from foreign governments for the expected use of their airspace and airports.

==Other definitions==
STRAC is Army slang term for &quot;a well organized, squared away soldier, (starched uniform, polished brass and spit-shined boots)&quot;—a proud, competent trooper who can be depended on for good performance in any circumstance. The word was used both as a noun and an adjective for a soldier whose gear was clean and tight; weapon clean and ready; mind clear, organized, and ready for action. S: skilled T: tough R: ready A: around the C: clock—STRAC. Another version defined the acronym as &quot;Sharp Trooper, Ready Around the Clock&quot;.
However, some soldiers joked it stood for &quot;Shit! The Russians Are Coming!&quot;

<text>Alfred Maseng Nalo (10 January 1949 – 18 November 2004) was a Vanuatuan politician. He served as speaker of the Parliament from December 1991 to November 1995, and foreign minister from 1995 until 1996. He was also the president of Vanuatu for two brief periods lasting about a month each, during 1994 and 2004.

== Biography ==
Maseng had been acting president of Vanuatu from 30 January to 2 March 1994, while he was speaker of parliament and an acting president was needed in the interval between the expiry of a president&#x27;s term and the next presidential election. In the 2004 presidential elections, Maseng was one of 32 candidates, and a two-thirds majority in parliament was needed to win. Balloting started on 8 April, but this session and another session on 10 April failed to result in the required majority for any candidate. In the fourth round of balloting on 12 April (Easter Monday), Maseng defeated the government&#x27;s candidate, Kalkot Mataskelekele, by a vote of 41 to 16, and was sworn in immediately. He was removed as president on 11 May 2004, by the Supreme Court, which ruled that the election was invalid because of a rule banning people with criminal records from being elected. It had been revealed that he was serving a suspended sentence on corruption charges, including receiving stolen goods.

He was a member of the conservative Francophone Union of Moderate Parties. He died at a hospital in northern Vanuatu several months after his removal from the presidency. His age and cause of death have not been reported.

<doc id="595249" wikidata="Q5289654" url="?curid=595249" title="Dolphin Square">
<text>Dolphin Square is an estate of private flats with some ground floor business units near the River Thames in Pimlico, Westminster, London built between 1935 and 1937. Until the building of Highbury Square, it was the most developed garden square in London built as private housing. At one time, it was home to more than 70 MPs and at least 10 Lords.

At the time of its construction, its 1,250 upmarket flats were billed by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as the &quot;largest self-contained block of flats in Europe&quot;. To an extent, their design has been a model for later municipal developments.

==History==

Dolphin Square is on the site of the former works of the developer and builder Thomas Cubitt who created the surrounding Pimlico district in the 19th century. The Royal Army Clothing Depot was built on the site after Cubitt&#x27;s death and stood until 1933 when the leasehold on the site reverted to the Duke of Westminster. An American firm, the Fred F. French Companies, bought the freehold for the site from the Duke with plans to build a large residential development, provisionally named Ormonde Court. Although the planning stage was successfully concluded with the LCC by January 1935, French still needed financial backing for the enterprise. At the same time, he had over-extended his credit during his recent developments in New York City such as Tudor City and Knickerbocker Village and found himself unable to repay interest on earlier deals. Needing a new backer, French sold his obligations to Richard Costain Ltd., run by Richard Rylands Costain. New plans were drawn up by the architect S. Gordon Jeeves, and building started in September 1935. Lord Amulree formally opened the building on 25 November 1936.

A. P. Herbert, writing in &quot;Dolphin Square&quot; (a promotional booklet produced for Costains in 1935, with illustrations by H. M. Bateman) described the Square as &quot;a city of 1,250 flats, each enjoying at the same time most of the advantages of the separate house and the big communal dwelling place&quot;. The provision of a restaurant made him fear that &quot;fortunate wives will not have &quot;enough&quot; to do. A little drudgery is good for wives, perhaps. The Dolphin lady may be spoiled&quot;. On purchasing the site, Costain remarked to a colleague: &quot;in two or three years we&#x27;ll either drive up to this spot in a Rolls-Royce, or we&#x27;ll be standing here selling matches&quot;.

In 1958, Costains sold Dolphin Square, as it was now known, for £2.4 million to Sir Maxwell Joseph, who sold it to Lintang Investments in 1959 for £3.1 million. Westminster City Council bought the lease of the block for £4.5 million in the mid-1960s, and subsequently sub-let it to the Dolphin Square Trust, an effective housing association, which had been newly created for the purpose. In January 2006, the Trust and the Council sold Dolphin Square to the American Westbrook Holdings group for £200 million.

Accommodation is provided in 13 blocks (or &quot;houses&quot;), each named after a famous navigator or admiral. At the south (Thames) side of the Square the houses are Grenville, Drake, Raleigh and Hawkins. Moving from the river up the west side, there are Nelson, Howard, Beatty, and Duncan. A hotel and administration offices, on the north side of the Square, are in Dolphin House, previously known as Rodney. Heading south from the hotel there are Keyes, Hood, Collingwood and Frobisher.

The estate contains a swimming pool, bar, brasserie (all of which were renovated in 2008), gymnasium, and shopping arcade. In the basement are a launderette and car park. A tennis court and croquet lawn overlook the River Thames. Until 21 January 1970, London Transport bus route 134 showed PIMLICO &quot;Dolphin Square&quot; as a destination and terminated in Chichester Street.

In 2020, Axa Investment Managers announced that it had acquired Dolphin Square.

== Architecture ==
Costains appointed the architect Gordon Jeeves to design Dolphin Square and he was assisted by Cecil Eve. Oscar Faber was the consultant engineer. Up to that point, Dolphin Square was Jeeves&#x27;s largest project and he had played a part in designing other London buildings such as the National Radiator Building and later at Berkeley Square House. Dolphin Square is a neo-Georgian building and has a reinforced concrete structure with external facings of brick and stone. Original sound proofing was provided by compressed cork insulation in the floors. The original cost for the construction of Dolphin Square and its 1,310 flats was around £2,000,000. In total, it was estimated that 200,000 tonnes of earth was moved, 125,000 tons of concrete used, 12 million bricks used on the external walls and 6,700 Crittal windows installed during construction.

When it opened it had flats varying in size from one-bedroom suites to flats with five bedrooms, a maid&#x27;s room and three bathrooms. Onsite facilities provided for residents when completed included shops, a children&#x27;s centre and nursery, library and, in the basement, a garage for up to 300 cars. The planned riverside wharf, which would have included a cafe, marina and a terraced garden leading from Grosvenor Road to the Thames, was never built.

The 3.5 acres (1.4 ha) of communal gardens were designed by Richard Sudell, president of the Institute of Landscape Architects, and since 2018 are (unlike the building) Grade II listed. The gardens are a mix of formal and informal planting with expanses of lawn, with areas themed to reflect garden styles from different parts of the world. The gardens and buildings form part of the Dolphin Square conservation area.

==Residents==

The proximity of Dolphin Square to the Palace of Westminster and the headquarters of the intelligence agencies MI5 (Thames House) and MI6 (Vauxhall Cross) has attracted many politicians, peers, civil servants and intelligence agency personnel as residents.

Politicians who have lived in the development include Harold Wilson, David Steel, William Hague, Estelle Morris, Beverley Hughes, Michael Mates, John Langford-Holt and Iain Mills. (Mills died in his flat in the square&#x27;s Duncan House.)

Other notable residents have included comedians Ben Lyon and Bud Flanagan, actors Peter Finch and Thorley Walters, writer Radclyffe Hall, former Lord Chief Justice Lord Goddard, journalist Norman Cliff, tennis writer Bud Collins, Anne, Princess Royal, and Profumo affair topless showgirls Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies. Australian tennis player Rod Laver stayed at Dolphin Square for the 1969 Wimbledon championships during his Grand Slam season.

===Soviet spy arrest===
John Vassall, the Soviet spy, was arrested at apartment 807 in the square&#x27;s Hood House in 1962. Oswald Mosley and his wife Diana Mitford, Lady Mosley, left their apartment at Dolphin Square for internment in 1940 during the Second World War.

===Wartime base for Free French Government===

Grenville House was the headquarters of General De Gaulle&#x27;s Free French during World War II and number 308 Hood House was used by MI5 section B5(b) responsible for infiltrating agents into potentially subversive groups from 1924 to 1946.

===Discredited allegations of child abuse===
The Metropolitan Police Service opened an inquiry in November 2014 under Operation Fairbank into allegations that prominent MPs used the block of flats as a venue for child abuse. Carl Beech, then known publicly under the pseudonym &quot;Nick&quot;, made false allegations against several prominent men, claiming that he was taken to Dolphin Square regularly as a young boy and abused.

&quot;Exaro&quot; and the BBC News both carried interviews with Beech in which he lied about being abused at Dolphin Square. The force simultaneously launched a related murder inquiry under the name Operation Midland, in relation to Beech&#x27;s claims that he saw an MP strangle a child to death. On 21 March 2016, the Metropolitan Police announced that this had been closed without any charges. That year it emerged that Beech&#x27;s statements were fabrications, and the police&#x27;s coverage was rebuked for being seen to legitimise the claims. In 2019, Beech was convicted of making up allegations of a VIP paedophile ring.

==In popular culture==
Scenes in the 1967 sci-fi horror &quot;The Sorcerers&quot; were filmed in and around Dolphin Square.

In Len Deighton&#x27;s alternate history novel &quot;SS-GB&quot;, which is set in a German-occupied Great Britain during World War II, Dolphin Square is requisitioned for use as an interrogation centre.

The video for Culture Club&#x27;s 1982 UK number one single &quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me&quot;, was set, but not filmed, at the Dolphin Pool. The pool in the video is of a different architectural style, visibly not the Dolphin Pool.

In British novelist Kate Atkinson&#x27;s 2018 spy novel &quot;Transcription,&quot; MI5 runs a small counterespionage operation from Nelson House in Dolphin Square.

<text>Walter Rollin Brooks (January 9, 1886 – August 17, 1958) was an American writer, known for his children&#x27;s books about Freddy the Pig and the other anthropomorphic animal inhabitants of the Bean Farm in upstate New York, and also for his short stories about Mister Ed the talking horse, made into a television show after his death.

== Biography ==

Brooks was born in Rome, New York. He attended college at the University of Rochester and subsequently studied homeopathic medicine in New York City. He dropped out after two years, however, and returned to Rochester where he married Anne Shepard in 1909. He found employment with an advertising agency in Utica, and then &quot;retired&quot; in 1911, evidently because he came into a considerable inheritance. His retirement was not permanent; in 1917, he went to work for the American Red Cross and he later did editorial work for several magazines, including &quot;a nonfiction stint with &quot;The New Yorker&quot; 1932–1933&quot;. In 1940, he turned to writing for his full-time occupation. He married Dorothy Collins following the death of Anne in 1952.

The first works that Brooks published were poems and short stories. Among these were a series of short stories featuring &quot;a talking horse and his drunken owner&quot; which was the basis for the 1960s television comedy series &quot;Mister Ed&quot;. His most enduring works, however, are the 26 books that he wrote about Freddy the Pig and his friends. Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas praised &quot;Freddy and the Spaceship&quot; because it &quot;offers wit, sound structural plotting, genuine character-humor, and admirable English prose&quot;.

Brooks died of a heart attack at his home in Roxbury, New York at age 72.

In 2009, Overlook Press published &quot;Talking Animals and Others: The Life and Work of Walter R. Brooks, Creator of Freddy the Pig&quot; by Michael Cart .

<doc id="595260" wikidata="Q1208806" url="?curid=595260" title="Succession to the Monegasque throne">
<text>The succession to the throne of the Principality of Monaco is currently governed by Princely Law 1.249 of 2 April 2002.

== Eligibility ==
Under the constitution of Monaco, the crown passes according to male-preference cognatic primogeniture. Only persons descended from the reigning monarch and the reigning monarch&#x27;s siblings and their descendants, whose parents have been married at some point with the monarch&#x27;s approval, and who are Monegasque citizens are eligible. Children born as a result of adultery are permanently excluded. A dynast forfeits succession rights if he or she marries without the monarch&#x27;s permission, along with descendants of the unapproved marriage, but can be restored into the line of succession if the marriage produces no issue and ends before the demise of the crown.

Should no one be eligible to succeed according to the succession laws, a council of regency takes power until the Crown Council elects a new monarch from among the more distant descendants of the House of Grimaldi.

== Line of succession ==

The list below includes only persons eligible to succeed to the throne (numbered 1 to 18) and the illegitimate children who would enter the line if their parents ever married.

* &quot;Prince Rainier III (1923–2005)&quot;
** Prince Albert II (b. 1958)
*** Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste (b. 2003)
*** (1) Hereditary Prince Jacques (b. 2014)
*** (2) Princess Gabriella, Countess of Carladès (b. 2014)
** (3) Caroline, Princess of Hanover (b. 1957)
*** (4) Andrea Casiraghi (b. 1984)
**** (5) Alexandre (Sasha) Casiraghi (b. 2013)
**** (6) Maximilian Casiraghi (b. 2018)
**** (7) India Casiraghi (b. 2015)
*** (8) Pierre Casiraghi (b. 1987)
**** (9) Stefano Casiraghi (b. 2017)
**** (10) Francesco Casiraghi (b. 2018)
*** (11) Charlotte Casiraghi (b. 1986)
**** Raphaël Elmaleh (b. 2013)
**** (12) Balthazar Rassam (b. 2018)
*** (13) Princess Alexandra of Hanover (b. 1999)
** (14) Princess Stéphanie (b. 1965)
*** (15) Louis Ducruet (b. 1992)
**** (16) Victoire Ducruet (b. 2023)
**** (17) Constance Ducruet (b. 2024)
***(18) Pauline Ducruet (b. 1994)


A person born to a dynast who was not married to the other parent at the time of birth (such as Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste, Camille Gottlieb or Raphaël Elmaleh) does not have any succession rights unless legitimized by his or her parents&#x27; subsequent marriage (Civil Code 229 states: &quot;Les enfants légitimés par le mariage subséquent auront les mêmes droits que s&#x27;ils étaient nés de ce mariage&quot;). Louis and Pauline Ducruet, Alexandre (Sasha) Casiraghi and Balthazar Rassam have been legitimised by their parents&#x27; subsequent marriages. Jazmin Grace Grimaldi cannot be legitimated through her parents subsequent marriage because her mother&#x27;s divorce proceedings were not finalized by the time of Jazmin&#x27;s birth. As such, Jazmin is legally the product of adultery and cannot be legitimated through the subsequent marriage of her biological parents.

==2002 changes==
Until 2002, the crown of Monaco could pass only to the direct descendants, including adopted children, of the reigning prince. As a result, Princess Antoinette was not in the line of succession, and Princesses Caroline and Stéphanie would have lost their places in line at the moment of Prince Albert&#x27;s accession, and there would be no further dynasts eligible to succeed to the throne.

This possibility had two implications, namely that &quot;a&quot;) the throne might fall vacant and Monaco might officially become a protectorate of France should Prince Albert inherit the crown and then die without fathering or adopting a legitimate heir or &quot;b&quot;) Prince Albert might adopt an unrelated person as his heir, thereby breaking the genealogical line of the House of Grimaldi. In 2002, changes were made to the Constitution of Monaco which eliminated that concern by excluding adopted children from the line of succession and providing that, if the sovereign has no legitimate child, the crown passes to one of the dynastic siblings of the sovereign or, if not living, to one of their legitimate descendants.

<text>Albert Marth (5 May 1828 – 6 August 1897) was a German astronomer who worked in Britain and Ireland.

== Life ==
After studying theology at the University of Berlin, his interest in astronomy and mathematics led him to study astronomy under C. A. F. Peters at the University of Königsberg.

Marth went to England in 1853 to work for George Bishop, a rich wine merchant and patron of astronomy, who financed a London observatory (in operation from 1836 to 1861). At that time, paid jobs in astronomy were quite rare.

He worked as William Lassell&#x27;s assistant in Malta, discovering 600 nebulae. He also discovered one of the early asteroids found, 29 Amphitrite, and the galaxies NGC 3, NGC 4 and NGC 15.

He also investigated double stars, discovering NGC 30 in 1864.

From 1883 to 1897 he worked at the Markree Observatory in County Sligo where he was the second director appointed in its second period of operation.

He made extensive ephemerides of Solar System bodies. He excelled in performing calculations of transits of various planets from other planets, predicting transits of Earth from Mars and many others.

Craters on the Moon and Mars are named for him. The crater Marth on the Moon is about 3 km in diameter.

<doc id="595273" wikidata="Q59555084" url="?curid=595273" title="Fact-checking">
<text>Fact-checking is the process of verifying the factual accuracy of questioned reporting and statements. Fact-checking can be conducted before or after the text or content is published or otherwise disseminated. Internal fact-checking is such checking done in-house by the publisher to prevent inaccurate content from being published; when the text is analyzed by a third party, the process is called external fact-checking.

Research suggests that fact-checking can indeed correct perceptions among citizens, as well as discourage politicians from spreading false or misleading claims. However, corrections may decay over time or be overwhelmed by cues from elites who promote less accurate claims. Political fact-checking is sometimes criticized as being opinion journalism. A review of US politics fact-checkers shows a mixed result of whether fact-checking is an effective way to reduce misconceptions, and whether the method is reliable.

== History of fact-checking ==
Sensationalist newspapers in the 1850s and later led to a gradual need for a more factual media. Colin Dickey has described the subsequent evolution of fact-checking. Key elements were the establishment of Associated Press in the 1850s (short factual material needed), Ralph Pulitzer of the New York World (his Bureau of Accuracy and Fair Play, 1912), Henry Luce and Time magazine (original working title: Facts), and the famous fact-checking department of The New Yorker. More recently, the mainstream media has come under severe economic threat from online startups. In addition, the rapid spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories via social media is slowly creeping into mainstream media. One solution is for more media staff to be assigned a fact-checking role, as for example The Washington Post. Independent fact-checking organisations have also become prominent, such as PolitiFact.

== Types of fact-checking ==

Ante hoc&quot; fact-checking aims to identify errors so that the text can be corrected before dissemination, or perhaps rejected. Post hoc&quot; fact-checking is most often followed by a written report of inaccuracies, sometimes with a visual metric provided by the checking organization (e.g., Pinocchios from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; &quot;Fact Checker,&quot; or &quot;TRUTH-O-METER&quot; ratings from PolitiFact). Several organizations are devoted to &quot;post hoc&quot; fact-checking: examples include FactCheck.org and PolitiFact in the US, and Full Fact in the UK.

External &quot;post hoc&quot; fact-checking organizations first arose in the US in the early 2000s, and the concept grew in relevance and spread to various other countries during the 2010s.

== &quot;Post hoc&quot; fact-checking ==
External &quot;post hoc&quot; fact-checking by independent organizations began in the United States in the early 2000s. In the 2010s, particularly following the 2016 election of Donald Trump as US President, fact-checking gained a rise in popularity and spread to multiple countries mostly in Europe and Latin America. However, the US remains the largest market for fact-checking.

=== Consistency across fact-checking organizations ===
One 2016 study finds that fact-checkers PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Fact Checker overwhelmingly agree on their evaluations of claims. A 2018 paper found little overlap in the statements checked by different fact-checking organizations. This paper compared 1,178 published fact-checks from PolitiFact with 325 fact-checks from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Fact Checker, and found only 77 statements (about 5%) that both organizations checked. For those 77 statements, the fact-checking organizations gave the same ratings for 49 statements and similar ratings for 22, about 92% agreement. 

=== Choice of which statements to check ===
Different fact-checking organizations have shown different tendencies in their choice of which statements they publish fact-checks about. For example, some are more likely to fact-check a statement about climate change being real, and others are more likely to fact-check a statement about climate change being fake. 

=== Effects ===
Studies of &quot;post hoc&quot; fact-checking have made clear that such efforts often result in changes in the behavior, in general, of both the speaker (making them more careful in their pronouncements) and of the listener or reader (making them more discerning with regard to the factual accuracy of content); observations include the propensities of audiences to be completely unpersuaded by corrections to errors regarding the most divisive subjects, or the tendency to be more greatly persuaded by corrections of negative reporting (e.g., &quot;attack ads&quot;), and to see minds changed only when the individual in error was someone reasonably like-minded to begin with.

==== Correcting misperceptions ====

Studies have shown that fact-checking can affect citizens&#x27; belief in the accuracy of claims made in political advertisement. A 2020 study by Paris School of Economics and Sciences Po economists found that falsehoods by Marine Le Pen during the 2017 French presidential election campaign (i) successfully persuaded voters, (ii) lost their persuasiveness when fact-checked, and (iii) did not reduce voters&#x27; political support for Le Pen when her claims were fact-checked. A 2017 study in the &quot;Journal of Politics&quot; found that &quot;individuals consistently update political beliefs in the appropriate direction, even on facts that have clear implications for political party reputations, though they do so cautiously and with some bias... Interestingly, those who identify with one of the political parties are no more biased or cautious than pure independents in their learning, conditional on initial beliefs.&quot;

A study by Yale University cognitive scientists Gordon Pennycook and David G. Rand found that Facebook tags of fake articles &quot;did significantly reduce their perceived accuracy relative to a control without tags, but only modestly&quot;. A Dartmouth study led by Brendan Nyhan found that Facebook tags had a greater impact than the Yale study found. A &quot;disputed&quot; tag on a false headline reduced the number of respondents who considered the headline accurate from 29% to 19%, whereas a &quot;rated false&quot; tag pushed the number down to 16%. A 2019 study found that the &quot;disputed&quot; tag reduced Facebook users&#x27; intentions to share a fake news story. The Yale study found evidence of a backfire effect among Trump supporters younger than 26 years whereby the presence of both untagged and tagged fake articles made the untagged fake articles appear more accurate. In response to research which questioned the effectiveness of the Facebook &quot;disputed&quot; tags, Facebook decided to drop the tags in December 2017 and would instead put articles which fact-checked a fake news story next to the fake news story link whenever it is shared on Facebook.

Based on the findings of a 2017 study in the journal &quot;Psychological Science,&quot; the most effective ways to reduce misinformation through corrections is by:
* limiting detailed descriptions of / or arguments in favor of the misinformation; 
* walking through the reasons why a piece of misinformation is false rather than just labelling it false; 
* presenting new and credible information which allows readers to update their knowledge of events and understand why they developed an inaccurate understanding in the first place; 
* using video, as videos appear to be more effective than text at increasing attention and reducing confusion, making videos more effective at correcting misperception than text.

Large studies by Ethan Porter and Thomas J. Wood found that misinformation propagated by Donald Trump was more difficult to dispel with the same techniques, and generated the following recommendations:
* Highly credible sources are the most effective, especially those which surprisingly report facts against their own perceived bias
* Reframing the issue by adding context can be more effective than simply labeling it as incorrect or unproven.
* Challenging readers&#x27; identity or worldview reduces effectiveness.
* Fact-checking immediately is more effective, before false ideas have spread widely.

A 2019 meta-analysis of research into the effects of fact-checking on misinformation found that fact-checking has substantial positive impacts on political beliefs, but that this impact weakened when fact-checkers used &quot;truth scales&quot;, refuted only parts of a claim and when they fact-checked campaign-related statements. Individuals&#x27; preexisting beliefs, ideology, and knowledge affected to what extent the fact-checking had an impact. A 2019 study in the &quot;Journal of Experimental Political Science&quot; found &quot;strong evidence that citizens are willing to accept corrections to fake news, regardless of their ideology and the content of the fake stories.&quot;

A 2018 study found that Republicans were more likely to correct their false information on voter fraud if the correction came from Breitbart News rather than a non-partisan neutral source such as PolitiFact. A 2022 study found that individuals exposed to a fact-check of a false statement by a far-right politician were less likely to share the false statement.

Some studies have found that exposure to fact-checks had durable effects on reducing misperceptions, whereas other studies have found no effects.

Scholars have debated whether fact-checking could lead to a &quot;backfire effect&quot; whereby correcting false information may make partisan individuals cling more strongly to their views. One study found evidence of such a &quot;backfire effect&quot;, but several other studies did not.

==== Political discourse ====
A 2015 experimental study found that fact-checking can encourage politicians to not spread misinformation. The study found that it might help improve political discourse by increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation for political elites. The researchers sent, &quot;a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements. The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat.&quot;

Fact-checking may also encourage some politicians to engage in &quot;strategic ambiguity&quot; in their statements, which &quot;may impede the fact-checking movement&#x27;s goals.&quot;

==== Political preferences ====
One experimental study found that fact-checking during debates affected viewers&#x27; assessment of the candidates&#x27; debate performance and &quot;greater willingness to vote for a candidate when the fact-check indicates that the candidate is being honest.&quot;

A study of Trump supporters during the 2016 presidential campaign found that while fact-checks of false claims made by Trump reduced his supporters&#x27; belief in the false claims in question, the corrections did not alter their attitudes towards Trump.

A 2019 study found that &quot;summary fact-checking&quot;, where the fact-checker summarizes how many false statements a politician has made, has a greater impact on reducing support for a politician than fact-checking of individual statements made by the politician.

=== Informal fact-checking ===
Individual readers perform some types of fact-checking, such as comparing claims in one news story against claims in another.

Rabbi Moshe Benovitz, has observed that: &quot;modern students use their wireless worlds to augment skepticism and to reject dogma.&quot; He says this has positive implications for values development:

According to Queen&#x27;s University Belfast researcher Jennifer Rose, because fake news is created with the intention of misleading readers, online news consumers who attempt to fact-check the articles they read may incorrectly conclude that a fake news article is legitimate. Rose states, &quot;A diligent online news consumer is likely at a pervasive risk of inferring truth from false premises&quot; and suggests that fact-checking alone is not enough to reduce fake news consumption. Despite this, Rose asserts that fact-checking &quot;ought to remain on educational agendas to help combat fake news&quot;.

=== Detecting fake news ===

The term fake news became popularized with the 2016 United States presidential election, causing concern among some that online media platforms were especially susceptible to disseminating disinformation and misinformation. Fake news articles tend to come from either satirical news websites or from websites with an incentive to propagate false information, either as clickbait or to serve a purpose. The language, specifically, is typically more inflammatory in fake news than real articles, in part because the purpose is to confuse and generate clicks. Furthermore, modeling techniques such as n-gram encodings and bag of words have served as other linguistic techniques to estimate the legitimacy of a news source. On top of that, researchers have determined that visual-based cues also play a factor in categorizing an article, specifically some features can be designed to assess if a picture was legitimate and provides us more clarity on the news. There is also many social context features that can play a role, as well as the model of spreading the news. Websites such as &quot;Snopes&quot; try to detect this information manually, while certain universities are trying to build mathematical models to assist in this work.
Some individuals and organizations publish their fact-checking efforts on the internet. These may have a special subject-matter focus, such as Snopes.com&#x27;s focus on urban legends or the Reporters&#x27; Lab at Duke University&#x27;s focus on providing resources to journalists.

=== Fake news and social media ===

The adaptation of social media as a legitimate and commonly used platform has created extensive concerns for fake news in this domain. The spread of fake news via social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram presents the opportunity for extremely negative effects on society therefore new fields of research regarding fake news detection on social media is gaining momentum. However, fake news detection on social media presents challenges that renders previous data mining and detection techniques inadequate. As such, researchers are calling for more work to be done regarding fake news as characterized against psychology and social theories and adapting existing data mining algorithms to apply to social media networks. Further, multiple scientific articles have been published urging the field further to find automatic ways in which fake news can be filtered out of social media timelines.

==== Methodology ====
Lateral reading, or getting a brief overview of a topic from lots of sources instead of digging deeply into one, is a popular method professional fact-checkers use to quickly get a better sense of the truth of a particular claim.

Digital tools and services commonly used by fact-checkers include, but are not limited to:

* Reverse image search engines (Google Images, TinEye, Bing Image Search, Baidu Image Search, Yandex Image Search)
* Archiving services (Internet Archive, Archive.today, Perma.cc)
* Encyclopedias (Wikipedia)
* Web analytics platforms (Similarweb)
* Image and video analysis tools (InVID, FotoForensics)
* Domain registration information (DomainTools, DomainBigData, WHOIS.com)
* General search engines (Google Search)
* Web mapping platforms (Google Maps, Google Street View, Google Earth, Yandex Maps)
* Social media monitoring platforms (CrowdTangle, TweetDeck, BuzzSumo)

==== Ongoing research in fact-checking and detecting fake news ====

Since the 2016 United States presidential election, fake news has been a popular topic of discussion by President Trump and news outlets. The reality of fake news had become omnipresent, and a lot of research has gone into understanding, identifying, and combating fake news. Also, a number of researchers began with the usage of fake news to influence the 2016 presidential campaign. One research found evidence of pro-Trump fake news being selectively targeted on conservatives and pro-Trump supporters in 2016. The researchers found that social media sites, Facebook in particular, to be powerful platforms to spread certain fake news to targeted groups to appeal to their sentiments during the 2016 presidential race. Additionally, researchers from Stanford, NYU, and NBER found evidence to show how engagement with fake news on Facebook and Twitter was high throughout 2016.

Recently, a lot of work has gone into helping detect and identify fake news through machine learning and artificial intelligence. In 2018, researchers at MIT&#x27;s CSAIL created and tested a machine learning algorithm to identify false information by looking for common patterns, words, and symbols that typically appear in fake news. More so, they released an open-source data set with a large catalog of historical news sources with their veracity scores to encourage other researchers to explore and develop new methods and technologies for detecting fake news.

In 2022, researchers have also demonstrated the feasibility of falsity scores for popular and official figures by developing such for over 800 contemporary elites on Twitter as well as associated exposure scores.

There are also demonstrations of platform-built-in (by-design) as well browser-integrated (currently in the form of addons) misinformation mitigation. Efforts such as providing and viewing structured accuracy assessments on posts &quot;are not currently supported by the platforms&quot;. Trust in the default or, in decentralized designs, user-selected providers of assessments (and their reliability) as well as the large quantities of posts and articles are two of the problems such approaches may face. Moreover, they cannot mitigate misinformation in chats, print-media and TV.

====International Fact-Checking Day====
The concept for International Fact-Checking Day was introduced at a conference for journalists and fact-checkers at the London School of Economics and Political Science in June 2014. The holiday was officially created in 2016 and first celebrated on April 2, 2017. The idea for International Fact-Checking day rose out of the many misinformation campaigns found on the internet, particularly social media sites. It rose in importance after the 2016 elections, which brought fake news, as well as accusations of it, to the forefront of media issues. 
The holiday is held on April 2 because &quot;April 1 is a day for fools. April 2 is a day for facts.&quot;
Activities for International Fact-Checking Day consist of various media organizations contributing to fact-checking resources, articles, and lessons for students and the general public to learn more about how to identify fake news and stop the spread of misinformation. 
2020&#x27;s International Fact-Checking Day focused specifically on how to accurately identify information about COVID-19.

=== Limitations and controversies ===

Research has shown that fact-checking has limits, and can even backfire, which is when a correction increases the their belief in the misconception. One reason is that it can be interpreted as an argument from authority, leading to resistance and hardening beliefs, &quot;because identity and cultural positions cannot be disproved.&quot; In other words &quot;while news articles can be fact-checked, personal beliefs cannot.&quot;

Critics argue that political fact-checking is increasingly used as opinion journalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reason – Robby Soave – 7/29/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism has included that fact-checking organizations in themselves are biased or that it is impossible to apply absolute terms such as &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; to inherently debatable claims. In September 2016, a Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey found that &quot;just 29% of all Likely U.S. Voters trust media fact-checking of candidates&#x27; comments. Sixty-two percent (62%) believe instead that news organizations skew the facts to help candidates they support.&quot;

A paper by Andrew Guess (of Princeton University), Brendan Nyhan (Dartmouth College) and Jason Reifler (University of Exeter) found that consumers of fake news tended to have less favorable views of fact-checking, in particular Trump supporters. The paper found that fake news consumers rarely encountered fact-checks: &quot;only about half of the Americans who visited a fake news website during the study period also saw any fact-check from one of the dedicated fact-checking website (14.0%).&quot;

Deceptive websites that pose as fact-checkers have also been used to promote disinformation; this tactic has been used by both Russia and Turkey.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Facebook announced it would &quot;remove false or debunked claims about the novel coronavirus which created a global pandemic&quot;, based on its fact-checking partners, collectively known as the International Fact-Checking Network. In 2021, Facebook reversed its ban on posts speculating the COVID-19 disease originated from Chinese labs, following developments in the investigations into the origin of COVID-19, including claims by the Biden administration, and a letter by eighteen scientists in the journal Science, saying a new investigation is needed because &#x27;theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable.&quot; The policy led to an article by &quot;The New York Post&quot; that suggested a lab leak would be plausible to be initially labeled as &quot;false information&quot; on the platform. This reignited debates into the notion of scientific consensus. In an article published by the medical journal The BMJ, journalist Laurie Clarke said &quot;The contentious nature of these decisions is partly down to how social media platforms define the slippery concepts of misinformation versus disinformation. This decision relies on the idea of a scientific consensus. But some scientists say that this smothers heterogeneous opinions, problematically reinforcing a misconception that science is a monolith.&quot; David Spiegelhalter, the Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at Cambridge University, argued that &quot;behind closed doors, scientists spend the whole time arguing and deeply disagreeing on some fairly fundamental things&quot;. Clarke further argued that &quot;The binary idea that scientific assertions are either correct or incorrect has fed into the divisiveness that has characterised the pandemic.&quot;

Several commentators have noted limitations of political post-hoc fact-checking. While interviewing Andrew Hart in 2019 about political fact-checking in the United States, Nima Shirazi and Adam Johnson discuss what they perceive as an unspoken conservative bias framed as neutrality in certain fact-checks, citing argument from authority, &quot;hyper-literal ... scolding [of] people on the left who criticized the assumptions of American imperialism&quot;, rebuttals that may not be factual themselves, issues of general media bias, and &quot;the near ubiquitous refusal to identify patterns, trends, and ... intent in politicians&#x27; ... false statements&quot;. They further argue that political fact-checking focuses exclusively on describing facts over making moral judgments (ex., the is–ought problem), assert that it relies on public reason to attempt to discredit public figures, and question its effectiveness on conspiracy theories or fascism.

Likewise, writing in The Hedgehog Review in 2023, Jonathan D. Teubner and Paul W. Gleason assert that fact-checking is ineffective against propaganda for at least three reasons: &quot;First, since much of what skillful propagandists say will be true on a literal level, the fact-checker will be unable to refute them. Second, no matter how well-intentioned or convincing, the fact-check will also spread the initial claims further. Third, even if the fact-checker manages to catch a few inaccuracies, the larger picture and suggestion will remain in place, and it is this suggestion that moves minds and hearts, and eventually actions.&quot; They also note the very large amount of false information that regularly spreads around the world, overwhelming the hundreds of fact-checking groups; caution that a fact-checker systemically addressing propaganda potentially compromises their objectivity; and argue that even descriptive statements are subjective, leading to conflicting points of view. As a potential step to a solution, the authors suggest the need of a &quot;scientific community&quot; to establish falsifiable theories, &quot;which in turn makes sense of the facts&quot;, noting the difficulty that this step would face in the digital media landscape of the Internet.

Social media platforms – Facebook in particular – have been accused by journalists and academics of undermining fact-checkers by providing them with little assistance; including &quot;propagandist-linked organizations&quot; such as CheckYourFact as partners; promoting outlets that have shared false information such as Breitbart and The Daily Caller on Facebook&#x27;s newsfeed; and removing a fact-check about a false anti-abortion claim after receiving pressure from Republican senators. In 2022 and 2023, many social media platforms such as Meta, YouTube and Twitter have significantly reduced resources in Trust and safety, including fact-checking. Twitter under Elon Musk has severely limited access by academic researchers to Twitter&#x27;s API by replacing previously free access with a subscription that starts at $42,000 per month, and by denying requests for access under the Digital Services Act. After the 2023 Reddit API changes, journalists, researchers and former Reddit moderators have expressed concerns about the spread of harmful misinformation, a relative lack of subject matter expertise from replacement mods, a vetting process of replacement mods seen as haphazard, a loss of third party tools often used for content moderation, and the difficulty for academic researchers to access Reddit data. Many fact-checkers rely heavily on social media platform partnerships for funding, technology and distributing their fact-checks.

Commentators have also shared concerns about the use of false equivalence as an argument in political fact-checking, citing examples from The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Associated Press where &quot;mainstream fact-checkers appear to have attempted to manufacture false claims from progressive politicians...[out of] a desire to appear objective&quot;.

The term &quot;fact-check&quot; is also appropriated and overused by &quot;partisan sites&quot;, which may lead people to &quot;disregard fact-checking as a meaningless, motivated exercise if all content is claimed to be fact-checked&quot;.

Fact-checking journalists have been harassed online and offline, ranging from hate mail and death threats to police intimidation and lawfare.

==== Fact-checking in countries with limited freedom of speech ====
Operators of some fact-checking websites in China admit to self-censorship. Fact-checking websites in China often avoid commenting on political, economic, and other current affairs. Several Chinese fact-checking websites have been criticized for lack of transparency with regard to their methodology and sources, and for following Chinese propaganda.

== Pre-publication fact-checking ==
Among the benefits of printing only checked copy is that it averts serious, sometimes costly, problems. These problems can include lawsuits for mistakes that damage people or businesses, but even small mistakes can cause a loss of reputation for the publication. The loss of reputation is often the more significant motivating factor for journalists.

Fact-checkers verify that the names, dates, and facts in an article or book are correct. For example, they may contact a person who is quoted in a proposed news article and ask the person whether this quotation is correct, or how to spell the person&#x27;s name. Fact-checkers are primarily useful in catching accidental mistakes; they are not guaranteed safeguards against those who wish to commit journalistic frauds.

=== As a career ===
Professional fact-checkers have generally been hired by newspapers, magazines, and book publishers, probably starting in the early 1920s with the creation of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in the United States, though they were not originally called &quot;fact-checkers&quot;. Fact-checkers may be aspiring writers, future editors, or freelancers engaged other projects; others are career professionals.

Historically, the field was considered women&#x27;s work, and from the time of the first professional American fact-checker through at least the 1970s, the fact-checkers at a media company might be entirely female or primarily so.

The number of people employed in fact-checking varies by publication. Some organizations have substantial fact-checking departments. For example, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine had 16 fact-checkers in 2003 and the fact-checking department of the German weekly magazine counted 70 staff in 2017. Others may hire freelancers per piece or may combine fact-checking with other duties. Magazines are more likely to use fact-checkers than newspapers. Television and radio programs rarely employ dedicated fact-checkers, and instead expect others, including senior staff, to engage in fact-checking in addition to their other duties.

===Checking original reportage===
Stephen Glass began his journalism career as a fact-checker. He went on to invent fictitious stories, which he submitted as reportage, and which fact-checkers at &quot;The New Republic&quot; (and other weeklies for which he worked) never flagged. Michael Kelly, who edited some of Glass&#x27;s concocted stories, blamed himself, rather than the fact-checkers, saying: &quot;Any fact-checking system is built on trust ... If a reporter is willing to fake notes, it defeats the system. Anyway, the real vetting system is not fact-checking but the editor.&quot;

=== Alumni of the role ===

<doc id="595284" wikidata="Q23479" url="?curid=595284" title="HIM (Finnish band)">
<text>HIM (sometimes stylized as H.I.M.) was a Finnish gothic rock band from Helsinki. First formed in 1991 by vocalist Ville Valo and bassist Mikko &quot;Mige&quot; Paananen under the name His Infernal Majesty, the band broke up after only a few years, only to be reformed in 1995 by Valo and guitarist Mikko &quot;Linde&quot; Lindström. After being rejoined by Mige, as well as keyboardist Antto Melasniemi and drummer Juhana &quot;Pätkä&quot; Rantala, the band, now called HIM, released its debut album &quot;Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666&quot; in 1997. In 2000, now with drummer Mika &quot;Gas Lipstick&quot; Karppinen and keyboardist Juska Salminen, the band released &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot;, which reached the number one spot in Finland, Austria and Germany. The first single &quot;Join Me in Death&quot; also charted at number one in Finland and Germany, eventually going platinum and gold, respectively. Following the addition of Janne &quot;Burton&quot; Puurtinen on keyboards, HIM released &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; (2001) and &quot;Love Metal&quot; (2003). Both cracked the top ten in several countries and allowed the band to tour in the United Kingdom and the United States for the first time.

In 2005, HIM released &quot;Dark Light&quot;, which became the group&#x27;s most commercially successful album to date. HIM also became the first Finnish group in history to receive a gold record in the US. In 2007, HIM released &quot;Venus Doom&quot;, the making of which was marred by problems in Valo&#x27;s personal life. Nevertheless, the album gave the band its highest chart position in the US at number twelve. After 2010&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, HIM went on a hiatus after Gas Lipstick was forced to take medical leave. Following several months of uncertainty, the band regrouped and released the album &quot;Tears on Tape&quot; in 2013. Gas Lipstick announced his departure from the band in 2015 and was subsequently replaced by Jukka &quot;Kosmo&quot; Kröger. On 5 March 2017, HIM announced that the band would be disbanding following a farewell tour in 2017. The band played its final show on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2017 as a part of its annual Helldone Festival.

HIM is one of the most commercially successful Finnish bands of all time, with sales of over ten million records. HIM has also received numerous accolades, including eight Emma Awards. The band is known for its distinct sound, which combines more melodic and melancholic elements with heavier influences. This made it difficult for audiences to categorize HIM&#x27;s music, which led to the band coining the term &quot;love metal&quot;. HIM is also known for its logo, the heartagram, which has made numerous appearances in other media.

==History==

=== 1991–1996: Early years ===

The first incarnation of HIM was formed in 1991 by childhood friends Ville Valo and Mikko &quot;Mige&quot; Paananen in Helsinki, Finland. Valo played six-string bass, which substituted for guitar, while Mige also played bass. The band had two rotating drummers: Sami &quot;Juippi&quot; Jokilehto and Juha Tarvonen. Dubbed His Infernal Majesty, other names considered for the band included Black Earth, Black Salem and Kafferi. After recording its first demo &quot;Witches and Other Night Fears&quot;, His Infernal Majesty played its first show on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1992 at the Semifinal in Helsinki. The band broke up shortly thereafter, when Mige began his national military service. In 1995, His Infernal Majesty was reformed by Valo and guitarist Mikko &quot;Linde&quot; Lindström. Together they recorded a four-track demo, which featured Valo on drums and vocals, and Linde on guitar and bass. Valo originally intended to remain as the bassist for the group, but took up the role of lead vocalist out of necessity, after they were unable to find another singer. Eventually the two were joined by returning bassist Mige and drummer Juhana &quot;Pätkä&quot; Rantala. The group played its first show on 19 December 1995 at the Teatro in Helsinki, opening for Kauko Röyhkä. The band&#x27;s next show was also at the Teatro, this time performing Type O Negative covers, for which they recruited keyboardist Janne &quot;Burton&quot; Puurtinen.

His Infernal Majesty continued to record several more demos, sending them to Nuclear Blast, Roadrunner and Spinefarm Records, among others, all of whom passed on the band. Eventually they were signed to BMG by production manager Asko Kallonen, who was impressed by the band&#x27;s cover of Chris Isaak&#x27;s &quot;Wicked Game&quot;. In October 1996, the band, now called HIM, released the EP &quot;666 Ways to Love: Prologue&quot;. Recorded in only five days and produced by Hiili Hiilesmaa, the EP also featured Oskari &quot;Oki&quot; Kymäläinen on guitar, but he was fired from the group after allegedly having an affair with Pätkä&#x27;s girlfriend. &quot;666 Ways to Love: Prologue&quot; debuted at number sixteen on the Finnish Singles Chart and peaked at number nine five weeks later. The band played a special album release show at the Tavastia Club on 19 October 1996, before starting a full tour, for which they recruited keyboardist Antto Melasniemi.

=== 1997–2000: &quot;Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666&quot; and &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; ===
HIM began recording its full-length debut album in 1997 with Hiili Hiilesmaa once again producing. Due to the band&#x27;s minimal studio experience, Hiilesmaa played a critical role in helping &quot;build HIM&#x27;s sound&quot;, for which Valo dubbed him the honorary sixth member of the group. &quot;Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666&quot; was released in Finland on 3 November 1997 and internationally a year later. The album charted in Finland and Germany, peaking at number four in the former. The singles &quot;When Love and Death Embrace&quot; and &quot;Your Sweet 666&quot; also cracked the top ten in the band&#x27;s home country. &quot;Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666&quot; received positive reviews from critics, with AllMusic describing the album as having &quot;a very diverse sound&quot; and ultimately succeeding &quot;in pleasing everyone, whether they&#x27;re into rock or pop.&quot; &quot;Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666&quot; would eventually go platinum in Finland. HIM also went on to win Newcomer of the Year and Debut Album of the Year at the 1997 Emma Gala. The supporting tour for &quot;Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666&quot; began in mid-December 1997 at the Maxim in Kuopio. Prior to HIM&#x27;s first international tour, the band decided to fire keyboardist Antto Melasniemi, as they felt he was too disorganized and scatterbrained. He was replaced by Jussi-Mikko &quot;Juska&quot; Salminen. After returning to Finland, the band also parted ways with Pätkä. According to the band, Pätkä&#x27;s girlfriend had become pregnant, which left him with limited time to rehearse. He was replaced by Mika &quot;Gas Lipstick&quot; Karppinen.
In January 1999, HIM began demoing material for its next album with Hiili Hiilesmaa. These sessions proved to be unsuccessful, however, and the band decided to relocate to Rockfield, Wales with producer John Fryer. In November 1999, HIM released the single &quot;Join Me in Death&quot;, which charted at number one in Finland and Germany. The single would eventually go platinum in Finland, as well as gold in Germany and Austria. At the 1999 Emma Gala, HIM were named Export of the Year. On 31 December 1999, the band performed at the Tavastia Club in Helsinki, Finland, which turned into a New Year&#x27;s tradition for the group. HIM&#x27;s second album &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; was released on 24 January 2000. It peaked at number one in Finland, Austria and Germany. The album would eventually be certified double platinum in Finland, triple gold in Germany, as well as gold in Austria. Four more singles were released, all of which reached the top five on the Finnish Singles Chart. &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; was mostly well received by critics. &quot;Soundi&quot; gave the album four out of five stars, while Blabbermouth.net called it &quot;yet another amazingly crafted album from Europe&#x27;s best-kept secret.&quot; At the 2000 Emma Gala, HIM was named Band of the Year and &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; Album of the Year. The group also received the Viewers&#x27; Choice Award and the Video of the Year award for &quot;Join Me in Death&quot; at the 2000 VIVA Comet Awards. During the supporting tour for &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot;, HIM played its first shows in the United Kingdom. As the tour progressed, however, the band began to feel exhausted. They were also hit with several near-fatal accidents, where Valo nearly fell off a balcony and Salminen ended up in the emergency room after a prank gone wrong. By the band&#x27;s own account, HIM nearly broke up, though they eventually regrouped and began rehearsing for another album.

=== 2001–2004: &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; and &quot;Love Metal&quot; ===
In late 2000, HIM began demoing material for its third album with producer T. T. Oksala. Satisfied with the results, the band initially wanted to release these demos as its next album. However, BMG resisted and brought producer Kevin Shirley on board to work on the record. Around this time, keyboardist Juska Salminen was also fired from the group after missing several rehearsals. Salminen would later attribute his departure to burnout. He was replaced by Janne &quot;Burton&quot; Puurtinen. The recording process for HIM&#x27;s third album lasted approximately eleven months, which greatly affected the material. Valo later explained: &quot;When we started recording the third album, we were into stoner rock and Black Sabbath [...] At the end we were into Neil Young and it shows on the record.&quot; According to Valo, outside influences within the music industry also contributed to the extended recording process. HIM&#x27;s third album &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; was eventually released on 24 August 2001. The record peaked at number one in Finland and Austria, and at number two in Germany and Switzerland. The album would eventually go platinum in Finland and gold in Austria. Three singles were released, all of which reached the top five in Finland. &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; received mixed reviews, with AllMusic calling it &quot;way too clean&quot; and &quot;utterly boring&quot;. This was echoed by &quot;Soundi&quot;, who called the album &quot;ideal music for girls, who don&#x27;t dig the music, but Ville Valo&#x27;s looks and his lyrics&#x27; decadent imagery.&quot; Blabbermouth.net, meanwhile, was more positive, stating that &quot;in purely artistic and commercial terms [...] HIM have made the logical follow-up album to one of last year&#x27;s highlights, and they continue to cement their reputation as one of the most unique and consistent rock acts around.&quot; HIM was once again named Export of the Year at the 2001 Emma Gala. The band also received the Viewers&#x27; Choice Award at the VIVA Comet Awards.

In 2002, HIM was involved in a rights dispute over its name in the United States. As &quot;HIM&quot; was already owned by the drummer of a Chicago jazz fusion band of the same name, the Finnish HIM was renamed HER in the US, until a settlement was reached between the two parties, which allowed both to use the moniker. On 7 October 2002, the band released &quot;The Single Collection&quot;, a set containing all the group&#x27;s singles, along with a previously unreleased single of &quot;It&#x27;s All Tears&quot;. That same month, HIM&#x27;s official biography &quot;Synnin viemää&quot;, written by J. K. Juntunen, was released. The supporting tour for &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; once again exhausted the band nearly to the point of breaking up, but it also brought the group closer together. HIM also played its first concert in the United States at a one-off show organized by professional skateboarder and television personality Bam Margera. He would go on to work with the band extensively, promoting them and directing several of their music videos.
Following a two month break in early 2002, HIM regrouped and began rehearsing for its next album, which saw the band working with Hiili Hiilesmaa again. The band viewed the record as a reaction to the difficulties they faced during &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot;. According to Valo: &quot;After what we considered a disappointment with &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot;, because there were so many chefs in the kitchen, we wanted to be a band [...] that we control what we do, and everybody else can fuck off.&quot; This new determination was underlined by the decision to include the band&#x27;s logo, the heartagram, prominently on the front cover. Valo called this &quot;a statement of intent [...] musically, visually and ideologically&quot;. HIM&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Love Metal&quot; was released on 11 April 2003, and it reached the top five in four countries, peaking at number one in Finland and Germany. It also became the group&#x27;s first album to chart in the UK at number 55. &quot;Love Metal&quot; would be certified platinum in Finland and gold in Germany. Three singles were released, with &quot;The Funeral of Hearts&quot; peaking at number one in Finland. The music video was later named Best Video at the 2004 &quot;Kerrang! Awards&quot;. &quot;Love Metal&quot; was well received by critics, with &quot;Soundi&quot; giving it three out of five stars, while AllMusic noted how &quot;the songwriting is as strong as it has been in quite some time and a newly found sense of urgency keeps the record going at a well-tempered pace&quot;.

Following &quot;Love Metal&quot;″s release, HIM embarked on its first US tour, which was entirely sold-out. In August 2003, HIM parted ways with BMG, having fulfilled its contractual obligations to the label. The band were also set on releasing a live album, tentatively titled &quot;Live Metal&quot;, in November 2003, but the record was ultimately scrapped in favor of new material. In March 2004, HIM released &quot;And Love Said No: The Greatest Hits 1997–2004&quot;, which peaked at number two in Finland and number five in Germany. It also went gold in the band&#x27;s home country. Aside from previously released material, the collection also included two new songs, &quot;And Love Said No&quot; and a cover of Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Solitary Man&quot;. The singles peaked at number one and two, respectively, in Finland, while &quot;Solitary Man&quot; reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart. In September 2004, HIM signed a new recording contract with Sire Records, who would handle all the band&#x27;s future releases in Europe, North America, Japan and Australia. In Finland, HIM&#x27;s future releases would be handled through the band&#x27;s own label Heartagram. On 7 December 2004, HIM released &quot;The Video Collection: 1997–2003&quot;, a DVD featuring all the band&#x27;s music videos. HIM was also voted 2004&#x27;s Band of the Year by the readers of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

=== 2005–2008: &quot;Dark Light&quot; and &quot;Venus Doom&quot; ===

On 17 January 2005, HIM performed at the Yhteinen ASIA benefit concert for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, along with The Rasmus, The 69 Eyes, Apocalyptica and Negative. In March, the band relocated to Los Angeles to begin work on its fifth studio album with producer Tim Palmer. That same month, &quot;Himmeetä valoa&quot;, a documentary about the group, premiered on Yle TV2. The following May, HIM released &quot;Love Metal Archives Vol. I&quot;, a collection of music videos, live performances and other bonus material. It debuted at number one in Finland and at number two in Germany. Within a few weeks, the collection had gone gold in Finland. On 26 September 2005, HIM released its fifth studio album &quot;Dark Light&quot;, which became the group&#x27;s most successful album to date. It charted in sixteen countries, being certified platinum in Finland, as well as gold in Germany, the UK, and the US. Four singles were released, with &quot;Wings of a Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Killing Loneliness&quot; reaching number one and two, respectively, on the Finnish Singles Chart. The former also cracked the top ten in the UK. &quot;Dark Light&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the material as &quot;sturdier than ever&quot;, while &quot;Q Magazine&quot; called the album &quot;a collection of irresistible pop-rock anthems&quot;. &quot;NME&quot;, meanwhile, described the record as &quot;wimpy&quot;, while AllMusic branded it as &quot;glossy and user-friendly&quot;. At the 2005 Emma Gala, &quot;Dark Light&quot; was named Rock Album of the Year, while &quot;Wings of a Butterfly&quot; received the award for Song of the Year.

In September 2005, HIM embarked on European club tour to promote &quot;Dark Light&quot;. This was followed by a North American leg in October. In December, HIM expanded its annual New Year&#x27;s Eve show into a three day festival called Helldone, named so after the group&#x27;s booking agent Tiina Welldone and the city of Helsinki. Following the shows, Linde Lindström fractured his wrist bone which forced HIM to postpone a tour of the UK and Ireland. In March 2006, HIM embarked on its first Australian tour, which was followed by the band&#x27;s first shows in New Zealand and Japan. In September, HIM cancelled its forthcoming North American tour in order to begin work on a new album. Later that year, HIM released &quot;Uneasy Listening Vol. 1&quot;, a collection of rarities and alternate takes of previously released material. The album peaked at number seven in Finland, while the double single &quot;In Joy and Sorrow / Pretending&quot; reached number one.
In February 2007, HIM began recording its sixth album at Finnvox Studios with producers Hiili Hiilesmaa and Tim Palmer. The making-of the album was plagued with problems in Ville Valo&#x27;s personal life. His alcohol abuse had worsened, which resulted in him vomiting and defecating blood at one point. Things came to a head when Valo suffered a nervous breakdown during the recording process. While he did manage to recover momentarily, he began drinking again during the mixing process. Eventually Valo was admitted to the Promises Rehabilitation Clinic in Malibu by the band&#x27;s manager Seppo Vesterinen. The album&#x27;s release date was also pushed back from July to September 2007. In April, HIM released &quot;Uneasy Listening Vol. 2&quot;, which peaked at number twelve in Finland. From 25 July to 3 September 2007, HIM toured the US with Linkin Park on the Projekt Revolution Tour, which also included My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday and Placebo. Prior to the tour, HIM held a contest for fans to win a trip to meet them at the trek&#x27;s opening date in Seattle. The winners of the contest would also be featured on a forthcoming live DVD. In July, HIM played a number of concerts opening for Metallica, including a show at Wembley Stadium in London, England.

On 14 September 2007, HIM released its sixth studio album &quot;Venus Doom&quot;, which charted in the top ten in Finland, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. It also gave the band its highest US chart position to date at number twelve. The album would eventually go gold in Finland and Greece. &quot;The Kiss of Dawn&quot; and &quot;Bleed Well&quot; were released as singles, with the former peaking at number two in Finland. &quot;Venus Doom&quot; was well received by critics, with &quot;Spin&quot; calling the album &quot;[maybe] the year&#x27;s heaviest, creepiest, and sexiest hard-rock group effort&quot;, while &quot;NME&quot; declared it &quot;an extremely well-executed pop-metal album.&quot; AllMusic gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five and found the band &quot;back on track and sounding more metal than ever.&quot; &quot;Venus Doom&quot; later garnered the band its first and only Grammy nomination for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package. During the supporting tour, HIM recorded the live album &quot;Digital Versatile Doom&quot; at the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles, California. Released on 29 April 2008, the album peaked at number ten in Finland. The 2008 edition of Helldone was expanded into a tour, which took the festival around Finland, before returning to the Tavastia Club on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

=== 2009–2014: &quot;Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice&quot; and &quot;Tears on Tape&quot; ===
In August 2009, HIM entered the studio with producer Matt Squire to begin work on its seventh studio album. For the first time in the band&#x27;s career, Valo worked completely sober, which resulted in the group rehearsing more than ever before. Titled &quot;&quot;, the album was released on 8 February 2010. It charted in ten countries, cracking the top ten in Finland, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The album also reached number one on the UK Rock &amp; Metal Albums Charts and the US Hard Rock Albums Chart. &quot;Screamworks&quot; was certified gold in Finland. &quot;Heartkiller&quot; and &quot;Scared to Death&quot; were released as singles, with the former peaking at number five in Finland. &quot;Screamworks&quot; was mostly well received by critics, with &quot;Alternative Press&quot; describing it as &quot;ultimately successful in its blending of melody and muscle&quot;, while &quot;Billboard&quot; felt it was &quot;a mixed bag, but an appealingly bold one.&quot; A supporting tour began in February 2010 with several showcase dates in Europe, followed by an Australian leg as a part of the Soundwave Festival. Beginning in March, the band toured the UK and the US. On 7 December 2010, HIM released &quot;SWRMXS&quot;, a remix album done in collaboration with various other artists, including as Tiësto, Morgan Page and Salem. The 2010 edition of Helldone was cancelled, as the band opted to take a break instead.

In March 2011, HIM announced it had parted ways with Sire Records, leaving the band without a label. Later that year, HIM began work on its eight studio album, but rehearsals were cut short when Gas Lipstick was diagnosed with a repetitive stress injury and nerve damage in his hands. Gas&#x27; injury required extensive rest, which left the band in limbo, unsure whether to break up or find a replacement. The band opted to wait and see if Gas&#x27; condition improved, and after eight months, they regrouped and resumed work on HIM&#x27;s next album. Valo later credited Gas&#x27; recovery for helping revitalize the band. In October 2012, HIM released the compilation album &quot;XX – Two Decades of Love Metal&quot;. The collection was preceded by a cover of Ké&#x27;s &quot;Strange World&quot;, which was originally scheduled for release on 21 September 2012. However, due to an online leak, the release was pushed up to 7 September. &quot;XX – Two Decades of Love Metal&quot; peaked at number four in Finland. Following a two year hiatus, HIM also brought back the Helldone Festival in December 2012.
In February 2013, HIM announced that its forthcoming album would be released through Razor &amp; Tie in North America, Double Cross in the UK and Ireland, and Universal Music in Europe. On 26 April 2013, the band released its eight studio album &quot;Tears on Tape&quot;, which was once again produced by Hiili Hiilesmaa and mixed by Tim Palmer. The record charted in nine countries, peaking at number two in Finland and Germany. In the US, the album reached number fifteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Three singles were released, with &quot;Into the Night&quot; winning the Video of the Year award at the inaugural Noisecreep Creepies Awards. &quot;Tears on Tape&quot; received mostly positive reviews, with &quot;Classic Rock&quot; calling it &quot;a glorious return to form for one of the world&#x27;s most peculiarly successful bands&quot;. This was echoed by &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, who stated that &quot;within HIM&#x27;s impressive canon, it&#x27;s among their best.&quot; &quot;Kerrang!&quot; gave a less-favorable review, stating: &quot;&quot;Tears On Tape&quot; isn&#x27;t bad [...] it&#x27;s just not as seductive as HIM can be.&quot;

HIM was scheduled to begin its North American tour in support of &quot;Tears on Tape&quot; on 3 May 2013, but the tour was cancelled after Ville Valo suffered a severe asthma attack and was diagnosed with presumptive pneumonia. After Valo recuperated, HIM took part in the Rock Allegiance Tour, along with Volbeat, All That Remains and Airbourne. At the 2013 Revolver Golden Gods Awards, HIM received the award for Most Dedicated Fans. In March 2014, the band embarked on its first South American tour. That same month, HIM&#x27;s first four albums were digitally reissued in the US by The End Records. In May 2014, the band was scheduled to perform in China for the first time, but the first show in Shanghai was cut short by local authorities, while the second in Beijing was cancelled altogether, due to bad weather conditions. In November 2014, HIM released &quot;Lashes to Ashes, Lust to Dust: A Vinyl Retrospective &#x27;96-&#x27;03&quot;, a box set containing the band&#x27;s first four albums, along with &quot;666 Ways To Love: Prologue&quot;, on 180-gram vinyl. In support, HIM embarked on the Love Metal Archives Tour in December 2014. The band also performed at Fields of the Nephilim&#x27;s 30th anniversary shows in London, England.

=== 2015–2017: Final years and disbandment ===
On 27 January 2015, Gas Lipstick announced his departure from HIM, after 16 years with the band. In his announcement, Gas stated: &quot;There is no drama, bad blood or any negativity involved in my departure. I simply feel that it&#x27;s time for me to move on as a musician.&quot; HIM made its live debut following Gas&#x27;s departure in July 2015, with a surprise show at the Qstock festival in Oulu, Finland. The show featured the debut of Gas&#x27; replacement, drummer Jukka &quot;Kosmo&quot; Kröger. Valo later stated that the band would begin work on a new album eventually, but no release date had been set. On 5 December 2015, HIM performed at Knotfest in Toluca, Mexico, with Slipknot, Megadeth, and Lamb of God, among others. In 2016, HIM took another hiatus, during which the band members focused on their various side projects. Because of this, the 2016 edition of Helldone was cancelled.
In October 2016, it was announced that HIM would be headlining the Tuska Open Air Metal Festival in 2017. In January 2017, HIM was also named the headliner of Miljoona Rock. On 5 March 2017, HIM announced that the band would be disbanding following a farewell tour later that year. In the announcement, Valo stated: &quot;After quarter of a century of love and metal intertwined we sincerely feel HIM has run its unnatural course and adieus must be said in order to make way for sights, scents and sounds yet unexplored. We completed the pattern, solved the puzzle and turned the key. Thank you.&quot; Valo later elaborated on the band&#x27;s decision to call it quits, stating: &quot;We got together and started playing some songs and thinking whats next [...] We felt like the new material wasn&#x27;t taking flight. We got along well together, but something was lacking. The stars weren&#x27;t in alignment.&quot; He also went on to say that: &quot;We felt like there was nothing left to give collectively. It was fun playing the old songs, everybody got along well together, but that spark was missing.&quot; Valo didn&#x27;t rule out the possibility of the band reuniting in the future, stating: &quot;The good thing about this is that there&#x27;s no drama [...] So it doesn&#x27;t hurt the chances.&quot;

A photo exhibition by Ville Juurikkala, titled &quot;HIM: Right Here in My Eyes&quot;, was held at the Helsinki Art Museum from 15 June to 3 July, featuring previously unseen photographs of the band preparing for its farewell tour. In November 2017, the exhibition was also held at the Morrison Hotel Gallery in New York City. HIM began its Bang and Whimper 2017 – The Farewell Tour on 14 June 2017 in Barcelona, Spain. The tour was generally well received, with the &quot;Nottingham Post&quot; stating that HIM &quot;truly went out with a &#x27;bang&#x27;&quot;. The band played its final show on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2017 as a part of the Helldone Festival.

==Artistry==

===Musical style and lyrical themes===

Music critics have referred to the music of HIM as gothic rock, gothic metal, alternative rock, alternative metal, and dark rock. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine&#x27;s Sam Law described HIM&#x27;s music as &quot;blurring the lines between alt rock, goth and doom unlike anything that&#x27;d come before&quot;. The band has referred to its music as &quot;love metal&quot;, the title of the group&#x27;s fourth studio album. According to Ville Valo, the term &quot;love metal&quot; was coined as a response to people having difficulties categorizing HIM&#x27;s music. Regarding HIM&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;goth band&quot;, Valo stated: &quot;We can&#x27;t do anything about that [label], but I think we are a special shade of goth, more tender than others. In Finnish tradition, our music is very melancholic.&quot; Valo has also described HIM&#x27;s sound as &quot;sentimental, hard-hitting rock music&quot;. The band&#x27;s intent has always been to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with its heavier influences. Valo has often cited Black Sabbath and Type O Negative as HIM&#x27;s biggest sources of inspiration. Some of the band&#x27;s other influences include Paradise Lost, Anathema, My Dying Bride, Cathedral, Electric Wizard, Monster Magnet and Norwegian black metal. Regarding HIM&#x27;s sound, Valo has also stated that: &quot;We never tried to claim that we have reinvented the wheel of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. We&#x27;ve always been proud to be the torchbearers for Sabbath, Type O, Paradise Lost and Anathema, and a lot of those bands.&quot; &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; felt HIM achieved &quot;major crossover appeal&quot; by combining &quot;traditional Finnish melancholia&quot; with &quot;gothic lyrics, walls of metal guitars, and keyboard riffs.&quot;

On its debut album &quot;Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666&quot;, HIM&#x27;s sound was viewed by music critics as a combination of heavy metal, and 1980s rock and goth music. These influences were further explored on &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot;, which featured less focus on guitar, in favor of a sleeker production and a more melodic sound. HIM continued to explore what critics perceived as a more commercial sound on its third album &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot;, which was met with mixed reactions. HIM&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Love Metal&quot; is widely viewed by the band as the record where the group found its own sound, taking inspiration from bands such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Iggy Pop. &quot;Dark Light&quot; was HIM&#x27;s breakthrough album in the United States, and once again featured a glossier production. According to Valo, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Venus Doom&quot; was written with the intent of creating a much heavier and darker follow-up, influenced by the likes of My Dying Bride, Anathema and Paradise Lost. &quot;Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice&quot; took influences from bands of the 1980s, such as a-ha, Depeche Mode and the Cult, while &quot;Tears on Tape&quot; saw HIM returning to its roots, combining elements of the band&#x27;s sound on every song, as opposed to having &quot;a fast song followed by a slow song&quot;. Valo described &quot;Tears on Tape&quot; as a combination of Black Sabbath, the Smashing Pumpkins and Roy Orbison.

Lyrically the songs of HIM largely deal with themes of love. According to Valo: &quot;I feel like there is no subject more important for a song than relationships. It&#x27;s the only thing that moves me.&quot; Valo also takes inspiration from literature, but only certain aspects of it, explaining: &quot;As a guy who writes songs, I get excited about an idea, or a book, or a sentence. I don&#x27;t necessarily get excited about the whole of Tolkien, I just get excited about Uruk-hai. Just a little detail that just makes my mind work overdrive.&quot; Valo&#x27;s lyrics have been described as &quot;oozing with blood-dripping hearts and gothic melodrama&quot;.

A central part of HIM&#x27;s image has been the heartagram, which is the trademarked symbol of the band, created by vocalist Ville Valo on his twentieth birthday in 1996. A combination of a heart and a pentagram, the heartagram is meant to represent the juxtaposition of &quot;the soft and the hard, the male and the female, the yin and the yang&quot;. Musically, the heart is also meant to represent the softer side of the band, while the pentagram symbolizes its heavier influences. This juxtaposition can also be seen in the band&#x27;s album titles. On HIM&#x27;s first album, the band used a heart with the number &quot;666&quot; written on it as the logo, which Valo later described as &quot;a bit boring&quot;. The heartagram was first predominantly used on the cover of HIM&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Love Metal&quot;. It has since appeared on nearly all releases from the band. Valo has later stated that the heartagram &quot;is probably the best thing I&#x27;ve ever come-up with&quot;, and that it&#x27;s &quot;worth a lot more than money&quot; and &quot;bigger than our band&quot;. The heartagram has made several appearances on television as well, including on &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;LA Ink&quot;, &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; and &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;.

In the band&#x27;s early days, HIM&#x27;s image was heavily characterized by occult and satanic imagery. The use of the number &quot;666&quot; was prominent in lyrics, as well as song and album titles. The band&#x27;s original name &quot;His Infernal Majesty&quot; was also inspired by &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; by Anton LaVey, the song &quot;Oblivious to Evil&quot; by Deicide, and Haile Selassie, who was known as &quot;his imperial majesty&quot;. This flirtation with the occult was seen by the band as purely &quot;symbolic&quot; and &quot;traditionally rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;. Ville Valo first became interested in the occult while in school and soon began reading books on the subject. All of the band were also big fans of black metal. However, the group have maintained that none of them were seriously interested in satanism. Instead their interest was about mere &quot;fascination&quot;, as well as a tongue in cheek hats off to their favorite bands. His Infernal Majesty eventually shortened its name to HIM in 1996, reportedly because Finnish people had difficulty remembering and pronouncing &quot;His Infernal Majesty&quot;. In the years since, HIM toned down the use of satanic imagery even further. When asked about the band&#x27;s image in 2013, Valo responded: &quot;I think we&#x27;re pretty much the same [offstage]. The only difference is I&#x27;m not necessarily wearing eyeliner every day.&quot;

On the band&#x27;s first three albums, vocalist Ville Valo was featured solely on the cover. According to Valo, &quot;Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666&quot; was meant as combination of goth and eroticism, while &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; was influenced by the 1980s, glam rock and pop music. &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot;, meanwhile, took inspiration from Lou Reed, Patti Smith and late 1970s New York City art circles. &quot;Love Metal&quot; was the first album to prominently feature the heartagram on its cover, which was repeated on the follow-up &quot;Dark Light&quot;. For &quot;Venus Doom&quot;″s cover, the band used a painting by David Harouni, which Valo had purchased while on tour in New Orleans. &quot;Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice&quot; featured a photo of a late 19th century nun sculpture that Valo had purchased in Bavaria. On &quot;Tears on Tape&quot;, HIM used several paintings by Daniel P. Carter, along with a variation of the heartagram on the front cover.

===Legacy===

HIM is one of the most commercially successful Finnish bands of all time, with sales of over ten million albums worldwide. They are also the first Finnish group in history to receive a gold record in the United States. As one of the first Finnish bands to achieve major international success, HIM has been credited for paving the way for other Finnish groups, such as Children of Bodom and Sonata Arctica. HIM&#x27;s manager Seppo Vesterinen recalled how before HIM &quot;the success of Finnish bands [..] was confined to pretty small circles, it wasn&#x27;t a global phenomenon&quot;. In 2015, HIM were one of six Finnish bands honored by the Finnish postal service by being featured on a new line of postage stamps designed by Klaus Welp. Publications such as &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; and &quot;Loudwire&quot; have ranked HIM among the best Finnish metal bands of all time.
Much of HIM&#x27;s success has been attributed to Ville Valo. Along with his songwriting, a key component in HIM&#x27;s success was Valo&#x27;s image, which &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; described as utilizing &quot;the tried and true James Dean formula, wherein sensitivity and edginess combined.&quot; &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; described Valo as one of the few new &quot;rockstars&quot; of the early 2000s, stating: &quot;HIM were like no other band. They had a special something, but more importantly they had a special someone. Ville shone like a star with his blend of Mick Jagger posturing and Brandon Lee&#x27;s dark charms in &quot;The Crow&quot;&quot;. &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked Valo as the fourteenth greatest metal frontman of the 21st century, stating: &quot;His baritone voice is undeniably gorgeous, his vampiric charisma is almost hypnotic, male fans desperately attempt to emulate him and female fans scream ballistically as if he was the second coming of Elvis.&quot; Unlike other rock and metal bands, HIM also had a wide appeal, with BMG&#x27;s Asko Kallonen recalling: &quot;For example in England it was hard to grasp. There the split was usually clear: hard rock was for guys, pop was for girls. HIM was listened to by both.&quot; Tavastia Club owner Juhani Merimaa noted how the band&#x27;s credibility in both the underground and mainstream, along with &quot;melodic, catchy and good songs&quot;, paved the way for HIM to achieve major success. PopMatters, meanwhile, noted how HIM is &quot;not the sort of act that conjures up a lukewarm response [as] people either like them or discredit them outright&quot;. Some of the major criticism directed towards the band have centered around the &quot;formulaic&quot; nature of its music and perceived &quot;pandering&quot; toward teenage goth fans. HIM&#x27;s association with Bam Margera has also received some negative feedback.

The heartagram has also been a key factor in HIM&#x27;s success, with Valo noting how the symbol has transcended the band, stating: &quot;There are a lot of people who have them [tattooed] who don&#x27;t actually know what it was, don&#x27;t relate it to the band, and in that sense, I consider that to be my greatest achievement.&quot; Valo has also credited Bam Margera and Kat Von D for helping the band gain exposure through their work. HIM&#x27;s music and the heartagram have been prominently featured in Margera&#x27;s films and TV shows, as well as Von D&#x27;s &quot;LA Ink&quot;. Margera was first introduced to HIM in May 2000, when he flew to Finland for a skateboarding competition and saw the band&#x27;s music video on TV. He subsequently went out to a record store and bought the album &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot;. Regarding Margera&#x27;s involvement in HIM&#x27;s success, Valo stated: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t about secret handshakes between managers, he was just a random fella who came a-knocking on our door [...] and that&#x27;s how the friendship started.&quot; Kat Von D, meanwhile, was introduced to HIM when the band was recording &quot;Dark Light&quot; in Los Angeles. She later appeared in the music video for &quot;Killing Loneliness&quot; and has gone on to do several tattoos for members of the band.

<text>The Hansen Writing Ball is an early typewriter. It was invented in 1865 and patented and put into production in 1870, and was the first commercially produced typewriter.

== Design ==
The writing ball (Danish: &quot;skrivekugle&quot;) was invented in 1865 by the reverend Rasmus Malling-Hansen (1835–1890) principal of the Royal Institute for the Deaf-Mutes in Copenhagen.

The Hansen ball was a combination of unusual design and ergonomic innovations: its distinctive feature was an arrangement of 52 keys on a large brass hemisphere, causing the machine to resemble an oversized pincushion. &quot;Hvem er Skrivekuglens Opfinder&quot;, written by Malling-Hansen&#x27;s daughter Johanne Agerskov, describes Malling-Hansen&#x27;s experiments with a model of his writing ball made out of porcelain. He tried out different placements of the letters on the keys, to work out the placement that led to the quickest writing speed. He ended up placing the most frequently used letters to be touched by the fastest writing fingers, and also placed most of the vowels to the left and the consonants to the right. This, together with the short pistons which went directly through the ball, made the writing speed of the writing ball very fast.

Like most of the early 19th-century typewriters, it did not allow the paper to be seen as it passed through the device.

=== Early designs ===
The first models typed on a paper attached to a cylinder, which could be made to move both rotationally with the cylinder and longitudinally along the cylinder, enabling the user to format and space the letters manually. The user would attach a piece of white paper and a sheet of coloring paper onto the cylinder by way of several clips. These models also included an electro-magnet for the Ball which controlled both the typewriter&#x27;s movement and manipulation, thus making Malling-Hansen&#x27;s machine the first electric typewriter. This electro-magnet was powered by a 10 or 12-cell battery, and controlled a mechanical escapement in the typewriter&#x27;s clockwork, moving the carriage a fixed amount each time one of the pistons was depressed.

=== Improvements ===
Malling-Hansen made several improvements on his invention throughout the 1870s and 1880s, and in 1874 he patented the next model, and now the cylinder was replaced by a flat mechanical paper-frame. The electromagnetic battery was still used to move the paper along as the Ball typed upon it, and the design led to a lower possibility for error. Malling-Hansen improved further on his design, and created a semi-cylindrical frame to hold one sheet of paper. This best known model was first patented in 1875, and now the battery was replaced by a mechanical escapement. All these improvements made for a simpler and more compact writing apparatus.

== Sale and popular use ==

It was exhibited at a great industrial exhibition in Copenhagen in 1873, at the world exhibition in Vienna in 1873, and at the Paris exhibition or Exposition Universelle. All through the 1870s it won several awards.

The writing ball was sold in many countries in Europe, and it is known that it was still in use in offices in London as late as 1909. But due to its hand-crafted production, it was overtaken in the market by the mass-produced Sholes and Glidden typewriter which E. Remington and Sons started to make in 1873.

Malling-Hansen also invented a very high speed writing machine for stenography, called the Takygraf, and a copying technique called the Xerografi—both invented in 1872.

More-or-less intact Hansen balls have fetched hundreds of thousands of Euros in auctions. Few remain in existence today.

In 1881, when he had serious problems with his sight, Friedrich Nietzsche wanted to buy a typewriter to enable him to continue his writing, and from letters to his sister it is known that he personally was in contact with &quot;the inventor of the typewriter, Mr Malling-Hansen from Copenhagen&quot;. He mentioned to his sister that he had received letters and also a typewritten postcard as an example. Nietzsche received his writing ball in 1882 directly from the inventor, Rasmus Malling-Hansen, in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was the newest model, the portable tall one with a color ribbon, serial number 125, and several typescripts are known to have been written by him on this writing ball (approximately 60). It is known that Nietzsche was also familiar with the newest model from E. Remington and Sons (model 2), but he wanted to buy a portable typewriter, so he chose to buy the Malling-Hansen writing ball, as this model was lightweight and easy to carry. Unfortunately, Nietzsche was not totally satisfied with his purchase and never really mastered the use of the instrument. A number of theories have been advanced to explain why Nietzsche did not make more use of it. For example, Rüdiger Safranski indicates it was &quot;defective&quot;. New research indicates Nietzsche was not aware that his trouble in using the machine had been caused by damage to it during transportation to Genoa in Italy, where he lived at the time, and when he turned to a mechanic who had no typewriter repair skills, the man managed to damage the writing ball even more. Nietzsche claimed that his thoughts were influenced by his use of a typewriter (&quot;Our writing instruments contribute to our thoughts&quot;, 1882). As one researcher has noted, &quot;Nietzsche&#x27;s interest in rhetoric and his experience of the typewriter framed his understanding of language in a highly symbolic way: the traditions of the philosophy of language versus the scientific and technological conditions of knowledge.&quot; On February 16, 1882 he even wrote a poem about his writing ball.

<text>Pakistani English (Paklish, Pinglish, PakEng, en-PK) is a group of English-language varieties spoken in Pakistan and among the Pakistani diaspora. English is the primary language used by the government of Pakistan, alongside Urdu, on the national level. While being spoken natively by only a small percentage of the population, it is the primary language used in education, commerce, administration, and the legal and judicial systems.

It was first recognised as a distinct variety of South Asian English and designated in the 1970s and 1980s. Pakistani English, similar and related to Indian English, is slightly different from other varieties of English in respect to vocabulary, syntax, accent, spellings of some words and other features.

==History==
Although British rule in the Subcontinent lasted for almost two hundred years, the areas which lie in what is now Pakistan were amongst the last to be annexed: Sindh in 1842, Punjab (which initially included the North-West Frontier Province) in 1849, and parts of Baluchistan, including Quetta and the outer regions in 1879, while the rest of the Baluchistan region became a princely state within the British Empire. As a result, British English had less time to become part of local culture though it did become part of elite culture as it was used in elite schools and in higher education, as in the rest of Subcontinent. The colonial policies which made English a marker of elite status and the language of power—being used in such domains of power as the civil service, the officer corps of the armed forces, the higher judiciary, universities, prestigious newspapers, radio and entertainment—were due to British policies and the continuation of these policies by Pakistani Governments. The roots of Pinglish in Pakistan can be traced back to the 19th century, when Sir Syed Ahmad Khan encouraged the Muslims to learn English and utilize it as a medium of resistance against the British. In 1947 upon Pakistan&#x27;s establishment, English became the de facto official language, a position which was formalised in the Constitution of Pakistan of 1973. Together with Urdu, the two languages are concurrently the official languages of the country. English language continues as the language of power and is also the language with the maximum cultural capital of any language used in Pakistan. It remains much in demand in higher education in Pakistan.

The term &quot;Pinglish&quot; was first recorded in 1999, being a blend of the words Pakistani and English, with the &#x27;e&#x27; changed to &#x27;i&#x27; to better represent pronunciation. Another colloquial portmanteau word is &quot;Paklish&quot; (recorded from 1997).

==Relationship with Indian English==

Pakistani English (PE) shares many similarities with Indian English, but since the Partition of India, there have been some very obvious differences. Rahman argues that PE is an interference variety of English created by the use of the features of Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi and other languages spoken in Pakistan. He further divides PE into Anglicised English, which is very similar to the speech and writing of the speakers of British Standard English (BSE), acrolect PE, which is used by Pakistanis educated in English-medium schools, mesolectal PE, which is used by ordinary, Urdu-educated Pakistanis and basilect PE, which is used by people of little formal education, such as guides and waiters.

Words and expressions of PE have been noted by a number of scholars, including unique idioms and colloquial expressions as well as accents. Also, like Indian English, Pakistani English has preserved many phrases that are now considered antiquated in Britain.

==Use in Pakistan==
Urdu and English are Pakistan&#x27;s official languages. Many street signs, shop signs, business contracts and other activities use English. All documents used by government and court also include English, despite a 2015 order by Pakistan&#x27;s Supreme Court to replace English at an official level with Urdu.

English is most taught to Pakistani students in private schools, and in many cases the medium of instruction is also in English. Although there are also many public schools that teach in the local languages and Urdu, there is a huge emphasis on English as a second language especially in standardised testing. At college and university level, all instructions are typically in English.

Pakistan boasts a large English language press and media. All of Pakistan&#x27;s major dailies are published in or have an edition in English. State-run PTV World is a major English Language News Channel in the country, while previously Dawn News and Tribune 24/7 were other English language news channels with one later switching its language to Urdu and the other was shut down. Indus News is now another major English language news channel in Pakistan. Code-switching (the concurrent use of more than one language, or language variety, in conversation) is common in Pakistan and almost all conversations in whatever language have a significant English component. The language of pleading in all courts of Pakistan is also English.

==Literature==
==Grammar==
The role of English within the complex multilingual society of Pakistan is far from straightforward: it is used across the country by speakers with various degrees of proficiency; the grammar and phraseology may mimic that of the speaker&#x27;s first language. While Pakistani speakers of English use idioms peculiar to their homeland (often literal translations of words and phrases from their native languages), this is far less common in proficient speakers, and grammar tends to be quite close to that of Standard English but exhibiting some features of American English.

==Phonology==
Pakistani English phonology follows that of British English. It may be rhotic or non-rhotic. Rahman provides a broad introduction to the phonology of Pakistani English.

Some common features of PE are:

===Consonants===
* in almost all regions of Pakistan is realised as and is realised as .
* Most PE speakers can not distinguish well between and , pronouncing them both as . 
* The quality of sound in PE is usually .
* Most, if not all, PE speakers do not aspirate their voiceless plosives .
* PE does not have (velarised L)
* PE speakers use before vowels in some words where standard Englishes (GenAmE and SSBE) would use , for example, &quot;singer&quot; is pronounced 
* PE speakers use after consonants in words where standard Englishes would use , so &quot;English&quot; is pronounced rather than .
* The dental fricatives and are realised as dental stops i.e. and respectively.

==Influences==
Pakistani English is heavily influenced by Pakistan&#x27;s languages as well as the English of other nations. Many words or terms from Urdu, such as &#x27;cummerbund&#x27;, have entered the global language and are also found in Pakistan. In addition the area which is now Pakistan was home to the largest garrisons of the British Indian Army (such as Rawalpindi and Peshawar) and this, combined with the post-partition influence of the Pakistan Military, has ensured that many military terms have entered the local jargon.

The type of English taught (and preferred) is British English. The heavy influence and penetration of American culture through television, films and other media has brought in great influences of American English.

===Vocabulary and colloquialisms===

Pakistani English contains many unique terms, as well as terms which are utilised somewhat differently in Pakistan. For instance, &quot; is used for potato chips as well as for French fries (usage of these terms is common in the UK) and &quot; is used for both lime and lemon.
* &quot;&quot; – Respectful way of addressing anyone who is significantly older than oneself: &quot;Uncle, please give way&quot;.
* Use of &quot;double&quot; and &quot;triple&quot; for numbers occurring twice or three times in succession (this is also in usage in the UK), especially for a phone number: for example, a phone number 2233344 would be pronounced as &quot;double two, triple three, double four&quot;; however the phone number 2222555 would be pronounced as &quot;double two, double two, triple five&quot;.
* &quot;Shopper&quot; means a shopping bag, rather than a person who is shopping, the latter is referred to as a customer.
* &quot;Petrol pump&quot; — This term used to refer to a petrol station (gas station).
* &quot;Opening/closing an object&quot; refers to turning something on or off; this is due to the verbs for to open and to close being the same as the verbs for to turn on and to turn off in Urdu and other Pakistani languages.
* &quot;Alphabet&quot; - can be used to refer to a single letter and &quot;alphabets&quot; can refer to a group of two or more letters.

Usually &quot;Sergeant&quot; is replaced by &quot;Havildar&quot; the equivalent rank in the Pakistan Army. Also used for upwardly mobile, ambitious or nouveau riche.
* &quot;Miss&quot; is used to address or refer to female teachers, whatever their marital status, e.g. &quot;Yes, I have done my homework, Miss.&quot; Less commonly used to refer to women colleagues or subordinates. (Usage is also common in the UK)
* &quot;Madam&quot; is used to address and refer to females in positions of authority, usually a superior, e.g. &quot;Madam has ordered me to get the figures for last year&#x27;s sales.&quot; Can also be used as a noun, e.g. &quot;She is the madam of that department&quot; meaning she is the head of the department, without it being derogatory.
* &quot;Sir&quot; is used for a male superior, often combined with their name or used as a noun. E.g. &quot;Is Sir in?&quot; or &quot;Sir Raza wants to see you in his office as soon as possible&quot;.
* &quot;Well left&quot; – avoided artfully, often a tricky situation; from cricket, the term &quot;well left&quot; is applied when a batsman chose not to play a potentially dangerous delivery, e.g. &quot;I well left that offer, it could have caused many problems.&quot;
* &quot;Threw/Received a googly&quot; – an unexpected situation arose, a person was surprised, often unpleasantly, e.g. &quot;had just settled down and then got the googly about the transfer&quot;. From googly, a delivery in cricket.

===Numbering system===
The Indian numbering system is preferred for digit grouping, although the Western grouping system is far more widely used in Pakistan. When written in words, or when spoken, numbers less than 100,000 are expressed just as they are in Standard English. Numbers including and beyond 100,000 are expressed in a subset of the Pakistani numbering system. Thus, the following scale is used:

Larger numbers are generally expressed as multiples of the above.

* &quot;Allopathy&quot;, used by homoeopaths to refer to conventional medicine.

===Food===
* &quot;Brinjal&quot;: aubergines / eggplant

<text>The Basilica of St. Francis Xavier is a parish church in the Archdiocese of Dubuque located in Dyersville, Iowa, United States. The church was named in honor of the missionary Saint Francis Xavier. It was raised to the status of a minor basilica in 1956. The church and rectory were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

==History==

Dyersville was originally settled by English immigrants. Within a few years the English moved on, and many German immigrants began to arrive in the area. A parish was founded to serve these immigrants in 1859. The first St. Francis Xavier Church was completed in 1862. The parish grew quickly and the church had to be doubled in size by 1869. By 1880, it became clear that with the increasing Catholic population of Dyersville and the surrounding area, the old church building would no longer be adequate.

A new church building program was begun in the mid-1880s. The parish decided on a large Gothic Revival style building in order to serve the increased population. Dubuque architects Fridolin Heer Sr. and his son Fridolin Heer Jr. designed the church. The priest at the time, Anton Kortenkamp (1834-1889), also had the foresight to have the altar placed upon a foundation of solid rock, which is one of the requirements for an altar to be consecrated. Construction was begun in 1887, and the cornerstone was laid on June 3, 1888. The new church was dedicated by Bishop John Hennessy on December 3, 1889. When the building was dedicated, special trains brought people from all over the state of Iowa to witness the ceremony. It cost approximately $100,000 to build the church. After the completion of the present building, the old church was converted into classrooms. It was later torn down after a new school was completed. Electric lights were added to the church in 1904.

The interior of the church is decorated with a number of paintings and frescoes. Much of this work was done by Milwaukee artists Clotilda and Alphonse Brielmaier from 1904 to 1905. Work to either touch-up the original frescoes or to partially cover some of them was done in 1930 and 1955.

The rectory was built to the west of the church in 1935. The brick residence contains 14 rooms. The rooms are a combination of private living space and offices. A. J. Osterhaus Construction of Dyersville was the contractor who built the rectory. A garage and a passageway connects it to the basilica.
The move to elevate St. Francis Xavier to a minor basilica began in the 1940s. Then-Father Mathias M. Hoffman, who had served as a military chaplain in Europe in World War I and World War II, began to advance the cause to Vatican officials. The cause was furthered when a high ranking German Cardinal, Konrad von Preysing, visited the church. In the mid-1950s the church building was consecrated. On the interior there are a number of small gold crosses on the side walls, marking the twelve places where the church walls were anointed with chrism when the church was consecrated. Once consecrated a church building may never be used for any other purpose and only a consecrated church can be elevated to the rank of a basilica. Previously the parish had worked hard to attain and maintain a debt-free status, a preliminary requirement before a church can be consecrated.

On May 11, 1956, the church was elevated to the rank of a minor basilica by Pope Pius XII. It was the twelfth church in the United States to receive this honor. A mass officially naming the church as a basilica attracted crowds from all over the state, as well as many high ranking clergy.

An addition was made to the south side of the basilica in 1989. It contains a handicapped elevator, restrooms and access to the basement of the basilica.

In the mid-1990s, the parish began to offer a Tridentine Mass at 12:00 p.m. on Sundays. This Mass was either said or sung in Latin according to the 1962 Rite. Currently, the Noon Mass is offered in Spanish.

The interior of the church was refurbished from 2000 to 2001. The paintings and frescoes were cleaned. Other frescoes that were hidden under coats of paint were restored. The baldacchino, the main altars, the side altars, and the statues were cleaned and restored. This was possible due to a gift from a parishioner.

==The church building==

The basilica features Ruskinian Gothic Revival architecture. The two steeples are tall with crosses that cap the spires. This helps make the church visible from miles away across the rolling lightly forested farmland. Pilots often use these steeples as landmarks during flights. The church is a rectangular structure that measures and is high. It has a polygonal apse on its west side. The interior includes columns and vaulted ceilings. The church has a seating capacity of about 1,000 people. There are about 5,000 people total in the parish.

The church has 64 large cathedral glass windows. There are two notable windows in the church. The first is the rose window above the entrances to the church, installed in 1959. It replaced a conventional church window on which the framework had become deteriorated. An Indian motif was selected in recognition of many local Indian tribes that inhabited this area 150 years earlier.
The two side altars were designed by J. E. Brielmaier and erected by the Dubuque Altar Company in March 1897. They measure and are made of butternut. Mary&#x27;s altar is called &quot;The Coronation&quot; and Joseph&#x27;s is called &quot;The Holy Family&quot;. Brielmaier also designed the butternut baldacchino over the high altar, which is carved Italian marble by the Milwaukee Monument Company, and they were both installed in December 1897. The baldacchino rises to a height of . The wood carved crucifix above the altar was created in 1873 for the original church. The ornate pulpit from 1906 sits to the left of the altar. Also carved in butternut, it was originally located in the nave and had a carved canopy over it. It was moved into chancel in the 1940s and the canopy was removed at that time. The images carved on the pulpit include the Evangelists: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John as well as the Apostles Peter and Paul; and five Doctors of the Western Church: Ambrose, Jerome, Gregory, Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. A free-standing altar was commissioned from the John C. Kaiser Company of Dubuque and created by Fritz Ganshirt. It was installed in 1973.
Above the high altar is a large central painting of the heavenly liturgy mentioned in Revelations 5: the Adoration of the Mystical Lamb of God. To the right are images of the prophets that include John the Baptist, Noah holding the ark, David playing the harp, Melichisedech holding bread and wine, Moses holding the Ten Commandments, and the Three Magi with their gifts. The image of Msgr. M.M. Hoffmann, the pastor when the church was named a basilica, was added in 2000. To the left are images of saints that include the Blessed Virgin Mary, George with a spear, Lawrence with a gridiron, Stephen with stones, Joseph with a lily, Rose of Lima with a crown of roses, Peter with keys, Paul with sword, Henry the King, Boniface, Francis of Assisi, Francis Xavier, Catherine, and Cecilia playing the organ. An image of the Rev. George W. Heer, who was pastor of the parish when the original painting was done, was added during its restoration.

The Stations of the Cross that line side walls were installed in 1959. The plaster bas reliefs replaced the original set that dated from 1870, which had deteriorated.

The images on the center aisle were installed in 1998. It is the first floor of its kind in the United States to combine &quot;epoxy based terrazzo, and computer generated water jet laser cutting for the brass molds.&quot; The symbols in the floor include the coats of arms of the Archdiocese of Dubuque, Pope Pius XII, the basilica, and the papal insignia of the tiara and keys.

In 1971 a new organ was installed in the church that replaced the basilica&#x27;s original pipe organ, which dated from 1913. The 27-rank organ located in the rear gallery is a custom made instrument designed for the basilica by the Wicks Organ Company of Highland, Illinois. The organ was designed keeping in mind the size of the church and the acoustical qualities of the building. In 2019 the organ was rebuilt and expanded by the Reuter Organ Company, giving the organ a new facade of speaking pipes and adding the choir division that had been left out of the 1971 organ. Additionally due to damage from a lightning strike shortly after the 1971 organ was installed, the organ was experiencing issues with its electrical system. This electrical system was replaced with a fiber optic system which is much more resistant to electrical issues than the older organ.

Because one of the roles of the basilica is to serve as the pope&#x27;s church in the event he would visit the area, the church features a special bell called a &quot;tintinnabulum&quot;, and an umbrella called an &quot;umbraculum&quot;.

<text>The University of West Georgia is a public university in Carrollton, Georgia, United States. The university offers a satellite campus in Newnan, Georgia, select classes at its Douglasville Center, and off-campus Museum Studies classes at the Atlanta History Center in Atlanta, Georgia. A total of 14,394 students, including 9,157 undergraduate and 5,237 graduate, were enrolled as of fall 2024. The university is also one of four comprehensive universities in the University System of Georgia.

==History==

In 1906 the decision to create the Fourth District Agricultural and Mechanical School occurred in response to a call for a &quot;more realistic educational program for rural youth&quot; aged 13 to 21. The Bonner plantation was chosen as the location for the school.

John H. Melson served as the school&#x27;s first principal from 1908 to 1920. John Melson and his wife Penelope worked intimately alongside the students who attended the school and further enhanced the institution. In addition, Penelope Melson was the one responsible for creating the library at the college. In January 1908, she conducted a &quot;book shower&quot; which provided the school with a little over 300 manuscripts.

In 1920 Irvine S. Ingram, whom UWG&#x27;s library is named after, became Melson&#x27;s successor and the second principal of the A&amp;M school. He married fellow faculty member Martha Munro in 1921 and they had one daughter, Anne, in 1924. Ingram was instrumental in developing the concept of &quot;extension&quot; education and adult-education offerings along with a summer school program for local teachers to develop their skills. The school&#x27;s name (Fourth District Agricultural and Mechanical School) was changed to West Georgia College in 1933 and it became a two-year institution. When this occurred, Ingram became the college&#x27;s first president. He served until 1960 and was succeeded by William H. Row. Shortly after, Row died from a heart attack and Ingram filled in as president for six months in 1961 until James E. Boyd was appointed to the position. While president, Ingram saw West Georgia become a four-year institution in 1957. He can also be credited with obtaining a substantial grant of $250,000 from the Rosenwald Foundation used to expand the college&#x27;s facilities and programs, including the Sanford building, originally used as a library and creating the College in the Country program, initially an adult or continuing education program that eventually involved student teachers from the college, and foreign exchange programs that brought national recognition to the college.

James E. Boyd, became the president of West Georgia College in 1961. Boyd is most known for peacefully integrating the campus (without waiting for a court order) in 1963 by inviting a young black woman, Lillian Williams, to attend the college; she would eventually earn two degrees in education and earn the college&#x27;s highest honor, the Founder&#x27;s Award, in 1985.

In May 1964, Boyd invited Robert F. Kennedy to the dedication of the campus chapel as the Kennedy Chapel, as U.S. president John F. Kennedy&#x27;s death had occurred in November 1963. Robert would promote the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which was being debated in the United States Senate.

Boyd dramatically expanded the college during his tenure in both headcount and academic diversity. In sheer numbers, there were 1089 students upon his arrival and 5503 students upon his departure. In 1959, there were two degrees and five programs available; in 1969–70 there were seven degrees and 45 programs. There were 94 graduate students in 1961 and 741 in 1969, due to the first master&#x27;s programs being offered in 1967.

In 1969 alone, 80 new faculty members were hired, a number larger than the total number of faculty members a decade prior. Several new buildings, including but not limited to nine residence halls and five academic buildings, were constructed. Policy changes occurred as well: in 1966, the curfew for junior and senior women was abolished, and fraternities and sororities were allowed on campus. In 1970, Boyd was named Georgia&#x27;s first vice chancellor for academic development, effective once his successor was found, which occurred in 1971; it was Emory University and Duke University graduate Ward Pafford.

===Segregation===
Until 1963, the college did not admit African-American students. In 1955 and 1956 Jeff Long, a teacher at Carver High School, encouraged students to apply for admission to West Georgia. Every senior applied, and every student was denied admission on the basis of their race. President Boyd racially integrated the campus in 1963. The first Black student was Lillian Williams, a mother of 4 and teacher in the non-integrated Carroll County School System. In 2002, President Sethna apologized to the Carver class of 1955. A scholarship fund has been started for descendants of the Carver students who were denied admission. There is also a scholarship in the name of Lillian Williams, for any mothers who want to start or continue their education.

==Academics==
The university offers numerous programs of study at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral levels through the Richards College of Business, the Tanner Health System School of Nursing, the College of Education, the College of Arts, Culture, and Scientific Inquiry, The School of Communication, Film, and Media, and the Honors College. The university also offers Certificate Programs and Specialist programs for Educators to help undergraduate and graduate students better their profession. In addition, the university was one of few in the United States to hold a residential, early entrance to college opportunity for high school juniors and seniors, the Advanced Academy of Georgia. Advanced Academy students took college courses and resided on campus under the supervision of professional residential staff.
===Psychology program===
The university is one of only two public universities in the United States offering a psychology program with a humanistic and transpersonal focus. In 1967, Mike Arons, a student of Abraham Maslow, Paul Ricoeur, and Jim Klee became chair of the West Georgia psychology department. Jim Thomas, then on the psychology faculty at West Georgia, and others had asked Maslow to recommend someone to them to initiate a humanistic emphasis there, and Arons was Maslow&#x27;s recommendation.

The department has offered a Ph.D. in psychology since the fall of 2011. In February 2011 The Ph.D., &quot;Psychology: Consciousness and Society,&quot; was approved by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia.

===2019 faculty lay-offs===
In the fall semester of 2019, UWG issued non-renewal letters to numerous tenure-track faculty that informed them they would be let go at the end of the Spring 2020 semester. Student protests ensued as some students were outraged faculty were let go before considering other options. The faculty that were non-renewed/laid off remain so and have been informed the decision stands as of January 2020.

==Student life==
Students have access to 150 student organizations covering academics, cultural/international, departmental/educational, professional and honor groups, politics, science, religion, service, recreation and sports, health center, and social fraternities and sororities. In order to be a part of a fraternity or sorority, one must have a certain GPA, as well as above freshman classification.

Wolves Don&#x27;t Waste (WDW) is a student organization founded around increasing awareness of food insecurity. Students coordinate with campus dining to decrease the amount of food wasted or thrown away through food recovery, and make food available to faculty, staff, students, and community members in need.

UWG&#x27;s marching band consists of over 100 members and is known for its high energy and athleticism. Each performance finishes with the band playing and dancing to the hit tune &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;&quot;. The Jazz Percussion Group has also performed throughout Europe and the United States as well as jazz festivals and state conferences. The JPG has brought numerous honors to the university since its beginning in 2003.

The pedestrian campus also includes a library with 561,900 volumes, a gym with an eighth-mile indoor running track, computer labs, tennis courts, baseball fields, soccer fields, a nature trail, a quarter-mile (400 m) running track, two climbing walls, and basketball courts.

The university once operated a noncommercial radio station, WUWG, at 90.7 MHz. It had been on the air since 1973 as WWGC until 2001, serving all of Carrollton and Carroll County, as well as the student body of the university. Originally a diverse college radio station, it is now a listener-supported public radio affiliate of Georgia Public Broadcasting, simulcasting the GPB radio network most of the time.

In the Fall of 2009, the Mass Communications department soft-launched The WOLF Internet Radio. The station officially debuted in April 2010, after two months of limited programming from its studio in the basement of the Anthropology Building. The station&#x27;s motto is &quot;For students by students.&quot; Two grants from the Technology Fee Committee, totaling about $72,600, kick-started the station.

===Greek Village===
Acting as a small community within the larger UWG community, the Greek Village features 18 houses ranging in size. These houses are complete with a living and or chapter room, kitchen, laundry facilities, a mix of single and double bedrooms, and semi-private bathrooms. Also included within the village are outdoor green spaces, adequate parking, and a commons building. Greek Village has also recently added a pavilion, a basketball court, a volleyball court, and a fireplace with grills for everyone&#x27;s use.

The effort to create such a facility allows for the university to not only expand its housing offerings but also attract new students to UWG, making it more of a destination university. Additionally, within the Greek system at UWG, there are three different governing councils: Panhellenic, Interfraternity, and National Pan-Hellenic. In creating the Greek Village, it became possible for these different groups to share a space together for the first time.

The athletics program fields men&#x27;s intercollegiate teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, and golf and women&#x27;s teams in basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track, volleyball, and competition cheerleading. All intercollegiate sports are affiliated with NCAA Division I as a member of the ASUN Conference. In 2006, amid the Native American mascot controversy, the UWG changed its athletic nickname from the &quot;Braves&quot; to the &quot;Wolves.&quot;

<text>The University of Dubuque (UD) is a private Presbyterian university in Dubuque, Iowa. About 2,200 students attend the university.

==History==
The University of Dubuque has had a long history in Dubuque since its founding in 1852.

===Early years===
Adrian Van Vliet founded the German Theological College and Seminary, the initial predecessor to the University of Dubuque, in 1852. Van Vliet, who was pastor of the German Presbyterian Church (now known as the First Presbyterian Church of Dubuque), wanted to train ministers to serve the influx of immigrants to the upper midwest. Van Vliet believed the large number of immigrants—particularly German farmers and miners—would need ministers of the gospel for the communities they were establishing. He began by training two young men, conducting classes in his home. Although Van Vliet was Dutch, until 1896 all classes were conducted in German.

Initially the school was Van Vliet&#x27;s independent endeavor. In 1864, the Presbytery of Dubuque assumed control of the institution, and it became known as The German Theological School of The North West. In 1870 the Presbyterian Church of the United States took control of the school. In 1871, following the death of Van Vliet, Jacob Conzett was selected to lead the school. In 1872 the school moved to a brick building on the north side of 17th street, where it would remain for the next 35 years.

In 1901 Cornelius Martin Steffens came on board as financial secretary. He proved to be an outstanding fund raiser. He also helped the school expand its curriculum. A liberal arts college and academy were added to the school, and the first college degrees were granted in 1906. It was Steffens&#x27;s idea to move the school to larger quarters. Property on the western edge of the city was acquired in 1905 for that purpose. Steffens served as school president from 1908 to 1924.

The school moved to its present location on University Avenue in 1907. The first buildings constructed at this new location were the Administration Building (1907, later renamed Steffens Hall), Severance Hall (1911), the University Bookstore (1912), McCormick Gymnasium (1915), Peters Commons (1916), and Van Vliet Hall (1926). All except Steffens Hall are still standing. Steffens Hall was demolished in 1980 and replaced with Blades Hall, but some of its archways were preserved and can be seen today.

In 1911, the college became coeducational and changed names to the Dubuque Theological German College and Seminary (alternatively the German Presbyterian Theological School). In 1916, the school dropped the word &quot;German&quot; from its name, due in part to anti-German sentiment inflamed by the First World War, and became just Dubuque College. This caused controversy, however, because this was also the name of an existing college, the Catholic school now known as Loras College. After a series of court causes leading up to 1920, neither school ultimately kept the name: the preexisting Catholic school took the name of Mathias Loras, first archbishop of Dubuque while the Presbyterian school became the University of Dubuque on June 17.

===Expansion===

In the 1950s and 60s, during the administration of Gaylord Couchman, a number of building projects took place: the Seminary Library (1955), Smith Hall, a seminary residence (1956), Goldthorp Science Hall (1959), Aitchison Hall, a women&#x27;s residence (1963), Ficke-Laird Library (1966), Cassat Hall, a men&#x27;s residence (1966), and Donnell Hall, another men&#x27;s residence (1967).

McCormick Gymnasium was expanded in 1967. Another large addition to it, named the Stoltz Sports Center, was made later. The original building was also renovated to include a new indoor swimming pool, racquetball courts, a hall of fame, and a multi-purpose area.

===Controversy, change, and new leadership===
In 1999, the university informed 14 professors, 10 of whom held tenured positions, that they would lose their positions due to a financial crisis. A report by The American Association of University Professors raised concerns about this action, and the AAUP placed the university on its list of censured administrations (where it still remains). The university was granted a provisional six-year accreditation by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools due to concerns about academics in the wake of the financial crisis. In 2005, however, the university was granted a full accreditation after a lengthy review process.

In 2003 the university received an endowment to implement the Lester G. Wendt and Michael Lester Wendt Character Initiative, currently overseen by the Wendt Center for Character Education, which among other tasks encourages ethical character development of university students and integration of the same into the university curriculum. Also associated with the Wendt name was a Wendt University Professorship, granted in 2005 to Paul Jeffries, a professor of philosophy. (This is not Paul C. Jeffries, who also has a Ph.D. in philosophy, who used to be in academia but now works in technology.) As the Wendt professor, Jeffries was to oversee the initiative and &quot;speak broadly&quot; about it in the university and external community.

During the same year, Jeffries came up for a new tenure contract. The university offered him a contract, but he objected to a provision restricting negative speech about the university, which he felt could interfere with his objectivity in speaking about ethics and character. The offer of tenure was immediately revoked and Jeffries was dismissed from the university, an action that stirred considerable unrest among students and faculty.

===Continued development===
The university has completed building additional student housing on land adjacent to Dodge Street, the main east–west thoroughfare through the city. This property remained vacant for many years until the new apartments were built. Park Village apartments are typically only available to upperclassmen. The university currently has approximately 2000 students in attendance.

==Academics==
The University of Dubuque consists of a Theological Seminary and three schools:

*School of Business
*School of Liberal Arts
*School of Professional Programs

The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, the Council on Aviation Accreditation, and the Association of Theological Schools in North America. It is also approved by the State of Iowa Department of Education.

==Athletics==
The school has been involved in intercollegiate sports for many decades. The teams are called the Spartans, and the school colors are blue and white. There was a brief period, from 1925 to 1928, when the university withdrew from intercollegiate sports and focused on intramural competition. This was done because University president Karl Wettstone was opposed to the commercialization of sports and the recruiting of athletes with offers of free tuition, room, and board. There also were concerns about the salaries some coaches had received, which were felt to be excessive compared to the compensation paid other department heads. Following the reinstatement of intercollegiate competition, the University of Dubuque joined the Iowa Conference, now known as the American Rivers Conference, in 1929.

The University of Dubuque is a member of NCAA Division III, and is part of the American Rivers Conference, which, in addition to the University of Dubuque, currently includes Buena Vista University, Coe College, Central College, Luther College, Loras College, Nebraska Wesleyan University, Simpson College, and Wartburg College. Men&#x27;s varsity sports include football, baseball, basketball, cross-country, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, indoor and outdoor track, and wrestling. Women&#x27;s varsity sports include basketball, cross country, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, track, tennis, and volleyball.

In 2008, the school officially recognized its first club sports team, ice hockey. Students now have the opportunity to participate in an increasingly popular winter sport against other conference rivals including Loras and Cornell college while attending the University of Dubuque. A recent addition to club sport includes a campus Bass Fishing team which is one of the top-ranked in the country.

==Notable alumni==
Notable graduates of the University of Dubuque include Walter Soboleff, a Tlingit scholar, elder and religious leader. He was the first Native Alaskan to become an ordained Presbyterian minister. Solomon &quot;Sol&quot; Butler, a track star who set national and world records, competed in the 1920s Olympics and was one of the first black players in the National Football League as well as an early actor in Hollywood films. 1926 graduate of the university, Nemesio Rodriguez, an exchange student from Lima, Peru, later went on to become the prime minister of education for the country of Peru (he also married classmate of &#x27;26, Florence Parker), actor Tony Danza, a star of the TV sitcoms &quot;Taxi&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;; and novelist Eckhard Gerdes, author of thirteen published novels, including &quot;My Landlady the Lobotomist&quot; and &quot;Hugh Moore&quot;. George O&#x27;Leary, former football coach at the University of Central Florida played football at the university in the 1960s but did not graduate. O&#x27;Leary gained notoriety when he was hired then dropped as Notre Dame head coach when it was discovered that he fabricated his resume.

==Transportation==
The university is located west of downtown Dubuque and served by The Jule transit system. The &quot;Grey Route&quot; and &quot;AM Commuter West Route&quot; stop on University Avenue at the north edge of campus. Lamers Bus Lines stops at Blade Hall providing intercity bus service towards Madison and Milwaukee.

<text>Anthony David Leighton Scott (21 June 1944 – 19 August 2012) was a British film director and producer.

He made his theatrical film debut with &quot;The Hunger&quot; (1983) and went on to direct highly successful action and thriller films such as &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986), &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; (1987), &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; (1990), &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot; (1991), &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; (1995), &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; (1998), &quot;Man on Fire&quot; (2004), &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; (2006), &quot;The Taking of Pelham 123&quot; (2009) and &quot;Unstoppable&quot; (2010).

Scott was the younger brother of film director Ridley Scott. They both graduated from the Royal College of Art in London, and were among a generation of British film directors who were successful in Hollywood having started their careers making television commercials. In 1995, both Tony and Ridley received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema. In 2010, they received the BAFTA Britannia Award for Worldwide Contribution to Filmed Entertainment.

==Early life==
Scott was born in Tynemouth, Northumberland, North East England, the youngest of three sons of Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Williams) and Colonel Francis Percy Scott, who served in the Royal Engineers. Dixon Scott, a grand uncle, was a pioneer of the cinema chain, opening cinemas around Tyneside. One Tyneside Cinema, in Newcastle, is the last remaining newsreel cinema operating in the United Kingdom. Tony was a pupil at Rosebank School in Hartlepool, West Hartlepool College of Art and graduating from Sunderland Art School with a fine arts degree. At the age of 16, he appeared in the short film &quot;Boy and Bicycle&quot;, Ridley&#x27;s directorial debut (he was 23).

Tony Scott continued his studies in art in Leeds after failing to gain admission to the Royal College of Art in London (he would succeed in a later attempt). In 1969, he made a short film based on the Ambrose Bierce story &quot;One of the Missing&quot;. As Ridley had previously cast him in a film, Tony reciprocated by giving his brother a role in the production. &quot;The film cost £1,000&quot;, he recalled in April 2012. While at the Royal College of Art, where he was taught by Raymond Durgnat, he starred in &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk&quot;, a film by fellow students Hank Onrust and Richard Stanley. The film credits state it was &quot;made for BUNAC by MARCA films at the Royal College of Art&quot;. Again following in Ridley&#x27;s footsteps, Tony graduated from the Royal College of Art, although he intended to become a painter. Their eldest brother Frank had earlier joined the British Merchant Navy.

==Film career==
===Commercials===
The success of his elder brother&#x27;s fledgling television commercial production outfit, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), drew Tony&#x27;s attention to film. Ridley recounted, &quot;Tony had wanted to do documentaries at first. I told him, &#x27;Don&#x27;t go to the BBC, come to me first.&#x27; I knew that he had a fondness for cars, so I told him, &#x27;Come work with me and within a year you&#x27;ll have a Ferrari.&#x27; And he did!&quot; Tony recalled, &quot;I was finishing eight years at art school, and Ridley had opened Ridley Scott Associates and said, &#x27;Come and make commercials and make some money&#x27; because I owed money left and right and centre.&quot; He directed many television commercials for RSA while also overseeing the company&#x27;s operation while his brother was developing his feature film career. &quot;My goal was to make films but I got sidetracked into commercials and then I took off. I had 15 years [making them], and it was a blast. We were very prolific, and that was our training ground. You&#x27;d shoot 100 days in a year, then we gravitated from that to film,&quot; he said. Developing his own distinctive visual style while making commercials, Scott states, &quot;I cornered the market in sexy, rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll stuff.&quot;

Scott took time out in 1975 to direct a television adaptation of the Henry James story &quot;The Author of Beltraffio&quot;. After the feature film successes of fellow British directors Hugh Hudson, Alan Parker, Adrian Lyne and his elder brother during the late 1970s, all of whom had graduated from directing advertising commercials, he received initial overtures from Hollywood in 1980. His eldest brother Frank died, aged 45, of skin cancer during the same year.

===Early films===
Scott reflected on his career in 2009:

Scott persisted in trying to embark on a feature film career. Among the ideas interesting to him was an adaptation of the Anne Rice novel &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; then in development. MGM was already developing the vampire film &quot;The Hunger&quot;, and hired Scott as director in 1982. Despite starring David Bowie, Susan Sarandon and Catherine Deneuve, and having elaborate production design, it failed to find an audience or to impress the critics although it later became a cult favourite. Finding few film opportunities in Hollywood over the next two and a half years, Scott returned to commercials and music videos.

In 1985, producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer approached Scott to direct &quot;Top Gun&quot;, having been impressed by &quot;The Hunger&quot;, and a commercial he had done for Swedish automaker Saab in 1983 featuring a Saab 900 racing a Saab 37 Viggen fighter jet. Scott, initially reluctant, finally agreed to direct &quot;Top Gun&quot;. While the film received mixed critical reviews, it was a box office smash, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1986, taking in more than $350 million, and making a star of its young protagonist, Tom Cruise. Labelling &quot;Top Gun&quot; &quot;the key 1980s movie made by the British ad invasion&quot;, Sam Delaney of &quot;The Guardian&quot; writes, &quot;By the mid-80&#x27;s, Hollywood was awash with British directors who had ushered in a new era of blockbusters using the crowd-pleasing skills they&#x27;d honed in advertising. The vast resources and freedom made available to ad directors during advertising&#x27;s boom era during the 1970&#x27;s enabled them to innovate and experiment with new techniques that weren&#x27;t then possible in TV or film.&quot;

===Hollywood success===
Following the stellar success of &quot;Top Gun&quot;, Scott found himself on Hollywood&#x27;s A-list of action directors. He re-teamed with Simpson and Bruckheimer in 1987 to direct Eddie Murphy and Brigitte Nielsen in the highly anticipated sequel &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;. It left critics underwhelmed, but was among the year&#x27;s highest-grossing films. That year, in 1987, Tony Scott had signed a deal with Paramount Pictures to develop films for a non-exclusive agreement, which will serve as producers and directors on the studio. His next feature, &quot;Revenge&quot; (1990), a thriller of adultery and revenge set in Mexico, starred Kevin Costner, Madeleine Stowe and Anthony Quinn. Once again directing Tom Cruise, Scott returned to the Simpson-Bruckheimer fold to helm the big-budget racing film &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; (1990). Scott later stated that it was difficult to find the drama in racing cars in circles, so he &quot;stole from all race movies to date ... then tried to build on them.&quot; Scott&#x27;s next film was the cult action thriller &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot; (1991) starring Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans and written by Shane Black.

In 1993, Scott directed &quot;True Romance&quot; costing just $13 million, from a script by Quentin Tarantino. The cast included Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, Val Kilmer, James Gandolfini and Samuel L. Jackson. Although it received positive reviews from Janet Maslin and other critics, it earned less than it cost to make and was considered a box office failure, although it has since attained cult status. For his next film, &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; (1995), Scott again teamed up with producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. A submarine thriller starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman, it was critically and commercially well received. It marked 
the first of four collaborations with Washington.

In 1995, Shepperton Studios was purchased by a consortium headed by Tony and Ridley Scott, which extensively renovated the studios – located in Britain – while also expanding and improving its grounds. In 1996, Scott directed &quot;The Fan&quot;, starring Robert De Niro, Wesley Snipes, Ellen Barkin and Benicio del Toro. His 1998 film &quot;Enemy of the State&quot;, a conspiracy thriller, starred Will Smith and Gene Hackman, and was his highest-grossing film of the decade. &quot;Spy Game&quot; was released in November 2001, and garnered 63% positive reviews at Metacritic and topped $60 million at the U.S. box office. Scott subsequently directed another thriller starring Denzel Washington, &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, released in April 2004.

Tony teamed up with Ridley to co-produce the TV series &quot;Numb3rs&quot;, which aired from 2005 to 2010, with Tony directing the first episode of the fourth season. In 2006, he contributed voice-over to a song called &quot;Dreamstalker&quot; on Hybrid&#x27;s album &quot;I Choose Noise&quot;; Scott collaborated with Hybrid on several films through their mutual friend, the highly successful film score composer Harry Gregson-Williams.

In 2005, Tony Scott directed &quot;Domino&quot;, starring Keira Knightley. While notable for its use of experimental film techniques, it was drubbed by critics and rejected by audiences. In autumn 2006, Scott again worked with Denzel Washington, this time on a sci-fi action film, &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;. The two collaborated again on &quot;The Taking of Pelham 123&quot;, a remake of the 1974 film of the same title, and which also starred John Travolta. It was released on 12 June 2009. In 2009, Tony and Ridley Scott were executive producers for &quot;The Good Wife&quot;, a legal drama television series.

In 2010, the Scott brothers produced the feature film adaptation of the television series &quot;The A-Team&quot;. The same year, Scott collaborated again with Denzel Washington on &quot;Unstoppable&quot;, which also starred Chris Pine, and hit the screens in November.

Shortly before his death, Tony Scott produced &quot;Coma&quot;, a medical thriller miniseries, the Coca-Cola short film &quot;The Polar Bears&quot; and the thrillers &quot;Stoker&quot; and &quot;The East&quot;, the latter two with his brother, Ridley.

===Unrealised projects===
Tom Cruise was with Scott just two days prior to the director&#x27;s suicide, scouting locations for a sequel to &quot;Top Gun&quot;, scheduled for production in 2013. In December 2012, Paramount announced that the project was officially cancelled, but they would go ahead with a 3D IMAX remastering of the original &quot;Top Gun,&quot; which was released on 8 February 2013. In June 2013, it was confirmed by Bruckheimer that &quot;Top Gun 2&quot; had been greenlighted once again, with Joseph Kosinski announced as the project&#x27;s new director in June 2017. The film, &quot;Top Gun: Maverick,&quot; was released on 27 May 2022, and was both a critical and financial success, and is the second-highest grossing film of 2022. &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; was posthumously dedicated to Scott.

At the time of his death, Scott was also slated to direct &quot;Narco Sub&quot;, from a script by David Guggenheim and Mark Bomback, about &quot;a disgraced American naval officer forced to pilot a sub carrying a payload of cocaine to America&quot;, and the action film &quot;Lucky Strike&quot;, with Vince Vaughn slated to star. Scott also considered a remake of the classic western &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969), and an adaptation of the comic book limited series &quot;Nemesis&quot; by Mark Millar.

==Directing style==
Katey Rich of &quot;Cinema Blend&quot; wrote that Scott had a &quot;trademark frenetic camera style&quot;, which Scott spoke about in June 2009, in reference to &quot;The Taking of Pelham 123&quot;:

Scott also spoke about his career in general:

Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Scott was &quot;one of the most influential film directors of the past 25 years, if also one of the most consistently and egregiously underloved by critics&quot; and called him &quot;[o]ne of the pop futurists of the contemporary blockbuster.&quot; She felt that &quot;[t]here was plenty about his work that was problematic and at times offensive, yet it could have terrific pop, vigour, beauty and a near pure cinema quality. These were, more than anything, films by someone who wanted to pull you in hard and never let you go.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;the propulsive, at times borderline preposterous popcorn-thriller storylines; the slice-and-dice editing and the images that somehow managed to glow with grit; the fireball violence, often glimpsed in smeary-techno telephoto shots; the way he had of making actors seem volatile and dynamic and, at the same time, lacking almost any subtext&quot; were qualities of Scott&#x27;s films that both &quot;excited audiences about his work&quot; and &quot;kept him locked outside the gates of critical respectability.&quot;

Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that after &quot;Top Gun&quot;, Scott &quot;found his commercial niche as a brash, flashy, sometimes vulgar action painter on celluloid,&quot; citing &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;, &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot;, &quot;True Romance&quot;, and &quot;The Fan&quot; as examples. McCarthy concluded that &quot;Unstoppable&quot;, Scott&#x27;s final film, was one of his best. Apart from having &quot;its director&#x27;s fingerprints all over it—the commitment to extreme action, frenetic cutting, stripped-down dialogue&quot;—McCarthy found &quot;a social critique embedded in its guts; it was about disconnected working class stiffs living marginal lives on society&#x27;s sidings, about the barely submerged anger of a neglected underclass,&quot; something which &quot;always had been lacking from Tony Scott&#x27;s work, some connection to the real world rather than just silly flyboy stuff and meaningful glances accompanied by this year&#x27;s pop music hit.&quot; Betsy Sharkey of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Denzel Washington—who starred in &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, &quot;The Taking of Pelham 123&quot;, and &quot;Unstoppable&quot;—was Scott&#x27;s , and Scott &quot;was at his best when Washington was in the picture. The characters the actor played are the archetype of the kind of men Scott made. At their core, and what guided all the actions that followed, was a fundamental decency. They were flawed men to be sure, some more than others, but men who accorded dignity to anyone who deserved it.&quot;

==Personal life==
Scott married three times. His first marriage was to TV production designer Gerry Boldy (1944–2007) in 1967; they were divorced in 1974. His second marriage was in 1986 to advertising executive Glynis Sanders; they divorced a year later when his affair with Brigitte Nielsen (married to Sylvester Stallone at the time), whom he met on the set of &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;, became public. He subsequently met film and TV actress Donna Wilson, who was 24 years his junior, on the set of &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; in 1990 and they married in 1994. She gave birth to their twin sons, Frank and Max, in 2000.

==Death==
On 19 August 2012, at approximately 12:30 pm PDT, Scott jumped off the Vincent Thomas Bridge in the San Pedro port district of Los Angeles. Investigators from the Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s Harbor Division found contact information in a note left in his car, parked on the bridge, and a note at his office for his family. One witness said he did not hesitate before jumping, but another said he looked nervous before climbing a fence, hesitating for two seconds before jumping. He landed beside a tour boat. His body was recovered from the water by the Los Angeles Port Police. On 22 August, Los Angeles County coroner&#x27;s spokesman Ed Winters said the two notes Scott left behind made no mention of any health problems, but neither the police nor the family disclosed the content of those notes.

On 22 October 2012, the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s Office announced the cause of death as &quot;multiple blunt force injuries&quot;. Therapeutic levels of the antidepressant mirtazapine and the sleep aid eszopiclone were in his system at the time of death. A coroner&#x27;s official said Scott &quot;did not have any serious underlying medical conditions&quot; and that there was &quot;no anatomic evidence of neoplasia [cancer] identified&quot;.

In a November 2014 interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, Ridley Scott described his brother&#x27;s death as &quot;inexplicable&quot;, saying that Tony had been &quot;fighting a lengthy battle with cancer—a diagnosis the family elected to keep private during his treatments and in the immediate wake of his death&quot;, yet mentioning &quot;his recovery&quot;. A November 2023 profile of Ridley Scott by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; mentions that Tony Scott called his brother, who was filming in France, moments before jumping from the bridge. Noticing that he was downbeat but unaware of the situation Tony was facing, Ridley tried to energize him about work: &quot;I said, &#x27;Have you made your mind up about this film yet? Get going! Let&#x27;s get you into a movie.&#x27;&quot;

===Funeral and legacy===
The family announced they had established a scholarship fund at the American Film Institute in Scott&#x27;s name, stating, &quot;The family ask that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the fund to help encourage and engage future generations of filmmakers.&quot; He was cremated and his ashes were interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery on 24 August in Los Angeles. Subsequently, it was reported that he had left his estate to his family trust.

Many actors paid tribute to him, including Tom Cruise, Christian Slater, Val Kilmer, Eddie Murphy, Denzel Washington, Gene Hackman, Elijah Wood, Dane Cook, Dwayne Johnson, Stephen Fry, Peter Fonda and Keira Knightley, as well as musical collaborators Hybrid. Cruise complimented Scott as &quot;a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable.&quot; Denzel Washington, Scott&#x27;s most frequent acting collaborator, said, &quot;Tony Scott was a great director, a genuine friend and it is unfathomable to think that he is now gone.&quot; Directors UK chairman Charles Sturridge said Scott was &quot;a brilliant British director with an extraordinary ability to create energy on screen, both in action and in the creation of character.&quot;

The first episode of &quot;Coma&quot; and the first episode of season 4 of &quot;The Good Wife&quot; were dedicated to his memory, as were his brother Ridley&#x27;s films &quot;The Counselor&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Ridley also paid tribute to Tony at the 2016 Golden Globes, after his film, &quot;The Martian&quot;, won Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.

The end credits of &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; (2022) include a dedication to Scott. Lady Gaga&#x27;s performance of the film&#x27;s Oscar-nominated song &quot;Hold My Hand&quot; at the 95th Academy Awards likewise included a tribute to the late director. He had been working on the film before his death.

<text>The Pteridales were an order of ferns that have their sori in linear strips under the edge of the leaf tissue, usually with the edge of the lamina reflexed over.

This order was reduced to the family Pteridaceae under the Smith classification of 2006, a position maintained in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I).

<text>The year 1992 in [[science]] and technology involved many significant events, some listed below.

==Anthropology==
* June – British anthropologist Robin Dunbar proposes Dunbar&#x27;s number (approximately 150) as a cognitive limit to the number of people with whom an interpersonal relationship can be maintained in human communities.

==Astronomy==
* January 5 – Asteroid 5751 Zao is discovered by Masahiro Koishikawa.

<doc id="595342" wikidata="Q2628740" url="?curid=595342" title="Cheilanthes">
<text>Cheilanthes, commonly known as lip ferns, is a genus of about 180 species of rock-dwelling ferns with a cosmopolitan distribution in warm, dry, rocky regions, often growing in small crevices high up on cliffs. Most are small, sturdy and evergreen. The leaves, often densely covered in trichomes, spring directly from the rootstocks. Many of them are desert ferns, curling up during dry times and reviving with the coming of moisture. At the ends of veins sporangia, or spore-bearing structures, are protected by leaf margins, which curl over them.

==Taxonomy==
The genus name is derived from the Greek words χεῖλος (&quot;cheilos&quot;), meaning &quot;lip,&quot; and ἄνθος (&quot;anthos&quot;), meaning &quot;flower.&quot;

&quot;Cheilanthes&quot; as traditionally circumscribed is now known to be highly paraphyletic, comprising at least four generically separate groups. The type species, &quot;C. micropteris&quot;, is most closely allied to the genera &quot;Aleuritopteris&quot; and &quot;Sinopteris&quot; (Schuettpelz &quot;et al.&quot;). In the early 21st century, many species, principally from the New World, were moved into the new genus &quot;Gaga&quot; and the revived genus &quot;Myriopteris&quot;. Further work remains to be done to render &quot;Cheilanthes&quot; monophyletic. Members of many other cheilanthoid genera have at times been given names in the genus.

==Species==
The circumscription of the genus was uncertain . The &quot;Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World&quot; lists species in several distinct groups.

&quot;Cheilanthes&quot; sensu stricto contains about 20 species from North and tropical Central and South America:

*&quot;Cheilanthes arequipensis&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes fractifera&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes glutinosa&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes incarum&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes incisa&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes juergensii&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes laciniata&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes leonardii&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes leucopoda&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes lonchophylla&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes macleanii&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes mathewsii&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes micropteris&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes pantanalensis&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes peruviana&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes poeppigiana&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes rufopunctata&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes sarmientoi&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes spiculata&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes squamosa&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes volcanensis&quot; 
&quot;Cheilanthes&quot; sensu lato contains about 50 species that molecular phylogenetic studies suggest do not form a clade with the core &quot;Cheilanthes&quot; species, falling into separate clades, but for which no placement outside &quot;Cheilanthes&quot; was available :
*&quot;Cheilanthes adiantoides&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes angustifrondosa&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes austrotenuifolia&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes bergiana&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes boivinii&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes bolborrhiza&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes bonapartei&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes botswanae&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes brownii&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes buchananii&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes capensis&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes caudata&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes ceterachoides&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes contracta&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes deboeri&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes deltoidea&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes depauperata&quot; 
*&quot;Cheilanthes dinteri&quot;

<text>Alasdair Chalmers MacIntyre (; born 12 January 1929) is a Scottish-American philosopher who has contributed to moral and political philosophy as well as history of philosophy and theology. MacIntyre&#x27;s &quot;After Virtue&quot; (1981) is one of the most important works of Anglophone moral and political philosophy in the 20th century. He is senior research fellow at the Centre for Contemporary Aristotelian Studies in Ethics and Politics (CASEP) at London Metropolitan University, emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, and permanent senior distinguished research fellow at the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture. During his lengthy academic career, he also taught at Brandeis University, Duke University, Vanderbilt University, and Boston University.

==Biography==
MacIntyre was born on 12 January 1929 in Glasgow, to Eneas and Greta (Chalmers) MacIntyre. He was educated at Queen Mary College, London, and has a Master of Arts degree from the University of Manchester and from the University of Oxford. He began his teaching career in 1951 at Manchester. He married Ann Peri, with whom he had two daughters, Jean and Toni. He taught at the University of Leeds, the University of Essex and the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, before moving to the US in around 1969. MacIntyre has been something of an intellectual nomad, having taught at many universities in the US. He has held the following positions:
*Professor of History of Ideas, Brandeis University (1969 or 1970),
* Dean of the College of Arts and professor of philosophy, Boston University (1972),
*Henry Luce Professor, Wellesley College (1980),
*W. Alton Jones Professor, Vanderbilt University (1982),
*Professor of Philosophy, University of Notre Dame (1985),
*Professor of Philosophy, Vanderbilt University (1985),
*Visiting scholar, Whitney Humanities Center, Yale University (1988),
*McMahon-Hank Professor of Philosophy, Notre Dame (1989), and
*Arts &amp; Sciences Professor of Philosophy, Duke University (1995–1997).
He has also been a visiting professor at Princeton University and is a former president of the American Philosophical Association. In 2010, he was awarded the Aquinas Medal by the American Catholic Philosophical Association. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected 1985), the British Academy (1994), the Royal Irish Academy (1999), and the American Philosophical Society (2005).

From 2000 he was the Rev. John A. O&#x27;Brien Senior Research Professor in the Department of Philosophy (emeritus since 2010) at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, US. He is also professor emerit and emeritus at Duke University. In July 2010 he became senior research fellow at London Metropolitan University&#x27;s Centre for Contemporary Aristotelian Studies in Ethics and Politics. Since his retirement from active teaching in 2010, he remains the senior distinguished research fellow of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture, where he retains an office. He continues to make public presentations, including an annual keynote as part of the Center for Ethics and Culture&#x27;s Fall Conference.

He has been married three times. From 1953 to 1963 he was married to Ann Peri, with whom he had two daughters. From 1963 to 1977 he was married to former teacher and now poet Susan Willans, with whom he had a son and daughter. Since 1977 he has been married to philosopher Lynn Joy, who is also on the philosophy faculty at Notre Dame.

==Philosophical approach==
MacIntyre&#x27;s approach to moral philosophy interweaves a number of complex strands. Although he largely aims to revive an Aristotelian moral philosophy based on the virtues, he claims a &quot;peculiarly modern understanding&quot; of this task.

This &quot;peculiarly modern understanding&quot; largely concerns MacIntyre&#x27;s approach to moral disputes. Unlike some analytic philosophers who try to generate moral consensus on the basis of rationality, MacIntyre uses the historical development of ethics to circumvent the modern problem of &quot;incommensurable&quot; moral notions, whose merits cannot be compared in any common framework. Following Hegel and Collingwood, he offers a &quot;philosophical history&quot; (as opposed to analytical and phenomenological approaches) in which he concedes from the beginning that &quot;there are no neutral standards available by appeal to which any rational agent whatsoever could determine&quot; the conclusions of moral philosophy.

In his most famous work, &quot;After Virtue&quot;, he deprecates the attempt of Enlightenment thinkers to deduce a universal rational morality independent of teleology, whose failure led to the rejection of moral rationality altogether by successors such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Charles Stevenson. He emphasizes how this overestimation of reason led to Nietzsche&#x27;s utter repudiation of the possibility of moral rationality.

By contrast, MacIntyre attempts to reclaim more modest forms of moral rationality and argumentation which claim neither finality nor logical certainty, but which can hold up against relativistic or emotivist denials of any moral rationality whatsoever (the mistaken conclusion of Nietzsche, Sartre, and Stevenson). He revives the tradition of Aristotelian ethics with its teleological account of the good and of moral actions, as fulfilled in the medieval writings of Thomas Aquinas. This Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition, he proposes, presents &quot;the best theory so far,&quot; both of how things are and how we ought to act.

More generally, according to MacIntyre, moral disputes always take place within and between rival traditions of thought relying on an inherited store of ideas, presuppositions, types of arguments and shared understandings and approaches. Even though there is no definitive way for one tradition in moral philosophy to logically refute another, nevertheless opposing views can dispute each other&#x27;s internal coherence, resolution of imaginative dilemmas and epistemic crises, and achievement of fruitful results.

==Major writings==

===&quot;After Virtue&quot; (1981)===
Probably his most widely read work, &quot;After Virtue&quot; was written when MacIntyre was already in his fifties. Up to then, MacIntyre had been a relatively influential analytic philosopher of a Marxist bent whose moral inquiries had been conducted in a &quot;piecemeal way, focusing first on this problem and then on that, in a mode characteristic of much analytic philosophy.&quot; However, after reading the works of Thomas Kuhn and Imre Lakatos on philosophy of science and epistemology, MacIntyre was inspired to change the entire direction of his thought, tearing up the manuscript he had been working on and deciding to view the problems of modern moral and political philosophy &quot;not from the standpoint of liberal modernity, but instead from the standpoint of… Aristotelian moral and political practice.&quot;

In general terms, the task of &quot;After Virtue&quot; is to account both for the dysfunction of modern moral discourse in modern society and to rehabilitate the alternative of teleological rationality in Aristotelian virtue ethics. MacIntyre&#x27;s philippic articulates a politics of self-defence for local communities who aspire to protect their traditional way of life from the corrosive capitalist free market.

===&quot;Whose Justice? Which Rationality?&quot; (1988)===
MacIntyre&#x27;s second major work of his mature period takes up the problem of giving an account of philosophical rationality within the context of his notion of &quot;traditions,&quot; which had still remained under-theorized in &quot;After Virtue&quot;. Specifically, MacIntyre argues that rival and largely incompatible conceptions of justice are the outcome of rival and largely incompatible forms of practical rationality. These competing forms of practical rationality and their attendant ideas of justice are in turn the result of &quot;socially embodied traditions of rational inquiry.&quot; Although MacIntyre&#x27;s treatment of traditions is quite complex he does give a relatively concise definition: &quot;A tradition is an argument extended through time in which certain fundamental agreements are defined and redefined&quot; in terms of both internal and external debates.

Much of &quot;Whose Justice? Which Rationality?&quot; is therefore engaged in the task of not only giving the reader examples of what MacIntyre considers actual rival traditions and the different ways they can split apart, integrate, or defeat one another (e.g. Aristotelian, Augustinian, Thomist, Humean) but also with substantiating how practical rationality and a conception of justice help constitute those traditions. Specifically, according to him, the differing accounts of justice that are presented by Aristotle and Hume are due to the underlying differences in their conceptual schemes. MacIntyre argues that despite their incommensurability there are various ways in which alien traditions might engage one another rationally – most especially via a form of immanent critique which makes use of empathetic imagination to then put the rival tradition into &quot;epistemic crisis&quot; but also by being able to solve shared or analogous problems and dilemmas from within one&#x27;s own tradition which remain insoluble from the rival approach.

MacIntyre&#x27;s account also defends three further theses: first, that all rational human inquiry is conducted whether knowingly or not from within a tradition; second, that the incommensurable conceptual schemes of rival traditions do not entail either relativism or perspectivism; third, that although the arguments of the book are themselves attempts at universally valid insights they are nevertheless given from within a particular tradition (that of Thomist Aristotelianism) and that this need not imply any philosophical inconsistency.

===&quot;Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry&quot; (1990)===
&quot;Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry&quot; was first presented by MacIntyre as part of the Gifford lecture series at the University of Edinburgh in 1988 and is considered by many the third part in a trilogy of philosophical argumentation that commenced with &quot;After Virtue&quot;. As its title implies, MacIntyre&#x27;s aim in this book is to examine three major rival traditions of moral inquiry on the intellectual scene today (encyclopaedic, genealogical and traditional) which each in turn was given defence from a canonical piece published in the late nineteenth century (the Ninth Edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Genealogy of Morals&quot; and Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s &quot;Aeterni Patris&quot;, respectively).

MacIntyre&#x27;s book ultimately conducts a complex series of both interior and exterior critiques of the encyclopaedic and genealogical positions in an attempt to vindicate philosophical Thomism as the most persuasive form of moral inquiry currently on offer. His critique in chapter IX of Nietzsche&#x27;s and Michel Foucault&#x27;s genealogical mode as implicitly committed to an emancipatory and continuous notion of self which they cannot account for on their own terms has been of particular influence.

The tradition-bound account of rational inquiry MacIntyre articulates and deploys throughout these lectures suggests reforms, which he explores in chapter X, both for the lecture as a genre and for the university as an institution, outlining the concept of a &quot;postliberal university of constrained disagreement&quot;.
To advance rational inquiry, MacIntyre argues that lectures ought to take account of the tradition-constituted roles both of lecturer and of student. Lecturers as members of explicitly articulated traditions should engage students, recognized as standing in various relationships to the lecturer&#x27;s own and/or rival traditions, on material situated in the historically contextualised progress of the lecturer&#x27;s home tradition. In support of such lectures and of tradition-bound inquiry on the research front, universities should become forums for growing and engaging rival traditions. For students, such forums would invite intentional formation within a tradition, and support learning how to profitably confront rival traditions through imaginative participation in them. For researchers, inquiry at the frontier must advance toward holistic, inter-disciplinary accounts, at once both theoretical and practical, undertaken together by members of communities of practitioners bound together in traditions. Such tradition-bound inquiry contributes to the advancement of researchers&#x27; host traditions on their own terms. Moreover, undertaking such inquiry in a reformed university setting would support encounters among host traditions and their rivals, and thus visibility as traditions both to themselves and to others through imaginative engagement with rival perspectives. The public hosting of such engagements at suitably-reformed universities, including opportunities for agreement from complementary perspectives and for sharpening differences, would support both adjudication among the mutual claims to rational superiority among rival traditions, and initiation of students into the skill sets required to profitably join and assess such encounters.

===&quot;Dependent Rational Animals&quot; (1999)===

While &quot;After Virtue&quot; attempted to give an account of the virtues exclusively by recourse to social practices and the understanding of individual selves in light of &quot;quests&quot; and &quot;traditions,&quot; &quot;Dependent Rational Animals&quot; was a self-conscious effort by MacIntyre to ground virtues in an account of biology. MacIntyre writes the following of this shift in the preface to the book: &quot;Although there is indeed good reason to repudiate important elements in Aristotle&#x27;s biology, I now judge that I was in error in supposing an ethics independent of biology to be possible.&quot;

More specifically, &quot;Dependent Rational Animals&quot; tries to make a holistic case on the basis of our best current knowledge (as opposed to an ahistorical, foundational claim) that &quot;human vulnerability and disability&quot; are the &quot;central features of human life&quot; and that Thomistic &quot;virtues of dependency&quot; are needed for individual human beings to flourish in their passage from stages of infancy to adulthood and old age. As MacIntyre puts it: 
It is most often to others that we owe our survival, let alone our flourishing ... It will be a central thesis of this book that the virtues that we need, if we are to develop from our animal condition into that of independent rational agents, and the virtues that we need, if we are to confront and respond to vulnerability and disability both in ourselves and in others, belong to one and the same set of virtues, the distinctive virtues of dependent rational animals
Engaging with scientific texts on human biology as well as works of philosophical anthropology, MacIntyre identifies the human species as existing on a continuous scale of both intelligence and dependency with other animals such as dolphins. One of his main goals is to undermine what he sees as the fiction of the disembodied, independent reasoner who determines ethical and moral questions autonomously and what he calls the &quot;illusion of self-sufficiency&quot; that runs through much of Western ethics culminating in Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Übermensch&quot;. In its place he tries to show that our embodied dependencies are a definitive characteristic of our species and reveal the need for certain kinds of virtuous dispositions if we are ever to flourish into independent reasoners capable of weighing the intellectual intricacies of moral philosophy in the first place.

==Virtue ethics==
MacIntyre is a key figure in the recent surge of interest in virtue ethics, which identifies the central question of morality as having to do with the habits and knowledge concerning how to live a good life. His approach seeks to demonstrate that good judgment emanates from good character. Being a good person is not about seeking to follow formal rules. In elaborating this approach, MacIntyre understands himself to be reworking the Aristotelian idea of an ethical teleology.

MacIntyre emphasizes the importance of moral goods defined in respect to a community engaged in a &#x27;practice&#x27;—which he calls &#x27;internal goods&#x27; or &#x27;goods of excellence&#x27;—rather than focusing on the practice-independent obligation of a moral agent (deontological ethics) or the consequences of a particular act (utilitarianism). Before its recent resurgence, virtue ethics in European/American academia had been primarily associated with pre-modern philosophers (e.g. Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas). MacIntyre has argued that Aquinas&#x27; synthesis of Augustinianism with Aristotelianism is more insightful than modern moral theories by focusing upon the telos (&#x27;end&#x27;, or completion) of social practice and of human life, within the context of which the morality of acts may be evaluated. His seminal work in the area of virtue ethics can be found in his 1981 book, &quot;After Virtue&quot;.

MacIntyre intends the idea of virtue to supplement, rather than replace, moral rules. Indeed, he describes certain moral rules as &#x27;exceptionless&#x27; or unconditional. MacIntyre considers his work to be outside &quot;virtue ethics&quot; due to his affirmation of virtues as embedded in specific, historically grounded, social practices.

==Politics==
:See also: New Monasticism
Politically, MacIntyre&#x27;s ethics informs a defense of the Aristotelian &#x27;goods of excellence&#x27; internal to practices against the modern pursuit of &#x27;external goods&#x27;, such as money, power, and status, that are characteristic of rule-based, utilitarian, Weberian modern institutions. He has been described as a &#x27;revolutionary Aristotelian&#x27; because he attempted to combine historical insights from his Marxist past with those of Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle after MacIntyre&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism. For him, liberalism and postmodern consumerism not only justify capitalism but also sustain and inform it over the long term. At the same time, he says that &quot;Marxists have always fallen back into relatively straightforward versions of Kantianism or utilitarianism&quot; (&quot;After Virtue&quot;, p. 261) and criticizes Marxism as just another form of radical individualism. He says about Marxists that &quot;as they move towards power, they always tend to become Weberians.&quot; Informed by that critique, Aristotelianism loses its sense of elitist complacency; moral excellence ceases to be part of a particular, historical practice in ancient Greece and becomes a universal quality of those who understand that good judgment emanates from good character.

In 1951 in student debates at Manchester, MacIntyre described himself as a Disraeli Tory but later was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (leaving in 1956), briefly of the Socialist Labour League, and later of the Socialist Review Group/International Socialists.

==Religion==
MacIntyre converted to Catholicism in the early 1980s, and now does his work against the background of what he calls an &quot;Augustinian Thomist approach to moral philosophy.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Prospect&quot;, MacIntyre explains that his conversion to Catholicism occurred in his fifties as a &quot;result of being convinced of Thomism while attempting to disabuse his students of its authenticity.&quot; Also, in his book &quot;Whose Justice, Which Rationality?&quot; there is a section towards the end that is perhaps autobiographical when he explains how one is chosen by a tradition and may reflect his own conversion to Catholicism.

Fuller accounts of MacIntyre&#x27;s view of the relationship between philosophy and religion in general and Thomism and Catholicism in particular can be found in his essays &quot;Philosophy recalled to its tasks&quot; and &quot;Truth as a good&quot; (both found in the collection &quot;The Tasks of Philosophy&quot;) as well as in the survey of the Catholic philosophical tradition he gives in &quot;God, Philosophy and Universities&quot;.

<text>Robert William Bishop (born July 13, 1951) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2003 to 2021. A member of the Republican Party, he became the dean of Utah&#x27;s congressional delegation after the retirement of Orrin Hatch from the U.S. Senate in 2019.

Prior to his congressional tenure, Bishop was a Utah State Representative (1978–1994), including two final years as Speaker of the Utah House of Representatives, as well as Chair of the Utah Republican Party (1997–2001). He was a candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Utah as Thomas Wright&#x27;s running mate in the 2020 election.

==Early life and education==
Bishop was born in Kaysville, Utah, and graduated from Davis High School. He served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Germany from 1970 until 1972. Bishop received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in 1974.

== Career ==
He taught civics classes at Brigham City&#x27;s Box Elder High School from 1974 to 1980; he next taught German in Ogden, Utah at Ben Lomond High School; then he returned to teaching government and history classes at Box Elder High School until his retirement from teaching in 2002. While a teacher at Box Elder, Bishop partnered with the Close Up Foundation to help students participate in Close Up&#x27;s Washington, D.C.–based civic education programs.

===Utah politics===
Bishop was a member of the Utah House of Representatives from 1978 to 1994. He was House Majority Leader and later served as Speaker of the House from 1992 until 1994.

In 1997, he was elected chairman of the Utah Republican Party, and served for two terms in this position. He has also worked as a legislative lobbyist in Washington.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 2002, Bishop returned to politics when he ran for the Republican nomination in the 1st District. 22-year incumbent Jim Hansen had recently announced his retirement. At the state Republican convention, he finished first in the seven-candidate field and went on to face State Representative Kevin Garn in a primary. He defeated Garn in that primary with 59.8 percent of the vote, all but assuring him of being the next congressman from this heavily Republican district. As expected, he won the general election with 61% of the vote. He has won re-election in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 with even larger margins. In 2014, he was reelected with 64% of the vote.

In the 2016 election cycle, 92.6% of contributions to Bishop&#x27;s political campaign came from outside Utah, the highest out-of-state percentage of any member of the House, with much of the contributions coming from the energy and agribusiness sectors, according to an analysis by OpenSecrets.

===Political positions===
==== Federalism ====
In 2010 Bishop introduced to the House an amendment to the United States Constitution, known as the &quot;repeal amendment,&quot; which would allow a majority vote of the states to overturn any act of the United States Congress.

==== Land use and the environment ====
Bishop supports repeal of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, saying it has been &quot;hijacked&quot; to control land and block economic development, and that he &quot;would love to invalidate&quot; the law. Bishop is among those most critical of the Antiquities Act. Bishop opposed the designation of the Bears Ears National Monument and supports repealing or shrinking the designation. Bishop supports transferring federal public lands to the states. Despite this, Bishop sponsored a successful amendment to the 2006 National Defense Authorization Act to create the Cedar Mountain Wilderness, specifically to block transportation access to the Private Fuel Storage nuclear storage facility on Goshute&#x27;s Skull Valley Indian Reservation land in Tooele County.

In February 2011, Bishop introduced a budget amendment that would have defunded the National Landscape Conservation System, which manages 27 million acres of Bureau of Land Management land, including the National Monument, National Conservation Area, National Wilderness Preservation, National Wild and Scenic Rivers, National Scenic Trail, National Historic Trail systems and other systems. After coming under fire for introducing this amendment, Bishop withdrew it.

On April 10, 2013, Bishop introduced the Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act. The bill would amend the Antiquities Act of 1906 to subject national monument declarations by the President to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). At present, the President of the United States can unilaterally designate areas of federally-owned land as a national monument, whereas national parks and other areas are required to be enacted into law by the United States Congress. Bishop argued that &quot;the American people deserve the opportunity to participate in land-use decisions regardless of whether they are made in Congress or by the President&quot;. He claims his new bill would ensure &quot;that new national monuments are created openly with consideration of public input&quot;.

In March 2019, Bishop said that &quot;the ideas behind the Green New Deal are tantamount to genocide&quot;. Asked to elaborate how this was similar to genocide, Bishop answered, &quot;I’m an ethnic. I’m a westerner.&quot; Asked whether he believed that the Green New Deal would kill him, Bishop said, &quot;If you actually implement everything they want to. Killing would be positive if you implement everything the Green New Deal actually wants to. That’s why the Green New Deal is not ready for prime time.&quot;

==== Utah GOP closed primary ====
Bishop was chairman of the Utah Republican Party when the decision was made to close primaries to nonparty members in the late 1990s. The Utah Democratic party holds open primaries. When asked about Democrats changing their party affiliation to vote in the 2020 Republican primary, he replied &quot;instead of piddling around with the Republican primary. Doing it this way ... the best you can call it is dishonorable. It really is a slimy way of doing things.&quot; He said the only reason Democrats are attempting to &quot;pervert the process&quot; is to help advance a candidate. &quot;That&#x27;s inherently wrong,&quot; Bishop said. In an editorial, Bishop restated his view: &quot;A leading Democrat wants to create havoc in the system. For what aim? Maybe to elect the &#x27;correct&#x27; candidates? Maybe to help Democrats have a bigger voice in the elections?&quot;

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Natural Resources – Ranking Member
** Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation
* House Armed Services Committee

===Caucus memberships===
* Tenth Amendment Task Force (Co-Founder)
* Second Amendment Task Force
* Congressional Lupus Caucus
* House GOP Policy Committee (Vice Chair)
* Co-founder of the Western States Coalition
* past Chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus
* Tea Party Caucus
* Republican Study Committee
* House Baltic Caucus
*Congressional Constitution Caucus (Co-Chair)
*Congressional Western Caucus 
*United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus

===Electoral history===
== Lieutenant gubernatorial candidacy ==
Bishop announced in July 2019 that he would not seek reelection to the House in 2020. He mentioned the same year that he was considering running for governor, but considered himself a &quot;horrible&quot; candidate.

He joined Thomas Wright&#x27;s ticket as a candidate for lieutenant governor in the 2020 Utah gubernatorial election but later lost the primary.

==Personal life==
Bishop is married to Jeralynn Hansen, a former Miss Peach Queen for Brigham City, Utah. He and his family reside in Brigham City. The Bishops have four sons and one daughter.

Well known for his three-piece suits, Bishop was named the third-best-dressed congressmen in 2012 according to the Washingtonian.

<text>WWE Judgment Day was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), a professional wrestling promotion based in Connecticut. It was first held as the 25th In Your House PPV in October 1998. The event was then brought back as its own PPV in May 2000, replacing Over the Edge, and subsequently became the annual May PPV until 2009. The 2002 event was the company&#x27;s first PPV held under the WWE name, following a renaming of the company from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to WWE earlier that same month. Judgment Day was discontinued after its 2009 event and was replaced by Over the Limit in 2010.

To coincide with the brand extension, the event was made exclusive to the SmackDown brand from 2004 to 2006. Following WrestleMania 23 in April 2007, brand-exclusive PPVs were discontinued.

==History==
Judgment Day was first held as an In Your House pay-per-view (PPV) event. In Your House was a series of monthly PPVs first produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in May 1995. They aired when the promotion was not holding one of its major PPVs and were sold at a lower cost. Judgment Day: In Your House was the 25th In Your House event and took place on October 18, 1998, at the Rosemont Horizon in Rosemont, Illinois.

The In Your House branding was retired following February 1999&#x27;s St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre: In Your House. As a result of the death of WWF wrestler Owen Hart at 1999&#x27;s Over the Edge PPV, which was held in May, the Over the Edge PPV chronology was canceled and Judgment Day was reinstated as its own PPV the following year, being held on May 21, 2000, at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky. This second Judgment Day event established Judgment Day as the promotion&#x27;s annual May PPV.

In May 2002, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as a result of a lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund over the &quot;WWF&quot; initialism. Judgment Day 2002 was in turn the very first PPV produced by the promotion to be held under the WWE name.

In March 2002, the promotion held a draft that split its roster into two distinctive brands of wrestling, Raw and SmackDown!, where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform—a third brand, ECW, was added in 2006. Both the 2002 and 2003 Judgment Day events featured wrestlers from both the Raw and SmackDown! brands. The 2003 event was also the final event to not be brand-exclusive until Backlash 2007. Judgment Day from 2004 to 2006 exclusively featured wrestlers from the SmackDown! brand. Following WrestleMania 23 in April 2007, WWE discontinued brand-exclusive PPVs, thus the events from 2007 to 2009 featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. The 2009 event was the final Judgment Day PPV held, as the event was discontinued and replaced by Over the Limit in 2010.

In 2022, WWE reused the name for a stable called The Judgment Day.

<doc id="595359" wikidata="Q5234054" url="?curid=595359" title="David Gaunson">
<text>David Gaunson (19 January 1846 – 2 January 1909) was an Australian politician and criminal solicitor who conducted the defence of the infamous 
Australian bushranger, Ned Kelly in the pre-trial stages.

==Early life==
Gaunson was born in Sydney, New South Wales, the fourth son of Francis Gaunson and his wife Elizabeth. David Gaunson was educated in Sydney, and at Brighton, Victoria. Having served his articles to his brother-in-law, Hon. J. M. Grant, he was admitted an attorney of Victoria in 1869 and practised in Melbourne.

==Political career==
After fighting two unsuccessful contests in 1871, and in 1872 unsuccessfully opposing the Hon James Francis, the then premier, at Richmond, Gaunson was returned to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1875 for Ararat, which constituency he continued to represent until July 1881. Gaunson was a prominent member of the &quot;Stonewall&quot; party led by Graham Berry, which, after unparalleled agitation in Parliament and in the country, ultimately annihilated the followers of Sir James McCulloch at the general election in 1877. Subsequently, however, Gaunson acted in opposition to Berry, and also opposed the Service Government formed in 1880.

In the following year, on the formation of the O&#x27;Loghlen Ministry, Gaunson accepted a portfolio as President of the Board of Lands and Works and Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey. However, on presenting himself for re-election after his acceptance of office, he was defeated in Ararat by the Hon William Wilson, and had to resign his position in the Ministry, which he had only held from 9 July to 2 August. He was elected to the seat of Emerald Hill in October 1883.

He was returned to the Assembly at the general election in March 1886, but on his contesting Melbourne South at the next general election in March 1889, he was defeated by William Mountain. In June 1904, Gaunson was elected to represent Public Officers in the Assembly, serving until December 1906.

He also unsuccessfully contested Assembly elections for Emerald Hill in 1892, Carlton in 1900 and East Melbourne in 1907.

==Ned Kelly case==
Gaunson claimed to have found a loophole in the prosecution case whereby Kelly was not guilty of murder as the police unit attacking him was out to kill him and thus Kelly fired in self-defence. This argument was not carried by the defence lawyer in the actual trial and Kelly went to hang.

==Involvement with John Wren==
At the dawn of the 20th century, Gaunson became involved with John Wren, a businessman who ran an illegal tote in the working class suburb of Collingwood, Melbourne. The police eventually caught up with Wren who went to Gaunson for help. What happened is not clear, but Gaunson managed to get the police off Wren&#x27;s back. Gaunson advised Wren on the best ways to cover-up his illegal betting activities. His alleged role in the Wren machine is referred to in the Frank Hardy novel, &quot;Power Without Glory&quot;, in which the character &quot;Garside&quot; is clearly based on Gaunson.

Gaunson remained a controversial political and legal figure throughout his life. His contemporary, Alfred Deakin, described him as &quot;endowed with a musical voice, good presence, fine flow of language, great quickness of mind, readiness of retort and a good deal of industry, ability and humour, ... only disqualified from marked successes by his utter instability, egregious egotism, want of consistency and violence of temper&quot;.

<text>A macaroon ( ) is a small cake or cookie, originally made from ground almonds, egg whites, and sugar, but now often with coconut or other nuts. They may also include jam, chocolate, or other flavorings.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;macaroon&quot; is borrowed from French , in turn from the Sicilian &quot;,&quot; a variant form of , the same word as macaroni. The origin of that is unclear; it may be from medieval Greek μακαρία, &#x27;barley broth&#x27;, or μακαρώνεια, &#x27;funeral chant&#x27;. The etymology connecting it to Italian , &#x27;to bruise&#x27; is now rejected. The origin of the word may also have referred to a sort of gnocchi.

==Origins==
Macaroons can be traced to a French monastery of the 8th century in the city of Cormery. Later, two Benedictine nuns, Sister Marguerite and Sister Marie-Elisabeth, came to Nancy, France seeking asylum during the French Revolution. The two women paid for their housing by baking and selling macaroons, and thus became known as the &quot;Macaroon Sisters&quot;.

Macaroons became a popular treat for Jews on Passover because they had no flour or leavening as macaroons are leavened by egg whites.

Recipes for macaroons appeared in recipe books at least as early as 1725 (Robert Smith&#x27;s &quot;Court Cookery, or the Complete English Cook&quot;), and use egg whites and almond paste. &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot; (1861) includes a typical traditional recipe. Over time, coconut was added to the ground almonds and, in certain recipes, replaced them. Potato starch is also sometimes included in the recipe, to give the macaroons more body.

==Nutrition==
Mass-produced commercial macaroons are generally about half an ounce, or 14 grams, in weight. They do not undergo a high amount of food processing, containing only coconut, sweetener, starch, egg whites and flavoring, if any. At about 60–70 calories each, however, they contain about 3–4 grams of saturated fat due to the coconut, and 3–4 grams of added sugar, depending on the particular flavor. They are Ovo-vegetarian (not Lactarian or vegan as they contain egg whites), and contain no gluten, dairy, cholesterol, or sulfites.

==Preparation==
Some recipes use sweetened condensed milk. Macaroons are sometimes baked on edible rice paper placed on a baking tray.

==Regional varieties==

===Dominican Republic===
Macaroons in the Dominican Republic are very dark. Grated coconut is mixed with ginger and cinnamon.

===France===

There are many regional variations of French macaroon. The coconut macaroon is known as the &#x27;Congolais&#x27;, or &quot;&quot;.

===Germany===
&quot;Mandelhörnchen&quot; (almond crescents) are a common treat in Germany. Made of a flour similar to that of the macaroon, they are formed to resemble a crescent, then covered in sliced almonds and dipped in chocolate.

===India===
Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu and Mangalore in Karnataka have their own varieties of macaroon made with cashews and egg whites, adapted from those introduced in colonial times.

===Ireland===
A macaroon chocolate bar is made by Wilton Candy in County Kildare, described as macaroon pieces in Irish milk chocolate. It was first made in 1937. Cleeve&#x27;s Irish Confectionery also makes a macaroon chocolate bar, with ingredients including cocoa butter, milk powder and desiccated coconut.

===Italy===
Italy has a wide tradition of cookies and confections made from ground almonds, including pignoli. Ricciarelli are a soft almond variety originating from Siena. Amaretti di Saronno are a crunchy variety from Saronno.

===Philippines===

Philippine coconut macaroons are uniquely cake-like in texture. They are slightly crunchy on the outside and soft, moist and chewy on the inside. They are usually baked into small, colourful cupcake wrappers and topped with a raisin. They are popular during holidays and special occasions.

===Puerto Rico===
In Puerto Rico, coconut macaroons are called &quot;besitos de coco&quot; (little coconut kisses). A few variations of &quot;besitos de coco&quot; can be found on the island, the most popular ones including lemon zest and vanilla as additional ingredients.

===Spain===
The &quot;carajito&quot; (little love or darling) is a macaroon variant made with hazelnuts and honey from the town of Salas, Asturias in northern Spain. A larger size version is commonly known as &quot;sultana&quot; or &quot;suspiros del moro&quot; (sighs of the Moor).

===Turkey===
Acıbadem kurabiyesi is a traditional Turkish variety made of almonds, sugar and egg whites. The traditional recipes include a small amount of bitter almonds, which gives this macaroon its name. Because bitter almonds are not readily available, almond extract is typically used as a substitute. These are part of the stock-in trade of almost every bakery in Turkey, as they are seldom made at home.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK generally, the traditional almond macaroon often includes almond essence to strengthen the flavour, and is topped with half a blanched almond or (to cut costs) an almond flake. Coconut macaroons are also popular.

===Scotland===
The Scottish macaroon has a dense, sugary centre and is covered in chocolate and roasted coconut. Traditionally, it was made with cold leftovers of mashed potatoes and sugar loaf. When the macaroon bar became commercial, the recipe no longer used mashed potato because of shelf-life limitations. The modern macaroon is made from a combination (depending on producer) of sugar, glucose, water and egg white. These ingredients make a fondant centre. This recipe was reportedly discovered by accident in Coatbridge in 1931, when confectioner John Justice Lees was said to have botched the formula for making a chocolate fondant bar and threw coconut over it in disgust, producing the first macaroon bar.

Macaroon chocolate bars are also popular in Scotland. Buchanan&#x27;s make a macaroon with Belgian chocolate and toasted coconut. They are a long-established family business based in Greenock.

===United States===
Macaroons come in a variety of flavors, including coconut, chocolate, chocolate chip, vanilla and almond.

Commercially-made macaroons are generally dense, moist and sweet. They are available in a few flavors, and often dipped in chocolate. Homemade macaroons and varieties produced by smaller bakeries are commonly light and fluffy. Macaroons made with coconuts are often piped with a star-shaped tip, whereas macaroons made with nuts are more likely shaped individually due to the stiffness of the dough.

<doc id="595372" wikidata="Q6725637" url="?curid=595372" title="Macroscope (novel)">
<text>Macroscope is a science fiction novel by British-American writer Piers Anthony. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1970.

&quot;Macroscope&quot; was first published in 1969 and in some respects reflects the idealistic values of that time. The plot involves, among other things, an extension of the Peckham Experiment, mathematicians John Conway and Michael Paterson&#x27;s game of sprouts, astrology, the poetry of Sidney Lanier, the history of Phoenicia, and commentary on the value of a dedicated teacher of a subject contrasted with a practicing engineer of that subject attempting to teach it, all in a kaleidoscopic combination. The book fills a unique place in Anthony&#x27;s work as one that has garnered good reviews from hard-core science fiction fans as well as his usual audience of fantasy fans.

==Plot==
The central plot device is the &quot;macroscope&quot;, a large crystal that can be used to focus a newly discovered type of particle, the &quot;macron&quot;. Macrons are not subject to many of the effects that interfere with light, and as a result the macroscope can focus on any location in space-time with exceptional clarity, producing what is essentially a telescope of infinite resolution in the space-time continuum. The macroscope has been built into a solar-orbiting space station where scientists visit to book time on the device. Using it, they are able to explore space as never before. Among their many discoveries are numerous planets and two intelligent alien races. Using the macroscope, observers were able to look into one race&#x27;s historical records, finding numerous parallels with human life on Earth. The race is now in social decline, and the implications are worrying.

The macroscope&#x27;s clear view across space also makes it an ideal communications system for intelligent races, who broadcast signals by generating macrons, a technique not yet understood on Earth. However, over-riding all of these signals is another of enormous power, one of such strength that it must have been constructed by a Type II civilization. This signal repeats itself, starting with instructions on basic math and progressing to ever-more complex information. Viewers with high enough intelligence, an IQ of 150, reach a point where the information causes them to go insane or die. Those without the intelligence to understand the advanced portions of the signal are unaffected. The signal appears to be a deliberate attempt to &quot;jam&quot; macroscopic communications, blocking those with the ability to understand the other signals from being able to see them. They refer to the blocking signal simply as the &quot;destroyer&quot;.

The protagonist of the story, Ivo Archer, is taken to the macroscope station on the invitation of a childhood friend, Brad Carpenter. Ivo has an unexplained link to a mysterious hyper-intelligent character, Schön, and Brad believes Schön may be able to break through the destroyer signal. Ivo is not so convinced, and is reluctant to ask for Schön&#x27;s help. This reluctance is cause for some misunderstanding with Brad&#x27;s girlfriend, Afra Summerfield, with whom Ivo falls hopelessly in love.

While inadvertently viewing the destroyer signal with Brad and a Senator visiting the project, only Ivo survives the experience. Afra concludes Ivo is not intelligent enough to be affected, and finds him somewhat beneath her as a result. The Senator&#x27;s death sparks a series of events that lead to Ivo, Afra and two other station members, Harold and Beatryx, stealing the macroscope. Afra, still in love with Brad and hoping to find a cure, brings his body along, now in a vegetative state. They detach the macroscope from the station and fly off with it while United Nations ships give chase. With time on their hands, Ivo turns to the macroscope and finds a way to avoid being overwhelmed by the destroyer signal. This reveals a number of broadcasts from farther out in space. Ivo demonstrates this technique to the others, allowing Harold and Afra to view the signals formerly being hidden. Harold, a talented engineer, uses the information from one of the signals to build a device reducing their bodies to a liquid state, allowing them to accelerate at 10 g and escape the pursuing ships.

They travel to Neptune space, following a cryptic message left by Schön. Here they set up camp on Triton. Afra attempts to cure Brad by shocking him while he is being reconstituted from the liquid state, but the attempt fails and Brad is killed. Over time, and with further help from Ivo, the group watches a benign form of the entire broadcast, which they come to call &quot;traveller&quot;. The liquefaction technique is only the first of many shown in the traveller signal, which describes an entire suite of technologies that allow interstellar travel. Using the instructions in the signal, they convert Neptune into an interstellar spaceship.

Schön briefly makes his first appearance during construction, revealing himself to be an alternate personality within Ivo&#x27;s brain. Schön is ostensibly the body&#x27;s &quot;owner&quot;, having created the Ivo personality to avoid being the subject of experimentation. Schön has frightening intelligence, but having given over his body to Ivo at the age of five, is still a child and largely without morals. In an attempt to take control of the body, Schön traps Ivo in a historical drama running in his own brain. Over time, Ivo sees parallels between the characters in the drama and the group in the ship, and eventually escapes the illusion and re-asserts control.

The group decides to hunt down the source of the destroyer signal in an effort to turn it off. Travelling 15,000 light-years from Earth, they find it is being broadcast from an abandoned space station. Exploring the inner portions of the station, which is a large museum, they are individually drawn into a series of visions that reveal different aspects of the nature of the destroyer and its history. The traveller signal had arrived relatively late in the history of the galaxy, in the midst of flourishing communications via macroscope. Armed with the ability for interstellar travel, wars broke out that destroyed countless civilizations. The destroyer station, one of six in the galaxy, was set up to prevent this until the races reached the required level of cultural sophistication, if they ever did.

Emerging from one of these visions, Afra discovers that Schön has once again taken over from Ivo. Intelligent enough that the signal would kill him, he has solved this problem via surgery that altered his brain chemistry to block most of the signal. This took six months to complete, keeping him &quot;pinned&quot; during the interval. Schön plays a game with Afra, now the only other surviving member of the original group, with the stakes being that the winner gets to select who, Schön or Ivo, gets the body. During the game, the real reason for Ivo&#x27;s creation comes forth; the original Ivo was a girl with intelligence similar to Schön&#x27;s, a situation neither could tolerate. After murdering her during a game played to the death with rules only the two of them could comprehend, Schön created the new Ivo to escape the retribution of his peers.

Playing the game by the rules and losing, Afra instead tricks Schön into the room broadcasting the destroyer signal. Here it is so powerful that it overwhelms Schön&#x27;s surgical blocks, and Ivo is able to take control. Now in command of his own personality, along with all of Schön&#x27;s intellectual capacity, Ivo wins Afra&#x27;s heart. At the end of the story the reader is left to decide whether or not the people of Earth are mature enough and ready for interstellar travel.

==Themes==
&quot;Macroscope&#x27;s&quot; story is interwoven by many themes taken from a variety of sources.

Among these are references to the personality traits each of the four members of the group embody. Harold is a student of astrology, and through his character each of the group member&#x27;s signs are revealed; Ivo is a fire sign, Afra earth, Harold air, and Beatryx water. At several points, Anthony mentions that only the four together, acting as a unit, can solve the problems presented to them. These traits are explored throughout the book, but especially during the closing sequences, where they form the basis of the game between Afra and Schön.

Anthony also explores the concepts of logic and understanding, especially through Afra. Her attempt to revive Brad had no hope of succeeding, something she was aware of, but ignored. During a mock trial following Brad&#x27;s death, Harold explores the differences between emotion and logic, demonstrating that Afra&#x27;s deliberate clamping down of her emotions led her to subvert logic. This is again explored later in the book, as Schön battles her.

Anthony also uses Ivo as a stand-in for Sidney Lanier, a poet. Portions of Lanier&#x27;s poetry are used throughout the book, and in other cases passages of the book closely reflect themes in Lanier&#x27;s work. Through flashbacks throughout the book, Lanier&#x27;s life is explored.

Next to last, Brad and Ivo/Schön both come from a special project in Philadelphia clearly modelled in some ways on Britain&#x27;s Peckham Experiment, initiated during the Great Depression. That project showed the great benefits of most improvements of overall health care in a community context, not just for the clinical health of the participants, but the effectiveness of the Peckham social milieu on reducing social problems, in particular, poverty.

Finally, the overarching theme of the book explores mankind&#x27;s potential for self-destruction, seen both through the example of the &quot;prob&quot; race as well as an exploration of humanity. Early in the book Brad complains that the population of 5 billion is unsustainable unless mankind reaches the stars, but he doubts their ability and maturity to do so. This theme is covered throughout the work, including the closing sentence.

==Reception==
&quot;Macroscope&quot; was a finalist for the 1970 Hugo Award for Best Novel.

<doc id="595377" wikidata="Q7156698" url="?curid=595377" title="Payback (video game)">
<text>Payback is a video game developed and published by Apex Designs. It was first released in 2001. It was followed by a sequel in 2012, &quot;Payback 2&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The game is similar in gameplay to the original &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, with new camera angles and more weapons being obvious differences. The player can use shotguns grenades, as well as weapons such as remote controlled cars carrying explosives.

The game also supports four-player multiplayer deathmatch.

The Game Boy Advance version includes eleven cities.

== Development ==
It was originally a fan&#x27;s project to make an Amiga clone of &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;. In the author&#x27;s own words, &quot;every effort has been made to ensure that Payback beats GTA in every way.&quot;

The game was eventually expanded into a commercial release, and in 2002 Apex Designs announced plans to bring it to Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, and the Game Boy Advance (GBA). The Mac version was speedily released, but there is still no word on the Windows version&#x27;s released date. A version for the GP2X handheld was released in 2006.

Despite the game being a clone of GTA, even copying car names such as the &quot;Mundaneo&quot;, Rockstar has made no attempt to stop Apex Designs from publishing this game, or warn them about infringing on their copyrighted materials.

The GBA version was also finished, but Apex Designs couldn&#x27;t initially find a publisher. After numerous failed attempts to get it published, it was not until late 2004 that DSI Games finally picked up the game.
The GBA version received an age rating from North America&#x27;s ESRB, however it didn&#x27;t officially release there.

A sequel to Payback, &quot;Payback 2&quot; for iOS and Android devices, was released on 4 October 2012

==Additional content==
The Amiga version allowed fans to make their own deathmatch maps (see the link below). These cannot be added into the GBA version, but a slightly modified &#x27;Isla Nublar&#x27; map is featured as an unlockable bonus.

<doc id="595387" wikidata="Q1164207" url="?curid=595387" title="Toynbee Hall">
<text>Toynbee Hall is a charitable institution that works to address the causes and impacts of poverty in the East End of London and elsewhere. Established in 1884, it is based in Commercial Street, Spitalfields, and was the first university-affiliated institution of the worldwide settlement movement—a reformist social agenda that strove to get the rich and poor to live more closely together in an interdependent community. It was founded by Henrietta and Samuel Barnett in the economically depressed East End, and was named in memory of their friend and fellow reformer, Oxford historian Arnold Toynbee, who had died the previous year.

Toynbee Hall continues to strive to bridge the gap between people of all social and financial backgrounds, with a focus on working towards a future without poverty.

==History==
Shortly after their marriage in 1873, Samuel Barnett and his wife, Henrietta, moved to the Whitechapel district of the East End of London. Barnett was vicar of St Jude&#x27;s church, where he saw poverty at first hand. Late-Victorian Whitechapel was known for its overcrowded living spaces and high criminal activity. In the area of Whitechapel alone, the mortality rate for children under the age of five was around 60% mostly due to the tight living conditions. Charles Booth, another social reformer, mapped London according to eight different social classes, finding that around 70% of people living in the East End were in the lowest three classes.
Whitechapel was also a place where many different immigrants settled. The Great Famine of Ireland in the 19th century led to many Irish settling in Whitechapel. Also, many Jewish immigrants settled in Whitechapel after fleeing from persecution in Western Europe at the time.

The Barnetts used their roles in the parish to improve the Whitechapel area. They built a church library, introduced art exhibits, brought university lecturers in, and took their parishioners on excursions to the homes of the wealthy and to universities. The Barnetts also tried to encourage officials to improve sanitation and housing and to build more playgrounds and washhouses. However, the attempts the Barnetts made with the parish had little effect on the East End community as a whole. The parish did not reach everyone that lived in the East End. Many of the people did not involve themselves with the established church. In an effort to improve the wellbeing of the community, Barnett had the idea of sharing knowledge and culture. His proposal was to have university students come as volunteers to share their knowledge: the students would be able to help the poor, and at the same time witness poverty at first hand, and potentially develop solutions for it.

In 1883, Barnett gave a lecture at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford to gain support for his idea. Barnett was able to gather enough support and a committee called the &quot;University Settlement of East London&quot; was set up by Oxford. With these ideas and the support of universities, Barnett founded Toynbee Hall, the first settlement house in the world. Named after another social reformer, Arnold Toynbee, Toynbee Hall first opened its doors on Christmas Eve in 1884. Samuel Barnett was named as the first warden of the hall and Oxford and Cambridge university students came to work at the hall.

By 1910 more settlement houses were founded in the United Kingdom in the areas of Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Birmingham, Liverpool, and elsewhere in London; as well as in Holland, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, and the United States. In 1911 the leaders of the social settlement movement founded the National Federation of Settlements. One of the best known settlement houses that was inspired after a visit to Toynbee Hall is Hull House in Chicago, founded by Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr in 1889.

Over time Toynbee Hall implemented many different educational community programmes. At its opening, Toynbee Hall introduced University Extension Society lectures. These lectures were taught by university professors. At the programme&#x27;s peak, in the 1890s, classes were taught in over 134 topics including; literature, zoology, ethics, philosophy, etc. In order to further promote education, 36 societies or clubs were created in different areas, such as, music, art, history, and science. One of these societies was founded in 1889 and was called the &quot;Toynbee Travellers&quot;. This group was created after a group of Toynbee Hall residents travelled to Belgium in 1887. Toynbee Hall also began hosting Smoking Room Debates in which community members and invited speakers would come to debate issues of the day. This tradition continued for over twenty years. In 1899, the Poor Man&#x27;s Lawyer service was introduced. This programme gives free legal services to those who can not afford it, and continues to the present day.

==The settlement movement==
The international settlement movement began at Toynbee Hall, where a community centre was formed that attracted university students who wished to live or &quot;settle&quot; among the underprivileged in London&#x27;s economically depressed East End. They came, according to Samuel Barnett, &quot;to learn, as much as to teach, to receive as much as to give&quot;. As at most settlement houses, its social workers—students from Oxford and Cambridge Universities, among others—resided at Toynbee Hall and sought thereby to get to know their neighbors and their needs on a more intimate, personal level.

Toynbee Hall rejected the concept of a community centre as a location for Christian proselytisingas seen in the efforts of the Salvation Army. This principle is reflected in the decision to name it after the social reformer, Arnold Toynbee, who had died in 1883, aged 30. As Henrietta Barnett explained, the name would be &quot;free from every possible savor of a mission.&quot;

From the beginning, it was non-sectarian and welcomed people of all faiths, despite having been founded by a Church of England cleric. It saw its purpose as more educational than charitable, in a missionary sense. Gertrude Himmelfarb lists some of the activities offered by Toynbee Hall in a typical month: &quot;evening classes on arithmetic, writing, drawing, citizenship, chemistry, nursing, and music (...); afternoon classes for girls on dressmaking, writing and composition, geography, bookkeeping, needlework, hygiene, reading and recitation, French, singing, cooking, and swimming; and evening sessions devoted to the discussion of legal principles and current social issues&quot;.

By 1900 there were over 100 settlements in the United States and across the UK, and in 1911 the leaders of the social settlement movement founded the National Federation of Settlements.

==Current activity==
Today, Toynbee Hall provides a range of programmes and activities, broadly broken down into: youth, the elderly, financial inclusion, debt, advice, free legal advice and community engagement.

Each year over 400 volunteers help to deliver the charity&#x27;s services.

In 2006 Toynbee Hall launched Capitalise, a pan-London free debt advice service to support 20,000 people a year with their money worries. In April 2019 this service was rebranded as Debt Free London.

In 2007 the Toynbee Studios opened in part of the building offering dance and media studios and a theatre.

Toynbee Hall, the original building that houses the organisation of the same name, is located in Commercial Street, Spitalfields, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It was designed by Elijah Hoole in a Tudor-Gothic style, and was formally opened in January 1885. It was built on the site of a disused industrial school, and adjacent to the church of St Jude (built in 1845–46, but demolished in 1927). It was designated a Grade II listed building in 1973. The front of the building bears a Greater London Council blue plaque, erected in 1984, commemorating Jimmy Mallon, warden 1919–54.

Since its foundation, the charity has expanded from the original building into a number of extensions and other neighbouring buildings.

<text>Takashi Shimizu (清水 崇 &quot;Shimizu Takashi&quot;, born 27 July 1972) is a Japanese filmmaker. He is best known for being the creator of the &quot;Ju-On&quot; franchise, and directing four of its films, internationally, in both Japan and the U.S. According to film scholar Wheeler Winston Dixon, Shimizu is &quot;one of a new breed of Japanese horror directors&quot; who prefers to &quot;suggest menace and violence rather than directly depict it&quot;.

==Early life== 
Shimizu was born on 27 July 1972, in Maebashi, Tokyo. He attended Wakamiya Elementary School and Maebashi City Fourth Junior High School before graduating from Gunma Prefectural Chuo High School. He initially enrolled in Kindai University but dropped out. He then enrolled in Nihon University where he met future collaborator and film producer Takashige Ichise. Together they went on to develop &quot;Ju-On&quot;.

== Career ==
After graduating, he was given the opportunity to direct a short film for Kansai TV&#x27;s horror omnibus &quot;Gakkou no Kaidan G&quot; when writer and director Kiyoshi Kurosawa, who was teaching a filmmaking class that Shimizu, then working as an assistant director, attended, was impressed by a three-minute short film Shimizu had written and directed. The short films would end up being &quot;Katasumi&quot; and &quot;4444444444&quot;, later serving as forerunners to the franchise. 

Shortly afterwards, Shimizu made his directorial debut with the supernatural horror, &quot;Ju-On: The Curse&quot; (2000), starring Takashi Matsuyama, Takako Fuji, Yūrei Yanagi and Chiaki Kuriyama in lead roles, followed by its sequel, &quot;Ju-On: The Curse 2.&quot; Despite the films releasing in direct-to-video formats, they were met with critical acclaim. The critical success of the films hence led to theatrical remakes, &quot;Ju-On: The Grudge&quot; (2002), and &quot;Ju-On: The Grudge 2&quot; (2003). The two films were met with critical and commercial success, eventually popularizing J-Horror internationally which led to Western remakes, in the form of &quot;The Grudge&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Grudge 2&quot; (2006), as Shimizu returned to direct and write them. 

However, the English remakes were met with a widespread mixed reception, albeit their commercial success. The studio quickly greenlit a sequel, as Shimizu was offered to direct, but chose to produce instead, prompting a replacement in form of Toby Wilkins. The film was met with overwhelmingly negative reception, despite commercial success in both its direct-to-video and theatrical releases. Following the negative reception, Shimizu returned to Japanese cinema, and has continued focusing his work there.

<text>Anthony Michael Bourdain ( ; June 25, 1956 – June 8, 2018) was an American celebrity chef, author, and travel documentarian. He starred in programs focusing on the exploration of international culture, cuisine, and the human condition.

Bourdain was a 1978 graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and a veteran of many professional kitchens during his career, which included several years spent as an executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in Manhattan. In the late 1990s Bourdain wrote an essay about the ugly secrets of a Manhattan restaurant, but he was having difficulty getting it published. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, his mother Gladys—then an editor and writer at the paper—handed her son&#x27;s essay to friend and fellow editor Esther B. Fein, the wife of David Remnick, editor of the magazine &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Remnick ran Bourdain&#x27;s essay in the magazine, kickstarting Bourdain&#x27;s career and legitimizing the point-blank tone that would become his trademark. The success of the article was followed just a year later by the publication of a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling book, &quot;Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly&quot; (2000).

Bourdain became a media darling almost overnight. His first food and world-travel television show &quot;A Cook&#x27;s Tour&quot; ran for 35 episodes on the Food Network in 2002 and 2003. In 2005, he began hosting the Travel Channel&#x27;s culinary and cultural adventure programs &quot;Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations&quot; (2005–2012) and &quot;The Layover&quot; (2011–2013). In 2013, he began a three-season run as a judge on &quot;The Taste&quot; and consequently switched his travelogue programming to CNN to host &quot;Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&quot;. Although best known for his culinary writings and television presentations, along with several books on food and cooking and travel adventures, Bourdain also wrote both fiction and historical nonfiction. On June 8, 2018, Bourdain died while on location in France, filming for &quot;Parts Unknown&quot;, of suicide by hanging.

==Early life==
Anthony Michael Bourdain was born in Manhattan on June 25, 1956. His father, Pierre (1929–1987), was a classical music recording industry executive. His mother, Gladys (née Sacksman; 1934–2020), was a &quot;New York Times&quot; editor. Anthony&#x27;s younger brother, Christopher, was born a few years after him. 

Anthony grew up living with both of his parents and described his childhood in one of his books: &quot;I did not want for love or attention. My parents loved me. Neither of them drank to excess. Nobody beat me. God was never mentioned so I was annoyed by neither church nor any notion of sin or damnation.&quot; His father was Catholic of French descent and his mother was Jewish. Bourdain stated that, although he was considered Jewish by halacha&#x27;s definition, &quot;I&#x27;ve never been in a synagogue. I don&#x27;t believe in a higher power. But that doesn&#x27;t make me any less Jewish, I don&#x27;t think&quot;. His family was not religious. 

At the time of Bourdain&#x27;s birth, Pierre was a salesman at a New York City camera store, as well as a floor manager at a record store. He later became an executive for Columbia Records, and Gladys was a staff editor at &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Bourdain&#x27;s paternal grandparents were French (his great-grandfather Aurélien Bourdain was born in Brazil to French parents); his paternal grandfather Pierre Michel Bourdain (1905–1932) emigrated from Arcachon to New York following World War I. Bourdain&#x27;s father spent summers in France as a boy and grew up speaking French. Bourdain spent most of his childhood in Leonia, New Jersey. He felt jealous of the lack of parental supervision of his classmates and the freedom they had in their homes. In his youth, Bourdain was a member of the Boy Scouts of America.

==Culinary training and career==
Bourdain&#x27;s love of food was kindled in his youth while on a family vacation in France when he tried his first oyster from a fisherman&#x27;s boat. He graduated from the Dwight-Englewood School—an independent coeducational college-preparatory day school in Englewood, New Jersey—in 1973, then enrolled at Vassar College but dropped out after two years. He worked at seafood restaurants in Provincetown, Massachusetts, including the Lobster Pot, while attending Vassar, which inspired his decision to pursue cooking as a career.

Bourdain attended the Culinary Institute of America, graduating in 1978. From there he went on to run various restaurant kitchens in New York City, including the Supper Club, One Fifth Avenue and Sullivan&#x27;s.

In 1998, Bourdain became an executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles. Based in Manhattan, at the time the brand had additional restaurants in Miami, Washington, D.C., and Tokyo. Bourdain remained an executive chef there for many years and even when no longer formally employed at Les Halles, he maintained a relationship with the restaurant, which described him in January 2014 as their &quot;chef at large&quot;. Les Halles closed in 2017 after filing for bankruptcy.

==Media career==
===Writing===
In the mid-1980s, Bourdain began submitting unsolicited work for publication to &quot;Between C &amp; D&quot;, a literary magazine of the Lower East Side. The magazine eventually published a piece that Bourdain had written about a chef who was trying to purchase heroin in the Lower East Side. In 1985, Bourdain signed up for a writing workshop with Gordon Lish. In 1990, Bourdain received a small book advance from Random House, after meeting a Random House editor.

His first book, a culinary mystery called &quot;Bone in the Throat&quot;, was published in 1995. He paid for his own book tour, but he did not find success. His second mystery book, &quot;Gone Bamboo,&quot; also performed poorly in sales. &quot;Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly,&quot; a 2000 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, was an expansion of his 1999 &quot;New Yorker&quot; article &quot;Don&#x27;t Eat Before Reading This&quot;.

In 2010, he published &quot;Medium Raw: A Bloody Valentine to the World of Food and the People Who Cook&quot;, a memoir and follow-up to the book &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;.

He wrote two more bestselling nonfiction books: &quot;A Cook&#x27;s Tour: Global Adventures in Extreme Cuisines&quot; (2001), an account of his food and travel exploits around the world, written in conjunction with his first television series of the same title, and 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Nasty Bits&quot;, a collection of 37 exotic, provocative, and humorous anecdotes and essays, many of them centered around food, and organized into sections named for each of the five traditional flavors, followed by a 30-page fiction piece (&quot;A Chef&#x27;s Christmas&quot;).

Bourdain later published a hypothetical historical investigation, &quot;Typhoid Mary: An Urban Historical&quot;, about Mary Mallon, an Irish-born cook believed to have infected 53 people with typhoid fever between 1907 and 1938. In 2007, Bourdain published &quot;No Reservations: Around the World on an Empty Stomach&quot;, covering the experiences of filming and photographs of the first three seasons of the show and his crew at work while filming the series.

His articles and essays appeared in many publications, including in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;Gourmet&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot;, and &quot;Esquire&quot;. &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot;, &quot;The Face&quot;, &quot;Food Arts&quot;, &quot;Limb by Limb&quot;, &quot;BlackBook&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;Best Life&quot;, the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, and &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;. His blog for the third season of &quot;Top Chef&quot; was nominated for a Webby Award for Best Blog (in the Cultural/Personal category) in 2008.

In 2012, Bourdain co-wrote the graphic novel &quot;Get Jiro!&quot; with Joel Rose, with art by Langdon Foss. It will receive an adult animated series adaptation produced by Warner Bros. Animation for Adult Swim.

In 2015, Bourdain joined the travel, food, and politics publication Roads &amp; Kingdoms, as the site&#x27;s sole investor and editor-at-large. Over the next few years, Bourdain contributed to the site and edited the Dispatched By Bourdain series. Bourdain and Roads &amp; Kingdoms also partnered on the digital series &quot;Explore Parts Unknown&quot;, which launched in 2017 and won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Nonfiction or Reality Series in 2018.

===Television===
Bourdain hosted many food and travel series, including his first show, &quot;A Cook&#x27;s Tour&quot; (2002 to 2003). He worked for The Travel Channel from 2005 to 2013. He also worked for CNN from 2013 to 2018. Bourdain described the concept as, &quot;I travel around the world, eat a lot of shit, and basically do whatever the fuck I want.&quot; Nigella Lawson noted that Bourdain had an &quot;incredibly beautiful style when he talks that ranges from erudite to brilliantly slangy&quot;.

The acclaim surrounding Bourdain&#x27;s memoir &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; led to an offer by the Food Network for him to host his own food and world-travel show, &quot;A Cook&#x27;s Tour&quot;, which premiered in January 2002. It ran for 35 episodes, through 2003.

In July 2005, he premiered a new, somewhat similar television series, &quot;Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations&quot;, on the Travel Channel. As a further result of the immense popularity of &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;, the Fox sitcom &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; aired in 2005, in which the character Jack Bourdain is based loosely on Anthony Bourdain&#x27;s biography and persona.

In July 2006, he and his crew were in Beirut filming an episode of &quot;No Reservations&quot; when the Israel–Lebanon conflict broke out unexpectedly after the crew had filmed only a few hours of footage. His producers compiled behind-the-scenes footage of him and his production staff, including not only their initial attempts to film the episode, but also their firsthand encounters with Hezbollah supporters, their days of waiting for news with other expatriates in a Beirut hotel, and their eventual escape aided by a &quot;fixer&quot; (unseen in the footage), whom Bourdain dubbed &quot;Mr. Wolf&quot; after Harvey Keitel&#x27;s character in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Bourdain and his crew were finally evacuated with other American citizens, on the morning of July 20, by the United States Marine Corps. The Beirut &quot;No Reservations&quot; episode, which aired on August 21, 2006, was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2007.

In July 2011, the Travel Channel announced adding a second one-hour, 10-episode Bourdain show to be titled &quot;The Layover&quot;, which premiered November 21, 2011. Each episode featured an exploration of a city that can be undertaken within an air travel layover of 24 to 48 hours. The series ran for 20 episodes, through February 2013. Bourdain executive produced a similar show hosted by celebrities called &quot;The Getaway&quot;, which lasted two seasons on Esquire Network.
In May 2012, Bourdain announced that he was leaving the Travel Channel. In December, he explained on his blog that his departure was due to his frustration with the channel&#x27;s new ownership using his voice and image to make it seem as if he were endorsing a car brand, and the channel&#x27;s creating three &quot;special episodes&quot; consisting solely of clips from the seven official episodes of that season. He went on to host &quot;Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&quot; for CNN. The program focused on other cuisines, cultures and politics and premiered on April 14, 2013.

President Barack Obama was featured on the program in an episode filmed in Vietnam that aired in September 2016; the two talked over a beer and bun cha at a small restaurant in Hanoi. The show was filmed and is set in places as diverse as Libya, Tokyo, the Punjab region, Jamaica, Turkey, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Far West Texas and Armenia.

Between 2012 and 2017, he served as narrator and executive producer for several episodes of the award-winning PBS series &quot;The Mind of a Chef&quot;; it aired on the last months of each year. The series moved from PBS to Facebook Watch in 2017.

From 2013 to 2015, Bourdain was an executive producer and appeared as a judge and mentor in ABC&#x27;s cooking-competition show &quot;The Taste&quot;. He earned an Emmy nomination for each season.

Bourdain appeared five times as guest judge on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Top Chef&quot; reality cooking competition program. He was also one of the main judges on &quot;Top Chef All-Stars&quot; (&quot;Top Chef&quot;, Season 8). He made a guest appearance on the August 6, 2007, New York City episode of &quot;Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern&quot;, and Zimmern himself appeared as a guest on the New York City episode of Bourdain&#x27;s &quot;No Reservations&quot; airing the same day. On October 20, 2008, Bourdain hosted a special, &quot;At the Table with Anthony Bourdain&quot;, on the Travel Channel.
====Other appearances====
Bourdain was a consultant and writer for the television series &quot;Treme&quot;.

In 2011, he voiced himself in a cameo on an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;The Food Wife&quot;, in which Marge, Lisa, and Bart start a food blog called &quot;The Three Mouthkateers&quot;.

He appeared in a 2013 episode of the animated series &quot;Archer&quot; (S04E07), voicing chef Lance Casteau, a parody of himself. In 2015, he voiced a fictionalized version of himself on an episode of &quot;Sanjay and Craig&quot; titled &quot;Snake Parts Unknown&quot;.

From 2015 to 2017, Bourdain hosted &quot;Raw Craft&quot;, a series of short videos released on YouTube. The series followed Bourdain as he visited various artisans who produce various craft items by hand, including iron skillets, suits, saxophones, and kitchen knives. The series was produced by William Grant &amp; Sons to promote their Balvenie distillery&#x27;s products.

===Publishing===
In September 2011, Ecco Press announced that Bourdain would have his own publishing line, Anthony Bourdain Books, which included acquiring between three and five titles per year that &quot;reflect his remarkably eclectic tastes&quot;. The first books that the imprint published, released in 2013, include &quot;L.A. Son: My Life, My City, My Food&quot; by Roy Choi, Tien Nguyen, and Natasha Phan, &quot;Prophets of Smoked Meat&quot; by Daniel Vaughn, &quot;Pain Don&#x27;t Hurt&quot; by Mark Miller, and &quot;Grand Forks: A History of American Dining in 128 Reviews&quot; by Marilyn Hagerty.

In describing the line, he said, &quot;This will be a line of books for people with strong voices who are at something—who speak with authority. Discern nothing from this initial list—other than a general affection for people who cook food and like food. The ability to kick people in the head is just as compelling to us—as long as that&#x27;s coupled with an ability to vividly describe the experience. We are just as intent on crossing genres as we are enthusiastic about our first three authors. It only gets weirder from here.&quot;

Shortly after Bourdain&#x27;s death, HarperCollins announced that the publishing line would be shut down after the remaining works under contract were published.

===Film===
Bourdain appeared as himself in the 2015 film &quot;The Big Short&quot;, in which he used seafood stew as an analogy for a collateralized debt obligation. He also produced and starred in &quot;Wasted! The Story of Food Waste&quot;.

==Public persona==

Drew Magary, in a column for &quot;GQ&quot; published on the day of Bourdain&#x27;s death, reflected that Bourdain was heir in spirit to Hunter S. Thompson. &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine declared Bourdain &quot;the original rock star&quot; of the culinary world, while his public persona was characterized by &quot;Gothamist&quot; as &quot;culinary bad boy&quot;. Due to his liberal use of profanity and sexual references in his television show &quot;No Reservations&quot;, the network added viewer-discretion advisories to each episode.

Bourdain was known for consuming exotic local specialty dishes, having eaten black-colored blood sausages called (lit. &quot;black sausage&quot;) in Finland and also &quot;sheep testicles in Morocco, ant eggs in Puebla, Mexico, a raw seal eyeball as part of a traditional Inuit seal hunt, and an entire cobra—beating heart, blood, bile, and meat—in Vietnam&quot;. Bourdain was quoted as saying that a Chicken McNugget was the most disgusting thing he ever ate, but he was fond of Popeyes chicken. He also declared that the unwashed warthog rectum he ate in Namibia was &quot;the worst meal of [his] life&quot;, along with the fermented shark he ate in Iceland.

Bourdain was noted for his put-downs of celebrity chefs such as Paula Deen, Bobby Flay, Guy Fieri, Sandra Lee, and Rachael Ray, and appeared irritated by both the overt commercialism of the celebrity cooking industry and its lack of culinary authenticity. He voiced a &quot;serious disdain for food demigods like Alan Richman, Alice Waters, and Alain Ducasse&quot;. Bourdain recognized the irony of his transformation into a celebrity chef and began to qualify his insults; in the 2007 New Orleans episode of &quot;No Reservations&quot;, he reconciled with Emeril Lagasse, whom he had previously disparaged in &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;. He later wrote more favorably of Lagasse in the preface of the 2013 edition. He was outspoken in his praise for chefs he admired, particularly Ferran Adrià, Juan Mari Arzak, Fergus Henderson, José Andrés, Thomas Keller, Martin Picard, Éric Ripert, and Marco Pierre White, as well as his former protégé and colleagues at Brasserie Les Halles. He spoke very highly of Julia Child&#x27;s influence on him.

Bourdain was known for his sarcastic comments about vegan and vegetarian activists, considering their lifestyle &quot;rude&quot; to the inhabitants of many countries he visited. He considered vegetarianism, except in the case of religious exemptions, a &quot;First World luxury&quot;. However, he also believed that Americans eat too much meat, and admired vegetarians and vegans who put aside their beliefs when visiting different cultures in order to be respectful of their hosts.

Bourdain&#x27;s book &quot;The Nasty Bits&quot; is dedicated to &quot;Joey, Johnny, and Dee Dee&quot; of the Ramones. He declared fond appreciation for their music, as well that of other early punk bands such as Dead Boys and The Voidoids. He said that the playing of music by Billy Joel, Elton John, or Grateful Dead in his kitchen was grounds for firing. Joel was a fan of Bourdain&#x27;s, and visited the restaurant.

On &quot;No Reservations&quot; and &quot;Parts Unknown&quot;, he dined with and interviewed many musicians, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, with a special focus on glam and various rockers such as Alice Cooper, David Johansen, Marky Ramone, and Iggy Pop. He featured contemporary band Queens of the Stone Age on &quot;No Reservations&quot; several times, and they composed and performed the theme song for &quot;Parts Unknown&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In the 1970s, while attending high school at Dwight-Englewood School, Bourdain dated Nancy Putkoski. He described her as &quot;a bad girl&quot;, older than he was and &quot;part of a druggy crowd&quot;. She was a year above him, and Bourdain graduated one year early in order to follow Putkoski to Vassar College since they had just started admitting men. He studied there between the ages of 17 and 19. He then attended the Culinary Institute of America, a 15-minute drive from Vassar. The couple married in 1985, and remained together for two decades, divorcing in 2005.

On April 20, 2007, he married Ottavia Busia, who later became a mixed martial artist. The couple&#x27;s daughter, Ariane, was born in 2007. Bourdain said having to be away from his family for 250 days a year working on his television shows put a strain on the relationship. Busia appeared in several episodes of &quot;No Reservations&quot;, notably the ones in Tuscany, Rome, Rio de Janeiro, Naples, and her birthplace of Sardinia. The couple separated in 2016.

Bourdain met Italian actress Asia Argento in 2016 while filming the Rome episode of &quot;Parts Unknown&quot;. In October 2017, Argento said in an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that she had been sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein in the 1990s. After being criticized for her account in Italian media and politics, Argento moved to Germany to escape what she described as a culture of &quot;victim blaming&quot; in Italy. Argento delivered a speech on May 20, 2018, following the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, calling the festival Weinstein&#x27;s &quot;hunting ground&quot;, alleging that she was raped by Weinstein in Cannes when she was 21. She added, &quot;And even tonight, sitting among you, there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women.&quot; Bourdain supported her during that period. On June 3, 2018, Bourdain tweeted a video where the team was celebrating during the production of the show with Argento as director, him and Chris Doyle. In August 2018, Argento said that Bourdain was behind the payment of $380,000 to Jimmy Bennett, who had accused Argento of sexually assaulting him. She stated the payment by Bourdain was one he &quot;personally undertook to help Bennett economically, upon the condition that we would no longer suffer any further intrusions in our life.”

Bourdain practiced the martial art Brazilian jiu-jitsu, earning a blue belt in August 2015. He won gold at the IBJJF New York Spring International Open Championship in 2016, in the Middleweight Master 5 (age 51 and older) division.

Bourdain was known to be a heavy smoker. In a nod to Bourdain&#x27;s two-pack-a-day cigarette habit, Thomas Keller once served him a 20-course tasting menu which included a mid-meal &quot;coffee and cigarette&quot;, a coffee custard infused with tobacco, with a foie gras mousse. Bourdain stopped smoking in 2007 for his daughter, but relapsed towards the end of his life.

A former user of cocaine and heroin, Bourdain wrote in &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; of his experience in a SoHo restaurant in 1981, where he and his friends were often high. Bourdain said drugs influenced his decisions, and that he would send a busboy to Alphabet City to obtain cannabis, methaqualone, cocaine, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, secobarbital, tuinal, amphetamine, codeine, and heroin.

==Death==

In early June 2018, Bourdain was working on an episode of &quot;&quot; in Strasbourg, with his frequent collaborator and friend Éric Ripert. On June 8, 2018, Ripert became worried when Bourdain had missed dinner and breakfast. He subsequently found Bourdain dead by suicide in his room at Le Chambard hotel in Kaysersberg near Colmar. He was 61 years old.

Bourdain&#x27;s body bore no signs of violence and the suicide appeared to be an impulsive act. Rocquigny du Fayel disclosed that Bourdain&#x27;s toxicology results were negative for narcotics, showing only a trace of a therapeutic non-narcotic medication. Bourdain&#x27;s body was cremated in France on June 13, 2018, and his ashes were returned to the United States two days later and given to his brother Christopher.

=== Reactions and tributes ===

Bourdain&#x27;s mother, Gladys Bourdain, told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;He is absolutely the last person in the world I would have ever dreamed would do something like this.&quot;

Following the news of Bourdain&#x27;s death, various public figures expressed condolences. Among them were fellow chefs Andrew Zimmern and Gordon Ramsay, former astronaut Scott Kelly, and then-U.S. president Donald Trump. CNN issued a statement, saying that Bourdain&#x27;s &quot;talents never ceased to amaze us and we will miss him very much.&quot; Former U.S. president Barack Obama, who dined with Bourdain in Vietnam on &quot;Parts Unknown&quot;, wrote on Twitter: &quot;He taught us about food—but more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown.&quot; On the day of Bourdain&#x27;s death, CNN aired &quot;Remembering Anthony Bourdain&quot;, a tribute program.

In the days following Bourdain&#x27;s death, fans gathered to pay tribute to him outside his former place of employment, Brasserie Les Halles (which had closed down the previous year). Cooks and restaurant owners held gatherings, tribute dinners, and memorials, and donated the net revenue from these events to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

In August 2018, CNN announced a final, posthumous season of &quot;Parts Unknown&quot;; its remaining episodes were completed using narration and additional interviews from featured guests; the season included two retrospective episodes paying tribute to the series and to Bourdain&#x27;s legacy.

In June 2019, Éric Ripert and José Andrés proclaimed the first annual Bourdain Day as a tribute to Bourdain. That month, the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) established a scholarship in Bourdain&#x27;s honor.

A collection of Bourdain&#x27;s personal items were sold at auction in October 2019, raising $1.8 million, part of which went to support the Anthony Bourdain Legacy Scholarship at his alma mater, the Culinary Institute of America. The remainder went to his family. His custom-made Bob Kramer Steel and Meteorite Chef&#x27;s Knife, sold for the highest price, a record $231,250.

In June 2021, a documentary film directed by Morgan Neville and produced by CNN Films and HBO Max titled &quot;&quot;, had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. It was released by Focus Features on July 16, 2021.

In October 2022, &quot;Down and Out in Paradise: The Life of Anthony Bourdain&quot;, an unauthorized biography of Bourdain, was published.

In August 2024, a biopic of Bourdain titled &quot;Tony&quot; was announced to be in the works, with A24 in negotiations to acquire the film and Dominic Sessa attached to star as Bourdain.

== Interests and advocacy ==
In an assessment of Bourdain&#x27;s life for &quot;The Nation&quot;, David Klion wrote that, &quot;Bourdain understood that the point of journalism is to tell the truth, to challenge the powerful, to expose wrongdoing. But his unique gift was to make doing all that look fun rather than grim or tedious.&quot; According to Klion, Bourdain&#x27;s shows &quot;made it possible to believe that social justice and earthly delights weren&#x27;t mutually exclusive, and he pursued both with the same earnest reverence&quot;.

Bourdain advocated for communicating the value of traditional or peasant foods, including all of the varietal bits and unused animal parts not usually eaten by affluent 21st-century Americans. He also praised the quality of freshly prepared street food in other countries—especially developing countries—compared to fast-food chains in the U.S. Regarding Western moral criticism of cuisine in developing countries, Bourdain stated: &quot;Let&#x27;s call this criticism what it is: &quot;racism&quot;. There are a lot of practices from the developing world that I find personally repellent, from my privileged Western point of view. But I don&#x27;t feel like I have such a moral high ground that I can walk around lecturing people in developing nations on how they should live their lives.&quot;

With regard to criticism of the Chinese, Bourdain stated: &quot;The way in which people dismiss whole centuries-old cultures—often older than their own and usually non-white—with just utter contempt aggravates me. People who suggest I shouldn&#x27;t go to a country like China, look at or film it, because some people eat dog there, I find that racist, frankly. Understand people first: their economic, living situation.&quot; Regarding the myth that monosodium glutamate in Chinese food is unhealthy, Bourdain said: &quot;It&#x27;s a lie. You know what causes Chinese restaurant syndrome? Racism. &#x27;Ooh I have a headache; it must have been the Chinese guy.

In an acceptance speech for an award given by the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Bourdain stated, &quot;The world has visited many terrible things on the Palestinian people, none more shameful than robbing them of their basic humanity.&quot; He opened the episode of &quot;Parts Unknown&quot; on Jerusalem with the prediction that &quot;By the end of this hour, I&#x27;ll be seen by many as a terrorist sympathizer, a Zionist tool, a self-hating Jew, an apologist for American imperialism, an Orientalist, socialist, a fascist, CIA agent, and worse.&quot;

He championed industrious Spanish-speaking immigrants—from Mexico, Ecuador, and other Central and South American countries—who are cooks and chefs in many United States restaurants, including upscale establishments, regardless of cuisine. He considered them talented chefs and invaluable cooks, underpaid and unrecognized even though they have become the backbone of the U.S. restaurant industry.

In 2017, Bourdain became a vocal advocate against sexual harassment in the restaurant industry, speaking out about celebrity chefs Mario Batali and John Besh, and in Hollywood, particularly following his then-girlfriend Asia Argento&#x27;s sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Bourdain accused Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino of &quot;complicity&quot; in the Weinstein sex scandal.

Following the death of Elizabeth II, a 2018 video resurfaced on Twitter showing Bourdain refusing to complete a toast to the Queen, saying &quot;I hate the aristocracy.&quot;

<doc id="595406" wikidata="Q2056775" url="?curid=595406" title="Paternoster Square">
<text>Paternoster Square is a former historic square, renamed from Newgate Market c. 1872, and now a post-war urban redevelopment, owned by the Mitsubishi Estate, next to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in the City of London. The area was previously named Paternoster Row, after the street of the same name, once centre of the London publishing trade and was devastated by aerial bombardment in The Blitz during World War II. It is now the location of the London Stock Exchange which relocated there from Threadneedle Street in 2004. It is also the location of investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill and Nomura Securities, and of fund manager Fidelity Investments. The square itself, i.e. the plaza, is privately owned public space. In 2004, Christopher Wren&#x27;s 1669 Temple Bar Gate was re-erected here as an entrance way to the plaza.

The square is near the top of a modest rise known as Ludgate Hill, formerly one of the two highest points in the City of London. It is characterised by its pedestrianisation and colonnades.

==Historic square==
The historic square was formerly the site of Newgate Market, a meat market serving much of London. By the late nineteenth century it was called Paternoster Square, taking the name from Paternoster Row. It was accessed on the north by Rose Street (originally Roe Street), the west by White Hart Street and the south and east by alleys, which came out in the centre of the sides of the square. In comparison, the modern, extended, White Hart Street meets a longer Rose Street (which now runs just west of the original square) north of the current Paternoster Square. The only area the old and new square have in common is a small strip outside Warwick Court, where part of the building is set further back.

==World War II bombing==
The City of London was hit by one of the heaviest night raids of The Blitz on the night of 29 December 1940. Buildings on Paternoster Row, housing the publishing companies Simpkin &amp; Marshall, Hutchinsons, Blackwood, Longman and Collins were destroyed. St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral remained intact.

==1960s rebuilding==
In 1956, the Corporation of London published Sir William Holford&#x27;s proposals for redeveloping the precinct north of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Holford&#x27;s report attempted to resolve problems of traffic flow in the vicinity of the cathedral, while protecting the cathedral&#x27;s presence as a national monument on some of the highest ground of the City, at the top of Ludgate Hill, on the north bank of the River Thames. The report was controversial, however, because it introduced a decisively modern note alongside the foremost work of Britain&#x27;s foremost 17th-century architect, Christopher Wren.

Rebuilding was carried out between 1961 and 1967, but it involved only part of Holford&#x27;s concept — the area of Paternoster Square between St Paul&#x27;s churchyard and Newgate Street — and this included undistinguished buildings by other architects and the omission of some of Holford&#x27;s features. Robert Finch, the Lord Mayor of London, wrote of it in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2004, that it was made up of &quot;ghastly, monolithic constructions without definition or character&quot;.

==1980s and 1990s==
In the late 1980s, many tenants moved to other London sites, resulting in a number of premises being left vacant. That prompted landlords and the City of London to welcome proposals to redevelop the area. In 1990, architect John Simpson developed a scheme, sponsored by a newspaper competition and championed by the Prince of Wales. It featured classically inspired architecture, which would have been sympathetic with the nearby cathedral.

In 1996, permission was granted for a master plan by Sir William Whitfield, which was finally built. The development was implemented by developers, Stanhope plc and Mitsubishi Estate. By October 2003, the redeveloped square was complete, lined with buildings by Whitfield&#x27;s firm among others. Among the first new tenants was the London Stock Exchange.

==Occupy London and public space controversy==
The London Stock Exchange was the initial target for the protesters of Occupy London on 15 October 2011. Attempts to occupy Paternoster Square were thwarted by police, Police sealed off the entrance to Paternoster Square. A High Court injunction had been granted against public access to the square, defining it as private property. The square was repeatedly described as &#x27;public space&#x27; in the plans for Paternoster Square, meaning the public is granted access but does not designate the square as a right of way under English law, thus the owner can limit access at any time.

==Monuments and sculpture==
The main monument in the redeveloped square is the tall Paternoster Square Column. It is a Corinthian column of Portland stone topped by a gold leaf covered flaming copper urn, which is illuminated by fibre-optic lighting at night. The column was designed by William Whitfield&#x27;s firm Whitfield Partners, and also serves as a ventilation shaft for a service road that runs beneath the square.

At the north end of the square is the bronze &quot;Paternoster&quot; (also known as &quot;Shepherd and Sheep&quot;) by Dame Elisabeth Frink. The statue was commissioned for the previous Paternoster Square complex in 1975, and was given a new plinth following the redevelopment. Another sculpture in the adjoining Paternoster Lane is &quot;Paternoster Vents&quot; by Thomas Heatherwick.

Temple Bar Gate, a Wren-designed stone archway constructed between 1669 and 1672 on Fleet Street at Temple Bar (the historic western ceremonial entrance to the City), has been in front of the cathedral side entrance since 2004. Contractors were paid £3,000,000 to restore it and move it from a site in Theobalds Park by the Corporation of London, which received donations from the Temple Bar Trust and more than one livery company. Its original site on Fleet Street, where it stood until 1878, is occupied by the Temple Bar Memorial.

<text>A Cook&#x27;s Tour: In Search of the Perfect Meal, sometimes later published as A Cook&#x27;s Tour: Global Adventures in Extreme Cuisines, is a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling book written by chef and author Anthony Bourdain in 2001. It is Bourdain&#x27;s account of his world travels – eating exotic local dishes and experiencing life as a native in each country. The book was simultaneously made into a television series featuring Bourdain for the Food Network.

==Locations==
Bourdain&#x27;s travels included Portugal, France, Vietnam, Russia, Morocco, Japan, Cambodia, Mexico, Spain, and French Laundry in Napa Valley.

==Foods==
He tries such exotic dishes as pufferfish, still beating cobra heart, &quot;lobster blood&quot; (a mix of lobster sexual organs and vodka), and soft-boiled balut—duck embryo with half-formed bones and feathers.

==Award==
The book was named 2002 Food Book of the Year by the British Guild of Food Writers.

==Title==
The title is derived from &quot;Cook&#x27;s Tour&quot;, a British idiomatic phrase meaning a brief or cursory guide to a subject or place. Its origin is in the trips organized by Thomas Cook in the 19th century.

<text>Albert John Schultz (29 May 193914 July 2015) was an Australian politician. He was a Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives from October 1998 to August 2013, representing the Division of Hume in New South Wales.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Schultz was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and was a meat processing worker before entering politics. He was a field officer for the Liberal Party (1986–88) and a member of the Cootamundra Shire Council (1983–91).

===Career===
Schultz was the member for Burrinjuck in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1988 to 1998, before being elected to represent Hume at the 1998 federal election. He was subsequently returned at the 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2010 elections. He gained national media attention in the lead up to the privatisation of Telstra claiming that he would not support the legislation but would not &quot;cross the floor&quot;. In the end he abstained from voting on the matter.

Schultz was initially a supporter of Prime Minister John Howard but as a result of being overlooked for promotion by Howard, Schultz in 2005 changed his allegiance to Howard&#x27;s heir apparent Peter Costello.

However a year later in 2006, Schultz accused Costello of disloyalty to Howard following the revelation of a deal of when Howard would hand over the Prime Ministership to Costello.

Alby Schultz was one of the several Liberal Party politicians along with Peter Dutton, Don Randall, Wilson Tuckey, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Dennis Jensen and Sophie Mirabella, who boycotted Parliament on the day that the formal apology to the Stolen Generations was made by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.

Schultz apologised in June 2009 for a physical confrontation with one of his Liberal parliamentary colleagues in a party room meeting in Parliament House. He had been angered by a remark made by Chris Pearce, the member for Aston in Victoria, during a debate about whether the Liberal Party should run candidates against National Party MPs. Schultz reportedly responded by grabbing Pearce around the neck. He later apologised to Pearce and the entire party room for the incident.

In September 2012 he prompted an investigation by the Department of Parliamentary Service about a &quot;serious security breach&quot; when he became aware his private calendar became accessible on other MP&#x27;s computers. The investigation determined that his own office was responsible for the error when configuring the email service, by nominating access to multiple users.

Schultz retired at the 2013 Australian federal election.

In 2015 he was listed as patron of the anti-wind farm lobby, the Waubra Foundation.

==Personal==
In 2003 he lost an eye in an accident with hydrochloric acid while cleaning a swimming pool filter, and in 2004 received a prosthetic eye.

Schultz was a staunch monarchist and long fought against the movement to make Australia a republic.

Not long after his retirement, in May 2013, Schultz was diagnosed with inoperable liver and oesophageal cancer. Two months before the diagnosis, it was revealed he had prostate cancer. He died on 14 July 2015, aged 76.

In pre-modern Japan, Meiwa was best known as the location of the ancient Saikū, the residence of the &quot;Saiō,&quot; an unmarried Imperial princess who, in place of the Emperor, was dispatched to serve as the High Priestess of Ise Grand Shrine to perform three important Shinto rituals. During the Edo period the area developed into a thriving agricultural center and post-town, providing lodging to people making the pilgrimage to Ise Grand Shrine. Ōyodo Village was established on April 1, 1889 during the Meiji period establishment of the modern municipalities system. It was elevated to town status on February 1, 1924, and was renamed Sanwa on September 3, 1955. In 1958, the town of Sanwa and the neighboring village of Saimei merged to form the town of Meiwa.

==Government==
Meiwa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 14 members. Meiwa, collectively with the other municipalities of Taki District, contributes two members to the Mie Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Mie 4th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

<text>File verification is the process of using an algorithm for verifying the integrity of a computer file, usually by checksum. This can be done by comparing two files bit-by-bit, but requires two copies of the same file, and may miss systematic corruptions which might occur to both files. A more popular approach is to generate a hash of the copied file and comparing that to the hash of the original file.

== Integrity verification ==
File integrity can be compromised, usually referred to as the file becoming corrupted. A file can become corrupted by a variety of ways: faulty storage media, errors in transmission, write errors during copying or moving, software bugs, and so on.

Hash-based verification ensures that a file has not been corrupted by comparing the file&#x27;s hash value to a previously calculated value. If these values match, the file is presumed to be unmodified. Due to the nature of hash functions, hash collisions may result in false positives, but the likelihood of collisions is often negligible with random corruption.

== Authenticity verification ==
It is often desirable to verify that a file hasn&#x27;t been modified in transmission or storage by untrusted parties, for example, to include malicious code such as viruses or backdoors. To verify the authenticity, a classical hash function is not enough as they are not designed to be collision resistant; it is computationally trivial for an attacker to cause deliberate hash collisions, meaning that a malicious change in the file is not detected by a hash comparison. In cryptography, this attack is called a preimage attack.

For this purpose, cryptographic hash functions are employed often. As long as the hash sums cannot be tampered with — for example, if they are communicated over a secure channel — the files can be presumed to be intact. Alternatively, digital signatures can be employed to assure tamper resistance.

== File formats ==
A checksum file is a small file that contains the checksums of other files.

There are a few well-known checksum file formats.

Several utilities, such as md5deep, can use such checksum files to automatically verify an entire directory of files in one operation.

The particular hash algorithm used is often indicated by the file extension of the checksum file.

The &quot;.sha1&quot; file extension indicates a checksum file containing 160-bit SHA-1 hashes in sha1sum format.

The &quot;.md5&quot; file extension, or a file named &quot;MD5SUMS&quot;, indicates a checksum file containing 128-bit MD5 hashes in md5sum format.

The &quot;.sfv&quot; file extension indicates a checksum file containing 32-bit CRC32 checksums in simple file verification format.

The &quot;crc.list&quot; file indicates a checksum file containing 32-bit CRC checksums in brik format.

As of 2012, best practice recommendations is to use SHA-2 or SHA-3 to generate new file integrity digests; and to accept MD5 and SHA-1 digests for backward compatibility if stronger digests are not available.
The theoretically weaker SHA-1, the weaker MD5, or much weaker CRC were previously commonly used for file integrity checks.

CRC checksums cannot be used to verify the authenticity of files, as CRC32 is not a collision resistant hash function -- even if the hash sum file is not tampered with, it is computationally trivial for an attacker to replace a file with the same CRC digest as the original file, meaning that a malicious change in the file is not detected by a CRC comparison.

Tamaki was the site of a Sengoku period Japanese castle, Tamaru Castle, which dominated the surrounding area, including access to the Ise Grand Shrines. The castle was initially built by Kitabatake Chikafusa of the Kitabatake Clan in 1336, to serve as a base of operations for Emperor Go-Daigo&#x27;s Southern Court during the conflict between the Northern and Southern Court known as the Nanboku-chō period. The castle was destroyed in the early Meiji period.

Tamaru Town was created within Watarai District of Mie Prefecture with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It merged with the neighboring village of Higashitokida and assumed its present name on April 10, 1955.

==Government==
Tamaki has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 13 members. Tamaki, collectively with the other municipalities of Watari District, contributes two members to the Mie Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Mie 4th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The town serves as a commercial center for the surrounding region. &quot;Tamaki Pork&quot; is a local speciality.

==Education==
Tamaki has four public elementary schools and one public middle school operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school. There is one special education school for the handicapped operated by the Mie Prefectural Board of Education.

<text>was a town in Watarai District, Mie Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 9,008 and a density of 754.44 persons per km². The total area was 11.94 km².

On November 1, 2005, Futami, along with the town of Obata, and the village of Misono (all from Watarai District), was merged into the expanded city of Ise and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

The Meoto Iwa are two &quot;wedded rocks&quot;, in the sea by the town.

Futami is mentioned by Matsuo Bashō in his haiku &quot;hamaguri no / futami ni wakare / yuku aki zo&quot;. Literally, Hamaguri clams of Futami break apart in Autumn. Poetically,&lt;br&gt;
As firmly cemented clam shells&lt;br&gt;
Fall apart in Autumn&lt;br&gt;
So too, I take to the road again

==Personal life==

Koneru Humpy was born in Gudivada, Andhra Pradesh, on 31 March 1987. She was originally named &quot;Hampi&quot; by her parents, Koneru Ashok and Koneru Latha, who derived the name from the word champion. Her father later changed the spelling to Humpy, to more closely resemble a Russian-sounding name. She was coached in chess at a young age by her father Ashok after he discovered her talent when she suggested a move as played out by a game from &quot;The Chess Informator&quot;. It was 1993, and Humpy was six-years-old then. In the same year, Humpy won the Vijayawada city and Krishna district under-eight championships. She won the State-level championships in 1994 and 1995 and qualified for the national under-eight championship for girls in Madurai in 1995, where she finished fourth. From that year, her father started coaching her exclusively. She would then go on to win the national under-10 championship for girls in 1996 in Mumbai, which led to a qualification for the 1997 World Under-10 Girls Chess Championship at Cannes, France, which she would go on to win.

In August 2014, Humpy married Dasari Anvesh. They have a daughter together named Ahana (b. 2017). Since 2016, Humpy has been working with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC).

<text>was a village located in Minamimuro District, Mie Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2004 (the last official figures before its dissolution), the village had an estimated population of 4,852 and a population density of 1684.7 persons per km2. The total area was 2.88 km2.

On January 10, 2006, Udono was merged into the expanded town of Kihō and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality. As a result, this merger, all villages in Mie Prefecture have ceased to exist.

The village of Udono was founded on February 13, 1894, with the early Meiji period establishment of municipalities. The basis of the village&#x27;s economy was a paper mill operated by Hokuetsu Paper Mills.

<text>Habitat II,the Second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, was held in Istanbul, Turkey, from 3–14 June 1996, twenty years after Habitat I held in Vancouver, Canada, in 1976. Popularly called the &quot;City Summit&quot;, it brought together high-level representatives of national and local governments, as well as private sector, NGOs, research and training institutions and the media. Universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and human settlements safer, healthier and more livable cities, inspired by the Charter of the United Nations, were discussed and endorsed.

Habitat II received its impetus from the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and General Assembly resolution A/RES/47/180. The conference outcomes were integrated in the Istanbul Declaration and the Habitat Agenda, and adopted as a new global action plan to realize sustainable human settlements. The Secretary-General of the Conference was Dr. Wally N&#x27;Dow.

The objectives for Habitat II were stated as: in the long term, to arrest the deterioration of global human settlements conditions and ultimately create the conditions for achieving improvements in the living environment of all people on a sustainable basis, with special attention to the needs and contributions of women and vulnerable social groups whose quality of life and participation in development have been hampered by exclusion and inequality, affecting the poor in general; to adopt a general statement of principles and commitments and formulate a related global plan of action capable of guiding national and international efforts through the first two decades of the next century.

A new mandate for the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (UNCHS) was derived to support and monitor the implementation of the Habitat Agenda adopted at the Conference and approved by the General Assembly.

Habitat III met in Quito, Ecuador, from 17–20 October 2016.

==Previous negotiations==
The organizational session of the Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) for Habitat II was held at UN Headquarters in New York from 3–5 March 1993. Delegates elected the Bureau and took decisions regarding the organization and timing of the process. The First Substantive Session of the Preparatory Committee of the PrepCom was held in Geneva from 11–22 April 1994. Delegates agreed that the overriding objective of the Conference was to increase world awareness of the problems and potentials of human settlements as important inputs to social progress and economic growth, and to commit the world&#x27;s leaders to making cities, towns and villages healthy, safe, just and sustainable. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin prepared a comprehensive report on the first session of the PrepCom. The PrepCom also took decisions on the organization of the Conference and financing, in addition to the areas of: National Objectives, International Objectives, Participation, Draft Statement of Principles and Commitments and Draft Global Plan of Action.

==Habitat II at the 49th United Nations General Assembly==
The Second Committee of the UN General Assembly addressed Habitat II from 8–16 November 1994. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin prepared a year-end update report on Habitat II preparations that included a report on the General Assembly&#x27;s treatment of this agenda item. A draft resolution on the &quot;United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II)&quot; (A/C.2/49/L.27) was first tabled by the co-sponsors, Algeria, on behalf of the G-77 and China, and Turkey. After informal consultations by members of the Second Committee, the Vice Chair, Raiko Raichev (Bulgaria) submitted a new draft resolution (A/C.2/49/L.61). This resolution was adopted as orally amended by the Committee on 9 December 1994.The operative part of the resolution, as contained in L.61, took note of the reports of the PrepCom on its organizational session and first substantive session and endorsed the decisions contained therein. The resolution approved the PrepCom&#x27;s recommendation that a third substantive session of the PrepCom be held at UN Headquarters early in 1996 to complete the preparatory work for the Conference.

==The Second Session of the Habitat II Preparatory Committee==
The Second Substantive Session of the PrepCom was held in Nairobi, Kenya, from the 24 April - 5 May 1995. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin published a summary of the meeting.

==The Third Session of the Habitat II Preparatory Committee==
The Third Session of the Habitat II Preparatory Committee was held in New York from 5–17 February 1996. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin published a summary of the meeting

<text>King Missile is an American avant-garde art rock band best known for its 1992 humorous single &quot;Detachable Penis&quot;. Vocalist John S. Hall has fronted several disparate incarnations of the group since founding it in 1986.

==History==

===King Missile (Dog Fly Religion)===
In 1985, writer John S. Hall began presenting his work at open mic poetry readings. After three shows, Hall became a &quot;featured&quot; poet at the Backfence, a performance venue in Manhattan&#x27;s Greenwich Village. In 1986, feeling that &quot;20 minutes of me reading poetry would be totally boring&quot;, Hall asked his guitarist friend Dogbowl (Stephen Tunney) to augment his performances with original music. Dogbowl agreed, and with the addition of bassist Alex DeLaszlo, drummer R. B. Korbet, and xylophonist George O&#x27;Malley, King Missile (Dog Fly Religion) was born.

In 1987, the band went to the Noise New York studio and in just ten hours recorded and mixed its debut album, &quot;Fluting on the Hump.&quot; The producer/engineer, Kramer, released the album on his then-fledgling label, Shimmy Disc. The label sent the album to every college radio station that reported to &quot;College Media Journal,&quot; and the album subsequently performed well on the CMJ charts.

In 1988, Hall and Dogbowl, along with cellist Charles Curtis and new drummer Steve Dansiger, recorded the second King Missile (Dog Fly Religion) album, the longer, more experimental, less &quot;jokey&quot; &quot;They.&quot; Like its predecessor, the album was produced by Kramer and released on Shimmy Disc. According to Hall, &quot;[the album] wasn&#x27;t well received. Dogbowl was itching to make his own records, so we went our separate ways.&quot; Dogbowl went on to record several albums for Shimmy Disc.

In September of 2023, Hall, Dogbowl, Korbet (now on bass), and DeLaszlo were joined by percussionists Susan Hwang and Marlon Cherry for a performance, at the City Winery Loft in New York City. The following year, Hall, Dogbowl, Korbet, Hwang, and Cherry began work on a new King Missile (Dog Fly Religion) album, to be released in 2025.

===King Missile===
After Dogbowl&#x27;s departure, Hall asked Bongwater guitarist Dave Rick to help him put together a new band. Rick recruited multi-instrumentalist Chris Xefos, and Hall retained Dansiger on drums. Hall dubbed the new lineup King Missile, dropping the parenthetical &quot;Dog Fly Religion&quot; subtitle &quot;since that was [Dogbowl&#x27;s] idea.&quot; In late 1989 and early 1990, the band recorded the album &quot;Mystical Shit,&quot; and in 1990 released it on Shimmy Disc. On the strength of the single &quot;Jesus Was Way Cool&quot;, the album hit No. 1 on the CMJ charts, and the band was signed by a major label, Atlantic Records. This series of events led Hall to make a habit of joking, &quot;&#x27;Jesus&#x27; got me signed to Atlantic Records.&quot; Around this time, King Missile was featured in the 1990 documentary &quot;CutTime&quot;, which chronicled the East Village music scene of the time.

Another lineup change occurred before the recording of King Missile&#x27;s major-label debut, as Dansiger left the band and was replaced on drums by Hypnolovewheel member David Ramirez. The subsequent album, &quot;The Way to Salvation,&quot; was released on April 16, 1991, and reached No. 2 on the CMJ charts. Atlantic promoted the album with the release of a single, &quot;My Heart Is a Flower&quot;, and accompanying video.

After Ramirez left the group and was replaced by yet another drummer, Roger Murdock, the band recorded a cover of R.E.M.&#x27;s song &quot;Get Up&quot; for the album, &quot;Surprise Your Pig: A Tribute to R.E.M.&quot;, released on June 22, 1992. This was followed by the band&#x27;s second major-label album, &quot;Happy Hour,&quot; released on December 15, 1992. The album debuted at No. 1 on the CMJ charts, and its accompanying first single, &quot;Detachable Penis&quot;, became a modest hit, reaching No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. Atlantic released videos for &quot;Detachable Penis&quot; and the subsequent singles &quot;(Why Are We) Trapped?&quot; and &quot;Martin Scorsese&quot;, but neither follow-up single achieved the chart success of &quot;Detachable Penis.&quot; According to Hall, the band realized that its hit song had drawn in many casual fans who didn&#x27;t care about the rest of the group&#x27;s material; thus, the band began to play the song &quot;early in the set, so that the people who didn&#x27;t like us could leave, and we could play for the people who cared. That worked out well. People did leave.&quot;

In 1993, the band contributed a song titled &quot;Our Jungle&quot; to the soundtrack of the film &quot;Surf Ninjas&quot; starring Ernie Reyes, Jr., Rob Schneider, Nicolas Cowan and Leslie Nielsen.

The band&#x27;s third and final album for Atlantic was the eponymous &quot;King Missile,&quot; released April 19, 1994. Neither the album nor its lead single, &quot;Love Is...&quot;, was a commercial success; consequently, the band was dropped from Atlantic, and broke up shortly thereafter because, according to Hall, &quot;there was no reason to stay together.&quot;

===King Missile III===
After the collapse of the second incarnation of King Missile, Hall decided to attend law school. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in Manhattan, and after graduation co-founded Heraty Hall, a firm specializing in entertainment law.

In 1996, Hall released a &quot;solo album&quot;, &quot;The Body Has a Head,&quot; on the German label Manifatture Criminali. The album featured considerable input from multi-instrumentalists Sasha Forte, Bradford Reed, and Jane Scarpantoni. With these musicians, as well as &quot;They&quot; cellist Curtis, Hall formed a new band, King Missile III. On September 15, 1998, the new lineup released its &quot;debut&quot; album, &quot;Failure,&quot; on Shimmy Disc.

Curtis and Scarpantoni left the band after the release of &quot;Failure,&quot; and King Missile III continued as a trio, releasing two more albums: &quot;The Psychopathology of Everyday Life&quot; (Instinct Records, January 21, 2003) and &quot;Royal Lunch&quot; (Important Records, September 21, 2004).

===King Missile IV===
In September 2014, John S. Hall performed four shows with the band LoveyDove in Los Angeles. It was later decided that this was, in fact, a new incarnation of King Missile, and they settled on the name King Missile IV. This version of the group toured New Zealand in February 2015, and recorded a six-song EP, &quot;This Fuckin&#x27; Guy&quot;, released on Powertool Records. In 2019, King Missile IV changed their name to You, Me and This Fuckin’ Guy and recorded their debut LP, &quot;Garden Variety Fuckers&quot;, released by Dromedary Records on April 17, 2020.

===Reunions===
Hall reunited with Dogbowl in 1995 for a tour as King Missile (Dog Fly Religion) for most of October and November of that year. The tour featured Hall performing spoken word with Sasha Forte on violin, followed by performance by Dogbowl and his band, and featuring Hall, Forte, Dogbowl and his band all performing together as King Missile (Dog Fly Religion) to headline the shows. On March 18, 2010, Hall reunited with Dogbowl as King Missile (Dog-Fly Religion) for a one-time performance at Le Poisson Rouge in New York City. Multi-instrumentalist John Kruth, bassist Dave Dreiwitz of Ween, and drummer Billy Ficca of Television joined the duo to round out the lineup.

On June 25, 2015, Hall, Rick, and Murdock reunited for the first time in over twenty years for a performance at Shea Stadium in Bushwick, Brooklyn. They were joined by Rachel Swaner on keyboards and accordion. The set consisted of songs from throughout the various King Missile incarnations. Hall, Rick, and Murdock played several more shows along with keyboardist Brent Cordero between 2015 and 2019. On February 18, 2017, keyboardist and bassist Chris Xefos rejoined the group for a performance at The Gutter Bar in Brooklyn. On February 10, 2018, King Missile, featuring the lineup of Hall, Rick, Murdock, Cordero and Korbet performed at a benefit for radio station, WFDU at Rose Gold in Brooklyn. A show at Bowery Electric in New York City followed on June 21, 2018, featuring the lineup of Hall, Rick, Murdock, Cordero, and Korbet. On May 11, 2019, King Missile performed with Hall, Rick, Murdock, Cordero, and Matt Hunter at Hank&#x27;s Saloon in Brooklyn. Dogbowl performed an opening set and also joined King Missile on stage for several songs.

<text>The Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) is the modern archaeological designation for a particular Middle Bronze Age civilisation of southern Central Asia, also known as the Oxus Civilization. The civilisation&#x27;s urban phase or Integration Era, was dated in 2010 by Sandro Salvatori to –1950 BC, but a different view is held by Nadezhda A. Dubova and Bertille Lyonnet, –1700 BC.

Though it may be called the &quot;Oxus civilization&quot;, apparently centred on the upper Amu Darya (Oxus River) in Bactria, most of the BMAC&#x27;s urban sites are actually located in Margiana (modern Turkmenistan) on the Murghab river delta, and in the Kopet Dagh mountain range. There are a few later (–1450 BC) sites in northern Bactria, currently known as southern Uzbekistan, but they are mostly graveyards belonging to the BMAC-related Sapalli culture. A single BMAC site, known as &quot;Dashli&quot;, lies in southern Bactria, current territory of northern Afghanistan. Sites found further east, in southwestern Tajikistan, though contemporary with the main BMAC sites in Margiana, are only graveyards, with no urban developments associated with them.

The civilisation was named BMAC by the Soviet archaeologist Viktor Sarianidi in 1976, during the period (1969–1979) when he was excavating in northern Afghanistan. Sarianidi&#x27;s excavations from the late 1970s onward revealed numerous monumental structures in many sites, fortified by impressive walls and gates. Reports on the BMAC were mostly confined to Soviet journals. A journalist from &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 2001 that during the years of the Soviet Union, the findings were largely unknown to the West until Sarianidi&#x27;s work began to be translated in the 1990s. However, some publications by Soviet authors, like Masson, Sarianidi, Atagarryev, and Berdiev, had been available to the West, translated in the first half of 1970s, slightly before Sarianidi labelled the findings as BMAC.

==Origin and chronology==
Italian archaeologists, like Massimo Vidale and Dennys Frenez, support Sandro Salvatori&#x27;s hypothesis that Namazga V is the beginning of the ultimate urban phase called BMAC, belonging to the Integration Era (c. 2400–1950 BC). On the other hand, Russian and French archaeologists Nadezhda Dubova and Bertille Lyonnet consider there was a gap between the end of Namazga III phase and the beginning of BMAC in Margiana, and that most of the sites both in Margiana and Bactria were founded on virgin soil only around 2250 BC lasting until 1700 BC.

==Etymology==
The region was first named Bakhdi in Old Persian, which then formed the Persian satrapy of Marguš (perhaps from the Sumerian term Marhasi), the capital of which was Merv, in modern-day southeastern Turkmenistan. It was then called &quot;Bāxtriš&quot; in Middle Persian, and &quot;Baxl&quot; in New Persian. The region was also mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts as बाह्लीक or &quot;Bāhlīka&quot;. The modern term &quot;Bactria&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek: Βακτριανή (Romanized Greek term: Baktrianē) (modern Balkh), which came from the Sanskrit term.

==Early Food-Producing Era==
There is archaeological evidence of settlement in the well-watered northern foothills of the Kopet Dag during the Neolithic period at Jeitun (or Djeitun). In this region, mud brick houses were first occupied during the Early Food-Producing Era, also known as Jeitun Neolithic, from c. 7200 to 4600 BC. The inhabitants were farmers with origins in southwest Asia, who kept herds of goats and sheep and grew wheat and barley. Jeitun has given its name to the whole Neolithic period in the northern foothills of the Kopet Dag. At the late Neolithic site of Chagylly Depe, farmers increasingly grew the kinds of crops that are typically associated with irrigation in an arid environment, such as hexaploid bread wheat, which became predominant during the Chalcolithic period. This region is dotted with the multi-period hallmarks characteristic of the ancient Near East, similar to those southwest of the Kopet Dag in the Gorgan Plain in Iran.

==Regionalization Era==
The Regionalization Era begins in Anau IA with a pre-Chalcolithic phase also in the Kopet Dag piedmont region from 4600 to 4000 BC, then the Chalcolithic period develops from 4000 to 2800 BC in Namazga I-III, Ilgynly Depe, and Altyn Depe. During this Copper Age, the population of the region grew. Archaeologist Vadim Mikhaĭlovich Masson, who led the South Turkmenistan Complex Archaeological Expedition of 1946, saw signs that people migrated to the region from central Iran at this time, bringing metallurgy and other innovations, but thought that the newcomers soon blended with the Jeitun farmers. (Vadim was the son of archaeologist Mikhail Masson, who had previously already started work in this same area.) By contrast, a re-excavation of Monjukli Depe in 2010 found a distinct break in settlement history between the late neolithic and early chalcolithic eras there.

Major chalcolithic settlements sprang up at Kara-Depe and Namazga-Depe. In addition, there were smaller settlements at Anau, Dashlyji, and Yassy-depe. Settlements similar to the early level at Anau also appeared further east– in the ancient delta of the river Tedzen, the site of the Geoksiur Oasis. About 3500 BC, the cultural unity of the area split into two pottery styles: colourful in the west (Anau, Kara-Depe and Namazga-Depe) and more austere in the east at Altyn-Depe and the Geoksiur Oasis settlements. This may reflect the formation of two tribal groups. It seems that around 3000 BC, people from Geoksiur migrated into the Murghab delta (where small, scattered settlements appeared) and reached further east into the Zerafshan Valley in Transoxiana. In both areas pottery typical of Geoksiur was in use. In Transoxiana they settled at Sarazm near Pendjikent. To the south the foundation layers of Shahr-i Sōkhta on the bank of the Helmand River in south-eastern Iran contained pottery of the Altyn-Depe and Geoksiur type. Thus the farmers of Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan were connected by a scattering of farming settlements.

==Late Regionalization Era==
In Kopet Dag region, at Altyn Depe, the Namazga III phase lasted (c. 3200–2800 BC) and showed a late Chalcolithic culture, at the beginning of Late Regionalization Era.
In the Early Bronze Age, at the end of Late Regionalization Era (2800 to 2400 BC), the culture of the Kopet Dag oases in Altyn-Depe site developed a proto-urban society. This corresponds to phase IV at Namazga-Depe. Altyn-Depe was a major centre even then. Pottery was wheel-turned. Grapes were grown.

==Integration Era: Oxus Civilization==
The height of the urban development was reached in the Middle Bronze Age, also known as Integration Era, mainly in three regions, Kopet Dag piedmont, Margiana, and southern Bactria, as well as some cemetery remains recently found in southwestern Tajikistan.

===Kopet Dag, Namazga V phase===
BMAC&#x27;s urban period begins in the Kopet Dag piedmont, as per Massimo Vidale, corresponding to Namazga-Depe level V (-2000 BC). Namazga Depe reaching c. 52 hectares and holding maybe 17–20,000 inhabitants, and Altyn Depe with its maximum size of c. 25 hectares and 7–10,000 inhabitants, were the two big cities in Kopet Dag piedmont. This urban development is considered to have lasted, not from 2400 BC, but from to 1700 BC by Lyonnet and Dubova&#x27;s recent publication.

===Margiana, Kelleli phase===
Identification of the first large settling in Margiana was possible through excavations at Kelleli 3 and 4, and these are the type sites of Kelleli phase. Massimo Vidale (2017) considers that the Kelleli phase was characterised by the appearance of the first palatial compounds from 2400 to 2000 BC. Kelleli is located around 40 km northwest of Gonur; featuring Kelleli 3 with four hectares, characterised by towers in a double perimetral wall, four equal entrances, and houses in the southwest of the site. Kelleli 4 settlement is around three hectares, with the same characteristics in its wall. Sandro Salvatori (1998) commented that Kelleli phase began sightly later than Namazga V period.

===Margiana, Gonur phase===
Gonur phase was considered, by Sarianidi, as a southward movement of the previous Kelleli phase people. In the ancient region of Margiana, the site Gonur Depe is the largest of all settlements in this period and is located at the delta of Murghab river in southern Turkmenistan, with an area of around 55 hectares. An almost elliptical fortified complex, known as Gonur North includes the so-called &quot;Monumental Palace&quot;, other minor buildings, temples and ritual places, together with the &quot;Royal Necropolis&quot;, and water reservoirs, all dated by Italian archaeologists from around 2400 to 1900 BC. However French and Russian scholars like Lyonnet and Dubova date it to -1700 BC.

===Southern Bactria===
In southern Bactria, northern Afghanistan, the site Dashly 3 is regarded to be also from Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age (2300–1700 BC) occupation, but its beginning is probably later than 2300 BC, although earlier than 2000 BC, if new datings for BMAC by Lyonnet and Dubova are taken into account. The old Dashly 3 complex, sometimes identified as a palace, is a fortified rectangular 88 m x 84 m compound. The square building had massive double outer walls and in the middle of each wall was a protruding salient composed of a T-shaped corridor flanked by two L-shaped corridors.

===Southwestern Tajikistan===
New archaeological research has recently found at three ancient cemeteries in southwestern Tajikistan called Farkhor, Gelot (in Kulob District), and Darnajchi, ceramics influenced by Namazga IV and Namazga V transitional period from Early to Middle Bronze Age, which can suggest a presence of BMAC inhabitants in this region earlier considered out of their influx. Gelot&#x27;s grave N6-13 was dated to 2203–2036 cal BC (2 sigma), and Darnajchi&#x27;s grave N2-2 as 2456-2140 cal BC (2 sigma). Farkhor&#x27;s cemetery is located on the right bank of Panj river, very near the Indus Civilization&#x27;s site Shortughai.

==Material culture==
===Agriculture and economy===
The inhabitants of the BMAC were sedentary people who practised irrigation farming of wheat and barley. With their impressive material culture including monumental architecture, bronze tools, ceramics, and jewellery of semiprecious stones, the complex exhibits many of the hallmarks of civilisation. The complex can be compared to proto-urban settlements in the Helmand basin at Mundigak in western Afghanistan and Shahr-e Sukhteh in eastern Iran, or at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley.

Models of two-wheeled carts from found at Altyn-Depe are the earliest evidence of wheeled transport in Central Asia, though model wheels have come from contexts possibly somewhat earlier. Judging by the type of harness, carts were initially pulled by oxen or a bull. However, camels were domesticated within the BMAC. A model of a cart drawn by a camel of was found at Altyn-Depe.

===Art===
Fertility goddesses, named &quot;Bactrian princesses&quot;, made from limestone, chlorite and clay reflect agrarian Bronze Age society, while the extensive corpus of metal objects point to a sophisticated tradition of metalworking. Wearing large stylised dresses, as well as headdresses that merge with the hair, &quot;Bactrian princesses&quot; embody the ranking goddess, character of the Central Asian mythology that plays a regulatory role, pacifying the untamed forces.

===Architecture===

Sarianidi regards Gonur as the &quot;capital&quot; of the complex in Margiana throughout the Bronze Age. The palace of north Gonur measures 150 metres by 140 metres, the temple at Togolok 140 metres by 100 metres, the fort at Kelleli 3 125 metres by 125 metres, and the house of a local ruler at Adji Kui 25 metres by 25 metres. Each of these formidable structures has been extensively excavated. While they all have impressive fortification walls, gates, and buttresses, it is not always clear why one structure is identified as a temple and another as a palace. Mallory points out that the BMAC fortified settlements such as Gonur and Togolok resemble the qila, the type of fort known in this region in the historical period. They may be circular or rectangular and have up to three encircling walls. Within the forts are residential quarters, workshops and temples.

The people of the BMAC culture were very proficient at working in a variety of metals including bronze, copper, silver, and gold. This is attested through the many metal artefacts found throughout the sites.

Extensive irrigation systems have been discovered at the Geoksiur Oasis.

===Writing===
The discovery of a single tiny stone seal (known as the &quot;Anau seal&quot;) with geometric markings from the BMAC site at Anau in Turkmenistan in 2000 led some to claim that the Bactria-Margiana complex had also developed writing, and thus may indeed be considered a literate civilisation. It bears five markings which are similar to Chinese &quot;small seal&quot; characters. The only match to the Anau seal is a small jet seal of almost identical shape from Niyä (near modern Minfeng) along the southern Silk Road in Xinjiang, originally thought to be from the Western Han dynasty but now thought to date to 700 BC.

==Archaeological interactions with neighbouring cultures==

BMAC materials have been found in the Indus Valley civilisation, on the Iranian Plateau, and in the Persian Gulf. Finds within BMAC sites provide further evidence of trade and cultural contacts. They include an Elamite-type cylinder seal and a Harappan seal stamped with an elephant and Indus script found at Gonur-depe. The relationship between Altyn-Depe and the Indus Valley seems to have been particularly strong. Among the finds there were two Harappan seals and ivory objects. The Harappan settlement of Shortugai in Northern Afghanistan on the banks of the Amu Darya probably served as a trading station.

There is evidence of sustained contact between the BMAC and the Eurasian steppes to the north, intensifying . In the delta of the Amu Darya where it reaches the Aral Sea, its waters were channelled for irrigation agriculture by people whose remains resemble those of the nomads of the Andronovo culture. This is interpreted as nomads settling down to agriculture, after contact with the BMAC, known as the Tazabagyab culture. About 1900 BC, the walled BMAC centres decreased sharply in size. Each oasis developed its own types of pottery and other objects. Also pottery of the Tazabagyab-Andronovo culture to the north appeared widely in the Bactrian and Margian countryside. Many BMAC strongholds continued to be occupied and Tazabagyab-Andronovo coarse incised pottery occurs within them (along with the previous BMAC pottery) as well as in pastoral camps outside the mudbrick walls. In the highlands above the Bactrian oases in Tajikistan, kurgan cemeteries of the Vaksh and Bishkent type appeared with pottery that mixed elements of the late BMAC and Tazabagyab-Andronovo traditions. In southern Bactrian sites like Sappali Tepe too, increasing links with the Andronovo culture are seen. During the period 1700 – 1500 BCE, metal artefacts from Sappali Tepe derive from the Tazabagyab-Andronovo culture.

New research in the Murghab region, in excavations at defensive walls of Adji Kui 1, showed pastoralists present, and living on the edge of the town, as early as the second half of the Middle Bronze Age (-1960 BC), coexisting with the BMAC population that lived in the &#x27;citadel.&#x27;

==Relationship with Indo-Iranians==
The Bactria–Margiana complex has attracted attention as a candidate for those looking for the material counterparts to the Indo-Iranians (Aryans), a major linguistic branch that split off from the Proto-Indo-Europeans.

For example, Sarianidi advocated identifying the complex as Indo-Iranian, describing it as the result of a migration from southwestern Iran. Bactria–Margiana material has been found at Susa, Shahdad, and Tepe Yahya in Iran. 

Mallory/Adams (1997) associated the Andronovo, BMAC and Yaz cultures with Indo-Iranian migrations, writing,
Anthony (2007) sees the culture as begun by farmers in the Near Eastern Neolithic tradition, but infiltrated by Indo-Iranian speakers from the Andronovo culture in its late phase, creating a hybrid. In this perspective, Proto-Indo-Aryan developed within the composite culture before moving south into the Indian subcontinent.

===Possible evidence for a BMAC substratum in Indo-Iranian===

As argued by Michael Witzel and Alexander Lubotsky, there is a proposed substratum in Proto-Indo-Iranian which can be plausibly identified with the original language of the BMAC. Moreover, Lubotsky points out a larger number of words apparently borrowed from the same language, which are only attested in Indo-Aryan and therefore evidence of a substratum in Vedic Sanskrit. He explains this by proposing that Indo-Aryan speakers probably formed the vanguard of the movement into south-central Asia and many of the BMAC loanwords which entered Iranian may have been mediated through Indo-Aryan. Michael Witzel points out that the borrowed vocabulary includes words from agriculture, village and town life, flora and fauna, ritual and religion, so providing evidence for the acculturation of Indo-Iranian speakers into the world of urban civilisation.

In excavations at Gonur Depe, at a brick-lined burial pit, grave number 3200 of the Royal necropolis, a horse skeleton was found in period I, dated around 2200 BCE along with a four-wheeled wooden wagon with bronze rims. Archaeologist Julio Bendezu-Sarmiento, mentioning N. A. Dubova&#x27;s (2015) article, comments that this was an &quot;almost complete skeleton of a foal&quot; resting on the wagon with &quot;wheels circled by bronze bands&quot; and radiocarbon-dated to 2250 BCE. So he considers this horse and the wagon are &quot;one and a half century prior&quot; to similar burials of Sintashta culture. A stone statuette that seems to be a horse with saddle was found in burial number 3210 also in the Royal necropolis and was reported by Sarianidi in 2005, and in burial 3310 parts of a stallion&#x27;s body were found, the stallion lacked its head, rump, and tail, and was considered as a cult burial of a domestic horse by archaeologist Sarianidi in his 2008 publication.

==Genetics==
In 2019, Narasimhan and co-authors analysed BMAC skeletons from the Bronze Age sites of Bustan, Dzharkutan, Gonur Tepe, and Sappali Tepe. The BMAC population largely derived from preceding local Copper Age peoples who were in turn related to Neolithic farmers from the Iranian plateau and to a lesser extent early Anatolian farmers, as well as hunter-gatherers from Western Siberia (WSHG). The samples extracted from the BMAC sites did not have derived any part of their ancestry from the Yamnaya people, who are associated with Proto-Indo-Europeans, although some peripheral samples did already carry significant Yamnaya-like Western Steppe Herders ancestry, inline with the southwards expansion of Western Steppe Herders from the Sintashta and Andronovo cultures towards Southern Central Asia at c. 2100 BCE. Succeeding cultures, specifically the Yaz culture, was characterised by a combination of BMAC and Yamnaya/WSH ancestries, and associated with early Indo-Iranians. Narasimshan et al. (2019) found no essential genetic contributions from the BMAC in later South Asians, suggesting that the Steppe-related ancestry was mediated via other groups. The male specimens belonged primarily to haplogroup J, specifically J* (3/26), J1 (1/26), J2 (7/26), as well as G (2/26), L (2/26), R2 (3/26), R1b (1/26), R* (2/26), H1a (1/26), P (1/26), Q (1/26), T (1/26) and E1b1b (1/26).

Genetic data on Iron Age samples from modern-day Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan confirm the admixture between local BMAC groups and Andronovo-related populations, at the end of Oxus Civilization. These Southern Central Asian Iron Age population derived around 57% of their ancestry from Western Steppe Herders (Andronovo) and c. 43% from the BMAC culture population. Modern day Tajiks and Yaghnobis were found to be direct descendants of the Bronze and Iron Age Central Asian populations, deriving ancestry from both the Yamnaya-like Western Steppe Herders and BMAC groups, and showing genetic continuity to historical Indo-Iranians. These Iron Age Central Asians also displayed a higher genetic affinity to present-day Europeans than present-day Uzbeks, who harbour an additional component derived from an East Asian-like source &quot;through several admixture events over the past ~2,000  years&quot;, absent from Iron Age Uzbeks and modern Europeans.

<doc id="595487" wikidata="Q1148469" url="?curid=595487" title="Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika">
<text>&quot;&quot; (, ) is a Christian hymn composed in 1897 by Enoch Sontonga, a Xhosa clergyman at a Methodist mission school near Johannesburg.

The song became a pan-African liberation song and versions of it were later adopted as the national anthems of five countries in Africa including Zambia, Tanzania, Namibia and Zimbabwe after independence, and South Africa after the end of apartheid. The song&#x27;s melody is still used as the national anthem of Tanzania and the national anthem of Zambia (Zimbabwe and Namibia have since changed to new anthems with other melodies).

In 1994, Nelson Mandela decreed that the verse of be embraced as a joint national anthem of South Africa; a revised version additionally including elements of &quot;Die Stem&quot; (the then co-state anthem inherited from the previous apartheid government) was adopted in 1997. This new South African national anthem is sometimes referred to as &quot;&quot; although it is not its official name.

The hymn is also often considered the unofficial African &quot;national&quot; anthem. According to anthropologist David Coplan: &quot;&quot; has come to symbolize more than any other piece of expressive culture the struggle for African unity and liberation in South Africa.&quot;

== History ==

&quot;&quot; was composed in 1897 by Enoch Sontonga, a teacher at a Methodist mission school near Johannesburg. It consisted of a single stanza in Xhosa and was intended to be sung as a hymn. Written in B-flat major, it had a four-part harmony supporting a repetitive melody characteristic of &quot;both Western hymn composition and indigenous South African melodies.&quot; It was first publicly sung at the ordination of John Hlengani Mboweni as a pastor in 1899. Rev. Mboweni made first translation to Xitsonga in the same year. In 1927 seven additional Xhosa stanzas were added by the poet Samuel Mqhayi. The hymn was taken up by the choir of Ohlange High School, whose co-founder served as the first president of the South African Native National Congress. It was sung to close the Congress meeting in 1912, and by 1925 it had become the official closing anthem of the organisation, now known as the African National Congress. &quot; was first published in 1927. The song was the official anthem for the African National Congress during the apartheid era and was a symbol of the anti-apartheid movement. For decades during the apartheid regime it was considered by many to be the unofficial national anthem of South Africa, representing the suffering of the oppressed masses. Because of its connection to the ANC, the song was banned by the regime during the apartheid era.

==== South Africa ====
In 1994, after the end of apartheid, the new President of South Africa Nelson Mandela declared that both &quot; and the previous national anthem, &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot; () would be national anthems. While the inclusion of &quot;&quot; celebrated the newfound freedom of most South Africans, the fact that &quot;Die Stem&quot; was also retained even after the fall of apartheid, represented the desire of the new government led by Mandela to respect all races and cultures in an all-inclusive new era dawning upon South Africa. During this period, the custom was to play &quot;Die Stem&quot; together with &quot;&quot; during occasions that required the playing of a national anthem.

In 1996, a shortened, combined version of the two compositions was released as the new national anthem of South Africa under the constitution of South Africa and was adopted the following year. This version uses several of the official languages of South Africa. The first two lines of the first stanza are sung in Xhosa and the last two in Zulu. The second stanza is sung in Sesotho. The third stanza consists of a verbatim section of the former South African national anthem, &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot;, and is sung in Afrikaans. The fourth and final stanza, sung in English, is a modified version of the closing lines of &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot;.

The South African National Anthem is often incorrectly called “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika” but the correct name is “The National Anthem of South Africa”.

==== Tanzania ====
A Swahili translation of &quot;&quot; with partially modified lyrics is used as the national anthem of Tanzania under the name of &quot;Mungu ibariki Afrika&quot; since 1961.

== Melody only ==

=== Zambia ===

&quot;&quot; was the national anthem of Zambia from independence in 1964 until 1973, when the melody was retained but the lyrics replaced by &quot;Stand and Sing of Zambia, Proud and Free&quot;.

== Former ==

=== Zimbabwe ===

&quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; was the Zimbabwean version of &quot;God Bless Africa&quot; sung in the Shona and Ndebele languages and was its first national anthem, adopted upon independence in 1980. It was replaced in 1994 by &quot;Ngaikomborerwe Nyika yeZimbabwe/Kalibusiswe Ilizwe LeZimbabwe&quot; ().

=== Namibia ===

&quot;&quot; was used as the national anthem of Namibia at time of the country&#x27;s independence in March 1990, but replaced in 1991 by &quot;Namibia, Land of the Brave&quot;.

== Other countries and organisations ==

In other African countries throughout southern Africa, the song was sung by various independence and other movements. It includes versions in Chichewa (Malawi and Zambia). Outside of Africa, the hymn is perhaps best known as the long-time (since 1925) anthem of the African National Congress (ANC), as a result of the global anti-Apartheid Movement of the 1970s and 1980s, when it was regularly sung at meetings and other events.

In Finland the same melody is used as the children&#x27;s psalm &quot;&quot; (). The hymn has appeared in &quot;Virsikirja&quot;, the hymnbook of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, with lyrics by Jaakko Löytty.

== Lyrics ==

=== Historic lyrics ===

The words of the first stanza and chorus were originally written in Xhosa as a hymn. In 1927 seven additional Xhosa stanzas were added by the poet Samuel Mqhayi.

=== Meaning and symbolism ===

British musicologist Nicholas Cook states:
&quot; has a meaning that emerges from the act of performing it. Like all choral performance, from singing a hymn to chanting at a football match, it involves communal participation and interaction. Everybody has to listen to everyone else and move forward together. It doesn&#x27;t just symbolize unity, it enacts it ... Through its block-like harmonic construction and regular phrasing, &quot; creates a sense of stability and mutual dependence, with no one vocal part predominating over the others ... It lies audibly at the interface between European traditions of &#x27;common-practice&#x27; harmony and African traditions of communal singing, which gives it an inclusive quality entirely appropriate to the aspirations of the new South Africa ... Enlisting music&#x27;s ability to shape personal identity, &quot;&quot; actively contributes to the construction of the community that is the new South Africa. In this sense, singing it is a political act.

== Recordings ==

Solomon Plaatje, author and founding member of the ANC, was the first to have the song recorded in London, 1923. A Sotho version was published in 1942 by Moses Mphahlele. Rev. John Langalibalele Dube&#x27;s Ohlange Zulu Choir popularised the hymn at concerts in Johannesburg, and it became a popular church hymn that was also adopted as the anthem at political meetings.

A version by the London Symphony Orchestra under André Previn was featured in the film &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; (1987).

In Kenya, Mang&#x27;u High School uses a translation, Mungu Ibariki Mang&#x27;u High, as its school anthem.

It has also been recorded by Paul Simon and Miriam Makeba, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Boom Shaka, Osibisa, Oliver Mtukudzi (the Shona version that was once the anthem of Zimbabwe) and the Mahotella Queens. Boom Shaka, a prominent South African kwaito group, formed the anthem in kwaito style, a popular South African genre influenced by house music. The interpretation was controversial, and it was viewed by some as a commercial subversion of the anthem; Boom Shaka countered by stating that their version represents liberation and introduces the song to younger listeners.

South African Idols-winner Elvis Blue recorded an Afrikaans translation of the song with Afrikaans singer Coenie de Villiers entitled &quot;Seëngebed&quot; (&quot;Lord&#x27;s Blessing&quot;) on his third studio album &quot;Afrikaans&quot;.

British a cappella vocal ensemble The King&#x27;s Singers released a recording of the song, arranged by Neo Muyanga, on their album &quot;Finding Harmony&quot;.

<text>Gut loading is the process by which an animal&#x27;s prey is raised and fed nutritious foods with the intention of passing those nutrients to the animal for which the prey is intended. This term is used most often in reference to the preparation of insects, such as crickets and mealworms, or mice which are used as food for reptile pets. Insects that are raised commercially for the pet trade are themselves of little nutritional value. By providing the prey animals with a high quality diet prior to feeding, they become a more nutritious meal for the predator. 

Gut loading can be accomplished by providing fruits, vegetables, and cereals or a nutritionally complete manufactured diet. Several commercial products are available and are fortified specifically for gut loading. These products often include varying combinations of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber.

<text>The Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC, ) is a bunker underneath the East Wing of the White House. It serves as a secure shelter and communications center for the president of the United States and others in case of an emergency.

==History==
===World War II===
The first White House bunker was built during World War II to protect President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the event of an aerial attack on the national capital of Washington, D.C. 

The present-day PEOC space has modern communications equipment including televisions and phones to coordinate with outside government entities. During a breach of White House security, including violations of the Washington, D.C. Air Defense Identification Zone (P-56 airspace), the president and other protectees are relocated to the executive briefing room, next to the PEOC. Day to day, the PEOC is staffed around the clock by joint-service military officers and non-commissioned officers.

===September 11 attacks===

During the September 11 attacks, a number of key personnel were evacuated from their offices in the White House to the PEOC. These included Vice President Dick Cheney, First Lady Laura Bush, Lynne Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Mary Matalin, &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, Joshua Bolten, Karen Hughes, Stephen Hadley, David Addington, Secret Service agents, U.S. Army major Mike Fenzel serving on a White House Fellowship, and other staff including Norman Mineta. President George W. Bush was visiting a school in Florida at the time of the attacks. Australian Prime Minister 
John Howard was incorrectly reported as being bundled into the PEOC but was actually in a bunker at the Australian Embassy.

===May 29, 2020===
President Donald Trump retreated to the PEOC during the night of May 29, 2020, at the beginning of the George Floyd protests. 

After his time in the bunker was reported in the news, Trump demanded that officials find and prosecute those responsible for the information getting to the press. Trump&#x27;s secretary of defense, Mark Esper, described in his 2022 book that Trump stated the person who leaked his whereabouts &quot;should be tried for treason and should be executed&quot;.

<text>A flat cap is a rounded cap with a small stiff brim in front, originating in Northern England. The hat is also known in Ireland as a paddy cap; in Scotland as a bunnet; in Wales as a Dai cap; and in the United States as an English cap or Irish cap. Various other terms exist (scally cap, cabbie cap, driver cap, golf cap, longshoreman cap, ivy cap, jeff cap, train engineer cap, sixpence, etc.) Flat caps are usually made of tweed, plain wool, or cotton, while some are made using leather, linen, or corduroy. The inside of the cap is commonly lined for comfort and warmth.

==History==
The style can be traced back to the 16th century in Northern England, when it was more likely to be called a &quot;bonnet&quot;. This term was replaced by &quot;cap&quot; before about 1700, except in Scotland, where it continues to be referred to as a &quot;bunnet&quot; in Scots.

A 1571 Act of the English Parliament was enacted to stimulate domestic wool consumption and general trade. It decreed that on Sundays and holidays, all males over 6 years of age, except for the nobility and &quot;persons of degree&quot;, were to wear woolen caps or pay a fine of three farthings per day (). The Act was not repealed until 1597, though by then the flat cap had become firmly entrenched as a recognised mark of a non-noble person, such as a burgher, a tradesman, or an apprentice. The style may have been the same as the Tudor bonnet still used in some styles of academic dress.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, when men predominantly wore some form of headgear, flat caps were commonly worn throughout Great Britain and Ireland. Versions in finer cloth were also considered to be suitable casual countryside wear for upper-class Englishmen. Flat caps were worn by fashionable young men in the 1920s. Boys of all classes in the United Kingdom wore caps during this period; a peaked school cap of prescribed colour and design, of more rounded shape than men&#x27;s flat caps, was part of the normal school uniform.

The flat cap made its way to southern Italy in the late 1800s, likely brought by British servicemen. In Turkey, the flat cap became the main headgear for men after it became a replacement for the fez, which was banned by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in 1925.

In the early part of the 20th century it was worn by working class men in Spain and it became part of the traditional attire and folklore of Madrid where it is called &quot;&quot;, &quot;gorra madrileña&quot;, or &quot;Madrid Cap&quot;.

==British popular culture==
In British popular culture, the flat cap (or &quot;flat hat&quot;) is typically associated with Yorkshire, and more broadly, working-class men. The flat cap can also be taken to denote the upper class when affecting casualness. &quot;A toff can be a bit of a chap as well without, as it were, losing face.&quot; In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, British public figures including David Beckham, Nigel Mansell, Guy Ritchie, Richard Blackwood, and Charles III wore the flat cap.

In Northern England, notable wearers include: Fred Dibnah, from Bolton; comic strip anti-hero Andy Capp, from Hartlepool, and AC/DC vocalist Brian Johnson, of Newcastle, customarily wears a flat cap frequently on and off stage.

In &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;, a BBC television show about a former Birmingham-based gang, characters are seen wearing Baker Boy Caps, a similar style often confused for flat caps. It was thought, and adapted, that the gang had sewed-in razor blades on the peak of their flat caps for use as a weapon to blind their enemies.

Usage in the East End of London is illustrated by Jim Branning of the television soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; and Del Boy Trotter of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. Taxicab and bus drivers are often depicted wearing a flat cap, as comedically portrayed by Gareth Hale and Norman Pace&#x27;s (Hale and Pace) &quot;London cabbies&quot; television sketches.

==Modern popularity==

The style has remained popular among groups of people in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and North America. The cap is sometimes associated with older men, significantly in South Korea, but has been popular (along with the newsboy cap) among some segments of younger people, for example, in cities such as Chicago, Boston, New York, and Scranton with large Irish-American populations. It has appeared in the hip hop subculture, sometimes worn back-to-front or cocked to the side. It is also very common among men and women in San Francisco, California. In Turkey, it is highly popular amongst men, mostly working-class.

The English rugby league team Featherstone Rovers supporters&#x27; nickname is &quot;the Flat Cappers&quot;, because supporters in years gone by attended matches wearing them as did most other teams&#x27; supporters.

The black leather flat cap is often combined with a patched-up sport coat or leather jacket and dark clothes (sometimes combined with a bee-striped convict&#x27;s shirt) in popular culture to depict a burglar, mugger, or robber, occasionally with a domino mask. The comic book character the Goon is based on this archetype of the flat-capped street tough from vintage cartoons and comics.

American golfer Bryson DeChambeau wears a flat cap during his rounds on the PGA Tour in honor of the late Payne Stewart and Ben Hogan. The look has rejuvenated popularity with the style amongst younger golfers. 

The Canadian team in the 1998 Winter Olympics wore red flat caps designed by Roots in the opening ceremony parade of nations. The US team in the 2008 Summer Olympics also wore white flat caps designed by Polo Ralph Lauren during the parade of nations.
