<doc id="597543" wikidata="Q7250577" url="?curid=597543" title="Proselytization and counter-proselytization of Jews">
<text>A number of religious groups, particularly Christians and Muslims, are involved in the proselytization of Jews—attempts to recruit or &quot;missionize&quot; Jews.

In response, some Jewish groups have formed counter-missionary/counter-proselytization organizations to discourage missionary and messianic groups such as Jews for Jesus from using practices that they say are deceptive.

==Christian missions==

According to Rabbi Tovia Singer, counter-missionary expert and director of Outreach Judaism, there are well over 1,000 messianic congregations and other missions to the Jews worldwide.

===Catholic Church===

The Catholic Church has historically been instrumental in its attempt to convert Jews. Such examples include conversos during the Inquisition, especially within Spain. However, since the Second Vatican Council and the production of the document , the Catholic Church&#x27;s attitude towards Jewish conversion has been that of sensitivity.

Pope Benedict XVI suggested that Jews should not be targeted for conversion. In his book, Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week, he stated &quot;Israel is in the hands of God, who will save it &#x27;as a whole&#x27; at the proper time, when the number of Gentiles is full&quot;.

A document released by the Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews under Pope Francis stated &quot;In concrete terms this means that the Catholic Church neither conducts nor supports any specific institutional mission work directed towards Jews&quot;, though it also says &quot;Christians are nonetheless called to bear witness to their faith in Jesus Christ also to Jews.&quot; The document also denies that there is more than one path to salvation stating &quot;Confessing the universal and therefore also exclusive mediation of salvation through Jesus Christ belongs to the core of Christian faith.&quot;

===Protestantism===

A number of Christian denominations have programs to reach Jews. The JTA, a Jewish news service, conducted an extensive analysis of Christian efforts to convert Jews to Christianity and found that some of the largest evangelical denominations – the Southern Baptists, the Assemblies of God, and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod – have all increased their efforts to evangelize Jews in the recent past.

The article states that the Christian missionary organization Jews for Jesus completed a five-year tour called &quot;Behold Your God&quot; that brought its message to 53 cities worldwide, and the Christian Chosen People Ministries saw its income grow by 31% to $7.9million between 2003 and 2006.

Jews for Judaism, a Jewish counter-missionary group, writes that there are over 900 Christian groups in North America actively involved in missionizing the Jewish people. Jews for Judaism further states that these groups are currently spending over $250million each year on efforts to convert Jews to Christianity. Jews for Jesus, the best known single ministry to the Jews, spent over $15million in 2008. The Assemblies of God has an extensive organization targeting Jews for conversion to Christianity.

Israel has more than one hundred Messianic congregations according to Yaakov Shalom Ariel, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina and author of &quot;Evangelizing The Chosen People&quot;.

A prominent effort to convert Jews to Christianity is known as Jews for Jesus. It was founded by Martin &quot;Moishe&quot; Rosen, who is of Jewish descent and grew up in a non-observant home, converted to Christianity, and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1957. In 1973, Rosen left the employment of the American Board of Missions to the Jews, now called Chosen People Ministries, to incorporate a separate mission which became known as Jews for Jesus. In 1986, he received an honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree from Western Conservative Baptist Seminary in Portland, Oregon. Jews for Jesus is now led by David Brickner, who has been working for the organization since 1977.

The 19th century saw at least 250,000 Jews convert to Christianity according to existing records of various societies. Data from the Pew Research Center has it that, as of 2013, about 1.6million adult American Jews identify themselves as Christians; most as Protestants. According to the same data, most of the Jews who identify themselves as some sort of Christian (1.6million) were raised as Jews or are Jews by ancestry. According to a 2012 study, 17% of Jews in Russia identify themselves as Christians.

Efforts to convert Jews to Christianity are sometimes regarded as antisemitic. Most Progressive Christian and Mainline Christian denominations have publicly declared that they no longer proselytize Jews. Most evangelical and conservative Christian churches have said they will continue their efforts to evangelize among Jews and claim that proselytism is not antisemitic.

==Muslim missions==
Muslims have also targeted Jews for conversion. Rabbi Moshe Cohen, of , an Israel-based counter-missionary organization, has identified Al Dawaa, an Israel-based Muslim group headed by Sheikh Abu Yassin of Kafr Manda.

==Jewish response==

Jewish counter-missionary organizations respond to these efforts by offering personal counseling, web sites with articles addressing common missionary tactics, and discussion forums where Jews who have questions about the differences between Judaism and other religions can be answered by observant Jews.

Some Jewish resources are specifically aimed at countering the missionary efforts aimed at Jews.

* Jews for Judaism is an international organization that provides a wide variety of counseling services, along with education, and outreach programs that enable Jews of all ages to rediscover and strengthen their Jewish heritage. Jews for Judaism has offices in Baltimore, Toronto, Los Angeles, Australia and South Africa. On their website, Jews for Judaism offers many articles discussing missionary tactics towards Jews, approaches by Mormons, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and various &quot;proof texts&quot; and other arguments often used by missionaries as they evangelize Jews.
* Outreach Judaism, a site run by Rabbi Tovia Singer. Outreach Judaism is an international organization that responds directly to the issues raised by missionaries and cults, by exploring Judaism in contradistinction to fundamentalist Christianity. Outreach Judaism provides full-time, multi-level informational resources.
* Beyneynu () was founded by former Evangelical missionary Shannon Nuszen. Beyneynu is a non-profit organization that monitors missionary activity in Israel and abroad. Based in Israel, Beyneynu works with government and community leaders to raise awareness of Jewish evangelism, its danger to the Jewish people, and encourage safe and consistent boundaries in the interfaith relationships of Jewish communities worldwide.
* Kiruv Organization (Mizrachi) – an outreach organization founded in 1995 by Rabbi Yosef Mizrachi in New York for the purpose of teaching Torah to both secular and religious Jews.

Rabbi Moshe Shulman has responded to specific missionaries who target Jews, including Michael Brown, Rachmiel Frydland, Risto Santala, and David H. Stern (author of the Complete Jewish Bible). Rabbi Shulman&#x27;s website offers scholarly articles on the misuse of the Targums, Midrash and Talmud by non-Jews who quote from Jewish sources in an attempt to convert Jews.

The leading counter-missionary organization in Israel is , an organization focusing on Orthodox Judaism outreach and counter-missionary activity. is made up of both paid staff and volunteers, and is largely supported by donations both from Israel and the diaspora.

<text>A jagir (), (Hindustani: जागीर/جاگیردار, J&quot;āgīr&quot;), (Marathi: जहागीर, &quot;Jahāgīrá&quot;) also spelled as jageer, was a type of feudal land grant in the Indian subcontinent at the foundation of its Jagirdar (Zamindar) system. It developed during the Islamic era of the Indian subcontinent, starting in the early 13th century, wherein the powers to govern and collect tax from an estate was granted to an appointee of the state. The tenants were considered to be in the servitude of the jagirdar. There were two forms of jagir, one conditional, the other unconditional. The conditional jagir required the governing family to maintain troops and provide their service to the state when asked. The land grant, called , was usually for a holder&#x27;s lifetime; the land reverted to the state upon the death of the jagirdar.

The jagirdar system was introduced by the Delhi Sultanate, and continued during the Mughal Empire, but with a difference. In the Mughal times, the jagirdar collected taxes which paid his salary and the rest to the Mughal treasury, while the administration and military authority was given to a separate Mughal appointee. After the collapse and takeover of Mughals, the system of jagirs was retained by Marathas, Charans, Rajput, Rajpurohit, Jat, and Sikh jat kingdoms, and later in a form by the British East India Company.

== Definition ==
&quot;Jagir&quot; (, Hindustani: जागीर/جاگیردار, Marathi: जहागीर, ) is a Persian word meaning &#x27;place holder&#x27;.

In its 1955 of the case &quot;Thakur Amar Singhji v. State Of Rajasthan&quot;, the Supreme Court of India used the following definition of &quot;jagir&quot; in interpreting the &quot;Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of Jagirs Act (Rajasthan Act VI of 1952)&quot;:
== Succession ==
A jagir was technically a feudal life estate, as the grant reverted to the state upon the jagirdar&#x27;s death. However, in practice, jagirs became hereditary to the male lineal heir of the jagirdar. The family was thus the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the territory, earned income from part of the tax revenues and delivered the rest to the treasury of the state during the Islamic rule period, and later in parts of India that came under Afghan, Sikh and Rajput rulers. The &quot;jagirdar&quot; did not act alone but appointed administrative layers for revenue collection. These positions, according to Shakti Kak, were called, among other titles, &quot;patwari&quot;, &quot;tahsildar&quot;, &quot;amil&quot;, &quot;fotedar&quot;, &quot;munsif&quot;, &quot;qanungo&quot;, &quot;chaudhri&quot;, and &quot;dewan&quot;.

== 13th-century origin and successors ==
This feudal system of land ownership is referred to as the &quot;jagirdar&quot; system. The system was introduced by the Sultans of Delhi from the 13th century onwards, was later adopted by the Mughal Empire, the Maratha Empire and continued under the British East India Company.
Some Hindu jagirdars were converted into Muslim vassal states under Mughal imperial sway, such as the nawabs of Kurnool. Most princely states of India during the colonial British Raj era were jagirdars such as Mohrampur Jagir. Shortly following independence from the British Crown in 1947, the &quot;jagirdar&quot; system was abolished by the Indian government in 1951.

<doc id="597564" wikidata="Q1224386" url="?curid=597564" title="Just-noticeable difference">
<text>In the branch of experimental psychology focused on sense, sensation, and perception, which is called psychophysics, a just-noticeable difference or JND is the amount something must be changed in order for a difference to be noticeable, detectable at least half the time. This limen is also known as the difference limen, difference threshold, or least perceptible difference.

== Quantification ==
For many sensory modalities, over a wide range of stimulus magnitudes sufficiently far from the upper and lower limits of perception, the &#x27;JND&#x27; is a fixed proportion of the reference sensory level, and so the ratio of the JND/reference is roughly constant (that is the JND is a constant proportion/percentage of the reference level). Measured in physical units, we have:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the original intensity of the particular stimulation, formula_3 is the addition to it required for the change to be perceived (the JND), and &quot;k&quot; is a constant. This rule was first discovered by Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795–1878), an anatomist and physiologist, in experiments on the thresholds of perception of lifted weights. A theoretical rationale (not universally accepted) was subsequently provided by Gustav Fechner, so the rule is therefore known either as the Weber Law or as the Weber–Fechner law; the constant &quot;k&quot; is called the Weber constant. It is true, at least to a good approximation, of many but not all sensory dimensions, for example the brightness of lights, and the intensity and the pitch of sounds. It is not true, however, for the wavelength of light. Stanley Smith Stevens argued that it would hold only for what he called &quot;prothetic&quot; sensory continua, where change of input takes the form of increase in intensity or something obviously analogous; it would not hold for &quot;metathetic&quot; continua, where change of input produces a qualitative rather than a quantitative change of the percept. Stevens developed his own law, called Stevens&#x27; Power Law, that raises the stimulus to a constant power while, like Weber, also multiplying it by a constant factor in order to achieve the perceived stimulus.

The JND is a statistical, rather than an exact quantity: from trial to trial, the difference that a given person notices will vary somewhat, and it is therefore necessary to conduct many trials in order to determine the threshold. The JND usually reported is the difference that a person notices on 50% of trials. If a different proportion is used, this should be included in the description—for example one might report the value of the &quot;75% JND&quot;.

Modern approaches to psychophysics, for example signal detection theory, imply that the observed JND, even in this statistical sense, is not an absolute quantity, but will depend on situational and motivational as well as perceptual factors. For example, when a researcher flashes a very dim light, a participant may report seeing it on some trials but not on others.

The JND formula has an objective interpretation (implied at the start of this entry) as the disparity between levels of the presented stimulus that is detected on 50% of occasions by a particular observed response, rather than what is subjectively &quot;noticed&quot; or as a difference in magnitudes of consciously experienced &#x27;sensations&#x27;. This 50%-discriminated disparity can be used as a universal unit of measurement of the psychological distance of the level of a feature in an object or situation and an internal standard of comparison in memory, such as the &#x27;template&#x27; for a category or the &#x27;norm&#x27; of recognition. The JND-scaled distances from norm can be combined among observed and inferred psychophysical functions to generate diagnostics among hypothesised information-transforming (mental) processes mediating observed quantitative judgments.

==Music production applications==
In music production, a single change in a property of sound which is below the JND does not affect perception of the sound. For amplitude, the JND for humans is around 1 dB.

The JND for tone is dependent on the tone&#x27;s frequency content. Below 500 Hz, the JND is about 3 Hz for sine waves; above 1000 Hz, the JND for sine waves is about 0.6% (about 10 cents).

The JND is typically tested by playing two tones in quick succession with the listener asked if there was a difference in their pitches. The JND becomes smaller if the two tones are played simultaneously as the listener is then able to discern beat frequencies. The total number of perceptible pitch steps in the range of human hearing is about 1,400; the total number of notes in the equal-tempered scale, from 16 to 16,000 Hz, is 120.

== In speech perception ==
JND analysis is frequently occurring in both music and speech, the two being related and overlapping in the analysis of speech prosody (i.e. speech melody). Although JND varies as a function of the frequency band being tested, it has been shown that JND for the best performers at around 1 kHz is well below 1 Hz, (i.e. less than a tenth of a percent). It is, however, important to be aware of the role played by critical bandwidth when performing this kind of analysis.

When analysing speech melody, rather than musical tones, accuracy decreases. This is not surprising given that speech does not stay at fixed intervals in the way that tones in music do. Johan &#x27;t Hart (1981) found that JND for speech averaged between 1 and 2 STs but concluded that &quot;only differences of more than 3 semitones play a part in communicative situations&quot;.

Note that, given the logarithmic characteristics of Hz, for both music and speech perception results should not be reported in Hz but either as percentages or in STs (5 Hz between 20 and 25 Hz is very different from 5 Hz between 2000 and 2005 Hz, but an ~18.9% or 3 semitone increase is perceptually the same size difference, regardless of whether one starts at 20Hz or at 2000Hz).

==Marketing applications==

Weber&#x27;s law has important applications in marketing. Manufacturers and marketers endeavor to determine the relevant JND for their products for two very different reasons:

# so that negative changes (e.g. reductions in product size or quality, or increase in product price) are not discernible to the public (i.e. remain below JND) and
# so that product improvements (e.g. improved or updated packaging, larger size or lower price) are very apparent to consumers without being wastefully extravagant (i.e. they are at or just above the JND).

When it comes to product improvements, marketers very much want to meet or exceed the consumer&#x27;s differential threshold; that is, they want consumers to readily perceive any improvements made in the original products. Marketers use the JND to determine the amount of improvement they should make in their products. Less than the JND is wasted effort because the improvement will not be perceived; more than the JND is again wasteful because it reduces the level of repeat sales. On the other hand, when it comes to price increases, less than the JND is desirable because consumers are unlikely to notice it.

==Haptics applications==
Weber&#x27;s law is used in haptic devices and robotic applications. Exerting the proper amount of force to human operator is a critical aspects in human robot interactions and tele operation scenarios. It can highly improve the performance of the user in accomplishing a task.

<text>A PQ tree is a tree-based data structure that represents a family of permutations on a set of elements, discovered and named by Kellogg S. Booth and George S. Lueker in 1976. It is a rooted, labeled tree, in which each element is represented by one of the leaf nodes, and each non-leaf node is labelled P or Q. A P node has at least two children, and a Q node has at least three children.

A PQ tree represents its permutations via permissible reorderings of the children of its nodes. The children of a P node may be reordered in any way. The children of a Q node may be put in reverse order, but may not otherwise be reordered. A PQ tree represents all leaf node orderings that can be achieved by any sequence of these two operations. A PQ tree with many P and Q nodes can represent complicated subsets of the set of all possible orderings. However, not every set of orderings may be representable in this way; for instance, if an ordering is represented by a PQ tree, the reverse of the ordering must also be represented by the same tree.

PQ trees are used to solve problems where the goal is to find an ordering that satisfies various constraints. In these problems, constraints on the ordering are included one at a time, by modifying the PQ tree structure in such a way that it represents only orderings satisfying the constraint. Applications of PQ trees include creating a contig map from DNA fragments, testing a matrix for the consecutive ones property, recognizing interval graphs, and determining whether a graph is planar.

==Examples and notation==
If all the leaves of a PQ tree are connected directly to a root P node then all possible orderings are allowed. If all the leaves are connected directly to a root Q node then only one order and its reverse are allowed. If nodes a,b,c connect to a P node, which connects to a root P node, with all other leaf nodes connected directly to the root, then any ordering where a,b,c are contiguous is allowed.

Where graphical presentation is unavailable PQ trees are often noted using nested parenthesized lists. Each matched pair of square parentheses represents a Q node and each matched pair of rounded parentheses represent a P node. Leaves are non-parentheses elements of the lists. The image on the left is represented in this notation by [1 (2 3 4) 5]. This PQ tree represents the following twelve permutations on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}:
: 12345, 12435, 13245, 13425, 14235, 14325, 52341, 52431, 53241, 53421, 54231, 54321.

==PC trees==

The PC tree, developed by Wei-Kuan Shih and Wen-Lian Hsu, is a more recent generalization of the PQ tree. Like the PQ tree, it represents permutations by reorderings of nodes in a tree, with elements represented at the leaves of the tree. Unlike the PQ tree, the PC tree is unrooted. The nodes adjacent to any non-leaf node labeled P may be reordered arbitrarily as in the PQ tree, while the nodes adjacent to any non-leaf node labeled C have a fixed cyclic order and may only be reordered by reversing this order. Thus, a PC tree can only represent sets of orderings in which any circular permutation or reversal of an ordering in the set is also in the set. However, a PQ tree on &quot;n&quot; elements may be simulated by a PC tree on &quot;n&quot; + 1 elements, where the extra element serves to root the PC tree. The data structure operations required to perform a planarity testing algorithm on PC trees are somewhat simpler than the corresponding operations on PQ trees.

<text>James Lopez Watson (May 21, 1922 – September 1, 2001) was an American lawyer who served as a federal judge of the United States Court of International Trade. While serving as a judge around the country, Watson became the first African-American to head a federal court in the American Deep South.

==Education and career==

Born on May 21, 1922, in Harlem, New York City, New York, the son of James S. Watson and Violet Watson, James L. Watson served in the United States Army from 1943 to 1945, where he fought in Italy and received the Purple Heart. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1947 from New York University and a Bachelor of Laws in 1951 from Brooklyn Law School. He was engaged in private practice from 1951 to 1953. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1954 to 1963. He was a Judge of the New York City Civil Court from 1963 to 1966.

===New York State Senate service===

Watson was a member of the New York State Senate (21st D.) from 1955 to 1963, sitting in the 170th, 171st, 172nd, 173rd, and 174th New York State Legislatures.

==Federal judicial service==

Watson was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on January 19, 1966, to a seat on the United States Customs Court vacated by Judge Jed Johnson. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 4, 1966, and received his commission on March 7, 1966. He was reassigned by operation of law to the United States Court of International Trade on November 1, 1980, to a new seat authorized by 94 Stat. 1727. Because judges of that court are periodically assigned to federal courts around the country, Watson became the first African-American judge to head a federal court in the American Deep South. He assumed senior status on February 28, 1991. His service terminated on September 1, 2001, due to his death of cancer in Harlem.

==Honor==

In 2003, the courthouse at 1 Federal Plaza in Manhattan was renamed the James L. Watson United States Court of International Trade Building in Watson&#x27;s honor.

<doc id="597576" wikidata="Q162997" url="?curid=597576" title="The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)">
<text>The Thin Blue Line is a 1988 American documentary film by Errol Morris, about the trial and conviction of Randall Dale Adams for the 1976 shooting of Dallas police officer Robert W. Wood. Morris became interested in the case while doing research for a film about Dr. James Grigson, a psychiatrist known in Texas as &quot;Dr. Death&quot; for testifying with &quot;100 percent certainty&quot; of a defendant&#x27;s recidivism in many trials, including that of Randall Adams. The film centers around the &quot;inconsistencies, incongruities and loose ends&quot; of the case, and Morris, through his investigation, not only comes to a different conclusion, but actually obtains an admission of Adams&#x27;s innocence from the original suspect of the case, David Harris. The &quot;thin blue line&quot; in the title &quot;refers to what Mr. Morris feels is an ironic, mythical image of a protective policeman on the other side of anarchy&quot;.

The film won many awards, but was a controversial film among documentary film critics, who felt the use of reenactment had no place in the documentary format. For this reason, the film was not nominated for an Academy Award, though it won several other awards for best documentary. Roger Ebert &quot;attributed its rejection to the inability of academy voters to appreciate innovative film making.&quot;

In 2001, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Background ==
Prior to the conception of &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;, Morris originally planned to film a documentary about prosecution psychiatrist Dr. James Grigson, known as Doctor Death, who testified in more than 100 trials that resulted in death sentences. As an expert psychiatrist, Dr. Grigson made a name for himself by giving testimony in capital cases for the prosecution. Under the law in Texas, the death penalty can only be issued if the jury is convinced that the defendant is not just guilty, but will commit violent crimes in the future if not put to death. In almost every instance, Dr. Grigson would, after examining a defendant, testify that he had found the individual in question to be an incurable sociopath, who he was &quot;one hundred percent certain&quot; would kill again.

In pursuit of creating this idea, Morris sought and received funding for the initial project from the Public Broadcasting Service. Morris also received funding from Endowment of Public Arts. Using this grant, Morris was able to initially interview Grigson. During this meeting, Grigson suggested to Morris that his research should begin with all the inmates he had testified against in court. It was during this preliminary research that Morris met Randall Dale Adams, and learned of his case. Grigson had told the jury that Adams would be an ongoing menace if kept alive, but Morris, after meeting Adams, became skeptical that he committed the crime. Dr. Grigson&#x27;s interviews often lasted less than an hour and were arbitrary at best, often asking inmates to copy doodles.

Morris later chose to refocus his research efforts into an investigation on the circumstances of Randall Dale Adams&#x27;s conviction. Grigson does not appear in the final cut of the film.

==Synopsis==
The film presents a series of interviews about the investigation of the shooting of Dallas police officer Robert Wood and a re-enactment of the crime based on the testimony and recollections of Adams, Harris (the actual murderer), the judge presiding over the case (Donald J. Metcalfe), and several witnesses (including Emily Miller and R. L. Miller), as well as detectives (including Gus Rose, Jackie Johnson, and Marshall Touchton). Two attorneys (Edith James and Dennis White) who represented Adams at the trial where he was convicted also appear; they suggest that Adams was charged with the crime despite the evidence against Harris because Harris was a juvenile at the time, whereas Adams, as an adult, could be sentenced to death under Texas law. The prosecutor (Douglas D. Mulder) does not appear in the film.

The film&#x27;s title comes from prosecutor Doug Mulder&#x27;s phrase during his closing argument that the police are the &quot;thin blue line&quot; separating society from &quot;anarchy&quot;. This is a re-working of a line from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;Tommy&quot; in which he describes British soldiers (nicknamed &quot;Tommy Atkins&quot;) as the &quot;thin red line&quot;, from the color of their uniforms and their formation.

== Style ==
The film makes use of dramatic re-enactments, a composed score, and interview testimony that takes the place of a narrator.

Morris is often credited with re-purposing &quot;film noir&quot; aesthetic to the documentary format. Film scholar Charles Musser has credited Morris for using &#x27;fiction film&#x27; techniques in &quot;The Thin Blue Line.&quot; Morris himself has claimed all of his films are brazenly &quot;anti-vérité&quot; in style. Morris presented the characters like in fiction films, not typical documentaries. He chose not to include official labels for the interviewees, allowing viewers to determine who is who throughout the film. He includes documents, but presents them artistically, ignoring authenticity signs. Philip Glass&#x27;s musical score is played under interviewees&#x27; statements, which was unconventional in documentaries, but Morris used it as &quot;movie music&quot; to create a film-like experience&quot;.&quot; Morris has often associated &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; with film noir, further emphasizing its connection to the conventions of fiction filmmaking.

The film&#x27;s re-enactment scenes were built carefully from witnesses&#x27; statements. Morris is commonly credited with the invention of re-enactment scenes in documentary format, though this is untrue. Although the film recreates several versions of the shooting, it does not recreate one in which David Harris shoots the officer, the interpretation which it argues is true.

== Production ==
Prior to working on this film, Morris worked for several years as a private detective investigating fraudulent transactions on the stock market in New York City. Once fascinated by the Adams/Harris case, he applied those skills to his research on the film.

Harris was later tried, convicted, and executed for committing the unrelated murder of Mark Walker Mays on September 1, 1985. On the weekend of that murder, Morris had an interview scheduled with Harris. Morris remarked in an interview with James Hughes: &quot;I often say it&#x27;s my favorite excuse for missing an appointment: &#x27;I&#x27;m sorry, I was off killing someone.&#x27;&quot;

Morris&#x27;s interview style (that of the subject staring directly into the camera) led to a later invention that his wife termed &quot;the Interrotron&quot;. It was first used in &quot;Fast, Cheap &amp; Out of Control&quot; (1997), and places Morris behind a curtain staring into one camera, which feeds into a teleprompter-like device on the camera in front of the interviewee, which causes the interviewee to look at and talk to the image of Morris, and, therefore, the camera directly, rather than to a person sitting off to one side.

The final scene, in which Morris and Harris are only heard, while shots of a tape recorder appear from various angles, was not originally planned. Morris&#x27;s camera broke down on the day of the interview, forcing Morris to use a tape recorder to document the dialogue.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, National Endowment for the Arts, Program Development Company Productions Inc., public television stations, and The Chubb Group of Insurance Companies funded the documentary.

== Soundtrack ==
The film was scored by composer Philip Glass. The original film soundtrack was published by Dunvagen Music Publishers, Inc. The music for the original film was produced by Kurt Munkasci, and the performing orchestra conducted by Michael Riesman.

Morris has claimed that prior to Glass&#x27;s involvement in the project, he personally edited &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; to a mix-tape of Glass&#x27;s earlier works, including selections from &quot;Mishima&quot; and &quot;In the Upper Room and Glassworks.&quot; In an interview with Marc Glassman of &quot;POV magazine&quot;, Morris explained his rationale for seeking Glass to compose the score:I had the good fortune of actually convincing him [Philip Glass] to write the soundtrack himself. Someone asked me, &#x27;Why Philip Glass?&#x27; And I said, &#x27;because he does existential dread better than anybody. He&#x27;s the master of existential dread.&#x27;

== Release ==
=== Marketing ===
Marketing the film was not an easy task, as Morris wished to avoid having the label of documentary attached to his film. Miramax, the film&#x27;s distributor, had originally picked it up for its unconventional look, and used marketing hooks to make the film &quot;transition from the arthouse to the multiplex&quot;. Harvey Weinstein, the former head of Miramax, declared: &quot;Never has Miramax had a movie where a man&#x27;s life hangs in the balance&quot;. The poster for the film gave it the feel of a whodunit, with the tagline: &quot;A softcore movie, Dr. Death, a chocolate milkshake, a nosy blonde and &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. Solving this mystery is going to be murder.&quot;

Weinstein even sent a note to Errol Morris pushing him to promote the film better during interviews. The note read, in part, &quot;Heard your NPR interview and you were boring,&quot; and recommended the director sell the movie as a highly thrilling and emotional experience similar to watching thrillers or horror movies and that he adopt the usage of shorter and clearer sentences.

===Box office===
&quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; grossed $1,209,846 in the US and Canada. On its opening weekend, in only one theatre, it took in $17,814. Although the film is the 95th highest grossing documentary film released since 1982, Morris says he lost money on the production.

===Home media===
&quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; made its DVD premiere in July 2005 from MGM. In Australia, the film was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in June 2007. The DVD includes Umbrella Entertainment trailers as special features. A special edition Blu-ray of the film was released in North America by the Criterion Collection in March 2015. New features include interviews with Morris and filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer.

== Reception ==

===Critical response===
&quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; holds a 100% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews. It has an average score of 79 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Gene Siskel, writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, named it the 7th best film of 1988. Kim Newman from &quot;Empire&quot; called the film &quot;riveting and terrifying. Highly recommended testimony to the dangers of shoddy investigations.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, and wrote that &quot;Morris&#x27; visual style in The Thin Blue Line is unlike any conventional documentary approach. Although his interviews are shot straight on, head and shoulders, there is a way his camera has of framing his subjects so that we look at them very carefully, learning as much by what we see as by what we hear.&quot; Desson Thomson gave the film a perfect score, saying the film was &quot;more like a waking nightmare than a docudrama. A true story of murder and justice evidently miscarried, wrapped in the fictional haze of a surrealistic whodunit, it will leave you in a trance for days.&quot;

&quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; was placed on more critics&#x27; top ten lists than any other film of 1988, edging out &quot;Bull Durham&quot; by one vote.

===Awards===
The film won several awards. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences refused to consider it for Best Documentary because of its use of reenactments. 

Since the film was marketed as &quot;nonfiction&quot; rather than as a documentary, it was disqualified from being considered in the documentary category for an Academy Award.

===Legacy===
In a 2008 retrospective of documentaries, &quot;Variety&quot; credited the film as &quot;the most political work of cinema in the last 20 years&quot;. The film has had a considerable influence on later television and documentary film, often credited with pioneering the style of modern crime-scene reenactments. In 2001, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Current TV placed the film 2nd on their list of 50 Documentaries to See Before You Die in 2011. In a 2014 &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; poll, film critics voted &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; the fifth best documentary film of all time.

The film was parodied in Season 1 of &quot;Documentary Now!&quot; as &quot;The Eye Doesn&#x27;t Lie&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Morris&#x27;s investigation suggested that five witnesses committed perjury. As a result of publicity around the film, Adams (whose death sentence had been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1980 and subsequently commuted to life in prison by the Governor of Texas, Bill Clements) had his conviction overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and the case was returned to Dallas County for a retrial. The district attorney&#x27;s office declined to prosecute the case again, and Adams was subsequently ordered released as a result of a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; hearing in 1989.

After Adams&#x27;s release from prison, he ended up in a legal battle with Morris concerning the rights to his story. The matter was settled out of court after Adams was granted sole use of anything written or made on the subject of his life. Adams himself said of the matter: &quot;Mr. Morris felt he had the exclusive rights to my life story. I did not sue Errol Morris for any money or any percentages of &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;, though the media portrayed it that way.&quot;

Morris, for his part, recalled: &quot;When [Adams] got out, he became very angry at the fact that he had signed a release giving me rights to his life story. And he felt as though I had stolen something from him. Maybe I had, maybe I just don&#x27;t understand what it&#x27;s like to be in prison for that long, for a crime you hadn&#x27;t committed. In a certain sense, the whole crazy deal with the release was fueled by my relationship with his attorney. And it&#x27;s a long, complicated story, but I guess when people are involved, there&#x27;s always a mess somewhere.&quot;

Despite being wrongly imprisoned for twelve years, Adams received no payment from the state of Texas. Had Adams been found to be wrongly convicted under today&#x27;s law in Texas, he would get $80,000 for each year of incarceration. However, since Adams was released because his case was dismissed, and not because he was pardoned, he received no payment from the state after his release for his wrongful conviction. Adams later worked as an anti-death penalty activist. He died of brain cancer in October 2010 at the age of 61, but lived in such anonymity that his death was not discovered by the media until June 2011.

==Postmodernism==
Some scholars believe that by calling the certainty of events surrounding the murder case into question, Morris positions the film as a postmodern text. Referring to theorist Fredric Jameson&#x27;s framework, film critic Linda Williams writes that documentaries that seek only to reveal the past support the notion of an &quot;intensified nostalgia for a past that is already lost&quot;. Conversely, &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; suggests Adams&#x27;s innocence by clouding a previously established history.

&quot;Stanford Law Review&quot; author Richard Sherwin believes &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; actually presents two plots. He says Morris presents one plot through the construction and ordering of the non-linear story, revealing an easy-to-follow narrative implicating Harris instead of Adams, not unlike the story that implicated Adams in the first place, because it presents an easy-to-believe retelling of history. The other plot, Sherwin says, is an example of &quot;postmodern skepticism&quot;. Within this notion Sherwin notes sociologist Jean Baudrillard&#x27;s interpretation of the postmodern media landscape as &quot;flattening&quot; meaning as well as the impossibility of the existence of &quot;truth, authority, and history&quot;.

Sherwin criticizes &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; for failing to resolve what he calls an &quot;acausal&quot; plot, referring to certain details about the case that were presented but remain unanswered, such as where Adams actually was the night of the crime (Adams himself answers this question by stating that he was watching TV in his motel room and fell asleep, but this is left without conclusive explanation, with Adams&#x27;s brother, who was in the motel room at the time, not appearing in the movie to corroborate the explanation). Instead, the end of the film abandons the &quot;acausal&quot; plot by returning to the easy-to-believe narrative, that which paints Harris as the perpetrator. Sherwin argues that for the film to succeed as an affirmative postmodern work, it must contextualize the past events within a present narrative. He argues that it should take on the challenge, through the clouding of history, of resisting the lure of a narrative and fulfilling &quot;their sworn duty to convict only in the absence of reasonable doubt.&quot;

In an interview at the Museum of Modern Art, Morris denied being postmodern in any way, and quipped: &quot;I am no post-modernist. I live in Cambridge, Massachusetts. And one of the nice things about Cambridge, Massachusetts is that &#x27;Baudrillard&#x27; isn&#x27;t in the phone book.

To me, there&#x27;s a physical world out there, pure and simple. There&#x27;s a world where things actually happen. In &quot;The Thin Blue Line,&quot; it was of all-consuming importance to figure out who was driving that car; who pulled the gun out from underneath the seat, who shot the cop. Questions like these are not up for grabs.&quot; In a video interview for the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, Morris reiterates his view of an inherent value in truth, acknowledging that our view of history will always be flawed, but that truth should still be sought.

<doc id="597577" wikidata="Q1816205" url="?curid=597577" title="The Thin Blue Line (British TV series)">
<text>The Thin Blue Line is a British sitcom which aired on BBC1 from 1995 to 1996. It was created and written by Ben Elton, and starred Rowan Atkinson. It was ranked number 34 in a poll for Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom. In September 2021, the series became available on BBC iPlayer.

The series is set in a police station in the fictional English town of Gasforth. The show sees the uniformed squad, led by Inspector Raymond Fowler (Atkinson), and the CID, led by Detective Inspector Derek Grim (David Haig), locking horns over similar, or even the same, issues while having conflicting views or methods of operations. Generally, the uniformed section triumphs over the detectives, although not without their own foibles. Although other PCs and staff other than the main characters are visible in the background, they generally have no speaking parts.

==Cast and characters==
* Rowan Atkinson as Inspector Raymond Fowler, an old-fashioned policeman whose lack of interest in sex annoys his live-in girlfriend of ten years, Sergeant Dawkins. He has a son, Bill, from a previous marriage.
* Serena Evans as Sergeant Patricia Dawkins, a desk sergeant. She is Inspector Fowler&#x27;s long-suffering partner and is forever on a quest for more sexual attention from him, who is usually reluctant to oblige. Despite her frustration and anger, she loves Fowler devotedly and dreams of marrying him and having a child.
* David Haig as Detective Inspector Derek Grim, the head of the CID unit at Gasforth Police Station. In reference to a common trope in police dramas and procedurals, his attitude is that CID are superior to the uniformed police. He has been married for twenty years to Tina, with whom he has an intense love-hate relationship. Their son, Darren, was arrested in one episode. In series one, Grim&#x27;s relationship with Fowler is almost entirely antagonistic, but in series two, he does sometimes confide in Fowler about his frustrations with Tina.
* James Dreyfus as Constable Kevin Goody, who is perhaps the least complex of the officers. Profoundly unintelligent and oblivious to the obvious, he has very little idea of what being a police officer entails. Although his character is very camp, he is infatuated with Constable Habib.
* Mina Anwar as Constable Maggie Habib, a female officer of South Asian descent, who was raised in Accrington. Habib is generally the straight man in Fowler&#x27;s uniformed branch, and usually the most effective officer in the team despite fighting off Kevin’s advances.
* Rudolph Walker as Constable Frank Gladstone, a Trinidad-origin constable near retirement. Gladstone has been a PC all his adult life, as was his father, and is enjoying his career winding down. He has something of an obsession with Gloria Hunniford.
* Kevin Allen as Detective Constable Robert Kray (series 1), an officer in Grim&#x27;s CID unit. He is a very laddish cop, intelligent, cynical and pragmatic.
* Mark Addy as Detective Constable Gary Boyle (series 2), Kray&#x27;s replacement in the second series. Like Kray, he is intelligent, cynical, pragmatic, very laddish and likes being a police officer for the associated perks.

Many notable actors made guest appearances, and these include the writer Ben Elton, Stephen Fry, Stephen Moore, Melvyn Hayes, Trevor Peacock, Owen Teale, Colin McFarlane, Alan Cox, Alexander Armstrong, Nicola Stapleton, Perry Fenwick, Walter Sparrow, Geoffrey Chater, Lucy Robinson, Gabrielle Blunt and Rupert Vansittart.

==Episodes==
===Series 1 (1995)===
Episodes were broadcast at 20:30 on Mondays on BBC1. 
===Series 2 (1996)===
Episodes were broadcast between 21:30-21:40 on Thursdays on BBC1 apart from the final episode which aired on a Monday. 
==Development==
Creator and writer Ben Elton is a fan of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, and many of the characters were influenced by the show. Fowler&#x27;s relationship with Grim is very similar to that of Captain Mainwaring to Warden Hodges, in that they are both on the same side yet enemies. Also, Constable Goody is rather like Private Pike in being a &quot;stupid boy&quot; who often irritates Fowler. Constable Gladstone&#x27;s habit of interrupting a briefing with a story about life in Trinidad is similar to Lance Corporal Jones&#x27;s penchant for reminiscing about Sudan during Captain Mainwaring&#x27;s speeches. Other references include in the episode &quot;Rag Week&quot;, when Fowler is briefly seen walking out of a shop called &quot;Mainwaring&#x27;s&quot;. Elton has appeared in the programme himself, as a homeless man in the Christmas special episode &quot;Yuletide Spirit&quot;. In the first series, the wanted poster behind Fowler&#x27;s desk in the briefing room is an E-FIT of Elton.

==Home releases==
Both series have been released on DVD in the United Kingdom (Region 2) by Vision Video Ltd. &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; is available in Region 1 (North America), having been released by BBC Warner. Episodes in the first series were not in broadcast order on both Region 1 and 2 DVDs. The Series 2 episodes in the Region 1 DVD are cut to fit about 30-minute runtime. The Region 1 release has English closed captions. The UK Region 2 does not have any subtitles. It was also released on DVD in Region 4 by Umbrella Entertainment.

<text>In computer science, tree traversal (also known as tree search and walking the tree) is a form of graph traversal and refers to the process of visiting (e.g. retrieving, updating, or deleting) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited. The following algorithms are described for a binary tree, but they may be generalized to other trees as well.

==Types==
Unlike linked lists, one-dimensional arrays and other linear data structures, which are canonically traversed in linear order, trees may be traversed in multiple ways. They may be traversed in depth-first or breadth-first order. There are three common ways to traverse them in depth-first order: in-order, pre-order and post-order. Beyond these basic traversals, various more complex or hybrid schemes are possible, such as depth-limited searches like iterative deepening depth-first search. The latter, as well as breadth-first search, can also be used to traverse infinite trees, see below.

===Data structures for tree traversal===
Traversing a tree involves iterating over all nodes in some manner. Because from a given node there is more than one possible next node (it is not a linear data structure), then, assuming sequential computation (not parallel), some nodes must be deferred—stored in some way for later visiting. This is often done via a stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO). As a tree is a self-referential (recursively defined) data structure, traversal can be defined by recursion or, more subtly, corecursion, in a natural and clear fashion; in these cases the deferred nodes are stored implicitly in the call stack.

Depth-first search is easily implemented via a stack, including recursively (via the call stack), while breadth-first search is easily implemented via a queue, including corecursively.

===Depth-first search===
In &quot;depth-first search&quot; (DFS), the search tree is deepened as much as possible before going to the next sibling.

To traverse binary trees with depth-first search, perform the following operations at each node:
# If the current node is empty then return.
# Execute the following three operations in a certain order:
#: N: Visit the current node.
#: L: Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s left subtree.
#: R: Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s right subtree.

The trace of a traversal is called a sequentialisation of the tree. The traversal trace is a list of each visited node. No one sequentialisation according to pre-, in- or post-order describes the underlying tree uniquely. Given a tree with distinct elements, either pre-order or post-order paired with in-order is sufficient to describe the tree uniquely. However, pre-order with post-order leaves some ambiguity in the tree structure.

There are three methods at which position of the traversal relative to the node (in the figure: red, green, or blue) the visit of the node shall take place. The choice of exactly one color determines exactly one visit of a node as described below. Visit at all three colors results in a threefold visit of the same node yielding the “all-order” sequentialisation:

====Pre-order, NLR====
# Visit the current node (in the figure: position red).
# Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s left subtree.
# Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s right subtree.

The pre-order traversal is a topologically sorted one, because a parent node is processed before any of its child nodes is done.

====Post-order, LRN====
# Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s left subtree.
# Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s right subtree.
# Visit the current node (in the figure: position blue).

Post-order traversal can be useful to get postfix expression of a binary expression tree.

====In-order, LNR====
# Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s left subtree.
# Visit the current node (in the figure: position green).
# Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s right subtree.

In a binary search tree ordered such that in each node the key is greater than all keys in its left subtree and less than all keys in its right subtree, in-order traversal retrieves the keys in &quot;ascending&quot; sorted order.

====Reverse pre-order, NRL====
# Visit the current node.
# Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s right subtree.
# Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s left subtree.

====Reverse post-order, RLN====
# Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s right subtree.
# Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s left subtree.
# Visit the current node.

====Reverse in-order, RNL====
# Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s right subtree.
# Visit the current node.
# Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s left subtree.

In a binary search tree ordered such that in each node the key is greater than all keys in its left subtree and less than all keys in its right subtree, reverse in-order traversal retrieves the keys in &quot;descending&quot; sorted order.

====Arbitrary trees====
To traverse arbitrary trees (not necessarily binary trees) with depth-first search, perform the following operations at each node:
# If the current node is empty then return.
# Visit the current node for pre-order traversal.
# For each &quot;i&quot; from 1 to the current node&#x27;s number of subtrees − 1, or from the latter to the former for reverse traversal, do:
## Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s &quot;i&quot;-th subtree.
## Visit the current node for in-order traversal.
# Recursively traverse the current node&#x27;s last subtree.
# Visit the current node for post-order traversal.

Depending on the problem at hand, pre-order, post-order, and especially one of the number of subtrees − 1 in-order operations may be optional. Also, in practice more than one of pre-order, post-order, and in-order operations may be required. For example, when inserting into a ternary tree, a pre-order operation is performed by comparing items. A post-order operation may be needed afterwards to re-balance the tree.

===Breadth-first search===
In &quot;breadth-first search&quot; (BFS) or &quot;level-order search&quot;, the search tree is broadened as much as possible before going to the next depth.

===Other types===
There are also tree traversal algorithms that classify as neither depth-first search nor breadth-first search. One such algorithm is Monte Carlo tree search, which concentrates on analyzing the most promising moves, basing the expansion of the search tree on random sampling of the search space.

==Applications==

Pre-order traversal can be used to make a prefix expression (Polish notation) from expression trees: traverse the expression tree pre-orderly. For example, traversing the depicted arithmetic expression in pre-order yields &quot;+ * &quot;A&quot; − &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; + &quot;D&quot; &quot;E&quot;. In prefix notation, there is no need for any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. Pre-order traversal is also used to create a copy of the tree.

Post-order traversal can generate a postfix representation (Reverse Polish notation) of a binary tree. Traversing the depicted arithmetic expression in post-order yields &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; − * &quot;D&quot; &quot;E&quot; + +&quot;; the latter can easily be transformed into machine code to evaluate the expression by a stack machine. Post-order traversal is also used to delete the tree. Each node is freed after freeing its children.

In-order traversal is very commonly used on binary search trees because it returns values from the underlying set in order, according to the comparator that set up the binary search tree.

==Implementations==

===Depth-first search implementation===

====Pre-order implementation====
====Post-order implementation====
====In-order implementation====

====Another variant of pre-order====
If the tree is represented by an array (first index is 0), it is possible to calculate the index of the next element:

 procedure bubbleUp(array, i, leaf)
 k ← 1
 i ← (i - 1)/2
 while (leaf + 1) % (k * 2) ≠ k
 i ← (i - 1)/2
 k ← 2 * k
 return i
 procedure preorder(array)
 i ← 0
 while i ≠ array.size
 visit(array[i])
 if i = size - 1
 i ← size
 else if i &lt; size/2
 i ← i * 2 + 1
 else
 leaf ← i - size/2
 parent ← bubble_up(array, i, leaf)
 i ← parent * 2 + 2

====Advancing to the next or previous node====
The codice_1 to be started with may have been found in the binary search tree codice_2 by means of a standard search function, which is shown here in an implementation without parent pointers, i.e. it uses a codice_3 for holding the ancestor pointers.

 procedure search(bst, key)
 // returns a (node, stack)
 node ← bst.root
 stack ← empty stack
 while node ≠ null
 stack.push(node)
 if key = node.key
 return (node, stack)
 if key &lt; node.key
 node ← node.left 
 else
 node ← node.right
 return (null, empty stack)

The function inorderNext returns an in-order-neighbor of codice_1, either the (for codice_5) or the (for codice_6), and the updated codice_3, so that the binary search tree may be sequentially in-order-traversed and searched in the given direction codice_8 further on.

 procedure inorderNext(node, dir, stack)
 newnode ← node.child[dir]
 if newnode ≠ null
 do
 node ← newnode
 stack.push(node)
 newnode ← node.child[1-dir]
 until newnode = null
 return (node, stack)
 // node does not have a dir-child:
 do
 if stack.isEmpty()
 return (null, empty stack)
 oldnode ← node
 node ← stack.pop() // parent of oldnode
 until oldnode ≠ node.child[dir]
 // now oldnode = node.child[1-dir],
 // i.e. node = ancestor (and predecessor/successor) of original node
 return (node, stack)

Note that the function does not use keys, which means that the sequential structure is completely recorded by the binary search tree’s edges. For traversals without change of direction, the (amortised) average complexity is formula_1 because a full traversal takes formula_2 steps for a BST of size formula_3 1 step for edge up and 1 for edge down. The worst-case complexity is formula_4 with formula_5 as the height of the tree.

All the above implementations require stack space proportional to the height of the tree which is a call stack for the recursive and a parent (ancestor) stack for the iterative ones. In a poorly balanced tree, this can be considerable. With the iterative implementations we can remove the stack requirement by maintaining parent pointers in each node, or by threading the tree (next section).

====Morris in-order traversal using threading====

A binary tree is threaded by making every left child pointer (that would otherwise be null) point to the in-order predecessor of the node (if it exists) and every right child pointer (that would otherwise be null) point to the in-order successor of the node (if it exists).

Advantages:
# Avoids recursion, which uses a call stack and consumes memory and time.
# The node keeps a record of its parent.

Disadvantages:
# The tree is more complex.
# We can make only one traversal at a time.
# It is more prone to errors when both the children are not present and both values of nodes point to their ancestors.

Morris traversal is an implementation of in-order traversal that uses threading:
# Create links to the in-order successor.
# Print the data using these links.
# Revert the changes to restore original tree.

===Breadth-first search===
Also, listed below is pseudocode for a simple queue based level-order traversal, and will require space proportional to the maximum number of nodes at a given depth. This can be as much as half the total number of nodes. A more space-efficient approach for this type of traversal can be implemented using an iterative deepening depth-first search.

 procedure levelorder(node)
 queue ← empty queue
 queue.enqueue(node)
 while not queue.isEmpty()
 node ← queue.dequeue()
 visit(node)
 if node.left ≠ null
 queue.enqueue(node.left)
 if node.right ≠ null
 queue.enqueue(node.right)

If the tree is represented by an array (first index is 0), it is sufficient iterating through all elements:

 procedure levelorder(array)
 for i from 0 to array.size
 visit(array[i])

==Infinite trees==
While traversal is usually done for trees with a finite number of nodes (and hence finite depth and finite branching factor) it can also be done for infinite trees. This is of particular interest in functional programming (particularly with lazy evaluation), as infinite data structures can often be easily defined and worked with, though they are not (strictly) evaluated, as this would take infinite time. Some finite trees are too large to represent explicitly, such as the game tree for chess or go, and so it is useful to analyze them as if they were infinite.

A basic requirement for traversal is to visit every node eventually. For infinite trees, simple algorithms often fail this. For example, given a binary tree of infinite depth, a depth-first search will go down one side (by convention the left side) of the tree, never visiting the rest, and indeed an in-order or post-order traversal will never visit &quot;any&quot; nodes, as it has not reached a leaf (and in fact never will). By contrast, a breadth-first (level-order) traversal will traverse a binary tree of infinite depth without problem, and indeed will traverse any tree with bounded branching factor.

On the other hand, given a tree of depth 2, where the root has infinitely many children, and each of these children has two children, a depth-first search will visit all nodes, as once it exhausts the grandchildren (children of children of one node), it will move on to the next (assuming it is not post-order, in which case it never reaches the root). By contrast, a breadth-first search will never reach the grandchildren, as it seeks to exhaust the children first.

A more sophisticated analysis of running time can be given via infinite ordinal numbers; for example, the breadth-first search of the depth 2 tree above will take ω·2 steps: ω for the first level, and then another ω for the second level.

Thus, simple depth-first or breadth-first searches do not traverse every infinite tree, and are not efficient on very large trees. However, hybrid methods can traverse any (countably) infinite tree, essentially via a diagonal argument (&quot;diagonal&quot;—a combination of vertical and horizontal—corresponds to a combination of depth and breadth).

Concretely, given the infinitely branching tree of infinite depth, label the root (), the children of the root (1), (2), ..., the grandchildren (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (2, 1), (2, 2), ..., and so on. The nodes are thus in a one-to-one correspondence with finite (possibly empty) sequences of positive numbers, which are countable and can be placed in order first by sum of entries, and then by lexicographic order within a given sum (only finitely many sequences sum to a given value, so all entries are reached—formally there are a finite number of compositions of a given natural number, specifically 2&quot;n&quot;−1 compositions of ), which gives a traversal. Explicitly:
# (1)
# (1, 1) (2)
# (1, 1, 1) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3)
# (1, 1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 2) (1, 2, 1) (1, 3) (2, 1, 1) (2, 2) (3, 1) (4)

etc.

This can be interpreted as mapping the infinite depth binary tree onto this tree and then applying breadth-first search: replace the &quot;down&quot; edges connecting a parent node to its second and later children with &quot;right&quot; edges from the first child to the second child, from the second child to the third child, etc. Thus at each step one can either go down (append a (, 1) to the end) or go right (add one to the last number) (except the root, which is extra and can only go down), which shows the correspondence between the infinite binary tree and the above numbering; the sum of the entries (minus one) corresponds to the distance from the root, which agrees with the 2&quot;n&quot;−1 nodes at depth in the infinite binary tree (2 corresponds to binary).

<text>The Asian koel (Eudynamys scolopaceus) is a member of the cuckoo family of birds, the Cuculidae. It is found in the Indian Subcontinent, China, and Southeast Asia. It forms a superspecies with the closely related black-billed koels, and Pacific koels which are sometimes treated as subspecies. The Asian koel like many of its related cuckoo kin is a brood parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of crows and other hosts, who raise its young. They are unusual among the cuckoos in being largely frugivorous as adults. The name &quot;koel&quot; is echoic in origin with several language variants. The bird is a widely used symbol in Indian and Nepali poetry.

== Taxonomy ==
In 1747, the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the Asian koel in the second volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Brown and Spotted Indian Cuckow&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a specimen from Bengal that belonged to the London silk-pattern designer and naturalist Joseph Dandridge. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the Asian koel with the other cuckoos in the genus &quot;Cuculus&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Cuculus scolopaceus&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The Asian koel is now placed in the genus &quot;Eudynamys&quot; that was introduced in 1827 by the English naturalists Nicholas Vigors and Thomas Horsfield. The genus name &quot;Eudynamys&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;eu&quot; meaning &quot;fine&quot; with &quot;dunamis&quot; meaning &quot;power&quot; or &quot;strength&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;scolopaceus&quot; is Modern Latin meaning &quot;snipe-like&quot; from Latin &quot;scolopax&quot; meaning &quot;snipe&quot; or &quot;woodcock&quot;.

The species has variations within its wide range with several island populations and a number of taxonomic variations have been suggested. The black-billed koel (&quot;E. melanorhynchus&quot;) of the Sulawesi region and the Pacific koel of Australasia are sometimes considered conspecific with the Asian koel in which case the &quot;combined&quot; species is known as the common koel. Due to differences in plumage, colour of bill and voice, the three are increasingly treated as separate species. Alternatively, only the black-billed koel has been considered as a separate species, or the Asian koel has included all subspecies otherwise included in the Pacific koel, except for the subspecies breeding in Australia, which then has the name Australian koel (&quot;E. cyanocephalus&quot;).

The Asian koel has several geographic forms that have well marked plumage differences or have been geographically isolated with little gene flow. The following is a list of named subspecies with their distributions and synonyms as given by Payne:
*&quot;E. s. scolopaceus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Laccadives and Maldives
*&quot;E. s. chinensis&quot; Cabanis and Heine, 1863 – Southern China and Indochina, except the Thai-Malay Peninsula
*&quot;E. s. harterti&quot; Ingram, C 1912 – Hainan
*&quot;E. s. malayana&quot; Cabanis and Heine, 1863 – Thai-Malay Peninsula, Lesser Sundas and Greater Sundas, except Sulawesi. May include the race &quot;dolosa&quot; described from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
*&quot;E. s. mindanensis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – (includes &quot;E. s. paraguena&quot;) from Palawan, and &quot;E. s. corvina&quot; from Halmahera, the Philippines (including Palawan and the Babuyan Islands), islands between Mindanao and Sulawesi, and North Maluku, except the Sula Islands

== Description ==
The Asian koel is a large and long-tailed cuckoo measuring and weighing . The male of the nominate race is glossy bluish-black, with a pale greenish grey bill, the iris is crimson, and it has grey legs and feet. The female of the nominate race is brownish on the crown and has rufous streaks on the head. The back, rump and wing coverts are dark brown with white and buff spots. The underparts are whitish, but is heavily striped. The other subspecies differ in colouration and size. The upper plumage of young birds is more like that of the male and they have a black beak.
They are very vocal during the breeding season (March to August in the Indian Subcontinent), with a range of different calls. The familiar song of the male is a repeated &quot;koo-Ooo&quot;. The female makes a shrill &quot;kik-kik-kik...&quot; call. Calls vary across populations.

They show a pattern of moult that differs from those of other parasitic cuckoos. The outer primaries show a transilient (alternating) ascending moult (P9-7-5-10-8-6) while the inner primaries are moulted in stepwise descending order (1-2-3-4).(Payne citing Stresemann and Stresemann 1961)

== Distribution and habitat ==

The Asian koel is a bird of light woodland and cultivation. It is a mainly resident breeder in tropical southern Asia from Iran, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Maldives, and Sri Lanka to southern China and the Greater Sundas. They have great potential in colonizing new areas, and were among the pioneer birds to colonize the volcanic island of Krakatau. They first arrived in Singapore in the 1980s and became very common birds.

Some populations may make long-distance movements being found in places like Australia.

== Behaviour ==

The Asian koel is a brood parasite, and lays its single egg in the nests of a variety of birds, including the jungle crow, and house crow. In Sri Lanka before 1880 it was only known to parasitize the jungle crow, later shifting to the house crow. A study in India found 5% of &quot;Corvus splendens&quot; and 0.5% of &quot;Corvus macrorhynchos&quot; nests parasitized.


In Bangladesh, they parasitise long-tailed shrike (&quot;Lanius schach&quot;), common myna (&quot;Acridotheres tristis&quot;) and house crows (&quot;Corvus splendens&quot;) at about 35.7, 31.2 and 10.8% rates respectively. Host nests at low heights and nearer to fruit trees tended to be preferred by koels. In southern Thailand and the Malay Peninsula, koels have shifted host from crows to mynas (&quot;Acridotheres&quot; sp.) as the latter became more common in the late 1900s. A record exists of black drongo raising a koel, and other hosts recorded include the European magpie and possibly the black-headed oriole. In the Philippines, Asian Koels have been found to parasitize the cavity nest of Coletos (&quot;Sarcops calvus&quot;). Males may distract the hosts so that the female gets a chance to lay an egg in the nest. More often however, the female visits the nest of the host alone. The koel is not known to lay eggs in an empty host nest and a study in Pakistan found that the first koel eggs were laid, on average, within one and half days of the laying of the host&#x27;s first egg. The chicks of the koel hatched about 3 days ahead of the host chicks. Koels usually lay only an egg or two in a single nest but as many as seven to eleven eggs have been reported from some host nests. A female may remove a host egg before laying. Eggs hatch in 12 to 14 days. The young koel does not always push out eggs or evict the host chicks, and initially calls like a crow. The young fledge in 20 to 28 days. Unlike some other cuckoos, the young do not attempt to kill the host chicks, a trait that is shared with the channel-billed cuckoos which are also largely frugivorous as adults. Some scholars, Rebecca Kilner in particular, have suggested that koels, like some other brood parasites, do not evict the host chicks as a result of higher costs which might outweigh the benefits of evicting nestmates. A small parasite may not be able to evict large host eggs or chicks from a deep Corvid nest without risking starvation and possibly accidental self-eviction. An alternative hypothesis that retaining host chicks might benefit the koel chicks did not gain much support. Adult female parents have been known to feed young koels in the nests of the hosts, a behaviour seen in some other brood parasitic species as well. Adult males have however not been noted to feed fledglings.

The Asian koel is omnivorous, consuming a variety of insects, caterpillars, eggs and small vertebrates. Adults feed mainly on fruit. They will sometimes defend fruiting trees that they forage in and chase away other frugivores. They have been noted to be especially important in the dispersal of the sandalwood tree (&quot;Santalum album&quot;) in India. Large seeded fruits are sometimes quickly regurgitated near the parent tree while small seeded fruits are ingested and are likely to be deposited at greater distances from the parent tree. They have a large gape and are capable of swallowing large fruits including the hard fruit of palms such as &quot;Arenga&quot; and &quot;Livistona&quot;. They have been known to occasionally take eggs of small birds.

They feed on the fruits of &quot;Cascabela thevetia&quot; which are known to be toxic to mammals.

A number of parasites of the species have been described, including malaria-like protozoa, lice and nematodes.


== In culture ==
The word &quot;koel&quot; is onomatopoeic in origin. The Sanskrit name of &quot;Kokila&quot; and words in several Indian languages are similarly echoic. Being familiar birds with loud calls, references to them are common in folklore, myth and poetry. It is traditionally held in high regard for its song and revered in the Manusmriti, with a decree protecting them from harm. The Vedas, Sanskrit literature dated to about 2000 BC referred to it as &quot;Anya-Vapa&quot; which has been translated as &quot;that which was raised by others&quot; (or &quot;sown for others to reap&quot;). This has been interpreted as the earliest written reference to brood parasitism. It has been chosen as the state bird by the Indian union territory of Puducherry.

These birds were once very popular in India as cagebirds. Feeding even on boiled rice, these hardy birds lived in captivity for as long as 14 years.

<text>Nepenthe (, ) is a possibly fictional medicine for sorrow – a &quot;drug of forgetfulness&quot; mentioned in ancient Greek literature and Greek mythology, depicted as originating in Egypt.

The carnivorous plant genus &quot;Nepenthes&quot; is named after the drug nepenthe.

==In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;==
The word &quot;&quot; first appears in the fourth book of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;:

==Analysis==
Figuratively, nepenthe means &quot;that which chases away sorrow&quot;. Literally it means &#x27;not-sorrow&#x27; or &#x27;anti-sorrow&#x27;: , , i.e. &quot;not&quot; (privative prefix), and , from , , i.e. &quot;grief, sorrow, or mourning&quot;. 

In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, νηπενθές φάρμακον : (i.e. an anti-sorrow drug) is a magical potion given to Helen by Polydamna, the wife of the noble Egyptian Thon; it quells all sorrows with forgetfulness.

<text>Scydmaeninae are a subfamily of small beetles, commonly called ant-like stone beetles or scydmaenines. These beetles occur worldwide, and the subfamily includes some 4,500 species in about 80 genera. Established as a family, they were reduced in status to a subfamily of Staphylinidae in 2009 

Many scydmaenine species have a narrowing between head and thorax and thorax and abdomen, resulting in a passing resemblance to ants that inspires their common name. They are typically small beetles, with some very small species only half a millimeter in length. Scydmaenids typically live in leaf litter and rotting logs in forests, preferring moist habitats. A number of types are known to feed on oribatid mites, using &quot;hole scraping&quot; and &quot;cutting&quot; techniques to get through the mite&#x27;s hard shells.

In addition to the two living subfamilies, the prehistoric subfamily Hapsomelinae, known only from fossils, has been placed here.

<text>The Treaty of Shimoda (下田条約, &quot;Shimoda Jouyaku&quot;) (formally Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between Japan and Russia 日露和親条約, &quot;Nichi-Ro Washin Jouyaku&quot;) of February 7, 1855, was the first treaty between the Russian Empire, and the Empire of Japan, then under the administration of the Tokugawa shogunate. Following shortly after the Convention of Kanagawa signed between Japan and the United States, it effectively meant the end of Japan&#x27;s 220-year-old policy of national seclusion (&quot;sakoku&quot;), by opening the ports of Nagasaki, Shimoda and Hakodate to Russian vessels. The treaty also established the position of Russian consuls in Japan and defined the borders between Japan and Russia.

==The isolation of Japan==
Since the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Tokugawa shogunate pursued a policy of isolating the country from outside influences. Foreign trade was maintained only with the Dutch, Koreans, and the Chinese and was conducted exclusively at Nagasaki under a strict government monopoly. This policy had two main objectives. One was the fear that trade with western powers and the spread of Christianity would serve as a pretext for the invasion of Japan by imperialist forces, as had been the case with most of the nations of Asia. The second objective was fear that foreign trade and the wealth developed would lead to the rise of a daimyō powerful enough to overthrow the ruling Tokugawa clan.
The first contacts between Japan and Russia were made with the Matsumae clan in Hokkaido by the merchant Pavel Lebedev-Lastochkin in 1778 and by official envoy Adam Laxman in 1792. The Russian expedition around the world led by Adam Johann von Krusenstern stayed six months in the port of Nagasaki in 1804–1805, failing to establish diplomatic and trade relations with Japan.

By the early nineteenth century, this policy of isolation was increasingly under challenge. In 1844, King William II of the Netherlands sent a letter urging Japan to end the isolation policy on its own before change would be forced from the outside. In 1846, an official American expedition led by Commodore James Biddle arrived in Japan asking for ports to be opened for trade, but was sent away.

==The Putiatin mission==

A few years later, Russia learned that the United States was preparing an expedition to be led by Commodore Matthew Perry, to open Japan by gunboat diplomacy if necessary. If successful, it was feared that this would provide more American influence in the Pacific region and Asia, and to give America the most advantage position in Japan. Russia immediately recommenced plans to send a mission to the Far East. Russian minister of Foreign Affairs Karl Nesselrode assigned Vice-Admiral Euphimy Vasil&#x27;evich Putiatin to head the Russian mission. The expedition included several notable Sinologists and a number of scientists and engineers, as well as the noted author Ivan Goncharov, and the &quot;Pallada&quot; under the command of Ivan Unkovsky was selected as the flagship. Goncharov would use the experience in his &quot;Fregat Pallada&quot; (1858), in which he described the details of the voyage and the negotiations. It is a valuable description of how the Japanese received and processed foreign trade vessels and the perception of the experience of the Russians.

&quot;Pallada&quot; departed Kronstadt on October 7, 1852, under orders to return only with a treaty at least as good as the one the Americans had obtained. Also on the Russian agenda was a delimitation of the borders between Japan and Russia in Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands.

However it became clear during the long voyage that the vessel was unsuited for the expedition, and the newer 52-gun frigate &quot;Diana&quot; was subsequently dispatched, but Perry and his fleet of Black Ships reached Japan while Putiatin was still between Hong Kong and the Bonin Islands. Despite years of debate on the isolation policy, Perry&#x27;s visit created great controversy within the highest levels of the Tokugawa shogunate. 

Eventually, Putiatin arrived in Japan with his four vessels on August 21, 1853, but at Nagasaki rather than attempting to force his way into Edo Bay as Perry had done. Putiatin and Perry had a somewhat differing approach to negotiating with the Japanese. Perry stressed the firepower of his warships and the possible consequences for Japan. Putiatin chose a more diplomatic and strategic approach in the hopes of undermining the American efforts, advising that he had chosen Nagasaki despite his orders to go to Edo out of respect for Japanese laws and the ardent desire of the Russian Emperor for good relations. Officials sent word to Edo, and while waiting for a response, Putiatin sailed to Shanghai for supplies and for news from home. On his return to Nagasaki, there was still no reply, so he renewed his threat to go directly to Edo. The alarmed &quot;Nagasaki bugyō&quot; urged Edo to accept Putiatin&#x27;s terms, as the Russians seemed more accommodating that the Americans, and their huge empire might be used to offset threat posed by Perry. Again, there was no response, partly because the Shōgun himself, Tokugawa Ieyoshi died days after Perry&#x27;s departure, and was succeeded by his sickly young son, Tokugawa Iesada, leaving effective administration in the hands of the Council of Elders (&quot;rōjū&quot;) led by Hotta Masayoshi, which was paralyzed with indecision. Putiatin grew increasingly impatient and renewed his threat to sail to Edo, when a response came in the form of the officials Kawaji Toshiakira and Tsutsui Masanori, asking for a delay of three to five years for a counter-proposal. Disappointed, Putiatin left Japan in November 1853 promising to return in the spring.
Putiatin was not able to return until November 7, 1854. In the meantime, he had surveyed the coast of Korea and the Russian Maritime Province and had learned of the outbreak of the Crimean War, and that the British Royal Navy was hunting for his squadron in the Sea of Okhotsk and the seas around Japan, including Nagasaki. Problems with &quot;Pallada&quot; caused him to change his flag to the &quot;Diana&quot;. By the time Putiatin returned, the Americans had already succeeded in opening Japan with the Treaty of Kanagawa in early 1854. To prevent a Russian treaty and limit Russian influence, the British approached Japan to ask for Japanese neutrality in the war. Because of a bad translation, the British obtained an unintended Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty in 1854. Instead of Nagasaki, Putiatin chose Osaka Bay, which caused immediate consternation among the Japanese for its proximity to Kyoto. After remaining in Osaka Bay for two weeks, Putiatin set sail for Shimoda.
Putiatin was met in Shimoda by Kawaji and Tsutsui, and negotiations began on December 22, 1854, with Putiatin offering to cede the island of Etorofu to Japan in exchange for trade rights, whereas the Japanese countered that since Kamchatka belonged to Japan, it followed that all of the Kuril Islands were also Japanese as well.

On December 23, 1854, the Ansei Tokai earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.4 on the Richter magnitude scale, shook Japan and surroundings. A 7-meter-high tsunami destroyed most of Shimoda including Putiatin&#x27;s ships, with the exception of &quot;Diana&quot;, which was badly damaged and which soon sank as she attempted to sail to Heda for repairs.

The Russian delegation now found itself stranded in Japan, and while the diplomats renegotiated, Russian sailors and technicians worked with Japanese carpenters to build a new vessel at Heda to enable the delegation to return to Russia.

On February 7, 1855, the long-awaited Russo-Japanese treaty of friendship was signed at the Chōraku-ji Temple in Shimoda by Putiatin as Russian Imperial Ambassador and Japanese representative Controller Moriyama Einosuke signing the Dutch-language version (the official version), Iosif Antonovich and signing the Chinese-language version, and Toshiakira Kawaji and Tsutsui Masanori signing the Japanese-language version.

Patterned after Perry&#x27;s Kanagawa Treaty and the Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty, the Shimoda Treaty contained many of the same provisions; however, perhaps out of sympathy or out of a favorable impression of Putiatin, the terms agreed upon by Japan were slightly more generous than that granted to the Americans and the British.

The Japanese found Putiatin to be a civilized and righteous man. Putiatin remarked to his Japanese colleague Tsutsui:
:&quot;If we would compare our age, you have the wise age of my father for I only have the age of your son. I offer my hand so I can serve my father and this way will not lose the way of trust.&quot;

The schooner &quot;Heda&quot; was launched on April 14 and Putiatin was able to sail back to Russia, on May 8, 1855. The Japanese government ordered later six more ships to be built on the model of the &quot;Heda&quot;, thereby contributing to the development of western-style shipbuilding in Japan.

==Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between Japan and Russia (1855)==
The &quot;Shimoda Treaty&quot; has nine articles: 
The treaty opened Nagasaki, Shimoda and Hakodate to Russian ships for supplies and repairs, for a consul to be stationed at one of these ports, and for most favored nation status. The official border between Japan and Russia was set as in between Etorofu and Urup, with the status of Sakhalin left undetermined. An unequal treaty, it also provided for the extraterritoriality of Russians in Japan.

==Consequences of the treaty==

Although Putiatin was lionized after his return to St Petersburg, and was elevated to the title of Count, he was also criticized for the lack of a commercial agreement with Japan, and was forced to return in 1857 and again in 1858 to negotiate new treaties, which expanded on Russian commercial rights and extraterritoriality. One of the most important features of the 1855 Treaty of Shimoda was the agreement that the Kuril Islands were to be divided between Russia and Japan at a line running in between Etorofu and Urup, and the treaty is still frequently cited to this date by the Japanese government as one of its justifications in the current Kuril Islands dispute.

==Monument to the treaty==

A memorial sign in honor of the 150th anniversary of the establishment of the Russian-Japanese relations was opened in Kronstadt in 2005. The monument is a black stone where on the Russian and Japanese languages described a brief history of the Putiatin mission. The monument was opened by the Consul General of Japan in St. Petersburg and St. Petersburg Governor.

<text>Duracell Inc. is an American manufacturer of alkaline batteries, specialty cells, and rechargeables; it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway since 2016. The company has its origins in the 1920s, through the work of Samuel Ruben and Philip Mallory, and the formation of the P. R. Mallory Company.

Through a number of corporate mergers and acquisitions, Duracell came to be owned by the consumer products conglomerate Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G). In November 2014, P&amp;G reached an agreement to sell the company to the international conglomeration Berkshire Hathaway through a transfer of shares. Under the deal, Berkshire Hathaway exchanged the shares it held in P&amp;G for ownership of the Duracell business.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
 Duracell originated via the partnership of scientist Samuel Ruben and businessman Philip Rogers Mallory, who met during the 1920s. The P. R. Mallory Company of Burlington, Massachusetts, United States, relocated its headquarters to Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1924. The company produced mercury batteries for military equipment, trumping the carbon-zinc batteries used then in virtually all applications. In 1956, P. R. Mallory &amp; Co. acquired General Dry Batteries, Inc. (GDB) with headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio. GDB was then the third-largest U. S. manufacturer of zinc-carbon batteries and had made mercury batteries under license from P. R. Mallory during and post World War II until its acquisition in 1956. During the 1950s, Kodak introduced cameras with a bulb flash. The design required a new zinc-carbon cell size; AAA was introduced.
In 1964, the term &quot;Duracell&quot; was introduced as a brand, from &quot;durable cell&quot;. Until 1980, the batteries also bore the Mallory brand.

=== Developments ===
P. R. Mallory was acquired by Dart Industries in 1978, which in turn, merged with Kraft in 1980. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts bought Duracell in 1988 and took the company public in 1989. It was acquired for $7 billion by The Gillette Company in 1996.

In 2005, Procter &amp; Gamble acquired Duracell&#x27;s parent Gillette for $57 billion.

In September 2011, Duracell and Powermat Technologies Ltd. started a joint venture, called Duracell Powermat, to make small wireless chargers for mobile phones and small electronics, with P&amp;G owning 55% of the joint venture shares and Powermat 45%.

In March 2012, along with Powermat Technologies, Duracell, under the Procter &amp; Gamble corporate umbrella, founded the Power Matters Alliance (PMA), an alliance of leading industry and governmental organizations that is dedicated to advancing smart and environmentally sound wireless power. AT&amp;T and Starbucks joined the board later that year.

In 2013, the company released a &quot;Duracell Quantum&quot; line as their top-performing alkaline batteries.

=== P&amp;G spin-off and Berkshire Hathaway ownership ===
On October 24, 2014, Procter &amp; Gamble announced it would spin off Duracell in 2015 as part of a wider restructuring scheme. On November 14, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway declared its intent to acquire Duracell in an all-stock deal, consisting of $4.7 billion worth of P&amp;G stock then owned by Berkshire Hathaway. The acquisition received regulatory approval from the European Commission in July 2015.

The transfer was completed on February 29, 2016, with P&amp;G investing $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell, and Berkshire Hathaway giving P&amp;G back 52 million shares.

In September 2016, Duracell announced plans to move its executive team and 60 employees to Chicago.

In February 2022, Duracell announced a long-term partnership deal with Williams Racing. The deal culminated with the vertical air intake of the car designed like a Duracell battery, which was first introduced in the 2022 Miami Grand Prix. The design was later implemented on the Williams FW45 for the 2023 season. Duracell also became the title sponsor of William Racing&#x27;s eNASCAR team as Duracell Williams Esports eNASCAR.

== Products ==

Duracell manufactures alkaline batteries in many common sizes, such as AAA, AA, C, D, and 9V. Lesser-used sizes such as AAAA (primarily for pagers, penlights, and blood glucose meters) and J size batteries (for hospital devices and photographic strobe flash units) are also manufactured and a range of &quot;button cells&quot; using zinc-air, silver-oxide, and lithium chemistries, used in calculators, watches, hearing aids, and other small (mostly medical-related) devices. Duracell entered into a brand licensing agreement with flash memory manufacturer Dane-Elec in 2008 for a line of products including memory cards, hard drives and USB flash drives with the Duracell brand mark and in the brand&#x27;s trademark &quot;copper top&quot; coloring.

Duracell also manufactures specialty batteries, including NiMH rechargeable batteries and batteries for cameras, watches, hearing aids, etc. Their two main battery brands are &quot;CopperTop (Plus),&quot; marketed as longer-lasting, and &quot;Ultra,&quot; directed mainly at users of digital devices and devices that need more power. Duracell also makes some lithium batteries and car batteries.
Duracell manufactures alkaline and lithium batteries in prismatic as well as cylindrical shape. In 2006, Duracell introduced &quot;Power Pix&quot; batteries with NiOx technology, designed to power digital cameras and other high-drain devices for up to twice as long as alkaline batteries.

Duracell&#x27;s professional batteries have been sold in the United States and Europe under the brand name &quot;Procell&quot; (previously &quot;Industrial by Duracell&quot; and &quot;Duracell Procell&quot;). Two main product lines are currently sold under the Procell brand, &quot;Procell Alkaline&quot; and &quot;Procell Intense Power&quot;, intended to provide longer endurance by tailoring the power profile of the batteries to the requirements of the device. &quot;Procell Alkaline&quot; are designed for use in low-drain applications such as clocks, and Procell Intense Power is designed for higher-drain devices.

In the 1980s, the company briefly had a line of flashlights called Durabeam, marketed as being much stronger and brighter than other flashlights.

<text>The grey-bellied cuckoo or the Indian plaintive cuckoo (Cacomantis passerinus) is a cuckoo with widespread occurrence throughout Asia.

==Description==
The grey-bellied cuckoo is one of the smaller cuckoos, at a total length of about 23 cm. Adults are mainly grey with a white lower belly and undertail. There is a white patch on the wings. Some females are dark-barred reddish brown above with an unbarred tail and have strongly dark-barred whitish underparts. The juvenile resembles the female but is of a duller grey.

==Distribution and habitat==
The grey-bellied cuckoo breeds in tropical southern Asia from India and Sri Lanka to south China and Indonesia. It has been reported from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. It is a short-distance migrant, since birds at more northerly latitudes and on higher ground are summer visitors, leaving for warmer areas in winter. The species prefers light woodland and cultivated areas.

==Ecology==

The grey-bellied cuckoo is a brood parasite and uses warblers as hosts. It lays a single egg. Its diet consists of a variety of insects and caterpillars. This is a noisy species, with a persistent and loud &quot;pee-pip-pee-pee&quot; call, with its tail depressed.

<text>Dzyarzhynsk or Dzerzhinsk (; ), formerly known as Koydanava until 1932, is a town in Minsk Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Dzyarzhynsk District. As of 2024, it has a population of 29,796.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, the village belonged to the Radziwiłłs, a Polish–Lithuanian aristocratic family.

===Jewish community===

Jews lived in Koidanova as early as 1620. Koidanova became the site of a new Hasidic Jewish dynasty in 1833 when Rabbi Shlomo Chaim Perlow (1797–1862) became the first Koidanover Rebbe. He was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Boruch Mordechai Perlow (1818–1870), grandson, Rabbi Aharon Perlow (1839–1897), and great-grandson, Rabbi Yosef Perlow of Koidanov-Minsk (1854-1915), who was the last Koidanover Rebbe to live in the town. After World War I, the dynasty was moved to Baranovichi, then in Poland.

In 1847, Koidanova had 2,497 Jewish inhabitants. In 1897, the city had a total population of 4,744, of whom 3,156 were Jews.

===Inter-war period===

In May 1932, it was granted the status of a city and was renamed Koidanau () or Koydanov (). In June of that year it was renamed again as Dziaržynsk by the Communist authorities, in honour of Felix Dzerzhinsky (1877–1926), a famous Bolshevik creator and chief of the &quot;Extraordinary Commission&quot; (CHEKA) – the Soviet secret police - who was born in a Dziaržynava estate not far from the city, although on the other side of the then Polish-Soviet border.

The city was the capital of the short-lived Dzierzynszczyzna Polish Autonomous District during 1932–38.

===World War II===
It fell under German occupation during World War II. It was captured on 28 June 1941.

The Lithuanian Twelfth Schutzmannschaft (auxiliary police) Battalion&#x27;s 1st Company, led by Lieutenant Z. Kemzura, massacred approximately 1,600 Jews from the city on 21 October 1941, shooting them and throwing them into a pit; many were buried alive. As it is reported in &quot;The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry&quot;: &quot;For three hours the earth covering the mass grave would move; people still alive were trying to crawl out of their grave.&quot; On 1–2 March 1942 the Einsatzgruppen transported several thousand Jews from throughout Belarus and murdered them in Koidanov. The city was liberated by the Soviet Red Army on 6 July 1944.

===Modern day===
In 1998, the city had 24,700 inhabitants.

Now part of Belarus, the name Kojdanava () is becoming popular again (it is the official name for the railway station of Dzyarzhynsk), but the official name remains unchanged.

==Geography==
The highest point of Belarus, Dzyarzhynskaya Hara, is several kilometers from Dzyarzhynsk.

== Transport ==
There is a rail route across the city from Minsk Passazhirsky to Baranovichi Polesskie.

There is only one bus route in Dziarzhynsk; there are 18 stops.

==Sport==
The local football club is the Arsenal Dzerzhinsk, playing in the Belarusian First League. Its home ground is the City Stadium.

==Notable residents==
*Avrom Reyzen (1876–1953), Yiddish writer, poet, and editor
*Joseph Schlossberg (1875–1971), American labor union activist
*Aharon Perlow (1839–1897) – third rebbe of Koidanov
*Karol Hutten-Czapski, Leliwa coat of arms, (1860-1904). Polish Count and philanthropist. President of Minsk, Lithuania (1890-1901)
*Emeryk Hutten-Czapski, Leliwa coat of arms, (1828–1896). Polish Count, scholar, ardent historical collector and numismatist

<text>Sphaeralcea is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family (Malvaceae). There are about 40-60 species, including annuals, perennials, and shrubs. Most originate in the drier regions of North America, with some known from South America. They are commonly known as globemallows, globe mallows, false mallows or falsemallows. The name of the genus is derived from the Greek words σφαῖρα (&quot;sphaira&quot;), meaning &quot;sphere,&quot; and αλκεα (&quot;alkea&quot;), meaning &quot;mallow.&quot;

The leaves of these plants are spirally arranged, and usually palmate or toothed. Both stems and leaves are downy. Like other Malvaceae, the flowers are saucer- or cup-shaped, with the stamens joined into a column in the center.

&quot;Sphaeralcea&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Schinia olivacea&quot;, which has been recorded on &quot;S. lindheimeri&quot;.

<text>Leopard frog is a generic name used to refer to various species in the true frog genus Lithobates. They all have similar coloration: brown or green with spots that form a leopard pattern. They are distinguished by their distribution and behavioral, morphological, and genetic differences. The range of the various species of leopard frogs extends from the Hudson Bay in Canada, throughout the United States, throughout Mexico and other parts of Central America, and possibly the very northern section of South America.

==Taxonomy==
Leopard frogs are grouped in the genus &quot;Lithobates&quot;, along with many other different frogs such as the American bullfrog.

== New species ==
Several leopard frog species look very similar to each other, and even within a population there is a lot of variation. Some populations may actually be cryptic species complexes. 

In March 2012, it was announced that DNA testing had confirmed that a new species of leopard frog had been found whose habitat was centered near New York&#x27;s Yankee Stadium and included northern New Jersey, southeastern New York, and Staten Island; the new species was first distinguished by its short, repetitive croak, distinct from the &quot;long snore&quot; or &quot;rapid chuckle&quot; of other leopard frog species in that area (&quot;L. pipiens&quot; and &quot;L. sphenocephalus&quot;). This distinct species has been identified as far south as southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. On 30 October 2014, it was announced that the frog found in March 2012 has been described as a new species: the Atlantic Coast leopard frog (&quot;Lithobates kauffeldi&quot;) that once inhabited Manhattan, New York.

<text>Lithobates pipiens formerly Rana pipiens, commonly known as the northern leopard frog, is a species of leopard frog from the true frog family, native to parts of Canada and the United States. It is the state amphibian of Minnesota and Vermont.

==Description==

The northern leopard frog is a fairly large species of frog, reaching about in snout-to-vent length. It varies from green to brown in dorsal color, with large, dark, circular spots on its back, sides, and legs. Each spot is normally bordered by a lighter ring. A pair of dorsolateral folds starting from the back of the eye runs parallel to each other down the back. These dorsolateral folds are often lighter or occasionally pinkish in colour. Also, a pale stripe runs from the nostril, under the eye and tympanum, terminating at the shoulder. The ventral surface is white or pale green. The iris is golden and toes are webbed.

Tadpoles are dark brown or grey, with light blotches on the underside. The tail is pale tan.

==Color variations==


The northern leopard frog has several different color variations, with the most common two being the green and the brown morphs, with another morph known as the burnsi morph. Individuals with the burnsi morph coloration lack spots on their backs, but may or may not retain them on their legs. They can be bright green or brown and have yellow dorsal folds. Albinism also appears in this species, but is very rare. They can also be blue, and this is quite rare also.

==Ecology and behavior==

Northern leopard frogs have a wide range of habitats. They are found in permanent ponds, swamps, marshes, and slow-moving streams throughout forest, open, and urban areas. They normally inhabit water bodies with abundant aquatic vegetation. In the summer, they often abandon ponds and move to grassy areas and lawns. They are well adapted to cold and can be found above above mean sea level. Males make a short, snore-like call from water during spring and summer. The northern leopard frog breeds in the spring (March–June). Up to 6500 eggs are laid in water, and tadpoles complete development within the breeding pond. Tadpoles are light brown with black spots, and development takes 70–110 days, depending on conditions. Metamorph frogs are long and resemble the adult.

This species was once quite common through parts of western Canada and the United States until declines started occurring during the 1970s. Although the definitive cause of this decline is unknown, habitat loss and fragmentation, environmental contaminants, introduced fish, drought, and disease have been proposed as mechanisms of decline and are likely preventing species&#x27; recovery in many areas. Many populations of northern leopard frogs have not yet recovered from these declines.

Northern leopard frogs are preyed upon by many different animals, such as snakes, raccoons, other frogs, and even humans. They do not produce distasteful skin secretions and rely on speed to evade predation.

They eat a wide variety of animals, including crickets, flies, worms, and smaller frogs. Using their large mouths, they can even swallow birds and garter snakes. In one case, a bat was recorded as prey of this frog. This species is similar to the pickerel frog (&quot;Lithobates palustris&quot;) and the southern leopard frog (&quot;Lithobates sphenocephalus&quot;).

==Research==

===Medical===
The northern leopard frog produces specific ribonucleases to its oocytes. Those enzymes are potential drugs for cancer. One such molecule, called ranpirnase (onconase), is in clinical trials as a treatment for pleural mesothelioma and lung tumors. Another, amphinase, has been described as a potential treatment for brain tumors.

===Neuroscience===
The northern leopard frog has been a preferred species for making discoveries about basic properties of neurons since the 1950s. The neuromuscular junction of the sciatic nerve fibers of the sartorius muscle of this frog has been the source of initial data about the nervous system.

===Muscle physiology and biomechanics===
The northern leopard frog is a popular species for &quot;in vitro&quot; experiments in muscle physiology and biomechanics due to the ease of accessibility for investigators in its native range and the ability of the sartorius muscle to stay alive &quot;in vitro&quot; for several hours. Furthermore, the reliance of the frog on two major modes of locomotion (jumping and swimming) allows for understanding how muscle properties contribute to organismal performance in each of these modes.

==Range==
Northern leopard frogs occur from Great Slave Lake and Hudson Bay, Canada, south to Kentucky and New Mexico, USA. It is also found in Panama, where it is endemic to the central cordillera and western Pacific lowlands, although this is most likely an undescribed species. They occupy grasslands, lakeshores, and marshes.

<text>Fonterra Co-operative Group Limited is a New Zealand multinational publicly traded dairy co-operative owned by New Zealand farmers. The company is responsible for approximately 30% of the world&#x27;s dairy exports and with revenue exceeding NZ $22 billion, making it New Zealand&#x27;s largest company. It is the sixth-largest dairy company in the world as of 2022, as well as the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.

Fonterra was established in October 2001 following the merger of the country&#x27;s two largest dairy co-operatives, New Zealand Dairy Group (NZDG) and Kiwi Cooperative Dairies, with the New Zealand Dairy Board. The name Fonterra comes from Latin , meaning &quot;spring from the land&quot;.

== History ==
===Background===
In New Zealand, as in most Western countries, dairy co-operatives have long been the main organisational structure in the industry. The first dairy co-operative was established in Otago in 1871. By 1920, there were 600 dairy processing factories of which about 85% were owned by co-operatives. In the 1930s there were around 500 co-operatives but after World War II, improved transportation, processing technologies and energy systems led to a trend of consolidation, where the co-operatives merged and became larger and fewer in number. By the end of the 1990s, there were only four co-operatives nationwide: the Waikato-based New Zealand Dairy Group, the Taranaki-based Kiwi Co-operative Dairies, Westland Milk Products, and Tatua Co-operative Dairy Company.

===Formation===
Fonterra was formed in 2001 from the merger of the two largest co-operatives, New Zealand Dairy Group and Kiwi Co-operative Dairies, together with the New Zealand Dairy Board, which had been the marketing and export agent for all the co-operatives. Fonterra effectively has monopsony control of the New Zealand domestic and export dairy industry. The merger was initially turned down by the New Zealand Commerce Commission, but later approved by the New Zealand Government, with subsequent legislation deregulating the dairy industry, allowing for the export of dairy products to be undertaken by any company. The two smaller co-operatives, Tatua and Westland (which would later be acquired by Yili Group in 2019), did not join Fonterra, instead remaining independent.

The company has an annual revenue of around NZ$22 billion. Its core business consists of exporting dairy products under the NZMP brand (95% of its New Zealand production is exported). It also operates a fast-moving consumer goods business for dairy products, Fonterra Brands. Fonterra has a number of subsidiaries and joint-venture companies operating in markets around the world.

===International expansion===
In 2005, the company purchased a large factory in Dennington, Victoria, Australia, from Nestlé, after they moved out of the collection of milk from farmers and the manufacture of powdered milk in Australia. Also in 2005 the company made moves towards purchasing Australian companies Dairy Farmers and National Foods. It also converted its 50 per cent stake in Victoria dairy producer Bonlac to full ownership. At this time $1 billion of Fonterra&#x27;s revenue was from Australian sales, which was 14 per cent of the dairy products it sells around the world.

In June 2008, the company acquired the yoghurt and dairy dessert business of Nestlé Australia, which it on-sold to Parmalat Australia in December 2015.

In 2010, leaked US embassy cables suggested New Zealand had only sent troops to Iraq in 2003, following the initial invasion, so Fonterra would keep valuable Oil for Food contracts. New Zealand was not a member of the coalition which supported invasion of the country, but later sent combat engineers for mine clearance and other such tasks.

===Asset sales and divestment===
In 2019, the Tip Top ice cream brand was sold for NZ$380 million to Froneri, a global joint venture between Nestlé and PAI Partners.

In September 2019, Fonterra agreed to sell its 50% stake in DFE Pharma for NZ$633 million ($400.37 million).

In late February 2022, Fonterra suspended exports to Russia in protest of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The company had exported NZ$240 million worth of produce to Russia in 2021. On 21 March, Fonterra closed its office in Moscow and withdrew from its joint venture with Russian company Unifood.

In mid May 2024, Fonterra announced plans to sell its global consumer business as part of a shift towards becoming a global business-to-business supplier of dairy nutrition products. The company&#x27;s consumer business brands included Anchor, Mainland, Kapiti, Anlene, Anmum, Fernleaf, Western Star, and Perfect Italiano; which comprise 15% of the co-op&#x27;s total milk solids. Other brands affected by the proposed divestment include its subsidiaries Fonterra Oceania and Fonterra Sri Lanka. In addition, the divestment could affect Fonterra&#x27;s 17 manufacturing sites including three facilities in New Zealand.

On 11 November, Fonterra confirmed that it would be selling its consumer brands including Anchor, Mainland, Kāpiti, Anlene, Anmum, Fernleaf, Western Star, Perfect Italiano. The company also confirmed that it would sell its subsidiaries Fonterra Oceania and Fonterra Sri Lanka, as well as its 17 manufacturing sites including its three New Zealand facilities.

==Fonterra Research and Development Centre==

In 1927 the New Zealand Dairy Research Institute (NZDRI) was founded in Palmerston North as part of the Department of Scientific Industrial Research, which was renamed to the Fonterra Research and Development Centre (FRDC) when Fonterra was formed in 2001. FRDC is purportedly one of the largest dairy research centres in the world, and as of 2019, it hosts several hundred engineers, scientists and researchers and holds 350 milk related patents. A large number of technologies involving whey, casein, lactoferrin, nisin, anhydrous milk fat, as well as cheesemaking and milk powder production have been developed at the centre.

FRDC has a substantial library of over 100,000 cheese starter cultures, which began in the 1930s under Hugh Whitehead. The centre has pioneered research on bacteriophages; in 1935 a bacteriophage was identified as the cause of failure in cheese starter isolates, and in 1992 the centre sequenced the genome of bacteriophage c2, which was the first whole genome to be sequenced in New Zealand.

==Corporate structure==
===Governance===
John Roadley was the inaugural chairman of Fonterra&#x27;s board. He foreshadowed his resignation in August 2002 and was succeeded, after the next annual general meeting, by Henry van der Heyden. Van der Heyden held the chairmanship until December 2012. John Wilson succeeded van der Heyden and announced his resignation in July 2018 due to illness (he died in January 2019 aged 54). John Monaghan succeeded Wilson. He is the current chairperson and in March 2020, he foreshadowed that he would step down in November 2020. In June 2020, Peter McBride was announced as Monaghan&#x27;s successor.

In 2014, Farm Source was launched as a new brand platform for RD1 and provides retail benefits including Farm Source Rewards. Farm Source is also the farmer support business unit, with Area Managers, Sustainable Dairying Advisors and Technical Sales Representatives providing on-farm tools and advice for farmers, such as Farm Environment Plans. Farm Source is New Zealand&#x27;s largest retailer of agricultural supplies to dairy farmers. There are 66 Farm Source stores across New Zealand as well an online ecommerce offer.

===Changes to capital structure===

In November 2007, the board of directors announced a two-year consultation programme regarding their preferred capital re-structuring option: putting the business operations in a separate publicly listed company, with the co-operative maintaining a controlling interest. The aim was to give more access to funds for global growth.

Praised by some as a bold move which would allow better access to outside capital, the proposals encountered significant opposition from both farmer shareholders and the government (who would be required to pass enabling legislation). Despite including a range of safeguards, farmers were clearly concerned at the risk of losing control; in what was sometimes described as a demutualization.

The board responded in 2008 by shelving the November 2007 proposal and continuing consultation and discussion with farmer shareholders. In September 2009, the board announced a three-step process to revamp Fonterra&#x27;s capital structure. The new approach abandoned thoughts of a public listing of Fonterra shares and retained 100% farmer control and ownership of the co-operative.

A key goal of the capital structure changes was to stop large amounts of money washing in and out of Fonterra&#x27;s balance sheet each year as milk production fluctuates. Under the previous structure, farmers matched their shareholding with their milk production by owning one co-operative share for each kilogram of milksolids (kgMS) produced annually. If their milk production dropped in any season, they could redeem shares back to the co-operative, which was required to buy the shares back off them. Consequently, Fonterra faced the risk of losing large amounts of share capital through redemptions during times of declining milk production. For instance, after milk production fell during the 2007/08 drought, Fonterra had to pay out $742 million of share capital to farmers via redemptions.

The capital structure changes also sought to provide greater incentives for farmers to increase their investment in Fonterra shares, helping ensure Fonterra has sufficient share capital to fund profitable business opportunities and drive a higher payout to dairy farmers.

The first two steps of capital structure change received good support from farmer shareholders at Fonterra&#x27;s annual meeting in November 2009. The first step allowed farmers to hold shares above their level of annual milk production; farmers could now own an additional 20% of &quot;dry&quot; shares (i.e. up to a maximum of 1.2 shares per kgMS). There were also enhanced incentives for farmers to hold shares even if their production falls. The rules about the pricing of end of season share transactions were also tidied up.

The second step changed the way Fonterra shares were valued to reflect that share ownership is restricted to farmers only. Previously, Fonterra shares were valued on a theoretical basis as if the shares were freely traded like a public share. An independent valuator subsequently assessed that the restricted market value should be at a 25% discount to the freely traded value.

The third step, titled &quot;Trading Among Farmers&quot;, involves more far-reaching change to Fonterra&#x27;s capital structure. The co-operative would no longer be obliged to issue or redeem shares at a price established via an independent valuation process. Instead, farmers would buy or sell shares among themselves at market prices through a farmer-only share trading market. This would have the effect of making Fonterra shares permanent capital, providing the co-operative with more confidence to invest in long-term projects without fear that some of its share capital might be needed to fund redemptions in future years.

As part of the changes, farmers would have greater flexibility with their Fonterra shareholding. The maximum shareholding would be 2 times production (up from the 1.2 times approved in step one) and farmers would have up to three years to comply with shareholding rules when entering/exiting the co-operative or increasing/decreasing their milk production.
Additionally, Fonterra would set up a special fund that would financially help farmers purchase shares (or retain shares they would otherwise have to sell). The fund would pay farmers for the right to receive dividends and the gain/loss from any changes in value of some of their shares, but the farmer would still be the owner of the shares. The fund would raise the money it needed to pay farmer shareholders by selling investment units to investors. Fonterra would require the fund to target &quot;friendly&quot; investors such as sharemilkers, retired farmers and offshore Fonterra suppliers, although the public and institutions would also be able to participate.

The &quot;Trading Among Farmers&quot; proposal went before a special meeting on 30 June 2010 and received 89% support from farmer shareholders voting, easily exceeding the 75% threshold required for a favourable vote.

In May 2021, Fonterra started a consultation process to seek farmer feedback on potential options to change its capital structure.

Based on farmer feedback over the consultation period as well as further expert advice, a proposal was put forward in September 2021 to move to a Flexible Shareholding structure, aimed at giving farmers more financial flexibility.

In December 2021, the new Flexible Shareholding structure received a strong mandate with [85.16%] of total farmer votes cast in support of the recommendation and [82.65%] participation based on milk solids voted. 

Fonterra is continuing to work with the Government on how the Flexible Shareholding structure can be given effect under the Dairy Industry Restructuring Act, the legislation that enabled the formation of Fonterra back in 2001.

===Initiatives===
Dairying stock entering waterways due to lack of fencing and poor use of fertilisers are major contributors to water pollution in New Zealand. Fonterra&#x27;s environmental policy states that &quot;Fonterra shall demonstrate a global commitment to protecting the environment. Sustainability, good environmental practice and environmental improvement are cornerstones of Fonterra&#x27;s environmental commitment.&quot; Fonterra claims to have a number of initiatives such as the Dairying and Clean Streams Accord, relating to environmental protection to achieve this policy. In December 2011, the Green Party questioned Fonterra&#x27;s credibility and the effectiveness of the self-auditing approach given the wide discrepancy between Fonterra&#x27;s claims and an independent audit of Dairying and Clean Streams Accord.

In 2003, Fonterra became a signatory to the Dairying and Clean Streams Accord, which sets a timeframe for the improvement of water quality on farms. Progress on the Accord goals is reported by the signatories in March of each year on the basis of data collected by Fonterra. The integrity of this data was later questioned when a 2012 independent report commissioned by MAF indicated that while Fonterra&#x27;s survey of farmers suggests that nationally 84% of properties have stock excluded from waterways, an independent audit by MAF revealed a position that only 42% of farms nationally had stock exclusion. The difference in Fonterra&#x27;s results against those in an independent audit suggest further work is required by Fonterra to protect streams and that evaluating success in this area may be better carried out by an independent third party auditor.

In July 2007, the Green Party called on Fonterra to use financial penalties on its suppliers who were &quot;dirty dairying&quot;, and to particularly penalise the &#x27;recidivist polluters&#x27; the Crafar Farms. In 2010, Fonterra launched its every farm every year initiative. Fonterra plans to check every farm&#x27;s effluent management infrastructure every year in a move to address non-compliance with regional council dairy effluent rules. The 2012 independent audit spurred further progress in this area with Fonterra announcing that suppliers will be required to complete fencing of Accord waterways by June 2013. Whether this will occur is yet to be seen.

In February 2008, the inaugural Fonterra Environmentalist of the Year was announced at the Beehive. The Award continues a partnership between Keep New Zealand Beautiful and Fonterra. Fonterra is also a Corporate Sponsor of the Society and each year teams of staff from the company&#x27;s manufacturing sites participate in the Keep New Zealand Beautiful Clean Up Week campaign, clearing rubbish from around roadsides, sports fields, parks and beaches. These activities have been criticised as token however as they have limited impacts on preventing stock from entering waterways and in assisting farmer to implement more effective fertiliser regimes that could cut farmers costs and improve water quality.

===Biofuels===
Fonterra is New Zealand&#x27;s largest producer of biofuel, processing a waste stream from casein manufacture into bio-ethanol. The company produces around 20 million litres of premium ethanol annually. Since 2004, Fonterra has produced ethanol from whey, a by-product of casein, in the Edgecumbe, Tirau and Reporoa plants. In 2008, Fonterra began supplying Gull Petroleum with ethanol from its Edgecumbe plant. The fuel has significant environmental benefits as it is renewable and biodegradable.

In July 2016, Fonterra announced that their tanker fleet was switching to ZBioD (Z Energy&#x27;s biodiesel fuel) as a foundation customer. Chief Operating Officer Global Operations, Robert Spurway said &quot;the move to biodiesel has the potential to reduce emissions for the tankers using it up to four per cent each year, and the partnership is an important milestone for Fonterra.&quot;

===Manawatu River waste water===
In 2006, Forest and Bird asked Fonterra to &#x27;clean up its act&#x27;, instead of obtaining consent to continue to discharge 8,500 cubic metres per day of wastewater into the Manawatu River.
Fonterra responded to Forest and Bird&#x27;s request, agreeing to treat wastewater it discharges into the Manawatu River, greatly reducing its impact on the river. Treatment will be phased in so that by 2015 the discharge will be treated to a level where the water will be fit to swim in year-round.

In 2010, Fonterra signed a voluntary agreement with local councils and freezing works to clean up the river. Fonterra has since encouraged its farmers to clean up their waste and plant trees alongside waterways.

===Deforestation allegations===
In August 2009, Greenpeace claimed that Fonterra was implicated in the destruction of Indonesian and Malaysian rainforests, causing deaths of orangutans and increased global greenhouse gas emissions. In response, Federated Farmers said the use of palm kernel does not cause the destruction of tropical forests as it is a waste by-product with almost no commercial value. A spokesperson John Hartnell stated that &quot;Not one millimetre of forest is being cleared just to feed dairy cows&quot;.

Fonterra says it shares community concern about tropical deforestation, &quot;which in some cases has been driven by the establishment of palm oil plantations&quot;. Fonterra says it has been proactive in ensuring a sustainable supply of palm kernel &quot;and ensuring we do not support deforestation, directly or indirectly.&quot;
Fonterra is a member of the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil to ensure it was informed or sustainability issues in South-East Asia and &quot;to actively contribute to more robust sustainability certification systems.&quot;

Fonterra was also the subject of Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand protests off the Port of Tauranga on 16 September 2009 and Port Taranaki on 5 February 2011, where Greenpeace activists invaded ships carrying palm kernel animal feed, destined for dairy farms.

Palm kernel imports went from 0.4 tonnes in 1999 to 455,000 tonnes in 2007 and then to 1.1 million tonnes in 2008, one quarter of the world&#x27;s palm-based animal feed. Greenpeace says that deforestation for the production of palm products is a significant cause of climate change, and loss of bio-diversity.

Greenpeace campaign director Chris Harris said only 4 per cent of palm oil came from sustainable sites. Greenpeace stated that forests were being cleared for the planting of the trees that produce palm oil.

In August 2016, Fonterra announced a new palm products sourcing standard that was developed in consultation with key supply partners, and following discussions with Greenpeace that began in December 2015. &quot;The new standard requires Fonterra to purchase on segregated supply palm oil by 2018, and to work with suppliers of palm products to ensure that plans are in place for full traceability to plantation by 2018&quot;, said Fonterra&#x27;s director of social responsibility, Carolyn Mortland.

===Lignite coal use protest===
On 17 November 2009, Greenpeace members protested at Solid Energy&#x27;s New Vale opencast lignite mine near Gore, New Zealand, by unfurling a 40 by 40-metre banner reading &#x27;Fonterra Climate Crime&#x27;. Greenpeace was protesting about Fonterra&#x27;s use of brown coal (lignite) at the nearby Edendale Fonterra plant. Greenpeace alleged that the Edendale plant will burn 179,000 tonnes of lignite, which will release over 250,000 tonnes of carbon emissions.

In response to the protest, Fonterra said, &quot;We use 13.9 percent less energy to produce each tonne of export product than we did in 2003. That&#x27;s equivalent to the energy required to power 100,000 homes and, relative to 2003, represents a 320,000 tonne reduction in CO2e greenhouse gas emissions in 2010.
We use the best mix of energy sources available to us at every one of our sites. We&#x27;re continually looking for ways to be more energy efficient.&quot;

In late 2018, Fonterra&#x27;s Brightwater milk-processing plant, in association with Azwood Energy, began burning wood biomass, alongside coal, to reduce carbon emissions. Fonterra&#x27;s Stirling milk-processing plant will run solely on electricity.

In February 2019, 350 Aotearoa, the New Zealand arm of the international climate movement 350.org, produced a video entitled, &quot;Coalterra, Dairy for Death&quot; critical of Fonterra&#x27;s coal use – estimated at half a million tonnes per year.

In July 2019, Fonterra announced it would install no new coal boilers. Coal Action Network Aotearoa welcomed the decision, but warned against utilising other fossil fuels, such as gas, in substitution, suggesting wood biomass, as a better alternative.

===Pollution prosecution===
In September 2010, Bay of Plenty Regional Council made a statement that it had prosecuted Fonterra for allowing nitric acid and a caustic cleaning agent from its Edgecumbe milk processing plant to spill into a storm water drain and into a water course. Fonterra was fined $24,000. &quot;The Dominion Post&quot; and &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported the prosecution.

Fonterra is currently educating its sites on the best way to reduce pollution.

===Environmental Awards===
In 2007, Fonterra won two awards in the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, Energywise Awards:

# Transpower Project Innovation Award; Winner: Fonterra Co-operative Group – Whareroa heat recovery loop
# Contact Energy Management Award; Winner: Fonterra Co-operative Group – Energy efficient project management team&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.eeca.govt.nz/node/1244&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Fonterra was also commended for its road to rail project by the EECA.

In 2008, Fonterra Edendale won the New Zealand Clean Air Society&#x27;s annual Clean Air award, which recognises exceptional contributions by individuals and businesses to researching and improving the environment.

In 2009, Fonterra won the supreme prize at the Packaging Council of New Zealand&#x27;s Environmental Packaging Awards for its introduction and promotion of a more environmentally sustainable packaging.

In 2016, Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) recognised Fonterra&#x27;s Edendale Site as the most energy efficient dairy manufacturing site in New Zealand.

In 2019, Fonterra business, NZAgbiz were awarded finalists in the &#x27;Going Circular&#x27; category.

In 2021, Fonterra received the Low Carbon Future Award for the conversion to renewable wood pallets at the Te Awamutu site. The Low Carbon Future Award recognises emission reduction initiative undertaken by the New Zealand energy sector.

In 2022, Fonerra&#x27;s NZMP Organic Butter – Carbonzero Certified won the &quot;Most Innovative Dairy Product Award&quot; at the Gulfood Innovation Awards.

In 2022, Fonterra&#x27;s Maungaturoto site was recognised at the Water New Zealand Excellence Award for the reduction of water usage by 25%.

===Sanlu milk scandal===
In September 2008, one of the biggest dairy companies in China, the Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group, 43% owned by Fonterra, recalled more than 10,000 tonnes of infant formula after a food safety scandal involving the criminal contamination of its raw milk supply with melamine. Court papers showed the company first began receiving complaints of children becoming sick after drinking its milk in December 2007, but only stopped production when Fonterra blew the whistle in September 2008. After the initial focus on Sanlu, China&#x27;s quality watchdog said that inspectors had also found the chemical melamine in baby formula produced by 22 companies nationwide. An estimated 300,000 Chinese babies were affected, and six died after developing kidney problems as a result of drinking formula containing melamine.

Fonterra first became aware of problems on 2 August 2008, when the Sanlu board, which had three Fonterra directors, was advised there was a problem with the contamination of infant formula. A trade recall began shortly after Fonterra was first notified. Prime Minister Helen Clark later said Fonterra had been lobbying for a public recall since 2 August, but that &quot;local authorities in China would not do it. At a local level ... I think the first inclination was to try and put a towel over it and deal with it without an official recall.&quot; Ms Clark said she first heard of the contamination on 5 September and three days later ordered that Beijing be told directly, bypassing local and provincial Chinese authorities.

On 21 September 2008, an editorial in &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; questioned the &quot;moral courage and leadership&quot; of Fonterra chief executive Andrew Ferrier. Citing Fonterra&#x27;s number one corporate value, the journal questioned why it took nearly a month after it had become aware of the contamination before it notified the government. It said Fonterra&#x27;s press release had been &quot;minutely scrutinised by lawyers and spin doctors, and that the company was far less interested in &#x27;moral courage and leadership&#x27; than it was in preserving its own position.&quot; The next day, Helen Clark, agreed that the company had been too slow to speak out. Ferrier was also condemned by Business Day for his &quot;silent hand-wringing&quot;, when he should have immediately blown the whistle. Ferrier denied Fonterra knew that Sanlu lied for eight months to hide complaints about its baby formula causing illness. However, Access Asia, a Shanghai-based consumer consultancy, said Fonterra was a classic example of western executives in China &quot;believ[ing] advice in business books that they must avoid making their local partners &#x27;lose face&#x27; at all costs.&quot; It suggested Fonterra paid a heavy price in write-offs, a wrecked business and public condemnation.

In a video press conference with reporters in September 2008, Ferrier said Sanlu&#x27;s milk supply may have been sabotaged. He added the company did not come forward with the information earlier because it was waiting for the recall process to move through the Chinese system.

David Oliver, a New Zealander who works as a corporate advisor to companies in the Chinese agricultural industry, feels that while Fonterra had board representation in Sanlu, it is unlikely they had much influence within the company as they had only a minority stake.

Ferrier said, &quot;I can look myself in the mirror and say Fonterra acted absolutely responsibly in this one. If you don&#x27;t follow the rules of an individual market place then I think you are getting irresponsible.&quot; Ferrier later said the feedback he received from both government and business contacts in China was that Fonterra was seen to have acted with integrity.

In September 2008, Henry van der Heyden, chairman of the board, said &quot;As a direct consequence of the criminal contamination of milk in China, Fonterra has recognised an impairment charge of $139 million against the carrying value of its investment in SanLu.&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ve learnt an incredibly painful lesson through this and we will be much, much more suspicious worldwide on ensuring the safety and integrity of our supply chain everywhere in the world&quot;, said Ferrier. But he also pointed out that the company can never be 100% certain against a criminal contamination of the supply chain, which is what happened in this incident.

On 17 September 2008, Fran O&#x27;Sullivan noted that Fonterra had already set &quot;up a 3000-head dairy farm in China itself to provide quality product and demonstrate best practice.&quot;

On 10 October 2008, Ferrier announced in Beijing that Fonterra will &quot;donate NZ$8.4 million to the Soong Ching Ling Foundation over five years for a co-operative charity project to provide medical care and advice to pregnant women and the mothers of infants in rural communities.&quot; Andrew Ferrier said Fonterra was &quot;shocked by the degree of tragedy&quot; and the donated fund is set up to &quot;help over the long-term in infants and maternal mother health.&quot; Andrew Ferrier said Chinese consumers have lost confidence in Sanlu, not Fonterra, and Fonterra is working towards rebuilding a safe supply chain of dairy products.

In April 2009, during a state visit by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to Beijing, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao asked Prime Minister Key for help in developing food safety standards for China. Mr Key said the Chinese Premier considers 2008&#x27;s contaminated milk scandal a one-off incident that can be put behind both countries. A report by Fran O&#x27;Sullivan in the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; said that Fonterra had learnt some heavy lessons from Sanlu and the company would have to have confidence in the safety of its milk supply chain in China before reinvesting significantly in the local production of dairy products.

On 24 November 2009 two Sanlu former workers Zhang Yujun and Geng Jinping were executed.

===DCD contamination===
In September 2012, traces of 2-Cyanoguanidine, a fertiliser commonly referred to as DCD that is used to slow down nitrate leaching, was found in some milk samples. Fonterra, Federated Farmers and the Government moved quickly to reassure the public and overseas buyers there was no risk to health. Fonterra has received praise for its handling of the DCD issue. The levels were very low and attempts were made to prevent the test results from being reported in the media.

On 16 August 2013 a Sri Lankan court banned the sale and advertising of all Fonterra products in Sri Lanka. The health ministry has said tests by Sri Lanka&#x27;s Industrial Technology Institute found DCD in some Fonterra powdered milks and it had ordered their recall.

=== Botulism scare ===
On 3 August 2013, authorities in New Zealand announced a global recall of up to 1,000 tonnes of dairy products after tests identified a type of bacteria that could cause botulism. Products included were infant formula, sports drinks, protein drinks and other beverages. The countries affected were New Zealand, China, Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia.

Fonterra&#x27;s head of its milk products business, Gary Romano, resigned over the scandal on 14 August 2013.

In late August 2013 laboratory test results revealed that the bacteria found in the whey protein concentrate manufactured by Fonterra was not the botulism-causing &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;.

==Legal issues==
===Court case of Fonterra vs Bega Cheese===
Fonterra marketed and distributed the Bega Cheese brand, under an agreement established between the two companies in 1999. Fonterra later raised the issue of Bega otherwise using the Bega brand to market peanut butter. Bega themselves have since challenged this, accusing Fonterra of not living up to the agreement by not promoting the brand and therefore devaluing it. This case ended on 25 February 2021, when the Victoria Supreme Court dismissed all claims. Bega is allowed to continue to sell market peanut butter, but the court found Fonterra had no obligation to promote the brand as Bega claimed.

=== Greenpeace ===
In September 2024, Greenpeace announced they were suing Fonterra for breaching the Fair Trading Act. Greenpeace claimed that the Fonterra marketing of milk from &quot;100% New Zealand grass-fed&quot; cows was misleading when up to a fifth of an animal&#x27;s diet might be imported palm kernel. Palm kernel is considered to be linked to deforestation, and New Zealand imports two million tonnes of it annually.

<doc id="597652" wikidata="Q2145607" url="?curid=597652" title="Victorio Edades">
<text>Victorio Candido Edades (December 23, 1895 – March 7, 1985) was a Filipino painter. He led the revolutionary Thirteen Moderns, who engaged their classical compatriots in heated debate over the nature and function of art. He was named a National Artist in 1976. The history names Victorio Edades as “the father of Modern Philippine art&quot;. Schooled in the US upon his return he introduced an entirely new way of thinking about art. He argued that art can be more than representation of reality, it can be representation of reality as seen through the mind and emotions of the artist.

==Biography==
Victorio Edades was born on December 23, 1895, to Hilario and Cecilia Edades. He was the youngest of ten children (six of whom died of smallpox). He grew up in Barrio Bolosan in Dagupan, Pangasinan. His artistic ability surfaced during his early years. By seventh grade, his teachers were so impressed with him that he was dubbed &quot;apprentice teacher&quot; in his art class. He was also an achiever from the very beginning, having won awards in school debates and writing competitions.

==Later career==
After high school, Edades and his friends traveled to the United States. Before enrolling in Seattle, Edades incidentally made a detour to Alaska and experienced working in a couple of factories. Nonetheless, he moved on to Seattle and enrolled at the University of Washington where he took up architecture and later earned a Master of Fine Arts in Painting. The significant event that stirred Edades, and made him as what he is known now, was his encounter with the traveling exhibition from the New York Armory Hall. This art show presented modern European artists such as Cézanne, Gauguin, Matisse, Picasso and the Surrealists. His growing appreciation to what he saw veered him away from the conservative academic art and Realistic schools and thus he began to paint in the modern manner. The two former schools of thought were inclined more towards idyllic subject matter, and require a mastery of refined detailing. What attracted Edades to the modernist movement was its principle to go beyond the idealistic exteriors propagated by Impressionism and Realism. Modernist thought encourages experimentation in artistic expression and allows the artist to present reality as he sees it in his own way.

During his journey to America, he participated in art competitions, one of which was the Annual Exhibition of North American Artists. His entry The Sketch (1927) won second prize. 
When he returned to the Philippines in 1928, he saw that the state of art was &quot;practically dead.&quot; Paintings he saw dealt with similar themes and were done in a limited technique that mostly followed the works of Fernando Amorsolo, the first Philippine national artist and the most popular painter of the time. He recognized that there was no creativity whatsoever, and that the artists of that time were merely &quot;copying&quot; each other. So in December, Edades bravely mounted a one-man show at the Philippine Columbia Club in Ermita to introduce to the masses what his modern art was all about. He showed thirty paintings, including those that won acclaim in America. It was a distinguished exhibit, for the Filipino art circle was suddenly shaken by what this young man from Pangasinan had learned from his studies abroad. Viewers and critics were apparently shocked and not one painting was sold.

Edades helped organized the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Department of Architecture in 1930 and was its acting head. In 1935, he was appointed as Director of the UST College of Architecture and Fine Arts, which he organized under the wing of Architecture. He was guided by the existing American curricula when he made the Fi Painting. On February 12, 1977, UST conferred on Edades the degree of Doctor of Fine Arts, Honoris Causa.

==Retirement==
Edades retired to Davao City with his family. There he taught for a time at the Philippine Women&#x27;s College and resumed his career as an artist.

==Death==
He died on March 7, 1985, in Davao City, Philippines.

==Artistic development==

Early styles after his stint in architecture already show his inclination towards the impressionism technique. In The Market and The Picnic, his choice of subject matter do not take flight from pleasant daily scenery; yet his brush strokes and observance of non-proportionality in the figures made his teachers consider him &quot;very ambitious.&quot; His earlier works already showed his affinity towards the style of Cézanne and other Post-Impressionists.

The height of his artistic development is his dynamic entry into Philippine art in 1928 with his solo exhibit at the Philippine Columbia Club. Here he mounted his most renowned work, The Builders. This work is the sum total of all the other pieces included in the show. They are a far cry from the works of the first Philippine national artist and most popular painter Fernando Amorsolo and the other classicists who painted bright cheery scenes of flawless Filipinos and their idealized daily routines. Edades, on the other hand, presented figures in muddy earth colors – yellow ochres and raw sienna accented by bold black contours. Subjects are distorted figures (those whose proportions defy classical measure), and Edades’ brush strokes are agitated and harsh. The choice of his subject also caused quite a stir to those who viewed the show. He portrayed tough, dirty construction laborers and simple folk wrestling in dung and dust. Even his nudes are nothing like Amorsolo&#x27;s portrayal of the Filipina at her best.

With the uproar Edades&#x27; ideas raised, he knew that he cannot make a living out by merely painting what he wished. So he got by producing commissioned works, particularly murals. He did murals for prominent individuals (like Juan Nakpil) and institutions.
His later works are said to be ‘flatter.’ His portraits and genre paintings in Davao are not seen to be as heavy or solid as his earlier phase with The Builders. From Cézanne, Edades grew more interested in the style of Utamaro of Japan and other artists whose charm is in color rather than solidity.

By introducing modern ideas into the Philippine art scene, Victorio Edades managed to destroy the conventions of domestic art, and also got rid of the clichéd ideology he believed stunted the development of Philippine art. His defiance to what the Conservatives structured as ‘art’ was a conscious call for real artistic expression. He attested that &quot;art is ever the expression of man&#x27;s emotion, and not a mere photographic likeness of nature. Thus to express his individual emotion, the artist is privileged to create in that distinctive form that best interprets his own experience. And the distortion of plastic elements of art such as line, mass and color – is one of the many ways of expressing one&#x27;s rhythmic form.&quot; That was the reason why his disproportionate figures are made that way – for the sake of composition.

==Legacy==
Through his continuous propagation of modern art as shown in his works and teachings, Edades proved that modernists were not fooling people as Guillermo Tolentino asserted. Dialectically, Edades explained that modern art is not anti-classicist. He said, &quot;From the technical point of view, Modern Art is an outgrowth of Classical Art. Modern Art is the interpretation of the Classical concept conditioned by the artist&#x27;s new experience with the aid of improved means of aesthetic expression.&quot; Not conforming to the academic perception of art, he made art available to the ordinary person. Through his determination to stand by his ideology, Edades became a bridge between the past and the present.

=== Auction records ===
For the longest period, the works of Edades despite his role in the development of Philippine modernism have only become prominent in the Philippine art market during the 2010s. In the same period, works by other Philippine modernists Anita Magsaysay-Ho, José T. Joya and Hernando R. Ocampo have already broken world record prices at auction.

On November 22, 2014, an early work from 1926 called &quot;American Football Player&quot; sold for a record price of PHP9.276 million (US$205,923.65) at a Christie&#x27;s auction in Hong Kong. That record was broken on June 11, 2022, when a later work from 1976 called &quot;Poinsettia Girl&quot; was sold at a León Gallery auction in Manila for a world record price of PHP23.230 million (US$440,257.98).

<doc id="597654" wikidata="Q131304" url="?curid=597654" title="Canellaceae">
<text>The Canellaceae are a family of flowering plants in the order Canellales. The order includes only one other family, the Winteraceae. Canellaceae is native to the Afrotropical and Neotropical realms. They are small to medium trees, rarely shrubs, evergreen and aromatic. The flowers and fruit are often red.

Several species of Canellaceae are important in herbal medicine or as a substitute for cinnamon, which is obtained from genus &quot;Cinnamomum&quot; in family Lauraceae. &quot;Canella winterana&quot; is the only species known in cultivation.

The family is divided into five genera, but studies of DNA sequences have indicated one of these genera should be split. These genera together comprise about 25 species. In the Greater Antilles, many of these species are rare and restricted to small ranges. As of 2008, five of the species were newly recognized and not yet named.

== Description ==
Some common properties include:

* These trees, rarely shrubs, are evergreen and glabrous.
* The stems have nodes with three (rarely two) leaf gaps and three leaf traces. The xylem has narrow rays. The bark is aromatic, with prominent and unusual appearing lenticels.
* The leaves have a peppery taste, are alternate, spiral, or distichous in arrangement, simple, entire, coriaceous, petiolate, pinnately nerved, without stipules, with translucent (pellucid) glands. The parenchyma is without palisade layer in &quot;Pleodendron&quot; and &quot;Canella&quot;. The stomata are paracytic in American genera, and anomocytic in the Old World.
* The inflorescences are terminal or axillary, in a panicle (&quot;Canella&quot;) or a raceme; otherwise, the flowers are solitary (by reduction) and axillary.
* The flowers are actinomorphic, hypogynous, and usually trimerous. The receptacles are barely excavated, and the hypogynous disc is absent.
* The three (rarely 2) sepals are thick, coriaceous, and imbricate.
* The petals number (4-)5-12, in 1-2 (-4) unlike whorls or spirally arranged, slender, imbricate in bud, usually free (connate at the base in &quot;Canella&quot; and halfway to the apex in &quot;Cinnamosma&quot;).
* The androecium is monadelphous, adnate to the ovary. Stamens number 6-12, apparently derived from the fusion of two whorls in &quot;Warburgia&quot; and &quot;Canella&quot;. Anthers are extrorse and bithecal, with two sporangia per theca, attached to the outside of the staminal tube, and sessile; dehiscence is by a longitudinal slit, connective not projecting beyond thecae or only slightly so.
* The gynoecium is syncarpous. The ovary has two to six carpels, unilocular and superior. The style is short and thick; the stigma is apical and capitate, with two to six lobes. Placentation is parietal. Ovules number from two to many in one or two rows on each of the two to six placentas; they are hemianatropous to campylotropous, bitegmic, and crassinucellate.
* The fruit is a berry with a persistent calyx, with two or more seeds. &quot;Cinnamosma macrocarpa&quot;, in the Madagascan genus &quot;Cinnamosma&quot;, has the largest fruit in the family, sometimes reaching by .
* Seeds have exotestae (the outer layer of the testa) only; the tegmen (the inner layer of the testa) is collapsed. The seed coat has oily idioblasts; the endosperm is abundant and oily (ruminate in &quot;Cinnamosma&quot;). The embryo is small and straight to slightly curved, with two cotyledons.
* Pollen occurs in monads, and is delicate and monosulcate (usually with 10% of the grain trichotomosulcate); apertures are distal, exine, generally tectate, and granular, intectate, and reticulate in &quot;Cinnamosma&quot;; grains are small and hardly ornamented in &quot;Cinnamodendron&quot; and &quot;Warburgia&quot;, largest and most highly decorated in &quot;Canella&quot; and &quot;Pleodendron&quot;. The pollen is generally similar to that of the Myristicaceae, which had at one time caused some systematists to believe the two families were closely related.
* The chromosome number &quot;2n&quot; is 22, 26, or 28.

Synapomorphies for Canellaceae include monadelphous stamens, parietal placentation, and campylotropous ovules.

Other notable traits include the conspicuous lenticels, the aromatic bark, the peppery taste of the leaves, the three (rarely two) fleshy sepals, and the berry with reniform seeds.

Some sources indicate &quot;Cinnamodendron&quot; has 20-40 stamens, contrary to the sources that are regarded here as reliable. The very large stamen numbers (20 to 40), are probably counts of thecae or microsporangia.

== Ecology ==
Canellaceae has species in both xeric and wet forests.

In &quot;Canella winterana&quot;, the flowers are protogynous. The berries are usually red, and probably eaten by birds, which contribute to seed dispersal (ornithochory). The trees are attacked by larvae of different insects, including dipterans.

== Phytochemistry ==

Monoterpenes are common, as are drimane-type sesquiterpenes, including cinnafragrins, cinnamodial, and capsicodendrin. These three sesquiterpenes are shared with only the Winteraceae in angiosperms. Canellaceae also have alkaloids of the aporphine type, such as N-(cinnamoyl)-tryptamine, lignans of the aryl-tetralin type, cinnamaldehydes, and allylphenols. Crystals of calcium oxalate are in the leaf mesophyll. Most species are cyanogenetic. Protocyanidins, flavonols, saponins, sapogenins, and ellagic acid are absent.

== Uses ==
The saro, or green sandalwood, (also known locally as &quot;mandravasarotra&quot;), &quot;Cinnamosma fragrans&quot;, is native to Madagascar and is exported from there to India to be burned in ceremonies. It is not related to the true sandalwoods, which are in the family Santalaceae.

Most species of Canellaceae produce bark that is similar in odor and flavor to cinnamon, but they are closer related to the family Piperaceae including black pepper (&quot;Piper nigrum&quot;) than to true cinnamons, which are in the family Lauraceae (still within Magnoliids).

The white cinnamon, &quot;Canella winterana&quot;, a native of Florida and the Antilles, is used as a condiment, with tonic properties.

Commercial production of &quot;white cinnamon&quot; from &quot;C. winterana&quot; has ceased, but small-scale, local production continues. The Canellaceae have long had local use as aromatic plants and as herbal medicines.

The bark of the red cinnamon or false Winter&#x27;s bark, &quot;Cinnamodendron corticosum&quot;, is used as a substitute for Winter&#x27;s bark (&quot;Drimys winteri&quot;, a member of Winteraceae) in Chile and Argentina, where it is called &quot;canelo&quot;, a name that is also applied to cinnamon. In Africa, several species of &quot;Warburgia&quot; have medicinal uses. The barks of &quot;Warburgia salutaris&quot; and &quot;Warburgia ugandensis&quot; are used to treat fevers, colds, and malaria. Other species are used for timber or in the production of resins used as glue.

== Fossils ==
Fossil leaves of &quot;Canella&quot; are known from the Pliocene of Bahia (Brazil). Pollen of &quot;Pleodendron&quot; is known from the Oligocene of Puerto Rico.

== Systematic position ==
Depending on the classification system and the characters considered, Canellaceae has been placed close to Annonaceae, Myristicaceae or Winteraceae. In his last book, Armen Takhtajan defined the order Canellales as consisting of Canellaceae and Winteraceae. This circumscription is followed in the APG IV system, in which the order Canellales is sister to another small order, the Piperales. These two orders combined with another two sister-orders Laurales and Magnoliales form together the clade Magnoliids.

== Included taxa ==
: &quot;Theoretical introduction to Taxonomy&quot;

In this article, the genus &quot;Capsicodendron&quot; is maintained in synonymy with &quot;Cinnamodendron&quot;, although preliminary molecular phylogenetic studies separate &quot;Capsicodendron&quot; from &quot;Cinnamodendron&quot; and place &quot;Capsicodendron&quot; closer to &quot;Cinnamosma&quot; and &quot;Warburgia&quot; than to &quot;Cinnamodendron&quot;. This placement is not corroborated by morphology. The currently recognized genera in Canellaeae can be distinguished as follows:

* Petals fused into a tube to the middle of their length
: &quot;Cinnamosma&quot; Baill., 1867, Madagascar
* Petals free or slightly connate at the base
: * Petals 5, slightly connate at the base, inflorescence a terminal panicle
:: &quot;Canella&quot; P. Browne, 1757, Florida, Antilles, northern South America
: * Petals 6-12, free, flowers solitary, terminal or axillary, or in axillary inflorescences
:: * Petals 12, in 3-4 whorls, stamens 12, carpels 6
::: &quot;Pleodendron&quot; Tiegh., 1899, Greater Antilles, Costa Rica

== History ==
&quot;Canella winterana&quot; was an important medicinal plant of the natives of the American tropics, and it was soon adopted as such by the Europeans, as well. Dr. Diego Álvarez Chanca accompanied Christopher Columbus on his second voyage, after which he wrote of a cinnamon (&quot;canela&quot; in Spanish) which was unlike any of the species of cinnamon used in Europe. He had probably reported the use of &quot;C. winterana&quot;.

In 1737, in his &quot;Hortus Cliffortianus&quot;, Linnaeus combined &quot;Canella&quot; with &quot;Drimys&quot;, a genus now in Winteraceae, and &quot;Cinnamomum&quot;, now in &quot;Lauraceae&quot;, to form a taxon which he called &quot;Winterania&quot;. In 1753, in the first edition of &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;, Linnaeus divided &quot;Winterania&quot; into four species. Three of these are now in &quot;Cinnamomum&quot;, and the fourth, which he called &quot;Laurus winterana&quot;, consisted of what are now &quot;Canella winterana&quot; and &quot;Drimys winteri&quot;. These four species were included in a broadly defined &quot;Laurus&quot;.

In 1756, Patrick Browne applied the name &quot;Canella&quot; to the species now known as &quot;Canella winterana&quot;. He did not add a specific epithet to create a binomial. The generic name is derived from &quot;canela&quot;, the Spanish word for cinnamon, but the Spanish word is derived from the Latin &quot;canna&quot;, meaning &quot;a reed&quot;, or from the related Greek &quot;kanna&quot;, which refers to a piece of rolled bark.

The genus &quot;Canella&quot; was not adopted by Linnaeus, who resurrected &quot;Winterania&quot; in the second edition of &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1762. He assigned to&quot; Winterania&quot; a single species, &quot;Winterania canella&quot;, which was equivalent to the species he had previously called &quot;Laurus winterana&quot;.

In 1784, Johan Andreas Murray divided &quot;Winterania&quot; into two monospecific genera, the constituent species of which were &quot;Canella alba&quot; and &quot;Wintera aromatica&quot;. The name &quot;Canella alba&quot; was validated by Murray in 1784, but it had long been in use. Linnaeus attributed the name to Samuel Dale, who used it in his &quot;Pharmacologia&quot;, the first edition of which was published in 1693. Patrick Browne mentions its use by Mark Catesby. &quot;Canella alba&quot; was renamed as &quot;Canella winterana&quot; by Joseph Gaertner in 1788 in his classic work &quot;De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum&quot; (&quot;The Fruits and Seeds of Plants&quot;). The name change was required by the rules of botanical nomenclature. &quot;Wintera aromatica&quot; is now known as &quot;Drimys winteri&quot; and is in the family Winteraceae.

The family Canellaceae was established by Carl von Martius in 1832 and was defined as consisting of only the genus &quot;Canella&quot;. Stephan Endlicher divided &quot;Canella&quot; in 1840, creating the new genus &quot;Cinnamodendron&quot;. &quot;Cinnamosma&quot; was erected in 1867, &quot;Warburgia&quot; in 1895, and &quot;Pleodendron&quot; in 1899. &quot;Capsicodendron&quot; was erected in 1933. Some authors accept &quot;Capsicodendron&quot; and assign to it two species, &quot;Capsicodendron pimenteira&quot; and &quot;Capsicodendron dinisii&quot;. Other authors subsume &quot;Capsicodendron&quot; into &quot;Cinnamodendron&quot; and &quot;C. pimenteira&quot; into &quot;C. dinisii&quot;.

Molecular phylogenetic studies of DNA sequences have shown &quot;Cinnamodendron&quot;, as traditionally circumscribed, is polyphyletic, consisting of two distinct groups. These groups are morphologically different and their ranges do not overlap.

One of these groups is related to the African genera &quot;Cinnamosma&quot; and &quot;Warburgia&quot;, and might be paraphyletic over them. It consists of eight species, one of which was named in 2005. Two other species in this group have not been formally named and described in the scientific literature. This group is restricted to South America. Since it includes the type species, &quot;Cinnamodendron axillare&quot;, it will retain the name &quot;Cinnamodendron&quot;.

The other group of &quot;Cinnamodendron&quot; species is most closely related to &quot;Pleodendron&quot; and is restricted to the Greater Antilles. It consists of six species, two of which remain unnamed. The name &quot;Antillodendron&quot; has been proposed for this group, but this name is considered by some to be invalid because it was not effectively published.

<text>The Jacobin cuckoo (Clamator jacobinus), also pied cuckoo or pied crested cuckoo, is a member of the cuckoo order of birds that is found in Africa and Asia. It is partially migratory and in India, it has been considered a harbinger of the monsoon rains due to the timing of its arrival. It has been associated with a bird in Indian mythology and poetry, known as the &quot;chātaka&quot; (Sanskrit: चातक) represented as a bird with a beak on its head that waits for rains to quench its thirst.

==Taxonomy==
The Jacobin cuckoo was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; in 1780. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot;. This was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Cuculus jacobinus&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The type locality is the Coromandel Coast of southeast India.

The current genus &quot;Clamator&quot; was erected by German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829 with the great spotted cuckoo (&quot;Clamator glandarius&quot;) as the type species. The name is the Latin word for &quot;shouter&quot; from &quot;clamare&quot;, &quot;to shout&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;jacobinus&quot; and the English name Jacobin refer to the pied plumage which resembles the black and white garments of monks belonging to the Dominican Order. In France Dominicans were known as &quot;Jacobins&quot;.

The three subspecies with their breeding ranges are:
* &quot;C. j. serratus&quot; (Sparrman, 1786) – South Africa, southern Zambia
* &quot;C. j. pica&quot; (Hemprich &amp; Ehrenberg, 1833) – Africa south of the Sahara to north Zambia and Malawi, northwest India to Nepal and Myanmar
* &quot;C. j. jacobinus&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – south India, Sri Lanka, south Myanmar

==Description==
This medium-sized, slim black and white cuckoo with a crest is distinctive. The white wing patch on the black wing and the pattern make it unmistakable even in flight. They are very vocal during the breeding season. The call is a ringing series of whistling notes &quot;piu-piu&quot; with the calls of the nominate form more rapid and slightly Mellower.

In India the subspecies &quot;serratus&quot; (Sparrman, 1786) is a summer breeding visitor to northern India and is believed to migrate to southern Africa. This is larger and longer winged than the nominate subspecies found in the southern peninsular region and Sri Lanka is said to be a local migrant. No ringing evidence exists to support the actual migration to Africa.

In Africa, subspecies &quot;serratus&quot; and &quot;pica&quot; (Hemprich &amp; Ehrenberg, 1833) show two phases, a pied phase with white or whitish below and a black phase where the only white is on the wing patch. Mating appears to be assortative, with pied phase males pairing with pied phase females. An all-rufous color phase has been noted in Central Africa. There is lack of clarity on the migration and plumage variation involved. Subspecies &quot;pica&quot; has been said to be the form that migrates between Africa and India however Rasmussen &amp; Anderton (2005) suggest &quot;serratus&quot; as being the valid name for the Afro-Indian migrants.

In the past some other African subspecies have been suggested such as &quot;hypopinarus&quot; from South Africa and &quot;caroli&quot; from the Gabon.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is distributed south of the Sahara in Africa and south of the Himalayas in India. Also found in Sri Lanka and parts of Myanmar. Within Africa, there are movements of the species although they are resident in tropical Africa. The east African population is migratory and moves over southern Arabia into India during April.
The habitat of the species is mainly in thorny, dry scrub or open woodland avoiding areas of dense forest or extremely dry environments.

==Behaviour and ecology==

In the breeding season, birds call from prominent perches and chase each other with slow wing-beats and pigeon like clapping flight. Courtship feeding has been observed in Africa. The species is a brood parasite and in India the host is mainly species of babblers in the genus &quot;Turdoides&quot;. The colour of the eggs matches those of the host, typically turquoise blue. The eggs are slightly larger than those of the common babbler (&quot;T. caudatus&quot;) or the jungle babbler (&quot;T. striata&quot;). Other hosts include the red-vented bulbul, and the eggs laid are then mostly white. Eggs are laid hurriedly in the morning into the nest of the host often dropped from above while the bird perches on the rim of the nest and over the host eggs often resulting in the cracking of one or more host eggs. In Africa, the males distract the host while the female lays the egg. Multiple eggs may be laid in the nest of a host and two young cuckoos were found to fledge successfully in several occasions. In Africa, the hosts include &quot;Pycnonotus barbatus&quot;, &quot;P. capensis&quot;, &quot;Turdoides fulvus&quot;, &quot;Turdoides rubiginosus&quot;, &quot;Lanius collaris&quot;, &quot;Andropadus importunus&quot;, &quot;Terpsiphone viridis&quot;, &quot;Dicrurus adsimilis&quot; and a few other species. Babblers in the genus &quot;Turdoides&quot; are communal breeders and cuckoo chick are raised by several members of the group. A pied cuckoo chick was observed to be fed by four jungle babblers.

The skin of young birds darkens form pink to purplish brown within two days of hatching. The mouth linking is red with yellow gape flanges. Unlike some cuckoos, nestlings do not evict the eggs of the host from the nest although they claim most of the parental attention and food resulting sometimes, in the starvation of host nestlings.

These cuckoos feed on insects including hairy caterpillars that are picked up from near or on the ground. Caterpillars are pressed from end to end to remove the guts before they are swallowed. They sometimes feed on fruits.

Jacobin cuckoos are occasionally targeted as prey by the sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;), which has been recorded attacking the significantly larger cuckoo by forcing it to the ground with its talons, then ripping away with its hooked beak.

==In culture==
This species is widely mentioned in ancient Indian poetry as the &quot;chātaka&quot;. According to Indian mythology it has a beak atop its head and it thirsts for the rains. The poet Kalidasa used it in his &quot;Meghadoota&quot; as a metaphor for deep yearning and this tradition continues in literary works. Satya Churn Law, however noted that in Bengal, the bird associated with the &quot;chataka&quot; of Sanskrit was the common iora unlike the Jacobin cuckoo suggested by European orientalists. He further noted that a captive iora that he kept drank water only from dew and spray picked up from plant leaves suggesting that it may have been the basis for the idea that the &quot;chatak&quot; only drank raindrops. To compound the issues with matching vernacular names, it has been pointed out that in Bengal &quot;chātak&quot; also refers to skylarks (which are also crested).

It is also mentioned in the poem &#x27;Are ghaas ki roti&#x27; where it is said that if Maharana Pratap was to surrender to Akbar, a dystopian future will ensue where the chātak will drink water from the ground.

<text>T. V. Sankaranarayanan, (7 March 1945 – 2 September 2022) was an Indian Carnatic vocalist (South Indian classical singer), known for his music that stems from the style of his guru and maternal-uncle, Madurai Mani Iyer. TVS was awarded the Madras Music Academy&#x27;s Sangeetha Kalanidhi in 2003.

Sankaranarayanan was particularly noted for easily reaching the upper notes.

Some of his musical disciples include R. Suryaprakash, his daughter Amruta Sankaranarayanan and his son Mahadevan Sankaranarayanan.

==Early life and career==

Sankaranarayanan was born in Mayiladuturai of Thanjavur district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. His father, Vembu Iyer, was a disciple of vocalist Madurai Mani Iyer; his mother was Mani Iyer&#x27;s sister. At age nine, Sankaranarayanan started learning music from his uncle (maamaa). Sankaranarayanan also learned from his father.

He made his debut on the concert platform in 1968 and then gradually established himself as a Carnatic vocalist. He has performed in India and abroad and has several albums. In a profile published in the Financial Express, Subbudu, a music critic, once wrote: &quot;Sankaranarayanan is indeed an asset to the Carnatic music world, where the tribe of good vocalists is dwindling.&quot;

<doc id="597668" wikidata="Q4809460" url="?curid=597668" title="Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women championships">
<text>The [[AIAW|Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]] was founded in 1971 to govern collegiate women&#x27;s athletics and to administer national championships. During its existence, the AIAW and its predecessor, the Division for Girls&#x27; and Women&#x27;s Sports (DGWS), recognized via these championships the teams and individuals who excelled at the highest level of women&#x27;s collegiate competition.

After the 1981–82 academic year, the AIAW discontinued sponsorship of national championships and later was legally dissolved. At this time, the NCAA assumed sole sanctioning authority of its member schools&#x27; women&#x27;s sports programs.

==Governing bodies of women&#x27;s collegiate athletics through 1982==

The Division of Girls and Women&#x27;s Sports (DGWS), a division of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education and Recreation (AAHPER), was the first nationally recognized collegiate organization for women&#x27;s athletics and the forerunner of the AIAW. The Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (CIAW) operated under the auspices of the DGWS. The CIAW governed from 1966 until February, 1972, and conducted championships in eight sports.

During the 1972–73 season, the first full academic year of its operation, the AIAW offered its first eight national championships in the same eight sports (badminton, basketball, golf, gymnastics, softball, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field, and volleyball).

In years when small-college championships (Division II or III) were not contested, and in sports without divisions, there was open competition among eligible teams.

Except as noted below, the NCAA sponsored its first women&#x27;s championship in each sport in the 1981–82 academic year. Individual athletic programs and, in some cases, individual teams within a program were permitted to choose to participate in either the AIAW or NCAA competitions (or both in a few instances). The NCAA has never sponsored championship competition in badminton, synchronized swimming, or slow-pitch softball.

In the sports of fencing, lacrosse, rowing and tennis, for completeness, the champions listed below include those bestowed by each sport&#x27;s governing body prior to the beginning of AIAW championships in those sports.

Compilations of collegiate records by the NCAA, continuing into 2006, have ignored or segregated the contributions of AIAW athletes. Major college basketball&#x27;s career women&#x27;s scoring leader, Lynette Woodard of the University of Kansas, speaking on the exclusion of AIAW statistics, said, &quot;Basketball doesn&#x27;t just start with when the NCAA blessed it. And it&#x27;s not about Jackie [Stiles, NCAA career scoring leader] and it&#x27;s not about Lynette. It&#x27;s about history. History is history.&quot;

Only AIAW championship was in 1982. The National Women&#x27;s Rowing Association (NWRA) sponsored an annual open eights national championship from 1971 to 1979, among college and non-college teams. (There were no eights prior to 1971.) During this period, only in 1973 and 1975 did a college team win the national eights championship outright. According to USRowing, contemporary news reports in 1976 and 1977 do not mention a national collegiate title. Beginning in 1980, the NWRA sponsored the Women&#x27;s Collegiate National Championship in varsity eights.

<text>Tomb of Horrors is an adventure module written by Gary Gygax for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) role-playing game. It was originally written for and used at the 1975 Origins 1 convention. Gygax designed the adventure both to challenge the skill of expert players in his own campaign and to test players who boasted of having mighty player characters able to best any challenge. The module, coded S1, was the first in the S-series, or &quot;special&quot; series of modules. Several versions of the adventure have been published, the first in 1978, and the most recent, for the fifth edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, in 2017 as one of the included adventures in &quot;Tales from the Yawning Portal&quot;. The module also served as the basis for a novel published in 2002.

The module&#x27;s plot revolves around the tomb of the demilich Acererak. The player characters must battle their way past a variety of monsters and traps, with the ultimate goal of destroying Acererak. &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; was considered the third greatest &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventure of all time by the staff of &quot;Dungeon&quot; in 2004. The module has influenced later &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; products, and was followed by three other (unrelated) modules in the S-series: S2 &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot;, S3 &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot;, and S4 &quot;The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth&quot;.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; takes place in the &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot;, a &quot;D&amp;D&quot; campaign setting. In &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot;, the player characters encounter many perilous tricks and traps while trying to get into the crypt of a wizard. As the scenario begins, the players are told that the evil wizard Acererak is said to linger in his ancient tomb in undead form. Originally a powerful lich, he has (unbeknownst to the players) become a demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body apart from its skull. Player characters must survive the deadly traps in the tomb and fight their way into the demi-lich&#x27;s elaborately concealed inner sanctum to destroy him.

The module is divided into thirty-three encounters, beginning with two false entrances to the tomb, and ending with &quot;The Crypt of Acererak the Demi-Lich&quot;. Example encounters are the &quot;Huge Pit Filled with 200 Spikes&quot; (section 20), or encounter 22, &quot;The Cavern of Gold and Silver Mists&quot;: &quot;The mists are silvery and shot through with delicate streamers of golden color. Vision extends only 6&#x27;. There is a dim aura of good if detected for. Those who step into the mist must save versus poison or become idiots until they can breathe the clean air above ground under the warm sun.&quot; The module ends with the destruction of Acererak without any postscript.

==Publication history==

&quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; was written by Gary Gygax for official &quot;D&amp;D&quot; tournament play at the 1975 Origins 1 convention. Gygax developed the adventure from an idea by Alan Lucien, one of his original &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) playtesters, &quot;and I admit to chuckling evilly as I did so.&quot; Gygax designed the &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; modules for two related purposes. First, Gygax explains, &quot;There were several very expert players in my campaign, and this was meant as yet another challenge to their skill—and the persistence of their theretofore-invincible characters. Specifically, I had in mind foiling Rob Kuntz&#x27;s PC , &quot;Robilar&quot;, and Ernie Gygax&#x27;s PC, &quot;Tenser&quot;.&quot; Second, so that he was &quot;ready for those fans [players] who boasted of having mighty PCs able to best any challenge offered by the AD&amp;D game.&quot;

&quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; was revised in late 1977 to be published as a module for &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. In 1978, TSR, Inc. published the module with a monochrome cover, revised and updated for use with first edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; rules. The module included a twenty-page book, a twelve-page book, and an outer folder; the original printing featured a two-color cover. The module features a book of illustrations intended to be shown to the players as they progress in the adventure. &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; was republished in 1981 as a 32-page booklet with identical text but a new, full-color cover. The module has been described as the first adventure of a high-level scenario series, and was included as part of the &quot;Realms of Horror&quot; abridged compilation produced in 1987.

In 1998, the module was reprinted as part of the &quot;Return to the Tomb of Horrors&quot; module—a substantial expansion and sequel to the original adventure, written for 2nd Edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; rules. Wizards of the Coast released an updated version of the original module as a free download for Halloween 2005, retaining much of the original content; the updated content is from the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; supplement book &quot;Libris Mortis&quot;. This updated version was designed for use with the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.5 Edition rules. &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; was also adapted into a novel of the same name by Keith Francis Strohm for the &quot;Greyhawk Classics&quot; series published by Wizards of the Coast in 2002.

In July 2010, Wizards of the Coast released two adventures bearing the &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; name. One is a hardcover super-adventure written by Ari Marmell and Scott Fitzgerald Gray, which builds on and expands the legend of the original Tomb using the canon of &quot;Return to the Tomb of Horrors&quot; as a starting point. The second &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; is a conversion and update of the original module for 4th Edition rules, written by Scott Fitzgerald Gray and released to members of the RPGA as part of the DM Rewards program.

All four modules of the S-series were included as part of the &quot;Dungeons of Dread&quot; hardcover adventure collection, released on March 19, 2013. Lawrence Schick wrote in the foreword: &quot;The dungeon of the demi-lich Acererak was, for Gary, a kind of thought experiment: If an undead sorcerer really wanted to keep his tomb from being plundered by greedy adventurers, how would he do it? The answer, of course, was to defend the crypt with tricks and traps designed not to challenge the intruders but to &quot;kill them dead&quot;. And furthermore, to do it in ways so horrific that all but the most determined party would give up and leave well enough alone.&quot;

In 2017, Wizards re-released &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; updated to 5th Edition rules as part of the &quot;Tales from the Yawning Portal&quot; collection. The game design and the background of the third part of the &quot;Tomb of Annihilation&quot; campaign is based on the &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot;.

2018 special edition of the book &quot;Art and Arcana&quot; contained a bonus pamphlet of the &quot;original 1975 tournament module&quot; previously unpublished.

As part of Extra Life 2019, Wizards of the Coast released &quot;Infernal Machine Rebuild&quot;, a time-hopping adventure that allows characters to travel back to the Tomb of Horrors during its construction.

==Reception==
&quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; was ranked the 3rd greatest &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventure of all time by &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazine in 2004. &quot;Dungeon Master for Dummies&quot; lists &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; as one of the ten best classic adventures and posits that many of the adventure&#x27;s traps would kill a character just for making poor choices. Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book &quot;Heroic Worlds&quot;, calls the adventure &quot;A very difficult scenario&quot;.

Don Turnbull reviewed &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; in issue No. 13 of the magazine &quot;White Dwarf&quot; and gave the module a rating of 10 out of 10. Turnbull commented on the adventure&#x27;s difficulty, noting that the dungeon is &quot;sprinkled extensively with subtle, insidious and carefully laid traps, and it will be a fortunate adventurer who manages to avoid them&quot;. He felt that the illustration booklet would add a great deal to the adventure&#x27;s atmosphere and felt that the pre-generated character roster was useful. Turnbull noted that the module is &quot;very hard and will be hard for the DM to learn in advance, though this is an essential prerequisite of running it properly for it is much more subtle than the G or D modules&quot;, and he said that this module has in common with those modules an &quot;excellent format, for instance, and the comprehensive way in which the scenario is introduced. TSR&#x27;s high quality has not been in any way compromised, and in S1 it has even been improved upon.&quot;

Wayne MacLaurin of SF Site describes the module as &quot;a classic&quot; and a &quot;must have&quot; for gamers, saying that when he played the game in high school, most of his group&#x27;s characters quickly died. MacLaurin explains that &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; is a classic not because of its difficulty, but because it was the first module that did not involve killing large numbers of monsters; it was a &quot;collection of puzzles and maps.&quot; Its focus on traps rather than monsters was a surprise to gamers at the time. One technique that some players used to get past the deathtraps was to drive cattle ahead of them, which Lore Sjöberg of &quot;Wired&quot; described as &quot;a bit less than heroic&quot;, noting that in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Gandalf did not send &quot;50 head of cattle into the Mines of Moria to serve as Balrog bait.&quot; The authors of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons and Philosophy: Raiding the Temple of Wisdom&quot; commented that &quot;One of the most famous D&amp;D adventures, the &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot;, has grown to have a legendary status amongst gamers [...] It has come to be known as a truly difficult adventure, and obtained enough of a cult following to induce some players to put &#x27;I survived the Tomb of Horrors&#x27; bumper stickers on their cars.&quot; David M. Ewalt, in his book &quot;Of Dice and Men&quot;, discussed the adventure&#x27;s reputation as &quot;the deadliest game ever written&quot;, noting that it &quot;unloads a series of complicated puzzles and nightmarish traps&quot; on characters, concluding that &quot;Few survive long enough to collect any treasure, and even fewer manage to find their way back through the deadly maze and escape with their spoils.&quot;

Something Awful presented a humorous article about the ways that &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; is the bane of gamers everywhere since it is basically a series of traps that kills off most of the characters. &quot;One of the best (worst) things about this module is that Acererak the demi-lich is a huge asshole. He&#x27;s an asshole for filling his tomb with traps AND treasure, he&#x27;s an asshole because he leaves little messages throughout his tomb bragging about how he&#x27;s going to kill the players.&quot;

==Legacy==

&quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; has also influenced later &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; products. Jason Bulmahn used the module, as well as Indiana Jones, as inspiration for some of the traps in the 2007 &quot;D&amp;D&quot; supplement &quot;Dungeonscape&quot;. The computer role-playing game &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;, developed by Black Isle Studios, was influenced by the module; Black Isle Studios division director Feargus Urquhart said, &quot;We wanted something that reminded everyone of their first foray into dungeons like the Tomb of Horrors, with traps around every corner, and the undead crawling out of the walls.&quot;

&quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; is key to the plot of the novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot; by Ernest Cline, which is set in a virtual reality world created by a man who was a fan of the module. The character James Halliday recreated the dungeon in detail, which the novel&#x27;s other characters must traverse to advance in the global contest and win Halliday&#x27;s fortune. In the &quot;Ready Player One&quot; film adaptation, the graffiti on the back of Aech&#x27;s van is from &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot;, shunning the copper key&#x27;s original location for a reference-packed race for the key.

<doc id="597674" wikidata="Q8032766" url="?curid=597674" title="Woodie (car body style)">
<text>A woodie (or a woodie wagon) is a wood-bodied automobile, that became a popular type of station wagon the bodywork of which is constructed of wood or is styled to resemble wood elements. The appearance of polished wood gave a resemblance to fine wooden furniture and on many occasions the wood theme continued to the dashboard and inner door panels including the rear tailgate.

Originally, wood framework augmented the car&#x27;s structure. Over time manufacturers supplanted wood construction with a variety of materials and methods evoking wood construction — including infill metal panels, metal framework, or simulated wood-grain sheet vinyl bordered with three-dimensional, simulated framework. Wood construction was evoked abstractly on the Nissan Pao (1989–1991) and Ford Flex (2009–2019) with a series of horizontal grooves and strakes.

==History==

===1930s and 1940s===
As a variant of body-on-frame construction, the woodie as a utility vehicle or station wagon originated from the early practice of manufacturing the passenger compartment portion of a vehicle in hardwood. It was a modern interpretation of an earlier horse-drawn wagon called a shooting brake which was made entirely of wood used to transport hunting spoils, gun racks, and ammunition on shooting trips. 

Woodies were popular in the United States and were produced as variants of sedans and convertibles as well as station wagons, from basic to luxury. They were typically manufactured as third-party conversions of regular vehicles — some by large, reputable coachbuilding firms and others by local carpenters and craftsmen for individual customers. They could be austere vehicles, with side curtains in lieu of roll-up windows (e.g., the 1932 Ford) — and sold in limited numbers (e.g., Ford sold 1654 woodie wagons). Eventually, bodies constructed entirely in steel supplanted wood construction — for reasons of strength, cost, safety, and durability.

===1950s and 1960s===

In 1950, Chrysler discontinued their woodie station wagons on DeSoto, Dodge and Plymouth station wagons. Buick&#x27;s 1953 Super Estate Wagon and 1953 Roadmaster Estate Wagon were the last production American station wagons to retain real wood construction. Other marques by then were touting the advantages of &quot;all-steel&quot; construction to the buying public. By 1955, only Ford and Mercury, joined in 1965 by Chrysler, offered a &quot;woodie&quot; appearance — evoking real wood with other materials including steel, plastics and DI-NOC (a vinyl product). As the appearance became popular, Ford, GM, and Chrysler offered multiple models with the woodgrain appearance until the early 1990s.

The British Motor Corporation (BMC) offered the Morris Minor Traveller (1953–1971) with wood structural components and painted aluminum infill panels — the last true mass-produced woodie. Morris&#x27; subsequent Mini Traveller (1961–1969) employed steel infill panels and faux wood structural members.

==Simulated woodgrain==

After the demise of models using actual wood construction, manufacturers continued to evoke wood construction with sheet-vinyl appliques of simulated wood grain, sometimes augmented with three-dimensional, simulated framework, and later by a simple series of indented grooves in the bodywork.

The 1966 Chevrolet Caprice in its second season, added to the four-door hardtop body style a full line of models including a vinyl-wood trimmed station wagon, the Caprice Estate. Dodge also reintroduced simulated wood the same year.

Ford marketed the Ford Pinto Squire with vinyl simulated wood trim in the early 1970s. When Chevrolet proposed a simulated woodgrain option for the Chevy Vega Kammback wagon for the 1973 model year, after a gap of four years of applying woodgrain film on the Caprice, the Vega&#x27;s production schedule made smooth application of the applique difficult without wrinkles and heavy scrappage — requiring retraining by the film supplier, 3M. Subsequent rebadged variants of the Vega (marketed as &quot;Woody&quot;), including the Pontiac Astre Safari, Chevrolet Monza Estate and Pontiac Sunbird Safari, also offered simulated wood trim. Chevrolet offered a simulated woodie version of the Chevette in 1976, and AMC offered the Pacer wagon with optional simulated wood trim in 1977.

Ford also marketed version of their Ranchero model, a coupe utility produced between 1957 and 1979 with an open bed like a pickup truck but from a station wagon platform, with simulated woodgrain siding. In 1973, Ford produced a minivan prototype that offered a woodgrain appearance to preceded the Chrysler minivan, called the Ford Carousel, but it was not put into production. The 1973–1976 Chevrolet El Camino Estate, 1973–1977 Chevrolet Suburban, 1977–1979 Volkswagen Rabbit, and 1970–1991 Jeep Wagoneer had simulated woodgrain siding.

Introduced in 1981, the Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx four-door wagons offered optional simulated wood trim. GM offered its full-size wagons in wood trim versions until their final year in 1996. From 1982 to 1988, Chrysler used the Town &amp; Country name on a station wagon version of the K-based, front wheel drive LeBaron, featuring plastic woodgrain exterior trim with three dimensional simulated framework. As the station wagon declined in North America, manufacturers offered faux wood trim on SUVs and minivans (e.g., the Jeep Cherokee and Chrysler minivans). Chrysler offered simulated wood as an option for the Chrysler PT Cruiser, introduced in 2000—and aftermarket firms offered kits as well.

Japanese carmakers shied away from the appearance apart from port-of-entry or dealer-installed trim offered to North American consumers, although Mazda equipped the 1972-1977 Mazda Luce/RX-4 optionally, Honda briefly offered the 1980 Honda Civic station wagon, and Nissan offered the appearance on the 1983-1987 Nissan Cedric V20E SGL and Nissan Gloria V20E SGL top trim package station wagons to Japanese customers only.

In 2010, George Barris created a woodie version of the Smart Fortwo, an aftermarket firm offered a simulated wood kit for the same car, and GM displayed a prototype woodie version of the forthcoming Chevrolet Spark for the 2010 Paris Motor Show.

Introduced in 2008, the Ford Flex featured a series of side and rear horizontal grooves intended to evoke a woodie look—without either wood or simulated wood. Car Design News said the styling references &quot;a previous era without resorting to obvious retro styling cues.&quot;

==Legacy==
Columbia Pictures&#x27; top-grossing film for the 1940s, director John Stahl&#x27;s 1945 &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; starring Gene Tierney and Cornel Wilde, features a &quot;woodie&quot; station wagon early in the film. Many other American movies from the 1940s also feature woodies.

The woodie was also closely associated with surfers and Surf-rock, e.g., “I bought a ’34 wagon and we call it a woodie&quot; from the classic &quot;Surf City&quot; by Jan and Dean or the 1963 instrumental &quot;Boogie Woodie&quot; by The Beach Boys.

In 1995, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 15 cent stamp commemorating the woodie wagon.

<text>Dzerzhinsk () is a city in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia, located along the Oka River, about east of Moscow and west of Nizhny Novgorod. Population: 

It was previously known as &quot;Rastyapino&quot; (until 1929).

==History==
First mentioned in 1606 as Rastyapino (), since 1929 it has been named after Felix Dzerzhinsky, a Bolshevik leader who was the first head of the Soviet Cheka (secret police).

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with three work settlements and eleven rural localities, incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Dzerzhinsk—an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Dzerzhinsk is incorporated as Dzerzhinsk Urban Okrug.

==Chemical weapons and other production==

Modern-day Dzerzhinsk is a large center of the Russian chemicals production industry. In the past, the city was also among Russia&#x27;s principal production sites for chemical weapons. Owing to its strategic significance, this city was, until recently, officially closed to foreign visitors.

Manufacture of various chemical weapons started under Soviet government control in 1941, particularly concentrating on the production of lewisite—the poisonous effects of which are owed to its arsenic trioxide content—and yperite (mustard gas). The factory producing these substances was called the &quot;Kaprolactam&quot; (or &quot;Caprolaktam&quot;) Organic Glass Factory, and in addition to its arsenic-based weapons, also produced prussic acid and phosgene.

Chemical weapons production at Dzerzhinsk ceased in 1965. Some materials were transferred to storage units, while large amounts of waste material—frequently containing high concentrations of arsenic—were buried in dumps on the site of the factory. Full dismantling of the yperite facility was commenced in 1994. As of 1998, the lewisite production unit was still not completely disassembled.

, Dzerzhinsk had 38 large industrial enterprises, which exported goods worldwide. About one thousand varieties of chemical products are produced in Dzerzhinsk. The largest factories, which exist or existed in the past, include:
*&quot;Sverdlov Plant, FSE (Federal State Enterprise)&quot; manufactures munitions, battle and industrial explosives, and chemicals for industrial purposes (phenol-formaldehyde resin, epoxy resin, carbamide-furane resin, plasticizers, hardeners of various modifications, nitrobenzene, sulphanole, acetic anhydride, various cleaners and detergents, as well as other products). The plant is included in the presidential list of the country&#x27;s strategic enterprises. This is Dzerzhinsk&#x27;s largest factory. On 20 October 2024 it was reported that the plant had been struck by Ukrainian drones. The extent of the damage to the plant was unclear.
* &quot;JSC Kristall Research Institute&quot;, a military explosives factory, part of the Sverdlow Plant, which suffered a serious explosion in June 2019.
*&quot;Korund, JSC&quot; (opened in 1915, the first factory in Russia to produce cyanide, still operational). This plant produces corundum for lasers and other applications. It is the oldest enterprise in Dzerzhinsk. In 2004, the plant was temporarily closed due to bankruptcy.
*&quot;Dzerzhinskhimmash, JSC&quot; (opened in 1941, currently (2013) makes distillation and column equipment, evaporators, heat exchangers).
*&quot;Sintez, JSC&quot;. Produces acetone, carbonyl iron, diethanolamine, isopropanol, methylamine, phenol, etc.
*&quot;Orgsteklo, JSC&quot; (previously manufactured specialist glass for the aeronautics market, currently (in 2012?) specializes in production of acrylic co-polymers and organic glasses).
*&quot;Avangard-KNAUF, JSC&quot;
*&quot;Liebherr, JSC&quot;
*&quot;Plastik, JSC&quot;
*&quot;Aviabor, JSC&quot;
*&quot;SIBUR-Neftekhim, JSC&quot;
*&quot;Oka&quot;, &quot;Yava&quot;, &quot;Orgsitilen&quot;, &quot;Zarya&quot; (no longer functioning).

==Pollution==
According to the September 12, 2007, study by the Blacksmith Institute, Dzerzhinsk is one of the worst-polluted cities of the world and has a life expectancy of 42 years for men and 47 for women, with the 2003 death rate exceeding its birth rate by 260%. Environmental action groups such as Greenpeace attribute such low life expectancy to high levels of persistent organic chemicals, particularly dioxins. The Blacksmith Institute also names sarin, lewisite, sulfur mustard, hydrogen cyanide, phosgene, lead, and organic chemicals among the worst pollutants. Parts of Dzerzhinsk&#x27;s water are contaminated with dioxins and phenol at levels that are reportedly seventeen million times the safe limit.

Dzerzhinsk&#x27;s environmental agency estimates that almost 300,000 tons of chemical waste were dumped in the city between 1930 and 1998. The Ecology Committee of the Russian State Duma also considers Dzerzhinsk among the top ten cities with disastrous ecological conditions.

Dzerzhinsk&#x27;s City Administration, however, asserts that the Blacksmith Institute report is false, stating, for example, that since sarin had never been produced in the city (seems to be credible according to Fedorov, p262, Table 7.1), it cannot be one of the major pollutants. Also, according to the city&#x27;s health department, the average life expectancy in the city was 64 years in 2006. Askhat Kayumkov, the head of the &quot;Dront&quot; public ecological organization, which was quoted as a source by the Blacksmith Institute, states that his organization never provided the Blacksmith Institute with data of any kind. Furthermore, he does not believe that Dzerzhinsk is one of the most polluted cities in Russia, much less in the whole world.

In the end, however, despite the ecological situation in the city being at its best in the previous 80 years (mostly due to bankruptcies and closures of the polluting factories), several locations in the city pose a tangible ecological risk. These sites include the 110ha Igumnovo landfill, toxic waste burial grounds, and a so-called &quot;White Sea&quot; composed of discarded chemical wastes. These sites are kept under constant ecological monitoring.

In June 2019 a powerful explosion at State Research Institute Kristall injured 79 people and destroyed 180 homes in the neighbourhood.

After unsuccessful tenders in 2012–13, GazEnergoStroy was selected for cleanup in 2016. The liquidation of &quot;Black Hole&quot; started and waste burning infrastructure was completed by 2019. According to sources the amount of waste is 57% more than expected, and the cleanup might only finish in autumn of 2021 with an extra 238 million rubles from the central government, but the request was denied. According to local newspaper the equipment downtime is 49% and further delay is expected.
Reclamation works on &quot;White Sea&quot; and Igumnovo were ongoing in 2019 by GazEnergoStroy.

==Sights==

Shukhov Tower on the Oka River, the unique architectural construction—the steel lattice hyperboloid tower built by Soviet engineer and scientist Vladimir Shukhov in 1929—is located near Dzerzhinsk on the left bank of the Oka River. There used to be two towers, but one was stolen for scrap metal in 2005.

*Sergey Chigrakov, rock performer and songwriter
*Aleksandr Demenshin, former Russian professional football player
*Eduard Limonov, writer and politician
*Natali, pop singer and songwriter
*Irina Voronina, Playboy playmate

<doc id="597684" wikidata="Q821531" url="?curid=597684" title="Since I Left You">
<text>Since I Left You is the debut studio album by Australian electronic music group the Avalanches, released on 27 November 2000 by Modular Recordings. It was produced by group members Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann (under the pseudonym Bobbydazzler), and samples extensively from various genres. The album was recorded and produced at two separate, near-identical studios by Chater and Seltmann, exchanging audio mixes of records they sampled.

After the album&#x27;s positive reception in Australia, the duo considered an international release – its date was held back until 2001 in the United Kingdom and North America and appeared in slightly altered forms. The delay and changes occurred so that the group could obtain permission to use the samples or use replacements. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;Electricity&quot;, &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot;, &quot;Since I Left You&quot;, and &quot;Radio&quot;. The group promoted the album by organising headlining tours in Australia, Europe and the United States.

&quot;Since I Left You&quot; was acclaimed by critics. It peaked in the top 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart, number 12 in Norway, number eight on the UK Albums Chart and, in the United States, at number ten on the Top Electronic Albums chart and in the top 40 on the Top Heatseekers chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001, it won in four categories: Breakthrough Artist – Album, Best Dance Release, Producer of the Year for Bobbydazzler, and Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot;. &quot;Since I Left You&quot; became one of the best-reviewed albums of the 2000s, and was listed at number ten in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

==Production==
The Avalanches began work on the album in 1999 under the working title &quot;Pablo&#x27;s Cruise&quot;, primarily working with a Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 samplers. Group members Darren Seltmann and Robbie Chater spent hours sampling music from vinyl records to create the songs on the album: Chater has estimated that there are over 3,500 samples that were used overall although some estimate the number to be much lower, roughly 900. After sampling and arranging, the pair would swap their tapes, listen to each other&#x27;s ideas, and expand on whatever they had heard. Despite working separately, both Chater and Seltmann had nearly identical studio set-ups.

Initially, Seltmann and Chater were not planning for an international release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they &quot;were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed ... We had no idea the record would get such a wide-scale release so we saw no need to keep track of what we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a &#x27;No-one&#x27;s going to listen to it anyway&#x27; sort of attitude.&quot; The sources span many different styles of music, sampling artists such as Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster, and Madonna. Seltmann felt that &quot;[t]he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it&#x27;s almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like &#x27;Holiday&#x27; come up&quot;. He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as &quot;funny samples&quot; that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;Holiday&quot; was &quot;one of those where we put something together, ended it with &quot;Holiday&quot; and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn&#x27;t live without it so I guess we just had to make that one work&quot;. Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, &quot;[t]he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away&quot;. The Avalanches worked with sample-clearance expert Pat Shannahan to clear the thousands of samples in the record. The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. &quot;Electricity&quot; was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song &quot;still sounds good&quot;. In February 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album under the pseudonym Bobbydazzler, and its official title was revealed as &quot;Since I Left You&quot; in March 2000.

==Style and themes==
&quot;Since I Left You&quot; was originally developed to be a concept album. Chater described its initial theme as a love story, &quot;an international search for love from country to country. The idea of a guy following a girl around the world and always being one port behind. And that was just because we had all these records from all over the world, and we&#x27;d like to use all that stuff.&quot; The concept album idea was abandoned when the group felt they should not make their themes too obvious. The album&#x27;s sound was in response to dance music at that time, that Chater felt was &quot;about big drums, big production: think of a record like the Chemical Brothers &quot;Block Rockin&#x27; Beats&quot;, with those amazing drums, and how huge those records sounded&quot;. The Avalanches felt their early music could not compare to that sound and desired a recording with less bass that was influenced by 1960s music such as the Beach Boys and Phil Spector.

==Release==

When &quot;Since I Left You&quot; was being recorded, the Avalanches had trouble choosing songs to be released as singles, finding them not sounding as good outside the context of the album. On 13 September 1999, they issued &quot;Electricity&quot; as a four-track 12&quot; vinyl single in Australia (on Modular Recordings) and as a two-track 7&quot; vinyl single in the United Kingdom (on Rex Records). Chater felt that Modular was very patient with the group releasing the record. On 21 August 2000, &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot; was released as the second single from the album by Modular in Australia in both a four-track and two-track version. The initial release date for &quot;Since I Left You&quot; was going to be 11 September; however, it was delayed due to issues with sample clearance. On 27 November, the album was issued in Australia with plans to have a worldwide release in early 2001. The later release date outside Australia was due to additional sample clearances needed for international markets. To celebrate the album&#x27;s release in Melbourne, the group had a boat cruise party through Port Phillip Bay. On 5 February 2001, they released the album&#x27;s title track as the third single in Australia, and followed on 23 July with &quot;Radio&quot;.

In April, &quot;Since I Left You&quot; was released in the UK through XL Recordings with the album selling far more copies than the label&#x27;s original target amount. On 28 April, it entered the UK Album Charts, which peaked at number eight and remained in the chart for 25 weeks. In late March, the single &quot;Since I Left You&quot; was issued in the UK and entered the charts at number 16 on 7 April 2001. On 6 November, &quot;Since I Left You&quot; was released in the United States by Sire Records, and charted on the US Top Electronic Albums, peaking at number ten, and on the Top Heatseekers chart, peaking at number 31. The album artwork features an excerpt of &quot;Sinking of USS President Lincoln&quot; by Fred Dana Marsh (1920).

===Versions===
Several versions of the album were created due to sample clearance difficulties.

In 2000, Zomba Records released a promo CD of an earlier version of the album containing all original samples and an extra track after &quot;Stay Another Season&quot; titled &quot;With My Baby&quot;, which released as a B-side to &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot; in Australia.

For the first international release, multiple samples had to be cut from the original Australian release, including dialogue by Robert De Niro from the film &quot;Midnight Run&quot;, an Ennio Morricone excerpt, and flute sounds from War&#x27;s &quot;H2 Overture&quot;. A version of &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot; with re-recorded vocal lines was also included on a number of releases. A mixtape named &quot;Gimix&quot; was sold as tour merch in 2000, designed to combat bootlegged copies of the album which were circulating due to the album&#x27;s publishing delays. The mixtape contains tracks from &quot;Since I Left You&quot;, songs sampled on the album, songs with copyright clearance problems, and other favorites.

In July 2011, a deluxe reissue of &quot;Since I Left You&quot; was announced that would include the original album as well as a bonus disc containing b-sides, demo tracks and remixes of songs from the original album by artists including El Guincho, MF DOOM, Black Dice, and the Avalanches themselves. In 2016, it was announced that a reissue of &quot;Since I Left You&quot; would be released on 27 January 2017 in a limited edition of five thousand copies. Fans were allowed to vote on which colour vinyl the album would be pressed on, as well as which record store the album would be sold at.

In December 2017, some retailers listed a 33-track deluxe edition of the album online. Later, a finished 4xLP deluxe edition copy made its way into the hands of a collector, who submitted pictures and details about the release to Discogs. The deluxe edition features alternate artwork and a collection of new remixes from MF DOOM, Deakin, Leon Vynehall, Canyons, Sinkane, Sun Araw, Black Dice, and Edan alongside select previously released remixes, and the original demo of Thank You Caroline. In November 2018, the band promised the deluxe edition was &quot;nearly ready&quot;. In April 2021, the band announced the 20th anniversary edition, consisting of the aforementioned deluxe edition, would be released on June 4.

To promote &quot;Since I Left You&quot;, the Avalanches organised their first Australian head-lining tour in October 2000, planning to head to all the capital cities. All dates on the tour were sold out. In their Brisbane show, Seltmann broke his leg in an on-stage collision with bass guitarist and singer Tony Di Blasi. From January to February 2001, the Avalanches toured with the Big Day Out festival in Australia, visiting four capital cities. While on tour in Europe, Seltmann broke his other leg, thereafter the rest of the tour&#x27;s shows were DJ sets. The British dance music magazine &quot;Muzik&quot; awarded the Avalanches as best live act.

==Critical reception==

Seltmann and Chater did not initially think that &quot;Since I Left You&quot; would receive much attention. However, the album garnered widespread critical acclaim from the music industry. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, it received an average score of 89, based on 21 reviews. It became one of the best reviewed albums of 2000, as well as being the highest rated dance album on that site. The album peaked in the top 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart and number 12 in Norway on the VG-lista Top 40 Albums Chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001, the Avalanches won four awards from nine nominations, including Breakthrough Artist – Album, Best Dance Release and Producer of the Year (for Chater and Seltmann aka Bobbydazzler) for &quot;Since I Left You&quot;. The fourth award win was for the related single &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot; as Breakthrough Artist – Single.

Christian Ward of &quot;NME&quot; hailed it as &quot;a joyous, kaleidoscopic masterpiece of sun-kissed disco-pop&quot;, and Andy Battaglia from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called it &quot;a psychedelic disco fry-up&quot;, while Andy Kellman of AllMusic called it one of the most intimate and emotional dance records that is not vocal-based. Marc Savlov of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; found the album as surprising as &quot;Primal Scream&#x27;s life-changing &quot;Screamadelica&quot; was a decade ago. It&#x27;s downright shocking how fun this is&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Matt LeMay credited the Avalanches for developing a &quot;unique context&quot; for the songs without compromising their original &quot;distinct flavor&quot; and said that the album &quot;sounds like nothing else&quot; because of how the samples are employed rather than their quality or volume. &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s Gareth Grundy remarked that its clever music is delivered as engagingly as &quot;more conventional dance sounds&quot; and that the album &quot;finally fulfils sampling&#x27;s original promise&quot; of producing new, extraordinary sounds from artfully appropriated pieces of existing songs. Amy Bell of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; praised it as one of the year&#x27;s best albums.

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was less enthusiastic and said that the Avalanches deliver &quot;the long-promised new-songs-from-old-songs trick, in which untrackable samples are stitched together until they mesh into compelling music that never existed before. Unfortunately, the music in question is string-section disco.&quot; &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;″s Tyler Martin felt that the tracks lack innovation, nuance, and rhythmic complexity, but that several of them are exceptional. The website later placed the album at number 16 on their list of top 50 albums from 2000 to 2005. In a retrospective review for &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Michaelangelo Matos praised the Avalanches&#x27; balance of &quot;the familiar and obscure&quot; through their sampling techniques and their &quot;playful, airy grooves&quot;, as well as the album&#x27;s &quot;surprisingly resonant emotional core&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Since I Left You&quot; was placed in some year-end polls. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Since I Left You&quot; at number three in their top twenty albums of 2001 poll and number 10 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s, declaring the album &quot;a masterpiece of mood-setting that riffs off an ideal where getting on an airplane and landing in another corner of the world was the most exotic thing a person could do.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; listed it as one of the best 50 albums of 2001. The album was voted the 11th best album of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for 2001. In 2008, the Australian newspaper &quot;The Age&quot; assembled a panel of experts ranging from its own critics and music journalists to musicians, broadcasters, record shop owners and band managers to pick a list of definitive fifty Australian albums. &quot;Since I Left You&quot; was included on this list with Chris Johnston declaring the album to be &quot;a beautiful piece of musical art made entirely from samples.&quot; &quot;Since I Left You&quot; was placed at number six on &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s list of &quot;50 most influential Australian albums ever&quot;. &quot;Resident Advisor&quot; declared it to be the seventh best album of the decade. &quot;NOW Toronto&quot; called the album a &quot;sampledelic classic&quot;.

On &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s &quot;Best of the Aughts&quot; list, the album was placed at number six out of one-hundred. Reflecting on the album&#x27;s reception, Chater felt it was well received because &quot;It&#x27;s light-hearted and fun to listen to and there is depth there as well. There are some sadder moments that I think has made it resonate and made it last. It does sound like a 23-year-old kid in his bedroom making a record to me, but you can hear that innocence and joy in the discovery of finding all those sounds. So that was kind of infectious for people.&quot; In October 2010, it was listed at No. 10 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;. Philip Sherburne, writing for Rhapsody, said that &quot;along with DJ Shadow&#x27;s &quot;Endtroducing&quot;, this is one of plunderphonic music&#x27;s greatest LPs&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2019, the album was ranked 34th on &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list. In December of 2021, the album was listed at no. 8 in &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot;″s &#x27;200 Greatest Albums of All Time&#x27; countdown.

<text>Circuit courts are court systems in several common law jurisdictions. It may refer to:

* Courts that literally sit &#x27;on circuit&#x27;, i.e., judges move around a region or country to different towns or cities where they will hear cases;
* Courts that sit within a judicial circuit, i.e., an administrative division of a country&#x27;s judiciary; or 
* A higher-level trial court, e.g., for felony or indictment offences.

==History==

=== Origin in England ===
The term &quot;circuit court&quot; is derived from the English custom of itinerant courts whose judges periodically travelled on pre-set paths - or circuits - to hear cases from different areas. 

==== Establishment ====
The first formal circuits were defined in 1293, when a statute was enacted which established four assize circuits. 

It was long assumed that these circuits originated with the eyre in common pleas during the reign of Henry II, but during the late 1950s, legal historians such as Ralph Pugh recognized that the eyre&#x27;s &quot;connection with later circuit justices is rather collateral than lineal&quot;, and the eyre was merely one of a number of experiments in &quot;systematized itinerant justice&quot; undertaken by the English crown during the late 12th century and the 13th century. 

==== Development ====
The development of the assize circuits was interrupted in 1305 by the appointment of justices of trailbaston by King Edward I. Under King Edward III, two statutes were enacted in 1328 and 1330 which restored the assize circuits and reorganized the counties of England into six circuits where assizes were supposed to be held thrice yearly (but were more often held twice each year). 

By 1337, the six assize circuits had stabilized:
During the 1500s, two major changes occurred. Middlesex was removed from the Home Circuit and grouped with the adjacent City of London (which was never part of the circuits), and Oxfordshire and Berkshire were transferred from the Western Circuit to the Oxford Circuit. The Welsh county of Monmouthshire was also transferred into the Oxford Circuit. 

After that, the circuits of England remained largely static for almost four centuries, until they were again reorganized during the 19th century. Twice each year, judges &quot;literally rode each circuit,&quot; meaning that a pair of common law judges assigned to a circuit rode on horseback through all the county towns and several other important towns in each circuit and heard cases.

=== Origin in North America ===
On the American frontier, a judge often travelled on horseback along with a group of lawyers. Abraham Lincoln was one such attorney who regularly rode the circuit in Illinois, along with Circuit Judge David Davis. In more settled areas, a stagecoach would be used. Eventually, the legal caseload in a county would become great enough to warrant the establishment of a local judiciary. 

Most of these local judicial circuits (that is, in terms of the actual routes travelled by judges) have been thus replaced by judges regularly stationed at local courthouses, but in many areas, the legacy term remains in use.

==England and Wales==
England and Wales is divided into six circuits for the purposes of the administration of justice: the Midland Circuit, North Eastern Circuit, Northern Circuit, South Eastern Circuit, Western Circuit, and the Wales and Chester Circuit.

The system is overseen by the Lord Chancellor. The membership consists of High Court Judges, Circuit Judges, District Judges, law practitioners and academic lawyers. The Circuits also form the basis for administration of the Bar in England and Wales except for Cheshire.

Until 2007 for court administration purposes it formed part of the Wales and Chester Circuit. When in 2007 it became part of the Northern Circuit for court administrative purposes post devolution, the &quot;Wales and Chester Circuit&quot; continued to be the Circuit Bar. 

The Circuit Bars are represented on the Bar Council through the Circuit Leaders.

==Ireland==
In Ireland the Circuit Court is part of the &quot;Courts of First Instance&quot;, senior to the District Court but junior to the High Court (Ireland). It was first established as the &quot;Circuit Court of Justice&quot; under the Courts of Justice Act 1924 and replaced the County Court on the civil side, and quarter sessions and recorder&#x27;s courts on the criminal side, as well as some of the jurisdiction of the assizes. These are heard by a judge sitting alone. It also has jurisdiction to hear appeals from the District Court. Appeals from the court lie to the High Court on the civil side and the Court of Criminal Appeal on the criminal side.

The Circuit Court is so-called because of the circuits on which its judges travel, namely Dublin, Cork, Northern, Western, Eastern, South Western, South Eastern, and Midland, each of which are composed of a number of counties. The court consist of a President and thirty-seven judges. Although there is strictly speaking just one Circuit Court, a sitting of the Circuit Court in any particular location is referred to as &quot;name of town&quot; Circuit Court, e.g. Trim Circuit Court.

The High Court also sits &quot;on circuit&quot; twice yearly, though this is called the High Court on Circuit rather than a circuit court. In this case, &quot;on circuit&quot; means sitting in a location other than Dublin.

==United States==

===Federal courts of appeals===
In the United States, circuit courts were first established in the Thirteen British Colonies. In 1789, the United States circuit courts were United States federal courts established in each federal judicial district. These circuit courts exercised both original (first instance) and appellate jurisdiction. They existed until 1912. The original jurisdiction formerly exercised by the United States circuit courts is now exercised by the United States district courts. Their appellate jurisdiction is now exercised by the United States courts of appeals, which were known as the &quot;United States circuit courts of appeals&quot; from their establishment in 1894 until 1947.

The federal courts of appeals sit permanently in 13 appellate circuits (11 regional circuits as well as a DC Circuit and the Federal Circuit). There are several other federal courts that bear the phrase &quot;Court of Appeals&quot; in their names, but they are not Article Three courts and are not considered to sit in appellate circuits.

The federal courts of appeals are intermediate courts, between the district courts (the federal trial courts) and the Supreme Court. Smaller circuits, such as the Second Circuit and Third Circuit, are based at a single federal courthouse, while others, such as the large Ninth Circuit, are spread across many courthouses. Since three-judge federal appellate panels are randomly selected from all sitting circuit judges, Ninth Circuit judges must often &quot;ride the circuit,&quot; though this duty has become much easier to carry out since the development of modern air travel.

===Supreme Court of the United States===
Under the original Judiciary Act of 1789 and subsequent acts, the justices of the Supreme Court of the United States in Washington, D.C. had the responsibility of &quot;riding circuit&quot; and personally hearing both appeals and trials in the circuit courts, in addition to their caseload back in the capital. This duty was reasonable when the United States consisted of the original Thirteen Colonies along the East Coast of the United States, but became increasingly onerous and impractical with the country&#x27;s rapid westward expansion during the 19th century, and was repealed by Congress with the enacting of the Judiciary Act of 1891. The U.S. Supreme Court justices still retain vestiges of the days of riding circuit; each justice is designated to hear certain interlocutory appeals from specific circuits and can unilaterally decide them or refer them to the entire court. The court&#x27;s customary summer recess originated as the time during which the justices would leave Washington and ride circuit (since dirt roads were more passable in the summer).

===State courts===
Many U.S. states have state courts called &quot;circuit courts.&quot; Most are trial courts of general, original jurisdiction.

*Alabama – Alabama Circuit Courts
*Arkansas – Arkansas Circuit Courts
*Connecticut – Connecticut Circuit Courts
*Florida – Florida circuit courts
*Hawaii – Hawaii State Circuit Courts
*Illinois – Illinois circuit courts
*Indiana – Indiana Circuit Courts
*Kentucky – Kentucky Circuit Courts
*Maryland – Maryland Circuit Courts
*Michigan – Michigan Circuit Courts
*Mississippi – Mississippi Circuit Courts
*Missouri – Missouri Circuit Courts
*New Hampshire – New Hampshire Circuit Courts
*Oregon – Oregon circuit courts
*South Carolina – South Carolina Circuit Court
*South Dakota – South Dakota Circuit Courts
*Tennessee – Tennessee Circuit Courts
*Virginia – Virginia Circuit Court – court of record that has appellate jurisdiction over a county&#x27;s general district court and juvenile and domestic relations court and original jurisdiction over major civil cases and all the county&#x27;s felony cases. A circuit court has the power to issue death sentences and impanel grand juries. The court&#x27;s decisions become legal precedents.
*West Virginia – West Virginia Circuit Courts
*Wisconsin – Wisconsin circuit courts

In Louisiana, the intermediate appellate courts are called the Louisiana Circuit Courts of Appeal. There are five separate judicial circuits.

In many states, such as Missouri, a judicial circuit can encompass one or more counties (see Missouri Circuit Courts). Each circuit court can have several divisions, including circuit, associate, small claims, probate, family, or drug court. Each division hears cases within its particular area of subject-matter jurisdiction, and jurisdiction is based on the size or type of a civil claim or the severity or type of a criminal charge. Drug court, for example, hears only drug-related criminal cases.

Several U.S. states have state supreme courts that traditionally &quot;ride the circuit&quot; in the sense of hearing oral arguments at multiple locations throughout their jurisdictions each year. Among the states with circuit-riding supreme courts are Alaska, California, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Washington.

==Canada==

Courts serving certain areas particularly in Northern Canada, such as the Nunavut Court of Justice and courts serving northern Quebec, travel as circuit courts to hear cases in remote communities.

==Australia==

Courts serving remote areas in the Northern Territory are known as circuit courts, sometimes referred to as &quot;bush courts&quot;.

<doc id="597690" wikidata="Q835926" url="?curid=597690" title="Senegal parrot">
<text>The Senegal parrot (Poicephalus senegalus) is a parrot which is a resident breeder across a wide range of west Africa. It makes migrations within west Africa, according to the availability of the fruit, seeds and blossoms which make up its diet. It is considered a farm pest in Africa, often feeding on maize or millet. It is popular in aviculture.

==Taxonomy==

In 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Senegal parrot in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name &quot;La petite perruche du Sénégal&quot; and the Latin name &quot;Psittacula senegalensis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Senegal parrot. Linnaeus included a terse description, coined the binomial name &quot;Psittacus senegalus&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Poicephalus&quot; which was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1837.

There are two subspecies. 
* &quot;P. s. senegalus&quot; (the nominate subspecies): this subspecies has a yellow vest; its native range includes Senegal, southern Mauritania, southern Mali to Guinea and Lobos Island.
* &quot;P. s. versteri&quot;: this subspecies has a deep-orange/red vest; its range is from the Ivory Coast and Ghana east to western Nigeria.
They do not differ in behaviour, but only in the colour of the &quot;vest&quot;. In the pet trade, the nominate subspecies is the most common though both are raised and sold as pets.

==Description==
Senegal parrots are about long, weigh about . They have a relatively large head and beak for their overall size, and feathers form a short broad tail. Adults have a charcoal grey head, grey beak, bright yellow irises, green back and throat, and yellow underparts and rump. The yellow and green areas on a Senegal parrot&#x27;s front form a V-shape resembling a yellow vest worn over green. Young Juveniles have dark grey, almost black, irises, which change to light grey.

Senegal parrots are not sexually dimorphic, but there are some hypotheses which sometimes might help to determine the sex of adult birds:

*The V-shape of the vest is usually longer in females; in females the green area extends down over the chest to between the legs, whereas in males the tip of the green area ends midway down the chest.
*The female&#x27;s beak and head are generally slightly smaller and narrower than the male&#x27;s.
*The under-tail covert feathers (short feathers under the base of the main tail feathers) are generally mostly yellow in the male and generally mostly green in the female.
*Males are generally, but not always, larger and heavier than female birds.
*DNA testing is another way to determine the sex 
Senegal parrots are birds of open woodland and savanna. They flock most commonly in countries in West Africa. It is a gregarious species, continuously chattering with a range of whistling and squawking calls. Senegal parrots live an average of approximately 25–30 years in the wild, and have been known to live for 50 years in captivity.

Research by Texas State University conducted in southeastern Senegal found that the parrots ate a diet of about 77% fruit, with figs (&quot;Ficus sp.&quot;), African grapes (&quot;Lannea microcarpa&quot;), and shea fruits (&quot;Vitellaria paradoxa&quot;) being the most commonly eaten. Seeds made up about 22% of the diet, and the remaining 1% consisted of flowers.

==Behaviour==

Senegal parrots nest in holes in trees, often oil palms, usually laying three to four white eggs. The eggs are about long by wide. The eggs are incubated by the female, starting after the second egg has been laid, for about 27 to 28 days. Newly hatched chicks have a sparse white down and they do not open their eyes until about two to three weeks after hatching. They are dependent on the female for food and warmth who remains in the nest most of the time until about four weeks after hatching when the chicks have enough feathers for heat insulation. During this time the male brings food for the female and chicks, and guards the nest site. From about two to four weeks after hatching the female also begins to collect food for the chicks. The chicks fly out of the nest at about 9 weeks and they become independent from their parents at about 12 weeks after hatching.

==Conservation status==
Because of its vast range in Africa, the wild Senegal parrot population is difficult to estimate. Nevertheless, in 1981 concerns about extensive trapping of wild parrots for the pet trade led to it being listed on appendix 2 of The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), along with all parrot species. This has made the trade, import and export of all wild caught parrots illegal.

Hand reared Senegal parrots are one of the most popular parrots to be kept as pets, and the most popular &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrot. Their calls are generally high pitched whistles and squawks along with mimics, but they are not as noisy as many other parrot species. They make for a good companion and are quite friendly compared to other parrot species. Senegal parrots are independent at times, needing a very fair amount of sleep during the day. Keeping two as pets can very well aid the parrots social and physical health as they have a companion.

Wild caught Senegal parrots do not usually become tame, and do not make good pets.

===Breeding===
Senegal parrots are relatively easy to breed in captivity and there is a small industry in breeding and hand rearing Senegal parrots and other parrots for the pet trade. In aviculture Senegal parrots can start to breed at the age of 3 to 4 years in captivity, but some do not breed until age 5 years. Parent reared birds are known to breed as early as 2 years of age.

Senegal parrot nest boxes can be any of a variety of sizes and shapes; but for example, a nest box about high and to square would be suitable. An exit and entrance port about in diameter would be suitable, and the birds may enlarge the port by chewing the wood. Nest boxes generally have a secure side door for inspecting the nest.

<text>Pohela Boishakh () (Phonetics: pohela bōiśakh) is the Bengali New Year celebrated by the Bengali people worldwide and as a holiday on 14 April in Bangladesh and 15 April in the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura, Jharkhand and Assam (Goalpara and Barak Valley). It is a festival based on the spring harvest—which marks the first day of the new year in the Bengali calendar.

The Pohela Boishakh has its origins in the Mughal Empire, representing the proclamation of tax collection reforms under Akbar. Its celebration is rooted in the traditions of the Mahifarash community of Old Dhaka. Presently, it is largely a secular holiday for most celebrants and enjoyed by people of several different faiths and backgrounds.

The festival is celebrated with processions, fairs and family time. The traditional greeting for Bengalis in the new year is &quot;Shubho Noboborsho&quot; which is literally &quot;Happy New Year&quot;. The festive &quot;Mangal Shobhajatra&quot; is organised in Bangladesh. In 2016, the UNESCO declared this festivity organised by the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka as a cultural heritage of humanity.

==History and origin==

===Nomenclature===
In Bengali, the word &quot;Pohela&quot; (or &quot;Pahela&quot; ), alternatively &quot;Poila&quot; (), means &#x27;first&#x27; and &quot;Boishakh&quot; (or &quot;Baishak&quot; ) is the first month of the Bengali calendar ( &quot;Pohela Boishakh&quot;, &quot;Pahela Boishakh&quot;, &quot;Pahale Baishak&quot; or &quot;Poila Boishakh&quot;).
Bengali New Year is referred to in Bengali as &quot;Nobo Borsho&quot; (), where &#x27;Nobo&#x27; means new and &#x27;Borsho&#x27; means year.


===Traditional roots===
====Mughal origin theory====
During Mughal rule, land taxes were collected from Bengali people according to the Islamic Hijri calendar. This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, the festival was a tradition introduced in Bengal during the rule of Mughal Emperor Akbar to time the tax year to the harvest, and the Bangla year was therewith called Bangabda. Akbar asked the royal astronomer Fathullah Shirazi to create a new calendar by combining the lunar Islamic calendar and solar Hindu calendar already in use, and this was known as Fasholi shan (harvest calendar). According to some historians, this started the Bengali calendar. According to Shamsuzzaman Khan, it could be Nawab Murshid Quli Khan, a Mughal governor, who first used the tradition of Punyaho as &quot;a day for ceremonial land tax collection&quot;, and used Akbar&#x27;s fiscal policy to start the Bangla calendar.

According to Shamsuzzaman Khan, and Nitish Sengupta, the origin of the Bengali calendar is unclear. According to Shamsuzzaman, it is called Bangla shon or shaal, which are Arabic (سن) and Persian (سال) words respectively, suggests that it was introduced by a Muslim king or sultan.&quot; In contrast, according to Sengupta, its traditional name is &quot;Bangabda&quot;. It is also unclear, whether it was adopted by Alauddin Husain Shah or Akbar. The tradition to use the Bengali calendar may have been started by Husain Shah before Akbar. Regardless of who adopted the Bengali calendar and the new year, states Sengupta, it helped collect land taxes after the spring harvest based on traditional Bengali calendar, because the Islamic Hijri calendar created administrative difficulties in setting the collection date.
Some say that the current Bengali Calendar begins from the year of Hijrah, i.e., migration of Prophet Muhammad, the last messenger in Islam, from Makkah to Madinah.

The festive celebrations of the Bengali New Year can be traced back to the Bengali Muslim fishmonger community of Mahifarash in Old Dhaka. During the Mughal period, the Mahifarash were known for organizing feasts and banquets at their Azimpur grounds to mark the beginning of the cultivation harvest season. This day-long feast served as a precursor to what would later be evolved into the traditional Pohela Boishakh celebration.

====Vikramaditya origin theory====

Some historians attribute the Bengali calendar to the 7th-century Indian king Shashanka. The term &quot;Bangabda&quot; (Bangla year) is found too in two Shiva temples many centuries older than Akbar era, suggesting that Bengali calendar existed before Akbar&#x27;s time. Various dynasties whose territories extended into Bengal, prior to the 13th-century, used the Vikrami calendar. Buddhist texts and inscriptions created in the Pala Empire era mention &quot;Vikrama&quot; and the months such as Ashvin, a system found in Sanskrit texts elsewhere in ancient and medieval Indian subcontinent.

In rural Bengali communities of India, the Bengali calendar is credited to &quot;Bikromaditto&quot;, like many other parts of India and Nepal. However, unlike these regions where it starts in 57 BCE, the Bengali calendar starts from 593 CE suggesting that the starting reference year was adjusted at some point.

===Contemporary usage===

In Bangladesh however, the old Bengali calendar was modified in 1966 by a committee headed by Muhammad Shahidullah, making the first five months 31 days long, rest 30 days each, with the month of Falgun adjusted to 31 days in every leap year. This was officially adopted by Bangladesh in 1987. Since then, the national calendar starts with and the new year festival always falls on 14 April in Bangladesh. In 2018–19, the calendar was amended again, with Falgun now lasting 29 days in regular years and to 30 days in leap ones, in an effort to more align with Western use of the Gregorian calendar. However, the date of the celebration, 14 April, was retained.

The Bengali calendar in India remains tied to the Hindu calendar system and is used to set the various Bengali Hindu festivals. For Bengalis of West Bengal and other Indian states, the festival falls either on 14 or 15 April every year. The current Bengali calendar in use in the Indian states is based on the Sanskrit text &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot;. It retains the historic Sanskrit names of the months, with the first month as Baishakh.

<doc id="597704" wikidata="Q1611652" url="?curid=597704" title="Nadaswaram">
<text>The nadaswaram is a double reed wind instrument from South India. It is used as a traditional classical instrument in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala and in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka.

This instrument is &quot;among the world&#x27;s loudest non-brass acoustic instruments&quot;. It is a wind instrument partially similar to the North Indian &quot;shehnai,&quot; but much longer, with a hardwood body, and a large flaring bell made of wood or metal.

In South Indian culture, the nadasvaram is considered to be very auspicious, and it is a key musical instrument played in almost all Hindu weddings and temples of the South Indian tradition. It is part of the family of instruments known as &quot;mangala vadyam&quot; (lit. &quot;mangala&quot; &quot;auspicious&quot;, &quot;vadya&quot; &quot;instrument&quot;). The instrument is usually played in pairs, and accompanied by a pair of drums called &quot;thavil&quot;; it can also be accompanied with a drone from a similar oboe, called the ottu.

== History ==
The nadasvaram is referred to in many ancient Tamil texts. The Cilappatikaram refers to an instrument called the &quot;vangiyam&quot;. The structure of this instrument matches that of a nadasvaram. Since there are seven holes played with seven fingers, this was also called as the &quot;eḻil&quot;. This instrument, too, is played in Tamil Nadu, and is popular among the Tamil diaspora.

== Construction ==
The nadasvaram contains three parts namely, , , and .

It is a double reed instrument with a conical bore which gradually enlarges toward the lower end. The top portion has a metal staple () into which is inserted a small metallic cylinder () which carries the mouthpiece made of reed. Besides spare reeds, a small ivory or horn needle is attached to the instrument, and used to clear the reed of saliva and other debris and allows free passage of air. A metallic bell () forms the bottom end of the instrument.

The seevali, or reed, is made from a dried grass.

Traditionally the body of the nadasvaram is made out of a tree called (Tamil ஆச்சா; Hindi अंजन)&quot;,&quot; although nowadays bamboo, sandalwood, copper, brass, ebony, and ivory are also used. For wooden instruments, old wood is considered the best, and sometimes wood salvaged from demolished old houses is used.

The nadasvaram has seven finger-holes, and five additional holes drilled at the bottom which can be stopped with wax to modify the tone. The nadasvaram has a range of two and a half octaves, similar to the Indian bansuri flute, which also has a similar fingering. Unlike the flute where semi and quarter tones are produced by the partial opening and closing of the finger holes, in the nadasvaram they are produced by adjusting the pressure and strength of the air-flow into the pipe. Due to its intense volume and strength, it is largely an outdoor instrument, and much more suited for open spaces than for indoor concerts.

== Players ==

Vinny Golia, J. D. Parran, and William Parker have performed and recorded with the instrument. The German saxophonist Roland Schaeffer also plays it, having studied from 1981 to 1985 with Karupaia Pillai.

== In popular culture ==
Among the Tamil movies, two released in the 1960s, namely &quot;Konjum Salangai&quot;(1962) starring Gemini Ganesan and &quot;Thillana Mohanambal&quot;(1968) starring Sivaji Ganesan, featured nadasvaram playing characters. For the &quot;Konjum Salankai&quot; movie, Karukurichi Arunasalam Pillai provided the nadasvaram music. Madurai Sethuraman and Ponnusamy brothers were employed for the nadasvaram playing duo characters Sivaji Ganesan and A.V.M. Rajan for the &quot;Thillana Mohanambal&quot; movie director AP Nagarajan dedicated this movie to legend Karukurichi Arunachalam.

<text>Vishu (Malayalam: വിഷു) is a Hindu festival celebrating the Malayali New Year in Kerala, Tulu Nadu, and Mahe of India. Vishu falls on the first day of the month of &quot;Medam&quot; in the Malayalam Calendar (April 14 or 15 in the Gregorian calendar), signifying the [[Solar New Year|solar new year]] as the sun moves into the zodiac sign of Aries. It is the traditional new year, while the Kollam era calendar new year falls on the 1st Chingham.

Vishu falls either on the same day or near April 14/15 as other new years in parts of India where the sun&#x27;s path is followed, such as in states like Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Bengal, Northeast India, Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, and Jammu. Additionally, the Songkran festival of South East Asia also falls on the Vishu date, with the significance of the Kanikonna as part of Laos new year same like of Vishu celebrations in Kerala.The Sinhalese New Year in Sri Lanka also coincides with the Vishu date, sharing similar traditions such as the Vishu Kani, flower blossoms, traditional foods, and fireworks

The festival is marked by family time, preparing colourful auspicious items and viewing these as the first thing on the Vishu day (Vishukkani). In particular, Malayalis seek to view the golden blossoms of the Indian laburnum (&quot;Kani Konna&quot;), money or silver items, cloth (pattu), mirror, rice, coconut, cucumber, fruits and other harvest products. Days before Vishu, people start bursting fireworks at their houses and it concludes with lot of fireworks on day of Vishu. People wear new clothes (&quot;Kodi&quot;) and they eat a feast called &quot;Sadhya&quot;. In &quot;Kaineettam&quot;, elders give a small amount of pocket money to children.

==Etymology and origin==

&quot;Vishu&quot;, from Sanskrit &quot;Viṣuvam&quot;, literally means &#x27;equal&#x27;, and it connoted to the celebration of spring equinox in the past. The spring equinox however occurs 24 days before the day of Vishu, on 21 March/Meenam 7, due to precession of equinoxes.

==Religious significance==
Vishu marks the first day of the astronomical year, a celebration of new beginnings and prosperity. A key tradition during Vishu is the vishukani, a carefully arranged collection of auspicious items such as fruits, flowers, coins, and gold.The vishukani at the Guruvayoor temple, renowned across the state, attracts many for its beauty and significance, marking the festival as a time of renewal and hope.

The current Vishu year is 01-01-5124 Vishu Varsham (same year as Kali Yuga, as of April 15, 2022). Records that Vishu has been celebrated in Kerala occurred from the reign of Sthanu Ravi since 844 CE, when the new era calendar (Kolla Varsham) was initiated replacing the older calendar with 13 months in a year.

==Practices==
===Vishukkani===

The Malayalam word &quot;kani&quot; literally means &quot;that which is seen first&quot;, so &quot;Vishukkani&quot; means &quot;that which is seen first on Vishu&quot;. The traditional belief is that one&#x27;s future is a function of what one experiences, that the new year will be better if one views auspicious joyful things as the first thing on Vishu. Therefore, Malayali&#x27;s spend the day before preparing a setting, usually a tray, of auspicious items. This setting is the first thing they see when they wake up on the Vishu day.

The Vishukkani setting consists of items such as rice, golden lemon, golden cucumber, coconut cut open, jack fruit, Kanmashi, betel leaves, arecanut, Aranmula kannadi (&quot;Vaalkannadi&quot;), golden colour &quot;Konna&quot; flowers (&quot;Cassia fistula&quot;) which bloom in the season of Vishu, &quot;nilavilakku&quot;, idol of Vishnu or his incarnation Krishna, and other auspicious items. Mirror in Vishukani is a symbol of seeing yourself as a part of abundance you see in the form of Kani.

One of the Vishu related devotional songs (also popularised as a song from the 1962 Malayalam movie &#x27;Omanakkuttan&#x27;) that communicate the glory of Krishna in his childhood form, begins with the following lines:

കണികാണും നേരം കമലാനേത്രന്റെ

നിറമേറും മഞ്ഞത്തുകിൽ ചാർത്തീ

കനകക്കിങ്ങിണി വളകൾ മോതിരം

അണിഞ്ഞു കാണേണം ഭഗവാനേ

(Oh Lotus-eyed, during the vision of Kani, let You be seen adorned with the increasingly glowing yellow costume and the bangles, bells and rings of gold.)

The tradition is that elders light the lamps after waking up, then wakes up juniors in the family. As soon as you wake up, you walk to the kani eyes closed, and sees Kani as the first scene of the year. The same tradition is followed in Kongu Nadu region on Puthandu day.

Traditionally, the vegetables, fruits, nuts, etc. that are included in &quot;Vishukkani&quot; are usually those that are home-grown - coconut, cucumber, mango, pine-apple, jack-frut, betel-leaves, arecanut, etc. &quot;Kanikonna&quot; (Golden Showers) is one of the trees that is planted in the home-ground and community-grounds, and they blossom during the time of Vishu. It is also during the time of Vishu, that people lend their ears to the calls of &quot;Vishupakshi&quot;.

===Vishu Sadhya===

The Sadhya (feast) is a major part of all Kerala festivals, special dishes called Vishu &quot;Kanji&quot;, Thoran and &quot;Vishu katta&quot; are also made. The Kanji is made of rice, coconut milk and spices. Vishu katta is a delicacy prepared from freshly harvested rice powder and coconut milk served with jaggery. For Thoran, the side dish, there are also mandatory ingredients. Other important Vishu delicacies include &quot;Veppampoorasam&quot; (a bitter preparation of neem) and &quot;Mampazhappulissery&quot; (a sour or ripe mango soup) Even temple offerings called &quot;bewu bella&quot;, include a mix of sweet jaggery, bitter neem, and other flavors.

The mixing of sweet, salty, sour, bitter and astringent flavors for the new year Vishu meal is similar to the &quot;pacchadi&quot; food prepared on new year day such as Ugadi by Hindus in Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the Indian subcontinent. These traditional festive recipes, that combine different flavors, are a symbolic reminder that one must expect all flavors of experiences in the coming new year, that no event or episode is wholly sweet or bitter, experiences are transitory and ephemeral, and to make the most from them.

===Padakkam===

The word &#x27;Padakkam&#x27; in Malayalam means firecrackers. Firecrackers are burst during Vishu the same way north Indians burst firecrackers during Diwali.

===Konna===

Konna (&quot;Cassia fistula&quot;), commonly known as golden shower is the flower of the Vishu festival.

===Other customs===
The tradition of buying of new clothes for the occasion of Vishu is called Puthukodi or&quot; Vishukodi.&quot; There is also a popular tradition of elders giving money to younger ones or dependents of the family. This is called &quot;Vishukkaineetam&quot;. Another tradition is of giving alms and contributing to community charity. Children enjoy setting off firecrackers. &quot;Kaineettam&quot; literally means &#x27;extension of hand&#x27;. As seen in many Hindu expressions of good-will, charity and philanthropy, and sustenance of dharma, the &quot;kaineettam&quot; usually ends with the numerical 1, indicating a new beginning, while also a continuation. For example, &quot;Vishukkaineettam&quot; is gifted in amounts such as Rs 11, Rs 21, Rs 51, 101, etc. In earlier times, many used to give the &quot;kaineettam&quot; of a rupee and a quarter, with the quarter being an indicator of growth in abundance and prosperity.

===Pathamudayam===
Pathamudayam is celebrated on the 10th day of Medam Month in Malayalam Era and 10th day after Vishu. According to the tradition, ‘Pathamudayam’ is the day when the sun is most powerful and astrological science support the believe. To symbolise the ten sunrises from Vishu, traditional oil lamps with 10 wicks are lit in every house.

===Velayum Kummaattiyum===
A number of festivals are associated with Vishu - this includes &quot;vishuvela&quot;, &quot;vishukummaatti&quot;, etc. In some of the rural regions of Kerala, the elders of the various castes and clans of that region (&quot;&quot;kaaranavar&quot;) come together during the night of Vishu and engage in &quot;koorayidal&quot;&quot; - a ritual indicating the starting of a period of auspiciousness. This may extend for many weeks, till the culmination of the &quot;vela&quot;/ &quot;kummaatti&quot;. During this time, the members of these castes and clans engage in acts of nobility. Even those who consume non-vegetarian items and alcoholic drinks move themselves away from these. Acts of violence are forbidden in the &#x27;desam&#x27; (region) during this time.

==Related holidays==
The date of Vishu coincides with that of festivals in other parts of India. Vaisakhi, celebrated by Hindus and Sikhs in north and central India, marks the solar new year, as does the Tamil New Year day called Puthandu. Likewise, Bihu is celebrated in Assam. The new year day is on or next to 14 April every year, and is also the new year for many Buddhist communities in parts of southeast Asia such as Myanmar and Cambodia, likely an influence of their shared culture in the 1st millennium CE.

Bishu, a Nepali festival, is celebrated on Baisakh 1 of Nepal 🇳🇵 calendar in Farwest Province of Nepal. It is the most important festival in that region.

However, this is not the universal new year for all Hindus. For some, such as those in and near Gujarat, the new year festivities coincide with the five day Diwali festival. For many others, the new year falls on Ugadi and Gudi Padwa, which falls a few weeks earlier.

Certain images from rage comics are known by specific titles, such as &quot;trollface&quot; (a widely grinning man), &quot;forever alone&quot; (a man crying to himself), or &quot;rage guy&quot; (a man shouting &quot;FUUUUU...&quot;).

To differentiate between the two homonymous shorts, the first short is often referred to as &quot;Jesus vs. Frosty&quot; (1992), and the second short as &quot;Jesus vs. Santa&quot; (1995). Fox executive Brian Graden sent copies of &quot;Jesus vs. Santa&quot; to several of his friends, and from there it was copied and distributed, including on the internet, where it became one of the first viral videos.

==Film and television==

* &quot;The Babadook&quot; (2014) – An Australian psychological horror film that started trending on Twitter in June 2017 when the title character became an unofficial mascot for the LGBT community. Prior to that, rumors of the Babadook&#x27;s sexuality began in October 2016, when some Netflix users reported seeing the film categorized as an LGBT movie on Netflix.
* &quot;Barbenheimer&quot; (2023) – A portmanteau of &quot;Barbie&quot; and &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;. &quot;Barbenheimer&quot; began circulating ahead of the theatrical release of both films on 21 July 2023, with social media users creating and sharing memes noting the juxtaposition between the films.
* &quot;Bee Movie&quot; (2007) – Sped-up or slowed-down clips of the film have become popular on YouTube. One upload by &quot;Avoid at All Costs&quot; exceeded 12 million views as of December 2016. Many of the edited videos in this trend were taken down for spam due to the volume of videos posted by some channels. From September 2013 onwards, a few Internet users posted the entirety of the &quot;Bee Movie&quot; script on sites like Tumblr and Facebook.
* &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; (1999) – The film&#x27;s producers used Internet marketing to create the impression that the documentary-style horror film featured real, as opposed to fictional events.

Two scenes from the film instantly became internet memes the moment it was made available digitally as a result of the controversy: a close-up of Evan crying during the climax of &quot;Words Fail,&quot; his expression wrenched and tortured, and the moment Evan runs off from Zoe Murphy (Kaitlyn Dever) in the hallways during their first meeting at school. Jameson Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed &quot;The image of a crying Platt is already a much-iterated joke, and its thrust is, overwhelmingly, derisive. But being the target of the internet&#x27;s scorn is not de facto a bad thing. When a meme circulates far enough, the underlying movie can gain what feels like cultural currency. The very fact that the images are not part of any intentional advertising actually lends them a note of authenticity. They are, in a perverse way, resonating on their own merit. Is there a better form of contemporary publicity?&quot;
* &quot;Downfall&quot; (2004) – A film depicting Adolf Hitler (portrayed in this film by Swiss actor Bruno Ganz) during his final days of his life.

*&quot;Goncharov&quot; – A nonexistent film invented by users on Tumblr. It is purported to be &quot;the greatest mafia movie ever made,&quot; released in 1973. In 2020, a user posted a picture of a tag found on a pair of boots which featured details on the nonexistent film &quot;Goncharov&quot; in place of a brand label, which suggested it was &quot;A film by Matteo JWHJ0715&quot; and &quot;presented&quot; by Martin Scorsese. Users have inconsistently described the film as being directed by either Matteo JWHJ0715 or Scorsese. This label was speculated by several users to be a misprint of &quot;Gomorrah&quot;. &quot;Goncharov&quot; picked up traction again in late November 2022 when a user created a poster for the film that featured a lineup of actors and character names, ultimately sparking an elaborate fiction of the film&#x27;s existence. Discussion of the film involved detailed critical analysis of the plot, themes, symbolism, and characters, as well as creation of gifs, fan art, and theme music, all presented as if the film were real. The meme&#x27;s popularity caused it to become a trending topic on the Tumblr platform.

* Press to pay respects – A prompt for the player to press a button on the PC version of &quot;Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare&quot;, where the player character would approach the coffin of a fallen comrade in response. The mechanic is repeatedly criticized and ridiculed for both being arbitrary and unnecessary, uninteresting gameplay, as well as being inappropriate to the tone of the funeral the game otherwise intends to convey. The phrase has since become an Internet meme in its own right, sometimes used unironically: during the tribute stream for the Jacksonville Landing shooting, viewers posted a single letter &quot;F&quot; in the chat.
* Roblox – a sandbox game that has spawned several memes, such as its &quot;oof&quot; sound.
* &quot;QWOP&quot; – A browser-based game requiring the player to control a sprint runner by using the Q, W, O, and P keys to control the runner&#x27;s legs.

They have themselves earned their own fandom and derivative works based on jokes from the series. The dub over the scene in &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; where Doctor Eggman destroys half of the moon featuring an expletive-filled rant from the actor has spawned several memes.
**Sanic – A purposely misdrawn Sonic that has been referenced by Sega themselves, and used in merchandise;
**and &quot;Ugandan Knuckles&quot; – A meme that gained high popularity thanks to the social game &quot;VRChat&quot;, where players with a crude Knuckles model asked other players if they &quot;knew da wae&quot; (&quot;know the way&quot;), who their &quot;queen&quot; was, clicking their tongue, and spitting repeatedly.

The stream attracted more than 80,000 simultaneous players with over 10 million views with a week of going live, creating a chaotic series of movements and actions within the game, a number of original memes, and derivative fan art. The combination has been called an entertainment hybrid of &quot;a video game, live video and a participatory experience,&quot; which has inspired similar versions for other games.

* U R MR GAY – A message allegedly hidden in the &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; box art, which appears when each letter not decorated with a star is removed from the art. It was first noticed by a NeoGAF poster in September 2007. Video game journalists have debated as to whether the message was placed on purpose or was simply a humorous coincidence. In &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot;, an alleged response to the former&#x27;s message can be inferred in the title by reading the letters that sparkle in the box art from bottom to top, spelling out &quot;YA I M R U?&quot;
* &quot;Untitled Goose Game&quot; – A 2019 video game developed by Australian game studio House House, in which the player controls a goose causing mischief in an English village.

* &quot;Wordle&quot; – A word-guessing game similar to &quot;Jotto&quot; and &quot;Mastermind&quot;, where the player has only six tries to guess a five-letter word each day, the game indicating whether letters are in the word and/or in the correct position.

The game&#x27;s popularity led to The New York Times Company acquiring the game from its creator Josh Wardle at the end of January 2022 for an undisclosed seven-figure sum.

* Dicks out for Harambe – A slogan that was popularized months after the death of Harambe, a gorilla in a Cincinnati zoo, which could be interpreted as telling individuals to expose their penises in public in honor of the gorilla (although the word &quot;dicks&quot; here is slang for guns). The line was notably uttered by actor Danny Trejo.
* DignifAI – A 4chan-linked campaign to use AI tools to make women in photos look more modestly dressed. The trend is the opposite of deepfake pornography in that it is used to add clothes rather than remove them, and it has been used as a form of slut-shaming.

* Horse ebooks / Pronunciation Book – A five-year-long viral marketing alternate reality game for a larger art project developed by Synydyne. &quot;Horse_ebooks&quot; was a Twitter account that seemed to promote e-books, while &quot;Pronunciation Book&quot; was a YouTube channel that provided ways to pronounce English words. Both accounts engaged in non-sequiturs, making some believe that the accounts were run by automated services. Pronunciation Book shifted to pronouncing numerals in a countdown fashion in mid-2013, concluding in late September 2013 revealing the connection to Horse_ebook and identity of Synydyne behind the accounts, and the introduction of their next art project.
* Hou De Kharcha, a meme in Marathi
* Unregistered HyperCam 2 – The watermark which displayed in the upper-left corner of footage recorded with free versions of the HyperCam 2 screen capture software developed by Hyperionics, Inc.

* Savage Babies – also known as the Most Savage Babies in Human History, a meme popular in 2016 that uses clips from the Indian children&#x27;s YouTube channel VideoGyan 3D Rhymes, namely their series of nursery rhymes &quot;Zool Babies&quot;.

* SCP Foundation – A creative writing website that contains thousands of fictitious containment procedures for paranormal objects captured by the in-universe SCP Foundation, a secret organization tasked with securing and documenting objects that violate natural law and/or pose a threat to humanity&#x27;s perception of normalcy and further existence. The website has inspired numerous spin-off works, including a stage play and video games such as &quot;SCP – Containment Breach&quot;.
* Siren Head – A fictional cryptid which has an air raid siren as a head, created by horror artist Trevor Henderson. It has accumulated a fan following which has spawned numerous pieces of fan works and fan-made video games. Many video edits have depicted Siren Head playing various songs over a populated area. Siren Head has been erroneously recognized as an SCP, most notably when the character was briefly submitted to the SCP Foundation Wiki as SCP-6789; the entry was removed after Henderson and site users expressed intention to keep Siren Head independent of the SCP Foundation Wiki. Another entry, &quot;SCP-5987&quot;, was inspired by the character name and the controversy from the deleted entry.
* Smash or Pass – A game in which players decide whether they would hypothetically &quot;smash&quot; (have sex with) someone or &quot;pass&quot; (choose not to).
* Spiders Georg – A meme which imagines that the (untrue) statistic that the &quot;average person eats 3 spiders a year&quot; is the result of a statistical error caused by the incorporation of &quot;Spiders Georg&quot;, a fictional character who resides in a cave and eats over ten thousand spiders every day, into the study from which this conclusion was drawn.

Variations of the meme have imagined other characters named &quot;Georg&quot; to explain other real or imagined statistics and beliefs.

* Slender Man or Slenderman – A creepypasta meme and urban-legend fakelore tale created on 8 June 2009, by user Victor Surge on Something Awful as part of a contest to edit photographs to contain &quot;supernatural&quot; entities and then pass them off as legitimate on paranormal forums. The Slender Man gained prominence as a frightening malevolent entity: a tall thin man wearing a suit and lacking a face with &quot;his&quot; head only being blank, white, and featureless. After the initial creation, numerous stories and videos were created by fans of the character. Slender Man was later in 2012 and became more widely known. There is also a film released in 2018 to negative reviews.

* Willy&#x27;s Chocolate Experience – An unlicenced event based on the &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; franchise held in Glasgow, Scotland.

<text>Dame Annette Faye King (née Robinson, born 13 September 1947) is a former New Zealand politician. She served as Deputy Leader of the New Zealand Labour Party and Deputy Leader of the Opposition from 2008 to 2011, and from 2014 until 1 March 2017. She was a Cabinet Minister in the Fourth and Fifth Labour Governments, and was the MP for the electorate in Wellington from 1996 to 2017.

==Early life==
The daughter of Frank Pace Robinson and Olive Annie Robinson (née Russ), King was born in Murchison on 13 September 1947. After receiving primary education in Murchison, she attended Murchison District High School from 1960 to 1963, and then Waimea College in 1964. Between 1965 and 1967, she completed a diploma in school dental nursing, and worked as a dental nurse from 1967 to 1981. In 1981, she gained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Waikato, and obtained a postgraduate diploma in dental nursing the same year. She was a tutor of dental nursing in Wellington from 1982 to 1984. She is partly of Sri Lankan descent.

==Political career==





King joined the Labour Party in 1972, and has held various offices within the party, including a term on the party&#x27;s executive (1991–1992). In 1983 King unsuccessfully sought the Labour Party nomination for the seat of Tasman following the retirement of Labour leader Bill Rowling, but lost to Ken Shirley.

===Member of Parliament===

In the 1984 election, she stood as the party&#x27;s candidate for Horowhenua, and was successful. She was re-elected in the 1987 election. King was considered one of the most effective backbenchers in the Fourth Labour Government.

Following the 1987 election, she was appointed parliamentary under-secretary to the Minister of Employment and of Social Welfare. In August 1989 she put herself forward to fill one of two vacant seats in cabinet, winning a caucus ballot against ex-minister Richard Prebble. King was appointed Minister of Employment, Minister of Immigration, and Minister of Youth Affairs. She was also given special responsibility for liaising between Cabinet and the party caucus.

In the 1990 election, King lost the Horowhenua electorate against Hamish Hancock, a lawyer who stood for the National Party. She served as chief executive officer of the Palmerston North Enterprise Board from 1991 until the 1993 election, when she was returned to Parliament as the MP for Miramar. In the 1996 election, when the shift to mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation prompted a reorganisation of electorates, King successfully contested the new seat of Rongotai. In that 1996 election, she was ranked in sixth place on the Labour Party&#x27;s list.

After re-entering parliament new leader Helen Clark appointed her as spokesperson for Immigration and Business &amp; Industry in December 1993. Less than a year later, in October 1994, after Peter Dunne split from Labour, Clark gave King Dunne&#x27;s commerce and customs portfolios as well. In June 1995, after Clive Matthewson left Labour, King was given Matthewson&#x27;s position of Shadow Minister of Social Welfare. In August 1997 King was promoted again, replacing Lianne Dalziel as Shadow Minister of Health while relinquishing the Social Welfare portfolio.

===Cabinet Minister===
When Labour won the 1999 election, and Helen Clark became Prime Minister, King was appointed Minister of Health. She was ranked sixth within Cabinet. After Labour winning a third term in government at the 2005 election, King took on the roles of Minister of Transport and Minister of Police. Following another reshuffle in late 2007, King became the new Minister of Justice. Before the 2008 general election she was elevated to number four on the party list.

===Deputy Leader of the Opposition===
Labour was defeated in the 2008 election by the National Party led by relative newcomer John Key. King retained her seat with a majority of about 7,800 votes. King was elected as the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in a special caucus meeting on 11 November 2008, replacing Michael Cullen. Phil Goff, another senior Labour Party member, became the Leader of the Labour Party, replacing former Prime Minister Helen Clark. King stood again for Rongotai in the 2011 general election. She was ranked second on the Labour Party list. Following the defeat of the Labour Party in the 2011 election, Annette King announced she would step down as Deputy Leader of the Labour party, and Deputy Leader of the Opposition effective 13 December 2011. She was succeeded as Deputy Leader by Grant Robertson in the 2011 Labour Party leadership election.

In the , King increased her majority in the Rongotai electorate, but National won the party vote for the first time since the initial MMP election in 1996. Labour&#x27;s heavy defeat at the 2014 election caused the resignation of David Cunliffe as the party&#x27;s leader and the next leadership election, with King in an interim capacity as deputy leader.

Following the election of Andrew Little as the new leader, King remained as deputy in a permanent capacity. Although Little guaranteed that she would be deputy for at least a year, he did not indicate whether he wanted her to be a future Deputy Prime Minister.

On 1 March 2017 King announced her intention to retire from politics at the , despite initially indicating she would only contest the election on the party list. She also stepped down from the deputy leader role.

==High Commissioner==
On 14 November 2018, King was appointed as High Commissioner to Australia by Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters.

==Honours and awards==
King received both the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal, and the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal in 1993.

In 2007, King was awarded a Bravo award by the New Zealand Skeptics for her work along with &quot;industry group Natural Products New Zealand, their attempt to provide standards and accountability via the Therapeutic Products and Medicines Bill.&quot;

In the 2018 New Year Honours, King was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as a member of Parliament.

==Family==
King is married with one daughter, and has three step-sons. She is a cousin of former National minister Chris Finlayson; King was a second cousin to Finlayson’s mother through her Russ side (the Russes were a large Nelson family also related to Chester Borrows. She received verbal abuse in Parliament from Finlayson in September 2013. Finlayson also opposed her in the Rongotai electorate at the 2008, 2011 and 2014 general elections.

In 2019 an authorized biography of King was published, co-written by John Harvey and Brent Edwards.

<text> or CPE Lyon is a French located in Villeurbanne, near Lyon.

==Degrees==
CPE Lyon offers two &quot;diplôme d&#x27;ingénieur&quot; () and two Master&#x27;s level degrees, in two disciplines and three diplomas.

The chemistry and chemical engineering degrees involve the conception, synthesis and manufacture of new and valuable molecules that can be &quot;first on the market&quot;. They also involve a focus on environmental issues, sustainability and management.

The electronics, telecommunications, maths and computer science degrees include a global education in electronics, microelectronics, computer science, image and signal processing, telecommunications, applied math and management.

CPE Lyon also conducts research in organic chemistry, analytical sciences, chemical and process engineering, microelectronics and image processing.

Selected students can prepare a PhD in one of the research laboratories (50 new students per year on average).

==History==
In 1883, the &quot;École Supérieure de Chimie Industrielle de Lyon (ESCIL)&quot; was founded by Jules Raulin, a student of Louis Pasteur. In 1919 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner Victor Grignard became a director. In that same year, the &quot;Institut de Chimie et Physique Industrielles de Lyon (ICPI)&quot; was founded by Professor Lepercq. In 1933, the &quot;École Supérieure de Chimie Industrielle de Lyon (ESCIL)&quot; was awarded the Légion d&#x27;Honneur by the Ministry of War, for service to the nation.

In 1993, Hubert Curien, former chairman of the European Space Agency (ESA), former president of the CERN and former minister was appointed President of ESCIL. One year later, in 1994, the &quot;École Supérieure de Chimie Industrielle de Lyon (ESCIL)&quot; and the &quot;Institut de Chimie et Physique Industrielles de Lyon (ICPI)&quot; merged to form the current &quot;École Supérieure de Chimie Physique Électronique de Lyon (CPE-Lyon)&quot;.

In 2005, Jean Dercourt, Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, was appointed President of the &quot;École Supérieure de Chimie Physique Électronique de Lyon (CPE-Lyon)&quot;.

<doc id="597745" wikidata="Q7842696" url="?curid=597745" title="Trinity College, Melbourne">
<text>Trinity College is the oldest residential college of the University of Melbourne, the first university in the colony of Victoria, Australia. The college was opened in 1872 on a site granted to the Church of England by the government of Victoria. In addition to its resident community of 380 students, mostly attending the University of Melbourne, Trinity&#x27;s programs includes the Trinity College Theological School, an Anglican training college which is a constituent college of the University of Divinity; and the Pathways School which runs Trinity College Foundation Studies and prepares international students for admission to the University of Melbourne and other Australian tertiary institutions, as well as summer and winter schools for young leaders and other short courses.

== History ==
Trinity College was founded in 1870 by the first Anglican Bishop of Melbourne, Charles Perry. Students were in residence from 1872, the first being John Francis Stretch. The college was affiliated with the University of Melbourne in 1876. The Trinity College Theological School was founded by Bishop James Moorhouse in 1877, and the first theological student was Arthur Green.

In 1883 the college became the first university college in Australia to admit women when Lilian Helen Alexander was accepted as a non-resident student. With the establishment of the Trinity Women&#x27;s Hostel (which later became Janet Clarke Hall) in 1886, Trinity admitted women as resident students, making it the first university college in Australia to do so. Among the earliest resident women was Classicist Melian Stawell.

In 1989 the Trinity College Foundation Studies program was established to prepare international students for entry to the University of Melbourne.

Since 2001, Trinity has also offered summer school programs to high school age students from around Australia and internationally. In 2010 the college hosted its first Juilliard Winter Jazz School.

== Architecture and main buildings==
Situated to the north of the main University of Melbourne campus, as part of College Crescent, Trinity&#x27;s buildings surround a large grassed area, known as the Bulpadock. Its built environment is a mix of stone, stone-faced and brick, in a variety of styles from the different periods of its history.

The college&#x27;s main buildings include:
*1870-2: Leeper Building (formerly the Lodge)
*1878: Bishops&#x27; Building (named after Charles Perry and James Moorhouse, the first and second bishops of Melbourne)
*1880: Dining hall
*1883–87: Clarke&#x27;s Building (designed by Edmund Blacket and listed on the Victorian Heritage Register)
*1914–17: Horsfall Chapel
*1933: Behan Building (named after John Clifford Valentine Behan, a former warden)
*1958: Memorial Building (commonly called &quot;Jeopardy&quot;)
*1963–65: Cowan Building (named after Ronald Cowan, a former warden)
*1995–96: Evan Burge Building (college Library)
*2006–07: Gourlay Building (&quot;Woodheap&quot;)
*2014–16: Gateway Building
*2019–20: Dorothy Jane Ryall Building (&quot;Dorothy&quot;)

== College life ==
=== Clubs and societies ===
The Trinity College Associated Clubs (TCAC) provides leadership for the annual orientation week program at the beginning of the academic year and facilitates a multitude of social, cultural and sporting events throughout the year. Trinity&#x27;s clubs and societies run many different functions and events throughout the year. The current student clubs include an art room and the E. R. White art collection, Beer Budlay, Billiards Room, Dialectic Society (formed in 1877), a drama club, Environmental Committee, Games Society, Gender and Sexuality Alliance, Independent Dining Society, Racquet&#x27;s Society, several music clubs and a wine cellar. Students also run an active program of social service and community outreach, including such programs as tutoring in local schools and educational visits to remote Indigenous communities.

=== Sport ===
Trinity College participates in many different sports in intercollegiate competition, including Australian rules football, soccer, netball, hockey, athletics, swimming, volleyball, squash, tennis and badminton. The college also has a particularly strong tradition in rowing and rugby. The college has its own multi-purpose synthetic court.

=== College song ===
The current college song was written by the fifth warden, Evan Burge (1974–1996), set to the hymn tune &quot;Thaxted&quot; derived from the &quot;Jupiter&quot; movement from Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;.

&lt;poem&gt;
Where Bishops&#x27; lifts its ivy&#x27;d tower and Clarke&#x27;s long cloisters run.
The College Oak stands spreading forth its branches to the sun.
And here are joy and laughter and loyal friends as well;
The Bulpadock rejoices in our efforts to excel.
And whene&#x27;er we think on all these things wherever we may be,
We shall raise our voices higher and sing of Trinity.

Great God, your spirit fills this earth, your truth can make us free,
O lift us up beyond ourselves to be all we can be.
For you have made and love us, and guide us through all strife,
You gave your Son as one of us, his death’s our source of life.
In friendship bind out hearts in one, a diverse unity,
And make us worthy of your name, O glorious Trinity.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Chapel and choir==
The Choir of Trinity College has become known, especially but not exclusively, for choral music in the tradition of English cathedrals and the collegiate chapels of Oxford and Cambridge universities. The choir sings Evensong in the chapel during term. Choral Evensong at Trinity has become a well-known liturgical event in Melbourne. The choir also performs locally and tours internationally and have made a number of radio broadcasts and CD recordings, including five albums for ABC Classics.

From 1956 to 2016, the college provided liturgical hospitality to a dispersed Anglican congregation, the Canterbury Fellowship. The fellowship&#x27;s choir sang for choral services on Sunday mornings and Evensong out of term time.

<text>Syama Sastri (Telugu : శ్యామ శాస్త్రి; ; 26 April 1762 – 1827) or Shyama Shastri was a musician and composer of Carnatic music. He was the oldest among the Trinity of Carnatic music, Tyagaraja and Muthuswami Dikshitar being the other two.

==Early life and career==
Syama Sastri, whose birth name was Venkata Subrahmanya, was born on 26 April 1762 in a Telugu Brahmin family. He was also known as one of the trinity of carnatic music. To later generations, he is better known by his adopted name Syama Sastri or by his musical mudra (signature) Syama Krishna. He was born in Tiruvarur, in what is now the state of Tamil Nadu. He received his instruction in the vedas, astrology, and other traditional subjects early on and learned music from his maternal uncle. He was later trained in music by Adiappayya, a noted durbar musician of Thanjavur.
Although Śyāma Śastri did not compose as many &quot;kritis&quot; as his two prolific contemporaries, his compositions are still well known due to the literary, melodic and rhythmic proficiency observed in them. It is said that he composed about three hundred pieces in all.

He did not have many disciples to propagate his compositions, nor was the printing press widely accessible during his time. More importantly, the scholarly nature of his compositions made them more appealing to the learned than to the lay. Additionally, they feature a more formal form of Telugu which borrows heavily from Sanskrit. In contrast, Tyagaraja composes in generally more colloquial dialect of Telugu.

There are also a number of krithis in Tamil attributed to him. Most of his compositions propitiate the Goddess Kamakshi.

He composed &quot;kritis&quot;, &quot;varṇa(s)&quot; and &quot;svarajati(s)&quot; with the &quot;ankita&quot; or &quot;mudra&quot; (signature) Śyāma Krishna. He was probably the first to compose in a new form of the &quot;svarajati&quot; musical genre, where the compositions could be rendered solely in a singing or instrumental manner. Prior to this, the &quot;svarajati&quot; was primarily a dance form, and was close in structure to the dance &quot;Varṇaṃ&quot; (&quot;padavarṇaṃ&quot;).

His set of three famous &quot;svarajati(s)&quot; are intended to be sung in concert rather than danced, and are sometimes referred to as &quot;Ratnatrayam&quot; (Three jewels). They are &quot;Kāmākṣhī Anudinamu&quot;, &quot;Kāmākṣhī Padayugamē&quot;, and &quot;Rāvē himagiri kumāri&quot;, composed in the &quot;ragas&quot; &quot;Bhairavi&quot;, &quot;Yadukula kambhoji&quot; and &quot;Todi&quot; respectively. The former two are set to &quot;Miśra Cāpu Tāḷa&quot;, while the third is set to &quot;Ādi Tāḷa&quot;.

He is known for his ability to compose in the most complex of tāḷas.

==Legacy==

Sastri had a number of disciples who excelled at the art. Alasur Krishna Iyer became a musician at the royal durbar in Mysore. Porambur Krishna Iyer popularised many of his guru&#x27;s works. Another disciple, Talagambadi Panchanada Iyer also made his mark as a composer. Another disciple named Dasari gained fame as a noted nāgaswaram player. His son, named Subbaraaya Shaastree, was also a notable composer.

<text>Monica and Friends (), previously published as Monica&#x27;s Gang in Anglophone territories and as Frizz and Friends in London, is a Brazilian comic book series and media franchise created by Mauricio de Sousa.

The series originated in a comic strip first published by the newspaper Folha da Manhã in 1959, in which the protagonists were Blu (&quot;Bidu&quot;) and Franklin (&quot;Franjinha&quot;), however, in the following years the series was shaped towards its current identity with the introduction of new characters such as Monica (&quot;Mônica&quot;) and Jimmy Five (&quot;Cebolinha&quot;) who became the new protagonists. The stories revolve around a group of children who live in a fictional neighborhood in São Paulo known as Lemon Tree District (&quot;Bairro do Limoeiro&quot;) which has a street with the same name called Lemon Tree Street (&quot;Rua do Limoeiro&quot;) where Monica and her several friends live, inspired by the neighborhood of Cambuí in Campinas and the city of Mogi das Cruzes, where Mauricio spent his childhood.

Although the title of the franchise mainly refers to the core group of children who live on Lemon Tree Street, it&#x27;s also used as an umbrella title who encompasses other works created by Mauricio throughout his career such as &quot;Chuck Billy &#x27;n&#x27; Folks&quot;, &quot;Tina&#x27;s Pals&quot;, &quot;Lionel&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Bug-a-Booo&quot;, &quot;The Cavern Clan&quot;, &quot;Bubbly the Astronaut&quot;, &quot;Horacio&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;The Tribe&quot;, and others, since stories from these series are frequently published in comics focused in characters such as Monica, Jimmy Five, Smudge, Maggy and Chuck Billy. Since 1970, in the form of comic books, the characters have been published by publishers such as Abril (1970-1986), Globo (1987-2006) and Panini Comics (2007-present), totaling almost 2,000 issues already published for each character.

The English title of the series was later changed to &quot;Monica and Friends&quot;. The characters and comics were subsequently adapted into, among other media, an animated television series as well as films, most of which are anthologies.

In 2008, a spin-off series, &quot;Monica Teen&quot;, was created in a manga style and features the characters as teenagers.

&quot;Monica&quot; is considered the most well-known comic book character in Brazil. In 2015 alone, the characters were used on three million products for over 150 companies. Nowadays the comics are sold in 40 countries in 14 languages.

== Publication history ==
Maurício de Sousa, then-reporter for Folha da Manhã, in 1959, decided to enter the field of comics hitherto disputed in the country. In the same year made his first characters Blu and Franklin, and decided that Blu would be the protagonist. Both were based on his own childhood, Franklin based on Maurício himself and Blu on his pet dog Cuíca. The main inspirations of &quot;Monica and Friends&quot; were through American comics like &quot;Peanuts&quot; and &quot;Little Lulu&quot;, which have inspired some recurring themes like the boys&#x27; club. In the following year of 1960, the characters gained ground through the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Zaz Traz&quot; by publisher Editora Outubro, later getting their own comic titled &quot;Bidu&quot; by Editora Continental. However, the magazines were canceled that same year.

After that the characters returned to newspaper strips, the character Jimmy Five which had won great popularity in the previous magazines has become protagonist of their own strips of newspaper next to Blu and Franklin in 1961. Seeing potential in the character, Mauricio went on to create several supporting characters to appear in the Jimmy Five strips, like Smudge and Specs. But after so long Maurício received a complaint for the lack of feminine characters in his comics. So to avoid further controversy, in 1963 Monica was created, initially as a supporting character in the Jimmy Five strips (at first as the Specs&#x27; little sister) based on Mauricio&#x27;s real daughter Mônica Sousa. Over time, the success and the charisma of the character made her be the protagonist of the series alongside Jimmy Five which became her sidekick. Also in 1963, Mauricio began to create new projects of comic strips with other characters without links with Monica and Jimmy Five, like &quot;Zezinho and Hiroshi&quot; (now called Chuck Billy &#x27;n&#x27; Folks), &quot;The Cavern Clan&quot;, &quot;Bug-a-Booo&quot;, &quot;The Tribe&quot; and &quot;Raposão&quot; (now called Lionel&#x27;s Kingdom).
The characters only returned to be published in a monthly comic book from 1970, by publisher Abril, initially under the title of &quot;Mônica e Sua Turma&quot; (Monica and Her Gang), later being changed to &quot;Mônica&quot; and &quot;Turma da Mônica&quot; (Monica&#x27;s Gang), the latter title used only for merchandising. With so many of the characters ever created by Mauricio in strips of newspaper also began to appear in the comics of Monica&#x27;s Gang. At that time the area of comics was more competitive in Brazil, many Brazilian artists were trying to hold his own in the stalls along the publications of American comics like Donald Duck, José Carioca, Little Lulu, and many others. Even with these new comics, Monica&#x27;s Gang remained with their good sales on newsstands and with this soon came to the Jimmy Five&#x27;s solo comic book three years later. Sales were great and with that a contract with the footballer Pelé was made for the launch of a character based on him, the &quot;Pelezinho&quot;, which was a phenomenon among children at the time, marking time in the history of Brazilian comics. Pelezinho was one of the few black characters made by Maurício, and his design wasn&#x27;t the most flattering to the black community, with a pale colored circle around the character&#x27;s mouth to represent his lips, a concept made infamous by the black face depiction of African people. In late 2013, however, Pelezinho&#x27;s design was updated to reflect more modern sensibilities.

The staff of cartoonists has grown, leading to the foundation of the Estúdios Maurício de Sousa, that produce comics with the characters created by Mauricio de Sousa, and other marketing projects and cartoons of the characters. The first attempts to make a Monica and Friends cartoon occurred in the late 60s during a deal with Cica food company that produced some commercials for television, these being commercial who originated the character Thunder, who is currently a main character of the Lionel&#x27;s Kingdom stories. The first film was only released in 1982, &quot;As Aventuras da Turma da Mônica&quot; which was produced in partnership with &quot;Black &amp; White &amp; Color&quot; and distributed by Embrafilme.

Over the years, other characters gained their own comic books, like Smudge (1982), Chuck Billy (1982) and Maggy (1989). Other media have strengthened over the years and Monica-branded merchandise were launched, with products like books, toys, discs, CD-ROM and video games. A Monica-themed amusement park was created in 1993 in São Paulo, titled &quot;Parque da Mônica&quot; (Monica Park). In 2008 the franchise received a manga-style comic entitled Monica Teen.

== Characters ==
The &quot;Monica and Friends&quot; series has an extensive amount of main and secondary characters. It has as main protagonists Monica, Jimmy Five, Smudge and Maggy and each has its own comic book. Currently the character Milena was recently added as the fifth main character of the group. Other characters from other series created by Mauricio de Sousa are also included on Monica and Friends, making crossovers or quotations from each other in several stories, among several other characters. The main setting of the stories is the fictional Lemon Tree Street (&quot;Rua do Limoeiro&quot;).

Most stories focus on the daily lives of the main characters and occasionally on the secondary characters; the humour usually uses various types of repetitions, allusions, appeals to the nonsense, paranomasias, sarcasm and metalanguage. The stories with Monica and Jimmy Five revolve around the conflict between the two. Jimmy Five is a troublemaker and bully who always tries to scold Monica or steal her stuffed bunny to give knots in its ears (usually having Smudge or another boy accomplice), always having Monica get her revenge by hitting him with her stuffed bunny, often leaving him bruised and with black eyes. Often Jimmy Five makes plans against her with various traps, sometimes using Franklin&#x27;s inventions or talking Smudge into helping, but he always loses to Monica at the end.

Smudge&#x27;s stories often focus on his penchant for dirt and mess and his fear of water, having never bathed in his life, and constantly being threatened by villains or his friends to take a shower, with him always succeeding in not getting wet and staying dirty. The stories with Maggy generally focus on her gluttony, with a superhuman ability to eat more than a normal person without ever getting fat and sometimes stealing food from her friends.

Among the villains are Captain Fray, a supervillain with the power to control garbage and dirt, and Lord Raider, a space rabbit whose first appearance was in the movies. A joke often breaks the fourth wall.

=== Publications ===

Monica and Friends and its related works are released in a number of different books. Firstly, they were published by Editora Abril, from 1970 to 1986, then Editora Globo, from 1987 to 2006. From 2007 on, Panini Comics was chosen to keep the publications. So far there are comic books starring many characters, among the best known and sold are the characters of Monica, Jimmy Five, Smudge, Maggy and Chuck Billy, plus almanacs with republication of classic stories with varying characters. In 2015 was released an app for smartphones gathering more than 500 editions of comics franchise for download.

=== Television and film adaptations ===
The characters of Monica and Friends are also the protagonists of which can be considered the first Brazilian animation series. After being introduced on television as advertising-boys in TV advertisements from the mid-1960s, complete stories began to be produced in 1976 and distributed through film-compilations during the 1980s and 1990s (initially released in movies in cinema in the 1980s and then directly to video in the 1990s).

In 1999, a series of shorts with the characters was produced to the children&#x27;s programming of Rede Globo (which would display these episodes only between the years 2010 and 2014). A regular broadcast of the series on TV only occurred in 2004 after negotiations with the Cartoon Network that since this year began broadcasting new episodes exclusively on the channel, still remaining on the schedule together of sister channels Tooncast (currently transmitted in &quot;Cartoon Cartoons&quot; block) and Boomerang.

In addition to the animations, the characters also starred in two animated feature films who presents bigger stories instead of short compilations; these are: &quot;&quot;The Princess and the Robot&quot; (1984) and &quot;Monica&#x27;s Gang in an Adventure in Time&quot; (2007) - as well as two TV and video specials in live-action: &quot;Mônica e Cebolinha: No Mundo de Romeu e Julieta&quot; (1979) and &quot;A Rádio do Chico Bento&quot;&quot; (1989).

In September 2010, Tec Toy announced that they would produce an exclusive game for videogame console Zeebo &quot;Turma da Mônica - Vamos Brincar Nº1&quot;, but the game was canceled months later. The idea was to create a series of eight puzzle games, but due to the end of the island the project was canceled.

== Monica Park ==
An amusement park themed with Mauricio de Sousa&#x27;s characters is located at the Eldorado Shopping in São Paulo. It was opened in January 1993, and features a number of attractions, like the &quot;Carrossel do Horácio&quot; (Horacio&#x27;s merry-go-round, a carousel featuring dinosaurs instead of horses), the 3-D cinema, and many more. The Parque da Mônica of Curitiba and of Rio de Janeiro were also created, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, but both were closed, in 2000 and 2005, respectively. Until the end of 2006, it had its own comic book, featuring adventures of Monica and her friends at the park. When Panini Comics started to publish Mauricio&#x27;s works, this comic was replaced by &quot;Turma da Mônica&quot; (Monica and Friends).

The park was removed from Eldorado Shopping Center on early 2010, when the space occupied by it was asked back by the shopping administrators. Mauricio de Sousa had already announced that the mall had requested the area back in July 2009. The administration of the Shopping said that the mall was seeking more up-to-date alternatives, which fall under consumers&#x27; expectations.

In March 2015, it was announced that the park would be reopened at Shopping SP Market.

== Merchandising ==
In the late 60s a line of dolls with characters Monica, Jimmy Five, Thunder, Horacio and Lucinda was manufactured by &quot;Trol Company&quot;, this was the first merchandising of the franchise. The character Thunder became mascot of a tomato sauce brand of the food company Cica in the late of 60s. An extensive line of toys and other products with the characters began to be manufactured since the 70s by various toy companies and remain heavily sold to the present in Brazilian stores.
During the 80s, the franchise also came to have its own store network. The Lojinha da Mônica and Trenzinho da Mônica, had branches in several states of Brazil, selling products related to characters. In 2013, the franchise was restarted in the form of an e-commerce portal. 

=== Food products ===
In addition to Cica, Mauricio has formed long-lasting partnerships, providing his characters for a series of food products such as alfajores, pasta, cookies, etc. In 1993, a brand of chocolate bars was launched in partnership with Nestlé with the characters printed in white chocolate on each bar, although it was discontinued after the 90s the brand became memorable among many who grew up in the decade to the point that many fans asked for the brand to return, the chocolate was announced to have a return at the end of 2017, but this did not happen.

In 1994 Mauricio formed a partnership with the fruit company Fischer to sell small selected apples to children with their characters printed on the packaging. The brand became popular to the point of selling 900 thousand tons of packages every month, according to Mauricio his idea came when he visited a farm that produced smaller apples that were used to produce paste, fertilizer or animal food, however, Mauricio decided to target these apples to children.

== International distribution ==
Monica and Friends and related works have been published in 40 countries in 14 languages, including Spanish, Greek and Japanese.

In Germany, comics were published between 1975 and 1980 under the name &quot;Fratz und Freunde&quot; and years later as &quot;Monica und Ihre Freunde&quot;. In the UK, comics have already been published under the name &quot;Frizz and Friends&quot; for a short time. In Italy, some comic books and classic episodes of cartoon were distributed on DVDs in the 90s, the cartoon was broadcast on Rai Due channel under the title &quot;La Banda di Monica&quot;. In Indonesia, the series is published under the title &quot;Monika dan kawan kawan&quot;, the comics are published there since 1997, along the comic books of the characters &quot;Jimmi Lima&quot; (Jimmy Five) and &quot;Ciko Bento&quot; (Chuck Billy N&#x27; Folks). In China the comics were distributed to schools in 2007, receiving years later adaptation of the cartoon, in 2011 one of the albums was awarded to children&#x27;s literature.

Episodes of the cartoon dubbed in English are available on YouTube.

<doc id="597758" wikidata="Q720235" url="?curid=597758" title="Holden Caulfield">
<text>Holden Caulfield (identified as &quot;Holden Morrisey Caulfield&quot; in the story &quot;Slight Rebellion Off Madison&quot;, and &quot;Holden V. Caulfield&quot; in &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;) is a fictional character in the works of author J. D. Salinger. He is most famous for his appearance as the antihero protagonist and narrator of the 1951 novel &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. Since the book&#x27;s publication, Holden has become an icon for teenage rebellion and angst, and is considered among the most important characters of 20th-century American literature. The name Holden Caulfield was initially used in an unpublished short story written in 1941 and first appeared in print in 1945.

Salinger&#x27;s various stories (and one novel) featuring a character named Holden Caulfield do not share a cohesive timeline, and details about &quot;Holden Caulfield&quot; and his family are often inconsistent or completely contradictory from one story to another. Most notably, in some Salinger short stories &quot;Holden Caulfield&quot; is a soldier in World War II who was missing in action in 1944—something that is thoroughly impossible to have happened to the 16-year-old Holden Caulfield of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, which is set in 1948 or 1949.

Salinger&#x27;s first published Holden Caulfield story, &quot;I&#x27;m Crazy&quot;, appeared in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on December 22, 1945. It is sometimes mistakenly reported that the name &quot;Holden Caulfield&quot; was derived by Salinger from a marquee or poster for the film &quot;Dear Ruth&quot;, starring William Holden and Joan Caulfield, but &quot;Dear Ruth&quot; was released in 1947, more than a year-and-a-half after Holden Caulfield&#x27;s first appearance in print, and more than six years after Salinger&#x27;s first unpublished short story was written using this name for a character.

==In &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;==
Holden Caulfield is the narrator and main character of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. The novel recounts Holden&#x27;s week in New York City during Christmas break, circa 1948/1949, following his expulsion from Pencey Prep, a preparatory school in Pennsylvania based loosely on Salinger&#x27;s alma mater Valley Forge Military Academy. Holden Caulfield tells his story with surprising honesty from a sanatorium in California in a cynical and jaded language.

==In other works==
Several early pieces featuring Holden Caulfield formed the basis of parts of &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, but were rewritten for the novel.

The character, as Holden Caulfield, appears in Salinger&#x27;s &quot;Slight Rebellion off Madison&quot;, published in the December 21, 1946, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. An earlier version of this story, titled &quot;Are You Banging Your Head Against a Wall?&quot; was accepted for publication by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in October 1941, but was not published then because editors found the tone to be too desolate for its readership. An edited version of this short story later became the basis of several chapters in the middle-late section of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; dealing with Caulfield&#x27;s date with Sally Hayes, during which he confesses his desire to run away with her, meets Carl Luce for drinks, and makes a drunken phone call to the Hayes&#x27; home. Unlike the similar sequence in the novel, Caulfield is on a Christmas break from school, and, in the story, the interlude with Sally is split into two occurrences. Also, the meeting with Carl Luce is considerably briefer in the story than in the novel.

Caulfield also figures as a character in the short story &quot;I&#x27;m Crazy&quot;, published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; (December 22, 1945), and other members of the Caulfield family are featured in &quot;Last Day of the Last Furlough&quot;, published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; (July 15, 1944) and the unpublished short stories &quot;The Last and Best of the Peter Pans&quot; (c. 1942) and &quot;The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls&quot; (c. 1945). &quot;I&#x27;m Crazy&quot; is closely related to the first chapter of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. It begins with Caulfield standing on a hill at Pencey Prep watching a football game below, and develops as Holden visits with his history teacher, Mr. Spencer, for a talk about his expulsion from school and his future. Several other details match those found in the first chapter of &quot;Catcher&quot;, including a reference to the mother of one of Caulfield&#x27;s schoolmates and to his own mother sending him a gift of ice skates, but the story ends with his returning home instead of running away from school. Once home, he is not shown confronting his parents, who, according to the maid, are playing bridge. Instead, he goes to speak to Phoebe. Their dialogue is similar to that which appears in the later chapters of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. The other notable feature of the story is that his sister Viola gets her first, and only, mention in the Caulfield saga.

&quot;This Sandwich Has No Mayonnaise&quot; (&quot;Esquire&quot;, 1945) has a mention of Holden missing in action during the war.

==Caulfield family in other works==
&quot;Last Day of the Last Furlough&quot; relates the final day of Babe Gladwaller before he leaves to fight in World War II. Gladwaller spends part of the day with his little sister before Vincent Caulfield arrives. At that point Vincent is a fellow soldier about to leave for the war. Vincent announces that his brother, Holden, has been declared missing in action. There is some ambiguity here because Holden is both alive and a high school student in &quot;Catcher&quot;, which was written and published after the war, so it is not possible for him to have been a soldier during the 1940s and a high school student in the early 50s.

It is unclear how many Caulfield children there are and who is who. For instance, many have speculated that Holden&#x27;s brother, D.B., is actually Vincent. However, Salinger wrote that Vincent died in World War II, and &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; was published in 1951. At that time, D.B. is alive and working as a writer in Hollywood. Gladwaller&#x27;s relationship with his younger sister can be seen as a parallel to Caulfield&#x27;s relationship with Phoebe.

&quot;The Last and Best of the Peter Pans&quot; relates the story of Vincent&#x27;s draft questionnaire being hidden by his mother. The events occur just after the death of Kenneth (later renamed Allie) and reveal the anxiety of Mary Moriarity, an actress and Caulfield&#x27;s mother. The story is notable for the appearance of Phoebe and Vincent&#x27;s statements about a child crawling off a cliff.

In &quot;The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls&quot;, Vincent (D.B.) recalls the day his brother Kenneth (Allie) died. The story is set at the Caulfield summer home on Cape Cod. Several details make their way from this story into &quot;Catcher&quot;, including the characterization of Allie; Allie&#x27;s poetry-inscribed left-handed baseball mitt; Vincent&#x27;s girlfriend, Helen, who keeps her kings in the back row (like Jane Gallagher); and Caulfield&#x27;s critical view of others. While the cause of death in &quot;Catcher&quot; is leukemia, here it is due to an unspecified heart condition. Toward the end of the story, Kenneth and Vincent are on the beach. Kenneth decides to go swimming and is knocked out by a wave. Holden, just home from camp, is waiting on the porch with his suitcases as Vincent comes back with Kenneth&#x27;s unconscious body. Kenneth dies later the same night. The story was reportedly sold to a magazine, only to be taken back by Salinger before publication.

Another short story of note with relationship to Caulfield is &quot;The Boy in the People Shooting Hat&quot;, which was submitted to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; sometime between 1948 and 1949 but was never published. It focuses on a fight between two characters named Bobby and Stradlater over Bobby&#x27;s feelings about Jane Gallagher. This story appears to form the basis for several key scenes in the first several chapters of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;.

In &quot;Seymour: An Introduction&quot; a Curtis Caulfield is mentioned in passing as &quot;an exceptionally intelligent and likable boy&quot; who appeared on the same radio show as Seymour and the other Glass children. He is reportedly &quot;killed during one of the landings in the Pacific&quot;. It is possible that Vincent is renamed Curtis, as &quot;Seymour&quot; was published in 1959, and both Curtis and Vincent are killed in the Pacific during World War II. None of Salinger&#x27;s works to date have clarified exactly how many Caulfied children there were or who (aside from the Kenneth/Allie 
character) might have been the same person, but simply renamed in a later work.

In &quot;The Stranger&quot;, published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; December 1, 1945, Babe Gladwaller and his sister Mattie (a prototype for Phoebe) visit Vincent Caulfield&#x27;s former girlfriend, now married, to tell her about his death and deliver a poem he wrote about her.

==Cultural impact==
Holden Caulfield is one of the most enduring characters in 20th-century American fiction. It has been suggested that Salinger himself related so closely to Holden that he was protective of the character. This was the reason he was unwilling to allow filming of the book or use of the character by other writers.

Green Day wrote a song titled &quot;Who Wrote Holden Caulfield?&quot; for their second studio album, &quot;Kerplunk&quot; (1991) after lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong read &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. Initially, he gave up on reading it after dropping out from Pinole Valley High School when he was 18 years old.

<text>A travel agency is a private retailer or public service that provides travel and tourism-related services to the general public on behalf of accommodation or travel suppliers to offer different kinds of travelling packages for each destination.

Travel agencies can provide outdoor recreation, arranging logistics for luggage and medical items delivery for travellers upon request, public transport timetables, car rentals, and bureau de change services. Travel agencies can also serve as general sales agents for airlines that do not have offices in a specific region. A travel agency&#x27;s main function is to act as an agent, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. They are also called Travel Advisors. They do not keep inventory in-hand unless they have pre-booked hotel rooms or cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a wedding, honeymoon, or other group event.

== Business model ==
Travel agencies often receive commissions and other benefits and incentives from providers or may charge a fee to the end users. Hotel owners and tour operators typically pay a higher commission rate to travel agencies, whereas airlines typically pay no commission. The customer is normally not made aware of how much the travel agent is earning in commissions and other benefits. A 2016 survey of 1,193 travel agents in the United States found that on average 78% of their revenue was from commissions and 22% was generated from fees.

== Accreditation number ==
Travel agencies are recognized by vendors through their accreditation numbers. In the United States, the main accreditation numbers are issued by Airline Reporting Corporation, Cruise Lines International Association, International Air Transport Association.

If more than one travel agency is booking under the same accreditation number, the agency of record is called a host agency. This is a popular model in the United States, with surveys show anywhere from 43-85% of leisure agencies now booking under a host agency. 

== Travel technology ==
Travel agencies use the services of the major computer reservations systems, also known as global distribution systems (GDS), including: Amadeus CRS, Galileo GDS, Sabre, and Worldspan, which is a subsidiary of Travelport, which allow for comparison and sorting of hotel and flight rates with multiple companies. Bookings made via travel agents, including online travel agents, may or may not be confirmed instantly. Unlike online travel agencies, metasearch engines and scraper sites, such as Skyscanner, Kayak.com, Rome2rio, and TripAdvisor, travel agencies may or may not have their own booking engine, and instead provide results for search queries and then divert traffic to service providers or online travel agencies for booking. Travel agents may also work with airline consolidators.

Some companies use technology to promote sustainable tourism and bring carbon-neutrality.

== Types of travel agencies ==

=== Traditional travel agencies ===
A traditional travel agent may work for a travel agency or work freelance. Many traditional agents prefer the term &quot;travel advisor&quot; as opposed to &quot;travel agent&quot; to emphasize their advice, expertise, and connections that are of great value. While most point-to-point travel is now booked online, traditional agents specialize in niche markets such as corporate travel, luxury travel, cruises, complicated and important trips, and specialty trips. Other niche markets for traditional travel agencies include travelers with disabilities, travelers over the age of 60, women traveling alone, LGBT tourism, or a particular group interested in a similar activity, such as a sport.

=== Franchise travel agencies ===
Helloworld Travel is an example of a franchised travel agency, giving agents access to internal systems for product and bookings.

=== Online travel agencies ===
A online travel agency (OTA) uses a platform business model to generate revenue. The Expedia Group is the largest OTA globally. Booking Holdings is the second largest OTA.

==Licensing==
In many countries, all travel agencies are required to be licensed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Many are also bonded and represented by IATA, and, for those that issue air tickets, the Air Travel Organisers&#x27; Licensing (ATOL) in the United Kingdom, and the Airlines Reporting Corporation in the United States also serve those purposes. ABTA – The Travel Association the Association of Canadian Travel Agencies (ACTA) The American Society of Travel Advisors (ASTA), represent travel agencies in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States respectively.

==History==

In 1840, the Abreu Agency was established in Porto by Bernardo Abreu, becoming the world&#x27;s first agency to open its services to the public.

In 1841, Thomas Cook, a Baptist preacher who believed that alcohol was to blame for social problems, reached an agreement with the Midland Railway to organize the transportation of 500 members of his temperance movement from the Leicester Campbell Street railway station to a rally in Loughborough in exchange for a commission. He formed Thomas Cook &amp; Son, which later became The Thomas Cook Group. It filed bankruptcy and underwent liquidation in 2019.

In 1871, Dean and Dawson was founded in the United Kingdom and in the 1950s, it was acquired by Thomas Cook.

In 1999, Expedia went public on the Nasdaq stock exchange. From 1999 to 2006, the number of travel agents in the United States plunged from 124,000 to 88,000 as many Americans switched to making their own travel arrangements online. 

Also in 1999, European airlines began eliminating or reducing commissions, while Singapore Airlines did so in parts of Asia. In 2002, several airlines in the United States did the same, which led to an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging collusion among the airlines, that was decided on appeal in 2009.

In 2007, the launch of the iPhone and related mobile apps increased travel bookings made online.

In 2008, the launch of Airbnb created an online marketplace for spare bedrooms and apartments.

==Outlook==
According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2022, there were 66,300 people who were employed as travel agents for their full-time jobs. That number is projected to increase by 3% over the next 10 years. In 2022, the BLS lists the median travel agent salary as $46,400 per year. 

Host Agency Reviews lists employee salaries by compensation structure, listing the 2022 income for travel agents that earn salary + commissions (25% of travel advisor employees) at $88,909, those that earn salary/hourly only at $50,792 (44% of employee travel agents), and commission only travel employees at $21,932 (31%). 

However, job prospects should be best for travel agents who specialize in specific destinations or particular types of travelers. 

Several reports show that the number of people using travel agents to book travel has been increasing.

<text>A shruti box (sruti box, shrutibox, srutibox or surpeti) is a musical instrument, originating from the Indian subcontinent, that traditionally works on a system of bellows. It is similar to a harmonium and is used to provide a drone in a practice session or concert of Indian classical music. It is used as an accompaniment to other instruments and notably the flute. The shruti box is also used in classical singing. In classical singing, the shruti box is used to help tune the voice. The use of the shruti box has widened with the cross-cultural influences of world music and new-age music to provide a drone for many other instruments as well as vocalists and mantra singing.

Adjustable buttons allow tuning. Nowadays, electronic shruti boxes are commonly used, which are called &quot;shruthi pettige&quot; in Kannada, &quot;shruti petti&quot; in Tamil, Malayalam, and Telugu, and &quot;sur peti&quot; in Hindi.
Recent versions also allow for changes to be made in the tempo, and the notes such as Madhyamam, Nishadam to be played in place of the usual three notes (i.e., lower shadjam, panchamam, and the upper shadjam).

==History==
Before the arrival of the harmonium in the Indian subcontinent, musicians used either a tambura or a specific pitch reference instrument, such as the nadaswaram, to produce the drone. Some forms of music such as Yakshagana used the pungi reed pipe as drone. After the Western small pump harmonium became popular, musicians would modify the harmonium to automatically produce the reference pitch. Typically, one would open up the cover and adjust the stop of the harmonium to produce a drone.

Later, a keyless version of the harmonium was invented for the specific purpose of producing the drone sound. It was given the name shruti box or sruti box. These types of instruments had controls on the top or on the side of the box for controlling the pitch.

The shruti box is enjoying a renaissance in the West among traditional and contemporary musicians, who are using it for a range of different styles. In the early nineties, traditional Irish singer Nóirín Ní Riain brought the shruti box to Ireland, giving it a minor place in traditional Irish music. More recently Scottish folk artists Karine Polwart and Julie Fowlis used the instrument on some of their songs. Singers find it very useful as an accompaniment and instrumentalists enjoy the drone reference it gives to play along with.

<text>Giovanni da Pian del Carpine (or Carpini; anglicised as &quot;John of Plano Carpini&quot;;  – 1 August 1252) was a medieval Italian diplomat, Catholic archbishop, explorer and one of the first Europeans to enter the court of the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire. He was the author of the earliest important Western account of northern and Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and other regions of the Mongol dominion. He served as the Primate of Serbia, based in Antivari, from 1247 to 1252.

==Life before the journey==
Giovanni appears to have been a native of Umbria, in central Italy. His surname was derived from Pian del Carpine (literally &quot;Hornbeam Plain&quot;), an area known later as Magione, between Perugia and Cortona. He was one of the companions and disciples of his near-contemporary and countryman Saint Francis of Assisi.

Highly esteemed within the Franciscan order, Giovanni had a prominent role in the propagation of its teachings in northern Europe, holding in succession the offices of warden (&quot;custos&quot;) in Saxony and provincial (&quot;minister&quot;) of Germany. He may also have held positions in Barbary and Cologne, and been provincial of Spain.

==Background to his travels==
Giovanni was a provincial of Germany at the time of the great Mongol invasion of eastern Europe and the Battle of Legnica (modern Legnickie Pole) on 9 April 1241. The defeat of European forces at Legnica almost led to Ögedei, Khan of the Mongol Empire, controlling most of Eastern Europe.

In Europe, dread of the &quot;Tatars&quot; (Mongols) was still widespread four years later, when Pope Innocent IV decided to dispatch the first formal Catholic mission to the Mongols. The missionaries were sent partly in protest at the Mongol invasion of Christendom and partly to gain information regarding the Khan&#x27;s intentions and military strength.

==Travels==
Pope Innocent IV chose Giovanni to head the mission and apparently he was in charge of nearly everything in the mission. As a papal legate, he bore a letter from the Pope to the Great Khan, &quot;Cum non solum&quot;. &quot;At the age of sixty-three Carpini embarked from Lyon,&quot; where the Pope then resided, on Easter day (16 April 1245), accompanied by another friar, Stephen of Bohemia, who broke down at Kaniv near Kiev and was left behind. After seeking counsel of an old friend, Wenceslaus, king of Bohemia, Giovanni was joined at Wrocław by another Franciscan, Benedykt Polak, who was appointed to act as interpreter.

The route passed by Kiev, entered the Tatar posts at Kaniv and then ran across the Nepere to the Don and Volga. Giovanni is the first Westerner to give the modern names for those rivers. On the Volga stood the Ordu, or camp, of Batu, the famous conqueror of eastern Europe and supreme Mongol commander on the western frontiers of the empire. He was one of the most senior princes of the house of Genghis Khan. There, the envoys, with their presents, had to pass between two fires to remove possible injurious thoughts and poisons, before being presented to the prince (early April 1246).
Batu ordered them to proceed to the court of the supreme Khan in Mongolia. On Easter day once more (8 April 1246), they started on the second and most formidable part of their journey. They were &quot;so ill&quot;, wrote the legate, &quot;that we could scarcely sit a horse; and throughout all that Lent our food had been nought but millet with salt and water, and with only snow melted in a kettle for drink&quot;. Their bodies were tightly bandaged so that they could endure the excessive fatigue of the enormous ride, which took them across the Jaec, or Ural River and north of the Caspian Sea and the Aral to the Jaxartes or Syr Darya (&quot;quidam fluvius magnus cujus nomen ignoramus&quot;, &quot;a big river whose name we do not know&quot;) and the Muslim cities that stood on its banks. Then they went along the shores of the lakes of Dzungaria until, on the feast of St Mary Magdalene (22 July), they reached the imperial camp called Sira Orda (Yellow Pavilion), near Karakorum and the Orkhon River. Giovanni and his companions rode an estimated 3000 miles in 106 days.

Since the death of Ögedei Khan, the imperial authority was in interregnum and Güyük, Ögedei&#x27;s eldest son, was designated to the throne. His formal election in a great Kurultai, or diet of the tribes, took place while the friars were at Sira Orda, which entailed the gathering of 3000 to 4000 envoys and deputies from all parts of Asia and eastern Europe, bearing homage, tribute and presents. On 24 August they witnessed the formal enthronement at another camp in the vicinity called the Golden Ordu, and they were then presented to the new emperor.

The great Khan, Güyük, refused the invitation to become Christian and demanded rather that the Pope and rulers of Europe should come to him and swear allegiance to him, a demand recorded in a letter from Güyük Khan to Pope Innocent IV. The Khan did not dismiss the expedition until November. He gave them a letter to the Pope written in Mongol and copied into Persian and Latin that was a brief imperious assertion of the Khan&#x27;s office as the scourge of God. They began a long winter journey home. Often, they had to lie on the bare snow or on ground scraped bare of snow with a foot. They reached Kiev on 10 June 1247. There and on their further journey the Slavonic Christians welcomed them as risen from the dead with festive hospitality. Crossing the Rhine at Cologne, they found the Pope still at Lyon and delivered their report and the Khan&#x27;s letter.

Not long afterward, Giovanni was rewarded with the archbishopric of &quot;Primate of Serbia&quot; in Antivari in Dalmatia, and was sent as legate to Louis IX of France. He lived only five years following the hardships of his journey. He died, according to the Franciscan Martyrology and other authorities, on 1 August 1252.

== Books ==
The &quot;Ystoria Mongalorum&quot; is the report compiled by Carpine, of his trip to the Mongol Empire. Written in the 1240s, it is the oldest European account of the Mongols. Carpine was the first European to try to chronicle Mongol history. Two versions of the &quot;Ystoria Mongalorum&quot; are known to exist: Carpine&#x27;s own and another, usually referred to as the &quot;Tartar Relation&quot;.

Erik Hildinger translated Giovanni&#x27;s book into English.

<doc id="597778" wikidata="Q58257" url="?curid=597778" title="Shruti (music)">
<text>The shruti or śruti is the smallest interval of pitch that the human ear can detect and a singer or musical instrument can produce. The concept is found in ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts such as the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, the &quot;Dattilam&quot;, the &quot;Brihaddeshi&quot;, and the &quot;Sangita Ratnakara&quot;. &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot; speaks of the division of the octave in 22 parts.

The &quot;swara&quot; differs from the &quot;shruti&quot;: the &quot;shruti&quot; is the smallest gradation of pitch available, while a &quot;swara&quot; is the selected pitches from which the musician constructs the scales, melodies and &quot;ragas&quot;. The &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; identifies and discusses twenty two &quot;shruti&quot; and seven &quot;swara&quot; per octave.

It has been used in several contexts throughout the history of Indian music. Recent research has more precisely defined the term &quot;shruti&quot;, its difference from &quot;nada&quot; and &quot;swara&quot;, and identified positions on a string to play 22 shrutis.

The most well-known example of shrutis is probably the use of the ati-komal (extra flat) gandhar in raga Darbari. Others include the rishabh in Bhairav, the nishad in Bhimpalasi and Miya Malhar, and the gandhar in Todi.

==Meaning==

The meaning of &quot;shruti&quot; varies in different systems.

===Grama system===
Bharata Muni uses shruti to mean the interval between two notes such that the difference between them is perceptible.

=== Controversy ===
In the current practice of Carnatic music, &quot;shruti&quot; has several meanings.

In certain ragas, due to inflexions or gamakas on some of those 12 notes, listeners perceive a sharpened or flattened version of an existing note.

Some scientific evidence shows that these intermediate tones perceived in the contemporary rendition of a raga do not hint at the existence of 22 shrutis. The number 22 is not practically significant in the current performance of Carnatic and Hindustani music traditions, partly because different musicians use slightly different &quot;shrutis&quot; when performing the same raga, an example being the ati-komal (extra flat) gandhar in Darbari. The phenomenon of intermediate tones is pursued as an active area of research in Indian Musicology, which says the number of perceptible intermediate tones may be less or more than 22.

An Indian monograph about shruti claims various opinions about the number of shrutis. In recent times the number is broadly agreed upon to be 22. Recognizing the controversy over the number and the exact ratios of shruti intervals, it also says that not all &quot;shruti&quot; intervals are equal and known as &quot;pramana shruti&quot; (22%), &quot;nyuna shruti&quot; (70%) and &quot;purana shruti&quot; (90%). Each &quot;shruti&quot; may be approximated in the 53EDO system.

==Relationship to , , and ==

&quot;Shruti&quot; is linked to the fundamental aspects of . Of the twenty two &quot;shruti&quot;, veena scholars identified the 4th &quot;shruti&quot; as the &quot;sa&quot; solfege, 7th as &quot;re&quot;, 9th as &quot;ga&quot;, 13th as &quot;ma&quot;, 17th as &quot;pa&quot;, 20th as &quot;dha&quot;, and 22nd as &quot;ni&quot;.

===Identification of a &quot;shruti&quot;===
In performance, notes identified as one of the 12 universal pitch classes of the chromatic scale (&quot;swara&quot;-&quot;prakara&quot;) are the &quot;shrutis&quot;, and connected unidentified notes between them are &quot;nadas&quot;. The human ear takes about 20–45 msec to identify a note within the range of the human voice—from 100 to 1000 Hz. The ear can identify &quot;shrutis&quot; played or sung longer than that—but cannot identify &quot;nadas&quot; played or sung faster than that limit, but can only hear them. Lack of appreciation of this difference has led to many scientists to opine that because of the meend and the oscillating notes, it is hard to determine the exact numerical frequencies.

===Natural existence of 22 &quot;shrutis&quot; on a string===
In ancient times, &quot;shruti&quot; was described in Sanskrit as &quot;Shruyate iti Shruti&quot;, meaning &quot;What is heard is a shruti&quot;. The &quot;understanding&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; part is the natural fact that on 22 specific points on a string, the perception of notes changes.

Brihaddeshi (Sanskrit) by Pandit Matanga mentions after Shloka 24, in Shrutiprakarana (Chapter on Shrutis) that &quot;[o]nly when the ear understands (the point on the string where perception of the notes changes), does that sound become a Shruti.&quot; He further says that these points on the string are very precise, as in Shloka 28, Chapter 1, in Nadaprakarana (Chapter on Nadas) that &quot;[r]eaching (the point on the string where the perception of the notes changes), and reverting (from there) results in the precision that is called as &#x27;Shruti.&#x27;&quot;

There are 12 universally identifiable musical notes (pitch classes of the chromatic scale or Swara-prakara) in an octave. They indicate &quot;a musical note or scale degree, but Shruti is a more subtle division of the octave&quot;.

===&quot;Poorna&quot;, &quot;pramana&quot; and &quot;nyuna shrutis&quot;===
When the frequency and positions of all 22 &quot;shrutis&quot; are calculated, three ratios exist: 256/243 (Pythagorean limma, Pythagorean diatonic semitone, or Pythagorean minor semitone), 25/24 (a type of just chromatic semitone), and 81/80 (syntonic comma). Out of these, 81/80 operates in the &#x27;region&#x27; of 10 notes and is called &quot;pramana&quot; (, region of the note). The 256/243 ratio is called &quot;poorna&quot; (), and 25/24 &quot;nyuna&quot; (). &quot;Poornas&quot; come between &quot;shrutis&quot; 0–1, 4–5, 8–9, 12–13, 13–14, 17–18, and 21–22, &quot;nyunas&quot; between &quot;shrutis&quot; 2–3, 6–7, 10–11, 15–16, 19–20, and &quot;pramanas&quot; between &quot;shrutis&quot; 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, 9–10, 11–12, 14–15, 16–17, 18–19, 20–21.

===Gamakas===
In any gamaka, only &quot;shrutis&quot; and &quot;nadas&quot; exist. The threshold of identification of a musical note within the range of human voice of 100–1000 Hz is 20–45 msec. &quot;Shrutis&quot; can be identified by the human ear because they are played for this time limit at the fastest. In contrast, connecting &quot;nadas&quot; are played faster than this limit, which prevents the human ear from identifying them. The major difference in the two systems is the way they combine shrutis and connect nadas, resulting in characteristically different music between the styles. Many ancient Sanskrit and Tamil works refer to the 22 &quot;shrutis&quot; as the foundation of the Indian Music Scale.

===Melakarta system===

The system of 72 basic types of singing or playing scales (&quot;thaļas&quot;) evolved with specific mathematical combinations of the universal 12 pitch classes. The selection of the 22 &quot;shrutis&quot; in each of them depends on the &quot;rāga&quot; chosen. The &quot;shrutis&quot; in a &quot;rāga&quot; should be ideally related to each other, by natural ratios 100:125, 100:133.33, 100:150, and 100:166.66. A &quot;rāga&quot; can have a fewer number of notes than in a &quot;thaļa&quot;.

===&quot;Shruti&quot; value ambiguity===
Some suggest that the best way to find the exact positions of shrutis is by analyzing the frequencies players use in actual performances. When different artists performed &quot;rāga&quot; &quot;yaman&quot; on flute, sarangi, sitar, and voice, pitch accuracy was found to be &quot;relative&quot; and &quot;subjective&quot;, and &quot;neither rigidly fixed&quot; &quot;nor randomly varying&quot;; the &quot;same Swara was pitched differently at different times by the same artiste in the same raga&quot;, and &quot;different artistes intoned the same swara differently in the same raga&quot;.

<text>The ghaṭam (Sanskrit: घटm &quot;ghaṭ&quot;; Kannada: ಘಟ &quot;ghaṭa&quot;; Tamil: கடம் &quot;ghatam&quot;; Telugu: ఘటం &quot;ghataṃ&quot;; Malayalam: ഘടം &quot;ghataṃ&quot;) is a percussion instrument used in various repertoires across the Indian subcontinent, especially in Southern India . Its variant is played in Punjab and known as &quot;gharha&quot; as it is a part of Punjabi folk traditions. Its analogue in Rajasthan is known as the &quot;madga&quot; and &quot;pani mataqa&quot; (&quot;water jug&quot;).

The ghatam is one of the most ancient percussion instruments in Pakistan and India. It is a clay pot with a narrow mouth. From the mouth, it slants outwards to form a ridge. Made mainly of clay baked with brass or copper filings with a small amount of iron filings, the pitch of the ghatam varies according to its size. The pitch can be slightly altered by the application of plasticine clay or water.

Although the ghatam is the same shape as an ordinary Indian domestic clay pot, it is made specifically to be played as an instrument. The tone of the pot must be good and the walls should be of even thickness to produce an even tone and nice sound.

Ghatams are mostly manufactured in Manamadurai, a place near Madurai in Tamil Nadu. Though this instrument is manufactured in other places like Chennai and Bangalore, too, Manamadurai ghatams have special tonal quality. It is believed that the mud is of special quality. The Manamadurai ghaṭam is a heavy, thick pot with tiny shards of brass mixed into the clay. This type of ghaṭam is harder to play but produces a sharp metallic ringing sound which is favored by some players.

==Playing==
The pot is usually placed on the lap of the performer, with the mouth of the instrument facing the belly of the performer. The performer uses their fingers, thumbs, palms, and heels of the hands to strike its outer surface to produce different sounds. Different tones can be produced by hitting areas of the pot with different parts of the hands. Sometimes the ghatam is turned around so that the mouth faces towards the audience and the performer plays on the neck of the instrument. The ghatam can be moved to multiple different positions while being played. Occasionally, the performer will, to the amusement of the audience, toss the instrument up in the air and catch it. The ghatam is ideal for playing rhythmic patterns in very fast tempo.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;ghaṭam&quot; is etymologically derived from the Sanskrit term &quot;ghaṭa&quot; (pot) and the related term, &quot;kuṇḍa&quot; (pitcher). The cognate term for pot in Tamil is &quot;kuḍam&quot; (water pot). It is noteworthy that in Tamil the term &quot;ghaṭam&quot; specifically carries the meaning of a percussive musical instrument, although in Sanskrit it is a generic word for a pot of any kind.

==Similar instruments==
The &quot;madga&quot; is a north Indian version of the south Indian &quot;ghaṭam&quot; and is made from a very special clay. The maker sometimes adds some kind of metal or graphite dust to the clay which is responsible for the blue-gray appearance and for the special sound.

The &quot;madga&quot; can be played similarly to the &quot;ghaṭam&quot;. Loud bass tones can be produced if one hits with the flat hand the opening at the top of the instrument. The madga can be played with mallets (sticks) and there are many sounds which can be produced with this instrument. It is thinner than a ghaṭam but very stable and not as fragile as one might think.

In Gujarat and Rajasthan,
