<text>Éditions Philippe Amaury (EPA), also known as Groupe EPA or the Groupe Amaury, is a French private media group founded by Philippe Amaury (1940–2006) whose widow, Marie-Odile Amaury, owns a majority of the company. The CEO of the company is Aurore Amaury, daughter of Philippe and Marie-Odile Amaury.

In partnership with SNC L&#x27;Équipe, the group publishes the sports journals &quot;l&#x27;Équipe&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;Équipe Magazine&quot;, &quot;France Football&quot; and Vélo Magazine. EPA owns the television channel &quot;l&#x27;Équipe 21&quot;, which airs French and international sports competitions like road cycling, rally, motocross, basketball, ice hockey, volleyball, judo, biathlon and the European Games. In 1998, the group launched the L&#x27;Équipe television channel as an extension to the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;.

Its wholly owned subsidiary, Amaury Sport Organisation, is one of the largest promoters of sports events in France, including the Tour de France and Paris–Roubaix bicycle races, the Paris–Dakar Rally, the Paris Marathon and the Open de France golf tournament; as well as 250 days of competition per year, with 90 events in 30 countries.

EPA formerly owned &quot;le Parisien, &quot;a local newspaper in greater Paris, as well as its national edition, &quot;Aujourd&#x27;hui en France&quot;. LVMH acquired the papers in 2015.

<text>Italia 1 ( ) is an Italian free-to-air television channel on the Mediaset network, owned by MFE - MediaForEurope. It is oriented at both young and adult people.

Italia 1 was launched on 3 January 1982 and, was originally owned by Rusconi; after a few months, however, due to the aggressive dumping practices of Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s rival network Canale 5, Rusconi was forced to sell the majority of his company to Fininvest, allowing Berlusconi to further strengthen his media holdings.

==History==
===Launch &amp; Early Years===
Launched on 3 January 1982 by print media editor Edilio Rusconi, Italia 1 was born from the idea of a network supported by twenty regional broadcasting stations, some owned by Rusconi himself and others simply affiliated to broadcast throughout Italian territory on the &#x27;ploy&#x27; of interconnection. The lead broadcasting station is Milan-based Antenna Nord, but Rome&#x27;s Quinta Rete also played an important role. Lillo Tombolini was the executive director, and the channel&#x27;s presenter was a young Gabriella Golia, who was already the face of Antenna Nord. 

During its early years, Rusconi&#x27;s growing national channel started its programming at noon, with a segment dedicated to children, during which various animated shows (particularly western cartoons) were broadcast, as well as successful original television series such as &quot;Star Trek&quot;, then in the early afternoon, air-time was given to region-specific broadcasts, later restarting the national broadcast with more television series and a mid-afternoon children&#x27;s programming block called &quot;Bim Bum Bam&quot;, which offered numerous cartoons and animated series over the years, mostly American imports, such as &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, &quot;Snorks&quot;, &quot;Count Duckula&quot;, &quot;Police Academy&quot;, &quot;Iznogoud&quot;, &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Spiff and Hercules&quot;, and &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; among others. 

In the late afternoon hours, the channel again broadcasts from local stations, alongside airing an episode of a television series the following hour (such as &quot;Paper Moon&quot;. Generally in the early evening hours, two movies and one television series was broadcast. The network also offered plenty of air-time to sport programs dedicated to soccer, boxing, basketball and motor racing, including Andrea De Adamich&#x27;s &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. Primetime hours on Italia 1 were dedicated to predominantly American imports such as &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, &quot;Project UFO&quot;, and &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;. 

On 23 April 1982, an official agreement was made between Gruppo Rusconi and the American network CBS for technical assistance and program sharing. However, only a few months after its appearance on a national scale, funds began to dwindle, mostly due to exorbitant costs of managing broadcast transmission systems, something a print editing house such as Rusconi probably wasn&#x27;t aware of, but also due to the aggressive advertising policy from its main rival network, Canale 5. In fact, Rusconi&#x27;s network relied on an external advertising provider, La Publikompass, to sell advertising space while Berlusconi&#x27;s channel took advantage of owning its own advertising provider, Publitalia, which could easily personalise ad packages to clients using dumping practices.

On 6 September 1982, Rusconi signed a collaboration agreement with Silvio Berlusconi, the owner of Canale 5, mainly focusing on a common policy for the management of advertising limits but also concerning the communal use of high frequency networks and the sharing of some programs. However, on 30 November of that same year, the Rusconi group were forced to sell the network for about 29 billion lire (approximately €15 Million) to Berlusconi, who merged it with &quot;Rete 10&quot;, also owned by Berlusconi, to found the new Italia 1, which, according to the Fininvest company, is geared towards a young audience.

In the past, Italia 1 had continuity announcers. As mentioned earlier, the network&#x27;s main announcer was Gabriella Golia, who served for 20 years from 1982 to 2002 (Golia was also continuity announcer of Antenna Nord). Other continuity announcers for Italia 1 included Veronica Ghinzani from 1982 to 1984, Manuela Blanchard Beillard in the early 1980s, Fiorella Pierobon from 1982 to 1984 (then official announcer of Canale 5), and Licia Colò from 1982 to 1985. In 2002, Italia 1 removed continuity announcers from the network altogether (the same thing happened in Canale 5 in December 2005).

The voice of Italia 1&#x27;s promos for many years was Fabrizio Casadio, who announced them from 9 January 1984 to 5 October 1997. Since 1 January 2009, promotions are announced by Raffaele Farina.

<doc id="602789" wikidata="Q1891905" url="?curid=602789" title="The Nanny (1965 film)">
<text>The Nanny is a 1965 British psychological horror thriller film directed by Seth Holt, and starring Bette Davis, Wendy Craig and Jill Bennett. It was written by Jimmy Sangster based on the novel of the same title by Evelyn Piper (a pseudonym for Merriam Modell) and was scored by Richard Rodney Bennett. It was made by Hammer Film Productions at Elstree Studios.

A devoted but mentally-ill nanny cares for a 10-year-old boy recently discharged from a home for disturbed children.

== Plot ==
Joey spends two years at a school for emotionally disturbed children after being blamed for drowning his younger sister Susy. The school&#x27;s headmaster informs Joey&#x27;s father, Bill, that his son harbours an intense dislike of middle-aged women. This extends to the family&#x27;s nanny, whom Joey distrusts and disrespects.

When Joey returns home, he refuses to eat the meals Nanny prepares because he suspects she may poison him. He abandons the room Nanny has decorated for him and moves to one with a strong lock on its door. He makes Nanny promise she won’t go in the bathroom while he is taking a bath. Joey&#x27;s rude behaviour upsets his neurotic mother, Virginia, who is prone to melancholy and crying spells, still grieving over the death of Susy. Nanny comforts Virginia as she did when she cared for her and her sister Pen when they were children.

Bill is a Queen&#x27;s Messenger who is frequently away on business. He flies to Beirut for a few days leaving Virginia and Joey alone with Nanny.

Joey persuades Bobbie Medman, the 14 year old daughter of a doctor who is living in the flat above to witness a prank to frighten Nanny. He places Bobbie&#x27;s large, life-like doll upside down in the bath, turns the taps on and closes the curtains and then tells Nanny someone has left the bath running. Nanny goes to turn the taps off and sees the doll, she starts moaning in anguish and has to go and lie down. Virginia tells Joey it was a very cruel prank to play after what happened.

Joey refuses to eat the steak and kidney pie Nanny has cooked for him, so she spoon-feeds Virginia the pie which is laced with poison. After Virginia falls ill and is taken to hospital, Joey is blamed for the incident. Joey&#x27;s Aunt Pen, who has a weak heart as a result of childhood rheumatic fever, comes to babysit.
After Pen and Joey play a couple of games of draughts and drink a ‘shared’ jug of hot chocolate Nanny tells Joey it is time for his bath. Once again he tells her to promise not to come in the bathroom but Pen won’t listen and tells Nanny she might as well lie on the floor and let Joey walk all over her. 
Pen is just relaxing reading a magazine when Joey appears behind her, soaking wet, in a towel and he tells her that Nanny has tried to drown him. Pen refuses to believe him and he leaves, Pen is upset and has trouble with her heart, she calls out to Nanny to get her medicine out of her bag, which she does eventually and Pen comes around.

Joey appears at Bobbie&#x27;s window dripping wet and claims that Nanny tried to drown him. Bobbie doesn’t believe him. He tells her what happened to Susy.

In a flashback, Nanny leaves the house for an appointment. Joey is playing by himself with his father&#x27;s model railway. Susy threatens to tell their mother on Joey for being disobedient because he is not supposed to. She wants to play with him, but he tells her to go away and play with her dolls.

She goes into the bathroom to play and accidentally drops her doll in the bath. She tries to retrieve it by standing on a box and reaching behind the shower curtain but she falls into the bath. Nanny arrived back and sees Joey playing she enters the bathroom and absentmindedly turns on the taps by reaching through the closed shower curtain without looking inside. Unable to summon Susy for her bath, Nanny searches for her. When she returns to the bathroom, she finds Susy floating face down in the water. Her mind snaps and she bathes the girl&#x27;s lifeless body. Joey witnesses this but Nanny does not see him. Eventually, she realises that Joey knows that she accidentally caused Susy’s death.

Joey tries to call for help but Nanny stops him and tries to get him to take a bath with Suzy’s lifeless body. Joey manages to get away and Nanny blames Joey saying he pushed Susy over while they had a bath together. He stops eating and sleeping in case she tries to murder him which is why he is eventually sent away. The doctor at the school says Joey is suffering from a massive guilt complex from killing his sister.

Doctor Medman finds Joey in his apartment and takes him back downstairs to Pen and Nanny. Joey wedges his bedroom door shut with a chest of drawers and sets up a makeshift alarm system.

Pen wakes during the night and finds Nanny standing outside Joey&#x27;s door holding a pillow. Nanny claims the pillow is an extra one for Joey, but Pen remembers she would not allow her and Virginia to have pillows when they were children. Suspecting Nanny intends to suffocate Joey, Pen asks her what happened earlier when Joey emerged from the bathroom soaking wet. She gets over-excited and has a heart attack, however Nanny snatches her heart medicine from her.

As Pen lies dying, Nanny tells her she was a single mother who was called to the deathbed of her daughter, Janet, who died from an illegal abortion. Already shaken, she returned home to find Susy&#x27;s body, which drove her over the edge. Nanny says she cannot let Joey live for fear that someone may believe his story and put nannies&#x27; livelihoods at risk because people entrust their children to them. When Nanny finishes her speech, Pen is dead.

Nanny tries to enter Joey&#x27;s bedroom, but his alarm system wakes him and he tries to escape. Nanny grabs him by the ankle, causing him to fall and knocking him unconscious. She carries him into the bath and fills it with water and drops him in it. Soon the memory of finding Susy&#x27;s body returns and Nanny pulls Joey from the bath.

Dr Medman visits Virginia&#x27;s hospital room and explains that Nanny is mentally ill and will receive long-term care. Virginia discovers Joey is at the hospital and would like to see her. She tells him she knows everything about Nanny. Joey is no longer sullen; instead he hugs his mother and behaves like a joyful ten-year-old boy.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $1,300,000 in rentals to break even and made $2,175,000, meaning it made a profit.

The movie screening rights were sold to American television for nearly $400,000.

=== Critical ===
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;The standard ending of a Bette Davis film these days is her departure for the mad-house. That, at least, is what one presumes is her fate at the conclusion of &quot;The Nanny&quot;; but the film ends on something of a dying fall, fading quietly away just as we expect to see Miss Davis in full maniac stride. Perhaps everyone felt that enough was enough; and this Hammer Horror is in fact so muted that one feels there may have been a certain tentativeness about tackling a subject which plays with only two possibilities – monster child or trusted nanny as psychopathic case-histories.  ... the keynote of the film is the Davis performance – the quietest and most restrained since &quot;Baby Jane&quot; started this cycle. Whether feeding ducks in the park, preparing goodies for the outrageous Joey to reject, or explaining patiently to the dying Aunt Pen that of course she can&#x27;t possibly give her the medicine, Bette Davis maintains the sweetly-smiling confidence of someone who knows that she is the most rational member of the household.  ... Seth Holt&#x27;s direction works best when tensions are being established – the edgy opening, for instance, with husband and wife fighting behind half-closed doors, Joey discovered in appalling misdeeds at the school, and Nanny beamingly serving a dinner nobody eats. When it comes to working the tensions out, there&#x27;s some hesitation over just how monstrous everyone is supposed to be. The result is a mixture of non-horrific horror film and half-cock psychological exercise – watchable on both levels, not ape working on either, and with the confusions seeming to spring from the way the novel has been toned down in the script. Apart from Miss Davis, there&#x27;s a performance of remarkable surly aplomb by 10-year-old William Dix, who seems almost alarmingly in control of his situation.&quot;

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 3/5 stars, writing: &quot;The first of two movies Bette Davis made for Britain&#x27;s Hammer films is a genuinely chilling horror tale, with a clever plot written by Hammer regular Jimmy Sangster. However, movie purists may well object to the fact that the flashbacks reveal incidents that never actually happened, manipulating the expectations of the audience. Despite valiant work from Davis and director Seth Holt, the narrative weaknesses and the general unpleasantness of the piece spoil what could have been an interesting addition to the genre.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell said: &quot;Muted Hammer experiment in psychopathology, with too much equivocation before the dénouement; the star&#x27;s role allows few fireworks, and the plot is rather unpleasant.&quot;

It holds a 91% approval rating on movie review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on eleven reviews.

AllMovie called it &quot;one of Hammer Films&#x27; better non-supernatural outings of the 1960s&quot;.

<doc id="602790" wikidata="Q1707292" url="?curid=602790" title="Asymptomatic">
<text>Asymptomatic (or clinically silent) is an adjective categorising the medical conditions (i.e., injuries or diseases) that patients carry but without experiencing their symptoms, despite an explicit diagnosis (e.g., a positive medical test).

Pre-symptomatic is the adjective categorising the time periods during which the medical conditions are asymptomatic.

Subclinical and paucisymptomatic are other adjectives categorising either the asymptomatic infections (i.e., subclinical infections), or the psychosomatic illnesses and mental disorders expressing a subset of symptoms but not the entire set an explicit medical diagnosis requires. 

== Examples ==
An example of an asymptomatic disease is cytomegalovirus (CMV) which is a member of the herpes virus family. &quot;It is estimated that 1% of all newborns are infected with CMV, but the majority of infections are asymptomatic.&quot; (Knox, 1983; Kumar et al. 1984) In some diseases, the proportion of asymptomatic cases can be important. For example, in multiple sclerosis it is estimated that around 25% of the cases are asymptomatic, with these cases detected postmortem or just by coincidence (as incidental findings) while treating other diseases.

==Importance==
Knowing that a condition is asymptomatic is important because:
* It may be contagious, and the contribution of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections to the transmission level of a disease helps set the required control measures to keep it from spreading.
* It is not required that a person undergo treatment. It does not cause later medical problems such as high blood pressure and hyperlipidaemia.
* Be alert to possible problems: asymptomatic hypothyroidism makes a person vulnerable to Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome or beri-beri following intravenous glucose.
* For some conditions, treatment during the asymptomatic phase is vital. If one waits until symptoms develop, it is too late for survival or to prevent damage.

== Mental health ==
Subclinical or subthreshold conditions are those for which the full diagnostic criteria are not met and have not been met in the past, although symptoms are present. This can mean that symptoms are not severe enough to merit a diagnosis, or that symptoms are severe but do not meet the criteria of a condition.

== List ==
These are conditions for which there is a sufficient number of documented individuals that are asymptomatic that it is clinically noted. For a complete list of asymptomatic infections see subclinical infection.

<text>CFMT-DT (channel 47) is a television station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is one of two flagship stations of the Canadian multilingual network Omni Television. CFMT-DT is owned and operated by Rogers Sports &amp; Media alongside sister Omni outlet CJMT-DT (channel 40) and Citytv flagship CITY-DT (channel 57). The three stations share studios at 33 Dundas Street East on Yonge-Dundas Square in downtown Toronto; CFMT-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located atop the CN Tower.

The station was originally founded on September 3, 1979, by a consortium led by Dan Iannuzzi, Jerry Grafstein, Raymond Moriyama, Steve Stavro, Garth Drabinsky and Nat Taylor as CFMT-TV, branded &quot;MTV&quot; (Multilingual Television) as Canada&#x27;s first multicultural independent station and in 1980, CFMT became Canada&#x27;s first television station to air 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The station has been owned by Rogers Communications since 1986, but later used CFMT as the basis and flagship station to expand its multicultural stations under the Omni brand beginning with the launch of CJMT-TV (Omni.2) in 2002 along with the rebranding of CFMT as Omni.1 and the rest of Canada in subsequent years. The two stations are distinguished by their service of different cultural groups; CFMT caters primarily on European (particularly Western and Eastern) and Latin American cultures while CJMT focuses on Asian cultures (including programming in South Asian and Chinese languages).

==History==
In December 1978, Dan Iannuzzi, founder of the Italian-language daily newspaper &quot;Corriere Canadese&quot; and future recipient of the Order of Canada, received a licence to operate a multilingual television station, defeating rival applicants Johnny Lombardi and Leon Kossar. His company, Multilingual Television (Toronto) Ltd., had been producing multilingual television programs since 1972. Iannuzzi initially owned 30% of the station, and other investors included Jerry Grafstein (who was also one of the major investors that helped launch CITY-TV in September 1972), Raymond Moriyama, Steve Stavro, Garth Drabinsky and Nat Taylor. The call letters CFMT were derived from &quot;Canada&#x27;s First Multilingual Television&quot;, as it was the first multicultural television station in Canada. English-language programming was limited to one-third of the station&#x27;s broadcast hours, with French-language programming accounting for 7% and programming in about two dozen other languages providing the remaining 60%. The station was originally going to broadcast on UHF channel 45, but instead moved to channel 47 for technical reasons. The station first signed on the air on September 3, 1979, broadcasting 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as a multicultural independent station under the brand name &quot;MTV&quot; (for &quot;Multilingual Television&quot;); that branding was dropped in 1981 to avoid confusion with the upstart American MTV cable network. (The channel even broadcast a program called &quot;Video Singles&quot;, as of 1983.)

In August 1980, the channel became the first in Canada to adopt a 24-hour, seven-day a week schedule, introducing &quot;The All-Night Show&quot; three weeks later.

In the past, CFMT-TV identified itself on air as &quot;Channel 47/Cable 4&quot; (reflecting both its over-the-air channel number and its cable channel in the Greater Toronto Area through Rogers Cable) and later as &quot;CFMT International&quot;. On September 16, 2002, Rogers launched CJMT-TV (channel 40, which was branded as &quot;OMNI.2&quot;) to provide additional multicultural programming, and rebranded CFMT as &quot;OMNI.1&quot;. Programs airing on CFMT that were aimed at Asian and African communities were moved to CJMT, while CFMT kept programs aimed at European and Latin American groups.

On October 8, 2007, Rogers announced that the operations of the two Omni stations would relocate from 545 Lake Shore Boulevard West to 33 Dundas Street East. CFMT and CJMT integrated their operations into the building – sharing with Citytv flagship CITY-DT, which had moved into the facility the previous month – on October 19, 2009.

==Programming==
The station broadcasts multicultural programming targeting European and Latin American communities throughout Southern Ontario. Historically, among English-speaking television viewers in the region, CFMT was best known as home to various English-language syndicated talk shows and sitcom repeats, including &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;, airing nightly as counterprogramming to local newscasts and first-run prime time series on owned-and-operated stations of the major networks.

Until around 1990, CFMT was the original Toronto home of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;. At that time, both game shows moved to CTV flagship station CFTO-TV (channel 9) and remained on that station until 2004, when &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; moved to CJMT, then moved back to CFMT the following year; Barrie station CKVR-TV carried the show in 2006. &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; remained on CFTO-TV for a few years until 2008, when CBC Television acquired the Canadian television rights to the game shows, moving once again to CBC flagship station CBLT (channel 5) until 2012, when both programs moved to independent station CHCH-DT (channel 11) in Hamilton.

===Newscasts===
CFMT-DT presently broadcasts five hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with one hour each weekday). The station currently carries a local newscast aimed at Southern Ontario&#x27;s Italian demographic. CFMT previously produced a Cantonese newscast; that program was moved to CJMT after that station launched on September 16, 2002. The station previously carried newsbreaks produced by sister radio station CFTR in the early 1990s.

==Technical information==

===Subchannel===
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
CFMT shut down its analogue signal, over UHF channel 47, on August 31, 2011, the official date on which full-power television stations in larger Canadian television markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 64, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to UHF channel 47 for post-transition operations. CFMT&#x27;s digital repeaters in London and Ottawa also relocated to new channels for the same reason behind the relocation of the main signal; these repeaters would use their former UHF analogue channel numbers (69 and 60) as their virtual channel numbers.

<text>CJMT-DT (channel 40) is a television station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is one of two flagship stations of the Canadian multilingual network Omni Television. CJMT-DT is owned and operated by Rogers Sports &amp; Media alongside sister Omni outlet CFMT-DT (channel 47) and Citytv flagship CITY-DT (channel 57). The three stations share studios at 33 Dundas Street East on Yonge-Dundas Square in downtown Toronto; CJMT-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located atop the CN Tower.

The station was launched on September 16, 2002 as a sister to CFMT; at the same time, Rogers launched Omni Television as a blanket brand for the stations by branding the new station as Omni.2, followed by re-branding CFMT as Omni.1 as well as the rest of Canada in subsequent years. The two stations are distinguished by their service of different cultural groups; CJMT caters primarily on Asian cultures (including programming in South Asian and Chinese languages) while CFMT focuses on European (particularly Western and Eastern) and Latin American cultures.

==History==

The station signed on the air on September 16, 2002, broadcasting on UHF channel 44. In 2004, CJMT moved its channel allocation to UHF channel 69. The station was licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) as part of the same process that approved independent station CKXT-TV (channel 51, now defunct) and was proposed to be known as CFMT Too. The &quot;J&quot; in its callsign has no particular meaning, except that it was an available callsign that maintained the &quot;MT&quot; lettering (standing for &quot;Multicultural Television&quot;) from CFMT (CJMT was formerly the callsign of a now-defunct AM radio station in Chicoutimi, Quebec).

On May 19, 2005, the CRTC approved an application by Rogers Broadcasting Limited to operate a transitional digital television programming undertaking at Ottawa, operating on channel 66C with an average effective radiated power of 7,110 watts.

On October 8, 2007, Rogers announced that the operations of the two Omni stations would relocate from 545 Lake Shore Boulevard West to 33 Dundas Street East. CJMT and CFMT integrated their operations into the building – which it shares with City flagship CITY-DT, which moved into the facility the previous month – on October 19, 2009.

==Programming==
As a multicultural station, CJMT airs programming in the South Asian languages (such as Urdu and Hindi), as well as in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Somali and Pashto. As with its sister station CFMT, CJMT also aired syndicated English-language programming until September 25, 2015. The original series &quot;Metropia&quot; was also broadcast on the station, with repeats on CFMT. In 2014, CJMT began to regularly simulcast CBS late-night talk shows &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, both of which moved from the main Omni television channel. Both shows have since concluded, with their successors airing on Global and CTV respectively. The first season of the Fox series &quot;Empire&quot; also aired on CJMT (its second season moved to City).

===Sports programming===
During the 2007 season, CJMT began airing late-afternoon NFL games, usually the alternate to whatever aired on Sportsnet and CKVU-DT in Vancouver. These games were moved to CITY-DT as of the 2008 season. Rights to these games were later assumed by CTV as of the 2017 season. During the 2014 season, CJMT aired several &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; games in simulcast with Sportsnet and CBS.

On June 27, 2013, CJMT broadcast Mandarin-language coverage of a Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball game started by Taiwanese player Chien-Ming Wang. This event marked the first ever Canadian MLB telecast in the language.

===Newscasts===
CJMT-DT broadcasts five hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with one hour each weekday). The station carries two local newscasts aimed at Southern Ontario&#x27;s Asian demographic, presented in the Mandarin and Cantonese languages.

CJMT launched its news operation the day the station began operations on September 16, 2002, with newscasts airing in Mandarin and South Asian languages as well as a Cantonese language newscast that moved to the station from sister station CFMT. The South Asian edition had previously aired once a week and was known as &quot;South Asian Newsweek&quot;. The South Asian newscast was cancelled in June 2013 due to corporate cutbacks at Rogers Media, that included the shutdown of production operations at CJMT&#x27;s sister stations, CJCO-DT in Calgary and CJEO-DT in Edmonton.

The length of the weekday Mandarin news program has been half an hour from its launch on September 3, 1979, to April 30, 2010, and was extended to one hour on May 3, 2010.

In September 2017, with the launch of Omni National, Omni 2 started production of news programs in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Punjabi.

====Notable former on-air staff====

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CJMT shut down its analogue signal, over UHF channel 69, on August 31, 2011, the official date on which full-power television stations in larger Canadian television markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The conversion coincided with a change in transmitters, from the analogue transmitter atop First Canadian Place to a digital transmitter on the CN Tower alongside its Rogers Media sister stations.

The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 51, using virtual channel 69. In August 2012, the digital signal relocated to UHF channel 40, after that channel was vacated due to the shutdown of CKXT-DT. The virtual channel was remapped to physical digital channel 40 with the relocation of the digital signal to that frequency.

Born in Lower Montague and educated at Prince of Wales College and Dalhousie University, he taught school in Georgetown for several years before entering the legal profession.

In 1917, the Conservative Party recruited Stewart, then a young lawyer, to be the party&#x27;s candidate in a by-election in King&#x27;s County. Stewart won the vote and took his seat in the provincial legislative assembly.

In 1921 he was elected leader of the Conservative Party and led the party to victory in the 1923 election but his government was defeated in the 1927 election due to Stewart&#x27;s opposition to total prohibition of alcohol.

He remained party leader and defeated the Liberal government in the 1931 election thanks, in part, to the difficulty all incumbent governments had in dealing with the Great Depression.

Stewart took on several cabinet positions himself and also intensively lobbied the federal government for relief so the province could deal with the economic hardships Prince Edward Islanders were suffering during the Depression. He obtained a larger federal subsidy for the island but the workload had a toll on Stewart and he died in office in 1933 at the age of 59.

<text>The polar archipelago of Svalbard was first discovered by Willem Barentsz in 1596, although there is disputed evidence of use by Pomors or Norsemen. Whaling for bowhead whales started in 1611, dominated by English and Dutch companies, though other countries participated. At that time there was no agreement about sovereignty. Whaling stations, the largest being Smeerenburg, were built during the 17th century, but gradually whaling decreased. Hunting was carried out from the 17th century by Pomors, but from the 19th century it became more dominated by Norwegians.

Exploration was initially conducted to find new whaling grounds, but from the 18th century some scientific expeditions took place. These were initially large scale, but from the late 19th century they became smaller and increasingly focused on the interior. The most important scientific explorers were
Baltazar Mathias Keilhau, Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld and Martin Conway. Sustainable mining started in 1906 with the establishment of Longyearbyen and by the 1920s, permanent coal mining settlements had been established at Barentsburg, Grumant, Pyramiden, Svea and Ny-Ålesund. The Svalbard Treaty came into effect in 1925, granting Norway sovereignty of the archipelago, but prohibiting &quot;warlike activities&quot; and establishing all signatories the right to mine. This both eliminated the &quot;mare liberum&quot; status of the islands, and also saw a name change from the Spitsbergen Archipelago to Svalbard. By the 1930s, all settlements were either Norwegian or Soviet.

During the Second World War, the settlements were first evacuated and then bombed by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, but rebuilt after the war. During the Cold War there were increased tensions between Norway and the Soviet Union, particularly regarding the building of an airport. There was limited oil drilling, and by 1973 more than half the archipelago was protected. Starting in the 1970s, Longyearbyen underwent a process of &quot;normalization&quot; to become a regular community. Arktikugol closed Grumant in 1962 and Pyramiden in 1998, while King Bay had to close mining at Ny-Ålesund after the Kings Bay Affair. The 1990s and 2000s have seen major reductions of the Russian population and the creation of scientific establishments in Ny-Ålesund and Longyearbyen. Tourism has also increased and become a major component of the economy of Longyearbyen.

==During the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s–1720s)==

===First verified discovery of Svalbard as a &quot;terra nullius&quot;===


There is no conclusive evidence of the first human activity on Svalbard. Swedish archeologist Hans Christiansson found flint and slate objects he identified as Stone Age tools dating from ca. 3000 BC, but there is little support among his peers as no dwelling place has been found. An analysis of the lithic (stone) material in 1997 concluded they were not Stone Age artifacts. During the 19th century, Norwegian historians proposed that Norse seamen had found Svalbard in 1194. This is based on annals that found &quot;Svalbarði&quot; four days sailing from Iceland. Although it forms the basis for the modern name of the archipelago, there is no scientific consensus that supports the hypothesis. Russian historians have proposed that Russian Pomors may have visited the island as early as the 15th century. This line was largely pursued by Soviet scholars, but again, no conclusive evidence has been found. The Portuguese may also lay claim to have discovered or known about Svalbard first due to the close resemblance of the archipelago in the Cantino Planisphere, an early map famous for documenting Portuguese discoveries in the New World. If proven this would predate the official discovery by 94 years.

The first undisputed discovery of the archipelago was an expedition led by the Dutch mariner Willem Barentsz, who was looking for the Northeast passage to China. He first spotted Bjørnøya on 10 June 1596 and the northwestern tip of Spitsbergen on 17 June. The sighting of the archipelago was included in the accounts and maps made by the expedition and Spitsbergen was quickly included by cartographers. Henry Hudson explored the islands in 1607.

===International whaling base===
The first hunting expedition, to Bjørnøya, was organized by the Muscovy Company led by Steven Bennet in 1604. Although they found thousands of walrus, they were only able to kill a few because of their lack of experience. The following year he was more successful and returned annually until they in a few years had achieved local extinction. After Jonas Poole reported seeing a &quot;great store of whales&quot; off Spitsbergen in 1610, the Muscovy Company sent a whaling expedition to the island under command of Poole and Thomas Edge in 1611. They hired Basque experts to hunt the bowhead whale, but both ships were wrecked and the crews rescued by English interlope. The following year, the Muscovy Company sent a new expedition, but was met by both Dutch and Spanish whalers. The company claimed exclusive rights to the area and sent away the contenders. In 1613, seven armed English ships were sent on the expedition which expelled a few dozen Dutch, Spanish and French vessels.

This led to an international political conflict. The Dutch rejected the English exclusive rights, claiming the &quot;mare liberum&quot; principle. Christian IV claimed that Denmark–Norway had the rights to all of Northern Sea in view of Greenland being an old Norwegian tax-land. England offered to purchase the rights from Denmark–Norway in 1614, but the offer was turned down, after which the English reverted to their exclusive rights claim. In 1615, Denmark–Norway sent three man-o-wars to collect taxes from English and Dutch whalers, but all refused to pay. The issue ended in a political deadlock, with Denmark–Norway and England both claiming sovereignty and France, the Netherlands and Spain claiming it a free zone under &quot;mare liberum&quot;.
In 1614, the English and Dutch partitioned the island, as the aggression was hampering the profitability of both groups. That year, the Netherlands created Noordsche Compagnie as a whaling cartel. After the Muscovy Company fell into financial difficulties some years later, the Noordsche Compagnie got the upper hand and was able to dominate the whaling and fend off the English. They established themselves in the northwestern corner of Spitsbergen (around Albert I Land) and only permitted a limited Danish presence. The English whaled further south, while the French were allocated to the north coast and the open sea. From the 1630s, the situation stabilized and there were only a limited number of aggressive incidents.

Initially, all nations hired Basque whalers, although they gradually disappeared after their knowledge was learned by their companions. The whaling method was based on landing the whale, where it would be partitioned and the blubber boiled. With a high concentration of whales close to land, the method was efficient, as the companies would split the crew between the land station and hunting. The most famous land station was the Dutch Smeerenburg on Amsterdam Island which had up to 200 people employed. Because of the high costs involved, only larger companies conducted whaling. By the late 17th century there were between 200 and 300 ships and in excess of 10,000 whalers around Spitsbergen. The first overwintering was accidentally experienced by an English group in Bellsund in 1630–31. The first planned overwintering was achieved by the Noordsche Compagnie in 1633–34.
A limited amount of open-sea whaling was performed by interlopers—independent entrepreneurs. The Noordsche Compagnie was disbanded by the government in 1642. The decade also saw an increase in whaling outside the main bays and fjords. This gradually resulted in the abandoning of land stations as technological innovation allowed flensing along the ship, which allowed for pelagic whaling. Cooking of the oil was moved to the mainland. While more cost-efficient, it resulted in a large portion of the meat being wasted. During the 18th century, Dutch whaling was reduced, until it ceased after 1770. The British gradually took the lead in Arctic whaling, but by around the start of the 19th century bowhead whales were scarce around Spitsbergen and the whalers moved elsewhere.

==Hunting==
It is not known when Pomors first came to Svalbard, although permanent activity had been established by the mid-16th century. Hunters were sent by merchants, and monasteries, such as Solovetsky Monastery, and settled in smaller stations along the coast. They would hunt reindeer, Arctic fox, seals, walrus and polar bears. The activity was most extensive at the end of the 18th century, when an estimated 100 to 150 overwintered. Unlike the whaling, Pomor activity was sustainable, they alternated stations between seasons and did not deplete the natural resources.
Seal hunting in the waters between Svalbard and Greenland was started by Germans in the late 17th century. The activity was later taken over by Norwegians and Danish in the 18th century. Sealing was less profitable but could be carried with much less capital. Norwegians came in contact with the Russians through the Pomor trade. Despite earlier attempts, not until 1794 did a Norwegian party reach Bjørnøya and the following years Spitsbergen. The first Norwegian citizens to reach Spitsbergen proper were a number of Coast Sámi from the Hammerfest region, who were hired as part of a Russian crew for an expedition in 1795. From the 1820s the Norwegian hunting expeditions were taken up and continued through the rest of the century. Tromsø gradually replaced Hammerfest as the main port of origin. In the last third of the century, an average 27 Norwegian ships sailed to Svalbard. In the winter of 1872–73, seventeen seal hunters died in the &quot;Svenskehuset&quot; Tragedy.

==Further exploration==
Exploration of the archipelago started in the 1610s as the whaling companies would send out small ships to find new areas to exploit. By 1650 it was established that Spitsbergen was an island and not connected to Greenland. Whalers gradually accumulated a good geographic knowledge of the coastline, but the interior remained uncharted. The first scientific expedition to Svalbard was the Russian Čičagov Expedition between 1764 and 1766, which passed Svalbard in an unsuccessful attempt to find the Northern Sea Route. It made among water and topography measurements. The second expedition was organized by the Royal Navy and led by Constantine Phipps in 1773. His two ships, the &quot;Racehorse&quot; and the &quot;Carcass&quot; got stuck in the ice around Sjuøyane before returning. They collected zoological and botanical samples and measured water temperatures, among others.
Scientific exploration increased through the 18th century, with the most extensive surveys being carried out by William Scoresby, who published several papers on the Arctic, and Baltazar Mathias Keilhau. The latter was the first to carry out expeditions in the interior, abandoning the large-scale operations used by the British and Russians. With the exception of the British, smaller more targeted expeditions became the norm. Science also took foot as the dominant motivation for expeditions until the end of the 19th century. A notable exception was the French &quot;Recherche&quot; expedition of 1838–39, which resulted in numerous publications in multiple fields and the construction of an observatory. Swedish exploration started with Sven Lovén in 1837, with lead way to Sweden dominating scientific investigations in the last half of the century. Particularly Otto Torell and Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld dedicated much of their research to the archipelago. Martin Conway was the first to produce a map of the interior of Spitsbergen.

Svalbard was used as the starting point for several expeditions to reach the North Pole by air. S. A. Andrée&#x27;s Arctic Balloon Expedition failed in 1897. Ny-Ålesund was the basis for four attempts between 1925 and 1928, including Roald Amundsen&#x27;s first attempt with a flying boat; Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd claimed they succeeded in 1926, but this has since been rejected. Amundsen&#x27;s airship &quot;Norge&quot; is now credited as the first to the pole. Umberto Nobile&#x27;s airship &quot;Italia&quot; crashed in 1928, resulting in the largest search in polar history.

==Industrialization==

The first attempt at creating a permanent settlement was carried out by Sweden&#x27;s Alfred Gabriel Nathorst. He established Kapp Thordsen on Isfjorden in 1872, but the planned phosphorite mining was not carried out and the settlement abandoned. Coal had always been mined and gathered by whalers and hunters, but industrial mining did not start until 1899. Søren Zachariassen of Tromsø was the first to establish a mining company to exploit Svalbard minerals. He claimed several places in Isfjorden and exported coal to the mainland, but lack of capital stopped further growth.

The first commercially viable mining company was John Munroe Longyear&#x27;s Arctic Coal Company, which established Longyear City (from 1925 Longyearbyen). By 1910, 200 men were working for the company. The town and mines were bought by the Norwegian-owned Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani in 1916. Another early entrepreneur was Ernest Mansfield and his Northern Exploration Company. He started marble mining on Blomstrandhalvøya, but the marble was unusable and his company never had any profitable ventures, despite surveying large parts of the island. By the 1910s, it was established that coal was the only economically viable mining activity on Svalbard. Swedish interests established mines at Pyramiden and Sveagruva, while Dutch investors established Barentsburg in 1920. During the First World War, Norway saw the advantage of increasing self-supply of coal and Kings Bay established mining in Ny-Ålesund in 1916.

==Jurisdiction==
Although Denmark–Norway never formally gave up its claim to Svalbard, the archipelago continued to be a &quot;terra nullius&quot;—a land without a government. The work to establish an administration was initiated by Nordenskiöld in 1871, in which he established that only Russia and Norway would object to an annexation of the island. Fridtjof Nansen&#x27;s endeavors raised the Norwegian public&#x27;s consciousness of the Arctic, which again brought forth public support for annexation of Svalbard. Yet the need for jurisdiction came from the mining community. Firstly, there was no means to make a mining claim legal. Secondly, there was a need for conflict resolution, particularly regarding labor conflicts, which often saw the mining company and the workers have different nationalities.
The Government of Norway took initiative in 1907 for negotiations between the involved states. Multilateral conferences were held in 1910, 1912 and 1914, all of which proposed various types of joint rule. The break-through came at the Paris Peace Conference. Germany and Russia had both been excluded, while Norway enjoyed much goodwill after their neutral ally policy during the war and was at the same time seen as harmless. The Svalbard Treaty of 9 February 1920 granted Norway full sovereignty over Svalbard, although with two major limitations: all parties to the treaty had equal rights to economic resources and the archipelago was not to be used for &quot;warlike purposes&quot;.

After significant political debate, a proposal to establish Svalbard as a dependency and administer it from Tromsø was rejected. Instead the &quot;Svalbard Act&quot; specified that the islands would be administered by the Governor of Svalbard and was considered &quot;part of the Kingdom of Norway&quot;, although not regarded as a county. The islands had until then been known as the Spitsbergen Archipelago, and it was at this time the term Svalbard was introduced. The legislation took effect on 14 August 1925. A mining code was passed in 1925 and by 1927 all mining claims, some of which conflicted, were resolved. All unclaimed land was taken over by the Norwegian Government. Although the Soviet Union was initially skeptical to the treaty, they were willing to trade a signing of it in exchange for a Norwegian recognition of the Soviet regime.

During the 1920s, mining fell into an economic slump, with several of the mining communities being closed. By the 1930s, only Store Norske and the Soviet state-owned Arktikugol were left. This led to more large-scale production, but left the archipelago with only two geopolitical interests, which led to a bilateralization of politics. Because both the Governor and the Commissioner of Mining only had a single person, which was stationed on the mainland during the winter, there was little Norwegian control over the Soviet communities. Pre-war coal production peaked at in 1936, 57 percent of which was from Norwegian mines, and at which time the archipelago had a population of 1,900. The 1930s also saw a limited cod fishery from Ny-Ålesund and a limited tourism with a scheduled ship service to the mainland.

==World War II==

Svalbard was initially unaffected by the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany on 9 April 1940. However, following the German attack on the Soviet Union, Svalbard became of strategic importance to secure supplies between the Allies. At first, the Soviet Union proposed Soviet–British occupation of the archipelago, but this was rejected by the Norwegian government-in-exile. Instead, an evacuation of all Norwegian and Soviet settlements were carried out by Operation Gauntlet in August and September.

With the island evacuated, German troops occupied Longyearbyen, where they built an airstrip and a weather station. In May 1942, a Norwegian expedition was sent to liberate the island; they were attacked by German aircraft, but were able to set up a garrison in Barentsburg. The German outpost was subsequently abandoned. The Germans, presumably underestimating the Allied forces&#x27; size, initiated Operation Zitronella. Along with nine destroyers, the battleships &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; were sent to Isfjorden where they leveled Barentsburg, Grumant and Longyearbyen. Sveagruva was bombed in an air raid in 1944. The Germans established a weather station on Hopen, which was taken over by Norway after the war.

==Cold War==

In 1944, the Soviet Union proposed that Svalbard become a condominium under joint Norwegian and Soviet rule, except for Bjørnøya, which would be transferred to the Soviet Union. Although the proposal was discussed in Norway, it was ultimately rejected in 1947. Reconstruction of the Norwegian settlements started in 1945 and they were quickly operational, and reaching pre-war production levels within a few years. Soviet reconstruction started in 1946, but Arktikugol was slower at gaining momentum in production. The Norwegian population stabilized at about 1,000 people, while there were about twice as many Soviets. The two nations built infrastructure, such as a postal service, radio stations and transport, independent of each other.

The political tension between Norway and the Soviet Union became heated after Norway joined NATO in 1949. The Soviet Union issued memorandums to Norway stating that Svalbard could not be under a NATO joint command, but this was rejected by Norway, and the issue laid at rest. A new protest was issued in 1958 after Norsk Polar Navigasjon proposed building a private airport at Ny-Ålesund, which was then actively opposed by the Norwegian Government to avoid agitating the Soviet Union. New protests were issued against the establishment of the European Space Research Organization&#x27;s Kongsfjord Telemetry Station, although the protests did not stop construction. A compromise about a Norwegian civilian airport was reached in 1971 and Svalbard Airport, Longyear opened in 1975, serving both Soviet and Norwegian towns.
Grumant was closed in 1961. The following year, 21 miners were killed in an accident in Ny-Ålesund, which led to the Kings Bay Affair, ultimately resulting in the withdrawal of Gerhardsen&#x27;s Third Cabinet. Oil drilling was started by Caltex in 1961. They were granted claims based on indications, rather than samples, of oil, which was not granted to Arktikugol, leading to strained relations with the Soviet Union. No commercially viable wells were found. A new round of searching in the 1980s was also fruitless.

Both the Kings Bay Affair and the Caltex Affair initiated public debate about the administration of Svalbard, and in particular the lack of resources and control of Soviet settlements. Funding for local and central administration was increased heavily and the Governor increased its activities in Soviet settlements. After mining was closed in Ny-Ålesund, the Norwegian Polar Institute took a dominant role in converting it to an international research station. In 1973, more than half the archipelago was protected through four national parks, fourteen bird sanctuaries and four nature reserves. Store Norske was nationalized between 1973 and 1976. From 1973, they started mining at Svea, but operations ceased in 1987. They resumed in 1997 but closed definitively in 2020.

==Normalization==

&quot;Normalization&quot; was a term coined in the 1970s to transform Longyearbyen from a company town to a regular community. The first steps towards local democracy were taken with the 1971 establishment of the Svalbard Council for the Norwegian population, although it only had a commentary function. Public services were transferred to the company Svalbard Samfunnsdrift in 1989, while private enterprise established services such as construction companies and a mall. Tourism became a livelihood with the establishment of hotels from 1995. From 2002 Longyearbyen Community Council was incorporated with many of the same responsibilities as a municipality.

Since the 1990s, several research and hi-tech institutes have established themselves, such as the University Centre in Svalbard, the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association, the Svalbard Satellite Station, the Svalbard Undersea Cable System and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. The 1990s saw a large reduction in Russian activity. Schools were closed in 1994 and children and mothers were sent to the mainland, reducing the population of Barentsburg to 800 and of Pyramiden to 600. Operations resumed at Svea in 1997, while Pyramiden was abandoned in 1998. The Svalbard Environmental Protection Act came into effect in 2002 and was followed up with three new national parks and three new nature reserves. From 1990 to 2011, the Russian and Ukrainian population fell from 2,300 to 370, while the Norwegian population increased from 1,100 to 2,000.

<text>Ibrox () is a suburb of Glasgow, Scotland. It is situated south of the River Clyde and is part of the former burgh of Govan. The origin of the name Ibrox is unclear: it may either derive from the Cumbric / Northern Brittonic &quot;broch&quot; (see Proto-Brythonic &quot;brox&quot;) or, possibly, the Gaelic &quot;àth bruic&quot;, meaning &quot;badger ford&quot;, but this is unconfirmed.

It is within walking distance of the Pacific Quay Media Park, housing BBC Scotland, STV and other production companies along with the Glasgow Science Centre. The opening of the Clyde Arc provides a road connection to the other side of the River Clyde. Ibrox is served by Ibrox subway station of the Glasgow Subway system.

The home of football club Rangers F.C. is located at Ibrox Stadium.

Ibrox Primary School is a primary school located on Edmiston Drive, the main road through Ibrox, directly across from Ibrox Stadium. The building was designed by Bruce and Hay and was opened in 1906. The school was originally known as Ibrox Board School, was built for the Govan Parish School Board.

Ibrox is home to an original artwork by South African artist Faith47. Located on Copland Road opposite the entrance to Fairley Street, the piece was completed during the preparations for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

<doc id="602820" wikidata="Q1619538" url="?curid=602820" title="Michael Bradley (basketball)">
<text>Michael Thomas Bradley (born April 18, 1979) is an American former professional basketball player and businessman. He is a 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), 235 lb (107 kg), power forward/center born in Worcester, Massachusetts. 

After attending Burncoat High School, he accepted a scholarship to play college basketball at the University of Kentucky. After his sophomore season at Kentucky, Bradley transferred to Villanova University where he started. That season he averaged 20.8 points per game and 9.8 rebounds per game.

Even though he had one year of college eligibility remaining, Bradley left school to go to the NBA in 2001 and was selected as the 17th pick in the 1st round of the NBA draft by the Toronto Raptors. During his rookie season, Bradley averaged 1.2 points per game and 0.9 rebounds per game. His statistics improved in 2002–03 (5 ppg and 6 rpg in 20 minutes), but in the following season was sidelined constantly with a right knee injury. He was let go by the Raptors in March 2004, and would later be signed by the Atlanta Hawks. In 2004–05 he started off with the Orlando Magic, but was traded twice during that season, to the Sacramento Kings and the Philadelphia 76ers. Played 46 games with the Sixers in 2005–06, his best in two years, mainly because of constant injuries to Chris Webber.

Bradley&#x27;s final NBA game was played on April 19, 2006, in a 86–96 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats where he recorded 4 points, 2 assists and 1 rebound.

In the 2006–07 season he signed for Bruesa GBC in the Spanish ACB.
After spending one season with the Spanish team, Bradley moved to Germany and signed with ALBA Berlin in August but was released in November. He did not stay unemployed for long, signing with Lithuanian power Žalgiris on November 15. However, he was limited by injuries, averaging only 7 points and 4.9 rebounds in seven games.

On March 10, 2008, Bradley signed with CB Granada of the ACB to play the rest of the season.

Bradley has three daughters: Taylor Rose, Kya Melat, and Shae Quinn. 

In 2010 Bradley was hired by the Summit Country Day School in Cincinnati, Ohio to be the coach of the Silver Knights boys varsity basketball team.

In March 2012, Bradley coached the Silver Knights to the D3 OHSAA State Championship, defeating Portsmouth High School 53–37.

Bradley now coaches and works for the NBA in Europe and the Middle East - leading camps, clinics and teaching the game of basketball to youth around the globe.

<text>A Northumberland Strait iceboat is a rowing boat, typically in length, in beam, with runners fastened to the hull for dragging over sea ice.

== Construction and use ==
Constructed of wood, similar to fishing dories built in Atlantic Canada and New England, the iceboats were operated in the Northumberland Strait during the 19th century and early 20th century, running between Prince Edward Island and the mainland provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia during the winter months between December and April when sea ice made passage by non-icebreaking steam ships impossible. They were also used during the winter months to connect Pictou Island with mainland Nova Scotia, sometimes in conjunction with passages from Prince Edward Island.

== History ==
Throughout the 19th century, iceboats became an essential link to mainland North America for Prince Edward Island, transporting both mail and passengers. Passengers would sometimes assist the crew. In addition to pulling ropes attached to the iceboat, hand-holds were molded along the outer gunwales which were used for hauling the iceboat over sea ice until reaching stretches of open water.

Crews and passengers faced stretches of open water, the sea ice, and slush ice that was in the process of freezing, which could make progress difficult. There are several accounts of boats becoming mired in these conditions and oars being broken during attempts to row through the slush. The boats bucked wind and tide among fields of sea ice.

The two primary routes for iceboats was between Wood Islands, Prince Edward Island and Caribou, Nova Scotia, (sometimes combined with a stop at Pictou Island, Nova Scotia), and across the Abegweit Passage between Cape Traverse, Prince Edward Island and Cape Jourimain, New Brunswick. This latter route, was known as the &quot;Capes Route&quot; and was the longest running iceboat service, operating from December 19, 1827 until 1917 when the icebreaking railcar ferry &quot;Prince Edward Island&quot; began service on this route.

Original Northumberland Strait iceboats are preserved at the Northumberland Fisheries Museum in Pictou, Nova Scotia as well as the Gateway Village tourism complex in Borden-Carleton, Prince Edward Island; an outdoor interpretive display can be seen in Cape Traverse (pictured).

<doc id="602824" wikidata="Q1086549" url="?curid=602824" title="Christopher Buckley (novelist)">
<text>Christopher Taylor Buckley (born September 28, 1952) is an American author and political satirist. He also served as chief speechwriter to Vice President George H. W. Bush. He is known for writing &quot;God Is My Broker&quot;, &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot;, &quot;Little Green Men&quot;, &quot;The White House Mess&quot;, &quot;No Way to Treat a First Lady&quot;, &quot;Wet Work&quot;, &quot;Florence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;Boomsday&quot;, &quot;Supreme Courtship&quot;, &quot;Losing Mum and Pup: A Memoir&quot;, and &quot;The Judge Hunter&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Buckley is the son of writer and &quot;Firing Line&quot; host William F. Buckley Jr. and Patricia Buckley. After receiving a classical education at Portsmouth Abbey School, Buckley worked his way around the world as a deckhand on a Norwegian tramp freighter. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Yale University in 1976.

==Career==
He joined the staff of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine in 1976 and seven months later was promoted at age 24 to managing editor. In 1980 he returned to sea aboard an American ship and made eight mid-winter transatlantic crossings between U.S. Gulf ports and North Sea ports in England and Germany. The experience was the basis for his first bestselling non-fiction book, &quot;Steaming to Bamboola: The World of a Tramp Freighter&quot;, published in 1982.

In 1981, he moved to Washington, D.C. to become chief speechwriter to Vice President George H.W. Bush. His first bestselling novel, &quot;The White House Mess&quot;, published in 1986, was a satire on White House office politics and political memoirs.

In 1989, Malcolm S. Forbes hired Buckley to start up a supplement to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. Buckley was editor-in-chief of &quot;Forbes FYI&quot;, later &quot;Forbes Life&quot;, from 1990 to 2007.

His 20 books have been published in 16 languages. His novel &quot;Thank You For Smoking&quot; was adapted to the screen and directed by Jason Reitman. 

===&quot;National Review&quot;===
In summer and fall 2008, Christopher Buckley wrote the back-page column for &quot;National Review&quot;, the conservative magazine founded by his father. In October 2008, Buckley wrote a column endorsing Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, choosing to have it published in &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; to avoid backlash from &quot;National Review&quot; readers. After many &quot;National Review&quot; readers and contributors still expressed their displeasure, Buckley resigned from that publication.

The &quot;Beast&quot;″s title for his endorsement, &quot;Sorry, Dad, I&#x27;m Voting for Obama&quot;, was found by many of his father&#x27;s friends and supporters to be offensive, particularly as it appeared shortly after his father&#x27;s death. Buckley disavowed the choice of title, although he continued to occasionally write for the &quot;Beast&quot;.

==Personal life==
Buckley&#x27;s first marriage was to Lucy Gregg, the daughter of Donald Gregg, who served as assistant to Vice President Bush for national security affairs and later as United States Ambassador to South Korea. Buckley and Gregg have two children. In 2000, Buckley&#x27;s son was born to former Random House publicist Irina Woelfle. Buckley and Gregg divorced in 2011.

In 2012, he married Katherine Close, a physician. She has four children.

<text>Frank Ténot (31 October 1925 – 8 January 2004) was a French press agent, pataphysician, and jazz critic. He managed a number of publications over the course of his long association with Daniel Filipacchi, a publisher of multiple magazines who had started as a photographer and jazz expert. Together they founded the influential radio show &quot;Salut les copains&quot;, featuring rock and roll, and the spin-off magazine of the same name. It was later renamed as &quot;Salut!&quot;.

==Life==
Ténot discovered jazz in Bordeaux in 1944, where he became president of the Hot Club of France. Based in Paris after World War II, he was employed at the Commission for Atomic Energy, and as a copy editor at the magazine &quot;Jazz Hot&quot;, alongside Boris Vian. Together the two men discovered &#x27;Pataphysics. 

In the 1950s, he worked at the French Club label, with Daniel Filipacchi, then a press photographer. He also worked with him at &quot;Jazz Magazine&quot;. Until his death in 2004, Ténot wrote a regular column in &quot;Jazzman&quot; and &quot;Jazz Magazine&quot;.

He and Filipacchi hosted a radio show on Europe 1, &quot;For Those Who Love Jazz&quot;, for sixteen years, from 1955 to 1971. 

In 1959, he began airing &quot;Hi folks&quot;, which was highly successful with youth and resulted in the development of a magazine of the same name. The two partners created a media group that included &quot;Lui, Pariscope, Union&quot; and &quot;Photo&quot;. 
They bought &quot;Paris Match&quot; in 1976 before joining forces with Matra and taking control of creating the Hachette Filipacchi Médias. 

By 1986, Ténot participated in the creation of the Europe 2. 
In 1999, he was a co-founder of TSF Jazz with Jean-François Bizot.

With his partner Daniel Filipacchi, Tenot tried to succeed in writing song lyrics. They published under the pseudonym Daniel Frank: their Lil &#x27;Darlin&#x27; was sung by Henri Salvador on air and accompanied by Count Basie. They also wrote the song &quot;Panne d&#x27;essence&quot; for Sylvie Vartan, under the pseudonym Dan Frank. 

They produced concerts of Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, and Sylvie Vartan at the Olympia theatre in Paris. 

Ténot presided over a management company, founded Éditions du Layeur, and was named &quot;Provveditore&quot; College Pataphysique.

Elected as mayor of the town of Marnay-sur-Seine in 1995, Ténot served until 2001. The Foundation Ténot was involved in supporting artistic creation with the art center CAMAC in Marnay-sur-Seine.

<text>Roger de Montgomery (died 1094), also known as Roger the Great, was the first Earl of Shrewsbury, and Earl of Arundel, in Sussex. His father was Roger de Montgomery, seigneur of Montgomery, a member of the House of Montgomery, and was probably a grandnephew of the Duchess Gunnor, wife of Duke Richard I of Normandy, the great-grandfather of William the Conqueror. The elder Roger had large landholdings in central Normandy, chiefly in the valley of the River Dives, which the younger Roger inherited.

==Life==
Roger inherited his father’s estates in 1055. By the time of the Council of Lillebonne, which took place in about January of 1066, he was one of William the Conqueror&#x27;s principal counsellors, playing a major role at the Council. He may not have fought in the initial invasion of England in 1066, instead staying behind to help govern Normandy. According to Wace&#x27;s &quot;Roman de Rou&quot;, however, he commanded the Norman right flank at Hastings, returning to Normandy with King William in 1067. 

Afterward, he was entrusted with land in two regions critical for the defence of the Kingdom of England. At the end of 1067 or early in 1068, William gave Roger nearly all of what is now the county of West Sussex, a total of 83 manors, which at the time of the Domesday Survey (1086) was an area known as the Rape of Arundel; and about 1071 Roger was granted estates in Shropshire which amounted to some seven-eighths of the whole county; he was also made Earl of Shrewsbury, but it is uncertain that the earldom came to him at the same time as the land, and it may have been a few years later. In 1083, Roger founded Shrewsbury Abbey.

Roger was one of the half-dozen greatest magnates in England during William the Conqueror&#x27;s reign. The Rape of Arundel was eventually split into two &quot;rapes&quot;, one keeping the name of Arundel, the other being called the Rape of Chichester. 

Besides his estates in Sussex and Shropshire, Roger had others in Surrey (four manors), Hampshire (nine manors), Wiltshire (three manors), Middlesex (eight manors), Gloucestershire (one manor), Worcestershire (two manors), Cambridgeshire (eight manors), Warwickshire (eleven manors), and Staffordshire (thirty manors). The income from Roger&#x27;s estates amounted to about £2,000 per year, and in 1086 the income of all the land in England was around £72,000. The £2,000 (equivalent to several million in 2022) was almost 3 per cent of the nation&#x27;s GDP.

After William I&#x27;s death in 1087, Roger joined with other rebels to overthrow the newly crowned king, William II, in the Rebellion of 1088. However, William was able to convince Roger to abandon the rebellion and to side with him. This worked out favourably for Roger, as the rebels were beaten and lost their land holdings in England.

==Family==
Roger married Mabel de Bellême, who was heiress to a large territory straddling the border between Normandy and Maine. The medieval chronicler Orderic Vitalis paints a picture of Mabel of Bellême being a scheming and cruel woman. She was murdered by Hugh Bunel and his brothers who, possibly in December 1077, rode into her castle of Bures-sur-Dive and cut off her head as she lay in bed. Their motive for the murder was that Mabel had deprived them of their paternal inheritance. Roger and Mabel had 10 children:

* Robert de Bellême, Count of Alençon in 1082, he succeeded his younger brother Hugh as 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury. He married Agnes, Countess of Ponthieu and died in 1131. 
* Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, died without issue 1098.
* Roger the Poitevin, Vicomte d&#x27;Hiemois, married Adelmode de la Marche. 
* Philip &#x27;the Grammarian&#x27;.
* Arnulf of Montgomery, married Lafracota, daughter of King Muirchertach Ua Briain. 
* Sibyl of Montgomery, she married Robert Fitzhamon, Lord of Creully.
* Emma, abbess of Almenêches.
* Matilda (Maud) of Montgomery, she married Robert, Count of Mortain and died c. 1085. He was a half-brother of William the Conqueror.
* Mabel of Montgomery, she married Hugh de Châteauneuf.
* Roger of Montgomery, died young.

Roger then married Adelaide du Puiset, by whom he had one son, Everard, who entered the Church.

After his death in 1094, Roger&#x27;s estates were divided. His eldest surviving son, Robert of Bellême, received the bulk of the Norman estates (as well as his mother&#x27;s estates); the next son, Hugh, received the bulk of the English estates and the Earldom of Shrewsbury. After Hugh&#x27;s death, the elder son Robert inherited the earldom.

<text>Derby Silk Mill, formerly known as Derby Industrial Museum, is a museum of industry and history in Derby, England. The museum is located on the former site of Lombe&#x27;s Mill, a historic silk mill which marks the southern end of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. The site opened as Derby’s Industrial Museum, on 29 November 1974. A £17 million redevelopment scheme started in 2016, and the museum reopened under the new name of the Museum of Making on 21 May 2021.

==History==
The site was adapted for use as Derby’s Industrial Museum, which opened on 29 November 1974.
Derby City Council temporarily closed the museum on 3 April 2015 to free funds for the redevelopment of the Silk Mill museum and other museums in the city. The Report of the Strategic Director of Neighbourhoods (Item 7 put before the Council Cabinet meeting held on 26 October 2010) indicated that this would result in the loss of 8.6 full-time jobs but would release £197,000 a year to mitigate the loss of &quot;Renaissance Programme&quot; funding. No date for re-opening was given in the report, although a period of two years was reported.

== Museum of Making==
In October 2016, a £17 million redevelopment programme started to reinvent and redevelop the museum for the 21st century, incorporating the principles of Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM). The museum reopened on 21 May 2021 under the new name of the Museum of Making.

In its first year of opening the new Museum of Making received a &#x27;Highly Commended&#x27; placement in the annual Museum+Heritage Awards within the category &#x27;Sustainable Project of the Year&#x27;. In September 2021 it also won the National Construction News Awards on the category &#x27;Project of the Year Under £25m&#x27;, as well as five further awards in the Constructing Excellence East Midlands Awards. On 10 May 2022 it was announced that the Museum of Makinig was short-listed for the 2022 Art Fund Museum of the Year award.

The museum exhibits are largely on the upper floors to reduce the amount of damage that would be done in the case of flooding such as that which occurred in October 2023 due to Storm Babet. The damage the storm did do closed the museum until 25 January 2024.

<text>The Polish Air Force () is the aerial warfare branch of the Polish Armed Forces. Until July 2004 it was officially known as &quot;Wojska Lotnicze i Obrony Powietrznej&quot; (). In 2014 it consisted of roughly 26,000 military personnel and about 475 aircraft, distributed among ten bases throughout Poland.

The Polish Air Force can trace its origins to the second half of 1917 and was officially established in the months following the end of World War I in 1918. During the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in 1939, 70% of its aircraft were destroyed. Most pilots, after the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September, escaped via Romania and Hungary to continue fighting throughout World War II in allied air forces, first in France, then in Britain, and later also the Soviet Union.

==History==
===Origins===
Military aviation in Poland started even before the officially recognised date of regaining independence (11 November 1918). The first independent units of the Polish Air Force, in service to the re-emerging Polish sovereign state, were actually formed before, in 1917, before World War I had come to an end. When the Russian Revolution began and the tsardom gradually lost control of the country, Polish pilots took advantage of the chaos and formed spontaneous aerial units in areas of present-day Belarus, south Ukraine, and by the Kuban river. Up until that point Polish pilots had only flown as members of Russian, German or Austro-Hungarian militaries. The first known air force units in service to the re-emerging Polish state were: &quot;I Polski Oddział Awiacyjny&quot; (1st Polish Aviation Squad) in Minsk formed on 19 June 1917, the 1st and 2nd Aviation Units of the 2nd Corps, the aerial fleet of the 4th Rifle Division, as well as the &quot;Samodzielny Polski Oddział Awiacyjny&quot; (Independent Polish Aviation Squad) in Odesa.

===Establishment===

Poland was under German and Austro-Hungarian occupation until the armistice, but the Poles started to take control as the Central Powers collapsed. Initially, the Polish air force consisted of mostly German and Austrian aircraft, left by former occupiers or captured from them, mostly during the Greater Poland Uprising. These planes were first used by the Polish Air Force in the Polish-Ukrainian War in late 1918, during combat operations centered around the city of Lwów (now Lviv). On 2 November 1918 pilot Stefan Bastyr performed the first combat flight of Polish aircraft from Lwów.

When the Polish-Soviet War broke out in February 1920, the Polish Air Force used a variety of former German and Austro-Hungarian, as well as newly acquired western-made Allied aircraft. Most common at that time were light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, among most numerous were French Breguet 14 bombers, German LVG C.V reconnaissance aircraft, British Bristol F2B scouts and Italian Ansaldo Balilla fighters.

After the Polish-Soviet War ended in 1921, most of the worn out World War I aircraft were gradually withdrawn and from 1924 the air force started to be equipped with new French aircraft. In total in 1918–1924 there were 2160 aircraft in the Polish Air Force and naval aviation (not all in operable condition), in which there were 1384 reconnaissance aircraft and 410 fighters. From 1924 to 1930 the primary fighter of the Polish Air Force was the SPAD 61 and its main bombers were the French produced Potez 15 and the Potez 25, which was eventually manufactured in Poland under license from Aéroplanes Henry Potez.

The first Polish-designed and mass-produced aircraft to serve in the country&#x27;s air force was a high wing fighter, the PWS-10, first manufactured in 1930 by the Podlasie Aircraft Factory.

===Inter-war years===

In 1933, Zygmunt Pulawski&#x27;s first high wing, all-metal aircraft, the PZL P.7a, was designed and produced, with 150 entering service. The design was followed by 30 improved PZL P.11a aircraft and a final design, the PZL P.11c, was delivered in 1935 and was a respectable fighter for its time; 175 entered service and it remained the only Polish fighter until 1939, by which time foreign aircraft design had overtaken it. Its final version, the PZL P.24, was built for export only and was bought by four countries. A new fighter prototype, the PZL.50 Jastrząb (Hawk), similar to the Seversky P-35 in layout, was curtailed by the Nazi invasion and the PZL.38 Wilk twin-engine heavy fighter remained a prototype.

As far as bombers are concerned, the Potez 25 and Breguet 19 were replaced by an all-metal monoplane, the PZL.23 Karaś, with 250 built from 1936 onwards, but by 1939 the Karas was outdated. In 1938 the Polish factory PZL designed a modern twin-engine medium bomber, the PZL.37 Łoś (Elk). The Łoś had a bomb payload of 2580 kg and a top speed of 439 km/h. Unfortunately, only about 30 Łoś A bombers (single tailfin) and 70 Łoś B (twin tailfin) bombers had been delivered before the Nazi invasion.

As an observation and close reconnaissance plane, Polish &quot;escadres&quot; used the slow and easily damaged Lublin R-XIII, and later the RWD-14 Czapla. Polish naval aviation used the Lublin R-XIII on floats. Just before the war, some Italian torpedo planes, the CANT Z.506, were ordered, but only one was delivered, and it was without armament. The principal aircraft used to train pilots were the Polish-built high-wing RWD-8 and the PWS-26 biplane. In 1939, Poland ordered 160 MS-406s and 10 Hawker Hurricane fighters from abroad, but they were not delivered before the outbreak of the war.

===1939===
On 1 September 1939, at the beginning of the invasion of Poland, all the Polish combat aircraft had been dispersed to secondary airfields, contrary to a commonly-held belief, based on German propaganda, that they had all been destroyed by bombing at their airbases. The aircraft destroyed by German bombers on the airfields were mostly trainers. The fighters were grouped into 15 escadres; five of them constituted the Pursuit Brigade, deployed in the Warsaw area. Despite being obsolete, Polish PZL-11 fighters shot down over 170 German aircraft. The bombers, grouped in nine escadres of the Bomber Brigade, attacked armoured ground columns but suffered heavy losses. Seven reconnaissance- and 12 observation escadres, deployed to particular armies, were used primarily for reconnaissance. Part of the Polish Air Force was destroyed in the campaign; the surviving aircraft were either captured or withdrawn to Romania, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia or Sweden, whose air forces subsequently employed these aircraft for their own use (in the case of Romania until 1956). A great number of pilots and aircrew managed to escape to France and then to Britain, where they played a significant part in the defence of the United Kingdom against Nazi invasion, during the Battle of Britain. Prior to the conflict Poland also bought 234 planes abroad. First of them were on delivery when the conflict started. These were Hawker Hurricane (14 planes), Morane-Saulnier 406 (120 planes) and Fairey Battle (100 planes). The ship SS Lassell with 14 Hawker Hurricanes on board left Liverpool on 28 August 1939, deliveries from France were also on way when the conflict broke out.

===Strength of Polish Air Force on 1 September 1939===


===1940 (France)===


After the fall of Poland, the Polish Air Force started to regroup in France. The only complete unit created before the German attack on France was the GC I/145 fighter squadron, flying Caudron C.714 light fighters. It was the only unit operating the C.714 at the time. The Polish pilots were also deployed to various French squadrons, flying on all types of French fighters, but mostly on the MS-406. After the surrender of France, many of these pilots managed to escape to Britain to continue the fight against the Luftwaffe.

===1940–1947 (United Kingdom)===
Following the fall of France in 1940, Polish units were formed in the United Kingdom, as a part of the Royal Air Force and known as the Polish Air Force (PAF). Four Polish squadrons were formed:

* 300 Squadron and 301 Squadron flew bombers, 
* 302 Squadron and 303 Squadron flew Hawker Hurricane fighters.

The two Polish fighter squadrons first saw action in the third phase of the Battle of Britain in August 1940, with much success; the pilots were battle-hardened and Polish flying skills had been well learned from the invasion of Poland. The pilots were regarded as fearless, sometimes bordering on reckless. Nevertheless, success rates were very high in comparison to UK and Empire pilots. 303 Squadron became the most efficient RAF fighter squadron at that time. Many Polish pilots also flew individually in other RAF squadrons.

As World War II progressed, a further twelve Polish squadrons were created in the United Kingdom:

* No. 304 Polish Bomber Squadron (bomber, then RAF Coastal Command), 
*No. 305 Polish Bomber Squadron (bomber),
*No. 306 Polish Fighter Squadron (fighter),
*No. 307 Polish Night Fighter Squadron (night fighter),
*No. 308 Polish Fighter Squadron (fighter),
*No. 309 Polish Fighter-Reconnaissance Squadron (reconnaissance, then fighter),
*No. 315 Polish Fighter Squadron (fighter),
*No. 316 Polish Fighter Squadron (fighter),
*No. 317 Polish Fighter Squadron (fighter),
*No. 318 Polish Fighter-Reconnaissance Squadron (fighter-reconnaissance),
*No. 663 Polish Air Observation Post Squadron (air observation/artillery spotting),
* and the Polish Fighting Team also known as &quot;Skalski&#x27;s Circus&quot;, attached to 145 Squadron RAF.

The fighter squadrons initially flew Hurricanes, then switched to Supermarine Spitfires, and eventually to North American Mustangs. 307 Squadron, like other night fighter squadrons (such as 410 Squadron Royal Canadian Air Force), flew Boulton Paul Defiants, Bristol Beaufighters and finally de Havilland Mosquitoes. The bomber squadrons were initially equipped with Fairey Battles and Vickers Wellingtons. 300 Squadron was later assigned Avro Lancasters, 301 Squadron Handley Page Halifaxes and Consolidated Liberators and 305 Squadron, de Havilland Mosquitoes and North American Mitchells. 663 Squadron (air observation/artillery spotting) flew Taylorcraft Auster IIIs and Vs. After the war, all equipment was returned to the British, but only some of the pilots and crews actually returned to Poland, with many settling in the United Kingdom, some of whom returned to Poland in 1989 after the fall of communism.

===1943–1945 (Soviet Union)===

Along with the Polish People&#x27;s Army (&quot;Ludowe Wojsko Polskie&quot;) in the USSR, the Polish People&#x27;s Air Force &quot;(Ludowe Lotnictwo Polskie)&quot; was created, in defence of the Soviet Union against Nazi invasion. Three regiments were formed in late 1943:

* the 1st Fighter Regiment &quot;Warszawa&quot;, (equipped with Yak-1 and Yak-9 aircraft), 
* the 2nd Night Bomber Regiment &quot;Kraków&quot; (flying Polikarpov Po-2 aircraft – produced in Poland as the CSS-13 from 1949 onwards), 
* and the 3rd Assault Regiment (flying Ilyushin Il-2 aircraft) were formed.

During 1944–5, further regiments were created, coming together to form the 1st Mixed Air Corps, consisting of a bomber division, an assault division, a fighter division and a mixed division. After the war, these returned to Poland and gave birth to the air force of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland.

===1949–1989===
In 1949, the Li-2sb transport aircraft was adapted into a bomber and in 1950, Poland received Petlyakov Pe-2 and Tupolev Tu-2 bombers from the Soviet Union along with USB-1 and USB-2 training bombers. In 1950 also, the Yak-17 fighter came into service, as did the Ilyushin Il-12 transport and the Yak-18 trainer. From 1951 onwards, the Polish Air Force was equipped with Yak-23 jet fighters and MiG-15 jets, along with a training version, the MiG-15 UTI, and later, in 1961, the MiG-17.

As well as Soviet-produced aircraft, from 1952 onwards Soviet MiG-15 and later MiG-17 fighters were produced under licence in Poland as the Lim-1, Lim-2 and later the Lim-5. A domestic ground attack variant of the Lim-5M was developed as the Lim-6bis in 1964. The only jet bomber used by the Polish Air Force during this period was the Ilyushin Il-28, from 1952 onwards. Poland used only a small number of MiG-19s from 1959, in favour of the MiG-21 from 1963 onwards, which became its main supersonic fighter. This aircraft was used in numerous variants from MiG-21F-13, through MiG-21PF and MF to MiG-21bis. Later, the Polish Air Force received 37 MiG-23s (1979) and 12 MiG-29s (1989).

The main fighter-bomber and ground attack aircraft after 1949 was the Il-10 (a training version, the UIl-10, entering service in 1951). From 1965 onwards, Poland also used a substantial number of Su-7Bs for bombing and ground attack, replaced with 27 Sukhoi Su-20s in 1974 and 110 Sukhoi Su-22s in 1984.

Propeller-driven training aircraft, the Junak-2 (in service since 1952), the TS-9 Junak-3 (in service since 1954) and the PZL TS-8 Bies (since 1958) were later replaced by a jet trainer, the domestically built TS-11 Iskra. Another Polish jet trainer, the PZL I-22 Iryda, was used for some time but, because of continuing problems, all machines were returned to PZL for modification and did not resume service. The Yak-12 was used as a multirole aircraft from 1951, the An-2 from 1955 and subsequently the Wilga-35 P.

Transport aircraft used by the Polish Air Force during this period included: the Il-14 (first in service in 1955), the Il-18 (first in service in 1961), the An-12B (first in service in 1966), the An-26 (first in service in 1972), the Yak-40 (first in service in 1973) and the Tupolev Tu-154. A number of helicopters were used by the Polish Army: the SM-1 (a Mil Mi-1 manufactured under licence), which was a multirole helicopter, in operation since 1956; the Mil Mi-4, multirole, since 1958; the PZL SM-2, multirole, since 1960; the Mil Mi-2 and Mil Mi-8 (later also Mil Mi-17), multirole, since 1968 and the Mil Mi-24, a combat helicopter, since 1976. Also the Mil Mi-14, an amphibious helicopter, and the Mil Mi-6, both used as transports.

In 1954, the Polish Air Force was merged with the Air Defence Force, creating the Air and Country Air Defence Forces (&quot;Wojska Lotnicze i Obrony Przeciwlotniczej Obszaru Kraju&quot;  – WLiOPL OK), a military organisation composed of both flying and anti-aircraft units. In 1962, the WLiOPL OK were separated back again into their two original component bodies: the Air Force (&quot;Wojska Lotnicze&quot;) and the Country Air Defence Force (&quot;Wojska Obrony Powietrznej Kraju&quot;).

===Present-day operations===

After political upheaval and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and a consequent reduction in the state of military anxiety in the whole of Europe, the Polish Air Force saw reductions in size. On 1 July 1990 the Polish Air Force and the Air Defence Force were merged again (&quot;Wojska Lotnicze i Obrony Powietrznej&quot; – WLiOP or WLOP). The attack capability of this force consisted primarily of MiG-21s, MiG-23s, MiG-29s, Su-20s and Su-22s. The remaining Lim-6bis were withdrawn in the early 1990s, followed soon afterwards by the withdrawal of the remaining Su-20 aircraft. The small number of remaining MiG-23s were withdrawn by 1999. Throughout the 1990s, Poland had not purchased any new combat aircraft and only managed to acquire further MiG-29s from the Czech Republic in 1995 and from Germany in 2004. MiG-21s were finally withdrawn from service in 2003. In 2004, the only remaining combat aircraft flown by the WLiOP were the MiG-29 and the Su-22. As of 2010, the fleet of Su-22s is in need of modernization to retain any value as a combat aircraft and its future is unclear.

In 2002, the F-16C/D Block 52+ from the American company Lockheed Martin was chosen as a new multirole fighter for the WLiOP, the first deliveries taking place in November 2006 and continued until 2008 under Peace Sky program. As of 2011 the Polish Air Force has three squadrons of F-16s: two stationed at the 31st Tactical Air Base near Poznań and the 10th Tactical Squadron at the 32nd Air Base near Łask. The acquisition of the US F-16 was not without fierce competition from European aerospace companies; the sale was hotly pursued by the French company Dassault, with their Mirage 2000 and by the Swedish company Saab, with the JAS 39 Gripen. The Polish Block 52+ F-16s are equipped with the latest Pratt and Whitney F-100-229 afterburning turbofan engines, and the avionics suite includes the APG-68(V)9 terrain mapping radar system and the ALQ-211(V)4 electronic warfare suite. All Polish F-16s can carry modern US precision ordnance, ranging from the JDAM/JSOW to the latest in export-certificate-authorized air-to-air weaponry (including the AIM-120C-5 and AIM-9X).

In the aftermath of the presidential Tu-154 crash in 2010 and later Polish-led investigation, the 36th Special Aviation Regiment, responsible for transporting the President and the Polish Government, was disbanded, while the defense minister resigned. A new unit, the 1st Air Base, replaced the 36th regiment. Between June 2010 and December 2017 most official flights were served by two leased Embraer E-175 operated by the LOT Polish Airlines. On 14 November 2016 the Defense Ministry ordered two Gulfstream G550 VIP planes. On 31 March 2017 a deal with Boeing Company was signed to supply two Boeing Business Jet 2 and one Boeing 737-800 for the head of state and the government transport.

On 27 February 2014 Poland signed a €280 million contract with Alenia Aermacchi for 8 M-346 Master advanced training jets. The first two Masters arrived in Poland accompanied by Team Iskry on 14 November 2016.

On 11 December 2014 Polish officials signed a contract with the United States for the purchase of 70 AGM-158 Joint Air to Surface Stand off Missile, for US$250 million. Also contained in the contract are upgrades to the fleet of Polish F-16s to be completed by Lockheed Martin.

On 28 May 2019, the Polish Minister of Defence announced that Poland had sent a request for quotation for the acquisition of 32 F-35A aircraft. On 11 September 2019, the Department of Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced that Poland had been cleared to purchase 32 F-35A fighters, along with associated equipment, for an estimated cost of $6.5 billion. On 27 September 2019 the US Congress approved the sale. On 31 January 2020, Poland signed a $4.6 billion deal for 32 F-35A fighters.

On 8 March 2022, the Polish government offered to transfer its entire MiG-29 fleet to the US government via Ramstein Air Base as lethal aid to the Ukrainian air force against the ongoing Russian invasion in return for aircraft of corresponding operational capabilities (most likely F-16s). The exchange was eventually not carried out.

The current aviator badge of the Polish Air Force has been in use since the 1920s. The badge is called &quot;gapa&quot; and represents silver eagle in flight with gold laurel wreath in the bill. Navigator/Observer badge (below) represents the same eagle, but in gold with added lightning bolts. The gapa is worn in the usual place on the upper left breast above the pocket, but unlike other air forces it is suspended on a chain. It adorned the uniform of Polish Air Force officers in the RAF during World War II along with their RAF wings. In the combat version (for at least 7 flights in combat conditions) the badge has a green laurel wreath.

<text>In sociology, institutionalisation (or institutionalization) is the process of embedding some conception (for example a belief, norm, social role, particular value or mode of behavior) within an organization, social system, or society as a whole. The term may also be used to refer to committing a particular individual or group to an institution, such as a mental or welfare institution. The term may also be used in a political sense to apply to the creation or organization of governmental institutions or particular bodies responsible for overseeing or implementing policy, for example in welfare or development. During the period of the Industrial Revolution in Europe many countries went through a period of &quot;institutionalization&quot;, which saw a large expansion and development of the role of government within society, particularly into areas seen previously as the private sphere. Institutionalization is also seen as an important part of the process of modernization in developing countries, involving again the expansion and improved organization of government structures.

==History==
During the period from 1850 to 1930 many types of institutions were created by public subscription, Parliament and local authorities to provide housing, healthcare, education, and financial support for individuals in need. At the upper end of the scale, public boarding schools such as Eton and Harrow were founded or greatly extended to meet the growing demand for the education of the children of those in colonial service overseas. These were seen as models of social improvement, and many inferior imitations followed for the lower social orders. Virtually every borough in the UK was required by legislation to make provision for paupers, homeless, released prisoners, convicted criminals, orphans, disabled war veterans, older people with no means of support, deaf and blind schools, schools and colonies for those with learning disabilities or mental health problems.

Distinguishing features of such institutions were frequently, but not exclusively:
* communal dormitories
* communal kitchens and dining facilities
* rural, isolated locations
* restrictions on personal liberty and possessions
* uniforms
* oppressive, authoritarian regimes
* strict systems of rules and codes of conduct
* boards of visitors or trustees, usually drawn from the ranks of the upper middle classes, the so-called &quot;great and good&quot;
* hierarchical systems of management
* compulsory religious attendance
* involvement of inmates as unpaid or poorly rewarded labour in return for small privileges
* widespread abuse of human rights, dignity
* rigid separation of the sexes
* excessive reliance on medication and physical restraints

Many of these organisations, whilst originally expressing idealistic aspirations and aims, became &quot;total&quot; institutions within a generation or two of their foundation, providing in some cases cradle-to-grave housing, occupation and social control. Founding charters usually proclaimed beneficial outcomes of &quot;reform&quot; (or rehabilitation) of character through moral and occupation education and discipline, but in practice inmates were often trapped in a system that provided no obvious route of escape or promotion. As late as the 1950s, in Britain, several hundred thousand people lived in Victorian asylums and &quot;colonies&quot;.

<text>A bouncing bomb is a bomb designed to bounce to a target across water in a calculated manner to avoid obstacles such as torpedo nets, and to allow both the bomb&#x27;s speed on arrival at the target and the timing of its detonation to be predetermined, in a similar fashion to a regular naval depth charge. The inventor of the first such bomb was the British engineer Barnes Wallis, whose &quot;Upkeep&quot; bouncing bomb was used in the RAF&#x27;s Operation Chastise of May 1943 to bounce into German dams and explode underwater, with an effect similar to the underground detonation of the later Grand Slam and Tallboy earthquake bombs, both of which he also invented.

==British bouncing bombs==
After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Wallis saw strategic bombing as the means to destroy the enemy&#x27;s ability to wage war and he wrote a paper entitled &quot;A Note on a Method of Attacking the Axis Powers&quot;. Referring to the enemy&#x27;s power supplies, he wrote (as Axiom 3): &quot;If their destruction or paralysis can be accomplished they offer a means of rendering the enemy utterly incapable of continuing to prosecute the war&quot;

Barnes Wallis&#x27;s April 1942 paper &quot;Spherical Bomb – Surface Torpedo&quot; described a method of attack in which a weapon would be bounced across water until it struck its target, then sink to explode under water, much like a depth charge. Bouncing it across the surface would allow it to be aimed directly at its target, while avoiding underwater defences, as well as some above the surface, and such a weapon would take advantage of the &quot;bubble pulse&quot; effect typical of underwater explosions, greatly increasing its effectiveness: Wallis&#x27;s paper identified suitable targets as hydro-electric dams &quot;and floating vessels moored in calm waters such as the Norwegian fjords&quot;.

Both types of target were already of great interest to the British military when Wallis wrote his paper (which itself was not his first on the subject); German hydro-electric dams had been identified as important bombing targets before the outbreak of World War II, but existing bombs and bombing methods had little effect on them, as torpedo nets protected them from attack by conventional torpedoes and a practical means of destroying them had yet to be devised. In 1942, the British were seeking a means of destroying the German battleship , which posed a threat to Allied shipping in the North Atlantic and had already survived a number of British attempts to destroy it. During this time, the Tirpitz was being kept safe from attack by being moored in Norwegian fjords, where it had the effect of a &quot;fleet in being&quot;. Consequently, Wallis&#x27;s proposed weapon attracted attention and underwent active testing and development.

On 24 July 1942, a &quot;spectacularly successful&quot; demonstration of such a weapon&#x27;s potential occurred when a redundant dam at Nant-y-Gro, near Rhayader, in Wales, was destroyed by a mine containing of explosive: this was detonated against the dam&#x27;s side, underwater, in a test undertaken by A.R. Collins, a scientific officer from the Road Research Laboratory, which was then based at Harmondsworth, Middlesex.

A.R. Collins was among a large number of other people besides Barnes Wallis who made wide-ranging contributions to the development of a bouncing bomb and its method of delivery to a target, to the extent that, in a paper published in 1982, Collins himself made it evident that Wallis &quot;did not play &quot;an all-important&quot; role in the development of this project and in particular, that very significant contributions were made by, for example, Sir William Glanville, Dr. G. Charlesworth, Dr. A.R. Collins and others of the Road Research Laboratory&quot;. However, the modification of a Vickers Wellington bomber, the design of which Wallis himself had contributed to, for work in early testing of his proposed weapon, has been cited as an example of how Wallis &quot;would have been the first to acknowledge&quot; the contributions of others. Also, in the words of Eric Allwright, who worked in the Drawing Office for Vickers-Armstrongs at the time, &quot;Wallis was trying to do his ordinary job [for Vickers-Armstrongs] as well as all this – he was out at the Ministry and down to Fort Halstead and everywhere&quot;; Wallis&#x27;s pressing of his papers, ideas and ongoing developments on relevant authorities helped ensure that development continued; Wallis was principal designer of the models, prototypes and &quot;live&quot; versions of the weapon; and, perhaps most significantly, it was Wallis who explained the weapon in the final briefing for RAF crews before they set off on Operation Chastise, to use one of his designs in action.

A distinctive feature of the weapon, added in the course of development, was back-spin, which improved the height and stability of its flight and its ability to bounce, and helped the weapon to remain in contact with, or at least close proximity to, its target on arrival. Back-spin is a normal feature in the flight of golf balls, owing to the manner in which they are struck by the club, and it is perhaps for this reason that all forms of the weapon which were developed were known generically as &quot;Golf mines&quot;, and some of the spherical prototypes featured dimples.

It was decided in November 1942 to devise a larger version of Wallis&#x27;s weapon for use against dams, and a smaller one for use against ships: these were code-named &quot;Upkeep&quot; and &quot;Highball&quot; respectively. A third version, code-named &quot;Baseball&quot;, was also planned for use by MTBs or MGBs of the Royal Navy Coastal Forces, but &quot;never saw the light of day&quot; Though each version derived from what was originally envisaged as a spherical bomb, early prototypes for both Upkeep and Highball consisted of a cylindrical bomb within a spherical casing. Development, testing and use of Upkeep and Highball were to be undertaken simultaneously, since it was important to retain the element of surprise: if one were to be used against a target independently, it was feared that German defences for similar targets would be strengthened, rendering the other useless. However, Upkeep was developed against a deadline, since its maximum effectiveness depended on target dams being as full as possible from seasonal rainfall, and the latest date for this was set at 26 May 1943. In the event, as this date approached, Highball remained in development, whereas development of Upkeep had completed, and the decision was taken to deploy Upkeep independently.

In January 1974, under Britain&#x27;s &quot;thirty year rule&quot;, secret government files for both Upkeep and Highball were released, although technical details of the weapons had been released in 1963.

===Upkeep===

Testing of Upkeep prototypes with inert filling was carried out at Chesil Beach, Dorset, flying from RAF Warmwell in December 1942, and at Reculver, Kent, flying from RAF Manston in April and May 1943, at first using a Vickers Wellington bomber. However, the dimensions and weight of the full-size Upkeep were such that it could only be carried by the largest British bomber available at the time, the Avro Lancaster, and even that had to undergo considerable modification in order to carry it resulting in the Avro Lancaster &quot;B III (Special)&quot;. In testing, it was found that Upkeep&#x27;s spherical casing would shatter on impact with water, but that the inner cylinder containing the bomb would continue across the surface of the water much as intended. As a result, Upkeep&#x27;s spherical casing was eliminated from the design. Development and testing concluded on 13 May 1943 with the dropping of a live, cylindrical Upkeep bomb out to sea from Broadstairs, Kent, by which time Wallis had specified that the bomb must be dropped at &quot;precisely&quot; above the water and ground speed, with back-spin at 500 rpm: the bomb &quot;bounced seven times over some 800 yards, sank and detonated&quot;.

In the operational version of Upkeep, known by its manufacturer as &quot;Vickers Type 464&quot;, the explosive charge was Torpex, originally designed for use as in torpedoes, to provide a longer explosive pulse for greater effect against underwater targets; the principal means of detonation was by three hydrostatic pistols, as used in depth charges, set to fire at a depth of ; and its overall weight was , of which was Torpex. Provision was also made for &quot;self-destruct&quot; detonation by a fuze, armed automatically as the bomb was dropped from the aircraft, and timed to fire after 90 seconds. The bomb was held in place in the aircraft by a large pair of calipers, or triangulated carrying arms, which swung away from either end of the bomb to release it. Back-spin was to begin 10 minutes before arriving at a target and was imparted via a belt driven by a Vickers Jassey hydraulic motor mounted forward of the bomb&#x27;s starboard side. This motor was powered by the hydraulic system normally used by the upper gun turret, which had been removed. Close contact with the dam was necessary to obtain the maximum effectiveness from the explosive.

Height was checked by a pair of intersecting spotlight beams, which, when converging on the surface of the water, indicated the correct height for the aircraft – a method devised for the raid by Benjamin Lockspeiser of the Minister of Aircraft Production, and distance from the target by a simple, hand-held, triangular device: with one corner held up to the eye, projections on the other two corners would line up with pre-determined points on the target when it was at the correct distance for bomb release. In practice, this could prove awkward to handle, and some aircrews replaced it with their own arrangements, fixed within the aircraft itself, and involving chinagraph and string.

On the night of 16/17 May 1943, Operation Chastise attacked dams in Germany&#x27;s Ruhr Valley, using Upkeep. Two dams were breached, causing widespread flooding, damage, and loss of life. The significance of this attack upon the progress of the war is debated. British losses during the operation were heavy; eight of the 19 attacking aircraft failed to return, along with 53 of 113 RAF aircrew. The breach resulted in the deaths of roughly 1600 civilians, including around 1000 prisoners and slave laborers. Upkeep was not used again operationally. By the time the war ended, the remaining operational Upkeep bombs had started to deteriorate and were dumped into the North Sea without their detonation devices.

===Highball===
In April 1942, Wallis himself had described his proposed bomb as &quot;essentially a weapon for the Fleet Air Arm&quot;. This naval aspect was later to be pressed by a minute issued by British prime minister Winston Churchill, in February 1943, asking &quot;Have you given up all plans for doing anything to while she is in Trondheim? ... It is a terrible thing that this prize should be waiting and no one be able to think of a way of winning it.&quot; However, Highball was ultimately developed as an RAF weapon for use against various targets, including &quot;Tirpitz&quot;.

From November 1942, development and testing for Highball continued alongside that of Upkeep, including the dropping of prototypes at both Chesil Beach and Reculver. While early prototypes dropped at Chesil Beach in December 1942 were forerunners for both versions of the bomb, those dropped at Chesil Beach in January and February 1943 and at Reculver in April 1943 included Highball prototypes. They were dropped by the modified Wellington bomber and at Reculver by a modified de Havilland Mosquito B Mk IV, one of two assigned to Vickers Armstrong for the purpose. By early February 1943, Wallis envisaged Highball as &quot;comprising a charge in a cylinder contained in a sphere with (an overall weight) of &quot;; a modified Mosquito could carry two such weapons.
In tests at Reculver in the middle of April 1943, it was found that Highball&#x27;s spherical casing suffered similar damage to that of Upkeep. A prototype with an altered design of casing strengthened by steel plate, but empty of inert filling or explosive, was dropped on 30 April and emerged &quot;quite undamaged&quot;. In further testing on 2 May, two examples of this prototype with inert filling, bounced across the surface of the water as intended, though both were found to be dented.

Further testing was carried out by three modified Mosquitoes flying from RAF Turnberry, north of Girvan, on the west coast of Scotland, against a target ship, the former French battleship , which had been moored for the purpose in Loch Striven. This series of tests, on 9 and 10 May, was hampered by a number of errors: buoys intended to mark a point from &quot;Courbet&quot;, where the prototypes were to be dropped, were found to be too close to the ship by , and, according to Wallis, other errors were due to &quot;Variations in dimensions of [prototypes] after filling and [dimensionally incorrect] jigs for setting up the [caliper] arms&quot;. Because of these errors, the prototypes hit the target too fast and too hard. Two aircraft failed to release their prototypes, one of which then fell off while the aircraft was turning for a second attempt.

It was under such circumstances that Upkeep came to be deployed independently of Highball. In addition to continuing problems in testing Highball, it had been observed at the end of March 1943 that &quot;At best [aircrews] would need two months&#x27; special training&quot;. With this in mind, 618 Squadron had been formed on 1 April 1943 at RAF Skitten, near Wick, in northeastern Scotland, to undertake &quot;Operation Servant&quot;, in which &quot;Tirpitz&quot; would be attacked with Highball bouncing bombs. On 18 April it was recommended that Operation Servant should be undertaken before the end of June, since 618 Squadron could not be held back for this purpose indefinitely. It was not until early September 1943 that, in view of continuing problems with both Highball and its release mechanism, most of 618 Squadron was &quot;released for other duties&quot;. This in practice meant the abandonment of Operation Servant. Core personnel of 618 Squadron were retained and these continued work on the development of Highball.

Testing between 15 and 17 May 1944 showed progress with Highball. By this time &quot;Courbet&quot; had been designated for use as a Gooseberry breakwater for the invasion of Normandy, so the old battleship , then in reserve, was used instead (also moored in Loch Striven). With crew on board &quot;Malaya&quot;, bombers dropped inert Highball prototypes fitted with hydrostatic pistols, aiming at the ship. They struck the ship, and at least two punched a hole in the ship&#x27;s side. On 17 May, for the first time, Highball prototypes were released in pairs, only one second apart.

By the end of May 1944, problems with releasing Highball had been resolved as had problems with aiming. Aiming Highball required a different method from Upkeep; the problem was solved by Wallis&#x27;s design of a ring aperture sight fixed to a flying helmet. Highball was now a sphere with flattened , and the explosive charge was Torpex, enclosed in a cylinder, as in Upkeep; detonation was by a single hydrostatic pistol, set to fire at a depth of , and its weight was , of which was Torpex.

Highball was never used operationally: on 12 November 1944, in Operation Catechism, Lancasters with Tallboy bombs sank its primary target, &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. Other potential targets had been considered during Highball&#x27;s development and later. These included the ships of the Italian navy, canals, dry docks, submarine pens, and railway tunnels (for which testing took place in 1943). But Italy surrendered in September 1943, and the other target ideas were dismissed as impracticable.

In January 1945, at the Vickers experimental facility at Foxwarren, near Cobham, Surrey, a Douglas A-26 Invader medium bomber of the USAAF was adapted to carry two Highballs almost completely enclosed in the bomb bay, using parts from a Mosquito conversion. After brief flight testing in the UK, the kit was sent to Wright Field, Ohio, and installed in a A-26C Invader. Twenty-five inert Highballs, renamed &quot;Speedee&quot; bombs, were also sent for use in the USAAF trials. Drop tests were carried out over Choctawhatchee Bay near Eglin Field, Florida, but the programme was abandoned after the bomb bounced back in a drop on Water Range 60, causing loss of the rear fuselage and a fatal crash on 28 April 1945.

===Baseball===
As well as the two types listed above, a smaller weapon, for use by motor torpedo boats, was proposed by the Admiralty in December 1942. Known as &quot;Baseball&quot;, it was going to be a tube-launched weapon weighing , of which half would be explosive, with an anticipated range of .

In July 2017, two Highballs were successfully recovered from Loch Striven in a joint operation by teams from East Cheshire Sub-Aqua Club and the Royal Navy. One is now displayed at the de Havilland Aircraft Museum and the other arrived at Brooklands Museum in late 2019 after undergoing conservation at the Mary Rose Trust.

==German bouncing bomb==
After Operation Chastise, German forces discovered an Upkeep bomb intact in the wreckage of the Lancaster commanded by Flt Lt Barlow, which had struck high tension cables at Haldern, near Rees, Germany, and crashed. The bomb had not been released and the aircraft had crashed on land, so none of the detonation devices had been set off. Subsequently, a version of Upkeep, code-named &quot;Kurt&quot; or &quot;Emil&quot;, was built at the Luftwaffe&#x27;s &quot;Erprobungsstelle&quot;, or &quot;test site&quot;, on Germany&#x27;s Baltic coast at Travemünde, one in a network of four such establishments in Nazi Germany. The importance of back-spin was not understood and trials by a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 proved to be dangerous to the aircraft, because the bomb matched the speed at which it was dropped. Attempts to rectify that with booster rockets failed and the project was cancelled in 1944.

==Re-creating the bouncing bomb==
In 2011, a project led by Dr Hugh Hunt of the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, re-created the bouncing bomb and tested it in a Dambusters-like raid. Buffalo Airways was selected as the company to fly the mission with their Douglas DC-4. The project was documented in the documentary television show &quot;Dambusters Fly Again&quot; in Canada and Australia, &quot;&quot; in the UK, and the Nova episode &quot;Bombing Hitler&#x27;s Dams&quot; in the US. It involved dropping a replica dummy bomb, which performed as intended, striking a replica dam which had been specially constructed; this was subsequently destroyed by a charge placed where the bomb had landed. The filming of the documentary was itself documented as part of the &quot;Ice Pilots NWT&quot; reality television series that follows Buffalo Airways in season 3 episode 2 &quot;Dambusters&quot;.

<text>In geology, petrifaction or petrification () is the process by which organic material becomes a fossil through the replacement of the original material and the filling of the original pore spaces with minerals. Petrified wood typifies this process, but all organisms, from bacteria to vertebrates, can become petrified (although harder, more durable matter such as bone, beaks, and shells survive the process better than softer remains such as muscle tissue, feathers, or skin). Petrification takes place through a combination of two similar processes: permineralization and replacement. These processes create replicas of the original specimen that are similar down to the microscopic level.

== Processes ==

=== Permineralization ===

One of the processes involved in petrifaction is permineralization. The fossils created through this process tend to contain a large amount of the original material of the specimen. This process occurs when groundwater containing dissolved minerals (most commonly quartz, calcite, apatite (calcium phosphate), siderite (iron carbonate), and pyrite), fills pore spaces and cavities of specimens, particularly bone, shell or wood. The pores of the organisms&#x27; tissues are filled when these minerals precipitate out of the water. Two common types of permineralization are silicification and pyritization.

==== Silicification ====
Silicification is the process in which organic matter becomes saturated with silica. A common source of silica is volcanic material. Studies have shown that in this process, most of the original organic matter is destroyed. Silicification most often occurs in two environments—either the specimen is buried in sediments of deltas and floodplains or organisms are buried in volcanic ash. Water must be present for silicification to occur because it reduces the amount of oxygen present and therefore reduces the deterioration of the organism by fungi, maintains organism shape, and allows for the transportation and deposition of silica. The process begins when a specimen is permeated with an aqueous silica solution. The cell walls of the specimen are progressively dissolved and silica is deposited into the empty spaces. In wood samples, as the process proceeds, cellulose and lignin, two components of wood, are degraded and replaced with silica. The specimen is transformed to stone (a process called lithification) as water is lost. For silicification to occur, the geothermic conditions must include a neutral to slightly acidic pH&lt;ref name=&quot;Leo/Barghoorn&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a temperature and pressure similar to shallow-depth sedimentary environments. Under ideal natural conditions, silicification can occur at rates approaching those seen in artificial petrification.

==== Pyritization ====

Pyritization is a process similar to silicification, but instead involves the deposition of iron and sulfur in the pores and cavities of an organism. Pyritization can result in both solid fossils as well as preserved soft tissues. In marine environments, pyritization occurs when organisms are buried in sediments containing a high concentration of iron sulfides. Organisms release sulfide, which reacts with dissolved iron in the surrounding water, when they decay. This reaction between iron and sulfides forms pyrite (FeS2). Carbonate shell material of the organism is then replaced with pyrite due to a higher concentration of pyrite and a lower concentration of carbonate in the surrounding water. Pyritization occurs to a lesser extent in plants in clay environments.

=== Replacement ===
Replacement, the second process involved in petrifaction, occurs when water containing dissolved minerals dissolves the original solid material of an organism, which is then replaced by minerals. This can take place extremely slowly, replicating the microscopic structure of the organism. The slower the rate of the process, the better defined the microscopic structure will be. The minerals commonly involved in replacement are calcite, silica, pyrite, and hematite. Biotic remains preserved by replacement alone (as opposed to in combination with permineralization) are rarely found, but these fossils present significance to paleontology because they tend to be more detailed.

== Uses ==

Not only are the fossils produced through the process of petrifaction used for paleontological study, but they have also been used as both decorative and informative pieces. Petrified wood is used in several ways. Slabs of petrified wood can be crafted into tabletops, or the slabs themselves are sometimes displayed in a decorative fashion. Also, larger pieces of the wood have been carved into sinks and basins. Other large pieces can also be crafted into chairs and stools. Petrified wood and other petrified organisms have also been used in jewelry, sculpture, clock-making, ashtrays and fruit bowls, and landscape and garden decorations.

=== Architecture ===

Petrified wood has also been used in construction. The Petrified Wood Gas Station, located on Main St Lamar, Colorado, was built in 1932 and consists of walls and floors constructed from pieces of petrified wood. The structure, built by W.G. Brown, has since been converted to office space and a used car dealership. Glen Rose, Texas provides even more examples of the use of fossilized wood in architecture. Beginning in the 1920s, the farmers of Somervell County, Texas began uncovering petrified trees. Local craftsmen and masons then built over 65 structures from this petrified wood, 45 of which were still standing as of June 2009. These structures include gas stations, flowerbeds, cottages, restaurants, fountains and gateposts. Glen Rose, Texas is also noted for Dinosaur Valley State Park and the Glen Rose Formation, where fossilized dinosaur footprints from the Cretaceous period can be viewed. Another example of the use of petrified wood in construction is the Agate House Pueblo in the Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. Built by ancestral Pueblo people about 990 years ago, this eight-room building was constructed almost entirely out of petrified wood and is believed to have served as either a family home or meeting place.

== Artificial petrifaction ==
Scientists attempted to artificially petrify organisms as early as the 18th century, when Girolamo Segato claimed to have supposedly &quot;petrified&quot; human remains. His methods were lost, but the bulk of his &quot;pieces&quot; are on display at the Museum of the Department of Anatomy in Florence, Italy.

More recent attempts have been both successful and documented, but should be considered as semi-petrifaction or incomplete petrifaction or at least as producing some novel type of wood composite, as the wood material remains to a certain degree; the constituents of wood (cellulose, lignins, lignans, oleoresins, etc.) have not been replaced by silicate, but have been infiltrated by specially formulated acidic solutions of aluminosilicate salts that gel in contact with wood matter and form a matrix of silicates within the wood after being left to react slowly for a given period of time in the solution or heat-cured for faster results. Hamilton Hicks of Greenwich, Connecticut, received a patent for his &quot;recipe&quot; for rapid artificial petrifaction of wood under US patent 4,612,050 in 1986. Hicks&#x27; recipe consists of highly mineralized water and a sodium silicate solution combined with a dilute acid with a pH of 4.0-5.5. Samples of wood are penetrated with this mineral solution through repeated submersion and applications of the solution. Wood treated in this fashion is - according to the claims in the patent - incapable of being burned and acquires the features of petrified wood. Some uses of this product as suggested by Hicks include use by horse breeders who desire fireproof stables constructed of nontoxic material that would also be resistant to chewing of the wood by horses.

In 2005 scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) reported that they had successfully petrified wood samples artificially. Unlike natural petrification, though, they infiltrated samples in acidic solutions, diffused them internally with titanium and carbon and fired them in a high-temperature oven (circa 1400 °C) in an inert atmosphere to yield a man-made ceramic matrix composite of titanium carbide and silicon carbide still showing the initial structure of wood. Future uses could see these artificially petrified wood-ceramic materials eventually used in the tool industry. Other vegetal matter could be treated in a similar process and yield abrasive powders.

<text>Daniel Filipacchi (born 12 January 1928) is the Chairman Emeritus of Hachette Filipacchi Médias and a French collector of surrealist art.

== Career ==

Filipacchi wrote and worked as a photographer for &quot;Paris Match&quot; from its founding in 1949 by Jean Prouvost. Filipacchi later claimed never to have enjoyed taking photographs, despite earning early notoriety as a &quot;well-mannered paparazzo&quot;. While working at &quot;Paris Match&quot; and as a photographer for another of Prouvost&#x27;s titles, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, Filipacchi promoted jazz concerts and ran a record label. In the early 1960s, at a time when jazz was not played on government-owned French radio stations, Filipacchi (a widely acknowledged jazz expert) and Frank Ténot hosted an immensely popular show on Europe 1 called &quot;Pour ceux qui aiment le jazz&quot; (&quot;For those who love jazz&quot;).

In the 1960s, he presented a rock and roll radio show modeled after &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s American Bandstand&quot; and called &quot;Salut les copains&quot;, which launched the musical genre of yé-yé. The show&#x27;s success led to his creation of a magazine of the same name. The latter was eventually renamed as &quot;Salut!&quot; and built a circulation of one million copies. Filipacchi played American and French rock music on this radio show beginning in the early 1960s. Both he and this show are credited with playing important roles in the formation of the 1960s youth culture in France.

Filipacchi acquired the venerable &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; in 1964. &quot;Cahiers&quot; was in serious financial trouble and its owners appealed to Filipacchi to buy a majority share in order to save it from ruin. He hired a number of new people and redesigned the journal to look more modern, zippy, and youth-appealing. The revolutionary May 1968 events in France affected the subsequent evolution of &quot;Cahiers&quot; into a more political forum, under the influence of Maoist director Jean-Luc Godard and others. Filipacchi lost interest in the magazine and sold his share in 1969.

But he remained involved in that world, starting more magazines and acquiring others, such as &quot;Paris Match&quot; in 1976. He owned specialty magazines, for instance, some were for teenage girls (such as &quot;Mademoiselle Age Tendre&quot;) and others for men (such as &quot;Lui&quot;), which Filipacchi had founded in 1963 with Jacques Lanzmann. He also acquired &quot;Newlook&quot; and French editions of American magazines &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot;. 

In February 1979 Filipacchi bought the then-defunct &quot;Look&quot;. He hired Jann Wenner to run it in May 1979 but the revival was a failure, and Filipacchi fired the entire staff in July 1979.

== Art collecting ==
&quot;ARTnews&quot; has repeatedly listed Filipacchi among the world&#x27;s top art collectors. Art from Filipacchi&#x27;s collection formed part of the 1996 exhibit &quot;Private Passions&quot; at the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. His collection (along with that of his best friend, the record producer Nesuhi Ertegün) was exhibited at the Guggenheim in New York in 1999 in &quot;Surrealism: Two Private Eyes, the Nesuhi Ertegun and Daniel Filipacchi Collections&quot; - an event described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;powerful exhibition&quot;, large enough to &quot;pack the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum from ceiling to lobby&quot;.

Although Filipacchi sued the Paris gallery which sold him a fake &quot;Max Ernst&quot; painting in 2006 for US$7 million, he called its notorious forger Wolfgang Beltracchi (freed on 9 January 2015 after serving three years in prison for his forgeries) a &quot;genius&quot; in a 2012 interview.

== Personal life ==
His father, Henri Filipacchi, who was born in İzmir, Turkey, descended from shipowners from Venice, hence the Italian family name. Filipacchi has three children. The eldest of these, Mimi, was from an early marriage. He then had two children with fashion model Sondra Peterson: Craig and novelist Amanda Filipacchi.

<doc id="602851" wikidata="Q362118" url="?curid=602851" title="Edward Stettinius Jr.">
<text>Edward Reilly Stettinius Jr. (October 22, 1900 – October 31, 1949) was an American businessman who served as United States Secretary of State under Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman from 1944 to 1945, and as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in 1946.

==Early life and education==
Stettinius was born in Chicago, Illinois, on October 22, 1900, the younger of two sons and third of four children of Edward R. Stettinius and Judith Carrington. His mother was a Virginian of colonial English ancestry. His father was of German descent and was a native of St. Louis, Missouri.

The younger Stettinius grew up in a mansion on the family&#x27;s estate on Staten Island and graduated from the Pomfret School in 1920, after which he attended the University of Virginia until 1924. He finished very few courses and never took a degree. Instead he spent his time on charitable outreach to poor families. He became a member of the secret Seven Society.

==Career==
In 1926, Stettinius began working at General Motors as a stock clerk, but his connections made for rapid advancement. He became assistant to John Lee Pratt, a friend of the family, and by 1931 he had become vice president of public and industrial relations. At General Motors, he worked to develop unemployment relief programs and came into contact with New York Governor Franklin Roosevelt.

In the 1930s, Stettinius&#x27;s work in the private sector alternated with public service. He served on the Industrial Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration (1933). In 1934 he returned to the private sector when he joined U.S. Steel, the nation&#x27;s largest corporation; he eventually become chairman in 1938.

He then returned to public service, serving on the National Defense Advisory Commission, as chairman of the War Resources Board (1939) and administrator of the Lend-Lease Program (1941). He held the latter position until he became undersecretary of state in 1943. In January 1944, Macmillan published his book, &quot;Lend-Lease, Weapon for Victory&quot;.

The poor health of Secretary of State Cordell Hull made Stettinius the chair of the 1944 Dumbarton Oaks Conference and, in December 1944, he succeeded Hull as Secretary of State.

While Secretary of State, Stettinius composed in 1944 an airgram describing Bulgaro-Yugoslav efforts at establishing an independent &quot;Macedonian&quot; state (i.e., Vardarska) as &quot;unjustified demagoguery representing no ethnic or political reality&quot; (implying that the Macedonians are Greek), and &quot;a possible cloak for aggressive intentions against Greece&quot;:

Stettinius was a member of the US delegation to the February 1945 Yalta Conference.

Truman thought Stettinius was too soft on communism, and had yielded too much to Moscow when he was Roosevelt&#x27;s advisor at Yalta. Truman had an old Senate friend in mind as a replacement, James F. Byrnes. Stettinius resigned as Secretary of State to accept the position of the first United States Ambassador to the United Nations. He chaired the United States delegation to the United Nations Conference on International Organization held in San Francisco from April 25 to June 26, 1945, which brought together delegates from 50 Allied nations to create the United Nations. Charles W. Yost, who had been Under Secretary of State Stettinius&#x27; assistant in the State Department, was named Stettinius&#x27; Executive Secretary at the United Nations Conference.

Stettinius resigned in June 1946, as he became critical of what he saw as Truman&#x27;s refusal to use the UN as a tool to resolve tensions with the Soviet Union. For three years after his return to private life, Stettinius served as rector of the University of Virginia. In 1947, Stettinius and friend William Tubman, the president of Liberia, helped form the Liberia Company (now International Registries), a partnership between the Liberian government and American financiers to provide funds for the development of the African nation.

== Personal life ==
On May 15, 1926, Stettinius married Virginia Gordon Wallace, daughter of a prominent family of Richmond, Virginia. They had three children: Edward Reilly III and twins Wallace and Joseph.

During his retirement, Stettinius lived at his Virginia estate, The Horseshoe, on the Rapidan River. He died of a coronary thrombosis on October 31, 1949, at the home of a sister in Greenwich, Connecticut, at the age of 49, and was buried in the family plot in Locust Valley Cemetery, Locust Valley, New York.

==Archive==
Stettinius&#x27;s voluminous archive of more than 1,000 boxes resides at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia.

<text>William Joseph Parnell MacMillan (March 24, 1881 – December 7, 1957) was a physician and Prince Edward Island politician.

==Life and career==
Born in Clermont, MacMillan was a graduate of Prince of Wales College and the McGill University Faculty of Medicine.

After running a medical practice for several years, MacMillan entered politics in 1923 winning a seat in the provincial legislative assembly as a Conservative. In 1932 he became the province&#x27;s first minister of health and education. As minister he rebuilt Prince of Wales College and the Provincial Mental Hospital which had both been destroyed by fire. He also secured a Carnegie Foundation endowment that enabled the government to establish a provincial library system.

When Premier James D. Stewart became ill, MacMillan served as acting premier and then became the 18th premier of Prince Edward Island when Stewart died in 1933. MacMillan&#x27;s government implemented relief programs and increasing government spending to help dampen the impact of the Great Depression. Nevertheless, his government was swept from power in the 1935 election which saw the Liberals capture every seat in the legislature. He returned to the legislature in 1939 and remained leader of the Conservative Party until the late 1940s and a member of the legislature until he lost his seat in the 1955 election.

MacMillan was named the province&#x27;s lieutenant governor on November 22, 1957 but died before being sworn in.

<text>Spirit of the West were a Canadian folk rock band from North Vancouver, active from 1983 to 2016. They were popular on the Canadian folk music scene in the 1980s before evolving a blend of hard rock, Britpop, and Celtic folk influences which made them one of Canada&#x27;s most successful alternative rock acts in the 1990s.

==Early years==
Geoffrey Kelly and J. Knutson had begun playing music together as a duo when Kelly&#x27;s then-girlfriend Alison, at the time a theatre student, told them she had a classmate with a really great singing voice. That classmate, John Mann, joined Kelly and Knutson as a folk trio called Eavesdropper, and scored early gigs as an opening act for rockers such as Art Bergmann and Barney Bentall. Early on their set predominantly comprised covers of artists such as Bruce Cockburn, Eric Bogle, Richard Thompson and Billy Bragg, with original compositions gradually introduced into their set.

After a gig on Vancouver Island was erroneously billed as &quot;Eavesdroppings&quot;, the band opted to change its name to Spirit of the West, and independently released the album &quot;Spirit of the West&quot; in 1984 before signing to Stony Plain Records, a roots music label based in Edmonton, Alberta.

Stony Plain released &quot;Tripping Up the Stairs&quot; in 1986. Following that album Hugh McMillan joined the band and the band toured through 1987 as a quartet with Hugh on bass. In October 1987 Jay Knutson left the band to join the Winnipeg based band Hart Rouged and pursue a &quot;solo&quot; career. 

1988&#x27;s &quot;Labour Day&quot; spawned the popular single &quot;Political&quot; and consolidated the band as a significant draw on the folk festival circuit. The album also garnered the band its first Juno Award nomination, for Best Roots &amp; Traditional Album at the Juno Awards of 1989.

After that album&#x27;s tour, McMillan took a temporary hiatus from the band in December of 1988 for personal reasons and to pursue solo interests. He was replaced by Daniel Lapp and Linda McRae, but returned before the band&#x27;s next album was recorded. When McMillan returned, Lapp left the band in June of 1989 due to his wife becoming pregnant, but McRae stayed on. (As a result, Lapp never actually appeared on a Spirit of the West recording. He pursued a solo career, however, releasing a number of albums of experimental jazz/folk/electronic fusion.)

On the strength of &quot;Political&quot;, Warner Bros. Records signed the band in 1989, and Stony Plain released a compilation, &quot;Old Material 1984–1986&quot;, to close out their contract with the label.

In 1990, the band&#x27;s major label debut, &quot;Save This House&quot; was released. The album track &quot;Home for a Rest&quot;, which was considered a classic party anthem at universities across Canada was not officially released as a commercial or radio single, but became the band&#x27;s signature song. (Despite its not being a single, a music video was released for the song.)

==Evolution==
As part of their tour to support &quot;Save This House&quot;, the band toured England with The Wonder Stuff, and decided to bring in a drummer and experiment with a more rock-oriented sound — a need which became particularly acute after the bands played two shows on the same bill as Jane&#x27;s Addiction. After recording some song demos with guest drummer Darrell Mayes of the Colin James band and then touring for part of 1990 with various session drummers, the band brought in Vince Ditrich, who appeared for the first time on the band&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Go Figure&quot;.

Although the album retained many of the band&#x27;s folk influences, it was more hard rock than any of the band&#x27;s previous efforts, and this proved controversial among the band&#x27;s fans. The album included a rock rendition of &quot;Political&quot;, and at one show in London, Ontario, the audience presented the band with a petition demanding that they play the original version of that song. Despite the controversies, however, it won them many new fans in the alternative rock scene.

The band received a Juno Award nomination for Most Promising Group at the Juno Awards of 1991.

MacRae also appeared on The Wonder Stuff&#x27;s album &quot;Never Loved Elvis&quot;, and all of the members of both bands recorded a cover of the country standard &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; as a B-side for the Wonder Stuff&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to the Cheap Seats&quot; single. Over the winter of 1992-93, the band undertook the Hollow Bodies tour, performing material in their older acoustic style.

In 1993, the band released their most successful album, &quot;Faithlift&quot;, and scored their biggest hit single, &quot;And if Venice is Sinking&quot;. 1995&#x27;s &quot;Two Headed&quot;, in turn, garnered significant airplay for the single &quot;Tell Me What I Think&quot;, and the band garnered a Juno Award nomination for Group of the Year at the Juno Awards of 1995. However, the album was not as successful on the charts, or as critically hailed, as its predecessor.

In the summer of 1995, the band toured with The Tragically Hip as part of the Another Roadside Attraction festival.

Beginning in 1995, the band also performed a number of shows with symphony orchestras across Canada, premiering songs written for a planned symphony album with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. After recording two shows with the VSO on May 12 and May 13, 1995, they released the album &quot;Open Heart Symphony&quot; that year; the concert also aired on Bravo concurrently with the album&#x27;s release.

At the end of 1996, McRae left the band amicably to pursue a solo career, performing her last show on New Year&#x27;s Eve of that year. She released a solo country album in 1997, and then formed the alternative country band Cheerful Lonesome.

The remaining members recorded 1997&#x27;s &quot;Weights and Measures&quot; as a four-piece at Martin Barre&#x27;s studio in Devon, England, working with Barre and members of The Wonder Stuff, Capercaillie and Fairport Convention to round out the studio effort, and added Tobin Frank for their concert tour. In the same year, a studio version of the song &quot;Kiss &amp; Tell&quot;, which had previously been released only in its live form on &quot;Open Heart Symphony&quot;, appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Hanging Garden&quot;.

However, with the music industry&#x27;s emphasis having shifted by this time away from alternative rock and back toward more mainstream pop-oriented performers, Warner Bros. put little effort into promoting the album, and dropped the band from their roster after the tour.

==Hiatus and revival==
After &quot;Weights &amp; Measures&quot; the band took a hiatus from recording and broad-scale national touring, although they continued to perform selected live dates on the summer folk festival circuit and in major concert markets such as Vancouver and Toronto. During the hiatus, Mann, Ditrich and Kelly all released solo albums, Mann pursued acting roles, McMillan worked as a session musician and producer for The Town Pants, and Kelly and Frank recorded with The Paperboys.

The band&#x27;s first new album in seven years, &quot;Star Trails&quot;, was released on July 6, 2004 on MapleMusic Recordings.

In 2008, the band released a 25th anniversary compilation, &quot;Spirituality 1983-2008: The Consummate Compendium&quot;, on Rhino Records. The two-CD set includes 32 remastered tracks from throughout the band&#x27;s career, including two new songs, &quot;Winter&#x27;s Now the Enemy&quot; and &quot;Another Happy New Year&quot;. Their official 25th anniversary concert, held at Vancouver&#x27;s Commodore Ballroom on March 14, 2008, was recorded and broadcast by CBC Radio 2. Concurrently with the release of &quot;Spirituality&quot;, Rhino also released remastered editions of &quot;Faithlift&quot; and &quot;Open Heart Symphony&quot;.

In 2009, Spirit of the West opened for Great Big Sea on the &quot;Fortune&#x27;s Favour&quot; tour, finishing in Victoria, British Columbia on March 26. On this tour, the final encore performances typically involved both bands performing together on various songs, including Spirit of the West&#x27;s &quot;Political&quot; and Great Big Sea&#x27;s &quot;The Old Black Rum&quot;.

In 2010, Kelly, Ditrich and Frank joined Ashley MacIsaac and folk musician Matthew Harder in recording a charity single, &quot;Dreams&quot;, to benefit Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong, a skier from Ghana who was the first Ghanaian athlete ever to compete in the Winter Olympics. Nkrumah-Acheampong himself participated in the recording, playing traditional Ghanaian percussion. The single, credited to The Parallel Band, was released to iTunes on February 19, 2010. Concurrently, Mann was in Edmonton, starring in a stage production of Bruce Ruddell&#x27;s rock musical &quot;Beyond Eden&quot;. In 2011, the full Spirit of the West lineup recorded and released another charity single, &quot;Bulembu&quot;, to benefit the Bulembu orphanage and sustainable economic development project in Swaziland; the song also includes a vocal choir of children from Bulembu.

Kelly underwent surgery in early 2012 and was unable to perform for several weeks; Harder and Kendel Carson of The Paperboys substituted for him in several live shows during this period, including the band&#x27;s traditional annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day show at the Commodore Ballroom. At the band&#x27;s 2014 St. Patrick&#x27;s Day show, they were inducted into the British Columbia Entertainment Hall of Fame.

==Conclusion==
In September 2014, Mann announced that he had been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, but planned to continue performing with the band as long as he remained able to do so. In concession to Mann&#x27;s illness, the band began performing with an iPad mounted near the microphone in case Mann had difficulty remembering the lyrics, while Harder joined full-time to take over Mann&#x27;s duties on lead guitar. Weeks after the announcement, Mann performed a concert featuring his solo material and that of Spirit of the West, which was broadcast by CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Absolutely Canadian&quot; in July 2015 as &quot;John Mann Here and Now&quot;.

The band&#x27;s preparations for a 2015 concert at Massey Hall are profiled in Pete McCormack&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Spirit Unforgettable&quot;.

In December 2015, the band announced that they would perform a three-night run at the Commodore Ballroom from April 15 to 17 as their final shows. Over the month before the final shows, the band undertook a small-scale final tour.

As Ditrich was also in poor health with kidney disease, he was not able to perform for the full duration of all three Commodore shows, and shared drum duties with Kris MacFarlane and Pat Steward. Kendel Carson, Paul Hyde, Jim Cuddy, Steven Page, Colin James, Andy Maize and Craig Northey also participated in the Commodore shows as guests.

The band remained informally active through private &quot;Johnny Jams&quot; as a form of music therapy for Mann, and Kelly communicated the hope that Mann would remain healthy enough for the band to play occasional brief reunion sets in the future. Following The Tragically Hip&#x27;s announcement in May 2016 that singer Gord Downie had been diagnosed with brain cancer but would undertake a tour with the band in summer 2016, Kelly was interviewed by both CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;Day 6&quot; and &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; about his experiences performing with Spirit of the West under similar circumstances.

The band performed a reunion set at Spirit of Canada, a benefit concert for Alzheimer&#x27;s awareness at the Commodore Ballroom on November 19, 2017. The concert&#x27;s lineup included Odds, Barney Bentall, Dustin Bentall, Jim Byrnes, Kendel Carson, Jim Cuddy, Alan Doyle, Colin James, Sarah McLachlan, Ed Robertson, Shari Ulrich and Spirit: The Next Generation, an act consisting of the band members&#x27; children. Before the show, the performing musicians participated in a group recording of the band&#x27;s signature song &quot;Home for a Rest&quot; as a tribute to Mann.

Mann died on November 20, 2019.

<text>Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) was a project designed to discover asteroids and comets that orbit near the Earth. The project, funded by NASA, was directed by astronomer Ted Bowell of Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. The LONEOS project began in 1993 and ran until the end of February 2008.

== Hardware ==

LONEOS, in its final configuration, used a 0.6-meter f/1.8 Schmidt telescope, acquired from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1990, and a Lowell-built 16 megapixel CCD detector. This combination of instruments provided a field of view of 2.88 by 2.88 degrees (8.3 square degrees). It had a maximum nightly scan area of about 1,000 square degrees (covered four times). The instrument could cover the entire accessible dark sky in about a month. The CCD has detected asteroids as faint as visual magnitude 19.8 but its typical limiting visual magnitude was 19.3. The instrument is located at Lowell Observatory&#x27;s dark sky site, Anderson Mesa Station, near Flagstaff, Arizona, US.

Four computers were used. Two were used for frame reductions, one for telescope pointing control and one for camera control. The camera control software had scripting capability and could control all the other computers.

== Technique ==

Asteroids were found by obtaining four pictures (frames) of the same region of sky, each frame temporally separated by 15 to 30 minutes. The set of four frames were then submitted to reduction software which located all star-like sources on the frame and identified sources that moved with asteroid-like motion. The observer visually examined all asteroid detections that had motion different from a typical main-belt asteroid. Human examination was required because most putative NEO detections were not real but some kind of imaging artifact.

All asteroid positions were converted to equatorial coordinates. Various USNO star catalogs were used for this conversion until 2007. Then the Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalog was used, along with supplemental information from the Carlsberg Catalog and the 2MASS catalog. Asteroid brightness was converted to standard visual magnitude. This data, along with the time of the observations, were sent to the Minor Planet Center (MPC) from which they were distributed to the scientific community. Potential near-Earth objects were handled expeditiously so that other observers could locate the asteroid on the same night and make further observations.

Telescope operation was automated to the extent that the survey could be run all night without observer intervention. However, the telescope was seldom operated in the automatic mode because an observer was required to reduce data promptly and to correct any malfunctions that might have occurred.

== Discoveries ==
As of 2017, LONEOS is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 22,077 minor planets between 1998 and 2008. The discoveries include main-belt asteroids, near-Earth Objects (NEO) and Mars-crossers. During the period of LONEOS operation, several other NASA funded NEO searches were underway (number of discoveries in parentheses):
* LINEAR (148,287)
* Spacewatch (135,705)
* Mount Lemmon Survey (54,542)
* Near Earth Asteroid Tracking (41,092)
* and Catalina Sky Survey (26,294)

Amateur observers made a significant contribution during this time with independent NEO discoveries and by performing follow-up observations of recent discoveries made by the NASA sponsored surveys.

=== NEO-discovery statistics ===

The table below lists the number of discoveries made by LONEOS each year of operation. Asteroids thought to be larger than one kilometer in diameter were used as benchmarks in assessing survey completeness. Hence, some table elements have two numbers separated by a slash. The second number represents the number of discoveries larger than one kilometer. The column labeled &quot;Asteroid Observations&quot; is the number of observations sent to the Minor Planet Center. Each asteroid was typically observed four times (once per frame) each night.

A complete list of LONEOS NEO observations can be found at the NeoDys web site.

<doc id="602871" wikidata="Q205379" url="?curid=602871" title="Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)">
<text>The Battle of Breitenfeld (; ) or First Battle of Breitenfeld (in older texts sometimes known as Battle of Leipzig), was fought at a crossroads near Breitenfeld approximately 8 km north-west of the walled city of Leipzig on 17 September (Gregorian calendar), or 7 September (Julian calendar, in wide use at the time), 1631. A Swedish-Saxon army led by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and Saxon Elector John George I defeated an Imperial-Catholic League Army led by &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly. It was the Protestants&#x27; first major victory of the Thirty Years War.

Sweden entered the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1628 in an attempt to prevent the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II from expanding his power to the Baltic Sea and threaten Swedish territory. King Gustavus Adolphus landed with a Swedish army in the Duchy of Pomerania in 1630 to intervene in favor of the German Protestants. In the spring of 1631, Field Marshal Tilly had assembled an army to restore Imperial control over northern Germany. Already that summer, Tilly invaded the Electorate of Saxony, whose Elector John George I chose to enter into an alliance with Gustavus Adolphus. With their united troops totalling 40,150 men, the Protestant armies marched to Leipzig to meet Tilly&#x27;s army, which numbered 31,400 men.

The three armies met outside the village of Breitenfeld in early September 1631. At the start of the battle, the Saxon army was knocked off the battlefield by the imperial cavalry, whereupon Tilly with his infantry tried to engage the Swedish army with a pincer movement. Through quick improvisation and the flexibility and firepower among the Swedish troops, they were able to regroup and launch a series of counterattacks against Tilly&#x27;s troops. When Gustavus Adolphus performed a broad counteroffensive with his cavalry, Tilly was forced to retreat from the battlefield, losing two-thirds of his army after the battle.

The Swedish-Saxon victory at Breitenfeld allowed Gustavus Adolphus to launch a campaign against southern Germany. It was the King&#x27;s most notable military victory and cemented his reputation of being one of the greatest military commanders in modern history. His army at Breitenfeld utilized an early form of combined arms and mobile units, combined with superior discipline, organizational flexibility and initiative. As the war progressed, several armies, including the imperial army, began to adopt the Swedish military doctrine.

==Background== 
 
The Thirty Years&#x27; War was an interweaving of several larger and smaller interlinked conflicts between Protestants and Catholics in Europe. The first spark of the war was the Protestant revolt in Bohemia, which occurred after the much-publicized defenestration of Prague in May 1618. The war was fueled by several internal and external tensions against the Habsburg monarchy. The religious division between the Catholic and Protestant states within the Holy Roman Empire came to develop during the course of the war into a minor world war between the great powers of Europe. During the second half of the war, Catholic France would find itself at war with both the Habsburgs and Catholic Spain. Spain, in turn, had been involved in the Eighty Years&#x27; War against the Netherlands for a long time. Sweden and Russia were in conflict with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Later, Denmark–Norway, the Electorate of Saxony and other smaller German states and imperial cities also became involved in the conflict with the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. At the end of the Bohemian Revolt (1618–1622), the war transitioned into the Palatinate-Danish phase (1623–1629). Through a successful campaign in Northern Germany, the Imperial Army under Generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein was able to defeat the Danish Army. Denmark&#x27;s withdrawal from the war in 1629 led to a de-escalation of the hostilities. Ever since the outbreak of the war, the Protestant states in Germany were forced to endure severe hardships. Against the background of the strengthened position of the Emperor and the Catholic side, the Edict of Restitution was issued in March 1629, which would have brought a killing blow to the independence of the Protestant states. It was against this background, as well as after the signing of the separate treaty with Poland in September 1629, that Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, planned his own intervention in the war and came to be a leading figure for the Protestant co-religionists in Northern Germany.

===Swedish landing in Pomerania=== 
 
Northern Germany was within Sweden&#x27;s immediate sphere of interest. If the Catholic armies were able to build up a fleet in the Baltic Sea, they could become a large threat to Swedish territory. The conflict escalated following Sweden&#x27;s intervention in the war, which then spread further along different fronts both within and outside of Europe&#x27;s borders. Gustavus Adolphus initially laid out the outlines of a diplomatic solution to the conflict, which were intended to satisfy the interests of the Protestants in Northern Germany. After fruitless negotiations with Ferdinand II in Danzig in the spring of 1630, it proved impossible for the King to reach a satisfactory settlement. Despite continued and far-reaching offers, Gustavus Adolphus also initially failed to reach an agreement with Elector John George I of Saxony. As a member of the Electoral College, Saxony held a dominant position among the Protestant estates within the Imperial Diet. During the Elector&#x27;s meeting in Regensburg in August 1630, the Electoral College, who saw the Emperor&#x27;s growing power as a threat, forced the dismissal of Wallenstein and the reduction of both the Imperial and Catholic League&#x27;s armies respectively.

Speaking to the Riksdag of the Estates in 1628 and 1629, Gustavus Adolphus emphasized about the necessity of Sweden&#x27;s entry into the war. This was partly done in defense of the Protestant faith, but also due to the imperial naval armaments in Northern Germany, which could pose a great threat to Swedish territory. After the entire Riksdag approved the king&#x27;s declaration of war, on 17 June 1630, the King and his army of 13,200 men boarded the Swedish fleet at Älvsnabben in the Stockholm archipelago; the fleet consisted of 60 warships and 200 smaller boats. On 25 June 1630 the fleet rounded Cape Perd on Rügen and the king landed with his army at Peenemünde in Usedom two days later. Their landing went unopposed on the Imperial side, whose few garrisons in the general area quickly retreated to Wolgast. Wallenstein was dismissed as Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Army in September 1630. Before leaving his post, Wallenstein&#x27;s last action was to reinforce the garrisons in Pomerania and Mecklenburg with 30,000 men. As these provinces were poor and deprived of means to support these troops, they were unable to be deployed over a large defense perimeter.

From the Baltic Sea, Gustavus Adolphus could supply his army through regular deliveries of supplies from the Swedish mainland. During the first month after the landing, the Swedes occupied the city of Kammin and the islands of Rügen, Usedom and Wollin. On 20 July they captured the Pomeranian capital of Stettin, whose garrison surrendered without resistance. Through the Treaty of Stettin, concluded on 25 August, Duke Bogislav XIV of Pomerania was forced to enter into an alliance with Gustavus Adolphus and assist with supplying the King&#x27;s army. Furthermore, the king received subsidies from the deposed dukes of Mecklenburg, whose territories had previously been occupied by Wallenstein and thus saw the Swedish King as their liberator. At the beginning of August, Swedish Major General Dodo zu Knyphausen besieged Wolgast with his 5,000 men, which he was able to capture after three weeks on 25 August. Shortly afterwards, Knyphausen also tried to besiege the coastal town of Kolberg. When both Kolberg and the nearby town of Greifswald put up stubborn resistance, Knyphausen was forced to withdraw at the end of 1630. Through the summer campaign of 1630, the Swedish bridgehead along the German Baltic Sea coast was consolidated, while the Swedish army was strengthened through the recruitment of mercenaries from the surrounding area.

===Swedish campaigns in Mecklenburg and Pomerania===

At the beginning of his campaign, Gustavus Adolplhus was in great need of both economic and military support from the Protestant powers in Germany, whose enthusiasm for the Swedish landing was extremely limited. Among the Electorates of Saxony and Brandenburg, including some smaller duchies, Gustavus Adolplhus was regarded as a foreign invader. Only William V, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, the city of Magdeburg and the dukes of Mecklenburg and Saxe-Weimar declared themselves in favor of the Swedish King. On the Catholic side, Ferdinand II had an army totaling 100,000 men, but for logistical reasons the force had been steadily reduced to a field army of 60,000 men. It consisted of 40,000 Imperial soldiers and 20,000 Catholic League soldiers under the joint command of Wallenstein&#x27;s successor, &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly. Italian Field Marshal Torquato Conti commanded the Imperial troops in Pomerania. But the absence of Wallenstein created a confusing situation, and the poor condition among Conti&#x27;s troops made him unable to stop Gustavus Adolplhus&#x27;s conquests. 

After the Swedish army consolidated their territories in Pomerania during the summer of 1630, Gustavus Adolplhus was able to advance towards Mecklenburg. Mecklenburg was invaded at the end of September by 12,000 Swedish soldiers, with their main objective of securing the river crossings over the Elbe. Half of these troops, under the direct command of the King, captured the town of Ribnitz and some minor imperial fortresses before launching a siege of the port city of Rostock. Meanwhile, on 23 October his ally William of Hesse-Kassel was defeated by the Imperial Field Marshal Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim, whose troops had arrived in the lower reaches of the Elbe. At the same time, Colonel Federigo di Savelli succeeded in strengthening Rostock&#x27;s defenses, thereby deterring the now numerically inferior Swedish troops. Gustavus Adolplhus decided in mid-October to break off the siege and return to Pomerania.

This fruitless expedition convinced the King to abandon his attempts to capture the crossings of the Elbe, instead turning his attention to the river Oder further east. During the winter months of 1630 he strengthened his army, which including garrisons numbered over 100,000 men by the end of the year. He now divided his army into four separate army corps. The largest was the royal army of 30,000 men, under the King&#x27;s personal command. A corps of 15,000 men led by the king&#x27;s deputy, Field Marshal Gustav Horn, Count of Pori, advanced along the Oder. Later, Horn&#x27;s army was reinforced with 11,000 men under Major General Maximilian Teuffel, who by this time had abandoned the siege of Kolberg. A smaller army corps of 2,500 men under Colonel Dietrich von Falkenberg was sent to reinforce the garrison of Magdeburg. Finally, a British expedition of 15,000 men under Marquess James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton landed at the mouth of the river Peene and prepared to join the King&#x27;s army. On the Catholic side, Conti with 12,000 imperial soldiers was able to occupy strong fortresses at Gartz and Greifenhagen. Their proximity to Stettin caused great problems for the Swedes, both in holding both banks of the Oder and securing the Swedish lines of communication between Pomerania and Magdeburg.

On Christmas Day of 1630, Gustavus Adolplhus launched a surprise attack against both Greifenhagen and Gartz. The garrison in Greifenhagen was annihilated, while the garrison of Gartz retreated following a Swedish bombardment of the fortress. The fleeing troops led by Colonel Hannibal von Schauenberg made it to safety into Brandenburg. Despite his small losses of 500 men throughout the Swedish operation, Conti&#x27;s troops was forced to evacuate all of Pomerania. Meanwhile, Tilly and his army had arrived at Frankfurt an der Oder in mid-January 1631, having covered a march in 10 days. Gustavus Adolplhus marched downstream of the Oder and captured the town of Bärwalde on 13 January 1631, where he met with French diplomat Hercule de Charnacé. With him as his counterpart, the King signed the Treaty of Bärwalde on 23 January 1631. Under its terms, Gustavus Adolphus agreed to maintain an army of 36,000 troops, in return for an annual payment of 400,000 Reichsthalers, for a period of five years.

===Sieges of Frankfurt (Oder) and Magdeburg===

Gustavus Adolphus launched his second invasion against the Duchy of Mecklenburg in February 1631. On 19 March 1631 Tilly left Frankfurt an der Oder with his army and headed for the duchy&#x27;s border. Tilly ruthlessly captured and sacked the rebellious town of Neubrandenburg, while Gustavus Adolphus avoided two direct confrontations with Tilly&#x27;s army and instead captured the town of Demmin. The King then turned his attention to Frankfurt an der Oder, both to secure the river crossing over the Oder and to deter Tilly from threatening Magdeburg. On learning of the Swedes&#x27; plans, Tilly found himself in a dilemma whether to rescue Frankfurt or complete his siege of Magdeburg. On 13 April Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; army of 23,000 men arrived outside the walls around Frankfurt (Oder). Knowing of the Imperials&#x27; plunder of Neubrandenburg, the King intended to see that Frankfurt would have to pay in the same coin. On the same day, the Swedes launched a furious attack on the city. After a fierce battle, in which 800 Swedish soldiers fell, the city was captured, and 3,000 men from the city&#x27;s garrison were massacred together with a number of armed citizens. Following the news of the fall of Frankfurt, Tilly immediately returned to Magdeburg with 25,000 men.
Soon after their conquest of Frankfurt an der Oder, the Swedish troops were able to capture the town of Landsberg. The garrison in Kolberg also capitulated in March 1631, after five months of resistance against the Swedes. Gustavus Adolphus had thus taken control of the entire territory northeast of Frankfurt and was able to exert diplomatic pressure on the Protestant electors. In May 1631, he marched his troops against Potsdam and Berlin, held by his brother-in-law, Elector George William of Brandenburg, and succeeded in capturing the fortress of Spandau. These actions forced the Elector to enter into an alliance with Sweden. The alliance was ratified on 22 June 1631, when Brandenburg agreed to assist Sweden with monthly subsidies. Despite this threat to his northern border, John George of Saxony was still not persuaded or forced to enter into an alliance with Sweden. The Elector instead continued to maintain a policy of strict neutrality in relation to the campaigns that took place outside the borders of his Electorate. This policy hindered both the King&#x27;s and Tilly&#x27;s continued warfare.

Since the beginning of April 1631, Magdeburg was besieged by imperial troops. The city&#x27;s commandant Falkenberg was ordered by Gustavus Adolphus to hold the city for at least two months. Initially, Falkenberg had been able to take advantage of Tilly&#x27;s hesitation for his siege, by strengthening the city&#x27;s defenses and reorganizing his 2,500-strong garrison to be supported by 5,000 armed citizens. But after the fall of Frankfurt, Tilly returned to Magdeburg at the end of April. He systematically attacked the city&#x27;s outer defenses from several sides, which were gradually abandoned by the Swedish defenders. The Imperial troops dug trenches which, by mid-May, ran only five meters from the city&#x27;s walls. On 18 May Tilly issued a final ultimatum for surrender to the city, which was subsequently refused by the city&#x27;s council. On 19 May Tilly held a council of war with his generals where they decided to make a final assault on the city from six directions the following day. During the morning of 20 May, the city was bombarded by Tilly&#x27;s guns and Imperial troops broke into the city from several directions. The city was set on fire, Falkenberg and the entire city garrison were massacred, and the Imperial troops pillaged the city for several days while committing cruel acts of violence against the city&#x27;s 25,000 inhabitants. By the time Tilly ordered an end to the looting on 24 May, Magdeburg was turned into a smoldering ghost town, resulting in the deaths of around 20,000 inhabitants.

===Engagements along the Elbe===

The destruction of Magdeburg had dire consequences for both Tilly and Gustavus Adolphus. Tilly was unable to support his troops in the vicinity of the city, while the King&#x27;s failure to rescue the city in time damaged his reputation. Another consequence was that the loss of Magdeburg persuaded the King to abandon his previous cautious method of warfare and instead seek redress for the ruthless massacre of Magdeburg&#x27;s Protestant population. The Swedes turned the sack of Magdeburg to good use: broadsides and pamphlets distributed throughout Europe ensured that prince and pauper alike understood how the Emperor, or at least his troops, treated his Protestant subjects.

Tilly marched from Magdeburg to face the army of Gustavus Adolphus. Through fresh recruits and troops from Northern Italy, who had previously been engaged in the Mantuan War of Succession, Tilly&#x27;s field army was supported by three advancing armies totaling 30,000 men. Tilly decided to divide his field army into two parts: one army under Pappenheim was ordered to guard the vicinity of Magdeburg, while a second led by Tilly himself was to march towards Thuringia to meet Saxe-Weimar&#x27;s troops. Meanwhile, two Imperial and Catholic League armies under Generals Egon of Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg and Johann von Aldringen, who occupied the Duchy of Württemberg and the city of Ulm, marched from the south while a third army under General Otto Heinrich Fugger, Count of Kirchberg, occupied Hesse.

Gustavus Adolphus now prepared to prevent further imperial depredations by establishing a strong defensive line along the rivers Elbe, Havel and Spree. He also sent smaller detachments to Mecklenburg and Silesia. Pappenheim was by this time exasperated as a result of his stagnant station at Magdeburg. By early July, on his own initiative, he decided to launch a major offensive against Havelberg, Werben and Burg with his 13,000 men, starting from his bridgehead at Havel. The Swedes conducted an immediate counter-attack which in a week drove Pappenheim&#x27;s troops back to the other side of the Havel, while also capturing the strategically important bridgehead of Tangermünde. Gustavus Adolphus regrouped his army of 30,000 men in an attempt to challenge Tilly&#x27;s Imperial and Catholic League army, which at the time had not yet converged with their reinforcements coming from the south. In tandem, the King drew up a plan of defense centered around the town of Werben, which the Swedes had recently recaptured from Pappenheim&#x27;s troops. Meanwhile, Tilly had converged with Pappenheim&#x27;s army to attempt to challenge Gustavus Adolphus in open battle with their combined 20,000 troops. The King, in turn, had assembled 15,000 men at a heavily fortified camp in Werben.

Tilly advanced slowly towards Werben. On 27 July, some of his regiments stationed at Burgstall were chased away by Swedish cavalry units. Distressed by this setback, Tilly arrived with his army outside Werben on 5 August. He was aware that a frontal assault against the strong Swedish camp would end in a massacre of his troops. On the morning of 6 August, while a thick fog covered their surroundings, Tilly chose to use the fog as a smoke screen and ordered his troops to advance towards the camp&#x27;s weakest sections. When the fog suddenly dispersed during the march, Tilly&#x27;s troops were immediately exposed to Swedish artillery fire and were forced to retreat with heavy casualties. Tilly then arrayed his army in battle formation and stood idle for two days, but Gustavus Adolhpus refused to accept Tilly&#x27;s challenge. Since the latter did not want to risk a second assault against the strong Swedish position, the imperial troops retreated on 8 August. Both Tilly and the King spent the following weeks to reinforce their armies. By the arrival of Fürstenberg&#x27;s army at the end of August, Tilly had a total of 35,000 men at his disposal, while Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s army at the time was numerically inferior.

==Preliminaries==
The Saxon policy of neutrality continued to hinder Tilly&#x27;s army. The Electorate blocked the lines of communication between the Imperial and League armies that crossed the Swedish line of defense along the Elbe and Oder. John Georg I also wanted to strengthen his Electorate by issuing a decree for the recruitment of militia regiments, which was met with condemnation from Emperor Ferdinand. Tilly feared that the Elector of Saxony would ally himself with Gustavus Adolphus, who had already entered into an alliance with Brandenburg. In order to present John Georg I with an ultimatum regarding his recruitment, Tilly chose to invade the Electorate in June 1631. The Elector at this time wanted to buy time by engaging in negotiations with Tilly, to avoid a direct counter-offensive. But Tilly chose to quickly end the negotiations and instead begin a siege of Leipzig.

With the imminent threat of an imperial occupation of his Electorate, John Georg I decided on 30 August to enter into an alliance with Gustavus Adolphus. With their combined forces, their aim was now to engage with Tilly&#x27;s army and stop the siege of Leipzig. At the end of August, Bremen and William V of Hesse-Kassel also chose to join the Protestant alliance. Gustavus Adolphus and John Georg I united their armies on 15 September at the town of Düben. By this time Tilly&#x27;s army had already stormed and conquered Leipzig. At this point, only separated between the combatants. Tilly had no longer the opportunity to avoid a confrontation, and his forces found themselves at a numerical disadvantage as a result of the union between the two Protestant regents. A southern retreat would worsen his situation, as an entry into Bohemia could lead to a declaration of war from Wallenstein, who since the spring of 1631 had begun negotiations with Gustavus Adolphus. Tilly&#x27;s only hope was to consolidate his position at Leipzig and await for reinforcements. A Catholic League army of 17,000 men under General Aldringen was already advancing from the south. Meanwhile, the Protestant forces, consisting of 30,000 Swedes and 20,000 Saxons, had assembled at Düben.

By virtue of his numerical superiority, Gustavus Adolphus felt confident before his upcoming meeting with Tilly&#x27;s assembled army. He had up until this point deliberately avoided a direct confrontation with the Imperial Army. He ordered Field Marshal Horn to gather intelligence about his opponent at Leipzig. The King&#x27;s confidence was strengthened by the fact that the Swedish scouts had underestimated the strength of the imperial troops, although he viewed the combat readiness of the Elector&#x27;s allied Saxon army with great skepticism. Two days after the convergence at Düben, the Swedish army had lost 10 percent of its strength, which included deserters as well as sick and injured soldiers. Tilly&#x27;s scouts had overestimated their opponent&#x27;s combined strength. This made Tilly want to avoid a meeting engagement with such a strong enemy force and await reinforcements from Aldringen&#x27;s army instead.

As a means to stop Tilly&#x27;s delaying strategy, the impetuous Pappenheim wanted to spur Tilly to immediately advance and crush the Protestant army, which he himself regarded as a large &quot;mob army&quot;. Pappenheim pointed out that further delay in the arrival of Aldringen&#x27;s army would reduce their chance of finally dealing with the &quot;arrogant&quot; Swedish King, whose army they had consistently avoided for some months. Tilly replied that he had less respect for the Saxon troops. But during his previous campaign against the Swedes, he had learned to respect Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s military achievements and insisted that they should attack the King&#x27;s army only at a distinct advantage. Most of his general staff on the other hand, mainly by Fürstenberg and almost all the junior officers, propagated Pappenheim&#x27;s proposal for an immediate attack. Only a few senior officers agreed with Tilly that they should wait for reinforcements before the upcoming battle. To curtail the internal division in his general staff, Tilly wanted to occupy Pappenheim by sending him on a reconnaissance mission at the head of 2,000 Imperial horsemen. However, Pappenheim in turn wanted to use this mission to provoke his opponent into an open battle. He sent a false report to Tilly that parts of his troops had deserted to Gustavus Adolphus and lured him into a trap, and that his horsemen would perish unless the Imperial-League army came to his rescue. Although Tilly was already aware of Pappenheim&#x27;s intentions, he did not want to risk losing his Imperial horsemen, and thus decided to march to Pappenheim&#x27;s location with his entire army. Pappenheim&#x27;s vision became partially into reality, as his horsemen clashed with the Swedish vanguard led by Sir James Ramsay. Instead of retreating to Leipzig, he suggested to Tilly that the entire army should assemble at the village of Breitenfeld outside of Leipzig.

On 16 September the Swedish and Saxon troops spent the night in full battle formation at the village of Wölchau about northeast of Leipzig. In the evening, Gustavus Adolphus made plans before the upcoming battle with John Georg I and his own general staff. The staff agreed that the united army should draw Tilly into open battle. On the morning of 17 September Gustavus Adolphus ordered his troops to march south through hilly terrain. Only separated the King&#x27;s and Tilly&#x27;s armies. After a two-hour long march, the King&#x27;s troops arrived at the Lober stream, whose swampy banks they were forced to cross with great difficulty to reach the neighboring village of Podelwitz. Meanwhile, Tilly sent his Croatian and Hungarian cavalry units to disrupt the Swedes&#x27; passage through the swampy terrain. Their attack was repulsed when they were fired upon by Swedish musketeers. Tilly used this skirmish to order his army into full combat readiness at a pair of ridges close to Breitenfeld.

==Battlefield==
The battle took place on a gently sloping field about north of Leipzig. The field covered an area of about 20 km2, with crossroads stretched between the villages of Breitenfeld in the west, Seehausen in the east, Podelwitz in the north and Wiederitzsch in the south. The marshy Lober stream flowed behind Podelwitz, which ran from Schladitzer See west of the village. The Swedish army was drawn up in the open field just south of Podelwitz. The Saxon army was deployed on the Swedish army&#x27;s eastern flank, between the villages of Zschölkau ( northeast of Podelwitz) in the north and Göbschelwitz ( north of Seehausen) in the south. Between Breitenfeld and Seehausen ran the Galgenberg, a pair of gently sloping ridges where Tilly placed his artillery, while his army was lined up just behind the ridges. Behind his army, just northeast of Wiederitzsch, laid the deciduous Linkelwald forest. Tilly had his army camp between the villages of Eutritsch ( south of Wiederitzsch) in the east and Möckern ( south of Breitenfeld) in the west. A country road ran from Leipzig to the town of Düben in a north-easterly direction, through the eastern part of the Linkelwald and across the battlefield before crossing the Lober through Zschölkau. The battlefield is today bisected by the Bundesautobahn 14 and Bundesstraße 2 motorways, which have their exit to Leipzig-Mitte between Wiederitzsch and Seehausen.

==Deployment==
===Swedish army===

The Swedish army was positioned on the far right of the allied formation and was deployed on two offset line formations, with each line being supported by tactical reserves. According to calculations by Swedish military historian Julius Mankell, Gustavus Adolphus commanded a total of around 23,520 Swedish soldiers at the time of the battle. The army consisted of 8,572 musketeers, 3,440 pikemen, 464 dragoons, 7,700 reiters and 3,344 officers. According to Swedish historian Jan Gletes&#x27; studies, Gustavus Adolphus commanded over 22,806 Swedish soldiers at Breitenfeld, which consisted of 14,742 infantry divided between 26 infantry regiments, 7,600 horsemen divided between 17 cavalry regiments and a dragoon regiment of 464 men. Among the soldiers, 4,628 men originated from Sweden and Finland, while 18,178 men were mercenaries enlisted from the German states, the British Isles, and Livonia.

The Swedish right wing consisted of 5,000 men, with Gustavus Adolphus in command of the first line and General Johan Banér in command of the second. The wing were made up of ten cavalry regiments and Banér&#x27;s musketeer regiment&#x27;s 8 companies of 900 men, who were placed in the gaps between the cavalry squadrons.

The wing were made up of Colonel Berthold von Waldstein&#x27;s infantry regiment&#x27;s 8 companies with 1,000 men, who were placed in the gaps between the squadrons, as well as four cavalry regiments and a dragoon regiment. At the first line, Lieutenant General Wolf Heinrich von Baudissin&#x27;s Cuirassier Regiment had 12 companies with 600 men and Colonel Moritz Pensen von Caldenbach&#x27;s Cuirassier Regiment had 8 companies with 650 men. At the second line, there were 5 companies with 250 men of Colonel Nicholas de Courville&#x27;s Cuirassier Regiment, 12 companies with 800 men of Colonel Efferen-Hall&#x27;s Cuirassier Regiment and 4 companies with 450 men of Colonel Georg Christoph von Taupadel&#x27;s German Dragoon Squadron.

The Swedish centre consisted of 14,650 men, divided between seven infantry brigades and three cavalry regiments. The first line was commanded by Major General Maximilian Teuffel and the second by Colonel John Hepburn. Teuffel&#x27;s troops of 8,650 men in the first line consisted of four infantry brigades: the Yellow Brigade&#x27;s 12 companies of 1,700 men led by himself, which also included an infantry squadron of 4 companies under Colonel Niklas von Chemnitz; Colonel Åke Gustafsson Oxenstierna&#x27;s brigade of 1,400 men which included the Dalarna Regiment&#x27;s 7 companies led by himself, the 8 companies from the Skaraborg, Närke and Värmland regiments led by Colonel Axel Lillie, as well as the Savolax Infantry Regiment of 8 companies led by Colonel Claes Hastfer; Colonel Erik Hand&#x27;s brigade of 1,750 men which included the Östergötland Infantry Regiment&#x27;s 8 companies led by himself, Dal&#x27;s Infantry Squadron&#x27;s 4 companies led by colonel Wilhelm von Salzburg, as well as the Västgöta Regiment&#x27;s 8 companies led by Colonel Carl Hård af Segerstad; and the Blue Brigade&#x27;s 24 companies of 1,800 men led by General Hans Georg aus dem Winckel, which included 12 companies of Winckel&#x27;s &quot;blue&quot; infantry regiment and 12 companies of Colonel Geisbrecht von Hogendorf&#x27;s &quot;red&quot; infantry regiment.

Colonel Lennart Torstensson&#x27;s artillery park was positioned in front of Teuffel&#x27;s troops in the centre, which consisted of four 24-pounder guns, eight 18-pounder guns and 42 lighter regimental guns. Torstenson placed the heavier pieces in front of the middle of the Swedish centre. 24 regimental guns were placed in front of each brigade on the first line of the centre, while 18 regimental guns were in front of each brigade on the second line.

===Saxon army===
According to Jan Glete, the Saxon army consisted of 17,325 men, of which 12,100 were infantry divided between nine infantry regiments and 5,225 were reiters divided between twelve cavalry regiments. The army also brought 12 artillery pieces of unknown caliber. The army was lined up to the left of the Swedish army in traditional formation, as the Saxons had not had time to be trained in Swedish combat techniques. Elector John George was Commander-in-chief with Field Marshal Hans Georg von Arnim-Boitzenburg as his second-in-command.

Friedrich Wilhelm II, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg was in command of the Saxon centre. The centre consisted of nine infantry regiments: Field Marshal Arnim&#x27;s Militia Regiment with 2,200 men led by himself, Colonel Hans Kaspar von Klitzing&#x27;s Militia Regiment with 2,200 men, Colonel Hans von Löser&#x27;s Militia Regiment with 2,200 men, Colonel Moritz Dietrich von Starschedel&#x27;s Infantry Regiment with 2,200 men, Colonel Siegmund von Wolfersdorf&#x27;s Foot Regiment, Colonel Karl von Bose&#x27;s Foot Regiment, the Elector&#x27;s Infantry Regiment led by Colonel Johann Casimir von Schaumberg, Colonel Johann von der Pforte&#x27;s Foot Regiment, and Dam Vitzthum&#x27;s Foot Regiment.

===Imperial-Catholic League Army===
The Imperial-Catholic League army, under the command of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, was lined up along a long front line in an east–west direction. Among the troops, 14,700 were Imperial soldiers, 15,700 were Catholic League army soldiers, and 1,000 irregular soldiers. In total, the army consisted of 27 artillery pieces, 21,400 infantry divided between fourteen infantry regiments, and 10,000 reiters divided between eleven cuirassier regiments and six harquebusier regiments, including irregular cavalry units. The infantry consisted of 8,600 Imperial soldiers, who formed eight tercios with just over 1,000 men each, and 12,800 League soldiers who formed six more robust tercios of over 2,000 men each. The fourteen tercios were divided into four groups commanded by Tilly, General Matthias Gallas, Colonel Philipp von Pappenheim and Colonel Johan Göss. The majority of the soldiers originated from the German states, while other contingents came from Spain, Wallonia in Habsburg Netherlands and the constituent kingdoms of Italy, Croatia and Hungary.

The Imperial-League right wing consisted of 5,400 soldiers under the command of General Egon von Fürstenberg. The wing were made up of Colonel Johann von Wangler&#x27;s (German) Imperial Infantry Regiment with 1,200 men and five cavalry regiments: Altsächsisch&#x27;s (Protestant) Imperial Cuirassier Regiment with 300 men under Colonel Julius Henry, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, Baumgarten&#x27;s (Italian) League Cuirassier Regiment with 500 men under Colonel Wilhelm von Baumgarten, Cronberg&#x27;s League Cuirassier Regiment with 900 men under Colonel Adam Philip von Cronberg, Schönburg&#x27;s League Cuirassier Regiment with 900 men under General of the Artillery Schönburg and Wengersky&#x27;s (German) Imperial Harquebusier Regiment with 600 men under Colonel Albrecht Wengersky. The wing also included irregular Croats and Hungarian cavalry units of 1,000 men led by Colonel Johann Ludwig Hektor von Isolani.

The Imperial left wing consisted of 5,300 soldiers under the command of Field Marshal Gottfried Heinrich zu Pappenheim. The wing consisted of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp&#x27;s (German) Imperial Infantry Regiment with 1,500 under Colonel Adolf von Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, two harquebusier regiments and five cuirassier regiments: Bernstein&#x27;s (German) Imperial Cuirassier Regiment with 400 under Colonel Wilhelm von Bernstein, Merode&#x27;s (Spanish) Imperial Harquebusier Regiment with 500 under Colonel Jean de Merode, Saxe-Lauenburg (German) Imperial Cuirassier Regiment with 600 under Colonel Franz Albecht von Saxe-Lauenburg, Piccolomini&#x27;s (German) Imperial Harquebusier Regiment of 800 man under General Ottavio Piccolomini, Rangoni&#x27;s (German) Imperial Cuirassier Regiment with 500 men under Colonel Giulio Marchese Rangoni, Strozzi&#x27;s (Walloon) Imperial Cuirassier Regiment of 500 men under Colonel Giacomo Strozzi, and Trčka&#x27;s (German) Imperial Cuirassier Regiment with 500 men under Colonel Adam Erdmann Trčka von Lípa.

&quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Tilly was in command of the Imperial-League centre, which included 18,700 troops, with General of the Artillery Otto Friedrich von Schönburg auf Wesel as his second-in-command. The centre was made up of twelve infantry regiments: Baldiron-Dietrichstein&#x27;s (Spanish-Italian) Imperial Infantry Regiment with 1,100 under Colonel Antoni von Baldiron-Dietrichstein, Blankart&#x27;s (Westphalian) League Infantry Regiment with 2,000 under Colonel Otto Ludwig von Blankart, Chiesa&#x27;s (German-Italian) Imperial Infantry Regiment with 1,000 under Colonel Kaspar Francesco Chiesa, Comargo-Reinach&#x27;s League Infantry Regiment with 2,000 under Colonel Hans Ludwig von Grotta, Fürstenberg&#x27;s (German) Imperial Infantry Regiment with 1,100 under General Fürstenberg, Gallas&#x27; (German-Italian) Imperial Infantry Regiment with 900 under General Matthias Gallas, Geleen&#x27;s (Bavarian) League Infantry Regiment with 2,000 under Colonel Gottfried Huyn von Geleen, Göss (German) Imperial Infantry Regiment with 900 under Colonel Max von Liechtenstein, Pappenheim&#x27;s League Infantry Regiment with 2,400 under Colonel Philipp von Pappenheim, Savelli&#x27;s (German) Imperial Infantry Regiment with 900 men under Colonel Federico Savelli, Tilly&#x27;s League Infantry Regiment from Würzburg with 2,200 men under &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Tilly, and Wahl&#x27;s League Infantry Regiment with 2,200 men under Colonel Joachim Christian von Wahl.

Tilly placed his reserve of 2,000 men behind his centre, divided between five cavalry regiments under the command of Major General Dietrich Ottmar von Erwitte. The reserve consisted of Erwitte&#x27;s League Cuirassier Regiment with 600 men, Montecuccoli&#x27;s (German) Imperial Cuirassier Regiment with 300 men under Colonel Ernesto Montecuccoli, Caffarelli&#x27;s (Spanish) Imperial Harquebusier Regiment with 300 men under Colonel Francesco de Caffarelli, Colloredo&#x27;s (German) Imperial Harquebusier Regiment with 400 men under Colonel Giovanni Battista von Colloredo, and Coronini&#x27;s (German) Imperial Harquebusier Regiment with 400 men under Colonel Johann P. Coronini von Cronberg.

The Imperial artillery park under General of the Artillery Schönburg consisted of 27 artillery pieces, divided between eleven 32-pounder guns, four 16-pounder guns, one 12-pounder gun, three 8-pounder guns, two 3-pounder guns and six smaller guns. The heavier pieces were placed in front of the middle of the Imperial-League centre, opposite to the Swedish centre and left wing, while the lighter pieces were placed farther to the right of the centre, opposite to the Saxon army. Gallas&#x27;, Tilly&#x27;s, Göss&#x27;s, and Pappenheim&#x27;s tercios were lined up on the intervals between the artillery pieces.

==Battle==
The battle began at twelve o&#x27;clock with an exchange of artillery fire. Tilly&#x27;s artillery concentrated their fire against the Saxon troops and the Swedish centre and left wing. The Saxons and Swedes returned fire with their own guns. It took some time before Torstenson&#x27;s heavy artillery were brought into position to launch its own bombardment. The Swedes demonstrated firepower in a rate of fire of three to five volleys to one Imperial volley. Torstenson later changed direction to aim his guns more accurately against the enemy. Tilly&#x27;s tercios where easy targets for Torstenson&#x27;s guns, while the Swedish troops were much sparsely spread and stood &quot;as firm as a wall&quot;. During the approximately two-hour long cannonade, about 1,000 Swedish soldiers were killed, about the same number of Saxon soldiers and about 2,000 Imperial-League soldiers. Colonel von Baumgarten was among the first to die from a Saxon cannonball.

Both forces on the battlefield remained stationary throughout the cannonade and refused to advance against their adversary. Tilly did not want to abandon the Galgenberg, whose advantageous position Gustavus Adolphus feared to attack. Furthermore, the gunpowder smoke from the cannons and the advance of the troops accumulated large clouds of dust and smoke, which with strong south-westerly winds blew straight into the faces of the Swedish soldiers. To circumvent this and attempt to get the wind on their side, the King ordered his right wing to pivot to the left. This movement was observed by both Tilly and Pappenheim. The latter&#x27;s cavalry was struck hard by the heavy Swedish artillery fire. The impetuous Pappenheim wanted to immediately unleash his cavalry upon the Swedes, while the latter was busy regrouping their ranks.

===Pappenheim&#x27;s assault===

Without receiving any orders from Tilly, Pappenheim went on his own initiative with his cuirassiers and attacked the Swedish right wing at two o&#x27;clock. He executed a flanking maneuver to avoid the fire of the Swedish guns. His harquebusiers and the Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp regiment advanced behind his cuirassiers. Pappenheim&#x27;s aim was to employ caracole tactics to penetrate Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; front. Banér and the King had by this time fully deployed their troops into lines, and were fully prepared to defend themselves against Pappenheim&#x27;s assault. As soon as Pappenheim&#x27;s cuirassiers approached Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; front and discharged their pistols at them, the Swedish commanded musketeer platoons fired a concentrated volley at point-blank range. Short after, the Swedish cuirassiers fired their pistols at the approaching Imperial cuirassiers.

The surprisingly accurate Swedish fire disrupted the charge of the Imperial cuirassiers and forced them to withdraw. Pappenheim regrouped his cuirassiers for a renewed attack, with fire support from musketeers of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp regiment and Piccolomini&#x27;s and Merode&#x27;s harquebusiers. While the Swedish musketeers reloaded their muskets, the Swedish cavalry mounted swift counter-charges against Pappenheim&#x27;s scattered cuirassiers. The horsemen then fell back to their previous positions to avoid the fire from Pappenheim&#x27;s harquebusiers and musketeers, allowing the Swedish musketeers to fire a new volley at Pappenheim&#x27;s cavalry. This process was repeated each time Pappenheim made a new attempt to penetrate Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; lines.

Within an hour Pappenheim made three frontal caracole attacks, all of which were repulsed by the cooperation between the Swedish musketeers and horsemen. Despite this setback, his offensive power was still strong and he was able to quickly recoil and regroup his dispersed cuirassiers. As the firepower from the King&#x27;s front proved extremely taxing, he decided to extend his cavalry line leftward and go around the King&#x27;s front to envelop his right flank. By performing this evasive maneuver, he directed his attacks against the King&#x27;s right flank, as well as Banér&#x27;s troops in the second line. Gustavus Adolphus promptly responded to this threat by ordering his reserves and Banér&#x27;s units from the second line to reinforce his exposed flank, allowing him to gradually extend his own line rightward. First to deploy on the King&#x27;s right flank was the Rhinegrave&#x27;s cuirassiers, later followed by Aderkas&#x27; Livonians, Dönhoff&#x27;s Curonians and Kochtitzky&#x27;s Slavic and Pomeranian cavalry. Pappenheim made three flanking attacks against the Swedes. The regimental commanders Aderkas and Damitz fell during this action. Both Gustavus Adolphus and Banér encouraged their horsemen and musketeers to remain steadfast. With all his attacks repulsed, Pappenheim fell back with heavy casualties and left his remaining cuirassiers demoralized and exhausted. Meanwhile, the Yellow Brigade launched their own attack and were able to create a gap between Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp&#x27;s regiment and Piccolomini&#x27;s harquebusiers on Pappenheim&#x27;s right flank.

Following Pappenheim&#x27;s seventh repulse at about four o&#x27;clock in the evening, Gustavus Adolphus ordered Banér to rally the cavalry of Sperreuth, Stenbock, Soop, Tott, Stålhandske and Wunsch. Banér led them in a broad counter-charge against both Pappenheim&#x27;s cuirassiers and Piccolomini&#x27;s and Merode&#x27;s harquebusiers. His shock attack immediately threw Pappenheim&#x27;s exhausted cuirassiers back in disarray, with some units under Pappenheim falling back to the Imperial artillery positions at Galgenberg, while others accompanied Piccolomini in his retreat from the battlefield. The Livonian and Curonian cuirassiers pursued Piccolomini&#x27;s cuirassiers through Breitenfeld and Halle.

With Pappenheim&#x27;s cavalry taken out of action, only Colonel von Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp&#x27;s infantry regiment remained on this front. The regiment formed into a tercio to stand their ground against attacks from Stålhandske&#x27;s and Wunsch&#x27;s Hakkapeliitta. The Finnish horsemen met stubborn resistance, forcing Banér to bring in Ortenburg&#x27;s cuirassiers and the Yellow Brigade&#x27;s commanded musketeers at five o&#x27;clock, who pulverised the tercio with musketry fire and canister charges from their regimental artillery. Their combined firepower were able to finally bring down the tercio. Out of 1,500 men, only 300 men of the Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp regiment survived after the battle. Colonel von Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp was mortally wounded during this action and was escorted as a Swedish prisoner of war to Eilenburg for treatment. He succumbed to his wounds two days later.

===Tilly&#x27;s main assault and Saxon retreat===
Tilly&#x27;s infantry remained stationary on the Galgenberg while Pappenheim&#x27;s made his assault against the Swedish right wing. Half an hour after Pappenheim&#x27;s first charge, Fürstenberg&#x27;s and Isolani&#x27;s cavalry, on the Imperial-League right wing, made a direct assault of their own against the Saxon centre and left wing. They were spearheaded by Cronberg&#x27;s and Schönburg&#x27;s cuirassier regiments. Schönburg attacked the Saxon Horse Guards, which were quickly routed after a brief struggle. Saxe-Altenburg&#x27;s and General Bindauf&#x27;s regiments resolutely defended themselves against Baumgarten&#x27;s cavalry attack, with the latter soon being reinforced by Cronberg&#x27;s cavalry. General Bindauf and Colonel Starschedel were both shot to death, resulting in their regiments disintegrating and routing from the battlefield. Colonel Steinau was captured by the Imperial-League troops during the commotion, along with most of his regiment.

At three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, Tilly recognized an opportunity for a main assault with his Imperial-League infantry against both the Saxon army and the left flank of the Swedish centre. Tercios spearheaded by Philipp von Pappenheim&#x27;s and Göss&#x27;s regiments, supported by Wangler&#x27;s regiment and Erwitte&#x27;s reserve cavalry, marched down the Galgenberg and made an oblique advance to the right, concentrating on the Saxon troops. Meanwhile, Gallas&#x27; tercios advanced to put pressure on the Swedish centre, while Tilly&#x27;s tercios acted as a &quot;hinge&quot; between Gallas&#x27; and Göss&#x27;s tercios. The marching tercios were immediately exposed to Torstenson&#x27;s artillery fire, which tore huge holes among the tightly packed formations.

Owing to the pressure of Fürstenberg&#x27;s cavalry, coupled with the advance of Tilly&#x27;s infantry, the rest of the Saxon army started to panic. The greater part of the army routed from the battlefield at four o&#x27;clock. Even the Elector John George, who made desperate attempts to incite his troops to fight back, was dragged along in their flight towards Eilenburg. Some Saxon soldiers took the opportunity to plunder their own &quot;tross&quot;, as well as the nearby Swedish one, who during the rush was also dragged along in the flight. The Saxon artillery was captured by the Imperial cavalry, who used the pieces to bombard both the fleeing Saxon troops and the Swedish left wing. Parts of Fürstenberg&#x27;s and Isolani&#x27;s cavalry, whose men cried out &quot;Victoria&quot; in triumph, chased after the Saxons and plundered their abandoned &quot;tross&quot;. Almost the entire Saxon army fled the battlefield over the course of merely an hour. Only Colonel Taube&#x27;s Life Regiment and Arnim&#x27;s Life Guards remained, who later regrouped behind the Swedish left wing. In a short time, the united Protestant army lost a third of its strength, with the remnants now being numerically inferior to Tilly&#x27;s army.

===Regroupment===

Tilly&#x27;s plan was that his centre would launch a broad frontal assault on Horn&#x27;s open left flank, with fire support from the Imperial batteries on Galgenberg and the captured Saxon artillery. Both Fürstenberg and Isolani were to support Tilly&#x27;s infantry assault. They gave strict orders to their cavalry to break off their pursuit of the Saxon troops and to attack the open flank and rear of the Swedish centre. While his both cavalry wings made their assaults, Tilly planned to execute a pincer movement against Horn&#x27;s troops. If successful, he would outflank the Swedish army on their left flank and ultimately drive them back towards the marchlands at the Lober stream. Arriving at the former position of the Saxons, Tilly slowly pivoted his Imperial-League tercios to the left. The movement of such large amount of troops on the trodden earth stirred up huge clouds of dust. These clouds were spread out with the wind towards the Swedish left wing, thus obscuring the visibility among Tilly&#x27;s and Horn&#x27;s troops. The left-turn movement and the difficult visibility resulted in Pappenheim&#x27;s, Wahl&#x27;s, Wangler&#x27;s and Reinach-Comargo&#x27;s infantry regiments, comprising 7,800 men and about 1,000 soldiers from nearby regiments, being pushed too far to the right. Owing to the size of the tercios, the turning manoeuver became a very time-consuming process. Many soldiers were crowded together and placed too far back to fully participate in the fighting on the far left.

The agile Swedish troops now saw their opportunity. Horn observed the new situation occurring before his eyes and immediately reacted to Tilly&#x27;s attempt to outflank his troops. He took the initiative by ordering his left flank (Baudissin&#x27;s and Caldenbach&#x27;s cuirassiers) to pivot sharply to the left, allowing his rear line (Taupadel&#x27;s dragoons and Efferen-Hall&#x27;s and Courville&#x27;s cuirassiers) to advance and extend his front line on both flanks. Waldstein&#x27;s commanded musketeers were also lined up in the gaps between the squadrons.

Horn thus re-aligned his troops in a new defensive front at a 90-degree angle, which ran perpendicularly along the country road between Düben and Leipzig. The road was surrounded by deep ditches, which Horn used as a defensive obstacle. His hastily improvised maneuver was carried out in just 15 minutes, and he exploited the surrounding smoke and dust clouds to conceal his deployment. Before the maneuver could be completed, Fürstenberg made an attempt to charge Horn&#x27;s flank. But since his cavalry, having chased away the Saxon troops, had not yet regrouped his ranks effectively, he was unable to mount a concentrated attack. Thus his attack was quickly repulsed by a concentrated volley from Waldstein&#x27;s musketeers.

===Action at Horn&#x27;s front===
Horn was well aware that his thin lines alone could not hold their ground against the crushing force of the Imperial-League infantry, which now numbered some 20,000 men and reinforced by thousands of Fürstenberg&#x27;s cavalry. While Tilly slowly regrouped his tercios for his decisive infantry assault, he wanted to put pressure on Horn by sending Fürstenberg&#x27;s remaining cavalry, mainly Baumgarten&#x27;s and Cronberg&#x27;s cuirassier regiments, in several columns to attack the Swedish left wing from the flank and the rear. Horn responded to Tilly&#x27;s regroupment by having Baudissin&#x27;s and Caldenbach&#x27;s cuirassiers engage in delaying actions against the Imperial-League infantry, with fire support from Waldstein&#x27;s musketeers. His aim was to disrupt Tilly&#x27;s attack preparations in order to buy himself time to call for reinforcements. In some places, Horn&#x27;s rapid-firing regimental artillery was able to unleash a blast of close-range grapeshots and canister-charges against the slow-moving Imperial-League infantry. At the same time, Efferen-Hall&#x27;s and Courville&#x27;s cuirassiers managed to repulse Fürstenberg&#x27;s cavalry charge. Fürstenberg responded by using the captured Saxon artillery to bombard the Swedish cuirassiers, killing colonel Efferen-Hall and several of his men in the process. Tilly ordered Fürstenberg to renew his attacks on Horn&#x27;s front, while his infantry moved into fighting positions. When these began to march across the deep trenches, Colonel Caldenbach and his regiment decided to sally out against the Imperial-League infantry in a suicidal assault. Caldenbach and nearly all of his men were killed during this delaying action, however, their assault stalled the advance of several enemy infantry regiments. This gave Horn more time to organize his defense.

Horn reported his situation to Major General Teuffel, who in turn forwarded the report to Gustavus Adolphus while he was busy with his own defense against Pappenheim&#x27;s assaults. The King hastened to the centre where he received a direct report from Field Marshal Arnim that the Saxon army had retreated and the entire Imperial-League army had turned their attention towards Horn&#x27;s isolated troops. The King immediately ordered Teuffel to send auxiliaries to Horn&#x27;s aid. As Teuffel was about to carry out the King&#x27;s order, he was killed by a stray bullet fired from Tilly&#x27;s infantry regiment, who advanced to confront the stationary Blue Brigade. This forced Gustavus Adolphus to alone ride to Colonel Hepburn at the centre&#x27;s second line. He ordered him to march to Horn&#x27;s aid with all three brigades of the second line, along with the reserve units from the first and second lines. In columns, Hepburn&#x27;s, Eckstädt&#x27;s, and Thurn&#x27;s brigades and the reserve troops pivoted straight to the left and deployed themselves on Horn&#x27;s left front, bringing with them their 18 regimental guns. Furthermore, Efferen-Hall&#x27;s and Courville&#x27;s cuirassier regiments were reinforced with Schaffman&#x27;s and Kochtitzky&#x27;s cavalry companies. With their arrival at his position, Horn was able to dispose of around 10,000 soldiers, whereby his front line could no longer be outflanked by Tilly&#x27;s onslaught.

As the Swedish auxiliaries arrived at Horn&#x27;s front, Philipp von Pappenheim&#x27;s tercios advanced in columns to confront the Green Brigade. Although Pappenheim&#x27;s veteran regiments were three times the size of the Green Brigade, the latter had brought several regimental guns and had both the sun and the wind behind their backs. Isolani&#x27;s Croats employed the caracole to stall the Green Brigade, but they were repulsed by heavy musket volleys and canister shots from Hepburn&#x27;s regimental guns. When Pappenheim&#x27;s tercios was within range, Hepburn lined up his Scottish musketeers with their three front ranks kneeling and three rear ranks standing upright. In a short time they were able to fire concentrated platoon volleys, which together with the canister shots from their regimental guns inflicted mounting casualties on Pappenheim&#x27;s advancing columns. These in turn returned fire with their own muskets.
At the same time, Göss&#x27; tercios clashed with Eckstädt&#x27;s brigade and Erwitte&#x27;s reserve cavalry advanced against Horn&#x27;s cavalry. Horn&#x27;s cavalry acted as a &quot;hinge&quot; between Eckstädt&#x27;s brigade and the Blue Brigade in the centre. As Göss&#x27;s and Pappenheim&#x27;s tercios approuched their opponents, the pikemen of both sides clashed against each other, both supported by Baudissin&#x27;s and Cronberg&#x27;s cavalry who swept across the open terrain. The musketeers also took part in the fierce melee, using the butt end of their muskets as clubs. Erwitte&#x27;s arquebusier regiments also attacked Horn&#x27;s cavalry with the use of caracole and artillery support. Horn responded to Erwitte&#x27;s attack with infantry musketry and cavalry countercharges.

The fierce fighting along Horn&#x27;s front accumulated thick clouds of gunpowder smoke and dust, which with strong westerly winds spread across the entire battlefield. These greatly obscured both the commander&#x27;s ability to survey the battle and the soldiers&#x27; ability to recognize their own comrades. At five o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, the action at Horn&#x27;s front had been going on for an hour. Hepburn signaled his musicians to play Scottish marching music to prevent his Scottish troops from getting lost in the smoke. The repeated and concentrated volleys from Horn&#x27;s and Hepburn&#x27;s musketeers, coupled with the heavy cannonade from their regimental artillery, forced the remnants of the Imperial-League infantry to stall their attacks, leading to the men being crowded together and losing their momentum. Despite the heavy resistance, Tilly refused to withdraw and his infantry continued to put up heavy pressure on Horn&#x27;s troops. But his positions had very limited room to manoeuvre and were slowly being pushed back by strong counterattacks made by Horn&#x27;s and Hepburn&#x27;s troops.

===Annihilation of the Imperial-League force===

At five o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, the battle had been going on for five hours. Following Banér&#x27;s successful cavalry charge against Pappenheim&#x27;s cavalry, Gustavus Adolphus noticed a gap had opened up between the Imperial-League centre and the fleeing left wing. He now recognized an opportunity to launch a major counteroffensive to break through Tilly&#x27;s army. After he had sent auxiliaries to Horn&#x27;s front, the King rode over to Banér on the right wing to rally his remaining cavalry. He ordered Soop and his Västergötland cavalry to charge against Erwitte&#x27;s open left flank. Along with Horn&#x27;s cavalry, Soop&#x27;s regiment were able to drive Erwitte&#x27;s cavalry back into Tilly&#x27;s infantry, causing disorder among the tightly packed tercios.

Meanwhile, the King rode at the head of the Hakkapeliitta and Stenbock&#x27;s, Sperreuth&#x27;s and Rheingrave&#x27;s cavalry. He led them into a flanking charge against the Imperial artillery. Small remnants of Pappenheim&#x27;s cuirassiers, who had retreated to the Galgenberg, were chased off by the King&#x27;s cavalry. The Swedes rode up the slopes, cut down the imperial artillerymen and seized their guns. They then rode down the slopes to join up with Soop&#x27;s cavalry and roll up the remnants of the Imperial-League centre from its left flank.
To complete his counter-offensive, Gustavus Adolphus ordered the rest of his right wing and the brigades on the first line of the centre to pivot perpendicularly to the left. This manoeuvre allowed the brigades to occupy the Galgenberg, push back Tilly&#x27;s Imperial-League infantry, and cut off their line of retreat towards Leipzig. At the same time, Torstenson moved his light artillery forward and Mackay&#x27;s and Monro&#x27;s regiments were able to recapture the Saxon artillery. Together with the captured Imperial artillery, the tightly packed Imperial-League infantry were now exposed to a heavy artillery crossfire.

Between six and seven o&#x27;clock, Horn made his last cavalry charge against the enemy. Hepburn&#x27;s brigade led an infantry attack, and the King sent the Blue Brigade to support him. These two-fold attacks, coupled with the destructive crossfire from the Swedish artillery, finally led to the collapse of Tilly&#x27;s army. The Imperial-League tercios suffered heavy losses and lost all cohesion. The remnants of Tilly&#x27;s army was thus forced into a disorderly retreat. The regimental commanders Erwitte, Caffarelli and Philipp Pappenheim where killed during this action, while Coronini became a Swedish prisoner of war. Thus both Erwitte&#x27;s reserve cavalry and Philipp Pappenheim&#x27;s regiment fell apart and fled in panic from the battlefield.

At this point, Tilly had been wounded in the chest and neck by three musket bullets, and received two blows to the head by a German officer, belonging to the Rheingrave&#x27;s regiment, who attempted to capture him. Tilly was saved when the German officer was shot down by Imperial Colonel Rudolf Maximilian von Sachsen-Lauenburg. Cronberg&#x27;s and Schönburg&#x27;s cuirassiers escorted Tilly to safety in Halle. Meanwhile, Field Marshal Pappenheim managed to return to the fray and tried to gather every remaining cuirassier he could find. But by this time, most of the Imperial cavalry had fled the battlefield. With limited room for maneuver, Pappenheim undertook the task of protecting Tilly&#x27;s retreat. Scattered Imperial-League troops fled towards Leipzig, Merseburg and Halle. Both the King&#x27;s and Horn&#x27;s cavalry launched a determined pursuit, cutting down or capturing any Imperial-League soldiers who failed to escape the battlefield. Large parts of the Swedish army, however, were too exhausted to partake in the pursuit. Tilly&#x27;s army was thus spared from total annihilation.

At six o&#x27;clock in the evening, Pappenheim formed tercios at the brow of the Linkelwald forest with the last cohesive remnants of Baldiron-Dietrichstein&#x27;s, Göss&#x27;s, Chiesa&#x27;s and Blankart&#x27;s regiments. The tercios put up dogged resistance against Tott&#x27;s and Stenbock&#x27;s attacking cavalry. Their resistance also gave respite to the remaining Imperial-League troops scattered around the battlefield to escape with their lives. The tercios were subjected to artillery fire from their own artillery pieces, which had now been turned against them by Gustavus Adolphus and Horn&#x27;s cavalry. By sundown, the 4,100 men of the four Imperial regiments from the start of the battle had now been reduced to a mere 600 men. The fighting finally subsided during nightfall at nine o&#x27;clock in the evening. Under the cover of darkness, Pappenheim was able to retreat from the battlefield along with the last Imperial-League soldiers. The flight proceeded in good order through the Linkelwald and in the direction of Halle. The exhausted Swedish infantry spent the night on the battlefield, while the Swedish cavalry and Taube&#x27;s Saxon cuirassiers continued their pursuit along the roads towards Leipzig and Halle.
==Casualties==
===Imperial-Catholic League Army===
The Imperial-League losses were devastating, with between 7,000 and 8,000 men killed, or around 7,600 men according to some sources, and around 6,000 men captured. Tilly had lost two-thirds of his army in the course of just a few days.

In the following day after the battle, 3,000 fleeing Imperial soldiers surrendered to their Saxon pursuers, who hunted them all the way to Leipzig. The Imperial-League prisoners of war from the battle were soon recruited into the Swedish ranks, as replacements for the Swedes&#x27; own losses. Up to 5,000 fleeing Imperial-League soldiers either deserted or were killed by vengeful Saxon peasants in the days following the battle. Among the dead were General of the Artillery Schönburg, General Erwitte and colonels Baumgarten, Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, Caffarelli, and Philipp Pappenheim. Furthermore, colonels Blankart, Coronini, Montecuccoli, and Wangler were captured along with a number of lieutenant colonels, &quot;rittmeisters&quot; and captains. Field Marshals Tilly and Pappenheim and General Fürstenberg were wounded during the battle.

Tilly also lost his entire artillery park, his war chest, and 120 banners and standards. The latter were transported as spoils of war to the Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm for public viewing.

===Swedish-Saxon army===
Swedish losses amounted to 3,550 men, divided between 2,100 infantry and 1,450 cavalry. Among the dead were Major General Teuffel, colonels Efferen-Hall, Caldenbach and Damitz and Lieutenant Colonel Aderkas. Colonel Courville became an Imperial prisoner of war.

The Saxons lost between 2,000 and 3,000 men. Most were killed during the artillery barrage at the start of the battle or while they were fleeing from the Imperial cavalry. Among the dead were General Bindauf and Colonel Starschedel.

==Aftermath==

The Catholics had suffered their first major defeat in the war, which had now been going on for 13 years. Mercenary Peter Hagendorf commented on the defeat:

Shortly after the battle, the remnants of Tilly&#x27;s Imperial-League army were forced to retreat south, divided into two parts. Tilly led his troops towards Nördlingen in the Upper Palatinate, while Pappenheim marched with his troops towards the Weser to ambush Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s reserve forces.

The Swedish victory at Breitenfeld sent shockwaves around Europe, since the German Protestant states won their first and greatest victory since the outbreak of the war. Breitenfeld came to symbolize the Lutherans&#x27; revenge for the Magdeburg massacre months before. The victory allowed Gustavus Adolphus to choose direction of his march. On 15 September a council of war was held in Halle to decide on the continued war plans. One option was to go directly towards Vienna and try to bring about a quick end to the war. The parties decided that John Georg I&#x27;s Saxon troops would march towards the Austrian Hereditary Lands and Vienna, while the Swedes moved south-west towards the Rhine River to engage the remaining Imperial troops. This decision has been discussed and questioned ever since, but it is impossible to know whether a march towards Vienna could have brought about favorable peace terms for the Protestants already in 1632.

Shortly after the council of war in Halle, Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s army first marched to the southwest, encountering only sporadic resistance from scattered imperial troops. On 22 September 1631, he captured the city of Erfurt, followed by Würzburg on 5 October, although the nearby Marienberg Fortress continued to resist. After a determined assault, Marienberg was captured by the Swedes on 8 October. On 19 November, Gustavus Adolphus broke camp with 13,000 men, leaving 7,000 men as an occupying force in Würzburg. The king marched down the river Main and captured several towns and fortresses along the way, the garrisons of which went over to the Swedish army in large numbers. Already on 17 November the city of Frankfurt am Main was taken without a fight. The King&#x27;s army then continued down the Main, reached its outlet in the Rhine, crossed the great river, and captured the Electoral residence of Mainz on 11 December 1631, where they established their winter quarters.

The totality of the victory confirmed Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s military innovations and guaranteed that the Swedes would remain engaged in the war for the foreseeable future. In the long term, the significant loss of forces and the creation of a strong Protestant anti-Imperial force required the Emperor and the Protestant and Catholic princes to rethink on the operational conduct of the war, and the diplomatic avenues they would pursue with it. Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s success encouraged several other princes to join the cause of the Swedish king and his few allies. By the month&#x27;s end, Hanover, the Hessian dukes, Brandenburg and Saxony were officially aligned against the empire, and France had agreed to provide substantially greater funding for Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; armies. Although Gustavus Adolphus was killed a year later at the battle of Lützen, the military strength of the alliance had been secured through the addition of new armies. Even when Swedish leadership faltered it did not fail, and the influx of French gold ensured that the hostilities could continue.

==Analysis==

Europe&#x27;s armies at the beginning of the 17th century primarily used two kinds of military doctrines: the Spanish-German doctrine and the Dutch doctrine. The Spanish-German doctrine, adopted by Johann Tserclaes Tilly at Breitenfeld, was characterized by robust pike and shot tactical formations. These consisted mainly of pikemen and some musketeers and were formed into large squares known as &quot;tercios&quot;. Tercios were heavy on the offensive, but difficult to maneuver on the battlefield. The Dutch battleline was more distinctly linear than the Spanish-German equivalent and was characterized by battalions. These were significantly smaller combat units with both pikemen and musketeers, making them easier to maneuver than the tercios. But since these lacked the crushing weight of the tercios in a frontal assault, firepower played a greater role among the Dutch battalions. Cavalry and artillery were of comparatively minor importance in both systems of combat methodology.

Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s Swedish combat methodology was a further development of the Dutch combat methodology and was based on his experiences during the Polish–Swedish War. The smallest combat unit of the King&#x27;s infantry was the battalion (then called the squadron). Before battle, three to four battalions were combined into a larger combat unit, the brigade. The brigade was powerful enough to both defend against or successfully attack a tercio. Unlike the tercio, the brigade, thanks to its composition of battalions, could maneuver itself much faster and more smoothly on the battlefield. The battleline within Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s army was usually divided into two lines, with the brigades formed into line formation side by side in the centre and the cavalry in line formation on both wings. Within each battalion, the pikemen stood in the centre and the musketeers on the wings. A number of musketeer divisions were grouped together with the cavalry.

The firepower was of vital importance in the army of Gustavus Adolphus. Proportionally, the Swedish musketeers in his battalion were fewer than those in the tercio or the Dutch battalion, but they were used highly effectively. Gustavus Adolphus instructed his musketeers to fire volleys instead of successive fire. He had also developed a new technique of musket fire; the musketeers took up firing positions in three ranks: with the first rank while kneeling, the second rank while crouching and the third rank in a standing position. A concentrated Swedish volley had a devastating effect and opened the way for a fierce attack from the Swedish pikemen. The ratio of muskets to pikes was 13 to 8. Thus compared to the Dutch formation, Gustavus Adolphus had increased the number of pikes. The Swedish battleline was also more flexible, as the battalions were only six ranks deep. This made it possible for the Swedish units to quickly react to the enemy&#x27;s movements. More important, the linear formation allowed most Swedish musketeers to fire at the same time, and allowed the Swedish infantry to match the Imperialist frontage with a smaller number of men.

In addition to the musketeers&#x27; volley fire and agility during battle, Gustavus Adolphus also used regimental guns that accompanied the troops during their advance and provided devastating firepower at close range. He had moved away from heavy siege artillery into more mobile field pieces, which because of their mobility and rate of fire were much more effective than the former per pound. In addition, the Swedish cavalry before their clash with the enemy cavalry received effective fire support from the nearby musketeer divisions. The cavalry had also learned, after firing their pistols, to charge with their sabres at hand at full gallop. The great firepower of Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s musketeers and artillery, combined with the flexibility of its order of battle (the brigades), made the Swedish army very effective in defensive battles. But the core of his battle methodology, which greatly contributed to the victory at Breitenfeld, was the combined arms of both musketeers and regimental artillery, whose systematic firepower enabled a victorious breakthrough in close combat. This methodology would later be adopted among other armies in Europe and was an important contribution to the development of early modern warfare.

The casualties suffered by the Imperial-League army at Breitenfeld spoke for a change of the Spanish-German doctrine. When Wallenstein regained his role as commander-in-chief of the army, he engaged Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s army at the battle of Lützen in 1632, where he deployed his imperial infantry into battalions of three lines. His battalions were influenced by the Dutch doctrine and he also used Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s model of uniting battalions into brigades. The Swedish brigade was also forced to reform as a result of the Swedish defeat at the battle of Nördlingen in 1634.

<doc id="602873" wikidata="Q1158122" url="?curid=602873" title="No. 617 Squadron RAF">
<text>Number 617 Squadron is a Royal Air Force aircraft squadron commonly known as The Dambusters for its actions during Operation Chastise against German dams during the Second World War, originally based at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire and currently based at RAF Marham in Norfolk. In the early 21st century it operated the Panavia Tornado GR4 in the ground attack and reconnaissance role until being disbanded on 28 March 2014. The Dambusters reformed on 18 April 2018, and was equipped at RAF Marham in June 2018 with the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning, becoming the first squadron to be based in the UK with this advanced STOVL type. The unit is composed of both RAF and Royal Navy personnel, and operates from the Royal Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers.

==History==
===Between the wars===
According to the squadron&#x27;s entry in &quot;Flying Units of the RAF&quot; by Alan Lake, No. 617 Squadron was allocated the unit identification code MZ for the period April to September 1939, even though the unit did not actually exist at the time.

===Second World War===
The squadron was formed on 21 March 1943 at RAF Scampton on Avro Lancaster heavy bombers.

It was formed under great secrecy for the specific task of attacking three major dams that contributed water and power to the Ruhr industrial region in Nazi Germany: the Möhne, Eder, and Sorpe. The plan was given the codename Operation Chastise and carried out on 17 May 1943. The squadron had to develop the tactics to deploy Barnes Wallis&#x27;s &quot;Bouncing bomb&quot;, and undertook some of its training over the dams of the Upper Derwent Valley in Derbyshire, as the towers on the dam walls were similar to those to be found on some of the target dams in Germany.

The squadron&#x27;s badge, approved by King George VI, depicts the bursting of a dam in commemoration of &quot;Chastise&quot;. The squadron&#x27;s chosen motto was , a humorous double entendre on a famous saying of Madame de Pompadour to King Louis XV, made on the loss at the Battle of Rossbach by the French. The original commander of No. 617 Squadron, Wing Commander Guy Gibson, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in the raid.
After the raid, Gibson was withdrawn from flying (due to the high number of raids he had been on) and went on a publicity tour. Wing Commander George Holden became commanding officer (CO) in July, but he was shot down and killed on his fourth mission, Operation Garlic in September 1943, in an attack on the Dortmund-Ems Canal; he had four of Gibson&#x27;s crew with him. H. B. &quot;Mick&quot; Martin took command temporarily, before Leonard Cheshire took over as CO. Cheshire developed and personally took part in the special target marking techniques required, which went far beyond the precision delivered by the standard Pathfinder units – by the end he was marking the targets from a Mustang fighter. He was also awarded the VC.

On 15 July 1943, 12 aircraft of the squadron took off from Scampton to attack targets in Northern Italy. All aircraft attacked and proceeded to North Africa without loss. The targets were San Polo d&#x27;Enza and Arquata Scrivia power stations; it was hoped that the attacks would delay German troops who were travelling down into Italy on the electrified railway system to support the Italian front. The operation met little opposition but the targets were obscured by valley haze and were not destroyed. The 12 crews returned to Scampton on 25 July from North Africa after bombing Leghorn docks on the return journey. The raid on Leghorn Docks was not a great success, due to mist shrouding the target. On 29 July 1943 nine aircraft took off from Scampton to drop leaflets on Milan, Bologna, Genoa and Turin in Italy. All aircraft completed the mission and landed safely in Blida, North Africa.

The UK Government considered using No. 617 Squadron to target the Italian leader Mussolini in July or August 1943. The British believed if Mussolini was killed it might take Italy out of the war. It would have been a flight carried out at extremely low level with the targets of Mussolini&#x27;s headquarters and residence in Rome. Neither of these targets were within 1,500 yards of the Vatican, which the Allies had promised not to damage. However within two weeks of the plan being suggested, Mussolini was ousted by his opponents and replaced by Pietro Badoglio, leading to an armistice with the Allies in September.

Throughout the rest of the war, the squadron continued in a specialist and precision-bombing role, including the use of the enormous &quot;Tallboy&quot; and &quot;Grand Slam&quot; ground-penetrating earthquake bombs, on targets such as concrete U-boat shelters and bridges. Several failed attempts were made on The Dortmund-Ems Canal in 1943 (Operation Garlic); it was finally breached with Tallboys in September 1944.

In March 1945 the squadron used the Grand Slam bomb for the first time, against the Bielefeld viaduct, wrecking it. The viaduct had withstood 54 previous attacks without being permanently neutralized.

The Squadron&#x27;s skills in precision flying were also utilized in the Normandy invasion, as part of a massive effort to deceive the Germans as to the actual location of the Allied invasion. Beginning on the night before the D-day landings, the Squadron dropped thin strips of aluminum foil (called Window) over the waters off Cap d&#x27;Antifer, about from the actual D-Day landings. The strips were dropped in vast numbers, in carefully choreographed patterns, over many hours, to create on German radar an illusion of a huge approaching naval fleet, even though the ships were non-existent. The Squadron practiced the technique at Tantallon Castle in Scotland, using captured German Würzburg, Freya, and Seetakt radars.
A particularly notable series of attacks caused the disabling and sinking of &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, a major German battleship that had been moved into a fjord in northern Norway where she threatened the Arctic convoys and was too far north to be attacked by air from the UK. She had already been damaged by an attack by Royal Navy midget submarines and a series of attacks from carrier-borne aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm, but both attacks had failed to sink her. The task was given to No. IX and No. 617 Squadrons; they were deployed to Yagodnik, near Archangel a staging base in Russia to attack &quot;Tirpitz&quot; with Tallboy bombs. On 15 September 1944, the RAF bombers struck the battleship in the forecastle, which rendered her unseaworthy, so she was sent to the Tromsø fjord where temporary repairs were made so she was anchored as a floating battery. This fjord was in range of bombers operating from Scotland and from there, in October, she was attacked again, but cloud cover thwarted the attack. Finally on 12 November 1944, the two squadrons attacked &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. The first bombs missed their target, but following aircraft scored two direct hits in quick succession. Within ten minutes of the first bomb hitting the &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, she suffered a magazine explosion at her &quot;C&quot; turret and killing 1,000 of her 1,700 crew. All three RAF attacks on &quot;Tirpitz&quot; were led by Wing Commander J. B. &quot;Willy&quot; Tait, who had succeeded Cheshire as CO of No. 617 Squadron in July 1944. Among pilots participating in the raids was Flight Lieutenant John Leavitt, an American who piloted one of the 31 Lancasters. Leavitt&#x27;s aircraft dropped one of the bombs that hit &quot;Tirpitz&quot; dead centre. Despite both squadrons claiming that it was their bombs that actually sank the Tirpitz, it was the Tallboy bomb, dropped from a No. IX Squadron Lancaster WS-Y (&quot;LM220&quot;) piloted by Flying Officer Dougie Tweddle that is attributed to the sinking of the warship. F/O Tweddle was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his part in the operations against &quot;Tirpitz&quot;.

During the Second World War the Squadron carried out 1,599 operational sorties with the loss of 32 aircraft.

===Cold War (1946–1981)===
After the end of the Second World War, the squadron replaced its Lancasters with Avro Lincolns, following those in 1952 with the English Electric Canberra jet bomber. The squadron was deployed to Malaya for four months in 1955, returning to RAF Binbrook to be disbanded on 15 December 1955.

Reformed at RAF Scampton on 1 May 1958 as part of RAF Bomber Command&#x27;s V-bomber force maintaining the UK&#x27;s strategic nuclear deterrent, the squadron was equipped with the Avro Vulcan B1 from Aug 1960. By 23 May 1961, its aircraft were the upgraded Vulcan B1A fitted with the electronic countermeasures tail pod. The squadron&#x27;s assigned role was high-level strategic bombing with a variety of free fall nuclear bombs. Both the B1 and B1A types were equipped with various free-fall nuclear weapons. These may have included Blue Danube, Red Beard, Violet Club the Interim Megaton Weapon, Yellow Sun Mk.1 and certainly Yellow Sun Mk2. American bombs were also supplied to the RAF V-bombers for a short period under the Project E arrangements.

The squadron began almost immediately to upgrade yet again to the Vulcan B2, taking delivery of the first on 1 September 1961, although its high-level strategic bombing role remained unchanged until the advent of effective Soviet Surface-to-Air Missiles forced Bomber Command to reassign V-bombers from high-altitude operations to low-level penetration operations in March 1963, when the squadron&#x27;s Vulcans adopted a mission profile that included a &#x27;pop-up&#x27; manoeuvre from to above for safe release of Blue Steel.

Vulcans were configured for the Blue Steel stand-off bomb and 617 Squadron was the first to be declared operational with it in August 1962, until in January 1970 the squadron&#x27;s eight Vulcan B2 aircraft were re-equipped with the new strategic laydown bomb, WE.177B which improved aircraft survivability by enabling aircraft to remain at low-level during weapon release.

Following the transfer of responsibility for the nuclear deterrent to the Royal Navy, the squadron was reassigned to SACEUR for tactical strike missions. In a high-intensity European war the squadron&#x27;s role was to support land forces on the Continent by striking deep into enemy-held areas beyond the forward edge of the battlefield, striking at enemy concentrations and infrastructure, with WE.177 tactical nuclear weapons, should a conflict escalate to that stage. The squadron&#x27;s eight aircraft were allocated eight WE.177 nuclear bombs. As the Vulcan&#x27;s bomb bay was configured to carry only one, and assuming that RAF staff planners had factored in their usual allowance for attrition in the early conventional phase of a continental war, leaving sufficient surviving aircraft to deliver the full stockpile of nuclear weapons, it is a reasonable conclusion that the Vulcan force was held in reserve for nuclear strike duties only. The squadron&#x27;s Vulcan B2s served mainly in that low-level penetration role until disbandment on 31 December 1981.

===Tornado GR (1983–2014)===

The squadron reformed on 1 January 1983 at RAF Marham, re-equipped with twelve Panavia Tornado GR1.

No. 617 Squadron was deployed to King Faisal Air Base, Saudi Arabia following the 1990 Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait, it returned to the UK in Nov 90&#x27; replaced by 16/20 Sqn, some of its aircrews did return, operating with various other squadrons throughout KSA.

In 1993, No. 617 Squadron began the changeover to anti-shipping and by May 1994 was operating from RAF Lossiemouth assigned to SACLANT, flying the Tornado GR1B with the Sea Eagle missile. In December 1994, Flight Lieutenant Jo Salter became the first female combat ready fast jet pilot.

In 1995, crews from No. 617 Squadron deployed in support of Operation Warden.

In 2003, the Squadron sent several airframes to the Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait and Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, as part of Operation Telic joining airframes from II Squadron, IX Squadron, XIII Squadron, 31 Squadron and 12 Squadron (a total of 30 Tornado GR4/GR4A&#x27;s were deployed) where they were the first squadron to use the new MBDA Storm Shadow.

In July 2009, &quot;the Dambusters&quot; deployed to Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, as part of Operation Herrick in order to provide support for No. 12 (Bomber) Squadron. No. 617 Squadron underwent their first full Op HERRICK deployment between April and July 2011, handing over responsibility to No. 31 Squadron on 15 July. While deployed, &quot;the Dambusters&quot; were the RAF squadron who helped the Tornado GR fleet surpass 1,000,000 flying hours in June 2011.

In July 2011, the squadron took part in Operation Ellamy

In July 2013, it was announced that No. 617 Squadron would become the first operational RAF unit to receive the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning. No. 617 Squadron disbanded on 28 March 2014 as part of the draw-down of the Tornado force.

===F-35B Lightning (2017–present)===
Beginning in 2016, &quot;the Dambusters&quot; started their training for conversion to the F-35B ahead of reforming as the first British front line squadron with the Lightning. The squadron worked up at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina, throughout late 2017 and early 2018 before reforming on 18 April 2018.

On 6 June 2018, a quartet of No. 617 Squadron Lightnings (&quot;ZM145&quot;, &quot;ZM146&quot;, &quot;ZM147&quot; and &quot;ZM148&quot;), supported by three Airbus Voyagers and an Airbus Atlas C1, made an eight-hour flight across the Atlantic to become the first of the UK&#x27;s aircraft to be based permanently at RAF Marham. On 10 July, the squadron participated in the RAF100 flypast over London with three F-35Bs. On 3 August, five more F-35Bs arrived at RAF Marham for &quot;the Dambusters&quot;. No. 617 Squadron was declared &#x27;combat ready&#x27; on 10 January 2019.

&quot;The Dambusters&quot; underwent their first F-35 deployment on 22 May 2019 when six Lightnings deployed to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, for six weeks as part of &#x27;Exercise Lightning Dawn&#x27;. On 16 June, No. 617 Squadron carried out the first RAF F-35 operational mission when two Lightnings conducted a patrol over Syria as part of Operation Shader. On 25 June, No. 617 Squadron&#x27;s F-35Bs participated in &#x27;Exercise Tri Lightning&#x27; alongside United States Air Force F-35As of the 4th Fighter Squadron and Israeli Air Force F-35Is of 140 Squadron over the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Four F-35B Lightnings returned home to RAF Marham on 2 July, while the other two arrived at Amendola Air Base to carry out bilateral training with the Italian Air Force, including the local F-35As of 32º Stormo. Three Lightnings departed RAF Marham on 9 October to MCAS Beaufort in preparation for Westlant 19, with them embarking upon HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; for the first time alongside No. 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron on 13 October.

On 22 January 2020, &quot;the Dambusters&quot; departed Marham for Exercise Red Flag at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, their first with the Lightning. Between September and November 2020, &quot;the Dambusters&quot; hosted United States Marine Corps F-35Bs from VMFA-211 who deployed to RAF Marham to work up on HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; ahead of the carrier&#x27;s deployment in 2021.

In May 2021, No. 617 Squadron embarked eight F-35B Lightnings on board HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; as part of Carrier Strike Group 2021 (CSG21), operating alongside VMFA-211 as the fixed wing component. On 16 November 2021, one of the squadron&#x27;s F-35B fighters crashed during operations in the Mediterranean. The pilot was able to eject safely.

==In popular culture==
The Second World War exploits of the squadron and &quot;Chastise&quot; in particular, were described in Guy Gibson&#x27;s own 1944 account &quot;Enemy Coast Ahead&quot;, as well as Paul Brickhill&#x27;s 1951 book &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; and a 1955 film, though the accuracy and completeness of these accounts were compromised by many of the documents relating to the war years still being secured by the Official Secrets Act. The definitive work however is considered &quot;The Dambusters Raid&quot; by John Sweetman.

In 2006, it was announced that New Zealand film director Peter Jackson and David Frost would co-produce a re-make of the film. It was scripted by Stephen Fry, and intended to be directed by Christian Rivers. The last living Dam Buster pilot at the time, New Zealander Les Munro (1919–2015), offered his services as a technical adviser.

<doc id="602874" wikidata="Q4584413" url="?curid=602874" title="1988 Democratic National Convention">
<text>The 1988 Democratic National Convention was held at The Omni in Atlanta, Georgia, from July 18 to 21, 1988, to select candidates for the 1988 presidential election. At the convention Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts was nominated for president and Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas for vice president. The chair of the convention was Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Jim Wright.

==Speakers==

Speakers at the convention included Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards, who gave a keynote speech that put her in the public spotlight and included the line that George H. W. Bush was &quot;born with a silver foot in his mouth&quot;. This speech was listed as #38 in American Rhetoric&#x27;s Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century. Arkansas governor Bill Clinton gave a very long and widely jeered nomination speech on the opening night that some predicted would ruin his political career, Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy&#x27;s remarks contained the iteration &quot;Where was George?&quot;, and Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower called Bush &quot;a toothache of a man.&quot;

In one of the subsequent presidential debates, when questioned about the general alleged &quot;negativity&quot; of the campaign, Bush cited the &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks against him at the convention as the root cause.

==Production==
The organizers for the convention chose pastel colors as a background in the belief that they would appear better on television. They were patterned after the colors of the American flag in salmon, azure, and eggshell. Republicans mocked the choice and used it to buttress their case that the Democrats were &quot;soft&quot; on the issues. New Jersey governor Thomas Kean claimed at the Republican Convention that &quot;The Dukakis Democrats will try to talk tough, but don&#x27;t be fooled. They may try to talk like Dirty Harry, but they will still act like Pee Wee Herman.&quot; Kean continued that Democrats and Republicans alike &quot;have no use for pastel patriotism... The liberal Democrats are trying to hide more than the colors in our flag; they are trying to hide their true colors.&quot;

The theme song for the convention was composed and performed by longtime supporter and folksinger Carly Simon originally for the &#x27;84 DNC with different verses. Entitled &quot;Turn of the Tide&quot;, the original version was accompanied by many of the famous folk singers, soft rockers and other light-adult-contemporary stars of the period. Originally available only on a limited run single-sided promotional 45 RPM record along with the matching program and other memorabilia, this version with the new verses for 1988 was released primarily as the B-side of the hit single &quot;Let the River Run&quot; from the 20th Century Fox motion picture &quot;Working Girl&quot; and was also used a few months later in the U.S./Russian co-production of Marlo Thomas&#x27; and Tatiana Vedeneyeva&#x27;s Emmy Award-winning ABC television special &quot;Free to Be... a Family&quot;. Finally, the cut closed out the award-winning soundtrack album on A&amp;M Records, Cassettes and CDs.

==Results==
A number of candidates withdrew from the race at the start of the convention as the rules stated that delegates won by withdrawn candidates could be replaced. The final contest for the nomination was between Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.

===Presidential nomination===
====Vice presidential nomination====
With Jackson&#x27;s supporters demanding that he receive the vice-presidential nomination as his reward for coming in second, the Dukakis campaign decided to nominate Senator Bentsen by voice vote, rather than a roll call. This would become the tradition.

== Platform ==

=== Abortion ===
The platform added &quot;the fundamental right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed regardless of ability to pay&quot;.

<doc id="602878" wikidata="Q3850896" url="?curid=602878" title="Columbine Mine massacre">
<text>The Columbine Mine massacre occurred in 1927, in the town of Serene, Colorado. In the midst of the 1927–1928 Colorado Coal Strike across the state, workers had been picketing one of the few remaining operating mines, in Serene. A fight broke out between Colorado state militia and a group of striking coal miners, during which the unarmed miners were attacked with firearms. The miners testified that machine guns were fired at them, which the state police disputed. Six strikers were killed, and dozens were injured.

==Background==

The company town of Serene, Colorado, nestled on a rolling hillside, was the home of the Columbine mine. Since it was one of the few coal mines in the state to remain in operation, for the past two weeks the strikers had conducted morning rallies at Serene (by this point, the strike was five weeks old).On November 21, 1927, five hundred miners, some accompanied by their wives and children, arrived at the north gate just before dawn. They carried three United States flags.
That morning, the recently disbanded state police known as the Colorado Rangers were recalled to duty and would meet the picketers and bar their path. The miners were surprised to see men dressed in civilian clothes but armed with pistols, rifles, riot guns and tear gas. The Rangers were backed up by rifle-toting mine guards stationed on the mine dump. The Head of the Rangers, Louis Scherf, shouted to the strikers, &quot;Who are your leaders?&quot; &quot;We&#x27;re all leaders!&quot; came the reply. Scherf announced that the strikers would not be allowed into the town, and for a few moments, the strikers hesitated outside the fence. There was discussion, with many strikers asserting their right to proceed. They argued that Serene had a public post office, and some of their children were enrolled in the school in Serene. One of the Rangers reportedly taunted, &quot;If you want to come in here, come ahead, but we&#x27;ll carry you out&quot;.

Strike leader Adam Bell stepped forward and asked for the gate to be unlocked. As he put his hand on the gate, one of the Rangers struck him with a club. A sixteen-year-old boy stood nearby and was holding one of the flags. The banner was snatched from him, and in the tug of war that followed, the flagpole broke over the fence. The miners rushed toward the gate, and suddenly the air was filled with tear gas launched by the police. A tear gas grenade hit Mrs. Kubic in the back as she tried to flee. Some of the miners threw the tear gas grenades back.

The miners in the front of the group scaled the gate, led by Adam Bell&#x27;s call of &quot;Come on!&quot; Three policemen pulled Bell down, viciously clubbed on the head, he fell unconscious to the ground. A battle raged over his prostrate form, the miners shielding him from the Rangers. Mrs. Elizabeth Beranek, the mother of 16 children and one of the flag-bearers, tried to protect him by thrusting her flag in front of his attackers. The police turned on her, bruising her severely. Rangers reportedly seized Mrs. Beranek&#x27;s flag too.

Police admitted to using clubs in the skirmish. Scherf said, &quot;We knocked them down as fast as they came over the gate&quot;. Miners would later say that the clubs were lengths of gas pipe. A striker belted one Ranger in the face, breaking his nose. A pocketknife-wielding miner cut another on the hand while other strikers pelted the Rangers with rocks. Blood gushed from a cut above one Ranger&#x27;s eye when a rock found its mark, the police then retreated.

==Massacre==
Enraged, the strikers forced their way through the wooden gate. Jerry Davis grabbed one of the fallen flags as hundreds of angry miners surged through the entrance, others scaled the fence east of the gate.

The police retreated, forming two lines at the water tank; inside the fence. Louis Scherf fired two .45 caliber rounds over the heads of the strikers. His men responded with deadly fire directly into the crowd. The miners scattered, twelve remained on the ground, some dead, some injured.

At least two, and possibly three, machine guns were available at the mine. Miners later claimed that their ranks were decimated by a withering crossfire from the mine tipple – a structure where coal was loaded onto railroad cars – and from a gun on a truck near the water tank.

Five died initially, on the day of the massacre. John Eastenes, 34, of Lafayette, married and father of six children, died instantly. Nick Spanudakhis, 34, of Lafayette, lived only a few minutes. Frank Kovich of Erie, Rene Jacques, 26, of Louisville, and 21-year-old Jerry Davis died hours later in the hospital. The Flag of the United States Davis carried was riddled with seventeen bullet holes and stained with blood. Mike Vidovich of Erie, 35, died a week later of his injuries.

==Aftermath==
The state police later testified that they had not used machine guns in the fight. The miners and some witnesses testified that machine guns were used. Some witnesses identified a mine guard who had climbed the tipple and may have operated the machine gun mounted there, providing one possible explanation for the discrepancy in testimony. However, one of Scherf&#x27;s men reportedly operated the machine gun near the water tank.

<text>Albert Charles Saunders (October 12, 1874 – October 18, 1943) was a Canadian politician and jurist from Prince Edward Island.

Saunders served as mayor of Summerside for four terms. He was first elected to the provincial legislature in 1919 and became leader of the opposition Liberal Party in 1923.

He led the Liberals to victory in the 1927 election by supporting the continuation of total prohibition against the Conservative government&#x27;s proposals to ease the temperance measure. The Saunders government revised the curriculum of the public school system, raised the salaries of teachers and improved the island&#x27;s roads.

He served as the 16th premier of Prince Edward Island until 1930 when he accepted an appointment to the provincial Supreme Court.

Saunders died at home in Summerside on October 18, 1943.

<text>The Mysterious Stranger is a novella by the American author Mark Twain. He worked on it intermittently from 1897 through 1908. Twain wrote multiple versions of the story; each involves a supernatural character called &quot;Satan&quot; or &quot;No. 44&quot;, encountering Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer.

== Versions ==
The three stories differ in length: &quot;The Chronicle of Young Satan&quot; has about 55,000 words, &quot;Schoolhouse Hill&quot; 15,300 words and &quot;No. 44, the Mysterious Stranger&quot; 65,000 words.

=== &quot;St. Petersburg Fragment&quot; ===
Mark Twain wrote the &quot;St. Petersburg Fragment&quot; in September 1897. It was set in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, a name Twain often used for Hannibal, Missouri. Twain then revised this version, removing references to St. Petersburg, and used the text for &quot;The Chronicle of Young Satan&quot;.

=== &quot;The Chronicle of Young Satan&quot; ===
The first substantial version is entitled &quot;The Chronicle of Young Satan&quot; (also referred to as the &quot;Eseldorf&quot; version) and relates the adventures of Satan, the sinless nephew of the biblical Satan, in Eseldorf, a village in Austria, in the year 1702. Twain wrote this version between November 1897 and September 1900. &quot;Eseldorf&quot; is German for &quot;Assville&quot; or &quot;Donkeytown&quot;.

=== &quot;Schoolhouse Hill&quot; ===
The second substantial text Twain attempted to write is known as &quot;Schoolhouse Hill&quot; or the &quot;Hannibal&quot; version. It is set in the U.S., and concerns the adventures of the familiar characters Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer with Satan, referred to in this version as &quot;No. 44, New Series 864962&quot;. Twain began writing it in November 1898 and, like the &quot;St. Petersburg Fragment&quot;, set it in the fictional town of St. Petersburg.

=== &quot;No. 44, the Mysterious Stranger&quot; ===
The third text, called &quot;No. 44, the Mysterious Stranger: Being an Ancient Tale Found in a Jug and Freely Translated from the Jug&quot;, also known as the &quot;Print Shop&quot; version, returns to Austria, this time in the year 1490, not long after the invention of printing. It tells of No. 44&#x27;s mysterious appearance at the door of a print shop and his use of heavenly powers to expose the futility of mankind&#x27;s existence. This version also introduces an idea that Twain was toying with at the end of his life, involving a duality of the &quot;self&quot;, composed of the &quot;Waking Self&quot; and the &quot;Dream Self&quot;. Twain explores these ideas through the use of &quot;Duplicates&quot;, copies of the printshop workers made by No. 44.
This version contains an actual ending, but the text still has many flaws and it is debatable whether it can be considered finished.
Twain wrote this version between 1902 and 1908.

== Paine-Duneka text of 1916 ==
The edition published in 1916 (in seven parts in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and separately as a book published by Harper&#x27;s) is composed mainly of a heavily edited &quot;Chronicle of Young Satan&quot;, with a slightly altered version of the ending from &quot;No. 44&quot; tacked on. Albert Bigelow Paine, who had sole possession of Twain&#x27;s unfinished works after Twain&#x27;s death and kept them private, claimed that he had searched through Twain&#x27;s manuscripts and had found the proper intended ending for &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot;. After Paine&#x27;s death in 1937, Bernard DeVoto became the possessor of Twain&#x27;s manuscripts and released them to the public. In the 1960s, critics studied the original copies of the story and found that the ending Paine chose for &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot; referred to the characters from different versions of the story (such as No. 44 instead of Satan) and the original names had been crossed out and written over in Paine&#x27;s handwriting.

In 1963, scholars led by researcher John S. Tuckey carefully examined Twain&#x27;s papers and manuscripts and discovered that Paine had not only tampered with and patched together three previously unfinished manuscripts but also had with assistance from Frederick Duneka added passages not written by Twain in order to complete &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot;. The book version that was published nonetheless maintains Twain&#x27;s criticisms of what he believed to be the hypocrisy of conventional religion.

According to editor W. M. Gibson, Paine&#x27;s volume was a literary fraud that went undetected for more than 40 years. Nevertheless, Gibson also admits that &quot;the cut, cobbled-together, partially falsified text has the power to move and to satisfy esthetically despite its flaws.&quot;

=== Summary ===
In 1590, three boys, Theodor, Seppi, and Nikolaus, live relatively happy simple lives in a remote Austrian village called Eseldorf (German for &quot;Assville&quot; or &quot;Donkeytown&quot;). The story is narrated by Theodor, the village organist&#x27;s son. Other local characters include Father Peter, his niece Marget, and the astrologer.

One day, a handsome teenage boy named Satan appears in the village. He explains that he is an angel and the nephew of the fallen angel whose name he shares. Young Satan performs several magical feats. He claims to be able to foresee the future and informs the group of unfortunate events that will soon befall those they care about. The boys do not believe Satan&#x27;s claims until one of his predictions comes true. Satan proceeds to describe further tragedies that will befall their friends. The boys beg Satan to intercede. Satan agrees but operates under the technical definition of mercy. For instance, instead of a lingering death due to illness, Satan simply causes one of Theodor&#x27;s friends to die immediately.

In the village and in other places around the world where Satan transports them magically, the boys witness religious fanaticism, witch trials, burnings, hangings, deaths and mass hysteria. Finally, Satan vanishes after explaining: Strange, indeed, that you should not have suspected that your universe and its contents were only dreams, visions, fiction! Strange, because they are so frankly and hysterically insane—like all dreams: a God who could make good children as easily as bad, yet preferred to make bad ones; who could have made every one of them happy, yet never made a single happy one; who made them prize their bitter life, yet stingily cut it short; who gave his angels eternal happiness unearned, yet required his other children to earn it; who gave his angels painless lives, yet cursed his other children with biting miseries and maladies of mind and body; who mouths justice and invented hell—mouths mercy and invented hell—mouths Golden Rules, and forgiveness multiplied by seventy times seven, and invented hell; who mouths morals to other people and has none himself; who frowns upon crimes, yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then tries to shuffle the responsibility for man&#x27;s acts upon man, instead of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon himself; and finally, with altogether divine obtuseness, invites this poor, abused slave to worship him!... [T]here is no God, no universe, no human race, no earthly life, no heaven, no hell. It is all a dream—a grotesque and foolish dream. Nothing exists but you. And you are but a thought—a vagrant thought, a useless thought, a homeless thought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities!

== University of California Press editions ==
In 1969, the University of California Press published, as part of The Mark Twain Papers Series, a scholarly edition of all three unaltered manuscripts, edited by William M. Gibson and titled &quot;Mark Twain&#x27;s Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts&quot;; it was republished in 2005. The same publisher released a final version of &quot;No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger&quot; in a popular edition in 1982.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film versions ===
In 1982, a film version of &quot;No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger&quot; was shot by The Great Amwell Company and shown in the United States on PBS, and later on HBO and was directed by Peter H. Hunt. The role of 44 was played by Lance Kerwin, and August was played by Chris Makepeace.

A scene from &quot;The Chronicle of Young Satan&quot; was adapted in the 1985 claymation film &quot;The Adventures of Mark Twain&quot;, wherein Satan invites Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn, and Becky Thatcher to his company, displaying his powers to manifest things at will. He invites them to construct small clay people, which he brings to life and places in a small kingdom. Satan expresses curiosity and eventually spite toward their creations when the clay people display infighting and inflict cruelty on one another. He causes plagues and natural disasters to destroy the small community, buries the ruins with an earthquake, and causes wild vegetation to engulf the spot where the clay people once lived, demonstrating the futility and insignificance of mankind—much to the horror of the children, with Huck Finn uttering &quot;You murdered them!&quot; Satan advises them that &quot;people are of no value&quot; and that more could be made &quot;if we need them&quot;. The scene also quotes Satan&#x27;s last line from the book. In this version, Satan appears playful and friendly when he constructs the small kingdom, slowly revealing himself as cruel and hateful as he destroys it (although he claims he &quot;can do no wrong&quot; since he does not understand the word&#x27;s meaning). He appears as a robed, headless figure with a mask where his head would be. As his true nature is revealed, the mask gradually changes from a pleasant appearance to a demonic visage and finally a grinning skull. The film also gives a paraphrased line from &quot;No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger&quot; to Mark Twain as his parting remark to the children: &quot;The human race in all its poverty has only one truly effective weapon: Laughter. Against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.&quot;

In 1989, a film adaptation of this book was shot in the Soviet Union by Igor Maslennikov and released under the title &quot;Filipp Traum&quot;. Philipp Traum is the name Satan comes to use amongst humans, &quot;traum&quot; being the German word for &quot;dream&quot;.

The 2019 acid western movie &quot;Day of the Stranger&quot; is a loose adaptation of the story in a western setting.

=== Opera ===
Kevin Malone&#x27;s opera &quot;Mysterious 44&quot; is inspired by the work. The premiere, performed by Manchester Opera Project with a narrated introduction and conclusion by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, was at the residence of the Hallé Orchestra at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Ancoats, Manchester, on 24 May 2014.

=== Pop culture === 

Artist Ted Richards drew a comic-strip adaptation of &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot; for his &quot;Dopin&#x27; Dan&quot; character in &quot;Rip-Off Comix No. 1&quot; (Rip-Off Press, San Francisco, 1977).

The story of &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot; is loosely adapted for a side quest in the 2010 video game Red Dead Redemption and it&#x27;s 2018 prequel, with a similar character who sends the protagonist John Marston on various morality based quests.

<text>David Conte (born 1955) is an American composer who has written over 150 works published by E.C. Schirmer (a division of ECS Publishing), including six operas, a musical, works for chorus, solo voice, orchestra, chamber music, organ, piano, guitar, and harp. Conte has received commissions from Chanticleer, the San Francisco Symphony Chorus, Harvard University Chorus, the Men’s Glee Clubs of Cornell University and the University of Notre Dame, GALA Choruses from the cities of San Francisco, New York, Boston, Atlanta, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., the Dayton Philharmonic, the Oakland Symphony, the Stockton Symphony, the Atlantic Classical Orchestra, the American Guild of Organists (2004, 2009, 2014, 2015), Sonoma City Opera, and the Gerbode Foundation (for his opera &quot;America Tropical&quot;). He was honored with the American Choral Directors Association (ACDA) Brock Commission in 2007 for his work &quot;The Nine Muses,&quot; and in 2016 he won the National Association of Teachers of Singing (NATS) Art Song Composition Award for his work &quot;American Death Ballads&quot;.

==Education and career==
Conte attended public schools in Lakewood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland.  His earliest musical experiences were attending rehearsals of Robert Shaw’s Cleveland Orchestra Chorus, of which his mother Nancy was a member, and singing in the doo-wop vocal group Shameful and the Seven Sinners. Conte earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Bowling Green State University, where he studied with Wallace DePue, and his master’s and doctoral degrees from Cornell University, where he studied with Karel Husa, Steven Stucky, and Robert Moffat Palmer. From 1975 to 1978, he studied with Nadia Boulanger in Paris and Fontainebleau, where he was one of her last students.

Conte has been honored as a Fulbright scholar in Paris, a Ralph Vaughan Williams Fellow and an Aspen Music Festival Conducting Fellow. He has served on the faculties of Cornell, Colgate University, Keuka College, and the Interlochen Center for the Arts. While at Cornell, he served as both the assistant director and acting director of the Cornell University Glee Club, for whom he composed numerous works. Since 1985, Conte has been Professor of Composition at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. From 2000 to 2014, he was conductor of the Conservatory Chorus, and in 2014, he was appointed Chair of the Composition Department. He served as Composer-in-Residence with the theater company Thick Description from 1991–2008, for whom he composed two chamber operas: &quot;Firebird Motel&quot; (2003; David Yezzi librettist) and &quot;America Tropical&quot; (2007; Oliver Mayer, librettist). In 1991 he served on the faculty of the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau, France (Fontainebleau Schools). Conte served on the composition faculty of the European American Musical Alliance in Paris from 2011–2022. In 2011, he joined the board of the American Composers Forum, serving until 2017. Since 2014 he has been the Composer in Residence with Cappella SF, a San Francisco-based professional chorus. In 2017, Conte travelled to the UK as the judge of the &quot;Caritas International Young Composer Competition&quot; hosted by the Caritas Chamber Choir, returning again in 2019 to judge the renamed &quot;Caritas International Emerging Composer Competition&quot;. In 2018, he joined the faculty of the Choral Chameleon Summer Institute for Composers and Conductors in New York City, New York. In 2022, he joined the faculty of SongFest, an annual festival dedicated to the medium of art song, and in 2021–22 he served as a composer-mentor for the National Association of Teachers of Singing.

In 1982, Conte lived and worked at the home of Aaron Copland, where he undertook a study of the manuscript sketches of Copland’s last orchestral work, “Inscape,” which became the basis of his doctoral thesis at Cornell University.  Conte’s choral music has been the subject of four doctoral theses, and he is the author of articles on Copland, Vaughan Williams, and on the pedagogy of choral composition, all published in &quot;The Choral Journal&quot;, the membership-based monthly publication of the American Choral Director’s Association.

One of his best-known works is the opera &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot; (Nicholas Giardini, librettist), which has received over 30 productions in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Russia. His opera &quot;The Dreamers&quot; (Philip Littell, librettist), led to a commission from the Oakland Symphony for &quot;The Journey&quot; (a cantata, 2001). Film scores include &quot;Orozco: Man of Fire&quot; for the PBS American Master&#x27;s Series (2006), and &quot;Ballets Russes&quot; shown at the Sundance and Toronto Film Festivals (2005). Other prominent works include “Fantasy for Orchestra”, and “A Copland Portrait” (orchestra and band), and &quot;Soliloquy&quot;, and &quot;Pastorale and Toccata&quot; (organ). Many of his choral works have received wide acceptance, including &quot;Cantate Domino&quot;, &quot;Invocation and Dance&quot;, &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, &quot;Charm me asleep&quot;, &quot;Elegy for Matthew&quot; (in memory of Matthew Sheppard, text by John Stirling Walker), &quot;September Sun&quot; (in memory of 9/11, with text also by Walker), &quot;An Exhortation&quot; (composed for the 2009 inauguration of President Barack Obama), and &quot;Three Mexican Folk Songs&quot;.

Conte&#x27;s work is represented on many commercial CD recordings, including &quot;Chamber Music of David Conte&quot; (2015) on the Albany label; &quot;Facing West: Choral Music of Conrad Susa and David Conte&quot; (2016) on the Delos Label; and &quot;Everyone Sang: Vocal Music of David Conte&quot; (2018) on the Arsis label.

<text>The Second Battle of Breitenfeld, also known as the First Battle of Leipzig, took place during the Thirty Years&#x27; War on 2 November 1642 at Breitenfeld, north-east of Leipzig in Germany. A Swedish Army commanded by Lennart Torstensson decisively defeated an Imperial Army under Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria and his deputy Ottavio Piccolomini.

Victory allowed the Swedes to occupy and establish a secure base in Leipzig, the second most important town in the Electorate of Saxony. However, although significantly weakened by the defeat and forced onto the defensive, the Imperial Army prevented them from fully exploiting their victory and kept John George I, Elector of Saxony from making peace with Sweden.

==Prelude==
During 1641, the Swedish army narrowly escaped the pursuit by Imperials and Bavarians after its failed attack on the Imperial Diet in Regensburg in January. Its commander Johan Banér lost several thousand men at the battles of Neunburg and Preßnitz until his untimely death at Halberstadt in May. With the help of their French and Guelph allies, the remnant of the Swedes repelled the Imperials at Wolfenbüttel but only the arrival of Lennart Torstensson in November with fresh recruits and the outstanding pay saved them from mutiny. The Emperor&#x27;s peace with the Guelphs in the Treaty of Goslar removed the strategic link between the Swedes and the French army under Jean-Baptiste Budes de Guébriant, forcing the French to turn west where they defeated an Imperial army under Guillaume de Lamboy at Kempen in early 1642.

Because of Kempen, the Westphalian army under Melchior von Hatzfeld and the Bavarians under Franz von Mercy split up from the main Imperial force to contain Guébriant&#x27;s advance. Both Imperials and Swedes moved to the east where the Swedes pitched winter quarters in Brandenburg, which had declared neutrality in 1641. Brandenburg&#x27; denial of military access to the Imperials prevented them from assaulting the Swedes in February 1642. Therefore, the Imperial commander Archduke Leopold Wilhelm was compelled to retreat from Genthin in the Bishopric of Magdeburg to move into winter quarters in late February. While the Imperials were still obtaining quarters in April, the Swedes already started their campaign.

The new Swedish commander Torstensson planned a major offensive in 1642 to strike into the Habsburg lands. While a mobile force under Hans Christoff von Königsmarck raided westward towards Quedlinburg as a distraction, Torstensson moved east to Lusatia from where he invaded Silesia. He took Głogów, one of its strongest fortresses, by storm on 4 May. The Imperial commander in Silesia, Franz Albrecht of Saxe-Lauenburg, collected a small army of 7,500 men and called Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria for aid. Before being reinforced by a detachment from the main Imperial Army under Ottavio Piccolomini, Franz Albrecht tried to relieve the siege of Schweidnitz. Tricked into attacking a much larger Swedish force on 31 May, his troops were overwhelmed and he himself mortally wounded.

Piccolomini withdrew to Brno to join up with the Archduke, while on 14 June Torstensson captured Olomouc in Moravia after a short siege. After collecting superior forces, the Imperials forced the outnumbered Swedes back into Silesia pursued by the Archduke. Leaving a blockading corps at Olomouc, on 25 July his vanguard under Raimondo Montecuccoli defeated a Swedish detachment at Troppau which was screening the siege of Brieg, forcing Torstensson to abandon it and retreat across the Oder river. The Archduke laid siege to Głogów on 10 August but abandoned it on 12 September when Torstensson offered him battle in front of the fortress. The Swedish army was now large enough to put the Imperials under pressure and they pulled back to the Bohemian border where they entrenched themselves and used their light cavalry to harass the Swedish supply lines. Withdrawing into Saxony in October, Torstensson laid siege to Leipzig, the second-largest city in Saxony and an important stronghold for John George I, Elector of Saxony, an Imperial ally.

==Battle==

The fast approach of the Imperial Army under the Archduke and Piccolomini forced Torstensson to lift the siege of Leipzig on 1 November. Assuming the Swedes were in disorderly retreat, the Archduke and his war council decided to attack against the advice of Piccolomini who considered them too strong for a direct assault. The Swedes retreated to better positions outside Breitenfeld where they awaited an attack.

The Imperials had 26,000 men and 46 guns against 20,000 and 70 respectively for the Swedes. Despite the disparity in numbers, the two forces were roughly equivalent because the Imperial army included many irregular Croatian and Hungarian cavalry of questionable combat value, as well as some dragoons and old-fashioned arquebusier regiments. In contrast, the Swedish cavalry was almost exclusively formed out of heavy cuirassiers. Both sides placed their cavalry on the wings, with the infantry in the centre, split into two subgroups because a small forest, the Linkelwald, bisected the Imperial lines.

Battle began in the early morning of 2 November with an artillery duel in which Swedish infantry commander Johan Lilliehöök was mortally wounded. The Swedes crossed the Rietzschke river and their right wing under Arvid Wittenberg attacked the Imperial left. Its commander Hans Christoph von Puchheim had not yet fully deployed his troops and some of his regiments took flight, allegedly led by Madlo&#x27;s regiment of arquebusiers in the front line, followed by a number of neighbouring units and most of the Saxon regiments holding the second line. The remainder were rallied by Colonel Nicola who repulsed two Swedish attacks with the support of the reserve cavalry under Ernst Roland von Suys before a third assault broke through, killing Nicola and several other officers.

On the other side of the battlefield, the result was the opposite. The Imperial right under Annibale Gonzaga and Count Bruay shattered most of the Swedish left under Erik Slang and pushed them back onto their reserve under Königsmarck which continued to resist. Torstensson now decided to split his victorious right; one part under Torsten Stålhandske pursued the fleeing Imperial left, while the rest under Wittenberg moved behind the Imperial centre to attack their right from behind. Under pressure from two sides, this broke while Piccolomini and the Archduke used their personal bodyguards along with the Alt- and Neu-Piccolomini, Mislik, Borneval and Luttke regiments as a rear guard to cover their retreat. Although the infantry north of the Linkelwald escaped, the group to the south was encircled by the Swedish cavalry and forced to surrender.

The Imperial Army lost all 46 guns along with 3,000 to 5,000 dead or wounded plus another 4,500 or 5,000 taken prisoner, including generals Suys and Fernemont. Swedish casualties were 4,000 dead or wounded; Generals Lilliehöök and Slang were killed, while General Stålhandske, commander of the Finnish &quot;Hakkapeliitta&quot; cavalry, was seriously wounded.

==Aftermath==
Rather than a renewed offensive, Torstensson renewed the siege of Leipzig which held out until 7 December. Its loss gave the Swedes a secure base in Saxony and was a serious blow to Elector John George, although most of the Imperial prisoners who joined the Swedish army after Breitenfeld deserted during the siege. Axel Lillie was appointed commander of Leipzig and enforced a large contribution of 150,000 talers. On 29 December, Wittenberg captured Chemnitz while Torstensson conferred with the French commander Guébriant. In early January, the Swedes besieged Freiberg, whose Saxon garrison resisted stubbornly and repelled a major assault on 13 January. Having rebuilt the Imperial Army in Bohemia, Piccolomini arrived outside Freiberg on 27 February, forcing the Swedes to abandon the siege, an action that may have stopped John George from leaving the war.

Archduke Leopold Wilhelm assembled a court-martial in Prague which sentenced the Madlo regiment to exemplary punishment at Rokycany. Six regiments, which had distinguished themselves in the battle, were assembled fully armed and surrounded Madlo&#x27;s regiment, which was severely rebuked for its cowardice and misconduct and ordered to lay down its arms, after which their regimental colours were torn in pieces. In a process known as decimation, lots were drawn and every 10th soldier of the regiment and 5 officers were executed next day.

Defeat ignited antagonism in the army between Germans and Italians, commonly called &quot;Welsche&quot; or &quot;Walsche&quot;, who claimed it was due to the collapse of the mostly German left wing under Puchheim, who in turn argued the mostly Italian right under Gonzaga had failed to support them. The court-martial of Madlo&#x27;s regiment seemed to confirm the guilt of the left wing but did not calm tempers. When the Archduke asked Hatzfeld, who had arrived with reinforcements in January 1643, to take over command while he travelled to Vienna, Hatzfeld refused saying he could not repair the mistakes of the Italians. Confronted with this insubordination, the Archduke resigned his command and in February was temporarily replaced by Piccolomini before he decided to enter Spanish service and stepped down in April. The returning Trentine general Matthias Gallas took over command, largely because he was acceptable to both Germans and Italians. Most of the Italian generals like the Gonzagas or Montecuccoli chose to retire or depart for Italy to fight in the First War of Castro. Only Bruay was persuaded by the Emperor to stay instead of following Piccolomini.

In April, the Swedes started their next offensive. Gallas anticipated their aim of resupplying Olomouc and tried to block their way with a strong defensive position at Hradec Králové and by refusing them any crossing of the Elbe. Torstensson avoided Gallas&#x27; main force and feinted an attack at Brandýs nad Labem to distract the Imperials. In the meantime, he attained a crossing at Mělník. He moved forward and reached northern Moravia prior to Gallas where he resupplied the Swedish garrisons. Gallas and the Imperials followed him over Brno and again took a defensive position in front of the Swedes. The Imperials used their superior light cavalry to harass the Swedes in skirmishes. The Swedes held out until October when they retreated into Silesia and then left Habsburg territory entirely to attack Denmark in the Torstenson War.

<doc id="602895" wikidata="Q599124" url="?curid=602895" title="Black Canary">
<text>Black Canary is the name of two superheroines appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. As one of the earliest female superheroes in the DC Comics universe, the character has made numerous appearances in prominent team-up titles, including the &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; and &quot;Justice League of America&quot;. The Black Canary persona has been adopted by two individuals, portrayed as a legacy heroes with a mother-daughter relationship between the two. Following DC&#x27;s New 52 initiative, Black Canary was briefly amalgamated as a single character before the mother-and-daughter dynamic was restored to continuity.

Dinah Drake, the original Black Canary, was created by the writer-artist team of Robert Kanigher and Carmine Infantino, the character debuted in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #86 on July 31, 1947 (cover dated August 1947) in the Golden Age of Comic Books. Strong, mysterious, gutsy and romantic, she has been called &quot;the archetype of the new Film Noir era heroine.&quot; She is a prominent member of the Justice Society of America and gifted martial artist who engaged in crime-fighting exploits alongside her love interest and eventual husband, Larry Lance, a detective in Gotham City. Their union resulted in the birth of their daughter, Dinah Laurel Lance. In subsequent narratives following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; event, her daughters succeeds her mother as the new Black Canary. Dinah Drake is typically depicted as a skilled hand-to-hand combatant without superhuman abilities compared to her daughter and successor. Dinah Drake also appears in media set in the Arrowverse, portrayed by Juliana Harkavy, while Dinah Laurel Lance’s mother (also named Dinah) is portrayed by Alex Kingston.

The second Black Canary, Dinah Laurel Lance, was created by Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Dick Dillin, first appearing in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #75 (November, 1969). The character is often depicted as the daughter of the original Dinah Drake, possessing metahuman abilities and being highly skilled in martial arts. She is prominently associated with the &quot;Justice League&quot;, &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, and has had a significant relationship with Green Arrow alongside his allies. During Black Canary&#x27;s brief period as a composite character in the New 52, she was known as Dinah Laurel Lance (née Drake).

Black Canary has been adapted into various media, including direct-to-video animated films, video games, and in live-action and animated television series. Dinah Laurel is portrayed by Rachel Skarsten in the TV series &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, as well as in &quot;Smallville&quot;, portrayed by Alaina Huffman. Several versions appear in the TV show &quot;Arrow&quot;, with Laurel Lance being portrayed by Katie Cassidy, who also portrayed an evil version of the character named [[Black Siren (Arrowverse)|Black Siren]]. In this version, her sister [[Sara Lance]] was the first to become Black Canary, portrayed by Caity Lotz. Dinah Lance made her cinematic debut in the DC Extended Universe film &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, portrayed by Jurnee Smollett.

== Creation ==
Robert Kanigher and Carmine Infantino created the character in 1947 to be featured in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; as a supporting character. Appearing first as a clandestine crime-fighter who infiltrates criminal organizations to break them from the inside, the Black Canary was drawn with fishnet stockings and a black leather jacket to connote images of a sexualized yet strong female character. She appeared as a character in a back-up story featuring Johnny Thunder:
According to Amash and Nolen-Weathington (2010), Black Canary is &quot;really&quot; Carmine Infantino&#x27;s &quot;first character&quot;. According to the artist:When Kanigher gave me the script, I said, &#x27;How do you want me to draw her?&#x27; He said, &#x27;What&#x27;s your fantasy of a good-looking girl? That&#x27;s what I want.&#x27; Isn&#x27;t that a great line? So that&#x27;s what I did. I made her strong in character and sexy in form. The funny part is that years later, while in Korea on a National Cartoonists trip, I met a dancer who was the exact image of the Black Canary. And I went out with her for three years.Bob didn&#x27;t ask me for a character sketch [for the Black Canary]. He had a lot of respect for me, I must say that. He always trusted my work... Bob loved my Black Canary design.

===Golden Age bibliography===
During the Golden Age of Comic Books, Dinah Drake&#x27;s adventures were featured in:
* &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #86-88, 90-104 (Aug 1947-Feb 1949)
* &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #38-57 (Jan 1948-March 1951)
* &quot;Comic Cavalcade&quot; #25 (Feb 1948)

== Publication history ==
At her Golden Age debut, the Black Canary was the alter ego of Dinah Drake and participated in crime-fighting adventures with her love interest (and eventual husband), Gotham City detective Larry Lance. Initially, the character was a hand-to-hand fighter without superpowers who often posed as a criminal to infiltrate criminal gangs. She first meets the Justice Society of America in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #38 (December 1947-January 1948), joining them in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #41 (June–July 1948). Black Canary&#x27;s foes included criminal circus act Carno and His Masked Riders, and the Sacred Order of the Crimson Crystal.

Black Canary was revived with the other Golden Age characters during the 1960s. In these stories, it is retroactively established she lives on the parallel world of Earth-2 (home of DC&#x27;s Golden Age versions of its characters), in Ireland. Married to Larry Lance since the 1950s, Dinah participates in annual team-ups between the Justice Society and Earth-1&#x27;s Justice League of America. This period also marks the moment in which the character is given her signature superpower: the &quot;canary cry&quot;, a high-powered sonic scream which could shatter objects and incapacitate and even kill powerful foes. When DC Comics adjusted its continuity, the Black Canary was established as two separate entities: mother and daughter, Dinah Drake-Lance and Dinah Laurel Lance. Stories since the Silver Age focused on the younger Black Canary, ascribing her superhuman abilities to a genetic mutation.

Following the universe-altering events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (concluding in March 1986), the Black Canary&#x27;s history was revised again. The mind-transplant story of 1983 was discarded; in this version of the story, the present-day Black Canary is Dinah Laurel Lance, who inherits the identity from her mother, Dinah Drake-Lance. Although some references (for example, those in James Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Starman&quot; series) tried to distinguish between the two Canaries by calling the first &quot;Diana&quot;, recent accounts have confirmed Dinah as the mother&#x27;s given name.

The two Canaries&#x27; origin stories were told in full in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (vol. 2) #50 (August 1990). In this story, Dinah Drake is trained by her father, detective Richard Drake, intending to follow him on the Gotham City police force. When she is turned down, her disillusioned father dies shortly afterwards. Determined to honor his memory, Dinah fights crime and corruption by any possible means. She becomes a costumed vigilante, using her inheritance to open a flower shop as her day job. Dinah marries her lover, private eye Larry Lance, and several years later their daughter, Dinah Laurel Lance, is born (&quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #66 (June 2004) would establish that they took the name &quot;Laurel&quot; from a librarian Dinah befriended during a case).

A Black Canary miniseries by writer Greg Weisman and artist Mike Sekowsky was planned in 1984. Although its first issue was pencilled, the project was shelved due to the character&#x27;s use in writer-artist Mike Grell&#x27;s high-profile &quot;Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters&quot; series. Elements of the project were used in Weisman&#x27;s short film, &quot;DC Showcase: Green Arrow&quot;.

===&quot;The New 52&quot; version and beyond===
During DC&#x27;s &quot;The New 52&quot; era which began in 2011, Black Canary was portrayed as a single character with a metahuman Canary Cry resulting from government experiments on an alien child named Ditto. This version of Black Canary founded the Birds of Prey on her own, and led the super-team Team 7 alongside her husband Kurt Lance, before later becoming lead singer in a rock band called Black Canary. After five years, DC later began to row back on controversial &quot;New 52&quot; continuity changes with its &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; initiative, with the narrator of Geoff Johns&#x27; &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; #1, Wally West, lamenting, from outside the universe, on how Black Canary and Green Arrow hardly know each other anymore, when they should be husband and wife, as a result of sinister alterations to the timeline. The comic shows the pair briefly meeting, by chance, and then separately staying up at night, contemplating what is missing from their lives. They meet again in &quot;Green Arrow Rebirth&quot; #1, and instantly hit it off. As part of &quot;Rebirth&quot;, Black Canary also re-establishes the traditional Birds of Prey line up with Batgirl and Huntress, and also joins the Justice League of America.

Following subsequent continuity-restoring events in &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; and &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot;, the current Black Canary is re-established as being the daughter of her Golden Age predecessor, fully reversing the controversial &quot;New 52&quot; changes and bringing an end to the distinctive &quot;New 52&quot; version of the character. The largely erased &quot;New 52&quot; versions of the DC heroes were established as residing on Earth-52 in the comic book miniseries &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;.

During the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; era, Black Canary is handpicked by Batman to become a member of the &quot;Justice League of America&quot; to fight against a group of Extremists along with Vixen, Lobo, Killer Frost, Ray, and Atom.

In the Dawn of DC era, Black Canary leads an all-new team of Birds of Prey. Some of the members are Harley Quinn, Big Barda and Zealot.

In 2024, Black Canary received a solo series, &quot;Black Canary: Best of the Best&quot;, where she battles Lady Shiva for the title of the world&#x27;s most skilled martial artist.

== Character overview ==
A recurring theme within the Black Canary characters is the striking similarities they possess, both in terms of their personalities and fighting styles, even though they were trained by different masters or had different upbringings. 

=== Reputation ===
Both iterations of Black Canary are recognized as legacy heroes who have achieved renown for their exceptional skills as world-class detectives and martial artists. Despite operating in different time periods, both characters have earned a reputation as being among the best in the world in their respective fields. The martial arts skills of the second Black Canary are consistently portrayed as highly formidable and widely regarded among the best in the world. Within her publication history, she has faced notable opponents within the DC Universe, including Bronze Tiger, Cheshire, Lady Shiva, and Rabbit of the Twelve Brothers in Silk, who are considered to be nearly on par with Shiva. Additionally, Oracle holds the belief that Black Canary has the potential to defeat Batman in combat.

== Fictional character biography ==

=== Dinah Drake ===
Dinah Drake made her debut in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #86 (August 1947) as a supporting character in the &quot;Johnny Thunder&quot; feature, written by Robert Kanigher and drawn by Carmine Infantino. She initially appeared as a villain. Johnny is instantly infatuated with her, and is reproached by his Thunderbolt. Dinah is later revealed to have been infiltrating a criminal gang.

In &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #92 (February 1948) she has her own anthology feature, &quot;Black Canary&quot;, replacing &quot;Johnny Thunder&quot;. The new series fleshed out Black Canary&#x27;s backstory: Dinah Drake was a black-haired florist in love with Larry Lance, a Gotham City Police Department detective. She first meets the Justice Society of America in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #38 (December 1947-January 1948), joining them in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #41 (June–July 1948). Black Canary&#x27;s foes include criminal circus act Carno and His Masked Riders, and the Sacred Order of the Crimson Crystal.

Black Canary was revived with the other Golden Age characters during the 1960s. In these stories, it is retroactively established she lives on the parallel world of Earth-2 (home of DC&#x27;s Golden Age versions of its characters) in Ireland. Married to Larry Lance since the 1950s, Dinah participates in annual team-ups between the Justice Society and Earth-1&#x27;s Justice League of America.

In a 1969 JLA/JSA team-up against the rogue star-creature Aquarius, who banished Earth-2&#x27;s inhabitants (except the JSA) to another dimension, Larry Lance is killed saving Dinah&#x27;s life and Aquarius is defeated. Grief-stricken, Canary moves to Earth-1 and joins the Justice League. She begins a relationship with JLA colleague Green Arrow and discovers that she has developed an ultrasonic scream, the &quot;canary cry.&quot;

Black Canary teams with Batman five times in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; and once with Superman in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot;. Appearing frequently as a guest in the &quot;Green Arrow&quot; backup feature of &quot;Action Comics&quot;, she was a backup feature in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #244 (April–May 1977) to #256 (April–May 1979) (when the title was in Dollar Comics format). Black Canary&#x27;s backstory was featured in &quot;DC Special Series&quot; #10 (April 1978). After the &quot;Black Canary&quot; feature in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot;, she appears as a guest in its &quot;Green Arrow&quot; feature and in &quot;Detective Comics&quot;.

A story in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #219-220 (October and November 1983) served to explain the origin of Black Canary&#x27;s new sonic scream powers, and further, why she continued to appear youthful despite being active since the late 1940s (thereby making her nearly 60 years old). It was established that during the 1950s, she and Larry had a daughter, Dinah Laurel Lance, who was cursed by the Wizard with a devastating sonic scream. Her mother hoped that Johnny Thunder&#x27;s Thunderbolt could cure her, but the Thunderbolt was only able to keep the younger Dinah in suspended animation in his own dimension. To ease their pain, the Thunderbolt altered the memories of the tragedy, leaving all to believe Dinah&#x27;s daughter had simply died. Following the battle with Aquarius, Dinah discovered she was dying from radiation exposure, and she asked to see her daughter&#x27;s grave one last time. Shown the body of her daughter—still in suspended animation, but now grown to adulthood—Dinah wished that she could somehow be her successor. The Superman of Earth-1 and the Thunderbolt conceived a solution and transferred Dinah&#x27;s memories into her daughter&#x27;s body so that she could continue fighting as the Black Canary.

A Black Canary miniseries by writer Greg Weisman and artist Mike Sekowsky was planned in 1984. Although its first issue was pencilled, the project was shelved due to the character&#x27;s use in writer-artist Mike Grell&#x27;s high-profile &quot;Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters&quot; series. Elements of the project were used in Weisman&#x27;s short film, &quot;DC Showcase: Green Arrow&quot;.

When DC rebooted its continuity with The New 52, the character was amalgamated with Dinah Laurel Lance, and took the name Dinah Drake. The Golden Age Black Canary was restored to continuity in the lead-up to DC&#x27;s Infinite Frontier initiative.

==== Origin ====
Dinah was born to Richard Drake, an Irish detective in Gotham City, and an unnamed mother who died the early years of her marriage to Richard. This occurred in the early-to-mid 1900s, a time before corruption was deeply rooted in the city. Richard trained Dinah from a young age, hoping that she would follow in his footsteps and become a policewoman. They both aspired to combat the growing corruption and seek justice for Richard&#x27;s late wife. In her later years, Dinah developed a connection with Larry Lance, her father&#x27;s younger partner. She aimed to join the police academy, with the intention of helping her father and Larry in their efforts. However, despite her contributions, her application to the GCPD Police Academy was rejected. Both Dinah and Larry became disillusioned with the department. Richard suspected misogyny and was angered by the proposal of an administrative job for Dinah, feeling that the department did not want another honest member of their family in law enforcement. Tragically, Richard died due to a heart attack. Inspired by the actions of &quot;mystery men,&quot; Dinah decided to adopt the persona of the vigilante known as &quot;Black Canary.&quot; Initially, she trusted no one and assumed the guise of a criminal, targeting other criminals. In her civilian life, she pursued a career as a florist, seemingly abandoning her earlier desire to work in law enforcement.

==== Earlier exploits as Black Canary ====
In her early appearances, Black Canary made her initial debut as a supposed villain in the presence of hero Johnny Thunder. Johnny becomes immediately infatuated with her, much to the disapproval of his Thunderbolt companion. However, it is later revealed that Dinah had actually infiltrated a criminal gang, shedding light on her true intentions. In her own anthology feature, the character is portrayed as a black-haired florist who harbors romantic feelings for Larry Lance, a detective with the Gotham City Police Department. Eventually, she would meet the Justice Society of America and joined them among her ranks. As a hero, her foes included the criminal circus act Carno and His Masked Riders, and the Sacred Order of the Crimson Crystal.

Black Canary was revived with the other Golden Age characters during the 1960s. In these stories, it is retroactively established she lives on the parallel world of Earth-2 (home of DC&#x27;s Golden Age versions of its characters) in Ireland. Married to Larry Lance since the 1950s, Dinah participates in annual team-ups between the Justice Society and Earth-1&#x27;s Justice League of America. In a 1969 JLA/JSA team-up against the rogue star-creature Aquarius, who banished Earth-2&#x27;s inhabitants (except the JSA) to another dimension, Larry Lance is killed saving Dinah&#x27;s life and Aquarius is defeated. Grief-stricken, Canary moves to Earth-1 and joins the Justice League. She begins a relationship with JLA colleague Green Arrow and discovers that she has developed an ultrasonic scream, the &quot;canary cry.&quot;

A story in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #219-220 (October and November 1983) served to explain the origin of Black Canary&#x27;s new sonic scream powers, and further, why she continued to appear youthful despite being active since the late 1940s (thereby making her nearly 60 years old). It was established that during the 1950s, she and Larry had a daughter, Dinah Laurel Lance, who was cursed by the Wizard with a devastating sonic scream.

The Superman of Earth-1 and the Thunderbolt conceived a solution and transferred Dinah&#x27;s memories into her daughter&#x27;s body so that she could continue fighting as the Black Canary.

==== Revised history and death ====
Following the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, the character&#x27;s history underwent significant changes. Eventually, Dinah and Larry Lance married once again and established a private law firm in Gotham City. They welcomed the birth of their daughter, Dinah Laurel Lance, who would later aspire to become a superhero. Dinah herself retired from her own heroic endeavors and focused on raising her daughter. The members of the Justice Society of America became like a second family to them. However, Dinah held a contrasting view when it came to her daughter&#x27;s desire to become a hero. She vehemently opposed it, which led to arguments between them. It was during one of these arguments that young Dinah first manifested her metahuman ability known as the &quot;Canary Cry.&quot; Despite their strained relationship, her daughter went on to become a hero as Black Canary within the Justice League.

Tragedy struck when Larry Lance was killed by an alien entity that targeted the older Dinah. This event caused Dinah to become bitter and she pleaded with her daughter to give up her life as a hero, fearing further loss. Unfortunately, she contracted cancer from the same entity that claimed her husband&#x27;s life, leading to her hospitalization. Before passing away, Dinah apologized to her daughter for her actions, recognizing the similarities between them and reflecting on her own father. She acknowledged how alike they were and expressed remorse. In her final moments, she entrusted Green Arrow, her daughter&#x27;s lover, with looking after her. As she departed from this world, Spectre, a teammate, escorted her into the afterlife, where she eagerly anticipated reuniting with her parents and husband once more.

==== New 52 and onward ====
During a certain period, the character&#x27;s history was merged with that of her daughter, both assuming the name Dinah Drake. However, in preparation for DC&#x27;s Infinite Frontier initiative, the original Golden Age Black Canary was reintroduced into continuity. In this new continuity, although similarities from her prior history are present, the identity of Dinah Drake II&#x27;s father remains undisclosed, as the character Larry Lance was temporarily replaced by Kurt Lance during the amalgamation period before his history is retroactively added to Dinah Drake II&#x27;s history. Due the alterations after the New 52, it was retconned that the composite Dinah&#x27;s (now Dinah II) mother is retroactively Dinah Drake I.

In this history, originally depicted as a teenage mother, she found herself unable to adequately care for her daughter and made the difficult decision to abandon her at a young age. However, this truth remained unknown from the younger Dinah until a later point in her life, who instead believed she was abandoned. Further details emerged about the older Dinah&#x27;s life as the first Black Canary. She was widely recognized as a highly skilled martial artist, and she partnered with her unnamed husband, who worked as a private investigator in Gotham. At one point, she even founded her own martial arts group. To protect her daughter, Dinah made the difficult decision to leave her behind and assumed various disguises, including working as a florist and a dancer. Tragedy struck when her husband was killed during a confrontation with their adversary, Ravanahatha. In response, Dinah unleashed her unique martial arts technique known as the &quot;Five Heavens Palm,&quot; which proved instrumental in defeating the formidable demon. In a mysterious manner, she managed to pass down the knowledge of this technique to her daughter, which later became crucial when her daughter faced the same demon in battle.

=== Dinah Laurel Lance ===

Following the universe-altering events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (concluding in March 1986), Black Canary&#x27;s history was revised again. The mind-transplant story of 1983 was discarded; in this version of the story, the present-day Black Canary is Dinah Laurel Lance, who inherits the identity from her mother, Dinah Drake Lance. Although some references (for example, those in James Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Starman&quot; series) tried to distinguish the two Canaries by calling the first &quot;Diana&quot;, recent accounts have confirmed Dinah as the mother&#x27;s given name.

The two Canaries&#x27; origin stories were told in full in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; #50 (August 1990). In this story, Dinah Drake is trained by her Irish father, detective Richard Drake, intending to follow him on the Gotham City police force. When she is turned down, her disillusioned father dies shortly afterwards. Determined to honor his memory, Dinah fights crime and corruption by any possible means. She becomes a costumed vigilante, using her inheritance to open a flower shop as her day job. Dinah marries her lover, private eye Larry Lance, and several years later their daughter, Dinah Laurel Lance, is born (&quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #66 (June 2004) would establish that they took the name &quot;Laurel&quot; from a librarian Dinah befriended during a case).

The younger Dinah has her own &quot;canary cry&quot;—in this version, the result of a metagene absent from both her parents—which (unlike the Silver Age Black Canary) she can control. Growing up surrounded by her mother&#x27;s friends in the disbanded JSA (seeing them as uncles and aunts), she wishes to be a costumed hero like her mother, but the elder Dinah discourages her, feeling that the world has become too dangerous for her daughter to succeed. Regardless, Dinah finds fighters (including former JSA member Wildcat) who help her hone her skills, and after years of dedication and training, she assumes the mantle of Black Canary despite her mother&#x27;s opposition. Like her mother, Dinah operates out of Gotham, with a day job in the family floral business.

In an early &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; issue, writer Chuck Dixon has Dinah briefly married and divorced at a young age. Although ex-husband Craig Windrow seems to need her help, he actually wants to reconcile after he embezzles from the mob. Dinah&#x27;s early marriage and ex-husband are not mentioned again until the 2007 &quot;Black Canary&quot; limited series.

After joining the Justice League, Dinah meets Green Arrow (Oliver Queen). Although she dislikes him at first, they become romantically involved despite their age difference; opposite the earlier depiction, in the Modern Age stories, Oliver is considerably older than Dinah. Dinah is a League member for about six years, including a brief stint with Justice League International (JLI, which she helps found). After her mother&#x27;s death from radiation poisoning received during her battle with Aquarius, Dinah feels that her time in the JLA is over. She moves to Seattle with Green Arrow and opens a flower shop, Sherwood Florist.

When Dinah belonged to the JLI during the 1980s, she wore a new costume, a blue-and-black full-body jumpsuit with a bird motif and a slightly looser fit instead of her traditional, skin-tight black outfit with fishnet stockings. The change was poorly received and short-lived, and later artists restored her original look.

==== &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; ====

When former Batgirl Barbara Gordon is by the Joker, she reestablishes her crime-fighting career as Oracle, information broker to the superhero community. After briefly working with the Suicide Squad, she forms a covert-mission team. Since Barbara thinks that of all the superheroes Dinah has the most potential, Oracle asks Black Canary to become an operative.

Black Canary reinvents herself, trading her blonde wig for bleached blonde hair. Her relationship with Oracle is rocky at first, since her impulsiveness clashes with Oracle&#x27;s organization. Gradually, they learn to work together and became friends. When Oracle flees from Blockbuster, Dinah rescues her and meets Barbara Gordon, deepening their friendship.

&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; gives Earth a new timeline, with Wonder Woman again a founding member of the Justice League. In a Week 51 back-up feature of &quot;52&quot;, Black Canary is at the battle which forms the League. Its core is Black Canary, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), the Martian Manhunter, the Flash (Barry Allen), Aquaman, Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. In the 2007 &quot;Black Canary&quot; miniseries, she and Green Arrow join the Justice League after its founding and are tested by founding member Batman early in their membership.

During publication of the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; limited series, most DC Universe comic books advanced one year. After this &quot;One Year Later&quot; jump, Dinah trades life experiences with Lady Shiva to soften the warrior and begins a harsh training regimen in an unidentified Vietnamese shanty town. The regimen replicates Shiva&#x27;s early life and training, and Shiva assumes Dinah&#x27;s role in Oracle&#x27;s group.

During &quot;Countdown&quot;, several series include tie-ins and run-ups to the wedding of Dinah and Ollie. &quot;The Black Canary Wedding Planner&quot; details the preparations; in &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #109, Dinah and Barbara discuss the wedding (and Ollie). &quot;Countdown: Justice League Wedding Special&quot;, and &quot;Justice League&quot; #13 deal with the bachelor and bachelorette parties. A plot thread throughout is a plan by the Injustice League to attack the wedding.

Dinah resigns as JLA chairwoman after the team&#x27;s confrontation with the Shadow Cabinet. After learning that Ollie began his own Justice League with Hal Jordan, she confronts him when he arrives at the Watchtower to warn her of an attack on the world&#x27;s superheroes. Prometheus arrives and attacks the team, severing Red Arrow&#x27;s arm and maneuvering Dinah into the path of an energy bolt fired by Mikaal Tomas. After Prometheus is defeated, he destroys Star City with a teleportation device. In their search for survivors, Dinah and Ollie discover the bloody body of Roy&#x27;s daughter, Lian. Dinah goes to Roy&#x27;s hospital bedside with Donna Troy to break the news about his daughter when he emerges from his coma.

In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Dinah travels to Coast City to fight Nekron&#x27;s army of Black Lanterns. According to Nekron, he can control the heroes (including Ollie) who have died and been resurrected. Dinah fights her husband, now a Black Lantern, with Mia and Connor. Ollie regains control of his body long enough to miss his wife with a shot which severs a hose containing liquid nitrogen. Dinah orders Connor to use the hose on Ollie, freezing him solid, and the three join the rest of the heroes in battle.

When Ollie returns to normal, it is discovered that he secretly murdered Prometheus and left his body to rot at his headquarters. After Barry Allen and Hal Jordan confront Ollie and Dinah with the news, Ollie escapes. Dinah, Hal and Barry search the ruins of Star City for him, finding him looking for one of the men who worked for Prometheus. Ollie overpowers them, leaving Dinah in a restraining fluid. After Green Arrow surrenders for Prometheus&#x27; murder, Dinah visits him in jail and realizes that he wants to be left alone. She removes her wedding ring, leaving it with him, and does not attend his trial.

In &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, Dinah returns to Gotham in a relaunch of &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; with Gail Simone. In &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #1 (July 2010), she is sent to save a child with Lady Blackhawk. After receiving a call from Oracle, the team (including Huntress) is reunited. They are confronted by a new villainess, White Canary, who has a grudge against Dinah and exposes her civilian identity. After capturing White Canary (the vengeful sister of the Twelve Brothers in Silk), Dinah learns that Lady Shiva is behind the attack on the Birds. Dinah and White Canary travel to Bangkok; when the Birds arrive a short time later, Dinah attacks them dressed as White Canary. Later, Dinah reveals that Sin and her foster parents are being held hostage, their lives threatened unless Dinah challenges Lady Shiva to a fight to the death. Huntress offers to take Dinah&#x27;s place instead, reasoning that she has too many people who love her. However, this gives Dinah the opportunity to rescue Sin with the help of one of White Canary&#x27;s students, Terry, and race back to halt the duel between Helena and Shiva. While the duel is understood to be a matter of duty and honor, Dinah brings to their attention that there was no time mentioned and for now the fight must end, and to be resumed at a later time. While White Canary is displeased, Shiva sides with Black Canary and the Birds and the fight is over.

==== &quot;Bloodspell&quot; ====
Although the Black Canary–Zatanna graphic novel &quot;Bloodspell&quot;, written by Paul Dini and drawn by Joe Quinones, was scheduled for a 2012 release, it was delayed until May 2014. The story centers around the meeting of 16-year-old Dinah and Zatanna.

==== New 52 onward ====
During DC&#x27;s The New 52 era which began in 2011, Black Canary was portrayed as a single character with a metahuman Canary Cry resulting from government experiments. However, DC later began to row back on controversial New 52 continuity changes with its DC Rebirth initiative, with the narrator of Geoff Johns&#x27; &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; #1, Wally West lamenting, from outside the universe, on how Black Canary and Green Arrow hardly know each other any more, when they should be husband and wife, as a result of sinister alterations to the timeline. The comic shows the pair briefly meeting, by chance, and then separately staying up at night, contemplating what is missing from their lives. They meet again in &quot;Green Arrow Rebirth&quot; #1, and instantly hit it off. In the ensuing &quot;Green Arrow&quot; series, Dinah is the first to notice something awry with Oliver&#x27;s apparent suicide (in fact, an attempted assassination by Shado) and disappearance. She is also a current member of the Birds of Prey, as well as the Justice League of America. In &quot;Birds of Prey: Rebirth&quot;, it is revealed that Dinah and Barbara (Batgirl) have been good friends for a few years now, while just meeting Helena Bertinelli (Huntress). In &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, she is seen fighting Caitlin Snow (Killer Frost), and is later recruited by Batman due to the skills she possesses.

Following subsequent continuity-restoring events in &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; and &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot;, the current Black Canary is re-established as being the daughter of her Golden Age predecessor, fully reversing the controversial New 52 changes.

== Powers and abilities ==

=== Black Canary I ===
The original Black Canary character did not possess inherent superhuman powers but demonstrated exceptional martial arts skills and investigative abilities that were in line with those of law enforcement officers. She was proficient in various martial arts disciplines, such as Judo and a unique variation of chinese martial arts. Notably, she developed a technique called the &quot;Five Heavens Palm,&quot; which was described as a method that harnessed a form of energy accessible to master martial artists (likely qi). The resulting attack was capable of inflicting damage on supernatural entities.

She wears a choker necklace with a locket that serves multiple purposes. When activated, the locket can release a small knife or a smoke pellet. Additionally, it contains various other items, including an expandable sticky web, sneezing powder, and a converging lens. She can also train black canaries to do tricks.

=== Black Canary II ===
The second Black Canary is highly proficient in covert operations, military operations, and investigation. She is also a master martial artist with knowledge and training in many different martial art disciplines: Aikido, Boxing, Capoeira, Defendu, Hapkido, Judo, Jujutsu, Jeet Kune Do, Karate, Kickboxing, Kung Fu, Krav Maga, Muay Thai, Savate, Taekwondo, Shuri-te, Wing Chun, and can utilize the Five Heavens Palm &amp; Pressure Point techniques. These abilities have positioned her as a valuable leader within multiple superhero teams due to her tactical and strategic mind and abilities. She is also a talented musician and singer.

Unlike her predecessor, the second Black Canary is a metahuman who possesses a unique ability known as the Canary Cry. This power enables her to emit ultrasonic vibrations through a powerful scream, capable of causing destruction to objects in her vicinity. The Canary Cry has been portrayed as possessing tenfold the capabilities of typical sonic weapons, with the ability to break metals and generate enough resonance to impact and shatter the Earth. She can also glide and propel herself across long distances by screaming downwards.

==Other versions==

* On Earth-3, an evil equivalent of Black Canary called White Cat is a member of the supervillain co-op called the Crime Society of America.

* A version of Black Canary from Earth 3 named Black Siren was introduced in the DC Comics canon in &quot;Crime Syndicate&quot; #2, as one of the villains controlled by Starro who eventually joined the Crime Syndicate. In &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (vol. 7) #7, she became a member of Task Force X under the orders of Amanda Waller. This version of the character was also based on Scream Queen from &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths&quot;.

== In other media ==
The Black Canary has appeared in several adaptations of DC properties based on the comic books.

=== DC Animated Universe ===
Black Canary&#x27;s doppelganger Black Siren aka Donna Nance was originally introduced in the &quot;Justice League&quot; animated series two-part episode &quot;Legends&quot;, voiced by Jennifer Hale. She is the only female a member of the Justice Guild of America, and takes it upon herself to handle the household chores and duties. She is often paired with Cat Man on missions, being implied that they are also romantically engaged. It was later revelead that she died amidst a nuclear war in her world, who is viewed as fiction by inhabitants of the &quot;prime&quot; universe.

=== Arrowverse ===
A version of Black Siren from Earth-2 named Dinah Laurel Lance appeared in the Arrowverse originally as a minor villain in &quot;The Flash&quot; season 2, portrayed by Katie Cassidy. She later became a recurring and later main character in the later seasons of Arrow. She debuted in &quot;The Flash&quot; episode &quot;Invincible&quot; as a metahuman enforcer for Zoom who was eventually captured by Team Flash and imprisoned in S.T.A.R. Labs&#x27; pipeline. In &quot;Arrow&quot;, she was broken out by Prometheus to help him seek revenge on Green Arrow. In time, she would eventually defect to the latter&#x27;s side and become Black Canary of Earth-2.
*An Earth-X incarnation of Laurel Lance called Siren-X (also portrayed by Cassidy) appears in The Flash episode &quot;Fury Rogue&quot;, as a Nazi metahuman with echolocation and a member of the New Reichsmen.

==Reception==
The Black Canary is ranked the 71st-greatest comic book character of all time by &quot;Wizard&quot;, and IGN rated her its 81st-greatest all-time comic book hero. She was number 26 on &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list.

== Music ==
In 2016, DC Comics released a three-track musical album called &quot;EP 1&quot; to promote the comic book, in which the Black Canary becomes the lead singer of a band that shares her name. Caveboy lead singer Michelle Bensimon provided Dinah&#x27;s singing voice. A follow-up three-track album called &quot;EP 2&quot; followed in August 2017.

<text>John Howatt Bell (13 December 1846 – 29 January 1929) was a lawyer and politician who served as the 14th premier of Prince Edward Island.

Bell was born in Cape Traverse, the son of Walter Bell and Elizabeth Howatt. He was educated at Prince of Wales College and at Albert College in Belleville. After studying law, he was called to the Ontario bar in 1874 and set up practice in Ottawa, Ontario. He moved to Manitoba, was called to the bar there and set up practice in Emerson. In 1882, he married his first cousin, Helen, the daughter of Cornelius Howatt. He returned to Prince Edward Island, was called to the bar, and set up practice in Summerside.

Bell entered politics in 1886 when he was elected to the province&#x27;s legislative assembly as a Liberal. In 1898 he won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as a supporter of the federal Liberals under Sir Wilfrid Laurier. He lost his seat in 1900 but returned to the provincial assembly in 1915 when he was chosen to lead the Liberal Party and became leader of the opposition. After Bell led the Liberals to power in 1919, he became Premier. His government extended the province&#x27;s road system and adopted a highway improvement policy funded by a tax that contributed to the government&#x27;s unpopularity. His administration also extended the voting franchise to women in 1922.

Bell&#x27;s government was ridden with disputes within his cabinet, which harmed the party&#x27;s unity and popularity and led to his government&#x27;s electoral defeat in 1923 after a single term in office. Bell retired from politics and died six years later in a car accident in Los Angeles, California.

<doc id="602904" wikidata="Q337771" url="?curid=602904" title="Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook">
<text>Thomas George Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook, (22 January 182615 November 1904) was a British Liberal statesman. Gladstone appointed him Governor-General of India 1872–1876. His major accomplishments came as an energetic reformer who was dedicated to upgrading the quality of government in the British Raj. He reduced taxes and overcame bureaucratic obstacles in an effort to reduce both starvation and widespread social unrest. He served as First Lord of the Admiralty between 1880 and 1885.

==Background and education==
Northbrook was the eldest son of Francis Baring, 1st Baron Northbrook, by his first wife Jane, daughter of the Sir George Grey, 1st Baronet. Jane died when young Thomas was less than thirteen, and he studied under a tutor, Mr. Bird, at home and took an interest in natural history. At fourteen Thomas wrote to his father who was holidaying at Weymouth to capture a yellow butterfly with black spots at the end of each wing known to be found on Portland Island. He was sent briefly to another tutor, Mr. Vaughan Johnson at Chalons-sur-Marne, to study French. He also took an interest in sketching, learning from S. Palmer, and later his friend Edward Lear. He went to Christ Church, Oxford in 1843, and graduated with honours in 1846. He travelled in Europe and took an interest in mountaineering, joining his friend from Oxford, Alfred Seymour.

==Political career==
Northbrook entered upon a political career, and was successively private secretary to Henry Labouchere (Board of Trade), Sir George Grey (Home Office), and Sir Charles Wood (India Office and then Admiralty to 1857). In 1847 he served on the committee of the British Relief Association. In 1857, he was returned to the House of Commons for Penryn and Falmouth, which he represented until becoming a peer on the death of his father in 1866. He served under Lord Palmerston as Civil Lord of the Admiralty between 1857 and 1858, as Under-Secretary of State for War in 1861, as Under-Secretary of State for India between 1861 and 1864, under Palmerston and Lord Russell as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department between 1864 and 1866 and under Russell as Secretary to the Admiralty in 1866.

When William Ewart Gladstone acceded to power in 1868, Baring was again appointed Under-Secretary of State for War, and this office he held until February 1872, when he was appointed Viceroy of India. On 3 May he was Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India and ex officio Grand Master of the Order.

In January 1876, however, he resigned. He had recommended the conclusion of arrangements with Sher Ali Khan which, as has since been admitted, would have prevented the Second Anglo-Afghan War; but his policy was overruled by the Duke of Argyll, then Secretary of State for India. in 1876 he was created Viscount Baring, of Lee in the County of Kent, and Earl of Northbrook, in the County of Southampton.
From 1880 to 1885 Northbrook held the post of First Lord of the Admiralty in Gladstone&#x27;s second government. During his tenure of office the state of the navy aroused much public anxiety and led to a strong agitation in favor of an extended shipbuilding programme. The agitation called forth Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Fleet&quot;. In September 1884, Northbrook was sent to Egypt as special commissioner to inquire into its finances and condition. The inquiry was largely unnecessary, all the essential facts being well known, but the mission was a device of Gladstone&#x27;s to avoid an immediate decision on a perplexing question. Northbrook, after six weeks of inquiry in Egypt, sent in two reports, one general, advising against the withdrawal of the British garrison, and one financial. His financial proposals, if accepted, would have substituted the financial control of Britain for the international control proposed at the London Conference of June–August of the same year, but this was not carried out. When Gladstone formed his third ministry in 1886 Baring held aloof, being opposed to the Home Rule policy of the prime minister; and he then ceased to take a prominent part in political life.

==Other work==

Baring had served in the Hampshire Yeomanry, reaching the rank of major, and was appointed the regiment&#x27;s Honorary Colonel on 26 January 1889.

In 1890 he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire.

In the 1880s he was president of an offshoot of the National Indian Association, which was named the Northbrook Indian Society after its president. From 1890 to 1893 he was president of the Royal Asiatic Society.

In 1898 he sold the land of Manor House Gardens, to the London County Council, and also gifted land in Lee to public use, which was opened as Northbrook Park in 1903.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Botanic Society in November 1902.

==Family==

Lord Northbrook married Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Charles Sturt and sister of Lord Alington, in 1848. They had two sons and one daughter. She died in June 1867, aged 40. Lord Northbrook remained a widower until his death at Stratton Park, Hampshire, in November 1904, aged 78. There is a memorial to him at All Saints, East Stratton. He was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, Francis.

==Legacy in India==
The Ghanta Ghar Multan, or Clock Tower of Multan, was named &#x27;Northbrook Tower&#x27;. It is located in the center of Multan in Punjab province, Pakistan. A library named &#x27;Northbrook Hall&#x27; is located in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh.

<doc id="602905" wikidata="Q144505" url="?curid=602905" title="69230 Hermes">
<text>69230 Hermes is a sub-kilometer sized asteroid and binary system on an eccentric orbit, classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid and near-Earth object of the Apollo group, that passed Earth at approximately twice the distance of the Moon on 30 October 1937. The asteroid was named after Hermes from Greek mythology. It is noted for having been the last remaining named lost asteroid, rediscovered in 2003. The S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 13.9 hours. Its synchronous companion was discovered in 2003. The primary and secondary are separated by and are similar in size; they measure approximately and in diameter, respectively, with a combined effective diameter of .

== Discovery ==
Hermes was discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth in images taken at Heidelberg Observatory on 28 October 1937. Only four days of observations could be made before it became too faint to be seen in the telescopes of the day. This was not enough to calculate an orbit, and &quot;Hermes&quot; became a lost asteroid. It thus did not receive a number, but Reinmuth nevertheless named it after the Greek god Hermes. It was the third unnumbered but named asteroid, having only the provisional designation . The two others long lost were (1862) Apollo, discovered in 1932 and numbered in 1973, and (2101) Adonis, discovered in 1936 and numbered in 1977.

On 15 October 2003, Brian A. Skiff of the LONEOS project made an asteroid observation that, when the orbit was calculated backwards in time (by Timothy B. Spahr, Steven Chesley and Paul Chodas), turned out to be a rediscovery of Hermes. It has been assigned sequential number 69230. Additional precovery observations were published by the Minor Planet Center, the earliest being found in images taken serendipitously by the MPG/ESO 2.2-m La Silla telescope on 16 September 2000.

== Naming ==
This minor planet was named after the Greek god Hermes, who is the messenger of the gods and son of Zeus and Maia &quot;(see also and )&quot;. Recovered and numbered in late 2003, Hermes was originally named by the Astronomical Calculation Institute as early as 1937. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 9 November 2003 ().

== Orbit and classification ==
Hermes is an Apollo asteroid, a subgroup of near-Earth asteroids that cross the orbit of Earth. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.6–2.7 AU once every 2 years and 2 months (778 days; semi-major axis of 1.66 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.62 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. Due to its eccentricity, Hermes is also a Mars- and Venus-crosser. Frequent close approaches to both Earth and Venus make it unusually challenging to forecast its orbit more than a century in advance, though there is no impact risk within that timeframe.

=== Close approaches ===

The asteroid has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of which translates into 1.6 LD. On 30 October 1937, &quot;Hermes&quot; passed from Earth, and on 26 April 1942, from Earth. In retrospect it turned out that Hermes came even closer to the Earth in 1942 than in 1937, within 1.7 lunar distances; the second pass was unobserved at the height of the Second World War. For decades, Hermes was known to have made the closest known approach of an asteroid to the Earth. Not until 1989 was a closer approach (by 4581 Asclepius) observed. At closest approach, Hermes was moving 5° per hour across the sky and reached 8th magnitude.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Spectral type ===
Hermes is a stony S-type asteroid, as reported by Andy Rivkin and Richard Binzel. It has been characterized as a Sq-subtype using the SpeX instrument at NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. Sq-types transition to the Q-type asteroid.

=== Lightcurves ===
Three rotational lightcurves of Hermes were obtained from photometric observations in October 2003. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period between 13.892 and 13.894 hours with a brightness variation between and 0.06 and 0.08 magnitude, which indicates that the body has a nearly spherical shape ().
== Binary system ==
Radar observations led by Jean-Luc Margot at Arecibo Observatory and Goldstone in October and November 2003 showed Hermes to be a binary asteroid. The primary and secondary components have nearly identical radii of and , respectively, and their orbital separation is only 1,200 metres, much smaller than the Hill radius of 35 km.

The two components are in double synchronous rotation (similar to the trans-Neptunian system Pluto and Charon). Hermes is one of only four systems of that kind known in the near-Earth object population. The other three are , , and .
== In popular culture ==
In the 1978 novel &quot;The Hermes Fall&quot; by John Baxter, the asteroid endangers the Earth in 1980. It is not explicitly made clear as to whether or not the Hermes asteroid from &quot;The Hermes Fall&quot; is 69230 Hermes.

<doc id="602908" wikidata="Q3245062" url="?curid=602908" title="MERLIN">
<text>The Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) is an interferometer array of radio telescopes spread across England. The array is run from Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire by the University of Manchester on behalf of UK Research and Innovation.

The array consists of up to seven radio telescopes and includes the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank, Mark II, Cambridge, Defford in Worcestershire, Knockin in Shropshire, and Darnhall and Pickmere (previously known as Tabley) in Cheshire. The longest baseline is therefore 217 km and MERLIN can operate at frequencies between 151 MHz and 24 GHz. At a wavelength of 6 cm (5 GHz frequency), MERLIN has a resolution of 40 milliarcseconds which is comparable to that of the HST at optical wavelengths.

Some of the telescopes are occasionally used for European VLBI Network (EVN) and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations in order to create an interferometer with even larger baselines, providing images with much greater angular resolution.

==MTLRI==

In 1973, Henry Proctor Palmer made the suggestion of extending the interferometer links already in place at Jodrell Bank at the time, which started the planning of the telescope array. Construction started in 1975. The system was originally officially called MTRLI (Multi-Telescope Radio Linked Interferometer), but was commonly referred to by the simpler name of MERLIN. It originally consisted of either the 76m Lovell Telescope or the 25m Mark II, along with the 25m Mark III at Wardle, the 85 ft at Defford and a new telescope at Knockin. This
new telescope was made by E-Systems and was constructed based on the design for the telescopes in the Very Large Array, which was being constructed at the same time also by E-Systems.

The construction of the new telescope, the installation of microwave communication links and the construction of the correlator were jointly called &quot;Phase 1&quot; of the MERLIN project, the funding for which was approved on 30 May 1975. The construction of the new telescope started on 9 July 1976, and was completed by 8 October 1976. The telescope was first controlled remotely from Jodrell in January 1977. The microwave links were installed in May 1978. The first observations using the system – measurements of 30 distant radio sources – were taken in January and February 1980. The final cost of phase 1 of the system was £2,179,000 (1976).

Two additional telescopes were added in Phase 2 of the project, along with their radio links to Jodrell Bank. While it was originally proposed that one of the telescopes would be sited at Jodrell Bank and the other at Darnhall, the pair were finally sited at Pickmere (also known as Tabley) and Darnhall. The two telescopes were the same as that at Knockin. Construction on both telescopes started on 9 April 1979, and was completed by 31 October 1979. The Pickmere telescope was connected into MTRLI for the first time on 20 July 1980, followed by the Darnhall telescope on 16 December 1980. The second phase was formally completed on the 31 December 1981, and had cost £3,142,210.

The longest baseline of MTRLI was 134 km, between Pickmere and Defford. The first map produced by the array was published on 6 November 1980. In the first 2 years of operation (1980–1982), the array was used to observe at frequencies of 408 MHz (with a resolving power of 1 arcsecond), 1666 MHz (0.25 arcsecond) and 5 GHz (0.08 arcsecond).

When the Mark II&#x27;s surface was replaced in 1987, it could be used along with the three E-systems telescopes on the 22 GHz frequency, expanding MTRLI at that frequency. One of the 18 m dishes of the One-Mile Telescope was temporarily used in MTRLI from 1987 until autumn 1990, which greatly improved its resolution.

MTRLI was renamed to MERLIN in the early 1990s, and shortly afterwards the addition of the purpose-built 32 m Cambridge antenna in 1991 increased both the sensitivity and angular resolution of the array. The array also had a new correlator and new, cooled receivers, and some of the microwave links between the telescopes were improved so that the array could observe both hands of polarization.

Since 1996, carousels for the different receivers on each of the E-systems telescopes and the Mark II telescope were installed (the Cambridge telescope already had such a system installed), providing frequency agility. In 1997 and 1998, dual-frequency (5 and 22 GHz) observations were made with the array for the first time.

There are plans to construct a telescope in Ireland that would be added to the array.

==e-MERLIN==
MERLIN used microwave links to send astronomical data back from the remote stations. These links had a limited bandwidth so much of the data was thrown away. In order to increase the sensitivity of the telescope the links were replaced by optical fibre links with a bandwidth of 4 GHz, compared to the original limit of 30 MHz, increasing the sensitivity of the array by a factor of around 30. This vast increase in data meant that the old correlator was no longer able to cope, so a new correlator was constructed which is capable of processing over 200 Gbit/s.

Another major development which is part of the upgrade is frequency flexibility — the ability to alter the observing band of the entire array in a matter of minutes using rotating carousels of receivers. Some telescopes in the array already had this capability, while the rest required the visit of an engineer to change the receiver. When e-MERLIN becomes operational the telescope will be able to switch rapidly between 1.4, 5, 6 and 22 GHz. This is required in order to take advantage of optimum conditions for high frequency observations where atmospheric conditions can severely affect results.

Work started on the e-MERLIN upgrade in May 2004 and it was completed in 2009.

=== STFC&#x27;s Programmatic Review 2007–08 ===

On 6 March 2008 the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) announced that the (e-MERLIN/JIVE) project was at risk because of a £80m shortfall in its budget. This was due to the initial recommendations of the Particle Physics, Astronomy and Nuclear Physics Science Committee (PPAN), that had listed the project as a &quot;lower priority&quot;. Following concerns that PPAN&#x27;s recommendations did not adequately represent the UK&#x27;s astronomical priorities, STFC established a wider consultation review involving various advisory panels to re-priorities the STFC program. The Ground-Based Astronomy Consultation Panel then recommended e-MERLIN should be changed from the lowest band (&quot;lower priority&quot;), to the second highest, adding that &quot;e-Merlin could be a world-leading facility well into the next decade&quot; and &quot;e-Merlin offered dramatic potential to both traditional UK radio astronomy users and importantly to a broader community&quot;.

On 8 July 2008 STFC presented their final version of the programmatic review at a Town
Meeting at the Royal Society stating: &quot;Given the strategic importance of e-MERLIN to the future of UK radio astronomy and to the highly ranked SKA project, we are working with the University of Manchester and other stakeholders to find a viable way in which e-MERLIN operations can be supported in the medium term on a shared cost basis. We have made provision for STFC support of operations to be made available to facilitate such a solution.&quot;

== Scientific results ==
Among many other things, MERLIN has been used to observe:
* Radio-loud galaxies, for example Messier 87.
* Quasars, for example 3C 418.
* Spectral line observations of Hydroxyl (OH) in interstellar gas clouds.
The telescope can also be used for highly precise astrometry. In 1998, MERLIN in conjunction with the Hubble Space Telescope discovered the first Einstein ring. The telescope has also been used in combination with the VLA to carry out a weak lensing analysis.

<text>Ashwin Sood (born 25 September 1967) is an English–born Canadian musician and drummer. He is best known for his musical association with his ex-wife Sarah McLachlan.

Sood was born in the United Kingdom to Indian immigrant parents, and grew up in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He began playing drums at the age of seven.

In 1990, he graduated from California&#x27;s Musicians Institute (Percussion Institute of Technology). He met McLachlan in the early 1990s while he was on tour with Lava Hay. She asked him to play drums on &quot;I Will Not Forget You&quot; on her second album, &quot;Solace&quot;. As well as Lava Hay, he has also played drums and produced songs for Bass is Base and Mae Moore.

On 7 February 1997, Sood and McLachlan were married in Negril, Jamaica. Their first daughter, India Ann Sushil Sood, was born on 6 April 2002; their second daughter Taja was born on 22 June 2007. The family lived in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In September 2008, the couple separated and later divorced.

Sood is the cousin of actor siblings Veena Sood and Manoj Sood.

<doc id="602919" wikidata="Q835153" url="?curid=602919" title="Physical examination">
<text>In a physical examination, medical examination, clinical examination, or medical checkup, a medical practitioner examines a patient for any possible medical signs or symptoms of a medical condition. It generally consists of a series of questions about the patient&#x27;s medical history followed by an examination based on the reported symptoms. Together, the medical history and the physical examination help to determine a diagnosis and devise the treatment plan. These data then become part of the medical record.

== Types ==
=== Routine ===
The &quot;routine physical&quot;, also known as &quot;general medical examination&quot;, &quot;periodic health evaluation&quot;, &quot;annual physical&quot;, &quot;comprehensive medical exam&quot;, &quot;general health check&quot;, &quot;preventive health examination&quot;, &quot;medical check-up&quot;, or simply &quot;medical&quot;, is a physical examination performed on an asymptomatic patient for medical screening purposes. These are normally performed by a pediatrician, family practice physician, a physical therapist, physician assistant, a certified nurse practitioner or other primary care provider. This routine physical exam usually includes the HEENT evaluation. Nursing professionals such as Registered Nurse, Licensed Practical Nurses can develop a baseline assessment to identify normal versus abnormal findings. These are reported to the primary care provider. If necessary, the patient may be sent to a medical specialist for further, more detailed examinations.

The term is generally &quot;not&quot; meant to include visits for the purpose of newborn checks, Pap smears for cervical cancer, or regular visits for people with certain chronic medical disorders (for example, diabetes). The general medical examination generally involves a medical history, a (brief or complete) physical examination and sometimes laboratory tests. Some more advanced tests include ultrasound and mammography.

If done for a group of people the routine physical is a form of screening, as the aim of the examination is to detect early signs of diseases to prevent them.

====Evidence====
Although annual medical examinations are a routine practice in several countries, examinations performed on an asymptomatic patient are poorly supported by scientific evidence in the majority of the population. A Cochrane Collaboration meta-study found that routine annual physicals did not measurably reduce the risk of illness or death, and conversely, could lead to overdiagnosis and over-treatment; however, this article does not conclude that being in regular communication with a doctor is not important, simply that an actual physical examination may not be necessary.

Some notable general health organisations recommend against annual examinations, and propose a frequency adapted to age and previous examination results (risk factors). The specialist American Cancer Society recommends a cancer-related health check-up annually in men and women older than 40, and every three years for those older than 20.

A systematic review of studies until September 2006 concluded that the examination does result in better delivery of some other screening interventions (such as Pap smears, cholesterol screening, and faecal occult blood tests) and less patient worry. Evidence supports several of these individual screening interventions. The effects of annual check-ups on overall costs, patient disability and mortality, disease detection, and intermediate end points such a blood pressure or cholesterol, are inconclusive. A recent study found that the examination is associated with increased participation in cancer screening.

Some employers require a mandatory health checkup before hiring a candidate, even though it is now well known that some of the components of the prophylactic annual visit may actually cause harm. For example, lab tests and exams that are performed on healthy patients (as opposed to people with symptoms or known illnesses) are statistically more likely to be &quot;false positives&quot;—that is, when test results suggest a problem that does not exist. Disadvantages cited include the time and money that could be saved by targeted screening (health economics argument), increased anxiety over health risks (medicalisation), overdiagnosis, wrong diagnosis (for example athletic heart syndrome misdiagnosed as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and harm, or even death, resulting from unnecessary testing to detect or confirm, often non-existent, medical problems or while performing routine procedures as a followup after screening.

The lack of good evidence contrasts with population surveys showing that the general public is fond of these examinations, especially when they are free of charge. Despite guidelines recommending against routine annual examinations, many family physicians perform them. A fee-for-service healthcare system has been suggested to promote this practice. An alternative would be to tailor the screening interval to the age, sex, medical conditions and risk factors of each patient. This means choosing between a wide variety of tests.

====Prevalence====
The routine physical is commonly performed in the United States and Japan, whereas the practice varies among South East Asia and mainland European countries. In Japan it is required by law for regular working employees to have a health check once a year.

====History====
The roots of the periodic medical examination are not entirely clear. They have been referenced as early as 1671. They have also been advocated for since the 1920s. Some authors point to pleads from the 19th and early 20th century for the early detection of diseases like tuberculosis, and periodic school health examinations. The advent of medical insurance and related commercial influences seems to have promoted the examination, whereas this practice has been subject to controversy in the age of evidence-based medicine. Several studies have been performed before current evidence-based recommendation for screening were formulated, limiting the applicability of these studies to current-day practice.

=== Comprehensive ===
Comprehensive physical exams, also known as executive physicals, typically include laboratory tests, chest x-rays, pulmonary function testing, audiograms, full body CAT scanning, EKGs, heart stress tests, vascular age tests, urinalysis, and mammograms or prostate exams depending on gender.

===Pre-employment===
&quot;Pre-employment examinations&quot; are screening tests which judge the suitability of a worker for hire based on the results of their physical examination. This is also called &quot;pre-employment medical clearance&quot;. Some employers believe that by only hiring workers whose physical examination results pass certain exclusionary criteria, their employees collectively will have fewer absences due to sickness, fewer workplace injuries, and less occupational disease. A small amount of low-quality evidence in medical research supports this idea. Furthermore, the cost of staff health insurance will be lower. However, certain exams or tests that are requested by employers, such as a baseline low back x-ray, should not be performed, according to the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. Reasons for this include the legality and medical necessity of the test as well as the inability of such testing to predict future problems, the radiation exposure to the worker, and the cost of the exam.

=== Insurance ===
A physical examination may be provided under health insurance cover, required of new insurance customers. This is a part of insurance medicine. In the United States, physicals are also marketed to patients as a one-stop health review, avoiding the inconvenience of attending multiple appointments with different healthcare providers.

== Uses ==
=== Diagnosis ===
Physical examinations are performed in most healthcare encounters. For example, a physical examination is performed when a patient visits complaining of flu-like symptoms. These diagnostic examinations usually focus on the patient&#x27;s chief complaint.

=== Screening ===
General health checks, including physical examinations performed when the patient reported no health concerns, often include medical screening for common conditions, such as high blood pressure. A Cochrane review found that general health checks did not reduce the risk of death from cancer, heart disease, or any other cause, and could not be proved to affect the patient&#x27;s likelihood of being admitted to the hospital, becoming disabled, missing work, or needing additional office visits. The study found no effect on the risk of illness, but did find evidence suggesting that patients subject to routine physicals were diagnosed with hypertension and other chronic conditions at a higher rate than those who were not. Its authors noted that studies often failed to consider or report possible harmful outcomes (such as unwarranted anxiety or unnecessary follow-up procedures), and concluded that routine health checks were &quot;unlikely to be beneficial&quot; in regards to lowering cardiovascular and cancer morbidity and mortality.

=== Doctor-patient relations ===

Physical examination has been described as a ritual that plays a significant role in the doctor-patient relationship that will provide benefits in other medical encounters. When a physical exam is expected by the patient but is not performed by the provider, patients may express concern for the lack of depth of investigation into their illness, the validity of treatment plans and exclusions, and the doctor-patient relationship.

===Other uses===
By extension, the term &quot;health check&quot; is also used for routing checks on the working of equipment or business operations or solvency.

== Format and interpretation ==

A physical examination may include checking vital signs, including temperature examination, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate. The healthcare provider uses the senses of sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis). Taste has been made redundant by the availability of modern lab tests. Four actions are taught as the basis of physical examination: inspection, palpation (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and auscultation (listen).

===Scope===
Although providers have varying approaches as to the sequence of body parts, a systematic examination generally starts at the head and finishes at the extremities and includes evaluation of general patient appearance and specific organ systems. After the main organ systems have been investigated by inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation, specific tests may follow (such as a neurological investigation, orthopedic examination) or specific tests when a particular disease is suspected (e.g. eliciting Trousseau&#x27;s sign in hypocalcemia).

While the format of examination as listed below is largely as taught and expected of students, a specialist will focus on their particular field and the nature of the problem described by the patient. Hence a cardiologist will not in routine practice undertake neurological parts of the examination other than noting that the patient is able to use all four limbs on entering the consultation room and during the consultation become aware of their hearing, eyesight, and speech. Likewise an orthopaedic surgeon will examine the affected joint, but may only briefly check the heart sounds and chest to ensure that there is not likely to be any contraindication to surgery raised by the anaesthetist. A primary care physician will also generally examine the male genitals but may leave the examination of the female genitalia to a gynecologist.

With the clues obtained during the &quot;history&quot; and &quot;physical examination&quot; the healthcare provider can now formulate a differential diagnosis, a list of potential causes of the symptoms. Specific diagnostic tests (or occasionally empirical therapy) generally confirm the cause, or shed light on other, previously overlooked, causes. The physical exam is then recorded in the medical record in a standard layout which facilitates billing and other providers later reading the notes.
While elective physical exams have become more elaborate, in routine use physical exams have become less complete. This has led to editorials in medical journals about the importance of an adequate physical examination. Physicians at Stanford University medical school have introduced a set of 25 key physical examination skills that were felt to be useful.

=== Recording ===
Depending upon the chief complaint, additional sections may be included. For example, hearing may be evaluated with a specific Weber test and Rinne test, or it may be more briefly addressed in a cranial nerve exam. To give another example, a neurological related complaint might be evaluated with a specific test, such as the Romberg maneuver.

==History==
The Old Testament makes provision for persons in the Israelite community with leprosy to be examined by a priest: if the presenting sore was white and appeared to go beyond the depth of the skin, it was to be treated as a ritually defiling condition. A further examination was to take place seven days later.

The medical history and physical examination were supremely important to diagnosis before advanced health technology was developed, and even today, despite advances in medical imaging and molecular medical tests, the history and physical remain indispensable steps in evaluating any patient. Before the 19th century, the history and physical examination were nearly the only diagnostic tools the physician had, which explains why tactile skill and ingenious appreciation in the exam were so highly valued in the definition of what made for a good physician. Even as late as 1890, the world had no radiography or fluoroscopy, only early and limited forms of electrophysiologic testing, and no molecular biology as we know it today. Ever since this peak of the importance of the physical examination, reviewers have warned that clinical practice and medical education need to remain vigilant in appreciating the continuing need for physical examination and effectively teaching the skills to perform it; this call is ongoing, as the 21st-century literature shows.

==Society and culture==
People may request modesty in medical settings when the health care provider examines them.

In many Western societies, a physical exam is required to participate in extracurricular sporting activities. During the physical examination, the doctor will examine the genitals, including the penis and testicles. The doctor may ask the teenager to cough while examining the scrotum. Although this can be embarrassing for an adolescent male, it is necessary to help evaluate the presence of inguinal hernias or tumors.

<doc id="602942" wikidata="Q1413727" url="?curid=602942" title="Vienna School of Fantastic Realism">
<text>The Vienna School of Fantastic Realism () is a group of artists founded in Vienna in 1946. The group&#x27;s name was coined in the 1950s by Johann Muskik, and the first exhibition was in 1959 at the Vienna Belvedere. This Austrian movement has similarities to Surrealism in its use of religious and esoteric symbolism and also the choice of a naturalistic style, countering the prevalence of abstract art movements at the time.

Artists include Ernst Fuchs, Maître Leherb (Helmut Leherb), Arik Brauer, Wolfgang Hutter, Anton Lehmden, and Israeli artist Zeev Kun, all students of Professor Albert Paris Gütersloh at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. Gütersloh&#x27;s emphasis on the techniques of the Old Masters gave the &quot;fantastic realist&quot; painters a grounding in realism, similar to early Flemish artists such as Jan van Eyck.

Some older members of the group, including Rudolf Hausner, Kurt Regschek and Fritz Janschka, emigrated to the US in 1949, where Kurt Regschek helped organize the early exhibitions of the group in 1965. Hausner, Fuchs, Hutter, Brauer and Lehmden were referred to as &quot;The Big Five&quot; who subsequently held exhibitions internationally.

<text>CBC Radio 3 is a Canadian digital radio station operated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which plays a relatively freeform mix of indie rock, indie pop, alternative hip hop, folk, country and electronic music.

The service, which launched in 2005 as a station on Sirius Satellite Radio, evolved out of programming on CBC Radio 2 (now CBC Music), which also simulcasted Radio 3 on Saturday and Sunday nights from December 2005 until March 17, 2007. The station was formerly available online from CBC&#x27;s website and iTunes Radio, but geographical restrictions were in place to prevent access outside of Canada. The French-language equivalent to Radio 3 was Bande à part.

An article on Nerve.com, published in October 2006, called CBC Radio 3 &quot;possibly the world&#x27;s best radio station&quot;.

In October 2022, CBC Radio 3 was dropped from SiriusXM, but remains available as a playlist through CBC Listen.

==Origins==
Operated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Radio 3 had its genesis in a late-1990s proposal to launch a radio network devoted to youth culture, comparable to BBC Radio 1 and Australia&#x27;s Triple J. The network, which would complement CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2, would build on existing CBC Radio programming such as &quot;Night Lines&quot;, &quot;Brave New Waves&quot; and &quot;RealTime&quot;. The original plan was codenamed &quot;Clubhouse&quot; and was developed by Susan Englebert, Robert Ouimet, Anton Leo and C. William Smith. The CBC filed an application with the CRTC to launch the network in 1998, but later asked the CRTC to defer consideration of its application.

Although technically predating the application, one important step in the development of what would become Radio 3 did take place in 1997, when &quot;Nightlines&quot; and &quot;RealTime&quot; were merged into the new program &quot;RadioSonic&quot;, cohosted by former &quot;Nightlines&quot; host David Wisdom and former &quot;RealTime&quot; host Leora Kornfeld.

A slightly different Radio 3 was launched in 2000 as a converged webcasting project based in Vancouver, with its own servers and managed by CBC Radio. The team consisted of Susan Englebert, Robert Ouimet, Dave Tonner, Loc Dao, Rob McLaughlin and other partners. CBC Radio 3 initially launched separate sites 120 Seconds, New Music Canada and Just Concerts through a collaboration between CBC Radio, media design company Dotaku Group, and technology company Internet Edge. Each provided audio, video and Flash content as media-on-demand streaming for site users. 120 Seconds was a directory of user and artist-created video and documentary projects, New Music Canada was composed entirely of user-created and uploaded music by Canadian independent pop, rock, electronic and hip hop musicians, and Just Concerts included exclusive recordings of live performances by independent artists, both regular concert performances and Radio 3 studio sessions. The first musician to create an artist profile on the site was rapper Classified. Roots Music Canada was later added to the trio of websites, and offered songs uploaded by country and folk musicians.

In 2001, Grant Lawrence became the host of &quot;RadioSonic&quot;.

In late 2002, the group, led by Robert Ouimet and Rob McLaughlin, created CBCRadio3.com, a full-screen online magazine which profiled Canadian music, literature and visual arts, accompanied by a set musical playlist which changed with each &quot;issue&quot;. The site also served as a portal to the other content sites. The site was recognized internationally, winning three Webby Awards, including People&#x27;s Voice Award for Best Broadband site, in 2003. The site won over 20 other awards, including the Art Director&#x27;s Club, New York Festival Awards and Communication Arts Awards, as well as being published in several books. By this time, the site was averaging 5.5 million page views per month.

In 2003, &quot;RadioSonic&quot; was integrated into the Radio 3 project, and was renamed &quot;CBC Radio 3&quot; to reflect the change. With new host Alexis Mazurin, the program featured music and performances from the Radio 3 website.

On June 2, 2005, Radio 3 also launched a weekly podcast, hosted by Grant Lawrence. The hour-long podcast, which has also aired as a program on the satellite radio network, has ranked as the most downloaded Canadian podcast on the Internet, with an estimated 125,000 weekly listeners in 2006.

==Satellite radio==
Satellite radio was approved in Canada by the CRTC on June 18, 2005. Over the next several months, Radio 3 was relaunched as a channel on Sirius Satellite Radio. The main CBC Radio 3 site was shut down for part of 2005 to facilitate the relaunch, although the podcast, the media-on-demand subsites and the Saturday night Radio Two program remained active.

The satellite radio service launched on December 3, 2005, at which time the weekend program on CBC Radio 2 became a live simulcast of the satellite radio service. The main CBC Radio 3 website was relaunched a few days earlier, now featuring a collaborative music blog and an Icecast stream of Canadian music.

The network&#x27;s primary studio is located in the CBC Regional Broadcast Centre in Vancouver, although guest hosts typically hosted from an alternate CBC studio in their home city. Mazurin, the original host of CBC Radio 3 in its radio show format, died in October 2005, and the main Vancouver studio was named the Alexis Mazurin Studio in his memory.

In August 2006, Radio 3 launched its own weekly chart show, &quot;The R3-30&quot;. Originally hosted by Craig Norris until he left the network to join CBC Radio&#x27;s new outlet for Kitchener-Waterloo, CBLA-FM-2, in 2013, the program was then taken over by Lana Gay.

On December 25, 2006, CBC Radio 3 held its first annual &quot;Bucky Awards&quot;. The Bucky Awards were an awards celebration to promote independent Canadian music, and fans voted on the winners in each category.

The station aired on Sirius 94 from its launch until June 24, 2008, when it moved to Sirius 86 as part of a major realignment of the Sirius lineup. On May 4, 2011, the channel was again moved as part of a reorganization of Sirius&#x27; channel lineup to channel 152. On May 9, 2013 the channel was moved to channel 162 and was also launched on XM. The channel was removed from SiriusXM effective October 1, 2022.

==&quot;Radio 3&quot; leaves Radio Two==
On January 17, 2007, the CBC announced that as part of a major programming realignment on CBC Radio 2, that network would discontinue its Radio 3 simulcast in March of that year. The final simulcast, which aired on March 17, was a retrospective broadcast which included past interviews with William Shatner and John Lydon, visits from past hosts David Wisdom and Leora Kornfeld, phone interviews with Buck 65, Joel Plaskett, Sara Quin and Jim Bryson, and live in-studio performances by John K. Samson and Christine Fellows, as well as listener requests for classic songs from any era in which &quot;Radio 3&quot; or its predecessors aired.

&quot;The R3-30&quot;, which was usually taped in advance and rebroadcast on Radio Two in a later time slot, also aired live from Vancouver that evening and incorporated listener phone calls into the program&#x27;s usual format.

==Webcast==
From 2005 to 2009, the Icecast stream available from the network&#x27;s website was not a simulcast of the satellite radio broadcast, but was programmed separately. Initially, the webstream consisted exclusively of music with the occasional identification break, but on September 14, 2007 it was relaunched with hosts and feature content, similar to but still programmed separately from the satellite radio station. Due to funding cuts, however, the two services were merged in June 2009, such that the webstream is now a straight simulcast of the satellite radio channel.

Prior to the merger, the two services had slightly different programming strategies – the satellite radio station aired a music mix of 85 per cent Canadian and 15 per cent international, while the web service&#x27;s mix was 100 per cent Canadian. With the merger of the two services, the station announced that the program mix would be 100 per cent Canadian music on both platforms, although exceptions will be permitted for international music with some Canadian character – such as international artists covering Canadian songs, collaborations between Canadian and non-Canadian artists, international artists appearing on the bill with Canadian artists when the network is airing a live concert, or &quot; Canadian&quot; artists such as Neko Case and Rose Melberg.

In February 2009, CBC Radio 3 participated with &quot;Exclaim!&quot; and aux.tv to launch X3, a new collaborative cross-promotional platform which sees all three outlets air feature content spotlighting a particular &quot;Artist of the Month&quot;. X3 artists of the month have included K&#x27;naan, Malajube, Thunderheist, Japandroids, Apostle of Hustle, The Rural Alberta Advantage, Owen Pallett, and Jenn Grant.

In addition to the service&#x27;s conventional radio programming, any song in the network&#x27;s music library was able to be streamed on demand from the artist&#x27;s profile page on the site. In May 2011, Joel Plaskett became the first artist in the network&#x27;s history to reach one million on-demand plays.

In 2012, CBC Radio 3 was integrated into the new CBC Music service.

==Podcast==
Unlike Bande à part, which produced a number of special short run podcasts in addition to its regular weekly music podcast, Radio 3 only produced its main music podcast through 2006.

As a result of the Radio Two schedule changes, on February 26, 2007 CBC Radio 3 created several new podcasts to complement the original CBC Radio 3 podcast, including a daily &quot;New Music Canada Track of the Day&quot; and an hour-long weekly &quot;R3-30&quot; podcast.

As well, the network also launched a new internet streaming program titled &quot;CBC Radio 3 Sessions&quot;, which featured live performances by artists at the CBC Radio 3 studio. The &quot;Sessions&quot; also aired as a program on Sirius 86. As of September 12, 2007, the &quot;Sessions&quot; program also appeared in podcast format. &quot;Sessions&quot; concerts have also aired on the CBC&#x27;s cable television service bold.

Notably, all Radio 3 podcasts were available in Ogg (Vorbis), a freely-licensed audio format, in addition to the more conventional mp3 format.

==Video==
On April 20, 2007, as part of CBC Radio 3&#x27;s 100th podcast, a weekly video podcast was introduced. The new video-based podcast, &quot;R3TV&quot;, revolved around the personalities at CBC Radio 3 and featured a particular artist each week, who provided commentary for the podcast and had their music videos featured in the show. &quot;R3TV&quot; was also available as a channel on Internet television services such as Joost, YouTube and Miro Media Player.

In 2011, CBC Radio 3 sponsored its first documentary movie, &quot;Winning America&quot;, about Canadian band Said the Whale. The movie was directed by Brent Hodge and Thomas Buchan, and produced by Jon Siddall, Brent Hodge and Sheila Peacock. It first aired on July 23, 2011 on CBC Television in British Columbia, and then nationally on April 2, 2012.

After the success of the first film, Radio 3 decided to do a second documentary movie called &quot;What Happens Next?&quot; about Canadian musician Dan Mangan. This movie was produced and directed by Brent Hodge and Jon Siddall. It aired on CBC on August 25, 2012 in BC, and then again nationally on October 20, 2012.

Radio 3&#x27;s next foray into video was in 2013, with the web series &quot;The Beetle Roadtrip Sessions&quot;. It followed host Grant Lawrence across Canada visiting various musicians and other personalities along the way, including The Darcys, Hollerado, Sam Roberts, Theo Fleury, Hawksley Workman and others. It was also directed by Brent Hodge. &quot;The Beetle Roadtrip Sessions&quot; won the award for Best Original Program or Series produced for Digital Media – Non-Fiction at the 2nd Canadian Screen Awards.

==Concerts==
As well as the on-air studio sessions, the network also regularly sponsors public concerts in music venues. The network also broadcasts the annual Polaris Music Prize gala.

The Connect the Dots Tour in 2004 featured a different lineup of bands in each city, including p:ano, Ninja High School, The Russian Futurists, Young and Sexy, The Unicorns, The Super Friendz, Lederhosen Lucil, Dragon Fli Empire and controller.controller.

Tour Tournée in the winter of 2006, jointly sponsored by CBC Radio 3 and Bande à part, included bands such as Wintersleep, Two Hours Traffic, Konflit Dramatik, Hexes and Ohs, Great Aunt Ida, Shout Out Out Out Out, Novillero, Les Breastfeeders, SS Cardiacs, Les Dales Hawerchuk, Pony Up! and The Deadly Snakes. Each of the eight locations had a different lineup of predominantly local bands, and at least one francophone band performed at each venue. On October 1, 2006, Radio 3 and Bande à part again jointly sponsored See Vous Play, a show in Toronto featuring Les Breastfeeders, Emily Haines and the Soft Skeleton, Les Trois Accords and The Joel Plaskett Emergency.

Also in October, the network was a sponsor of the Exclaim! Mint Road Show, a cross-Canada tour featuring The New Pornographers, Immaculate Machine and Novillero to celebrate the 15th birthdays of &quot;Exclaim!&quot;, a Canadian music magazine, and Mint Records, a Vancouver independent record label.

CBC Radio 3 was also the sponsor of a nationwide tour in March and April 2007 featuring The Constantines and Jon-Rae and the River. The tour also featured Shotgun &amp; Jaybird for the Eastern Canada portion of the tour while Ladyhawk toured for the Western Canadian portion of the tour.

On April 27, 2007, CBC Radio 3 and Bande à part jointly presented Quebec Scene, an Ottawa concert featuring The Stills, The Besnard Lakes, Karkwa and Mahjor Bidet.

On June 9, 2007, as a part of the annual NXNE festival, CBC Radio 3 presented a concert in Toronto featuring United Steel Workers of Montreal, Ohbijou, Sebastien Grainger et Les Montagnes, You Say Party, In-Flight Safety and Two Hours Traffic.

In 2008, the network sponsored and broadcast several live shows at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, including performances by Basia Bulat, The Constantines, The Most Serene Republic, The Stills, Shout Out Louds, Christine Fellows, Grand Analog and Hot Springs.

The network&#x27;s live broadcast from the 2009 NXNE festival featured Woodpigeon, DD/MM/YYYY, Ruby Coast, Jason Collett, Hot Panda and The Lovely Feathers.

In 2011, they sponsored Victoria&#x27;s Rifflandia Music Festival Side Stage at Royal Athletic Park, featuring Jon Middleton of Jon and Roy, Besnard Lakes, Jakarta, Hollerado, and USS.

==CBC Radio 3 hosts==
As of March 30, 2015, the service no longer features live hosting, although prerecorded feature segments are still heard as interstitials. Grant Lawrence remains an employee of the service, hosting podcasts as well as voicing the prerecorded segments.

Past hosts heard on the network included Lana Gay, Tariq Hussain, Amanda Putz, Craig Norris, Alexis Mazurin, Lauren Burrows, Pete Morey, Lisa Christiansen, Raina Douris, Dave Shumka, Emma Godmere, Vish Khanna and Talia Schlanger. Canadian musicians and other media personalities have also sometimes appeared as guest hosts, including Joel Plaskett, Carolyn Mark, Buck 65, Nirmala Basnayake, Hannah Sung, Brent Bambury, Graham Wright, Alanna Stuart and Nardwuar the Human Serviette. Some personalities associated with the sister service Bande à part also appeared on the network as reporters or correspondents covering Quebec&#x27;s music scene.

== Bucky Awards ==
From 2006 to 2013, CBC Radio 3 presented the annual Bucky Awards, which honour Canadian indie pop and rock music. The awards, determined by listener vote, include such non-traditional categories as &quot;most Canadian tune&quot; and &quot;sexiest musician.&quot; The awards were created after Lawrence made comments on the air criticizing the Juno Awards for overlooking Arcade Fire in their nominations, and a listener suggested in response that Radio 3 should create its own awards.

In 2014, the Bucky Awards were merged into the expanded CBC Music Awards.

==Albums==
Several compilation albums featuring CBC Radio 3 artists and live performances have also been released:

* &quot;New Music Canada, Vol. 1&quot; (2004)
* &quot;CBC Radio 3 Sessions, Vol. 1&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Mint Records Presents the CBC Radio 3 Sessions&quot; (2006)

<text>The Phoenix metropolitan area, also known as the Valley of the Sun, the Salt River Valley, metro Phoenix, or The Valley, is the largest metropolitan statistical area in the Southwestern United States, with its largest principal city being the city of Phoenix. It includes much of central Arizona. The United States Office of Management and Budget designates the area as the Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), defining it as Maricopa and Pinal counties. It anchors the Arizona Sun Corridor megaregion along with the second-most populous metropolitan area in the state, the Tucson metropolitan area. The gross domestic product of the Phoenix metropolitan area was around $400 billion in 2023, 14th highest amongst metro areas in the United States.

As of the 2020 census, the two-county metropolitan area had 4,845,832 residents, making it the 11th largest metropolitan area in the nation by population. Metro Phoenix grew by 652,945 people from April 2010 to April 2020, making it one of the fastest growing metro areas in the country. This also contributed to the entire state&#x27;s exceptional growth; the area is home to just over two-thirds of Arizona&#x27;s population. The population of the Phoenix metropolitan area increased by 45.3% from 1990 through 2000, compared to the overall U.S. rate of 13.2%, helping make Arizona the second-fastest growing state in the nation in the 1990s behind Nevada. The 2000 census reported the population of the metropolitan area to be 3,251,876. Water insecurity and drought in conjunction with climate change have become a significant concern for the metropolitan area&#x27;s future growth prospects.

== Combined Statistical Area ==
The Phoenix–Mesa combined statistical area (CSA) was designated in September 2018 by U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and by the Census Bureau which consists of the entirety of the counties of Maricopa, Pinal, and Gila. This includes the Phoenix metropolitan area and the Payson, AZ micropolitan statistical area.

As of April 1, 2020, the Phoenix–Mesa CSA had a population of 4,899,104, making it the fourteenth-most populous in the nation.

== Metropolitan Statistical Area ==

The Phoenix Metropolitan Area comprises Maricopa County (2020 population: 4,420,568) and Pinal County (2020 population: 425,264). It is officially designated by the US Census Bureau as the Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, AZ Metropolitan Statistical Area. The total population for metropolitan Phoenix at the 2020 Census was 4,845,832.

The Phoenix Metropolitan Area is hundreds of miles away from any other metropolitan area of similar population size. For instance, the closest metropolitan area with almost the same population size is the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, CA Metro Area, which is 300 miles away.
==Demographics==

As of the 2010 census, there were 4,192,887 people, 1,537,137 households, and 1,024,971 families residing within the MSA. The racial makeup of the MSA was 73.0% White (58.7% White Non-Hispanic), 5.0% Black, 3.3% Asian, 2.4% Native American or Alaska Native (virtually all Native American) and 16.2% of other or mixed race. 29.5% were Hispanic of any race.

In 2010 the median income for a household in the MSA was $50,385 and the median income for a family was $58,497. The per capita income was $24,809.
==Communities==
What follows is a list of places in Metro Phoenix (populations for incorporated places are as of the 2020 census). The Office of Management and Budget defines a metropolitan area as the core city plus its county and any nearby counties that are economically dependent on the core city. However, Arizona has relatively large counties and a harsh, rugged desert landscape. For these reasons, much of the land that is part of the Metropolitan Statistical Area is rural or completely uninhabited. The core part of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area is the Phoenix–Mesa, Arizona Urban Area, which is far smaller than the Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Places that fall completely or partially within the boundaries of the Phoenix–Mesa, AZ US are in bold below.

==Geography==
As of 2020, the Phoenix Metropolitan area consists of Maricopa and Pinal counties, comprising a total area of about 14,600 square miles. Because of the size of counties in Arizona, even though Maricopa and Pinal counties together contain nearly 4.9 million people, most of the area is uninhabited, which gives the MSA an extremely low density compared to other major MSAs in the nation.

The average elevation in the city itself is about , with the highest point being in South Mountain Park Preserve .The highest point in the two county area is in the Four Peaks mountain range.

===Climate===
Metropolitan Phoenix is notable for its warm, desert climate. On average, the area receives about 9 inches of rain annually, with less than 1 inch of snow every decade. In total, the region will see about 32 days of measurable precipitation each year. The MSA is one of the sunniest major metropolitan areas, receiving 295 days of sunshine, compared to the national average of 205. The average July high is about 104 °F (40 °C), with the average January low being about 36 °F (3 °C), still above freezing. Bestplaces gives Metropolitan Phoenix a comfort index of 44/100, which is also the national average.

Below is a chart showing climate data collected from Sky Harbor Airport. Due to the vast area covered by the MSA, climates vary throughout the valley.
==Economy==
Metropolitan Phoenix has historically been the center of the state&#x27;s economy. As with the state of Arizona, the area relied on the 5 C&#x27;s (copper, cattle, climate, citrus, and cotton) for its economic growth and expansion. However, after World War II, the area entered the manufacturing industry, which spurred the growth of what would eventually be one of the largest urban areas in the nation. Currently, the two largest industries are manufacturing and tourism. About 10 million people visit from other states and Canada each year, due to the area&#x27;s mild winters and long, sunny days. The technology and service industries currently account for almost 77% of total employment in the region. As well as a strong tourism industry, the Phoenix area has a significant business sector. Several Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies have their international headquarters in the area, including Avnet, PetSmart, Apollo Education Group, Republic Services, ON Semiconductor, Insight Enterprises, and Sprouts Farmers Market. Other Fortune 500 companies with significant presence include Banner Health, the state&#x27;s largest private employer, American Airlines, which merged with Tempe-based US Airways, American Express, Wells Fargo, Boeing, and Intel, which has a large regional campus in Chandler.

The Metropolitan Area ranks 5th in the nation in economic growth, which is a major comeback from the recession. The unemployment rate of the area is 5.3%, lower than the national rate of 6.3%. It also has slightly higher recent job growth (2.0% compared to 1.2%) and higher projected job growth (38.7% compared to 36.1%). Although the area has significantly higher sales tax rates compared with the nation as a whole (8.3% to 6.0%), income tax rates are lower than the national average (3.4% to 4.7%). The largest occupation by population is in the office/administrative sector, comprising more than a quarter of all jobs in the region.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===

==== Freeways and expressways ====
The Phoenix Metropolitan Area is served by several controlled-access freeways, including:
* 
* 
* 
* 

New freeways are planned in the future, either through upgrades of existing roads such as SR 74, SR 85, and Northern Parkway; or through the construction of new freeways where no road existed before such as SR 24, SR 30, and I-11.

==== Arterial roads ====
Most of the arterial roads in the Phoenix metropolitan area are laid out on a regular grid, following the section lines established in the Public Land Survey System. As a result, arterial roads in cities that had once been geographically separate may have been given different names while occupying the same section line. When these roads were extended to accommodate the growth in the area they eventually merged into a single road while the previous segments retained their existing names. This results in several cases of a road abruptly changing names; for example, Dunlap Avenue in Phoenix becomes Olive Avenue west of 43rd Avenue, in Glendale.

Another quirk of a grid system based upon the Public Land Survey System is due to the occasional corrections in the grid caused by the curvature of the Earth. This results in arterial roadways deviating slightly from a straight line, as can be seen in many locations where roads abruptly curve either just north or just south of Baseline Road to follow a new section line.

The majority of the cities in the metropolitan area, as well as unincorporated areas in Maricopa County, observe the addressing system employed by the city of Phoenix. A number of cities, however, retain their own addressing systems with differing reference points, creating the potential for multiple instances of a house number being found on the same named road.

In terms of numbering systems, some roads that continue through multiple cities will switch numbering conventions several times. Broadway Road, for example, starts and stops multiple times, passing through Goodyear, Avondale, Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa, and Apache Junction, each with their own reference point for address numbering. Though the street does not curve, the direction changes from west to east in each city and back again when moving from one city to the next, causing considerable overlap in numbers.

==== Street numbering systems ====

Most communities in Maricopa County use the Phoenix-County numbering system, with the point of origin at Central Avenue and Washington Street. In the Phoenix-County system, north-south numbered roads labeled &quot;avenue&quot;, &quot;drive&quot;, and &quot;lane&quot; are West of Central Avenue, while those labeled &quot;street&quot;, &quot;place&quot; and &quot;way&quot; are east of Central Avenue. Starting with 579th Avenue in the west near Tonopah the avenues count down with approximately 8 numbers per mile to 19th Avenue and count up again to from 16th Street to 228th Street near Queen Creek in the east. They go, in order from west to east (although not all necessarily exist):
* 2nd Avenue – 1st Dale – 1st Glen – 1st Lane – 1st Drive – 1st Avenue
* Central Avenue
* 1st Street – 1st Place – 1st Way – 1st Terrace – 1st Run – 2nd Street

This has been a source of confusion for a few newcomers, who might end up, for example, at 91st &quot;Avenue&quot; and Thunderbird Road, when in fact they intended to go to 91st &quot;Street&quot; and Thunderbird Road, between 30 minutes and an hour away from one another depending on traffic.

One beneficial quality of this arrangement for unfamiliar travelers is that the major north-south arterial roads are rarely similarly named; the &quot;avenue&quot; arterials in the West Valley are all odd-numbered and the &quot;street&quot; arterials in the East Valley are even-numbered, with the exception of 7th Ave. &amp; 7th St., both being major roadways running parallel and each one-half mile from Central Ave.

Communities in Maricopa County that have their own street numbering systems include:

Additional confusion can be encountered in Mesa in its urban core, with east-west numbered avenues and drives counting down from 11th Avenue north towards Main Street), and numbered streets and places counting down from 11th Place south towards Main Street. Then, in the eastern part of the city, north-south streets and places count up from 22nd St east of Gilbert Rd, to 112th Street on the Apache Junction border. Numerous trailer parks inside the city limits run their own contradictory variations of the numbered street system.

Most communities in Pinal County use the Pinal County street numbering system, whose point of origin is at SR 287 and 11 Mile Corner Road (the intersection of which is known as &quot;11 Mile Corner&quot;). Exceptions include:

Apache Junction continues Mesa&#x27;s convention of numbered north-south street names by having the sequence continue east from 112th St while simultaneously having east-west numbered avenues south of Apache Trail and east-west numbered streets north of Apache Trail.

==== Traffic safety ====

In terms of safety, the Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, AZ metropolitan area has been ranked 16th most dangerous in the USA, based on its Pedestrian Danger Index, computed on the share of local commuters who walk to work and the most recent data on pedestrian deaths as found in a 2016 report released by Smart Growth America.

==== Rail ====
Amtrak serves the Phoenix metropolitan area with their &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; and &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; trains—both of which stop in Maricopa, located about 40 miles south of downtown Phoenix. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Stagecoach Express&quot; provides Amtrak Thruway service from Maricopa station to both Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and Tempe station. Amtrak also provides additional Thruway Motorcoach service from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport to Flagstaff station, which is served by the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;.

Amtrak&#x27;s Los Angeles-New Orleans &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; served the city of Phoenix directly from 1971 until it was rerouted on June 2, 1996, to a more southerly route between Tucson and Yuma, Arizona, in order to accommodate the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s desire to abandon a portion of its Phoenix-to-Yuma &quot;West Line.&quot; This made Phoenix one of the largest cities in the nation without direct passenger service.

A light rail system (dubbed the &quot;METRO Light Rail&quot;) runs more than 20 miles from suburban Mesa, through Tempe and into Phoenix, traveling through the downtown area, offering access to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and linking two of the four metro area campuses of Arizona State University. The light rail began public operation on December 27, 2008, and it was projected to accommodate 26,000 boardings a day, or more than 8 million boardings in its first year. Valley Metro Rail boardings has experienced constant growth since the beginning. In the year 2012, the light rail boarded just over 14 million people.

Many expansions to the METRO system are currently in the early planning stages, and others are under construction. The Central Mesa extension project, which extends the Main Street line miles from Sycamore to Mesa Drive in Downtown Mesa, finished construction and opened on August 22, 2015. The Northwest rail project opened March 2016. The project extended the 19th Avenue track from its former terminus at Montebello Ave to Dunlap Avenue, 3 miles north. Many more extensions are funded, with further projects being studied for feasibility.

==== Aviation ====
In 2023, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport was the 33rd busiest passenger facility in the world and the 14th busiest in the United States, with more than 48 million total passengers. With two active terminal buildings encompassing 117 gates, more than 25 airlines offer daily non-stop flights to destinations throughout the world.

Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport began commercial passenger flights in 2004. The airport provides service to over 40 destinations.

There are several municipal and regional airports in the metropolitan area that are not used by commercial airlines for passenger flights. They include, but are not limited to, Glendale Airport, Phoenix Deer Valley Airport, Phoenix Goodyear Airport, Scottsdale Airport, Falcon Field, Chandler Municipal Airport, Buckeye Airport, Phoenix Regional Airport, Pleasant Valley Airport, Estrella Sailport, Stellar Airpark, Skyranch at Carefree, Gila River Memorial Airport, Pegasus Airpark.

<text>Ernst Fuchs (13 February 19309 November 2015) was an Austrian painter, draftsman, printmaker, sculptor, architect, stage designer, composer, poet, and one of the founders of the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism. In 1972, he acquired the derelict Otto Wagner Villa in Hütteldorf, which he restored and transformed. The villa was inaugurated as the Ernst Fuchs Museum in 1988.

==Education==
Born in Vienna as the only child of Maximilian and Leopoldine Fuchs, Fuchs attended the St. Anna Painting School, where he studied under Fritz Fröhlich (1944). He entered the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna (1945), where he began his studies under Professor , later moving to the class of Albert Paris von Gütersloh.

==Career==
At the Academy, he met Arik Brauer, Rudolf Hausner, Helmut Leherb, Fritz Janschka, Wolfgang Hutter, and Anton Lehmden, together with whom he later founded what has become known as the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism. He was also a founding member of the Art-Club (1946), as well as the Hundsgruppe, set up in opposition to it in 1951, together with Friedensreich Hundertwasser and Arnulf Rainer.

Fuchs&#x27; work of this period was influenced by the art of Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele and then by Max Pechstein, Heinrich Campendonk, Edvard Munch, Henry Moore and Pablo Picasso. During this time, seeking to achieve the vivid lighting effects achieved by such Old Masters as Albrecht Altdorfer, Albrecht Dürer, Matthias Grünewald and Martin Schongauer, he revived and adopted the mischtechnik (mixed technique) of painting. In the mischtechnik, egg tempera is used to build up volume, and is then glazed with oil paints mixed with resin, producing a jewel-like effect.

Between 1950 and 1961, Fuchs lived mostly in Paris, and made a number of journeys to the United States and Israel. His favourite reading material at the time was the sermons of Meister Eckhart. He also studied the symbolism of the alchemists and read Jung&#x27;s &quot;Psychology and Alchemy&quot;. His favourite examples at the time were the mannerists, especially Jacques Callot, and he was also very much influenced by Jan van Eyck and Jean Fouquet. In 1958 he founded the Galerie Fuchs-Fischoff in Vienna to promote and support the younger painters of the Fantastic Realism school. Together with Friedensreich Hundertwasser and Arnulf Rainer, he founded the Pintorarium.

When he was 12 years old, he converted to Roman Catholicism (his mother had him baptized during the war in order to save him from being sent to a concentration camp). In 1957, he entered the Dormition Abbey on Mount Zion where he began work on his monumental &quot;Last Supper&quot; and devoted himself to producing small-sized paintings on religious themes such as Moses and the Burning Bush, culminating in a commission to paint three altar paintings on parchment, the cycle of the &quot;Mysteries of the Holy Rosary&quot; (1958–61), for the Rosenkranzkirche in Hetzendorf, Vienna. He also dealt with contemporary issues in his masterpiece of this period, &quot;Psalm 69&quot; (1949–60). (Fuchs, 1978, p. 53).
Fuchs returned to Vienna in 1961 and had a vision of what he called the &quot;verschollener Stil&quot; (Hidden Prime of Styles), the theory of which he set forth in his book &quot;Architectura Caelestis: Die Bilder des verschollenen Stils&quot; (Salzburg, 1966). He also produced several important cycles of prints, such as &quot;Unicorn&quot; (1950–52), &quot;Samson&quot; (1960–64), &quot;Esther&quot; (1964–67) and &quot;Sphinx&quot; (1966–67; all illustrated in Weis). In 1972, he acquired the derelict Otto Wagner Villa in Hütteldorf, which he restored and transformed. The villa was inaugurated as the Ernst Fuchs Museum in 1988.

From 1970 on, Fuchs embarked on numerous sculptural projects such as &quot;Queen Esther&quot; (h. 2.63 m, 1972), located at the entrance to the museum, and also mounted on the radiator cap of the &quot;Cadillac&quot; at the entrance to the Dalí Museum in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain.

==Design projects==
From 1974, he became involved in designing stage sets and costumes for the operas of Mozart and Richard Wagner, including &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, &quot;Parsifal&quot;, and &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. He experimented with industrial design in the 1970s with a 500-piece run of the upscale &quot;Suomi&quot; tableware by Timo Sarpaneva that Fuchs decorated for the German Rosenthal porcelain maker&#x27;s &quot;Studio Linie&quot;.

In 1993, Fuchs was given a retrospective exhibition at the State Russian Museum in St. Petersburg, one of the first Western artists so honored.

==Personal life and death==
Fuchs had 16 children.

He was an Austrian monarchist, His son Emanuel revealed after his death: &quot;My father advocated the reintroduction of the monarchy because he thought it was the better form of government.&quot;

Fuchs died in Vienna&#x27;s Sophienspital at the age of 85 on 9 November 2015.

<text>A bracteate (from the Latin &quot;bractea&quot;, a thin piece of metal) is a flat, thin, single-sided gold medal worn as jewelry that was produced in Northern Europe predominantly during the Migration Period of the Germanic Iron Age (including the Vendel era in Sweden). Bracteate coins are also known from the medieval kingdoms around the Bay of Bengal, such as Harikela and Mon city-states. The term is also used for thin discs, especially in gold, to be sewn onto clothing in the ancient world, as found for example in the ancient Persian Oxus treasure, and also later silver coins produced in central Europe during the Early Middle Ages.

==Gold bracteates from the Migration Period==
Gold bracteates commonly denote a certain type of jewelry, made mainly in the 5th to 7th century AD, represented by numerous gold specimens. Bead-rimmed and fitted with a loop, most were intended to be worn suspended by a string around the neck, supposedly as an amulet. The gold for the bracteates came from coins paid as peace money by the Roman Empire to their Northern Germanic neighbors.

===Motifs===
Many of the bracteates feature ruler portraits of Germanic kings with characteristic hair that is plaited back and depictions of figures from Germanic mythology influenced to varying extents by Roman coinage while others feature entirely new motifs. The motifs are commonly those of Germanic mythology and some are believed to be Germanic pagan icons giving protection or for divination.

Often depicted is a figure with a horse, birds and sometimes a spear – that some scholars interpret as a representation of the Germanic god Wodan – and aspects of the figure that would later appear in 13th century depictions as Odin such as the Poetic Edda. For this reason the bracteates are a target of iconographic studies by scholars interested in Germanic religion. Several bracteates also feature runic alphabet inscriptions (a total of 133 inscriptions on bracteates are known, amounting to more than a third of the entire Elder Futhark corpus). Numerous Bracteates feature swastikas as a common motif.

===Typology===
The typology for bracteates divides them into several letter-named categories, a system introduced in an 1855 treatise by the Danish numismatist Christian Jürgensen Thomsen named &quot;Om Guldbracteaterne og Bracteaternes tidligste Brug som Mynt&quot; and finally defined formally by the Swedish numismatist Oscar Montelius in his 1869 treatise &quot;Från jernåldern&quot;:

*A-bracteates (~92 specimens): showing the face of a human, modelled after antique imperial coins
*B-bracteates (~91 specimens): one to three human figures in standing, sitting or kneeling positions, often accompanied by animals
*C-bracteates (best represented, by ~426 specimens): showing a male&#x27;s head above a quadruped, often interpreted as the Germanic god Woden.
*D-bracteates (~359 specimens): showing one or more highly stylized animals
*E-bracteates (~280 specimens): showing an animal triskele under a circular feature
*F-bracteates (~17 specimens): as a subgroup of the D-bracteates, showing an imaginary animal
*M-&#x27;bracteates&#x27; (~17 specimens): two-sided imitations of Roman imperial medallions

===Corpus===

More than 1,000 Migration Period bracteates of type A-, B-, C-, D-, and F are known in total (Heizmann &amp; Axboe 2011). Of these, 135 (ca. 11%) bear Elder Futhark inscriptions which are often very short; the most notable inscriptions are found on the Seeland-II-C (offering traveling protection to the one who wears it), Vadstena (giving a listing of the Elder Futhark combined with a potential magical inscription) and Tjurkö (featuring an inscription in scaldic verse) bracteates.

To these can be added the ca. 270 E-bracteates (Gaimster 1998), which belong to the Vendel Period and thus are slightly later than the other types. They were produced only on Gotland, and while the earlier bracteates (apart from a few English pieces) all were made from gold, many E-bracteates were made from silver or bronze.

The German historian Karl Hauck, Danish archaeologist Morten Axboe and German runologist Klaus Düwel have worked since the 1960s to create a complete corpus of the early Germanic bracteates from the migration period, complete with large scale photographs and drawings. This has been published in three volumes in German named &quot;Die Goldbrakteaten der Völkerwanderungszeit. Ikonographischer Katalog&quot;. A catalogue supplement is included in Heizmann &amp; Axboe 2011.

==High medieval bracteates==
Silver bracteates (in German &quot;Brakteat&quot;, also called &quot;hollow pennies&quot;: &quot;Hohlpfennige&quot; or &quot;Schüsselpfennige&quot;) are different from the migration period bracteates. They were the predominant regional coinage type minted in German-speaking areas (with the exception of Rhineland, Westphalia and the Middle Rhine region) beginning at around 1130 in Saxony and Thuringia and lasted well into the 14th century. From a currency point of view, bracteates were a typical &quot;regional penny&quot; currency of the time.
Medieval silver bracteates are one-sided, stamped &quot;pfennigs&quot; from thin silver sheet, with a diameter of 22 to 45 mm. The coin image appears in a high relief, while the back remains hollow. The large area left much room for artistic representations. Usual were three denominations, a two-&quot;pfennig&quot; (&quot;Blaffert&quot;) with elaborate image, a one-&quot;pfennig&quot; (&quot;Hohlpfennig&quot;) with coarse image and hollow coins worth half a &quot;pfennig&quot; (&quot;Scherf&quot;).

The bracteates were usually called back regularly, about once or twice a year, and had to be exchanged for new coins (&quot;Renovatio Monetae&quot;). For example, receiving three new coins for four old coins. The withheld 4th coin was called strike money and was often the only tax revenue of the coin mint-master. This system worked like a demurrage: People wouldn&#x27;t hoard their coins, because they lost their value. So, this money was used more as a medium of exchange than for storing value. This increased the velocity of money and stimulated the economy.

This disruption disturbed the business interests of all those who were involved in the then money economy, namely the merchants who dominated in the German city leagues. The city leagues then introduced from 1413 a so-called &quot;Ewiger Pfennig&quot; (&quot;eternal penny&quot;).

The last bracteates were &quot;traveller bracteates&quot;, embossed medallions worn as a pendant, that served as a type of presence mark for pilgrims and were in use until the 17th century.

In some cantons of Switzerland, bracteate-like rappen, heller, and angster were produced during the 18th century.

<text>2 Unlimited are a Belgian-Dutch dance music act, founded by Belgian producers/songwriters Jean-Paul De Coster and Phil Wilde in 1991 in Antwerp, Belgium. From 1991 to 1996, Dutch rapper Ray Slijngaard and Dutch vocalist Anita Doth fronted the act. During these five years, 2 Unlimited enjoyed worldwide mainstream success. They scored a total of sixteen international chart hits, including &quot;Get Ready for This&quot;, &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;No Limit&quot;, and &quot;Tribal Dance&quot;. The act has sold eighteen million records worldwide. Although they enjoyed less mainstream recognition in the United States than in Europe, several of their tracks became popular themes in American sporting series, mainly in the NBA and NHL.

==History==
===Formation===
Jean-Paul De Coster and Phil Wilde met in their hometown of Antwerp, Belgium, and created 2 Unlimited in their studio, initially without any performers or vocalists. Their first collaboration under the name of Bizz Nizz resulted in a single called &quot;Don&#x27;t Miss The Party Line&quot; which entered the top 10 in the UK. The two then decided to continue to work together.

De Coster and Wilde had initially created an instrumental track called &quot;Get Ready for This&quot; in May 1991, but they wanted to try out some rap vocals on it. De Coster recalls:

They were so pleased with the result that they agreed to work with them as a duo, and so 2 Unlimited was born.

===&quot;Get Ready!&quot; (1991–1992)===
2 Unlimited were signed to Byte Records (Belgium) and licensed to many other record labels worldwide, including PWL Continental in the UK, ZYX in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, Scorpio in France, etc. Their first single, &quot;Get Ready for This&quot;, was well received in their home markets, peaking at No. 8 in Belgium, and No. 10 in the Netherlands. It became a No. 2 hit record in both Australia and the UK. The single worked its way up to No. 38 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, three years after its original release.

A follow-up single, &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, followed in January 1992, topping the charts in the Netherlands and performing well in many other markets, reaching No. 2 in the UK. In the United States, it only reached #49 on the Hot 100 but got to No. 5 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart). To capitalize on this success, the album &quot;Get Ready!&quot; was released on 24 February 1992, featuring the first two singles and seven more new tracks, including two ballads. Two further singles were released from the album: &quot;Workaholic&quot; and &quot;The Magic Friend&quot;. In the US, the album received a Gold certification for sales of 500,000 units in 1995.

===&quot;No Limits!&quot; (1993–1994)===
2 Unlimited&#x27;s lead single from their second album, the similarly titled &quot;No Limit&quot;, was released in January 1993. The repetitive nature of the song helped it become their most successful single to date and by far the best remembered by the general public. It topped the charts in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. In Germany, it was certified Platinum for sales of 500,000 units. The track received modest airplay on North American radio stations, reaching the top 25 in the US dance charts. By 1996, worldwide sales had reached 2.3 million units.

&quot;Tribal Dance&quot; was released as a single shortly before the album &quot;No Limits!&quot; hit stores in May 1993. It became a top 5 hit in Austria, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. In Germany, &quot;Tribal Dance&quot; was certified Gold for sales of over 250,000 units. Three further singles were issued from the second album: &quot;Faces&quot;, which was considerably different in pace to previous releases; &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot;; and a re-recorded version of &quot;Let the Beat Control Your Body&quot;. In France, this title was changed to &quot;Let the Bass Control Your Body&quot; to avoid any confusion with the slang word &quot;bite&quot; (meaning &quot;penis&quot;).

2 Unlimited&#x27;s second album proved more successful than their first, entering the top five of album charts in Austria, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. In the UK, the album reached the top of the album chart. By 1996, its total sales had reached three million units, including 592,000 units in the GSA region (Germany, Switzerland, Austria).

Despite the phenomenal success the duo were enjoying in the UK, they were criticised heavily by the music industry, and the British press dubbed them &quot;2 Untalented&quot;.

===&quot;Real Things&quot; (1994–1995)===
In May 1994, the duo&#x27;s tenth single, &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, was released, and it proved that their fans were still interested, as they sent the single to No. 1 in the Netherlands, as well as the top 5 in Belgium, Germany, and Norway.

While the duo&#x27;s third album, &quot;Real Things&quot;, shot to No. 1 in the Netherlands and the UK, it also managed to land in the top 5 in Austria, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. The record was certified Gold in the UK for sales of over 100,000 units.

The second single from &quot;Real Things&quot;, &quot;No One&quot;, despite being a straightforward pop song, didn&#x27;t prevent it from reaching No. 2 in the Netherlands&#x27; sales chart.

In March 1995, while the follow-up single, &quot;Here I Go&quot;, was another top 5 hit in the Netherlands, the band&#x27;s commercial success seemed to be declining elsewhere—the song only made it to the top 20 in Austria, Belgium, and Sweden. The fourth and final single, the ballad &quot;Nothing Like the Rain&quot;, was not as successful and was not released in many territories, including the UK.

===&quot;Hits Unlimited&quot; (1995–1996)===
In October 1995, 2 Unlimited released their first compilation album, &quot;Hits Unlimited&quot;, prompting rumours that they were about to split up. The first single, &quot;Do What&#x27;s Good for Me&quot;, entered the top 5 in Finland, and the top 20 in the Netherlands and the UK. Despite their insistence that they were planning a world tour, in April 1996, shortly after the release of the single &quot;Jump for Joy&quot;, both Slijngaard and Doth decided not to extend their five-year contract and left 2 Unlimited.

It later emerged that after having spent so much time together, they were no longer getting on as well as they once had, and there was disagreement about the future sound of the band. They had asked for more creative input and they also felt that they were not getting a fair share of the huge amount of money being earned by the project. As no agreement was reached, they each went their separate ways before a final single, &quot;Spread Your Love&quot;, was released in June 1996.

===&quot;II&quot; (1998–1999)===
As they still owned the rights to the name 2 Unlimited, De Coster and Wilde recruited two new (again Dutch) singers, Romy van Ooijen (b. 18 November 1971) and Marjon van Iwaarden (b. 18 June 1974), in order to capitalise on previous success. The first single released under the new lineup, &quot;Wanna Get Up&quot;, did well in the Netherlands, reaching No. 10. A remix by Sash!, for UK release, reached No. 38.

The album &quot;II&quot; was released in April 1998. It was not as successful as previous studio albums, nor were the subsequent singles, &quot;Edge of Heaven&quot; and &quot;Never Surrender&quot;. In 1999, both van Ooijen and van Iwaarden left 2 Unlimited.

===Remixes (2000–2006)===
In 2000, Byte Records released the remix singles &quot;No Limit&quot; and &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;. A remix album was to be released that year, but some master tapes were stolen from Byte and taken to Russia, where they were released as a bootleg compilation. Also that year, 2 Unlimited made their first appearance on the Eurodance compilation &quot;Dancemania&quot; series, specifically its &quot;Speed&quot; sub-series, with their song &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, &#x27;B4 Za Beat Mix&#x27;.

In 2001, Byte finally released &quot;Greatest Hits Remixes&quot;, featuring many new remixes. Some of the tracks from the stolen master tapes released in Russia were not included. The album was released solely in Japan. In 2002, &quot;Trance Remixes: Special Edition&quot; was released in Japan, featuring many more new remixes not included in the previous compilation.

In the following years, many &quot;best of&quot; compilations have been released in various territories, often with new remixes. Most notably, ZYX Records released &quot;No Limit 2.3&quot; in 2003 and it was a moderate hit, reaching no. 41 in the German singles chart. It was promoted by a new duo, Débora Remagen and James Giscombe. They were being lined up as a 2 Unlimited &quot;version 3&quot;. They still perform, mainly in Eastern Europe, but are not allowed to use their own voices. This is due to copyright issues.

A new CD and DVD set containing all 2 Unlimited music videos, called &quot;The Complete History&quot;, was released in 2004, along with a single, &quot;Tribal Dance 2.4&quot; (originally released on 12&quot; vinyl in November 2003 as &quot;Tribal Dance 2.3&quot;). 2005 saw the release of &quot;The Refreshed Album&quot; in Mexico, featuring stunning artwork, but the same remixes found on previous remix albums. In 2006, the DVD was re-packaged with a different CD, &quot;Greatest Remix Hits&quot;, and released in Australia. The following years saw this package re-released in Argentina, Denmark, Sweden, Asia, and South Africa.

===Reunions (2009–2012)===
Having both continued to perform their old hits separately in nightclubs and university student unions around the world, the original performers Slijngaard and Doth reunited on 11 April 2009, to perform together for the first time in 13 years at the &quot;I Love the 90s&quot; concert in Hasselt, Belgium. According to a radio interview with Slijngaard, Jean-Paul De Coster did not give permission for the duo to perform under the name 2 Unlimited; however, Phil Wilde attended the gig and provided help with preparing backing tracks.

On 30 April 2009, Slijngaard and Doth performed five songs at the Radio 538 Queen&#x27;s Day concert at Museumplein in Amsterdam. On 8 June, they were awarded &quot;Most Popular Act of the 1990s&quot;, based on the number of weeks in the Dutch Top 40; on 25 September, they performed as a support act for Milk Inc. at the Sportpaleis in Antwerp.

On 29 December 2009, it was announced that the duo would release a new single in 2010, called &quot;In Da Name of Love&quot;, as Ray &amp; Anita. It was released as a CD single in the Netherlands through Spinnin&#x27; Records on 22 January 2010. It reached No. 6 on the Dutch Top 40 sales chart. On 30 April 2010, a new single was presented during the Dutch Queen&#x27;s Day, called &quot;Still Unlimited&quot;.

In July 2011, Ray &amp; Anita invited fans to be part of the video for &quot;Nothing 2 Lose&quot; in Amsterdam. Fans applied via email and were selected randomly. The video with the fans was shot on 28 July. The single was released at the end of August 2011. The single is also the lead track for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Amsterdam Heavy&quot;. In the same month, Ray &amp; Anita headlined the &quot;I Love the 90&#x27;s&quot; stage at Tomorrowland in Belgium.

===Comeback (2012–2016)===

On 11 July 2012, it was announced that Ray &amp; Anita would be working again with Belgian producer De Coster under the name 2 Unlimited.

On 30 March 2013, Slijngaard and Doth performed their first full concert as 2 Unlimited with their band in Belgium at Antwerps Sportpaleis.

The duo released a remixed version of their very first single, &quot;Get Ready for This&quot;, on 28 October 2013. The song was remixed by DJ Steve Aoki and was included on their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album.

In 2014, 2 Unlimited gave concerts at ten festivals that together made up Acceleration 2014, which combined top class car and bike racing with music and entertainment.

On 20 April 2016, 2 Unlimited announced that Doth was leaving the band at the end of 2016 to embark on a solo career. Doth was to be replaced by another singer, whose identity was not revealed right away.

===Introduction of Kim (2016–present)===
On 13 August 2016, Kim Vergouwen was revealed as Doth&#x27;s replacement via Slijngaard&#x27;s Facebook page.

On 9 August 2020, 2 Unlimited performed at the third annual Dance Music Festival in Kielce, Poland.

<text>Walter Jeremiah Sanders III (born September 12, 1936) is an American businessman and engineer who was a co-founder and long-time CEO of the American semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), serving in the position from 1969 to 2002.

== Early life and education ==
Jerry Sanders III grew up in the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, raised by his paternal grandparents. He was once attacked and beaten by a street gang leaving him so covered in blood that a priest was called to administer the last rites. He attended the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign on an academic scholarship from the Pullman railroad car company. He graduated from there with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1958.

After graduation, Sanders worked for the Douglas Aircraft Company. He subsequently moved to Motorola, then to Fairchild Semiconductor.

== Business career ==
=== 1961–1969: Fairchild Semiconductor ===
Jerry Sanders joined Fairchild Semiconductor in 1961 as a young engineer. At Fairchild, Sanders quickly rose from lower sales positions up to a succession of management positions in marketing, making him a likely candidate for one of the company&#x27;s top vice presidencies. However, in 1968, a new management team was brought into Fairchild Semiconductor by Sherman Fairchild, led by C. Lester Hogan, then vice president of Motorola Semiconductor. The staff from Motorola, also known as &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, were conservative and hence immediately clashed with Sanders&#x27; boisterous style. Sanders&#x27; flamboyant personality and style made the new management at Fairchild Semiconductor feel uneasy so they fired him. Sanders said that, on his firing from Fairchild, &quot;My whole life has been about treating people fairly, and I wasn&#x27;t treated fairly&quot;.

=== 1969–2004: Advanced Micro Devices ===
In 1969, eight engineers left Fairchild Semiconductor together to start a new company, founding Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in Sunnyvale, California, in May 1969. They asked Jerry Sanders to join them, and he said he would, provided he became the president of the company. Although it caused some dissension within the group, they agreed, and the company was founded with Sanders as president. Every employee at the company got stock options, an innovation at the time.

Sanders gave the company a strong sales and marketing orientation so that it was successful even though it was often behind its competitors in technology and manufacturing; Stacy Rasgo, a semiconductor analyst at Bernstein Research, called Sanders &quot;one of the best salesmen that Silicon Valley had ever seen&quot;. He shared the success of the company with the employees, usually coincident with sales-oriented growth targets.

Sanders at AMD famously remarked that in the semiconductor industry &quot;real men have fabs&quot;. Originally intended as a jibe against competitors, Sanders’s remarks have been largely disproven in the years since. From 1969 to 2009, AMD fabricated its own processors but it later sold off its foundry division as GlobalFoundries in 2009. AMD is now fabless and outsources its fabrication to GlobalFoundries and TSMC.

He steered the company through hard times as well. In 1974, a particularly bad recession almost broke the company. Through a period of stagflation in 1979, he refused to lay off AMD employees and instead took a leaf from the Japanese rather than engaging in the same rampant layoffs that had occurred at Fairchild earlier. Instead of reducing employees, he asked them to work Saturdays to get more done and get new products out sooner. There were also good times for the company. Sanders gave each one of his employees $100 as they walked out of the door during AMD&#x27;s first $1 million quarter. AMD implemented a cash profit-sharing employee compensation program, where employees would regularly get profit checks of $1,000 or more.

In 1976, Intel needed a second source to produce its 8085 processor for IBM PCs so it turned to AMD. In 1982, Sanders was responsible for a renegotiated licensing deal that would enable AMD to copy Intel&#x27;s processor microcode to make its own x86 processors, a deal that eventually made the company the only real competitor to Intel. The open-ended legal language of the deal was used by Sanders to lead efforts for AMD to reverse-engineer and clone Intel&#x27;s 8086 processor. Intel successfully countersued AMD which caused AMD&#x27;s stock to collapse and nearly killed the company.

In 2000, Sanders recruited Héctor Ruiz, at the time the president of Motorola&#x27;s Semiconductor Products Sector, to serve as AMD&#x27;s president and CEO, and to become the heir apparent to lead the company upon Sanders&#x27; retirement. He stayed with the company as chairman after Ruiz succeeded him as CEO in 2002. Sanders stepped down as AMD chair in April 2004 after 35 years at the company.

<text>Food processing is the transformation of agricultural products into food, or of one form of food into other forms. Food processing takes many forms, from grinding grain into raw flour, home cooking, and complex industrial methods used in the making of convenience foods. Some food processing methods play important roles in reducing food waste and improving food preservation, thus reducing the total environmental impact of agriculture and improving food security.

The Nova classification groups food according to different food processing techniques.

Primary food processing is necessary to make most foods edible while secondary food processing turns ingredients into familiar foods, such as bread. Tertiary food processing results in ultra-processed foods and has been widely criticized for promoting overnutrition and obesity, containing too much sugar and salt, too little fiber, and otherwise being unhealthful in respect to dietary needs of humans and farm animals.

==Processing levels==

=== Primary food processing ===
Primary food processing turns agricultural products, such as raw wheat kernels or livestock, into something that can eventually be eaten. This category includes ingredients that are produced by ancient processes such as drying, threshing, winnowing and milling grain, shelling nuts, and butchering animals for meat. It also includes deboning and cutting meat, freezing and smoking fish and meat, extracting and filtering oils, canning food, preserving food through food irradiation, and candling eggs, as well as homogenizing and pasteurizing milk.

Contamination and spoilage problems in primary food processing can lead to significant public health threats, as the resulting foods are used so widely. However, many forms of processing contribute to improved food safety and longer shelf life before the food spoils. Commercial food processing uses control systems such as hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to reduce the risk of harm.

=== Secondary food processing ===
Secondary food processing is the everyday process of creating food from ingredients that are ready to use. Baking bread, regardless of whether it is made at home, in a small bakery, or in a large factory, is an example of secondary food processing. Fermenting fish and making wine, beer, and other alcoholic products are traditional forms of secondary food processing. Sausages are a common form of secondary processed meat, formed by comminution (grinding) of meat that has already undergone primary processing. Most of the secondary food processing methods known to humankind are commonly described as cooking methods.

=== Tertiary food processing ===
Tertiary food processing is the commercial production of what is commonly called &quot;processed food&quot;. These are ready-to-eat or heat-and-serve foods, such as frozen meals and re-heated airline meals.

==History==
Food processing dates back to the prehistoric ages when crude processing incorporated fermenting, sun drying, preserving with salt, and various types of cooking (such as roasting, smoking, steaming, and oven baking), Such basic food processing involved chemical enzymatic changes to the basic structure of food in its natural form, as well served to build a barrier against surface microbial activity that caused rapid decay. Salt-preservation was especially common for foods that constituted warrior and sailors&#x27; diets until the introduction of canning methods. Evidence for the existence of these methods can be found in the writings of the ancient Greek, Chaldean, Egyptian and Roman civilizations as well as archaeological evidence from Europe, North and South America and Asia. These tried and tested processing techniques remained essentially the same until the advent of the Industrial Revolution. Examples of ready-meals also date back to before the preindustrial revolution, and include dishes such as Cornish pasty and Haggis. Both during ancient times and today in modern society these are considered processed foods.
Modern food processing technology developed in the 19th and 20th centuries was developed in a large part to serve military needs. In 1809, Nicolas Appert invented a hermetic bottling technique that would preserve food for French troops which ultimately contributed to the development of tinning, and subsequently canning by Peter Durand in 1810. Although initially expensive and somewhat hazardous due to the lead used in cans, canned goods would later become a staple around the world. Pasteurization, discovered by Louis Pasteur in 1864, improved the quality and safety of preserved foods and introduced the wine, beer, and milk preservation.
In the 20th century, World War II, the space race and the rising consumer society in developed countries contributed to the growth of food processing with such advances as spray drying, evaporation, juice concentrates, freeze drying and the introduction of artificial sweeteners, colouring agents, and such preservatives as sodium benzoate. In the late 20th century, products such as dried instant soups, reconstituted fruits and juices, and self cooking meals such as MRE food ration were developed. By the 20th century, automatic appliances like microwave oven, blender, and rotimatic paved way for convenience cooking.

In western Europe and North America, the second half of the 20th century witnessed a rise in the pursuit of convenience. Food processing companies marketed their products especially towards middle-class working wives and mothers. Frozen foods (often credited to Clarence Birdseye) found their success in sales of juice concentrates and &quot;TV dinners&quot;. Processors utilised the perceived value of time to appeal to the postwar population, and this same appeal contributes to the success of convenience foods today.

Also in the late 20th century, food manufacturers began changing their product model from a single &quot;platonic dish&quot;, such as one version of jarred spaghetti sauce, to offering multiple variations, such as a plain version, a spicy version, and a chunky version.

==Benefits and drawbacks==

===Benefits===
Benefits of food processing include toxin removal, preservation, easing marketing and distribution tasks, and increasing food consistency. In addition, it increases yearly availability of many foods, enables transportation of delicate perishable foods across long distances and makes many kinds of foods safe to eat by de-activating spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms. Modern supermarkets would not exist without modern food processing techniques, and long voyages would not be possible.

Processed foods are usually less susceptible to early spoilage than fresh foods and are better suited for long-distance transportation from the source to the consumer. When they were first introduced, some processed foods helped to alleviate food shortages and improved the overall nutrition of populations as it made many new foods available to the masses.

Processing can also reduce the incidence of food-borne disease. Fresh materials, such as fresh produce and raw meats, are more likely to harbour pathogenic micro-organisms (e.g. Salmonella) capable of causing serious illnesses.

The extremely varied modern diet is only truly possible on a wide scale because of food processing. Transportation of more exotic foods, as well as the elimination of much hard labor gives the modern eater easy access to a wide variety of food unimaginable to their ancestors.

The act of processing can often improve the taste of food significantly.

Mass production of food is much cheaper overall than individual production of meals from raw ingredients. Therefore, a large profit potential exists for the manufacturers and suppliers of processed food products. Individuals may see a benefit in convenience, but rarely see any direct financial cost benefit in using processed food as compared to home preparation.

Processed food freed people from the large amount of time involved in preparing and cooking &quot;natural&quot; unprocessed foods. The increase in free time allows people much more choice in life style than previously allowed. In many families the adults are working away from home and therefore there is little time for the preparation of food based on fresh ingredients. The food industry offers products that fulfill many different needs: e.g. fully prepared ready meals that can be heated up in the microwave oven within a few minutes.

Modern food processing also improves the quality of life for people with allergies, diabetics, and other people who cannot consume some common food elements. Food processing can also add extra nutrients such as vitamins.

===Drawbacks===
Processing of food can decrease its nutritional density. The amount of nutrients lost depends on the food and processing method. For example, heat destroys vitamin C. Therefore, canned fruits possess less vitamin C than their fresh alternatives. The USDA conducted a study of nutrient retention in 2004, creating a table of foods, levels of preparation, and nutrition.

New research highlighting the importance to human health of a rich microbial environment in the intestine indicates that abundant food processing (not fermentation of foods) endangers that environment.

== Added sodium ==
One of the main sources for sodium in the diet is processed foods. Sodium, mostly in the form of sodium chloride, i.e. salt, is added to prevent spoilage, add flavor and enhance the texture of these foods. Americans consume an average of 3436 milligrams of sodium per day, which is higher than the recommended limit of 2300 milligrams per day for healthy people, and more than twice the limit of 1500 milligrams per day for those at increased risk for heart disease.

== Added sugars ==
While it is not necessary to limit the sugars found naturally in whole, unprocessed foods like fresh fruit, eating too much added sugar found in many processed foods increases the risk of heart disease, obesity, cavities and Type 2 diabetes. The American Heart Association recommends women limit added sugars to no more than , or 25 grams, and men limit added sugars to no more than , or about 38.75 grams, per day. Currently, Americans consume an average of from added sugars each day.

== Nutrient losses ==
Processing foods often involves nutrient losses, which can make it harder to meet the body&#x27;s needs if these nutrients are not added back through fortification or enrichment. For example, using high heat during processing can cause vitamin C losses. Another example is refined grains, which have less fiber, vitamins and minerals than whole grains. Eating refined grains, such as those found in many processed foods, instead of whole grains may increase the risk for high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity, according to a study published in &quot;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&quot; in December 2007.

== Trans fats ==
Foods that have undergone processing, including some commercial baked goods, desserts, margarine, frozen pizza, microwave popcorn and coffee creamers, sometimes contain trans fats. This is the most unhealthy type of fat, and may increase risk for high cholesterol, heart disease and stroke. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends keeping trans fat intake as low as possible.

== Other potential disadvantages ==
Processed foods may actually take less energy to digest than whole foods, according to a study published in &quot;Food &amp; Nutrition Research&quot; in 2010, meaning more of their food energy content is retained within the body. Processed foods also tend to be more allergenic than whole foods, according to a June 2004 &quot;Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology&quot; article. Although the preservatives and other food additives used in many processed foods are generally recognized as safe, a few may cause problems for some individuals, including sulfites, artificial sweeteners, artificial colors and flavors, sodium nitrate, BHA and BHT, olestra, caffeine and monosodium glutamate — a flavor enhancer.

==Performance parameters for food processing==

When designing processes for the food industry the following performance parameters may be taken into account:
* Hygiene, e.g. measured by number of micro-organisms per mL of finished product. 
* Energy efficiency measured e.g. by &quot;ton of steam per ton of sugar produced&quot;.
* Minimization of waste, measured e.g. by &quot;percentage of peeling loss during the peeling of potatoes&quot;.
* Labour used, measured e.g. by &quot;number of working hours per ton of finished product&quot;.
* Minimization of cleaning stops measured e.g. by &quot;number of hours between cleaning stops&quot;.

<text>CBC Music (formerly known as CBC FM, CBC Stereo and CBC Radio 2) is a Canadian FM radio network operated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It used to concentrate on classical and jazz. In 2007 and 2008, the network transitioned towards a new &quot;adult music&quot; format with a variety of genres, with the classical genre generally restricted to midday hours. In 2009, Radio 2 averaged 2.1 million listeners weekly; it was the second-largest radio network in Canada.

==History==
The CBC&#x27;s FM network was launched in 1946, but was strictly a simulcast of the AM radio network until 1960. In that year, distinct programming on the FM network began. It was briefly discontinued in 1962, but resumed again in 1964.

In November 1971, the CBC filed license applications for new FM stations in English in St. John&#x27;s, Halifax, and Calgary; and in French in Quebec City, Ottawa, and Chicoutimi, telling the CRTC that it intended to start a second &quot;more extended and more leisurely&quot; program service on its FM stations, tentatively to be called &quot;Radio Two&quot;.

On November 3, 1975, the FM network was renamed CBC Stereo; this was to distinguish it from the AM network, known as CBC Radio.

In the early 1990s, the CBC began offering selected programs on the Internet, most notably CBC Stereo&#x27;s &quot;RealTime&quot;. In September 1996, the corporation formally launched live audio streaming of both CBC Radio and CBC Stereo.

Since the 1980s, many of the AM CBC Radio stations moved to FM due to the limitations of AM broadcasting; as such, in 1997 the CBC renamed the networks CBC Radio One and CBC Radio Two. As of 2018, there are a number of CBC Radio One low-power transmitters with only a few high-powered ones left still operating on the AM band in some areas across Canada.

For much of its history, its programming focused on arts and culture, and primarily consisted of programs devoted to opera, classical music, jazz and theatre. Some programming devoted to Canadian pop and indie rock music was also aired, via the Saturday night CBC Radio 3 simulcast and predecessors such as &quot;RadioSonic&quot;, &quot;Night Lines&quot;, and the late-night programme &quot;Brave New Waves&quot;.

=== 2007 format change===
In 2006, speculation arose that Radio Two programming would undergo a format and name change, similar to that which its French counterpart Espace musique undertook in 2004; however, no plans were announced until January 2007. These changes, which took effect March 19, resulted in a tighter focus on music – still primarily classical but also including jazz, world music, and live music of all types. The length and frequency of newscasts, which had essentially duplicated those heard on Radio One, was reduced dramatically. The 2007 revamp also resulted in a subtle name change from Radio Two to Radio 2.

In March 2008, the CBC announced plans to complete the transformation of Radio 2, significantly altering its daytime programming lineup. These plans resulted in the &quot;New Radio 2&quot;, starting September 2, 2008. In essence, the morning and afternoon drive programs, which had focused almost exclusively on classical music, were replaced with new shows featuring a wider range of genres. The goal, according to the CBC, was to increase exposure of musicians and genres, other than classical and jazz, which received little airtime on private radio. 

Concomitantly, four web radio streams – all-classical, jazz, singer-songwriter, and &quot;Canadian composer&quot; – were introduced.

On June 10, the CBC announced that hosts associated with the new programming would include Julie Nesrallah, Molly Johnson and Rich Terfry.

==== Reception ====

There was a vocal, negative response to these changes from a variety of sources connected with the community ranging from Facebook to blogs to newspaper columnists. National protests were also held at CBC facilities across the country. However, the move drew support from other corners of the cultural community, noting in many cases the low ratings of the existing service. Among the supporters were several critically acclaimed artists who would benefit from the changes.

While critics, particularly &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; columnist Russell Smith, raised the spectre of the network airing mainstream pop artists such as Nelly Furtado and The Black Eyed Peas, the network&#x27;s popular music component consists almost exclusively of artists who would be classified as adult album alternative, folk, world music or singer-songwriter pop – and very few of whom receive any airplay whatsoever on commercial radio. For instance, on one representative day in 2009, &quot;Radio 2 Morning&quot;&#x27;s &quot;pop&quot; playlist included Feist, John Mayer, Blue Rodeo, Sloan, Neil Young, Whiskeytown, Spirit of the West, Sharon Jones &amp; The Dap-Kings, Joni Mitchell, Matthew Barber, Eleni Mandell, Skydiggers, Billy Bragg, Jeremy Fisher, Jim Bryson, The Be Good Tanyas, The Duhks, Sarah Slean, Stephen Fearing, Melissa McClelland, Cowboy Junkies, Howie Beck and the Band.

On May 2, 2008, the president of the CBC and the director of programming attended a meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee for Canadian Heritage. There appeared to be opposition to the movement away from classical music on Radio 2 from MPs of all three main parties represented on the committee. Committee members Bill Siksay and Ed Fast were particularly opposed to the programming changes. The committee voted unanimously to hold further hearings specifically on the CBC Radio 2 changes in September 2008.

Despite the controversy, the format change was successful for the network, which maintained a consistent overall audience while lowering the average age of its listenership from 65 to 52 in January 2010.

=== 2010s ===

On February 6, 2018, the CBC announced that Radio 2 would be rebranded as CBC Music, aligning with the branding of the corporation&#x27;s music website and digital audio service (discussed below).

=== 2020s ===

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, the service temporarily shifted to a playlist of exclusively Canadian music, to help support Canadian musicians impacted by the cancellations of their concert tours.

==Distribution==
The network is not as widely available across Canada as Radio One. While Radio One is available in most communities across Canada regardless of size, CBC Music for the most part is available only in larger cities. Only 14 transmitters across Canada are licensed as originating stations within the network, compared to over 30 for Radio One, although some additional cities are also served by rebroadcasters of one of the originating stations. The service is provided in some form to virtually all of Canada&#x27;s major cities and all provincial capitals. CBC Music also has a more consistent national schedule than Radio One; currently the originating stations produce only limited regional programming, such as weather updates. In the past these stations would also air local news summaries or a daily calendar of local arts and culture events; this was dropped in 2007. CBH-FM in Halifax produces an additional regional music program for the Atlantic Canada region, due to a scheduling hole caused by the time zone difference.

In some smaller communities, especially in rural northern British Columbia, community groups have been licensed to rebroadcast a CBC Music station on a local low-power radio transmitter. These transmitters are owned by the community group rather than the network; the station so not have any original programming at all.

On satellite, the network&#x27;s programming can also be heard on Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct. Unlike Radio One and Radio 3, CBC Music is not carried by SiriusXM Satellite Radio; the CRTC requires that a &quot;Canadian&quot; channel (for the purposes of Sirius Canada, which carried CBC programming prior to its merger with XM Radio Canada) must carry 85% Canadian musical content, a requirement that has not been imposed on (or met by) the terrestrial network. Even so, a handful of programs that did meet this criterion, such as &quot;Deep Roots&quot;, have aired on Radio One&#x27;s Sirius XM feed (channel 169); for a period in the mid-2010s, CBC Music also programmed a separate service for SiriusXM, CBC Music Sonica, which was devoted exclusively to Canadian music. This channel was later discontinued.

CBC Music is also available via the internet in webradio and podcast form. Between October 2013 and September 2016, access to the network&#x27;s domestic internet streams was blocked for listeners outside Canada. The CBC stated that they were not allowed to broadcast advertising outside of Canada. Two ad-free streams – Eastern International and Pacific International – were made available for international users. On these streams, commercials were replaced with CBC promos and other filler content. After the CRTC ordered the CBC to stop broadcasting ads on the network in 2016, international users have regained access to all five domestic streams.

===Stations===
Only stations which are licensed as &quot;originating stations&quot; within the network are listed here. Some stations also have rebroadcasters in smaller outlying markets; these are listed in each station&#x27;s separate article.

===Former affiliates===
* Kentville, Nova Scotia - CKWM-FM - disaffiliated in 1988.
* London, Ontario - CFPL-FM - disaffiliated in 1972.
* Red Deer, Alberta - CKRD-FM - disaffiliated in 1981.

===Website===
On February 13, 2012, the CBC launched CBC Music as an internet radio platform, featuring the existing CBC Radio services and 47 dedicated channels devoted to particular genres of music. The service is distributed via the CBC Music website, and accompanying mobile apps, initially launched for Android, iOS, and BlackBerry OS. Some of the genre webstreams were already provided by Radio 2 or Radio 3, while others were new offerings at the 2012 launch; over time, however, the names and formats of the genre streams have evolved significantly, with some of the original streams having been discontinued in favour of new ones, reformatted to alter their genre focus, or renamed to align their branding with the network&#x27;s programming.

The service was launched shortly after the CBC reached a music licensing deal with the Audio-Video Licensing Agency in January 2012. The site was one of the first large-scale ventures into online broadcasting to be available in Canada since the launch of Iceberg Radio in 1997; at the time of CBC Music&#x27;s launch, popular international ventures such as Pandora or Spotify remained unavailable to Canadian consumers.

A similar site, IciMusique.ca (formerly espace.mu, in reference to former radio branding Espace Musique), is also offered by CBC Music&#x27;s French-language counterpart Ici Musique.

Shortly after the service&#x27;s launch, Stingray Digital filed a complaint with the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission, alleging that the CBC&#x27;s access to government funding gave it an unfair competitive advantage over private for-profit services. Noting that the CBC pays the same copyright royalties to SOCAN as the competing services and that it places a much greater emphasis on Canadian content than the commercial services, the CRTC dismissed the complaint in August 2012.

In December 2013, the site also launched the first issue of CBC Music Magazine, an e-magazine distributed in both iOS and Android formats. The magazine is no longer published.

With the rebranding of Radio 2 in 2018, the website is considered to be part of the radio network&#x27;s operations rather than a distinct division of the CBC, although the individual genre streams and Radio 3 are still provided. The CBC Music streaming platform was replaced by CBC Listen in 2019.

==Programming==
Although most programming on CBC Music is exclusive to the network, some specialty programs, including &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot; (until 2015), &quot;Vinyl Tap&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;est formidable!&quot;, &quot;Backstage with Ben Heppner&quot; and &quot;Canada Live&quot;, have also aired on Radio One in different time slots.

Until 2007, Radio 2 simulcast the majority of Radio One&#x27;s newscasts, including &quot;The World at Six&quot; and &quot;World Report&quot;, resulting in several lengthy breaks from music throughout the day. This ended in March 2007, when Radio 2 began to carry a separate news service, with news updates of 90 seconds in length a handful of times each day. The length was soon changed to 4 ½ minutes, the usual length of the CBC&#x27;s non-major newscasts, with the frequency increased slightly. However, newscasts on Radio 2 remain distinct from those on Radio One.

During the 2005 Canadian Media Guild lockout, the normal schedule was temporarily replaced by continuous music from Galaxie (then owned by the CBC), except for short news updates at the top of each hour from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time.

After the 2012 federal budget, the CBC applied to the CRTC for permission to introduce commercial advertisements on CBC Radio 2 and sister network Espace Musique. In October 2013, the network began broadcasting a limited amount of advertising, up to four minutes an hour, with a goal of broadcasting up to nine minutes per hour in 2016. Ad-free streams of the Toronto and Vancouver feeds were introduced online for international listeners. On August 31, 2016, the CRTC denied CBC&#x27;s request to continue airing commercial advertisements until August 31, 2018. Consequently, advertising ceased on September 1, 2016.

CBC Music also produces the television series &quot;CBC Music Backstage Pass&quot;, featuring live performances by musicians, for CBC Television.

===Weekday programming===
The network&#x27;s weekday programming does not vary significantly from day to day; except in the 6–7 p.m. hour, when a different one-hour weekly program normally airs each day, the schedule is otherwise consistent from Mondays to Fridays. &quot;Mornings&quot;, hosted by Damhnait Doyle, airs in the morning drive slot, and is followed at 9 a.m. by the classical music show &quot;Tempo&quot;, hosted by Julie Nesrallah. &quot;About Time&quot;, hosted by Tom Allen, airs in the early afternoons, followed by &quot;Drive&quot;, hosted by Rich Terfry.

The 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. block includes &quot;CBC Music Live&quot;, a program that presents recordings of live concerts by Canadian musicians, on Mondays; &quot;Frequencies&quot;, a world music program hosted by Errol Nazareth, on Tuesdays; &quot;Reclaimed&quot;, hosted by Jarrett Martineau and devoted to indigenous music, on Wednesdays; &quot;CBC Music Top 20&quot;, a countdown show currently hosted by Grant Lawrence, on Thursdays; and &quot;Marvin&#x27;s Room&quot;, hosted by A. Harmony and devoted to rhythm and blues, on Fridays. This block aired from 7 to 8 p.m. until February 2021, when it was moved to 6 p.m.

Angeline Tetteh-Wayoe hosts &quot;The Block&quot;, a program devoted to black music genres such as hip hop, soul and rhythm and blues, at 7 p.m. Odario Williams hosts &quot;After Dark&quot; in the evenings, while &quot;Nightstream&quot;, a hostless stream of continuous music, airs overnights.

At various times during the day, Grant Lawrence is also heard voicing short segments presenting music news, such as a short profile of a musician who has just released a new album.

===Weekend programming===
On Saturday and Sunday, &quot;Mornings&quot; airs with host Saroja Coelho. For the remainder of the day, however, the network airs a variety of specialty programs, mainly devoted to particular genres of music, rather than replicating the weekday schedule.

Saturday programming includes &quot;My Playlist&quot;, &quot;Centre Stage&quot;, &quot;Saturday Afternoon at the Opera&quot;, &quot;Backstage with Ben Heppner&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Blues&quot; with Holger Petersen and &quot;Saturday Night Jazz&quot; with Laila Biali.

Sunday programming includes &quot;Choral Concert&quot;, &quot;In Concert&quot; with Paolo Pietropaolo, &quot;Inside the Music&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;est formidable!&quot; with Florence K, and &quot;Afterdark Sunday&quot; with Tariq Hussain. On both Saturdays and Sundays, &quot;Nightstream&quot; again airs after midnight.

==Searchlight==
Prior to the launch of CBC Music, CBC Radio 3 broadcast an annual &quot;Searchlight&quot; contest, soliciting listener votes in a process to determine the &quot;best&quot; of various aspects of the Canadian music industry. The topic of Searchlight was different each year, with contests focusing on such themes as Canada&#x27;s best live music club, best music festival and best music website.

Following the launch of CBC Music, Searchlight was relaunched as a platform-wide contest to determine Canada&#x27;s best unsigned musical artist. Incorporating participation from both CBC Music and CBC Radio One, the process begins with a series of local competitions produced by Radio One&#x27;s local afternoon shows. Listener feedback and online voting determines the artists who advance to the next round, until the national stage of the competition begins on &quot;Q&quot;.

When the list has been narrowed to ten artists, three established musicians step in as judges, who each pick their own favourite act. Those three artists and an audience selection as determined by online voting advance to the final round as the four finalists, following which the judges debate and discuss the choices before voting on the ultimate winner. In 2018, the process was revised, with the judges selecting five artists and a public vote selecting five artists, for a list of ten finalists rather than four.

The winner of the competition wins $20,000 in musical gear from Yamaha Music, as well as a slot on the bill at the CBC Music Festival.

Beginning in 2022, the competition also instituted a Fan Choice Award, presented to the three top vote-getters in the first stage of the competition regardless of how they fared through the later stages.

===Winners and finalists===

<text>Richard Olney (September 15, 1835 – April 8, 1917) was an American attorney, statesman, and Democratic Party politician who served as a member of the second cabinet of President Grover Cleveland as the 40th United States Attorney General from 1893 to 1895 and 34th Secretary of State from 1895 to 1897.

As attorney general, Olney used injunctions against striking workers in the Pullman strike, setting a precedent, and advised the use of federal troops, when legal means failed to control the strikers.

As Secretary of State, Olney mediated the Venezuelan crisis of 1895 and managed Cleveland&#x27;s anti-expansionist policy in response to the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom and the Cuban War of Independence, though both Hawaii and Cuba were annexed during the subsequent William McKinley administration. He raised the status of America in the world by elevating U.S. diplomatic posts to the status of embassy.

== Early life and education ==
Olney was born into a prosperous family in Oxford, Massachusetts. His father was Wilson Olney, a textiles manufacturer and banker. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to Louisville, Kentucky, and lived there until Olney was seven. The family then moved back to Oxford and Olney attended school at the Leicester Academy in Leicester, Massachusetts.

He graduated with high honors as class orator from Brown University in 1856. He received a Bachelor of Laws degree from Harvard Law School in 1858.

In 1859, he passed the bar and began practicing law in Boston, attaining a reputation as an authority on probate, trust and corporate law.

== Early career ==

Olney was elected a selectman in West Roxbury, Massachusetts and served one term in the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1874, serving as a member of the Committee on the Judiciary. He declined to run again, preferring to return to his law practice.

In 1876, Olney inherited his father-in-law&#x27;s Boston law practice and became involved in the business affairs of Boston&#x27;s elite families.

During the 1880s, Olney became one of the Boston&#x27;s leading railroad attorneys and the general counsel for Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway.

Olney was once asked by a former railroad employer if he could do something to get rid of the newly formed Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). He suggested that the ICC would become a captive regulator, replying in an 1892 letter, &quot;The Commission... is, or can be made, of great use to the railroads. It satisfies the popular clamor for a government supervision of the railroads, at the same time that that supervision is almost entirely nominal. Further, the older such a commission gets to be, the more inclined it will be found to take the business and railroad view of things... The part of wisdom is not to destroy the Commission, but to utilize it.&quot;

== Attorney General ==
In March 1893, Olney became U.S. Attorney General and used the law to thwart strikes, which he considered an illegitimate tactic contrary to law. Olney argued that the government must prevent interference with its mails and with the general railway transportation between the states.

=== Pullman strike ===
During the 1894 Pullman strike, Olney instructed district attorneys to secure from the Federal Courts writs of injunction against striking railroad employees. He ordered the Chicago district attorney to convene a grand jury to find cause to indict Eugene Debs and other labor leaders and sent federal marshals to protect rail traffic, ordering 150 marshals deputized in Helena, Montana alone.

When the legal measures failed, he advised President Cleveland to send federal troops to Chicago to quell the strike, over the objections of the Governor of Illinois.

In comparison to his $8,000 compensation as Attorney General, Olney had been a railroad attorney and had a $10,000 retainer from the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad. Olney got an injunction from circuit court justices Peter S. Grosscup and William Allen Woods (both anti-union) prohibiting ARU officials from &quot;compelling or encouraging&quot; any impacted railroad employees &quot;to refuse or fail to perform any of their duties.&quot; The injunction was disobeyed by Debs and other ARU leaders, and federal forces were dispatched to enforce it. Debs, who had been hesitant to start the strike, put all of his efforts into it. He called on ARU members to ignore the federal court injunctions and the U.S. Army.

== Secretary of State ==
Upon the death of Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham, Cleveland named Olney to the position on June 10, 1895.

Olney quickly elevated US foreign diplomatic posts to the title of embassy, officially raising the status of the United States to one of the world&#x27;s greater nations. (Until then, the United States had had only Legations, which diplomatic protocol dictated be treated as inferior to embassies.)

Olney took a prominent role in the boundary dispute between the British and Venezuelan governments. In his correspondence with Lord Salisbury, he gave an extended interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine that went considerably beyond previous statements on the subject, now known as the Olney interpretation.

== Later years and death ==

Olney returned to the practice of the law in 1897, at the expiration of Cleveland&#x27;s term.

In March 1913, Olney turned down President Wilson&#x27;s offer to be the US Ambassador to Great Britain, and later, in May 1914, when President Wilson offered Olney the Appointment as Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, he declined that appointment. Olney was unwilling to take on new responsibilities at his advanced age.

He died in 1917 at the age of 81.

== Personal life ==
In 1861, Olney married Agnes Park Thomas of Boston, Massachusetts.

Olney was the uncle of Massachusetts Congressman Richard Olney II.

Author H.W. Brands recounts claims that Olney &quot;responded to a daughter&#x27;s indiscretion by banishing her from his home, never to see her again, although they lived in the same city for thirty years.&quot;

=== Honors ===
Olney received the honorary degree of LL.D from Harvard and Brown in 1893 and from Yale University in 1901. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1897.
