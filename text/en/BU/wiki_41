<text>Darryl R. Dawkins (January 11, 1957 – August 27, 2015) was an American professional basketball player and coach. He was particularly known for his tenure with the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets, although he also played briefly for the Detroit Pistons and Utah Jazz late in his career. His nickname, &quot;Chocolate Thunder&quot;, was bestowed upon him by Stevie Wonder. He was known for his powerful dunks, which led to the NBA adopting breakaway rims due to him shattering a backboard on two occasions in 1979.

Dawkins averaged double figures in scoring nine times in his 14 years in the NBA, often ranking among the league leaders in field-goal percentage. He also played in the NBA Finals three times as a member of the Philadelphia 76ers in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He also won an NBA Championship in 1989 with the Detroit Pistons even though he only played 14 games for the team that season. Dawkins set an NBA record for fouls in a season (386 in 1983–84).

==Early life==
Dawkins was born in Orlando, Florida, on January 11, 1957, to Harriet James and Frank Dawkins. His grandmother Amanda Celestine Jones was fond of the young Darryl and personally raised him.

As a senior at Maynard Evans High School in Orlando, Florida, Dawkins averaged 32 points and 21 rebounds to lead his team to the state championship. He was heavily recruited by Division I colleges across the country, and he narrowed his choices to Florida State, Kansas, and Kentucky.

==NBA career==
Dawkins opted to directly enter the NBA draft out of high school instead of attending college. He made this decision because he wanted to make enough money to help his grandmother, mother, and siblings to escape poverty. He was the first player to enter the NBA immediately after high school.

===Philadelphia 76ers===

With the fifth overall pick in the 1975 NBA draft, the Philadelphia 76ers selected Dawkins. He was drafted behind David Thompson, David Meyers, Marvin Webster, and Alvan Adams. He signed a seven-year contract worth $1 million.

Dawkins languished on the Sixers&#x27; bench for his first two seasons. In his second season, after playing limited minutes during the regular season, Dawkins was called upon to help the Sixers in their playoff run, to battle Dave Cowens of the Celtics and Moses Malone of the Rockets. The Sixers won both playoff series and advanced to the NBA Finals. Matched up against Portland&#x27;s Bill Walton, Dawkins helped the Sixers take the first two games before the Trail Blazers won the next four to win the series in six games. In the second game of the series, Dawkins got into a fight with Maurice Lucas, resulting in both players being ejected. Dawkins took his anger out on the 76ers locker room by tearing a toilet out of the wall and dislodging a locker stall and barricading the door with it.

Dawkins&#x27; role in helping the Sixers win the Eastern Conference championship established him as one of Philadelphia&#x27;s top players, on a team that included Julius Erving, George McGinnis, Lloyd Free, and Doug Collins. At 20 years old, Dawkins averaged 11.7 points and 7.9 rebounds in nearly 25 minutes per game, while ranked second in the league in field goal percentage at .575. For the second straight year, the Sixers earned the top seed in the Eastern Division and advanced to the conference finals, but they were defeated by the Washington Bullets in six games.

Prior to the 1978–79 season, Philadelphia traded McGinnis to the Denver Nuggets, clearing the way for Dawkins to be a permanent frontcourt starter. Over the next three seasons, Dawkins and Caldwell Jones split time at the center and power forward positions. In 1979–80, he averaged 14.7 points and a career-high 8.7 rebounds, helping the Sixers back to the NBA Finals, which they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.

In the 1981 season, Dawkins produced a .607 field-goal percentage, second in the NBA to Artis Gilmore&#x27;s .670. Dawkins averaged 14 points and 7.2 rebounds for the year, but Philadelphia failed to return to the Finals. The club met the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals and lost in seven games.

The 76ers suffered another postseason disappointment in 1982 when they reached the Finals but lost again to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. Frustrated with the team&#x27;s inability to handle Lakers center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Sixers management traded Dawkins to the New Jersey Nets and Caldwell Jones to the Houston Rockets for Moses Malone, who helped Philadelphia win the NBA championship the following year.

===New Jersey Nets===
Dawkins was traded to the Nets during the 1982 off-season in exchange for a first-round draft pick. At age 25, Dawkins joined a Nets club that included Albert King, Buck Williams, and Otis Birdsong. His first two seasons with the Nets were successful for both sides, as Dawkins experienced a career renaissance of sorts and the Nets had their most successful seasons to that point.

In the 1982–83 season, Dawkins averaged 12 points and shot .599 from the floor, ranking third in the league in field-goal percentage. The Nets&#x27; 49–33 record that year was their best record since the ABA–NBA merger, and remained their best record until the 2001–02 season.

The next season, he poured in a career-high 16.8 points per game on .593 field-goal shooting and grabbed 6.7 rebounds per contest. On November 3, 1983, Dawkins grabbed what would be his highest rebound total as a Net, with 15 during a 112–107 win over the Chicago Bulls. Two days later, on November 5, 1983, Dawkins set the Nets&#x27; franchise record for blocks in a single game, with 13. In the first round of the playoffs, the sixth-seeded Nets were matched up with Dawkins&#x27; former team, the Philadelphia 76ers. The Nets won the first two games in Philadelphia of the best-of-five series, which were the first playoff game victories in team history. After Philadelphia won the next two games, the Nets won a decisive game 5 when Dawkins&#x27; defense on reigning MVP Moses Malone helped New Jersey overcome a late deficit to win their first playoff series. The Nets&#x27; playoff series win over the defending NBA champions was ranked as the seventh-greatest playoff upset by &quot;Sports Illustrated.&quot; Despite Dawkins averaging 22.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game in the following series against the Milwaukee Bucks, including leading all scorers with a career playoff-high 32 points in a 106–100 game 1 win, the Nets would lose the series in six games after losing game 6, during which Dawkins scored 29 points and grabbed 8 rebounds, by one point, at a score of 98–97. For the playoffs, Dawkins averaged 18.4 points.

With the Nets looking to be a team on the rise led by Dawkins, they entered the 1984–85 season with high expectations. However injuries limited him to just 39 games. Dawkins appeared to return to form the following season averaging 15.3 points and shooting .644 from the floor, but an injury midway through the season kept him out of 31 of the team&#x27;s final 32 games. He only played six games in the 1986–87 season, after a second back surgery in less than two years.

===Later career===
Dawkins was traded to the Utah Jazz in a seven-player, three-team trade during the 1987 offseason. His tenure with Utah lasted just four games before the Jazz traded him to the Detroit Pistons for a pair of second-round draft picks and an undisclosed amount of cash.

Dawkins&#x27; personality was a natural fit on the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; Pistons team, and despite being limited to 14 games over two seasons, he was considered to be one of the leaders of the team. Dawkins was often inactive for games as he was still recovering from his back injuries and dealing with the death of his estranged wife. In his final season in the NBA, the Pistons won the NBA championship, and Dawkins finally earned a championship ring.

Dawkins received a training camp invitation from the Orlando Magic for their inaugural season in 1989, but he opted to play in Italy. He spent several seasons in Italy, playing for Torino, Olimpia Milano and Telemarket Forli. He attempted a comeback in 1994, attending Denver Nuggets training camp, and again in 1995 with the Boston Celtics.

Dawkins set an NBA record by committing 386 personal fouls during the 1983–1984 season. He committed one more personal foul during his career than Michael Jordan, despite playing nearly 350 fewer games.

===Signature dunking===
In a game against the Kansas City Kings at Municipal Auditorium on November 13, 1979, Dawkins broke the backboard, sending the Kings&#x27; Bill Robinzine ducking. Three weeks later he did it again, this time at home against the San Antonio Spurs at the Spectrum. A few days after that the NBA created a new rule that breaking a backboard was an offense that would result in a fine and suspension.

Dawkins named the first backboard-breaking dunk &quot;The Chocolate-Thunder-Flying, Robinzine-Crying, Teeth-Shaking, Glass-Breaking, Rump-Roasting, Bun-Toasting, Wham-Bam, Glass-Breaker-I-Am-Jam.&quot; He named other dunks as well: the Rim Wrecker, the Go-Rilla, the Look Out Below, the In-Your-Face Disgrace, the Cover Your Head, the Yo-Mama, the Spine-Chiller Supreme, and the Greyhound Special (for the rare occasions when he went coast to coast). The 76ers also kept a separate column on the stat sheet for Dawkins&#x27;s self-created nicknames: &quot;Sir Slam&quot; and &quot;Chocolate Thunder.&quot; Dawkins also wore gold chain necklaces during games until the end of the 1980 NBA Finals when the NBA banned players from wearing them on court. One gold chain had a cross while the other featured one of his nicknames &quot;Sir Slam&quot; in gold script. He also had a similar necklace that has another nickname &quot;Dr. Dunk&quot; in gold script. Sometimes, Dawkins would also shave his head and have it oiled along with wearing an earring.

At one point, Dawkins claimed to be an alien from the planet Lovetron, where he spent the off-season practicing &quot;interplanetary funkmanship&quot; where his girlfriend Juicy Lucy lived.

Musician Stevie Wonder, who frequently attended Sixers games, gave Dawkins the nickname &quot;Chocolate Thunder&quot;.

==Post-NBA career==
Following his NBA career, Dawkins had a brief stint with the Harlem Globetrotters, followed by a season spent with the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the Continental Basketball Association in the 1995–96 season. During this season, the Skyforce&#x27;s games against the Florida Beach Dogs were broadcast nationally by ESPN, as the Beach Dogs included another former NBA player, Manute Bol. 

Dawkins was the head coach of the American Basketball Association&#x27;s Newark Express. He was also the player/coach of the Winnipeg Cyclone, a team in the short-lived International Basketball Association in 1999–2000. Dawkins averaged 3.8 points and 3.9 rebounds in 18 games played with the Cyclone.

Dawkins was the head coach of the Allentown, Pennsylvania-based Pennsylvania ValleyDawgs of the United States Basketball League (USBL) until they folded. He was selected as the USBL Coach of the Year in 1999. Dawkins appeared in one game with ValleyDawgs during the 2000 season.

On August 20, 2009, Lehigh Carbon Community College, located in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, announced Dawkins as head coach of the basketball team. He served in that role from 2009 to 2011.

==Other media==
On April 7, 1986, he appeared at &quot;WrestleMania II&quot; as a guest judge for a boxing match between Mr. T (with Joe Frazier, The Haiti Kid) versus Roddy Piper (with Bob Orton and Lou Duva).

In 1989, Dawkins appeared as himself (credited as &quot;The Basketball Star&quot;) in the documentary &quot;The Big Bang&quot;.

Dawkins appears in &quot;NBA Ballers&quot; and the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; video games as a reserve member of the 1980s Legends East Team. He also appears in &quot;NBA Live Mobile&quot; as a Legend based on his 1979–80 season with the Sixers.

In 2005, Dawkins was one of several former NBA players to audition for an analyst position with ESPN, as part of the network&#x27;s reality series &quot;Dream Job&quot;.

==Personal life==
Dawkins&#x27; autobiography &quot;Chocolate Thunder: The Uncensored Life and Times of Darryl Dawkins&quot; (co-authored with Charley Rosen) chronicles his on- and off-the-court life as an NBA star. In the book, Dawkins chronicled some of the racism he encountered during his NBA career, playing alongside 76ers superstar Julius Erving, and his off-the-court experiences with drugs, partying, and women.

In September 1986, Dawkins eloped with Kelly Barnes of Trenton, New Jersey. The following autumn, the two were planning to divorce when she committed suicide on November 1, 1987, at her parents&#x27; home in New Jersey; Dawkins was in Utah with his team at the time. In 1988, Dawkins married a former Nets cheerleader, Robbin Thornton; they divorced after 10 years. Dawkins later remarried; he and his wife, Janice, had three children: Nick, Alexis, and Tabitha, a daughter from Janice&#x27;s previous relationship who has Down syndrome.

His son, Nick Dawkins, plays football at Penn State University.

In 1999, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; named Dawkins the &quot;Man of the Millennium&quot; in a &quot;Weekend Update&quot; sketch.

==Death==
Dawkins died on August 27, 2015, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, at the age of 58. The Lehigh County coroner&#x27;s office announced that an autopsy would be performed on August 27, but according to a statement released by Dawkins&#x27; family, the cause of death was a heart attack.

Over 600 people attended his public casket viewing. Among them were former boxing heavyweight champion Larry Holmes, former 76ers teammate Billy Cunningham (who also coached Dawkins for five of his seven seasons with the team), former New Jersey Net Tim Bassett, and modern NBA players Jason Thompson and Karl-Anthony Towns.

<doc id="596094" wikidata="Q258677" url="?curid=596094" title="British Rail Class 16">
<text>The British Rail Class 16 also known as the North British Type 1 was a type of diesel locomotive designed and manufactured by the North British Locomotive Company. A total of ten were produced, these being numbered D8400-D8409.

The type was ordered by British Railways (BR) as an element of the 1955 Modernisation Plan. The design was largely derived from North British&#x27;s earlier prototype locomotive, designated No. 10800, produced during the late 1940s; it also incorporated several engineering approaches common to steam locomotives, the company allegedly having difficulty transitioning to the new traction format. Akin to several other Type 1 designs, they were relatively compact locomotives that were intended primarily for local freight traffic. The performance of the type was found to be lacking in comparison with its peers, thus the potential for follow-on orders evaporated and no further examples were constructed beyond the original batch. The Class 16 shared numerous design features with those used on subsequent locomotives by the company, particularly the British Rail Class 21 locomotive.

==Background==
In less than a decade following the formation of British Railways (BR), substantial changes were being made. Under the 1955 Modernisation Plan, a long-term strategy of replacing steam locomotives with a combination of diesel locomotives and electric locomotives was adopted, with the former being largely intended as an interim measure for most areas ahead of widespread electrification of trunk routes. There was also a strong political desire to support British manufacturers in transitioning towards the design and production of these favoured forms of traction. Due to a lack of expertise, this often involved the pairing of traditional locomotive manufacturers with various firms within the electrical sector, even though the latter typically had very limited experience of the railways.

In accordance with these policies, BR ramped up its efforts to convert its fleet, placing numerous orders within a short timeframe for diesel locomotives to several different specifications with various manufacturers. On 16 November 1955, a small order for ten Type 1 freight locomotives was placed with the North British Locomotive Company. Under BR&#x27;s &#x27;pilot scheme&#x27;, such batches were intended for evaluation purposes under competitive conditions against rival designs in which the better models would receive follow-on orders. In the Class 16&#x27;s case, this included the British Thomson-Houston Class 15 and English Electric Class 20

==Construction==

The design drew heavily upon North British&#x27;s earlier prototype locomotive, designated No. 10800, which had been developed between 1947 and 1950. Having been ordered originally by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway prior to its absorption into BR, No. 10800 was designed for use on branch and secondary lines; according to railway historian Rodger Bradley, this early British diesel locomotive functioned not only as the direct predecessor of the Class 16, but can be more broadly considered to be the forerunner of all BR designs orientated towards this type of work up until the 1980s.

The design also shared some similarities with the contemporary British Rail Class 15; both locomotives adopted the road-switcher layout that had been rapidly becoming the standard approach on the railways of both North America and Australia at the time; they were also both powered by an Paxman 16YHXL prime mover. However, the North British design suffered a major setback as a result of external policy decisions; while the company had decided to approach the new era of diesel traction by specialising in hydraulic transmissions in partnership with the West German industrial interest Voith, BR planners had decided to favour electric transmissions instead, putting the firm at a competitive disadvantage to those locomotive builders that had opted for this transmission system.

The locomotive&#x27;s construction was based on fabricated mainframes that ran the entire length of the locomotive; this practice was inline with traditional steam locomotive designs. According to Bradley, North British found it difficult to translate their steam engineering skills to the newer diesel and electric traction designs. The mainframes were carried on a pair of four‑wheeled bogies and supported the single drivers cab and the superstructure in which the engine and other apparatus was accommodated within. Both the electro‑pneumatic control system and traction motors of the Class 16 were identical to those used on the subsequent British Rail Class 21 locomotive, albeit with the traction motors being downrated to 152 hp and 420 rpm. As they were intended exclusively for hauling freight trains, they were not equipped with train heating boilers.

The original delivery schedule agreed between North British and BR called for the delivery of the first locomotive to occur 21 months from the date of settlement of technical details, resulting in an intended delivery date of August 1957. However, there was considerable complications encountered during the type&#x27;s construction, which has been typically viewed as not unexpected in light of a general lack of experience with mainline diesel traction on Britain&#x27;s railways, and as such did not come as a surprise to many officials at the time. The first Class 16 locomotives did not emerge from North British&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Park Works in Glasgow until the summer of 1958, roughly one year behind schedule.

==Operation==
Upon their completion, all ten Class 16 locomotives (numbered D8400–D8409) were delivered to Devons Road depot, Bow, North-east London on the London Midland Region of British Railways between May and September 1958. There, the type underwent evaluation against the rival designs, but were promptly relocated to nearby Stratford depot on the Eastern Region, where they remained for the rest of their operating lives. The allocation of all ten locomotives in October 1967 was Stratford.

The results of the evaluation were not positive for the type, thus no further Class 16s were ever produced. While the Class 15s also suffered problems with the Paxman engines, these were worse on Class 16 because inadequate ventilation resulted in frequent engine seizures. Another problem was coolant contamination of the oil, due to cylinder head failure. They were fitted with a non-standard type of electro-mechanical control equipment (coded &quot;red circle&quot; by BR) which was prone to failure, and they could not operate in multiple with locomotives fitted with the more common electro-pneumatic (&quot;blue star&quot;) controls.

==Withdrawal==
Being both non-standard and fairly unreliable, the locomotives were an obvious candidate for early withdrawal despite barely being ten years old as BR planners were coming to this conclusion. Accordingly, they were all withdrawn between February and September 1968; all ten Class 16s had been cut up for scrap by the end of 1969.

<text>The Winstons were an American funk and soul music group based in Washington, D.C. They are known for their 1969 recording featuring a song entitled &quot;Color Him Father&quot; on the A-side, and &quot;Amen, Brother&quot; on the B-side. Halfway into &quot;Amen, Brother&quot;, there is a drum solo (performed by Gregory C. Coleman) which would cause the release to become the most widely sampled record in the history of electronic music. Sampled audio clips of the drum solo became known as the Amen break, which has been used in thousands of tracks in many musical genres, including breakcore, drum and bass, hip hop, jungle, big beat and industrial.

The &quot;Color Him Father&quot; record sold over one million copies, and received a gold record awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America on 24 July 1969. It also won a Grammy Award for the Best Rhythm and Blues Song (1970).

The Winstons struggled to secure gigs in the South with their multiracial composition and disbanded in 1970.

<doc id="596106" wikidata="Q1718715" url="?curid=596106" title="Albert Parsons">
<text>Albert Richard Parsons (June 20, 1848 – November 11, 1887) was a pioneering American socialist and later anarchist newspaper editor, orator, and labor activist. As a teenager, he served in the military force of the Confederate States of America in Texas, during the American Civil War. After the war, he settled in Texas, and became an activist for the rights of former slaves, and later a Republican official during Reconstruction. With his wife Lucy Parsons, he then moved to Chicago in 1873 and worked in newspapers. There he became interested in the rights of workers. In 1884, he began editing &quot;The Alarm&quot; newspaper. Parsons was one of four Chicago radical leaders controversially convicted of conspiracy and hanged following a bomb attack on police remembered as the Haymarket affair.

==Early years==
Parsons was born June 20, 1848, in Montgomery, Alabama, one of the ten children of the proprietor of a shoe and leather factory who had originally hailed from Maine.

Parsons claimed to be the scion of pioneer English immigrants, with &quot;the first Parsons family&quot; arriving at Narragansett Bay in what is now the state of Rhode Island in 1632. One of the Tompkins on his mother&#x27;s side was with George Washington in the American Revolution and fought at the Battle of Brandywine. He was also a descendant of Major General Samuel Holden Parsons of Massachusetts, another officer in the Revolution, as well as a Captain Parsons who received wounds at the Battle of Bunker Hill.

Albert&#x27;s parents both died when he was a small child, leaving the boy to be raised by his eldest brother, William Henry Parsons (1826–1907), who was married and the proprietor of a small newspaper in Tyler, Texas, the &quot;Tyler Telegraph.&quot; In the middle of the 1850s, the family moved from Tyler to Johnson County, living on the frontier for three years. Thereafter, they moved again to the Texas Hill Country, establishing a farm in the valley of the Brazos River.

In 1859, at the age of 11, Albert left his brother&#x27;s household to go live with a sister in Waco, Texas. Parsons attended school for about a year before leaving to become an apprentice at the Galveston &quot;Daily News,&quot; a relationship that Parsons characterized as being &quot;indentured&quot; for seven years in order to learn the printers&#x27; trade.

==Civil War and Reconstruction==
The coming of the American Civil War in 1861, or &quot;the slave-holders&#x27; Rebellion,&quot; as he later called it, led Parsons to leave what he described as the &quot;printer&#x27;s devil&quot;: the position of newsboy. At 13 years old, Parsons volunteered to fight for the forces of the Confederate States of America in an irregular unit known as the &quot;Lone Star Greys.&quot; Parsons&#x27; first military exploit was aboard the passenger steamer &quot;Morgan&quot; which ventured into the Gulf of Mexico to intercept and capture the forces of General David E. Twiggs, who had evacuated Texas en route to Washington, D.C.

Upon his return, Parsons sought to enlist in the regular Confederate States Army, an idea ridiculed by his employer and guardian at the time, publisher Willard Richardson of the Galveston &quot;Daily News.&quot; Parsons left his job at the paper, joining an artillery company at a hastily constructed fort at Sabine Pass, Texas, where an elder brother was the captain of an infantry company. For a year, Parsons participated in military drill and served as a &quot;powder monkey&quot; for the cannoneers. Upon the expiration of his first enlistment, Parsons left Fort Sabine to join the cavalry unit of the brother who had previously brought him to Texas, the 12th Regiment of the Texas Cavalry, also known as &quot;Parsons&#x27; Mounted Volunteers.&quot;
Albert Parsons was a member of the &quot;McInoly Scouts&quot; and saw battle during three separate campaigns.

After the war, Parsons returned to Waco, Texas and traded his mule for of standing corn. He hired ex-slaves to help with the harvest and netted a sufficient sum from the sale of the crop to pay for six months&#x27; tuition at Waco University, today known as Baylor, a private Baptist college.

After his time in college, Parsons left to take up the printing trade, first working in a printing office before launching his own newspaper, the Waco &quot;Spectator,&quot; in 1868. In his paper, Parsons took the unpopular position of accepting the terms of surrender and Reconstruction measures aimed at securing the political rights of former slaves. This proved to be a pivotal moment in the 20-year-old&#x27;s life, as he later recalled in his memoirs:

I became a Republican, and, of course, had to go into politics. I incurred thereby the hate and contumely of many of my former army comrades, neighbors, and the Ku Klux Klan. My political career was full of excitement and danger. I took the stump to vindicate my convictions. The lately enfranchised slaves over a large section of country came to know and idolize me as their friend and defender, while on the other hand I was regarded as a political heretic and traitor by many of my former associates.

In 1869, having left the printing trade, Parsons got a job as a traveling correspondent and business agent for the Houston &quot;Daily Telegraph,&quot; during which time he met Lucy Ella Gonzales (or Waller), a woman of multi-ethnic heritage. The pair married in 1872 and Lucy Parsons later became famous in her own right as a radical political activist.

In 1870, Parsons was the beneficiary of Republican political patronage when he was appointed Assistant Assessor of United States Internal Revenue under the administration of Ulysses S. Grant. He also worked as a secretary of the Texas State Senate before being appointed Chief Deputy Collector of United States Internal Revenue at Austin, Texas, a position which he held until 1873.

In the summer of 1873, Parsons travelled extensively through the Midwestern United States as a representative of the Texas &quot;Agriculturalist,&quot; getting a broader view of the country, deciding to settle with his wife in Chicago. With his move to the metropolis, a new chapter of Parsons&#x27; life was begun.

==Chicago years==

===Socialist period (1874–1879)===
In Chicago, Parsons obtained a job as a typesetter for the &quot;Chicago Times.&quot;

In 1874 Parsons became interested in the labor politics as a byproduct of grassroot efforts to force the Chicago Relief and Aid Society to account for millions of dollars of relief aid raised by the group on behalf of victims of the Great Chicago Fire of October 1871. Commercial newspapers came to the aid of the Relief and Aid Society, denouncing its working-class critics as, among other things, &quot;Communists&quot; — a term given new currency after the rise and fall of the Paris Commune during the first half of 1871 — prompting Parsons to begin to study the essence of the charges. Parsons later recalled that this study had convinced him that &quot;the complaints of the working people against the society were just and proper&quot; and led him to draw parallels between the treatment of poor people in both the urban North and the Reconstruction South. &quot;It satisfied me there was a great fundamental wrong at work in society and in existing social and industrial arrangements,&quot; he later declared.

In 1875, Parsons left the Republican Party&#x27;s orbit and joined the ephemeral Social-Democratic Party of North America (SDP). Parsons attended the 2nd Convention of the SDP, held in Philadelphia from July 4–6, 1875, and was one of the group&#x27;s leading English-speaking members in Chicago, joined by another able speaker, George A. Schilling.

As an interested observer, Parsons attended the final convention of the National Labor Union (NLU), held in Pittsburgh in April 1876. At this convention the dying NLU divided, with its radical wing exiting to establish the Workingmen&#x27;s Party of the United States — a group that soon merged with the SDP to which Parsons belonged. This organization later renamed itself the Socialist Labor Party of America at its December 1877 convention in Newark, New Jersey, which Parsons attended as a delegate. Parsons was also elected as one of two Chicago delegates to the organization&#x27;s 2nd national Convention, held in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, at the end of 1879.

Parsons was also involved with the Knights of Labor during its embryonic period. He joined the Knights of Labor, known then as &quot;The Noble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor,&quot; on July 4, 1876, after having been invited to speak at a mass meeting of workers. Parsons remained a member of the order until his death more than a decade later. Not long after joining the Knights of Labor, Parsons and his friend George Schilling co-founded the first Chicago order of the Knights, later dubbed the &quot;Old 400&quot;.

In the fall of 1876, Parsons was nominated for Chicago City Alderman by the Workingmen&#x27;s Party of the United States. He received an impressive one-sixth share of the vote.

In the spring of 1877, the Workingmen&#x27;s Party ran a full slate of candidates in Cook County, including Chicago. The organization elected three of its members to the Illinois State Legislature and one to the Illinois State Senate. In this election, Parsons ran for County Clerk of Cook County, narrowly losing but polling nearly 8,000 votes. In the course of his life, Parsons ran three times for Chicago City Alderman, twice for Cook County Clerk, and once for United States Congress.

Parsons was one of the foremost speakers in the English language on behalf of the socialist cause in Chicago in the 1870s. In 1877 a Great Railroad Strike took place. On July 21, about a week after the beginning of the strike, Parsons was called upon to address a vast throng of perhaps 30,000 workers congregated at a mass meeting on Chicago&#x27;s Market Street. Parsons gave a powerful speech to the assembled strikers and their friends on behalf of the Workingmen&#x27;s Party — an action that cost Parsons his job at the &quot;Times&quot; the next day.

After being terminated in the morning, Parsons made his way to the offices of the leading German-language socialist newspaper, the &quot;Chicagoer Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; (Chicago Workers&#x27; News). He was found there and escorted to Chicago City Hall, where he was ushered before the Chief of Police and about 30 of the city&#x27;s &quot;leading citizens&quot;. There Parsons was dressed down for about two hours, with the Chief of Police asking Parsons if he didn&#x27;t &quot;know better than to come here from Texas and incite the working people to insurrection.&quot; Parsons disclaimed any such notion, noting that he had urged the workers not to strike but to go to the polls to elect new representatives. With the agitated worthies present in the room audibly muttering such sentiments as &quot;Hang him&quot; and &quot;Lynch him,&quot; the Chief of Police advised Parsons that his life was in danger and urged him to leave town. Parsons was allowed to leave, but he remained in Chicago despite the implied threat on his life.

The afternoon Chicago papers trumpeted that &quot;strike leader&quot; Albert Parsons had been &quot;arrested&quot; that day — neither of which things were true. The Chicago strike of 1877 was ultimately violently repressed by the action of the police and militia.

===Anarchist period (1880–1887)===
At the turn of the decade, Albert Parsons withdrew from all participation in electoral politics. He later recalled his rationale in his memoirs, written shortly before his execution in 1887:

In 1879 I withdrew from all active participation in the political Labor Party, having been convinced that the number of hours per day that the wage-workers are compelled to work, together with the low wages they received, amounted to their practical disfranchisement as voters. ... My experience in the Labor Party had also taught me that bribery, intimidation, duplicity, corruption, and bulldozing grew out of the conditions which made the working people poor and the idlers rich, and that consequently the ballot-box could not be made an index to record the popular will until the existing debasing, impoverishing, and enslaving industrial conditions were first altered.

Parsons turned his activity to the growing movement to establish the 8-hour day. In January 1880, the Eight-Hour League of Chicago sent Parsons to a national conference in Washington, D.C., a gathering which launched a national lobbying movement aimed at coordinating efforts of labor organizations to win and enforce the 8-hour workday.

In 1881, with the membership of the Socialist Labor Party in precipitous decline, a new organization was established, the International Revolutionary Socialists. Parsons was a delegate to the founding convention of this group. Two years later he was also a delegate to the October 1883 convention in Pittsburgh which established the anarchist International Working People&#x27;s Association, the organization to which he owed his political allegiance for the rest of his life.

In the fall of 1884, Parsons launched a weekly anarchist newspaper in Chicago, &quot;The Alarm.&quot; The first issue was dated October 4, 1884, and was produced in a press run of 15,000 copies. The publication was a 4-page broadsheet with a cover price of 5 cents. &quot;The Alarm&quot; listed the International Working People&#x27;s Association as its publisher and touted itself as &quot;A Socialistic Weekly&quot; on its page 2 masthead.

Despite his use of the erstwhile Marxist slogan on the front page, &quot;Workingmen of All Countries, Unite!&quot;, Parsons&#x27; paper was unmistakably anarchist in content. Parsons wrote on the theme in a November 1884 issue:

In the early months of 1886, the luck of the workers was rising as massive strikes were beginning to take place, crippling many industries into making concessions. Parsons called for a move to &quot;Eight hours&#x27; work for ten hours&#x27; pay.&quot; Workers in some industries were even beginning to get this. As May approached, so did the day designated as the official day to strike for the eight-hour work day.

On May 1, 1886, Parsons, with his wife Lucy and two children, led 80,000 people down Michigan Avenue, in what is regarded as the first-ever May Day Parade, in support of the eight-hour work day. Over the next few days 340,000 laborers joined the strike. Parsons, amidst the May Day Strike, found himself called to Cincinnati, where 300,000 workers had struck that Saturday afternoon. On that Sunday he addressed the rally in Cincinnati of the news from the &quot;storm center&quot; of the strike and participated in a second huge parade, led by 200 members of The Cincinnati Rifle Union, with certainty that victory was at hand.

The future looked bright, and many believed that they had finally accomplished what they had been trying to for so long.

==Haymarket Affair==
Parsons addressed a rally at Haymarket Square on May 4. This rally was set up in protest of what happened a few days before. On May 1, 1886, the first May Day, a massive strike in support of the eight-hour work day occurred in Chicago. Two days later police fired on workers on strike at the huge McCormick Reaper Works, killing six. August Spies and others organized the rally at the Haymarket in protest of the police violence.

Parsons originally declined to speak at the Haymarket fearing it would cause violence by holding the rally outdoors, but he changed his mind during the rally and eventually showed up while Spies was speaking. The mayor of Chicago was even there and noticed that it was a peaceful gathering, but he left when it looked like it was going to rain. Worried about his children when the weather changed, Albert Parsons, Lizzie Holmes, his wife Lucy, and their children left for Zeph&#x27;s Hall on Lake Street and were followed by several of the protesters.

The event ended around 10 p.m. and at the end of the event, after Parsons had already left and as the audience was already drifting away, a large group of policemen came and forcefully told the crowd to disperse. At that point a bomb thrown into the square exploded, killing one policeman and wounding others. Gunfire erupted, resulting in 7 deaths and many others wounded.

No one knew who threw the bomb but chaos emerged as police began firing into the crowd. Numerous protestors and policemen died, with most of the police receiving wounds from friendly fire. Parsons was drinking a schooner of beer at Zeph&#x27;s Hall when he saw a flash and heard the explosion followed by gunfire.

Authorities apprehended seven men in the days after the events in the Haymarket. These men were ones that had connections to the anarchist movement and many people thought them to be promoters of radical ideas, meaning that they could have been involved in a conspiracy. Parsons avoided arrest and moved to Waukesha, Wisconsin, where he remained until June 21; afterward, he turned himself in to stand in solidarity with his comrades.

William Perkins Black, a corporate lawyer, led the defense, despite inevitably becoming ostracized from his peers and losing business for this choice. Witnesses testified that none of the eight threw the bomb. However, all were found guilty, and only Oscar Neebe was sentenced to 15 years in prison, while the rest of them were sentenced to death. Samuel Fielden and Michael Schwab asked for clemency and their sentences were commuted to life in prison on November 10, 1887, by Governor Richard James Oglesby, who lost popularity for this decision. These three men received pardons from Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld, securing their freedom from incarceration on June 26, 1893.

In the week before his execution, &quot;The Alarm&quot; was published again for the first time since the Haymarket events, with a page 2 letter by Albert Parsons written from Prison Cell 29 on death row. In his communique, Parsons named Dyer D. Lum as his editorial successor and offered final advice to his supporters:

On November 10, 1887, condemned prisoner Louis Lingg killed himself in his cell with a blasting cap hidden in a cigar. The next day, Parsons, August Spies, Adolph Fischer, and George Engel were executed by hanging.

Parsons likely could have had his sentence commuted to life in prison rather than death, but he refused to write the letter asking the governor to do so, as this would be an admission of guilt.

Parsons&#x27; final words on the gallows, recorded for posterity by Dyer D. Lum in &quot;The Alarm,&quot; were: &quot;Will I be allowed to speak, oh men of America? Let me speak, Sheriff Matson! Let the voice of the people be heard! O—&quot; But the signal was given and Parsons&#x27; words were cut short by the springing of the trap-door.

==Family==
His wife, Lucy Parsons, was noteworthy in her own right. She was a feminist, journalist, and labor leader, and one of the founders of the Industrial Workers of the World.

== Legacy ==
A historical marker dedicated to Albert and Lucy Parsons was erected in 1997 by the City of Chicago at the location of their home, 1908 North Mohawk Street, in the Old Town neighborhood.

<doc id="596108" wikidata="Q1028865" url="?curid=596108" title="GeForce 6 series">
<text>The GeForce 6 series (codename NV40) is the sixth generation of Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce line of graphics processing units. Launched on April 14, 2004, the GeForce 6 family introduced PureVideo post-processing for video, SLI technology, and Shader Model 3.0 support (compliant with Microsoft DirectX 9.0c specification and OpenGL 2.0).
==GeForce 6 series features==
===SLI===
The Scalable Link Interface (SLI) allows two GeForce 6 cards of the same type to be connected in tandem. The driver software balances the workload between the cards. SLI-capability is limited to select members of the GeForce 6 family; 6500 and above. SLI is only available for cards utilizing the PCI-Express bus.

===Nvidia PureVideo Technology===
Nvidia PureVideo technology is the combination of a dedicated video processing core and software which decodes H.264, VC-1, WMV, and MPEG-2 videos with reduced CPU utilization.

===Shader Model 3.0===
Nvidia was the first to deliver Shader Model 3.0 (SM3) capability in its GPUs. SM3 extends SM2 in a number of ways: standard FP32 (32-bit floating-point) precision, dynamic branching, increased efficiency and longer shader lengths are the main additions. Shader Model 3.0 was quickly adopted by game developers because it was quite simple to convert existing shaders coded with SM 2.0/2.0A/2.0B to version 3.0, and it offered noticeable performance improvements across the entire GeForce 6 line.

===Caveats===
PureVideo functionality varies by model, with some models lacking WMV9 and/or H.264 acceleration.

In addition, motherboards with some VIA and SIS chipsets and an AMD Athlon XP processor seemingly have compatibility problems with the GeForce 6600 and 6800 GPUs. Problems that have been known to arise are freezing, artifacts, reboots, and other issues that make gaming and use of 3D applications almost impossible. These problems seem to happen only on Direct3D based applications and do not affect OpenGL.

===Geforce 6 series comparison===
Here is how the released versions of the &quot;GeForce 6&quot; series family compare to Nvidia&#x27;s previous flagship GPU, the GeForce FX 5950 Ultra, in addition to the comparable units of ATI&#x27;s newly released for the time Radeon X800 and X850 series:

(*) GeForce FX series has an Array-based Vertex Shader.

(**) AGP 6600 GT variant.

==GeForce 6800 series==

The first family in the GeForce 6 product-line, the 6800 series catered to the high-performance gaming market. As the very first GeForce 6 model, the 16 pixel pipeline GeForce 6800 Ultra (NV40) was 2 to 2.5 times faster than Nvidia&#x27;s previous top-line product (the GeForce FX 5950 Ultra), packed four times the number of pixel pipelines, twice the number of texture units and added a much improved pixel-shader architecture. Yet, the 6800 Ultra was fabricated on the same (IBM) 130 nanometer process node as the FX 5950, and it consumed slightly less power.

Like all of Nvidia&#x27;s GPUs up until 2004, initial 6800 members were designed for the AGP bus. Nvidia added support for the PCI Express (PCIe) bus in later GeForce 6 products, usually by use of an AGP-PCIe bridge chip. In the case of the 6800 GT and 6800 Ultra, Nvidia developed a variant of the NV40 chip called the NV45. The NV45 shares the same die core as the NV40, but embeds an AGP-PCIe bridge on the chip&#x27;s package. (Internally, the NV45 is an AGP NV40 with added bus-translation logic, to permit interfacing with a PCIe motherboard. Externally, the NV45 is a single package with two separate silicon dies clearly visible on the top.) NV48 is a version of NV45 which supports 512MiB RAM.

The use of an AGP-PCIe bridge chip initially led to fears that natively-AGP GPUs would not be able to take advantage of the additional bandwidth offered by PCIe and would therefore be at a disadvantage relative to native PCIe chips. However, benchmarking reveals that even AGP 4× is fast enough that most contemporary games do not improve significantly in performance when switched to AGP 8×, rendering the further bandwidth increase provided by PCIe largely superfluous. Additionally, Nvidia&#x27;s on-board implementations of AGP are clocked at AGP 12× or 16×, providing bandwidth comparable to PCIe for the rare situations when this bandwidth is actually necessary.

The use of a bridge chip allowed Nvidia to release a full complement of PCIe graphics cards without having to redesign them for the PCIe interface. Later, when Nvidia&#x27;s GPUs were designed to use PCIe natively, the bidirectional bridge chip allowed them to be used in AGP cards.
ATI, initially a critic of the bridge chip, eventually designed a similar solution (known as Rialto) for their own cards.

Nvidia&#x27;s professional &quot;Quadro&quot; line contains members drawn from the 6800 series: Quadro FX 4000 (AGP) and the Quadro FX 3400, 4400 and 4400g (both PCI Express). The 6800 series was also incorporated into laptops with the GeForce Go 6800 and Go 6800 Ultra GPUs.

===PureVideo and the AGP GeForce 6800===
PureVideo expanded the level of multimedia-video support from decoding of MPEG-2 video to decoding of more advanced codecs (MPEG-4, WMV9), enhanced post-processing (advanced de-interlacing), and limited acceleration for encoding. But perhaps ironically, the first GeForce product(s) to offer PureVideo, the AGP GeForce 6800/GT/Ultra, failed to support all of PureVideo&#x27;s advertised features.

Media player software (WMP9) with support for WMV-acceleration did not become available until several months after the 6800&#x27;s introduction. User and web reports showed little if any difference between PureVideo enabled GeForces and non-Purevideo cards. The prolonged public silence of Nvidia, after promising updated drivers, and test benchmarks gathered by users led the user community to conclude that the WMV9 decoder component of the AGP 6800&#x27;s PureVideo unit is either non-functional or intentionally disabled. 

In late 2005, an update to Nvidia&#x27;s website finally confirmed what had long been suspected by the user community: WMV-acceleration is not available on the AGP 6800.

Of course, today&#x27;s computers are fast enough to play and decode WMV9 video and other sophisticated codecs like MPEG-4, H.264 or VP8 without hardware acceleration, thus negating the need for something like PureVideo.

===6800 chipset table===
===Notes===
*The limited-supply GeForce 6800 Ultra &quot;Extreme Edition&quot; was shipped with a 450 MHz core clock and (usually) a 1200 MHz memory clock, but was otherwise identical to a common 6800 Ultra.
*The GeForce 6800 GS is cheaper to manufacture and has a lower MSRP than the GeForce 6800 GT because it has fewer pipelines and is fabricated on a smaller process (110 vs 130 nm), but performance is similar because it has a faster core clock. The AGP version, however, uses the original NV40 chip and 6800 GT circuit board and the inactive pixel and vertex pipelines may potentially be unlockable. However, the PCI Express version lacks them entirely, preventing such modifications.
*The 6800 GTO (which was produced only as an OEM card) contains four masked pixel pipelines and one masked vertex shader, which are potentially unlockable.
*The GeForce 6800 is often unofficially called the &quot;GeForce 6800 Vanilla&quot; or the &quot;GeForce 6800 NU&quot; (for Non-Ultra) to distinguish it from the other models. Recent PCIe variants have the NV41 (IBM 0.13 micrometre) or NV42 (TSMC 0.11 micrometer) cores, which are native PCIe implementations and do not have an integrated AGP bridge chip. The AGP version of the video card contains four masked pixel pipelines and one masked vertex shader, which are potentially unlockable through software mods. PCI-Express 6800 cards are incapable of such modifications, because the masked pixel pipelines and vertex buffers are nonexistent.
*The 6800 XT varies greatly depending on manufacturer. It is produced using three cores (NV40/NV41/NV42), four memory configurations (128 MiB DDR, 256 MiB DDR, 128 MiB GDDR3, 256 MiB GDDR3, and 512 MiB GDDR2), and has clock speeds ranging from 300 to 425 MHz (core) and 600-1000 MHz (memory). 6800 XT cards based on the NV40 core contain eight masked pixel pipelines and two masked vertex shaders, and those based on the NV42 core contain four masked pipelines and one masked shader (for some reason, the NV42 cards are almost never unlockable. It is speculated that the pipelines are being laser-cut).
*The 6800 LE contains eight masked pixel pipelines and two masked vertex shaders, which are potentially unlockable.
*The AGP version of the 6800 series does not have support for 2D acceleration in Adobe Reader/Acrobat 9.0 even though the GeForce AGP 6600, and PCI-e 6800 versions do.

==GeForce 6600 series==

The GeForce 6600 (NV43) was officially launched on August 12, 2004, several months after the launch of the 6800 Ultra. With half the pixel pipelines and vertex shaders of the 6800 GT, and a smaller 128-bit memory bus, the lower-performance and lower-cost 6600 is the mainstream product of the GeForce 6 series. The 6600 series retains the core rendering features of the 6800 series, including SLI. Equipped with fewer rendering units, the 6600 series processes pixel data at a slower rate than the more powerful 6800 series. However, the reduction in hardware resources, and migration to TSMC&#x27;s 110 nm manufacturing process (versus the 6800&#x27;s 130 nm process), make the 6600 both less expensive for Nvidia to manufacture and less expensive for customers to purchase.

Their 6600 series currently has three variants: the GeForce 6600LE, the 6600, and the 6600GT (in order from slowest to fastest.) The 6600 GT performs quite a bit better than the GeForce FX 5950 Ultra or Radeon 9800 XT, with the 6600 GT scoring around 8000 in 3DMark03, while the GeForce FX 5950 Ultra scored around 6000, and it is also much cheaper. Notably, the 6600 GT offered identical performance to ATI&#x27;s high-end X800 PRO graphics card with drivers previous December 2004, when running the popular game &quot;Doom 3&quot;. It was also about as fast as the higher-end GeForce 6800 when running games without anti-aliasing in most scenarios.

At introduction, the 6600 family was only available in PCI Express form. AGP models became available roughly a month later, through the use of Nvidia&#x27;s AGP-PCIe bridge chip. A majority of the AGP GeForce 6600GTs have their memory clocked at 900 MHz, which is 100 MHz slower than the PCI-e cards, on which the memory operates at 1000 MHz. This can contribute to a performance decline when playing certain games. However, it was often possible to &quot;overclock&quot; the memory to its nominal frequency of 1000 MHz and there are AGP cards (for example from XFX) that use 1000 MHz by default.

==GeForce 6500==
The GeForce 6500 was released in October 2005 and is based on the same NV44 core as the value/budget (low-end or entry level) GeForce 6200TC, but with a higher GPU clock speed and more memory. The GeForce 6500 also supports SLI.

===GeForce 6500===

* Fill Rate (pixels/s): 1.6 billion
* Vertices per Second: 300 million
* Effective Memory Bandwidth (GiB/s): 13.44

==GeForce 6200==

With just 4 pixel pipelines, the 6200 series forms Nvidia&#x27;s value/budget (low-end or entry level) product. The 6200 omits memory compression and SLI support, but otherwise offers similar rendering features as the 6600s. The later 6200 boards were based on the NV44 core(s), which is the final production silicon for the 6200 series. The 6200 is the only card in the series to feature keying for 3.3V AGP slots (barring some rare exceptions of higher-end cards from vendors like PNY).

However, at introduction, production silicon was not yet ready. Nvidia fulfilled 6200 orders by shipping binned/rejected 6600 series cores (NV43V). The rejects were factory-modified to disable four pixel pipelines, thereby converting the native 6600 product into a 6200 product. Some users were able to &quot;unlock&quot; early 6200 boards through a software utility (effectively converting the 6200 back into a 6600 with the complete set of eight pixel pipelines total) if they owned boards with an NV43 A2 or earlier revision of the core. Thus, not all NV43-based 6200 boards could successfully be unlocked (specifically those with a core revision of A4 or higher), and as soon as NV44 production silicon became available, Nvidia discontinued shipments of downgraded NV43V cores.

==GeForce 6200 TurboCache / AGP==
The GeForce 6200 TurboCache / AGP (NV44/NV44a) is a natively four-pipeline version of the NV43. GeForce 6200 TurboCache cards only have a very small (by modern standards) amount of memory, but attempt to make up for this by using system memory accessed through the PCI-Express bus.

====GeForce 6200 PCI (NV44) without TurboCache====
BFG Technologies originally introduced a unique PCI variant of the GeForce 6200 via its namesake B.F.G. and 3D Fuzion product lines. Subsequently, PNY (GeForce 6200 256 MiB PCI), SPARKLE Computer (GeForce 6200 128 MiB PCI and GeForce 6200 256 MiB PCI), and eVGA (e-GeForce 6200 256 MiB PCI and e-GeForce 6200 512 MiB PCI) released their own PCI versions of the Geforce 6200 featuring higher memory clocks and resultant memory bandwidth.

Until the release of the ATI X1300 PCI, these were the only PCI DirectX 9 capable cards not based on previous generation GeForce FX technology or discontinued XGI Technology Volari V3XT chipsets.

Excluding SPARKLE&#x27;s GeForce 8400 and 8500 series, Zotac GT 610 cards and Club 3D HD 5450 cards in late 2012, the enhanced 512 MiB Geforce 6200 PCI variants remain among the most powerful PCI based systems available, making these cards desired by users lacking the option of upgrading to an AGP or PCI Express based discrete video card.

* Core Clock: 350 MHz
* Memory Clock: 400 MHz (BFG Technologies 6200 OC 410 MHz, PNY and EVGA 533 MHz)
* Pixel Pipelines: 4

==GeForce 6100 and 6150 series==
In late 2005 Nvidia introduced a new member to the GeForce family, the 6100 series, also known as C51. The term GeForce 6100/6150 actually refers to an nForce4-based motherboard with an integrated NV44 core, as opposed to a standalone graphics card. Nvidia released this product both to follow up its immensely popular GeForce4 MX based nForce and nForce2 boards and to compete with ATI&#x27;s RS480/482 and Intel&#x27;s GMA 900/950 in the integrated graphics space. The 6100 series is very competitive, usually tying with or just edging out the ATI products in most benchmarks.

The motherboards use two different types of southbridges - the nForce 410 and the nForce 430. They are fairly similar in features to the nForce4 Ultra motherboards that were on the market before them. Both feature PCI Express and PCI support, eight USB 2.0 ports, integrated sound, two Parallel ATA ports, and Serial ATA 3.0 Gibit/s with Native Command Queuing (NCQ) – two SATA ports in the case of the 410, four in the 430. The 430 southbridge also supports Gigabit Ethernet with Nvidia&#x27;s ActiveArmor hardware firewall, while the 410 supports standard 10/100 Ethernet only.

===GeForce 6100 and 6150 series chip specifications===
Both the 6100 and 6150 support Shader Model 3.0 and DirectX 9.0c. The 6150 also features support for High-Definition video decoding of H.264/VC1/MPEG2, PureVideo Processing, DVI, and video-out. The 6100 only supports SD decoding of MPEG2/WMV9. Maximum supported resolution is 1920 × 1440 pixels (@75 Hz) for RGB display and 1600 × 1200 pixels (@65 Hz) for DVI-D display

===GeForce 61XX abnormally high failure rate in notebook computers===
In 2008, Nvidia took a $150 to 250M charge against revenue because the GPUs were failing at &quot;higher than normal rates.&quot; HP provided an extension to their warranty of up to 24 months for notebooks affected by this issue. A class action suit was filed against HP and Nvidia by Whatley Drake &amp; Kallas LLC.

====GeForce 6100====
* Manufacturing process: 90 nm
* Core Clock: 425 MHz
* Vertex Processors: 1
* Pixel Pipelines: 2
* Shader Model: 3
* DirectX support: v9.0c
* Video playback acceleration: SD video acceleration of MPEG2/WMV9 (HD video acceleration not supported)
* Outputs: VGA only
* Memory: Shared DDR/DDR2 (socket 754/939/AM2) system memory (selectable through BIOS - usually 16/32/64/128/256 MiB)

====GeForce 6150====

* Memory: Shared DDR2 (socket 939/AM2) system memory (selectable through BIOS - usually 16/32/64/128/256 MiB)
* HT Bus (Bandwidth) = 2000 MT/s max

====GeForce 6150LE====
The GeForce 6150LE was primarily featured in the 2006 lineup of the Nvidia Business Platform. The chip is used by Fujitsu-Siemens in its Esprimo green desktop, HP in its Pavilion Media Center a1547c Desktop PC and Compaq Presario SR1915 Desktop, and Dell in its Dimension C521 and E521 desktop PCs.

====GeForce 6150SE====
GeForce 6150SE (MCP61, also known as C61) is an updated, single-chip version of the Nvidia GeForce 6100. The MCP61 uses less power than the original C51 2-chip version of 6100. Its onboard video outperforms the 6150 in many 3D benchmarks despite its lower core frequency (425 MHz), because of added hardware Z-culling.

MCP61 introduced a bug in the SATA NCQ implementation. As a result, Nvidia employees have contributed code to disable NCQ operations under Linux.
*Manufacturing process: 90 nm
*Core Clock: 425 MHz

==IntelliSample 4.0 and the GeForce 6 GPUs==
Upon launch of the GeForce 7 family of graphics processing units, IntelliSample 4.0 was considered to be an exclusive feature of the GeForce 7 series of GPUs. However, version 91.47 (and subsequent versions) of the Nvidia ForceWare drivers enable the features of IntelliSample 4.0 on the GeForce 6 GPUs. IntelliSample 4.0 introduces two new antialiasing modes, known as Transparency Supersampling Antialiasing and Transparency Multisampling Antialiasing. These new antialiasing modes enhance the image quality of thin-lined objects such as fences, trees, vegetation and grass in various games.

One possible reason for the enabling of IntelliSample 4.0 for GeForce 6 GPUs might be the fact that the GeForce 7100 GS GPUs are based on NV44 chips, the same as the GeForce 6200 models. Because of this, Nvidia had to backport IntelliSample 4.0 features to the NV4x GPUs, and as a result, the entire GeForce 6 family is able to enjoy the benefits of Transparency Antialiasing.

It was already well known across various communities that Transparency Antialiasing could be used on GeForce 6 GPUs by using some third party tweak tools. As of Nvidia ForceWare drivers 175.16, GeForce 6 IntelliSample 4.0 support has been removed.

==GeForce 6 model information==
* All models support Transparency AA (starting with version 91.47 of the ForceWare drivers) and PureVideo

===Features===


===GeForce Go 6 (Go 6xxx) series===

== Discontinued support ==
Nvidia has ceased driver support for GeForce 6 series. The GeForce 6 series is the last to support the Windows 9x family of operating systems, as well as Windows NT 4.0. The successor GeForce 7 series only supports Windows 2000 and later (the Windows 8 drivers also support Windows 10).

<text>Sunderland Albion Football Club was an English association football club based in Sunderland, England, formed in 1888. The club played in the Football Alliance, a rival to the Football League, before disbanding in 1892. 

==History==
===Foundation===
In December 1887, Sunderland A.F.C. beat Middlesbrough in an FA Cup replay. Middlesbrough protested on the basis that Sunderland had brought in three outsiders from Scotland, one of whom played under an assumed name; the FA upheld the protest and disqualified Sunderland.

Dissatisfied with the disqualification, on 13 March 1888, A.F.C.&#x27;s vice-captain James Allan held a meeting at The Empress Hotel in Union Street to form a new club, Sunderland Albion, to play on purely amateur lines. Seven Sunderland players defected to Albion along with Sunderland AFC&#x27;s first President (Alderman George Potts).

The &quot;amateur&quot; nature of the new club led to cynicism that the &quot;amateurism&quot; was merely a device to enter Cup competitions, and that players - including the Scottish professionals - had been enticed away by some form of remuneration. The club denied this, stating its role was to fill a geographical gap, being primarily a representative of Bishopwearmouth rather than Monkwearmouth. However the club soon gained sponsorship from wealthy individuals, most noticeably from Allan&#x27;s neighbour James Hartley, who owned the Wear Glass Works at Monkwearmouth, and breweries found sinecure jobs for players - Jimmy Hannah became landlord of the Free Gardeners Arms in Williamson Terrace, with the tenure taken over by John Rae - which enabled the players to claim still to be amateurs.

Albion&#x27;s first fixture was on 5 May 1888 against Shankhouse. Albion&#x27;s first line-up for the game at the Ashville Ground was as follows: Stewart, Oliver, Gilmartin, Richardson, Moore, Baxter, Scott, Kilpatrick, Melville, Monaghan and Nugent. Five of the Albion players were substitutes from Elswick Rangers as certain expected players did not turn up. Albion led 2–0 at half time and triumphed 3–0.

===First cup ties and local cup success===

The club started playing competitive football in 1888–89, entering the FA Cup and the Durham Senior Cup. The enmity with Sunderland A.F.C. became palpable as Albion was drawn against the club in both competitions - in the fourth round of the 1888–89 FA Cup qualifying rounds and the third round of the regional cup - and both times A.F.C. withdrew, on the pretext of the &quot;demoralizing effects of Cup competition&quot;, but suspected on the grounds of Albion protesting the professionalism of the A.F.C.&#x27;s players; in lieu of the disappointed Cup ties, the clubs arranged two matches, one for profit and one for charity, at the A.F.C.&#x27;s Newcastle Road ground. The first took place in December 1888, on the scheduled date of the Qualifying Cup tie. In front of 14,000 spectators, and able to field an unfettered side, A.F.C. won 2–0.

The second - for which a councillor donated a trophy - took place the next month, on the scheduled date of the Durham Cup tie, but bad weather kept the attendance below 10,000. With the score at 2–2 in the 88th minute, a three-player collision saw the ball bounce from goalkeeper Angus off forward Breckenridge and high towards the goal; the Albion players claimed it had gone over the bar, but the referee awarded the goal, resulting in the players walking off the pitch in protest, in defiance of Allen&#x27;s instructions. After the match, the Albion players were followed by &quot;a lot of roughs&quot; who &quot;showed their bad blood by pelting the Albion side with stones&quot;.

Albion also went out of the FA Cup at the first round proper, losing 3–1 at Grimsby Town, handicapped by the non-availability of some of its players. It did at least have the consolation of winning the Durham Cup, beating Birtley 3–0 in the final at Bishop Auckland, thanks to three second-half goals, two being headers from McLellan corners and the third a header from a McLellan cross. The match had to be played twice, as the first was abandoned after the ropes holding the crowd had snapped, with Albion 2–1 to the good.

Albion had also enticed leading teams to its ground for friendlies, including Bolton Wanderers and managed a draw with FA Cup holders West Bromwich Albion.

===Alliance===

The club&#x27;s first season coincided with the first of the Football League, and the Albionites applied for a place at the end of the season; however the four clubs seeking re-election back to the League were all voted back in - in part because the League allowed them to vote on their own membership. The A.F.C. also applied, and received 2 votes, while Albion received none.

The Albionites therefore joined an alternative competition, the Football Alliance, for 1889–90, but was at a disadvantage because of the Alliance&#x27;s requirements to fund three-quarters of the travelling expenses for visiting sides. Sunderland A.F.C. was also tabbed as being a founder member, but did not turn up to the initial meetings, and was &quot;not sorry about it&quot;.

The club had a strong initial Alliance season, but the tightrope of player eligibility caused problems in Cup competitions; the club was disqualified from the 1889–90 FA Cup  (for which the club was exempted from the qualifying rounds) for fielding two ineligible players, namely Sawers, who had been receiving pay before being cleared as a professional, and McKechnie, who had played for Port Glasgow Athletic after Albion had registered him as a player. Albion&#x27;s protest made things even worse, as the FA suspended the club for a fortnight in February, and as a result Albion was forced to forfeit its Durham Cup tie with Bishop Auckland which fell within the period.

With the extra travelling expenses, the club raised £3,000 in share capital in March 1890 by becoming a limited liability company. It finished the season on a high, beating Preston North End 3–1, with West Bromwich goalkeeper Bob Roberts (lured by the attraction of running a pub with a £200 p/a salary) making his debut for the club, but what turned out to be the death knell for the club followed; both Albion and A.F.C. applied to join the Football League for 1890–91, and the League voted to accept Sunderland, but not Albion. The instant consequence was that the Albionites lost access to League clubs for friendly matches, and crowds diminished, as locals preferred to watch the first-class League clubs rather than the second-class Alliance. Although Albion finished 2nd in the Alliance in 1890–91, the effort in so doing caused the club to lose over £700 on an income of £2,358. Albion had at least reached the last 16 of the FA Cup, and it took Nottingham Forest three games, the final one played at the neutral Bramall Lane venue, to eliminate Albion. The Albionites had been particularly unlucky in the first replay at Nottingham, the opening goal coming when Roberts was lying unconscious due to a collision that left the ball rolling into an empty goal.

At the end of the 1890–91 season, the club once more applied to join the Football League, with strong credentials for acceptance (indeed, the side which represented the Football Alliance in a representative game against the Football League in April 1891, at Olive Grove, which ended in a 1–1 draw, featured 4 Albion players). However the clubs seeking re-election were unanimously voted back in, and, with the League extending from 12 to 14 clubs, the claims from Stoke and Darwen for the vacant slots were preferred. Interestingly the one vote Albion received for its application came from Sunderland.

===Northern League===

The club had fielded a reserve side in the Northern Football League in 1890–91, and for the 1891–92 season, the Albion focussed on the Northern League alone. It withdrew from the Football Alliance due to the expense of paying 75% the railway fares of visiting clubs, and rejected an Alliance offer to reduce the amount to 50%. The club had been elected as one of the clubs exempted from FA Cup qualifying in April 1891, but even this was a double-edged sword, as the club lost out on potentially lucrative ties in the qualifying stages. The club looked as if it had lost its first round tie at home to Birmingham St George&#x27;s, but due to a hard frost the referee had ordered the teams to play an exhibition match as he ruled the ground unfit for a Cup tie. and Albion won the replay with ease, going out to Forest in the second round.

The club&#x27;s Northern League season however was mediocre, the club finishing 6th out of 9, and a pitying Sunderland - now League Champions - played two friendlies against Albion, which Sunderland won with ease. The club ended its playing existence with a win, by beating Darwen 5–1 at home in May.

===End of the club===

On 11 May 1892, the club chairman announced that the club needed a £500 guarantee in order to continue; as that was not forthcoming, the directors resolved to wind up the club. The directors also withdrew the club&#x27;s last futile application to join the Football League.

===Revival of name===

A new club using the name was formed in 2020 but ceased operations in 2022.

==Colours==

The club&#x27;s colours were dark blue and white, originally in striped shirts but at the start of the 1889–90 season in the form of white shirts and dark blue knickers, before receiving a new set of striped shirts in September; for Alliance matches the club retained the white shirts, with a change kit of dark blue shirts and black knickers. By 1891 the club was wearing all blue.

==Ground==

The club played at the Blue House Field in Hendon, Sunderland. The ground had a track and stands, all of which were sold on the club&#x27;s liquidation.

<doc id="596114" wikidata="Q1753595" url="?curid=596114" title="Grey Goose (vodka)">
<text>Grey Goose is a brand of vodka produced in France. It was created in the 90s by American businessman Sidney Frank, who sold it to the multinational company Bacardi in 2004. The &quot;Maître de Chai&quot; for Grey Goose is François Thibault, who developed the original recipe for the vodka in Cognac, France.

==Company history==
Grey Goose was created by Sidney Frank Importing Co (SFIC). Sidney Frank, founder/CEO of the company, developed the idea in the summer of 1997. SFIC partnered with cognac producer François Thibault (a French &quot;Maître de Chai&quot;, or, Cellar Master) in France to transition his skills from cognac to vodka production.

The company selected France due to the country&#x27;s culinary history and it was to differentiate itself from other vodkas produced in Eastern Europe. The company also developed its distinctive smoked glass bottle, featuring French geese in flight and delivered its product in wooden crates similar to wine.

In 1998, the Beverage Testing Institute reviewed Grey Goose Vodka, which was the highest-scoring brand with a 96. In 2001, Grey Goose released its first flavor, L&#x27;Orange, followed by Le Citron in 2002.

The company was eventually sold by Sidney Frank to Bacardi for a reported US$2.2 billion in 2004. That year, Grey Goose was the best-selling premium brand vodka in the United States, selling more than 1.5 million cases that year.

In 2018, Grey Goose partnered with Jamie Foxx for a nine-part online series called &quot;Off Script&quot;. It is the official vodka of the US Open tennis tournament, and is the key ingredient in the &quot;honey deuce,&quot; the signature drink of the tournament.

==Product description ==

The wheat used in the creation of Grey Goose vodka is grown in Picardy, France. It is distilled in the Northeast of Paris, then sent to Cognac, France. Once received, the distillate is blended with a mix of spring and bottled water. Grey Goose uses soft winter wheat, sown in October and harvested in August, which provides it with four additional months of growth in comparison to summer wheat.

Even though Grey Goose distills its vodka from wheat, it is gluten-free. The distillation process removes the gluten from the final product.

During the distilling process, Grey Goose uses enzymes to break down carbohydrates into fermentable sugars. The fermentation takes place continuously over six cascading tanks, producing a 20-proof beer. The wash is then distilled into spirits using a five-step process. The water used in the vodka comes from a natural spring 150 meters (500 feet) below the blending facility in Cognac, which is lined with limestone, providing calcium-rich spring water. That water is then filtered to remove impurities. After the filtration, the vodka is bottled in a plant. Grey Goose vodka is bottled with a replaceable cork rather than a screw-top cap.

<text>The seasonal year is the time between successive recurrences of a seasonal event such as the flooding of a river, the migration of a species of bird, or the flowering of a species of plant.

The need for farmers to predict seasonal events led to the development of calendars. However, the variability from year to year of seasonal events (due to climate change or just random variation) makes the seasonal year very hard to measure. This means that calendars are based on astronomical years (which are regular enough to be easily measured) as surrogates for the seasonal year. For example, the ancient Egyptians used the heliacal rising of Sirius to predict the flooding of the Nile.

A study of temperature records over the past 300 years suggests that the seasonal year is governed by the anomalistic year rather than the tropical year.
This suggestion is surprising because the seasons have been thought to be governed by the tilt of the Earth&#x27;s axis (see Effect of sun angle on climate). The two types of years differ by a mere 4 days over 300 years, so Thompson&#x27;s result may not be significant. However, the result is not unreasonable. The seasons can be considered to be an oscillating system driven by two inputs with slightly different frequencies: the total input of energy from the sun varies with the anomalistic year, while the distribution of this energy between the hemispheres varies with the tropical year. In other physical situations, oscillating systems driven by two similar frequencies can latch onto either one. One point that must be considered is that the oscillation arising from the tilt of the axis is much greater than that arising from the distance of the sun.

<text>The Whales of August is a 1987 American drama film directed by Lindsay Anderson and adapted by David Berry from his play of the same name. It stars Bette Davis and Lillian Gish, the latter in her final film appearance, as elderly sisters living on the Maine coast. The cast also features Vincent Price and Ann Sothern. It was the final film appearance for both Gish (who was 93-years old at the time of filming) and Sothern, and the second-to-last appearance of Davis.

The film was released by Alive Films on October 16, 1987. It received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, although the performances of the cast were universally praised. Gish won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress, and Sothern earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the 60th Academy Awards. The film was also nominated for three Independent Spirit Awards.

==Plot==
Libby and Sarah Logan are two elderly, widowed sisters from Philadelphia. Near the end of their lives, they spend their annual summer in a seaside house in Maine. Their surroundings cause them to recall their relationship as young women, and the summers they had enjoyed there in the past. They reflect on the passage of time, and the bitterness, jealousies and misunderstandings that slowly festered over the years and kept them from establishing a true closeness in their relationship.

Libby is the more infirm of the two sisters, and her nature has become bitter and cold as a result. Sarah is a softer and more tolerant character, intent on nursing her sister through her discomfort and trying to breach the gulf that has grown between them. The resentment that Libby so clearly displays to her stifles Sarah&#x27;s every attempt at making a friendly overture towards her, and Sarah cautiously retreats.

Nicholas Maranov is an expatriate from Russia who comes to visit the sisters, and who has recently lost the friend with whom he had been living. Tisha is a vivacious lifelong friend who provides common sense, fun and laughter, and is the catalyst for some of the sisters&#x27; conversations and revelations.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film&#x27;s producer, Mike Kaplan, saw the play performed by the Trinity Repertory Company while he was visiting Rhode Island on family business. Kaplan, who had met Gish many years earlier when he was a publicist involved in &quot;The Comedians&quot; (1967), decided immediately that the role of Sarah Webber was a role that would introduce new generations of filmgoers to the great talent of the &quot;First Lady of American Film&quot;, who had begun her film career 75 years earlier, in 1912. This was to be the final film role for the 93-year-old Gish; she died in 1993 at the age of 99. It was also to be Sothern&#x27;s final acting role.

As opposed to the original stage production, the film made it possible to showcase stars who were the age peers of the characters. Actors and actresses of the appropriate age and stature were contacted to see whether they were both interested in and physically capable of playing the roles. Many screen greats were approached to play a role but demurred because they suffered from various infirmities, including Shirley Booth, Barbara Stanwyck, Fred Astaire and Paul Henreid. Gish and Davis were both infirm: Davis had recently recovered from several strokes which inhibited movement on the left side of her body, and Gish was somewhat hard of hearing. Other greats turned down the producers&#x27; overtures for other reasons, including Joel McCrea, Frances Dee, Katharine Hepburn and John Gielgud. Gielgud initially accepted the role and even attended early rehearsals but was replaced by Vincent Price before filming began. Even Davis and Gish turned down the parts more than once before being persuaded to star in the film.

This film marks a reunion between Davis and Price after 48 years, having last appeared on screen together in &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; in 1939.

Gish and Davis did not get along during the filming. Davis demanded top billing on the picture, of which Gish said, &quot;Oh dear, I just can&#x27;t deal with that sort of thing. I don&#x27;t care what they do with my name. If they leave it off, so much the better. It&#x27;s the work I love, not the glory.&quot; Davis got leftmost billing, which was considered optimal, with Gish&#x27;s name slightly higher. Gish recalled that Davis rarely spoke to her or looked at her except when the script required. Though Gish was hurt, she was sympathetic due to Davis&#x27;s illness. &quot;That face! Have you ever seen such a tragic face? Poor woman! How she must be suffering! I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to judge a person like that. We must bear and forbear.&quot; For her part, Davis was frustrated with Gish&#x27;s missing her cues: &quot;Miss Gish was stone deaf. She couldn’t have heard the cues if I’d shouted them through a bullhorn.&quot; However, Gish admitted she actually had little trouble hearing her cues, but invented a subtle version of the silent treatment due to Davis&#x27;s mistreatment of her. When Davis spoke a line, Gish often would look puzzled and gently protest: &quot;I just can&#x27;t hear what she&#x27;s saying.&quot; Whereupon, while Davis sat seething, Anderson would repeat Davis&#x27;s line in a ringing voice, and Gish would instantly pick up her cue and continue the scene.

David Berry (the screenwriter), Lindsay Anderson (the director), the cinematographer, a location scout, and Kaplan traveled by water taxi to several islands in Casco Bay searching for a location that would provide the necessary ambiance and ocean vistas for the film. In the end, the film was shot on Cliff Island, a few miles from the site of Berry&#x27;s family cottage on Peaks Island, where, in fact, the characters and story were drawn.

== Release ==
The film&#x27;s premiere in New York City on October 14, 1987, Gish&#x27;s 94th birthday, was followed a few weeks later by a premiere in Portland, Maine, which was attended by both Berry and Kaplan.

==Reception==
Reviews for &quot;The Whales of August&quot; were mixed to positive. The plot and script were seen as underwhelming, with its major redeeming quality being the performances of Gish, Davis and Sothern. On Rotten Tomatoes out of 11 critics, 64% of them gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 6.63 out of 10. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 stars.

Although the film starred two preeminent actresses in what was close to their final film roles, it was not a substantial commercial success domestically. Upon its release, it was widely tipped that either Davis or Gish would be rewarded, if not for their performances in this film then for their longevity, with Academy Award nominations, but neither actress was nominated. As it turned out, the one Academy Award nomination for the film went to Sothern (in her final film performance) for Best Supporting Actress, her first and only nomination in her lengthy career. Gish received the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress. The film was screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival, which Gish attended, and she got a 10-minute standing ovation.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;The Whales of August&quot; as one of his favorite films.

<doc id="596127" wikidata="Q1224723" url="?curid=596127" title="Digital Data Storage">
<text>Digital Data Storage (DDS) is a computer data storage technology that is based upon the Digital Audio Tape (DAT) format that was developed during the 1980s. DDS is primarily intended for use as off-line storage, especially for generating backup copies of working data.

== Design ==
A DDS cartridge uses tape with a width of 3.81mm, with the exception of the latest formats, DAT-160 and DAT-320, both which use 8mm wide tape. Initially, the tape was 60 meters (197 feet) or 90 meters (295 ft.) in length. Advancements in materials technology have allowed the length to be increased significantly in successive versions. A DDS tape drive uses helical scan recording, the same process used by a video cassette recorder (VCR).

Backward compatibility between newer drives and older cartridges is not assured; the compatibility matrices provided by manufacturers will need to be consulted. Typically drives can read and write tapes in the prior generation format, with most (but not all) also able to read and write tapes from two generations prior. Notice in HP&#x27;s article that newer tape standards do not simply consist of longer tapes; with DDS-2, for example, the track was narrower than with DDS-1.

At one time, DDS competed against the Linear Tape-Open (LTO), Advanced Intelligent Tape (AIT), VXA, and Travan formats. However, AIT, Travan and VXA are no longer mainstream, and the capacity of LTO has far exceeded that of the most recent DDS standard, DDS-320.

== History ==


; DDS-1: Stores up to 1.3 GB uncompressed (2.6 GB compressed) on a 60 m cartridge or 2 GB uncompressed (4 GB compressed) on a 90 m cartridge. The DDS-1 cartridge often does not have the -1 designation, as initially it was the only format, though cartridges produced since the introduction of DDS-2 may carry a -1 designation to distinguish the format from newer formats. A media recognition system was introduced with DDS-2 drives and cartridges to detect the medium type and prevent the loading of an improper medium. From 1993, DDS-1 tapes included the media recognition system marks on the leader tape—a feature indicated by the presence of four vertical bars after the DDS logo.
; DDS-2: Stores up to 4 GB uncompressed (8 GB compressed) on a 120 m cartridge.
; DDS-3: Stores up to 12 GB uncompressed (24 GB compressed) on a 125 m cartridge. DDS-3 uses PRML (Partial Response Maximum Likelihood) to minimize electronic noise for a cleaner data recording.
; DDS-4: DDS-4 stores up to 20 GB uncompressed (40 GB compressed) on a 150 m cartridge. This format is also called DAT 40.
; DAT 72: DAT 72 stores up to 36 GB uncompressed (72 GB compressed) on a 170 m cartridge. The DAT 72 standard was developed by HP and Certance. It has the same form-factor as DDS-3 and -4 and is sometimes referred to as DDS-5.
; DAT 160: DAT 160 was launched in June 2007 by HP, stores up to 80 GB uncompressed (160 GB compressed). A major change from the previous generations is the width of the tape. DAT 160 uses 8 mm wide tape in a slightly thicker cartridge while all prior versions use 3.81 mm wide tape. Despite the difference in tape widths, DAT 160 drives can load DAT-72 and DAT-40 (DDS-4) cartridges. Native capacity is 80 GB and native transfer rate was raised to 6.9 MB/s, mostly due to prolonging head/tape contact to 180° (compared to 90° previously). Launch interfaces were Parallel SCSI and USB, with SAS interface released later.
; DAT 320: In November 2009 HP announced the DAT-320 standard, which stores up to 160 GB uncompressed (marketed as 320 GB assuming 2:1 compression) per cartridge. Native transfer rate was raised to 12 MB/s.

=== Future ===
The next format, Gen 8, was canceled.

A member of the Liberal Party, he was the member of Parliament (MP) for Halifax West 2000 to 2021, previously holding the seat from 1993 to 1997. Under Paul Martin, he was Minister of Fisheries and Oceans from 2003 to 2006.

==Early life and career==
Regan was born in Windsor, Nova Scotia. He is the son of Gerald Regan, the 19th premier of Nova Scotia and Cabinet Minister under Pierre Trudeau, and Carole Harrison, the daughter of John Harrison, a member of Parliament from Saskatchewan. He is the brother of Nancy Regan, a retired television personality with ATV, and Laura Regan, an actress.

Regan graduated from Sackville High School in 1977 and then earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from St. Francis Xavier University in 1980. Following university, Regan went on to earn a law degree from Dalhousie University, graduating in 1983. He was admitted to the Nova Scotia Barristers’ Society in 1984 and practiced real estate and commercial law before entering public life.

Regan was a member of Toastmasters for almost ten years, in the late 1980s to early 1990s.

==Federal politics==
Regan was first elected to the House of Commons as part of the Liberal victory in the 1993 federal election under Jean Chrétien. He was defeated in the 1997 election by NDP candidate Gordon Earle, mainly because of the federal government&#x27;s changes to employment insurance.

After regaining his seat in the 2000 federal election, Regan was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, a position then held by Don Boudria. In 2003, Paul Martin appointed him as Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.

Regan was the Regional Minister for Nova Scotia in the newly formed government of Paul Martin, sworn in on 12 December 2003. Regan was re-elected in the 2004 federal election. He would keep position in cabinet in Martin’s minority government. In February 2004, Regan was appointed to act as Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, in matters related to Maher Arar.

=== In opposition ===
Upon the defeat of the Liberal government in the 2006 election, he was appointed by Bill Graham, Interim Leader of the Official Opposition, to the shadow cabinet as the Official Opposition Critic for Human Resources and Skills Development. During his time as critic, Regan introduced a private members’ bill to expand Canada Access Grants for disabled and low income students. In January 2007, he was appointed to the newly created Liberal Priorities and Planning Committee, which was chaired by then Liberal Opposition Leader Stéphane Dion. In March 2008, Regan was named Chair of the Caucus Committee on Environmental Sustainability. Regan also served as Vice-Chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development.

Regan was re-elected in 2008, and 2011 federal elections, despite significant Liberal losses in both. Regan won his seat by a few percentage points in the latter election as the Liberals finished in third place. Under the leadership of Stephane Dion, Regan served as Opposition Critic for Human Resources and Skills Development. Under Michael Ignatieff, Regan served as Liberal Critic for Natural Resources, and later, Public Works and Government Services and also as the Liberal Natural Resources Critic under leader Justin Trudeau and the Vice-Chair of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources.

=== Speaker of the House of Commons ===
Regan was re-elected in the 2015 federal election with 68% of the vote as the Liberal party swept all 32 Atlantic Canada seats and formed a majority government. On 2 December 2015, Regan was selected as Speaker of the House of Commons in secret ballot by members of the 42nd Parliament over Liberals Denis Paradis and Yasmin Ratansi and Conservative Bruce Stanton. Regan won on the first ballot and served as the first speaker from Atlantic Canada in almost a hundred years. In December 2019, he ran for re-election for Speaker of the Commons but lost to fellow Liberal MP Anthony Rota. Following Rota&#x27;s win, the Conservatives said that he had them to thank for his new position. They had made the decision during a caucus meeting to unseat Regan as a show of strength to the Liberal minority government.

On March 31, 2021, Regan announced that he would not seek re-election.

<text>My Mother&#x27;s Keeper is a 1985 memoir by B. D. Hyman, the daughter of actress Bette Davis, in which she alleges that Davis was a bullying, alcoholic mother.

==Overview==
&quot;My Mother&#x27;s Keeper&quot; is often compared to the 1978 book &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; by Christina Crawford, the daughter of Bette&#x27;s off-screen rival, Joan Crawford. Published after Crawford&#x27;s book, &quot;My Mother&#x27;s Keeper&quot; depicts Davis as a self-centered, emotionally manipulative alcoholic. Unlike Crawford, Hyman does not accuse her mother of any physical abuse. Indeed, she claims Davis was a battered wife and says Davis&#x27;s husband, Gary Merrill, was a violent alcoholic. Unlike Crawford&#x27;s book, which was published after the death of its subject, Hyman&#x27;s book and a sequel titled &quot;Narrow Is the Way&quot; were published during Davis&#x27;s lifetime.

==Reception==
Gary Merrill called Hyman&#x27;s motivation &quot;cruelty and greed&quot;. Davis&#x27;s adopted son, Michael Merrill, severed contact with Hyman and never spoke to her again, as did Davis, who disinherited her. Davis left her estate to Michael Merrill and her assistant, Kathryn Sermak. Davis&#x27;s only public response to the allegations was an open letter to Hyman in her 1987 memoir, &quot;This &#x27;N That&quot;, in which she wrote in part, &quot;Your book is a glaring lack of loyalty and thanks for the very privileged life I feel you have been given. If my memory serves me right, I’ve been your keeper all these many years.&quot;

<text>Wembley Arena () (originally the Empire Pool, currently known as [[OVO Energy|OVO]] Arena Wembley for sponsorship reasons) is an indoor arena next to Wembley Stadium in Wembley, Greater London, England. The 12,500-seat facility is Greater London&#x27;s second-largest indoor arena after the O2 Arena, and the ninth-largest in the United Kingdom.

The Empire Pool (also known as Empire Pool and Sports Arena) was built for the 1934 British Empire Games by Arthur Elvin. As its original name suggested, it was where the games&#x27; swimming events were held. The pool was last used for the 1948 Summer Olympics. The modern arena is now used as a venue for music, comedy, family entertainment and sport.

==History==

The building was designed by the engineer Sir Owen Williams, without the employment of an architect. Williams built a unique structure, with cantilevers meeting in the middle, thus avoiding the need for internal pillars. He also used high quality concrete, meaning that it has aged far better than many more recent concrete buildings. The building had a reinforced concrete frame of three hinged arches spanning , which was the largest concrete span of any similar structure in the world at that time.

Work on the Empire Pool began in November 1933, and it was opened on 25 July 1934 by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. The swimming pool itself was long and wide with a removable deck for ice skating. As with the adjacent stadium, construction was supervised by R.J. Fowler, Wembley&#x27;s chief building inspector. The end of the building opened up and led to sunbathing terraces and lawns. The sides had 15 massive concrete buttresses and the tops of the ends were glazed with 20 narrow window lights of increasing height from the edges to the centre.

Ice hockey was introduced to the Empire Pool in October 1934.

In 1940 the Empire Pool was used to billet several hundred Gibraltarian evacuees who were removed from Gibraltar as the Fortress was extensively reinforced in expectation of heavy Axis attack and possible Invasion. 

In October 1976, the Empire Pool was awarded Grade II Listed status, protecting it and recognising it as a building of special architectural interest, technological innovation and virtuosity. On 1 February 1978, the Empire Pool was renamed Wembley Arena.

When the venue was known as the Empire Pool, it hosted the annual NME Poll Winners Concerts during the mid-1960s. Audiences of 10,000 viewed acts like the Beatles, Cliff Richard &amp; The Shadows, the Monkees, the Hollies, Dusty Springfield, Joe Brown &amp; the Bruvvers, and Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; Tich. The individual performances were then finished by a famous personality joining the respective performer on stage and presenting them with their award. The Beatles were presented with one of their awards by actor Roger Moore, and Joe Brown was joined on stage by Roy Orbison who presented him with his own award. These ceremonies were filmed, recorded and later broadcast on television.

Musical acts who subsequently performed there include Led Zeppelin (who played a special two night &quot;Electric Magic&quot; concert during their 1971 Winter Tour; the poster for the event, designed by Steve Hardcastle, sold on the night for 30p, has become a collectors item, fetching over £500 at auction), T. Rex (whose Ringo Starr-directed documentary film &quot;Born to Boogie&quot; is centred on a 1972 concert at the Empire Pool), Genesis, David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, Bon Jovi, INXS, Pink Floyd (who played there on their 1974 British Winter tour and 1977 &quot;In the Flesh&quot; tour), Roxy Music (played two nights there - 17 &amp; 18 October 1975 - on their Siren tour), The Eagles (on their Hotel California 1978 tour), the Grateful Dead, Dire Straits (who played there on their &quot;Brothers In Arms&quot; tour in 1985 (13 consecutive nights) and &quot;On Every Street&quot; tour in 1991), Status Quo, Queen and the Who, 

===Renovation===
The venue was renovated, along with Wembley Stadium, as part of the early-21st-century regeneration of the Wembley Park area. The arena was closed for fourteen months, starting in February 2005, for a refurbishment costing £35 million; events were moved to a neighbouring temporary 10,000-seat venue, the Wembley Arena Pavilion. The new arena opened to the public on 2 April 2006, with a concert by Depeche Mode. The temporary pavilion was moved to Attard, Malta, opening as the permanent Malta Fairs &amp; Conventions Centre in December 2006.

In September 2013, it was announced that AEG Facilities had signed a 15-year contract to operate the arena.
The building was renamed The SSE Arena on 1 June 2014 after energy company SSE plc bought the naming rights to the venue for 10 years.

Since early 2022 it has been known as OVO Arena Wembley.

===Returning acts===

The Grateful Dead have released recordings of complete shows from 7–8 April 1972 as part of &quot;Europe &#x27;72: The Complete Recordings&quot;.

After the tour, the members of the band talked about the warmth of the Wembley audience. &quot;It was like coming home after a couple of nights,&quot; said guitarist Björn Ulvaeus. A finale from these concerts, &quot;The Way Old Friends Do&quot;, is the closing track on ABBA&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Super Trouper&quot;. Vocalist Agnetha Fältskog said it was the vibe from the audience that made the track work so much better as a live performance than as a studio track.

George Dalaras performed a sold-out concert at Wembley Arena on 27 June 1992. It is the biggest Greek concert ever held in United Kingdom. It was a personal initiative of George Dalaras in order to support Cyprus and to promote the Cyprus problem. Among others, Vanessa Redgrave and Georges Moustaki had taken part in the concert.

==Square of Fame==

With the reopening of Wembley Arena in 2006, a &quot;Square of Fame&quot; area has been created in front of the arena. Similar to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, notable Wembley Arena performers are invited to have bronze plaques imprinted with their names and handprints. The first star to have a plaque was Madonna, on 1 August 2006. On 9 November 2006, Cliff Richard added his handprints to the Square. Rick Parfitt and Francis Rossi, of Status Quo, unveiled a plaque, with one of each of their handprints, on 16 December 2006. On 9 January 2007, Kylie Minogue included her handprints, on the final day of the London leg of her Showgirl Homecoming Tour.

Seven time World Snooker Champion Stephen Hendry added his handprints on 21 January 2007. International country superstar Dolly Parton unveiled her plaque, on the final night of her UK tour, on 25 March 2007. Canadian musician Bryan Adams unveiled his plaque, on 10 May 2007, just before his 25th appearance at the venue. Just three days later, singer Lionel Richie was presented with his plaque on 13 May 2007, after another sold-out performance at the arena. Irish boyband Westlife unveiled their plaque on 28 March 2008, after 27 sell-out shows, in the space of 10 years. They have sold 250,000 tickets. All four members, Shane Filan, Nicky Byrne, Kian Egan and Mark Feehily were presented with a cast of their hands, which can also be seen in the Square of Fame. Alice Cooper added his handprints in 2012 as the only solo artist to have headlined at the venue in each of the past five consecutive decades.

==Transport==
Wembley Arena is served by Wembley Park station on the London Underground via Olympic Way, and Wembley Central station via the White Horse Bridge.

Train services are operated by Chiltern Railways from Wembley Stadium station to London Marylebone and Birmingham. London Buses routes 92 and 440 stop directly outside the arena. Wembley Central station is located nearby on High Road and is served by London Overground, London Underground, Southern and London Northwestern Railway services.

The onsite parking facility is shared with Wembley Stadium, essentially being the open-air surface parking surrounding the eastern flank of Wembley Stadium and the multistorey car park. These are called Green Car Park and Red Car Park respectively. There is disabled parking available onsite, at the Green Car Park, at a reduced rate but on a first-come, first-served basis.

<doc id="596139" wikidata="Q6185770" url="?curid=596139" title="Jesmond Dene">
<text>Jesmond Dene, a public park in the east end of Newcastle upon Tyne, England, occupies the narrow steep-sided valley of a small river known as the Ouseburn, flowing south to join the River Tyne. In north-east England, such valleys are commonly known as denes; the name &#x27;Jesmond&#x27; meaning &#x27;mouth of the Ouseburn&#x27;.

Lord Armstrong and his wife, of the now-demolished Jesmond Dean house nearby, first laid out the park during the 1860s. The design is intended to reflect a rural setting, with woodland, crags, waterfalls and pools. Lord Armstrong gave the park, together with his Banqueting Hall, to the people of Newcastle in 1883 and the park opened to the public in the following year. It is now owned by Newcastle City Council. The current Jesmond Dene House adjoining the dene was the mansion of Armstrong&#x27;s business partner Andrew Noble. It is now a luxury hotel.

The (now closed to road traffic) iron-constructed Armstrong Bridge spans the south end of the Dene and hosts Jesmond Food Market every first and third Saturday of the month. The building of a replacement road and tunnel, the Cradlewell By-pass, was the subject of a road protest camp around 1993, due to the destruction of many 200-year-old trees.
Jesmond Dene contains a free-entry petting zoo known as &quot;Pets&#x27; Corner&quot;, which has been a popular family attraction since the 1960s.

Jesmond Dene is home to Newcastle&#x27;s oldest religious building, St Mary&#x27;s Chapel. The chapel, now in ruins, was once a site of much significance, attracting a great number of pilgrims.

The park is supported by a group called &#x27;Friends of Jesmond Dene&#x27; which provides funds for small projects to improve the park. There is also a group of Volunteer Rangers which carries out physical work tidying the paths, picking up litter, cutting back shrubs and other maintenance tasks.

The dawn chorus of Jesmond Dene has been professionally recorded and has been used in various workplace and hospital rehabilitation facilities.

In 2011, the field area and pets corner were redeveloped. The redevelopment included a new road and a bridge over the Ouseburn river.

In 2012, during excessively wet weather, a landslide occurred on the east side of the Dene, near the Old Mill. The landslide covered several footpaths running along the hillside.

In July 2014, the Old Mill in the Dene was vandalised with graffiti tags, which have since been removed.

On 1 April 2019, control and upkeep of Jesmond Dene, along with other Newcastle parks, was passed from Newcastle City Council to a newly created charitable trust, Urban Green Newcastle.

<text>H. J. Mulliner &amp; Co. was a well-known British coachbuilder operating from Bedford Park, Chiswick, West London. The company which owned it was formed by H J Mulliner in 1897 but the business was a continuing branch of a family business founded in Northampton in the 1760s to hire out carriages. In December 1909 the controlling interest in this company passed to John Croall &amp; Sons of Edinburgh. Croall sold that interest to Rolls-Royce in 1959.

&quot;Mulliner&quot; is now the personal commissioning department for Bentley.

==Henry Jervis Mulliner==

Henry Jervis Mulliner (1870–1967), born in Liverpool but raised in Chiswick, was the second son of Robert Bouverie Mulliner (1830–1902) from Northampton, third son of Francis Mulliner (1789–1841) of Leamington Spa and Northampton. Robert Bouverie Mulliner had first established a thriving coachbuilding business in Liverpool in the mid-1850s then sold that to his brother and in the early 1870s started another in Chiswick on the outskirts of London.

His son H. J. Mulliner incorporated his own company in 1897 while with Mulliner London Limited. He found a special interest in the automobile side of that business and expanded in 1900 by buying from Mulliner London Limited the Mulliner showroom in Brook Street, Mayfair, London. The location was more convenient for his clients than Chiswick. One of the early clients was C.S. Rolls who had a body built on a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost for his own use.

==John Croall &amp; Sons Edinburgh==

In 1906 the London works were moved from Mayfair to Chiswick and in December 1909 H J Mulliner sold a controlling interest in the company to John Croall &amp; Sons of Edinburgh. A family connection was maintained as Croall employed H J Mulliner&#x27;s wife&#x27;s brother, Frank Piesse (1885–1960), to run the company.

Although bodies were fitted to other chassis, by the 1930s virtually the entire output was being fitted to Rolls-Royce and Bentleys.

==Rolls-Royce==

Rolls-Royce acquired Mulliner in July 1959 and merged it with Park Ward which they had owned since 1939 forming Mulliner Park Ward in 1961. A financial columnist noted that the (cash) outlay for Rolls-Royce was relatively small as the net assets of John Croall were around £250,000. It was noted that Mulliner was one of the last independent coach builders, others being controlled by motor manufacturers or distributors.

<doc id="596156" wikidata="Q50988419" url="?curid=596156" title="Q&amp;A comedy website">
<text>A Q&amp;A website is a website where the site creators use the images of pop culture icons, historical figures, fictional characters, or even inanimate objects or abstract concepts to answer input from the site&#x27;s visitors, usually in question/answer format. This format of website, most popular in the early 2000s, evolved from the much older Internet Oracle. The original progenitor of this type of site was the now-defunct &quot;Forum 2000&quot;. The Forum 2000 claimed to have run the site by means of artificial intelligence, and the personalities on the website were called SOMADs, or &quot;State Of Mind Adjointness pairs&quot;. However, later Q&amp;A sites usually dispensed with this pretense, with the most extreme example being Jerk Squad!, on which the administrators of the site provide many of the answers.

==Individual Site Descriptions==

===The Conversatron===
The Conversatron, which began to take questions December 12, 1999, was first to break the Forum 2000&#x27;s format. The Conversatron made it clear that the site was not run by artificial intelligence, and it called the site&#x27;s personalities &quot;Askees&quot;, in contrast to the visitors, called &quot;Askers&quot;. The Conversatron stated in a thread that it would be &quot;going down for permanent maintenance&quot; at some time in early 2005, but that it may be supplanted by something &quot;different, but still the same.&quot; Since that time, the site has been back and forth, sometimes being replaced with the cryptic message, &quot;So, web huh.&quot;

===The True Meaning of Life===
More commonly referred to by its acronym TMOL, the site was originally started in early 2000 as a version of Forum 2000 and The Conversatron, but one that focused on the idea that videogames reflected a deep, self-actualizing message that could improve one&#x27;s life. The conceit of the site was that it evangelized this videogame-centric, pseudo-Buddhist philosophy via a &quot;Virtual Meditation Chamber&quot;, where the site&#x27;s visitors, or &quot;Supplicants&quot;, would ask for the advice or the opinion of the &quot;Gurus&quot;. Headed by the fictional &quot;lead Guru wrangler&quot;, The Seeker, TMOL ran from July 2000 – January 2004, and the best-of archive of this run is still available online.

===Forum 2010===
Initially something between a satire of and homage to the original Forum 2000, Forum 2010 made its debut on July 29, 2000. The site, which began as a college web project by Andrew Chinnici, used personas from regular patrons of the WTnet IRC channel &quot;#watertower&quot; in addition to &quot;celebrity&quot; personalities. A check of that site in May, 2012 took one to web host aspnix.com, whose online chat representative said could provide no further information about its client.

===QNA2K and QNA2K10===
QNA2K began in 2000 as an homage to Conversatron and True Meaning of Life. It was updated until late 2002, and was removed from the internet when Yahoo! removed the Geocities portion of its webhosting. Later, QNA2K10, a more modern interpretation of QNA2K, took its place. This site has since gone offline sometime around November 2012

===The Hateatron and the Ministry of Misanthropy===
The Hateatron went online January 15, 2002, at a time when many other Q&amp;A sites were springing up. The Hateatron ran on software written by its creator Safiire Arrowny and has gone through many different incarnations since its launch. The Hateatron&#x27;s defining factor was that aside from just answering questions with its characters, known as &quot;Haters,&quot; it had a fully integrated forum called the &quot;User Owned&quot; or UO Forum. The evolution of this kind of forum was a fluke, and it turned into an extension of the Q&amp;A format. The Haters who answered questions on the front page now sprang to life inside the UO Forum, interacting with the users who had become active in the community. The Hateatron sported a community and readership of over 100 regular users, organized a yearly convention called Hateakon, and answered nearly 5000 questions. Some time in early 2005, the Q&amp;A portion of the Hateatron was dropped from the front page of the site for unpublicized reasons. The rest of the site has since been decommissioned, although it is still occasionally updated with bizarre messages.

The Ministry of Misanthropy was the official successor to the Hateatron, launched July 26, 2005. The Ministry&#x27;s administrator was one of the former Hateatron users, and many of the other users also made the transition.

===The Conversawang and Wangcode===
Jason Nelson, creator of &quot;The Conversawang&quot;, released the PHP-based software used to run the site. The software, dubbed Wangcode, became open source under the GNU General Public License. Previously, the major impediment to creating a Q&amp;A website was that each site had its own unique, proprietary software. Once the code became available, numerous Q&amp;A sites sprouted up, many of them outliving the Conversawang. An example of a Wangcode-based site is &quot;Deuce Tre – Conspiratron&quot;.

Other Q&amp;A sites started out using Wangcode but ended up rewriting the entire back-end at one point or another. Jerk Squad launched an improved back-end in August 2004, though the code was not made publicly available. The back-end used for &quot;Ask Dr. Science&quot;, codenamed Beakertron was expected to be released under the GNU General Public License by its author, David Perry. However, several years have passed since its future availability was first announced.

<doc id="596160" wikidata="Q1611541" url="?curid=596160" title="Doctor Who season 23">
<text>The twenty-third season of British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, known collectively as The Trial of a Time Lord, aired in weekly episodes from 6 September to 6 December 1986. It contained four adventures: &quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot;, &quot;Mindwarp&quot;, &quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot; and &quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot;; the season also marked the final regular appearance of Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor.

The idea for the serial stemmed from several production changes to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, such as reduced screen time for the season and an instruction from BBC1 controller Michael Grade that the series needed to contain less violence and more humour. Several problems occurred during production, including the death of scriptwriter Robert Holmes and the resignation of script editor Eric Saward. When it ended, Baker was dismissed from the role, according to some sources on the orders of Grade, although he has denied this. John Nathan-Turner produced the series.

==Synopsis==
In the serial, the Sixth Doctor is tried by the High Council of Time Lords for breaking several of the laws of Gallifrey, the Time Lords&#x27; home world, including interference with outside worlds and genocide. A mysterious character called the Valeyard acts as prosecutor. In the first two chapters (&quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot; and &quot;Mindwarp&quot;) events from the Doctor&#x27;s past and present are submitted as evidence of his guilt. The third chapter (&quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot;) presents future events in the Doctor&#x27;s defence. In the concluding chapter (&quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot;) the Doctor&#x27;s trial is halted, and the Doctor confronts the Valeyard and his old rival, the Master, in order to clear his name and to save the High Council.

==Casting==
=== Main cast ===
* Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor
* Nicola Bryant as Peri Brown
* Bonnie Langford as Melanie Bush

Colin Baker makes his final appearance as the Doctor in this longest-running serial before being dismissed from the role by the BBC.
Nicola Bryant departs as Peri Brown in &quot;Mindwarp&quot;.
Bonnie Langford makes her debut as the Doctor&#x27;s future companion Melanie Bush in &quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot;.

===Recurring stars ===
* Michael Jayston as the Valeyard
* Lynda Bellingham as the Inquisitor
* Anthony Ainley as The Master
* Tony Selby as Sabalom Glitz

Michael Jayston and Lynda Bellingham both appeared throughout the whole serial. Tony Selby appeared in &quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot; and &quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot;, while Anthony Ainley returned as the Master in &quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot;.

==Serials==

The series remained at once-weekly Saturday broadcasts. All episodes were 25 minutes long, with the exception of Part 14, which ran for just under 30 minutes. This running time was the result of a plea by John Nathan-Turner to his superiors at the BBC that the serial&#x27;s final episode needed the additional three minutes to conclude the story properly. Although there were now 14 episodes in the season, the total running time was overall reduced since the episodes were just over half as long.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Preproduction==

===Original Season 23===

The change of format that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; had undergone in Season 22 (45-minute episodes, moving back to one episode per week on Saturday evenings) had been reasonably successful, with ratings around the 6–8 million mark. As such, the production team began preparations for Season 23 in the same format, with a total of 13 episodes spread over six stories, with five 2-episode serials and one of three episodes. A number of storylines were submitted, with six eventually being commissioned between September 1984 and February 1985. However, in the latter month, the BBC announced that, as a cost-cutting measure owing to the costs of several large projects (not least of which was the launch of &quot;EastEnders&quot;), Season 23 was being put back from its planned transmission in January 1986 to the following September, which would be a different financial year.

====Planned serials====
===Revised Season 23===

Although &quot;Doctor Who&quot; had been recommissioned, it yet again underwent a format change, with episodes reduced in length back to 25 minutes, and the full season running to only 14 episodes (a total of 350 minutes&#x27; running time), which worked out at almost half the total of Season 22. As a consequence, the production team were forced to abandon the various serials that had been commissioned for the original Season 23, and instead come up with something new. John Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward eventually came up with the idea of having the various serials linked with an overarching narrative—this led to the conception of a trial story with &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;-inspired &quot;past, present, and future&quot; storyline, thereby stretching the length of the season. The planned 14-part serial was intended to be divided into a pair of 4-part stories followed by a 6-part one. By July 1985, the characters of the Valeyard, the Inquisitor and Mel were conceived.

==Production==
Robert Holmes was commissioned to write the first and final chapters of the serial. His draft of the first chapter, &quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot;, was criticised by BBC Head of Series and Serials, Jonathan Powell, for its comedic content, contradicting the BBC controller&#x27;s request for a more humorous series – which took away confidence from Holmes.

The second chapter, &quot;Mindwarp&quot;, was written by Philip Martin. The main villain of the serial was Sil, introduced in &quot;Vengeance on Varos&quot; (1985). Sil was selected due to his popularity among the production team who asked Martin to feature the character in the ultimately-cancelled story &quot;Mission to Magnus&quot;. Nathan-Turner asked Martin to include Sil in his chapter, and asked confidentially for Peri to be killed in accordance with Bryant&#x27;s wishes to leave the show with a bang.

The third chapter was originally to be interlinked with the fourth. Holmes was originally asked to write it, but declined, citing a dislike of six-part serials. After rejecting submissions by Christopher H. Bidmead and PJ Hammond, Nathan-Turner approached husband-and-wife writing team Pip and Jane Baker to write a studio-based serial, &quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot;.

Holmes was unable to finish writing the fourth chapter, originally called &quot;Time Inc.&quot;, before his death from a liver illness and Hepatitis B on 24 May 1986, aged 59. The Bakers were commissioned by Nathan-Turner, at short notice, to write a new version of the episode, after script editor Eric Saward withdrew his permission for his original version of Part 14 to be used: the original ending would have featured a fight to the death in a time vent, between the Doctor and the Valeyard, as part of a cliff-hanger ending to the season, which horrified Nathan-Turner, as he feared that to use such a downbeat ending would have provided an excuse for the BBC management to cancel the series altogether. Subsequently, the title was later changed to &quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot;.

Filming of the serial began on 7 April 1986 and ended on 14 August that year. For the opening sequence, Nathan-Turner commissioned a 45-second model shot that cost over , which at that time was the highest amount of money spent on a single special-effects sequence in the history of the series. The outdoor sequences in &quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot; were filmed in mid-April in Queen Elizabeth Country Park, and studio work followed on 24 April and 10 May. Studio work for &quot;Mindwarp&quot; took place from 27 to 29 May and 11–13 June, and location shots were filmed in Brighton from 15 to 16 June. &quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot; and &quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot; were produced simultaneously; production began with location filming for the latter in late June, before returning to the studio to film scenes for both chapters on 16–17 July. &quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot; was the last chapter to be completed, with studio work taking place from 30 July–1 August and from 12 to 14 August.

==Reception and analysis==
Public reaction to &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; was mixed. Although the Audience Appreciation figures had improved since the previous season — the lowest figure was 66% for Parts Seven and Nine and the highest was 72% for Parts One, Four and Eight.— the viewing figures were lower.

===Reviews===
&quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; received mixed reviews from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; critics. Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, co-authors of &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot;, wrote that as a whole, the serial&#x27;s plot &#x27;hangs together remarkably well&#x27;. David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker, authors of &quot;Doctor Who: The Television Companion&quot;, disagreed, arguing that the serial was a &#x27;monumental wasted opportunity&#x27;. They disapproved of the trial storyline, being unconvinced that a prosecutor &#x27;in any reasonable legal system&#x27; would be allowed to modify charges and court proceedings mid-trial. However, they did find the meta-humour of &#x27;the Doctor effectively sitting down to watch &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for fourteen weeks&#x27; amusing if repetitive, and praised Baker&#x27;s acting. Both reviews found that the trial scenes detracted from the chapter story arcs.

Reviews of the individual chapters were also mixed. Although appreciative of the acting of Brian Blessed in &quot;Mindwarp&quot;, Cornell, Day and Topping argued that the script lacked focus, &#x27;[trying] to be comic, grotesque, straight, and farcical all at the same time&#x27;. Howe and Walker were more favourable towards the script, citing the re-appearance of Sil as positive, and hailing Peri&#x27;s off-screen death as &#x27;one of the most dramatic and impressive moments of the entire season&#x27; and Bryant&#x27;s best scene since &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;. Both reviews judged &quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot; to be a well-written story, although Cornell, Day and Topping criticised the dialogue, and Howe and Walker were unimpressed by Bonnie Langford in her performance as Melanie Bush.

==Broadcast==
&quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; was broadcast from 6 September to 6 December 1986.

== Home media ==
=== VHS releases ===
=== DVD and Blu-ray releases ===

==Notes==
* Although the following serial &quot;Time and the Rani&quot; was the Sixth Doctor&#x27;s final appearance, Baker declined an offer to return either for the entire story (as originally offered) or solely for a regeneration scene, and the part was instead portrayed by Sylvester McCoy wearing a blond wig.

<doc id="596161" wikidata="Q814254" url="?curid=596161" title="Feature (archaeology)">
<text>In archaeological excavation, a feature is a collection of one or more contexts representing some human non-portable activity, such as a hearth or wall. Features serve as an indication that the area in which they are found has been interfered with in the past, usually by humans.

Features are distinguished from artifacts in that they cannot be separated from their location without changing their form. Artifacts are portable, while features are non-portable. Artifacts and features can both be made from any available material, with the primary distinction being portability.

Features and artifacts differ from ecofacts. Ecofacts are natural remains, such as plants and animals.

== Types ==
Features are categorized by the time period, as either historic or prehistoric. Prehistoric archaeology refers to the time in history before human life was recorded or documented, while historic archaeology refers to the time period where there was a documented human past.

In relation to site stratigraphy, features generally have a vertical characteristic, such as pits, walls, or ditches. On the contrary, elements that have horizontal characteristic, such as a layer, dump, or surface, is &quot;not&quot; a feature. General horizontal elements are part of the stratigraphic sequence.
Features tend to have an intrusive characteristic or associated cuts. This is not definitive as surfaces can be referred to as features of a building and free standing structures with no construction cut can still be features. Middens (dump deposits) are also referred to as features due to their discrete boundaries. This is seen in comparison to leveling dumps, which stretch out over a substantial portion of a site. The concept of a feature is, to a certain degree, abstract, as it will change depending on the scale of excavation.

==Context==
Features have a specific stratigraphic context as well as helping to provide details of context for artifacts. Often times an artifact&#x27;s provenience can be defined in part by the feature it is associated with (if such a feature exists). In circumstances where a stratigraphic layer cannot be defined by soil color or consistency, such as in the excavation of several features such as wells or cisterns, arbitrary layers can be defined by an archaeologist based on equal levels of depth, allowing for the categorization of artifacts based on relative placement within a feature.

== Examples ==
Features specific to certain architecture types or eras such as trilithon for the purposes of this article are not considered generic. Generic features are feature types that can come from a broad section in time of the archaeological record if not all of it. Generic types can include: 
#Cuts
#Re-cuts
#Pits
#Post holes
#Stake holes
#Construction cuts
#Robber trenches
#Walls
#Foundations
#Ditches
#Drains
#Wells
#Cisterns
#Hearths
#Stairs and steps
#Enclosures
#Lynchets
#Graves
#Burials
#Middens
#Pit-houses
#Fire pits

<text>The Mysterious Planet is the first serial of the larger narrative known as &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; which encompasses the whole of the 23rd season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 6 to 27 September 1986. The title &quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot; is not used on-screen and only appears in the serial&#x27;s scripts with the four episodes that comprise the story being transmitted as &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; Parts One to Four.

In the serial, the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) is put on trial by his own people, the Time Lords, accused of meddling in the affairs of Earth far in the future, when it has been renamed Ravolox and relocated light years from its original location. Much of the story consists of video testimony presented by the prosecutor the Valeyard (Michael Jayston) of the Doctor attempting to stop the robot Drathro from causing an explosion that would threaten the entire universe.

==Plot==

Events of the serial are framed on an arcing plot that carries through the other three serials of the 23rd season. In this, the Sixth Doctor is forced to land the TARDIS aboard a Gallifreyan space station, where he is brought into a courtroom. The Inquisitor informs the Doctor he is on trial for conduct unbecoming a Time Lord; evidence will be presented by the Valeyard. The first evidence is shown through video footage, taken from the Matrix, of the Doctor&#x27;s recent involvement in the planet Ravolox, where the Valeyard shows that the Doctor willingly became involved in the affairs of the planet. The Doctor denies these charges as the Valeyard brings them. After showing the video, the Valeyard affirms he has more evidence sufficient to call for the end of the Doctor&#x27;s life.

As shown by the court evidence, the Doctor and Peri land on Ravolox, both noting a similarity to Earth. The Doctor is aware that Ravolox was devastated by a fireball, according to official records, but the presence of flourishing plant life makes him suspicious. As they walk, they are observed by Sabalom Glitz and Dibber, mercenaries on the planet attempting to destroy a &quot;black light&quot; generator in order to destroy the L3 robot deep underground that it powers. The Doctor and Peri find a tunnel and enter to find remains that appear to be that of the Marble Arch tube station on the London Underground Central line, piquing the Doctor&#x27;s curiosity further. The Doctor wishes to proceed deeper, but Peri is worried and stays behind.

Peri is soon captured by a local human tribe, led by Katryca, and brought to their camp. Katryca informs Peri that she will need to take many husbands for the tribe, and locks her away with Glitz and Dibber; the two were captured after approaching the tribe to try to convince them to let them destroy the generator, which the tribe has taken as a totem. The three manage to overpower the guards and escape, but not before planting a bomb on the black light generator. They are pursued by the tribe.

The Doctor, in exploring the modern underground complex, is also captured by humans under watch by &quot;the Immortal&quot;. He is brought before the Immortal, the L3 robot that Glitz is looking for. The robot calls itself Drathro, and is following its instructions to maintain the habitat of the underground system. Drathro orders the Doctor to make necessary repairs, but the Doctor manages to temporarily electrify the robot and make his escape. Drathro sends a service robot after the Doctor.

Peri, Glitz, and Dibber eventually meet up with the Doctor back at the ruins of Marble Arch, trapped between the tribe and the service robot. However, the tribesmen disable the service robot and recapture the group including the Doctor. The Doctor tries to explain the nature of the tribe&#x27;s totem, but Katryca is unimpressed and places them in a cell again. While there, Glitz confirms that Ravolox is actually Earth. Drathro reactivates the service robot and sends it into the tribe&#x27;s village to recapture the Doctor, but the tribe is able to disable it again; Katryca decides they should attack Drathro&#x27;s &quot;castle&quot; to steal its technology for themselves. The Doctor and Peri use the opportunity to escape and re-enter the underground complex, aware that the black light generator is now damaged beyond repair, and if it should self-destruct, it could take the whole universe with it.

Katryca and the tribe are easily defeated by Drathro. When the Doctor arrives, he attempts to plead for Drathro to shut himself down in order to disable the black light system, but Drathro refuses. Glitz, Dibber and Peri arrive after being detained by Drathro, and Glitz offers to take the robot aboard his ship, which has a functioning black light system. Drathro agrees, and departs with the mercenaries. The Doctor finds the black light system is already beginning to self-destruct, and reconfigures the system so that its explosion would be limited to the underground complex. The Doctor, Peri, and the other humans living underground escape in time. The remains of the tribe offer to take in those humans that were living underground, and the Doctor and Peri say their goodbyes.

==Production==

===Preproduction===
In February 1985, the BBC announced that the planned twenty-third season of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; had been cancelled. After vocal protests by the press and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fans (including a charity single, &quot;Doctor in Distress&quot;), the BBC announced that the programme was merely on &quot;hiatus&quot;, and would return in September 1986. Several stories which had been planned or commissioned for the original Season 23 were abandoned in favour of an overarching &quot;trial&quot; theme, reflecting the fact that the programme itself was on trial at the BBC.

This story was the last complete &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story written by Robert Holmes. Its plot is similar to Holmes&#x27; first contribution to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;The Krotons&quot;. In both stories, an alien machine subjugates a humanoid civilisation and forces its brightest young people into its service.

===Production===
The opening model shot of the Time Lord Space Station where the trial is held throughout the season was the most expensive model shot from the classic series run (costing more than £8,000). The sequence depicts the Time Lord Space Station orbiting in space then dragging the TARDIS inside via the use of a tractor beam.

From this serial until the end of the show in 1989, all location work would be recorded on Outside Broadcast (OB) tape instead of the usual 16mm film. The only footage shot on film for this episode was the opening special effects shot of the TARDIS. The BBC had been encouraging the replacement of film cameras with OB cameras since the early 1980s on the grounds that they were cheaper, and mixed with studio-shot material better. John Nathan-Turner had actually wanted to switch to OB shooting as early as Peter Davison&#x27;s first season in 1982, but met with resistance from the directors working on the show at the time, so was overruled.

Roger Brierley, who voiced the role of Drathro, was originally supposed to wear the robot costume and physically play the role, but it was realised that the costume would not fit Brierley&#x27;s frame. Therefore, a special effects assistant, Paul McGuinness, who helped design the costume, was called in to physically play Drathro, while Brierley spoke his lines from off-camera.

===Post-production===
Dominic Glynn was hired to score the incidental music for &quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot;, then John Nathan-Turner offered him the chance to rearrange the opening title music. His new score for the opening theme was the shortest-lived, lasting for this season alone (not counting the unused 1973 version by Delia Derbyshire and Paddy Kingsland).

===Cast notes===
The actor playing Merdeen, Tom Chadbon, had previously appeared in the 1979 Fourth Doctor serial &quot;City of Death&quot;.

===Reception===
The serial generally receives a poor response, similar to the other stories of this era. Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; was critical of the serial: &quot;a dismal last gasp from ailing writer Robert Holmes. The travails of the Saxon-like Tribe of the Free and whey-faced tunnel-dwellers are totally unengaging. Lifeless characters, clumsy robots, flimsy cliffhangers, zero peril.&quot;
AV Club&#x27;s Christopher Bahn said: &quot;&#x27;Mysterious Planet&#x27; never really takes off, laden down by the script, a lot of time wasted running around in the forest or down corridors, and some atrocious acting by some of the minor characters, particularly Joan Sims as Katryca, the Boadica-esque warrior queen who sounds like she&#x27;s escaped from a community-theater Shakespeare in the Park production.&quot;

==Commercial releases==

===In print===
A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in November 1987.

===Home media===
In October 1993, this story was released on VHS as part of the three-tape &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; set. It was released on DVD on 29 September 2008, similarly boxed with the other three stories of this season. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 129 on 11 December 2013.

These four episodes, along with the remaining 10 episodes, were released on blu-ray on October 7 2019. Extended versions of these four episodes (along with extended versions of the remaining 10 episodes) were included as extras on Discs 5 &amp; 6.

<doc id="596166" wikidata="Q2917183" url="?curid=596166" title="Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management">
<text>Mrs. Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management, also published as Mrs. Beeton&#x27;s Cookery Book, is an extensive guide to running a household in Victorian Britain, edited by Isabella Beeton and first published as a book in 1861. Previously published in parts, it initially and briefly bore the title &quot;Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot;, as one of the series of guidebooks published by her husband, Samuel Beeton. The recipes were highly structured, in contrast to those in earlier cookbooks. It was illustrated with many monochrome and colour plates.

Although Mrs. Beeton died in 1865, the book continued to be a best-seller. The first editions after her death contained an obituary notice, but later editions did not, allowing readers to imagine that every word was written by an experienced Mrs. Beeton personally. 
Many of the recipes were copied from the most successful cookery books of the day, including Eliza Acton&#x27;s &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot; (first published in 1845), Elizabeth Raffald&#x27;s &quot;The Experienced English Housekeeper&quot; (originally published in 1769), Marie-Antoine Carême&#x27;s &quot;Le Pâtissier royal Parisien&quot; (1815), Hannah Glasse&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy&quot; (1747), Maria Eliza Rundell&#x27;s &quot;A New System of Domestic Cookery&quot; (1806), and the works of Charles Elmé Francatelli (1805–1876). This practice of &quot;Mrs. Beeton&#x27;s&quot; has in modern times repeatedly been described as plagiarism.

The book expanded steadily in length until by 1907 it reached 74 chapters and over 2,000 pages. Nearly two million copies were sold by 1868, and it remains in print. Between 1875 and 1914 it was probably the most often-consulted cookery book. Mrs. Beeton has been compared on the strength of the book with modern &quot;&quot; like Nigella Lawson and Delia Smith.

== History ==

The author, Isabella Beeton, was 21 years old when she started working on the book. It was initially serialised in 24 monthly instalments, in her husband Samuel Orchart Beeton&#x27;s publication &quot;The Englishwoman&#x27;s Domestic Magazine&quot;; the first instalment appeared in 1859. On 1 October 1861, the instalments were collected into one volume with the title &quot;The Book of Household Management, comprising information for the Mistress, Housekeeper, Cook, Kitchen-Maid, Butler, Footman, Coachman, Valet, Upper and Under House-Maids, Lady&#x27;s-Maid, Maid-of-all-Work, Laundry-Maid, Nurse and Nurse-Maid, Monthly Wet and Sick Nurses, etc. etc.also Sanitary, Medical, &amp; Legal Memoranda: with a History of the Origin, Properties, and Uses of all Things Connected with Home Life and Comfort.&quot;

In its preface she wrote:

Beeton&#x27;s half-sister, Lucy Smiles, was later asked by her son about her memories of the book&#x27;s development, for the centenary of Beeton&#x27;s birth, 1936. She recalled:

Previously published as a part-work, it was first published as a book in 1861 by S. O. Beeton Publishing, 161 Bouverie Street, London, a firm founded by Samuel Beeton.
The book was an immediate best-seller, selling 60,000 copies in its first year and totalling nearly two million by 1868. In 2010 a copy of the first edition of &quot;Household Management&quot; in &quot;top condition&quot; was stated to be worth more than £1,000. In 1863 a revised edition was issued.

In 1866, a year after Isabella&#x27;s death, Samuel was in debt due to the collapse of Overend and Gurney, a London discount house to which he owed money. To save himself from bankruptcy he sold the copyright to all of his publications for a little over £19,000. Of that, the rights to &quot;Household Management&quot; were sold to publishers Ward, Lock and Tyler for £3,250. The early editions included an obituary notice for Beeton, but the publishers insisted it be removed &quot;allowing readers to imagineperhaps even as late as 1915that some mob-capped matriarch was out there still keeping an eye on them&quot;.

Revisions to &quot;Household Management&quot; by its publisher have continued to the present day. The effort has kept the Beeton name in the public eye for over 125 years, although current editions are far removed from those published in Mrs. Beeton&#x27;s lifetime. By 1906 the book had 2,056 pages, &quot;exclusive of advertising&quot;, with 3,931 recipes and was &quot;half as large again&quot; as the previous edition.

== Book ==

=== Contents === 

The following description refers to the 1907 edition; the book was greatly extended in the decades since Mrs. Beeton&#x27;s death (in 1865) to 74 chapters and over 2000 pages; the first edition had 44 chapters.

The book begins with general chapters on the duties of the &quot;mistress&quot;, the housekeeper, and the cook. There follow chapters on the kitchen itself, &quot;marketing&quot; (choosing good-quality produce at the market), and an introduction to cookery (Chapter 6). Together, these take up over 100 pages. Chapters seven to 38 (roughly 1000 pages) cover English cooking, with recipes for soups, gravies, fish, meat (principally veal, beef, mutton and lamb, and pork), poultry, game, preserves, vegetables, pastries, puddings, sweets, jams, pickles, and savouries. Chapter 39 describes the &quot;art of carving at table&quot;, supported by eleven illustrations. Chapters 40 to 50 (some 200 pages) give instructions for dairy products, vegetarian and invalid (sick person) cookery, making bread, biscuits and cakes, and beverages. Chapters 51 to 59 describe cooking in various international styles including French, German, Spanish, Jewish, Australian, South African, Indian, American, and Canadian cookery. Chapters 60 to 68 guide on matters from trussing poultry to the definitions of culinary terms, arranging meals, decorating the table, making menus, and the duties of domestic servants. Chapters 69 to 73 describe &quot;household recipes&quot; and medical preparations. The final chapter, 74, offers &quot;legal memoranda&quot;.

There is a detailed index. The edition includes advertisements for products such as &quot;Lemco&quot; beef extract and &quot;Cadbury&#x27;s Cocoa&quot;.

=== Approach === 

The preface sets out the book&#x27;s goal of providing &quot;men&quot; with such well-cooked food at home that it may compete with what they could eat &quot;at their clubs, well-ordered taverns, and dining-houses&quot;. Mrs. Beeton claims that:

She explains that she was thus attempting to make the basics of cookery &quot;intelligible&quot; to any &quot;housewife&quot;.

The first chapter sets the tone of the book with a quotation from the &quot;Book of Proverbs&quot;, and in early editions cites also &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; with:

The book thus advocates early rising, cleanliness, frugality, good temper, and the wisdom of interviewing servants rather than relying on written references.

Cookery is introduced with words about &quot;the progress of mankind from barbarism to civilization&quot;, with a mention of man &quot;in his primitive state, [living] upon roots and the fruits of the earth&quot;, rising to become in turn &quot;a hunter and a fisher&quot;; then a &quot;herdsman&quot; and finally &quot;the comfortable condition of a farmer.&quot; It is granted that &quot;the fruits of the earth, the fowls of the air, the beasts of the field, and the fish of the sea, are still the only food of mankind&quot;, but that:

The text then swiftly passes to a description of simple measures like a table-spoonful, and the duties of servants.

The whole rest of the book is taken up with instructions for cooking, with an introduction in each chapter to the type of food it describes. The first of these, on soups, begins &quot;Lean, juicy beef, mutton, and veal form the basis of all good soups; therefore it is advisable to procure those pieces which afford the richest succulence, and such as are fresh-killed.&quot; The account of how to make soup consists of a single essay, divided into general advice and numbered steps for making any kind of (meat-based) soup. This is followed in early editions by a separate chapter of recipes for soups of different kinds.

Each recipe is structured into a title, a list of ingredients (with quantities, either naturalas a number of eggs or vegetables, a number of slices of hamor measured in Imperial unitsounces of salt, quarts of water. The actual instructions are headed &quot;Mode&quot;, as &quot;Cut up the veal, and put it with the bones and trimmings of poultry&quot;. A separate section gives the overall preparation time, and the average cost as, for example, &quot;9d. per quart&quot;. Many recipes state in separate brief sections when a recipe is &quot;seasonable and for how many persons it is &quot;sufficient&quot;. Finally, a &quot;note&quot; gives any required advice, such as &quot;When stronger stock is desired, double the quantity of veal, or put in an old fowl.&quot; This highly structured presentation was the book&#x27;s main innovation.

=== Oddities === 

Despite professing to be a guide of reliable information about every aspect of running a house for the aspirant middle classes, the original edition devotes 23 pages to household management, then discusses cooking for almost all of the other 900. Even with the emphasis on food, some of her cooking advice is so odd as to suggest that she had little experience preparing meals. For example, the book recommends boiling pasta for an hour and forty-five minutes. Like many other British people of her social class and generation, Mrs. Beeton adopted a distaste for unfamiliar foods, saying that mangoes tasted like turpentine, lobsters were indigestible, garlic was offensive, potatoes were &quot;suspicious; a great many are narcotic, and many are deleterious&quot;, cheese could only be consumed by sedentary people, and tomatoes were either good or bad for a range of reasons.

Unlike earlier cookbook authors, such as Hannah Glasse, the book offered an &quot;emphasis on thrift and economy&quot;. It also discarded the style of previous writers who employed &quot;daunting paragraph[s] of text with ingredients and method jumbled up together&quot; for what is a recognisably modern &quot;user-friendly formula listing ingredients, method, timings and even the estimated cost of each recipe&quot;.

=== Plagiarism ===

In a critical letter, Mrs. Beeton&#x27;s acquaintance Mrs. Henrietta Mary Pourtois English advised her that &quot;Cookery is a Science that is only learnt by Long Experience and years of study which of course you have not had. Therefore my advice would be to compile a book from recipes from a Variety of the Best Books published on Cookery and Heaven knows there is a great variety for you to choose from.&quot; The recipes were largely copied from the most successful cookery books of the day, the copying in several cases unacknowledged in the text. The &quot;variety&quot; included Eliza Acton&#x27;s &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot; and her &quot;The English Bread–Book&quot;, Elizabeth Raffald&#x27;s &quot;The Experienced English Housekeeper&quot;, Marie-Antoine Carême&#x27;s &quot;Le Pâtissier royal Parisien&quot;, Louis Eustache Ude&#x27;s &quot;The French Cook&quot;, Alexis Soyer&#x27;s &quot;The Modern Housewife or, Ménagère&quot; and &quot;The Pantropheon&quot;, Hannah Glasse&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy&quot;, Maria Eliza Rundell&#x27;s &quot;A New System of Domestic Cookery&quot;, and the works of Charles Elmé Francatelli.

In modern times Mrs. Beeton&#x27;s practice has been criticised as plagiarism; Beeton&#x27;s modern biographer Kathryn Hughes talks of her &quot;lifting&quot; and &quot;brazenly copying&quot; recipes from others, and says that this was &quot;the way that cookery books had been put together from time immemorial ...&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Isabella [Beeton] plagiarised only the best&quot;. This led to the comment that &quot;Mrs Beeton couldn&#x27;t cook but she could copy&quot;. Hughes recounts that Beeton&#x27;s &quot;first recipe for Victoria sponge was so inept that she left out the eggs&quot; and that her work was &quot;brazenly copied ... almost word for word, from books as far back as the Restoration&quot;. The influential 20th-century food writer Elizabeth David dismissed her as &quot;a plagiarist&quot; and later wrote: &quot;I wonder if I would have ever learned to cook at all if I had been given a routine Mrs. Beeton to learn from&quot;.

=== Illustrations ===

The 1907 edition runs to some 30 full-page colour plates and over 100 full-page illustrations in monochrome. These include photographs, such as of the housekeeper standing with hands behind her back in her kitchen, facing the first page of Chapter two, &quot;The Housekeeper&quot;. An idea of the amount of detail may be gained from the fact that there are eleven illustrations of types of fish, such as &quot;steamed sole&quot; and &quot;soused mackerel&quot;, and another of &quot;fish entrées&quot;.

One full-page colour plate illustrated a range of puddings, showing jelly, raspberry cream, a centre dish piled high with fruits, a trifle, and an ornamental flowerpot containing a strawberry plant.

Another full-page colour plate showed a variety of fruits including apricots, white and black cherries, white, red, and black currants, a melon, strawberries, and varieties of plums, all piled high on circular dishes or fruit stands.

== Influence and legacy ==

=== Contemporary ===

The preface of Wilhelmina Rawson&#x27;s &quot;Queensland Cookery and Poultry Book&quot; (1878), published in Australia, observes that: &quot;Mrs. Lance Rawson&#x27;s Cookery Book ... is written entirely for the Colonies, and for the middle classes, and for those people who cannot afford to buy a Mrs. Beeton or a Warne, but who can afford the three shillings for this.&quot;

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; recognised that, by the 1890s, Beeton&#x27;s name &quot;was adopted as a term for an authority on all things domestic and culinary&quot;. The Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science observed that &quot;it was probably found in more homes than any other cookery book, and [was probably] the most often consulted, in the years 1875 to 1914&quot;.

A chapter of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s novel &quot;A Duet, with an Occasional Chorus&quot; (1899) is entitled, &quot;Concerning Mrs. Beeton&quot;; a character declares: &quot;Mrs. Beeton must have been the finest housekeeper in the world, therefore Mr. Beeton must have been the happiest and most comfortable man&quot;.

=== Modern ===

Mrs. Beeton has been described as &quot;the grandmother of modern domestic goddesses&quot;, like Nigella Lawson and Delia Smith, who saw, as Beeton did, the need to provide reassuring advice on culinary matters for the British middle classes. However, while Lawson and Smith &quot;insist that cooking can be easy, fun and uncomplicated&quot;, Beeton &quot;acknowledges the labour and skill required to cook well&quot;.

The book is referenced repeatedly in The Wind in the Willows (TV series) episode &quot;The Masterchef&quot;. Mr. Toad attempts to make an apricot souffle, but the wind blows the pages to a &quot;mustard and linseed poultice&quot; remedy from the medical preparations section midway through. He fails to notice. Luckily, the linseed oil ignites in the oven and destroys the dish before he can serve it to his friends.

The food writer and chef Gerard Baker tested and revised 220 of Beeton&#x27;s recipes, and published the result as &quot;Mrs. Beeton: How To Cook&quot; (2011).

For the book&#x27;s 150th anniversary in 2011, the Royal Society of Chemistry planned to feature one of Beeton&#x27;s recipes. Due to the financial climate at the time in wake of the Great Recession, the Society selected Beeton&#x27;s toast sandwich, a dish that Beeton included to cater to the less well-off.

In 2012, the food economist for the British television period drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; described Beeton&#x27;s book as an &quot;important guide&quot; for the food served in the series.

<text>A streak camera is an instrument for measuring the variation in a pulse of light&#x27;s intensity with time. They are used to measure the pulse duration of some ultrafast laser systems and for applications such as time-resolved spectroscopy and LIDAR.

==Mechanical types==
Mechanical streak cameras use a rotating mirror or moving slit system to deflect the light beam. They are limited in their maximum scan speed and thus temporal resolution.

==Optoelectronic type==
Optoelectronic streak cameras work by directing the light onto a photocathode, which when hit by photons produces electrons via the photoelectric effect. The electrons are accelerated in a cathode-ray tube and pass through an electric field produced by a pair of plates, which deflects the electrons sideways. By modulating the electric potential between the plates, the electric field is quickly changed to give a time-varying deflection of the electrons, sweeping the electrons across a phosphor screen at the end of the tube. A linear detector, such as a charge-coupled device (CCD) array is used to measure the streak pattern on the screen, and thus the temporal profile of the light pulse.

The time-resolution of the best optoelectronic streak cameras is around 180 femtoseconds. Measurement of pulses shorter than this duration requires other techniques such as optical autocorrelation and frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG).

In December 2011, a team at MIT released images combining the use of a streak camera with repeated laser pulses to simulate a movie with a frame rate of one trillion frames per second. This was surpassed in 2020 by a team from Caltech that achieved frame rates of 70 trillion fps.

<doc id="596172" wikidata="Q952769" url="?curid=596172" title="Iberian Anarchist Federation">
<text>The Iberian Anarchist Federation (, FAI) is a Spanish anarchist organization. Due to its close relation with the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) anarcho-syndicalist union, it is often abbreviated as CNT-FAI. The FAI publishes the periodical &quot;Tierra y Libertad&quot;.

The &quot;Iberian&quot; part of its name alludes to the purpose of unifying Spanish and Portuguese anarchists in a Pan-Iberian organization. The FAI meetings were initially attended by members of the Portuguese anarchist organizations União Anarquista Portuguesa and Confederação Geral do Trabalho, including the Zaragoza Congress of the CNT in 1936. However, it later ceased to have Portuguese participation and become an entirely Spanish organization. It is still in operation today and aligns itself with the International of Anarchist Federations (IAF-IFA).

== History ==

It was founded in Valencia in 1927 (after a preliminary meeting the previous year in Marseille, France), to campaign for keeping the CNT on an anarchist path by challenging the bureaucracy of the CNT—which it viewed as having grown to become a mediating link between labor and capital, rather than a representative of the working class. This issue was becoming especially tense, as Miguel Primo de Rivera&#x27;s dictatorial regime took over in Spain, and engineered a crackdown on labour movements.

The disproportional hegemony which the FAI gained over CNT politics in the early 1930s led to confrontation with the less radical revolutionary syndicalist members. From 1931, in the first years of the Second Spanish Republic, possibilist union officials (Treintism, the pro-Republican &#x27;Treinta&#x27; and their followers) were systematically forced out of office or expelled, leading to the creation of anti-FAI opposition unions within the CNT in March 1933. The most moderate trade-unionists, under Ángel Pestaña, were ultimately expelled, forming the Syndicalist Party in April 1934, and leaving the CNT leadership under firm FAI control by the time of the Spanish Civil War.

Members of the FAI were at the forefront of the fight against Francisco Franco&#x27;s forces during the Civil War, mainly in the Eastern Army (&quot;Ejército del Este&quot;).

Since Franco&#x27;s death, and Spain&#x27;s transition to representative democracy, the FAI has continued to function. Though the organization shares members with the CNT, the FAI&#x27;s membership is secret.

<text>Mindwarp is the second serial of the larger narrative known as &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; which encompasses the whole of the 23rd season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 4 to 25 October 1986. The title &quot;Mindwarp&quot; is not used on screen and appears only on the serial&#x27;s scripts with the four episodes that comprise the story being transmitted as &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; Parts Five to Eight. This story marks the final appearance of Nicola Bryant as Peri Brown.

In the serial, the alien time traveller the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) is put on trial by his people, the Time Lords, and is accused of meddling in the affairs of the planet Thoros Beta in the 24th century. Much of the story consists of a video testimony presented by the prosecutor – the Valeyard (Michael Jayston) – of The Doctor discovering the alien arms dealer Sil (Nabil Shaban) is looking for a way to prolong the life of Lord Kiv (Christopher Ryan) by transplanting Kiv&#x27;s mind into another.

==Plot==

As with the other serials from Season 23, &quot;Mindwarp&quot; is framed by the trial of the Sixth Doctor, prosecuted by the Valeyard, accusing him of meddling in other species&#x27; affairs in a way unbecoming of a Time Lord. The Valeyard provides evidence to the presiding Inquisitor via a screen linked to the Matrix showing the details of the Doctor&#x27;s actions on the planet Thoros Beta. The bulk of the episode centres on recorded narrative.

As shown by the video, the Doctor and Peri arrive on Thoros Beta, the Doctor&#x27;s curiosity piqued on the availability of advanced weaponry by the Warlords of Thordon. As they explore a cave system, the Doctor discovers Sil, an arms dealer for the Mentors that are supplying the weapons. Exploring further, they find that the scientist Crozier in Sil&#x27;s employ is attempting to perfect the ability to transplant the brilliant mind of Kiv, Sil&#x27;s superior, into another body to overcome Kiv&#x27;s pending death. When discovered, the two make their escape with the warlord King Yrcanos, one of Crozier&#x27;s test subjects.

The Doctor, Peri, Yrcanos and his men plan an attack on Sil, but the Doctor betrays them by abandoning them at the last minute and warns the Mentors, causing Peri and Yrcanos to flee in different directions. Peri happens across one of the Mentors&#x27; servant women, and with her help, disguises herself to get close to the Doctor. The Doctor reveals Peri to the Mentors and requests he be allowed to interrogate her alone, a request Sil allows. Away from the others, the Doctor tells Peri his betrayal was all a ploy to learn more of Sil&#x27;s plan, and has discovered that they will transplant Kiv&#x27;s mind into his body if he does not cooperate.

Crozier interrupts the interrogation, believing he can extract more information from Peri, but then Yrcanos arrives, ready to kill the Doctor. Peri stops Yrcanos, and together they escape, regrouping with Yrcanos&#x27; men. As Kiv&#x27;s body is dying, Crozier is forced to transplant his brain with the Doctor&#x27;s help into the body of one of the Mentors&#x27; servants, keeping the mind alive but affected by the simple thoughts of the former consciousness. Yrcanos, Peri, and his men launch another attack, this time on a weapons stash, but are stunned and captured. Sil and Crozier decide to use Peri as a more suitable body for Kiv&#x27;s brain, despite the Doctor&#x27;s objections. As the operation is being prepared, the Doctor sneaks away and frees Yrcanos, urging him on for Peri&#x27;s safety.

Peri is strapped down and gagged as the operation is prepared and Crozier gives the order for her head to be shaven. The Doctor attempts to return to save her but is suddenly drawn hypnotically into the TARDIS, which appears in the hallway; it is later revealed that he travelled directly to his trial from that point. Despite the Doctor claiming that the Time Lords&#x27; interference has put Peri&#x27;s life in danger, the Valeyard rebuffs this, stating that the Doctor shouldn&#x27;t have become involved in the first place, and Peri&#x27;s life is the cost of his involvement. Events on Thoros Beta continue after the Doctor&#x27;s removal, as it is shown that Ycranos was placed in a time bubble by the Time Lords to hold his arrival back at the lab until after Kiv&#x27;s mind was successfully transplanted into Peri; when Yrcanos is freed of the bubble, he is distraught at the results of the operation, and fires wildly, killing Peri. The Valeyard insists that the interference of the Time Lords was to prevent a greater disaster befalling the universe due to the mistakes in the Doctor&#x27;s actions. The Doctor insists that the present trial appears to be serving an ulterior motive, and resolves to determine what it is as the trial continues.

==Production==
===Music===
Initially it was intended that the BBC Radiophonic Workshop would provide music scores for both this and the following segment of &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;; both were assigned to Malcolm Clarke to begin with, although &quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot; was reassigned to Elizabeth Parker shortly afterwards. However, fellow Radiophonic Workshop composer Jonathan Gibbs left early in 1986 and was not replaced until the following year, leaving the other composers backlogged and with no one free to do the incidental music for &quot;Mindwarp&quot;. It was suggested that Dick Mills could provide both the music and sound effects, but John Nathan-Turner rejected this idea and instead hired film composer Richard Hartley to create the incidental music for this segment. It would be the only time that Hartley worked on the series. The original recordings of Hartley&#x27;s score no longer exist in the BBC archives with the result that there was no isolated score included on the DVD release of this story. For the Blu-Ray release of Season 23, Richard Hartley, along with Mark Ayres re-recorded the entire score in order to present the serial in a new 5.1 mix.

===Cast notes===
Deep Roy, who had previously played Mr. Sin in &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot;, has an uncredited role as the Posicarian delegate. Trevor Laird returned to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the Tenth Doctor era as Clive Jones, father of the Doctor&#x27;s companion Martha Jones. Christopher Ryan returned in 2008 as Sontaran leader General Staal in &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot; and &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;, and in 2010 as another Sontaran, Commander Strak, in &quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot;.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===
A novelisation of this serial, written by Philip Martin, was published by Target Books in June 1989 and was the final segment of the &quot;Trial&quot; arc to be adapted. Martin&#x27;s novelisation adds a joke ending that gives away the revelation regarding Peri&#x27;s fate in &quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot;, suggesting an entirely different outcome for the character and for Yrcanos than is suggested in the serial.

===Home media===
In October 1993, this story was released on VHS as part of the three-tape &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; set. The Region 2 DVD was released on 29 September 2008, similarly boxed with the other three stories of this season. This serial was scheduled to be released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 130 on 25 December 2013.

These four episodes, along with the remaining 10 episodes, were released on blu-ray on 7 October 2019. Extended versions of these four episodes (along with extended versions of the remaining 10 episodes) were included as extras on Discs 5 &amp; 6.

<doc id="596177" wikidata="Q6313196" url="?curid=596177" title="Terror of the Vervoids">
<text>Terror of the Vervoids is the third serial of the larger narrative known as &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; which encompasses the whole of the 23rd season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 1 to 22 November 1986. The title &quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot; is never used on screen and was first used in relation to these episodes for the 1987 novelisation, with the four episodes that comprise the season being referred to as &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; Parts Nine to Twelve. This serial is the first appearance of Bonnie Langford as the companion Mel Bush.

In the serial, the alien time traveller the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) is put on trial by his people, the Time Lords, and is accused of meddling in the affairs of other worlds. Much of the story consists of video testimony presented by the Doctor, his own defence, of his own future where the last of a race of plants called Vervoids on board a spaceliner in 2986 plot to wipe out all animal life on board for their own survival.

==Plot==
At the courtroom, the Doctor takes to the stand in his defence and uses the Matrix to show the Time Lords his tale of events of how he saved everyone on board the freighter, Hyperion III.

On board the Hyperion III, Communication Officer Edwardes is attacked by an unseen creature. Before he dies, he sends a distress call to a nearby ship: the TARDIS. The Doctor and his new companion, Mel Bush, follow the message to the freighter, where they meet a trio of scientists: Professor Lasky and her colleagues Bruchner and Doland. The group is guarding a shipment of Demeter seeds and some large flower pods. Mel is investigating the guarded plant area when Edwardes finds her. While opening the door for Mel, Edwardes is electrocuted.

While investigating, The Doctor and Mel find a half-human, half-plant hybrid strapped to a table. The creature implores them to stop Lasky, but Lasky, Bruchner and Doland sedate her. Doland tells the time travellers that the creature is his assistant, Ruth Baxter. During their experiments involving cross-fertilisation, pollen penetrated a scratch in Ruth&#x27;s thumb, causing the resulting plant maturing process to partially transform her human body. They are taking her to Earth in the hope that they can reverse the infection.

It is revealed that human-kind is being killed by plant-like creatures called Vervoids, the creatures that came out of the pods when Edwardes was electrocuted.

Bruchner goes to the bridge and forces Travers and the pilot to leave, then changes the course of the Hyperion to head into the black hole of Tartarus, planning to destroy the ship, and kill the Vervoids. The Doctor, Lasky and Travers attempt to break into the bridge, but the Vervoids have filled it with marsh gas. Bruchner is killed by the gas, but the ship is still heading into the black hole. Security Officer Rudge summons two Mogarian crew members, as they can breathe in the poisonous atmosphere. They direct the ship away from the black hole, but when it is safe, Rudge and the Mogarians hijack the ship. Rudge tells the Doctor that the Mogarians are trying to regain the supply of metals stored in the vault. Rudge is taking the hijacking as a means of securing a &quot;more comfortable retirement.&quot;

The Doctor, Mel, Travers and Lasky meet to discuss the Vervoids. The Doctor reveals that the Vervoids hate &#x27;animal-kind&#x27; and kill for survival. Lasky vows to help destroy the creatures.

The Doctor has an idea that vionesium, the rare metal taken from Mogar stored in the ship&#x27;s vault, would accelerate the Vervoids&#x27; life-cycle towards its natural end. Travers lowers the lighting and heating in the ship, forcing the Vervoids back to their lair, where the Doctor and Mel are waiting. They deploy the metal against the Vervoids, which causes the creatures&#x27; leaf-covered bodies to die. Having saved the survivors, the Doctor and Mel depart in the TARDIS.

Back in the courtroom, upon viewing these events in the Matrix, the Valeyard considers the Doctor&#x27;s destruction of the Vervoids as genocide, and pleads for the Time Lords to seek the death penalty against the Doctor.

<doc id="596179" wikidata="Q3077611" url="?curid=596179" title="Chowla–Selberg formula">
<text>In mathematics, the Chowla–Selberg formula is the evaluation of a certain product of values of the gamma function at rational values in terms of values of the Dedekind eta function at imaginary quadratic irrational numbers. The result was essentially found by and rediscovered by .

==Statement==

In logarithmic form, the Chowla–Selberg formula states that in certain cases the sum

: formula_1

can be evaluated using the Kronecker limit formula. Here χ is the quadratic residue symbol modulo &quot;D&quot;, where &quot;−D&quot; is the discriminant of an imaginary quadratic field. The sum is taken over 0 &lt; &quot;r&quot; &lt; &quot;D&quot;, with the usual convention χ(&quot;r&quot;) = 0 if &quot;r&quot; and &quot;D&quot; have a common factor. The function η is the Dedekind eta function, and &quot;h&quot; is the class number, and &quot;w&quot; is the number of roots of unity.

==Origin and applications==
The origin of such formulae is now seen to be in the theory of complex multiplication, and in particular in the theory of periods of an abelian variety of CM-type. This has led to much research and generalization. In particular there is an analog of the Chowla–Selberg formula for p-adic numbers, involving a p-adic gamma function, called the Gross–Koblitz formula.

The Chowla–Selberg formula gives a formula for a finite product of values of the eta functions. By combining this with the theory of complex multiplication, one can give a formula for the individual absolute values of the eta function as
:formula_2
for some algebraic number α.

==Examples==

Using Euler&#x27;s reflection formula for the gamma function gives:

*formula_3

<text>Poanes aaroni, the saffron skipper, is a North American butterfly from the skipper family (Hesperiidae) which occurs in salt marshes along the Atlantic coast.

The upperside of the wings are vivid orange, with broad black borders. The underside of the hindwing is a paler orange with a pallid stripe in the center.

The larva feeds exclusively on smooth cordgrass (&quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot;).

Four subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;P. a. aaroni&quot; – Aaron&#x27;s skipper
* &quot;P. a. bordeloni&quot; – Bordelon&#x27;s skipper
* &quot;P. a. howardi&quot; – Howard&#x27;s skipper

<doc id="596194" wikidata="Q2903153" url="?curid=596194" title="Bill Casey">
<text>William D. Casey (born February 19, 1945) is a Canadian politician from Nova Scotia who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada. First elected as a Progressive Conservative in 1988, he later sat as Conservative MP following the party merger in 2003. In 2007, Casey was expelled from the party for voting against the 2007 budget, but he was reelected as an Independent in the 2008 election and sat as such until he resigned his seat in 2009 to work on behalf of the Nova Scotian government for provincial interests in Ottawa. Casey decided to return to federal politics in the 2015 federal election and running as a Liberal easily took the seat with 63.73% of the popular vote.

==Life and career==
Casey was born in Amherst, Nova Scotia. He was a car salesman and stockbroker before going into politics. He was first elected, as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, to represent the riding of Cumberland—Colchester in the 1988 election. In common with almost every other PC Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1993 election he lost his seat, in his case being defeated by Liberal candidate Dianne Brushett.

In the 1997 election, he retook the seat, defeating Brushett, and represented it until April 30, 2009.

In 2003, the PCs merged into the new Conservative Party. He was the deputy whip of the Official Opposition from 2004 until the 2006 election, and had served as the Conservative critic of Transport, International Trade, National Revenue, and Foreign Affairs in the past.

When the Conservatives&#x27; 2007 budget was released, Casey praised it, saying: &quot;I have never seen a budget that has had more in it for the people of my riding than this one does.&quot; However, on June 5, 2007, he voted against it, claiming that it broke the Atlantic Accord with his province and Newfoundland and Labrador. He was expelled from the Conservative caucus, and sat as an Independent MP. During the rest of the 39th Parliament, he styled himself as an Independent Progressive Conservative.

In October 2007, the Conservative Party riding association in Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley renominated Casey as its candidate for the 2008 election. The party&#x27;s head office refused to accept Casey&#x27;s nomination, and suspended the association&#x27;s board.

On January 31, 2008, Casey underwent surgery for prostate cancer. His surgery was a success and all the cancer was removed. Casey previously had to have a cancerous growth removed from his back.

On September 4, the Green Party of Canada declared its support for his candidacy and announced that they would not field a candidate against him in the 2008 election. On October 14, 2008, Casey was re-elected as an independent by winning 69% of the popular vote. His nearest opponent was Karen Olsen of the New Democrats with just 12% of the vote.

During the 2008 Canadian parliamentary dispute, Casey announced he would vote against Harper in a motion of non-confidence. He announced in January 2009 that he would not run for re-election in the next federal election However, on April 28, 2009, Rodney MacDonald, the Premier of Nova Scotia, announced that Casey would be the senior representative for the Department of Intergovernmental Affairs in Ottawa for the province, replacing Ian Thompson. Casey officially resigned his seat on April 30.

On November 18, 2014, Casey announced he was running for the Liberal nomination in his former riding for the 2015 federal election and won the nomination vote on February 28, 2015. On October 19, 2015, Casey won the election, defeating Conservative incumbent Scott Armstrong.

In September 2018, Casey announced that he would not run in the 2019 election.

In July 2021, Casey announced he would run in the next Nova Scotia general election as a candidate for the Nova Scotia Liberal Party in Cumberland North. The incumbent was former PC MLA Elizabeth Smith-McCrossin, who ran as an independent. Casey was unsuccessful losing to Smith-McCrossin.

==Personal life==
Casey was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 2006 and underwent two surgeries to have the cancerous mole removed. He battled prostate cancer and underwent surgery in early February 2008.

<doc id="596197" wikidata="Q47530" url="?curid=596197" title="Bight of Benin">
<text>The Bight of Benin, or Bay of Benin, is a bight in the Gulf of Guinea area on the western African coast that derives its name from the historical Kingdom of Benin.

==Geography==
The Bight of Benin was named after the Kingdom of Benin. It extends eastward for about from Cape St. Paul to the Nun outlet of the Niger River, which marks the westernmost point of the Bight of Biafra. 

Historical associations with the Atlantic slave trade led to the region becoming known as the Slave Coast. As in many other regions across Africa, powerful indigenous kingdoms along the Bight of Benin relied heavily on a long-established slave trade that expanded greatly after the arrival of European powers and became a global trade with the colonization of the Americas. Estimates from the 1640s suggest that Benin (Beneh) took in 1200 slaves a year. Restrictions made it hard for slave volume to grow until new states and different routes began to make an increase in slave trade possible.

==Cultural references==
The Bight of Benin has a long association with slavery, its shore being known as the Slave Coast. From 1807 onwards—after slave trading was made illegal for Britons—the Royal Navy created the West Africa Squadron to suppress and crush the slave trade. These efforts were magnified after 1833 when slave trading was made illegal throughout the British Empire. These efforts would continue until the 1890s and cost Britain significant sums of money, and the Royal Navy hundreds, if not thousands, of sailors’ lives from tropical diseases.

The old Royal Navy rhyme says:
:&quot;Beware, beware the Bight of the Benin, for few come out though many go in.&quot;

A variation goes:
:&quot;Beware beware, the Bight of Benin: one comes out, where fifty went in!&quot;

This is said to be a slavery jingle or sea shanty about the risk of malaria in the Bight. A third version of the couplet is:
:&quot;Beware and take care of the Bight of Benin. There&#x27;s one comes out for forty goes in.&quot;&quot;

In R. Austin Freeman&#x27;s 1927 novel &quot;A Certain Dr. Thorndyke&quot;, Chapter II, &quot;The Legatee,&quot; mention is made of this location. The scene is the Gold Coast colony in Africa where the character Larkom asks, &quot;How does the old mariners&#x27; ditty run? You remember it. &#x27;Oh, the Bight of Benin, the Bight of Benin, One comes out where three go in.&#x27;&quot; Life expectancy was short in this locale due to the prevalence of Blackwater fever.

The author Philip McCutchan has written a book titled &quot;Beware, beware the Bight of Benin&quot;.

A short story by Elizabeth Coatsworth, &quot;The Forgotten Island&quot; (1942), deals with a treasure from Benin. A variation of the rhyme is also mentioned.

Flash For Freedom!, George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s 1971 picaresque novel of Harry Flashman&#x27;s misadventures in—among other places and situations—an English stately home, the 1840s slave trade, antebellum plantation life, and meeting with then-congressman Abraham Lincoln, quotes another variant of the couplet:

&quot;Oh, sailor beware of the Bight o&#x27; Benin.&quot;

&quot;There&#x27;s one as comes out for a hundred goes in.&quot;

In Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s novel &quot;The Commodore&quot; (1996), Dr. Maturin recites the rhyme when he learns of his ship&#x27;s destination. Commodore Aubrey checks him, telling him it is bad luck to say that out loud on the way in.

The rhyme is also partially quoted in chapter &quot;Context(6)&quot; of John Brunner&#x27;s novel &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot;. The Bight of Benin (as well as the fictional republic of Beninia) is mentioned throughout the novel.

David Bramhall&#x27;s series of novels &quot;The Greatest Cape&quot; also mentions the rhyme, one of the characters in the first volume, &quot;The Black Joke&quot;, having been a pirate and a slaver.

In 2007, a collection of short stories entitled The Bight of Benin: Short Fiction by Kelly J. Morris was published by AtacoraPress.com. The stories are set in Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria.

==History==
On 1 February 1852, the British established the Bight of Benin British protectorate, under the authority of Consuls of the Bight of Benin: the republic of Benin and Bight of Benin were named after the Kingdom of Benin extending eastward from Cape St. Paul to the Nun outlet of River Niger.

On 6 August 1861, the Bight of Biafra protectorate and Bight of Benin protectorate were joined as a united British protectorate, ultimately to be merged into Nigeria.

<doc id="596200" wikidata="Q2556975" url="?curid=596200" title="Hemsworth">
<text>Hemsworth is a town and civil parish in the City of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England. Historically within the West Riding of Yorkshire and had a population of 13,311 at the 2001 census, with it increasing to 13,533 at the 2011 Census.

==History==

While Hemsworth&#x27;s recent history and reputation are dominated by the coal mining industry that developed in the latter part of the nineteenth century, it had long existed as an agricultural village.

Hemsworth, meaning “Hymel’s enclosure” is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Hemeleswrde and in the twelfth century as Hymelswrde. Into the Middle Ages it was a township in the Wapentake of Staincross and is also thought to have been in the honour, or feudal barony, of Pontefract.

From the Middle Ages to Tudor times it would have seen little change to the manorial features, open fields, woods, commons, enclosed holdings, manor house, scattered farmsteads and the church, dedicated to St Helen, which dates to the eleventh or twelfth century. The present chancel was rebuilt in the fourteenth century.

A grammar school and a hospital, or almshouses, founded in the mid-sixteenth century owe their existence to Robert Holgate, thought to have been born in Hemsworth, who was consecrated Archbishop of York in 1544.

The school, established in October 1546 by letters patent granted by Henry VIII, did not thrive. At times there were complaints about the masters failing in their duties, which were to teach Latin, Greek and Hebrew to the sons of husbandmen in Hemsworth, Felkirk, South Kirby, Ackworth, Royston and Wragby. There were periods in the eighteenth century when there were no pupils. A revival was attempted and a new school built and opened in January 1868. But it too failed to attract numbers and was moved to more populous Barnsley in 1888. The school buildings became the Roman Catholic Church, before they themselves were replaced in the 1990s.

The Archbishop Holgate almshouses, or hospital, still exist and still offer housing accommodation in a complex of 24 cottages for selected elderly people. Originally the endowment was for a master and ten poor men and ten poor women from the locality. The brothers and sisters wore gowns, were not permitted to frequent the ale-house, nor allowed out without permission later than half past nine in the summer or half past seven in the winter. A fine of twopence was levied for breaches. Being a common swearer, drunkard or brawler could lead to removal. The endowment, based on revenue from lands which Archbishop Holgate held, appeared in Holgate&#x27;s will dated April 1555 and was carried into effect a year after he died in 1556. The total net assets of the modern-day charity which continues the work are £20.7 million.

Enclosure was brought about by an act of parliament in 1803, though it was not a revolutionary change. It ended the tithe system in kind and allocated common land to local landowners, particularly to Sir Francis Wood, and, less so, to Earl Fitzwilliam.

==Economy==
Hemsworth was a one-industry town, where coal mining employed the vast majority of residents, and the closure of the pits during the 1980s led to huge levels of unemployment and deprivation in the area. Hemsworth, along with nearby villages such as Ackworth, Fitzwilliam, Havercroft and Ryhill as well as the towns of South Elmsall and South Kirkby have seen much regeneration both locally and area wise.

Hemsworth is also home to Hemsworth Water Park, situated on the outskirts of the town. Hemsworth Water Park has two lakes and many recreational activities.

==Politics==
Hemsworth Town Council was formed under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 and came into existence on 1 April 1974, succeeding the former Hemsworth Urban District Council. Five wards of Hemsworth Town Council serve the town and the villages of Fitzwilliam and Kinsley. Three councillors serve on each ward—Hemsworth East, Hemsworth South, Hemsworth West, Fitzwilliam and Kinsley.

Three councillors represent Hemsworth, Ward 7, on Wakefield Metropolitan District Council.

Labour held the seat of Hemsworth from its creation in 1918, and from 1966 to 1974 held it with the largest majority of any party in the UK. From 1950 to 1974 Labour&#x27;s share of the vote never dropped below 80 per cent. That it became a marginal seat is regarded as partly due to the disappearance of the coal mining industry, the reorganisation of Conservative-voting areas of the southern part of Wakefield into the constituency in 2010 and the prominence of Brexit as an election issue in 2019. It is estimated that 68.1 per cent of the constituency voted leave in the EU referendum of 2016.

The constituency was reformed in the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, losing Wakefield South and gaining Normanton. It was renamed Normanton and Hemsworth. 

The current Member of Parliament, Jon Trickett (Labour), has represented Hemsworth since a by-election in 1996. He comfortably held the new seat of Normanton and Hemsworth in the general election of July 2024, taking 47.5 per cent of the vote.

==Population==

Population estimates for the Hemsworth built-up-area for 2019 and 2001, broken down by age group, are:


In May 2005, the Office for National Statistics estimated that unemployment in Hemsworth was just 2.8%. This marks progress from periods in the previous two decades when it could reach as high as 50%.

Robert Holgate, a native of Hemsworth (1481?–1555) was consecrated Archbishop of York in January 1545.

==Transport==

Hemsworth lies at the crossing point of the Barnsley to Pontefract and the Wakefield to Doncaster roads. The junction where these roads cross, Cross Hill, is the heart of the original village, where the parish church and the George &amp; Dragon inn still face each other. The A628 road, which forms the Barnsley to Pontefract road, bypasses Hemsworth to its south and east.

Stagecoach provides bus service 28 from Barnsley to Pontefract which serves Hemsworth&#x27;s bus station. Service 195, run by Arriva Yorkshire, links Hemsworth and Wakefield via Ryhill. The Upton to Wakefield services 496 and 497 call at Hemsworth bus station, as does service 36 run by Waterson bus and coach between South Elmsall and Barnsley.

The nearest railway station is in Fitzwilliam, the station at Hemsworth was closed in 1967, while the other railway station on the Hull and Barnsley Railway closed in the 1930s.

==Education==
Primary schools in Hemsworth are St Helen&#x27;s CE Primary School, West End Academy, Grove Lea Primary School and Sacred Heart Catholic Primary. The only secondary school is the Outwood Academy Hemsworth, which was set up in 1921 as Hemsworth Grammar School, the first secondary school in Hemsworth after Archbishop Holgate school relocated to Barnsley in 1888.

Hemsworth had an FE college for many years. Hemsworth Mining and Technical college offered day release to mining apprentices as well as a range of other academic and vocational courses. It closed in the 1990s.

==Media==
The local weekly newspaper, the &quot;Hemsworth and South Elmsall Express&quot;, is edited by Gavin Murray and published by National World, the parent company of Yorkshire Post Newspapers and which also publishes &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and scores of local papers and websites.

The &quot;Barnsley Chronicle&quot;″s local news coverage also extends to Hemsworth.

<doc id="596201" wikidata="Q999031" url="?curid=596201" title="Bight of Biafra">
<text>The Bight of Biafra, also known as the Bight of Bonny, is a bight off the west-central African coast, in the easternmost part of the Gulf of Guinea. This &quot;bight&quot; has also sometimes been erroneously referred to as the &quot;Bight of Africa&quot; because it is at this point where the direction of the Western coastline of the African continent most prominently changes from a North/ South orientation to an East/ West orientation.

==Geography==
The Bight of Biafra, between Cape Formosa and Cape Lopez, is the most eastern part of the Gulf of Guinea; it contains the islands Bioko (part of Equatorial Guinea), São Tomé and Príncipe. The name Biafra – as indicating the country – fell into disuse in the later part of the 19th century 

A 1710 map indicates that the region known as &quot;Biafar&quot; was located in present-day Cameroon.

The Bight of Biafra extends east from the River Delta of the Niger in the north until it reaches Cape Lopez in Gabon. Besides the Niger River, other rivers reaching the bay are the Cross River, Calabar River, Ndian, Wouri, Sanaga, Nyong River, Ntem, Mbia, Mbini, Muni and Komo River.

The main islands in the Bay are Bioko and Príncipe; other important islands are Ilhéu Bom Bom, Ilhéu Caroço, Elobey Grande and Elobey Chico. Countries located on the Bight of Biafra are Cameroon, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea (Bioko Island and Rio Muni), and Gabon

==History==

The Bight of Biafra accounted for an estimated 10.7% of all enslaved people that were transported to the Americas between 1519-1700. Between 1701-1800, it accounted for an estimated 14.97%. Slaves purchased from the markets on the Bight of Biafra included Bamileke, Efik/Ibibio, Igbo, Tikar, Bakossi, Fang, Massa, Bubi and many more. These captured Africans arrived in what would become the United States and were sold in Virginia, which held 60% of all slaves on the eastern coast. Virginia and surrounding colonies held 30,000 slaves. Normally, enslaved people were cheaper when bought in Cameroon because they preferred to die rather than accept slavery.

By the middle of the eighteenth century, Bonny had emerged as the major slave trading port on the Bight of Biafra outpacing the earlier dominant slave ports at Elem Kalabari (also known then as New Calabar) and Old Calabar. These 3 ports together accounted for over 90% of the slave trade emanating from the Bight of Biafra.

=== Timeline ===
Between 1525 and 1859, the British accounted for over two-thirds of slaves exported from the Bight of Biafra to the New World. 

In 1777, Portugal transferred control of Fernando Po and Annobón to Spanish suzerainty thus introducing Spain into the early colonial history of the Bight of Biafra.

In 1807, the United Kingdom made illegal the international trade in slaves, and the Royal Navy was deployed to forcibly prevent slavers from the United States, France, Spain, Portugal, Holland, West Africa and Arabia from plying their trade. 

On 30 June 1849, Britain established its military influence over the Bight of Biafra by building a naval base and consulate on the island of Fernando Po, under the authority of the British Consuls of the Bight of Benin: 

On 6 August 1861, the Bight of Biafra and the neighboring Bight of Benin (under its own British consuls) became a united British consulate, again under British consuls:
*May 1852–1853: Louis Fraser
* 1853-April 1859: Benjamin Campbell
* April 1859–1860: George Brand
* 1860-January 1861: Henry Hand
* January-May 1861: Henry Grant Foote
* May-6 August 1861: William McCoskry (acting)

* 1861-December 1864: Richard Francis Burton
* December 1864–1873: Charles Livingstone
* 1873-1878: George Hartley
* 1878-13 September 1879: David Hopkins
* 13 September 1879-5 June 1885: Edward Hyde Hewett.
In 1967, the Eastern Region of Nigeria seceded from the Nigerian State and adopted the name of its coastline, the adjoining Bight of Biafra, becoming the newly independent Republic of Biafra. This independence was short-lived as the new state lost the ensuing Nigerian Civil War. In 1975, by decree, the Nigerian government changed the name of the Bight of Biafra to the Bight of Bonny.

<doc id="596202" wikidata="Q16259235" url="?curid=596202" title="Sissyfight 2000">
<text>Sissyfight 2000 (stylised as SiSSYFiGHT 2000) is a turn-based strategy online game developed by the Word online magazine staff, including executive producer Marisa Bowe, producer Naomi Clark, lead programmer Ranjit Bhatnagar, and art director Yoshi Sodeoka, with game designer Eric Zimmerman. The original Shockwave version launched in 2000 but went offline in early 2009. A successful crowdfunding campaign was launched in early 2013 on Kickstarter by some members of the original development team, who announced the re-release of the game as open-source in HTML5. The original date for the game&#x27;s relaunch was September 2013, but was delayed. An open beta test, started on 30 July 2014, is currently underway.

The gameplay is simple on its surface, but requires solid strategy to win consistently. The graphics are also simple, and were inspired by the work of &quot;outsider artist&quot; Henry Darger, illustrator Edward Gorey, Japanese anime, and early, 8-bit video games of the 1980s. The game, which was inspired in part by Lucasfilm&#x27;s pioneering online role-playing game, &quot;Habitat&quot;, was designed to ignite community-building through chat both in the game and on its associate message boards.

In a departure from the androcentric norm in video games, all of the players in &quot;Sissyfight &quot;were rendered female and nonsexual. &quot;Sissyfight &quot;is often cited as an early example of a web-based MMOG in gaming development and academic circles. Although each game session only contained three to six players at a time, the mechanics of &quot;brownie points&quot; and the robust community surrounding &quot;Sissyfight &quot;created a much more &quot;massive&quot; experience than most small-scale web games.

==Gameplay==

Three to six players – called &quot;sissies&quot; – can play in a single game with each player beginning a round with ten hearts, each heart representing one &quot;self-esteem point&quot;. The turn-based game hides a player&#x27;s moves from the other players while in-game chat bubbles may be used to create alliances and coordinate their moves collectively. With each round, players try to eliminate each other&#x27;s self-esteem until only two (or occasionally one or none) are left standing and proclaimed the winners of that game on a classroom-style blackboard.

The moves that a player can select in each round are:
* Scratch: An attack which deals a -1 penalty to the defender. Can be countered with either a cower or a grab, and does double damage if the victim is being grabbed or licking a lolly.
* Grab: A passive attack which prevents the defender from scratching, teasing, or licking. It also sometimes prevents other players from grabbing. A grab also acts as a 2x multiplier against a defender when she is also being scratched.
* Tease: An attack entirely dependent on teamwork. A single-person tease (also called a &quot;solo tease&quot;) is ineffective against a defender. However, for every cumulative teaser added, the defender receives 2 damage. For example, two teasers do 4 damage, three do 6 damage, four do 8 damage, and five can wipe out a player in the first round with 10 damage. A single grab will nullify a two-person tease.
* Cower: A defensive move which can dodge a single scratch, grab, or tattle. Multiple cowers tried when there is no attack will receive a -1 penalty.
* Lick Your Lolly: A high-risk defensive move which normally adds 2 hit points. Since the maximum number of self-esteem points in the game is 10, licking with either 9 or 10 points wastes a lolly. If an attacker scratches someone licking, the licker will choke and receive a -2 penalty instead. A lick can also be stopped (with no penalty) if the licker is grabbed. Teases do not interfere with licks, but if a licker receives enough damage to be defeated with a tease, the player will be defeated, regardless of whether or not the lick would have allowed the licker to survive the tease. Each player can lick a total of three times in a single game.
* Tattle on Everyone: An attack which can potentially damage everyone else in the game. The tattle does 3 damage to anyone scratching, grabbing, teasing, or being grabbed or scratched. If two or more players tattle at the same time, the tattle backfires and does 3 damage to each tattler. A successful tattle can be dodged by a cower or a successful lick. Each player can tattle only twice in a single game.

Failure to select a move before the timer reaches zero results in -1 self-esteem point as a penalty, thereby gradually eliminating those who do not decide in time. However, many players tease out consistently indecisive players. Additionally, if all the players make their decisions with more than 10 seconds left on the timer, the timer accelerates to a countdown from 10, ending the round early.

===Cheating===
Players found several ways to cheat in the game. Most often, two players resort to using a third-party instant messaging service in order to coordinate their moves outside of the in-game chat interface. Other players developed more sophisticated methods, including running multiple sessions of the game and creating secondary or unregistered accounts (&quot;sock puppets&quot; or &quot;socks&quot;) to tilt a game&#x27;s outcome in their favor.

The Honor Code, &quot;Sissyfight&quot;&#x27;s terms of service, strictly forbids these behaviors. With the 2014 revival of the game, multisessioning has become more difficult; guest accounts are no longer allowed, and the game can now detect multiple sessions within the same browser.

===Game variations===
Players invented their own game variations, with unique rules. For example, &quot;Tease Tag&quot; required everyone to tease, while &quot;Tease The Slow&quot; required everyone to tease the last person to make a move. Other variations included a &quot;no cower&quot; rule, which was faster-paced and concentrated more on offense. Since these variants were not hard-coded into the original game, some players did not follow the special rules. As a result, the other players themselves often enforced the rules themselves by teasing out the rulebreakers.

The $25,000 &quot;stretch goal&quot; set by the development team for the 2013 Kickstarter campaign would have hard-coded some of these custom variations into the game. The funding ultimately fell short of meeting the stretch goal. However, in November 2013, the developers announced they would include custom game variations to compensate for missing their September 2013 deadline. The open beta test, running since 30 July 2014, includes settings for these custom game variations.

The 2014 revival features these hard-coded variations which are specifically created through the &quot;special&quot; option. Players may create their own game with a definitive title and identifier, which will have certain rules and challenges the normal game mode doesn&#x27;t use. Some modes will disable certain defensive moves like lolly licking and cowering, others will prevent tattling to slightly increase difficulty, and others will make the timer speed up. These can be combined to make rounds even more challenging.

==History==
&quot;Sissyfight &quot;was a surprise hit when it was launched in 2000. In 2001, it was a nominee for the Webby Awards in the Games category.

However, &quot;Sissyfight &quot;suffered from a lack of promotion and development after Zapata Corporation, its parent company, closed down Word late 2000. Nonetheless, the community proved strong enough to sustain itself, with unpaid administrator RamonaQ and a handful of volunteer moderators managing the game and message boards. Gamelab, a game development company founded by Zimmerman with other members of the original &quot;Sissyfight &quot;team on staff including programmer Ranjit Bhatnagar and designer Naomi Clark, maintained and ran the &quot;Sissyfight &quot;servers through April 2009.

Since its release, &quot;Sissyfight &quot;was consistently named a top internet game by online magazines and continued to remain popular among its regular players, even after the site became unavailable late April 2009.

===Demise===
On April 24, 2009, &quot;Sissyfight&quot; became unavailable. On April 28, 2009, long-time volunteer administrator RamonaQ announced on an unofficial message board that the site would not be returning anytime soon, as it was no longer being hosted.

===Return of Sissyfight===
On April 30, 2013, Zimmerman, Clark, and Bhatnagar announced a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter to revive &quot;Sissyfight&quot;. Their plans include re-coding the game in HTML5 to work in modern web browsers and mobile devices, releasing the code as open-source, adding new art, and provisioning servers utilizing modern technologies.

On May 28, 2013, the &quot;Sissyfight &quot;Kickstarter reached its $20,000 goal. The campaign was funded on May 30, 2013 with a final total of $22,735.

The game developers announced that they would not be providing any official message boards, choosing to leave that in the hands of the community. On August 8, 2013, a group of volunteers launched The SiSSYFiGHT 2000 Message Boards with the aim to reunite the community.

Two closed beta tests for the Kickstarter backers and their friends were held on January 17, 2014 and January 26, 2014. Each session lasted approximately two hours.

An open beta test began on July 30, 2014 and is currently running.

On February 9, 2018 the source code was released under the open-source MIT license and the assets under the CC BY Creative Commons license on GitHub.

<text>Claire&#x27;s (formerly known as Claire&#x27;s Boutiques, Claire&#x27;s Boutique and Claire&#x27;s Accessories) is an American retailer of accessories, jewelry, and toys primarily aimed towards tween and teen
girls, and young women. It was founded in 1961 and is based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. The company is primarily owned by Elliott Management and Monarch Alternative Capital, but, in 2022, announced plans to go public with an initial public offering.

, Claire&#x27;s had 3,469 stores in 37 countries. Claire&#x27;s claims it has done more ear piercings than any other retailer, totaling at over 100 million in 25+ years.

==History==

In 1961, Rowland Schaefer founded Fashion Tress Industries, a company that sold wigs and became the world&#x27;s largest retailer for fashion wigs. In 1973, Fashion Tress acquired Claire&#x27;s, a 25-store jewelry chain, and began shifting its focus towards a line of fashion jewelry and accessories under the new name, Claire&#x27;s Accessories, Inc. Claire&#x27;s Accessories began providing ear piercing services in 1978 and, in 1980, established a Hong Kong-based sourcing office. During the 1980s, Claire&#x27;s Accessories opened new stores throughout the United States and bought Topkapi, a Japanese chain of 16 stores, in 1989. Claire&#x27;s Accessories continued acquiring companies in the 1990s, including Bow Bangles — a British chain with 71 stores in England, Wales, and Scotland — in 1995; two American chains, The Icing (85 stores) and Accessory Place (31 stores), in 1996; and Bijoux One, a Swiss chain, in 1998. The Icing would become the company&#x27;s primary brand for women in their 20s. In 1999, Claire&#x27;s purchased Cleopatre, a chain in Paris with 42 stores, for $11 million cash, as well the American chain, Afterthoughts. Afterthoughts stores were converted to Icing stores after they were purchased. In 1997, the business changed its name to Claire&#x27;s. In 2001, claires.com was launched. In 2002, the company purchased the US-based clothing chain Mr. Rags.

Claire&#x27;s was a publicly-traded company listed on the NASDAQ in 2005, but was taken private by the private equity firm Apollo Global Management in a $3.1 billion leveraged buyout in 2007. In 2008, Claire&#x27;s consolidated its European operations into one group with headquarters in Birmingham. The first stores in Ukraine were opened in 2010. In 2011, e-commerce operations were launched in the United States, alongside the opening of stores in India and Mexico. In 2012, Claire&#x27;s expanded its international presence by opening its first stores in China, Italy, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Dominican Republic, Panama, and Honduras.

In 2018, Claire&#x27;s filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. By 2022, Claire&#x27;s had exited bankruptcy, announced preliminary sales growth for fiscal year 2021 of 53% on revenue of $1.4 billion, and announced plans for an initial public offering. The company&#x27;s new strategy involves shuttering stores in underperforming locations in favor of &quot;prestige&quot; malls, as well as setting up kiosk shops within drug and grocery store chains.

==Offices==
 Claire&#x27;s had 6 offices:
* Hoffman Estates, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago): Global HQ, North America HQ, North America Distribution Center
* Birmingham: Europe HQ, Europe Distribution Center
* Hong Kong: Sourcing &amp; Buying, International Distribution Center
* Pembroke Pines, Florida (a suburb of Miami): Accounting
* Paris: Field Support
* Madrid: Field Support

===Illinois office===
Claire&#x27;s has its Illinois offices in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. The facility is a brown brick building off of Interstate 90, near Barrington Road. The building serves as Claire&#x27;s distribution center and main facility, and all merchandise is routed through this facility. Its products, which, as of 1996, are mainly imported, are distributed and marketed through the Hoffman Estates location. The company&#x27;s buying, distribution, and marketing divisions are in the Hoffman Estates facility. As of 1996, 236 full-time employees and several temporary employees worked in the facility. Leslie Mann of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that the facility &quot;contrasts with Claire&#x27;s glittery stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Japan.&quot; Mann added, &quot;Except for the prototype store in the lobby and the fashion accessories that line the walls of the buyers&#x27; offices, the center is unremarkable.&quot;

A facility in Wood Dale, Illinois, used to serve the purposes now held by the Hoffman Estates office. In early January 1995, Pfizer sold its Hoffman Estates headquarters building for $7.4 million to Claire&#x27;s so it could consolidate its operations in Memphis, Tennessee. At the time, the Hoffman Estates office had of space. In 1998, Claire&#x27;s announced plans to build a two-story office building and a warehouse at the Hoffman Estates site. This would double the total amount of space at the Illinois site.

===Florida office===
Its Florida office in Pembroke Pines, Florida, in Greater Miami. The Florida offices are west of the intersection of Flamingo Road and Pines Boulevard. It has of space in its Florida offices. The current CEO for Claire&#x27;s is Ryan Vero As of 1997 the CEO has his office in Pembroke Pines. In addition, the company&#x27;s customer service and investor relations divisions are located in the Pembroke Pines offices. In November 1990 Claire&#x27;s moved its Florida offices from northern Dade County to Pembroke Pines. The former headquarters in Dade County had of space.

== Store types ==


Claire&#x27;s stores average about 1,000 square feet, are typically located in malls and shopping centers, and carry the widest selection of merchandise among Claire&#x27;s brands. Merchandise is targeted at different age groups ranging from children to young adults. Customers can find earrings, necklaces, bracelets, purses, hair accessories, fashion accessories, stuffed animals, makeup, and licensed merchandise. Stores are merchandised to accommodate different ages, and fashion trends are manipulated to appeal to all ages. Toys &quot;R&quot; Us also included a Claire&#x27;s section for preteen and teenage girls.

In North America, Claire&#x27;s also operates under the Icing brand, targeted toward older teens and young women aged 19–28. The merchandise is more expensive and has a more sophisticated look. Most items include accessories and jewelry, but merchandise also includes items such as candles, mineral-based cosmetics, birthday accessories, bachelorette and wedding accessories, and footwear. Icing typically does not offer licensed merchandise.
== Merchandise ==
Claire&#x27;s sells fashion accessories that are geared towards children, tweens, teens, and young adults and are meant to imitate high-end fashion trends. Costume jewelry, imitation jewelry of precious gems and materials like pearls and diamonds, licensed merchandise, body jewelry, hair accessories, make-up, stuffed animals and clothing items are usually available for purchase; Claire&#x27;s also carries its own range of perfumes.

The store&#x27;s merchandise is often divided into sections. Claire&#x27;s Club is a line of accessories aimed at children under seven years old, featuring princess-themed jewelry and accessories with children&#x27;s musicians such as Sophia Grace &amp; Rosie. The rest of the store is aimed at tweens, teens and young adults.

Claire&#x27;s also carries an assortment of seasonal holiday items, such as for Valentine&#x27;s Day, St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, Easter, 4th of July, Halloween, and Christmas.

Some locations subsequently cater ear piercing, as all staff are fully trained in using a Studex instrument. Claire&#x27;s starts piercing customers at the age of four months with their immunizations and does not pierce the cartilage of people under 14 years of age. Although the target customers are girls and young women, as fashion trends have changed, the place has also become popular for young boys to get their ears pierced.

== Asbestos recalls ==
Claire&#x27;s have been subject to numerous cases of alleged &quot;asbestos presence&quot; in its products. These traces have been found in products containing talcum powder, a naturally occurring silicate substance. Talcum powder has been known to contain traces of asbestos, a recognized human carcinogen. On March 5, 2019, Claire&#x27;s stated that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) believed some of the company&#x27;s products may have been contaminated with asbestos. Claire&#x27;s stated that the FDA had &quot;mis-characterized fibers in the products as asbestos, in direct contradiction to established EPA and USP criterion for classifying asbestos fibers&quot;. 

On March 11, 2019, the FDA tested more Claire&#x27;s products, indicating &quot;the possible presence of asbestos&quot;. The affected products were sold between October 2016 to March 2019. In response to the FDA claim, Claire&#x27;s stated they continue to have confidence in the safety of their products, however also issued a voluntary recall and advised consumers to discontinue use. On May 30, 2019, a JoJo Siwa cosmetic kit was voluntarily recalled due to the FDA warning consumers of &quot;the possible presence of asbestos&quot;. The powder eyeshadow element of the kit was affected due to the possible presence of &quot;trace amounts of asbestos fibers&quot;. Claire&#x27;s stated these trace amounts were acceptable by European and Canadian cosmetic regulations, and they had ended the use of talcum powder in its products. 

The company still &quot;continues to have confidence in the safety and composition of its products&quot; and &quot;is not aware of any adverse reactions, injuries or illness caused by the possible presence of asbestos in the recalled products&quot;. Siwa posted a video informing her audience that Claire&#x27;s would accept refunds of products new and used, stating she puts her &quot;trust into other people&#x27;s hands&quot; with her products and was working to recall items from all shelves.&#x27;

<text>Joan Bogle Hickson (5 August 1906 – 17 October 1998) was an English actress of theatre, film and television. She was known for her role as Agatha Christie&#x27;s Miss Marple in the television series &quot;Miss Marple&quot;. She also narrated a number of &quot;Miss Marple&quot; stories on audiobooks.

==Biography==
Born in Kingsthorpe, Northampton, Hickson was a daughter of Edith Mary (née Bogle) and Alfred Harold Hickson, a shoe manufacturer. After boarding at Oldfield School in Swanage, Dorset, she went on to train at RADA in London. She made her stage debut in 1927, then worked for several years throughout the United Kingdom, achieving success playing comedic, often eccentric characters in the West End of London. She played the role of the cockney maid Ida in the original production of &quot;See How They Run&quot; at the Q Theatre in 1944, and then at the Comedy Theatre in January 1945.

She made her first film appearance in 1934. The numerous supporting roles she played during her career included several in &quot;Carry On&quot; films, notably Sister in &quot;Carry On Nurse&quot; and Mrs May in &quot;Carry On Constable&quot;.

In the 1940s she appeared on stage in &quot;Appointment with Death&quot;, a play by Agatha Christie, who wrote in a note to her, &quot;I will call you to play my &#x27;Miss Marple&#x27; one day, if I can find the time to write another play&quot;.

In 1961 Hickson played the housekeeper in the film &quot;Murder, She Said&quot;, based on Agatha Christie&#x27;s novel &quot;4.50 From Paddington&quot; and starring Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple. 
From 1963 to 1966 Hickson played Mrs Peace, housekeeper to the Reverend Stephen Young, played by Donald Sinden, in the highly rated TV series &quot;Our Man at St Mark&#x27;s&quot;. From 1970 to 1971 she played Mrs Pugsley in &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;. She also played Mrs Chambers in &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot;. In 1986 she played the part of Mrs Trellis in the film &quot;Clockwise&quot;. Also in 1986 she appeared in episode 2 of the drama series &quot;ScreenPlay&quot;.

Her stage career included roles in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, the musical &quot;The Card&quot; (1975), adapted by Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent from the novel by Arnold Bennett; and Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Bedroom Farce&quot;, for which she won a 1979 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play and had been nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Comedy Performance in 1977. In 1980 she appeared as Mrs Rivington in &quot;Why Didn&#x27;t They Ask Evans?&quot;, yet another production based on a novel by Agatha Christie.

The BBC began filming the works of Agatha Christie in the mid-1980s, and set out to remain faithful to the plotlines and locales of Christie&#x27;s stories, and to represent Miss Marple as written. Hickson played the role of Miss Marple in all 12 adaptations, which were produced from 1984 to 1992; she received two BAFTA nominations for Best TV Actress, in 1987 and 1988. When the OBE was bestowed on Hickson in June 1987 Queen Elizabeth II was reported to have said, &quot;You play the part just as one envisages it.&quot; When Hickson retired from the role, believing that she should stop while the programme was still at the peak of its popularity, she stated that she had no intention of retiring from acting altogether.

==Wivenhoe==

From 1958, Hickson lived at 2 Rose Lane, Wivenhoe, along the River Colne from London in Essex, until her death in 1998. A plaque now marks the house where she lived for 40 years.

==Marriage==
Hickson married Dr Eric Norman Butler (born 2 September 1902 in Westbury, Wiltshire), a physician, at Hampstead Parish Church, Hampstead, Northwest London, on 29 October 1932. They had two children. Her husband died in Colchester, Essex, in June 1967.

==Death==
Hickson died of a stroke at Colchester General Hospital in 1998 at the age of 92. She is interred under her married name, Joan Bogle Butler, at Sidbury Cemetery in Devon.

<text>The Mousetrap is a murder mystery play by Agatha Christie. The play opened in London&#x27;s West End in 1952 and ran continuously until 16 March 2020, when the stage performances had to be temporarily discontinued during the COVID-19 pandemic. It then re-opened on 17 May 2021. The longest-running West End show, it also has by far the longest run of any play in the world, with its 29,500th performance having taken place as of February 2024. Attendees at St Martin&#x27;s Theatre often get their photo taken beside the wooden counter (showing a count of the number of performances) in the theatre foyer. As of 2022 the play has been seen by 10 million people in London.

A whodunit, the play has a twist ending which the audience are traditionally asked not to reveal after leaving the theatre. There are eight members of the cast, and by 2012 more than 400 actors had played the roles. Richard Attenborough was the original Detective Sergeant Trotter, and his wife, Sheila Sim, the first Mollie Ralston – owner of Monkswell Manor guesthouse. However, since then few of the cast have been headliners, with Stephen Moss in &quot;The Guardian&quot; writing that &quot;the play and its author are the stars&quot;.

==History==

The play began life as a short radio play written by Agatha Christie as a birthday present for Queen Mary, the consort of King George V. It was broadcast on 30 May 1947 under the name &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;. The story drew from the real-life case of Dennis O&#x27;Neill, who died after he and his brother Terence suffered extreme abuse while in the foster care of a Shropshire farmer and his wife in 1945.

The play is based on a short story, itself based on the radio play, but Christie asked that the story not be published as long as it ran as a play in the West End of London. The short story has still not been published within the UK but it has appeared in the US in the 1950 collection &quot;Three Blind Mice and Other Stories&quot;.

When she wrote the play, Christie gave the rights to her grandson Mathew Prichard as a birthday present. In the United Kingdom, only one production of the play in addition to the West End production can be performed annually, and under the contract terms of the play, no film adaptation can be produced until the West End production has been closed for at least six months. Producer John Woolf bought the film rights to the play in 1956, but Woolf and his heirs have been unable to produce an adaptation because the play has never closed. Woolf&#x27;s son Jonathan hired Stuart Urban to write a screenplay for an adaptation of the play in the late 1990s, but the play&#x27;s producers blocked Woolf from making the film. After unsuccessfully attempting to acquire the film rights to the play, Damian Jones was inspired to produce a film more loosely based on the play. Jones&#x27; idea became the 2022 film &quot;See How They Run&quot;, a murder mystery which takes place at the West End production of &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; in 1953, in which the murder victim is a director who has been hired to direct a film adaptation of the play.

The play had to be renamed at the insistence of Emile Littler who had produced a play called &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; in the West End before the Second World War. The suggestion to call it &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; came from Christie&#x27;s son-in-law, Anthony Hicks. In William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; is Hamlet&#x27;s answer to Claudius&#x27;s inquiry about the name of the play whose prologue and first scene the court has just observed (III, ii). The play is actually &quot;The Murder of Gonzago&quot;, but Hamlet answers metaphorically, since &quot;the play&#x27;s the thing&quot; in which he intends to &quot;catch the conscience of the king.&quot; The nursery rhyme &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; or its tune is heard a few times during the play.

The play&#x27;s longevity has ensured its popularity with tourists from around the world. In 1997, at the initiative of producer Stephen Waley-Cohen, the theatrical education charity Mousetrap Theatre Projects was launched, helping young people experience London&#x27;s theatre.

The play&#x27;s storyline is set at &quot;the present&quot;, which presumably means England as it was around the time when the play came out in 1952, including postwar continuation of World War II rationing.

Tom Stoppard&#x27;s 1968 play &quot;The Real Inspector Hound&quot; parodies many elements of &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, including the surprise ending.

==Theatrical performances==
As a stage play, &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; had its world premiere at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham, on 6 October 1952. It was originally directed by Peter Cotes, elder brother of John and Roy Boulting, the film directors. Its pre-West End tour then took it to the New Theatre Oxford, the Manchester Opera House, the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool, the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, the Grand Theatre Leeds and the Alexandra Theatre in Birmingham, before it began its run in London on 25 November 1952 at the Ambassadors Theatre. It ran at this theatre until Saturday, 23 March 1974 when it immediately transferred to the larger St Martin&#x27;s Theatre, next door, where it reopened on Monday, 25 March, thus keeping its &quot;initial run&quot; status. The London run has now exceeded 29,000 performances. David Turner was the director of the play from 1987 to 2004.

Christie herself did not expect &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; to run for such a long time. In her autobiography, she reports a conversation that she had with Peter Saunders: &quot;Fourteen months I am going to give it&quot;, says Saunders. To which Christie replies, &quot;It won&#x27;t run that long. Eight months perhaps. Yes, I think eight months.&quot; When it broke the record for the longest run of a play in the West End in September 1957, Christie received a mildly grudging telegram from fellow playwright Noël Coward: &quot;Much as it pains me I really must congratulate you ...&quot; In 2011 (by which time &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; had been running for almost 59 years), this long-lost document was found by a Cotswold furniture maker who was renovating a bureau purchased by a client from the Christie estate.
By the time of Christie&#x27;s death in 1976, the play had made more than £3 million. Prichard, who was only nine when he was given the copyright of the play, set up the Colwinston Charitable Trust in 1995 to use the money from productions of the play. The trust supports charities for the arts, mainly in Wales.

The original West End cast included Richard Attenborough as Detective Sergeant Trotter and his wife Sheila Sim as Mollie Ralston. They took a 10% profit-participation in the production, which was paid for out of their combined weekly salary (&quot;It proved to be the wisest business decision I&#x27;ve ever made ... but foolishly I sold some of my share to open a short-lived Mayfair restaurant called &#x27;The Little Elephant&#x27; and later still, disposed of the remainder in order to keep &quot;Gandhi&quot; afloat.&quot;)

Since the retirement of Mysie Monte and David Raven, who each made history by remaining in the cast for more than 11 years in their roles as Mrs Boyle and Major Metcalf, the cast has been changed annually. The change usually occurs around late November around the anniversary of the play&#x27;s opening, and was the initiative of Sir Peter Saunders, the original producer. There is a tradition of the retiring leading lady and the new leading lady cutting a &quot;Mousetrap cake&quot; together.

The play has also made theatrical history by having an original &quot;cast member&quot; survive all the cast changes since its opening night. The late Deryck Guyler can still be heard, via a recording, reading the radio news bulletin in the play to this present day. The set was changed in 1965 and 1999, but one prop survives from the original opening – the clock which sits on the mantelpiece of the fireplace in the main hall.
Notable milestones in the play&#x27;s history include:
* 6 October 1952 – First performance at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham

In May 2001, during the London production&#x27;s 49th year, and to mark the 25th anniversary of Christie&#x27;s death, the cast gave a semi-staged Sunday performance at the Palace Theatre, Westcliff-on-Sea as a guest contribution to the &quot;Agatha Christie Theatre Festival 2001&quot;, a 12-week history-making cycle of all of Agatha Christie&#x27;s plays presented by Roy Marsden&#x27;s New Palace Theatre Company.

Performances at the St. Martin&#x27;s Theatre were halted on 16 March 2020, along with all other West End shows, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; re-opened on 17 May 2021 after 14 months without performances.

===Other stagings===
A staging at the Toronto Truck Theatre in Toronto, Ontario, that opened on 19 August 1977 became Canada&#x27;s longest running show, before finally closing on 18 January 2004 after a run of 26 years and over 9,000 performances.

On 18 November 2012, both the 25,000th performance and the 60th year of the production were marked by a special charity performance which featured Hugh Bonneville, Patrick Stewart, Julie Walters and Miranda Hart. The money raised by the performance went towards Mousetrap Theatre Projects.

During the diamond anniversary year of &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, a touring production visited regional theatres for the first time in its history, whilst the London run continued uninterrupted.

The play has also been presented internationally: in 2013 in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok by the British Theatre Playhouse. 
The play has been staged in Queensland, Australia several times. In September 2011, it was staged at The Mousetrap Theatre in Redcliffe, the theatre group having been named after Christie&#x27;s play. From July to August 2019, the Toowoomba Repertory Theatre Society performed the play in their home city. In November 2022, &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; was performed in Brisbane, the state&#x27;s capital. In December 2022, after more than 70 years, the first Broadway production of &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; was announced to be staged in 2023 with an all-American cast.

==Twist ending and tradition of secrecy==
The murderer&#x27;s identity is divulged near the end of the play, in a twist ending that is unusual for playing with the very basis of the traditional whodunnit formula, where the cliché is that the detective solves the crime and exposes the remaining plot secrets. By tradition, at the end of each performance, audiences are asked not to reveal the identity of the killer to anyone outside the theatre, to ensure that the end of the play is not spoiled for future audiences.

Christie was always upset by the plots of her works being revealed in reviews. In 2010, her grandson Mathew Prichard, who receives the royalties from the play, said he was &quot;dismayed&quot; to learn from &quot;The Independent&quot; that the ending to &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; had been described in the play&#x27;s Wikipedia article.

Duncan Leatherdale of BBC News contrasted the play to other works like &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, where the plot twist has been revealed and became itself an element of popular culture.

== Plot ==

The play is set in the Great Hall of Monkswell Manor, Berkshire, in what Christie described as &quot;the present&quot;.

===Act I===
Act I opens with the murder of a woman named Maureen Lyon, played out in sound only. The action then moves to Monkswell Manor, recently converted to a guesthouse and run by a young couple, Mollie and Giles Ralston. While waiting for the guests to arrive, Mollie listens to a radio report about the Lyon murder, which notes that police are looking for a man in a dark overcoat, observed near the scene.

Their four guests arrive. Christopher Wren is an unkempt, flighty young man. Giles reacts strongly to Wren with instant dislike and Mollie with instinctual trust. Mrs Boyle and Major Metcalf then arrive together in a taxi from the station. Mrs Boyle complains about many things; Metcalf is an amiable ex-military man. Miss Casewell, a mannish young woman, is the last of the booked guests to arrive, before an unexpected fifth party appears. Identifying himself in a foreign accent as Mr Paravicini, he tells the Ralstons his car has overturned in a snowdrift. He remarks that the snow has blocked the roads and that the denizens of the house are trapped. Uneasy about Paravicini&#x27;s manner, Mollie nevertheless places him in the last remaining room.

The next afternoon the guest house proves to be snowed in, and the residents are restless. Mollie answers the telephone. Superintendent Hogben of the Berkshire Police tells her that he is dispatching Sergeant Trotter to the guest house, and that the Ralstons must listen carefully to what Trotter has to tell them. The Ralstons wonder what they could have done to garner police attention.

Trotter appears at the door on a pair of skis, and Major Metcalf discovers that the phone has stopped working.

Trotter explains he has been sent in regard to the murder of Maureen Lyon. In a story loosely based on the real Dennis O&#x27;Neill case, the dead woman and her husband had mistreated their three foster children, resulting in the death of the youngest. Both adults were imprisoned for their actions; the husband died in gaol, while the wife served her sentence and had been released, only to be found strangled. Police suspect the elder boy of the abused children, who would now be twenty-two, of being the killer.

Trotter reveals that a notebook found at the murder scene contained the address of Monkswell Manor and the words &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;. A note reading &quot;This is the First&quot; was pinned to the woman&#x27;s body. The police have sent Trotter to find out how the Ralstons&#x27; guesthouse is connected to the murder and whether the residents are in danger. Both Giles and Mollie deny a connection to the case, though Mollie is ill at ease answering Trotter&#x27;s questions and quickly excuses herself. Trotter asks each of the guests to explain why they are at Monkswell Manor and any connection they have to the foster children. All five guests deny any personal knowledge of the case.

While Trotter and Giles tour the house, Major Metcalf confronts Mrs Boyle, revealing that she was one of the magistrates who had assigned the children to the foster parents. Mrs Boyle acknowledges this but denies that she has any responsibility for what eventually happened to the children there.

As the evening wears on, Giles and Mollie become suspicious of each other while the guests snipe at one another. Sergeant Trotter traces the phone wire to find out if it has been cut. Mrs Boyle wanders back into the now-empty room and listens to the radio. The opening notes of &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; are heard whistled by an unknown party and Mrs Boyle responds without alarm, speaking to the person only she can see. Suddenly, the lights go out and a scuffle is heard. Moments later, Mollie walks into the room and turns on the lights, only to find Mrs Boyle dead on the floor.

===Act II===
Ten minutes after Mollie finds Mrs Boyle dead of strangulation, Sergeant Trotter takes charge of the household. All the remaining residents are gathered in one room as he attempts to sort out the events of the evening. A shaken Mollie Ralston cannot provide him with any useful clues; the only thing she is sure she observed was the radio blaring. Frustrated, Trotter points out that their lives continue to be in danger; a third murder could very well happen, given the notes left with Maureen Lyon. He insists that everyone tell him where they were when Mrs Boyle was murdered. As each person recounts his or her whereabouts, Trotter takes them to account for inconsistencies or weaknesses in their stories. Finally, he declares that everyone in the house had the opportunity to commit the murder, since each of them was alone at the time. Giles counters that while seven people in the house lack alibis, only one fits the description of the man the police suspect to be the murderer: Christopher Wren. Wren insists that it is all a frame-up, and Trotter acknowledges that he lacks any evidence pointing to Wren in particular.

Mollie later pulls Trotter aside; Trotter says that while the police suspect the elder boy to be the killer, the dead boy also had relatives and loved ones who might be interested in revenge: the children&#x27;s father, an army sergeant, for example; or the dead boy&#x27;s sister, who would now be a young woman. Trotter notes that Metcalf or Paravicini could be the father, Miss Casewell or Mollie could be the sister, and Giles could be the elder boy. Mollie, aghast, objects to the notion that either she or Giles could be a murderer, but Trotter forces her to admit that they know little about each other&#x27;s pasts.

Mollie soon finds herself in conversation with Christopher Wren, who confesses that he is actually an army deserter hiding from his past under a false name. Mollie acknowledges that she, too, is running away from her past. Despite the trust Christopher and Mollie are forming, he and Giles each suspect the other and nearly come to blows over Mollie. The situation is only defused by the arrival of Paravicini, who tells the company that Trotter&#x27;s skis are missing.

Trotter again calls an assembly of the household, declaring that he now intends to check the alibis everyone provided to him after Mrs Boyle&#x27;s murder. They will re-enact the murder, with each member of the household acting out another&#x27;s alibi. Trotter&#x27;s hope is that while most of the alibis will be verified, one will be proved impossible. Each person is to go to his or her assigned position and stay there until summoned back by Trotter. The household obediently disperses, leaving Trotter alone onstage.

=== Identity of the murderer ===

After the role-players scatter, Trotter sits for a moment before calling for Mollie. He tells her that she has risked extreme danger by not identifying herself to him; he now knows that she was once the schoolteacher of the doomed Corrigan children. She failed to answer a letter the younger boy sent her at the time, begging to be rescued from the farm. Mollie protests that she had been seriously ill when the letter arrived and was unable to even read it until well after the boy was dead. To this day, she says, she is haunted by her failure to help the children out of their circumstances.

Trotter takes a gun out of his pocket and points it at Mollie, telling her that she had only assumed him to be a policeman based on the telephone call. He had in fact impersonated Hogben, then cut the telephone wires himself upon arriving at the house. Trotter is actually Georgie, the elder Corrigan brother, and he intends to take his revenge on Mollie. Falling back into the demeanour of a wounded child who never grew up, he drops his gun and begins to strangle Mollie, but is stopped by the sudden appearance of Miss Casewell. She calls him by name and reveals that she is his long-lost sister Kathy, come to take him somewhere safe. Major Metcalf, who accompanied Miss Casewell into the room, summons Giles and tells the frightened innkeepers that he had known all along that Trotter was not a policeman – because Metcalf himself is one, having arranged to take the place of the real Metcalf after discovering the &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; notebook on Maureen Lyon.

==Critical reception==
The play made little stir in the review pages of the British press when it opened. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; commented that it was &quot;a middling piece&quot; with &quot;less in it than meets the eye ... Coincidence is stretched unreasonably.&quot; The critic commented that the characters were &quot;built entirely of clichés&quot;. The reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; was more favourably disposed to the characters, calling them &quot;nicely assorted, individually labelled and readily identified&quot;, and found the plot &quot;elaborately skilful.&quot; In &quot;The Daily Express&quot;, John Barber praised &quot;the atmosphere of shuddering suspense&quot; but thought some of the characters &quot;too obvious by half&quot;. In &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, J. C. Trewin commented that those who failed to spot the killer would probably call the plot &quot;preposterous and over-burdened&quot;, but those who succeeded might be more kindly disposed.

==Publication history==
The play was published as a paperback by Samuel French Ltd as &quot;French&#x27;s Acting Edition No. 153&quot; in 1954 and is still in print. It was first published in hardback in &quot;The Mousetrap and Other Plays&quot; by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons in 1978 ().

==Film and television versions==
In 1959, it was announced that Edward Small, who had produced &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; for the screen, was to make a film version of the play in co-production with Victor Saville for United Artists. Tyrone Power and Maria Schell were named as leads. However, no film resulted. In 1960, the Bengali author Premendra Mitra directed a film &quot;Chupi Chupi Aashey&quot;, based on the radio play and short story. In 1990, Russian film director Samson Samsonov directed a film titled &quot;Мышеловка&quot; (&quot;Myshelovka&quot;, English: &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;) at Mosfilm. The script by Vladimir Basov is based on Christie&#x27;s play.

In 2022, the story of a British-American film &quot;See How They Run&quot; was set in the Ambassadors Theatre and concerned in-story actors of &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, following murders of personnel involved in the production of and linked to the play.

<text>The original Tristan chord is heard in the opening phrase of Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; as part of the leitmotif relating to Tristan. It is made up of the notes F, B, D, and G:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
 \new PianoStaff «
 \new Staff «
 \relative c&#x27; {

 &lt;dis gis&gt;1
 »
 \new Staff «
 \relative c {
 \clef bass \key c \major \time 4/4
 &lt;f b&gt;1
 »
}
&lt;/score&gt;
More generally, the term refers to any chord that consists of the same intervals: augmented fourth, augmented sixth, and augmented ninth above a bass note.

==Background==
The notes of the Tristan chord are not unusual; they could be respelled enharmonically to form a common half-diminished seventh chord. What distinguishes the Tristan chord is its unusual relationship to the implied key of its surroundings.

&lt;/score&gt;

This motif also appears in measures 6, 10, and 12, several times later in the work, and at the end of the last act.

 points out the &quot;chord&quot; in earlier works by Guillaume de Machaut, Carlo Gesualdo, J. S. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, or Louis Spohr as in the following example from the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 18:

&lt;/score&gt;

The chord is found in several works by Chopin, from as early as 1828, in the Sonata in C minor, Op. 4 and his Scherzo No. 1, composed in 1830. It is only in late works where tonal ambiguities similar to Wagner&#x27;s arise, as in the Prelude in A minor, Op. 28, No. 2, and the posthumously published Mazurka in F minor, Op. 68, No. 4.

The Tristan chord&#x27;s significance is in its move away from traditional tonal harmony, and even toward atonality. With this chord, Wagner actually provoked the &quot;sound&quot; or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its function, a notion that was soon explored by Debussy and others. In the words of Robert Erickson, &quot;The Tristan chord is, among other things, an identifiable sound, an entity beyond its functional qualities in a tonal organization&quot;.

==Analysis==

Much has been written about the Tristan chord&#x27;s possible harmonic functions or voice leading and the motif has been interpreted in various ways. Though enharmonically equivalent to the half-diminished seventh chord F7 (F–A–C–E), the Tristan chord can also be interpreted in many ways. Nattiez distinguishes between functional and nonfunctional analyses of the chord.

===Functional analyses===
Functional analyses have interpreted the chord in the key of A minor in many ways:
*The chord is an augmented sixth chord, specifically a French sixth chord, F–B–D-A, with the note G heard as an appoggiatura resolving to A. (Theorists debate the root of French sixth chords.) The harmonic function as a predominant is intact, with the chord moving to V7. Note that, in this view, the G# resolving upward to A is the 2nd of 3 consecutive accented dissonances resolving by half step. Alfred Lorenz and others interpret it more broadly as an augmented sixth chord F–A–D, based after Hugo Riemann on the principle that there are only three chord functions: tonic, predominant, and dominant.
*The root is the second scale degree, B. 
*The root is the fourth scale degree, D. Arend interprets it as &quot;a modified minor seventh chord&quot;
:: F–B–D–G → F–C–E–A → F–B–D–A = D–F–A
*The chord is a secondary dominant, V/V, and thus also with a root on B. This favors the fifth motion from B to E, seeing the chord as a seventh chord with lowered fifth (B–D(D)–F–A).

Vincent d&#x27;Indy analyses the chord as a IV chord after Riemann&#x27;s transcendent principle (as phrased by Serge Gut: &quot;the most classic succession in the world: Tonic, Predominant, Dominant&quot; ) and rejects the idea of an added &quot;lowered seventh&quot;, eliminates &quot;all artificial, dissonant notes, arising solely from the melodic motion of the voices, and therefore foreign to the chord,&quot; finding that the Tristan chord is &quot;no more than a predominant in the key of A, collapsed in upon itself melodically, the harmonic progression represented thus:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 \new PianoStaff «
 \new Staff «
 \relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \key c \major \time 3/4
 &lt;d a&#x27;&gt;2. &lt;e b&#x27;&gt;
 »
 \new Staff «
 \relative c {
 \clef bass \key c \major \time 3/4
 &lt;f a&gt;2._\markup { \concat { &quot;IV&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;6&quot; \hspace #3.5 &quot;V&quot; } } &lt;e gis&gt;
 »
}
&lt;/score&gt;

, independently, sees the G as an appoggiatura to A, describing that
According to Jacques, discussing Dommel-Diény and Gut, &quot;it is rooted in a simple dominant chord of A &quot;minor&quot; [E major], which includes two appoggiaturas resolved in the normal way&quot;. Thus, in this view it is not a chord but an anticipation of the dominant chord in measure three. Chailley did once write:

Fred Lerdahl presents alternate interpretations of the Tristan motive, as either i ii643 [French sixth: F–B–D–A] V7 or as VI (iv) (vii642) [ altered pre-dominant: F–B–D–G] V7, both in A minor, concluding that while both interpretations have strong expectation or attraction, that the version with G is the stronger progression.

===Nonfunctional analyses===
Nonfunctional analyses are based on structure (rather than function), and are characterized as vertical characterizations or linear analyses.

Vertical characterizations include interpreting the chord&#x27;s root as on the seventh degree (VII), of F minor.

Linear analyses include that of Noske and Schenker was the first to analyze the motif entirely through melodic concerns. Schenker and later Mitchell compare the Tristan chord to a dissonant contrapuntal gesture from the E minor fugue of &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, Book I.

William Mitchell, viewing the Tristan chord from a Schenkerian perspective, does not see the G as an appoggiatura because the melodic line (G–A–A–B) ascends to B, making the A a passing note. This &quot;ascent&quot; by minor third is mirrored by the descending line (F–E–D–D), a &quot;descent&quot; by minor third, making the D, like A, an appoggiatura. This makes the chord a diminished seventh chord (G–B–D–F).

Serge Gut argues that, &quot;if one focuses essentially on melodic motion, one sees how its dynamic force creates a sense of an appoggiatura each time, that is, at the beginning of each measure, creating a mood both feverish and tense ... thus in the soprano motif, the G and the A are heard as appoggiaturas, as the F and D in the initial motif.&quot; The chord is thus a minor chord with an added sixth (D–F–A–B) on the fourth degree (IV), though it is engendered by melodic waves.

Allen first identifies the chord as an atonal set, 4–27 (half-diminished seventh chord), then &quot;elect[s] to place that consideration in a secondary, even tertiary position compared to the most dynamic aspect of the opening music, which is clearly the large-scale ascending motion that develops in the upper voice, in its entirety a linear projection of the Tristan Chord transposed to level three, g′–b′–d″–f″.

Schoenberg describes it as a &quot;wandering chord [vagierender Akkord]... it can come from anywhere&quot;.

===Mayrberger&#x27;s opinion===
After summarizing the above analyses Nattiez asserts that the context of the Tristan chord is A minor, and that analyses which say the key is E major or E minor are &quot;wrong&quot;. He privileges analyses of the chord as on the second degree (II). He then supplies a Wagner-approved analysis, that of Czech professor Carl Mayrberger who &quot;places the chord on the second degree, and interprets the G as an appoggiatura. But above all, Mayrberger considers the attraction between the E and the real bass F to be paramount, and calls the Tristan chord a &quot;Zwitterakkord&quot; (an ambiguous, hybrid, or possibly bisexual or androgynous, chord), whose F is controlled by the key of A minor, and D by the key of E minor&quot;.

==Responses and influences==

The chord and the figure surrounding it is well enough known to have been parodied and quoted by a number of later musicians. Debussy includes the chord in a setting of the phrase &quot;je suis triste&quot; in his opera &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;. Debussy also jokingly quotes the opening bars of Wagner&#x27;s opera several times in &quot;Golliwogg&#x27;s Cakewalk&quot; from his piano suite &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;. Benjamin Britten slyly invokes it at the moment in &quot;Albert Herring&quot; when Sid and Nancy spike Albert&#x27;s lemonade and then, when he drinks it, the chord &quot;runs riot through the orchestra and recurs irreverently to accompany his hiccups&quot;. Paul Lansky based the harmonic content of his first electronic piece, &quot;mild und leise&quot; (1973), on the Tristan chord. This piece is best known from being sampled in the Radiohead song &quot;Idioteque&quot;.

Bernard Herrmann incorporated the chord in his scores for &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958) and &quot;Tender is the Night&quot; (1962).

Christian Thielemann, the music director of the Bayreuth Festival from 2015–20, discussed the Tristan chord in his book, &quot;My Life with Wagner&quot;: the chord &quot;is the password, the cipher for all modern music. It is a chord that does not conform to any key, a chord on the verge of dissonance&quot;, and &quot;The Tristan chord does not seek to be resolved in the closest consonance, as the classic theory of harmony requires; [it] is sufficient unto itself, just as Tristan and Isolde are sufficient unto themselves and know only their love.&quot;

More recently, American composer and humorist Peter Schickele crafted a tango around the Tristan prelude, a chamber work for four bassoons entitled &quot;Last Tango in Bayreuth&quot;. The Brazilian conductor and composer Flavio Chamis wrote &quot;Tristan Blues&quot;, a composition based on the Tristan chord. The work, for harmonica and piano was recorded on the CD &quot;Especiaria&quot;, released in Brazil by the Biscoito Fino label. Additionally, New York-based composer Dalit Warshaw&#x27;s narrative concerto for piano and orchestra, &quot;Conjuring Tristan&quot;, employs the Tristan chord in exploring the themes of Thomas Mann&#x27;s novella &quot;Tristan&quot; through Wagner&#x27;s music.

The prelude of Wagner&#x27;s opera is prominently used in the film &quot;Melancholia&quot; by Lars von Trier.

<text>&quot;These Green Mountains&quot; is the official state song of Vermont. 

== History ==
In 1998, the Vermont Legislature resolved to have the Vermont Arts Council establish a committee to find and recommend a new state song to replace &quot;Hail to Vermont!&quot;. The committee subsequently solicited candidates and reviewed 107 songs, choosing eight songs as finalists. Following a solicitation of input from the Vermont public, &quot;These Green Mountains&quot; was put forth as their official recommendation. 

The song was composed by Diane Martin and arranged by Rita Buglass-Gluck and was made official on May 22, 2000, when then-governor Howard Dean signed Act 99. 

== Lyrics ==
: These green hills and silver waters
: are my home. They belong to me.
: And to all of her sons and daughters
: May they be strong and forever free.

: Let us live to protect her beauty
: And look with pride on the golden dome.
: They say home is where the heart is
: These green mountains are my home.

: These green mountains are my home.

<doc id="596229" wikidata="Q369555" url="?curid=596229" title="Flintlock mechanism">
<text>The flintlock mechanism is a type of lock used on muskets, rifles, and pistols from the early 17th to the mid-19th century. It is commonly referred to as a &quot;flintlock&quot; (without the word &quot;mechanism&quot;). The term is also used for the weapons themselves as a whole, and not just the lock mechanism.

The flintlock mechanism, also known as the true flintlock, was developed in France in the early 17th century. It quickly replaced earlier technologies, such as the matchlock and wheellock and the earlier flintlocks. It continued to be in common use for over two centuries, until it was finally replaced by the percussion lock.

==History==
Flintlock firing mechanisms made their appearance in the 16th century in the form of the snaplock, the snaphance, the miquelet, and the doglock. The so-called &quot;true flintlock&quot; was developed in France in the early 17th century. Though its exact origins are not known, credit for the development of the true flintlock is usually given to Marin le Bourgeoys, an artist, gunsmith, luthier, and inventor from Normandy, France. Marin le Bourgeoys&#x27;s basic design became the standard for flintlocks, quickly replacing most older firing mechanisms throughout Europe. Flintlock weapons based on this design were used for over two centuries, until gradually superseded by caplock mechanisms in the early 19th century.

The key element apparently added by Marin le Bourgeoys was the vertically acting sear. The sear is a &quot;catch&quot; or &quot;latch&quot; which holds the mechanism in a position ready to fire; the trigger acts upon, or is part of, the sear, releasing it and allowing a strong spring to act on the mechanism to fire the gun. Previously the sear, located within the lock, had acted through a hole in the lockplate to engage the cock on the outside of the plate. The vertically acting sear acted on a piece called the tumbler, on the inside of the lock which was mounted on the same rotating shaft as the cock. This design proved to be the most efficient in terms of cost and reliability.

==Construction and operation==

A typical flintlock mechanism has a piece of flint which is held in place in between a set of jaws on the end of a short hammer (sometimes called the &quot;cock&quot; due to its shape resembling a rooster&#x27;s beak). Before shooting, the hammer is pulled back into a spring-tensioned (or &quot;cocked&quot;) position. Pulling the trigger disengages the sear and releases the hammer, which swings forward causing the flint to strike a piece of steel called the &quot;frizzen&quot;. At the same time, the motion of the flint and hammer pushes the frizzen back, opening the cover to a concealed flash pan, which contains a small charge of gunpowder.

As the flint strikes the frizzen it creates sparks. The flint is harder than steel so it shaves off the frizzen a shower tiny steel fragments. These fragments exhibit pyrophoricity (the propensity to ignite spontaneously in air). Due to their minute size, they have an extremely large surface-area to volume ratio. A high proportion of the fragments&#x27; iron is in contact with air and it rapidly oxidises, making them extremely hot.

Some fragments will fall into the powder in the pan and will ignite it. Flame from this burning powder travels through a small touch hole into the gun barrel; the main propellant charge is ignited, causing the weapon to fire the projectile.

Most hammers follow Marin le Bourgeoys&#x27;s design, and have a &quot;half-cocked&quot; position, which is the &quot;safe&quot; position since pulling the trigger from this position does not cause the gun to fire. From this position, the frizzen can be opened, and powder can be placed in the pan. Then the frizzen is closed, and the hammer is pulled back into the &quot;full cocked&quot; position, from which it is fired.

The phrase &quot;don&#x27;t go off half cocked&quot; originated with these types of weapons, which were not supposed to fire from the half cocked position of the hammer.

===Internal flintlock===
Weapons using internal flintlock are relatively rare. This variant of the lock does not have an external cock. Its function is similar to striker-fired guns. Instead of the striker there is a rod holding the flint. The pan is located on the upper side of the barrel. The pan has a hinged cover with grooves on the underside. The gunsmith Stanislav Patzelta is considered to be the inventor of this system. According to other sources this lock could have been invented by the Austrian gunsmith Karl Bischof (Carl Pischoff).
==Flints==

A &quot;gun flint&quot; is a piece of flint that has been shaped, or knapped into a wedge-shape that fits in the jaws of a flintlock. The gun flints were wrapped in a small piece of lead or leather (known as a &quot;flint pad&quot;) to hold them firmly in place and were made in different sizes to suit different weapons. Pieces of the mineral agate could be used instead of flint, but this was difficult and expensive to shape and only used by countries such as Prussia that were without access to flint deposits.

The experience of modern flintlock shooters shows that a good quality flint can be used for hundreds of shots, although for reliable shooting it must be sharpened periodically. The use of a worn flint could also be continued if it was removed from the gun and replaced the other way up. Despite this, it was the British practice to include a new flint in each box of 20 rounds of ammunition for the Brown Bess musket. Contemporary American military manuals suggested a flint could last for around 50 shots, but the American military followed the British practice of supplying soldiers with one flint per 20 rounds. Archaeological investigation of American military sites shows soldiers discarded flints after very little use, suggesting they preferred new flints to ensure the reliability of their weapons. A skilled craftsman could make several thousand gun flints a day so they were individually quite cheap items.

In times of war, millions of gun flints were needed and in the United Kingdom, mining flint and then knapping it became a substantial cottage industry around Brandon, Suffolk, an area that previously saw large scale flint mining in the Neolithic area. In 1804, Brandon was supplying over 400,000 flints a month to the British military. However flint knappers suffered from silicosis, known as &quot;Knappers Rot&quot; due to the inhalation of flint dust. It has been claimed this was responsible for the early death of three-quarters of Brandon gun flint makers.

Brandon gun flints were well regarded as they had a lower rate of misfire than flints from other sources. The industry reached its height during and after the Napoleonic Wars, when Brandon flints were exported worldwide with a near global monopoly. It later declined rapidly as flintlocks were replaced by percussion locks. However, Brandon still supplied 11 million flints a year to the Turkish army during the Crimean War and was exporting flints to Africa as late as the 1960s.

In France, gun flint production between the 17th and 19th centuries centered around the small towns of Meusnes and Couffy. Meusnes has a small museum dedicated to the industry. A different colour, and a slightly different method of manufacture can allow archaeologists to distinguish between British-made and French-made flints. France was a globally dominant supplier of gun flints until about 1780. After which the British industry began to eclipse it.

In North America, imported French and British flints were mostly used. In 1776 the US Congress authorized domestic production of gun flints, but no industry was ever established. In the Eastern United States, Indigenous American people reportedly made their own gun flints by re-working stone spear heads. They also made flints from scratch using local chert, but they preferred imported European flints if they could get access to them.

Small scale suppliers of gun flints still exist in the 21st century, supplying historic gun enthusiasts who continue to shoot original and replica flintlock firearms.

==Gunlocks==
A &quot;gunlock&quot; was a flintlock mechanism that fired a cannon. They were a significant innovation in naval gunnery and were first used by the Royal Navy in 1745. Their use spread slowly as they could not be retrofitted to older guns – the French had still not generally adopted them by the time of the Battle of Trafalgar (1805).

The earlier method of firing a cannon was to apply a linstock – a wooden staff holding a length of smoldering match at the end – to the touch hole of the gun, which was filled with loose priming powder. This was dangerous and made accurate shooting from a moving ship impossible as the gun had to be fired while standing to the side to avoid its recoil, and there was a noticeable delay between the application of the linstock and the gun firing.

The gunlock was operated by pulling a cord, known as a lanyard. The gun-captain could stand behind the gun, safely beyond its range of recoil, and sight along the gun, firing when the roll of the ship lined the gun up with the enemy and so avoid the chance of the shot hitting the sea or flying high over the enemy&#x27;s deck. Loading the gun was faster and safer as the gunlock didn&#x27;t use loose priming powder; the main charge was ignited by a quill filled with priming powder that was pushed through the touch hole during loading and pierced the cartridge bag, containing the main charge of gunpowder.

After the introduction of gunlocks, linstocks were retained, but only as a backup means of firing.

==Other uses==
Some early land mines, or &quot;fougasses&quot;, were detonated by flintlocks. Flintlocks were also used to launch Congreve rockets.

A flintlock tinder lighter, or tinder pistol, was a device that saw use in wealthy households from the 18th Century until the invention of reliable matches. It somewhat resembled a small flintlock pistol, but without a barrel and with a candle holder and with legs so it could be stood upright. When the trigger was pulled, the sparks from the frizzen lit dry tinder in the pan, from which the candle would be quickly lit. The device provided a quick and reliable source of light, and flame for the lighting of fires.

Alarm clocks exist that, as well as sounding a bell, used a flintlock mechanism to light a candle. German and Austrian-made examples of these, dating from the 18th century, are preserved in the collections of the British Museum and the Hermitage Museum in Russia. An example dating from 1550 is in the 
&quot;Germanisches Nationalmuseum&quot; (National Museum of Germanic Culture) in Nuremberg.

<text>The &#x27;, also known as &#x27; and , is a white brimless felt traditionally worn by Albanians. It has spread throughout Albanian-inhabited territories, and is today part of the traditional costume of the Albanians. The height and shape of the cap varies region to region.

==Etymology==

In Albanian: or , or , or .

The word &quot;qeleshe&quot; comes from the Albanian word for wool (&quot;lesh&quot;). According to Vladimir Orel, the word &quot;plis&quot; comes from Proto-Albanian , related to Old High German id., Latin id. and Greek πῖλος id., Proto-Slavic &quot;*pьlstь&quot; id.; according to Michael Driesen, Orel&#x27;s reconstruction of Proto-Albanian is incorrect.

==Process==
There are many ways to make the &quot;qeleshe&quot; but it is always hand made. The most common way, in Kosovo, is using soap on the wool. In the bazaar of Krujë, it is constructed by first getting a small chunk of wool that is placed on a table. Then, an instrument similar to a bow is used to beat the wool by hammering the string with a stone or a sturdy piece of wood. The wool is beaten and pressed until the wool strands become knotted around each other. Finally, it is washed, and shrinks.

It is then pressed by a flat wooden instrument on top of it, multiple times, until the wool becomes completely flat and smooth. Then, it is sealed in a flattener for 24 hours and soaked in hot water and salt. The hat is made by two finished, flattened and pressed wool. The corners are removed to form a round shape. Afterwards, soap is added as a glue substitution to finely keep the fibres smooth while both pieces of wool are rubbed together. Then it is washed and beaten to strengthen the fabric, and placed on a wooden model.
The shape of the &quot;qeleshe&quot; is determined by the wooden model on which it is left to dry, and then rubbed with soap again to fix the shape. The wool will be smoothened with a razor. Lastly, a wooden instrument is firmly rubbed on the &quot;qeleshe&quot;.

==History==

The Albanian &quot;qeleshe&quot; has been handed down from Illyrian times.

The Illyrian hemispherical cap dates from the Iron Age, found both in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s graves, hence it can be assumed that it was worn both by men and women. A monument from Illyrian times that was found in Zenica shows a calotte-shaped cap, very similar to the &quot;qeleshe&quot;. The Albanian/Illyrian cap has been classified in a broader and general Mediterranean framework, relying on illustrations on situlae and girdle plates from the later Iron Age in Northern Italy and the Southern Alps. They also feature figures with hemispherical headgear with a small spike. The wearers of such caps are depicted carrying agricultural tools which leads to consider them as country people. Furthermore, in monuments from the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD from Bosnia, Illyrians under Roman rule are depicted with similar cap shapes. Such caps are absent in the eastern half of the Balkans, in the Pannonian-Carpathian region and in eastern Europe.

The 1542 Latin dictionary equated an Albanian hat with a kyrbasia, and described it as a &quot;tall pileus [hat] in the shape of a cone&quot; (). An early depiction of the hemispherical &quot;qeleshe&quot; can be seen on Johann Theodor de Bry depiction of Moisi Golemi from 1596, however, earlier Italian and documents exist depicting Albanians wearing the &quot;qeleshe&quot; from earlier centuries. It is also argued by Nopcsa that it may have been coloured red. During the 17-19 centuries, the appearances description and appearances steadily multiplied, depicting it as a common Albanian headdress as it became more widespread and easily accessible to wear. The white version became the most popular one and was finally declared a specific Albanian national costume during the Albanian Renaissance.

In the 18-19 century, the &quot;qeleshe&quot; became popularly depicted in painting depicting Arnaut, painters like Jean-Léon Gérôme, Charles Bargue and Marie-Gabriel-Florent-Auguste de Choiseul-Gouffier would paint Albanian subjects of the Osman Empire with the &quot;qeleshe&quot;, as a diverse presentation of the orient. It would be casually depicted in a formal setting, such as in &quot;The Albanian Marriage&quot; by Jean Pierre Louis Laurent Hoüel in 1785, where the priest is depicted with a &quot;qeleshe&quot;.

During the 19-20 century, Albanologists started taking photographs of Albanian national attires, many of which would include the &quot;qeleshe&quot;. Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás is photographed multiple times wearing the headdress. It then became a popular headdress for Albanian soldiers to wear during the battle for independence, Shota Galica, Isa Boletini and Azem Galica are depicted wearing the &quot;qeleshe&quot; while fighting Italian, Turkish, Greek, Serbian and Montenegrin troops during the Partition of Albania. The &quot;qeleshe&quot; formed part of the official uniform of the Waffen-SS Skanderbeg division and Albanian Legion.

==Overview==
The cap is part of the traditional costume of the Albanian highlanders and is considered as a national symbol among a large number of Albanian communities. During the Ottoman period, the hat as a white colored fez cap was the characteristic Albanian national headgear, in particular of Muslim Albanians.
In the northern Albanian highlands, the shape is hemispherical, while in Kukës, it is truncated. In southern Albania, the cap is taller than in northern Albania, especially in the Gjirokastër and Vlorë regions, with the exception of the Myzeqe low plains region. In some areas of southern Albania the cap has a small protrusion. The cap is made from one single piece of woolen felt, usually white, that is molded to the shape of the head.

The cap is used by men during the traditional weddings of the Tirana region.

<doc id="596238" wikidata="Q242746" url="?curid=596238" title="Sigrid the Haughty">
<text>Sigrid the Haughty (, ) is a Scandinavian queen appearing in Norse sagas. Sigrid is named in several late and sometimes contradictory Icelandic sagas composed generations after the events the stories describe, but there is no reliable, historical evidence attesting to the veracity of her depiction in those tales. She is reported by &quot;Heimskringla&quot; to have been the wife of Eric the Victorious of Sweden, as being sought after by Olaf Tryggvasson, and then married to Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark. In other writings, however, author Snorri Sturluson says that Sweyn the Dane was married not to Sigrid but some other woman.

It is unclear if the figure of Sigrid was a real person. Some recent scholars identify her with a documented Polish wife of Eric and perhaps Sweyn mentioned by medieval chroniclers and referred to as &#x27;Świętosława&#x27; by some modern historians, but the potential husbands attributed to Sigrid lived over a wide date range and other modern scholars believe Sigrid may be an amalgamation of several historical women.

== Early accounts ==
Sigrid appears in the 12th-century saga, &quot;Yngvars saga víðförla&quot;, which when speaking of Swedish King Eric the Victorious says:

She also receives brief mention in the genealogical appendix to , which likewise when discussing Eric states &quot;He married Sigrith the Ambitious&quot; (&quot;). This appendix is not found in the earliest surviving manuscripts of the saga, rendering its dating uncertain.

== Accounts given in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and &quot;Separate Saga&quot; ==
Using earlier sagas as his sources, Snorri Sturluson gives a much more detailed account of Sigrid in several sagas within his 13th-century compilation, the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. He first introduces her in &quot;Haralds saga gráfeldar&quot;, where he describes the upbringing of the Norwegian prince Harald Grenske, who fled to Sweden and there joined the raiding band of Skoglar Toste, described as the richest and most distinguished untitled man in the country, and staying with him the following winter. The saga then relates that Toste had a daughter Sigríd, who was young, fair and very haughty, and who later would marry Swedish king Eric the Victorious and become mother of King Olaf the Swede. Snorri returns to Harald and Sigrid in the next saga in the &quot;Hemskringla&quot;, &quot;Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar&quot;. Now a wealthy queen dowager and mother of King Olaf, and described by Snorri as &quot;the wisest of women and prophetic about many things&quot;, she learns that her foster-brother Harald is nearby on his way to raid in the Baltic Sea, and she invites him to a banquet, and afterwards personally serves him in his chamber. However, Harald took offence the next day when she favorably compared her own possessions and power in Sweden to his in Norway, leaving Harald sullen in spite of the great gifts she gave him. After stewing over this for a season, Harald again raided the Baltic and visited Sweden on his return. Sending for Sigrid, he proposed that they marry. She dismissed this, pointing out that he already had a wife, Asta, who seemed compatible with him, but he insisted Asta, though noble and good, was not as high-born as he. After a few further cursory words, Sigrid rode away, and Harald again turned sullen before deciding to ride to her home to press his case. Taking a large body of men, he arrived to find another suitor also present, a king called Vissavaldr from Garðaríki. Both were housed in the same quarters, and served large quantities of drink, and then in the night she had her people set fire to the structure and kill anyone who made it out, declaring that this should prevent other petty kings from coming to her country to seek her hand. Snorri says that from thenceforth she was called &quot; Sigríðr in stórráða&quot;, &quot;Sigrid of the Great Undertakings&quot;.

Later in the same saga, Snorri related Sigrid&#x27;s wooing by Olaf Tryggvasson, the king of Norway. After exchanging messages, Olaf proposed they marry, and Sigrid agreed. In commemoration of this Olaf sent her a great gold ring he had taken as a prize, but Sigrid&#x27;s goldsmiths discovered it to be only gold-plated brass, and this made Sigrid question his truthfulness. Then, when Olaf and Sigrid met in person, he insisted that in order to marry she must convert to Christianity, to which she responded, &quot;I shall not abandon the faith that I have previously held, as have my kinsmen before me. I shall also make no objection to your believing in whatever god you like.&quot; In a rage, Olaf struck her with a glove, and Sigrid calmly told him, &quot;That could well cost you your life&quot;, and they parted. After relating several of Olaf&#x27;s subsequent activities, he returns to Sigrid, indicating that after the death of Gunhild, daughter of Burislav of the Wends and wife of Sweyn Forkbeard, King of Denmark, the Danish king had married Sigrid, daughter of Skoglar Toste, and through this relationship an alliance was formed between Sweyn and her son Olaf of Sweden, along with Sweyn&#x27;s son-in-law, Jarl Eiríkr Hákonarson. Olaf had further offended the Danish king through the actions of Sweyn&#x27;s sister, Tyri. Sent against her will to marry Burislav in fulfillment of a provision of the same treaty that had seen Sweyn marry his first wife, Burislav&#x27;s daughter Gunhild, Tyri fled to Norway after the wedding, and there married Olaf. The two queens then goaded their husbands into conflict. This shared animosity would lead to the Battle of Swold, in which Olaf fell.

Sigrid does not appear in the next saga in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, &quot;Óláfs saga ins helga&quot;, but she is mentioned in a related text by Snorri, a stand-alone account of the same monarch now commonly called the &quot;Separate Saga of St. Olaf&quot;. This mentions her while giving very similar accounts of Harald Grenske to those found in &quot;Haralds saga gráfeldar&quot; and &quot;Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar&quot;, with the only novel information being another passage relating a marriage between Olaf Tryggvason&#x27;s sister Ingibjorg, and Sigrid&#x27;s nephew Jarl Rognvald, son of her brother Ulf. Sigrid makes one further brief appearance in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, in &quot;Magnúss saga ins góða&quot;. There she is described as mother of Estrid Svendsdatter, the paternal (half-)sister of Cnut the Great and maternal half-sister of Swedish king Olaf.

== Other appearances ==
The Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus has similar information as the &quot;Heimkringla&quot;, writing that Eric the Victorious&#x27; widow Syritha had married Sweyn Forkbeard after having spurned Olaf Trygvasson.

One further point that has been cited in favor of Sigrid&#x27;s historical existence is that the holdings of the Danish kings in medieval Sweden were known as &quot;Syghridslef&quot; - &#x27;the legacy of Sigrid&#x27;.

== Contemporary chroniclers ==
There is scant material in medieval chronicles to provide details regarding the marriages of Sweyn of Denmark and Erik of Sweden:
* Thietmar of Merseburg mentions that the daughter of Mieszko I of Poland and sister of Bolesław I Chrobry of Poland married Sweyn Forkbeard and gave him two sons, Cnut the Great and Harald II of Denmark, but he does not mention her name. Thietmar is probably the best informed of the medieval chroniclers addressing the question, since he was contemporary with the events described and well-informed about the events in Poland and Denmark. The assertion that Harald&#x27;s and Canute&#x27;s mother was Boleslaw&#x27;s sister may explain some mysterious statements which appear in medieval chronicles, such as the involvement of Polish troops in invasions of England.
* Adam of Bremen writes almost a century later that a Polish princess—the sister or daughter of Bolesław I Chrobry of Poland—was the wife of Eric the Victorious and by this marriage the mother of Olof Skötkonung of Sweden, before she became mother of Cnut the Great and Harald II of Denmark in her second marriage with Sweyn. Adam&#x27;s claims about the marriage to Eric are considered unreliable by many historians, since he is the only source to state this relationship and because he is writing several generations later. The scholia of Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum mentions that it was the Polish king Boleslaw who gave the princess&#x27; hand in marriage. One problem is that Olof was born at latest in the early 980s, before Boleslaw Chrobry came to power, and therefore was too old to be the unnamed princess&#x27;s son.

During this time, marriages between Nordic monarchs and Vendic nobles was reoccurring for political reasons. For instance, Tove of the Obotrites, daughter of the Vendic lord Mistivoj, married King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark in the 960s.

* &quot;Gesta Cnutonis regis&quot; mentions in one short passage that Canute and his brother went to the land of the Slavs, and brought back their mother, who was living there. This does not necessarily mean that his mother was Slavic, but nevertheless this chronicle strongly suggests that she was.

== Modern reconstructions ==
There are many alternative reconstructions. Some interpret the saga accounts of Sigrid as a confused rendering of a woman appearing in the historical record. Chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg reported that a daughter of first duke of the Polans Mieszko I, unnamed in the original source but hypothesized to have been named &#x27;Świętosława&#x27; by some modern historians, married Sweyn, and by him was mother of Harald and Cnut, while writing slightly later Adam of Bremen reported that this same Polish princess had earlier married Eric, having Olaf by him. &quot;Sigrid&quot; could be either a contemporary name adopted by the Princess to conform to her new linguistic context, or else simply a name invented by saga writers who did not know or could not comprehend her Slavic name. This solution may further make her identical to the woman that the same saga gives as Sweyn&#x27;s first queen, &#x27;Gunhild&#x27;, daughter of &#x27;Burislav&#x27;, suggested to be a confused rendering of the same historical marriage to the sister of Boleslav of Poland. This is not certain: the attributed Polish marriages of Sweyn and Eric may have been to different women, with Gunhild being the daughter of Mieszko, while Eric&#x27;s widow, a distinct princess, may simply have been the dramatic model for Sigrid.

Finally, some consider Sigrid to be a fictional character created by Scandinavian saga writers.

== Suggested resting places ==

Further confusion has been introduced by outdated interpretations of an archaeological discovery. In 1835, the Haraldskær Woman was discovered in a peat bog in Jutland. When originally found in the nineteenth-century, this female body was dated to the 11th century, and it was identified as Sigrid (or Gunhild). Radiocarbon dating later proved this was incorrect, however, showing the remains are much older and probably not those of Sigrid. Despite this, the erroneous dating became intertwined with numerous episodes of Scandinavian intrigue, as the theory was elaborated to serve a variety of agendas of kings and nobles prior to its redating.

Other legend states that Sigrid is buried at the Puke Stone (Swedish: &quot;Pjukesten&quot;) along the hiking trail. Near the half-way point of the twelfth stage of that trail lies an ancient monumental stone just off the path in the forest. It is said to be the burial place of Queen Sigrid, erected by her son.

== In literature ==
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow composed a poem with the title &quot;Queen Sigrid the Haughty&quot; of which this is the first verse:

: Queen Sigrid the Haughty sat proud and aloft
: In her chamber, that looked over meadow and croft.
: Heart&#x27;s dearest,
: Why dost thou sorrow so?

Karen Blixen, in the short story &quot;The Deluge at Norderney&quot; in &quot;Seven Gothic Tales&quot;, refers to Sigrid, claiming that she invited all her suitors to her house and burned them in order to discourage other suitors.

The story of Sigrid&#x27;s life, loosely based on the Saga materials, is the focus of two novels by the Swedish writer and journalist, Johanne Hildebrandt: &quot;Sigrid&quot; (2014) and its sequel &quot;Estrid&quot; (2016).

There are three novels about the life and times of Sigrid the Haughty (treating her as identical to Świętosława): 
*Elżbieta Cherezińska  &quot;Harda&quot; (2016) (&quot;The Haughty&quot;) and &quot;Królowa&quot; (2016) (&quot;The Queen&quot;), 
*Maria Rawska-Mrożkiewicz &quot;Świętosława: Córka Mieszka I, żona, matka skandynawskich Konungów&quot; (1987) (&quot;Świętosława: Daughter of Mieszko I, Wife, Mother of Scandinavian Kings&quot;)

<text>Kenneth Graham Sansom (born 26 September 1958) is a former professional footballer who played as a left-back. An England international, he played for clubs such as Crystal Palace, Arsenal, Newcastle United, Coventry City, Queens Park Rangers, Everton and Watford.

He is the second most capped England national team full-back, having appeared 86 times for his country between 1979 and 1988.

==Club career==
Kenneth Graham Sansom was born in Camberwell, London on 26 September 1958; the second youngest of five children. His father, George, was an itinerant who left the family home shortly after the birth of his youngest child. His mother, Rose, was a cleaner, and moved the family to Tulse Hill in 1960. He considered himself a goalkeeper in his early years, but while playing for a youth team called Spring Park Wolves he replaced an injured teammate at left-back, and remained a full-back for the rest of his career. He attended Beaufoy Secondary school, and was capped by England schoolboys.

===Crystal Palace===
Sansom was scouted by Arsenal, Queens Park Rangers and Tottenham Hotspur, but went on to join the youth team at Crystal Palace. He made his League debut against Tranmere Rovers on 7 May 1975.

In 1977, he captained the Palace junior team to FA Youth Cup success while also skippering the England youth team at the same level, collecting Palace&#x27;s &quot;Player of the Year&quot; award in his first season.

Quick, calm, strong in the tackle and an excellent crosser of the ball, Sansom missed just one league game in a consecutive run of 156 games, starting in 1976, when Palace were in the Third Division. In the 1978–79 season Crystal Palace won the Second Division championship with Sansom integral to the young team. They were quickly labelled as the &quot;Team of The &#x27;80s&quot;. and briefly topped the First Division at the start of the 1979–80 season although they ultimately finished in thirteenth position.

===Arsenal===
Arsenal put in a bid of £1 million for Sansom in the summer of 1980, with striker Clive Allen going in exchange; this was an unusual move, as Allen was an equally prized young player and had only joined Arsenal from QPR a few weeks earlier, and was still to play a competitive match for the Gunners. Palace accepted the bid and Sansom left for Highbury.
Sansom made his Arsenal debut against West Bromwich Albion on 16 August 1980 and was an ever-present for the whole of that season and also the next, and a near-constant figure at left-back for the North London club. He was bestowed with the honour of Arsenal Player of the Season in 1981. Although a third-place finish did ensure European football was back on the agenda, no real title challenge was forthcoming. The next two seasons saw a top-five finish in 1982, and a disappointing tenth in 1983 when matters were not improved by semi-final failure in both domestic cups at the hands of Manchester United. Terry Neill was sacked in December 1983 and Don Howe took over. Arsenal finished sixth and seventh under Howe and although often tipped to challenge, usually flattered to deceive. Sansom though was remarkably consistent and ever present. In fact, after six seasons Sansom missed just seven games in all competitions. He was one of the few players who could really hold up his head in a time of under-achievement. Meanwhile, silverware eluded both Sansom and Arsenal. In May 1986, Millwall manager George Graham, a former Arsenal player, was appointed as Howe&#x27;s long-term replacement, and it was the beginning of a new era of success at Highbury. Arsenal&#x27;s form immediately improved, so much so that the club were top of the League at Christmas 1986.

Sansom finally won domestic silverware in 1987, captaining Arsenal to a League Cup final victory over Liverpool at Wembley; Arsenal came from a goal down to win 2–1, with Sansom starting the move which had led to Arsenal&#x27;s late winner, scored by Charlie Nicholas.

The following season, Sansom&#x27;s relationship with his Arsenal manager Graham soured and he was replaced as captain by fledgling defender Tony Adams, who was just 21. Sansom did, however, keep his place in the side; although Graham had just signed a long-term replacement in Nigel Winterburn. Winterburn was played at right-back rather than on the left for his first season at the club. Arsenal reached the League Cup final again in 1987–88, only to lose 3–2 to Luton Town in a dramatic and exciting match. Everton away at Goodison Park on 7 May 1988 was the last time Sansom pulled on the red and white shirt.

Sansom left Arsenal in December 1988, having not played a first team game at all for the first four months of 1988–89; Graham had signed Lee Dixon and had reshuffled the side, with Dixon playing at right-back and Winterburn on the left, replacing Sansom. Sansom had played 394 matches in total for Arsenal, scoring six goals.

===Later career===
Arsenal sold Sansom to Newcastle United for £300,000 in December 1988. The 1988-89 season was a season of contrasting fortunes between the two clubs as Arsenal won the League Championship and his new club finished bottom of the First Division. Sansom transferred to QPR in the summer of 1989 for £300,000 and scored against Arsenal in a 2–0 FA Cup fourth round replay victory at Loftus Road. After making 64 league appearances for QPR, he moved on to Coventry City for £100,000 in March 1991 and made 51 league appearances for &#x27;The Sky Blues&#x27;. Sansom then had short spells at Everton (seven league appearances and one goal against Tottenham Hotspur), who he joined on a free transfer in February 1993, and First Division Brentford (eight appearances), who he joined on a free transfer a month later, March 1993, but he could not prevent &#x27;The Bees&#x27; from being relegated. After playing non-league football with Chertsey Town, Sansom returned to league football again by joining Glenn Roeder and First Division Watford, as player and first team coach. Sansom made one league appearance for Watford, before he retired from top class football, though he did play on for non-league clubs such as Croydon F.C. and Slough Town. Since retiring from the game, he has often appeared on Sky Sports as a football analyst.

==International career==
On 23 May 1979, Sansom made his debut for the full England team, in a goalless draw against Wales. The following year he starred for England in Euro 1980 which was held in Italy, though England did not progress beyond the group stage. Sansom was a regular starter playing in the 1982 World Cup in Spain, in which England exited in the second group phase. He was still the first-choice left-back for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, playing in all of the matches up to and including the quarter-final defeat against Argentina, in which he was one of the England players left trailing behind by Diego Maradona as the Argentinian burst from inside his own half to score a solo goal and his second of the match.

Sansom missed only a handful of England matches between 1980 and 1988; his record of 37 consecutive appearances between May 1984 and April 1987, has only been bettered by Billy Wright and Ron Flowers. He was occasionally rested in friendly matches so that coaches Ron Greenwood and then Bobby Robson could check on potential replacements Derek Statham, Alan Kennedy, Nick Pickering and Stuart Pearce in the event of losing Sansom either through serious injury or chronic loss of form. However, Sansom remained the regular left-back during England&#x27;s UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying campaign.

That summer, Sansom was Robson&#x27;s first-choice left-back for the European Championships, but England lost all three of their group games, starting with a surprise 1–0 defeat to the Republic of Ireland in their first ever finals match, having qualified under the management of Englishman and World Cup winner Jack Charlton.

Sansom made an error for the only goal of the game, toeing an attempted clearance high into the air and putting pressure on his fellow defenders, from which John Aldridge won a header for Ray Houghton to nod the ball past Peter Shilton. Sansom played in the other two group fixtures but after the tournament Stuart Pearce replaced him as England&#x27;s first-choice left-back. After nine consecutive years, Sansom&#x27;s international career was coming to a close, months before his 30th birthday. He was briefly recalled to the side in 1989 as a back-up when Pearce was injured, though he did not play. In all Sansom gained 86 caps with one goal which was scored in a 1984 World Cup qualifier against Finland.

Sansom is England&#x27;s second-most capped full-back and only eleven players have appeared more times for England than Sansom. Among these are David Beckham, Bobby Moore, Steven Gerrard, Bobby Charlton, Bryan Robson, Frank Lampard, Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney and Peter Shilton. Jointly with Shilton, Sansom also holds the record for the most England caps in the 1980s, with 84 in all.

==Personal life==
After retiring from playing, Sansom has battled with gambling addiction and alcoholism and was homeless.

Sansom returned to football as a player on the veterans&#x27; circuit. He was frequently called upon as a pundit to make comments on the game, especially with matters concerning Crystal Palace or Arsenal. He also made occasional appearances on Australian football show Fox Sports FC via satellite. He was also a tour guide on the &quot;Legend&#x27;s Tour&quot; of Arsenal&#x27;s Emirates Stadium.

He was a co-presenter of LBC Radio&#x27;s Saturday afternoon football programme. Sansom was voted into Palace&#x27;s Centenary XI.

On 7 February 2014, Sansom appeared at court in Bromley, charged with assault following an alleged incident at his former partner&#x27;s property. He was cleared of all charges.

In 2016, Sansom was a guest on &quot;Thursday Focus&quot; on Manchester United&#x27;s in-house TV channel, MUTV, discussing his career and his life after football.

In May 2020 he was reportedly in hospital with an undisclosed illness. It was revealed six months later that he was diagnosed with Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, a type of dementia.

Sansom&#x27;s father George and uncle Terry were investigated but not charged as suspects in the Great Train Robbery. Sansom stated that he thought that they were innocent, but that his uncle Freddie, a well-known armed robber, was likely a member of the gang that committed the crime.

<text>Fallow is a farming technique in which arable land is left without sowing for one or more vegetative cycles. The goal of fallowing is to allow the land to recover and store organic matter while retaining moisture and disrupting pest life cycles and soil borne pathogens by temporarily removing their hosts. Crop rotation systems typically called for some of a farmer&#x27;s fields to be left fallow each year.

The increase in intensive farming, including the use of cover crops in lieu of fallow practices, has caused a loss of acreage of fallow land, as well as field margins, hedges, and wasteland. This has reduced biodiversity; fallows have been the primary habitat for farmland bird populations.

==Fallow syndrome==

Fallow syndrome is when a crop has insufficient nutrient uptake due to the lack of arbuscular mycorhizae (AM fungi) in the soil following a fallow period. Crops such as corn that are prone to fallow syndrome should not follow a period of fallow, but instead should follow a cover crop which is a host for AM fungi, such as oats or other small grain crops. The presence of &quot;any&quot; plant roots, including weeds, can reduce occurrence of fallow syndrome. Nowadays, agricultural fields are routinely planted with cover crops to prevent erosion, keep down weeds, provide a green manure, and reduce the risk of fallow syndrome.

<doc id="596249" wikidata="Q4856415" url="?curid=596249" title="Banknotes of the Philippine peso">
<text>Banknotes of the Philippine peso are issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (formerly the Central Bank of the Philippines) for circulation in the Philippines. The smallest amount of legal tender in wide circulation is ₱20 and the largest is ₱1000. The front side of each banknote features prominent people along with buildings, and events in the country&#x27;s history while the reverse side depicts landmarks and animals.

The dimensions of banknotes issued since the US-Philippine administration, 16 x 6.6 cm, has remained the same on all subsequent Philippine peso banknotes (except pre-1958 centavo notes), and was introduced during William Howard Taft&#x27;s tenure as governor-general of the Philippines. In view of its highly successful run, President Taft then appointed a committee that reported favorably on the advantages and savings from changing the size of United States banknotes to Philippine-size.
Since 1928 the sizes of the United States Federal Reserve Notes and Philippine banknotes have therefore been nearly identical.

==History==

===Timeline of the Philippine banknote series===
On May 1, 1852, the first commercial bank of the Philippines, El Banco Español Filipino de Isabel II issued the following denominations initially 10, 25, 50 and 200 pesos fuertes (strong pesos). They were used until 1896.
===First Philippine Republic===
The revolutionary republic of Emilio Aguinaldo ordered the issuance of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100-peso banknotes which were signed by Messrs. Pedro A. Paterno, Telesforo Chuidan and Mariano Limjap to avoid counterfeiting. However, only the 1 and 5-peso banknotes have been printed and circulated to some areas by the end of the short-lived First Republic.

===American Period===
By 1903, the American colonial Insular Government had issued Silver Certificates in denominations of 2, 5 and 10 pesos, backed by silver pesos or U.S. #eedba3 dollars at a fixed rate of ₱2/$1. The authorization of the issuance of Philippine Silver Certificates were placed on the notes, &quot;By Authority of an Act of the Congress of the United States of America, approved March 2, 1903.&quot; The first shipment of the currency were sent to the Philippines on September 1, 1903, and issued on October of the same year.

In 1905, higher denominations of 20, 50, 100 and 500 pesos were printed. However, amendments were made before the shipment of the notes from the United States to the Philippines to allow #eedba3 to be included as a reserve for the Silver Certificates. As the Series of 1905 was printed, but not yet shipped, they were sent to the United States Government Printing Office, and overprinted vertically with, &quot;Subject to the provisions of the Act of Congress, approved June 23, 1906.&quot;

In 1908, the El Banco Español Filipino was allowed to print banknotes in the following denominations with text in Spanish: Cinco (5), Diez (10), Veinte (20), Cincuenta (50), Cien (100) and Dos Cientos (200) Pesos. In 1912, the bank was renamed Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) and henceforth issued the same banknotes in English.

In 1918, the Silver Certificates were replaced by the Treasury Certificates issued with government-backing of bonds issued by the United States Government in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 Pesos. In 1916, the Philippine National Bank (PNB) was created to administer the state-holding shares and print banknotes without any quota from the Philippine Assembly. They printed banknotes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pesos. During World War I, the PNB issued emergency notes printed on cardboard paper in the following denominations: 10, 20, 50 centavos and 1 peso. Also overprinted BPI Notes in Five, Ten and Twenty Pesos due to the lack of currency.

The Commonwealth of the Philippines issued Treasury Certificates with the seal of the new government but still circulated the BPI and PNB banknotes.

===Summary of the Philippine banknote series===

===&quot;VICTORY-CBP&quot; banknotes===
The banknotes first issued by today&#x27;s Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (formerly the &quot;Central Bank of the Philippines&quot;) were the VICTORY-CBP Overprints in 1949, which were merely overprints of older American-era banknotes. The first official banknote series to be printed were the English Series in 1951.
===English Series (1949–1971)===
The English Series were Philippine banknotes that circulated from 1949 to 1969. It was the only banknote series of the Philippine peso to use English.

===Pilipino Series (1969–1974)===
The Pilipino Series banknotes is the name used to refer to Philippine banknotes issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines from 1969 to 1977, during the term of President Ferdinand Marcos Sr.. This series represented a radical change from the English series by undergoing Filipinization and a design change. It was succeeded by the Ang Bagong Lipunan Series of banknotes, to which it shared a similar design. The lowest denomination of the series is 1-piso and the highest is 100-piso.

===&quot;Ang Bagong Lipunan&quot; Series (1973–1996)===
The Ang Bagong Lipunan Series (literally, ”The New Society Series&quot;) is the name used to refer to Philippine banknotes issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines from 1973 to 1985. It was succeeded by the New Design Series of banknotes. The lowest denomination of the series is 2-piso and the highest is 100-piso.

After the declaration of Proclamation № 1081 by President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. on September 23, 1972, the Central Bank was to demonetize the English Series banknotes in 1974, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 168, later amended by Presidential Decree 378. All the unissued Pilipino Series banknotes (except the one peso banknote) were sent back to the De La Rue plant in London for overprinting the watermark area with the words &quot;ANG BAGONG LIPUNAN&quot; and oval geometric safety design. The one peso bill was replaced with the two peso bill, which features the same elements of the demonetized Pilipino series one peso bill.

On September 7, 1978, the Security Printing Plant in Quezon City was inaugurated to produce the banknotes.

The banknotes were still legal tender even after the introduction of the New Design Series banknotes, however it is seldom used after the EDSA Revolution. The banknotes were eventually demonetized on February 2, 1993 (but can still be exchange with legal tender currency to the Central Bank until February 1, 1996) after clamors that the banknotes can be used to buy votes for the 1992 Presidential Elections.

===New Design/BSP Series (1985–2019)===

By 1983, the committee was deciding on the issuance of new banknotes to replace the &quot;Ang Bagong Lipunan Series&quot; by issuing seven new banknotes consisting in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000-pesos.

On June 12, 1985, the Central Bank issued the &quot;New Design Series&quot; starting with a new 5-peso banknote with the face of Emilio Aguinaldo. A new 10-peso banknote with the face of Apolinario Mabini was then introduced in July 1985 a month after the 5-peso banknote was issued. On March 3, 1986, a new 20-peso banknote appeared. After the 1986 People Power Revolution and the new 1987 Constitution was promulgated, the Central Bank issued a new 50, 100- and for the second time a new 500-peso banknote with the face of Benigno Aquino Jr. In 1991, the Central Bank issued for the first time a new 1000-peso banknote, containing the portraits of José Abad Santos, Josefa Llanes Escoda and Vicente Lim.

After the passage of the New Central Bank Act of 1993 when the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) was reestablished as the central monetary authority, this series was renamed the &quot;BSP Series&quot; and featured the new seal of the BSP.

On May 2, 1997, the year of issue or printing was introduced on banknotes starting with the release of 10-peso note with Andres Bonifacio and Blood Compact of the Katipuneros. This feature was later adapted on other banknotes of the series which are 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 peso notes in 1998. The only banknote of the series that does not use the printing or issue year is the 5-peso note as it stopped being printed in 1995 two years before the printing year was introduced or added on banknotes.

In 1998, the 100,000-peso Centennial banknote, measuring 8.5&quot;x14&quot;, accredited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&#x27;s largest legal tender note. It was issued in very limited quantity during the celebration of the Centennial of Philippine Independence. In the same year, the practice in banknotes since the Commonwealth era of reproducing the signature of the President of the Philippines over the legend &quot;President of the Philippines&quot; was abandoned in favor of explicitly stating the president&#x27;s name. Also the names of the Philippine president and BSP governor are capitalized, while their titles are now in lowercase.

In 2001, the BSP upgraded the security features (visible fibers, value panel, security thread and watermark) of 1000, 500, and 100-peso banknotes with additional security features like a second glossy security thread, iridescent strip, fluorescent printing, optically variable ink, and microprints. In 2002, the Bangko Sentral issued a new 200-peso banknote with the same aforementioned security features and with the face of former President Diosdado Macapagal. His daughter, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, is at the back of the 200-peso banknote which showed her being sworn into office at the EDSA Shrine. She is the first president whose image has been included in a banknote while in office since emergency currency was issued by various provincial currency boards during World War II.

On July 8, 2009, the BSP announced that it would recall all bank notes made of abaca and cotton soon and replace it with an all-polymer series. This plan has been abandoned, however, when the &quot;New Generation Currency&quot; series was released to the public on December 16, 2010, with all banknotes still made of abaca and cotton.

The series had the liability of the BSP alongside the &quot;New Generation Currency&quot; series until the demonetization of the 2,000 and 100,000-piso commemorative banknotes on August 2, 2019, when the &quot;New Generation Currency&quot; series became a single circulating set, making &quot;New Design Series&quot; having the longest banknote series to have a liability of the BSP for 34 years with main banknotes demonetized on January 3, 2018, and the said commemorative banknotes and series overall in August 2019.

===New Generation Currency Series (current; 2010–present)===

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) began the 12-year demonetization process of the New Design Series when the New Generation Currency (NGC) project was started in 2007 through formal conceptualization process which was a result of the meeting of the minds of people with diverse backgrounds and ideas: central bankers, artists, technocrats, historians, communication experts, and currency printers to further enhance security features and to improve durability. It is where the thematic content, designs, and security features underwent thorough deliberations and evaluation, and was undertaken by the BSP&#x27;s Numismatic Committee (Num Com) in consultation with the Monetary Board (MB) and, subsequently, with the approval of the BSP Governor and the President of the Philippines. The BSP released the new design of the banknotes on December 16, 2010, to the public, along with an initial batch, three years after the project was started. The series was approved by Presidents Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and her immediate successor Benigno Aquino III, making the only banknote series to be approved by two presidents.

The members of the numismatic committee included Bangko Sentral Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo and Dr. Ambeth Ocampo, chairman of the National Historical Institute. Designed by Studio 5 Designs and Design Systemat, the new banknotes&#x27; designs feature famous Filipinos and iconic natural wonders. Former President Corazon Aquino was added to the 500-peso bill together with her husband Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. The word &quot;Pilipino&quot; is rendered on the reverse and on the front in Baybayin () as a see-through register, which is a security feature where if you hold up the note against the light, an image will form, in this case, it&#x27;s a word that will form. The font used for lettering in the banknotes is Myriad, while the numerals are set in the Twentieth Century font.

The New Generation Currency series is the only circulating set of notes since August 2, 2019. In 2017, the BSP updated the design of the NGC series banknotes with the following changes:
* Enlarged the font size of the year of issue (all banknotes)
* Italicized the scientific names on the reverse (all banknotes)
* Replaced the images of the Aguinaldo Shrine and the Barasoain Church on the obverse side of the ₱200 banknote with scenes of the Declaration of Philippine Independence and the opening of the Malolos Congress respectively.
* The text &quot;October 1944&quot; was added after the word &quot;Leyte Landing&quot; at the obverse of the ₱50 banknote
* The Order of Lakandula Medal and the phrase “Medal of Honor” were removed on the obverse side of the ₱1000 banknote

In 2020, the Enhanced NGC series all banknotes except for the ₱20 were updated with the following changes:
* The addition of intaglio tactile markings for the visually impaired in the form of horizontal bands (all banknotes)
* The addition of an improved windowed security thread for the ₱100, ₱200, ₱500, ₱1000 banknotes featuring indigenous weaving patterns.
* For the ₱1000 note the thread size has been increased to 5 millimetres, with the rest remaining the same.
* For the ₱500 and ₱1000, the denomination value has been embossed with optically variable ink wherein the color changes if the banknote is tilted.
* A stylized Philippine Flag has also been added with optically variable ink on the ₱500 note replacing optically variable device patch.
* The Concealed Value are more reflective (all banknotes). 
* For the ₱500 and ₱1000, the denomination at the left has a rolling bar effect which you can tilt, and changing colors. 

On December 7, 2022, the 2020 BSP logo is now used on 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000-peso (non-polymer version) bills which replaced the 2010 logo that has been in use since the series&#x27; release to the public on December 16, 2010, upon the release of banknotes bearing the signatures of President Bongbong Marcos and BSP Governor Felipe Medalla.

Signature pairs of the President of the Philippines and Governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas appearing on the banknotes:
* 2010–2016: Benigno Aquino III, Amando Tetangco Jr.
* 2016–2017: Rodrigo Duterte, Amando Tetangco Jr.
* 2017–2019: Rodrigo Duterte, Nestor Espenilla Jr.

* 2022–2023: Bongbong Marcos, Felipe Medalla
* 2024–present: Bongbong Marcos, Eli Remolona
====Errors====
Several errors have been discovered on banknotes of the New Generation series and have become the subject of ridicule on social networking sites. Among these are the exclusion of Batanes from the Philippine map on the reverse of all denominations, the mislocation of the Puerto Princesa Subterranean Underground River on the reverse of the 500-peso bill and the Tubbataha Reef on the 1000-peso bill, and the incorrect coloring on the beak and feathers of the blue-naped parrot on the 500-peso bill. The scientific names of the animals featured on the reverse sides of all banknotes were incorrectly rendered as well.

According to Design Systemat, the designers of the new bills, that drafts prepared by the company of the new 500-peso bill shows a red beak of the blue-naped parrot. This color was changed by the printers to account for practical printing concerns. The designers further explains that printing banknotes is not like printing brochures. Due to the intaglio printing and limited printing capability of banknote printers, it can only produce a limited full color reproduction.

The alleged mislocation of the Tubbataha Reef on the one thousand peso note was due to a security feature, a smaller version of the featured species on the bills&#x27; reverse (which is also featured on all banknote denominations) was located on top of the exact location of the Tubbataha Reef on the map. Giving the option of either moving the key security feature on the standard position or locating the Tubbataha marker correctly, the bills&#x27; French printers, Oberthur Technologies, decided to move the reef marker slightly south on the Philippine map.

===First Philippine Polymer Banknote Series (current; 2024–present)===

In April 2022, the BSP in partnership with the Reserve Bank of Australia, released a limited trial polymer version of the 1000-piso banknote, with the same design elements from the New Generation Currency series but now features an image of the Philippine Eagle with a clear window of Sampaguita, the national flower of the Philippines. The banknote is also the first to be printed which features the 2020 logo of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which has received much criticism from the general public. In an interview, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno stated that “The new series will focus on fauna and flora in the Philippines.” 

On December 19, 2024, the designs for the 50, 100 and 500 piso polymer banknotes were revealed during a presentation to President Bongbong Marcos, who led the unveiling ceremony in Malacañang, and it will be in circulation on December 23, 2024, in limited quantities and in the Greater Manila area.

==Commemorative banknotes==
Commemorative banknotes have been issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas to memorialize events of historic significance to the Philippines. Most commonly they were issued by adding a commemorative overprint on the watermark area of a circulating denomination. Less common are especially-designed non-circulating commemorative banknotes sold to collectors at a premium over face value.

===Higher value commemorative banknotes===

====2,000 piso====

The Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) issued only 300,000 pieces of this 216 mm x 133 mm 2,000 Philippine peso centennial commemorative legal tender banknote. Another version, with the same design but measured at 160 x 66 mm, was also planned to be issued as legal tender in 2001, but due to the ouster of President Joseph Estrada as the result of the Second EDSA revolution (EDSA People Power II), the notes were stored in the vaults of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. As of 2010, the bank was considering destroying the bulk of the unissued notes (known as the &quot;New Millennium&quot; or &quot;Erap&quot; notes), saving only 50,000 of the five million pieces to be demonetized for &quot;historical, educational, numismatic, or other purposes&quot;. However it was not until 2012 that the bank began selling this numismatic product in a folder that clearly stipulates that the notes are not legal tender.

The obverse side features President Joseph Estrada taking his oath of office on June 30, 1998, in the historic Barasoain Church, the seat of the first democratic republic in Asia shown in the background as well as the scroll containing the excerpt texts from the Preamble of the Malolos Constitution and the place (Barasoain) and the date (January 20, 1899 in words) of ratification written in Spanish, and the seal of the BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas). The reverse side depicts the re-enactment of the declaration of Philippine Independence at the Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit, Cavite on June 12, 1998, by President Fidel V. Ramos and also features the Philippine Centennial Commission logo, but in the smaller version, it was replaced by the phrase of &quot;Tiwala Kay Bathala, Pagmamahal sa Bayan&quot;. The security features of the note include a 3-dimensional cylinder mold-made portrait watermark of the two presidents and the years 1898–1998 (in smaller version, the electrotype 1898–1998 was removed), iridescent band, color-shift windowed security thread, concealed image and perfect see-through register.

====100,000 piso====

The 100,000-peso centennial note, measuring 356 x 216 mm, was accredited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&#x27;s largest legal tender note in terms of size. 1,000 pieces were issued during the celebration of the centennial of Philippine independence in 1998. It has since been surpassed by the somewhat larger 600 Malaysian ringgit banknote.

====5,000 piso====

On January 18, 2021, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, in cooperation with the Quincentennial Commemorations in the Philippines launches the 5,000-Piso Commemorative Non-Circulating Banknote, in honor of heroism of Lapulapu. On its obverse, the banknote depicts a young Lapulapu, an image of the Battle of Mactan, the QCP logo, and the Karakoa, the large outrigger warships used by native Filipinos, while on its reverse shows the Philippine eagle, or the Manaol, which symbolizes clear vision, freedom, and strength; and which embodies the ancient Visayan belief that all living creatures originated from an eagle, also featured are the tree of a coconut, which was food the people of Samar provided to Ferdinand Magellan and his crew; and Mount Apo, which is located in Mindanao, where the circumnavigators finally found directional clues to their intended destination of Maluku or the Spice Island.

<text>Burislav, Burisleif, Burysław (died 1008) is the name of a Wendish king from Scandinavian sagas who is said to rule over Wendland. He is said to be father of Gunhild, Astrid and Geira. There are three possible hypotheses over his identity: first, that there actually was a Slavic prince of that name; second, that this was the name given by saga authors to any Slavic prince; third, that he is a compound person, combining two Polish rulers: Mieszko I of Poland and Bolesław I of Poland.

<text>Iringa is a city in Tanzania with a population of 202,490 () and situated at a latitude of 7.77°S and longitude of 35.69°E. The name is derived from the Hehe word &quot;lilinga&quot;, meaning fort. Iringa is the administrative capital of Iringa Region. Iringa Municipal Council is the administrative designation of the Municipality of Iringa.
Iringa has been one of the coldest regions in Tanzania due to its geographical location but that has attracted a lot of tourists from colder regions abroad especially Western Europe. Iringa also hosts one of Africa’s largest national parks the Ruaha National Park.

==Geography==
The town stretches along a hilltop overlooking the Little Ruaha River to the south, and spreads along ridges and valleys to the north. Iringa is in the Udzungwa Mountains, and the altitude of the town&#x27;s environs is more than above sea level. The months of June, July, and August can see low temperatures near freezing. The Tanzam Highway passes through the valley below the town; the highway distance from Iringa&#x27;s limits to Dar es Salaam is , via Morogoro.

===Climate===
Iringa has a fairly dry climate with mild-to-warm temperatures year round. Iringa has a wet season from December to April, and a nearly rainless period from June to September. Its climate is classified by Köppen as a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;).
==History==
The Isimila Stone Age site, which lies about to the southwest, contains archeological artifacts, particularly stone tools, from human habitation about 70,000 years ago.

Iringa Region is home to the Hehe people. After their defeat at Lugalo by the Hehe, led by Chief Mkwawa, the Germans built a military station at &#x27;Neu Iringa&#x27; to avenge the death of their commander Emil von Zelewski and to teach the Hehe respect for German authority. The fortress and headquarters of Chief Mkwawa was in the nearby village of Kalenga, Alt Iringa.

==Education==

Iringa has several institutions of higher education, including Tumaini University, Iringa University College, Mkwawa University College of Education (a constituent college of the University of Dar es Salaam), and Ruaha Catholic University (RUCU)). There are also secondary schools like Tosamaganga high school, Malangali high school, Iringa girls&#x27; secondary school, Ifunda technical school and Ruaha Secondary School.

==Economy==

The trans-African automobile route — the Cairo-Cape Town Highway passes through Iringa. Iringa has a well-established industrial base, including food processing and logistics industries. Most of its electricity comes from the nearby Mtera Dam. Iringa is a minor transport hub for regular bus travelers. It is a center for trucking services to Dar es Salaam, Mbeya, Songea, and Dodoma and other regions of Tanzania. It is also a servicing town for trucks going to neighboring countries such as Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Burundi and other EAC countries.

==Crafts==
Iringa is known for its woven baskets, made from local reeds. The baskets are used across Tanzania and exported internationally. The city is also known for the award-winning Neema Crafts Centre.

==Media==

Iringa municipality has seven FM radio stations: Trap Gang Radio, Ebony FM, Shamba FM Radio, Nuru FM (youth entertainment and commercial radios), Overcomers Radio and Radio Furaha (Christian stations), Kibra Ten Radio (a Muslim station). There are other radio stations elsewhere in Iringa region, such as Kitulo community radio in Makete and another FM radio station in Njombe.

Iringa has one TV station: Municipal Television, a multi-age TV station with diversified programmes.

<text>In Euclidean geometry, two-dimensional rotations and reflections are two kinds of Euclidean plane isometries which are related to one another.

==Process==
A rotation in the plane can be formed by composing a pair of reflections. First reflect a point to its image on the other side of line . Then reflect to its image on the other side of line . If lines and make an angle with one another, then points and will make an angle around point , the intersection of and . I.e., angle will measure .

A pair of rotations about the same point will be equivalent to another rotation about point . On the other hand, the composition of a reflection and a rotation, or of a rotation and a reflection (composition is not commutative), will be equivalent to a reflection.

==Mathematical expression==
The statements above can be expressed more mathematically. Let a rotation about the origin by an angle be denoted as . Let a reflection about a line through the origin which makes an angle with the -axis be denoted as . Let these rotations and reflections operate on all points on the plane, and let these points be represented by position vectors. Then a rotation can be represented as a matrix,
formula_1

and likewise for a reflection,
formula_2

With these definitions of coordinate rotation and reflection, the following four identities hold:
formula_3

==Proof==
These equations can be proved through straightforward matrix multiplication and application of trigonometric identities, specifically the sum and difference identities.

The set of all reflections in lines through the origin and rotations about the origin, together with the operation of composition of reflections and rotations, forms a group. The group has an identity: . Every rotation has an inverse . Every reflection is its own inverse. Composition has closure and is associative, since matrix multiplication is associative.

Notice that both and have been represented with orthogonal matrices. These matrices all have a determinant whose absolute value is unity. Rotation matrices have a determinant of +1, and reflection matrices have a determinant of −1.

The set of all orthogonal two-dimensional matrices together with matrix multiplication form the orthogonal group: .

The following table gives examples of rotation and reflection matrix :

<doc id="596277" wikidata="Q2444002" url="?curid=596277" title="Synodic day">
<text>A synodic day (or synodic rotation period or solar day) is the period for a celestial object to rotate once in relation to the star it is orbiting, and is the basis of solar time.

The synodic day is distinguished from the sidereal day, which is one complete rotation in relation to distant stars and is the basis of sidereal time.

In the case of a tidally locked planet, the same side always faces its parent star, and its synodic day is infinite. Its sidereal day, however, is equal to its orbital period.

==Earth==
Earth&#x27;s synodic day is the time it takes for the Sun to pass over the same meridian (a line of longitude) on consecutive days, whereas a sidereal day is the time it takes for a given distant star to pass over a meridian on consecutive days. For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, a synodic day could be measured as the time taken for the Sun to move from exactly true south (i.e. its highest declination) on one day to exactly south again on the next day (or exactly true north in the Southern Hemisphere).

For Earth, the synodic day is not constant, and changes over the course of the year due to the eccentricity of Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun and the axial tilt of the Earth. The longest and shortest synodic days&#x27; durations differ by about 51 seconds. The mean length, however, is 24 hours (with fluctuations on the order of milliseconds), and is the basis of solar time. The difference between the &quot;mean&quot; and &quot;apparent&quot; solar time is the equation of time, which can also be seen in Earth&#x27;s analemma. Because of the variation in the length of the synodic day, the days with the longest and shortest period of daylight do not coincide with the solstices near the equator.

As viewed from Earth during the year, the Sun appears to slowly drift along an imaginary path coplanar with Earth&#x27;s orbit, known as the ecliptic, on a spherical background of seemingly fixed stars. Each synodic day, this gradual motion is a little less than 1° eastward (360° per 365.25 days), in a manner known as prograde motion.

Certain spacecraft orbits, Sun-synchronous orbits, have orbital periods that are a fraction of a synodic day. Combined with a nodal precession, this allows them to always pass over a location on Earth&#x27;s surface at the same mean solar time.

==The Moon==
Due to tidal locking with Earth, the Moon&#x27;s synodic day (the lunar day or synodic rotation period) is the same as its synodic period with Earth and the Sun (the period of the lunar phases, the synodic lunar month, which is the month of the lunar calendar).

==Venus==
Due to the slow retrograde rotational speed of Venus, its synodic rotation period of 117 Earth days is about half the length of its sidereal rotational period (sidereal day) and even its orbital period.

==Mercury==
Due to Mercury&#x27;s slow rotational speed and fast orbit around the Sun, its synodic rotation period of 176 Earth days is three times longer than its sidereal rotational period (sidereal day) and twice as long as its orbital period.

<doc id="596282" wikidata="Q2403973" url="?curid=596282" title="Class number problem">
<text>In mathematics, the Gauss class number problem (for imaginary quadratic fields), as usually understood, is to provide for each &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1 a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields formula_1 (for negative integers &quot;d&quot;) having class number &quot;n&quot;. It is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss. It can also be stated in terms of discriminants. There are related questions for real quadratic fields and for the behavior as formula_2.

The difficulty is in effective computation of bounds: for a given discriminant, it is easy to compute the class number, and there are several ineffective lower bounds on class number (meaning that they involve a constant that is not computed), but effective bounds (and explicit proofs of completeness of lists) are harder.

==Gauss&#x27;s original conjectures==
The problems are posed in Gauss&#x27;s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae of 1801 (Section V, Articles 303 and 304).

Gauss discusses imaginary quadratic fields in Article 303, stating the first two conjectures, and discusses real quadratic fields in Article 304, stating the third conjecture.
;Gauss conjecture (class number tends to infinity): formula_3
;Gauss class number problem (low class number lists): For given low class number (such as 1, 2, and 3), Gauss gives lists of imaginary quadratic fields with the given class number and believes them to be complete.
;Infinitely many real quadratic fields with class number one: Gauss conjectures that there are infinitely many real quadratic fields with class number one.

The original Gauss class number problem for imaginary quadratic fields is significantly different and easier than the modern statement: he restricted to even discriminants, and allowed non-fundamental discriminants.

==Status==
;Gauss conjecture: solved, Heilbronn, 1934.
;Low class number lists: class number 1: solved, Baker (1966), Stark (1967), Heegner (1952).
:Class number 2: solved, Baker (1971), Stark (1971)
:Class number 3: solved, Oesterlé (1985)
:Class numbers h up to 100: solved, Watkins 2004
;Infinitely many real quadratic fields with class number one: Open.

==Lists of discriminants of class number 1==

For imaginary quadratic number fields, the (fundamental) discriminants of class number 1 are:
:formula_4
The non-fundamental discriminants of class number 1 are:
:formula_5
Thus, the even discriminants of class number 1, fundamental and non-fundamental (Gauss&#x27;s original question) are:
:formula_6

==Modern developments==
In 1934, Hans Heilbronn proved the Gauss conjecture. Equivalently, for any given class number, there are only finitely many imaginary quadratic number fields with that class number.

Also in 1934, Heilbronn and Edward Linfoot showed that there were at most 10 imaginary quadratic number fields with class number 1 (the 9 known ones, and at most one further).
The result was ineffective (see effective results in number theory): it did not give bounds on the size of the remaining field.

In later developments, the case &quot;n&quot; = 1 was first discussed by Kurt Heegner, using modular forms and modular equations to show that no further such field could exist. This work was not initially accepted; only with later work of Harold Stark and Bryan Birch (e.g. on the Stark–Heegner theorem and Heegner number) was the position clarified and Heegner&#x27;s work understood. Practically simultaneously, Alan Baker proved what we now know as Baker&#x27;s theorem on linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers, which resolved the problem by a completely different method. The case &quot;n&quot; = 2 was tackled shortly afterwards, at least in principle, as an application of Baker&#x27;s work.

The complete list of imaginary quadratic fields with class number 1 is formula_7 where &quot;d&quot; is one of
:formula_8

The general case awaited the discovery of Dorian Goldfeld in 1976 that the class number problem could be connected to the &quot;L&quot;-functions of elliptic curves. This effectively reduced the question of effective determination to one about establishing the existence of a multiple zero of such an &quot;L&quot;-function. With the proof of the Gross–Zagier theorem in 1986, a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number could be specified by a finite calculation. All cases up to &quot;n&quot; = 100 were computed by Watkins in 2004. The class number of formula_9 for &quot;d&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... is

:formula_10 .

==Real quadratic fields==
The contrasting case of &quot;real&quot; quadratic fields is very different, and much less is known. That is because what enters the analytic formula for the class number is not &quot;h&quot;, the class number, on its own — but &quot;h&quot; log &quot;ε&quot;, where &quot;ε&quot; is a fundamental unit. This extra factor is hard to control. It may well be the case that class number 1 for real quadratic fields occurs infinitely often.

The Cohen–Lenstra heuristics are a set of more precise conjectures about the structure of class groups of quadratic fields. For real fields they predict that about 75.45% of the fields obtained by adjoining the square root of a prime will have class number 1, a result that agrees with computations.

<doc id="596287" wikidata="Q4939476" url="?curid=596287" title="Bolita">
<text>Bolita (Spanish for &quot;Little Ball&quot;) is a type of lottery which was popular in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries in Cuba and among Florida&#x27;s working class Hispanic, Italian, and black population. In the basic bolita game, 100 small numbered balls are placed into a bag and mixed thoroughly, and bets are taken on which number will be drawn. Many variations on this theme were created. Bets were typically very small and sometimes sold well in advance, and the game could be rigged, by having extra balls of a given number or not including others at all. Other means of cheating included having certain balls filled with lead so they would sink to the bottom of the bag, or putting certain balls in ice beforehand so they would be cold and therefore easy for the selector to find by touch. Over time, Hispanics developed a name for each number in a system called La Charada or Las Charadas, creating a superstitious method for interpreting game outcomes or placing bets, many times in accordance with one&#x27;s dreams the previous night.

Today Bolita is played in the United States, among Cuban, Dominican and Puerto Rican groups.

==History==
Bolita was brought to Tampa, Florida, in the 1880s, and flourished in Ybor City&#x27;s many Latin saloons. Though the game was illegal in Florida, thousands of dollars in bribes to politicians and law enforcement officials kept the game running out in the open. The alleged king of bolita in the 1920s was Tampa native, Charlie Wall. During the late 1920s, a turf war began between Wall and Italian gangster Ignacio Antinori, who fought each other, as for control of the numbers rackets in the Tampa area. By the 1930s, Ignacio Antinori and Charlie Wall were in a bloody war for ten years, which would later be known as &quot;Era of Blood&quot;. Wall&#x27;s closest associate, Evaristo &quot;Tito&quot; Rubio was shot on his porch on March 8, 1938. Eddie Virella, &quot;Tito&#x27;s&quot; former partner at the Lincoln Club, was shot down by gunmen little more than a year before, on 31 January 1937. The war ended in the 1940s with Ignacio Antinori being shot and killed with a sawed-off shotgun. Later, Italian mafiosi Santo Trafficante, Sr. and Santo Trafficante, Jr. also figured prominently in the Florida bolita games. Bolita was widely played in Miami in the middle of the 20th century. In New York, after World War I Casper Holstein was called &quot;Bolita King&quot;.

The game has been illegal in Cuba since the Cuban Revolution, but a form of the game based on the results of the Florida Lottery is still played by many Cubans. When played on money bets, it is also illegal in Puerto Rico.

<text>Sook-Yin Lee is a Canadian broadcaster, musician, film director, actress and multimedia artist. She is a former MuchMusic VJ and a former radio host on CBC Radio. She has appeared in films, notably in the John Cameron Mitchell movie &quot;Shortbus&quot;.

==Early and personal life==
Lee was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. She is the second daughter of father, Leo Lee, from Hong Kong and a mother from Mainland China, Lee was raised as a devout Roman Catholic. Her father was a post-World War II orphan from Hong Kong, and her mother an escapee from Communist China who remained in and out of psychiatric institutions when Lee was young. Lee also has a sister, Deanna, a Vancouver-based artist. She grew up within a strict, secretive and unstable family. When Lee was 15, her parents split up and Lee ran away from home, for a time living on the street before eventually living with a &quot;community of lesbians and artists&quot;.

In the mid-1980s, she became the lead singer for Bob&#x27;s Your Uncle, a Vancouver alternative rock band. Lee often incorporated performance art techniques into the band&#x27;s melodic rock. When that band broke up, Lee pursued a solo music career, releasing several solo albums and performing as an actor in theatre, film and television projects. She was the lead singer for the band Slan. Neko Case covered Lee&#x27;s song &quot;Knock Loud&quot; on her 2001 EP &quot;Canadian Amp&quot;.

She had a relationship with the comic artist Chester Brown from 1992 until 1996. She is depicted in several of his comics. He moved to Vancouver for two years to be with her, and moved back to Toronto with her when she became a VJ for MuchMusic. He also drew the cover for her 1996 solo album &quot;Wigs &#x27;n Guns&quot;. Brown&#x27;s relationship with Lee is the last boyfriend/girlfriend relationship he had, as he explains in &quot;Paying for It&quot;. They remain good friends, and Brown has contributed artwork to her productions as recently as 2009&#x27;s &quot;Year of the Carnivore&quot;; in 2024, Lee directed the film adaptation of Brown&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Paying for It&quot;.

She was later in a relationship with writer and musician Adam Litovitz, who was also her frequent artistic collaborator, from 2007 until 2018. They occasionally performed improvised musical sets under the name LLVK, short for Lee/Litovitz/Valdivia/Kamino, and formed the band Jooj, which released its debut album in 2015. An album of music written by Sook-Yin and Adam was completed in 2020 and was released under the title of &quot;jooj two&quot; in April 2021 on Mint Records.

She resides in Toronto.

Lee is bisexual and gender-fluid.

==Career==
===Broadcasting===
Lee became a VJ for MuchMusic in 1995, hosting MuchMusic&#x27;s alternative music show &quot;The Wedge&quot;.

In 1995, on the day that sexual orientation was held to be protected under section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by the Supreme Court of Canada in the &quot;Egan v Canada&quot; case, Lee celebrated the decision by kissing a woman on the air. She later appeared on the cover of &quot;Xtra!&quot; in 1997.

During her last appearance as a MuchMusic VJ in 2001, Lee and her co-host turned their backs to the camera, and mooned the audience on live television.

She became the new host of CBC Radio One&#x27;s Saturday afternoon pop culture magazine radio-show &quot;Definitely Not the Opera&quot; in 2002. &quot;Definitely Not the Opera&quot; completed its run in 2016.

In the fall of 2004, she hosted a documentary celebrating Terry Fox as part of the CBC Television series &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot;.

During the Summer of 2008, Lee was a member of the CBC Olympic broadcasting team for the Beijing games. During the games, Lee filmed a TV spot that touched upon concerns regarding human rights and political issues.

In 2016, Lee hosted the 10 episode summer series &quot;Sleepover&quot; for CBC Radio, which continued as a podcast until 2018.

In 2020, Lee hosted &quot;Landscape Artist of the Year Canada&quot;, a Canadian adaptation of &quot;Landscape Artist of the Year&quot;, for Makeful.

===Film work===
As a feminist, Lee specifically works on films that discuss feminist and/or racial issues. &quot;Escapades of One Particular Mr. Noodle&quot; (1990) was her debut as a feminist film director. This film was produced by Studio D, a primarily feminist film production company, as one of the short films in their segment &quot;Five Feminist Minutes&quot; (1990).

Lee played the lead character Alessa Woo, alongside fellow Canadian actor Adam Beach, in Helen Lee&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;The Art of Woo&quot;.

Lee also has a smaller part in John Cameron Mitchell&#x27;s film &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot;, playing Kwahng-Yi, a guitarist in Hedwig&#x27;s rock band made up of Korean-born army wives.

In 2003, she became the centre of controversy when Mitchell first announced that he was casting Lee in his film &quot;Shortbus&quot; (released 2006). Due to Mitchell&#x27;s announcement that the film was to be sexually explicit in nature – Lee and other cast members perform non-simulated intercourse and masturbation on screen – the CBC initially threatened to fire her. In making &quot;Shortbus&quot;, Mitchell sought to make a film about love and sex without censoring itself. Celebrities such as director Francis Ford Coppola, R.E.M.&#x27;s Michael Stipe, actress Julianne Moore and artist and musician Yoko Ono, as well as the CBC&#x27;s listening audience, rallied behind her, and the CBC ultimately relented. The movie premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Her performance in &quot;Shortbus&quot; earned Lee the 2007 &quot;International Cinephile Society Award for Best Supporting Actress&quot;.
This was not her first film that explores a sexually explicit nature. She acted in &quot;3 Needles&quot; (2005), a short film about HIV and AIDS. The film takes place in various locations around the world - Canada, China, and South Africa - demonstrating the universality of STDs/STIs.

In 2012, she was chosen to play Olivia Chow in the biopic television film &quot;Jack&quot;, alongside Rick Roberts as Jack Layton. The film aired on CBC Television in 2013. She subsequently won the 2014 Canadian Screen Award for &quot;Best Performance by a Lead Dramatic Actress in a Program/Mini-Series.&quot;

Lee stars in, wrote and directed &quot;The Brazilian&quot; segment of the 2008 film &quot;Toronto Stories&quot;.

Her feature film directorial debut &quot;Year of the Carnivore&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009. Lee, Litovitz and Buck 65 also collaborated on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, which garnered a Genie Award nomination for Best Original Score at the 31st Genie Awards.

Her second feature film as a director, &quot;Octavio Is Dead!&quot;, premiered at the Inside Out Film and Video Festival in 2018, and received several Canadian Screen Award nominations at the 7th Canadian Screen Awards.

===Theatrical work===
In 2013, Lee wrote and starred in a theatrical performance show &quot;How Can I Forget?&quot; at Toronto&#x27;s Rhubarb and Summerworks theatre festivals. She and Litovitz also staged &quot;Morrice Fled: Two Paintings Talk to Each Other&quot;, a pop-up performance at the Art Gallery of Ontario based on the art of James Wilson Morrice, in January.
In 2014, Lee choreographed a dance solo for Syreeta Hector as part of &quot;On Display&quot; for Toronto Dance Theatre. From 2015 to 2017, she created and directed &quot;Sphere of Banished Suffering&quot; with dancers Jenn Goodwin, Mairi Greig, and Charlie McGettigan with Litovitz developed in residencies with LUFF art+dialogue, Dancemakers, Artscape Sandbox, and premiered at the Festival of New Dance 2017.

In 2019, she wrote and appeared in &quot;Unsafe&quot;, a documentary theatre production on the topic of censorship, at Canadian Stage.

<doc id="596297" wikidata="Q329480" url="?curid=596297" title="MTU Turbomeca Rolls-Royce">
<text>MTU Turbomeca Rolls-Royce GmbH (MTR) is a multinational engine manufacturer established to develop, manufacture, and service the MTR390 turboshaft engine. It is a joint venture by three European aero-engine manufacturers, Germany&#x27;s MTU Aero Engines, France&#x27;s Turbomeca and Britain&#x27;s Rolls-Royce.

To date, the company&#x27;s only product has been the MTR390, which was specifically developed for helicopter applications. It powers the Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter.

==History==
MTU Turbomeca Rolls-Royce (MTR) was established in June 1989 as a part of the framework created on behalf of the French and West German governments to developed an advanced multirole battlefield helicopter, the Eurocopter Tiger. While a joint venture between the French aerospace firm Aérospatiale and German company Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) was chosen as the principal contractors to develop the rotorcraft itself, a separate entity was established to develop the MTR390 powerplant to power it. Specifically, MTR was designated as the programme management company responsible for the engine, and was jointly staffed by the partner companies, Germany&#x27;s MTU Aero Engines, France&#x27;s Turbomeca and Britain&#x27;s Rolls-Royce.

Operationally, MTR manages the direction and coordination of all development, production and support activities associated with the MTR390 engine; it is also responsible for marketing and sales of the engine for other military and civil applications. The company is recognised as the responsible contractual party accountable to the government agencies of the customer nations. Work is divided into functional groups formed by members of each partner company. The engine is constructed from modules that are separately manufactured at the facilities of the MTR partner companies. The initial workshare was as follows: Turbomeca produced the compressor, gearbox, accessories and control system, Rolls-Royce manufactured the power turbine stage, while MTU was responsible for the combustor, high-pressure turbine, along with the final assembly of the entire first batch of engines.

During 1997, the engine programme advanced to the production investment phase; that same year, it was granted civil registration, while military qualification would follow during 1999. On 18 June 1999, Germany and France publicly placed orders for an initial batch of 160 Tiger helicopters, 80 for each nation, valued at €3.3 billion. Accordingly, during early 2000, an initial production contract was signed by the German Federal Office of Defence Technology and Procurement (BWB) and MTR; valued at DM430 million and comprising 320 engines plus spares, the contract represented the MTU390&#x27;s clearance for production. On 22 March 2002, the first production Tiger was rolled out in a large ceremony held at Eurocopter&#x27;s Donauwörth factory; although production models began initial acceptance trials in 2003, the first official delivery to the French Army took place on 18 March 2005; the first official Tiger delivery to Germany followed on 6 April 2005.

The MTU390 itself is a FADEC-controlled turboshaft engine; each Tiger helicopter is powered by a pair of these engines. At one point, it was projected that roughly 1,000 engines would be produced in-line with a production run of 427 Tigers. Later-built models of the Tiger are furnished with more powerful models of the MTU390 engine than had been installed upon the initial examples.

<doc id="596298" wikidata="Q15524996" url="?curid=596298" title="Jimmy Breslin">
<text>James Earle Breslin (October 17, 1928 – March 19, 2017) was an American journalist and author. Until the time of his death, he wrote a column for the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; Sunday edition. He wrote numerous novels, and columns of his appeared regularly in various newspapers in his hometown of New York City. He served as a regular columnist for the Long Island newspaper &quot;Newsday&quot; until his retirement on November 2, 2004, though he still published occasional pieces for the paper until his death. 

He was known for his newspaper columns that became the brash embodiment of the street-smart New Yorker, chronicling wise guys and big-city power brokers but always offered a sympathetic viewpoint of the white working-class people of New York City, and was awarded the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary &quot;for columns which consistently champion ordinary citizens.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Breslin was born on October 17, 1928, into an Irish Catholic family in Jamaica, Queens, New York. His alcoholic father, James Earl Breslin, a piano player, went out one day to buy rolls and never returned. Breslin and his sister, Deirdre, were raised by their mother, Frances (Curtin), a high school teacher and New York City Welfare Department investigator, during the Great Depression in the United States.

Breslin attended Long Island University from 1948 to 1950. He left without graduating.

==Career==

Breslin began working for the &quot;Long Island Press&quot; as a copy boy in the 1940s. After leaving college, he became a columnist. His early columns were attributed to politicians and ordinary people that he chatted with in various watering holes near Queens Borough Hall. Breslin was a columnist for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Daily News&quot;, the &quot;New York Journal American&quot;, &quot;Newsday&quot;, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, the &quot;National Police Gazette&quot; and other venues. 

When the Sunday supplement of the &quot;Tribune&quot; was reworked into &quot;New York&quot; magazine by editor Clay Felker in 1962, Breslin appeared in the new edition, which became &quot;the hottest Sunday read in town.&quot;

One of his best known columns was published the day after John F. Kennedy&#x27;s funeral and focused on the man who had dug the president&#x27;s grave. The column is indicative of Breslin&#x27;s style, which often highlights how major events or the actions of those considered &quot;newsworthy&quot; affect the &quot;common man.&quot; Breslin&#x27;s public profile in the 1960s as a regular guy led to a brief stint as a TV pitchman for Piels Beer, including a bar room commercial wherein he intoned in his deep voice: &quot;Piels—it&#x27;s a good drinkin&#x27; beer!&quot;

In 1969, Breslin ran for president of the New York City Council in tandem with Norman Mailer, who was seeking election as mayor, on the unsuccessful independent 51st State ticket advocating secession of the city from the rest of the state. A memorable quotation of his from the experience: &quot;I am mortified to have taken part in a process that required bars to be closed.&quot; The ticket was referred to as &quot;Vote the Rascals In.&quot;

Breslin&#x27;s career as an investigative journalist led him to cultivate ties with various Mafia and criminal elements in the city, not always with positive results. In 1970, he was viciously attacked and brutally beaten at The Suite, a restaurant then owned by Lucchese crime family associate Henry Hill. The attack was carried out by Irish mobster Jimmy Burke, who objected to an article Breslin had written involving another member of the Lucchese family, Paul Vario. Breslin suffered a major concussion, a minor concussion, three broken fingers, a fractured rib, a broken nose and nosebleeding, but survived the ordeal without any permanent injury. He filed a police report claiming Burke attacked him, but no charges were filed.

In 1971, Breslin spoke at Harvard&#x27;s Class Day. Two years later, on September 6, 1973, he appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; alongside Glen Campbell, Don Rickles and Dom DeLuise.

In 1977, at the height of the Son of Sam scare in New York City, the killer, later identified as David Berkowitz, addressed letters to Breslin. Excerpts from the letters were published and used later in Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Summer of Sam&quot;, which Breslin, portraying himself, bookends. In 2008, the Library of America selected one of Breslin&#x27;s many Son of Sam articles published in the &quot;Daily News&quot; for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American true crime writing.

In 1978, Breslin, without significant acting experience, appeared in Joe Brooks&#x27; feature film &quot;If Ever I See You Again&quot; in a main supporting role playing &quot;Mario Marino,&quot; the assistant to two Madison Avenue jingle composers. Breslin&#x27;s performance received a Golden Turkey Award nomination for &quot;Worst Performance by a Novelist.&quot;

In 1985, he received a George Polk Award for Metropolitan Reporting. In 1986, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary.

In 1986, Breslin revealed that Donald Manes, the Borough President of Queens, was involved in a kickback scheme. Manes later committed suicide.

In October 1986, Breslin landed his own twice-weekly late night television show on ABC, &quot;Jimmy Breslin&#x27;s People&quot;, in which he was seen interviewing poor New Yorkers at home, as well as some who were incarcerated. However, because many network affiliates had already committed to syndicated programming for Breslin&#x27;s time slot when the new season started a month earlier, Breslin&#x27;s show was often delayed or preempted altogether; even the network&#x27;s flagship station WABC pushed it back from its midnight slot to 2 a.m., and would occasionally only air it one night a week. Disgusted, Breslin took out a full-page ad in &quot;The New York Times&quot; announcing that he was &quot;firing the network&quot; and would be ending the show after its December 20 broadcast (at which time his 13-week contract expired).

In 1991, while covering the Crown Heights riot, he was beaten and robbed by a crowd of youths.

Shortly before his death, Breslin and Pete Hamill were interviewed about their careers for the 2019 HBO documentary &quot;Breslin and Hamill: Deadline Artists&quot;.

==Controversies==
In May 1990, after fellow &quot;Newsday&quot; columnist Ji-Yeon Yuh described one of his articles as sexist, Breslin heatedly retorted with racial and sexual invective. Asian American and anti-hate groups forcefully decried Breslin&#x27;s outburst. Breslin appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; to banter about his outburst and Koreans in general. Following this controversial radio broadcast, &quot;Newsday&quot; managing editor Anthony Marro suspended Breslin for two weeks, who then apologized.

Author and former FBI agent Robert K. Ressler has stated that Breslin &quot;baited Berkowitz and irresponsibly contributed to the continuation of his murders&quot; by trying to sell sensationalist newspapers. In Ressler&#x27;s book &quot;Whoever Fights Monsters&quot;, Ressler condemns Breslin and the media for their involvement in encouraging serial killers by directing their activity with printed conjectures.

In return for his &quot;relentless columns on police misbehavior,&quot; the local patrolmen&#x27;s union bought protest ads in his own newspaper.

==Personal life==

Breslin was married twice. His first marriage, to Rosemary Dattolico, ended with her death in 1981. They had six children together: sons Kevin, James, Patrick, and Christopher, and daughters Rosemary and Kelly. His daughter Rosemary died June 14, 2004, from a rare blood disease, and his daughter Kelly, 44, died on April 21, 2009, four days after suffering from cardiac arrhythmia in a New York City restaurant. 

From 1982 until his death in 2017, Breslin was married to former New York City Council member Ronnie Eldridge.

==Death==
Breslin died from pneumonia on March 19, 2017, at his home in Manhattan, aged 88.

<text>Richard Lewis Thornburgh (July 16, 1932 – December 31, 2020) was an American lawyer, author, and politician who served as the 76th United States attorney general from 1988 to 1991 under presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. A Republican, he previously served as the 41st governor of Pennsylvania and as the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania.

==Early life and education==
Thornburgh was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on July 16, 1932, the son of Alice (Sanborn) and Charles Garland Thornburgh, an engineer. Thornburgh attended Mercersburg Academy then Yale University from which he obtained an engineering degree in 1954. Subsequently, he received a law degree from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law in 1957, where he served as an editor of the &quot;Law Review&quot;. Thornburgh was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa at the University of Pittsburgh in 1973, and was later awarded the society&#x27;s highest honor, the Laurel Crowned Circle Award, in 1996. He subsequently was awarded honorary degrees from 32 other colleges and universities. He joined the Pittsburgh-based law firm Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart in 1959.

Thornburgh married Ginny Hooton, and they had three sons together (John, David and Peter). Ginny Hooton was killed in an automobile accident in 1960, which left Peter, the youngest of their three sons, with physical and intellectual disability. In 1963 Thornburgh was remarried, to Ginny Judson, with whom he had another son, Bill, in 1966. Ginny (Judson) Thornburgh was a former schoolteacher from New York, who holds degrees from Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, and the Harvard Graduate School of Education. A lifelong advocate of people with disabilities, she served as Director of the Interfaith Initiative of the American Association of People with Disabilities, based in Washington, D.C., has co-authored and edited &quot;That All May Worship,&quot; an award-winning handbook for religious congregations working to include people with all types of disabilities. She received the Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights in April 2005.

The Thornburghs have four sons (John, David, Peter, and Bill), six grandchildren, and five great-granddaughters and two great-grandsons. As parents of a son with a disability, they took an interest in the needs of people with disabilities and, with their son Peter, were named &quot;Family of the Year&quot;. Both Ginny and Dick Thornburgh were featured speakers at the Vatican Conference on Disabilities held in Rome in November 1992, and were co-recipients in 2003 of the Henry B. Betts Award, the proceeds from which were used to establish the Thornburgh Family Lecture Series on Disability Law and Policy at the University of Pittsburgh. As Attorney General of the United States, Thornburgh played a leading role in the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act. In 2002, Thornburgh received the Wiley A. Branton Award of The Washington Lawyers&#x27; Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs in recognition of his &quot;commitment to the civil rights of people with disabilities.&quot;

Following an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives against William S. Moorhead in 1966, Thornburgh served as an elected delegate to the 1967–1968 Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention where he spearheaded efforts at judicial and local government reform. In 1969 President of the United States Richard Nixon appointed Thornburgh as the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, where he earned a reputation for toughness on organized crime. In 1971, Thornburgh successfully prosecuted Pittsburgh steel companies for polluting rivers based on the 1899 Refuse Act. This was before the passage of the major environmental laws that are the foundation of the EPA and was a sign of future environmental enforcement.

In 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed him to serve as the Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department&#x27;s Criminal Division. After two years at that post, Thornburgh returned to law practice in Pittsburgh and initiated a campaign for governor.

===Governor of Pennsylvania===
In 1978, Thornburgh launched a campaign for governor of Pennsylvania. Despite a Democratic majority in the commonwealth, he and running mate Bill Scranton (whose father served as governor in the 1960s) defeated Pittsburgh mayor Pete Flaherty and his running mate, educator Bob Casey (who bears no relation to Robert P. Casey, the 42nd Governor of Pennsylvania). The victory was attributed in part to Thornburgh&#x27;s campaign promises to crack down on government corruption, at a time when more than 60 persons in the Shapp administration were indicted on criminal charges. Thornburgh and Scranton were reelected in 1982. However, Scranton failed to win the governorship on his own in 1986.

Following the unprecedented 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Governor Thornburgh was described by observers as &quot;one of the few authentic heroes of that episode as a calm voice against panic.&quot; He oversaw emergency response efforts to the partial meltdown at the nuclear power plant and also had a major role in coordinating funding for cleanup efforts.

He was widely recognized for economic development and the establishment of the Ben Franklin Partnership, and for implementing welfare reform programs. Pennsylvania&#x27;s unemployment rate, among the ten highest in the nation when he was elected, was among the ten lowest when he left office as 50,000 new businesses and 500,000 new private sector jobs were created during his tenure.

Thornburgh was also responsible for consolidating all of Pennsylvania&#x27;s state-owned colleges and universities into the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. He also created the Governor&#x27;s Schools, which were summer programs for talented and gifted high school students.

In January 1987, Governor Thornburgh was made an honorary Pennsylvania State Police Trooper. This honor was presented to him upon the graduation of the 64th Pennsylvania State Police Academy Class at Hershey, Pennsylvania.

Thornburgh was the first Republican to serve two successive terms as governor of the commonwealth, and he was recognized by fellow governors in a 1986 &quot;Newsweek&quot; poll as one of the most effective big-state governors in the nation.

After leaving office in 1987, Thornburgh served as director of the Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

===U.S. Attorney General===
In 1988, President Ronald Reagan appointed Thornburgh as the United States Attorney General; he was retained in office after President George H. W. Bush was inaugurated. Thornburgh was sworn into office after unanimous confirmation by the United States Senate, and served three years as attorney general, from 1988 to 1991.

He mounted a vigorous attack on white-collar crime as the Department of Justice obtained a record number of convictions of savings and loan crisis and other securities officials, defense contractors and corrupt public officials. Thornburgh established strong ties with law enforcement agencies around the world to help combat drug trafficking, money laundering, terrorism and international white-collar crime. During his tenure as attorney general, he twice argued and won cases before the United States Supreme Court. The &quot;Legal Times&quot; noted that Thornburgh as Attorney General &quot;built a reputation as one of the most effective champions that prosecutors have ever had.&quot; As honorary Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, he chaired a panel of the National Academy of Public Administration examining the FBI&#x27;s post-9/11 transformation process and was a member of the FBI Director&#x27;s advisory board. He oversaw the major environmental litigation that resulted from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989.

All told, Thornburgh served in the Justice Department under five Presidents, beginning in Pittsburgh when serving as United States Attorney, from 1969 to 1975.

===1991 Senate bid===
He resigned as attorney general in 1991 to run for the U.S. Senate seat left vacant when Senator John Heinz was killed in a plane crash; major-party candidates were chosen by the party committees because it was too late for a primary. There was widespread speculation that Thornburgh had struck a deal with Democratic Pennsylvania Congressman and House Majority Whip William H. Gray. Gray had been the subject of an investigation into alleged campaign finance irregularities and a grand jury investigation into his church&#x27;s financial affairs. It was reported that Gray would not run in the special election, and in return Thornburgh would drop the investigation of him. Gray did not run in the election, and in fact resigned from Congress two months prior to it, in order to take a job as president and CEO of the United Negro College Fund. Thornburgh was widely expected to win the seat; however, he was defeated in a landslide by Democrat Harris Wofford, who had been the interim appointee to that seat. Wofford&#x27;s victory was widely considered a major upset. 

===Later political life===
In 1993, Thornburgh&#x27;s campaign committee was sued in federal court for unpaid campaign debt by Karl Rove, who won the case and collected $180,000 from the Thornburgh committee.

Thornburgh served a one-year appointment as Under-Secretary General at the United Nations (1992–1993) at the personal request of President Bush. This top management position at the UN put Thornburgh in charge of personnel, budget, and finance matters. His Report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations was widely praised. It pertained to reform, restructuring, and streamlining efforts designed to make the United Nations peacekeeping, humanitarian and development programs more efficient and cost-effective.

==Later life==

After his 25 years in public service, Thornburgh re-entered private legal practice returning to K&amp;L Gates, the law firm he originally joined in 1959. In 2002, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York appointed him as an examiner in the WorldCom bankruptcy proceedings. His report to the court included damning criticism of Arthur Andersen, WorldCom&#x27;s accounting firm, and banking giant Citigroup. The report concluded that the two companies aided WorldCom executives in committing fraud.

In 2004, Thornburgh was asked by CBS to undertake an independent investigation of the so-called Rathergate controversy with former Associated Press CEO, Lou Boccardi. Following the investigation and report, Dan Rather relinquished his anchor position on the &quot;CBS Evening News.&quot; Then in October 2005 Thornburgh was asked to represent controversial Democratic Pennsylvania politician and nationally renowned forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht, who was then serving as Coroner of Allegheny County. The federal grand jury in Pittsburgh had returned an 84-count felony indictment against Dr. Wecht. Ultimately all charges were dismissed after years, on May 14, 2009.

In February 2013, Thornburgh released a report criticizing the conclusions of Louis Freeh about the Penn State child sex abuse scandal involving Jerry Sandusky. Thornburgh was hired by the family of the late coach Joe Paterno to conduct an independent review of the Freeh report.

Thornburgh also served as a consultant to the United Nations, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank on efforts to battle fraud and corruption.

Thornburgh, a long-time supporter of self-determination, authored &quot;Puerto Rico&#x27;s Future: A Time to Decide&quot; in 2007, in which he calls for immediate change in the island&#x27;s territorial/commonwealth status. He describes it as a vestige of colonialism. He concedes, however, that change is difficult because equal segments of Puerto Ricans desire statehood or continuation of the status quo. The book is based in part on ongoing research he has done regarding Puerto Rico&#x27;s vexing political status problem since he testified as attorney general on behalf of the first Bush administration on the issue before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee of the United States Senate in 1991 and for an amicus curiae brief he filed in a Puerto Rico voting rights case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

Throughout his career, Thornburgh traveled widely by visiting over 40 countries and meeting with leaders from Canada, Mexico, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Russia, Ukraine, Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, India, Cambodia, Australia, New Zealand and Central and South America. He served as an observer to the Russian Federation&#x27;s first legislative (1993) and presidential (1996) elections. He was a former member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

The K&amp;L Gates site includes nearly 50 published articles and white papers by Thornburgh; they serve as a documentation of his career between 2001 and 2011.

Thornburgh died at a retirement community in Verona, Pennsylvania, on December 31, 2020, at age 88.

===Dick Thornburgh Papers===
The Dick Thornburgh Papers were donated to the University of Pittsburgh in 1998. The collection is housed in the university&#x27;s Hillman Library, where it is showcased in a themed reading room. The university also established the Dick Thornburgh Forum in Law and Public Policy in his honor.

In April 2019, Thornburgh announced he was retiring from K&amp;L Gates, the only private law firm with which he had ever been associated. The announcement came 60 years after Thornburgh first joined the firm.

<text>Barsetshire is a fictional English county created by Anthony Trollope in the series of novels known as the Chronicles of Barsetshire (1855-1867). The county town and cathedral city is Barchester. Other towns named in the novels include Silverbridge, Hogglestock and Greshamsbury.

==Origins==
According to E. A. Freeman, Trollope conceded to him that Barset was in origin Somerset, although Barchester itself was primarily inspired by Winchester. Other West Country counties such as Dorset also contributed, and Gatherum Castle, for example, was imported from elsewhere, but important elements such as Plumstead Episcopi were drawn directly from Somerset life, in this case Huish Episcopi. In sum, Barset was (in Trollope&#x27;s own words) &quot;a little bit of England which I have myself created&quot;.

==Political structure==

In &quot;Doctor Thorne&quot; Trollope describes how the county, formerly represented by a single parliamentary constituency, was split into two constituencies, the more rural East Barsetshire, which includes Barchester, and the more commercial West Barsetshire, by the Reform Act 1832. The borough of Silverbridge, according to the Palliser novels, also elects a Member of Parliament.

==Interpretation==
Adam Gopnik wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The six Barsetshire novels... are as much a triumph of the sympathetic imagination as Tolkien&#x27;s books: it is an entirely invented world, which Trollope entered by transposing his broader knowledge of how the world works onto the inner workings of a cathedral town. The beauty of the idea, though, was that it gave him a way to condense into comedy the crisis of his time: in an age of reform, what would happen to the most conservative and settled institution in England when reform arrived for it, too?&quot;

==Later fictional usage==

The novel &quot;Barchester Pilgrimage&quot; (1935), and some of the episodes in &quot;Let Dons Delight&quot; (1939), both by Ronald Knox, refer to Barsetshire and its inhabitants.

Barsetshire was also used as the setting for a series of 29 novels by Angela Thirkell, written from 1930 to 1961. Thirkell&#x27;s stories blend social satire with romance. Her 1946 novel, &quot;Private Enterprise&quot;, explored discontent with the bureaucracy of the Attlee government – something echoed by Orville Prescott in his poem-review beginning &quot;In Barchester all is not well&quot;. Thirkell&#x27;s final Barsetshire book, &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot;, was completed posthumously, and published in 1961.

Barsetshire is also used as the setting for Carola Oman&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere in England&quot; (Hodder and Stoughton 1943), the sequel to her &quot;Nothing to Report&quot; (Hodder and Stoughton 1940).

Barsetshire is also used in some of the Pullein-Thompson sisters books, usually referring to rival teams or as a nearby county.

Barchester and Barset were used as names for the fictional county in which St Trinians School was supposedly located in the original films.

The county is also mentioned in Michael Innes&#x27;s &quot;Appleby and Honeybath&quot; where it is suggested that &quot;the shifting of county boundaries has pretty well done away with Barsetshire&quot; (p 27).

Kevin Kwan&#x27;s novel &quot;Rich People Problems&quot; names Barsetshire and the village of Barchester as the family home of Lucien Montagu-Scott and his wife, Colette Bing.

In &quot;Vote, Vote, Vote for Nigel Barton&quot;, Dennis Potter&#x27;s 1965 teleplay, the title character runs unsuccessfully for election as a Labour candidate in the rural constituency of West Barsetshire.

HMS Barsetshire, an obsolete County class cruiser, is the training ship for officer candidates in John Winton&#x27;s &quot;We Joined The Navy&quot; (1959).

===Barchester===

Barchester is used as a railway station and location for some of the 1942 Ealing Studios film &quot;The Black Sheep of Whitehall&quot;.

Barchester Cathedral was used as the setting for the ghost story &quot;&quot; by M. R. James in his 1911 collection &quot;More Ghost Stories&quot;. It is also the setting for Charlie Lovett&#x27;s 2017 literary mystery &quot;The Lost Book of the Grail; or, A Visitor&#x27;s Guide to Barchester Cathedral&quot;.

William Golding refers to Barchester and its cathedral in passing in his 1967 novel &quot;The Pyramid&quot;, set in the small fictional market town of Stilbourne.

In J. L. Carr&#x27;s 1975 novella &quot;How Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won the F.A. Cup&quot;, the title team play in the Barchester &amp; District League. During the story, they play Barchester City (known as the Holy Boys) at home in an FA Cup qualifier.

<doc id="596325" wikidata="Q17166064" url="?curid=596325" title="Separation of church and state in the United States">
<text>&quot;Separation of church and state&quot; is a metaphor paraphrased from Thomas Jefferson and used by others in discussions of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which reads: &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof&quot;.

The principle is paraphrased from Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;separation between Church &amp; State&quot;. It has been used to express the understanding of the intent and function of this amendment, which allows freedom of religion. It is generally traced to a by Jefferson, addressed to the Danbury Baptist Association in Connecticut, and published in a Massachusetts newspaper.

Jefferson wrote:
Jefferson reflects other thinkers, including Roger Williams, a Baptist Dissenter and founder of Providence, Rhode Island. He wrote:

In keeping with the lack of an established state religion in the United States, unlike in many European nations at the time, Article Six of the United States Constitution specifies that &quot;no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States&quot;, meaning that no official state religion will be established.

The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly cited Jefferson&#x27;s metaphor of a wall of separation. In &quot;Reynolds v. United States&quot; (1879), the Court wrote that Jefferson&#x27;s comments &quot;may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [First] Amendment.&quot; In &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot; (1947), Justice Hugo Black wrote: &quot;In the words of Thomas Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state.&quot;

In contrast to this emphasis on separation, the Supreme Court in &quot;Zorach v. Clauson&quot; (1952) upheld accommodationism, holding that the nation&#x27;s &quot;institutions presuppose a Supreme Being&quot; and governmental recognition of God does not constitute the establishment of a state church the Constitution&#x27;s authors intended to prohibit.

The extent of separation between government and religion in the U.S. continues to be debated.

==Early history==
Many early immigrants traveled to North America to avoid religious persecution in their homelands, whether based on a different denomination, religion or sect. Some immigrants came from England after the English Civil War and the rise of Protestant dissenting sects in England. Others fled Protestant-Catholic religious conflicts in France and Germany. Immigrants included nonconformists such as the Puritans, who were Protestant Christians fleeing religious persecution from the Anglican King of England, and later Dissenters, such as Baptists.

The groups had a variety of attitudes on religious toleration; the Puritans, for instance, initially wanted a totally Puritan society. While some leaders, such as Roger Williams of Rhode Island and Quaker William Penn of Pennsylvania, ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies, the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony in New England established churches, initially Puritan. The Dutch colony of New Netherland established its state Dutch Reformed Church and outlawed all other worship, though enforcement was sparse in what was essentially a trading, mercantile colony. In some cases, jurisdictions wanted religious conformity for financial reasons: the established Church was responsible for poor relief, putting dissenting churches at a significant disadvantage.

===State churches in British North America prior to the Revolution===

====Catholic colonies====

* The Colony of Maryland was founded by a charter granted in 1632 to George Calvert, secretary of state to Charles I, and his son Cecil, both recent converts to Catholicism. Under their leadership allowing the practice of this denomination, many English Catholic gentry families settled in Maryland. The colonial government was officially neutral in religious affairs, granting toleration to all Christian groups and enjoining them to avoid actions that antagonized the others. On several occasions, &quot;low-church&quot; dissenters among Protestants led insurrections that temporarily overthrew the Calvert rule. In 1689, when William and Mary came to the English throne, they acceded to Protestant demands to revoke the original royal charter. In 1701 the Church of England was &quot;established&quot; as the state church in Maryland. Through the course of the eighteenth century, Protestants barred Catholics from public office in the colony, and then prohibited them from voting, disenfranchising them. Not all of the laws passed against Catholic (notably laws restricting property rights and imposing penalties for sending children to be educated in foreign Catholic institutions) were enforced, and some Catholics continued to hold public office.
* When New France was transferred to Great Britain in 1763 after it defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War, it practiced a policy of tolerating the Catholic Church in the colony. No Catholic people in Quebec or other parts of New France were forced to convert to the Anglican Church. The British did open the colony to Protestant Huguenots, who had been banned from settlement by previous French colonial authorities - a continuation of discrimination that existed in France.
* Spanish Florida was ceded to Great Britain in 1763, in exchange for it giving up other claims. The British divided Florida into two colonies, East and West Florida. Both colonies had a policy of toleration for Catholic residents, as Catholicism had been the established religion of the Spanish colonies, but established the Church of England as the state church.

====Protestant colonies====
The colonies of Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, New Haven, and New Hampshire were founded by Puritan Calvinist Protestants, and had Congregational established churches.
* Plymouth Colony was founded by Pilgrims, English Dissenters or Separatists, who were Calvinists.
* Massachusetts Bay Colony, New Haven Colony, and the New Hampshire were founded by Puritans, Anglican but Calvinist Protestants.
* The colonies of New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia officially maintained the Church of England as the established church, but the Anglican Church operated as an established church in the southern colonies. Absorbing the Dutch Calvinists and other Protestant immigrants, New York had a more diverse population.

There were also two non-British Protestant-dominated colonies that were later incorporated into British North America:
* New Netherland was founded by Dutch Reformed Calvinists.
* New Sweden was founded by Church of Sweden Lutherans.

==== Colonies without established churches ====
* The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations was founded by Baptist religious dissenters who were forced to flee the Massachusetts Bay colony. It is widely regarded as the first polity to grant religious freedom to all its citizens, although Catholics were barred intermittently. Baptists, Seekers / Quakers, and Jews made this colony their home. The King Charles Charter of 1663 guaranteed &quot;full liberty in religious concernments&quot;.
* The Province of Pennsylvania was founded by Quakers, but the colony never had an established church.
* The Province of New Jersey, without official religion, had a significant Quaker lobby, but Calvinists of all types also had a presence.
* West Jersey, also founded by Quakers, prohibited any establishment.
* Delaware Colony had no established church, but was contested between Catholics and Quakers.

====Tabular summary====
The following table lists all North American colonies administered by the United Kingdom at the commencement of the U.S. revolution, including states now incorporated in the U.S. and current provinces of Canada.

In several colonies, the establishment ceased to exist in practice at the Revolution, about 1776. Some states&#x27; laws treat 1776 as the presumptive date of permanent legal abolition; other states&#x27; constitutions and/or laws either explicitly disestablished the state&#x27;s established church (e.g. North Carolina) or forbade establishment of any religion. Some Canadian provinces (e.g. Nova Scotia) have disestablished the Church of England, but some of the pre-U.S.-revolutionary provinces retain it.

See History of the Connecticut Constitution.

In 1789, the Georgia Constitution was amended as follows: &quot;Article IV. Section 10. No person within this state shall, upon any pretense, be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping God in any manner agreeable to his own conscience, nor be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith and judgment; nor shall he ever be obliged to pay tithes, taxes, or any other rate, for the building or repairing any place of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry, contrary to what he believes to be right, or hath voluntarily engaged to do. No one religious society shall ever be established in this state, in preference to another; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of any civil right merely on account of his religious principles.&quot;

From 1780 to 1824, Massachusetts required every resident to belong to and attend a parish church, and permitted each church to tax its members, but forbade any law requiring that it be of any particular denomination. But in practice, the denomination of the local church was chosen by majority vote of town residents, which &quot;de facto&quot; established Congregationalism as the state religion. This was objected to, and was abolished in 1833. For details see Constitution of Massachusetts.

Until 1877 the New Hampshire Constitution required members of the state legislature to be of the Protestant religion. Until 1968 the Constitution allowed for state funding of Protestant classrooms but not Catholic classrooms.

The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 disestablished the Anglican church, but until 1835 it allowed only Protestants to hold public office. From 1835 to 1876 it allowed only Christians (including Catholics) to hold public office. Article VI, Section 8 of the current state constitution forbids only atheists (&quot;any person who shall deny the being of Almighty God&quot;) from holding public office. The United States Supreme Court held such clauses to be unenforceable in the 1961 case &quot;Torcaso v. Watkins&quot;, when ruling unanimously that such clauses constitute a &quot;religious test&quot; forbidden by the First Amendment prohibiting federal religious tests and the protections in the Fourteenth Amendment, which apply to the states as well as the federal government under the doctrine of incorporation.

Religious tolerance for Catholics with an established Church of England was the policy in the former Spanish Colonies of East and West Florida while under British rule.

In the Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended the American Revolutionary War, the British ceded both East and West Florida back to Spain (see Spanish Florida).

Tithes for the support of the Anglican Church in Virginia were suspended in 1776 and never restored. 1786 is the date of the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom, which prohibited any coercion to support any religious body.

===Colonial views on establishment, accommodationism, and separationism===
The Library of Congress states that:
The Rhode Island Royal Charter obtained in 1663 by Roger Williams and John Clarke contains unique provisions which make it significantly different from the charters granted to the other colonies. It gave the colonists freedom to elect their own governor and write their own laws, within very broad guidelines, and also stipulated that no person residing in Rhode Island could be &quot;molested, punished, disquieted, or called in question for any differences in opinion in matters of religion&quot;.

The Flushing Remonstrance shows support for separation of church and state as early as the mid-17th century, stating their opposition to religious persecution of any sort: &quot;The law of love, peace and liberty in the states extending to Jews, Turks and Egyptians, as they are considered sons of Adam, which is the glory of the outward state of Holland, so love, peace, and liberty, extending to all in Christ Jesus, condemns hatred, war, and bondage.&quot; The document was signed on December 27, 1657, by a group of English citizens in America who were affronted by persecution of Quakers and the religious policies of the Governor of New Netherland, Peter Stuyvesant. Stuyvesant had formally banned all religions other than the Dutch Reformed Church from being practiced in the colony, in accordance with the laws of the Dutch Republic. The signers indicated their &quot;desire therefore in this case not to judge lest we are judged, neither to condemn least we are condemned, but rather let every man stand or fall to his own Master.&quot; Stuyvesant fined the petitioners and threw them in prison until they recanted. However, John Bowne allowed the Quakers to meet in his home. Bowne was arrested, jailed, and sent to the Netherlands for trial; the Dutch court exonerated Bowne.

New York Historical Society President and Columbia University Professor of History Kenneth T. Jackson describes the Flushing Remonstrance as &quot;the first thing that we have in writing in the United States where a group of citizens attests on paper and over their signature the right of the people to follow their own conscience with regard to God - and the inability of government, or the illegality of government, to interfere with that.&quot;

Given the wide diversity of opinion on Christian theological matters in the newly independent American States, the Constitutional Convention believed a government-sanctioned (established) religion would disrupt rather than bind the newly formed union together. George Washington wrote a letter in 1790 to the country&#x27;s first Jewish congregation, the Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island to state:

Allowing rights and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it were by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.

There were also opponents to the support of any established church even at the state level. In 1773, Isaac Backus, a prominent Baptist minister in New England, wrote against a state-sanctioned religion, saying: &quot;Now who can hear Christ declare, that his kingdom is, not of this world, and yet believe that this blending of church and state together can be pleasing to him?&quot; He also observed that when &quot;church and state are separate, the effects are happy, and they do not at all interfere with each other: but where they have been confounded together, no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued.&quot; Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s influential Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was enacted in 1786, five years before the Bill of Rights.

Most Anglican ministers and many Anglicans were Loyalists. The Anglican establishment, where it had existed, largely ceased to function during the American Revolution, though the new States did not formally abolish and replace it until some years after the Revolution.

===Jefferson, Madison, and the &quot;wall of separation&quot;===
The phrase &quot;hedge or &quot;wall of separation&quot; between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world&quot; was first used by Baptist theologian Roger Williams, the founder of the colony of Rhode Island, in his 1644 book &quot;The Bloody Tenent of Persecution&quot;. Thomas Jefferson later used the phrase as a description of the First Amendment and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government, in an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists (a religious minority concerned about the dominant position of the Congregationalist church in Connecticut):

Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his god, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their &quot;legislature&quot; should &quot;make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,&quot; thus building a &quot;wall of separation&quot; between church and State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.

Jefferson&#x27;s letter was in reply to a letter from the Danbury Baptist Association dated October 7, 1801. In an 1808 letter to Virginia Baptists, Jefferson used the same theme:

We have solved, by fair experiment, the great and interesting question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to the laws. And we have experienced the quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving every one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his own reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries.

Jefferson and James Madison&#x27;s conceptions of &quot;separation&quot; have long been debated. Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia. Madison issued four religious proclamations while president, but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment. On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol. Years before the ratification of the Constitution, Madison contended, &quot;Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.&quot; After retiring from the presidency, Madison wrote of &quot;total separation of the church from the state.&quot;

Jefferson&#x27;s opponents said his position was the destruction and the governmental rejection of Christianity, but this was a caricature. In setting up the University of Virginia, Jefferson encouraged each sect to have its own preacher, though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity, arising from his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Some have argued that this arrangement was &quot;fully compatible with Jefferson&#x27;s views on the separation of church and state&quot;; others point to Jefferson&#x27;s support for a scheme in which students at the university would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation. Still other scholars, such as Mark David Hall, attempt to sidestep the issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history.

Jefferson&#x27;s letter entered American jurisprudence in the 1878 Mormon polygamy case &quot;Reynolds v. U.S.&quot;, in which Stephen Johnson Field cited Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Letter to the Danbury Baptists&quot; to state that &quot;Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion, but was left free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order.&quot;

Madison noted that Martin Luther&#x27;s doctrine of the two kingdoms marked the beginning of the modern conception of separation of church and state.

===Patrick Henry, Massachusetts, and Connecticut===
Jefferson&#x27;s and Madison&#x27;s approach was not the only one taken in the 18th century. Jefferson&#x27;s Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was drafted in opposition to a bill, chiefly supported by Patrick Henry, that would permit any Virginian to belong to any denomination but require him to belong to some denomination and pay taxes to support it. Similarly, the Constitution of Massachusetts originally provided that &quot;no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained, in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshipping God in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience... provided he doth not disturb the public peace, or obstruct others in their religious worship&quot; (Article II), but also that:

Since, in practice, this meant that the decision of who was taxable for a particular religion rested in the hands of the selectmen, usually Congregationalists, this system was open to abuse. It was abolished in 1833. The intervening period is sometimes called an &quot;establishment of religion&quot; in Massachusetts.

The Duke of York had required that every community in his new lands of New York and New Jersey support &quot;some&quot; church, but this was more often Dutch Reformed, Quaker, or Presbyterian, than Anglican. Some chose to support more than one church. He also ordained that taxpayers were free, having paid local taxes, to choose their church. The terms for the surrender of New Amsterdam had provided that the Dutch would have the liberty of conscience, and the Duke, as an openly divine-right Catholic, was no friend of Anglicanism. The first Anglican minister in New Jersey arrived in 1698, though Anglicanism was more popular in New York.

Connecticut had a real establishment of religion. Its citizens did not adopt a constitution at the Revolution but rather amended their Charter to remove all references to the British Government. As a result, the Congregational Church continued to be established, and Yale College, at that time a Congregational institution, received grants from the State until Connecticut adopted a constitution in 1818 partly because of this issue.

===Test acts===
The absence of establishment of religion did not necessarily imply that all men were free to hold office. Most colonies had a Test Act, and several states retained them for a short time. This stood in contrast to the federal Constitution, which explicitly prohibits the employment of any religious test for federal office, and which through the Fourteenth Amendment extended this prohibition to the States.

For example, the New Jersey Constitution of 1776 provides the liberty of conscience in much the same language as Massachusetts (similarly forbidding the payment of &quot;taxes, tithes or other payments&quot; contrary to conscience). It then provides:

That there shall be &quot;no establishment&quot; of any one religious sect in this Province, in preference to another; and that &quot;no Protestant inhabitant&quot; of this Colony shall be denied the enjoyment of any civil right, merely on account of his religious principles; but that all persons, professing a belief in the faith of &quot;any Protestant sect&quot;, who shall demean themselves peaceably under the government, as hereby established, shall be capable of being elected into any office of profit or trust, or being a member of either branch of the Legislature, and shall fully and freely enjoy every privilege and immunity, enjoyed by others their fellow-subjects.

This would permit a Test Act but do not require one.

The original charter of the Province of East Jersey had restricted membership in the Assembly to Christians; the Duke of York was fervently Catholic, and the proprietors of Perth Amboy, New Jersey were Scottish Catholic peers. The Province of West Jersey had declared, in 1681, that there should be no religious test for office. An oath had also been imposed on the militia during the French and Indian War requiring them to abjure the pretensions of the Pope, which may or may not have been applied during the Revolution. That law was replaced by 1799.

The Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 provided:

Again, it provided in general that all tax-paying freemen and their sons shall be able to &quot;vote&quot;, and that no &quot;man, &quot;who acknowledges the being of a God&quot;, be justly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on account of his religious sentiments or peculiar mode of religious worship.&quot;

==The U.S. Constitution==

===Article 6===
Article Six of the United States Constitution provides that &quot;no religious test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States&quot;. Before the adoption of the Bill of Rights, this was the only mention of religion in the Constitution.

===The First Amendment===
The first amendment to the Constitution reads, &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.&quot; The two parts, known as the &quot;establishment clause&quot; and the &quot;free exercise clause&quot; respectively, form the textual basis for the Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretations of the &quot;separation of church and state&quot; doctrine. Three central concepts were derived from the 1st Amendment which became America&#x27;s doctrine for church-state separation: no coercion in religious matters, no expectation to support a religion against one&#x27;s will, and religious liberty encompasses all religions. In sum, citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith, and support for religion—financial or physical—must be voluntary, and all religions are equal in the eyes of the law with no special preference or favoritism.

The First Congress&#x27;s deliberations show that its understanding of the separation of church and state differed sharply from that of their contemporaries in Europe. As the 19th-century historian Philip Schaff observed:

The American separation of church and state rests upon respect for the church; the [European anticlerical] separation, on indifference and hatred of the church, and of religion itself... The constitution did not create a nation, nor its religion and institutions. It found them already existing and was framed for the purpose of protecting them under a republican form of government, in a rule of the people, by the people, and for the people.

An August 15, 1789, entry in Madison&#x27;s papers indicates he intended for the establishment clause to prevent the government imposition of religious beliefs on individuals. The entry says: &quot;Mr. Madison said he apprehended the meaning of the words to be, that Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law, nor compel men to worship God in any manner contrary to their conscience.&quot;

Some legal scholars, such as John Baker of LSU, theorize that Madison&#x27;s initial proposed language—that Congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a &quot;national religion&quot;—was rejected by the House, in favor of the more general &quot;religion&quot; in an effort to appease the Anti-Federalists. To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists, the very word &quot;national&quot; was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown. During the debate over the establishment clause, Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts took issue with Madison&#x27;s language regarding whether the government was a national government, or a federal government (in which the states retained their individual sovereignty), which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from the debate.

Following the argument between Madison and Gerry, Representative Samuel Livermore of New Hampshire proposed language stating that &quot;Congress shall make no laws touching religion or the rights of conscience.&quot; This raised an uproar from members, such as Representative Benjamin Huntingdon of Connecticut and Representative Peter Sylvester of New York, who worried the language could be used to harm religious practice.

Others, such as Representative Roger Sherman of Connecticut, believed the clause was unnecessary because the original Constitution gave Congress only stated powers, which did not include establishing a national religion. Anti-Federalists such as Representative Thomas Tucker of South Carolina moved to strike the Establishment Clause completely because it could preempt the religious clauses in the state constitutions, but did not persuade the House of Representatives to drop the clause from the First Amendment.

The Senate went through several more narrowly targeted versions before reaching the contemporary language. One version read, &quot;Congress shall make no law establishing one religious sect or society in preference to others, nor shall freedom of conscience be infringed,&quot; while another read, &quot;Congress shall make no law establishing one particular religious denomination in preference to others.&quot; Ultimately, the Senate rejected the more narrowly targeted language.

At the time of the passage of the Bill of Rights, many states acted in ways that would now be held unconstitutional. All the early official state churches were disestablished by 1833 (Massachusetts), including the Congregationalist establishment in Connecticut. It is commonly accepted that under the doctrine of Incorporation—which uses the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to hold the Bill of Rights applicable to the states—these state churches could not be reestablished today.

Yet the provisions of state constitutions protected religious liberty, particularly the so-called freedom of conscience. During the nineteenth century (and before the incorporation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution through the Fourteenth Amendment), litigants turned to these provisions to challenge Sunday laws (blue laws), bible-reading in schools, and other ostensibly religious regulations.

David Sehat, professor of American Intellectual and Cultural History at Georgia State University, writes that:
===The 14th Amendment===

The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (Amendment XIV) is one of the post-Civil War amendments intended to secure rights for former slaves. It includes the due process and equal protection clauses among others. The amendment introduces the concept of incorporation of all relevant federal rights against the states. While it has not been fully implemented, the doctrine of incorporation has been used to ensure, through the Due Process Clause and Privileges and Immunities Clause, the application of most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights to the states.

The incorporation of the First Amendment establishment clause in the landmark case of &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot; has affected the subsequent interpretation of the separation of church and state in regard to the state governments. Although upholding the state law in that case, which provided for public busing to private religious schools, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment establishment clause was fully applicable to the state governments. A 1990s case involving the application of this principle against the states was &quot;Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet&quot; (1994).

==Supreme Court cases==
Jefferson&#x27;s concept of &quot;separation of church and state&quot; first became a part of Establishment Clause jurisprudence in &quot;Reynolds v. United States&quot;, 98 U.S. 145 (1878). In that case, the court examined the history of religious liberty in the US, determining that while the constitution guarantees religious freedom, &quot;The word &#x27;religion&#x27; is not defined in the Constitution. We must go elsewhere, therefore, to ascertain its meaning, and nowhere more appropriately, we think, than to the history of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted.&quot; The court found that the leaders in advocating and formulating the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty were Madison and Jefferson. Quoting the &quot;separation&quot; paragraph from Jefferson&#x27;s letter to the Danbury Baptists, the court concluded that &quot;coming as this does from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure, it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured.&quot;

The centrality of the &quot;separation&quot; concept to the Religion Clauses of the Constitution was made explicit in &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot;, 330 U.S. 1 (1947), a case dealing with a New Jersey law that allowed government funds to pay for transportation of students to both public and Catholic schools. This was the first case in which the court applied the Establishment Clause to the laws of a state, having interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applying the Bill of Rights to the states as well as the federal legislature. Citing Jefferson, the court concluded that &quot;The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state. That wall must be kept high and impregnable. We could not approve the slightest breach.&quot;

While the decision (with four dissents) upheld the state law allowing the funding of transportation of students to religious schools, the majority opinion (by Justice Hugo Black) and the dissenting opinions (by Justices Wiley Blount Rutledge and Robert H. Jackson) each explicitly stated that the Constitution has erected a &quot;wall between church and state&quot; or a &quot;separation of Church from State&quot;: their disagreement was limited to whether this case of state funding of transportation to religious schools breached that wall. Rutledge, on behalf of the four dissenting justices, took the position that the majority had indeed permitted a violation of the wall of separation in this case: &quot;Neither so high nor so impregnable today as yesterday is the wall raised between church and state by Virginia&#x27;s great statute of religious freedom and the First Amendment, now made applicable to all the states by the Fourteenth.&quot; Writing separately, Jackson argued that &quot;there are no good grounds upon which to support the present legislation. In fact, the undertones of the opinion, advocating a complete and uncompromising separation of Church from State, seem utterly discordant with its conclusion yielding support to their commingling in educational matters.&quot;

In 1962, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of officially sponsored prayer or religious recitations in public schools. In &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot;, 370 U.S. 421 (1962), the Court, by a vote of 6–1, determined it unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools, even when the prayer is non-denominational and students may excuse themselves from participation. (The prayer required by the New York State Board of Regents before the Court&#x27;s decision was: &quot;Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers, and our country. Amen.&quot;) As the Court stated:

The petitioners contend, among other things, that the state laws requiring or permitting use of the Regents&#x27; prayer must be struck down as a violation of the Establishment Clause because that prayer was composed by governmental officials as a part of a governmental program to further religious beliefs. For this reason, petitioners argue, the State&#x27;s use of the Regents&#x27; prayer in its public school system breaches the constitutional wall of separation between Church and State. We agree with that contention, since we think that the constitutional prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religion must at least mean that, in this country, it is no part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by government.

The court noted that it &quot;is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in America.&quot; The lone dissenter, Justice Potter Stewart, objected to the court&#x27;s embrace of the &quot;wall of separation&quot; metaphor: &quot;I think that the Court&#x27;s task, in this as in all areas of constitutional adjudication, is not responsibly aided by the uncritical invocation of metaphors like the &#x27;wall of separation,&#x27; a phrase nowhere to be found in the Constitution.&quot;

In &quot;Epperson v. Arkansas&quot;, 393 U.S. 97 (1968), the Supreme Court considered an Arkansas law that made it a crime &quot;to teach the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals&quot; or &quot;to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches&quot; this theory in any school or university that received public funds. The court&#x27;s opinion, by Justice Abe Fortas, ruled that the Arkansas law violated &quot;the constitutional prohibition of state laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The overriding fact is that Arkansas&#x27; law selects from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes for the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular religious doctrine; that is, with a particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious group.&quot; The court held that the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from advancing any religion, and that &quot;the state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them.&quot;

In &quot;Lemon v. Kurtzman&quot;, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), the court determined that a Pennsylvania state policy of reimbursing the salaries and related costs of teachers of secular subjects in private religious schools violated the Establishment Clause. The court&#x27;s decision argued that the separation of church and state could never be absolute: &quot;Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense. Some relationship between government and religious organizations is inevitable,&quot; the court wrote. &quot;Judicial caveats against entanglement must recognize that the line of separation, far from being a &#x27;wall&#x27;, is a blurred, indistinct, and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship.&quot;

Since that decision, the Supreme Court has applied a three-pronged test to determine whether government action comports with the Establishment Clause, known as the &quot;Lemon Test&quot;. First, the law or policy must have been adopted with a neutral or non-religious purpose. Second, the principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Third, the statute or policy must not result in an &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; of government with religion. (The decision in &quot;Lemon v. Kurtzman&quot; hinged upon the conclusion that the government benefits were flowing disproportionately to Catholic schools, and that Catholic schools were an integral component of the Catholic Church&#x27;s religious mission, thus the policy involved the state in an &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; with religion.) Failure to meet any of these criteria is a proof that the statute or policy in question violates the Establishment Clause.

In 2002, a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that classroom recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in a California public school was unconstitutional, even when students were not compelled to recite it, due to the inclusion of the phrase &quot;under God&quot;. In reaction to the case, &quot;Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow&quot;, both houses of Congress passed measures reaffirming their support for the pledge and condemning the panel&#x27;s ruling. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which overturned the ruling in 2004 on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue. Rather, a five-justice majority held that Newdow, a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter, lacked standing to sue.

When the Louisiana state legislature passed a law requiring public school biology teachers to give Creationism and Evolution equal time in the classroom, the Supreme Court ruled that the law was unconstitutional because it was intended to advance a particular religion, and did not serve the secular purpose of improved scientific education.

The display of the Ten Commandments as part of courthouse displays was considered in a group of cases decided in the summer of 2005, including &quot;McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky&quot; and &quot;Van Orden v. Perry&quot;. While parties on both sides hoped for a reformulation or clarification of the Lemon test, the two rulings ended with narrow 5–4 and opposing decisions, with Justice Stephen Breyer the swing vote.

On December 20, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in the case of ACLU v. Mercer County that the continued display of the Ten Commandments as part of a larger display on American legal traditions in a Kentucky courthouse was allowed, because the purpose of the display (educating the public on American legal traditions) was secular in nature. In the Mount Soledad Cross controversy on May 3, 2006, however, a federal judge ruled that the cross on public property on Mount Soledad must be removed.

In &quot;Town of Greece v. Galloway&quot;, 12-696, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case regarding whether prayers at town meetings, which are allowed, must allow various faiths to lead prayer, or whether the prayers can be predominantly Christian. On May 5, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5–4 in favor of the Town of Greece by holding that the U.S. Constitution not only allows for prayer at government meetings, but also for sectarian prayers like predominantly Christian prayers.

The Supreme Court in &quot;The American Legion v. American Humanist Association&quot; 2019 reversed the Fourth Circuit&#x27;s ruling in a 7–2 decision, determining that since the government-maintained Peace Cross in Bladensburg, Maryland, had stood for decades without controversy, it did not violate the Establishment Clause and could remain standing.

On June 21, 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6–3 vote that the state program that provides tuition to schools should not exclude religious schools and reversed the ban imposed in the state of Maine. Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. said that the issue was the &quot;discrimination against religion&quot; and that the tuition program &quot;promotes stricter separation of church and state than the federal Constitution requires&quot;. The three justices who dissented said that &quot;the decision was another step in dismantling the wall of separation between church and state that the framers fought to build.”

==Early treaties and court decisions==

===The Treaty of Paris===
In 1783, the United States signed a treaty with Great Britain that was promulgated &quot;in the name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity&quot;. It credited &quot;&#x27;Divine Providence&#x27; with having disposed the two parties to &#x27;forget all past misunderstandings,&#x27; and is dated &#x27;in the year of our Lord&#x27; 1783.&quot;

===The Treaty of Tripoli===
In 1797, the United States Senate ratified a treaty with Tripoli that stated in Article 11:

As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of Mussulmen; and, as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions, shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.

Historian Anson Phelps Stokes noted in his 1950 history of this question that &quot;those who wished to deny that the United States as a government has any special regard for the Christian religion...[have ] almost invariably failed to call attention to the fact that the treaty was superseded, less than a decade later, by another &#x27;Treaty of Peace and Amity,&#x27; signed in Tripoli June 4, 1805, in which the clause in question...is omitted.&quot;

===&quot;Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States&quot;===
In the 1892 case &quot;Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States&quot;, Supreme Court Justice David Brewer wrote for a unanimous Court that &quot;no purpose of action against religion can be imputed to any legislation, state or national, because this is a religious people. ... [T]his is a Christian nation.&quot; Legal historian Paul Finkelman writes that: 

==Interpretive controversies==
Since the late 20th century, some scholars and organizations disagree with the way the Supreme Court has interpreted the constitutional limitation on religious establishment. Such critics generally argue that many aspects of church and state were intermingled at the time the Constitution was ratified, and that the framers had a different intention than has developed in the more than 200 years since the constitution was written. These critics note that there were religious references in official contexts, and other founding documents, such as the United States Declaration of Independence, reference the idea of a &quot;Creator&quot; and &quot;Nature&#x27;s God.&quot;

Passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 incorporated recognition that the First Amendment applied to actions by state governments. Many constitutional debates relate to competing interpretive theories of originalism versus modern, progressivist theories such as the doctrine of the Living Constitution. Other debates center on the principle of the law of the land in America being defined not just by the Constitution&#x27;s Supremacy Clause, but also by legal precedents. This says that interpretations of the Constitution are subject to the morals and values of a given era. It is not a question of historical revisionism when discussing the Constitution.
The &quot;religious test&quot; clause has been interpreted to cover both elected and appointed federal officials, career civil servants (a relatively recent innovation), and political appointees. Religious beliefs or the lack of them have not been permissible tests or qualifications with regard to federal employees since the ratification of the Constitution.

Seven states, however, included language in their Bill of Rights or Declaration of Rights, or in the body of their constitutions, that require state office-holders to have particular religious beliefs. Some of these have been successfully challenged in court. These states are Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.

Among the required beliefs is: a Supreme Being and a future state of rewards and punishments. (Tennessee Constitution Article IX, Section 2 is an example of this.) Some of these same states specify that the oath of office include the words &quot;so help me God.&quot; In some cases, these oaths were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court. At one time, such restrictions were allowed under the doctrine of states&#x27; rights. In the early 21st century, they are deemed to be in violation of the federal First Amendment, as applied to the states via the 14th amendment. They are unconstitutional and unenforceable.

Relaxed zoning rules and special parking privileges for churches, the tax-free status of church property, the designation of Christmas as a federal holiday, etc., have also been questioned. These have continued while considered examples of the governmental prerogative in deciding practical and beneficial arrangements for the society. The national motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; has been challenged as a violation, but the Supreme Court has ruled that ceremonial deism is not religious in nature. A circuit court ruling in 2001 affirmed Ohio&#x27;s right to use as its motto a passage from the Bible, &quot;With God, all things are possible&quot;, because it displayed no preference for a particular religion.

Jeffries and Ryan (2001) argue that the modern concept of separation of church and state dates from the mid-twentieth century rulings of the Supreme Court. The central point, they argue, was a constitutional ban against aid to religious schools, followed by a later ban on religious observance in public education. Jeffries and Ryan argue that these two propositions—that public aid should not go to religious schools and that public schools should not be religious—make up the separationist position of the modern Establishment Clause.

Jeffries and Ryan argue that the no-aid position drew support from a coalition of separationist opinion. Most important was &quot;the pervasive secularism that came to dominate American public life,&quot; which sought to confine religion to a private sphere. The ban against government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by most Protestants (and most Jews), who opposed aid to religious schools, which were primarily Catholic at the time.

Originalist critics of the modern concept of the &quot;separation of church and state&quot; argue that it is contrary to the conception of the phrase as the Founding Fathers understood it. But society and the law have changed. In the case of &quot;Locke v. Davey&quot; (2004), briefs before the Supreme Court, including by the U.S. government, argued that some state constitutional amendments relating to the modern conception of separation of church and state (Blaine Amendments) were motivated by and intended to enact anti-Catholicism.

J. Brent Walker, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee, has said: 
&quot;The fact that the separation of church and state has been supported by some who exhibited an anti-Catholic animus or a secularist bent does not impugn the validity of the principle. Champions of religious liberty have argued for the separation of church and state for reasons having nothing to do with anti-Catholicism or desire for a secular culture. Of course, separationists have opposed the Catholic Church when it has sought to tap into the public till to support its parochial schools or to argue for on-campus released time in the public schools. But that principled debate on the issues does not support a charge of religious bigotry&quot;

Steven Waldman says, &quot;The evangelicals [sic, Baptists and Methodists] provided the political muscle for the efforts of Madison and Jefferson, not merely because they wanted to block official churches but because they wanted to keep the spiritual and secular worlds apart.&quot; Frank Lambert wrote
&quot;Religious freedom resulted from an alliance of unlikely partners. New Light evangelicals such as Isaac Bachus and John Leland joined forces with Deists and skeptics such as James Madison and Thomas Jefferson to fight for a complete separation of church and state.&quot;

James Madison was influenced by the struggle of Baptists in Virginia before the Revolution, where young men were jailed for preaching without a license from the Anglican Church. As a young lawyer, Madison defended such men in court. Both Madison and Jefferson incorporated religious freedom into the state constitution of Virginia.

Judge Charles C. Haynes wrote an OpEd in 2013 in &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; saying:

===Politics and religion in the United States===

Robert N. Bellah has written that, although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the U.S. Constitution, this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in U.S. political society. He used the term &quot;civil religion&quot; to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the U.S. His 1967 article analyzes John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural speech: &quot;Considering the separation of church and state, how is a president justified in using the word &#x27;God&#x27; at all? The answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension.&quot;

In 2013, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to retain &quot;In God We Trust&quot; as the official motto of the United States. Only nine members of Congress, eight Democrats and a Republican, voted against the resolution.

A May 2022 study found that the strongest support for declaring the U.S. a Christian nation comes from Republicans who identify as Evangelical or born-again Christians. Of this group, 78% favor formally declaring the U.S. a Christian nation, versus only 48% of Republicans overall. Age is also a factor, with over 70% of Republicans from the Baby Boomer and Silent Generations supporting the United States officially becoming a Christian nation. According to &quot;Politico&quot;, the polling also found that sentiments of white grievance are highly correlated with Christian nationalism: &quot;White respondents who say that members of their race have faced more discrimination than others are most likely to embrace a Christian America. Roughly 59% of all Americans who say white people have been discriminated against ... favor declaring the U.S. a Christian nation, compared to 38% of all Americans.&quot;

Justice Clarence Thomas has disputed that the Establishment Clause applies to the States, believing it constitutional for states to establish a state religion.

In 2013, North Carolina politicians proposed a bill that could have seen North Carolina establish an official religion for the state. A 2013 YouGov poll found that 34% of people favored establishing Christianity as the official state religion in their own state, 47% opposed it, and 19% were undecided.

In June 2022, Representative Lauren Boebert told a church audience, &quot;The church is supposed to direct the government. The government is not supposed to direct the church. That is not how our Founding Fathers intended it. And I am tired of this separation of church and state junk. It&#x27;s not in the Constitution.&quot;

In June 2024, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry signed into law Louisiana House Bill 71, mandating schools that receive public funding to display a copy of the Ten Commandments. Several organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, have sharply criticized this policy, and multiple lawsuits have been filed against the bill.

<doc id="596327" wikidata="Q908959" url="?curid=596327" title="Malabar pied hornbill">
<text>The Malabar pied hornbill (Anthracoceros coronatus), also known as the lesser pied hornbill, is a bird in the hornbill family, a family of tropical near-passerine birds found in the Old World.

==Taxonomy==
The Malabar pied hornbill was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his . The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the , which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Buceros coronatus&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The Malabar pied hornbill is now placed in the genus &quot;Anthracoceros&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1849. The species is monotypic. The generic name combines the Ancient Greek , meaning &quot;coal black&quot; and , meaning &quot;horn&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;coronatus&quot; is Latin for &quot;crowned&quot;.

==Description==
The Malabar pied hornbill is a large hornbill, at in length. It has mainly black plumage, apart from its white belly, throat patch, tail sides and trailing edge to the wings. The bill is yellow with a large, mainly black casque. Females have white orbital skin, which the males lack. Juveniles have no casque. It might be confused with the oriental pied hornbill. They weigh around 1 kg (2.2 pounds).

==Distribution and habitat==
The Malabar pied hornbill is a common resident breeder in India and Sri Lanka. Its habitat is evergreen and moist deciduous forests, often near human settlements. It is distributed across three main regions within the Indian sub-continent: Central and Eastern India, along the Western Ghats, and in Sri Lanka. In Central and Eastern India, it ranges from western West Bengal through parts of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, northern and eastern Maharashtra, northern Andhra Pradesh, and north-east tip of Telangana. Along the Western Ghats, the species is distributed in pockets along the eastern slopes and in the Konkan belt and west coast from western Maharashtra through Goa, western Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and in Kerala. In Sri Lanka, the species occurs mainly in the low country and dry zone forests as well as home gardens. 

==Nature and behaviour==
=== Breeding ===
During incubation, the female lays two or three white eggs in a tree hole, which is blocked off with a cement made of mud, droppings and fruit pulp. There is only one narrow aperture, just big enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and chicks. When the chicks have grown too large for the mother to fit in the nest with them, she breaks out and rebuilds the wall, after which both parents feed the chicks.

=== Food and feeding ===
This species is omnivorous, taking fruits, small mammals, birds, small reptiles, insects etc. Prey is killed and swallowed whole. Figs are an important food, contributing 60% of their diet from May to February, the non-breeding season; during breeding, in March and April, up to 75% of the fruits delivered at the nest were figs. They also feed on other fruits, including those of the &quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot;, which are toxic to many vertebrates.

Great pied hornbills and Malabar pied hornbills are frequently spotted at the township of the Kaiga Atomic Power Station near Karwar. The rich biodiversity in the forest around the plant has become a niche for a wide variety of rare bird species. A study comparing populations over a 23-year period at Dandeli found no significant change.

In central India, tribal peoples believed that hanging a skull of the hornbill (known as &quot;dhanchidiya&quot;) brought wealth.

<doc id="596329" wikidata="Q328802" url="?curid=596329" title="Austin Roberts (zoologist)">
<text>Austin Roberts (3 January 1883 – 5 May 1948) was a South African zoologist. He is best known for his &quot;Birds of South Africa&quot;, first published in 1940. He also studied the mammalian fauna of the region: his work &quot;The mammals of South Africa&quot; was published posthumously in 1951. The 7th edition of &quot;Roberts&#x27; Birds of Southern Africa&quot; which appeared in 2005, is the standard work on the region&#x27;s birds.

==Biography==
Roberts, son of Alfred Roberts (church minister) and Marianne Fannin (naturalist and flower artist), was born in Pretoria and grew up in Potchefstroom, South Africa. He gained much of his early knowledge of zoology from Thomas Ayres (1828–1913), one of South Africa&#x27;s first amateur ornithologists. Ayres taught Roberts to skin birds and small mammals as well as the importance of keeping accurate records on every specimen. He also encouraged Roberts to study birds systematically.

Roberts worked as a clerk in the Potchefstroom branch of Standard Bank from 1901 to 1903 and thereafter in the Department of Inland Revenue in Potchefstroom, Pretoria and Wolmaransstad. In April 1906 he enlisted as a trooper in John Royston&#x27;s irregular regiment during the Bambatha Rebellion in Natal. The unit demobilised in August 1906 and Roberts and his brother, Noel, collected birds eggs and nests which they then presented to the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria. Roberts then worked as a temporary clerk in the Department of Agriculture until December 1907 when he joined the Natal militia as a trooper.

In 1908 he accompanied Frederick V. Kirby on an expedition to Quelimane district in Mozambique to destroy lions for the Boror Company on their coffee and sugar plantations. During this expedition Roberts collected 340 bird skins and several small mammals, which he sold to the Transvaal Museum. After a period of blackwater fever, Roberts was employed by the Transvaal Museum in 1910 as a temporary zoological assistant under J. W. B. Gunning. In 1913 he was given a permanent position and put in charge of the museum&#x27;s bird and mammal collections.

In 1914 he married Dora S. Cooper (née Barrett), with whom he had three sons and a daughter. During World War I (1914-1918) he served in German East Africa and Palestine. He established a collection of over 30 000 birds and 13 000 mammals. These were collected on expeditions to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe, 1914), the Vernay-Lang Kalahari Expedition (1930), the Barlow Expedition to South West Africa (now Namibia).

He remained at the Transvaal Museum for 38 years until 1946, but it seems that his lack of formal education retarded both his professional advancement and recognition. Over the span of his career he described and named 429 bird taxa and 406 mammal taxa. His approach to taxonomy was to create a new genus, species or subspecies based on slight difference, a method he defended vigorously. His new genera were not generally well received by the &quot;systematists&quot; and the majority of the new genera, species and subspecies were not accepted. However, owing to his vast field experience he came to be regarded as the greatest authority on South African birds and mammals.

He was author of several manuscripts and articles in scientific publications, including over a hundred papers in the Annals of the Transvaal Museum, Journal of the South African Ornithologists&#x27; Union and The Ostrich. His book &quot;The birds of South Africa&quot;, illustrated by Norman C.K. Lighton, was the first comprehensive work on the subject. It has been revised and expanded by various experts and several editions published.

Early in 1948 he was offered the post of curator of the Queen Victoria Museum in Harare, but his death on 5 May 1948 in a motor car accident in the Transkei region prevented him from taking up the position. The flowering plants he collected are in the National Herbarium, Pretoria, while his fungi went to the National Collection of Fungi at the Plant Protection Research Institute in Pretoria.

His compilation of a comprehensive book on mammals was more or less completed at the time of his death and subsequently edited by R. Bigalke, V.F. Fitzsimons and D.E. Malan and published as &quot;The mammals of South Africa&quot;, with illustrations by P.J. Smit.

Roberts had also been planning a comprehensive bird book but at the time of his death had only completed the part dealing with sea birds. The work was eventually completed by P.A.R. Hocky, W.R.J. Dean and P.G. Ryan and published as &quot;Roberts birds of Southern Africa&quot;.

<doc id="596330" wikidata="Q57476" url="?curid=596330" title="James Michel">
<text>James Alix Michel, GCSK (born 16 August 1944) is a Seychellois politician who served as the third President of Seychelles from 2004 to 2016. He previously served as vice president under his predecessor, France-Albert René, from 1996 to 2004.

Michel was initially a teacher, but later he became involved in the archipelago&#x27;s booming tourism industry and joined René&#x27;s political party before independence in 1976.

==Life and career==
Michel followed President René through different political posts during all periods of the Seychelles&#x27; history as an independent entity. He was a member of the executive committee of the Seychelles People&#x27;s United Party from 1974 to 1977; subsequently, when the party was transformed into the Seychelles People&#x27;s Progressive Front (SPPF), he became a member of its Central Executive Committee. René staged a coup against the country&#x27;s first President, James Mancham, only one year after independence, and Michel was appointed Minister of Public Administration and Information in June 1977. During the 1979–1991 one-party socialist rule, Michel held various ruling party and ministerial portfolios, such as Minister of Finance from 1989 to 2006. In 1984 he became the SPPF&#x27;s Deputy Secretary-General, and in 1994 he became its secretary-general.

During the rule of President René, Michel held positions with a significant role Seychellois economic policy on several occasions. In these 27 years, the Seychelles experienced a period of economic growth based on its tourism and fishery sectors, which was followed by stagnation in the 1990s. Beginning in 2008, around the time of the Great Recession Michel had presided over a program of macroeconomic reforms in a neoliberal direction, featuring a massive reduction in public budget deficit (‘austerity measures’) and a complete liberalization of foreign exchange transactions.

This was a continuation of move away from the policies adopted during dictatorial rule, yet continuous in seeing the island nation&#x27;s potential as a hub for offshore financial services at advantageous conditions compared to other countries as a means to acquire foreign exchange. This was a policy chosen by many smaller island nations, different than focusing on industrial growth that would be possible to exchange for foreign currency, as well as attract the development of connected services (especially financial services serving local industry and consumers, as well as tourist services utilising industrial products).

Michel played a major potlical role in the country&#x27;s democratisation process, importantlynwith the return of multi-party elections in 1993. However, potlical opponents have maintained Seychelles still suffers from limited freedom and transparency of the press, even raising claims of rigged elections. International observers present during Seychellois elections held since 1993 had declared them to have been “free and fair”. According to official results, President René and his Seychelles People&#x27;s Progressive Front party won presidential and legislative elections in 2001 and 2002 respectively, with about 54% of the vote in both cases.

After retiring from politics in 2016, Michel created the James Michel Foundation to fund and support projects that focus on blue economy and climate change.

===Presidency===

After serving as vice-president for nearly eight years, beginning in August 1996, Michel became president on 14 July 2004, when René stepped down. At that point, Michel was René&#x27;s longest-serving cabinet minister. As President, he held the portfolios of Defence, Police, Information, and Risk &amp; Disaster Management.

Seychelles&#x27; opposition leader, Wavel Ramkalawan, expressed increased concern over the declining trends in the national economy and demanded more dialogue with the ruling party. The leader of the Seychelles National Party furthermore said that he would be cooperating with President Michel.

Michel won the presidential election held on 28–30 July 2006, taking 53.7% of the vote. He was sworn in for his new term on 1 August 2006. Michel won re-election in May 2011, receiving 55.4% of the vote. He was sworn in for his new term of office on 22 May 2011.

In early 2015, Michel confirmed that he planned to run for a third term in the next presidential election. Reflecting on his time in office, he said: &quot;I worked hard, I did everything for Seychelles [and] the Seychellois people and I feel that people appreciate my work.&quot; His term was scheduled to end in 2016, but he announced on 1 October 2015 that the next election would be held a few months earlier. The date was subsequently set for 3–5 December 2015. He very narrowly defeated Ramkalawan in a run-off by a margin of less than 200 votes.

Michel announced on 27 September 2016 that he was resigning, effective 16 October, and handing over power to Vice President Danny Faure, less than a year into his third term. The decision coincided with the election of an opposition majority in the National Assembly in the September 2016 parliamentary election. Michel said that &quot;a new generation of Parti Lepep will take Seychelles to the next frontier of its development&quot; and that he felt &quot;a sense of mission accomplished&quot;.

<doc id="596340" wikidata="Q1818186" url="?curid=596340" title="Brum (TV series)">
<text>Brum is a British children&#x27;s television series about the adventures of a small, sentient vintage car named Brum. The series was originally narrated by Toyah Willcox, who also provided the voice for Brum and all characters. The show aired for three series between 1991 and 2002, with two revived CGI series on YouTube in 2016. The show first aired on BBC1 on the children&#x27;s block, Children&#x27;s BBC, and later on CBeebies.

Set in Birmingham, England (referred to as &quot;Big Town&quot; in the series) and produced by Ragdoll Productions, &quot;Brum&quot; was first broadcast in 1991 and the last live-action series was broadcast in 2002. It was initially directed, written and produced by Anne Wood and initially narrated by Toyah Willcox who also provided the voice for Brum and all the characters in story form. In series 3, all the characters including Brum were silent except for the car noises. Children provided commentary similar to silent film rather than a single narrator who spoke out the dialogue in a third-person story form. A new CGI-animated series, aimed at young pre-school children, was produced in 2016.

==Plot and setting==
&quot;Brum&quot; is the story of a small, sentient replica car named Brum who ventures out into the Big Town when his owner is not looking and gets up to all manner of adventures. Each episode begins and ends in the same way, with Brum leaving the other cars in the motoring museum when the owner&#x27;s back is turned and heading out to explore the Big Town, before eventually returning to his place. Each series has had its own background music. From series 1–2, the introduction music was the same, but in series 2, it used different instruments. From series 3-5, the music became jazzy, and a new title sequence was directed by Nigel P. Harris.

Brum can express himself in various mechanical ways, including opening and closing his doors and bonnet, bobbing his suspension, and flashing and swivelling. The actors in &quot;Brum&quot; do not speak, with mime and off-screen narration used instead to continue the story. It was therefore easy to prepare episodes for airing in other countries, and the series has been broadcast in many parts of the world and in many languages.

The stories are mostly set in the city of Birmingham, England, since in addition to its onomatopoeic nature of a car engine revving, Brum (as a contraction of &quot;Brummagem&quot;) is a common colloquial name for Birmingham City. Although later series make no direct mention of Birmingham, referring to it as Big Town, many of the city&#x27;s streets and landmarks can be seen in each episode.

The show was written by a range of writers. Anne Wood primarily wrote all the first series, while the second was written by Tom Poole, Dirk Campbell, Andrew Davenport and Morgan Hall. The last two series were written by Nigel P. Harris (5 Episodes) and the existing Ragdoll team.

The car itself – a half-scale replica of a late-1920s Austin 7 Chummy convertible – was designed and built by Rex Garrod. It is now housed at the Cotswold Motoring Museum in Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, which is also where the opening and closing sequences of the programme were filmed.

==Characters==
===1990s===
* Museum Owner (Mike Cavanagh): The owner of the car museum where Brum lives. He is the only human character who appears in every episode and the only character who is apparently oblivious to Brum&#x27;s adventures, (except for one where he finds Brum broken down at a junkyard and helps him escape) despite finding items in Brum&#x27;s backseat at the end of each episode in Series 1 and 2.

==Reception==
Deirdre Sheppard of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot;, gave the series three stars out of five, saying, &quot;When watching Brum, expect loud costumes, catchy music, silly dancing, and comedic choreographed coincidences. Since it moves much faster than most kids&#x27; programming, Brum is a good fit for kids with shorter attention spans and for parents who can&#x27;t always stomach the monotony of other kids&#x27; shows. Overall, it&#x27;s a great pick -- just be sure to know when to fill in the gaps!.&quot;

<text>Johann Büttikofer (9 August 1850 – 24 June 1927) was a Swiss zoologist who worked at the Blijdorp Zoological Garden in Rotterdam. After his retirement he settled in Bern, Switzerland. For his extensive contributions to the knowledge of Liberian fauna based on two zoological expeditions to the Republic of Liberia (1879 to 1882 and 1886 to 1887) he is regarded as the &#x27;Father of Liberian Natural History&#x27;.

== Early life ==
Büttikofer was born in Ranflüh (part of Rüderswil, Canton of Bern) in the Emmental where his father Jakob was a school teacher. He attended village school until the age of 16 and then studied French for one year, after which he attended a teacher training college in Hofwil until the age of 20. He taught school in Graswil, Switzerland for six years, hunted, began to learn taxidermy, read travel accounts, and longed to visit the tropics. He left teaching to become a preparator at the Natural History Museum of Bern where he attended lectures by Prof. Theophil Studer, who had just returned from travelling around the world.

==Scientific career==
In 1878, professor Ludwig Rütimeyer of Basel recommended him to become an assistant to Hermann Schlegel, the director of the Royal Museum of Natural History (Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, now Naturalis Biodiversity Center) in Leiden, the Netherlands. He became an understudy of Schlegel, who sought to expand the museum&#x27;s role in understanding animal life in Western Africa. Büttikofer joined Schlegel on a study trip to the major museums of Germany and Austria.

Recognizing Büttikofer&#x27;s capabilities and potential, Schlegel proposed sending him on a six-year expedition to Africa to collect zoological specimens from several largely unexplored forest regions, specifically Liberia, the Ivory Coast, the Gold Coast, Cameroon and Gabon. Liberia was selected as the first destination, principally because the expedition had been offered free transportation on the ships of the Rotterdam trading firm Hendrik Muller &amp; Co. which had several trading factories along the Liberian coast. Two zoological expeditions to Liberia were carried out between November 1879 - April 1882 and November 1886 - June 1887; the great success of the Liberia expeditions, the death of Dr. Schlegel, and Buttikofer&#x27;s own health considerations caused the other initially planned destinations to be dropped.

In 1890 he published a two-volume work, &quot;Reisebilder aus Liberia&quot; in German. This constituted the first monograph on the Republic of Liberia, and contains some of the earliest photographs of nature in Liberia. An annotated English translation of this publication was produced in November, 2012 by Brill (Leiden), titled &quot;Travel Sketches from Liberia: Johann Büttikofer&#x27;s 19th Century Rainforest Explorations in West Africa&quot;, co-edited by Henk Dop and Phillip T. Robinson.

===First expedition===

On the first expedition, Büttikofer was accompanied by a Dutchman, Carolus Franciscus Sala of Leiden, who had previously served in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and had also collected zoological specimens in present-day Angola. Venturing into areas in the lands of the Gola people along the Saint Paul River that had never before been visited by Europeans, Büttikofer and Sala were highly successful in their collecting activities. Among their finds was the first ever complete specimen of the zebra duiker (&quot;Cephalophus zebra&quot;). Suffering from a range of adversities, rapacious local chieftains, malaria and other tropical medical afflictions, Büttikofer and Sala next set up a collecting station at Robertsport. Here, Sala&#x27;s condition worsened, and he died on 10 June 1881 and was buried in a mission cemetery. Büttikofer continued collecting, now in the company of the Liberian hunter Jackson Demery, and also visited the various coastal trading posts in eastern Liberia, until severe ill health forced him to return to Europe.

During a lengthy period of convalescence, Büttikofer wrote an extensive account of his findings, in Dutch, which was published in 1883 in the journal of the Netherlands Royal Geographical Society, whose translated title is: &quot;A Report on Liberia: Results of a Journey of Exploration Undertaken by J. Büttikofer and C. F. Sala in the Years 1879-1882.&quot; When Prof. Schlegel died in 1884, Büttikofer was appointed Curator of Birds.

===Second expedition===

Whereas Büttikofer&#x27;s first expedition was funded by Schlegel, his second was largely financed by himself, on an unpaid leave of absence, with costs to be recuperated by selling specimens to the Leiden museum and others. As a co-worker, he recruited a Swiss boyhood acquaintance and fellow avid hunter, Franz Xaver Stampfli (1847-1903) of Solothurn, Switzerland, who had come to visit him while intending to emigrate to the United States. Stampfli travelled to Liberia in 1884 while Büttikofer continued his recovery. During his stay in the general area of the Junk River, Stampfli discovered an antelope species entirely new to science, the Jentink&#x27;s duiker (&quot;Cephalophus jentinki&quot;), but had to return for convalescence in the spring of 1886.

In November 1886 Büttikofer and Stampfli jointly set out for Liberia. While Büttikofer conducted a journey to Robertsport to collect Jackson Demery to join the expedition, Stampfli set up a collecting station at Schieffelin. After extensive forays in the surrounding area, a second station was set up in Hill Town, which proved to be most successful. Here, the first ever complete specimens of the pygmy hippopotamus (&quot;Choeropsis liberiensis&quot;) were collected. In May 1887, at the expiry of his leave of absence and again suffering from ill-health, Büttikofer returned to Europe while Stampfli continued collecting for another year.

Encouraged by the earlier success of the &quot;Results of a Journey of Exploration&quot;, Büttikofer combined the results of the two expeditions into the two-volume German &quot;Reisebilder aus Liberia&quot; published by E. J. Brill (Leiden) in 1890. To this day, this work stands out as the first comprehensive monograph ever written about the Republic of Liberia, including natural history, geology, agricultural production, ethnography, customs and dress, history, finance, commerce and trade etc.; while also providing highly vivid travel accounts.

Apart from the already mentioned finds, the collected material resulted in the identification of more entirely new species and subspecies of a variety of taxa, for example, Stampfli&#x27;s spot-nosed monkey (&quot;Cercopithecus nictitans stampflii&quot;), the lesser spot-nosed monkey (&quot;Cercopithecus nictitans buettikoferi&quot;), Büttikofer&#x27;s shrew (&quot;Crocidura buettikoferi&quot;), Büttikofer&#x27;s epauletted fruit bat (&quot;Epomops buettikoferi&quot;), and Büttikofer&#x27;s bichir (&quot;Polypterus palmas buettikoferi&quot;). Büttikofer&#x27;s animal specimens are in a number of European museum collections, but principally at the natural history museum in Leiden (Naturalis). Ethnographic artifacts from his work in Liberia, as well as collection of photographs taken during the second expedition, are at the Rijksmuseum Volkenkunde in Leiden (Museum Volkenkunde), the World Museum (Wereldmuseum) in Rotterdam, and at the Historical Museum of Bern in Switzerland.

The &quot;Reisebilder aus Liberia&quot;, as well as the ongoing series of publications based upon his collected specimens, soon established Büttikofer as the unrivalled authority on Liberian fauna. Having maintained close contact with scientific circles in Switzerland, the University of Bern bestowed an honorary doctorate degree (dr. phil. h. c.) upon him in 1895. Around that same year, the Liberian Government awarded him the Liberian Humane Order of African Redemption, which recognizes individuals for assisting the Liberian nation and for playing prominent roles in the &#x27;uplifting of its people&#x27;. Thereafter, when the subject of Liberia came before many scientific groups, the general reaction was reported to be, in essence, &#x27;No need to go to Liberia, for Dr. Büttikofer has thoroughly covered that subject.&#x27; Büttikofer&#x27;s very success may have impeded further zoological work in Liberia for several decades.

===Third expedition===

In 1893-1894 Büttikofer was the official zoologist of the Nieuwenhuis Expedition to central Borneo, organized by Anton Willem Nieuwenhuis, a well-known Dutch explorer. This work resulted in valuable contributions to the knowledge of the wildlife of that region, during which he travelled up the Mandai and Sibau rivers and also ascended Mt. Kenepai and Mt. Liang Koebeng. Several birds, reptiles, and invertebrates from there still bear his name today, including, for example, Büttikofer&#x27;s babbler (&quot;Pellorneum buettikoferi)&quot;, Büttikofer&#x27;s glass lizard (&quot;Dopasia buettikoferi)&quot;, and a skink (&quot;Sphenomorphus buettikoferi)&quot;. At a later date, Büttikofer remarked that working in the East Indies was more like a &quot;holiday journey&quot; in contrast to the difficulties that he had faced in Liberia. 

Between 1897 and 1924, Büttikofer was the Director of the Zoological Garden in Rotterdam. During his long directorship he was associated with some of the main forerunners of nature conservation in The Netherlands. He is best known for his two zoological expeditions to the Republic of Liberia (1879 to 1882 and 1886 to 1887) and resulting publications; from 1897 to 1924 he was the Director of the Blijdorp Zoological Garden in Rotterdam. After his retirement he settled in Bern, Switzerland. For his extensive contributions to the knowledge of Liberian fauna he is regarded as the &#x27;Father of Liberian Natural History&#x27;.

==Nature conservation==
Büttikofer was chairman of the Dutch Society for the Protection of Birds (1909-1924). A small 6 ha ornithological reserve established in his honour in 1926 on the island of Texel in the North Holland province of the Netherlands still bears the name Büttikofer&#x27;s Mieland. This reserve is now part of a complex of larger and smaller terrains referred to as &quot;The low lands of Texel&quot; and managed by the Netherlands Society for the Preservation of Natural Monuments Vereniging Natuurmonumenten.

In 1924 Büttikofer retired and relocated to Bern, Switzerland, residing only a short distance from the natural history museum where he began his highly productive career. He remained active in scientific meetings until he died of pneumonia on June 24, 1927, following a trip to the Dutch East Indies. He was survived by his wife Petronella. Dr. Büttikofer was held in high regard by his European and African colleagues. Some 25 years after his death, G. A. Brouwer noted, in his book on Dutch ornithologists that &quot;he was not merely a friend of animals, but he also had a great sympathy for his fellow man, a characteristic that had already been very useful in Liberia, and was pleasant, convivial and a man of authority, who played a leading role in several societies.&quot;

<doc id="596353" wikidata="Q659029" url="?curid=596353" title="Large Electron–Positron Collider">
<text>The Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP) was one of the largest particle accelerators ever constructed. It was built at CERN, a multi-national centre for research in nuclear and particle physics near Geneva, Switzerland. 

LEP collided electrons with positrons at energies that reached 209 GeV. It was a circular collider with a circumference of 27 kilometres built in a tunnel roughly 100 m (300 ft) underground and passing through Switzerland and France. LEP was used from 1989 until 2000. Around 2001 it was dismantled to make way for the Large Hadron Collider, which re-used the LEP tunnel. To date, LEP is the most powerful accelerator of leptons ever built.

==Collider background==
LEP was a circular lepton collider – the most powerful such ever built. For context, modern colliders can be generally categorized based on their shape (circular or linear) and on what types of particles they accelerate and collide (leptons or hadrons). Leptons are point particles and are relatively light. Because they are point particles, their collisions are clean and amenable to precise measurements; however, because they are light, the collisions cannot reach the same energy that can be achieved with heavier particles. Hadrons are composite particles (composed of quarks) and are relatively heavy; protons, for example, have a mass 2000 times greater than electrons. Because of their higher mass, they can be accelerated to much higher energies, which is the key to directly observing new particles or interactions that are not predicted by currently accepted theories. However, hadron collisions are very messy (there are often many unrelated tracks, for example, and it is not straightforward to determine the energy of the collisions), and therefore more challenging to analyze and less amenable to precision measurements.
The shape of the collider is also important. High energy physics colliders collect particles into bunches, and then collide the bunches together. However, only a very tiny fraction of particles in each bunch actually collide. In circular colliders, these bunches travel around a roughly circular shape in opposite directions and therefore can be collided over and over. This enables a high rate of collisions and facilitates collection of a large amount of data, which is important for precision measurements or for observing very rare decays. However, the energy of the bunches is limited due to losses from synchrotron radiation. In linear colliders, particles move in a straight line and therefore do not suffer from synchrotron radiation, but bunches cannot be re-used and it is therefore more challenging to collect large amounts of data.

As a circular lepton collider, LEP was well suited for precision measurements of the electroweak interaction at energies that were not previously achievable.

==History==
Construction of the LEP was a significant undertaking. Between 1983–1988, it was the largest civil engineering project in Europe.

When the LEP collider started operation in August 1989 it accelerated the electrons and positrons to a total energy of 45 GeV each to enable production of the Z boson, which has a mass of 91 GeV. The accelerator was upgraded later to enable production of a pair of W bosons, each having a mass of 80 GeV. LEP collider energy eventually topped at 209 GeV at the end in 2000. At a Lorentz factor ( = particle energy/rest mass = [104.5 GeV/0.511 MeV]) of over 200,000, LEP still holds the particle accelerator speed record, extremely close to the limiting speed of light. At the end of 2000, LEP was shut down and then dismantled in order to make room in the tunnel for the construction of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

==Operation==
LEP was fed with electrons and positrons delivered by CERN&#x27;s accelerator complex. The particles were generated and initially accelerated by the LEP Pre-Injector, and further accelerated to nearly the speed of light by the Proton Synchrotron and the Super Proton Synchrotron. From there, they were injected into the LEP ring.

As in all ring colliders, the LEP&#x27;s ring consisted of many magnets which forced the charged particles into a circular trajectory (so that they stay inside the ring), RF accelerators which accelerated the particles with radio frequency waves, and quadrupoles that focussed the particle beam (i.e. keep the particles together). The function of the accelerators was to increase the particles&#x27; energies so that heavy particles can be created when the particles collide. When the particles were accelerated to maximum energy (and focused to so-called bunches), an electron and a positron bunch were made to collide with each other at one of the collision points of the detector. When an electron and a positron collide, they annihilate to a virtual particle, either a photon or a Z boson. The virtual particle almost immediately decays into other elementary particles, which are then detected by huge particle detectors.

==Detectors==

The Large Electron–Positron Collider had four detectors, built around the four collision points within underground halls. Each was the size of a small house and was capable of registering the particles by their energy, momentum and charge, thus allowing physicists to infer the particle reaction that had happened and the elementary particles involved. By performing statistical analysis of this data, knowledge about elementary particle physics is gained. The four detectors of LEP were called Aleph, Delphi, Opal, and L3. They were built differently to allow for complementary experiments.

===ALEPH===

ALEPH stands for &quot;Apparatus for LEP pHysics at CERN&quot;. The detector determined the mass of the W-boson and Z-boson to within one part in a thousand. The number of families of particles with light neutrinos was determined to be , which is consistent with the Standard Model value of 3. The running of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) coupling constant was measured at various energies and found to run in accordance with perturbative calculations in QCD.

===DELPHI===

DELPHI stands for &quot;DEtector with Lepton, Photon and Hadron Identification&quot;.

===OPAL===

OPAL stands for &quot;Omni-Purpose Apparatus for LEP&quot;. The name of the experiment was a play on words, as some of the founding members of the scientific collaboration which first proposed the design had previously worked on the JADE detector at DESY in Hamburg. OPAL was a general-purpose detector designed to collect a broad range of data. Its data were used to make high precision measurements of the Z boson lineshape, perform detailed tests of the Standard Model, and place limits on new physics. The detector was dismantled in 2000 to make way for LHC equipment. The lead glass blocks from the OPAL barrel electromagnetic calorimeter are currently being re-used in the large-angle photon veto detectors at the NA62 experiment at CERN.

===L3===

L3 was another LEP experiment. Its enormous octagonal magnet return yoke remained in place in the cavern and became part of the ALICE detector for the LHC.

==Results==
The results of the LEP experiments allowed precise values of many quantities of the Standard Model—most importantly the mass of the Z boson and the W boson (which were discovered in 1983 at an earlier CERN collider, the Proton-Antiproton Collider) to be obtained—and so confirm the Model and put it on a solid basis of empirical data.

==Higgs boson==
Near the end of the scheduled run time, data suggested tantalizing but inconclusive hints that the Higgs particle of a mass around 115 GeV might have been observed, a sort of Holy Grail of current high-energy physics. The run-time was extended for a few months, to no avail. The strength of the signal remained at 1.7 standard deviations which translates to the 91% confidence level, much less than the confidence expected by particle physicists to claim a discovery, and was at the extreme upper edge of the detection range of the experiments with the collected LEP data. There was a proposal to extend the LEP operation by another year in order to seek confirmation, which would have delayed the start of the LHC. However, the decision was made to shut down LEP and progress with the LHC as planned.

For years, this observation was the only hint of a Higgs Boson; subsequent experiments until 2010 at the Tevatron had not been sensitive enough to confirm or refute these hints. Beginning in July 2012, however, the ATLAS and CMS experiments at LHC presented evidence of a Higgs particle around 125 GeV, and strongly excluded the 115 GeV region.

<text>This is a list of known collectible card games. Unless otherwise noted, all dates listed are the North American release date.

This contains games backed by physical cards; computer game equivalents are generally called digital collectible card games and are catalogued at List of digital collectible card games.

==List==

==Collectible common-deck card games==
These card games are very similar to regular CCGs; however, they do not meet the strict definition, because all players use a shared deck, also known as a common deck, similar to Uno. There is little to no interest in collecting the cards.

*Citadel Combat Cards (1992)
*Dino Hunt (Steve Jackson Games) (1996)
*Dragon Storm Game (Black Dragon Press) (1995)
*Nuclear War (Flying Buffalo) (1965)

==Non-collectible customizable card games==
Sometimes referred to as Living Card Games, these games are very similar to CCGs but lack randomness to the purchase and distribution of the cards. Most are sold as complete sets and are therefore not &quot;collectible&quot;. Some of these games were meant to be traditional CCGs with booster packs, but the booster packs were never released.

<text>Karel Johan Gustav Hartlaub (8 November 1814 – 29 November 1900) was a German physician and ornithologist.

Hartlaub was born in Bremen, and studied at Bonn and Berlin before graduating in medicine at Göttingen. In 1840, he began to study and collect exotic birds, which he donated to the Bremen Natural History Museum. He described some of these species for the first time. In 1852, he set up a new journal with Jean Cabanis, the &quot;Journal für Ornithologie&quot;. He wrote with Otto Finsch, &quot;Beitrag zur Fauna Centralpolynesiens: Ornithologie der Viti-, Samoa und Tonga- Inseln&quot;. Halle, H. Schmidt. This 1867 work which has handcoloured lithographs was based on bird specimens collected by Eduard Heinrich Graeffe for Museum Godeffroy.
A number of birds were named for him, including Hartlaub&#x27;s Bustard, Hartlaub&#x27;s Turaco, Hartlaub&#x27;s Duck, and Hartlaub&#x27;s Gull.
