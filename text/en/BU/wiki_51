<text>University College School, also known as UCS, is a private day school in Frognal, Hampstead, London, England. The school was founded in 1830 by University College London and inherited many of that institution&#x27;s progressive and secular views.

The UCS Hampstead Foundation is composed of four main entities:
* &quot;The UCS Pre-Prep&quot; for ages 3 to 7 on the Finchley Road site. This was acquired by UCS in 2003.
* &quot;The Junior Branch&quot;, for boys aged 7 to 11 on the Holly Hill site in Hampstead.
* &quot;The Senior School&quot;, for boys aged 11 to 16 and co-educational for ages 16 to 18 on the Frognal site, which is the largest school site. The main campus and the Great Hall are noted examples of Edwardian architecture. Inside the hall is a Walker pipe organ, used for school concerts, professional recordings and other festivities.
* &quot;The Playing Fields&quot; are situated in Ranulf Road in West Hampstead.

UCS is a member of the Eton Group of twelve independent schools and the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference. It has ties with the Equatorial College School in Uganda.

== History ==
University College School was founded in 1830 as part of University College London and moved to its current location in Hampstead in 1907. Continuing on the long tradition of dissenting academies, the University of London had been inspired by the work of Jeremy Bentham and others to provide opportunities for higher education regardless of religious beliefs.

At the time, only members of the established Church could study at Cambridge and Oxford (the only other two universities in England at the time) while similar religious tests were imposed at the other universities dating from the medieval and renaissance periods present in the rest of the British Isles, namely St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Dublin. Furthermore, the subjects taught at these Ancient Universities during this period, especially at Cambridge and Oxford, were relatively narrow, with classical subjects and divinity dominating.

Several of the founders of the University of London are directly associated with the founding of the school; they include Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux (who appears to be singled out as the ring leader in &quot;A tradition for Freedom&quot;), Lord Auckland (probably George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland), William Bingham Baring, 2nd Baron Ashburton, Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, Henry Hallam, Leonard Horner (The Royal Society of Edinburgh has described UCS as his &#x27;monument&#x27;), James Mill, Viscount Sandon (probably either Dudley Ryder, 1st Earl of Harrowby or Dudley Ryder, 2nd Earl of Harrowby), James Lock, Stephen Lushington D.C.L. M.P., John Smith M.P., and Henry Waymouth.

The first headmaster was Henry Browne, who quickly caused controversy, by publishing a prospectus for the school which appeared to include some type of communal worship. This was replaced with a new version which also stated that the school would not use corporal punishment. The school opened at 16 Gower Street on 1 November 1830 under the name &#x27;The London University School&#x27;. Browne soon resigned from his position and was replaced by John Walker (an assistant master). By February 1831 it had outgrown its quarters, in October 1831, the council of UCL agreed to formally take over the school and it was brought within the walls of the college in 1832, with a joint headmastership of Professors Thomas Hewitt Key and Henry Malden.

The school was never a boarding school, it was one of the first schools to teach modern languages, and sciences, and it was one of the first to abolish corporal punishment. Originally, there were no compulsory subjects and no rigid form system. Most boys learnt Latin and French, and many learnt German (a highly unusual subject to teach at that time). Mathematics, chemistry, Classical Greek and English were also taught. There was no religious teaching. Under the University College London (Transfer) Act 1905 (5 Edw. 7. c. xci), University College London became part of the federal University of London, and the school was created as a separate corporation.

UCS moved to new purpose-built buildings in Frognal in Hampstead in 1907, which were opened by Edward VII with the Archbishop of Canterbury in attendance on 27 July. Kikuchi Dairoku was invited to the first annual prize giving at Frognal where he represented those who had received their prizes at Gower Street. The new school buildings were designed by Arnold Mitchell and built by the Dove Brothers. The main school block has been Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England since May 1974.

Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, opened the Sixth Form Centre (which also houses the Lund Theatre) in 1974. Elizabeth II visited the school in 1980 to celebrate its 150th anniversary and to inaugurate the rebuilt hall, which had been destroyed by fire in 1978. A new library, music school, lecture theatre, computer laboratory, sports hall, geography block, mathematics school and further classrooms were added to the senior school site in 1993 and the Junior Branch buildings were also refurbished, with the addition of an Art &amp; Technology Centre.

In 2006 the Sir Roger Bannister Sports Centre was officially opened by Bannister (himself an Old Gower).

In 2007 a new art, design technology and modern languages building came into use and was formally opened as the Jeremy Bentham building by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester on 22 May 2008. In 2009, girls were admitted into the newly co-educational sixth form for the first time.

The playing fields, situated in West Hampstead, were upgraded between 2017 and 2019, with an overhauled drainage system. 2018 saw the opening of a newly refurbished library, known as the AKO Centre, replacing the older Enav Library.

== Traditions ==
The school motto is &quot;Paulatim Sed Firmiter&quot; (&quot;Slowly but surely&quot;). In 2016, the school updated its school logo to incorporate its widely known name of UCS Hampstead and to include the full motto in its roundel emblem. UCS publishes a termly online newsletter called &quot;The&quot; &quot;Frognal&quot; and a yearly printed magazine called &quot;The Gower&quot; sent to current and past pupils.

The senior school is divided into three sections by age, and each year has a name. Each section is led by a head of section.
* Lower school – entry (year 7) and shell (year 8)
* Middle school – lower remove (year 9), remove (year 10) and upper remove (year 11)
* Upper school – transitus (year 12) and sixth (year 13)

Pupils in the lower school are arranged into houses. In the lower school, there is one form (class) per year in each house. The five houses are: Bannister (black), Bonnington (silver), kendall (blue), MacArthur (green), Seacole (yellow).

Pupils in the middle school and upper school are arranged into demes, each named after a former prominent member of staff. This is similar to a school house. In the middle school, there is one form (class) per year in each deme. In the upper school there are at three form groups per year for each deme. As well as a deme warden (housemaster/housemistress), each deme has deme captains (head of house). Deme, half, and full colours are awarded through an accumulation of academic and extra-curricular achievements. There are regular inter-deme competitions in sport, music, and drama throughout the year. In the middle school, the distinctive school blazer carries a coloured school logo on the breast pocket depicting the pupil&#x27;s deme. There are currently six demes:
* Baxters – blue
* Black Hawkins – yellow
* Evans – black (pink badge) 
* Flooks – green
* Olders – silver
* Underwoods – purple

== Admissions ==
There are five main points of entry for prospective pupils:

* Pre-prep, at age 4, by internal exam and assessment. As of 2019 the pre-prep no longer has a nursery section.
* Junior branch, at age 7, judged by a combination of internal exam and interview. As of 2010, the junior branch no longer operates an 8+ entry point.
* Lower school, at age 11, judged by a combination of internal exam and interview.
* Upper school, at age 16, judged by a cognitive ability exam and interviews. All offers are conditional upon GCSE results. This point of entry is available for girls as well as boys and each year; around 55 new girls are accepted into the school each year.

<text>Ronald Ellwin Evans Jr. (November 10, 1933 – April 7, 1990) was an American electrical engineer, aeronautical engineer, officer and aviator in the United States Navy, and NASA astronaut. As Command Module Pilot on Apollo 17 he was one of the 24 astronauts to fly to the Moon, and one of 12 people to fly to the Moon without landing.

Before becoming an astronaut, Evans graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Kansas and joined the U.S. Navy in 1956. After receiving his naval aviator wings, he served as a fighter pilot and flew combat missions during the Vietnam War. In 1964 he received a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. Achieving the rank of captain, he retired from the Navy in 1976.

Evans was selected as an astronaut by NASA as part of NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966 and made his only spaceflight as command Module pilot aboard Apollo 17 in December 1972, the last crewed mission to the Moon, with Commander Gene Cernan and Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt. During the flight, Evans and five mice orbited the Moon a record 75 times as his two crewmates descended to and explored the surface. He is the last person to orbit the Moon alone and, at 147 hours and 43 minutes, holds the record for the most time spent in lunar orbit. During Apollo 17&#x27;s return flight to Earth, Evans performed an extravehicular activity (EVA) to retrieve film cassettes from the service module. It was the third &quot;deep space&quot; EVA, and is the spacewalk performed at the greatest distance from any planetary body. , it remains one of only three deep space EVAs, all made during the Apollo program&#x27;s J-missions. It was the final spacewalk of the Apollo program.

In 1975, Evans served as backup Command Module Pilot for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project mission. He worked on the development of the Space Shuttle before retiring from NASA in March 1977 to become a coal industry executive. Evans died from a heart attack in 1990, aged 56.

==Early life and education==
Ronald Ellwin Evans was born on November 10, 1933, in St. Francis, Kansas, the son of Clarence Ellwin (Jim) Evans and his wife Marie . He had two younger siblings, Larry Joe Evans and Jay Evans. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout. He attended St Francis Elementary School. His father served in the United States Navy during World War II. Evans started his secondary education at St Francis High School, but only attended for two months before the family moved to Topeka, Kansas to seek medical treatment for his brother Larry, who was diagnosed with liver cancer. Larry died in 1951, and his parents separated. Evans attended Highland Park High School in Topeka, where he served on the Student Council, and was the president of the Science Club. He was a member of the school American football team, and was an All-Conference guard. His other brother, Dale, secured a football scholarship to Kansas State University where he played college football, and later played professionally for the Denver Broncos. Later Dale served two tours of duty in Vietnam with the United States Marine Corps.

Evans decided to study electrical engineering at the University of Kansas. His application was accepted, and he was offered a place starting in September 1951. His family had little money, so in order to pay for his college education he secured a scholarship from the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC). During the fraternities rush week he joined the Sigma Nu fraternity. He earned extra money selling Chesterfield cigarettes, and had a cigarette vending machine installed in the Sigma Nu fraternity house. NROTC training involved a parade for one hour each week, and during the summer break there were midshipman cruises on warships. The first was on the battleship . In his sophomore year there was an introduction to naval aviation at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas. This experience inspired Evans to become a naval aviator. The third year cruise was to Europe on the , a destroyer minelayer. In his junior year he was elected to the Sigma Tau, Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi engineering honor societies. During his final summer break he worked in a glass factory to gain general engineering experience. He graduated with his Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in June 1956.

==Navy==
In a letter dated December 12, 1955, the Navy offered Evans a commission as an ensign and designated him a student aviator. He reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola in February 1956 for basic flight training in the Beechcraft T-34 Mentor, and made his first solo flight on May 21. He then progressed to the more powerful North American T-28 Trojan. His flight training then moved to Naval Outlying Landing Field Barin in Alabama, where student aviators practised landing on an aircraft carrier using an outline painted on the runway in the old North American T-6 Texan (known as the SNJ). Six actual landings were then made on the aircraft carrier . Evans returned to Topeka for Christmas leave. There he met Janet Merle (Jan) Pollom, who worked as a secretary at Forbes Air Force Base, and fell in love with her. On January 4, 1957, he reported to Naval Air Station Memphis, where he was taught instrument flying, culminating in a ground-controlled approach test. He then learned how to fly a jet aircraft, the Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star. In a ceremony on April 12 attended by Pollom, her mother, and Evans&#x27; mother, the chief of the Naval Air Technical Training Command, Rear Admiral Frank P. Akers handed out certificates to Evans&#x27; class designating them as naval aviator. Pollom pinned his aviator wings on his uniform.
Evans became a fighter pilot with Fighter Squadron 142 (VF-142), which was based at Naval Air Station Miramar in California, although it was still aboard the aircraft carrier when he arrived on July 14, 1957, and did not reach Miramar until July 25. The squadron was due to receive the new Vought F8U Crusader fighter, but these had not yet arrived, and in the meantime they flew the old North American FJ-3 Fury. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant (junior grade), and married Pollom at the Westminster Presbyterian Church of Topeka on December 22, 1957. They had two children: a daughter, Jaime Dayle, and a son, Jon.

In January 1959, VF-142 boarded the brand new aircraft carrier , and set off on a cruise of the Western Pacific, which lasted until July 27, 1959. Afterwards, most of VF-142 was posted elsewhere, and Evans was one of the five pilots that remained. They took delivery of new model F8U Crusaders, and were joined by new pilots who had to be trained to fly them. The squadron was then assigned to the aircraft carrier , which departed for a tour of the Western Pacific on May 14, and returned to San Diego on December 15. During the voyage, Evans completed correspondence coursework for promotion to lieutenant, and was promoted to that rank in June. With the completion of back to back deployments, he became a flight instructor for the F8U Crusader with Fighter Squadron 124 (VF-124), but until it moved to Miramar in June, he had to fly the Grumman F9F Cougar, although he was able to fly the F8U Crusader once a week or so to stay familiar with it.
In 1962, Evans entered the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Fellow students there at the time included Robert H. Shumaker, Gene Cernan, Richard F. Gordon Jr., Paul J. Weitz and Jack Lousma. On June 5, 1963, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announced that it would be recruiting a new group of astronauts. Military applications were due by July 15. They were pre-screened by the services, and those that the Navy regarded as qualified were contacted and invited to apply. Evans was on leave in Topeka, and received this notification in the form of a telegram. He submitted the required paperwork on July 6. Cernan, Evans, Gordon and Shumaker were among the 34 finalists that NASA invited to undergo a week of medical and physiological tests at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. Six were eliminated at this point; the remaining 28, including Evans, were invited to come to Houston, Texas for interviews and testing. On October 14, Cernan and Evans were both called out of class to take long distance calls from NASA. For Cernan, it was a call from Deke Slayton, NASA&#x27;s Director of Space Flight Operations, informing that he had been chosen; for Evans, it was one from Al Shepard, informing him that he had not. Evans returned to his studies. The Navy frowned on officers loafing while still drawing pay during the summer break, so the students had to take summer classes. Evans chose to take a course in Russian at the Defense Language Institute at the Presidio of Monterey. He graduated with a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering in 1964.

After two years ashore, Evans rejoined VF-124 to re-qualify for aircraft carrier duty. He was then assigned to Fighter Squadron 51 (VF-51), once again flying the F8U Crusader. The ship was already engaged in a combat tour of the Western Pacific on board the aircraft carrier , an older sister ship of the &quot;Oriskany&quot;, so Evans was flown to Naval Air Station Cubi Point in the Philippines, where he collected an F8U Crusader that had been set aside for him, and flew out to the ship. The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; returned to San Diego in December 1964. Evans was appointed the squadron maintenance officer, a position usually held by a lieutenant commander, and soon after received a spot promotion to that rank.

The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; departed for its next Western Pacific cruise in September 1965, but this was not a normal peacetime cruise; the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was assigned to Dixie Station off the coast of South Vietnam, from whence aircraft carriers launched strikes in support of American and South Vietnamese troops engaged in combat operations in the Vietnam War. During a training exercise, Evans collided with his wingman, Lieutenant Roy E. Miller. Evans had to land at Tan Son Nhut Air Base because his aircraft was too badly damaged to be recovered by an aircraft carrier, and it had to be shipped back to the United States for repairs. It was seen by his wife, who recorded a duet of &quot;Side by Side&quot; with Miller&#x27;s wife, adding to the ribbing Evans received from his shipmates. Within days he was flying combat missions over South Vietnam. Ordnance was in short supply, so in order to inflate the number of sorties flown, aircraft seldom carried full bomb loads. Evans&#x27; aircraft was holed by ground fire.
On September 10, 1965, NASA announced that it was recruiting another group of pilot astronauts. Once again, the Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS) contacted Evans and asked if he wanted to volunteer, which he did. On November 12, a package of forms was received by his wife Jan in San Diego, with a cover letter that explained that BUPERS had recommended Evans to NASA. She contacted Slayton, and explained that Evans was on a deployment in the Western Pacific, and was unlikely to be able to return the forms before the December 1 deadline. Slayton reassured her that this would be taken into consideration. Evans managed to mail the forms on December 7. A few weeks later a letter arrived informing Evans that once again he had made the short list, and was invited to come to Brooks Air Force Base for another round of tests.

&quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was back on Dixie station by January 28, and Evans was flying attack missions against Viet Cong insurgents. On that day, his aircraft suffered an electrical failure and he was left with a bomb under his right wing that he was unable to jettison. This made it too dangerous to attempt a landing on the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;, so he was ordered to proceed to Cam Ranh Air Force Base, Evans skidded on the wet Marston Mat runway and went off its end. The bomb did not explode. Evans was taken to the office of the base commander, where a United States Air Force sergeant handed him orders to proceed to Texas for astronaut selection. Once again, Evans endured the battery of medical and psychological tests, and was chosen as one of the 35 finalists to be interviewed at the Rice Hotel. His temporary duty assignment only covered the tests, but BUPERS extended it to March 5, and then turned down his squadron commander&#x27;s request for a replacement officer. As it happened, Evans did not miss much action, as the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; departed Subic Bay in the Philippines for Sasebo, Japan, on February 17, but it was back on Dixie Station by March 6. Eleven days later, Evans participated in an attack on Viet Cong units that earned him a Navy Commendation Medal. On March 26, he received word that he had been selected for astronaut training. He was one of the nineteen astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966.

Evans completed a seven-month tour of duty flying combat missions. In his Navy service, Evans had logged 2,084 hours of flight time, including 4,600 hours in jet aircraft. He had flown 112 combat missions. In a ceremony on the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;″s flight deck on April 1, he was awarded gold 5/16 inch stars in lieu of his second, third, fourth and fifth Air Medals. He flew his last mission, a combat air patrol, on April 21.

==NASA==
===Support crew===
The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; left Dixie station on April 21, 1966, and returned to San Diego on May 16. Evans preceded it, after taking a mail plane to the Philippines, and then a Military Air Transport Service flight to San Diego, which he reached on April 28. He then took a flight to Houston on May 1. The family remained in San Diego until his daughter Jaime finished her school year in late May. In the meantime Evans and Jan bought a four-bedroom house in El Lago, Texas. It was newly built, with no furniture, and the electricity and telephone still to be connected. The family set out for Houston on June 6, taking four days to make the journey in their Rambler station wagon. As their furniture had not yet arrived, they initially stayed in quarters at Ellington Air Force Base. The family was finally able to move in on July 6. Evans&#x27; Navy Commendation Medal citation was forwarded to NASA, and the medal was presented to him, along with a silver 5/16 inch star in lieu of his sixth Air Medal and gold 5/16 inch stars in lieu of his seventh and eighth, by Robert Gilruth, the director of NASA&#x27;s Manned Spacecraft Center.
In earlier astronaut groups, the senior astronaut had assumed the role of command module pilot (CMP) while the more junior was the lunar module pilot (LMP), but the Nineteen were divided into Command/Service Module (CSM) and Lunar Module (LM) specialists. Slayton asked each of the Nineteen which speciality he preferred, but made the final decision himself. This early division of assignments would have a profound effect on their subsequent careers. Evans became a CSM specialist. He was chosen as a member of the support crew for Apollo 1, the first crewed Project Apollo mission, along with Ed Givens and Jack Swigert, two fellow members of his astronaut group. The astronauts assigned to this duty regarded it as the lowest rung on the ladder. Usually low in seniority, they assembled the mission&#x27;s rules, flight plan, and checklists, and kept them updated, and worked in the simulators developing procedures, especially those for emergency situations. They also stood by during spacecraft tests on the launch pad, and set up the cockpit, ensuring that all the switches were in the right positions. In this role, Evans worked inside the Apollo spacecraft for a couple of hours on January 26, 1967. The support crew then flew back to Houston. On landing at Ellington Air Force Base they were informed that the prime crew had died in a fire inside the spacecraft.

When planning for Apollo missions resumed, Evans, Givens and Swigert were assigned to the support crew of Apollo 7, which would now be the first crewed flight. Givens was killed in a motor vehicle accident on June 6, 1967, and was replaced on the support crew by Bill Pogue. Evans was subsequently a member of the support crew for Apollo 11, the first Moon landing, and he was a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for Apollo 7, Apollo 11 and Apollo 14.

===Backup crew===
Under the rotation scheme developed by Slayton, the role of backup commander (CDR) for Apollo 13 would have been John Young, the CMP of Apollo 10, and that of Apollo 14 would have been the CMP of Apollo 11, Michael Collins. They would then become the prime crew CDRs of Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 respectively. However, Cernan baulked at reprising his role as LMP with Young, holding out for his own mission. This became available when Collins declined the opportunity to lead a mission to the Moon. Cernan was therefore selected as backup CDR of Apollo 14 in his stead. This was fortunate for Evans as well; Slayton consulted with Cernan about the selection of the rest of his Apollo 14 backup crew, and they chose Evans as CMP and Joe Engle as LMP. The prime crew for Apollo 14 would be Alan Shepard, the Chief of the Astronaut Office as CDR, Edgar Mitchell as LMP and Stu Roosa as CMP. Evans&#x27; selection as a member of the Apollo 14 backup crew was formally announced by NASA on August 6, 1969. He was still a serving naval officer, and on October 1, 1969, was promoted to commander.
That the backup crew of Apollo 14 would in due course become the prime crew of Apollo 17 as per the rotation scheme was far from certain. The absence of science astronauts on the prime or backup crews of Apollo 13 and Apollo 14 caused adverse reaction in the media, and there was pressure from the scientific community to send a scientist to the Moon. When Slayton announced the crew for Apollo 15 on March 26, 1970, geologist astronaut Harrison Schmitt was named as backup LMP, with Vance Brand as backup CMP and Richard Gordon as backup CDR. Under the rotation scheme, they could expect to become the prime crew for Apollo 18.

When Apollo 18 was cancelled in September 1970, the scientific community pressed NASA to assign Schmitt, a geologist, to Apollo 17 rather than a pilot with non-professional geological training. This left Slayton with the question of who would fill the two other Apollo 17 slots: the rest of the Apollo 15 backup crew or the Apollo 14 backup crew (except for Engle). Gordon&#x27;s crew&#x27;s experience as backup to Apollo 15 was more relevant for the proposed Apollo 17 mission, as Apollo 15 was a similar J-class mission using the Extended Lunar Module, capable of three-day stays on the Moon, and carrying the Lunar Roving Vehicle. Nor was support for assigning Cernan to Apollo 17 unanimous within NASA; Tom Stafford, the acting chief of the Astronaut office with Shepard assigned to Apollo 14, strongly supported Cernan, with whom he had flown on Gemini 9A and Apollo 10, as did Shepard; but Gordon was supported by James McDivitt, the manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, and Pete Conrad, who had been Gordon&#x27;s CDR on Apollo 12. Cernan crashed a Bell 47G helicopter into the Indian River near Cape Canaveral during a training exercise in January 1971; the accident was attributed to pilot error, as Cernan had misjudged his altitude before crashing into the water. Slayton dismissed concerns about Cernan&#x27;s judgment. After being offered command of the mission, Cernan objected to Engle&#x27;s omission from the crew, but acquiesced when it became clear that Schmitt would fly on Apollo 17 with or without Cernan. The fate of the CMP was tied to that of his CDR.

The prime crew of Apollo 17 was publicly announced on August 13, 1971. The original backup crew for Apollo 17, announced at the same time, was the crew of Apollo 15: David Scott as CDR, Alfred Worden as CMP and James Irwin as LMP; but they were removed because of their roles in the Apollo 15 postal covers incident. On May 23, 1972, they were replaced with Young and Duke from the crew of Apollo 16, as backup CDR and LMP respectively, and Roosa from the Apollo 14 crew as backup CMP. Thus, Evans served as Roosa&#x27;s backup on Apollo 14, and Roosa as Evans&#x27; backup on Apollo 17. The two men studied geology with Farouk El-Baz, often on their own time. They became close friends. They would talk about the Moon and the mission at length, and often end with a few beers. Their training was directed at developing the ability to make observations and take photographs of features from orbit. They would fly over geological features in NASA Northrop T-38 Talon jets and tape record their observations and take photographs. These would then be critiqued by geologists. Farouk sometimes flew with Evans or Roosa in the T-38s or small United States Geological Survey aircraft.

===Prime crew===

While suited up for the Apollo 17 mission, but before his helmet was attached, Evans smoked a last cigarette. His crewmates had urged him to quit, and Schmitt suggested that he could take advantage of the two-week mission to go cold turkey. An estimated 700,000 people watched the night launch from the Kennedy Space Center, the largest crowd of spectators since Apollo 11. The flight plan kept Evans busy, making him so tired he overslept one morning by an hour, despite the efforts of Mission Control to awaken him. Before the LM departed for the lunar surface, he had discovered that he had misplaced his pair of scissors, necessary to open food packets. Cernan and Schmitt lent him one of theirs. While Cernan and Schmitt landed on the Moon and explored the Taurus–Littrow valley, Evans remained in lunar orbit on board the Command Module &quot;America&quot;, completing assigned work tasks which required visual geological observations, hand-held photography of specific targets, and the control of cameras and other highly sophisticated scientific equipment carried in the service module&#x27;s SIM bay. Cernan and Schmitt referred to Evans as &quot;Captain America&quot;, after the comic book character.

The orbit of the CSM having been modified to an elliptical orbit in preparation for the LM&#x27;s departure and eventual descent, one of Evans&#x27; first solo tasks in the CSM was to circularize its orbit such that the CSM would remain at approximately the same distance above the surface throughout its orbit. Thereafter, he observed ten visual targets that had been assigned prior to launch, all of which were successfully identified during the course of the mission. He focused on surface features as well as the solar corona at &quot;sunrise,&quot; or the period of time during which the CSM would pass from the darkened portion of the Moon to the illuminated portion when the Moon itself mostly obscured the sun. To photograph portions of the surface that were not illuminated by the sun while Evans passed over them, Evans relied in conjunction on exposure and Earthlight. Evans photographed such features as the craters Eratosthenes and Copernicus, as well as the vicinity of Mare Orientale, using this technique. According to the Apollo 17 Mission Report, Evans was able to capture all scientific photographic targets, as well as some other targets of interest.
The instruments in the SIM bay functioned without significant hindrance during the orbital portion of the mission, though the two antennas of the lunar sounder as well as the mapping camera encountered minor issues. The indicator on the instrument panel for the extension of one of the sounder&#x27;s antennas was not functional and the second antenna suffered an apparent stall during its extension. Despite these technical difficulties, both antennas were deployed fully and the sounder achieved its planned observational purpose. Similarly, the extension and retraction of the mapping camera took longer than planned (about four minutes, longer than the nominal two) and, though deployment and retraction was not otherwise hindered, the use of this piece of equipment was reduced to avoid exhausting it by overuse.

Evans was also responsible for piloting the CSM during the orbital phase of the mission, maneuvering the spacecraft to alter and maintain its orbital trajectory. In addition to the initial orbital recircularization maneuver shortly after the LM&#x27;s departure, one of the final significant solo activities Evans performed in the CSM in preparation for the return of his crewmates from the lunar surface was the plane change maneuver. This maneuver was meant to align the CSM&#x27;s trajectory to the eventual trajectory of the LM to facilitate rendezvous in orbit. Evans fired the SPS engine of the CSM for about 20 seconds in successfully adjusting the CSM&#x27;s orbital plane. He holds the record of most time spent in lunar orbit: 147 hours, 43 minutes and 37.11 seconds.
On the way back to Earth, Evans completed a one-hour, five-minute, 44-second extravehicular activity, during which he made three trips to the scientific instrument module (SIM) bay to retrieve lunar sounder film, the panoramic camera, and three camera mapping cassettes, and completed a personal inspection of the equipment bay area. For this Evans donned Cernan&#x27;s lunar visor assembly with its red stripe, and the top part of his lunar backpack. He set up the movie camera and TV camera to record the EVA, allowing it to be televised live. After a flight of 301 hours, 51 minutes and 59 seconds, &quot;America&quot; splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, where it was retrieved by the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;. To the dismay of his Apollo 17 crewmates, the first thing that Evans did when he got on board was ask one of the crew for a cigarette.

Astronauts normally received a spot promotion on the successful completion of a mission; Evans&#x27; promotion to captain was made official in January 1973. He received his Navy astronaut wings from John Warner, the United States Secretary of the Navy. The Apollo 17 crew were fêted at parties and receptions. They were driven around the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at Super Bowl VII, they met Elvis Presley in Las Vegas and were hosted by President Richard Nixon at the White House and Camp David. Cernan and Evans refused to meet with Muhammad Ali because of the boxer&#x27;s 1967 refusal to serve in the U.S. armed forces, but accepted hospitality from Frank Sinatra.
Evans was later backup CMP for the 1975 Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) mission. The Russian he had learned years before came in handy, but was limited. Asked to give a speech at a cosmonauts&#x27; dinner event, he recited Humpty Dumpty in Russian, which his hosts found hilarious. Evans retired from the U.S. Navy as captain on April 30, 1976, with 21 years of service, but remained active as a NASA astronaut involved in the development of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program. He served as a member of the operations and training group within the Astronaut Office, responsible for launch and ascent phases of the Space Shuttle program. He retired from NASA on March 8, 1977.

==Later years==
Jan&#x27;s parents had retired to live in Sun City, Arizona, and Jan was eager to move to nearby Scottsdale, Arizona, so Evans looked for a job there. A chance encounter led to an offer to become the director of marketing at the Scottsdale-based Western America Energy Corporation. Evans soon became disillusioned with the company and the industry and quit. He then found a position with Sperry Flight Systems, which made electronic components and cockpit instrumentation for the Space Shuttle, as its Director of Space Systems Marketing. But the president of the company who had brought him in died, and Evans had a falling out with his successor. He left to form his own consulting company, and formed a lucrative partnership with a Japanese entrepreneur who was building a theme park devoted to space exploration.

Evans died in his sleep of a heart attack at his home in Scottsdale on April 7, 1990, at the age of 56. He was buried at the Valley Presbyterian Church Memorial Garden in Paradise Valley, Arizona, where Jan would leave a red rose on the anniversaries of his birth, marriage, spaceflight and death.

==Awards and honors==
Evans was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1973, the Johnson Space Center Superior Achievement Award in 1970, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal in 1973, Navy Astronaut Wings, eight Air Medals, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the Navy Commendation Medal with combat distinguishing service. He received a University of Kansas Distinguished Service Citation in 1973, and was named Kansan of the Year in 1972. He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983, and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame on October 4, 1997.

<text>Goodwill ambassador is a post-nominal honorific title, a professional occupation and/or authoritative designation that is assigned to a person who advocates for a specific cause or global issue on the basis of their notability such as a public figure, advocate or an authoritative expert. Sometimes the role of a goodwill ambassador is presented as &quot;Ambassador&quot; or &quot;Goodwill Ambassador&quot; preceding the first and last name, the titled name of the individual is always presented with an organizational, regional or national affiliation. Goodwill ambassadors generally deliver goodwill by promoting ideals or positions from one entity to another, or to a population to establish a benevolent relationship. A goodwill ambassador may be an individual from one country who resides in or travels to another country on a diplomatic mission (or international friendship mission) at a peer to peer level. This can be country to country, state to state, city to city, or as an intermediate emissary representative of the people of a specific organization or cultural group, such as an indigenous tribe, marginalized people or enclave population. 

== Introduction ==
Goodwill ambassadors have been a part of governments, institutions and countries for as long as diplomacy has existed. They represent their constituents by traveling abroad exchanging or delivering gifts and presents while bringing awareness to their cause or purpose through public relations activities and organizing events. Goodwill ambassadors are responsible for delivering humanitarian relief, implementing social welfare programs and providing development assistance to demonstrate benevolence and compassion between parties. Most often nation-states, international and non-governmental organizations use well-known celebrities such as actors, actresses, musicians, scientists, authors, former politicians and other high society figures; but they also engage civilians, professionals and government officials to fulfill the role.

Goodwill missions of US states and international nations are usually carried out or overseen by the head of state, but do not necessarily involve official diplomatic credentials beyond a letter of presentation, letters patent, or a letter of credence. It is very rare that a goodwill ambassador is ever issued a diplomatic passport. However, some countries, such as Haiti and Saint Lucia do issue credentials that include diplomatic immunity for goodwill ambassadors and organizations sometimes issue a civil service officer credential or international identification travel document such as a laissez-passer.

Recognition as an authority is designated by an official document that entitles the subject to the use of the honorable title or can be developed over time through social media or public relations. The title is closely associated with the personal name, such as (Angelina Jolie, Goodwill Ambassador) or (Angelina Jolie, UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador) or (Goodwill Ambassador Angelina Jolie). Any regional, state, nation or body politic has the authority to officially designate goodwill ambassadors.

== History ==

Many say the first ambassador of &quot;good-will&quot; was Ambassador Benjamin Franklin on his mission to France in December 1776, when the United States was just a few months old and embroiled in the Revolutionary War. Others might say it was pioneer Daniel Boone who was hired as a civilian colonel to help Col. Judge Richard Henderson build the Wilderness Road and negotiate with good-will the Treaty of Watauga with the Cherokee to establish the Transylvania Colony on May 23, 1775. At its time, the Transylvania Colony was the first democratic government free of British Monarchy calling for a &quot;manly government&quot;, Boonesborough had both indigenous and free slaves as civil participants.

Benjamin Franklin in colonial times was also known as Silence &quot;Dogood&quot; (a pen name) who wrote a series of letters that were published and widely read. Almost 50 years before the American Revolution Franklin adapted; &quot;Bonifacius: Essays to Do Good&quot;, by the Puritan preacher and family friend Cotton Mather, which Franklin often cited as a key influence throughout his life. His work preached the importance of forming voluntary associations to benefit society. While Franklin learned about forming do-good associations from Cotton Mather, his benevolence, humility and organizational skills made him the most influential force in making voluntarism an enduring part of the American ethos.

=== New understanding ===
The word &quot;good-will&quot; first appears in American newspapers as early as 1789 in the Gazette of the United-States where the term was associated synonymously with words like benevolence, charity, compassion, delight, divinity, grace, honor, humanity, humility, mankind and virtue all in a single thought.

The term &quot;ambassador of good-will&quot; appears in 1920 discussing a delegation of government supported business people from Texas visiting Mexico and establishing friendly business relationships. The article called for &quot;increasing the ranks of ambassadors of good-will&quot; by inviting other businesses and states to their commission. The term &quot;goodwill ambassador&quot; finally emerges into the international landscape as a highly defining and descriptive term in the early 20th Century through a public figure who later proves to be a controversial one. In December 1927 it was applied to aviator and ambassador, Col. Charles Lindbergh by the international news media when he scheduled an International Goodwill Tour visiting Mexico, Central America, Colombia and Venezuela in the Spirit of St. Louis.

The idea was effectively merged from the public domain creating the new term in an article from the Indianapolis Times; &quot;Doll Ambassadors from Japan Viewed by Capital: School Children&#x27;s Babies Enter U.S. on Mission of Good Will; Washington, December 20, 1927 - Japan&#x27;s &quot;Doll Ambassadors of Goodwill&quot; received a national welcome...&quot; In subsequent years the idea is used by its commissioners to create an honorary ex-officio civilian post or use the role of goodwill ambassador as an actual representative substitute for the honorary duty of an iconic historical figure, like the Kentucky Colonel. In the 1930s the Kentucky and Tennessee Colonel titles were awarded to people that would make goodwill ambassadors (ambassadors of goodwill) for the state. Elvis Presley, well known as a Goodwill Ambassador for many causes and ideas, was both a Kentucky and Tennessee Colonel, receiving commissions from various governors.

The United States, the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, Latin America, African Nations were all engaged in commissioning goodwill ambassadors to address public relations issues, create soft power, or promote cultural understanding selecting high profile celebrities that are popular within their own society during and after World War II. The entertainers in the USO were all considered to be Goodwill Ambassadors of the United States.

=== Unrelated uses ===
In the 1980s, the Harlem Globetrotters were sometimes known as America&#x27;s Goodwill Ambassadors especially when performing exposition basketball internationally. In 1998 they registered GOODWILL AMBASSADORS ® under Serial Number #75258888 – with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in the category of education and entertainment services. Based on Harlem Globetrotters International statement the trademark is used in &quot;basketball clinics and exhibitions; and conducting speeches, seminars, and workshops relating to personal awareness, achievement, and motivation.&quot; Essentially their trademark blocks anyone in the United States from offering educational or entertainment services using the term [Goodwill Ambassadors].

Unofficially there were the goodwill ambassadors all over the United States with the hosts/hostesses of the Welcome Wagon in the 1960s, 70s and 80s who welcomed new residents with a promotional gift bag, a service provider directory and advertisers coupons from local merchants; section 293.357-018 of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles lists this type of work for the role of a &quot;GOODWILL AMBASSADOR&quot; today. These concessions were often franchised to a local provider in most main-street towns, the person in charge was most informally called or became known as the &quot;goodwill ambassador&quot; of the town. DOT 293.357-018 - GOODWILL AMBASSADOR: Promotes goodwill and solicits trade for local business firms who are members of parent organization: Develops list of prospective clients from such sources as newspaper items, utility companies&#x27; records, and local merchants. Visits homes of new residents, prospective parents, recently married couples, engaged persons, and other prospects to explain and sell services available from local merchants. Usually presents token gifts or gift certificates to induce clients to use local services or purchase local merchandise. Prepares reports of services rendered and visits made for parent organization and member firms. May solicit new organization membership. May explain community services available. May organize clubs and plan parties for new residents.

== United Nations Goodwill Ambassadors ==
According to the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld Library; &quot;United Nations Goodwill Ambassadors and Messengers of Peace are distinguished individuals, carefully selected from the fields of art, literature, science, entertainment, sports or other fields of public life, who have agreed to help focus worldwide attention on the work of the United Nations. Backed by the highest honor bestowed by the Secretary-General on a global citizen, these prominent personalities volunteer their time, talent and passion to raise awareness of United Nations efforts to improve the lives of billions of people everywhere .. on the other hand, [goodwill ambassadors] are designated by the heads of United Nations Funds, Programmes and specialized Agencies, e.g., UNICEF, the World Food Programme (WFP) and UNHCR. Goodwill Ambassadors are subsequently endorsed by the Secretary-General. .. In 2010, in response to a General Assembly request to mark the International Year of Biodiversity, for the first time the Secretary-General appointed a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador.&quot;

The United Nations agencies appoint and employ popular celebrities to advocate their missions, including the FAO, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNEP, UNFPA, UNODC, UNICEF, UNHCR, UNIDO, UNESCO, the WFP, the WHO, UN Women, the OHCHR, UN-Habitat, and the IMO; all have or may have goodwill ambassadors who are appointed officially by the UN. The largest of these United Nations programs is UNICEF which has over three hundred (300) ambassadors around the world designated by country or region. The United Nations began using goodwill ambassadors officially to promote their missions in 1954, the first was actor Danny Kaye.

The most famous of today&#x27;s contemporary goodwill ambassadors is Angelina Jolie, who currently serves professionally as a special envoy to the UNHCR and is legally recognized as &quot;Ambassador Angelina Jolie&quot; in being addressed &quot;Her Excellency Angelina Jolie,&quot; whereas most other UN goodwill ambassadors are recognized as &quot;Honorable&quot;, and use post-nominal titles that are assigned to them.

=== UN goodwill ambassadors (official titles) ===
In 2020 and 2021 the United Nations began incorporating official standardized titles of authority for credentials, news releases, their websites and semantically on Wikipedia using the initials of each of the specialized agencies of the United Nations followed by the title &quot;Goodwill Ambassador&quot; or the title/term &quot;Advocate&quot; like it did for the SDG Advocates.

Collectively they are all United Nations goodwill ambassadors, each however is designated with a legal title by each individual agency such as:

* FAO Goodwill Ambassador, official title of a goodwill ambassador advocating for the Food and Agricultural Organization
* ILO Goodwill Ambassador, public figure or advocate of the International Labour Organization
* IMO Goodwill Ambassador, or &quot;Goodwill Maritime Ambassador&quot;, is an expert or advocate of the International Maritime Organization
* IOM Goodwill Ambassador, strategic ally promoting the mandate of the International Organization on Migration
*MP Goodwill Ambassador, Mountain Partnership nominates well-known personalities to champion the cause of sustainable mountain development
* Stop TB Goodwill Ambassador, advocate for the UN Special Envoy of the UN Partnership to Stop Tuberculosis 
* UN-Habitat Goodwill Ambassador, advocate of United Nations Habitat commission (urban sustainability)
* UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, celebrity advocate for UN Women (UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women)
* UNAIDS Goodwill Ambassador, celebrity advocate of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)
* UNDP Goodwill Ambassador, prominent individual that serves the mission of the United Nations Development Programme
* UNEP Goodwill Ambassador, public figure or advocate of the United Nations Environmental Programme
* UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, public figure that advocates for UNESCO
* UNFPA Goodwill Ambassador, celebrity advocate of the United Nations Population Fund mission

* UNODC Goodwill Ambassador, celebrity advocate of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
* WFP Goodwill Ambassador, public figure or advocate of the United Nations World Food Programme
* WHO Goodwill Ambassador, a celebrity advocate of the World Health Organization
There are other official title designations and forms of presentation that are used by the United Nations depending on the scope of their public relations campaigns, for example in 2021 the term &quot;UNICEF&#x27;s women Goodwill Ambassadors&quot; appeared for a UNICEF campaign headline for Afghanistan, however this does not change the official title of individual ambassadors. Since 1999, some of the United Nations Diplomatic Corps and United Nations Association Chapters have referred to their ambassadors as Global Goodwill Ambassador or National Goodwill Ambassador of _________. The new guideline of a 3-6 letter alpha code preceding the &quot;Goodwill Ambassador&quot; title makes each ambassador unique with their proper name, disambiguates different UN departments, projects and programs as well as removes assumptions that fraudsters depend on.

== National goodwill ambassadors ==
Most governments and kingdoms (jurisdictions) have ambassadors of goodwill that are either appointed or known implicitly which promote the objectives and values of a country, nation, state, government or monarchy without promoting political agendas or any official state business. Sometimes &quot;goodwill ambassadors&quot; are created from other ideas that represent, that are positive to social well-being and the general prosperity of a state or nation. The winners of the United States Medal of Freedom are all considered to be goodwill ambassadors for the United States for their lifetime and into history. Being an ambassador of goodwill traditionally includes most individuals competing for a title when a place or organization name is attached, such as winners of prominent scholarships, beauty contests, competitive events and pageants like Miss America, Miss USA, Mister World, Miss Universe, and many others use &quot;goodwill ambassador&quot; as part of their job description.

National goodwill ambassadors are not necessarily celebrities, but are usually very well known on a national scale often within a particular industry for a given period of time. Organizations often use destinations and place names to represent elements, identity, methods, values and virtues of goodwill ambassadorship, however their practice is most often based in public diplomacy, citizen diplomacy or international cooperation.

Official goodwill ambassador representatives of a country, state or nation are designated by the president, prime minister, chancellor, the secretary of state or the head of a cabinet. Governments of countries often recognize the spouse of a president, governor, prime minister or a monarch as goodwill ambassadors such as the First-Lady of the United States, Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh for the British Empire, and in the Caribbean country of Belize there is the Special Envoy for Women and Children, all are formally recognized or known as national goodwill ambassadors.

=== United States ===
The United States government does not have a formal, active or organized goodwill ambassador program, but it does have many high-profile public figures that have been recognized with the United States Goodwill Ambassador title as individuals. The US periodically organizes official &quot;goodwill ambassador tours&quot; and also has a number of agencies that assign the title to selected individuals based on talent, expertise and popularity. Some of the more notable U.S. goodwill ambassadors include Jesse Owens, Kirk Douglas, Lefty Gomez, and Pearl Bailey. The United States also designates particular individuals for roles as emissaries abroad when traveling for a special event supported by the U.S., to deliver foreign aid, participate in a conference or to meet a head-of-state such as the appointment of Jillian “JJ” Simmons United States Goodwill Ambassador to the Republic of the Gambia in 2014. Senators and members of the U.S. Congress also have the authority to designate goodwill ambassadors and representatives of USAID are also known as goodwill ambassadors.

In 1956, the US State Department created the Jazz Ambassadors program, hiring leading American jazz musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Goodman, and Duke Ellington to be &quot;ambassadors&quot; for the United States overseas, particularly to improve the public image of the US in the light of criticism from the Soviet Union around racial inequality and racial tension.

=== Saint Lucia ===
Appointments in the Caribbean nation of Saint Lucia are very official with an international goodwill ambassador diplomatic corps of the most well-known citizens under the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Creative Industries; the title of Goodwill Ambassador is conveyed by the president on the behalf of the sovereign nation. In 2020, Minister Fortuna Belrose stated that those selected for the Saint Lucia Goodwill Ambassador Program will be addressed as &quot;Your Excellency&quot; and receive a goodwill ambassador credential from the government that they can use when traveling, the term of their office will be three years. Separately the Ministry of Tourism maintains a Saint Lucia brand ambassador program for local hospitality tourism which is also aimed to create good-will for the country.

=== Japan ===
In 2008 Japan adopted the cartoon character Hello Kitty as their official goodwill tourism ambassador to China and Hong Kong.

=== Republic of Kosovo ===
Honorary Ambassador of the Republic of Kosovo is a title given to foreign citizens and citizens originating from Kosovo, who have contributed to the national interest of country and use their fame, the award is provided as a state decoration.

==INGO and NGO goodwill ambassadors==
A wide range of organizations employ goodwill ambassadors to promote their programs and reach out to others based on goodwill relations and benevolence. There are supra governmental organizations such as the African Union and the European Union and international non-governmental organizations like the IUCN and the IOM. Goodwill ambassadors are also used by social and civil society organizations such as Rotary International, the Olympic Games and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.

=== Amnesty International ===
The Ambassador of Conscience Award is Amnesty International&#x27;s most prestigious human rights award. It celebrates individuals and groups who have furthered the cause of human rights by showing exceptional courage standing up to injustice and who have used their talents to inspire others. It also aims to generate debate, encourage public action and raise awareness of inspirational stories and human rights issues.

=== Civil society award programs ===
Numerous governmental and nongovernmental organizations employ goodwill ambassadors following the practice of honoring individuals with awards that denote goodwill ambassador status and roles. Awards are given for good relations, fundraising, acts of philanthropy and recognition for cause advocacy; some examples of such recognition are comedian Trevor Noah who received a South African Goodwill Ambassador Award in 2015, actress Alex Okoroji who received a Nigeria Goodwill Ambassador Award in 2017, and the Steve Irwin Memorial Goodwill Ambassador Award which was established in 2007. The former First Lady of Nigeria, Patience Jonathan, became a goodwill ambassador after receiving the African Goodwill Ambassador Award in Los Angeles in 2008.

=== Culture, customs and traditions ===
Since &quot;goodwill&quot; is an intangible asset it often needs a custodian in a culture that can conservatively emulate themselves in a social order to garner respect for the institutions of the state, nation or kingdom to advance civil society. This has given rise to organizations with specifically designated authorities like the Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices (IAC) which uses current and former first ladies to preserve and protect traditional indigenous culture.

== State goodwill ambassadors ==
Many national states or provincial regions use goodwill ambassadors to promote tourism, economic development, traditional values, customs and cultural ideals that contribute to their recognition. US states have civil service recognition programs that designate goodwill ambassadors honorarily and officially who are responsible for promoting tourism, events and the prosperity of the state in general. The oldest example of this is the Kentucky Colonel, which is the highest award bestowed by the state&#x27;s governor, officially established in 1895, the honorable title is given to civilians based on performing a great deed, community service or for accomplishing a noteworthy achievement that deserves recognition. The distinction of Kentucky colonel entitles the recipient to &quot;discharge their duties&quot; with the honorable title as a &quot;colonel&quot; and is denoted through the issuance of letters patent with the official dutiful designation as a &quot;good-will ambassador&quot;. Other US states also have similar civilian awards that denote the role of goodwill ambassador which are well-recognized, including that of the Tennessee Colonel, Rhode Island Commodore, Nebraska Admiral, Order of the Longleaf Pine, Arkansas Traveler, Yellow Rose of Texas, and Sagamore of the Wabash.

== Civilian goodwill ambassadors ==
There are many types of people that may be considered goodwill ambassadors representative to their local area for a short-time or over many years, informally, unofficially or by name. From a diplomatic perspective, the only difference in many cases is &quot;who, under what authority, confirmed the appointment or commission to a post or mission based ambassadorship&quot; with international protocol. Civilian goodwill ambassadors most often are not designated with an official appointment document from a head of state, granted letters patent, the honorable title or an officer commission; but this does not make them any less goodwill ambassadors. The term goodwill ambassador of an organization or ambassador of goodwill could be used for a company, an association, a local nonprofit, an event, a cause, an indigenous tribe, or a small city with a population of 50 to describe a representative; the difference and distinction of how and when to use the descriptive term as a professional title, position, role or occupation or to let it serve a part a job description is up to the person writing. Generally a goodwill ambassador can be anyone demonstrating benevolence on the part of someone else professionally, it can also be used in a community or informal sense.

There are many programs and objectives that include the term &quot;goodwill ambassador&quot; which are executed at a local levels for those who wish to pursue a career or define themselves using the term as a &quot;goodwill ambassador&quot;. There are a number of cities that have exemplary permanent and established goodwill ambassador programs including New York City, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Miami-Dade, Florida.

== Other goodwill ambassador types ==
The term &quot;goodwill ambassador&quot; should be clearly distinguished from the relative concept of a brand ambassador, who plays a role in promoting a company, organization or product through personal interaction. Under the idea of brand ambassador other concepts converge such as a tourism ambassador, honorifically in name locally for an organization or for someone such as the spokesman for the local fire department that goes out to talk to school children, who serves as a goodwill ambassador in his/her own right as a fireman.

Universities often call campus ambassadors with different and varied roles, goodwill ambassadors.

There are many individuals and organizations that use the term competitively for recognition, despite not having been granted a commission, being licensed to use the mark Goodwill Ambassador as a title, or receiving the honorable title through an official appointment. Apparently &quot;many simply use the term because it appeals to them&quot; often causing confusion with other organizations that use legally designated goodwill ambassadors. Sometimes being recognized as a goodwill ambassador within an organization or on its own is perceived as an accomplishment in itself and not an actual role, or if a role, not a title. Organizations most likely are legally and morally responsible for the conduct of its title holders and use of the honorable title after their name as if they were employees or legal representatives.

=== LinkedIn ambassadors ===
Social media based network formations such as the LinkedIn goodwill ambassadors established in 2014 by Richard DiPilla led to confusion, when he recognized thousands upon thousands of professionals around the world as humanitarians with a digital computer award certificate conferring recognition as a &quot;Global Goodwill Ambassador&quot; based on the career and volunteer related information they have provided about themselves using their public LinkedIn profiles. The network, which claims over 17,000 goodwill ambassadors became an organization in subsequent years called the &quot;Global Goodwill Ambassadors Foundation&quot; (GGAF) based in Minnesota, DiPilla started a website and sought 501(c)(3) status. Because of the number of award recipients&#x27; assimilation of similar descriptive roles occupied by representatives associated with the United Nations, the organization&#x27;s commemorative LinkedIn ambassadors have caused a great deal of ambiguity and confusion with official UNICEF Global Goodwill Ambassadors, an official UN Women Global Goodwill Ambassador, a Global Goodwill Ambassador for the World Food Program, the Global Goodwill Ambassador organization in New York, the Lamar University Global Goodwill Ambassadors Program and the Global Goodwill Ambassador Awards of 2016 in Nigeria. The organization&#x27;s name, the number of awards that use the term, and number of people that received the award naturally diminish the efforts and messages of the original prior users of the term &quot;Global Goodwill Ambassador&quot; making them less effective when using the relevant words together to represent their identity in public relations campaigns, in the news, on the Internet, on Facebook, Twitter and on the world stage to carry out their official missions.

Unlike official designations granted by UN Women, UNICEF, UNHCR or other United Nations organizations which require an official designation, LinkedIn ambassadorships from the GGAF: do not require previous experience as an ambassador; are not developed to provide diplomatic credence; are not conferred by a head of state; do not represent a legal authority; do not obligate recipients to a legitimate commission; and do not regulate any official duty that can be recognized or understood by other states as a diplomatic post or an honorable title.

<doc id="598434" wikidata="Q1161410" url="?curid=598434" title="Post-glacial rebound">
<text>Post-glacial rebound (also called isostatic rebound or crustal rebound) is the rise of land masses after the removal of the huge weight of ice sheets during the last glacial period, which had caused isostatic depression. Post-glacial rebound and isostatic depression are phases of glacial isostasy (glacial isostatic adjustment, glacioisostasy), the deformation of the Earth&#x27;s crust in response to changes in ice mass distribution. The direct raising effects of post-glacial rebound are readily apparent in parts of Northern Eurasia, Northern America, Patagonia, and Antarctica. However, through the processes of &quot;ocean siphoning&quot; and &quot;continental levering&quot;, the effects of post-glacial rebound on sea level are felt globally far from the locations of current and former ice sheets.

==Overview==

During the last glacial period, much of northern Europe, Asia, North America, Greenland and Antarctica were covered by ice sheets, which reached up to three kilometres thick during the glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago. The enormous weight of this ice caused the surface of the Earth&#x27;s crust to deform and warp downward, forcing the viscoelastic mantle material to flow away from the loaded region. At the end of each glacial period when the glaciers retreated, the removal of this weight led to slow (and still ongoing) uplift or rebound of the land and the return flow of mantle material back under the deglaciated area. Due to the extreme viscosity of the mantle, it will take many thousands of years for the land to reach an equilibrium level.

The uplift has taken place in two distinct stages. The initial uplift following deglaciation was almost immediate due to the elastic response of the crust as the ice load was removed. After this elastic phase, uplift proceeded by slow viscous flow at an exponentially decreasing rate. Today, typical uplift rates are of the order of 1 cm/year or less. In northern Europe, this is clearly shown by the GPS data obtained by the BIFROST GPS network; for example in Finland, the total area of the country is growing by about seven square kilometers per year. Studies suggest that rebound will continue for at least another 10,000 years. The total uplift from the end of deglaciation depends on the local ice load and could be several hundred metres near the centre of rebound.

Recently, the term &quot;post-glacial rebound&quot; is gradually being replaced by the term &quot;glacial isostatic adjustment&quot;. This is in recognition that the response of the Earth to glacial loading and unloading is not limited to the upward rebound movement, but also involves downward land movement, horizontal crustal motion, changes in global sea levels and the Earth&#x27;s gravity field, induced earthquakes, and changes in the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Another alternate term is &quot;glacial isostasy&quot;, because the uplift near the centre of rebound is due to the tendency towards the restoration of isostatic equilibrium (as in the case of isostasy of mountains). Unfortunately, that term gives the wrong impression that isostatic equilibrium is somehow reached, so by appending &quot;adjustment&quot; at the end, the motion of restoration is emphasized.

==Effects==
Post-glacial rebound produces measurable effects on vertical crustal motion, global sea levels, horizontal crustal motion, gravity field, Earth&#x27;s rotation, crustal stress, and earthquakes. Studies of glacial rebound give us information about the flow law of mantle rocks, which is important to the study of mantle convection, plate tectonics and the thermal evolution of the Earth. It also gives insight into past ice sheet history, which is important to glaciology, paleoclimate, and changes in global sea level. Understanding postglacial rebound is also important to our ability to monitor recent global change.

===Vertical crustal motion===
Erratic boulders, U-shaped valleys, drumlins, eskers, kettle lakes, bedrock striations are among the common signatures of the Ice Age. In addition, post-glacial rebound has caused numerous significant changes to coastlines and landscapes over the last several thousand years, and the effects continue to be significant.

In Sweden, Lake Mälaren was formerly an arm of the Baltic Sea, but uplift eventually cut it off and led to its becoming a freshwater lake in about the 12th century, at the time when Stockholm was founded at its outlet. Marine seashells found in Lake Ontario sediments imply a similar event in prehistoric times. Other pronounced effects can be seen on the island of Öland, Sweden, which has little topographic relief due to the presence of the very level Stora Alvaret. The rising land has caused the Iron Age settlement area to recede from the Baltic Sea, making the present day villages on the west coast set back unexpectedly far from the shore. These effects are quite dramatic at the village of Alby, for example, where the Iron Age inhabitants were known to subsist on substantial coastal fishing.

As a result of post-glacial rebound, the Gulf of Bothnia is predicted to eventually close up at Kvarken in more than 2,000 years. The Kvarken is a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site, selected as a &quot;type area&quot; illustrating the effects of post-glacial rebound and the holocene glacial retreat.

In several other Nordic ports, like Tornio and Pori (formerly at Ulvila), the harbour has had to be relocated several times. Place names in the coastal regions also illustrate the rising land: there are inland places named &#x27;island&#x27;, &#x27;skerry&#x27;, &#x27;rock&#x27;, &#x27;point&#x27; and &#x27;sound&#x27;. For example, Oulunsalo &quot;island of Oulujoki&quot; is a peninsula, with inland names such as &quot;Koivukari&quot; &quot;Birch Rock&quot;, &quot;Santaniemi&quot; &quot;Sandy Cape&quot;, and &quot;Salmioja&quot; &quot;the brook of the Sound&quot;. (Compare and .)

In Great Britain, glaciation affected Scotland but not southern England, and the post-glacial rebound of northern Great Britain (up to 10 cm per century) is causing a corresponding downward movement of the southern half of the island (up to 5 cm per century). This will eventually lead to an increased risk of floods in southern England and south-western Ireland.

Since the glacial isostatic adjustment process causes the land to move relative to the sea, ancient shorelines are found to lie above present day sea level in areas that were once glaciated. On the other hand, places in the peripheral bulge area which was uplifted during glaciation now begins to subside. Therefore, ancient beaches are found below present day sea level in the bulge area. The &quot;relative sea level data&quot;, which consists of height and age measurements of the ancient beaches around the world, tells us that glacial isostatic adjustment proceeded at a higher rate near the end of deglaciation than today.

The present-day uplift motion in northern Europe is also monitored by a GPS network called BIFROST. Results of GPS data show a peak rate of about 11 mm/year in the north part of the Gulf of Bothnia, but this uplift rate decreases away and becomes negative outside the former ice margin.

In the near field outside the former ice margin, the land sinks relative to the sea. This is the case along the east coast of the United States, where ancient beaches are found submerged below present day sea level and Florida is expected to be submerged in the future. GPS data in North America also confirms that land uplift becomes subsidence outside the former ice margin.

===Global sea levels===
To form the ice sheets of the last Ice Age, water from the oceans evaporated, condensed as snow and was deposited as ice in high latitudes. Thus global sea level fell during glaciation.

The ice sheets at the last glacial maximum were so massive that global sea level fell by about 120 metres. Thus continental shelves were exposed and many islands became connected with the continents through dry land. This was the case between the British Isles and Europe (Doggerland), or between Taiwan, the Indonesian islands and Asia (Sundaland). A land bridge also existed between Siberia and Alaska that allowed the migration of people and animals during the last glacial maximum.

The fall in sea level also affects the circulation of ocean currents and thus has important impact on climate during the glacial maximum.

During deglaciation, the melted ice water returns to the oceans, thus sea level in the ocean increases again. However, geological records of sea level changes show that the redistribution of the melted ice water is not the same everywhere in the oceans. In other words, depending upon the location, the rise in sea level at a certain site may be more than that at another site. This is due to the gravitational attraction between the mass of the melted water and the other masses, such as remaining ice sheets, glaciers, water masses and mantle rocks and the changes in centrifugal potential due to Earth&#x27;s variable rotation.

===Horizontal crustal motion===

Accompanying vertical motion is the horizontal motion of the crust. The BIFROST GPS network shows that the motion diverges from the centre of rebound. However, the largest horizontal velocity is found near the former ice margin.

The situation in North America is less certain; this is due to the sparse distribution of GPS stations in northern Canada, which is rather inaccessible.

===Tilt===
The combination of horizontal and vertical motion changes the tilt of the surface. That is, locations farther north rise faster, an effect that becomes apparent in lakes. The bottoms of the lakes gradually tilt away from the direction of the former ice maximum, such that lake shores on the side of the maximum (typically north) recede and the opposite (southern) shores sink. This causes the formation of new rapids and rivers. For example, Lake Pielinen in 
Finland, which is large (90 x 30 km) and oriented perpendicularly to the former ice margin, originally drained through an outlet in the middle of the lake near Nunnanlahti to Lake Höytiäinen. The change of tilt caused Pielinen to burst through the Uimaharju esker at the southwestern end of the lake, creating a new river (Pielisjoki) that runs to the sea via Lake Pyhäselkä to Lake Saimaa. The effects are similar to that concerning seashores, but occur above sea level. Tilting of land will also affect the flow of water in lakes and rivers in the future, and thus is important for water resource management planning.

In Sweden Lake Sommen&#x27;s outlet in the northwest has a rebound of 2.36 mm/a while in the eastern Svanaviken it is 2.05 mm/a. This means the lake is being slowly tilted and the southeastern shores drowned.

===Gravity field===

Ice, water, and mantle rocks have mass, and as they move around, they exert a gravitational pull on other masses towards them. Thus, the gravity field, which is sensitive to all mass on the surface and within the Earth, is affected by the redistribution of ice/melted water on the surface of the Earth and the flow of mantle rocks within.

Today, more than 6000 years after the last deglaciation terminated, the flow of mantle material back to the glaciated area causes the overall shape of the Earth to become less oblate. This change in the topography of Earth&#x27;s surface affects the long-wavelength components of the gravity field.

The changing gravity field can be detected by repeated land measurements with absolute gravimeters and recently by the GRACE satellite mission. The change in long-wavelength components of Earth&#x27;s gravity field also perturbs the orbital motion of satellites and has been detected by LAGEOS satellite motion.

===Vertical datum===
The &quot;vertical datum&quot; is a reference surface for altitude measurement and plays vital roles in many human activities, including land surveying and construction of buildings and bridges. Since postglacial rebound continuously deforms the crustal surface and the gravitational field, the vertical datum needs to be redefined repeatedly through time.

===State of stress, intraplate earthquakes and volcanism===
According to the theory of plate tectonics, plate-plate interaction results in earthquakes near plate boundaries. However, large earthquakes are found in intraplate environments like eastern Canada (up to M7) and northern Europe (up to M5) which are far away from present-day plate boundaries. An important intraplate earthquake was the magnitude 8 New Madrid earthquake that occurred in mid-continental US in the year 1811.

Glacial loads provided more than 30 MPa of vertical stress in northern Canada and more than 20 MPa in northern Europe during glacial maximum. This vertical stress is supported by the mantle and the flexure of the lithosphere. Since the mantle and the lithosphere continuously respond to the changing ice and water loads, the state of stress at any location continuously changes in time. The changes in the orientation of the state of stress is recorded in the postglacial faults in southeastern Canada. When the postglacial faults formed at the end of deglaciation 9000 years ago, the horizontal principal stress orientation was almost perpendicular to the former ice margin, but today the orientation is in the northeast–southwest, along the direction of seafloor spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This shows that the stress due to postglacial rebound had played an important role at deglacial time, but has gradually relaxed so that tectonic stress has become more dominant today.

According to the Mohr–Coulomb theory of rock failure, large glacial loads generally suppress earthquakes, but rapid deglaciation promotes earthquakes. According to Wu &amp; Hasagawa, the rebound stress that is available to trigger earthquakes today is of the order of 1 MPa. This stress level is not large enough to rupture intact rocks but is large enough to reactivate pre-existing faults that are close to failure. Thus, both postglacial rebound and past tectonics play important roles in today&#x27;s intraplate earthquakes in eastern Canada and southeast US. Generally postglacial rebound stress could have triggered the intraplate earthquakes in eastern Canada and may have played some role in triggering earthquakes in the eastern US including the New Madrid earthquakes of 1811. The situation in northern Europe today is complicated by the current tectonic activities nearby and by coastal loading and weakening.

Increasing pressure due to the weight of the ice during glaciation may have suppressed melt generation and volcanic activities below Iceland and Greenland. On the other hand, decreasing pressure due to deglaciation can increase the melt production and volcanic activities by 20-30 times.

==Recent global warming==
Recent global warming has caused mountain glaciers and the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt and global sea level to rise. Therefore, monitoring sea level rise and the mass balance of ice sheets and glaciers allows people to understand more about global warming.

Recent rise in sea levels has been monitored by tide gauges and satellite altimetry (e.g. TOPEX/Poseidon). As well as the addition of melted ice water from glaciers and ice sheets, recent sea level changes are affected by the thermal expansion of sea water due to global warming, sea level change due to deglaciation of the last glacial maximum (postglacial sea level change), deformation of the land and ocean floor and other factors. Thus, to understand global warming from sea level change, one must be able to separate all these factors, especially postglacial rebound, since it is one of the leading factors.

Mass changes of ice sheets can be monitored by measuring changes in the ice surface height, the deformation of the ground below and the changes in the gravity field over the ice sheet. Thus ICESat, GPS and GRACE satellite mission are useful for such purpose. However, glacial isostatic adjustment of the ice sheets affect ground deformation and the gravity field today. Thus understanding glacial isostatic adjustment is important in monitoring recent global warming.

One of the possible impacts of global warming-triggered rebound may be more volcanic activity in previously ice-capped areas such as Iceland and Greenland. It may also trigger intraplate earthquakes near the ice margins of Greenland and Antarctica. Unusually rapid (up to 4.1 cm/year) present glacial isostatic rebound due to recent ice mass losses in the Amundsen Sea embayment region of Antarctica coupled with low regional mantle viscosity is predicted to provide a modest stabilizing influence on marine ice sheet instability in West Antarctica, but likely not to a sufficient degree to arrest it.

==Applications==
The speed and amount of postglacial rebound is determined by two factors: the viscosity or rheology (i.e., the flow) of the mantle, and the ice loading and unloading histories on the surface of Earth.

The viscosity of the mantle is important in understanding mantle convection, plate tectonics, the dynamical processes in Earth, and the thermal state and thermal evolution of Earth. However viscosity is difficult to observe because creep experiments of mantle rocks at natural strain rates would take thousands of years to observe and the ambient temperature and pressure conditions are not easy to attain for a long enough time. Thus, the observations of postglacial rebound provide a natural experiment to measure mantle rheology. Modelling of glacial isostatic adjustment addresses the question of how viscosity changes in the radial and lateral directions and whether the flow law is linear, nonlinear, or composite rheology. Mantle viscosity may additionally be estimated using seismic tomography, where seismic velocity is used as a proxy observable. 

Ice thickness histories are useful in the study of paleoclimatology, glaciology and paleo-oceanography. Ice thickness histories are traditionally deduced from the three types of information: First, the sea level data at stable sites far away from the centers of deglaciation give an estimate of how much water entered the oceans or equivalently how much ice was locked up at glacial maximum. Secondly, the location and dates of terminal moraines tell us the areal extent and retreat of past ice sheets. Physics of glaciers gives us the theoretical profile of ice sheets at equilibrium, it also says that the thickness and horizontal extent of equilibrium ice sheets are closely related to the basal condition of the ice sheets. Thus the volume of ice locked up is proportional to their instantaneous area. Finally, the heights of ancient beaches in the sea level data and observed land uplift rates (e.g. from GPS or VLBI) can be used to constrain local ice thickness. A popular ice model deduced this way is the ICE5G model. Because the response of the Earth to changes in ice height is slow, it cannot record rapid fluctuation or surges of ice sheets, thus the ice sheet profiles deduced this way only gives the &quot;average height&quot; over a thousand years or so.

Glacial isostatic adjustment also plays an important role in understanding recent global warming and climate change.

==Discovery==
Before the eighteenth century, it was thought, in Sweden, that sea levels were falling. On the initiative of Anders Celsius a number of marks were made in rock on different locations along the Swedish coast. In 1765 it was possible to conclude that it was not a lowering of sea levels but an uneven rise of land. In 1865 Thomas Jamieson came up with a theory that the rise of land was connected with the ice age that had been first discovered in 1837. The theory was accepted after investigations by Gerard De Geer of old shorelines in Scandinavia published in 1890.

==Legal implications==
In areas where the rising of land is seen, it is necessary to define the exact limits of property. In Finland, the &quot;new land&quot; is legally the property of the owner of the water area, not any land owners on the shore. Therefore, if the owner of the land wishes to build a pier over the &quot;new land&quot;, they need the permission of the owner of the (former) water area. The landowner of the shore may redeem the new land at market price. Usually the owner of the water area is the partition unit of the landowners of the shores, a collective holding corporation.

==Formulation: sea-level equation==
The sea-level equation (SLE) is a linear integral equation that describes the sea-level variations associated with the PGR.
The basic idea of the SLE dates back to 1888, when Woodward published his pioneering work on the form and position of mean sea level, and only later has been refined by Platzman and Farrell in the context of the study of the ocean tides. In the words of Wu and Peltier, the solution of the SLE yields the space– and time–dependent change of ocean bathymetry which is required to keep the gravitational potential of the sea surface constant for a specific deglaciation chronology and viscoelastic earth model. The SLE theory was then developed by other authors as Mitrovica &amp; Peltier, Mitrovica et al. and Spada &amp; Stocchi. In its simplest form, the SLE reads

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the sea–level change, formula_3 is the sea surface variation as seen from Earth&#x27;s center of mass, and formula_4 is vertical displacement.

In a more explicit form the SLE can be written as follow:

: formula_5

where formula_6 is colatitude and formula_7 is longitude, formula_8 is time, formula_9 and formula_10 are the densities of ice and water, respectively, formula_11 is the reference surface gravity, formula_12 is the sea–level Green&#x27;s function (dependent upon the formula_13 and formula_14 viscoelastic load–deformation coefficients - LDCs), formula_15 is the ice thickness variation, formula_16 represents the eustatic term (i.e. the ocean–averaged value of formula_2), formula_18 and formula_19 denote spatio-temporal convolutions over the ice- and ocean-covered regions, and the overbar indicates an average over the surface of the oceans that ensures mass conservation.

<text>Mniarogekko chahoua, commonly known as the mossy New Caledonian gecko, short-snouted New Caledonian gecko, Bavay&#x27;s giant gecko, or mossy prehensile-tailed gecko, is an arboreal gecko found natively on the southern portion of the island of New Caledonia and on the outlying islands of Île des Pins.

==Conservation status==
&quot;Mniarogekko chahoua&quot; is currently listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
&quot;Mniarogekko chahoua&quot; was first described in 1869 as &quot;Platydactylus chahoua&quot; by Arthur Bavay, a French pharmacist and herpetologist.

==Description==
&quot;Mniarogekko chahoua&quot; gets its common name from the moss or lichen-like pattern it displays. Colors range from rusty red and brown to green or gray. There has been some notation that color could possibly be a geographic indicator in this species as the geckos from the outer islands most often display the lighter gray patterns. It possesses a strong, well-muscled, fully prehensile tail and is not subject to dropping it as readily as some of its relatives. Adult length is 10-12&quot; (25–31 cm).

==Diet==
&quot;Mniarogekko chahoua&quot;, like most of the New Caledonian geckos, are seasonally-dependent omnivores and frugivores. Their diet in the wild consists of various insects and fruits, generally alternating from one to the other according to several factors, including seasonal changes, tree and fruit blooming times, and fruit and insect availability. They may also supplement their diet with small lizards.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Mniarogekko chahoua&quot; lays two well-calcified eggs that become adhered to one another shortly after laying. This is known as &quot;egg gluing&quot;. &quot;Mniarogekko chahoua&quot; is the only &quot;Rhacodactylus&quot; gecko that lays adhering eggs. The eggs are generally laid on top of the substrate (usually under loose tree bark and leaf litter) and are guarded by the female. The eggs hatch 60–90 days after laying.

==Captivity==
This gecko is sometimes found in the pet trade, and typically available captive-bred. With good care, this species can live up to 15–20 years.

<doc id="598437" wikidata="Q719955" url="?curid=598437" title="Number Ones (Michael Jackson album)">
<text>Number Ones is a greatest hits album by American singer Michael Jackson. It was released on November 18, 2003, by Epic Records. &quot;Number Ones&quot; was Jackson&#x27;s first standalone compilation album with Epic Records, after the release of the first disc of &quot;&quot; in 1995 (and after the re-release of that disc as a single album titled &quot;Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I&quot; in 2001). The album included Jackson&#x27;s singles that reportedly reached number 1 in charts around the world, hence the album&#x27;s name. &quot;Number Ones&quot; also features the last original single released during Jackson&#x27;s lifetime, &quot;One More Chance&quot;, released four days after the release of the album.

&quot;Number Ones&quot; was successful around the world, originally reaching number one in the United Kingdom, among other countries. The album eventually returned to the top spot in the UK after Jackson&#x27;s sudden death in 2009, and became the number one selling album in the United States for six non-consecutive weeks and stayed at number one for twenty-seven weeks on the US Top Pop Catalog Albums chart that year. However, as a &#x27;catalog&#x27; title, initially &quot;Number Ones&quot; was excluded from the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the main albums chart in the United States, denying Jackson a seventh solo number one album on the chart. The rules preventing titles older than 18 months to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 were subsequently changed in the fall of 2009 due to the posthumous success of Jackson, as well as The Beatles re-mastered re-releases.

With &quot;Number Ones,&quot; Jackson was the first artist to sell more than one million music downloads in one week. The album was also the third best-selling album of 2009 in the United States according to Nielsen Soundscan and ninth best-selling worldwide according to IFPI. By 2021, &quot;Number Ones&quot; was certified 5× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 2009 American Music Awards, it won two awards - Favorite Pop/Rock Album and Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album. One of the best-selling albums of the 21st century, the compilation managed to sell over 10 million copies worldwide.

==Background==
In 2003, Sony released &quot;Number Ones&quot;, which was different from &quot;Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I&quot; in several ways. The former sold over 5 million copies, comprised fifteen singles (fourteen of them &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Top 10 hits): three from &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, five from &quot;Thriller&quot;, four from &quot;Bad&quot; and three from &quot;Dangerous&quot;. The versions of those songs were included exactly as they appeared on the original albums, whereas &quot;Number Ones&quot; included radio edits, single versions, and new edits. &quot;Number Ones&quot; also offered singles from the second disc of &quot;&quot;, plus the title track from &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix&quot; and &quot;You Rock My World&quot;, the hit single from &quot;Invincible&quot;. The album also included two other tracks: &quot;Break of Dawn&quot; (an album track from &quot;Invincible&quot;) and the new, previously unreleased single, &quot;One More Chance&quot;, which became the final hit single during his lifetime. The beat-heavy ballad &quot;One More Chance&quot;, which was written for Jackson by R. Kelly, was recorded for this collection. The U.S. release also included another track, a 1981 live rendition of &quot;Ben&quot; from the Epic release &quot;The Jacksons Live!&quot;. &quot;Ben&quot; reached the number one position in 1972 on Motown, and became Jackson&#x27;s first number one single in the United States as a solo artist.

There were four covers for the &quot;Number Ones&quot; album: a pose from the &quot;Bad&quot; music video, a pose from a photo session for the &quot;Off the Wall&quot; album cover, a pose where he is suspended on his toes while performing &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, and the final cover shows him holding his signature fedora, in the midst of a kick (from &quot;Black or White&quot;).

==Later impact==
According to Nielsen SoundScan &quot;Number Ones,&quot; debuted at No. 13 in Billboard&#x27;s top 200 chart with sales of 121,000 copies in the U.S.

&quot;Number Ones&quot; had already sold 1,825,000 copies in the United States before the week of Jackson&#x27;s death. Following Jackson&#x27;s death on June 25, 2009, the album sold 108,000 units in the US on the chart week ending July 1, 2009, and was the biggest-selling album of the week, though only one-quarter of Jackson&#x27;s entire US album sales recorded that week, shifting just under 425,000 albums and 2.6 million digital singles (more than 50 times of all the combined digital single sales of the previous week and making Jackson the first artist to sell more than one million downloads in one week). The following week it remained the biggest selling album shifting its largest one-week sales since being released in 2003 with 350,000 copies sold, as Jackson&#x27;s overall album sales tally swelled to 1.1 million for the week. &quot;Number Ones&quot; was 2009&#x27;s third biggest-selling album according to SoundScan, behind Susan Boyle&#x27;s &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot; and Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;Fearless&quot;. Although it was the best selling album for three weeks in a row, the record was not allowed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 due to (now defunct) rules, but entered the Comprehensive Chart at number 1 where it remained for six weeks. &quot;Number Ones&quot; was the best-selling album in the United States for six consecutive weeks amassing sales of 2.36 million by the end of 2009. The &quot;Billboard&quot; Catalog chart also allowed &quot;Number Ones&quot; to chart, which led Jackson in occupying the entire top 12 positions on the chart. &quot;Number Ones&quot; has topped the Top Catalog Albums Chart several times; most recently for three consecutive weeks in May and June 2014. As of July 29, 2016, the album has sold over 5.3 million copies in the US. &quot;Number Ones&quot; is Jackson’s best-selling hits package in the Nielsen era (1991–present), and third-biggest seller overall in that period (behind &quot;Thriller&quot;, with 6.7 million, and &quot;Dangerous&quot;, with 6.5 million).

In the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada, the album re-entered the UK charts at number 1 the week following Jackson&#x27;s death.

In New Zealand, &quot;Number Ones&quot; re-entered the chart following Jackson&#x27;s death at number 38, climbing to number 4 the following week. It then reached number 1 the following week; the album was also certified 4× Platinum, shipping over 60,000 copies.

<text>Frederiksberg Kommune is a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) on the island of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) in Denmark. Part of the Capital Region of Denmark and the city of Copenhagen, it is surrounded by Copenhagen Municipality. The municipality, co-extensive with its seat, covers a total area (land and water) of according to the Municipal Key Figures and has a population of 104,899 (1. January 2024) making it the smallest municipality in Denmark area-wise, the seventh most populous, and the most densely populated. Its mayor is Michael Vindfeldt from the Social Democrats serving from 1 January 2022.

The city of Frederiksberg is the only town in the municipality, and is therefore the site of its municipal council.

Frederiksberg is located as an enclave within the municipality of Copenhagen, the national capital. The municipality was originally situated west of Copenhagen, but after a number of smaller municipalities were merged with Copenhagen in 1901, it became surrounded by Copenhagen.

Frederiksberg was one of the three last Danish municipalities not belonging to a County—the others being Copenhagen and Bornholm. On 1 January 2007, the municipality lost its county privileges and became part of Region Hovedstaden (i.e. the &quot;Copenhagen Capital Region&quot;).

Frederiksberg municipality was not merged with other municipalities as the result of nationwide &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007).

<doc id="598445" wikidata="Q633192" url="?curid=598445" title="UNIX System V">
<text>Unix System V (pronounced: &quot;System Five&quot;) is one of the first commercial versions of the Unix operating system. It was originally developed by AT&amp;T and first released in 1983. Four major versions of System V were released, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. System V Release 4 (SVR4) was commercially the most successful version, being the result of an effort, marketed as &quot;Unix System Unification&quot;, which solicited the collaboration of the major Unix vendors. It was the source of several common commercial Unix features. System V is sometimes abbreviated to SysV.

, the AT&amp;T-derived Unix market is divided between four System V variants: IBM&#x27;s AIX, Hewlett Packard Enterprise&#x27;s HP-UX and Oracle&#x27;s Solaris, plus the free-software illumos forked from OpenSolaris.

== Overview ==

=== Introduction ===

System V was the successor to 1982&#x27;s UNIX System III. While AT&amp;T developed and sold hardware that ran System V, most customers ran a version from a reseller, based on AT&amp;T&#x27;s reference implementation. A standards document called the System V Interface Definition outlined the default features and behavior of implementations.

=== AT&amp;T support ===
During the formative years of AT&amp;T&#x27;s computer business, the division went through several phases of System V software groups, beginning with the Unix Support Group (USG), followed by Unix System Development Laboratory (USDL), followed by AT&amp;T Information Systems (ATTIS), and finally Unix System Laboratories (USL).

=== Rivalry with BSD ===

In the 1980s and early-1990s, UNIX System V and the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) were the two major versions of UNIX. Historically, BSD was also commonly called &quot;BSD Unix&quot; or &quot;Berkeley Unix&quot;. Eric S. Raymond summarizes the longstanding relationship and rivalry between System V and BSD during the early period:

While HP, IBM and others chose System V as the basis for their Unix offerings, other vendors such as Sun Microsystems and DEC extended BSD. Throughout its development, though, System V was infused with features from BSD, while BSD variants such as DEC&#x27;s Ultrix received System V features. AT&amp;T and Sun Microsystems worked together to merge System V with BSD-based SunOS to produce Solaris, one of the primary System V descendants still in use today. Since the early 1990s, due to standardization efforts such as POSIX and the success of Linux, the division between System V and BSD has become less important.

== Releases ==
=== SVR1 ===
System V, known inside Bell Labs as Unix 5.0, succeeded AT&amp;T&#x27;s previous commercial Unix called System III in January, 1983.
Unix 4.0 was never released externally, which would have been designated as System IV.
This first release of System V (called System V.0, System V Release 1, or SVR1) was developed by AT&amp;T&#x27;s UNIX Support Group (USG) and based on the Bell Labs internal USG UNIX 5.0.

System V also included features such as the vi editor and curses from 4.1 BSD, developed at the University of California, Berkeley; it also improved performance by adding buffer and inode caches. It also added support for inter-process communication using messages, semaphores, and shared memory, developed earlier for the Bell-internal CB UNIX.

SVR1 ran on DEC PDP-11 and VAX minicomputers.

=== SVR2 ===
AT&amp;T&#x27;s UNIX Support Group (USG) transformed into the UNIX System Development Laboratory (USDL), which released System V Release 2 in 1984. SVR2 added shell functions and the SVID. SVR2.4 added demand paging, copy-on-write, shared memory, and record and file locking.

The concept of the &quot;porting base&quot; was formalized, and the DEC VAX-11/780 was chosen for this release. The &quot;porting base&quot; is the so-called original version of a release, from which all porting efforts for other machines emanate.

Educational source licenses for SVR2 were offered by AT&amp;T for US$800 for the first CPU, and $400 for each additional CPU. A commercial source license was offered for $43,000, with three months of support, and a $16,000 price per additional CPU.

Apple Computer&#x27;s A/UX operating system was initially based on this release. SCO XENIX also used SVR2 as its basis. The first release of HP-UX was also an SVR2 derivative.

Maurice J. Bach&#x27;s book, &quot;The Design of the UNIX Operating System&quot;, is the definitive description of the SVR2 kernel.

=== SVR3 ===
AT&amp;T&#x27;s UNIX System Development Laboratory (USDL) was succeeded by AT&amp;T Information Systems (ATTIS), which distributed UNIX System V, Release 3, in 1987. SVR3 included STREAMS, Remote File Sharing (RFS), the File System Switch (FSS) virtual file system mechanism, a restricted form of shared libraries, and the Transport Layer Interface (TLI) network API. The final version was Release 3.2 in 1988, which added binary compatibility to Xenix on Intel platforms (see Intel Binary Compatibility Standard).

User interface improvements included the &quot;layers&quot; windowing system for the DMD 5620 graphics terminal, and the SVR3.2 curses libraries that offered eight or more color pairs and other at this time important features (forms, panels, menus, etc.). The AT&amp;T 3B2 became the official &quot;porting base.&quot;

SCO UNIX was based upon SVR3.2, as was ISC 386/ix. Among the more obscure distributions of SVR3.2 for the 386 were ESIX 3.2 by Everex and &quot;System V, Release 3.2&quot; sold by Intel themselves; these two shipped &quot;plain vanilla&quot; AT&amp;T&#x27;s codebase.

IBM&#x27;s AIX operating system is an SVR3 derivative.

=== SVR4 === 


System V Release 4.0 was announced on October 18, 1988 and was incorporated into a variety of commercial Unix products from early 1989 onwards. A joint project of AT&amp;T Unix System Laboratories and Sun Microsystems, it combined technology from:

* SVR3
* 4.3BSD
* Xenix
* SunOS

New features included:

* From BSD:
** TCP/IP support
** Sockets
** UFS
** Support for multiple groups
** C shell
* From SunOS:
** Virtual file system interface (replacing File System Switch in System V Release 3)
** NFS
** New virtual memory system including support for memory mapped files
** Improved shared library system based on the SunOS 4.x model
** OpenWindows GUI environment
** External Data Representation (XDR) and ONC RPC
* From Xenix:
** x86 device drivers
** Binary compatibility with Xenix (in the x86 version of System V)
* KornShell
* ANSI X3J11 C compatibility
* Multi-National Language Support (MNLS)
* Better internationalization support
* An application binary interface (ABI) based on Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)
* Support for standards such as POSIX and X/Open

Many companies licensed SVR4 and bundled it with computer systems such as workstations and network servers. SVR4 systems vendors included Atari (Atari System V), Commodore (Amiga Unix), Data General (DG/UX), Fujitsu (UXP/DS), Hitachi (HI-UX), Hewlett-Packard (HP-UX), NCR (Unix/NS), NEC (EWS-UX, UP-UX, UX/4800, SUPER-UX), OKI (OKI System V), Pyramid Technology (DC/OSx), SGI (IRIX), Siemens (SINIX), Sony (NEWS-OS), Sumitomo Electric Industries (SEIUX), and Sun Microsystems (Solaris) with illumos in the 2010s as the only open-source platform.

Software porting houses also sold enhanced and supported Intel x86 versions. SVR4 software vendors included Dell (Dell UNIX), Everex (ESIX), Micro Station Technology (SVR4), Microport (SVR4), and UHC (SVR4).

The primary platforms for SVR4 were Intel x86 and SPARC; the SPARC version, called Solaris 2 (or, internally, SunOS 5.x), was developed by Sun. The relationship between Sun and AT&amp;T was terminated after the release of SVR4, meaning that later versions of Solaris did not inherit features of later SVR4.x releases. Sun would in 2005 release most of the source code for Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10) as the open-source OpenSolaris project, creating, with its forks, the only open-source (albeit heavily modified) System V implementation available. After Oracle took over Sun, Solaris was forked into proprietary release, but illumos as the continuation project is being developed in open-source.

A consortium of Intel-based resellers including Unisys, ICL, NCR Corporation, and Olivetti developed SVR4.0MP with multiprocessing capability (allowing system calls to be processed from any processor, but interrupt servicing only from a &quot;master&quot; processor).

Release 4.1 ES (Enhanced Security) added security features required for Orange Book B2 compliance and Access Control Lists and support for dynamic loading of kernel modules.

=== SVR4.2 / UnixWare ===
In 1992, AT&amp;T USL engaged in a joint venture with Novell, called Univel. That year saw the release System V.4.2 as Univel UnixWare, featuring the Veritas File System. Other vendors included UHC and Consensys. Release 4.2MP, completed late 1993, added support for multiprocessing and it was released as UnixWare 2 in 1995.

Eric S. Raymond warned prospective buyers about SVR4.2 versions, as they often did not include on-line man pages. In his 1994 buyers guide, he attributes this change in policy to Unix System Laboratories.

=== SVR5 / UnixWare 7 ===
The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), owners of Xenix, eventually acquired the UnixWare trademark and the distribution rights to the System V Release 4.2 codebase from Novell, while other vendors (Sun, IBM, HP) continued to use and extend System V Release 4. Novell transferred ownership of the Unix trademark to The Open Group. 

System V Release 5 was developed in 1997 by the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) as a merger of SCO OpenServer (an SVR3-derivative) and UnixWare, with a focus on large-scale servers. It was released as SCO UnixWare 7. SCO&#x27;s successor, The SCO Group, also based SCO OpenServer 6 on SVR5, but the codebase is not used by any other major developer or reseller.

=== SVR6 (cancelled) ===
System V Release 6 was announced by SCO to be released by the end of 2004, but was apparently cancelled. It was supposed to support 64-bit systems. SCO also introduced Smallfoot in 2004, a low-resource &quot;embeddable&quot; variant of UnixWare for dedicated commercial and industrial applications, in an attempt that was perceived as a response to the growing popularity of Linux. The industry has since coalesced around The Open Group&#x27;s Single UNIX Specification version 3 (UNIX 03).

== Market position ==

=== Availability during the 1990s on x86 platforms ===

In the 1980s and 1990s, a variety of SVR4 versions of Unix were available commercially for the x86 PC platform. However, the market for commercial Unix on PCs declined after Linux and BSD became widely available. In late 1994, Eric S. Raymond discontinued his &quot;PC-clone UNIX Software Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; on USENET, stating, &quot;The reason I am dropping this is that I run Linux now, and I no longer find the SVr4 market interesting or significant.&quot;

In 1998, a confidential memo at Microsoft stated, &quot;Linux is on track to eventually own the x86 UNIX market&quot;, and further predicted, &quot;I believe that Linux – moreso than NT – will be the biggest threat to SCO in the near future.&quot;

An &quot;InfoWorld&quot; article from 2001 characterized SCO UnixWare as having a &quot;bleak outlook&quot; due to being &quot;trounced&quot; in the market by Linux and Solaris, and IDC predicted that SCO would &quot;continue to see a shrinking share of the market&quot;.

=== Project Monterey ===
Project Monterey was started in 1998 to combine major features of existing commercial Unix platforms, as a joint project of Compaq, IBM, Intel, SCO, and Sequent Computer Systems. The target platform was meant to be Intel&#x27;s new IA-64 architecture and Itanium line of processors. However, the project was abruptly canceled in 2001 after little progress.

=== System V and the Unix market ===
By 2001, several major Unix variants such as SCO UnixWare, Compaq Tru64 UNIX, and SGI IRIX were all in decline. The three major Unix versions doing well in the market were IBM AIX, Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s HP-UX, and Sun&#x27;s Solaris.

In 2006, when SGI declared bankruptcy, analysts questioned whether Linux would replace proprietary Unix altogether. In a 2006 article written for &quot;Computerworld&quot; by Mark Hall, the economics of Linux were cited as a major factor driving the migration from Unix to Linux:

The article also cites trends in high-performance computing applications as evidence of a dramatic shift from Unix to Linux:

In a November 2015 survey of the top 500 supercomputers, Unix was used by only 1.2% (all running IBM AIX), while Linux was used by 98.8%; the same survey in November 2017 reports 100% of them using Linux.

System V derivatives continued to be deployed on some proprietary server platforms. The principal variants of System V that remain in commercial use are AIX (IBM), Solaris (Oracle), and HP-UX (HP). According to a study done by IDC, in 2012 the worldwide Unix market was divided between IBM (56%), Oracle (19.2%), and HP (18.6%). No other commercial Unix vendor had more than 2% of the market. Industry analysts generally characterize proprietary Unix as having entered a period of slow but permanent decline.

=== OpenSolaris and illumos distributions===

OpenSolaris and its derivatives are the only SVR4 descendants that are open-source software. 
Core system software continues to be developed as illumos used in illumos distributions such as SmartOS, Omniosce, OpenIndiana and others.

=== System V compatibility ===
The System V interprocess communication mechanisms are available in Unix-like operating systems not derived from System V; in particular, in Linux (a reimplementation of Unix) as well as the BSD derivative FreeBSD. POSIX 2008 specifies a replacement for these interfaces.

FreeBSD maintains a binary compatibility layer for the COFF format, which allows FreeBSD to execute binaries compiled for some SVR3.2 derivatives such as SCO UNIX and Interactive UNIX. Modern System V, Linux, and BSD platforms use the ELF file format for natively compiled binaries.

<text>Live in the Classic City is the third live album released by American rock band Widespread Panic. The album was recorded over an April 2000 three-night run in their hometown of Athens, Georgia. It was released in June 2002 and features a mix of originals and cover songs, studded with guest performances from other star performers, including Derek Trucks, Bruce Hampton, and former R.E.M. drummer Bill Berry.

The collection revealed the full range of musical styles heard at a Widespread Panic show, from tight hook-laden songs to extended improvisational jams, with seven tracks breaking the ten-minute mark.

The album reached a peak position of #99 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and the Top Internet Albums chart.

This album is one of 10 &quot;live jam releases of this century&quot; according to the August issue of &quot;Guitar One&quot; magazine.

<doc id="598452" wikidata="Q3301501" url="?curid=598452" title="Filé powder">
<text>Filé powder, also called gumbo filé, is a spicy herb seasoning made from the dried and ground leaves of the North American sassafras tree &quot;(Sassafras albidum)&quot;.

== Culinary use ==
Filé powder is used in Louisiana Creole cuisine in the making of some types of gumbo, a thick Creole soup or stew often served over rice. Several different varieties exist. In New Orleans, what is known as Creole gumbo generally varies from house to house though still retaining its Native American origins. The Creoles of Cane River make a gumbo focused much more on filé. Filé can provide thickening when okra is not in season, in types of gumbo that use okra or a roux as a thickener for gumbo instead of filé. Sprinkled sparingly over gumbo as a seasoning and a thickening agent, filé powder adds a distinctive, earthy flavor and texture.

Filé powder is made by harvesting the young leaves and stems of the sassafras tree and grinding them. Filé powder is generally not added until after the vegetables and meats or seafood are finished cooking and removed from the heat source.

== History and etymology==
Choctaw Native Americans of the American South (Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana) were the first to use dried, ground sassafras leaves as a seasoning. The French word &quot;filé&quot; is the past participle of the verb &quot;filer&quot;, meaning (among other things) &quot;to turn into threads&quot;, &quot;to become ropy&quot;.

The name &quot;gumbo&quot; may derive from the word &quot;ki ngombo&quot;, often shortened to &quot;gombo&quot;, which meant okra in the Central Bantu dialect. Okra was a common thickener in soups and stews prepared by the African inhabitants of Louisiana, who were brought to the colony in large numbers beginning in 1719.

Some scholars have suggested that the gumbo was adapted from the West African soups and stews which were thickened with okra. Eventually, okra was replaced as a thickener with the traditional sassafras. The earliest known mention of the dish is from a transcript of the interrogation of an enslaved African woman named Comba in 1764. In it, she states that she gave &quot;un gombeau&quot; to another slave.

Other scholars have suggested that the name may derive from the Choctaw word for filé (kombo). Some early 20th century authors, most notably Celestine Eustis, suggested that gumbo including filé powder was an early special-occasion dish for native tribes. This is further implied by a late 18th-century Creole practice. At that time, rice was a luxury for many Creoles. They served gumbo over corn grits, a pairing common in the stews of native tribes.

== Health concerns ==
Safrole and sassafras oil have been banned by the FDA as a carcinogen since 1960 and cannot be used in food manufacture for this reason. According to a study published in 1997, sassafras leaves (from which filé is produced) do not contain detectable amounts of safrole.

== Cultural references ==
&quot;Filé gumbo&quot; is famously mentioned in the classic country song by Hank Williams Sr., &quot;Jambalaya (On the Bayou)&quot;, which held the number-one position on the U.S. country music charts for fourteen non-consecutive weeks in 1952. It was also mentioned in the song by Gene Watson, &quot;Love in the Hot Afternoon&quot;, which was a #3 country hit for the singer in 1975.

==Early life==
Kinnear was born on June 17, 1963, in Logansport, Indiana, to Suzanne (&quot;née&quot; Buck), a homemaker, and Edward Kinnear, a career diplomat who worked for the US State Department. He has two older brothers, James (born 1957) and Steven (born 1959). He is of Scottish-Irish descent.

Returning to the United States for a university education, he attended the University of Arizona, graduating in 1985 with a degree in broadcast journalism. While there, he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.

==Career==
Kinnear hosted a short-lived game show, &quot;College Mad House&quot;, which was spun off from the kids&#x27; show &quot;Fun House&quot;. He became the creator, co-executive producer and host of &quot;Best of the Worst&quot;, which aired from 1991 to 1992. In 1991, Kinnear became the first host of &quot;Talk Soup&quot;, which he hosted until 1995, when he left the show for the NBC late-night talk show &quot;Later with Greg Kinnear&quot; (1994).

After his film debut, &quot;Blankman&quot;, Kinnear won the part of David Larrabee in Sydney Pollack&#x27;s 1995 remake of Billy Wilder&#x27;s 1954 classic &quot;Sabrina&quot;.

Other films are &quot;Mystery Men&quot;, &quot;Nurse Betty&quot;, &quot;Loser&quot;, &quot;The Gift&quot; and &quot;Someone Like You&quot;. Kinnear often alternated roles, often playing good guys like a righteous principal in &quot;The Gift&quot; or a gay painter in &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;, to bad guys such as a sleazy college professor in &quot;Loser&quot;, a womanizer in &quot;Someone Like You&quot; as well as &quot;Sabrina&quot; and an egotistical soap opera star in &quot;Nurse Betty&quot;.

In 2002, Kinnear starred in &quot;Auto Focus&quot; about the life and murder of actor Bob Crane. Kinnear portrayed Crane.

Crandall in 2002&#x27;s &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; brought public attention to Crandall&#x27;s heroism during the 1965 Battle of Ia Drang. (On February 26, 2007, Crandall was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Bush.) In &quot;Baby Mama&quot;, Kinnear played Rob, a local smoothie shop owner and the romantic interest of Kate (Tina Fey).

In 2010, he starred as the estranged father of Miley Cyrus&#x27; character in &quot;The Last Song&quot;. In 2011, Kinnear starred in the miniseries &quot;The Kennedys&quot; playing the lead role as John F. Kennedy.

<doc id="598460" wikidata="Q1072082" url="?curid=598460" title="Vampire Hunter D">
<text>is a series of novels written by Japanese author Hideyuki Kikuchi and illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano since 1983.

As of January 2025, 56 novels have been published in the main series, with some novels comprising as many as four volumes. They have sold over 17 million copies worldwide, making &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; one of the best-selling book series in history. The series has also spawned anime, audio drama, manga, comic adaptations, a video game, as well as a short story collection, art books, and a supplemental guide book.

==Premise==
Vampire hunter D wanders through a far-future post-nuclear war Earth that combines elements of pulp genres: western, science fiction, horror and Lovecraftian horror, dark fantasy, folklore, and occult science. The planet, once terrified by the elegant but cruel vampires known as , ancient demons, mutants, and their technological creations, is now slowly returning to a semblance of order and human control—thanks in part to the decadence that brought about the downfall of the vampire race, to the continued stubbornness of frontier dwellers, and to the rise of a caste of independent hunters-for-hire who eliminate supernatural threats.

Some time in 1999, a nuclear war occurred. The Nobility were vampires that planned for a possible nuclear war and sequestered all that was needed to rebuild civilization in their shelters. They use their science combined with magic to restore the world in their image. Nearly all magical creatures on Earth are genetically engineered by the Nobility to possess seemingly supernatural abilities, regeneration, and biological immortality, with a very small number being demons, gods, aliens, and extradimensional beings who survived the holocaust. Despite their technology being advanced enough to create a blood substitute as food, they still prefer to feed on humans. As such, they created a civilization where vampires and humans coexisted, eventually developing the planet into parklands and cities. The society eventually stagnates when vampire technology perfects scientific prophecy, which determines they are at their zenith of existence and doomed to fall, overthrown by humans. The human race was transformed at this time, with fear for the vampires being woven into their genetics, and the inability to remember vampire weaknesses such as garlic and crucifixes.

Unlike vampires from traditional lore, the Nobility can reproduce sexually, although their offspring will permanently cease aging after reaching physical maturity, having inherited their vampire parent&#x27;s immortality.

==Main characters==
===D===

D is a &quot;dhampir&quot;, the half-breed child of a vampire father and human mother (actually genetically engineered by the ruler and first of vampires called Sacred Ancestor using his own DNA and that of humans in an experiment to create a vampire without vampires&#x27; typical weaknesses like the sun and having to drink blood), the ideal vampire hunter. He is renowned for his consummate skill and unearthly grace but feared and despised for his mixed lineage: born of both races but belonging to neither. Often underestimated by his opponents, D possesses surprising power and resourcefulness, having most of the strengths of the Nobility and only mild levels of their common weaknesses. It has been seen in both movies that his power is not only physical, but extends into the magical realm as well. His supernatural powers make him one of the strongest beings in the world, if not the second strongest (second only to his father). However, D prefers his physical abilities, only using his magic in times of great need. Unlike most dhampirs, D is able to live as a &quot;normal&quot; human; however, he is marked by his unearthly beauty and exceptionally potent aura and thus rarely accepted by human settlements. In terms of weaknesses, he is randomly susceptible to sun-sickness, a severe type of sunstroke, about once every five years (far less than most dhampirs). D also recovers from it at a rate far greater than other dhampirs. Usually, it takes several days to recover from sunlight syndrome, longer if the dhampir is exceedingly powerful, but D recovered in a few hours (around 1–6 hours approximately) despite being one of the strongest dhampirs alive. Otherwise, D does not appear to suffer from other vampiric weaknesses usual to dhampirs, being able to physically restrain opponents with his aura and having godlike reflexes surpassing even those of Nobles.

His symbiotic left hand states, in &quot;Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust&quot;: &quot;The Herarchy of us became impatient with the heartless David and impaled The Lord on &#x27;The Sword&#x27;&quot;. Speculation on whether &quot;The Sword&quot; is D&#x27;s sword or not is debatable. It is important to note here, however, that the movie differs sharply from the book it takes its story from, &quot;Vampire Hunter D: Demon Deathchase&quot;, and future entries in the novel series do not differentiate between Dracula, The Vampire King, The Sacred Ancestor and D&#x27;s father, proposing that they are one and the same.

D rides a cybernetic horse with mechanical legs and other enhancements, wields a crescent longsword which looks similar to Yoshitaka Amano&#x27;s scimitar sword design found in many of his works of art, but the sword has a hefty length, similar to that of a Japanese nodachi. D always wears a mystical blue pendant; it prevents many of the automatic defenses (such as laser fields and small nuclear blasters) created by the Nobility in past millennia from working properly and allows him to enter their sealed castles. He also uses wooden needles in the novels and game, which he can throw with super speed. He protects his milk-white face from the noonday sun with long black hair, flowing black clothing and cape, and the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat. D is described as appearing as a youth between 17 and 18 years old, though D&#x27;s age is unknown (although in the novel &quot;Pale Fallen Angel&quot; parts I and II, it is made known that he is at least 5,000 years old, and later it is revealed that he is over 10,000 years old). His beauty is mesmerizing, often unintentionally wooing women and sometimes flustering men.

Very little is known of D&#x27;s past, and the identity of his parents is ambiguous, but his innate power suggests that his father is an extraordinarily powerful vampire. Regarding D&#x27;s birth, some Nobles whisper dark rumors about their vampire progenitor, the Sacred Ancestor known as Count Dracula, bedding a human woman called &quot;Mina the Fair&quot; (implied to be Mina Harker). Dracula conducted bizarre crossbreeding experiments involving himself and countless human women or even other vampires. The only successful product of the experiments was D. D, wanting nothing to do with his father save for killing him, refusing to go by his true name. Instead, he shortens it to the first letter. In &quot;Twin Shadowed Knight&quot;, D has a twin who goes unnamed. The twin states that he and D were born from the same woman in exactly the same conditions.

===Left Hand===

D is the host for a sentient symbiote, Left Hand, a wisecracking homunculus with a human face residing in his left palm, who can suck in massive amounts of matter through a wind void or vacuum tunnel. Left Hand enjoys needling the poker-faced D, but only appears as needed, rarely witnessed or heard by anyone other than D, yet aware of many of D&#x27;s thoughts and actions. At all other times, D&#x27;s left hand appears normal. Besides providing a contrast to D&#x27;s reserved demeanor, Left Hand is incredibly useful, possessing many mysterious powers such as psychometry, inducing sleep, hypnotizing others, determining the medical condition of a victim, absorbing matter, energy, and even souls and magic, healing and reviving D and himself, and the ability to size up the supernatural powers or prowess of an enemy, even beyond D&#x27;s keen senses. After absorbing four elements, Left Hand can use them to generate powerful attacks, regenerate D and himself, and to transform D into full vampire state rivaling Sacred Ancestor. Left Hand can store absorbed objects in a pocket dimension inside his stomach, and later spit them out.

In the first and second novels, Left Hand can also revive D when his physical condition is suffering, by consuming the four elements and converting the resulting energy into life force. This ability even saved D from the usually fatal for vampires stake through the heart he received from Rei-Ginsei in the first novel. Left Hand has its own mind and will, and acts as D&#x27;s guide and sole permanent companion, providing a reservoir of knowledge pertaining to the lost Noble culture. So far, Left Hand&#x27;s origins are unknown, and it is unclear how they came to be joined. However, some of its nature is revealed in the third book, which features a similar creature; it is implied he was one of the Barbarois (mutant/demon hybrids) who served in the personal retinue of the Sacred Ancestor, and was experimented on by him to increase his powers over other Barbarois.

===Sacred Ancestor===
The Sacred Ancestor&#x27;s role in the novels is very mixed, appearing both as the bane and savior to isolated towns, and deified as a legendary god-king to the vampires, many of whom have never even met him in person. D quotes the Sacred Ancestor&#x27;s precepts (&quot;Transient guests are we&quot;—implied to refer to the Nobility) in the first novel. The Sacred Ancestor appears both as a lawgiver honored for his intelligence, who showed some interest in preserving humans, and as a ruthless scientist (in the second novel), conducting hybrid breeding experiments with humans in order to perpetuate his own dwindling species. D appears to have encountered his alleged father on at least one occasion, as when at times D reaches a place where the imprint of the Sacred Ancestor&#x27;s power remains, D remembers the Sacred Ancestor telling him that &quot;You are my only success.&quot; Like D, the Sacred Ancestor is portrayed as a mysterious and handsome young wanderer who deals with both life and death. However, in the English dub of the anime, D states that the Sacred Ancestor respected humanity and did not feed on innocent people.

==Production==
In the postscript of the first &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; novel, Hideyuki Kikuchi cited Hammer Films&#x27; &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot; (1958) as his first inspiration in horror. He also praised horror manga artist Osamu Kishimoto for his distinct style, that he described as &quot;a gothic mood in the Western tradition&quot;. Kikuchi is famous for writing his manuscripts by hand. Having written the &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; series for 40 years, the author has previously admitted that he does not remember all of its mythology, only that of a couple of volumes, and therefore one might find some contradictions in it. Kikuchi explained that the two points he is always careful of are, not to &quot;mix up the characteristics of D&quot;, and &quot;not to lose sight of the purpose of the journey&quot;. When asked if the Sacred Ancestor will ever be given a larger role, Kikuchi said the character &quot;will come out someday&quot; and &quot;When that happens, please expect that to be your warning that &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; is speeding toward an ending&quot;. The author has previously said that he has &quot;a final conflict for D&quot; in mind, but that final conflict will not be the entire ending of the series.

==Publication history==
Beginning in January 1983, Kikuchi has written 41 &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; novels spanning 53 volumes as of April 2023. All of the publications in the series were published by Asahi Sonorama until the branch went out of business in September 2007. The release of &quot;D – Throng of Heretics&quot; in October 2007 under the Asahi Bunko – Sonorama Selection label marked the transition to the new publisher, Asahi Shimbun Publishing, a division of Asahi Sonorama&#x27;s parent company. From December 2007 through January 2008, Asahi Shimbun Publishing reprinted the complete &quot;Vampire Hunter&quot; catalogue under the Sonorama Selection label.

On May 11, 2005, the first official English translation was released under DH Press, translated by Kevin Leahy. As of 2020, 24 novels have been published in English, spanning 29 volumes. In 2021, Dark Horse began releasing the series in an omnibus format. The first volume, featuring the first three novels, was released on October 27, 2021. In December 2021, Dark Horse Comics in partnership with GraphicAudio began publishing dramatized audiobook adaptations of the &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; novel series featuring a full English voice cast, soundtrack, and sound effects.

In January 2011, Hideyuki Kikuchi published the first spinoff set in the &quot;Vampire Hunter&quot; universe, a series of prequels titled , illustrated by Ayami Kojima, artist and character designer for the &quot;Castlevania&quot; series of video games. It takes place over 5,000 years before &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; and focuses on expanding the history of the Nobility, following the exploits of the vampire warrior Lord Greylancer. In 2013, Viz Media&#x27;s Haikasoru imprint released the first official English translation of the prequel series, retitled &quot;Noble V: Greylancer&quot;, translated by Takami Nieda with newly commissioned cover artwork by Vincent Chong.

==Adaptations==

===1985 animated film===

&quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; remains a cult classic among English-speaking audiences. Billed by the Japanese producers as a &quot;dark future science-fiction romance&quot; &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; is set in the year 12,090 AD, in a post-nuclear holocaust world where vampires, mutants and demons &quot;slither through a world of darkness&quot; (in the words of the film&#x27;s opening introduction).

===1988–1990 audio dramas===
Asashi Sonorama created audio drama adaptations of three of the novels, in five parts:
# &quot;Raiser of Gales &quot;D&quot;&quot; (January 1988) (the book it was based on was published May 1984)
# &quot;D – Demon Deathchase&quot; (June 1988)
# &quot;D – Mysterious Journey to the North Sea I: To the North Sea&quot; (March 1990)
# &quot;D – Mysterious Journey to the North Sea II: Summer at Last&quot; (May 1990)
# &quot;D – Mysterious Journey to the North Sea III: When Winter Comes Again&quot; (June 1990).

Most of the voice cast for the original OVA reprised their roles. Originally released on cassette tape, in 2005 they were re-released as a special edition, five-disc &quot;Vampire Hunter D Audio Drama Box&quot;, including a small supplemental booklet with a new short story by Kikuchi and an &quot;art cloth&quot; with an illustration by Amano.

===1999 video game===

A video game based on &quot;Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust&quot; was also made for the PlayStation game console, titled &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot;. It is a survival horror game, but also similar to a standard adventure title. The player can see D from different pre-rendered angles throughout the game, and allow D to attack enemies with his sword. D can also use magic, Left Hand&#x27;s abilities, and items. The story of the game is similar to that of &quot;Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust&quot;, although it takes place entirely within the castle as D fights all the enemies. Only two of the Barbarois mutants appear as enemies. There are three endings, one of which is similar to the end of the anime.

===2000 animated film===

The second film, &quot;Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust&quot; garnered respect for its advanced animation techniques, detailed art style and character designs, voice acting originally recorded in English (English voice casting/direction by Jack Fletcher), and its sophisticated orchestral soundtrack composed, arranged and conducted by Marco D&#x27;Ambrosio. Its art style closely mirrored that of the illustrator and original character designer of the first movie, Yoshitaka Amano.

The storyline features a larger cast than the first film. The second Vampire Hunter D movie (known as &quot;Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust&quot; outside of Japan) is based on the third of Hideyuki Kikuchi&#x27;s Vampire Hunter D novels (&quot;Demon Deathchase&quot; in English). Unlike the first film, which was released in 1985, this movie is rated NC-16 in Singapore, M in Australia, 15 in the UK, R13 in New Zealand and R for violence/gore in the USA (except for the Blu-ray release, which is unrated).

===2007 manga adaptation===
In November 2007, the first volume of Saiko Takaki&#x27;s manga adaptation of Hideyuki Kikuchi&#x27;s series was published simultaneously in the U.S., Japan, and Europe. The project, overseen by Digital Manga Publishing and Hideyuki Kikuchi, aimed to adapt the entire catalogue of &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; novels into a manga form, however it had concluded after the eighth volume 

===2022 comic book series===
On June 30, 2016, a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for a five-issue &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; comic book series titled &quot;Vampire Hunter D: Message from Mars&quot; was announced. Published by Stranger Comics with supervision from series creator Hideyuki Kikuchi and support from the creative teams at Unified Pictures and Digital Frontier, &quot;Message from Mars&quot; is an adaptation of the 2005 short story &quot;Message from Cecile&quot; and acts as a prequel to the then-in-development animated series. The series is written by Brandon M. Easton and illustrated by Michael Broussard, with visual development by Christopher Shy. The campaign&#x27;s stretch goals also include an official &quot;Vampire Hunter D Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot; supplement written by F. Wesley Schneider. The campaign reached its $25,000 funding goal on July 1, 2016, and its initial $50,000 stretch goal on July 7, 2016. The campaign concluded on August 9, 2016, with 1,736 backers pledging a total of $107,025, reaching four out of five stretch goals.

Following the first issue the series was placed on temporary hiatus due to a serious medical emergency in Broussard&#x27;s family, resuming production in early 2018 with new artists Ryan Benjamin and Richard Friend. As of December 2020 all production work for the five-issue run is complete, but publication plans were placed on an indefinite hiatus due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2021 the completion of the project was announced via Kickstarter update, with limited publication planned to begin in 2022 following a recovery from pandemic conditions, to be followed by a wide retail and digital release in the future. The graphic novel Kickstarter campaign was launched on January 26, 2022, offering a limited hardcover collector&#x27;s edition, variant cover single issue editions, and a digital edition. The campaign achieved its initial $30,000 funding goal within 90 minutes, and surpassed $100,000 within the first day, concluding on February 19, 2020, with 4,095 backers pledging a total of $445,205.

===Development of animated series===
In June 2015, a new animated series tentatively titled &quot;Vampire Hunter D: Resurrection&quot; was announced, produced by Unified Pictures and Digital Frontier. The series would be produced by Kurt Rauer and Scott McLean, and directed by Yoichi Mori, with &quot;Bloodlust&quot; director Yoshiaki Kawajiri acting as supervising director and series creator Hideyuki Kikuchi providing editorial supervision. The series was currently in pre-production, and is developed as an hour-long serial drama with the intent of being broadcast on a major American cable network or on-demand provider, with Japanese distribution to follow. As of June 2016 the series is still in pre-production, with plans to begin shipping the project to distributors by the end of the year. Given the abundance of source material, the current plan is to produce as many as seven seasons, without revisiting the source material that was adapted into the first two films. In February 2018 it was announced that the pilot episode would be written by Brandon M. Easton, writer for the &quot;Message from Mars&quot; comic book series. The first draft of the pilot was completed in October 2018. Pre-production on the series was put on hold in early 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Other media===
In July 2008, Devils Due Publishing announced that it had acquired the rights to publish an English-language &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; comic book mini-series titled &quot;Vampire Hunter D: American Wasteland,&quot; to be written by Jimmy Palmiotti and pencilled by Tim Seeley, however the project was cancelled in 2009. Intended to infuse the standard &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; formula and mythos with more Western sensibilities, it would have told an original story about D departing the Frontier to embark on a journey to a new land still ruled by the vampiric Nobility.

In 2010, it was reported in Japanese horror magazine &quot;Rue Morgue&quot; that Hideyuki Kikuchi was in talks with one of the producers for Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil&quot; video game series to develop a live-action &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; adaptation.

==Reception==
By 2008, the &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; novels had sold over 17 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling book series in history. Theron Martin of Anime News Network called the first novel &quot;a competent vampire-hunting story with enough strong points to balance out its weaknesses&quot; and gave it a B rating. He praised the setting as a wholly credible world ruled by vampires and grounded in science fiction, rather than fantasy or the supernatural. However, he called the plotting &quot;fairly rudimentary&quot; and a standard tale of a hero and heroine struggling against colorful opposition coming from different directions, where even the few twists are hardly unique. While Martin praised the characters of Doris and Rei-Ginsei, he criticized D and Count Magnus Lee as having weak characterizations. His colleague Rebecca Silverman also strongly praised the world and setting of the first three &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; novels, finding it to clearly be a post-apocalyptic &quot;version of our reality&quot; that in many ways is just as much a character as D. She wrote that the books are &quot;practically dripping with atmosphere&quot; as the story&#x27;s descriptions are florid and detailed. In her four out of five stars review, Silverman did note that the series could sometimes feel melodramatic and criticized most of the heroines as outdated. Reviewing the first three novels for Anime UK News, Ian Wolf gave the series an 8/10 rating and wrote &quot;Vampire Hunter D is an entertaining read, mixing elements of many different genres to create something very different from what is often available.&quot; He noted that D&#x27;s Left Hand adds some comedy to the overall dark tone of the series.

For his portrayal of bail bondsman Max Cherry in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; (1997), he was nominated for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. 

Forster played a variety of both leading and supporting roles in over 100 films, including Captain Dan Holland in &quot;The Black Hole&quot; (1979), Detective David Madison in &quot;Alligator&quot; (1980), Abdul Rafai in &quot;The Delta Force&quot; (1986), Colonel Partington in &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot; (2000), Scott Thorson in &quot;The Descendants&quot; (2011), General Edward Clegg in &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot; (2013) and its sequel &quot;London Has Fallen&quot; (2016), Norbert Everhardt in &quot;What They Had&quot; (2018), and Sheriff Hadley in &quot;The Wolf of Snow Hollow&quot; (2020). 

He also had prominent roles in television series such as &quot;Banyon&quot; (1971–73), &quot;Nakia&quot; (1974), &quot;Karen Sisco&quot; (2003–04), &quot;Heroes&quot; (2007–08), &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot; (2017) and the &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; episode &quot;Granite State&quot; as Ed &quot;The Disappearer&quot; Galbraith, for which he won the Saturn Award for Best Guest Starring Role on Television. He reprised the role in the film &quot;El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie&quot; (2019) and &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; (2020).

== Early life ==
Forster was born and raised in Rochester, New York. His mother was Italian American, while his father was of English and Irish descent. He earned a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Psychology from the University of Rochester. He performed in a number of plays in college, and decided to become an actor. 

Forster added an &quot;R&quot; to his surname as there was another member of the Screen Actors Guild named Robert Foster.

== Career ==
===Early stardom===
Forster made his Broadway debut in 1965 in &quot;Mrs. Dally Had a Lover,&quot; opposite Arlene Francis and Ralph Meeker. He also starred in productions of &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot;, &quot;The Big Knife&quot;, and &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;. 

Forster&#x27;s movie career began strongly, when John Huston cast him in the important role of Private Williams in &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; (1967), opposite Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando; there was a scene where Forster rode naked on a horse which became famous. Forster also appeared in episodes of the TV series &quot;N.Y.P.D.&quot;, &quot;Judd for the Defense&quot; and &quot;Premiere&quot;, the latter also featuring Dustin Hoffman and Sally Kellerman. Forster was then cast in another key role in an important movie: part-Indian Army scout Nick Tana in Robert Mulligan&#x27;s &quot;The Stalking Moon&quot; (1968); he was billed third, after Gregory Peck and Eva Marie Saint.

Forster had a key support role in &quot;Justine&quot; (1969), directed by George Cukor and starring Dirk Bogarde, which was a huge flop. He starred in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Medium Cool&quot; (1969), which was also a big hit commercially. 

Forster played a tormented priest in &quot;Pieces of Dreams&quot; (1970) and a student filmmaker in &quot;Cover Me Babe&quot; (1970), which was a box office flop. He was cast in the pilot for a TV series &quot;Banyon&quot;, playing a private eye in late 1930s in Los Angeles. then starred in &quot;Journey Through Rosebud&quot; which was not released theatrically. He directed for the Rochester Community Theatre.

A year after the pilot for &quot;Banyon&quot; was made, it was picked up for a series but had only a short run. After this cancellation Forster said his career &quot;started to slip and then it slipped and then it slipped.&quot;

In 1973, he briefly returned to Broadway playing Stanley Kowalski in a revival of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, opposite Julie Harris. He also played Juror No. 3 in the first New York stage production of &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; at the Queens Playhouse.

===Career slump===
After a support part in &quot;The Don Is Dead&quot; (1972), Forster starred in the TV movie &quot;The Death Squad&quot; (1974) then another short-lived TV series, &quot;Nakia&quot; (1974), playing a Navajo detective. 

Forster guest starred on shows such as &quot;Medical Story&quot;, &quot;Gibbsville&quot; and &quot;Police Story&quot; and played the lead in the TV movies &quot;Royce&quot; (1976), &quot;The City&quot; (1977) (with Don Johnson), &quot;Standing Tall&quot; and &quot;The Darker Side of Terror&quot; (1979). He toured in a stage production of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; and appeared in &quot;The Sea Horse&quot; on stage in Louisville.

Forster moved into lower-budgeted movies, starring in &quot;Stunts&quot; (1977) for Mark L. Lester and &quot;Avalanche&quot; (1978), the latter opposite Rock Hudson and Mia Farrow for Roger Corman&#x27;s New World Pictures. Also for New World, Forster had an unbilled cameo in &quot;The Lady in Red&quot; (1979). This was written by John Sayles and directed by Lewis Teague who later collaborated on &quot;Alligator&quot; (1980), which starred Forster. He played a key support role in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Black Hole&quot; (1979).

Throughout the 1980s Forster alternated between television and low budget films. He was in the comedy &quot;Heartbreak High&quot; (1981), and the action films &quot;Vigilante&quot; (1983), &quot;Walking the Edge&quot; (1985), &quot;The Delta Force&quot; (1986), and &quot;Counterforce&quot; (1988). He wrote, starred in, produced and directed &quot;Hollywood Harry&quot; (1985), in which he invested all his savings. That year he stated &quot;Not one of my movies made a dime. I&#x27;ve never had anything that approached a hit in my entire career of 15 movies and a lot of TV shows.&quot;

Forster appeared in the thrillers &quot;Satan&#x27;s Princess&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Banker&quot; (1989), the mini series &quot;Goliath Awaits&quot; (1981), and episodes of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;Crossbow&quot;, and &quot;Jesse Hawkes&quot;. He was in the TV movie &quot;Mick and Frankie&quot; (1989).

Forster&#x27;s films by this stage were almost entirely low budget ones: &quot;Peacemaker&quot; (1990), &quot;Checkered Flag&quot; (1990), &quot;Countdown to Esmeralda Bay&quot; (1990), &quot;Long Way Back&quot; (1990), &quot;Committed&quot; (1991), &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot; (1991), &quot;29th Street&quot; (1991), &quot;In Between&quot; (1992), &quot;In the Shadow of a Killer&quot; (1992), &quot;Maniac Cop 3: Badge of Silence&quot; (1993), &quot;South Beach&quot; (1993), &quot;American Yakuza&quot; (1993), &quot;Cover Story &quot; (1993), &quot;Point of Seduction: Body Chemistry III&quot; (1993), &quot;Scanner Cop II&quot; (1995), &quot;Guns &amp; Lipstick&quot; (1995), &quot;The Method&quot; (1995), &quot;Original Gangstas&quot; (1996) (directed by Larry Cohen), &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; (1996), &quot;Hindsight&quot; (1996) and &quot;American Perfekt&quot; (1997).

He appeared in series such as &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot;, &quot;P.S.I. Luv U&quot;, &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;One West Waikiki&quot; and &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;.

===&quot;Jackie Brown&quot; and later work===
Forster appeared in &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; as bail bondsman Max Cherry, which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1997. &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; revitalized Forster&#x27;s career, an effect that occurred for many actors appearing in Quentin Tarantino films. He subsequently had consistent work in the film industry, appearing in &quot;Like Mike&quot;, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, &quot;Supernova&quot;, &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot; (2000), &quot;Human Natyre&quot; (2001), &quot;Confidence&quot; (2003), &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; (2003), &quot;Lucky Number Slevin&quot; (2006), and &quot;Firewall&quot; (2006). 

Forster continued to appear in lower budgeted productions like &quot;Night Vision&quot; (1997) along with the remakes of &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1998) and &quot;Psycho&quot; (1998).

He appeared in the made-for-television movie &quot;The Hunt for the BTK Killer&quot;, as the detective intent on capturing serial killer Dennis Rader. Forster also played the father of Van on the short-lived Fox series &quot;Fastlane&quot;.

Forster recorded a public service announcement for Deejay Ra&#x27;s Hip-Hop Literacy campaign, encouraging reading of books by Elmore Leonard, whose book &quot;Rum Punch&quot; was adapted as &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;.

He appeared in the hit NBC series &quot;Heroes&quot; as Arthur Petrelli, the father of Nathan and Peter Petrelli, as well as the Emmy Award-winning AMC crime drama &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; as Walter White&#x27;s new-identity specialist Ed Galbraith (a role he reprised in &quot;El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie&quot; and &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;). He played Bud Baxter, father to Tim Allen&#x27;s Mike Baxter, on the ABC (later Fox) hit comedy &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;. Forster was also a motivational speaker.

He was the first choice to play Sheriff Harry S. Truman in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, but had to turn it down due to a prior commitment to a different television pilot, and was replaced by Michael Ontkean. He appeared in Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, a pilot for a TV series that was not picked up but was later turned into a critically acclaimed movie, and finally appeared in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, playing the brother of Sheriff Harry S. Truman, Sheriff Frank Truman, in &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot;, when Ontkean was not available to reprise his role. 

About this, Forster said: &quot;David Lynch, what a good guy he is. He wanted to hire me for the original, 25 years ago, for a part, and I was committed to another guy for a pilot that never went. So I didn&#x27;t do the original &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, which would have been a life-changer. It&#x27;s a gigantic hit if you remember those years, a phenomenon. But I didn&#x27;t do that. [...] And this time, I got a call from my agents and they said, David Lynch is going to call you. When he called me five minutes later, he said, &quot;I&#x27;d like you to come and work with me again.&quot; And I said, &#x27;Whatever it is, David, here I come!&#x27;&quot;

Forster appeared in the TV series &quot;Alcatraz&quot;.

His final movie appearance was
in &quot;El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie&quot;, reprising the character of Ed the &quot;Disappearer&quot; from the &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; series. He died on the day the movie was released. According to Aaron Paul (the actor for Jesse Pinkman), they spoke on the day of his death. Forster had been able to see the film. Four months later, Forster again appeared posthumously as Ed in episode &quot;Magic Man&quot; of the fifth season of &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;. The episode ended with a dedication to &quot;our friend Robert Forster.&quot; He also appeared in an episode &quot;Dynoman and The Volt&quot; of the rebooted &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; television series before his death; the episode was dedicated to Forster.

== Personal life ==
Forster was married to June Forster (née Provenzano) from 1966 to 1975. The couple had met at their alma mater, the University of Rochester. The marriage produced three daughters. Robert was married to Zivia Forster from 1978 to 1980. He also had a son from a previous relationship. From 2004 to the time of his death, his longtime partner was Denise Grayson. He was a member of the high-IQ Triple Nine Society.

== Death ==
In June 2019, Forster was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and he died from the disease at his home in Los Angeles on October 11, 2019, at the age of 78, on the day &quot;El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie&quot; was released.

<text>Calogero Lorenzo &quot;Chazz&quot; Palminteri (born May 15, 1952) is an American actor. He is best known for his film roles in &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; (1993), based on his play of the same name, &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; (1994) for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and 
&quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995), as well as his recurring role as Shorty in &quot;Modern Family&quot; (2010–2019). 

His other films include &quot;Mulholland Falls&quot; (1996), &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; (1998), &quot;Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp&#x27;s Adventure&quot; (2001), &quot;Little Man&quot; (2006), &quot;Once Upon a Time in Queens&quot; (2013), and &quot;Legend&quot; (2015). He is also known for his recurring roles in &quot;Wiseguy&quot; (1989), &quot;Kojak&quot; (2005), &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot; (2010–2014) and &quot;Godfather of Harlem&quot; (2019–2021).

==Early life==
Calogero Lorenzo Palminteri was born on May 15, 1952, in The Bronx, New York. He is the son of Rose (née Anello) (1921–2016), a homemaker and Lorenzo Palminteri (1919–2008), a bus driver. He was raised in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx. Palminteri is of Sicilian descent. All four of his grandparents were born in Sicily and emigrated to the United States. Both of his parents were born in New York, NY. His paternal grandparents, Calogero Palminteri and Rosa Bonfante, married in 1908 and emigrated in 1910 from Menfi in the province of Agrigento, Sicily. At the age of nine, Palminteri allegedly witnessed the murder of a mobster in front of his apartment building; the police questioned him, but he maintained that he did not see the incident. He graduated from Theodore Roosevelt high school in the Bronx in 1965.

He struggled to become an actor, splitting his time between acting in off-Broadway plays and moonlighting as a bouncer, alongside Dolph Lundgren. In 1988, Palminteri was working at a New York nightclub where a party was being thrown for Hollywood talent agent and dealmaker Irving Paul &quot;Swifty&quot; Lazar. When Lazar tried to enter, Palminteri stopped him as he did not know who he was. Lazar got him fired which led to the broke (and unemployed) Palminteri writing &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; for himself to star in since he was not being offered any work.

==Career==
===Theater===
Palminteri starred on Broadway in &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot;, the autobiographical one-man show based on his childhood that he first performed at Theatre West in Los Angeles in 1989. Palminteri states that he began writing the play after being fired for refusing entry to super agent Swifty. The Broadway production, directed by Jerry Zaks and with music by John Gromada, began previews October 4, 1988, at the Walter Kerr Theatre and opened on October 25, running for 18 weeks. Palminteri plays 18 roles in &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot;, which depicts a rough childhood on the streets of the Bronx. The play ran for two months at Playhouse 91 in 1989.

Palminteri starred opposite Kenny D&#x27;Aquila in D&#x27;Aquila&#x27;s play, &quot;Unorganized Crime&quot;. Palminteri always appreciated the shot that Robert De Niro gave him, so he in turn agreed to star in D&#x27;Aquila&#x27;s mafia-themed drama.

Palminteri performed in the Broadway musical version of &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; in 2018.

===Film career===
Robert De Niro saw Palminteri&#x27;s Broadway show of &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; in 1990, and the two partnered together to adapt the play into a film. Palminteri created the screenplay and starred as Sonny, the gangster Calogero meets, while De Niro directed the film, making his directorial debut, and co-starring as Lorenzo, Calogero&#x27;s father. The film was a commercial and critical success. In 1994, Palminteri played mob henchman Cheech in the black comedy film &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Palminteri also had performances in films such as &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, &quot;The Perez Family&quot;, &quot;Jade&quot;, and &quot;Diabolique&quot;, as well as comedic roles in films such as &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Analyze This&quot; and &quot;Down to Earth&quot;.

During its run, he appeared in many advertisements for Vanilla Coke, in which he portrayed a mob boss who would threaten celebrities if they did not praise the taste of the product in question, and then let them walk away with the Vanilla Coke to &quot;reward their curiosity&quot;, touching on its slogan at the time. Palminteri has voiced characters in various animated films, the most notable being Smokey in &quot;Stuart Little&quot; and Woolworth in &quot;Hoodwinked&quot;.

He made his directorial debut with an episode of &quot;Oz&quot;, then the television film &quot;Women vs. Men&quot; and the 2004 feature film &quot;Noel&quot;.

Palminteri&#x27;s recent acting efforts include &quot;A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints&quot;, &quot;Running Scared&quot;, and &quot;Arthur and the Minimoys&quot;.

In 2004, he received the &quot;Indie Hero Award&quot; from the Method Fest Independent Film Festival for his artistic achievements in film.

===Television===
On January 20, 2010, Palminteri guested on &quot;Modern Family&quot; and played the same character on the November 2, 2011, episode. Palminteri has reprised the role twice more in season 5. In June 2010, Palminteri began guest-starring on the TNT crime drama &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot; as Frank Rizzoli, Sr. He guest starred twice on the CBS drama &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; as Angelo Gallo, a mob lawyer and childhood friend of main character Frank Reagan.

Palminteri portrayed deceased mobster Paul Castellano in the 2001 TV film &quot;Boss of Bosses&quot;.

===Other work===
In 2011, Palminteri opened a restaurant, Chazz: A Bronx Original, in Baltimore&#x27;s Little Italy neighborhood; their main foods are coal-fired pizza and Italian food. However, the restaurant closed in 2015. Palminteri opened an Italian restaurant, Chazz Palminteri Ristorante Italiano, in New York City on Second Avenue. Also, Palminteri did the voice acting for the &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot; character Sal De Luca in the zombies map &quot;Mob of the Dead&quot;, and his likeness was used for the character as well.

On February 15, 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Palminteri launched &quot;The Chazz Palminteri Show&quot; podcast on YouTube. Palmintieri&#x27;s guests on the podcast have included William Baldwin, Kathrine Narducci, Fat Joe, Mario Cantone, and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal.

==Personal life==
Palminteri lives in Westchester County, New York, in the town of Bedford. He describes himself as a &quot;very spiritual&quot;, devout Roman Catholic. He married Gianna Ranaudo in 1992, and together they have two children. He is a self-avowed New York Yankees fan.

<text>The pulmonary circulation is a division of the circulatory system in all vertebrates. The circuit begins with deoxygenated blood returned from the body to the right atrium of the heart where it is pumped out from the right ventricle to the lungs. In the lungs the blood is oxygenated and returned to the left atrium to complete the circuit.

The other division of the circulatory system is the systemic circulation that begins with receiving the oxygenated blood from the pulmonary circulation into the left atrium. From the atrium the oxygenated blood enters the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the rest of the body, returning as deoxygenated blood back to the pulmonary circulation.

The blood vessels of the pulmonary circulation are the pulmonary arteries and the pulmonary veins.

A separate circulatory circuit known as the bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated blood to the tissue of the larger airways of the lung.

== Structure ==
De-oxygenated blood leaves the heart, goes to the lungs, and then enters back into the heart. De-oxygenated blood leaves through the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery. From the right atrium, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve (or right atrioventricular valve) into the right ventricle. Blood is then pumped from the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery.
===Lungs===
The pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs, where carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is picked up during respiration. Arteries are further divided into very fine capillaries which are extremely thin-walled. The pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart. The pulmonary arteries have both an internal and external elastic membrane, whereas pulmonary veins have a single (outer) elastic layer.

===Veins===

Oxygenated blood leaves the lungs through pulmonary veins, which return it to the left part of the heart, completing the pulmonary cycle. This blood then enters the left atrium, which pumps it through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. From the left ventricle, the blood passes through the aortic valve to the aorta. The blood is then distributed to the body through the systemic circulation before returning again to the pulmonary circulation.

===Arteries===

From the right ventricle, blood is pumped through the semilunar pulmonary valve into the left and right main pulmonary artery (one for each lung), which branch into smaller pulmonary arteries that spread throughout the lungs.

==Development==
The pulmonary circulation loop is virtually bypassed in fetal circulation. The fetal lungs are collapsed, and blood passes from the right atrium directly into the left atrium through the foramen ovale (an open conduit between the paired atria) or through the ductus arteriosus (a shunt between the pulmonary artery and the aorta).

When the lungs expand at birth, the pulmonary pressure drops and blood is drawn from the right atrium into the right ventricle and through the pulmonary circuit. Over the course of several months, the foramen ovale closes, leaving a shallow depression known as the fossa ovalis.

==Clinical significance==
A number of medical conditions may affect the pulmonary circulation:
* Pulmonary hypertension describes an increase in resistance in the pulmonary arteries.
* Pulmonary embolism is occlusion or partial occlusion of the pulmonary artery or its branches by an embolus, usually from the embolization of a blood clot from deep vein thrombosis. It can cause difficulty breathing or chest pain, is usually diagnosed through a CT pulmonary angiography or V/Q scan, and is often treated with anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin.
* Cardiac shunt is an unnatural connection between parts of the heart that leads to blood flow that bypasses the lungs.
* Vascular resistance
* Pulmonary shunt

==History==

The pulmonary circulation is archaically known as the &quot;lesser circulation&quot; which is still used in non-English literature.

The discovery of the pulmonary circulation has been attributed to many scientists with credit distributed in varying ratios by varying sources. In much of modern medical literature, the discovery is credited to English physician William Harvey (1578 – 1657 CE) based on the comprehensive completeness and correctness of his model, despite its relative recency. Other sources credit one or more of Greek philosopher Hippocrates (460 – 370 BCE), Arab physician Ibn al-Nafis (1213 – 1288 CE), Syrian physician Qusta ibn Luqa or Spanish physician Michael Servetus (c. 1509 – 1553 CE). Several figures such as Hippocrates and al-Nafis receive credit for accurately predicting or developing specific elements of the modern model of pulmonary circulation: Hippocrates for being the first to describe pulmonary circulation as a discrete system separable from systemic circulation as a whole and al-Nafis for making great strides over the understanding of those before him and towards a rigorous model. There is a great deal of subjectivity involved in deciding at which point a complex system is &quot;discovered&quot;, as it is typically elucidated in piecemeal form so that the very first description, most complete or accurate description, and the most significant forward leaps in understanding are all considered acts of discovery of varying significance.

Early descriptions of the cardiovascular system are found throughout several ancient cultures. The earliest known description of the role of air in circulation was produced in Egypt in 3500 BCE. At the time, the Egyptians believed that the heart was the origin of many channels that connected different parts of the body to each other and transported air – as well as urine, blood, and the soul – between them. The Edwin Smith Papyrus (1700 BCE), named for American Egyptologist Edwin Smith (1822 – 1906 CE) who purchased the scroll in 1862, provided evidence that Egyptians believed that the heartbeat created a pulse that transported the above substances throughout the body. A second scroll, the Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE), also emphasized the importance of the heart and its connection to vessels throughout the body and described methods to detect cardiac disease through pulse abnormalities. Although they had knowledge of the heartbeat, vessels, and pulse, the Egyptians attributed the movement of substances through the vessels to air that resided in these channels, rather than to the heart&#x27;s exertion of pressure. The Egyptians knew that air played an important role in circulation but did not yet have a conception of the role of the lungs.

The next addition to the historical understanding of pulmonary circulation arrived with the Ancient Greeks. Physician Alcmaeon (520 – 450 BCE) proposed that the brain, not the heart, was the connection point for all of the vessels in the body. He believed that the function of these vessels was to bring the &quot;spirit&quot; (&quot;pneuma&quot;) and air to the brain. Empedocles (492 – 432 BCE), a philosopher, proposed a series of pipes, impermeable to blood but continuous with blood vessels, that carried the pneuma throughout the body. He proposed that this spirit was internalized by pulmonary respiration.

Hippocrates was the first to describe pulmonary circulation as a discrete system, separable from systemic circulation, in his &quot;Corpus Hippocraticum&quot;, which is often regarded as the foundational text of modern medicine. Hippocrates developed the view that the liver and spleen produced blood, and that this traveled to the heart to be cooled by the lungs that surrounded it. He described the heart as having two ventricles connected by an interventricular septum, and depicted the heart as the nexus point of all of the vessels of the body. He proposed that some vessels carried only blood and that others carried only air. He hypothesized that these air-carrying vessels were divisible into the pulmonary veins, which carried in air to the left ventricle, and the pulmonary artery, which carried in air to the right ventricle and blood to the lungs. He also proposed the existence of two atria of the heart functioning to capture air. He was one of the first to begin to accurately describe the anatomy of the heart and to describe the involvement of the lungs in circulation. His descriptions built substantially on previous and contemporaneous efforts but, by modern standards, his conceptions of pulmonary circulation and of the functions of the parts of the heart were still largely inaccurate.

Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) followed Hippocrates and proposed that the heart had three ventricles, rather than two, that all connected to the lungs. Greek physician Erasistratus (315 – 240 BCE) agreed with Hippocrates and Aristotle that the heart was the origin of all of the vessels in the body but proposed a system in which air was drawn into the lungs and traveled to the left ventricle via pulmonary veins. It was transformed there into the pneuma and distributed throughout the body by arteries, which contained only air. In this system, veins distributed blood throughout the body, and thus blood did not circulate, but rather was consumed by the organs.

The Greek physician Galen (129 – c. 210 CE) provided the next insights into pulmonary circulation. Though many of his theories, like those of his predecessors, were marginally or completely incorrect, his theory of pulmonary circulation dominated the medical community&#x27;s understanding for hundreds of years after his death. Galen contradicted Erasistratus before him by proposing that arteries carried both air and blood, rather than air alone (which was essentially correct, leaving aside that blood vessels carry constituents of air and not air itself). He proposed that the liver was the originating point of all blood vessels. He also theorized that the heart was not a pumping muscle but rather an organ through which blood passed. Galen&#x27;s theory included a new description of pulmonary circulation: air was inhaled into the lungs where it became the pneuma. Pulmonary veins transmitted this pneuma to the left ventricle of the heart to cool the blood simultaneously arriving there. This mixture of pneuma, blood, and cooling produced the vital spirits that could then be transported throughout the body via arteries. Galen further proposed that the heat of the blood arriving in the heart produced noxious vapors that were expelled through the same pulmonary veins that first brought the pneuma. He wrote that the right ventricle played a different role to the left: it transported blood to the lungs where the impurities were vented out so that clean blood could be distributed throughout the body. Though Galen&#x27;s description of the anatomy of the heart was more complete than those of his predecessors, it included several mistakes. Most notably, Galen believed that blood flowed between the two ventricles of the heart through small, invisible pores in the interventricular septum.

The next significant developments in the understanding of pulmonary circulation did not arrive until centuries later. Persian polymath Avicenna (c. 980 – 1037 CE) wrote a medical encyclopedia entitled &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;. In it, he translated and compiled contemporary medical knowledge and added some new information of his own. However, Avicenna&#x27;s description of pulmonary circulation reflected the incorrect views of Galen.

The Arab physician, Ibn al-Nafis, wrote the &quot;Commentary on Anatomy in&quot; &quot;Avicenna&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Canon&quot; in 1242 in which he provided possibly the first known description of the system that remains substantially congruent with modern understandings, in spite of its flaws. Ibn al-Nafis made two key improvements on Galen&#x27;s ideas. First, he disproved the existence of the pores in the interventricular septum that Galen had believed allowed blood to flow between the left and right ventricles. Second, he surmised that the only way for blood to get from the right to the left ventricle in the absence of interventricular pores was a system like pulmonary circulation. He also described the anatomy of the lungs in clear and basically correct detail, which his predecessors had not. However, like Aristotle and Galen, al-Nafis still believed in the quasi-mythical concept of vital spirit and that it was formed in the left ventricle from a mixture of blood and air. Despite the enormity of Ibn al-Nafis&#x27;s improvements on the theories that preceded him, his commentary on &quot;The Canon&quot; was not widely known to Western scholars until the manuscript was discovered in Berlin, Germany, in 1924. As a result, the ongoing debate among Western scholars as to how credit for the discovery should be apportioned failed to include Ibn al-Nafis until, at earliest, the mid-20th century (shortly after which he came to enjoy a share of this credit). In 2021, several researchers described a text predating the work of al-Nafis, &quot;fargh- beyn-roh va nafs&quot;, in which there is a comparable report on pulmonary circulation. The researchers argue that its author, Qusta ibn Luqa, is the best candidate for the discoverer of pulmonary circulation on a similar basis to arguments in favour of al-Nafis generally.

It took centuries for other scientists and physicians to reach conclusions that were similar to and then more accurate than those of al-Nafis and ibn Luqa. This later progress, constituting the gap between medieval and modern understanding, occurred throughout Europe. Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci (1452 – 1519 CE) was one of the first to propose that the heart was just a muscle, rather than a vessel of spirits and air, but he still subscribed to Galen&#x27;s ideas of circulation and defended the existence of interventricular pores. The Flemish physician Andreas Vesalius (1514 – 1564 CE) published corrections to Galen&#x27;s view of circulatory anatomy, questioning the existence of interventricular pores, in his book &quot;De humani corporis fabrica libri septem&quot; in 1543. Spanish Michael Servetus, after him, was the first European physician to accurately describe pulmonary circulation. His assertions largely matched those of al-Nafis. In subsequent centuries, he has frequently been credited with the discovery, but some historians have propounded the idea that he potentially had access to Ibn al-Nafis&#x27;s work while writing his own texts. Servetus published his findings in &quot;Christianismi Restituto&quot; (1553): a theological work that was considered heretical by Catholics and Calvinists alike. As a result, both book and author were burned at the stake and only a few copies of his work survived. Italian physician Realdo Colombo (c. 1515 – 1559 CE) published a book, &quot;De re anatomica libri XV,&quot; in 1559 that accurately described pulmonary circulation. It is still a matter of debate among historians as to whether Colombo reached his conclusions alone or based them to an unknown degree on the works of al-Nafis and Servetus. Finally, in 1628, the influential British physician William Harvey (1578 – 1657 AD) provided at the time the most complete and accurate description of pulmonary circulation of any scholar worldwide in his treatise &quot;Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus&quot;. At the macroscopic level, his model is still recognizable in and reconcilable with modern understandings of pulmonary circulation.

<text>Walter Jack Palance ( ; born Volodymyr Ivanovych Palahniuk; February 18, 1919 – November 10, 2006) was an American screen and stage actor, known to film audiences for playing tough guys and villains. He was nominated for three Academy Awards, all for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, for his roles in &quot;Sudden Fear&quot; (1952) and &quot;Shane&quot; (1953), and winning almost 40 years later for &quot;City Slickers&quot; (1991).

Born in Lattimer Mines, Pennsylvania, the son of Ukrainian immigrants, Palance served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. He attended Stanford University before pursuing a career in the theatre, winning a Theatre World Award in 1951. He made his film acting debut in Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;Panic in the Streets&quot; (1950), and earned Oscar nominations for &quot;Sudden Fear&quot; and &quot;Shane&quot;, his third and fourth-ever film roles. He also won an Emmy Award for a 1957 teleplay &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot;.

Subsequently, Palance played a variety of both supporting and leading film roles, often appearing in crime dramas and Westerns. Beginning in the late 1950s, he would work extensively in Europe, notably in a memorable turn as a charismatic-but-corrupting Hollywood mogul in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;Contempt&quot;. He played the title character in the 1973 television film &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, which influenced future depictions of the character. During the 1980s, he became familiar to a new generation of audiences by hosting the television series &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; (1982–86). His newfound popularity spurred a late-career revival, and he played high-profile villain roles in the blockbusters &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988) and &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot; (1989), and culminating in his Oscar and Golden Globe-winning turn as Curly in &quot;City Slickers&quot;.

Off-screen, he was involved in efforts in support of the Ukrainian American community and served as a chairman of the Hollywood Trident Foundation.
==Early life==
Palance was born Volodymyr Palahniuk on February 18, 1919, in Lattimer Mines, Pennsylvania, the son of Anna (née Gramiak) and Ivan Palahniuk, an anthracite coal miner. His parents were Ukrainian Catholic immigrants, his father a native of Ivane-Zolote in southwestern Ukraine (modern Ternopil Oblast) and his mother from the Lviv Oblast. One of six children, he worked in coal mines during his youth before becoming a professional boxer in the late 1930s.

Boxing under the name Jack Brazzo, Palahniuk lost his only recorded match, in a four-round decision on points, to future heavyweight contender Joe Baksi in a Pier-6 brawl rough fight. Other sources record cite him winning 15 consecutive club fights, with 12 knockouts. Years later he recounted: &quot;Then I thought, &#x27;You must be nuts to get your head beat in for $200.&#x27; The theater seemed a lot more appealing.&quot;

=== World War II ===
Palance enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, and was trained as the pilot of a B-24 Liberator bomber. He suffered head injuries and burns during a 1943 crash, with various sources citing it as a patrol off the coast of California, or a training flight near Tucson, Arizona (at what is now Davis–Monthan Air Force Base). He was discharged in 1944 after undergoing reconstructive surgery, which contributed to his distinctively gaunt appearance.

According to some sources he was awarded a Purple Heart, though he does not appear on official rolls for the decoration. Purple Hearts are not awarded for training injuries.

===College===
Palance won a football scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill but left after two years, disgusted by commercialization of the sport.

After the war, Palance enrolled at Stanford to study journalism, but switched to drama. He left one credit shy of graduating in order to pursue a career in the theatre. During his university years, he worked as a short order cook, waiter, soda jerk, lifeguard at Jones Beach State Park, and a photographer&#x27;s model.

It was around this time that he changed his name to Walter Jack Palance, reasoning that most people couldn&#x27;t pronounce his birth name. His last name was actually a derivative of his original name. In an episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, he described how no one could pronounce his last name, and how it was suggested that he be called &quot;Palanski&quot;. From that he decided just to use &quot;Palance&quot; instead.

==Early acting career==
=== &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; ===
In New York, Palance studied method acting under Michael Chekhov, while working as a sportswriter. He made his Broadway debut in 1947 as a Russian soldier in &quot;The Big Two&quot;, directed by Robert Montgomery.

Palance&#x27;s acting break came as Marlon Brando&#x27;s understudy in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, and he eventually replaced Brando on stage as Stanley Kowalski. (Anthony Quinn, however, gained the opportunity to tour the play.)

Palance appeared in two plays in 1948 with short runs, &quot;A Temporary Island&quot; and &quot;The Vigil&quot;. He made his television debut in 1949.

===Film career===
Palance made his big-screen debut in &quot;Panic in the Streets&quot; (1950), directed by Elia Kazan, who had directed &quot;Streetcar&quot; on Broadway. He played a gangster, and was credited as &quot;Walter (Jack) Palance&quot;.

That year he was featured in &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot; (1951), about United States Marines during World War II. He returned to Broadway for &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; (1951) by Sidney Kingsley, which was a minor hit.

===Two Oscar nominations===
Palance was second-billed in just his third film, opposite Joan Crawford in the thriller &quot;Sudden Fear&quot; (1952). His character is a former coal miner, as Palance&#x27;s father had been. Palance received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

He was nominated in the same category the following year for his role as hired gunfighter Jack Wilson in &quot;Shane&quot; (1953). The film was a huge hit, and Palance was now an established film name.

==Stardom==
Palance played a villain in &quot;Second Chance&quot; opposite Robert Mitchum, and was an Indian in &quot;Arrowhead&quot; (both 1953). He got a chance to play a heroic role in &quot;Flight to Tangier&quot; (1953), a thriller.

He played the lead in &quot;Man in the Attic&quot; (1953), an adaptation of &quot;The Lodger&quot;. He was Attila the Hun in &quot;Sign of the Pagan&quot; with Jeff Chandler, and Simon Magus in the Ancient World epic &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; (both 1954) with Paul Newman.

He had the star part in &quot;I Died a Thousand Times&quot; (1955), a remake of &quot;High Sierra&quot;, and was cast by Robert Aldrich in two star parts: &quot;The Big Knife&quot; (1955), from the play by Clifford Odets, as a Hollywood star; and &quot;Attack&quot; (1956), as a tough soldier in World War II.

In 1955, he had an operation for appendicitis.

Palance was in a Western, &quot;The Lonely Man&quot; (1957), playing the father of Anthony Perkins, and played a double role in &quot;House of Numbers&quot; (1957).

In 1957, Palance won an Emmy Award for best actor for his portrayal of Mountain McClintock in the &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; production of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot;.

===International star===
Warwick Films hired Palance to play the hero in &quot;The Man Inside&quot; (1958), shot in Europe. He was reunited with Robert Aldrich and Jeff Chandler when they worked on &quot;Ten Seconds to Hell&quot; (1959), filmed in Germany, playing a bomb disposal expert.

He made &quot;Beyond All Limits&quot; (1959) in Mexico, and &quot;Austerlitz&quot; (1960) in France, then did a series of films in Italy: &quot;Revak the Rebel&quot;, &quot;Sword of the Conqueror&quot;, &quot;The Mongols&quot;, &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, and &quot;Barabbas&quot; (all 1961), and &quot;Night Train to Milan&quot; and &quot;Warriors Five&quot; (both 1962).
Jean-Luc Godard persuaded Palance to take on the role of Hollywood producer Jeremy Prokosch in the nouvelle vague movie &quot;Le Mépris&quot; (1963) with Brigitte Bardot. Although the main dialogue was in French, Palance spoke mostly English.

===Return to Hollywood===
Palance returned to the U.S. to star in the TV series &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; (1963–64). In 1964, his presence at a recently integrated movie theatre in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, prompted a riot from segregationists who assumed Palance was there to promote civil rights.

He played a gangster in &quot;Once a Thief&quot; (1965) with Alain Delon. In the following year he appeared in the television film &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot;, directed by Alan Handley, in which he played the Jabberwock, and had a featured role opposite Lee Marvin and Burt Lancaster in the Western adventure &quot;The Professionals&quot;. Palance guest-starred in &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, and the episodes were released as a film, &quot;The Spy in the Green Hat&quot; (1967). He went to England to make &quot;Torture Garden&quot; (1967), and made &quot;Kill a Dragon&quot; (1968) in Hong Kong.

Palance provided narration for the 1967 documentary &quot;And Still Champion! The Story of Archie Moore&quot;. He was in the TV film &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; produced by Dan Curtis, during the making of which he fell and injured himself.

In 1969, Palance recorded a country music album in Nashville, released on Warner Bros. Records. It featured his self-penned song &quot;The Meanest Guy that Ever Lived&quot;. The album was re-released on CD in 2003 by the Water label (Water 119). His films were often international co-productions by this time: &quot;They Came to Rob Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;The Mercenary&quot; (both 1968), &quot;The Desperados&quot;, and &quot;Marquis de Sade: Justine&quot; (both 1969).

Palance had a part in the Hollywood blockbuster &quot;Che!&quot; (1969) playing Fidel Castro opposite Omar Sharif in the title role, but the film flopped. Palance went back to action films and Westerns: &quot;Battle of the Commandos&quot; (1970), &quot;The McMasters&quot; (1970) and &quot;Compañeros&quot; (1970).

Palance had another role in &quot;Monte Walsh&quot; (1970), from the author of &quot;Shane&quot;, opposite Lee Marvin, but the film was a box-office disappointment. So too was &quot;The Horsemen&quot; (1971) with Sharif, directed by John Frankenheimer. He supported Bud Spencer in &quot;It Can Be Done Amigo&quot; and Charles Bronson in &quot;Chato&#x27;s Land&quot; (both 1972), and had the lead in &quot;Sting of the West&quot; (1972) and &quot;Brothers Blue&quot; (1973).

In Great Britain he appeared in a highly acclaimed TV film, &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1973), in the title role; it was directed by Dan Curtis. Three years earlier, comic book artist Gene Colan had based his interpretation of Dracula for the acclaimed Marvel Comics comic book series &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; on Palance, explaining, &quot;He had that cadaverous look, a serpentine look on his face. I knew that Jack Palance would do the perfect Dracula.&quot;

Palance went back to Hollywood for &quot;Oklahoma Crude&quot; (1973) then to England to star in &quot;Craze&quot; (1974). He starred in the television series &quot;Bronk&quot; between 1975 and 1976 for MGM Television, and starred in the TV films &quot;The Hatfields and the McCoys&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Four Deuces&quot; (1976).

===Italy===
In the late 1970s, Palance was mostly based in Italy. He supported Ursula Andress in &quot;Africa Express&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Infermiera&quot;, Lee Van Cleef in &quot;God&#x27;s Gun&quot;, and Thomas Milian in &quot;The Cop in Blue Jeans&quot; (all 1976). He was in &quot;Black Cobra Woman&quot;; &quot;Safari Express&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Africa Express&quot;; &quot;Mister Scarface&quot;; and &quot;Blood and Bullets&quot; (all 1976). He travelled to Canada to make &quot;Welcome to Blood City&quot; (1977) and the US for &quot;The One Man Jury&quot; (1978), &quot;Portrait of a Hitman&quot; and &quot;Angels Revenge&quot; (both 1979).

Palance later said his Italian sojourn was the most enjoyable of his career. &quot;In Italy, everyone on the set has a drinking cubicle, and no one is ever interested in working after lunch&quot;, he said. &quot;That&#x27;s a highly civilized way to make a movie.&quot; He went back to Canada for &quot;H. G. Wells&#x27; The Shape of Things to Come&quot; (1979).

===Return to the U.S. and &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;===
In 1980, Jack Palance narrated the documentary &quot;The Strongest Man in the World&quot; by Canadian filmmaker Halya Kuchmij, about Mike Swistun, a circus strongman who had been a student of Houdini. Palance attended the premiere of the film on June 6, 1980, at the Winnipeg Art Gallery. He appeared in &quot;The Ivory Ape&quot; (1980), &quot;Without Warning&quot; (1980), &quot;Hawk the Slayer&quot; (1980), and the slasher film, &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; (1982).

In 1982, Palance began hosting a television revival of &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;. The weekly series ran from 1982 to 1986 on the American ABC network. The series also starred three different co-hosts from season to season, including Palance&#x27;s daughter Holly Palance, actress Catherine Shirriff and singer Marie Osmond. &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; was in rerun syndication on the Sci-fi Channel (U.K.) and the Sci-fi Channel (U.S.) during the 1990s. He appeared in the films &quot;Gor&quot; and &quot;Bagdad Café&quot; (both 1987).

==Later career==
===Career revival===

Palance had never been out of work since his career began, but his success on &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; and the international popularity of &quot;Bagdad Cafe&quot; (1987) created a new demand for his services in big-budget Hollywood films.

He made memorable appearances as villains in &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988) as Lawrence Murphy, &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot; (1989) and Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; (1989). He also performed on Roger Waters&#x27; first solo album release, &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; (1984), and was in &quot;Outlaw of Gor&quot; (1988) and &quot;Solar Crisis&quot; (1990).

===&quot;City Slickers&quot;===
Palance was then cast as cowboy Curly Washburn in the 1991 comedy &quot;City Slickers&quot;, directed by Ron Underwood. He quipped:I don&#x27;t go to California much any more. I live on a farm in Pennsylvania, about 100 miles from New York, so I can go into the city for dinner and a show when I want to. I also have a ranch about two hours from Los Angeles, but I don&#x27;t go there very often at all...But I will always read a decent script when it is offered, and the script to &quot;City Slickers&quot; made sense. Curly (his character in the film) is the kind of man I would like to be. He is in control of himself, except for deciding the moment of his own death. Besides all that, I got paid pretty good money to make it.

Four decades after his film debut, Palance won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor on March 30, 1992, for his performance as Curly. Stepping onstage to accept the award, the 6&#x27; 4&quot; (1.93 m) actor looked down at 5&#x27; 7&quot; (1.70 m) Oscar host Billy Crystal (who was also his co-star in the movie) and joked, mimicking one of his lines from the film, &quot;Billy Crystal ... I crap bigger than him.&quot; He then dropped to the floor and demonstrated his ability, at the age of 73, to perform one-armed push-ups.

The audience loved the moment and host Crystal turned it into a running gag. At various points in the broadcast, Crystal announced that Palance was &quot;backstage on the StairMaster&quot;, had bungee-jumped off the Hollywood sign, had rendezvoused with the space shuttle in orbit, had fathered all the children in a production number, had been named &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot;, and had won the New York primary election. At the end of the broadcast Crystal said he wished he could be back next year, but &quot;I&#x27;ve just been informed Jack Palance will be hosting.&quot;

Years later, Crystal appeared on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; and fondly recalled that, after the Oscar ceremony, Palance approached him during the reception: &quot;He stopped me and put his arms out and went, &#x27;Billy Crystal, who thought it would be you?&#x27; It was his really funny way of saying thank you to a little New York Jewy guy who got him the Oscars.&quot;

In 1993, during the opening of the Oscars, a spoof of that Oscar highlight featured Palance appearing to drag in an enormous Academy Award statuette with Crystal again hosting, riding on the rear end of it. Halfway across the stage, Palance dropped to the ground as if exhausted, but then performed several one-armed push-ups before regaining his feet and dragging the giant Oscar the rest of the way across the stage.

He appeared in &quot;Cyborg 2&quot; (1993); &quot;Cops &amp; Robbersons&quot; (1994) with Chevy Chase; &quot;City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1994); and on TV in &quot;Buffalo Girls&quot; (1995). He also voiced Rothbart in the 1994 animated film &quot;The Swan Princess&quot;.

===Final years===
Palance&#x27;s final films included &quot;Ebenezer&quot; (1998), a TV Western version of Charles Dickens&#x27;s classic &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, with Palance as Scrooge; &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1999); &quot;Sarah, Plain and Tall: Winter&#x27;s End&quot; (2000); and &quot;Prancer Returns&quot; (2001).

Palance, at the time chairman of the Hollywood Trident Foundation, walked out of a Russian Film Festival in Hollywood in 2004. After being introduced, Palance said, &quot;I feel like I walked into the wrong room by mistake. I think that Russian film is interesting, but I have nothing to do with Russia or Russian film. My parents were born in Ukraine: I&#x27;m Ukrainian. I&#x27;m not Russian. So, excuse me, but I don&#x27;t belong here. It&#x27;s best if we leave.&quot; Palance was awarded the title of &quot;People&#x27;s Artist&quot; by Vladimir Putin, president of Russia; however, Palance refused it.

In 2001, Palance returned to the recording studio as a special guest on friend Laurie Z&#x27;s album &quot;Heart of the Holidays&quot; to narrate the classic poem &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;. In 2002, he starred in the television movie &quot;Living with the Dead&quot; opposite Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen and Diane Ladd. In 2004, he starred in another television production, &quot;Back When We Were Grownups&quot;, once again directed by Ron Underwood, opposite Blythe Danner; it was his final performance.

==Personal life==

Palance lived for several years around Tehachapi, California. He was married to his first wife, Virginia (née Baker), from 1949 to 1968. They had three children, one of whom is retired actress Holly Palance. On New Year&#x27;s Day, 2003, Virginia was struck and killed by a car in Los Angeles. In May 1987, Palance married his second wife, Elaine Rogers. His death certificate listed his marital status as &quot;Divorced&quot;.

Palance painted and sold landscape art, with a poem included on the back of each picture. He was also the author of &quot;The Forest of Love&quot;, a book of poems published in 1996 by Summerhouse Press. He was a supporter of the Republican Party.

Palance enjoyed raising cattle on his ranch in the Tehachapi Mountains. He gave up eating red meat after working on his ranch, commenting that he couldn&#x27;t eat a cow.

Palance acknowledged a lifelong attachment to his Pennsylvania heritage and visited there when able. Shortly before his death, he sold his farm in Butler Township and put his art collection up for auction.

==Death==
Palance died at the age of 87 from natural causes at his daughter Holly&#x27;s house in Montecito, California on 10 November 2006.

==Legacy==

Palance has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6608 Hollywood Boulevard.

In 1992, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

According to writer Mark Evanier, comic book creator Jack Kirby modeled his character Darkseid on the actor.

The &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; 1956 comic &quot;Lucky Luke contre Phil Defer&quot; by Morris features a villain named Phil Defer who is a caricature of Jack Palance.

The song &quot;And now we dance&quot; by punk band The Vandals features the lyrics, &quot;Come on and do one hand pushups just like Jack Palance.&quot;

American comedian Bill Hicks incorporated a reference to Palance in one of his most famous routines, likening Palance&#x27;s character in &quot;Shane&quot; to how he views the United States&#x27; role in international warfare.

Novelist Donald E. Westlake stated that he sometimes imagined Palance as the model for the career-criminal character Parker he wrote in a series of novels under the name Richard Stark.

In 2023, Palance was inducted into the Luzerne County Arts &amp; Entertainment Hall of Fame. He was included among the inaugural class of inductees.

<text>The Workers and Peasants&#x27; Bloc (; ) was a &quot;Right Opposition&quot; communist group in Spain, centered in Catalonia.

==History==

BOC was founded in Barcelona in 1931, as the mass front of the Catalan-Balearic Communist Federation (FCCB), after the merger of the Catalan Communist Party into FCCB. FCCB, which made up the nucleus of BOC, later changed its name to Iberian Communist Federation, thus stating its intention to expand itself and BOC throughout Spain. Prominent leaders of BOC were Joaquín Maurín, Hilari Arlandis, Jordi Arquer, Pere Bonet, Víctor Colomer, Abelard Tona Nadalmai and Àngel Estivill. In November 1935, the majority of BOC merged with the Trotskyist Communist Left of Spain, to form the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM; Catalan: &quot;Partit Obrer d&#x27;Unificació Marxista&quot;). The minority stayed out of the merger and later joined the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC).

==Publications==
The central publication of BOC was &quot;La Batalla&quot;. BOC also published &quot;L&#x27;Hora&quot; and &quot;El Front&quot; in Barcelona, &quot;L&#x27;Espurna&quot; in Girona and &quot;Avant&quot; in Lleida.

<text>BOC Limited is a British based multinational, industrial gas company. Formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange, since 2006 it has been a subsidiary of Linde plc.

==History==

Brin&#x27;s Oxygen Company was formed in 1886, by two French brothers, Arthur and Léon Brin. In the early years, the company manufactured oxygen using a high-temperature barium oxide process, known as the Brin process, developed from the work of French scientist Jean-Baptiste Boussingault. The main application for gaseous oxygen at that time was in connection with the generation of limelight, used in magic lanterns and theatre lighting.

A major new market emerged around 1903, with the development of the oxyacetylene welding process. Around the same time, new cryogenic air separation processes had been devised independently in Britain, the United States and Germany. The German engineer and founder of the Linde Group, Carl von Linde, won the patent for the process. The Brin brothers negotiated an agreement to use the Linde patents. In exchange, von Linde was given a stake and a board position in Brin&#x27;s Oxygen Company, which he held until 1914. The new process replaced the inefficient barium oxide process, paving the way for larger-scale and more efficient production.

In 1906, the Brin brothers renamed the company the British Oxygen Company (BOC). During the First World War, the business increased significantly as the mass production of needed war machinery—ships, tanks and trucks—involved either metal cutting or welding. In the post-war period, it grew by acquisitions, which included Sparklets Ltd, Allen-Liversidge Ltd and the Quasi-Arc Company.

During the Second World War, the gases for munitions and for medical needs were provided by BOC. As in the First World War, the business grew. After the war, BOC formed subsidiaries in over twenty countries. In the 1950s, due to the increased demand for automobiles, improved methods of manufacturing steel were invented which required &quot;tonnage&quot; oxygen. This meant a further increase in business for BOC.

BOC diversified into many industries in the 1960s and 1970s. One was the refrigeration market and it set up a joint venture called BOC-Linde Refrigeration, with Linde of Germany in 1968. It also acquired Ace Refrigeration Ltd and J. Muirhead Ltd, quick-frozen food suppliers, in 1969.

With the plan of expanding into the Far East, it set up British Oxygen (Far East) Ltd, based in Tokyo. It established subsidiaries and joint ventures in Jamaica, the Netherlands, South Africa, Sweden and Spain for a number of products; which included transformers, magnetising equipment, frozen foods, stable isotopes, radioactively labelled compounds and cryogenic systems. In 1971, the company installed the largest mainframe computer in the United Kingdom, linking a network of computers throughout the country, and sold computer time to outside customers. As a result, BOC diversified into the computer business.

The 1973 oil crisis led to a rethinking of BOC&#x27;s future strategy. It divested non-strategic assets; and concentrated on its primary business, especially the gases and health care markets, and the expansion of these businesses to Europe, the Americas and the Far East. In 1975, the company became BOC International Ltd, reflecting its success in developing business outside of Britain, and in products beyond oxygen.

An important part of BOC&#x27;s history was the acquisition of Airco Industrial Gases, an American competitor. After 11 years of litigation, in 1978 Airco became a wholly owned subsidiary of BOC. The enlarged company changed its name to the BOC Group.

In 1999, reports emerged that the U.S. industrial gases company Praxair, which in 1992 spun off from Linde&#x27;s U.S. division, &#x27;Union Carbide Industrial Gases&#x27;, were in possible merger discussions with BOC. Following the breakup of the talks, France&#x27;s Air Liquide and Air Products &amp; Chemicals made a series of cash offers to acquire the group. On 13 July 1999, the BOC board approved a pre-conditional cash offer of £14.60 per share. BOC&#x27;s assets were to be divided between Air Liquide and Air Products in the US$11 billion deal. On 12 May 2000, the bid lapsed, following failure to reach a satisfactory agreement with the United States Federal Trade Commission.

Following the collapse of the bid, BOC developed a new strategy to stimulate business growth in new products and markets and to reshape its existing portfolio of businesses to improve Group performance. In 2001, BOC announced it was cutting 1,500 jobs. In late 2002, the company merged its Japanese industrial and medical gas businesses with those of Air Liquide to form Japan Air Gases. BOC also acquired Praxair&#x27;s operations in Poland.

In November 2003, BOC announced that it would complete the sale of Afrox Healthcare—a hospital and managed health care group operating in South Africa—to a consortium led by Black Economic Empowerment investors.

The BOC&#x27;s total revenues in 2005, including its share of joint ventures and associate companies, were £4.6 billion and was then the second largest industrial gas supplier in the world. Industrial gases business made up for more than 80% of sales. The group was getting nearly one-third of its revenues from Asia Pacific; Europe accounted for 28% and the Americas 27%.

In January 2006, the Linde Group made a preliminary proposal to acquire BOC based on a £15 per share all-cash offer, which was rejected by the BOC board of directors. In March 2006, the second proposal based on a £16 per share all-cash offer, valuing the company at £8.2bn (US$14.4bn; €12bn), was accepted and takeover was completed on 5 September 2006. After nearly a century of intermittent courtship, BOC became a part of Linde Group and the synergy overtook Air Liquide as the global market leader.

On 6 September, BOC employees received a welcome pack including a letter from Linde CEO Professor Dr. Wolfgang Reitzle, a small badge representing the new logo of The Linde Group and a Swatch watch. Many of these watches quickly appeared on eBay. On 12 March 2007, the Linde Group divested the vacuum business known as BOC Edwards to the private investment group CCMP Capital.

==Operations==
The BOC business activities included:

*The Process Gas Solutions (PGS) line of business, supplying large product volumes by pipeline, on-site generation or cryogenic tanker
*The Industrial and Special Products (ISP) line of business providing packaged gas, chemicals and related products and services. The gases involved are typically delivered in high pressure cylinders and range from technical grades to high-purity speciality gases.
*BOC Edwards supplying the semiconductor industry with vacuum, chemical delivery and abatement systems and related services. It also supplies vacuum equipment to many industrial and scientific sectors.
*Gist Limited provided logistics services, transport and warehousing to a number of sectors including food, beverage and fashion retail for large corporations including Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose and Tesco. It was bought by M&amp;S in Summer 2022 as part of a deal worth up to £255M.

==Headquarters==
When BOC was a global company, the head office of BOC was in Windlesham, a small village approximately 25 miles south-west of London. The office, built in the 1980s is a fine example of modern architecture and when seen from the air resembles the shape of an oxygen molecule. This office was used by Kamkorp Group and then stood empty before being sold to Gordon Murray Automotive in February 2020. Many of the staff that was based in the Windlesham office have since moved to the BOC office in Woking and Linde plc&#x27;s head office in Munich, Germany.

<text>Kineton is a village and civil parish on the River Dene in south-east Warwickshire, England. The village is part of Stratford-on-Avon district, and in the 2001 census it had a population of 2,278, increasing to 2,337 at the 2011 Census.

Kineton is about ten miles (16 km) from the towns of Banbury to the south-east, Warwick and Leamington Spa to the north, and Stratford-upon-Avon to the west. Nearby is the large village of Wellesbourne with its historic water mill, Compton Verney House art gallery, the British Motor Museum at Gaydon, the Burton Dassett Hills country park and the battlefield of Edgehill. Kineton, in the district historically known as the Vale of the Red Horse, can also be considered to be part of the informal area of Banburyshire.

Kineton district council ward covers Gaydon, Lighthorne, Lighthorne Heath, Compton Verney, Combrook, Little Kineton and Chadshunt, a population of 4,228 according to the 2001 census, rising to 4,320 at the 2011 census. The village has some areas of light industry but is largely agricultural; many residents commute to nearby towns and cities for employment, including Banbury, Warwick and Stratford-upon-Avon.

==History==
The first recorded reference to Kineton was in 969, when Saxon King Edgar granted some land here to a trusted counsellor.

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as &quot;Kington&quot;. On the outskirts of the village, at the foot of Pittern Hill, are the remains of the earthworks of a motte-and-bailey castle, known as &quot;King John&#x27;s Castle&quot;, so called because it is believed that King John held a Court Leet there. Kineton gave its name to the area of south-east Warwickshire known as Kineton Hundred.

Early in the 13th century, Stephen de Segrave had a Tuesday market in his manor of Kineton, and a fair on the eve and day of St Peter and St Paul. The market died out by 1840, when the market house was pulled down and a school built on its site, but the fair on 5 February continued until recently.

For a period of the English Civil War, Kineton was looted by Prince Rupert with part of the Royalist army. This was after he had defeated Sir James Ramsay, from the Parliamentarians, and by doing this he failed to aid the rest of his army, thus leading to a neutral ending to the Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642. A year later, in July 1643, King Charles met with Queen Henrietta Maria at Kineton.

John Newton who lived from 1725 to 1807 and for a while lived in the village of Kineton where he is rumoured to have written the words to &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; in 1772 but there is no contemporary evidence for this.

William Kendall, co-builder of Birmingham Town Hall and subsequent Warwick County Surveyor and Steward to the Earl of Warwick, lived in Little Kineton in 1841.

==Military connections==

During the Second World War, Kineton served as a transit camp, with Polish and Czechoslovak troops stationed there.

One of the UK&#x27;s main military ammunition depots is located partially within Kineton parish, and is known as the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency (DSDA), Kineton. It extends to several hundred acres and is linked to the main Network Rail system by a branch line. The depot also stores spare railway carriages and trains on behalf of the various UK train operating companies.

Partially within Kineton parish, from 1942 until 1977, RAF Gaydon operated as both a training unit and a front-line bomber base. In 1978, the site passed into civilian ownership and today contains the British Motor Museum, the headquarters and factory of sports car manufacturer Aston Martin, and the Jaguar Land Rover Gaydon Centre.

==Present==
 Near the centre of the village stands St Peter&#x27;s Church. Work on the current building, which replaced an earlier church on the same site, began in the 13th century. A completed church was consecrated in 1315. Of this new building only the fine tower remains.

The rest of the building has been rebuilt and remodelled over the centuries. In the 18th century Sanderson Miller enlarged the nave and added two transepts. A further remodelling campaign, which transformed the building into its current form, took place in the 19th century.
In 2008, three new bells were cast to augment the bells to eight, one replacing an existing bell. Taylors Eayre &amp; Smith Ltd of Loughborough carried out the work. The eight bells were rung for the first time on 5 November 2008.

The village also has a 19th-century Methodist chapel and a 20th-century Roman Catholic church. Pittern Hill Mill, north-west of the village, is a stone windmill of the 18th century.

Village shops include a Co-op store, a traditional butcher, a flower shop, an optician, an artisan bakery, a barber, hairdresser as well as the Nifty Needle curtain and soft furnishings/fabrics shop and workroom. There is a post office/convenience store and had a branch of HSBC Bank now converted into a pharmacy (2017). The village has a veterinary practice,two estate agents, a café, a fish and chip shop, two public houses, &quot;The Swan&quot;, newly refurbished, and &quot;The Carpenters Arms&quot; (which has a Chinese take-away inside) and a restaurant, &quot;Shukur&#x27;s Brasserie&quot; (which offers Bangladeshi and Indian cuisine).

The village and surrounding area are served by Kineton Church of England Primary School and Kineton High School, which takes students aged 11–19.

==Transport==
Kineton is close to the Fosse Way Roman Road and the M40 motorway which links it to Birmingham and London.

Regular bus services to Stratford upon Avon, Banbury and Leamington Spa are operated by Stagecoach and other independent companies.

The village was once served by the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway between Stratford-upon-Avon and Towcester. Kineton railway station opened on 1 June 1871 and was situated on the Broom to Fenny Compton line. The station closed in 1963 due to the Beeching Axe and the line itself closed two years later.

==Sports==
Kineton Sports and Social Club hosts football, cricket and bowls teams. The football team competes in the Leamington &amp; District Sunday Football League, affiliated to the Birmingham FA and the cricket side competes in the Cotswold Hills League. Kinetonbcycle are a group cycling from Little Kineton at 19:15 on Wednesday nights covering around 25 miles with on and off-road routes and including a pub stop.
Kineton High School is the home of Wellesbourne Badminton Club who play in the Leamington and Banbury Leagues and have a club night every Tuesday from 7.30 pm, and South Warwickshire Junior Badminton Club who are a Badminton England Affiliated Club playing on a Friday night at 6.30 pm.

==Name connection==
The town of Kyneton in Victoria, Australia was named after Kineton in the 19th century.

<text>Kets (; Ket: кето, кет, денг) are a Yeniseian-speaking people in Siberia. During the Russian Empire, they were known as Ostyaks, without differentiating them from several other Siberian people. Later, they became known as &quot;Yenisei Ostyaks&quot; because they lived in the middle and lower basin of the Yenisei River in the Krasnoyarsk Krai district of Russia. The modern Kets lived along the eastern middle stretch of the river before being assimilated politically into Russia between the 17th and 19th centuries. According to the 2010 census, there were 1,220 Kets in Russia. According to the 2021 census, this number had declined to 1,088.

== Origin ==
The Ket people share their origin with other Yeniseian people and are closely related to other Indigenous people of Siberia and Indigenous peoples of the Americas. They belong mostly to Y-DNA haplogroup Q-M242.

According to a 2016 study, the Ket and other Yeniseian people originated likely somewhere near the Altai Mountains or near Lake Baikal. It is suggested that parts of the Altaians are predominantly of Yeniseian origin and closely related to the Ket people. The Ket people are also closely related to several Native American groups. According to this study, the Yeniseians are linked to the Paleo-Eskimo groups. 

== Geographic distribution ==

Ket people live primarily in Turukhansky district of Krasnoyarsk Krai.

Kets by selected settlements as of 2010:
==History==
The Kets are thought to be the only survivors of an ancient nomadic people believed to have originally inhabited central and southern Siberia. In the 1960s, the Yugh people were distinguished as a separate, though similar, group.

Today, Kets are the descendants of fishermen and hunter tribes of the Yenisei taiga, who adopted some of the cultural ways of those original Ket-speaking tribes of South Siberia. The earlier tribes engaged in hunting, fishing, and reindeer breeding in the northern areas.

The Ket was incorporated into the Russian state in the 17th century. Their efforts to resist were unsuccessful as the Russians deported them to different places in an attempt to break up their resistance. This broke up their strictly organized patriarchal social system and their way of life disintegrated. The Ket people ran up debts with the Russians. Some died of famine, others of diseases introduced from Europe. By the 19th century, the Ket could no longer sustain itself without food assistance from the Russian state.

In the 20th century, the Soviets conducted collectivization among the Ket. They were officially recognized as Kets in the 1930s when the Soviet Union began to implement the self-definition policy for indigenous peoples. However, many Ket traditions continued to be counteracted by the state. Collectivization was completed by the 1950s, and the Ket people were led to adopt the same lifestyle as ethnic Russians; education in Russian contributed to language loss as well.

The population of Kets has been relatively stable since 1923. According to the 2010 census, there were 1,220 Kets in Russia. The Kets live in small villages along riversides and are no longer nomadic. Unemployment and alcoholism are rampant among the Ket, like many other indigenous peoples of Siberia.

==Language==
The Ket language has been linked to the Na-Dené languages of North America in the Dené–Yeniseian language family. This link has led to some collaboration between the Ket and northern Athabaskan peoples. Although a potential link to the Na-Dené languages has been identified, this link is not accepted by all linguists.

&quot;Ket&quot; means &quot;man&quot; (plural &quot;deng&quot; &quot;men, people&quot;). The Kets of the Kas, Sym and Dubches rivers use &quot;jugun&quot; as a self-designation. In 1788, Peter Simon Pallas was the earliest scholar to publish observations about the Ket language in a travel diary.

In 1926, there were 1,428 Kets, of whom 1,225 (85.8%) were native speakers of the Ket language. The 1989 census counted 1,113 ethnic Kets with only 537 (48.3%) native speakers left.

As of 2008, there were only about 100 people who still spoke Ket fluently, half of them over 50. It is entirely different from any other language in Siberia. Alexander Kotusov (1955–2019) was a Ket folk singer, composer, and writer of songs in the Ket language.

==Culture==
The Kets have a rich and varied culture, filled with an abundance of Siberian mythology, including shamanistic practices and oral traditions. Siberia, the area of Russia in which the Kets reside, has long been identified as the originating place of the Shaman or Shamanism. In the 1950s, Mircea Eliade states this in the first sentence of his book &quot;Shamanism&quot;: &quot;Since the beginning of the 20th century, ethnologists have fallen into the habit of using the terms &#x27;shaman&#x27;, &#x27;medicine man&#x27;, &#x27;sorcerer&#x27;, and &#x27;magician&#x27; interchangeably to designate certain individuals possessing magico-religious powers and found in all &#x27;primitive&#x27; societies. If the word &#x27;shaman&#x27; is taken to mean any magician, sorcerer, medicine man, or ecstatic found throughout the history of religion and religious ethnology, we arrive at a notion at once extremely complex and extremely vague; it seems, furthermore, to serve no purpose, for we already have the terms &#x27;magician&#x27; or &#x27;sorcerer&#x27; to express notions as unlike and ill-defined as &#x27;primitive magic&#x27; or &#x27;primitive mysticism&#x27;.&quot;

The shamans of the Ket people have been identified as practitioners of healing as well as other local ritualistic spiritual practices. Supposedly, there were several types of Ket shamans, differing in function (sacral rites, curing), power, and associated animals (deer, bear). Also, among Kets, (as with several other Siberian peoples such as the Karagas) there are examples of the use of skeleton symbolics. Hoppál interprets it as a symbol of shamanic rebirth, although it may also symbolize the bones of the loon (the helper animal of the shaman, joining the air and underwater worlds, just like the story of the shaman who traveled both to the sky and the underworld). The skeleton-like overlay represented shamanic rebirth among some other Siberian cultures as well.

Today, the practice of shamanism has largely been abandoned. Monotheism has displaced the ideas of the shaman and shamanistic practices. Of great importance to Kets are spirit images, described as &quot;an animal shoulder bone wrapped in a scrap of cloth simulating clothing.&quot; One adult Ket, who had been careless with a cigarette, said, &quot;It&#x27;s a shame I don&#x27;t have my doll. My house burnt down together with my dolls.&quot; Kets regard their spirit images as household deities, which sleep in the daytime and protect them at night.

Edward J. Vajda, a professor of Modern and Classical languages, spent a year in Siberia studying the Ket people, and found a possible relationship between the Ket language and the Na-Dene languages, of which Navajo is the most prominent and widely spoken.

Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov compared Ket mythology with those of speakers of Uralic languages, assuming in the studies that they are modeling semiotic systems in the compared mythologies. They have also made typological comparisons. Among other comparisons, possibly from Uralic mythological analogies, the mythologies of Ob-Ugric peoples and Samoyedic peoples are mentioned. Other authors have discussed analogies (similar folklore motifs, purely typological considerations, and certain binary pairs in symbolics) may be related to a dualistic organization of society - some dualistic features can be found in comparisons with these peoples. However, for Kets, neither dualistic organization of society nor cosmological dualism have been researched thoroughly. If such features existed at all, they have either weakened or remained largely undiscovered. There are some reports of a division into two exogamous patrilinear moieties, folklore on conflicts of mythological figures, and cooperation of two beings in the creation of the land, the motif of the earth-diver. This motif is present in several cultures in different variants. In one example, the creator of the world is helped by a waterfowl as the bird dives under the water and fetches earth so that the creator can make land out of it. In some cultures, the creator and the earth-fetching being (sometimes called a devil, or taking the shape of a loon) compete with one another; in other cultures (including the Ket variant), they do not compete at all, but rather collaborate.

However, if dualistic cosmologies are defined in a broad sense, and not restricted to certain concrete motifs, then their existence is more widespread; they exist not only among some Uralic-speaking peoples, but in examples on every inhabited continent. 

The Ket traditional culture has been researched extensively. Some people included as reference are Matthias Castrén, Vasiliy Ivanovich Anuchin, Kai Donner, Hans Findeisen, and Yevgeniya Alekseyevna Alekseyenko.

<doc id="598483" wikidata="Q692953" url="?curid=598483" title="Layard's parakeet">
<text>Layard&#x27;s parakeet (Psittacula calthrapae) is a parrot which is a resident endemic breeder in Sri Lanka. The common name of this bird commemorates the British naturalist Edgar Leopold Layard; his first wife, Barbara Anne Calthrop, whom he married in 1845, is commemorated in the specific epithet.

==Description==

Layard&#x27;s parakeet is a green parrot, 29 cm long including a tail up to 13 cm. The adult has a bluish-grey head and back, separated by a green collar. There is a broad black chin stripe and the tail is blue tipped yellow. The upper mandible of the male&#x27;s bill is red and the lower mandible is brown.

The female is similar, but has an all black beak and less green on the face than the male. Immature birds are mainly green, with an orange bill.

==Behaviour==
Layard&#x27;s parakeet is a bird of forests, particularly at the edges and in clearings, and also gardens. It is locally common. It undergoes local movements, driven mainly by the availability of the fruit, seeds, buds and blossoms that make up its diet. It is less gregarious than some of its relatives, and is usually in small groups outside the breeding season, when it often feeds with brahminy starlings. Its flight is swift and direct, and the call is a raucous chattering. It nests in holes in large trees, laying 3–4 white eggs.

==In culture==
In Sri Lanka, this bird is knowns as (ash-parrot) in Sinhala.
This bird appears on a 50c Sri Lankan postal stamp.
Also this bird appears in 500 Sri Lankan rupee bank note (2010 series).

==Biography==
===1936-1954: Early life, education, and stage breakthrough===
Gossett was born in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York City, to Hellen, a nurse, and Louis Cameron Gossett, a porter. He was an alumnus of Mark Twain Intermediate School 239 and Abraham Lincoln High School. He contracted polio during his youth. His stage debut came at age 17, in a school production of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; when a sports injury resulted in the decision to take an acting class.

Gossett&#x27;s high school teacher had encouraged him to audition for a Broadway part, resulting in his selection at the age of 17 for his first role on Broadway in the version of &quot;Take a Giant Step&quot; in 1953.

Michael Bate of &quot;The Ottawa Citizen&quot; said &quot;Gossett larks his way through the film&#x27;s early portions and develops a complex characterization with appealing good humor and restraint. He rarely overplays an easily overdone role and for this he deserves full credit.&quot;

That year Gossett was cast in a film adaptation of the novel &quot;Finding Maubee&quot;, however the project went dormant, and was released as &quot;The Mighty Quinn&quot; in 1989 with another cast.

Gossett stated that he was initially &quot;insulted when they decided to give me the part of Fiddler. He resembled Stepin Fetchit, the Uncle Tom part. But I said, OK, I will take it. I&#x27;ll do something. Then doing the research I realized there&#x27;s no such thing as an Uncle Tom. If it wasn&#x27;t for Fiddler, we wouldn&#x27;t be in America. He was a survivor. He understood both cultures and knew how to maneuver to stay alive and be solvent. We needed that lesson in order to survive here today. Having done Fiddler is a stripe on my uniform now&quot;. The program which ran for eight nights in a row was success with a record-breaking audience of 140 million. The role was his screen breakthrough, earning him an Emmy Award for outstanding lead actor in a single appearance in a drama or comedy series.

The rating for a made-for-TV movie was only bettered by 1983. At the time of its broadcast, it was the twelfth-highest-rated movie to air on network television.

In the same year, Gossett acted in Robert Aldrich&#x27;s &quot;The Choirboys&quot;, and Peter Yates&#x27;s &quot;The Deep&quot;. &quot;The Choirboys&quot; was a critical panned and viewed as one of Aldrich&#x27;s weakest films. In Yates&#x27;s film, an underwater thriller, Gossett played the lead villain. For his role he had to learn how to dive and said &quot;to become an efficient diver I was trained in the largest swimming pool I&#x27;d ever been in every day for a whole month. Then the instructor said, &#x27;I think you are ready now for the Atlantic Ocean. Once we got into the heavy stuff, those lessons saved my life quite a few times.&quot; On playing the lead villain he explained &quot;there are villainous traits and there are heroic traits in all of us, and as an actor you are taught to dip into all those sections of your personality. I guess, in a non artistic profession, you have to keep certain doors locked. I like to play anything that is significant, and of a quality that I would call a stretch. Anything that is really quite different from what I have done before.&quot; On his performance, he thought &quot;he did one of his finest jobs of acting during the filming&quot;. While the film got mixed to negative reviews, critic Bernard Drew, in his review published in &quot;The Courier-News&quot;, explained he liked it, enjoyed all performances and wrote that Gossett is &quot;unctuous and evil as the arch-fiend&quot;.

On April 10, the two part television film &quot;To Kill a Cop&quot; premiered. The film is about a cop who goes after a revolutionary, played by Gossett, who is murdering policemen. On his role, he said &quot;I see the character I&#x27;m portraying as a combination of those militant black leaders of 10 or 12 years ago: Eldridge Cleaver, Huey Newton, Stokely Carmichael, Bobby Seale. He was a guy who was in a shootout in Detroit. He lost his family and close friends. He escaped to Algeria where he was given asylum for 10 years. When he was asked to leave, he returned to the United States with one aim in mind: revenge.&quot; Donna Rabel in her &quot;Morning News&quot; review liked the film and said &quot;Lou Gossett, Jr., is properly menacing as the intellectual revolutionary.&quot;

On September 11, the two part miniseries &quot;The Critical Hit&quot; premiered. It is drama set in a hospital, in a supporting role Gossett plays a black militant who provides evidence of health care fraud to the first secretary of national health.

Gossett plays a servant who is 37 years of age when the series starts and 88 when it ends. He said &quot;I took the role because of the chance to age. No one will know who I am in the beginning. They&#x27;ll have to put a sign on me with my name on it. The role appealed to me. I&#x27;ll do anything I can to keep from being typecast. Even a small part if it offers something different. I had my choice of playing Mays, the doorman, or Mercer. Mays has a death scene, but Mercer gets to age&quot;. At the Emmy Awards, Gossett was nominated for &quot;Outstanding lead actor in a limited series or a special&quot;.

On September 4, the series &quot;The Lazarus Syndrome&quot; started, where Gossett plays a hospital chief of staff. The initial episode gathered one of the biggest Nielsen audience of that week, however the ratings dwindled and the show was pulled by October.

On April 23, the television film &quot;Lawman Without a Gun&quot; premiered. Gossett plays about a civil rights activist who becomes the Sheriff of a Southern town, it is inspired by the true story of Thomas Gilmore.

In 1981, Gossett was a guest star in an episode of the television series &quot;Palmerstown, U.S.A.&quot;. The episode is about a black soldier, played by Gossett, who lost his land after serving in the Spanish-American War and his attempt to regain it. At the time of its release, in his review published in &quot;The Start Press&quot;, Steven H. Scheuer wrote that the episode was &quot;emotionally, the most effective story so far.&quot; For his performance Gossett was nominated at the Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.

Also that year, in Richard A. Colla&#x27;s television film biography &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back: The Story of Leroy &#x27;Satchel&#x27; Paige&quot;, Gossett played the role of baseball star Satchel Paige. On playing Paige, Gossett said &quot;from the time I was three Satch was almost a God-like figure to me Yet when I got in front of the camera I had to be careful not to overdo it I tried to portray him as an incredibly gifted man rather than a legend, which he truly is.&quot; Mike Duffy of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; thought the film was outstanding, on Gossett he wrote that &quot;he was perfectly cast as Paige. He captures Paige&#x27;s overflowing exuberance for life, but also the man&#x27;s innate intelligence, and his proud determination to gain acceptance for the genuine physical genius he possessed.&quot;

On May 31, 1982, Michael Schultz&#x27;s television film &quot;Benny&#x27;s Place&quot; premiered. The story is based on play that was also directed on stage by Schultz. In it Gossett plays an older man pushing retirement who is asked to trained a replacement for his position at the steel mill where he works. Gossett accepted the role to work with Schultz. Of his role Gossett said &quot;they think he&#x27;s getting too old. He figures if he trains a young man, they&#x27;ll put a broom in his hand and take away his ace. To me, he represents old people quote-unquote and he shares their rage and predicament. He&#x27;s still a vital man, he represents all those people faced with that predicament. I think it&#x27;s a crime to send people that age off to pasture. They&#x27;re in the prime of life and they have a lot to offer. I think it puts people in a psychological fear of reaching 70.&quot; In his review published in &quot;News-Press&quot; Bill Hayden wrote that &quot;Louis Gossett Jr. gives a fiery and moving performance in this powerful production as a proud black man who believes he is committing the ultimate crime by growing old.&quot;

On July 28 of that year, Taylor Hackford&#x27;s motion picture &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; premiered. In it Gossett plays drill instructor Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley. The role was originally conceived for a white actor. Hackford said &quot;when I visited the Navy Officers Flight Training Center in Pensacola, FLA, I discovered that many of the Drill Instructors there were men of color. I found it interesting that Black &amp; Brown enlisted men had &#x27;make-or-break&#x27; control over whether white college graduates would become officers and fighter pilots. At that moment I changed the casting profile for Sergeant Foley and started meeting actors of color. Lou Gossett came to see me – I knew and admired his stage work. He told me that he&#x27;d served in the US Army as a Ranger, so in addition to being an accomplished actor, he knew military life. I hired him on the spot.&quot; Hackford also pointed out that they were impressed because he &quot;played the role as it was written&#x27;&quot; and none of the script was modified &quot;&#x27;to make the character black.&quot; Gossett explained that his mindset guided him toward the part as he blamed both &quot;white unconscious racism&quot; and &quot;black acceptance of that, so a black doesn&#x27;t go out for a part Blacks need to change their mentality to knock down the walls of racism, and this includes trying out for parts like a district attorney or a lawyer or Judge traditional white roles. How do you know they won&#x27;t hire you? I had to reeducate myself Gossett said. There are parts I&#x27;m sure I could have played before I came to this realization.&quot; To prepare for the role Gossett spent 10 days with a drill instructor and lifted weights to improve his upper body. During shooting Gossett&#x27;s accommodation were in different location from the rest of the cast, to keep him emotionally distant from the other actors. The role won him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He was the first African-American actor to win an Oscar in a supporting role and the second African-American to win for acting after Sidney Poitier. Additionally, Gossett won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor at the Golden Globe Awards, and NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture at the NAACP Image Awards.

On September 17 of that year, the science fiction series &quot;The Powers of Matthew Star&quot; premiered. It is about a prince (Peter Barton) and his guardian played by Gossett who escaped their planet after the royal was assassinated. Now living on earth, the prince, who has telekinetic and mind reading abilities, passes for regular high school student who goes on various adventures. Gossett explained that &quot;it&#x27;s another role he says he got because neither he nor those casting the film thought of race.&quot; Of his role he said &quot;people have been complaining a lot lately about the image of the black actor on television. Well, if there was ever a redeeming character, it&#x27;s Walter Sheppard. He teaches goodness, character-building, values and morals to young Matthew. He&#x27;s sort of like Obi-Wan was on &quot;Star Wars&quot;.&quot; The shooting was delayed due to an on set accident that injured both Gossett and more severely Barton. The show lasted until 1983.

In 1983, he played the title role in &quot;Sadat&quot;, a two-part miniseries which chronicled the life and assassination of Egypt president Anwar Sadat. The producers of the show offered the role to Gossett due to his resemblance to Sadat. However, in Egypt, the casting of a black actor as Sadat was controversial, as the Egyptian Ministry of Culture pointed out that the real Sadat was sensitive about his dark complexion for which he was often ridiculed and that &quot;the portrayal of Sadat by a black has revived the issue of race in Egypt, which is usually deeply submerged.&quot; It was among the reasons that a ban on all films and television programs distributed by Columbia Pictures. On playing the role Gossett said &quot;I was becoming over-prepared and stilted. Sadat is so recent in people&#x27;s memory that I wanted to capture him exactly but what I was doing was becoming an imitation and not a living breathing human. I felt Sadat. I felt from the first day on the set that the spirit of Sadat was part of me I began to move more like him talk like him and even think like him. This is the first time in my career that I have not totally memorized all my lines.&quot; For his performance, Gossett was nominated at the Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film.

That same year, Gossett acted in Joe Alves&#x27;s third instalment of the shark attack thriller film series &quot;Jaws 3-D.&quot; On accepting the role, Gossett said &quot;I turned down &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; three or four times,&quot; he admits. &quot;It was just a little part. Finally they said they&#x27;d expand the role.&quot; He also added that he accepted &quot;because there was nothing else. There have not been a lot of offers since &quot;Officer&quot;.&quot; On developing his character he said &quot;I made my character a Creole, it gives him a more interesting flavor. He starts off as a shrewd entrepreneur, but he makes one mistake and everything falls through. He&#x27;s almost like Captain Ahab.&quot; The film grossed $13,422,500 on its opening weekend, which was 1983&#x27;s second highest-grossing opening weekend of the year, playing to 1,311 theaters at its widest release and accounting for 29.5% of its final gross. It has achieved total lifetime worldwide gross of $87,987,055. Reception for the movie was generally negative, it has an 11% &#x27;rotten&#x27; rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10. Its critical consensus reads, &quot;A cheese-soaked ocean thriller with no evident reason to exist, &quot;Jaws 3&quot; bellows forth with a plaintive yet ultimately unheeded cry to put this franchise out of viewers&#x27; misery.&quot; Gossett said he was the &quot;only cast member to survive the generally negative reviews&quot;. At the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards, Gossett was nominated for Worst Supporting Actor.

In 1984, Gossett acted in Richard Lester&#x27;s ensemble comedy &quot;Finders Keepers&quot;. The film generally received good reviews. James Monaco reviewed the film in his book, &quot;The Movie Guide&quot;, and said of the acting &quot;&quot;Finders Keepers&quot; benefits from the well-judged performances of its energetic cast.&quot;

Also that year Gossett and Martin Sheen co-starred in David Greene&#x27;s television film &quot;The Guardian&quot;. The inhabitants of a New York City apartment building are plagued by burglaries and murder, and they have finally had enough. So they employ ex-military man (Gossett ) to protect their building as a security guard. His techniques are precise and intense, and soon his overbearing and power-mad nature begins to chafe resident (Sheen). Gossett&#x27;s role was originally written for a white actor but since he had just won an Oscar for a role that aimed at same demographic he was chosen. Writer Richard Levinson said &quot;Lou had a lot of heat going for him. We didn&#x27;t have to change anything in the script when he was cast.&quot; Gossett appreciated the duality of his role. On the project he said the &quot;script said something about a modern social problem. When I was growing up in Brooklyn, there was a real feeling of community in our neighborhood. That kind of neighborhood is gone, and that&#x27;s one of the reasons for the increase in crime. I think of the character I play as a necessary evil in today&#x27;s society.&quot;

In 1985, Gossett co-starred with Dennis Quaid in Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s &quot;Enemy Mine&quot;. The film is about a human (Quaid) and alien soldier (Gossett), respectively, who become stranded together on an inhospitable planet and must overcome their mutual distrust in order to cooperate and survive. About accepting the project, Gossett explained &quot;everybody turned [the role] down because you couldn&#x27;t see your face or your eyes. &#x27;How can you do a performance?&#x27; So, there&#x27;s a little Lon Chaney Sr. in me, you gotta try it. That&#x27;s why I took it, because it was a challenge.&quot; The production was troubled as the original director and the producer had creative difference. Petersen was asked to take over the directorial duties, however when he joined he found the original location, and footage unusable. Hence the production moved and new set were built. Quaid and Gossett received a salary to wait throughout the transition so they wouldn&#x27;t start working on other projects. Also, Gossett&#x27;s original alien costume was scrapped and it took five months to create the one used in final product. On his preparation Gossett said &quot;I went to the zoo with a mime, a dancer, an athlete and a linguist. There we studied lizards, snakes, wildcats, giraffes and the kangaroos, especially the females with the pouch. I also used a little ordinary cat and dog, and in the scenes where the Drac is in his religious ecstasy, a little bit of Stevie Wonder.&quot; On the scene where the alien gives birth he said &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m gonna try and bear a child. But I wanted to do it. It was a cinematic first for an actor to give birth to a child. It&#x27;s the hardest thing I&#x27;ve ever had to do, physically, but I took it because I would rather fail doing something difficult than succeed doing something too easy.&quot; Petersen said &quot;It took Lou several hours to get into makeup and the sand was always getting under his contact lenses and, yet, he never complained. He also gives a great performance, even though you can only see his lips. He gave us a lot so that the message of friendship and love could come through.&quot; Gossett had to wear two sets of contact lenses, one for protection, the other to give him a lizard-look. However, the protection didn&#x27;t work. After four weeks of shooting, he couldn&#x27;t open his eyes, which were bloodshot-red. It took two weeks for him to get better and it was estimated it would take a year or two to heal entirely. Also, his costume was glued to his body and he had to be treated for severe abrasion and rashes. Upon the release of the film, Gossett explained that &quot;barely a day went by during the filming of &quot;Enemy Mine&quot; that he didn&#x27;t think about going home, wondering if he was giving too much for art. However, it led him to be more than satisfied with both his own performance and the film.&quot; The film was a flop at the box office, and the critics were divided on whether the it was great or bad. Over the years, the film developed a cult and started to receive positive re-assessments. Michael Wilmington of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; loved the film and said &quot;Gossett always in perfect control. What he does here seems nearly the stripped down, boiled-off essence of the actor&#x27;s art. It&#x27;s amazing that he can communicate so much subtlety, emotion and strangeness beneath all those layers of latex and paint, those fishy scales, greenish limbs and faceted contact lenses. He&#x27;s credibly extraterrestrial and touchingly human.&quot;

In 1986, in Sidney J. Furie&#x27;s military aviation thriller &quot;Iron Eagle&quot;, Gossett played a retired Air Force colonel, Charles &#x27;Chappy&#x27; Sinclair, who helps young man (Jason Gedrick) save his father who&#x27;s held prisoner in the middle East. Gossett accepted the part &quot;because it offered a positive relationship between blacks and whites with race not being an issue or even mentioned.&quot; The review were mostly negative, however Janet Maslin of the &quot;New York Times&quot; gave the film a favorable review, and said that &quot;both leading actors are quite effective.&quot; The film made $24,159,872 at the U.S. box office. Although the movie was not a major success at the cinema, it generated $11 million in home video sales, enough to justify a sequel.

Also that year, Gossett co-lead with Chuck Norris in J. Lee Thompson&#x27;s action-adventure comedy film &quot;Firewalker&quot;. Gossett and Norris play two seasoned treasure hunters whose adventures rarely result in any notable success. At the time Norris was known for successful action films where he portrayed stoic heroes, he explained that he wanted to show a lighter side of himself. Gossett appreciated Norris efforts and said &quot;I have great respect for what actors call stretch. Chuck had to open up first to allow this atmosphere. It has to do with his desire to stretch. Someone else could have been quite insecure. He chose to open up. He&#x27;s studying hard and he&#x27;s serious.&quot; The review were mostly negative, while some thought it was a fine for a light action film. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; enjoyed it of the cast he said they &quot;really get into the light-hearted spirit of the occasion.&quot; The film made $11,834,302 at the box-office.

In 1987, Gossett acted in Volker Schlöndorff&#x27;s &quot;A Gathering of Old Men&quot;. Gossett was very enthusiastic of the project and said &quot;it&#x27;s a strange, pleasant twist. The viewer thinks the story will go one way, and it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a beautiful and touching story&quot;. He explained that his character &quot;is always there. You look at him, and there&#x27;s the eyes and face. He doesn&#x27;t have all that much dialogue. That makes him very hard to do as an actor. &quot;What you have to do is use more concentration. When there are no lines, you write lines in your mind and those moments have to be clean. A director can&#x27;t really help you. The satisfaction is that, after you see it, it&#x27;s all there. The director didn&#x27;t cut anything I did.&quot; While it was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival, it was released as television film in the United States. For his performance, Gossett was nominated at the Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special.

<text>Timothy Hutton (born August 16, 1960) is an American actor and film director. He is the youngest recipient of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, which he won at age 20 for &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980). Hutton has since appeared regularly in feature films and on television, with roles in the drama &quot;Taps&quot; (1981), the spy film &quot;The Falcon and the Snowman&quot; (1985), and the horror film &quot;The Dark Half&quot; (1993), among others.

Between 2000 and 2002, Hutton starred as Archie Goodwin in the A&amp;E drama series &quot;A Nero Wolfe Mystery&quot;. Between 2008 and 2012, he starred as Nathan &quot;Nate&quot; Ford on the TNT drama series &quot;Leverage&quot;. He also had a role in the first season of the Amazon streaming drama series &quot;Jack Ryan&quot;.

==Early life==
Timothy Hutton was born in Malibu, California. His father was actor Jim Hutton; his mother, Maryline Adams (née Poole), was a teacher. His parents divorced when Hutton was three years old, and his mother took him and his older sister, Heidi, with her to Boston, and then to her hometown Harwinton, Connecticut. The family returned to California when Hutton was 12. 

&quot;A lot of people think that because my father was an actor, I come from this big show-business background,&quot; Hutton told Bruce Cook of &quot;American Film&quot; magazine in 1981.

But that&#x27;s not how I grew up at all. My mother took us to Cambridge because she wanted to get her M.A. She wound up teaching in Connecticut, but the way she saw it, after a while, if we all stayed there, my sister and I would just wind up as the proprietors of the local drugstore or something, so that was why she took us to Berkeley, California—to get us into the world, I guess. Now she&#x27;s given up teaching and she&#x27;s into printing miniature books.

In 1976, when Hutton was 15, he sought out his father and moved in with him in Los Angeles. At Fairfax High School, while playing Nathan Detroit in a school production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, he realized he wanted to become an actor. With encouragement from both of his parents, he began acting in television.

On June 2, 1979, Jim Hutton died in Los Angeles from liver cancer, two days after his 45th birthday. In 1981, Hutton thanked his father during his Academy Award speech, which he had won for his role in the movie &quot;Ordinary People&quot;.

==Acting career==
Timothy Hutton&#x27;s career began with parts in several television movies, most notably the 1979 ABC TV film &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;. That year, he also played the son of Donna Reed in the Ross Hunter NBC television film &quot;The Best Place to Be&quot;. He then made two CBS made-for TV films in 1980: &quot;Young Love, First Love&quot; with Valerie Bertinelli, and &quot;Father Figure&quot; with Hal Linden. For his first feature film performance, as Conrad Jarrett in &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980), Hutton won both the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. His performance also earned him the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture – Male. Immediately following his success, he starred in the acclaimed 1981 ABC television film &quot;A Long Way Home&quot; co-starring Brenda Vaccaro. 

Hutton&#x27;s next feature film, &quot;Taps&quot; (with George C. Scott, Sean Penn, and Tom Cruise), was popular with critics and audiences, but during the next several years, his motion pictures, such as &quot;Iceman&quot;, &quot;Daniel&quot;, &quot;Turk 182&quot;, &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;, and &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;, struggled at the box office. His only substantial hit was 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Falcon and the Snowman&quot; which teamed him again with Sean Penn.

In 1984, he directed the music video for the song &quot;Drive&quot; by The Cars.

In 1989, he made his Broadway stage debut opposite his &quot;Ordinary People&quot; co-star Elizabeth McGovern in the A.R. Gurney play &quot;Love Letters&quot;. He followed this with another Broadway role in the Craig Lucas hit comedy, &quot;Prelude to a Kiss&quot;, which also starred Mary-Louise Parker and Barnard Hughes. 

During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Hutton began to take large supporting parts in films, most notably in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s All-American&quot; with Jessica Lange and Dennis Quaid and &quot;French Kiss&quot; with Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline. In 1996, he starred in the popular ensemble film, &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot;, playing opposite 14-year-old Natalie Portman in one of her early standout film roles.

Moving on to television, he starred as Nero Wolfe&#x27;s assistant and leg-man Archie Goodwin in the A&amp;E television series &quot;A Nero Wolfe Mystery&quot; (2001–2002); he also served as an executive producer, and also directed several episodes of the series. His other directing credits include the family film &quot;Digging to China&quot; (1997). In 2001 Hutton starred in the television miniseries &quot;WW3&quot;, and in 2006 he had a lead role in the NBC series &quot;Kidnapped&quot;, playing Conrad Cain, the wealthy father of a kidnapped teenager. He appeared in 13 feature films from 2006 to 2008.

Hutton starred in the television series &quot;Leverage&quot; from 2008 to 2012, where he played former insurance investigator Nate Ford, who led a group of thieves who acted as modern-day Robin Hoods.

In 2014, Hutton was cast opposite Felicity Huffman in John Ridley&#x27;s ABC crime drama &quot;American Crime&quot;.

==Other pursuits==
Hutton is one of the owners of the New York City restaurant and bar P. J. Clarke&#x27;s. In 2003 he became president of Players, a New York actors&#x27; club, but he resigned in June 2008 due to work keeping him in Los Angeles. He has also made a few forays into directing, the most famous of which includes the music video for the Cars&#x27; hit single &quot;Drive&quot; in 1984. In 2010, he directed the music video for &quot;The House Rules&quot; by country rocker/Leverage co-star Christian Kane. He also directed several episodes of A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;A Nero Wolfe Mystery&quot;, in which he also starred.

Hutton starred in a Groupon commercial during the 2011 Super Bowl, which drew public ire for the parodying of the Tibetan resistance movement. The commercials were pulled from rotation on February 10 after continued negative response from the public and activist groups.

==Personal life==

Hutton has been married twice. His first marriage (1986–1990) was to actress Debra Winger; they had a son in 1987.

Hutton dated Elizabeth McGovern, Diane Lane, Patti Davis, Demi Moore, Mary-Louise Parker, Uma Thurman, and Angelina Jolie.

In 2000, he married illustrator Aurore Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, niece of former French president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. Their son was born the following year, in Paris. In July 2009, &quot;Us Weekly&quot; reported that Hutton and Giscard d&#x27;Estaing had separated.

=== Rape accusation ===
In November 2019, Sera Johnston, a former child model and actress, filed a criminal complaint with the Vancouver Police department accusing Hutton of raping her in 1983, when she was 14. Hutton, who was 22 when the alleged incident occurred, &quot;completely and unequivocally&quot; denied the accusations and filed a criminal complaint against Johnston for extortion. In July 2021, Canadian authorities closed their investigation into Johnston&#x27;s accusations without filing charges.

==Early life==
Joel Grey was born Joel Katz in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Goldie &quot;Grace&quot; (née Epstein) and Mickey Katz, an actor, comedian, and musician. Both his parents were Jewish. He attended Alexander Hamilton High School in Los Angeles, California.

==Career==
=== Early career ===

Grey started his career, at age 10, in the Cleveland Play House&#x27;s Curtain Pullers children&#x27;s theatre program in the early 1940s, appearing in productions such as &quot;Grandmother Slyboots&quot;, &quot;Jack of Tarts&quot; and a lead role in their mainstage production of &quot;On Borrowed Time&quot;. By 1952, at age 20, he was appearing as a featured performer at the Copacabana nightclub in New York.
He changed his last name from Katz to Grey early in his career due to the stigma associated with having a surname with an obvious ethnicity attached. Grey made his Broadway acting debut in &quot;Borscht Capades&quot; where he was credited as &quot;Joel Kaye&quot;. He returned to Broadway in &quot;The Littlest Revue&quot; in 1956 and acted as a replacement in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot; in 1961 and the musicals &quot;Stop the World – I Want to Get Off&quot; in 1962, and &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; in 1965.

He started his professional television career on &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; from 1951 to 1954. He then took on roles in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Grey appeared in several TV westerns including &quot;Maverick&quot; (1959), &quot;Bronco&quot; (1960) and &quot;Lawman&quot; (3 times in 1960 and 1961).
=== 1966–1979: Breakthrough ===
Grey gained his breakthrough performance originating the role of the Master of ceremonies in the Broadway musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; by John Kander and Fred Ebb in 1966. He received raves for his role as the malevolent and sinister emcee of the Kit Kat Club. He won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical at the 21st Tony Awards.

Grey appeared as a panelist for the television game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in the 1967 season, as well as being the first Mystery Guest during its syndication in 1968. His followup role on Broadway was as George M. Cohan in the 1968 musical &quot;George M!&quot;. Grey was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical at the 23rd Tony Awards and received the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Performance.

Grey reprised his role as the Master of ceremonies in the 1972 Bob Fosse directed film version of &quot;Cabaret&quot;. Fosse, who was hired to direct the film version because Harold Prince was unavailable, wanted to recast the MC role, but the studio insisted on Grey. Fosse backed down on his &quot;It&#x27;s either me or Joel&quot; threat, but relations between them were cool. He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor at the 45th Academy Awards in March 1973 for his performance. His victory was part of a &quot;Cabaret&quot; near-sweep, which saw Liza Minnelli win Best Actress and Fosse win Best Director, although it lost the Best Picture Oscar to &quot;The Godfather.&quot; For that role, Grey also won the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer at the 26th British Academy Film Awards and Best Supporting Actor awards from the Golden Globes, Kansas City Film Critics Circle, National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, National Society of Film Critics, and a Tony Award for his original stage performance six years prior, making him one of only ten people who have won both a Tony Award and an Academy Award for the same role.

He was the guest star for the first episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in its first season in 1976, singing &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; from &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Willkommen&quot; from &quot;Cabaret&quot;. He has performed at The Muny in St. Louis, Missouri, in roles such as George M. Cohan in &quot;George M!&quot; (1970 and 1992), the Emcee in &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1971), and Joey Evans in &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1983). At the Williamstown Theatre Festival, Grey played the title role of Mikhail Platonov in their production of &quot;Platonov&quot; (1977). He returned to Broadway in the play &quot;Goodtime Charley&quot; (1975), and the musical &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; (1979), receiving Tony nominations for each.

=== 1980–1999 ===

He also played Master of Sinanju Chiun, Remo Williams (Fred Ward)&#x27;s elderly Korean martial arts master in the movie &quot;Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins&quot; (1985), a role that garnered him a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor at the 13th Saturn Awards and a second Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture at the 43rd Golden Globe Awards. Grey&#x27;s character Chiun was popular for the lines &quot;Meat of cow kills&quot;, and &quot;You move like a pregnant yak&quot;, from the movie. He then acted in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s mystery thriller &quot;Kafka&quot; (1991), starring Jeremy Irons, Theresa Russell and Ian Holm. In 1991, he played Adam, a devil, in &quot;Conundrum&quot;, a two-part season 14 episode and the series finale of the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; (1991). That same year, Grey also appeared in the American Repertory Theater&#x27;s production of &quot;When We Dead Awaken&quot; at the São Paulo Biennial.

He narrated the animated film &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot; (1992), and made a cameo appearance as himself in the Robert Altman film &quot;The Player&quot; (1992). The following year he starred in the Philip Haas drama film &quot;The Music of Chance&quot; (1993) alongside James Spader, Mandy Patinkin, M. Emmet Walsh, and Charles Durning. The film premiered at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. Later that year he starred in New York Stage and Film&#x27;s production of John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s &quot;A Fool and Her Fortune&quot; and received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series at the 45th Primetime Emmy Awards for his recurring role as Jacob Prossman on the television series &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot;. In 1995, he made a guest appearance on the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Resistance&quot; as Caylem, an aging rebel seeking to free his (deceased) wife from prison. In November 1995, he performed as the Wizard of Oz in &quot;The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True&quot;, a staged concert of the popular story at Lincoln Center to benefit the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund. The performance was originally broadcast on Turner Network Television (TNT) in November 1995, and released on CD and video in 1996.

He returned to Broadway as Amos Hart in the revival of the Bob Fosse musical &quot;Chicago&quot; (1996). Set in Chicago in the Jazz Age, the musical is based on a 1926 play of the same title by reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins, about actual criminals and crimes on which she reported. The story is a satire on corruption in the administration of criminal justice and the concept of the &quot;celebrity criminal&quot;. The revival was well received and Grey earned the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical. In 1999, he starred in Brian Friel&#x27;s &quot;Give Me Your Answer, Do!&quot; mounted by Roundabout Theatre Company.

=== 2000–2010 ===

In 2000, Grey played Oldrich Novy in the Lars von Trier film &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; and acted in the musical film &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; and in the dark comedy &quot;Choke&quot; (2008). During this time he also appeared extensively on television. He had a recurring role as the evil reptilian demon Doc in The WB horror series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (2001), Lemuel Idzik in the HBO prison drama &quot;Oz&quot; (2003) and as Another Mr. Sloane in the ABC series &quot;Alias&quot; (2005). He played Milton Winters, a wealthy, paroled ex-convict on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; (episode &quot;Cuba Libre&quot;, 2003). He also appeared on the shows &quot;House&quot; and &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; (2007), on the latter of which he played the role of Dr. Bar-Shalom, Sarah Walker (Rachel Griffiths) and Joe Whedon (John Pyper-Ferguson)&#x27;s marriage counselor. He appeared as Dr. Singer, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl)&#x27;s high school teacher who needs treatment for dementia in &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (2009).

Grey originated the role of the Wizard of Oz in the Stephen Schwartz Broadway musical &quot;Wicked&quot;. Grey took over the role from Robert Morse who previously played the Wizard in the San Francisco tryout run at the Curran Theatre. It is based on the 1995 Gregory Maguire novel &quot;&quot;, in turn based on L. Frank Baum&#x27;s 1900 novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; and its 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film adaptation. Grey acted alongside Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. The play received mixed reviews from critics but was an immediate financial hit. Grey was nominated for the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical.

=== 2011–present ===
Grey returned to Broadway in spring 2011 as Moonface Martin in the Roundabout Theatre Company revival of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre. Having previously portrayed Ned Weeks in the 1985 Off-Broadway production of Larry Kramer&#x27;s &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;, he went on to co-direct with George C. Wolfe the Tony Award-winning revival in 2011, for which he and Wolfe were nominated for Best Direction of a Play at the 65th Tony Awards. The following year he made a guest appearance in the Showtime series &quot;Nurse Jackie&quot; opposite Edie Falco. He also acted in &quot;&quot; (2014), and &quot;Park Bench with Steve Buscemi&quot; (2014).

He returned to Broadway in the 2016 revival of the Anton Chekhov play &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; starring opposite Diane Lane, and Chuck Cooper.
In 2018, Grey directed a Yiddish-language production of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, which originated at the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene, then transferred to Stage 42 Off-Broadway. The production became a surprise hit, running for over a year and winning the 2019 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical and Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Musical Revival. He had a cameo role in the Lin-Manuel Miranda directed musical &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot; (2021). In 2022 he acted as Morgan Bote, a recurring character in the FX drama series &quot;The Old Man&quot; starring Jeff Bridges and John Lithgow.

<text>Correlophus sarasinorum, also called commonly Roux&#x27;s giant gecko, Sarasins&#x27; giant gecko, Sarasin&#x27;s [sic] giant gecko (incorrectly), and the suras gecko, is a species of lizard in the family Diplodactylidae. The species is native to the southern portions of the outlying New Caledonian island of Grande Terre.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;sarasinorum&quot; (masculine, genitive, plural), is in honor of Swiss zoologists Karl Friedrich Sarasin and Paul Benedict Sarasin, who were cousins.

==Conservation status==
&quot;C. sarasinorum&quot; is currently being evaluated by CITES for protective status and is considered vulnerable to extinction in many herpetological circles. It has been found only in six locales in its native habitat.

==Description==
Since there is a considerable variation in snout-to-vent length (SVL) of &quot;C. sarasinorum&quot;, which ranges from 3.5 to 5.5 inches (9 to 14 centimeters), it has been suggested that more than one subspecies exists; there is no universal consensus on this point. The basic color of the suras gecko is brown to gray. Two color patterns exist. A white spotted version is the recessive trait, and a white &quot;V&quot; pattern is the dominant trait. The gecko&#x27;s appearance has often been described as similar to a large &quot;Correlophus ciliatus&quot;, with larger eyes.

==Habitat==
The preferred natural habitats of &quot;C. sarasinorum&quot; are forest and shrubland, at altitudes of .

==Behavior==
&quot;C. sarasinorum&quot; is nocturnal, and less arboreal than the other &quot;Rhacodactylus&quot; (&quot;sensu lato&quot;) geckos. It is often found hiding under the leaf litter or under loose bark. This species has an animal instinct of sleeping on top of plants or in small trees face up preventing the common FTS (Floppy Tail Syndrome) caused by the gecko sleeping upside down.

==Diet==
&quot;C. sarasinorum&quot; is an omnivore and is also considered to be frugivorous. In the wild it eats insects and fruit.

==Reproduction==
The female &quot;C. sarasinorum&quot; lays two eggs which are buried in a soft, damp substrate. The eggs hatch 60–90 days after being laid.

==In captivity==
The species &quot;C. sarasinorum&quot; is sometimes seen in captivity.

<text>Islwyn Ffowc Elis (; 17 November 1924 – 22 January 2004) was one of Wales&#x27;s most popular Welsh-language writers.

Born Islwyn Ffoulkes Ellis in Wrexham and raised in Glyn Ceiriog, Elis was educated at the University of Wales colleges of Bangor and Aberystwyth. During World War II he was a conscientious objector and he began writing poetry and prose, winning the prose medal at the 1951 National Eisteddfod. He became a Presbyterian minister in 1950, and his first pastorate was at Moreia Chapel in Llanfair Caereinion. He translated the Gospel of Matthew into Welsh as &quot;Efengyl Mathew - trosiad i gymraeg diweddar&quot;, which was published in Caernarfon in 1961.

He made his debut as a novelist in 1953 with &quot;Cysgod y Cryman&quot; (translated into English as &quot;Shadow of the Sickle&quot;), which would, in 1999, be chosen as the most significant Welsh language book of the 20th century.

As a novelist Elis showed a great willingness to try out different forms, including popular ones. Cysgod y Cryman was followed by a study of intellectual decadence, &quot;Ffenestri tua&#x27;r Gwyll&quot; (Windows to the Dusk 1955). &quot;Yn ôl i Leifior&quot; (1956; translated into English as &quot;Return to Lleifior&quot;) was a sequel to &quot;Cysgod y Cryman&quot; both set at the fictitious farming location Lleifior. In 1957, the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru published his time-travel story Wythnos yng Nghymru Fydd (A Week in Future Wales), presenting an independent, utopian Wales and a dystopian &quot;Western England&quot; in alternative versions of 2033. &quot;Blas y Cynfyd&quot; (A Taste of Prehistory 1958) was followed by the colonial satire &quot;Tabyrddau&#x27;r Babongo&quot; (Drums of the Babongo 1961). He thus pioneered the use of genres unfamiliar to Welsh-speaking readers, provided them with a highly readable prose often set in contemporary settings, and did much to establish the position of the novel as a major genre in Welsh-language literature. For periods he set out to live off his writing, something hardly attempted before in modern Welsh.

Later works included &quot;Y Blaned Dirion&quot; (The Meek Planet 1968, another science fiction novel), &quot;Y Gromlech yn yr Haidd&quot; (The Dolmen in the Barley, 1971) and &quot;Eira Mawr&quot; (Great Snow, 1972). He also wrote a play, pamphlets, hundreds of articles and short stories as well as editing, with Gwyn Jones, &quot;Welsh Short Stories&quot; for the Oxford University Press (1956). His work has appeared in English, German, Italian and Irish translation. He was lecturer and reader at the University of Wales, Lampeter between 1975 and 1988.

From his schooldays to the mid-1970s, Elis devoted a vast amount of time to politics. He ran as Plaid Cymru&#x27;s candidate in Montgomeryshire in the 1959 and 1964 general elections and in a 1962 byelection. The so-called &quot;Elvis Rock&quot; graffito beside the A44 road in Ceredigion was originally written with the word &quot;Ellis&quot; by two of his supporters in the 1962 by-election, and subsequently altered to read &quot;Elvis&quot;.

In retirement, he received a DLitt from the University of Wales. In 1999 a biography of Elis by T Robin Chapman, published in both Welsh and in English, appeared.

In 2021, his novel Wythnos yng Nghymru Fydd that was translated into English by Stephen Morris (in 2019) was published as A Week in Future Wales by Cambria Futura.

<text>Algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory is a subject area in mathematics with connections to geometry, topology, ring theory, and number theory. Geometric, algebraic, and arithmetic objects are assigned objects called &quot;K&quot;-groups. These are groups in the sense of abstract algebra. They contain detailed information about the original object but are notoriously difficult to compute; for example, an important outstanding problem is to compute the &quot;K&quot;-groups of the integers.

&quot;K&quot;-theory was discovered in the late 1950s by Alexander Grothendieck in his study of intersection theory on algebraic varieties. In the modern language, Grothendieck defined only &quot;K&quot;0, the zeroth &quot;K&quot;-group, but even this single group has plenty of applications, such as the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem. Intersection theory is still a motivating force in the development of (higher) algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory through its links with motivic cohomology and specifically Chow groups. The subject also includes classical number-theoretic topics like quadratic reciprocity and embeddings of number fields into the real numbers and complex numbers, as well as more modern concerns like the construction of higher regulators and special values of &quot;L&quot;-functions.

The lower &quot;K&quot;-groups were discovered first, in the sense that adequate descriptions of these groups in terms of other algebraic structures were found. For example, if &quot;F&quot; is a field, then is isomorphic to the integers Z and is closely related to the notion of vector space dimension. For a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, the group is related to the Picard group of &quot;R&quot;, and when &quot;R&quot; is the ring of integers in a number field, this generalizes the classical construction of the class group. The group &quot;K&quot;1(&quot;R&quot;) is closely related to the group of units , and if &quot;R&quot; is a field, it is exactly the group of units. For a number field &quot;F&quot;, the group &quot;K&quot;2(&quot;F&quot;) is related to class field theory, the Hilbert symbol, and the solvability of quadratic equations over completions. In contrast, finding the correct definition of the higher &quot;K&quot;-groups of rings was a difficult achievement of Daniel Quillen, and many of the basic facts about the higher &quot;K&quot;-groups of algebraic varieties were not known until the work of Robert Thomason.

== History ==

The history of &quot;K&quot;-theory was detailed by Charles Weibel.

=== The Grothendieck group &quot;K&quot;0 ===

In the 19th century, Bernhard Riemann and his student Gustav Roch proved what is now known as the Riemann–Roch theorem. If &quot;X&quot; is a Riemann surface, then the sets of meromorphic functions and meromorphic differential forms on &quot;X&quot; form vector spaces. A line bundle on &quot;X&quot; determines subspaces of these vector spaces, and if &quot;X&quot; is projective, then these subspaces are finite dimensional. The Riemann–Roch theorem states that the difference in dimensions between these subspaces is equal to the degree of the line bundle (a measure of twistedness) plus one minus the genus of &quot;X&quot;. In the mid-20th century, the Riemann–Roch theorem was generalized by Friedrich Hirzebruch to all algebraic varieties. In Hirzebruch&#x27;s formulation, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, the theorem became a statement about Euler characteristics: The Euler characteristic of a vector bundle on an algebraic variety (which is the alternating sum of the dimensions of its cohomology groups) equals the Euler characteristic of the trivial bundle plus a correction factor coming from characteristic classes of the vector bundle. This is a generalization because on a projective Riemann surface, the Euler characteristic of a line bundle equals the difference in dimensions mentioned previously, the Euler characteristic of the trivial bundle is one minus the genus, and the only nontrivial characteristic class is the degree.

The subject of &quot;K&quot;-theory takes its name from a 1957 construction of Alexander Grothendieck which appeared in the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem, his generalization of Hirzebruch&#x27;s theorem. Let &quot;X&quot; be a smooth algebraic variety. To each vector bundle on &quot;X&quot;, Grothendieck associates an invariant, its &quot;class&quot;. The set of all classes on &quot;X&quot; was called &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) from the German &quot;Klasse&quot;. By definition, &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is a quotient of the free abelian group on isomorphism classes of vector bundles on &quot;X&quot;, and so it is an abelian group. If the basis element corresponding to a vector bundle &quot;V&quot; is denoted [&quot;V&quot;], then for each short exact sequence of vector bundles:
:formula_1
Grothendieck imposed the relation . These generators and relations define &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), and they imply that it is the universal way to assign invariants to vector bundles in a way compatible with exact sequences.

Grothendieck took the perspective that the Riemann–Roch theorem is a statement about morphisms of varieties, not the varieties themselves. He proved that there is a homomorphism from &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) to the Chow groups of &quot;X&quot; coming from the Chern character and Todd class of &quot;X&quot;. Additionally, he proved that a proper morphism to a smooth variety &quot;Y&quot; determines a homomorphism called the &quot;pushforward&quot;. This gives two ways of determining an element in the Chow group of &quot;Y&quot; from a vector bundle on &quot;X&quot;: Starting from &quot;X&quot;, one can first compute the pushforward in &quot;K&quot;-theory and then apply the Chern character and Todd class of &quot;Y&quot;, or one can first apply the Chern character and Todd class of &quot;X&quot; and then compute the pushforward for Chow groups. The Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem says that these are equal. When &quot;Y&quot; is a point, a vector bundle is a vector space, the class of a vector space is its dimension, and the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem specializes to Hirzebruch&#x27;s theorem.

The group &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is now known as &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;X&quot;). Upon replacing vector bundles by projective modules, &quot;K&quot;0 also became defined for non-commutative rings, where it had applications to group representations. Atiyah and Hirzebruch quickly transported Grothendieck&#x27;s construction to topology and used it to define topological K-theory. Topological &quot;K&quot;-theory was one of the first examples of an extraordinary cohomology theory: It associates to each topological space &quot;X&quot; (satisfying some mild technical constraints) a sequence of groups &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) which satisfy all the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms except the normalization axiom. The setting of algebraic varieties, however, is much more rigid, and the flexible constructions used in topology were not available. While the group &quot;K&quot;0 seemed to satisfy the necessary properties to be the beginning of a cohomology theory of algebraic varieties and of non-commutative rings, there was no clear definition of the higher &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). Even as such definitions were developed, technical issues surrounding restriction and gluing usually forced &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; to be defined only for rings, not for varieties.

=== &quot;K&quot;0, &quot;K&quot;1, and &quot;K&quot;2 ===

A group closely related to &quot;K&quot;1 for group rings was earlier introduced by J.H.C. Whitehead. Henri Poincaré had attempted to define the Betti numbers of a manifold in terms of a triangulation. His methods, however, had a serious gap: Poincaré could not prove that two triangulations of a manifold always yielded the same Betti numbers. It was clearly true that Betti numbers were unchanged by subdividing the triangulation, and therefore it was clear that any two triangulations that shared a common subdivision had the same Betti numbers. What was not known was that any two triangulations admitted a common subdivision. This hypothesis became a conjecture known as the &quot;Hauptvermutung&quot; (roughly &quot;main conjecture&quot;). The fact that triangulations were stable under subdivision led J.H.C. Whitehead to introduce the notion of simple homotopy type. A simple homotopy equivalence is defined in terms of adding simplices or cells to a simplicial complex or cell complex in such a way that each additional simplex or cell deformation retracts into a subdivision of the old space. Part of the motivation for this definition is that a subdivision of a triangulation is simple homotopy equivalent to the original triangulation, and therefore two triangulations that share a common subdivision must be simple homotopy equivalent. Whitehead proved that simple homotopy equivalence is a finer invariant than homotopy equivalence by introducing an invariant called the &quot;torsion&quot;. The torsion of a homotopy equivalence takes values in a group now called the &quot;Whitehead group&quot; and denoted &quot;Wh&quot;(&quot;π&quot;), where &quot;π&quot; is the fundamental group of the target complex. Whitehead found examples of non-trivial torsion and thereby proved that some homotopy equivalences were not simple. The Whitehead group was later discovered to be a quotient of &quot;K&quot;1(Zπ&quot;), where Zπ&quot; is the integral group ring of &quot;π&quot;. Later John Milnor used Reidemeister torsion, an invariant related to Whitehead torsion, to disprove the Hauptvermutung.

The first adequate definition of &quot;K&quot;1 of a ring was made by Hyman Bass and Stephen Schanuel. In topological &quot;K&quot;-theory, &quot;K&quot;1 is defined using vector bundles on a suspension of the space. All such vector bundles come from the clutching construction, where two trivial vector bundles on two halves of a space are glued along a common strip of the space. This gluing data is expressed using the general linear group, but elements of that group coming from elementary matrices (matrices corresponding to elementary row or column operations) define equivalent gluings. Motivated by this, the Bass–Schanuel definition of &quot;K&quot;1 of a ring &quot;R&quot; is , where &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is the infinite general linear group (the union of all &quot;GL&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;)) and &quot;E&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is the subgroup of elementary matrices. They also provided a definition of &quot;K&quot;0 of a homomorphism of rings and proved that &quot;K&quot;0 and &quot;K&quot;1 could be fit together into an exact sequence similar to the relative homology exact sequence.

Work in &quot;K&quot;-theory from this period culminated in Bass&#x27; book &quot;Algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory&quot;. In addition to providing a coherent exposition of the results then known, Bass improved many of the statements of the theorems. Of particular note is that Bass, building on his earlier work with Murthy, provided the first proof of what is now known as the fundamental theorem of algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory. This is a four-term exact sequence relating &quot;K&quot;0 of a ring &quot;R&quot; to &quot;K&quot;1 of &quot;R&quot;, the polynomial ring &quot;R&quot;[&quot;t&quot;], and the localization &quot;R&quot;[&quot;t&quot;, &quot;t&quot;−1]. Bass recognized that this theorem provided a description of &quot;K&quot;0 entirely in terms of &quot;K&quot;1. By applying this description recursively, he produced negative &quot;K&quot;-groups &quot;K&quot;−n(&quot;R&quot;). In independent work, Max Karoubi gave another definition of negative &quot;K&quot;-groups for certain categories and proved that his definitions yielded that same groups as those of Bass.

The next major development in the subject came with the definition of &quot;K&quot;2. Steinberg studied the universal central extensions of a Chevalley group over a field and gave an explicit presentation of this group in terms of generators and relations. In the case of the group E&quot;n&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) of elementary matrices, the universal central extension is now written St&quot;n&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) and called the &quot;Steinberg group&quot;. In the spring of 1967, John Milnor defined &quot;K&quot;2(&quot;R&quot;) to be the kernel of the homomorphism . The group &quot;K&quot;2 further extended some of the exact sequences known for &quot;K&quot;1 and &quot;K&quot;0, and it had striking applications to number theory. Hideya Matsumoto&#x27;s 1968 thesis showed that for a field &quot;F&quot;, &quot;K&quot;2(&quot;F&quot;) was isomorphic to:
:formula_2
This relation is also satisfied by the Hilbert symbol, which expresses the solvability of quadratic equations over local fields. In particular, John Tate was able to prove that &quot;K&quot;2(Q) is essentially structured around the law of quadratic reciprocity.

=== Higher &quot;K&quot;-groups ===

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, several definitions of higher &quot;K&quot;-theory were proposed. Swan and Gersten both produced definitions of &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; for all &quot;n&quot;, and Gersten proved that his and Swan&#x27;s theories were equivalent, but the two theories were not known to satisfy all the expected properties. Nobile and Villamayor also proposed a definition of higher &quot;K&quot;-groups. Karoubi and Villamayor defined well-behaved &quot;K&quot;-groups for all &quot;n&quot;, but their equivalent of &quot;K&quot;1 was sometimes a proper quotient of the Bass–Schanuel &quot;K&quot;1. Their &quot;K&quot;-groups are now called &quot;KV&quot;&quot;n&quot; and are related to homotopy-invariant modifications of &quot;K&quot;-theory.

Inspired in part by Matsumoto&#x27;s theorem, Milnor made a definition of the higher &quot;K&quot;-groups of a field. He referred to his definition as &quot;purely &quot;ad hoc&quot;&quot;, and it neither appeared to generalize to all rings nor did it appear to be the correct definition of the higher &quot;K&quot;-theory of fields. Much later, it was discovered by Nesterenko and Suslin and by Totaro that Milnor &quot;K&quot;-theory is actually a direct summand of the true &quot;K&quot;-theory of the field. Specifically, &quot;K&quot;-groups have a filtration called the &quot;weight filtration&quot;, and the Milnor &quot;K&quot;-theory of a field is the highest weight-graded piece of the &quot;K&quot;-theory. Additionally, Thomason discovered that there is no analog of Milnor &quot;K&quot;-theory for a general variety.

The first definition of higher &quot;K&quot;-theory to be widely accepted was Daniel Quillen&#x27;s. As part of Quillen&#x27;s work on the Adams conjecture in topology, he had constructed maps from the classifying spaces &quot;BGL&quot;(F&quot;q&quot;) to the homotopy fiber of , where &quot;ψ&quot;&quot;q&quot; is the &quot;q&quot;th Adams operation acting on the classifying space &quot;BU&quot;. This map is acyclic, and after modifying &quot;BGL&quot;(F&quot;q&quot;) slightly to produce a new space &quot;BGL&quot;(F&quot;q&quot;)+, the map became a homotopy equivalence. This modification was called the plus construction. The Adams operations had been known to be related to Chern classes and to &quot;K&quot;-theory since the work of Grothendieck, and so Quillen was led to define the &quot;K&quot;-theory of &quot;R&quot; as the homotopy groups of &quot;BGL&quot;(&quot;R&quot;)+. Not only did this recover &quot;K&quot;1 and &quot;K&quot;2, the relation of &quot;K&quot;-theory to the Adams operations allowed Quillen to compute the &quot;K&quot;-groups of finite fields.

The classifying space &quot;BGL&quot; is connected, so Quillen&#x27;s definition failed to give the correct value for &quot;K&quot;0. Additionally, it did not give any negative &quot;K&quot;-groups. Since &quot;K&quot;0 had a known and accepted definition it was possible to sidestep this difficulty, but it remained technically awkward. Conceptually, the problem was that the definition sprung from &quot;GL&quot;, which was classically the source of &quot;K&quot;1. Because &quot;GL&quot; knows only about gluing vector bundles, not about the vector bundles themselves, it was impossible for it to describe &quot;K&quot;0.

Inspired by conversations with Quillen, Segal soon introduced another approach to constructing algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory under the name of Γ-objects. Segal&#x27;s approach is a homotopy analog of Grothendieck&#x27;s construction of &quot;K&quot;0. Where Grothendieck worked with isomorphism classes of bundles, Segal worked with the bundles themselves and used isomorphisms of the bundles as part of his data. This results in a spectrum whose homotopy groups are the higher &quot;K&quot;-groups (including &quot;K&quot;0). However, Segal&#x27;s approach was only able to impose relations for split exact sequences, not general exact sequences. In the category of projective modules over a ring, every short exact sequence splits, and so Γ-objects could be used to define the &quot;K&quot;-theory of a ring. However, there are non-split short exact sequences in the category of vector bundles on a variety and in the category of all modules over a ring, so Segal&#x27;s approach did not apply to all cases of interest.

In the spring of 1972, Quillen found another approach to the construction of higher &quot;K&quot;-theory which was to prove enormously successful. This new definition began with an exact category, a category satisfying certain formal properties similar to, but slightly weaker than, the properties satisfied by a category of modules or vector bundles. From this he constructed an auxiliary category using a new device called his &quot;&quot;Q&quot;-construction.&quot; Like Segal&#x27;s Γ-objects, the &quot;Q&quot;-construction has its roots in Grothendieck&#x27;s definition of &quot;K&quot;0. Unlike Grothendieck&#x27;s definition, however, the &quot;Q&quot;-construction builds a category, not an abelian group, and unlike Segal&#x27;s Γ-objects, the &quot;Q&quot;-construction works directly with short exact sequences. If &quot;C&quot; is an abelian category, then &quot;QC&quot; is a category with the same objects as &quot;C&quot; but whose morphisms are defined in terms of short exact sequences in &quot;C&quot;. The &quot;K&quot;-groups of the exact category are the homotopy groups of Ω&quot;BQC&quot;, the loop space of the geometric realization (taking the loop space corrects the indexing). Quillen additionally proved his &quot; theorem&quot; that his two definitions of &quot;K&quot;-theory agreed with each other. This yielded the correct &quot;K&quot;0 and led to simpler proofs, but still did not yield any negative &quot;K&quot;-groups.

All abelian categories are exact categories, but not all exact categories are abelian. Because Quillen was able to work in this more general situation, he was able to use exact categories as tools in his proofs. This technique allowed him to prove many of the basic theorems of algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory. Additionally, it was possible to prove that the earlier definitions of Swan and Gersten were equivalent to Quillen&#x27;s under certain conditions.

&quot;K&quot;-theory now appeared to be a homology theory for rings and a cohomology theory for varieties. However, many of its basic theorems carried the hypothesis that the ring or variety in question was regular. One of the basic expected relations was a long exact sequence (called the &quot;localization sequence&quot;) relating the &quot;K&quot;-theory of a variety &quot;X&quot; and an open subset &quot;U&quot;. Quillen was unable to prove the existence of the localization sequence in full generality. He was, however, able to prove its existence for a related theory called &quot;G&quot;-theory (or sometimes &quot;K&quot;′-theory). &quot;G&quot;-theory had been defined early in the development of the subject by Grothendieck. Grothendieck defined &quot;G&quot;0(&quot;X&quot;) for a variety &quot;X&quot; to be the free abelian group on isomorphism classes of coherent sheaves on &quot;X&quot;, modulo relations coming from exact sequences of coherent sheaves. In the categorical framework adopted by later authors, the &quot;K&quot;-theory of a variety is the &quot;K&quot;-theory of its category of vector bundles, while its &quot;G&quot;-theory is the &quot;K&quot;-theory of its category of coherent sheaves. Not only could Quillen prove the existence of a localization exact sequence for &quot;G&quot;-theory, he could prove that for a regular ring or variety, &quot;K&quot;-theory equaled &quot;G&quot;-theory, and therefore &quot;K&quot;-theory of regular varieties had a localization exact sequence. Since this sequence was fundamental to many of the facts in the subject, regularity hypotheses pervaded early work on higher &quot;K&quot;-theory.

=== Applications of algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory in topology ===

The earliest application of algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory to topology was Whitehead&#x27;s construction of Whitehead torsion. A closely related construction was found by C. T. C. Wall in 1963. Wall found that a space &quot;X&quot; dominated by a finite complex has a generalized Euler characteristic taking values in a quotient of &quot;K&quot;0(Z&quot;π&quot;), where &quot;π&quot; is the fundamental group of the space. This invariant is called &quot;Wall&#x27;s finiteness obstruction&quot; because &quot;X&quot; is homotopy equivalent to a finite complex if and only if the invariant vanishes. Laurent Siebenmann in his thesis found an invariant similar to Wall&#x27;s that gives an obstruction to an open manifold being the interior of a compact manifold with boundary. If two manifolds with boundary &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; have isomorphic interiors (in TOP, PL, or DIFF as appropriate), then the isomorphism between them defines an &quot;h&quot;-cobordism between &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot;.

Whitehead torsion was eventually reinterpreted in a more directly &quot;K&quot;-theoretic way. This reinterpretation happened through the study of &quot;h&quot;-cobordisms. Two &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifolds &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are &quot;h&quot;-cobordant if there exists an -dimensional manifold with boundary &quot;W&quot; whose boundary is the disjoint union of &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; and for which the inclusions of &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; into &quot;W&quot; are homotopy equivalences (in the categories TOP, PL, or DIFF). Stephen Smale&#x27;s &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem asserted that if , &quot;W&quot; is compact, and &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, and &quot;W&quot; are simply connected, then &quot;W&quot; is isomorphic to the cylinder (in TOP, PL, or DIFF as appropriate). This theorem proved the Poincaré conjecture for .

If &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are not assumed to be simply connected, then an &quot;h&quot;-cobordism need not be a cylinder. The &quot;s&quot;-cobordism theorem, due independently to Mazur, Stallings, and Barden, explains the general situation: An &quot;h&quot;-cobordism is a cylinder if and only if the Whitehead torsion of the inclusion vanishes. This generalizes the &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem because the simple connectedness hypotheses imply that the relevant Whitehead group is trivial. In fact the &quot;s&quot;-cobordism theorem implies that there is a bijective correspondence between isomorphism classes of &quot;h&quot;-cobordisms and elements of the Whitehead group.

An obvious question associated with the existence of &quot;h&quot;-cobordisms is their uniqueness. The natural notion of equivalence is isotopy. Jean Cerf proved that for simply connected smooth manifolds &quot;M&quot; of dimension at least 5, isotopy of &quot;h&quot;-cobordisms is the same as a weaker notion called pseudo-isotopy. Hatcher and Wagoner studied the components of the space of pseudo-isotopies and related it to a quotient of &quot;K&quot;2(Z&quot;π&quot;).

The proper context for the &quot;s&quot;-cobordism theorem is the classifying space of &quot;h&quot;-cobordisms. If &quot;M&quot; is a CAT manifold, then &quot;H&quot;CAT(&quot;M&quot;) is a space that classifies bundles of &quot;h&quot;-cobordisms on &quot;M&quot;. The &quot;s&quot;-cobordism theorem can be reinterpreted as the statement that the set of connected components of this space is the Whitehead group of &quot;π&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;). This space contains strictly more information than the Whitehead group; for example, the connected component of the trivial cobordism describes the possible cylinders on &quot;M&quot; and in particular is the obstruction to the uniqueness of a homotopy between a manifold and . Consideration of these questions led Waldhausen to introduce his algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory of spaces. The algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory of &quot;M&quot; is a space &quot;A&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) which is defined so that it plays essentially the same role for higher &quot;K&quot;-groups as &quot;K&quot;1(Zπ1(&quot;M&quot;)) does for &quot;M&quot;. In particular, Waldhausen showed that there is a map from &quot;A&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) to a space Wh(&quot;M&quot;) which generalizes the map and whose homotopy fiber is a homology theory.

In order to fully develop &quot;A&quot;-theory, Waldhausen made significant technical advances in the foundations of &quot;K&quot;-theory. Waldhausen introduced Waldhausen categories, and for a Waldhausen category &quot;C&quot; he introduced a simplicial category &quot;S&quot;⋅&quot;C&quot; (the &quot;S&quot; is for Segal) defined in terms of chains of cofibrations in &quot;C&quot;. This freed the foundations of &quot;K&quot;-theory from the need to invoke analogs of exact sequences.

=== Algebraic topology and algebraic geometry in algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory ===

Quillen suggested to his student Kenneth Brown that it might be possible to create a theory of sheaves of spectra of which &quot;K&quot;-theory would provide an example. The sheaf of &quot;K&quot;-theory spectra would, to each open subset of a variety, associate the &quot;K&quot;-theory of that open subset. Brown developed such a theory for his thesis. Simultaneously, Gersten had the same idea. At a Seattle conference in autumn of 1972, they together discovered a spectral sequence converging from the sheaf cohomology of formula_3, the sheaf of &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;-groups on &quot;X&quot;, to the &quot;K&quot;-group of the total space. This is now called the Brown–Gersten spectral sequence.

Spencer Bloch, influenced by Gersten&#x27;s work on sheaves of &quot;K&quot;-groups, proved that on a regular surface, the cohomology group formula_4 is isomorphic to the Chow group &quot;CH&quot;2(&quot;X&quot;) of codimension 2 cycles on &quot;X&quot;. Inspired by this, Gersten conjectured that for a regular local ring &quot;R&quot; with fraction field &quot;F&quot;, &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) injects into &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) for all &quot;n&quot;. Soon Quillen proved that this is true when &quot;R&quot; contains a field, and using this he proved that
:formula_5
for all &quot;p&quot;. This is known as &quot;Bloch&#x27;s formula&quot;. While progress has been made on Gersten&#x27;s conjecture since then, the general case remains open.

Lichtenbaum conjectured that special values of the zeta function of a number field could be expressed in terms of the &quot;K&quot;-groups of the ring of integers of the field. These special values were known to be related to the étale cohomology of the ring of integers. Quillen therefore generalized Lichtenbaum&#x27;s conjecture, predicting the existence of a spectral sequence like the Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence in topological &quot;K&quot;-theory. Quillen&#x27;s proposed spectral sequence would start from the étale cohomology of a ring &quot;R&quot; and, in high enough degrees and after completing at a prime invertible in &quot;R&quot;, abut to the -adic completion of the &quot;K&quot;-theory of &quot;R&quot;. In the case studied by Lichtenbaum, the spectral sequence would degenerate, yielding Lichtenbaum&#x27;s conjecture.

The necessity of localizing at a prime suggested to Browder that there should be a variant of &quot;K&quot;-theory with finite coefficients. He introduced &quot;K&quot;-theory groups &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;; Z/Z) which were Z/Z-vector spaces, and he found an analog of the Bott element in topological &quot;K&quot;-theory. Soule used this theory to construct &quot;étale Chern classes&quot;, an analog of topological Chern classes which took elements of algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory to classes in étale cohomology. Unlike algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory, étale cohomology is highly computable, so étale Chern classes provided an effective tool for detecting the existence of elements in &quot;K&quot;-theory. William G. Dwyer and Eric Friedlander then invented an analog of &quot;K&quot;-theory for the étale topology called étale &quot;K&quot;-theory. For varieties defined over the complex numbers, étale &quot;K&quot;-theory is isomorphic to topological &quot;K&quot;-theory. Moreover, étale &quot;K&quot;-theory admitted a spectral sequence similar to the one conjectured by Quillen. Thomason proved around 1980 that after inverting the Bott element, algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory with finite coefficients became isomorphic to étale &quot;K&quot;-theory.

Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, &quot;K&quot;-theory on singular varieties still lacked adequate foundations. While it was believed that Quillen&#x27;s &quot;K&quot;-theory gave the correct groups, it was not known that these groups had all of the envisaged properties. For this, algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory had to be reformulated. This was done by Thomason in a lengthy monograph which he co-credited to his dead friend Thomas Trobaugh, who he said gave him a key idea in a dream. Thomason combined Waldhausen&#x27;s construction of &quot;K&quot;-theory with the foundations of intersection theory described in volume six of Grothendieck&#x27;s Séminaire de Géométrie Algébrique du Bois Marie. There, &quot;K&quot;0 was described in terms of complexes of sheaves on algebraic varieties. Thomason discovered that if one worked with in derived category of sheaves, there was a simple description of when a complex of sheaves could be extended from an open subset of a variety to the whole variety. By applying Waldhausen&#x27;s construction of &quot;K&quot;-theory to derived categories, Thomason was able to prove that algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory had all the expected properties of a cohomology theory.

In 1976, R. Keith Dennis discovered an entirely novel technique for computing &quot;K&quot;-theory based on Hochschild homology. This was based around the existence of the Dennis trace map, a homomorphism from &quot;K&quot;-theory to Hochschild homology. While the Dennis trace map seemed to be successful for calculations of &quot;K&quot;-theory with finite coefficients, it was less successful for rational calculations. Goodwillie, motivated by his &quot;calculus of functors&quot;, conjectured the existence of a theory intermediate to &quot;K&quot;-theory and Hochschild homology. He called this theory topological Hochschild homology because its ground ring should be the sphere spectrum (considered as a ring whose operations are defined only up to homotopy). In the mid-1980s, Bokstedt gave a definition of topological Hochschild homology that satisfied nearly all of Goodwillie&#x27;s conjectural properties, and this made possible further computations of &quot;K&quot;-groups. Bokstedt&#x27;s version of the Dennis trace map was a transformation of spectra . This transformation factored through the fixed points of a circle action on &quot;THH&quot;, which suggested a relationship with cyclic homology. In the course of proving an algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory analog of the Novikov conjecture, Bokstedt, Hsiang, and Madsen introduced topological cyclic homology, which bore the same relationship to topological Hochschild homology as cyclic homology did to Hochschild homology. 
The Dennis trace map to topological Hochschild homology factors through topological cyclic homology, providing an even more detailed tool for calculations. In 1996, Dundas, Goodwillie, and McCarthy proved that topological cyclic homology has in a precise sense the same local structure as algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory, so that if a calculation in &quot;K&quot;-theory or topological cyclic homology is possible, then many other &quot;nearby&quot; calculations follow.

== Lower &quot;K&quot;-groups ==
The lower &quot;K&quot;-groups were discovered first, and given various ad hoc descriptions, which remain useful. Throughout, let &quot;A&quot; be a ring.

=== &quot;K&quot;0 ===
The functor &quot;K&quot;0 takes a ring &quot;A&quot; to the Grothendieck group of the set of isomorphism classes of its finitely generated projective modules, regarded as a monoid under direct sum. Any ring homomorphism &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; gives a map &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;B&quot;) by mapping (the class of) a projective &quot;A&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; to &quot;M&quot; ⊗&quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot;, making &quot;K&quot;0 a covariant functor.

If the ring &quot;A&quot; is commutative, we can define a subgroup of &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;A&quot;) as the set

: formula_6

where :

:formula_7

is the map sending every (class of a) finitely generated projective &quot;A&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; to the rank of the free formula_8-module formula_9 (this module is indeed free, as any finitely generated projective module over a local ring is free). This subgroup formula_10 is known as the &quot;reduced zeroth K-theory&quot; of &quot;A&quot;.

If &quot;B&quot; is a ring without an identity element, we can extend the definition of K0 as follows. Let &quot;A&quot; = &quot;B&quot;⊕Z be the extension of &quot;B&quot; to a ring with unity obtaining by adjoining an identity element (0,1). There is a short exact sequence &quot;B&quot; → &quot;A&quot; → Z and we define K0(&quot;B&quot;) to be the kernel of the corresponding map &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;A&quot;) → K0(Z) = Z.

====Examples====
* (Projective) modules over a field &quot;k&quot; are vector spaces and &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;k&quot;) is isomorphic to Z, by dimension. 
* Finitely generated projective modules over a local ring &quot;A&quot; are free and so in this case once again &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;A&quot;) is isomorphic to Z, by rank.
* For &quot;A&quot; a Dedekind domain, &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;A&quot;) = Pic(&quot;A&quot;) ⊕ Z, where Pic(&quot;A&quot;) is the Picard group of &quot;A&quot;,

An algebro-geometric variant of this construction is applied to the category of algebraic varieties; it associates with a given algebraic variety &quot;X&quot; the Grothendieck&#x27;s &quot;K&quot;-group of the category of locally free sheaves (or coherent sheaves) on &quot;X&quot;. Given a compact topological space &quot;X&quot;, the topological &quot;K&quot;-theory &quot;K&quot;top(&quot;X&quot;) of (real) vector bundles over &quot;X&quot; coincides with &quot;K0&quot; of the ring of continuous real-valued functions on &quot;X&quot;.

====Relative &quot;K&quot;0====
Let &quot;I&quot; be an ideal of &quot;A&quot; and define the &quot;double&quot; to be a subring of the Cartesian product &quot;A&quot;×&quot;A&quot;:

:formula_11

The &quot;relative K-group&quot; is defined in terms of the &quot;double&quot;

:formula_12

where the map is induced by projection along the first factor.

The relative &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;I&quot;) is isomorphic to &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;I&quot;), regarding &quot;I&quot; as a ring without identity. The independence from &quot;A&quot; is an analogue of the Excision theorem in homology.

====&quot;K&quot;0 as a ring====
If &quot;A&quot; is a commutative ring, then the tensor product of projective modules is again projective, and so tensor product induces a multiplication turning K0 into a commutative ring with the class [&quot;A&quot;] as identity. The exterior product similarly induces a λ-ring structure.
The Picard group embeds as a subgroup of the group of units &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;A&quot;)∗.

=== &quot;K&quot;1 ===
Hyman Bass provided this definition, which generalizes the group of units of a ring: &quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) is the abelianization of the infinite general linear group:

:formula_13

Here

:formula_14

is the direct limit of the GL(&quot;n&quot;), which embeds in GL(&quot;n&quot; + 1) as the upper left block matrix, and formula_15 is its commutator subgroup. Define an &quot;elementary matrix&quot; to be one which is the sum of an identity matrix and a single off-diagonal element (this is a subset of the elementary matrices used in linear algebra). Then Whitehead&#x27;s lemma states that the group &quot;E&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) generated by elementary matrices equals the commutator subgroup [GL(&quot;A&quot;), GL(&quot;A&quot;)]. Indeed, the group GL(&quot;A&quot;)/E(&quot;A&quot;) was first defined and studied by Whitehead, and is called the Whitehead group of the ring &quot;A&quot;.

==== Relative &quot;K&quot;1 ====
The &quot;relative K-group&quot; is defined in terms of the &quot;double&quot;

:formula_16

There is a natural exact sequence

:formula_17

==== Commutative rings and fields ====
For &quot;A&quot; a commutative ring, one can define a determinant det: GL(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;A*&quot; to the group of units of &quot;A&quot;, which vanishes on E(&quot;A&quot;) and thus descends to a map det : &quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;A*&quot;. As E(&quot;A&quot;) ◅ SL(&quot;A&quot;), one can also define the special Whitehead group S&quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) := SL(&quot;A&quot;)/E(&quot;A&quot;). This map splits via the map &quot;A*&quot; → GL(1, &quot;A&quot;) → &quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) (unit in the upper left corner), and hence is onto, and has the special Whitehead group as kernel, yielding the split short exact sequence:

:formula_18

which is a quotient of the usual split short exact sequence defining the special linear group, namely

:formula_19

The determinant is split by including the group of units &quot;A*&quot; = GL1(&quot;A&quot;) into the general linear group GL&quot;(A)&quot;, so &quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) splits as the direct sum of the group of units and the special Whitehead group: &quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) ≅ &quot;A*&quot; ⊕ SK1 (&quot;A&quot;).

When &quot;A&quot; is a Euclidean domain (e.g. a field, or the integers) S&quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) vanishes, and the determinant map is an isomorphism from &quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) to &quot;A&quot;∗. This is &quot;false&quot; in general for PIDs, thus providing one of the rare mathematical features of Euclidean domains that do not generalize to all PIDs. An explicit PID such that SK1 is nonzero was given by Ischebeck in 1980 and by Grayson in 1981. If &quot;A&quot; is a Dedekind domain whose quotient field is an algebraic number field (a finite extension of the rationals) then shows that S&quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) vanishes.

The vanishing of SK1 can be interpreted as saying that K1 is generated by the image of GL1 in GL. When this fails, one can ask whether K1 is generated by the image of GL2. For a Dedekind domain, this is the case: indeed, K1 is generated by the images of GL1 and SL2 in GL. The subgroup of SK1 generated by SL2 may be studied by Mennicke symbols. For Dedekind domains with all quotients by maximal ideals finite, SK1 is a torsion group.

For a non-commutative ring, the determinant cannot in general be defined, but the map GL(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) is a generalisation of the determinant.

====Central simple algebras====
In the case of a central simple algebra &quot;A&quot; over a field &quot;F&quot;, the reduced norm provides a generalisation of the determinant giving a map &quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;∗ and S&quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) may be defined as the kernel. Wang&#x27;s theorem states that if &quot;A&quot; has prime degree then S&quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) is trivial, and this may be extended to square-free degree. Wang also showed that S&quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) is trivial for any central simple algebra over a number field, but Platonov has given examples of algebras of degree prime squared for which S&quot;K&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;) is non-trivial.

=== &quot;K&quot;2 ===
John Milnor found the right definition of &quot;K&quot;2: it is the center of the Steinberg group St(&quot;A&quot;) of &quot;A&quot;.

It can also be defined as the kernel of the map

:formula_20

or as the Schur multiplier of the group of elementary matrices.

For a field, K2 is determined by Steinberg symbols: this leads to Matsumoto&#x27;s theorem.

One can compute that K2 is zero for any finite field. The computation of K2(Q) is complicated: Tate proved

:formula_21

and remarked that the proof followed Gauss&#x27;s first proof of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity.

For non-Archimedean local fields, the group K2(&quot;F&quot;) is the direct sum of a finite cyclic group of order &quot;m&quot;, say, and a divisible group K2(&quot;F&quot;)&quot;m&quot;.

We have K2(Z) = Z/2, and in general K2 is finite for the ring of integers of a number field.

We further have K2(Z/&quot;n&quot;) = Z/2 if &quot;n&quot; is divisible by 4, and otherwise zero.

====Matsumoto&#x27;s theorem====
Matsumoto&#x27;s theorem states that for a field &quot;k&quot;, the second &quot;K&quot;-group is given by

:formula_22

Matsumoto&#x27;s original theorem is even more general: For any root system, it gives a presentation for the unstable K-theory. This presentation is different from the one given here only for symplectic root systems. For non-symplectic root systems, the unstable second K-group with respect to the root system is exactly the stable K-group for GL(&quot;A&quot;). Unstable second K-groups (in this context) are defined by taking the kernel of the universal central extension of the Chevalley group of universal type for a given root system. This construction yields the kernel of the Steinberg extension for the root systems &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; (&quot;n&quot; &gt; 1) and, in the limit, stable second &quot;K&quot;-groups.

====Long exact sequences====
If &quot;A&quot; is a Dedekind domain with field of fractions &quot;F&quot; then there is a long exact sequence

:formula_23

where p runs over all prime ideals of &quot;A&quot;.

There is also an extension of the exact sequence for relative K1 and K0:

:formula_24

====Pairing====
There is a pairing on K1 with values in K2. Given commuting matrices &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; over &quot;A&quot;, take elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in the Steinberg group with &quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot; as images. The commutator formula_25 is an element of K2. The map is not always surjective.

== Milnor &quot;K&quot;-theory ==
The above expression for &quot;K&quot;2 of a field &quot;k&quot; led Milnor to the following definition of &quot;higher&quot; &quot;K&quot;-groups by

:formula_26

thus as graded parts of a quotient of the tensor algebra of the multiplicative group &quot;k&quot;× by the two-sided ideal, generated by the

:formula_27

For &quot;n&quot; = 0,1,2 these coincide with those below, but for &quot;n&quot; ≧ 3 they differ in general. For example, we have &quot;K&#x27;(F&quot;&#x27;q) = 0&quot; for &quot;n&quot; ≧ 2
but &quot;KnFq&quot; is nonzero for odd &quot;n&quot; (see below).

The tensor product on the tensor algebra induces a product formula_28 making formula_29 a graded ring which is graded-commutative.

The images of elements formula_30 in formula_31 are termed &quot;symbols&quot;, denoted formula_32. For integer &quot;m&quot; invertible in &quot;k&quot; there is a map

:formula_33

where formula_34 denotes the group of &quot;m&quot;-th roots of unity in some separable extension of &quot;k&quot;. This extends to

:formula_35

satisfying the defining relations of the Milnor K-group. Hence formula_36 may be regarded as a map on formula_31, called the &quot;Galois symbol&quot; map.

The relation between étale (or Galois) cohomology of the field and Milnor K-theory modulo 2 is the Milnor conjecture, proven by Vladimir Voevodsky. The analogous statement for odd primes is the Bloch-Kato conjecture, proved by Voevodsky, Rost, and others.

== Higher &quot;K&quot;-theory ==
The accepted definitions of higher &quot;K&quot;-groups were given by , after a few years during which several incompatible definitions were suggested. The object of the program was to find definitions of K(&quot;R&quot;) and K(&quot;R&quot;,&quot;I&quot;) in terms of classifying spaces so that 
&quot;R&quot; ⇒ K(&quot;R&quot;) and (&quot;R&quot;,&quot;I&quot;) ⇒ K(&quot;R&quot;,&quot;I&quot;) are functors into a homotopy category of spaces and the long exact sequence for relative K-groups arises as the long exact homotopy sequence of a fibration K(&quot;R&quot;,&quot;I&quot;) → K(&quot;R&quot;) → K(&quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;).

Quillen gave two constructions, the &quot;plus-construction&quot; and the &quot;&quot;Q&quot;-construction&quot;, the latter subsequently modified in different ways. The two constructions yield the same K-groups.

=== The +-construction ===
One possible definition of higher algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory of rings was given by Quillen

:formula_38

Here π&quot;n&quot; is a homotopy group, GL(&quot;R&quot;) is the direct limit of the general linear groups over &quot;R&quot; for the size of the matrix tending to infinity, &quot;B&quot; is the classifying space construction of homotopy theory, and the + is Quillen&#x27;s plus construction. He originally found this idea while studying the group cohomology of formula_39 and noted some of his calculations were related to formula_40.

This definition only holds for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 so one often defines the higher algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory via

:formula_41

Since &quot;BGL&quot;(&quot;R&quot;)+ is path connected and &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;R&quot;) discrete, this definition doesn&#x27;t differ in higher degrees and also holds for &quot;n&quot; = 0.

=== The &quot;Q&quot;-construction ===
The &quot;Q&quot;-construction gives the same results as the +-construction, but it applies in more general situations. Moreover, the definition is more direct in the sense that the &quot;K&quot;-groups, defined via the &quot;Q&quot;-construction are functorial by definition. This fact is not automatic in the plus-construction.

Suppose formula_42 is an exact category; associated to formula_42 a new category formula_44 is defined, objects of which are those of formula_42 and morphisms from &quot;M&quot;′ to &quot;M&quot;″ are isomorphism classes of diagrams

:formula_46

where the first arrow is an admissible epimorphism and the second arrow is an admissible monomorphism. Note the morphisms in formula_44 are analogous to the definitions of morphisms in the category of motives, where morphisms are given as correspondences formula_48 such thatformula_49is a diagram where the arrow on the left is a covering map (hence surjective) and the arrow on the right is injective. This category can then be turned into a topological space using the classifying space construction formula_50 , which is defined to be the geometric realisation of the &quot;nerve&quot; of formula_44. Then, the i-th &quot;K&quot;-group of the exact category formula_42 is then defined as

:formula_53

with a fixed zero-object formula_54. Note the classifying space of a groupoid formula_55 moves the homotopy groups up one degree, hence the shift in degrees for formula_56 being formula_57 of a space.

This definition coincides with the above definition of &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;P&quot;). If &quot;P&quot; is the category of finitely generated projective &quot;R&quot;-modules, this definition agrees with the above &quot;BGL+&quot;
definition of &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) for all &quot;n&quot;.

More generally, for a scheme &quot;X&quot;, the higher &quot;K&quot;-groups of &quot;X&quot; are defined to be the &quot;K&quot;-groups of (the exact category of) locally free coherent sheaves on &quot;X&quot;.
The following variant of this is also used: instead of finitely generated projective (= locally free) modules, take finitely generated modules. The resulting &quot;K&quot;-groups are usually written &quot;G&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;). When &quot;R&quot; is a noetherian regular ring, then &quot;G&quot;- and &quot;K&quot;-theory coincide. Indeed, the global dimension of regular rings is finite, i.e. any finitely generated module has a finite projective resolution &quot;P&quot;* → &quot;M&quot;, and a simple argument shows that the canonical map &quot;K&quot;0(R) → &quot;G&quot;0(R) is an isomorphism, with [&quot;M&quot;]=Σ ± [&quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;]. This isomorphism extends to the higher &quot;K&quot;-groups, too.

=== The &quot;S&quot;-construction ===

A third construction of &quot;K&quot;-theory groups is the &quot;S&quot;-construction, due to Waldhausen. It applies to categories with cofibrations (also called Waldhausen categories). This is a more general concept than exact categories.

== Examples ==
While the Quillen algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory has provided deep insight into various aspects of algebraic geometry and topology, the &quot;K&quot;-groups have proved particularly difficult to compute except in a few isolated but interesting cases. (See also: K-groups of a field.)

=== Algebraic &quot;K&quot;-groups of finite fields ===
The first and one of the most important calculations of the higher algebraic &quot;K&quot;-groups of a ring were made by Quillen himself for the case of finite fields:

If F&quot;q&quot; is the finite field with &quot;q&quot; elements, then:

* &quot;K&quot;0(F&quot;q&quot;) = Z, 
* &quot;K&quot;2&quot;i&quot;(F&quot;q&quot;) = 0 for &quot;i&quot; ≥1, 
* &quot;K&quot;2&quot;i&quot;–1(F&quot;q&quot;) = Z/(&quot;q&quot; &quot;i&quot; − 1)Z for &quot;i&quot; ≥ 1.
 reproved Quillen&#x27;s computation using different methods.

=== Algebraic &quot;K&quot;-groups of rings of integers ===
Quillen proved that if &quot;A&quot; is the ring of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field &quot;F&quot; (a finite extension of the rationals), then the algebraic K-groups of &quot;A&quot; are finitely generated. Armand Borel used this to calculate &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) and K&quot;i&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) modulo torsion. For example, for the integers Z, Borel proved that (modulo torsion)

* &quot;K&quot;i (Z)/tors.=0 for positive &quot;i&quot; unless &quot;i=4k+1&quot; with &quot;k&quot; positive
* &quot;K&quot;4&quot;k&quot;+1 (Z)/tors.= Z for positive &quot;k&quot;.

The torsion subgroups of K2&quot;i&quot;+1(Z), and the orders of the finite groups K4&quot;k&quot;+2(Z) have recently been determined, but whether the latter groups are cyclic, and whether the groups &quot;K&quot;4&quot;k&quot;(Z) vanish depends upon Vandiver&#x27;s conjecture about the class groups of cyclotomic integers. See Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture for more details.

== Applications and open questions ==
Algebraic &quot;K&quot;-groups are used in conjectures on special values of L-functions and the formulation of a non-commutative main conjecture of Iwasawa theory and in construction of higher regulators.

Parshin&#x27;s conjecture concerns the higher algebraic &quot;K&quot;-groups for smooth varieties over finite fields, and states that in this case the groups vanish up to torsion.

Another fundamental conjecture due to Hyman Bass (Bass&#x27; conjecture) says that all of the groups &quot;Gn&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) are finitely generated when &quot;A&quot; is a finitely generated Z-algebra. (The groups
&quot;Gn&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) are the &quot;K&quot;-groups of the category of finitely generated &quot;A&quot;-modules)

<doc id="598511" wikidata="Q7362697" url="?curid=598511" title="Romanitas">
<text>Romanitas is the collection of political and cultural concepts and practices by which the Romans defined themselves. It is a Latin word, first coined in the third century AD, meaning &quot;Roman-ness&quot; and has been used by modern historians as shorthand to refer to Roman identity and self-image.

==Literal meaning and origin==
&quot;Romanitas&quot; means, as a rough approximation, &quot;Roman-ness&quot; in Latin, although it has also been translated as &quot;Romanism, the Roman way or manner&quot;. The term, not common in Roman sources, was first coined by the 3rd century Roman writer Tertullian, an early Christian from North Africa, in his work &quot;de Pallio&quot; (IV,1). Tertullian used the term pejoratively to refer to those in his native Carthage who aped Roman culture.

==Concepts behind literal meaning==
&quot;Romanitas&quot; is used to refer to the collection of political and cultural concepts and practices defining what it is to be a Roman. A notable part of Roman cultural identity was based on being part of a political and religious community with common values, customs, morality and way of life. That made historians seek to define &quot;romanitas&quot; using a number of approaches: one way is to consider the general ideals Romans attributed to themselves; another approach, which has achieved consensus among scholars, is to consider the construction of Roman identity during the process of colonisation. However, not all scholars accept that the notion of identity, which is inherited from social sciences, is adequate to understand what is to be Roman.

It was not a word often used in ancient times, but it is used by modern writers to express the ideals which inspired the Roman State. It meant a great many things, but in short it meant what it was to be Roman (that is, Roman-ness). The Roman ideal was the citizen/soldier/farmer. The farmer was a hard working, frugal, practical man who worked the land with his own hands. The soldier was a courageous, strong man who obeyed orders and risked his own life in the name of Rome. Prior to the formation, under Gaius Marius, of the standing Roman Army, Rome had a militia-type defence-force which could be called up in time of war and then disbanded during peacetime. The ideal of the homo militaris – embodying the functions of the citizen, soldier and farmer – was Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus. According to Roman legend, Cincinnatus was tending his farm when a messenger arrived, telling him that Rome was under attack and that he had been elected dictator. He was at first reluctant to go, but the Senate pleaded with him. He defeated the enemy tribe within a matter of weeks and, despite there remaining most of his six-month term as dictator with absolute power, returned to his farm.

The attainment and possession of the virtue of &quot;gravitas&quot; was highly valued by Romans of the early Republic and by Roman intellectuals. Indeed, &quot;gravitas&quot; was the single most clarifying characteristic of early republican Roman society. Polybius remarks:

The virtuous character of the Romans, their honesty and trustworthiness, is shown in the way they handled their finances. Polybius remarks: &quot;Greek statesmen, if entrusted with a single talent, though protected by ten checking-clerks, as many seals and twice as many witnesses, yet cannot be induced to keep faith; whereas among the Romans, in their magistracies and embassies, men have the handling of a great amount of money, and yet from pure respect for their oath keep their faith intact.&quot;

Their cultural characteristics led to their development of &quot;self government&quot; by adopting a classical republic and thus this class formed the backbone of the Roman Republic.

Because of the widespread influence of Roman classical literature, the idea of the homo militaris also took root in colonial and early United States.

<text>Ain&#x27;t Life Grand is the fourth studio album by the Athens, GA-based band Widespread Panic. It was released by Capricorn Records and Warner Bros. Records on September 6, 1994. It was re-released in 2001 by Zomba Music Group. On July 3, 2014, the band announced that &quot;Ain&#x27;t Life Grand&quot; would be reissued on vinyl in August 2014.

The band got minor airplay for their cover of Bloodkin&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Get High,&quot; as well as their own &quot;Airplane.&quot; They performed the song &#x27;&quot;Ain&#x27;t Life Grand&#x27;&quot; at Morehouse College for &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

The band began rehearsing for the album by recording pre-recording sessions at John Keane&#x27;s home studio like their first album, &quot;Space Wrangler&quot;. They were so pleased with the results that they decided to use the sessions for &quot;Ain&#x27;t Life Grand&quot; instead of going into the studio on a future date with their producer Johnny Sandlin.

The album peaked at No. 84 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;although the chorus comes straight from the Bon Jovi cliché book, &#x27;Heroes&#x27; musters a milder version of Pearl Jam’s taut emotional ambience.&quot;

<text>Hurricane Gilbert was the second most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin in terms of barometric pressure, only behind Hurricane Wilma in 2005. An extremely powerful tropical cyclone that formed during the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, Gilbert peaked as a Category 5 hurricane that brought widespread destruction to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, and is tied with 1969&#x27;s Hurricane Camille as the second-most intense tropical cyclone to make landfall in the Atlantic Ocean. Gilbert was also one of the largest tropical cyclones ever observed in the Atlantic basin. At one point, its tropical storm-force winds measured in diameter. In addition, Gilbert was the most intense tropical cyclone in recorded history to strike Mexico.

The seventh named storm, third hurricane and first major hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, Gilbert developed from a tropical wave on September 8 while located east of Barbados. Following intensification into a tropical storm the next day, Gilbert steadily strengthened as it tracked west-northwestward into the Caribbean Sea. On September 10, Gilbert attained hurricane intensity, and rapidly intensified into a Category 3 hurricane on September 11. After striking Jamaica the following day, rapid intensification occurred once again, and the storm became a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale with peak 1-minute sustained winds of , late on September 13. Gilbert then weakened slightly, and made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula later that day while maintaining Category 5 intensity. After landfall, Gilbert weakened rapidly over the Yucatán Peninsula, and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 storm on September 15. Gradual intensification occurred as Gilbert tracked across the Gulf of Mexico, and the storm made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane in mainland Mexico on September 16. The hurricane gradually weakened after landfall, and eventually dissipated on September 19 over the Midwestern United States. On the island of Cozumel, a pressure of 900 millibars was recorded when Hurricane Gilbert made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 165 mph.

Gilbert wrought havoc in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico for nearly nine days. In total, it killed 318 people and caused about $2.98 billion (1988 USD) in damages along its path. As a result of the extensive damage caused by Gilbert, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name in the spring of 1989; it was replaced with Gordon for the 1994 hurricane season.

==Meteorological history==

The origins of Hurricane Gilbert trace back to an easterly tropical wave—an elongated low-pressure area moving from east to west—that crossed the northwestern coast of Africa on September 3, 1988. Over the subsequent days, the wave traversed the tropical Atlantic and developed a broad wind circulation extending just north of the equator. The system remained disorganized until September 8, when satellite images showed a defined circulation center approaching the Windward Islands. The following day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified it as the twelfth tropical depression of the annual hurricane season using the Dvorak technique, when it was located about east of Barbados. The depression proceeded toward the west-northwest, and while moving through the Lesser Antilles near Martinique, it gained enough strength to be designated as Tropical Storm Gilbert.

After becoming a tropical storm, Gilbert underwent a period of significant strengthening. Passing to the south of Dominican Republic and Haiti, it became a hurricane late on September 10 and further strengthened to Category 3 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson scale the next day. At that time, Gilbert was classified as a major hurricane with sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . On September 12, the hurricane made landfall on the eastern coast of Jamaica at this intensity; its -wide eye moved from east to west across the entire length of the island.
Gilbert strengthened rapidly after emerging from the coast of Jamaica. As the hurricane brushed the Cayman Islands, a reporting station on Grand Cayman recorded a wind gust of as the storm passed just to the southeast on September 13. Explosive intensification continued until Gilbert reached a minimum pressure of with maximum sustained flight-level winds of , having intensified by 72 mbar in a space of 24 hours. This pressure was the lowest ever observed in the Western Hemisphere and made Gilbert the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record until it was surpassed by Hurricane Wilma in 2005.

Gilbert then weakened some, but remained a Category 5 hurricane as it made landfall for a second time on the island of Cozumel, and then a third time on Mexico&#x27;s Yucatán Peninsula on September 14. This made it the first Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane David hit Hispaniola in 1979. The minimum pressure at landfall in Cozumel was estimated to be , along with maximum sustained winds of . The storm weakened quickly while crossing land before it emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane. Gilbert re-strengthened rapidly, however, and made landfall for a final time as a Category 3 hurricane near La Pesca, Tamaulipas on September 16, with winds of about .

On September 17, Gilbert brushed the inland city of Monterrey, Nuevo León before taking a sharp turn to the north. The storm spawned 29 tornadoes in Texas on September 18, and then moved across Oklahoma. It was absorbed by a low-pressure system over Missouri on September 19, and finally became extratropical over Lake Michigan.

==Preparations==

Late on September 10, a tropical storm warning was issued by the National Hurricane Center for the southern coast of the Dominican Republic alongside a hurricane watch for the Barahona Peninsula. The hurricane watch for Barahona was upgraded to a hurricane warning early on September 11. Later that day, hurricane watches were posted for the Dominican Republic&#x27;s southern coast, Jamaica, and the southern coast of Cuba east of Cabo Cruz; the hurricane watch in Jamaica was upgraded to a hurricane warning by the end of the day. Hurricane warnings for the southern coast of Haiti were also posted on September 11. Cayman Airways evacuated residents from the Cayman Islands ahead of Gilbert.

On September 12, a hurricane watch was issued for the Cayman Islands, and the hurricane watch for the southern coast of Cuba was extended to Cienfuegos, with the portion of the watch east of Camagüey upgraded to a hurricane warning. That evening, the Yucatán Peninsula was placed under a hurricane watch between Felipe Carrillo Puerto and Progreso. This area included the resort cities of Cancún and Cozumel. The following day, hurricane watches were posted for Pinar del Río and Isla de la Juventud, and the Cayman Islands were placed under a hurricane warning. The watches in western Cuba and the Yucatán Peninsula were replaced with warnings at about mid-day September 13. As Gilbert approached the Yucatán Peninsula on September 14, the hurricane warning in the region was extended to cover the entire coast between Chetumal and Champotón, while a hurricane watch was posted for the northern district of Belize.

Once Gilbert entered the Gulf of Mexico on September 15, hurricane watches were posted for the portion of the shore between Port Arthur and Tampico. Around noon that day, the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning between Tampico and Port O&#x27;Connor.

Texas governor Bill Clements issued a decree allowing municipalities to lift laws in the name of public safety, including contraflow lane reversals and speed limits.

==Impact==

Gilbert claimed 318 lives, mostly in Mexico. Exact monetary damage figures are not available, but the total for all areas affected by Gilbert is estimated to be near $2.98 billion (1988 USD).

===Eastern Caribbean and Venezuela===
As a tropical storm, Gilbert brought high winds and heavy rains to many of the eastern Caribbean islands. In St. Lucia, heavy rains peaking at in Castries resulted in flash flooding and mudslides, though no major structural damage was reported. At Hewanorra International Airport, a dam ruptured and flooded one of the runways. Offshore, six fishermen went missing as Gilbert approached the Lesser Antilles. Banana crop losses from the storm in St. Lucia reached $740,000, with Guadeloupe, St. Vincent, and Dominica reporting similar damage. Several mudslides were reported in Dominica, though no damage resulted from them. Roughly of rain fell in Barbados, leading to flash floods and prompting officials to close schools and government offices. The U.S. Virgin Islands experienced widespread power outages and flooding, with many residents losing electricity for several days. Damage was less severe in the nearby British Virgin Islands, where only some flooding and power outages took place. In Puerto Rico, dozens of small communities lost power and agricultural losses reached $200,000.

In Venezuela, outflow bands from Gilbert produced torrential rain which triggered widespread flash floods and landslides in the northern part of the country, killing five people and leaving hundreds homeless. Damage from the storm was estimated at $3 million. In total, seven fatalities would occur in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela.

===Hispaniola===
Heavy rains from the outer bands of Hurricane Gilbert triggered significant flooding in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. At least nine people perished in the Dominican Republic as many rivers, including the Yuna, overtopped their banks. The main electrical relay station in Santo Domingo was damaged by the storm, causing a temporary blackout for much of the city. Losses in the country were estimated in the millions of dollars. In nearby Haiti, more substantial losses took place; 53 people died, including 10 offshore. Most of the casualties took place in the southern part of the country. The port of Jacmel was reportedly destroyed by waves stirred up by the hurricane. In light of extensive damage, the government of Haiti declared a state of emergency for the entire southern peninsula. Losses throughout Haiti were estimated at $91.2 million.

===Jamaica===

Hurricane Gilbert produced a storm surge and brought up to of rain in the mountainous areas of Jamaica, causing inland flash flooding. 49 people died. Prime Minister Edward Seaga stated that the hardest hit areas near where Gilbert made landfall looked &quot;like Hiroshima after the atom bomb.&quot; The storm left $700 million (1988 USD) in damage from destroyed crops, buildings, houses, roads, and small aircraft. Two people eventually had to be rescued because of mudslides triggered by Gilbert and were sent to the hospital. The two people were reported to be fine. No planes were going in and out of Kingston, and telephone lines were jammed from Jamaica to Florida.
As Gilbert lashed Kingston, its winds knocked down power lines, uprooted trees, and flattened fences. On the north coast, waves hit, forcing hotels to be evacuated in the popular tourist destination. Kingston&#x27;s airport reported severe damage to its aircraft, and all Jamaica-bound flights were cancelled at Miami International Airport. Unofficial estimates state that at least 30 people were killed around the island. Estimated property damage reached more than $200 million. More than 100,000 houses were destroyed or damaged and the country&#x27;s banana crop was largely destroyed. Hundreds of miles of roads and highways were also heavily damaged. Reconnaissance flights over remote parts of Jamaica reported that eighty percent of the homes on the island had lost their roofs. The poultry industry was also wiped out; the damage from agricultural loss reached $500 million (1988 USD). Hurricane Gilbert was the most destructive storm in the history of Jamaica and the most severe storm since Hurricane Charlie in 1951.

===Cayman Islands===
Gilbert passed to the south of the Cayman Islands early on September 13, with one reported gust of . However, the islands largely escaped the hurricane due to Gilbert&#x27;s quick forward motion. Damage was mitigated because the depth of the water surrounding the islands limited the height of the storm surge to There was very severe damage to crops, trees, pastures, and a number of private homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurricanecity/Cayman Islands&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At least 50 people were left homeless and losses were expected to be in the millions.

===Central America and Mexico===

Across parts of northern Central America, heavy rains from the outer bands of Hurricane Gilbert triggered deadly flash floods. Its rainfall and high winds reached Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. In Honduras, at least eight people were killed and 6,000 were left homeless. Additionally, approximately of crops were flooded. Sixteen people perished in Guatemala and another five died in Nicaragua, leaving a total of 21 people dead in Central America.
35,000 people were left homeless and 83 ships sank when Gilbert struck the Yucatán Peninsula. 60,000 homes were destroyed, and damage was estimated at between $1 and 2 billion (1989 US$).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mexican Hurricanes/Gilbert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the Cancún region, Gilbert produced waves high, washing away 60% of the city&#x27;s beaches; the storm surge from the storm penetrated up to inland. A further loss of $87 million (1989 USD) due to a decline in tourism was estimated for the months of October, November and December in 1988. Rainfall in the Yucatán Peninsula peaked at in Progreso.

As Gilbert lashed the third largest city of Mexico, Monterrey, it brought very high winds, torrential rains, and extensive flash floods. More than 60 people died from raging flood waters, and it was feared that more than 150 people died when five buses carrying evacuees were overturned in the raging floodwaters. Six policemen died when they were swept away while trying to rescue passengers on buses stranded by the Santa Catarina River. The residents of Monterrey had no power or drinking water, and most telephone lines were down. As the water receded, vehicles began appearing with their wheels up, jammed with mud and rocks. Quintana Roo Governor Miguel Borge reported that damages in Cancún were estimated at more than 1.3 billion Mexican pesos (1988 pesos; $500 million in USD). More than 5,000 American tourists were evacuated from Cancún. In Saltillo, five people died in road accidents caused by heavy rain, and almost 1,000 were left homeless. Rainfall in northeastern Mexico peaked at over in localized areas of inland Tamaulipas. In Coahuila, rainfall from Gilbert caused the deaths of 5 people who were swept away by rising waters. Among these were a paramedic and a pregnant woman who died when a Mexican Red Cross ambulance fell into a flooded arroyo near Los Chorros after a bridge collapsed. Gilbert dumped torrential rains and spawned some tornadoes. 

In Quintana Roo, Gilbert caused significant defoliation in the jungle. The debris eventually fueled a fire in 1989, which ultimately burned . Damage to the vegetation of Cozumel Island combined with human habitat alteration is blamed for the rapid decline and possible extinction of the endemic Cozumel Thrasher.

===United States===

Despite concerns that Texas might suffer a direct hit, there was only minor damage reported in southern Texas from Gilbert&#x27;s landfall to the south. Winds gusted to hurricane force in a few places, but the main impact felt in the state was from beach erosion caused by a 3-5-foot storm surge, and tornadoes, which mainly affected the San Antonio area. 29 tornadoes were spawned by Gilbert in Texas, at least two of which were killer tornadoes. Estimates ranged from 30 to more than 60 hitting 25 Texas counties. Nine of them hit San Antonio, where a 59-year-old woman was killed as she slept in her mobile home. 40 tornadoes were spawned in an area from Corpus Christi and Brownsville north to San Antonio and west to Del Rio. Gilbert also provided a good look at a particular unusual hurricane-spawned tornado in Del Rio, two hundred and fifty miles from the ocean. It was the first of this type of tornado to be captured on film since a tornado spun from Hurricane Agnes in 1972. Despite the massive appearance of the tornado, it did not produce a wide range damage path. Few hurricane-spawned tornadoes do. In the state, a major disaster was declared on October 5, 1988.

Oklahoma recorded the highest rainfall in the United States at , in Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge. Isolated locations in Texas and Oklahoma reported over , while moderate rainfall of up to fell in central Michigan. Overall damage in the United States was estimated at $80 million (1988 USD).

==Aftermath==
The overall property damage was estimated at $2.98 billion (1988 USD). Earlier estimates put property damage from Gilbert at $2.5 billion but were as high as $10 billion. A final count of Hurricane Gilbert&#x27;s victims is not possible because many people remained missing in Mexico, but the total confirmed death toll was 433 people.

===Records===
On September 13, Hurricane Gilbert attained a record low central pressure of 888 mb (hPa; 26.22 inHg), surpassing the previous minimum of set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. This made it the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the north Atlantic basin at the time. It was surpassed by Hurricane Wilma in 2005, which attained a central pressure of . Gilbert is the most intense tropical cyclone on record to strike Jamaica. The storm also produced record-breaking rainfall in Jamaica, amounting to . This ranked it (at that time) as the fourth-wettest known storm to strike Jamaica.

===Retirement===

Due to the extensive damage and loss of life from the hurricane, the name &quot;Gilbert&quot; was retired by the World Meteorological Organization following the 1988 season, and will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced by &quot;Gordon&quot; for the 1994 season.

===Popular culture===
In Jamaica, dance hall DJ Lovindeer released a single called &quot;Wild Gilbert&quot; a few days after the storm. It was the fastest selling reggae record in the history of Jamaican music. In 1989, the PBS series &quot;Nova&quot; released the episode &quot;Hurricane!&quot; that featured Gilbert (later modified in 1992 to reflect Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane Iniki).

<doc id="598524" wikidata="Q169310" url="?curid=598524" title="Ariel (Israeli settlement)">
<text>Ariel (; ) is an Israeli settlement organized as a city council in the central West Bank, part of the Israeli-occupied territories, approximately east of the Green Line and west of the Jordan border. Ariel was first established in 1978 and its population was in , composed of veteran and young Israelis, English-speaking immigrants, and immigrants from the former Soviet Union, with an additional influx of above 10,000 students from Ariel University. It is the fourth largest Israeli settlement in the West Bank, after Modi&#x27;in Illit, Beitar Illit, and Ma&#x27;ale Adumim.

The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.

Ariel&#x27;s jurisdiction spans , and borders the Palestinian towns and villages Salfit, Marda and Iskaka. According to B&#x27;Tselem, within Ariel&#x27;s municipal area there are several enclaves of privately owned Palestinian land, whose owners are not allowed access to them.

==Etymology==
Ariel (pronounced Ari&#x27;el), literally means &#x27;Lion of God&#x27;. &quot;Ari&quot; (Lion) in Hebrew is also a synonym for bravery and courage and it is also the symbol of the tribe of Judah. The city of Ariel is named after Jerusalem. Ariel in the Hebrew Bible is one of the names for Jerusalem and the Temple of Jerusalem (Isaiah 29:1–8).

==History==
Ariel was founded in 1978 on land that was seized for military needs and on land that was declared state land, including cultivated farmland of Palestinian villages in the district and on rocky land the villagers used for grazing their flocks. At the beginning of 1978, a group of Israelis formed in order to create a settlement in the hills of the northern part of the West Bank made a formal request to the government to be given land to build a new community and were given three options by the army; the area near the &#x27;lone tree&#x27; which would later become Barkan, the area which would later become Kfar Tapuach, and a hill near Kifl Hares that was known to the local Arabs as &#x27;Jabel Mawat&#x27;, the hill of death, because of inhospitable terrain. The leader of this group, Ron Nachman, chose the latter because of its strategic location on a possible Jordanian invasion route towards Israel&#x27;s main population centre of Tel Aviv. In the spring of 1978, some of the group&#x27;s men erected tents on the chosen hilltop, and in August 1978, a total of forty families came to live in the settlement.

The original members of the group had gone through a screening process in order to put together a mix of skilled adults as well as young families that would be prepared psychologically to withstand starting a new settlement from scratch with little infrastructure and modern comforts. There were no paved roads or paths. Water was supplied periodically by a tanker truck. Electricity was provided by a generator since no electrical network existed in that area. Tents were replaced by prefabricated concrete blocks which served as living quarters, schools, and an infirmary. On September 1, 1978, the school year was officially opened.

From 1978 to 1988, Ariel continued to develop, and established itself as the urban center for the nearby Israeli settlements. In 1980, the prefabricated homes were replaced with permanent housing. The College of Judea and Samaria, which would later become the Ariel University Center of Samaria, and eventually Ariel University, was founded in 1982. Three elementary schools, a community center, a sports hall, and a synagogue were built. In May 1982, Ariel was connected to the national power grid.

During the mass immigration of Jews from Soviet Union that began in 1989 and continued throughout the 1990s, Ariel, which had a population of 8,000 in 1990, experienced a population boom. Unlike in Israel proper, apartments in Ariel were plentiful and cheap, which proved attractive to the immigrants. Some 6,000 Soviet immigrants moved to Ariel, almost doubling its population.

In 2005, the residents of Netzarim, a former Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip which had been evacuated, found temporary housing in the dormitories of the Ariel University Center of Samaria. At the beginning of the academic year, about one-third chose to settle permanently in Ariel, while the rest moved to Yevul. In 2007, the city began receiving immigrants from English-speaking countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and South Africa in significant numbers.

Nachman, a central figure in the Likud party, presided over Ariel from 1978 until his death in January 2013, at first as head of the local council and as mayor from 1985, when the settlement was officially recognized as a city. Both religious and secular Jews reside in Ariel. The city has sixteen synagogues.

On 15 November 2022, three Israelis were murdered during a terror attack near Ariel.

==Geography==

Ariel is situated between and east of the Green Line, and west of the Jordan River, Jordan&#x27;s western border. Ariel is adjacent to the Palestinian Authority town of Salfit and southwest of Nablus. It is approximately east of Petah Tikva, and east of Tel Aviv to which it is connected by the Highway 5 and northwest of Jerusalem, to which it is connected by Highway 60.

Ariel&#x27;s jurisdiction spans , and borders the Palestinian towns and villages Salfit, Marda and Iskaka. Ariel&#x27;s municipal area contains several enclaves of privately owned Palestinian land, whose owners are not allowed access to them. The central water pumping station in Salfit has been polluted several times by overflow from the wastewater in Ariel.

==Economy==
The city has several shopping centres and two industrial zones (divided into light and heavy industry), a library. In July 2008, Israel approved the construction of 27 new factories, which were expected to be completed by September 2009.

== Israeli-Palestinian conflict ==
=== Status under international law ===
Like all Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, Ariel is considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. A series of Israeli governments has insisted that Ariel be included within Israel&#x27;s future borders under any future peace treaty. The Israeli Ministry of the Interior gave the municipality of Ariel the status of a city council in 1998. In January 2010, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accompanied by leading figures in his governing coalition, declared Ariel the &quot;capital of Samaria&quot;, and &quot;an integral part of Israel&quot;. In December 2010, thirty-five MKs petitioned the government to annex Ariel to Israel. Palestinian representatives have opposed the incorporation of Ariel into Israel in any future settlement, arguing that the Ariel &#x27;finger&#x27; would interrupt the territorial integrity of a Palestinian state and includes a major aquifer. Ariel&#x27;s future is thus not clear: &quot;as well as an obstacle to an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, it could also serve as a crucial trade-off for negotiators hammering out a final deal.&quot; McDonald&#x27;s Israel, the local subsidiary of the international fast food chain, turned down an offer to open a restaurant in Ariel in June 2013, citing its declared policy not to open any branches in West Bank settlements across the Green Line.

=== West Bank barrier ===
The Israeli West Bank barrier was originally planned to extend out from the Israeli border to Ariel. Under American political pressure, the &quot;finger&quot;, as the extension of the fence to include Ariel is often called, was not built. Instead, Ariel has a security fence surrounding it on only three sides.

=== First Intifada ===
In mid-1989, during the First Intifada, the settlement came under controversy after the mayor ordered all Palestinians working in the settlement to wear visible badges identifying them as &quot;foreign workers.&quot; The order was criticised across the political spectrum in Israel, including Likud MK Ehud Olmert who called it &quot;insensitive and unwise&quot; and Ratz MK Yossi Sarid who said he was &quot;disgusted,&quot; with some commentators comparing the order to the yellow badges imposed by Nazi Germany on Jews. The settlement&#x27;s mayor criticised the comparisons to Nazi Germany, saying that &quot;only a warped mind, ignorance and stupidity&quot; could compare the situation to &quot;the security needs of every settlement in Judea, Samaria and Israel.&quot; However, the settlement subsequently reversed the order.

==Education and culture==
Ariel is home to the Ariel University, founded in 1982 as the College of Judea and Samaria. In 2010, the university had a student population of 11,500, both Israeli and Palestinian. In 2007, it changed its name to Ariel University Center of Samaria, a change that was officially recognized in 2010. In 2012, it received accreditation as a research university. 

The state-funded Ariel Center for the Performing Arts opened on November 8, 2010, with a performance of Piaf by the Beersheba Theater company. These performances were boycotted by sixty Israeli actors, writers, and directors, including Joshua Sobol, who refuse to perform in settlements. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Culture Minister Limor Livnat and the leader of the Kadima Party Tzipi Livni condemned the boycott and proposed cutting government funding those participating in it. The boycott was supported by Amos Oz, David Grossman and A. B. Yehoshua, It was opposed by Amnon Shamosh, who suggested that the boycott plays into the hands of right-wing extremists by linking art and politics. 150 U.S. actors supported the boycott. However, five Israeli actors later withdrew from the boycott, indicating that they changed their mind or thought the letter they were signing called for a discussion on the issue rather than outright boycott.

<doc id="598526" wikidata="Q518087" url="?curid=598526" title="Psittacula">
<text>Psittacula, also known as Afro-Asian ring-necked parrots, is a genus of parrots from Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a widespread group with a clear concentration of species in south Asia, but also with representatives in Africa and the islands of the Indian Ocean. This is the only genus of parrot which has the majority of its species in continental Asia. Of all the extant species only &quot;Psittacula calthropae&quot;, &quot;Psittacula caniceps&quot; and &quot;Psittacula echo&quot; do not have a representative subspecies in any part of mainland continental Asia. The rose-ringed parakeet, &quot;Psittacula krameri&quot;, is one of the most widely distributed of all parrots.

The other two Asian genera, &quot;Loriculus&quot; and &quot;Psittinus&quot; are represented by only two species each, which occur in the mainland part of Asia. The majority of the &quot;Loriculus&quot; species occur on islands. Moreover, since &quot;Loriculus&quot; is spread across both sides of the Wallace Line it can be considered more Australasian than Asian. These parrots mostly have green plumage, with adults having coloured heads. The bill is stout, and the tail is long and graduated.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Psittacula&quot; is a diminutive of the Latin word psittacus meaning &quot;parrot&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Psittacula&quot; was introduced in 1800 by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier. The type species was designated in 1923 by Gregory Mathews as the red-breasted parakeet. The name of the genus is a diminutive of the Latin word &quot;psittacus&quot; for a &quot;parrot&quot;.

The genus includes 16 species, of which three are extinct.

*†Newton&#x27;s parakeet, &quot;Psittacula exsul&quot; - extinct (c.1875)
*Echo parakeet, &quot;Psittacula eques&quot;
**†Réunion parrot, &quot;Psittacula eques eques&quot; - extinct mid-18th century
*†Mascarene grey parakeet, &quot;Psittacula bensoni&quot; - extinct (c.1764) (formerly classified in genus †&quot;Lophopsittacus&quot;, and still considered such by some authorities)
*Rose-ringed parakeet, &quot;Psittacula krameri&quot;
*Alexandrine parakeet, &quot;Psittacula eupatria&quot;
*†Seychelles parakeet, &quot;Psittacula wardi&quot; - extinct (1883)
*Plum-headed parakeet, &quot;Psittacula cyanocephala&quot;
*Blossom-headed parakeet, &quot;Psittacula roseata&quot;
*Slaty-headed parakeet, &quot;Psittacula himalayana&quot;
*Grey-headed parakeet, &quot;Psittacula finschii&quot;
*Blue-winged parakeet, &quot;Psittacula columboides&quot;
*Layard&#x27;s parakeet, &quot;Psittacula calthrapae&quot;
*Lord Derby&#x27;s parakeet, &quot;Psittacula derbiana&quot;
*Red-breasted parakeet, &quot;Psittacula alexandri&quot; (also called moustached parrot)
*Long-tailed parakeet, &quot;Psittacula longicauda&quot;
*Nicobar parakeet, &quot;Psittacula caniceps&quot;

=== Alternative taxonomy ===
Genetic evidence has found that the genus &quot;Psittacula&quot; is likely paraphyletic; for example, genetic analysis has supported merging short-tailed parrots of the genus &quot;Tanygnathus,&quot; &quot;Psittinus,&quot; and the extinct &quot;Mascarinus&quot; with &quot;Psittacula.&quot; A revised classification was proposed by Michael Braun and coworkers in 2019 that splits the genus &quot;Psittacula&quot; into multiple monophyletic genera in order to preserve &quot;Tanygnathus, Psittinus,&quot; and &quot;Mascarinus&quot; as distinct genera. After the proposed split, the only remaining species in &quot;Psittacula sensu stricto&quot; are &quot;P. derbiana&quot;, &quot;P. caniceps&quot;, and &quot;P. alexandri&quot;. This is also the taxonomic system followed by the IUCN Red List and BirdLife International. The list of split or monophyletic genera and species (and any of their allied species) is displayed below:

*Genus Himalayapsitta
**Plum-headed parakeet, &quot;Himalayapsitta cyanocephala&quot;
**Grey-headed parakeet, &quot;Himalayapsitta finschii&quot;
**Slaty-headed parakeet, &quot;Himalayapsitta himalayana&quot;
**Blossom-headed parakeet, &quot;Himalayapsitta roseata&quot;
*Genus Nicopsitta
**Blue-winged parakeet, &quot;Nicopsitta columboides&quot;
**Layard&#x27;s parakeet, &quot;Nicopsitta calthrapae&quot;
*Genus Belocercus
**Long-tailed parakeet, &quot;Belocercus longicauda&quot;
*Genus Psittacula
**Red-breasted parakeet, &quot;Psittacula alexandri&quot;
**Lord Derby&#x27;s parakeet, &quot;Psittacula derbiana&quot;
**Nicobar parakeet, &quot;Psittacula caniceps&quot;
*Genus Palaeornis
**Alexandrine parakeet, &quot;Palaeornis eupatria&quot;
**†Seychelles parakeet, &quot;Palaeornis wardi&quot; 
*Genus Alexandrinus
**Rose-ringed parakeet, &quot;Alexandrinus krameri&quot;
**†Newton&#x27;s parakeet, &quot;Alexandrinus exsul&quot; 
**Echo parakeet, &quot;Alexandrinus (eques) echo&quot;
*Genus Tanygnathus 
**Great-billed parrot, &quot;Tanygnathus megalorynchos&quot;
**Blue-naped parrot, &quot;Tanygnathus lucionensis&quot;
**Blue-backed parrot, &quot;Tanygnathus sumatranus&quot;
**Black-lored parrot, &quot;Tanygnathus gramineus&quot;
*Genus Psittinus
**Blue-rumped parrot, &quot;Psittinus cyanurus&quot;
**Simeulue parrot, &quot;Psittinus abbotti&quot; 
*Genus †Mascarinus
**†Mascarene parrot, &quot;Mascarinus mascarin&quot;
*Genus †Lophopsittacus
**†Mauritius grey parrot, &quot;Lophopsittacus bensoni&quot;

The extinct Mascarene grey parrot (&quot;P. bensoni&quot;) was not sampled in the study and has not been reclassified to &quot;Psittacula sensu lato&quot; by the IUCN or BirdLife, so it is still classified in &quot;Lophopsittacus&quot; under this taxonomy and with the common name Mauritius grey parrot. The Nicobar parrot(&quot;P. caniceps&quot;) was also not sampled but kept in &quot;Psittacula&quot; by the authorities that incorporated this taxonomy.

The study has also found that the rose-ringed and red-breasted parrots are likely paraphyletic species themselves, and thus need to be split into multiple species.

=== Hypothetical extinct species ===
The Rothschild&#x27;s or intermediate parakeet &quot;P. intermedia&quot;, found in northern India, was formerly considered a mystery, as only very few specimens were known. It has since been demonstrated to be a hybrid between the slaty-headed parrot &quot;P. himalayana&quot; and the plum-headed parrot &quot;P. cyanocephala&quot;.

The taxonomy of the Réunion parakeet &quot;P. eques&quot; is also confusing. Extinct since 1770, little evidence even exists of the bird&#x27;s existence. A study skin had been discovered at the Royal Museum of Scotland, explicitly referencing a book description of the Réunion birds. It is known from other descriptions, as well as illustrations of which it is unknown whether they were drawn from live or stuffed specimens. This may be the only material proof of these birds&#x27; existence. Taxonomists are unsure if the birds were a distinct species, or conspecific with the echo parakeet, although genetic analysis supports it being a subspecies of the echo parakeet.

His book, &quot;A History of the Birds of New Zealand&quot;, first published in 1873, was published as an enlarged version in 1888 and became a New Zealand classic.

==Biography==
Buller was born at Newark, the Wesleyan mission at Pakanae in the Hokianga, the son of Rev. James Buller, a Cornish missionary who had helped convert the people of Tonga to Methodism. He was educated at Wesley College in Auckland. In 1854, he moved to Wellington with his parents, where he was befriended by the naturalist William Swainson. In 1859 he was made Native Commissioner for the Southern Provinces. In 1871 he travelled to England and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple. Three years later he returned to Wellington and practised law.

In 1862, he married Charlotte Mair at Whangārei. They were to have four children.

Buller was the author of &quot;A History of the Birds of New Zealand&quot; (1872–1873, 2nd ed. 1887–1888), with illustrations by John Gerrard Keulemans and Henrik Grönvold. In 1882 he produced the &quot;Manual of the Birds of New Zealand&quot; as a cheaper popular alternative. In 1905, he published a two-volume &quot;Supplement to the History of the Birds of New Zealand&quot;, which brought the work up to date.

Buller was appointed Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George in 1875. In November 1886, he was promoted to Knight Commander. Buller helped establish the scientific display in the New Zealand Court at the World&#x27;s Fair in Paris and was decorated with the Officer of the Legion of Honour by the President of France in November 1889.

He had several unsuccessful attempts at entering Parliament as a Liberal. He contested the general elections of 1876 (; beaten by the incumbent Walter Johnston) and (, where he came fourth of six candidates), and the in the electorate (where he was beaten by William Fraser, the official Liberal Party candidate).

He emigrated to England and died at Fleet in Hampshire on 19 July 1906.

Wellington playwright Nick Blake authored a play on Buller&#x27;s life, &quot;Dr Buller&#x27;s Birds&quot;, which had its debut at the 2006 NZ International Arts Festival.

<text>An Einstein ring, also known as an Einstein–Chwolson ring or Chwolson ring (named for Orest Chwolson), is created when light from a galaxy or star passes by a massive object en route to the Earth. Due to gravitational lensing, the light is diverted, making it seem to come from different places. If source, lens, and observer are all in perfect alignment (&quot;syzygy&quot;), the light appears as a ring.

== Introduction ==
Gravitational lensing is predicted by Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity. Instead of light from a source traveling in a straight line (in three dimensions), it is bent by the presence of a massive body, which distorts spacetime. An Einstein Ring is a special case of gravitational lensing, caused by the exact alignment of the source, lens, and observer. This results in symmetry around the lens, causing a ring-like structure.
The size of an Einstein ring is given by the Einstein radius. In radians, it is

:formula_1

where

: formula_2 is the gravitational constant,
: formula_3 is the mass of the lens,
: formula_4 is the speed of light,
: formula_5 is the angular diameter distance to the lens,
: formula_6 is the angular diameter distance to the source, and
: formula_7 is the angular diameter distance between the lens and the source.

Over cosmological distances formula_8 in general.

== History ==

The bending of light by a gravitational body was predicted by Albert Einstein in 1912, a few years before the publication of general relativity in 1916 (Renn et al. 1997). The ring effect was first mentioned in the academic literature by Orest Khvolson in a short article in 1924, in which he mentioned the “halo effect” of gravitation when the source, lens, and observer are in near-perfect alignment. Einstein remarked upon this effect in 1936 in a paper prompted by a letter by a Czech engineer, R W Mandl, but stated
(In this statement, β is the Einstein Angle currently denoted by formula_9 as in the expression above.) However, Einstein was only considering the chance of observing Einstein rings produced by stars, which is low – the chance of observing those produced by larger lenses such as galaxies or black holes is higher since the angular size of an Einstein ring increases with the mass of the lens.

The first complete Einstein ring, designated B1938+666, was discovered by collaboration between astronomers at the University of Manchester and NASA&#x27;s Hubble Space Telescope in 1998.

There have apparently not been any observations of a star forming an Einstein ring with another star, but there is a 45% chance of this happening in early May, 2028 when Alpha Centauri A passes between us and a distant red star.

=== Known Einstein rings ===

Hundreds of gravitational lenses are currently known. About half a dozen of them are partial Einstein rings with diameters up to an arcsecond, although as either the mass distribution of the lenses is not perfectly axially symmetrical, or the source, lens, and observer are not perfectly aligned, we have yet to see a perfect Einstein ring. Most rings have been discovered in the radio range. The degree of completeness needed for an image seen through a gravitational lens to qualify as an Einstein ring is yet to be defined.

The first Einstein ring was discovered by Hewitt et al. (1988), who observed the radio source MG1131+0456 using the Very Large Array. This observation saw a quasar lensed by a nearer galaxy into two separate but very similar images of the same object, the images stretched round the lens into an almost complete ring. These dual images are another possible effect of the source, lens, and observer not being perfectly aligned.

The first complete Einstein ring to be discovered was B1938+666, which was found by King et al. (1998) via optical follow-up with the Hubble Space Telescope of a gravitational lens imaged with MERLIN. The galaxy causing the lens at B1938+666 is an ancient elliptical galaxy, and the image we see through the lens is a dark dwarf satellite galaxy, which we would otherwise not be able to see with current technology.

In 2005, the combined power of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with the Hubble Space Telescope was used in the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey to find 19 new gravitational lenses, 8 of which showed Einstein rings, these are the 8 shown in the adjacent image. As of 2009, this survey has found 85 confirmed gravitational lenses but there is not yet a number for how many show Einstein rings. This survey is responsible for most of the recent discoveries of Einstein rings in the optical range, following are some examples which were found:

*FOR J0332-3557, discovered by Remi Cabanac et al. in 2005, notable for its high redshift which allows us to use it to make observations about the early universe.
*The &quot;Cosmic Horseshoe&quot; is a partial Einstein ring which was observed through the gravitational lens of LRG 3-757, a distinctively large Luminous Red Galaxy. It was discovered in 2007 by V. Belokurov et al.
*SDSSJ0946+1006, the &quot;double Einstein ring&quot; was discovered by Raphael Gavazzi and Tomasso Treu in 2008, notable for the presence of multiple rings observed through the same gravitational lens, the significance of which is explained in the next section on extra rings.
Another example is the radio/X-Ray Einstein ring around PKS 1830-211, which is unusually strong in radio. It was discovered in X-Ray by Varsha Gupta et al. at the Chandra X-Ray observatory It is also notable for being the first case of a quasar being lensed by an almost face-on spiral galaxy.

Galaxy MG1654+1346 features a radio ring. The image in the ring is that of a quasar radio lobe, discovered in 1989 by G.Langston et al.

In June 2023, a team of astronomers led by Justin Spilker announced their discovery of an Einstein ring of distant galaxy rich in organic molecules (aromatic hydrocarbons).

In September 2023, a scientist named Bruno Altieri saw a hint of an Einstein ring in the data coming back from the Euclid space telescope. The ring is located in a galaxy, NGC 6505, that is not to far from Earth–about 600-million light years away.

In February 2025, the Euclid space telescope captured a nearly perfect Einstein ring around galaxy NGC 6505, about 590 million light-years away. This gravitational lensing effect bent light from a background galaxy 4.42 billion light-years away.

== Extra rings ==

Using the Hubble Space Telescope, a double ring has been found by Raphael Gavazzi of the STScI and Tommaso Treu of the University of California, Santa Barbara. This arises from the light from three galaxies at distances of 3, 6, and 11 billion light years. Such rings help in understanding the distribution of dark matter, dark energy, the nature of distant galaxies, and the curvature of the universe. The odds of finding such a double ring around a massive galaxy are 1 in 10,000. Sampling 50 suitable double rings would provide astronomers with a more accurate measurement of the dark matter content of the universe and the equation of state of the dark energy to within 10 percent precision.

=== Simulation ===
Below in the Gallery section is a simulation depicting a zoom on a Schwarzschild black hole in the plane of the Milky Way between us and the centre of the galaxy. The first Einstein ring is the most distorted region of the picture and shows the galactic disc. The zoom then reveals a series of 4 extra rings, increasingly thinner and closer to the black hole shadow. They are multiple images of the galactic disk. The first and third correspond to points which are behind the black hole (from the observer&#x27;s position) and correspond here to the bright yellow region of the galactic disc (close to the galactic center), whereas the second and fourth correspond to images of objects which are behind the observer, which appear bluer, since the corresponding part of the galactic disc is thinner and hence dimmer here.

<text>In cryptography, a product cipher combines two or more transformations in a manner intending that the resulting cipher is more secure than the individual components to make it resistant to cryptanalysis. The product cipher combines a sequence of simple transformations such as substitution (S-box), permutation (P-box), and modular arithmetic. The concept of product ciphers is due to Claude Shannon, who presented the idea in his foundational paper, &quot;Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems&quot;. A particular product cipher design where all the constituting transformation functions have the same structure is called an iterative cipher with the term &quot;rounds&quot; applied to the functions themselves.

For transformation involving reasonable number of n message symbols, both of the foregoing cipher systems (the S-box and P-box) are by themselves wanting. Shannon suggested using a combination of S-box and P-box transformation—a product cipher. The combination could yield a cipher system more powerful than either one alone. This approach of alternatively applying substitution and permutation transformation has been used by IBM in the Lucifer cipher system, and has become the standard for national data encryption standards such as the Data Encryption Standard and the Advanced Encryption Standard. A product cipher that uses only substitutions and permutations is called a SP-network. Feistel ciphers are an important class of product ciphers.

<text>Husky Stadium (officially Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium for sponsorship purposes) is an outdoor football stadium in the Northwestern United States, located on the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington. Originally named University of Washington Stadium, it was renamed Husky Stadium following the 1970 football season. It has been home to the Washington Huskies of the Big Ten Conference since 1920, hosting their football games. It also briefly hosted the Seattle Seahawks of the NFL in 2000 and 2001 while Qwest Field (now Lumen Field) was being constructed.

Aside from football, the university holds its annual commencement at the stadium each June. It sits at the southeast corner of campus, between Montlake Boulevard Northeast and Union Bay, just north of the Montlake Cut. The stadium is served by the University of Washington Link light rail station, which provides rail service to downtown, Rainier Valley and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. It is also accessible by several bus routes.

The stadium underwent a $280 million renovation that was completed in 2013. Its U-shaped design was specifically oriented (18.167° south of due east) to minimize glare from the early afternoon sun in the athletes&#x27; eyes. The stadium&#x27;s open end overlooks Lake Washington and the Cascade Mountains, including Mount Rainier. Prior to the 2013 renovation, its total capacity of 72,500 made it the largest stadium in the Pacific Northwest and one of the largest college football stadiums.

==History==

The original stadium was built in 1920 by Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company with a seating capacity of 30,000. It replaced Denny Field, located at the north end of campus, south of NE 45th St. and 20th Ave NE. Husky Stadium&#x27;s first game was the concluding game of the 1920 season, a 28–7 loss to Dartmouth on November 27. On July 27, 1923, the stadium was the site of President Warren G. Harding&#x27;s final public address; he died in San Francisco six days later.

The capacity of the lower bowl was expanded with the addition of 10,000 seats around the rim in 1936. In 1943, 35,000 people watched a demonstration of a mock WWII bombing raid, showing how local forces would respond in an attack. The Seattle fire department and emergency response teams rescued mock victims and buildings constructed on the field that were exploded as P-38 planes flew overhead to demonstrate how citizens should react. The first of the stadium&#x27;s iconic covered grandstands was constructed in 1950, adding 15,000 seats to the south side. Several thousand additional seats were added in 1968. 

In 1987, 13,000 seats were added with the construction of the north grandstand. Similar to the south stand, this structure included a cantilevered steel roof covering a portion of the lower seats. The project made headlines on February 25, 1987, when the grandstand collapsed during construction as a result of miscommunication between the workers and the contractor, which led to the premature removal during the intended replacement of several support cables. Although there were no casualties, property damage ranged from $500,000 to $1 million and resulted in setbacks; however, the stadium addition was completed in time for the start of the 1987 Husky football season.

Husky Stadium was a primary venue for the 1990 Goodwill Games, where the crowd saw an address by former President Ronald Reagan, as well as an address by Arnold Schwarzenegger, and a performance by the Moody Blues &amp; Gorky Park. The stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the track &amp; field competition.

Husky Stadium was the temporary home of the Seattle Seahawks for five games (two preseason and three regular season) in 1994 while the Kingdome was temporarily closed for repairs to its damaged roof. After the demolition of the Kingdome in March 2000, the Seahawks played at Husky Stadium for the 2000 and 2001 seasons before moving into Seahawks Stadium (now Lumen Field) in 2002.

The playing field at Husky Stadium was originally dirt, which was then replaced with natural grass in 1938. In 1968, Washington became one of the first major college teams to play on AstroTurf at home; at the time, the Houston Astrodome, Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wisconsin, were the only other major facilities with artificial turf. The AstroTurf field was replaced in 1972, 1977, 1987, and 1995. FieldTurf, a new variation of synthetic turf, was installed in 2000 at a cost of $1,074,958. The new turf features enhanced drainage and reduced abrasion through the use of synthetic fibers that are tufted into an infill of sand and rubber. The project was funded by Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen, who used Husky Stadium as a temporary home venue during the construction of CenturyLink Field. The first of its kind in the NFL, the surface was so popular with the players that the Seahawks, who had planned to use natural grass at their new stadium, instead installed their own FieldTurf surface. The FieldTurf at Husky Stadium was replaced with a newer one after nine seasons in 2009 at a cost of $350,000.

In addition to the new playing surface, the Seahawks made other improvements to Husky stadium in preparation for its tenure as an NFL venue for two seasons. A larger scoreboard debuted in 1998, with a &quot;HuskyTron&quot; video screen. Improved lighting for television, including corner lights, was added in 1999, and official NFL goalposts (optic yellow, in height) were installed in 2000.

The Husky Stadium end zones were painted gold during the 1980s and early 1990s; the new AstroTurf in 1995 changed them to purple. They became natural green with the installation of FieldTurf in 2000, which lasted until 2009 when they reverted to gold for one season. Purple end zones returned prior to the 2010 season, and were temporarily painted black for the Huskies&#x27; first &quot;blackout&quot; game against UCLA on November 18.

On September 3, 2015, Alaska Airlines purchased naming rights to the field, which changed its official name to &quot;Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium.&quot; The agreement, worth $41 million over 10 years, became the largest of its kind in college athletics.

The Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) will hold the Washington state championship games for high school football, called the Gridiron Classic, at Husky Stadium on a trial basis in December 2023. Announced by the WIAA in June, it will mark the return of the annual games to Seattle, which last hosted them at the Kingdome in 1994; the university granted significantly discounted venue fees for the WIAA, with the latter hoping for a long-term agreement if the games are successfully held. The games were previously rotated among three Pierce County high school venues after the WIAA elected to move them out of the Tacoma Dome in 2019 amid rising costs and impaired sight lines from the latter&#x27;s 2018 renovations.

===The Wave===
Many claim that the first audience wave originated in Husky Stadium on Halloween 1981, at the prompting of Husky band trumpeter Dave Hunter, although it is documented to have begun at the Oakland Coliseum two weeks earlier during an MLB playoff game. Contrary to Hunter&#x27;s account, former Washington yell leader Robb Weller has also claimed credit for the first wave. Weller was the guest yell-king during the Huskies&#x27; homecoming football game against Stanford. His initial concept for the wave was for it to travel vertically, from the bottom of the stands to the top, within the Husky student section. When the stunt was met with limited interest, he then decided to reverse the movement of the wave to travel from top to bottom. This failed miserably, as it was necessary to turn backward to see the wave progressing downward. Weller then gave up and returned his attention to the game. However, a fan named Omar Parker sitting on the open (east) end of the stadium at the student side started yelling &quot;sideways&quot;. Weller did not hear him, but then many students tried to initiate a &quot;sideways&quot; wave on their own. After a few attempts, and more yelling of &quot;sideways&quot; by students, Weller took notice. He instructed the crowd to stand as he ran past. He moved along the track toward the open end of the stadium, explaining to the student crowd what he would do, then ran along the track toward the closed end of the stadium, in front of the student section. The stunt caught on after a couple of tries and continued around the entire stadium, and was then repeated throughout the rest of the game and the season. Longtime UW band director Bill Bissell also claimed co-creator credit with Weller, suggesting that the wave was devised by both of them prior to the game. The following week Bill Scott (known as &quot;Bill the Beer Man&quot;) started the wave in Husky Stadium and also at the Seattle Seahawks game in the Kingdome.

===Loudness===

Husky Stadium has long been recognized as one of the loudest stadiums in the nation. This is in part due to the stadium&#x27;s design; almost 70% of the seats are located between the end zones, covered by cantilevered metal roofs that trap the sound.

On occasion, the high decibel levels at Husky games along with fans stomping their feet in the bleachers cause television cameras to shake. During the night game against #12 Nebraska on September 19, 1992, ESPN measured the noise level at over 130 decibels, well above the threshold of pain. The maximum recorded level of 133.6 decibels, according to ESPN, is the highest ever recorded at a college football stadium.

===Tailgating===
The north and south parking lots are packed with cars for tailgating. Husky Stadium is unusual in that fans can travel to football games by boat, known locally as &quot;sailgating&quot; (other stadiums with this feature include Neyland Stadium at Tennessee, Heinz Field at Pittsburgh, and McLane Stadium at Baylor). There can be upwards of 12,000 people out on Lake Washington next to Husky Stadium during game days. Before kickoff, the Washington crew team offers shuttles to anyone that wants to go to and from the boats and docks for the game.

Fans also gather at the Dempsey Indoor Facility just north of the stadium for Husky Huddles. After the game, the Tyee Sports Council and the University of Washington Athletic Department put on events where fans can gather and hear analysis of the game from Washington coaches and Husky Legends, and listen to the Husky Marching Band.

===2011–2013 renovation===

Husky Stadium had developed numerous structural problems over the years as a result of standing for nine decades in Seattle&#x27;s moist weather, particularly in the lower bowl. In November 2011, Husky Stadium began a $261 million renovation, the largest single capital project in the university&#x27;s history. Home games were played at CenturyLink Field during the 2012 season while construction took place. The Apple Cup in 2011 was moved to CenturyLink (Qwest Field through 2011) to advance the start of the project by several weeks.

The new Husky Stadium was developed by Wright Runstad &amp; Company, designed by 360 Architecture, and constructed by Turner Construction company. The steel decking was supplied by Profile Steel. The new stadium is the first and primary income source of a completely remodeled athletic district which includes a new $19 million Husky Ballpark, a new track and field stadium, renovated soccer stadium, $50 million basketball operations and practice facility and recently completed projects such as the Husky Legends Center, the Conibear Shellhouse and Alaska Airlines Arena renovations, and the construction of the Dempsey Indoor facility. This major remodel of the athletic village coincided with construction for an underground station for a northern extension of the Link light rail system and a replacement of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge.

The renovation project incorporated a new grand concourse, press box, video and audio system, and football offices, as well as new and improved amenities, concession stands, and bathrooms. The track that had enclosed the playing field was removed, and the field itself lowered by four feet to make room for additional seating closer to the sidelines. The student section was relocated from the north sideline to the west end zone, and the temporary bleachers in the east end zone were replaced with a permanent structure featuring field-level suites. The addition of box suites reduced the seating capacity from 72,500 to 70,138. Despite the reduction in capacity, the renovated stadium is expected to be as loud as its predecessor. Additionally, new parking garages were constructed and facilities throughout the athletic village were renovated.

==NFL exhibition games==

Before the arrival of the Seattle Seahawks in 1976, Husky Stadium hosted 12 NFL preseason games between 1955 and 1975. The San Francisco 49ers played six times at the stadium, the most of any team. Other teams to make multiple appearances include the New York Giants, Los Angeles Rams, Cleveland Browns, and Chicago/St. Louis Cardinals.

At one point after the 1970 NFL season, Ralph Wilson came close to moving the Buffalo Bills from dilapidated War Memorial Stadium to Husky Stadium. The threat of relocation prompted the developers in the Buffalo suburbs to construct Rich Stadium in Orchard Park (later Ralph Wilson Stadium and now Highmark Stadium), which opened in 1973. The Bills have resided there ever since.

==Other sports==

Husky Stadium was among several local venues considered as a potential temporary home for a Major League Soccer team in the mid-1990s. The University of Washington offered to let a prospective team, including the Seattle Sounders, use the stadium for two years if a plan to build a permanent soccer stadium was in place. Husky Stadium was also considered as a potential 1994 FIFA World Cup venue, but lacked a suitable grass surface; it was also a candidate venue in the unsuccessful U.S. bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup alongside Qwest Field.

<text>Jordan Mechner (born June 4, 1964) is an American video game designer, author, screenwriter, filmmaker, and former video game programmer. A major figure in the development of cinematic video games and a pioneer in video game animation, he began his career designing and programming the bestselling 1984 martial arts game &quot;Karateka&quot; for the Apple II while a student at Yale University. He followed it with the platform game &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; five years later; it was widely ported and became a hit. Both games used rotoscoping, where actors shot on film by Mechner were drawn over to create in-game animation. &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; has become the basis for a long-running franchise, including a 2010 live-action film released by Walt Disney Pictures and an ongoing series of video games published by Ubisoft.

Mechner is the recipient of many accolades, including the 2017 GDC Pioneer Award. His works are often included in all-time lists of the game industry&#x27;s best and most influential titles.

In 1993, Mechner founded Smoking Car Productions to design and direct the adventure game &quot;The Last Express&quot;. While commercially unprofitable at the time of its release, the game has garnered a cult following and is recognized as an innovative work in interactive narrative.

As an author, Mechner has written graphic novels in collaboration with different illustrators, including the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller &quot;Templar&quot; (2013), &quot;Monte Cristo&quot; (2022), and &quot;Liberty&quot; (2023). In 2023, Mechner made his debut as a graphic novel writer–artist, with the autobiographical &quot;Replay: Memoir of an Uprooted Family&quot;. &quot;Replay&quot; was awarded the 2023 Chateau de Cheverny prize for historical graphic novels.

In 2009, he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.

==Early life==
Mechner was born in New York City in 1964, into a family of European Jewish immigrants. His father is psychologist Francis Mechner, and his mother was a programmer. He attended Yale University in the 1980s.

==Career==
While at Yale, Mechner wrote several Apple II games that he submitted for publication, but which were rejected. &quot;Asteroid Blaster&quot;, an &quot;Asteroids&quot; clone, was submitted to Hayden Software and abstract action game &quot;Deathbounce&quot; to Broderbund. Mechner then spent two years at Yale writing his first published game, &quot;Karateka&quot; (1984), which went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; software chart. &quot;Karateka&quot; is a horizontally scrolling game where meeting an enemy results in a prolonged fight. The game cuts between gameplay and what is happening out of the player&#x27;s view, showing actions of the imprisoned princess and her captor. The animation was done by drawing on top of frames of Mechner&#x27;s karate instructor recorded on film.

His second game, &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, was released in 1989 after more than three years of work. He wrote both games in the 6502 assembly language for the Apple II, though that system was in decline through the late 1980s, and little new software was released by 1989. Initially, &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; sold poorly, but as it was ported to other systems, sales increased. Eventually, it was adapted for about thirty computer and console platforms.

Following the completion of &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, Mechner attended film school, traveled to Cuba to produce and direct a short documentary film, and lived in Paris for a year. During this period, he designed and directed the sequel, &quot;Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame&quot;, released in 1993.

He founded the independent developer Smoking Car Productions in 1993, where he led the production of the CD-ROM adventure game &quot;The Last Express&quot;. Smoking Car grew to sixty people, a huge team for the mid-1990s, and the game took longer to finish than anticipated. When finally released in 1997, it was positively reviewed but did not recoup its budget. &quot;The Last Express&quot; was re-released in 2012 by French publisher DotEmu for mobile and other platforms.

In 2017, he won the Honorific Award at the Fun &amp; Serious Game Festival.

===&quot;Prince of Persia&quot; revival===
In 2001, Mechner worked with Ubisoft to reboot &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;. Developed at Ubisoft Montreal with Mechner as game designer, writer, and creative consultant, &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot; was released in 2003. It received twelve nominations and eight awards at the Interactive Achievement Awards. Ubisoft has since published four more &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; sequels and several spinoffs, including the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise, which was initially conceived as a sequel to &quot;Sands of Time&quot;. In 2024, Ubisoft released &quot;Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&quot;, a new relaunch of the franchise, developed at its Montpellier studio.

A film adaptation, &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot;, was released on May 28, 2010. Mechner wrote the first drafts of the screenplay and also has an executive producer credit.

===Writing and directing===
In 2003, Mechner wrote and directed the documentary film &quot;Chavez Ravine: A Los Angeles Story&quot;. It won the 2003 IDA award for Best Short Documentary, was for an Academy Award nomination, and received its broadcast premiere on PBS Independent Lens in 2005.

Mechner collaborated with a team on the 2008 &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; graphic novel. The author&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Templar&quot; was published in July 2013. &quot;Templar&quot; became a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling book and was nominated for an Eisner Award. Mechner also wrote the graphic novel &quot;Prince of Persia: Before the Sandstorm&quot;, to tie in with the release of the film in 2010.

He has published two volumes of his game development journals from the 1980s, one describing the making of &quot;Karateka&quot; and the other focusing on &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;.

Mechner has written a screenplay for a film adaptation of Michael Turner&#x27;s &quot;Fathom&quot; for Fox Studios.

In 2017, Mechner moved to Montpellier, France. He has collaborated with European illustrators on graphic novels, including &quot;Monte Cristo&quot; (2023) and &quot;Liberty&quot; (2022). In 2023, he released an autobiographical graphic novel, &quot;Replay: Memoires d&#x27;une famille&quot;. He continues to write new graphic novels.

<doc id="598570" wikidata="Q286020" url="?curid=598570" title="Sinoatrial node">
<text>The sinoatrial node (also known as the sinuatrial node, SA node or sinus node) is an oval shaped region of special cardiac muscle in the upper back wall of the right atrium made up of cells known as pacemaker cells. The sinus node is approximately 15 mm long, 3 mm wide, and 1 mm thick, located directly below and to the side of the superior vena cava.

These cells produce an electrical impulse known as a cardiac action potential that travels through the electrical conduction system of the heart, causing it to contract. In a healthy heart, the SA node continuously produces action potentials, setting the rhythm of the heart (sinus rhythm), and so is known as the heart&#x27;s natural pacemaker. The rate of action potentials produced (and therefore the heart rate) is influenced by the nerves that supply it.

==Structure==
The sinoatrial node is an oval-shaped structure that is approximately 15 mm long, 3 mm wide, and 1 mm thick, located directly below and to the side of the superior vena cava. The size can vary but is usually between 10-30 mm long, 5–7 mm wide, and 1–2 mm deep.

===Location===
The SA node is located in the wall (epicardium) of the right atrium, laterally to the entrance of the superior vena cava in a region called the sinus venarum (hence &quot;&quot; + &quot;)&quot;. It is positioned roughly between a groove called the crista terminalis located on the internal surface of the heart and the corresponding sulcus terminalis, on the external surface. These grooves run between the entrance of the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava.

===Microanatomy===

The cells of the SA node are spread out within a mesh of connective tissue, containing nerves, blood vessels, collagen and fat. Immediately surrounding the SA node cells are paranodal cells. These cells have structures intermediate between that of the SA node cells and the rest of the atrium. The connective tissue, along with the paranodal cells, insulate the SA node from the rest of the atrium, preventing the electrical activity of the atrial cells from affecting the SA node cells. The SA node cells are smaller and paler than the surrounding atrial cells, with the average cell being around 8 micrometers in diameter and 20-30 micrometers in length (1 micrometer= 0.000001 meter). Unlike the atrial cells, SA node cells contain fewer mitochondria and myofibers, as well as a smaller sarcoplasmic reticulum. This means that the SA node cells are less equipped to contract compared to the atrial and ventricular cells.

Action potentials pass from one cardiac cell to the next through pores known as gap junctions. These gap junctions are made of proteins called connexins. There are fewer gap junctions within the SA node and they are smaller in size. This is again important in insulating the SA node from the surrounding atrial cells.

===Blood supply===
The sinoatrial node receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery. This blood supply, however, can differ hugely between individuals. For example, in most humans, this is a single artery, although in some cases there have been either 2 or 3 sinoatrial node arteries supplying the SA node. Also, the SA node artery mainly originates as a branch of the right coronary artery; however in some individuals it has arisen from the circumflex artery, which is a branch of the left coronary artery. Finally, the SA node artery commonly passes behind the superior vena cava, before reaching the SA node; however in some instances it passes in front. Despite these many differences, there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any advantage to how many sinoatrial nodal arteries an individual has, or where they originate.

===Venous drainage===
There are no large veins that drain blood away from the SA node. Instead, smaller venules drain the blood directly into the right atrium.

==Function==
===Pacemaking===

The main role of a sinoatrial node cell is to initiate action potentials of the heart that can pass through cardiac muscle cells and cause contraction. An action potential is a rapid change in membrane potential, produced by the movement of charged atoms (ions). In the absence of stimulation, non-pacemaker cells (including the ventricular and atrial cells) have a relatively constant membrane potential; this is known as a resting potential. This resting phase (see cardiac action potential, phase 4) ends when an action potential reaches the cell. This produces a positive change in membrane potential, known as depolarization, which is propagated throughout the heart and initiates muscle contraction. Pacemaker cells, however, do not have a resting potential. Instead, immediately after repolarization, the membrane potential of these cells begins to depolarise again automatically, a phenomenon known as the pacemaker potential. Once the pacemaker potential reaches a set value, the threshold potential, it produces an action potential. Other cells within the heart (including the Purkinje fibers and atrioventricular node) can also initiate action potentials; however, they do so at a slower rate and therefore, if the SA node is functioning properly, its action potentials usually override those that would be produced by other tissues.

Outlined below are the 3 phases of a sinoatrial node action potential. In the cardiac action potential, there are 5 phases (labelled 0-4), however pacemaker action potentials do not have an obvious phase 1 or 2.

Phase 4

This phase is also known as the pacemaker potential. Immediately following repolarization, when the membrane potential is very negative (it is hyperpolarised), the voltage slowly begins to increase. This is initially due to the closing of potassium channels, which reduces the flow of potassium ions (Ik) out of the cell (see phase 2, below). Hyperpolarization also causes activation of hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channels. The activation of ion channels at very negative membrane potentials is unusual, therefore the flow of sodium (Na+) and some K+ through the activated HCN channel is referred to as a &quot;funny current&quot; (If). This funny current causes the membrane potential of the cell to gradually increase, as the positive charge (Na+ and K+) is flowing into the cell. Another mechanism involved in pacemaker potential is known as the calcium clock. This refers to the spontaneous release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (a calcium store) into the cytoplasm, also known as calcium sparks. This increase in calcium within the cell then activates a sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX), which removes one Ca2+ from the cell, and exchanges it for 3 Na+ into the cell (therefore removing a charge of +2 from the cell, but allowing a charge of +3 to enter the cell) further increasing the membrane potential. Calcium later reenters the cell via SERCA and calcium channels located on the cell membrane. The increase in membrane potential produced by these mechanisms, activates T-type calcium channels and then L-type calcium channels (which open very slowly). These channels allow a flow of Ca2+ into the cell, making the membrane potential even more positive.

Phase 0

This is the depolarization phase. When the membrane potential reaches the threshold potential (around -20 to -50 mV), the cell begins to rapidly depolarise (become more positive). This is mainly due to the flow of Ca2+ through L-type calcium channels, which are now fully open. During this stage, T-type calcium channels and HCN channels deactivate.

Phase 3

This phase is the repolarization phase. This occurs due to the inactivation of L-type calcium channels (preventing the movement of Ca2+ into the cell) and the activation of potassium channels, which allows the flow of K+ out of the cell, making the membrane potential more negative.

==Nerve supply==
Heart rate depends on the rate at which the sinoatrial node produces action potentials. At rest, heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. This is a result of the activity of two sets of nerves, one acting to slow down action potential production (these are parasympathetic nerves) and the other acting to speed up action potential production (sympathetic nerves).

Modulation of heart rate by ANS is carried by two types of channel: Kir and HCN (members of the CNG gated channels).

The sympathetic nerves begin in the thoracic region of the spinal cord (in particular T1-T4). These nerves release a neurotransmitter called noradrenaline (NA). This binds to a receptor on the SA node membrane, called a beta-1adrenoceptor. Binding of NA to this receptor activates a G-protein (in particular a Gs-Protein, S for stimulatory) which initiates a series of reactions (known as the cAMP pathway) that results in the production of a molecule called cyclic adenosinemonophosphate (cAMP). This cAMP binds to the HCN channel (see above). Binding of cAMP to the HCN increases the flow of Na+ and K+ into the cell, speeding up the pacemaker potential, so producing action potentials at a quicker rate and increasing heart rate. An increase in heart rate is known as positive chronotropy.

The parasympathetic nerves supplying the SA node (in particular the Vagus nerves) originate in the brain. These nerves release a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (ACh). ACh binds to a receptor called an M2 muscarinic receptor, located on the SA node membrane. Activation of this M2 receptor then activates a protein called a G-protein (in particular Gi protein, i for inhibitory). Activation of this G-protein blocks the cAMP pathway, reducing its effects, therefore inhibiting sympathetic activity and slowing action potential production. The G-protein also activates a potassium channel GIRK-1 and GIRK-4, which allows K+ to flow out of the cell, making the membrane potential more negative and slowing the pacemaker potential, therefore decreasing the rate of action potential production and therefore decreasing heart rate. A decrease in heart rate is known as negative chronotropy.

The first cell to produce the action potential in the SA node isn&#x27;t always the same; this is known as pacemaker shift. In certain species of animals—for example, in dogs—a superior shift (i.e., the cell that produces the fastest action potential in the SA node is higher than previously) usually produces an increased heart rate whereas an inferior shift (i.e. the cell producing the fastest action potential within the SA node is further down than previously) produces a decreased heart rate.

==Clinical significance==
Sinus node dysfunction also known as &quot;sick sinus syndrome&quot; is a group of irregular heartbeat conditions caused by faulty electrical signals of the heart. When the heart&#x27;s sinoatrial node is defective, the heart&#x27;s rhythms become abnormal—typically too slow or exhibiting pauses in its function or a combination, and very rarely faster than normal.

Blockage of the arterial blood supply to the SA node (most commonly due to a myocardial infarction or progressive coronary artery disease) can therefore cause ischemia and cell death in the SA node. This can disrupt the electrical pacemaker function of the SA node, and can result in sinus node dysfunction.

If the SA node does not function or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker.

==History==
The sinoatrial node was first discovered by a young medical student, Martin Flack, in the heart of a mole, whilst his mentor, Sir Arthur Keith, was on a bicycle ride with his wife. They made the discovery in a makeshift laboratory set up in a farmhouse in Kent, England, called Mann&#x27;s Place. Their discovery was published in 1907.

<doc id="598571" wikidata="Q1355631" url="?curid=598571" title="Lefty Gomez">
<text>Vernon Louis &quot;Lefty&quot; Gomez (November 26, 1908 – February 17, 1989) was an American professional baseball player. A left-handed pitcher, Gomez played in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1930 and 1943 for the New York Yankees and the Washington Senators. Gomez was a five-time World Series champion with the Yankees. He was also known for his colorful personality and humor.

Gomez grew up in California and played for the San Francisco Seals after high school. He made his MLB debut with the Yankees in April 1930. He was selected as an All-Star every year between 1933 and 1939. He sustained an arm injury in 1940. Though he rebounded well in 1941, he pitched his last full season in 1942, then appeared in one game in 1943 before retiring with the Washington Senators.

In 1933, Gomez married June O&#x27;Dea, who had a brief career as a Broadway actress. After his retirement, he became a popular public speaker. Gomez was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1972. He made an appearance at Yankee Stadium in 1987, when he and Whitey Ford were honored with plaques at the stadium&#x27;s Monument Park. He died in California in 1989.

==Early life==
Gomez was born in Rodeo, California. His father, Francisco Gomez, had been born in California to a Spanish father, Juan Gomez, and a Portuguese mother, Rita. His mother, Lizzie Herring, was an American of Welsh-Irish descent. He was the youngest out of eight children in his family. His father grew up as a cowboy and was known as “Coyote” most of his life. He managed a 1,000-acre ranch in Franklin Canyon where Lefty and his brothers would ride horses and became hired hands when they were children. They would wake up as early as 4:00 am to milk the cows and clean out the stalls before they headed to school for the day. When he was 6 years old he attended the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco and watched the famous pilot Lincoln Beachy crash into the bay while trying to complete a stunt. He was very outgoing and liked to try many different hobbies out. When he was 8 years old, he attended a 4 July parade where he found a new passion to play the saxophone. His brother Earl was a big help in this passion and purchased Lefty his first saxophone on his ninth birthday. Lefty took a job plucking chickens at the local butcher shop to earn money for lessons.

Gomez started playing sandlot baseball for the Rodeo town team when he was only 13 years of age. He excelled right off the bat at the age of 14 and pitched throughout central California. He caught the eyes of a scout for the San Francisco Seals, who told Lefty to reach back out when he put on some weight as he was but only . He then got a summer job at a union oil scraping sludge from the stills at the refinery. He attended Richmond high school because his local school did not have a baseball team. In his senior year of high school, he was offered a scholarship to play baseball at St. Mary&#x27;s College, a smaller school that was just east of Oakland. However, his father told him to give up baseball and focus on schoolwork to become an engineer like his older brother Milfred.

==Career==
Although his father was not a fan of continuing baseball, he went ahead and signed the contract for Lefty to play for the Seals at the 1928 spring training camp. He was not off to a hot start, but picked up quickly and was sent to the Utah–Idaho League for the season.

The New York Yankees purchased Gomez from the Seals for an estimated $39,000. He reported in at and weighing in at . This scared many people that he was not ready for the big leagues. Gomez made his major league debut on April 29, 1930. He pitched in only 15 games and finished the season with a 2–5 win–loss record, a 5.55 earned run average (ERA). Coming into the 1931 season, Gomez had good pitching velocity, but the Yankees were concerned about the pitcher&#x27;s slender frame of and . Following a common medical strategy of the time, the team had most of his teeth extracted; they also had him drink of milk daily and gave him an unlimited meal allowance for road games. Gomez registered the second-best ERA in the American League in 1931.
A 20-game winner four times and an All-Star every year from 1933 to 1939, Gomez led the league twice each in wins, winning percentage and ERA; he was a three-time league leader in shutouts and strikeouts. In the first major league All-Star Game (July 6, 1933), Gomez was the winning pitcher for the American League (AL) and drove in the first run of the game. This was out of character for him; he was notorious for poor hitting even by AL standards. Late in life, Gomez commented, &quot;I never even broke a bat until last year when I was backing out of the garage.&quot; His career OPS+ of -7 is the fifth-worst in baseball history among players with at least 1,000 plate appearances. Gomez holds the record for the most innings pitched in a single All-Star game (six, in 1934).

Lefty&#x27;s best season came in 1934, when he won 26 games and lost just five. In both 1934 and 1937, he won pitching&#x27;s &quot;Triple Crown&quot; by leading the league in wins, ERA and strikeouts; he also led the AL both seasons in shutouts. His .649 career winning percentage ranks 15th in major league history among pitchers with 200 or more decisions. Among pitchers who made their MLB debuts from 1900 to 1950, only Lefty Grove, Christy Mathewson and Whitey Ford have both more victories and a higher winning percentage than Gomez.

Gomez won six World Series games without a loss. As of 2021, this is a postseason record as well as a World Series record. He won a World Series game in 1932, two in 1936, two in 1937 and one in 1938. He also set a World Series record by receiving two walks in the same inning on October 6, 1937.

Nicknamed &quot;El Goofo&quot; and &quot;Goofy Gomez&quot;, he was known for his sense of humor, even on the field. In one game, he came up to bat when it was slightly foggy. Bob Feller was on the mound and Gomez struck a match before stepping into the batter&#x27;s box. &quot;What&#x27;s the big idea?&quot; asked the umpire. &quot;Do you think that match will help you see Feller&#x27;s fast one?&quot; Gomez replied, &quot;No, I&#x27;m not concerned about that. I just want to make sure he can see me!&quot; Another time, a reporter asked the noted brushback pitcher, &quot;Is it true that you&#x27;d throw at your own mother?&quot; Gomez replied, &quot;You&#x27;re damn right I would. She&#x27;s a good hitter.&quot; Gomez also often remarked, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be lucky than good.&quot;

In 1940, Gomez suffered an arm injury, which left him up for grabs by another team, but in 1941 he played fairly well, winning 15 and losing 5. During that season, he was said to be a great starting pitcher, but won through the support of Johnny Murphy, who relieved him in later innings. After the 1942 season ended, Gomez took a job as a dispatcher with the General Electric River Works, a defense plant in Lynn, Massachusetts, which only paid $40 a week. Then on January 27, 1943, the Yankees sold him to the Boston Braves for $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms).

Gomez never appeared in a game with the Braves, as later in the year he was released from his contract and signed with the Washington Senators. He pitched just one game ― on May 30, 1943, allowing four hits, four runs and walking five men ― before pulling a shoulder muscle in the fifth inning and retiring from baseball. He had a 189–102 career record with 1,468 strikeouts and a 3.34 ERA in 2,503 innings pitched.

==Marriage==

On February 26, 1933, Gomez married June O’Dea (1912–1992). A Broadway headliner who starred in &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot;, she gave up her career in 1936. By 1937 the marriage was on shaky ground. Gomez traveled to Hollywood that April and June returned to Massachusetts to stay with family. Through the tabloids, she learned in December that Gomez was filing divorce papers in Mexico, charging incompatibility. Being a devout Catholic, June refused a divorce but agreed to a formal separation, citing abandonment and cruel and inhuman treatment. Publicly, Gomez said the whole idea of divorce was absurd, but after the first of the year he moved to Reno to get a six-week divorce. It was his intention for the divorce to be finalized by the time he began spring training in Florida. Separation proceedings continued for months, but were called off in May 1938. Gomez and O&#x27;Dea had two daughters and two sons.

==After baseball==
In retirement, Gomez became a sought-after dinner speaker known for his humorous anecdotes about his playing days and the personalities he knew. He was a bit of a screwball, nicknamed &quot;El Goofo&quot; or &quot;Goofy Gomez&quot; (a likewise-alliterative counterpart to his contemporary, Dizzy Dean), and delighted in playing practical jokes on everyone from teammates to umpires. On February 2, 1972, the Veterans Committee unanimously inducted Gomez into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, along with Giants outfielder Ross Youngs and former American League President Will Harridge. The Committee noted that Lefty pitched in seven World Series games with no losses and five wins. Wearing a Yankee cap, Gomez became the second player of Hispanic descent to be inducted.

The 1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was dedicated to Gomez as he was the last surviving player from the 1933 All-Star Game. He also threw out the ceremonial first pitch. On August 2, 1987, he and Whitey Ford were honored with plaques to be placed in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. Gomez&#x27;s plaque says he was &quot;Noted for his wit and his fastball, as he was fast with a quip and a pitch.&quot; Despite advancing age, he was able to attend the ceremony. Although he was honored with the plaque, his uniform #11 has not been retired, and has since been worn by several Yankees including Joe Page, Johnny Sain, Héctor López, Fred Stanley, Dwight Gooden, Chuck Knoblauch, Gary Sheffield, Doug Mientkiewicz, Brett Gardner, and now Anthony Volpe.

Gomez spent the last years of his life in Novato, California; he died of congestive heart failure on February 17, 1989, in Marin General Hospital in Larkspur, California. A decade later, he was ranked #73 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. The baseball field at White Hill Middle School in Fairfax, California is named for him.

<doc id="598577" wikidata="Q3909524" url="?curid=598577" title="Pacemaker potential">
<text>In the pacemaking cells of the heart (e.g., the sinoatrial node), the pacemaker potential (also called the pacemaker current) is the slow, positive increase in voltage across the cell&#x27;s membrane, that occurs between the end of one action potential and the beginning of the next. It is responsible for the self-generated rhythmic firing (automaticity) of pacemaker cells.

== Background ==

The cardiac pacemaker is the heart&#x27;s natural rhythm generator. It employs pacemaker cells that generate electrical impulses, known as cardiac action potentials. These potentials cause the cardiac muscle to contract, and the rate of which these muscles contract determines the heart rate.

As with any other cells, pacemaker cells have an electrical charge on their membranes. This electrical charge is called the membrane potential. After the firing of an action potential, the pacemaking cell&#x27;s membrane repolarizes (decreases in voltage) to its resting potential of -60 mV. From here, the membrane gradually depolarizes (increases in voltage) to the threshold potential of -40 mV, upon which the cell would go on to fire the next action potential. The rate of depolarization is the slope: the faster voltage increases, the steeper the slopes are in graphs. The slope determines the time taken to reach the threshold potential, and thus the timing of the next action potential.

In a healthy sinoatrial node (SAN, a complex tissue within the right atrium containing pacemaker cells that normally determine the intrinsic firing rate for the entire heart), the pacemaker potential is the main determinant of the heart rate. Because the pacemaker potential represents the non-contracting time between heart beats (diastole), it is also called the diastolic depolarization.
The amount of net inward current required to move the cell membrane potential during the pacemaker phase is extremely small, in the order of few pAs, but this net flux arises from time to time changing contribution of several currents that flow with different voltage and time dependence. Evidence in support of the active presence of K+, Ca2+, Na+ channels and Na+/K+ exchanger during the pacemaker phase have been variously reported in the literature, but several indications point to the “funny”(If) current as one of the most important.(see funny current). There is now substantial evidence that also sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-transients participate to the generation of the diastolic depolarization via a process involving the Na–Ca exchanger.

The rhythmic activity of some neurons like the pre-Bötzinger complex is modulated by neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, and such modulatory connectivity gives to the neurons the necessary plasticity to generating distinctive, state-dependent rhythmic patterns that depend on pacemaker potentials.

==Pacemakers==

The heart has several pacemakers, each which fires at its own intrinsic rate:
* &quot;SA node:&quot; 60–100 bpm
* &quot;Atrioventricular node(AVN):&quot; 40–60 bpm
* &quot;Purkinje fibres:&quot; 20–40 bpm

The potentials will normally travel in order
SA node → Atrioventricular node → Purkinje fibres

Normally, all the foci will end up firing at the SA node rate, not their intrinsic rate in a phenomenon known as overdrive-suppression. Thus, in the normal, healthy heart, only the SA node intrinsic rate is observable.

==Pathology==
However, in pathological conditions, the intrinsic rate becomes apparent. Consider a heart attack which damages the region of the heart between the SA node and the AV node.

SA node → |block| AV node → Purkinje fibres 

The other foci will not see the SA node firing; however, they will see the atrial foci. The heart will now beat at the intrinsic rate of the AV node.

==Induction==
The firing of the pacemaker cells is induced electrically by reaching the threshold potential of the cell membrane. The threshold potential is the potential an excitable cell membrane, such as a myocyte, must reach in order to induce an action potential. This depolarization is caused by very small net inward currents of calcium ions across the cell membrane, which gives rise to the action potential.

==Bio-pacemakers==
Bio-pacemakers are the outcome of a rapidly emerging field of research into a replacement for the electronic pacemaker. The bio-pacemaker turns quiescent myocardial cells (e.g. atrial cells) into pacemaker cells. This is achieved by making the cells express a gene which creates a pacemaker current.

<text>Bruce Bethke (born 1955) is an American author best known for his 1983 short story &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; which led to the widespread use of the term for the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. His novel, &quot;Headcrash&quot;, won the Philip K. Dick Award in 1995 for SF original paperback published in the US.

Bethke&#x27;s collected thoughts on the cyberpunk subculture are available on his website, in an essay entitled &quot;The Etymology of Cyberpunk&quot;.

Bethke served as a judge on the Philip K. Dick Award in 2013.

==Life==
Bethke lives in Minnesota where he works as a developer of supercomputer software.

==Bibliography==
* &quot;Maverick&quot;: Written from an outline by Isaac Asimov in 1990, this novel was one of a series of novels set in Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; universe.
* &quot;Headcrash&quot;: Bethke&#x27;s first published novel, published in 1995. &quot;Headcrash&quot; is the story of Jack Burroughs, a computer nerd in his mid twenties, who lives with his overbearing mother, and works a dead-end job at a software firm. Jack lives a far more interesting virtual life in the metaverse, where he is an elite hacker who goes by the handle MAX_KOOL. Along with his friend Gunnar, Jack is hired to hack into a corporate system to retrieve files proving that the company was stolen from the rightful heir of its founder. This novel was awarded the Philip K. Dick Award. This work is sometimes credited with the first use of the word &quot;Spam&quot; as a term for junk e-mail. Bethke replies that while he appreciates the thought, the term was in common use on usenet long before he used it in &quot;Headcrash&quot;.
* &quot;Rebel Moon&quot;: A collaboration with Vox Day, &quot;Rebel Moon&quot; was the novelization of the prequel of the game Rebel Moon Rising. The main plot is similar to &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, though the book itself focuses on a few individual characters and their battles in the war, and not the political and economic ramifications of a battle for independence on the moon.
*&quot;Wild Wild West&quot;: The novelization of the critically panned steampunk western comedy film &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. Bethke summarily dismisses the novel on his website, stating it was how he paid for a new roof for his house.

==Controversy==

===&quot;Cyberpunk&quot;===
Initially written as a series of short stories in 1980, the culminated novel was purchased by a publisher via an exclusive contract which forbade Bethke to sell the novel to any other publisher. The publisher decided not to release the novel, causing several years of legal battles over the rights to the book. Bethke has a downloadable version of the novel available for five dollars on his website.

When asked, during a 2005 interview, &quot;Why was your book Cyberpunk never published when you sold it to a publisher in 1989?&quot; Bruce replied, &quot;Ah, well, hindsight is 20/20. The book was never released because the publisher hated the ending and I refused to rewrite it. What the publisher wanted me to write was a &quot;Frazetta cover&quot; ending; you know, the hero, center stage, with a mighty weapon in his hands, a cowering half-naked babe at his feet, and the blood-smeared corpses of his many enemies piled high all around. To get to this ending I would have had to end the book with the lead character committing a massacre inside a school—which is what the publisher specifically asked me to write—but even 10 years before Columbine, I found that idea utterly revolting. So I refused to write it. Perhaps the publisher was right. Perhaps the book would have sold well with a blood-soaked adolescent revenge fantasy ending. But sales aren&#x27;t everything.&quot;

==Awards==
Bruce Bethke won the Philip K. Dick Award in 2012 for SF original paperback published in the US.
* 1995: Headcrash (Grand Central Publishing) - Winner.

==Anthology==
Bethke is currently creator and Editor in Chief of the monthly anthology series &quot;Stupefying Stories&quot; which he began publishing in 2012.

==&quot;Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star&quot;==
The manga series written by Kuga Cain loosely based on the anime series. It is an alternative telling of the story featured in the anime television series, with some changes to character designs, and the character of Ed portrayed as being male. While the original Japanese manga chapters were called &quot;Shoots&quot; without titles, the English version adds movie titles to each chapter (akin to the anime&#x27;s frequent use of song titles). The serialisation was canceled in mid-1998, leaving some plot points unresolved.

<doc id="598583" wikidata="Q525458" url="?curid=598583" title="Andy Breckman">
<text>Andrew Ross Breckman (born March 3, 1955) is an American screenwriter, comedian, and radio personality. He is the creator and executive producer of the Emmy Award-winning television series &quot;Monk&quot; on the USA Network and is co-host of WFMU radio&#x27;s long-running conceptual comedy program &quot;Seven Second Delay&quot;. He has written screenplays for a number of comedy films including &quot;Sgt. Bilko&quot; (starring Steve Martin) and &quot;Rat Race&quot; (directed by Jerry Zucker).

== Early life ==
Breckman was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, to a middle-class Jewish family. He grew up in Haddonfield, New Jersey and attended Moorestown Friends School and Haddonfield Memorial High School.

==Television work==
Breckman wrote for &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; from 1982 to 1984 and contributed sketches to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1983 to 1996. One of his most well-known vignettes was a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch called &quot;White Like Me&quot; (which he also directed), in which Eddie Murphy disguises himself as a Caucasian for a day. In 2004 he served as a jokewriter for comedian Steve Martin&#x27;s stint as host of the Academy Awards, for which Breckman was nominated for a Writers Guild of America (WGA) Award for TV writing.

Breckman&#x27;s biggest success, &quot;Monk&quot;, was a murder-mystery with a humorous edge. Breckman told &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; that he was a voracious reader of the works of Arthur Conan Doyle, John D. MacDonald, and other authors of “solvable” mysteries, as well as being a big fan of the TV series &quot;Columbo&quot;. “In a way, it’s similar to comedy writing,” he says. &quot;It&#x27;s puzzles and puzzle solving. Very logical.&quot; In August 2009, USA Network launched the spinoff &quot;Little Monk&quot;.

He wrote seven episodes of the 2000-2001 Comedy Central series &quot;TV Funhouse&quot;, and in 2015 wrote &quot;Dog Show&quot; for &quot;The Jack and Triumph Show&quot;. In July 2016 he was part of a team of writers for Triumph the Insult Comic Dog&#x27;s coverage of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia; the writing crew won the WGA 2017 Award for TV Comedy/Variety.

&quot;The Good Cop&quot;, another humorous murder-mystery series created and written by Breckman, debuted on Netflix in September 2018. (It ran for ten episodes before being cancelled.) The show starred Tony Danza as Tony Caruso Sr., &quot;a disgraced, former NYPD officer who never followed the rules,&quot; and Josh Groban as his son, Tony &quot;T.J.&quot; Caruso Jr., a squeaky-clean homicide detective. About the series, Breckman said, &quot;Many cop shows feature dark and provocative material: psycho-sexual killers, twisted, grim, flawed detectives. Many address the most controversial issues of the day. I watch a lot of them. God bless &#x27;em all. But the show I want to produce is playful, family-friendly, and a celebration of old-fashioned puzzle-solving.&quot;

In October 2018, TBS announced it would be launching a new TV series, &quot;The Misery Index&quot;, starring members of the Tenderloins comedy troupe, based on Breckman&#x27;s card game, &quot;Shit Happens&quot;. Breckman developed the TV version with Ben and Dan Newmark of Grandma&#x27;s House Entertainment. The series premiered on October 22, 2019. On December 3, 2019, it was announced the series was renewed for a second season. In 2021 it completed its third season.

Breckman wrote the screenplay for the feature-length film, &quot;Mr. Monk&#x27;s Last Case: A Monk Movie&quot;, which aired on the Peacock Network in December 2023. The film reunited most of the cast of the original series.

==Personal life==
Breckman lives in Madison, New Jersey with his wife, documentary filmmaker Beth Landau, whom he met on the dating pages of Nerve.com and who is nicknamed &quot;Boo.&quot; They have two children. In 2011, Breckman and Landau were a featured couple in the documentary &quot;When Strangers Click&quot;, a film about internet dating. As an engagement present, Breckman named a murder victim after his fiancée (spelled &quot;Beth Landow&quot;) in &quot;Monk&#x27;&quot;s season two (2003) episode, &quot;Mr. Monk Goes Back to School&quot;.

==Radio==
Since 1992, Breckman and WFMU station manager Ken Freedman have co-hosted a weekly one-hour comedy radio program, &quot;Seven Second Delay&quot;. The premise of the program seems to be a never-ending series of dead-on-arrival concepts, with the comedic value hinging on Breckman&#x27;s recurring acknowledgment of failure and his desire to go home as quickly as possible. Breckman has described his co-host as &quot;a sad, bitter little man and WFMU&#x27;s fundraisers are a good time to humiliate him and exploit his willingness to do just about anything, including prostituting himself, to raise money for his adorable little public hippy noise radio station.&quot;
From 2009 to 2012, &quot;Seven Second Delay&quot; broadcast remotely from the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater comedy club in Manhattan. In 2011 the UCB shows went bi-weekly. Guests on the program included Dick Cavett, Joe Franklin, Amy Sedaris, Peter Stampfel, Jules Feiffer, Andrew VanWyngarden (of the band MGMT), Dan Okrent, Nora Ephron, Wallace Shawn, Jim Downey, and numerous other celebrities.

In 1998, Gadfly Records released &quot;Death-Defying Radio Stunts&quot;, a CD of outrageous moments from &quot;Seven Second Delay&quot; studio broadcasts.

==Other projects==

In 2014 he launched a line of unusual toys under the brand name Uncle Andy Toys. Products which have reached the consumer market include &quot;Real Life Travel Bingo&quot;, &quot;Who Tooted?&quot;, and &quot;Rigged Trivia&quot;. In 2015 he launched &quot;Feed a Puppy,&quot; a live-streaming interactive animal app featuring real rescue puppies, in which users purchase treats to feed the puppies, with a portion of sales receipts donated to rescue shelters. In 2016, he funded his new card game, &quot;Shit Happens&quot;, with a successful Kickstarter campaign.

==Feud with Don McLean==
Early in his singing career, Breckman was given the opportunity to perform as opening act for &quot;American Pie&quot; singer Don McLean, with whom he shared management. The two did not get along, and a feud developed that has persisted to the present day. Andy Breckman wrote about the feud and Don McLean responded to Breckman&#x27;s claims on WFMU&#x27;s website.
