At the age of 25, he made his major league debut with the Senators on August 1, 1953, becoming only the fourth Venezuelan to play in Major League Baseball after Alex Carrasquel (1939), Chucho Ramos (1944) and Chico Carrasquel (1950). At 5&#x27;3&quot;, along with Stubby Magner he is the shortest person to have played a fielding position in Major League Baseball. He had a promising future, but his aversion to airplane travel, combined with a severe injury, curtailed his career in the major leagues.

Davalillo played eleven seasons in minor league baseball, nine of them at Triple-A level, and posted a .270 average in 1,207 games. He also played in Mexico (1962‚Äì64) and spent fourteen seasons with the Leones del Caracas of the Venezuelan Winter League (1952‚Äì53 and 1965‚Äì66). He is the second-smallest player in major league baseball history. The shortest player on record is 43-inch Eddie Gaedel, who got one plate appearance (a walk) as a 1951 publicity stunt. Five players listed at 5-3 have graced the major leagues since 1900, according to Baseball Reference, with Pompeyo Davalillo, Jess Cortazzo, Bob Emmerich, Stubby Magner and Mike McCormack combining for 90 hits in 463 at-bats&quot;.

==Career statistics==
In a 19-game major league career, Davalillo had 17 hits in 58 at bats for a .293 career batting average along with 2 runs batted in, 1 stolen base and scored 10 runs. He had a .305 on-base percentage along with a .935 fielding percentage. In 469 Venezuelan Winter League games, he was a .276 hitter with three home runs and 130 RBI, including 246 runs, 58 doubles, 19 triples and 67 stolen bases.

==Coaching career and honors==
After his playing career had ended, Davalillo became a coach and a manager in the Venezuelan league.

Davalillo was inducted into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 2006. His younger brother Vic Davalillo, also played in Major League Baseball.

<text>In plasma physics, the particle-in-cell (PIC) method refers to a technique used to solve a certain class of partial differential equations. In this method, individual particles (or fluid elements) in a Lagrangian frame are tracked in continuous phase space, whereas moments of the distribution such as densities and currents are computed simultaneously on Eulerian (stationary) mesh points.

PIC methods were already in use as early as 1955,
even before the first Fortran compilers were available. The method gained popularity for plasma simulation in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Buneman, Dawson, Hockney, Birdsall, Morse and others. In plasma physics applications, the method amounts to following the trajectories of charged particles in self-consistent electromagnetic (or electrostatic) fields computed on a fixed mesh. 
== Technical aspects ==

For many types of problems, the classical PIC method invented by Buneman, Dawson, Hockney, Birdsall, Morse and others is relatively intuitive and straightforward to implement. This probably accounts for much of its success, particularly for plasma simulation, for which the method typically includes the following procedures:
* Integration of the equations of motion.
* Interpolation of charge and current source terms to the field mesh.
* Computation of the fields on mesh points.
* Interpolation of the fields from the mesh to the particle locations.

Models which include interactions of particles only through the average fields are called PM (particle-mesh). Those which include direct binary interactions are PP (particle-particle). Models with both types of interactions are called PP-PM or P3M.

Since the early days, it has been recognized that the PIC method is susceptible to error from so-called &quot;discrete particle noise&quot;.

This error is statistical in nature, and today it remains less-well understood than for traditional fixed-grid methods, such as Eulerian or semi-Lagrangian schemes.

Modern geometric PIC algorithms are based on a very different theoretical framework. These algorithms use tools of discrete manifold, interpolating differential forms, and canonical or non-canonical symplectic integrators to guarantee gauge invariant and conservation of charge, energy-momentum, and more importantly the infinitely dimensional symplectic structure of the particle-field system.
These desired features are attributed to the fact that geometric PIC algorithms are built on the more fundamental field-theoretical framework and are directly linked to the perfect form, i.e., the variational principle of physics.

== Basics of the PIC plasma simulation technique ==

Inside the plasma research community, systems of different species (electrons, ions, neutrals, molecules, dust particles, etc.) are investigated. The set of equations associated with PIC codes are therefore the Lorentz force as the equation of motion, solved in the so-called &quot;pusher&quot; or &quot;particle mover&quot; of the code, and Maxwell&#x27;s equations determining the electric and magnetic fields, calculated in the &quot;(field) solver&quot;.

=== Super-particles ===

The real systems studied are often extremely large in terms of the number of particles they contain. In order to make simulations efficient or at all possible, so-called &quot;super-particles&quot; are used. A super-particle (or &quot;macroparticle&quot;) is a computational particle that represents many real particles; it may be millions of electrons or ions in the case of a plasma simulation, or, for instance, a vortex element in a fluid simulation. It is allowed to rescale the number of particles, because the acceleration from the Lorentz force depends only on the charge-to-mass ratio, so a super-particle will follow the same trajectory as a real particle would.

The number of real particles corresponding to a super-particle must be chosen such that sufficient statistics can be collected on the particle motion. If there is a significant difference between the density of different species in the system (between ions and neutrals, for instance), separate real to super-particle ratios can be used for them.

=== The particle mover ===

Even with super-particles, the number of simulated particles is usually very large (&gt; 105), and often the particle mover is the most time consuming part of PIC, since it has to be done for each particle separately. Thus, the pusher is required to be of high accuracy and speed and much effort is spent on optimizing the different schemes.

The schemes used for the particle mover can be split into two categories, implicit and explicit solvers. While implicit solvers (e.g. implicit Euler scheme) calculate the particle velocity from the already updated fields, explicit solvers use only the old force from the previous time step, and are therefore simpler and faster, but require a smaller time step. In PIC simulation the leapfrog method is used, a second-order explicit method. Also the &quot;Boris algorithm&quot; is used which cancel out the magnetic field in the Newton-Lorentz equation.

For plasma applications, the leapfrog method takes the following form:
:formula_1
:formula_2

where the subscript formula_3 refers to &quot;old&quot; quantities from the previous time step, formula_4 to updated quantities from the next time step (i.e. formula_5), and velocities are calculated in-between the usual time steps formula_6.

The equations of the Boris scheme which are substitute in the above equations are:
:formula_7
:formula_8

with 
:formula_9
:formula_10
:formula_11
:formula_12
and formula_13.

Because of its excellent long term accuracy, the Boris algorithm is the de facto standard for advancing a charged particle. It was realized that the excellent long term accuracy of nonrelativistic Boris algorithm is due to the fact it conserves phase space volume, even though it is not symplectic. The global bound on energy error typically associated with symplectic algorithms still holds for the Boris algorithm, making it an effective algorithm for the multi-scale dynamics of plasmas. It has also been shown

that one can improve on the relativistic Boris push to make it both volume preserving and have a constant-velocity solution in crossed E and B fields.

=== The field solver ===

The most commonly used methods for solving Maxwell&#x27;s equations (or more generally, partial differential equations (PDE)) belong to one of the following three categories:
* Finite difference methods (FDM)
* Finite element methods (FEM)
* Spectral methods

With the FDM, the continuous domain is replaced with a discrete grid of points, on which the electric and magnetic fields are calculated. Derivatives are then approximated with differences between neighboring grid-point values and thus PDEs are turned into algebraic equations.

Using FEM, the continuous domain is divided into a discrete mesh of elements. The PDEs are treated as an eigenvalue problem and initially a trial solution is calculated using basis functions that are localized in each element. The final solution is then obtained by optimization until the required accuracy is reached.

Also spectral methods, such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), transform the PDEs into an eigenvalue problem, but this time the basis functions are high order and defined globally over the whole domain. The domain itself is not discretized in this case, it remains continuous. Again, a trial solution is found by inserting the basis functions into the eigenvalue equation and then optimized to determine the best values of the initial trial parameters.

=== Particle and field weighting ===

The name &quot;particle-in-cell&quot; originates in the way that plasma macro-quantities (number density, current density, etc.) are assigned to simulation particles (i.e., the &quot;particle weighting&quot;). Particles can be situated anywhere on the continuous domain, but macro-quantities are calculated only on the mesh points, just as the fields are. To obtain the macro-quantities, one assumes that the particles have a given &quot;shape&quot; determined by the shape function
:formula_14

where formula_15 is the coordinate of the particle and formula_16 the observation point. Perhaps the easiest and most used choice for the shape function is the so-called &quot;cloud-in-cell&quot; (CIC) scheme, which is a first order (linear) weighting scheme. Whatever the scheme is, the shape function has to satisfy the following conditions:

space isotropy, charge conservation, and increasing accuracy (convergence) for higher-order terms.

The fields obtained from the field solver are determined only on the grid points and can&#x27;t be used directly in the particle mover to calculate the force acting on particles, but have to be interpolated via the &quot;field weighting&quot;:
:formula_17

where the subscript formula_18 labels the grid point. To ensure that the forces acting on particles are self-consistently obtained, the way of calculating macro-quantities from particle positions on the grid points and interpolating fields from grid points to particle positions has to be consistent, too, since they both appear in Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Above all, the field interpolation scheme should conserve momentum. This can be achieved by choosing the same weighting scheme for particles and fields and by ensuring the appropriate space symmetry (i.e. no self-force and fulfilling the action-reaction law) of the field solver at the same time

=== Collisions ===

As the field solver is required to be free of self-forces, inside a cell the field generated by a particle must decrease with decreasing distance from the particle, and hence inter-particle forces inside the cells are underestimated. This can be balanced with the aid of Coulomb collisions between charged particles. Simulating the interaction for every pair of a big system would be computationally too expensive, so several Monte Carlo methods have been developed instead. A widely used method is the &quot;binary collision model&quot;, in which particles are grouped according to their cell, then these particles are paired randomly, and finally the pairs are collided.

In a real plasma, many other reactions may play a role, ranging from elastic collisions, such as collisions between charged and neutral particles, over inelastic collisions, such as electron-neutral ionization collision, to chemical reactions; each of them requiring separate treatment. Most of the collision models handling charged-neutral collisions use either the &quot;direct Monte-Carlo&quot; scheme, in which all particles carry information about their collision probability, or the &quot;null-collision&quot; scheme, which does not analyze all particles but uses the maximum collision probability for each charged species instead.

=== Accuracy and stability conditions ===

As in every simulation method, also in PIC, the time step and the grid size must be well chosen, so that the time and length scale phenomena of interest are properly resolved in the problem. In addition, time step and grid size affect the speed and accuracy of the code.

For an electrostatic plasma simulation using an explicit time integration scheme (e.g. leapfrog, which is most commonly used), two important conditions regarding the grid size formula_19 and the time step formula_20 should be fulfilled in order to ensure the stability of the solution:
:formula_21
:formula_22

which can be derived considering the harmonic oscillations of a one-dimensional unmagnetized plasma. The latter conditions is strictly required but practical considerations related to energy conservation suggest to use a much stricter constraint where the factor 2 is replaced by a number one order of magnitude smaller. The use of formula_23 is typical. Not surprisingly, the natural time scale in the plasma is given by the inverse plasma frequency formula_24 and length scale by the Debye length formula_25.

For an explicit electromagnetic plasma simulation, the time step must also satisfy the CFL condition:
:formula_26
where formula_27, and formula_28 is the speed of light.

== Applications ==

Within plasma physics, PIC simulation has been used successfully to study laser-plasma interactions, electron acceleration and ion heating in the auroral ionosphere, magnetohydrodynamics, magnetic reconnection, as well as ion-temperature-gradient and other microinstabilities in tokamaks, furthermore vacuum discharges, and dusty plasmas.

Hybrid models may use the PIC method for the kinetic treatment of some species, while other species (that are Maxwellian) are simulated with a fluid model.

PIC simulations have also been applied outside of plasma physics to problems in solid and fluid mechanics.

<doc id="596818" wikidata="Q970102" url="?curid=596818" title="Tractatus Theologico-Politicus">
<text>The Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (TTP) or Theologico-Political Treatise, is a 1670 work of philosophy written in Latin by the Dutch philosopher Benedictus Spinoza (1632‚Äì1677). The book was one of the most important and controversial texts of the early modern period. Its aim was &quot;to liberate the individual from bondage to superstition and ecclesiastical authority.&quot; In it, Spinoza expounds his views on contemporary Jewish and Christian religion and critically analyses the Bible, especially the Old Testament, which underlies both. He argues what the best roles for state and religion should be and concludes that a degree of democracy and freedom of speech and religion works best, such as in Amsterdam, while the state remains paramount within reason. The goal of the state is to guarantee the freedom of citizens. Religious leaders should not interfere in politics. Spinoza interrupted his writing of his magnum opus, the &quot;Ethics&quot;, to respond to the increasing intolerance in the Dutch Republic, directly challenging religious authorities and their power over freedom of thought. He published the work anonymously, in Latin, rightly anticipating harsh criticism and vigorous attempts by religious leaders and conservative secular authorities to suppress his work entirely. He halted the publication of a Dutch translation. One described it as being &quot;Forged in hell by the apostate Jew working together with the devil&quot;. The work has been characterized as &quot;one of the most significant events in European intellectual history&quot;, laying the groundwork for ideas about liberalism, secularism, and democracy.

==Historical context==

The vaunted religious tolerance of the Dutch Republic was under strain in the mid-seventeenth century. War with England over trade and imperial dominance affected the Northern Netherlands&#x27; prosperity. The conservative leaders of the Dutch Reformed Church put pressure on civil authorities to curtail freedom of expression and the circulation of ideas to which they objected. In the political sphere conservatives sought to restore the position of stadholder, or head of state, with a member of the House of Orange. During the First Stadtholderless period (1650‚Äì1672) Johan de Witt functioned as head of state and was in favor of policies of religious toleration, which had helped fuel prosperity. Jews could practice their religion openly and were an integral part of the commercial sector. There were also a great number of Christian sects that contributed to the religious and intellectual ferment of the Republic. Some dissenters began openly challenging religious authorities and religion itself, as Spinoza had done, leading to his expulsion from the Jewish community in Amsterdam in 1656. A like-minded friend and kindred intellectual spirit, Adriaan Koerbagh (1633‚Äì1669), had published two works scathing of religion. Because they were published in Dutch rather than Latin, and therefore accessible to a much wider readership, he quickly came to the attention of religious authorities, arrested, and thrown into prison, where he quickly died. His death was a hard blow for Spinoza and his reaction was to commence writing in 1665 what became the &quot;TTP&quot;. Heeding the danger of writing in Dutch, Spinoza&#x27;s treatise is in Latin. Unlike the dense text of the Ethics, the &quot;TTP&quot; is much more accessible and deals with religion and politics rather than metaphysics. Scholars have suggested that the text of the TTP incorporates the Apologia (&quot;defense&quot;) he had written in Spanish after his expulsion from the Jewish community in 1656.

==Writing and publication history==

Spinoza had been working on his magnum opus, the &quot;Ethics&quot;, when he put it aside to write the &quot;TTP&quot;. Unlike the abstract composition of that work as a mathematical proof, the &quot;TTP&quot; is more discursive and accessible to readers of Latin. He wrote to Henry Oldenburg, Secretary of the Royal Society, who had visited him in the Netherlands and they continued the connection via letters, telling him about the new work. Oldenburg was surprised and Spinoza wrote his justifications for the diversion from metaphysics. The &quot;TTP&quot; is a frontal assault on the power of theologians underpinned by Scripture. Spinoza wanted to defend himself against charges of atheism. He sought the freedom to philosophize, unhindered by religious authority.
The treatise was published anonymously in 1670 by Jan Rieuwertsz in Amsterdam. In order to protect the author and publisher from political retribution, the title page identified the city of publication as Hamburg and the publisher as Henricus K√ºnraht. Spinoza wrote in Neo-Latin, the language of European scholars of the era. To reach beyond the scholarly readership in the Dutch Republic, publication in Dutch was the next step. Jan Hendriksz Glazemaker, Spinoza&#x27;s Dutch translator and a Collegiant freethinker, prepared the edition by 1671 and sent it to the publisher; Spinoza himself intervened to prevent its printing for the moment, since the translation could have put Spinoza and his circle of supporters in increased danger with authorities.

==Structure of the work==

The work comprises 20 named chapters preceded by a preface. The majority of chapters deal with aspects of religion, with the last five concerning aspects of the state.

==Treatment of religion==
In the treatise, Spinoza put forth his most systematic critique of Judaism, and all organized religion in general. Spinoza argued that theology and philosophy must be kept separate, particularly in the reading of Scripture. Whereas, he contends, the goal of theology is obedience, philosophy aims at understanding rational truth. Scripture does not teach philosophy and thus cannot be made to conform with it, otherwise the meaning of scripture will be distorted. Conversely, if reason is made subservient to scripture, then, Spinoza argues, &quot;the prejudices of a common people of long ago... will gain a hold on his understanding and darken it.&quot;

Spinoza held that purportedly supernatural occurrences, namely prophecy and miracles, have only natural explanations. He argued that God acts solely by the laws of God&#x27;s own nature and rejected the view that God acts for a particular purpose or &quot;telos&quot;. For Spinoza, those who believe that God acts for some particular end are delusional, projecting their hopes and fears onto the workings of nature.

==Scriptural interpretation==
Spinoza was not only the real father of modern metaphysics and moral and political philosophy, but also of the so-called higher criticism of the Bible. He was particularly attuned to the idea of interpretation; he felt that all organized religion was simply the institutionalized defense of particular interpretations. He rejected in its entirety the view that Moses composed the first five books of the Bible, called the Pentateuch by Christians or Torah by Jews. He provided an analysis of the structure of the Bible which demonstrated that it was essentially a compiled text with many different authors and diverse origins; in his view, it was not &quot;revealed&quot; all at once.

His &quot;Tractatus Theologico-Politicus&quot; undertook to show that Scripture, properly understood, gave no authority for the militant intolerance of the clergy who sought to stifle all dissent by the use of force. To achieve his object, Spinoza had to show what is meant by a proper understanding of the Bible, which gave him occasion to apply criticism to the Bible. His approach stood in stark contrast to contemporaries such as John Bunyan, Manasseh ben Israel, and militant clerics. Spinoza, who permitted no supernatural rival to Nature and no rival authority to the civil government of the state, rejected also all claims that Biblical texts should be treated in a manner entirely different from that in which any other document is treated that claims to be historical. His contention that the Bible &quot;is in parts imperfect, corrupt, erroneous, and inconsistent with itself, and that we possess but fragments of it&quot; roused great storm at the time, and was mainly responsible for his evil repute for a century at least. Nevertheless, many have gradually adopted his views, agreeing with him that the real &quot;word of God&quot;, or true religion, is not something written in books but &quot;inscribed on the heart and mind of man&quot;. Many scholars and religious leaders now praise Spinoza&#x27;s services in the correct interpretation of Scripture as a document of first rate importance in the progressive development of human thought and conduct.

==Treatment of Judaism==
Spinoza had been permanently excommunicated from the Jewish community in Amsterdam in 1656, having previously been raised in that community and educated in a yeshiva. After his expulsion, he never sought to return. In the &quot;TTP&quot; he does not refer to himself as a Jew, although a number of Christians labeled him a Jew. He only speaks of &quot;the Hebrews&quot; or &quot;the Jews&quot; in third person. His knowledge of Hebrew, his yeshiva studies of Jewish scripture, and his insider knowledge of how religious authorities exercised power by claiming special knowledge of sacred texts, meant Judaism was a salient target for his defense of individual freedom of thought. 

The treatise rejected the notion of the Jews being &quot;God&#x27;s chosen people&quot;. To Spinoza, all peoples are on par with each other, articulating a key element of what came to be called liberalism. God has not elevated one over the other. 

Spinoza also offered a sociological explanation as to how the Jewish people had managed to survive for so long, despite facing relentless persecution. In his view, the Jews had been preserved due to a combination of Gentile hatred and Jewish separatism.

He also gave one final, crucial reason for the continued Jewish presence, which in his view, was by itself sufficient to maintain the survival of the nation forever: circumcision. It was the ultimate anthropological expression of bodily marking, a tangible symbol of separateness which was the ultimate identifier.

Spinoza also posited a novel view of the Torah; he contended that it was essentially a political constitution of the ancient state of Israel. In his view, because the state no longer existed, its constitution could no longer be valid. He argued that the Torah was thus suited to a particular time and place; because times and circumstances had changed, the Torah could no longer be regarded as a legally binding document on the Jewish people.

==Spinoza&#x27;s political theory==
Spinoza agreed with Thomas Hobbes that if each man had to fend for himself, with nothing but his own right arm to rely upon, then the life of man would be &quot;nasty, brutish, and short&quot;. The truly human life is only possible in an organised community, that is, a state or commonwealth. The state ensures security of life, limb and property; it brings within reach of every individual many necessaries of life which he could not produce by himself; and it sets free sufficient time and energy for the higher development of human powers. Now the existence of a state depends upon a kind of implicit agreement on the part of its members or citizens to obey the sovereign authority which governs it. In a state no one can be allowed to do just as he pleases. Every citizen is obliged to obey its laws; and he is not free even to interpret the laws in a special manner. This looks at first like a loss of freedom on the part of the individuals, and the establishment of an absolute power over them. Yet that is not really so. In the first place, without the advantages of an organised state the average individual would be so subject to dangers and hardships of all kinds and to his own passions that he could not be called free in any real sense of the term, least of all in the sense that Spinoza used it. Man needs the state not only to save him from others but also from his own lower impulses and to enable him to live a life of reason, which alone is truly human. In the second place, state sovereignty is never really absolute. It is true that almost any kind of government is better than none, so that it is worth bearing much that is irksome rather than disturb the peace. But a reasonably wise government will even in its own interest endeavour to secure the good will and cooperation of its citizens by refraining from unreasonable measures, and will permit or even encourage its citizens to advocate reforms, provided they employ peaceable means. In this way the state really rests, in the last resort, on the united will of the citizens, on what Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who read Spinoza, subsequently called the &quot;general will&quot;.

Spinoza sometimes writes that the state ought to be accorded absolute sovereignty over its subjects. But that is due mainly to his determined opposition to every kind of ecclesiastical control over it. Though he is prepared to support what may be called a state religion, as a kind of spiritual cement, his account of this religion is such as to make it acceptable to the adherents of any one of the historic creeds, to deists, pantheists and all others, provided they are not fanatical believers or unbelievers. It is ostensibly in the interest of freedom of thought and speech that Spinoza would entrust the civil government with something approaching absolute sovereignty in order to effectively resist the tyranny of the militant churches.

===Human power consists in strength of mind and intellect===
One of the most striking features in Spinoza&#x27;s political theory is his basic principle that &quot;right is might.&quot; This principle he applied systematically to the whole problem of government, and seemed rather pleased with his achievement, inasmuch as it enabled him to treat political theory in a scientific spirit, as if he were dealing with applied mathematics. The identification or correlation of right with power has caused much misunderstanding. People supposed that Spinoza reduced justice to brute force. But Spinoza was very far from approving &quot;Realpolitik&quot;. In the philosophy of Spinoza the term &quot;power&quot; (as should be clear from his moral philosophy) means a great deal more than physical force. In a passage near the end of his &quot;Political Treatise&quot; he states explicitly that &quot;human power chiefly consists in strength of mind and intellect&quot; ‚Äî it consists in fact, of all the human capacities and aptitudes, especially the highest of them. Conceived correctly, Spinoza&#x27;s whole philosophy leaves ample scope for ideal motives in the life of the individual and of the community. However, Spinoza considers only men full citizens, as outlined in his unfinished &quot;Tractus Politicus&quot;, as noted by biographers Steven Nadler and Jonathan I. Israel.

===Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy===
Spinoza discusses the principal kinds of states, or the main types of government, namely, monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. Each has its own peculiarities and needs special safeguards, if it is to realise the primary function of a state. Monarchy may degenerate into tyranny unless it is subjected to various constitutional checks which will prevent any attempt at autocracy. Similarly, Aristocracy may degenerate into oligarchy and needs analogous checks. On the whole, Spinoza favours democracy, by which he meant any kind of representative government. In the case of democracy, the community and the government are more nearly identical than in the case of monarchy or aristocracy; consequently a democracy is least likely to experience frequent collisions between the people and the government and so is best adapted to secure and maintain that peace.

==Reception and influence==
It is unlikely that Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus&quot; ever had political support of any kind, with attempts being made to suppress it even before Dutch republican magistrate Johan de Witt&#x27;s murder in 1672. In 1673, it was publicly condemned by the Dutch Reformed Church&#x27;s Synod of Dordrecht (1673) and officially banned the following year. Harsh criticism of the TTP began to appear almost as soon as it was published. One of the first, and most notorious, critiques was by Leipzig professor Jakob Thomasius in 1670.
Conversely, the British philosopher G. E. Moore suggested to Ludwig Wittgenstein that he title one of his works &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; as a homage to Spinoza&#x27;s treatise.

<text>Phanom Rung Historical Park is an archaeological site in Thailand, covering the ruins of Prasat Phanom Rung (, ), a Hindu Khmer Empire temple complex set on the rim of an extinct volcano at elevation. It is located in Buriram Province in the Isan region of Thailand, and was built at a time when Khmer social-political influences were significant in Srisaket. It was built of sandstone and laterite between the 10th and 13th centuries. It was a Hindu shrine dedicated to Shiva, and symbolises Mount Kailash, his heavenly dwelling.

The Phanom Rung sanctuary compound was constructed over several phases, dated by means of iconography of its art and architectural styles together with its inscriptions. These comprise two foundations of sacred brick buildings of 10th century C.E., the minor sanctuary of 11th century, the central sanctuary built by King Suryavarman II in 12th century and two Bannalais (libraries) of the 13th century. Further sacred buildings built in the reign of King Jayavarman VII in 13th century, including the Royal attire Changing Pavilion, the Kudi Rishis of Nong Bua Ray, the medical centre or hospital (Arokayasala) and Prasat Ban Bu, a rest house with fire where travelers could shelter (Dharmasala) on the plain at the foot of Phanom Rung, alongside the road linking Angkor and Phimai. These evidence an important vice-regal centre on and around the mountain that flourishes from the 10th to the 13th centuries.

Thailand&#x27;s Department of Fine Arts spent 17 years restoring the complex to its original state from 1971 to 1988. On 21 May 1988, the park was officially opened by Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn. In 2005, the temple was submitted to UNESCO for consideration as a future World Heritage Site.

Phanom Rung is an extinct volcano in elevation in Ta Pek subdistrict, Chaloem Phra Kiat district, Buriram. The name comes from , meaning &#x27;large mountain&#x27;.

==Architecture==
After the three-leveled lower stairway is the first cruciform platform, giving a first peek at the main temple. On the right, northward, is Phlab Phla or the White Elephant House. The pavilion is believed to be the place where kings and the royal family would change attire before rituals. Royalty would then enter the processional walkway, one of the most impressive elements of the park. It is 160 meters long and bordered by seventy sandstone posts with tops of lotus buds. The walkway itself is paved with laterite blocks.

The walkway leads to the first of three naga bridges. The five-headed snakes face all four directions and are from the 12th century. This bridge represents the connection between heaven and earth. The naga bridge leads to the upper stairway, which is divided into five sets. Each set has terraces on the sides. The last terrace is wide, made with laterite blocks. It has a cruciform shape and four small pools. A couple more steps lead to the second naga bridge. It has the same shape as the first one, only smaller. In the middle the remains of an eight petalled lotus carving can be seen.

This final terrace leads to the outer gallery. It probably used to be a wooden gallery with a tiled roof, but only a raised floor of laterite remains. After the outer gallery one reaches the inner gallery, which is divided in long and narrow rooms. It served as a wall around the principal tower. This last gallery leads to the third and last naga bridge, another small copy of the first one.

The bridge leads directly into the main sanctuary. After the antechamber and the annex, one reaches the principal tower. Double porches lead out in all directions. The inner sanctum used to have the &quot;linga&quot;, the divine symbol of Shiva. Currently, only the &quot;somasutra&quot; remains which was used to drain water during religious rites. The entrances have various lintels and icons depicting Hindu religious stories, e.g., the dancing Shiva and the five yogis. The south entrance is guarded by a sandstone statue.

Apart from the main tower, other buildings in the compound are:
* Two brick sanctuaries built around the 10th century, northeast of the tower.
* The minor sanctuary southwest of the tower with a sandstone altar for a sacred image. It was built with sandstone in the 11th century. Prang Noi has only one entrance facing east. The sanctuary is square with indented corners, giving it a round feel.
* Two Bannalai southeast and northeast of the principal tower. The buildings are rectangular and have only one entrance. They were built in the last period, around the 13th century, and used as a library for holy scriptures.

==Phra Narai Lintel==

One of the most well-known elements of the temple is a decorative lintel placed above the eastern entrance to the central sanctuary. It depicts a reclining Vishnu or Vishnu Anantasayin, and is known in Thai as &quot;Thap Lang Narai Banthomsin&quot; ().

The lintel is best known for its restitution from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1988. It had been stolen from the temple site in the 1960s and was acquired by the museum in 1967, where it was displayed for over twenty years, described as &quot;the Birth of Brahma with Reclining Vishnu on a Makara&quot;. In early 1988, as restoration of the temple neared completion, calls were made by several parties in Thailand for its return. The issue became the subject of intense media attention, with some even accusing the US Government of facilitating the theft. The Thai government entered negotiations with the museum, which was unwilling to consider an unconditional return, since it had acquired the item in good faith. Finally, in October, the museum agreed to repatriate the lintel in exchange for a donation from the Chicago-based Elizabeth F. Cheney Foundation. The lintel&#x27;s arrival in Thailand on 10 November was widely celebrated, and was covered live on the national TV pool. It was restored to its original position on 7 December, marking the completion of the temple&#x27;s restoration.

<text>Cable (Nathan Christopher Charles Summers) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with X-Force and the X-Men. Nathan first appeared as the newborn infant in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #201 (Jan. 1986) created by writer Chris Claremont and penciler Rick Leonardi, while Cable first appeared in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #87 (March 1990) created by writer Louise Simonson and artist/co-writer Rob Liefeld; Cable&#x27;s origin initially was undecided and he was assumed to be a separate character, but it was later decided that he was actually an older version of Nathan due to being a time traveler.

Nathan Summers is the son of the X-Men member Cyclops (Scott Summers) and his first wife Madelyne Pryor (Jean Grey&#x27;s clone), as well as the &quot;half&quot;-brother of Rachel Summers from the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; timeline and Nate Grey from the timeline of the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline, the genetic template of the mutant terrorist Stryfe (one of his deadliest enemies), and the adoptive father of Hope Summers. Born in the present-day, Nathan was infected with a deadly techno-organic virus while still an infant. He was sent into a possible future timeline where he could be treated and live his life. In this future world, Nathan grew into the warrior Cable and became an enemy of the villain Apocalypse. He later returned to the present-day era, initially arriving some years before his own birth. Since making his home in the modern era, he has worked alongside the X-Men (including Cyclops and Jean Grey) and reformed the New Mutants group into the original X-Force. He had frequent battles against the near-invincible assassin Deadpool, who later became an on-again, off-again ally for years. In the 2018 &quot;Extermination&quot; mini-series, Cable was killed and replaced by a younger, time-displaced version of himself who decided that the older one was ineffective in his crusade; this younger version (Nate Summers, sometimes called Kid Cable) operated until 2021, when the original, older iteration was revived.

Cable was introduced to a wider audience as a recurring character in &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; (1992‚Äì1997) and its sequel series, voiced by Lawrence Bayne and by Chris Potter respectively. The character made his live-action cinematic debut in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018), portrayed by Josh Brolin.

==Publication history==
===Creation===

Nathan Christopher Charles Summers is the son of Scott Summers (aka Cyclops), and Madelyne Pryor (who was later revealed in the &quot;Inferno&quot; storyline to be a clone of Jean Grey). Writer Chris Claremont, who had written the series since issue #94 (Aug. 1975), revealed Madelyne to be pregnant in &quot;X-Men/Alpha Flight&quot; #1 (Dec. 1985). The next depiction of her pregnancy was in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #200, when she goes into premature labor. In the following issue, #201 (Jan. 1986), Nathan first appears as a newborn infant.

The character&#x27;s first appearance as the adult warrior Cable was at the end of &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #86 (Feb. 1990). He does not appear anywhere in the issue&#x27;s story except for the &quot;next issue&quot; teaser. This was followed by a full appearance in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #87 (March 1990). At first, Cable was not intended to be the adult version of Nathan Summers, but was created as a result of unrelated editorial concerns. Editor Bob Harras wanted to &quot;shake things up&quot; for the book, and felt a new leader was needed, a sharp contrast from the group&#x27;s founder and first mentor, Professor X. The book&#x27;s writer, Louise Simonson, thought a military leader would be a good idea, and Harras tasked the book&#x27;s artist, Rob Liefeld, to conceptualize the character. Harras may also have suggested the character&#x27;s bionic eye. in Liefeld&#x27;s sketches his appearance was dubbed a &quot;Dark Schwarzenegger Type&quot; and derived from Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s roles in &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot;. Both Simonson and Liefeld each separately conceived of the leader being a mysterious time traveler from the future. Liefeld chose the name Cable for the character. Liefeld explains the creation of the character:

Harras and writer/artists Jim Lee and Whilce Portacio, who were writing the &quot;X-Men&quot; spinoff &quot;X-Factor&quot; that starred Cyclops and the other four original X-Men, decided that Nathan would be sent into the future and grow up to become Cable. Liefeld, who conceived that Cable and his archenemy Stryfe were one and the same, disliked this idea. (Eventually Stryfe was revealed to be a clone of Cable.) In the 1991 &quot;X-Factor&quot; storyline, Nathan is infected by the villain Apocalypse with a techno-organic virus. Because he can only be saved by the technology of the far-future, Scott reluctantly allows Sister Askani, a member of a clan of warriors dedicated to opposing Apocalypse, to take Nathan into the future so that he can be cured, a one-way trip from which she tells him she and Nathan will be unable to return.

===&quot;New Mutants&quot; and &quot;X-Force&quot;===
In his first adult appearance, Cable is seen in conflict with Stryfe&#x27;s Mutant Liberation Front, the United States government, and Freedom Force. The New Mutants intervene and he asks for their help against the Mutant Liberation Front. Cable sees them as potential soldiers in his war against Stryfe, and becomes their new teacher and leader. He comes into conflict with Wolverine, who is revealed to harbor a feud with Cable. Despite this, the two warriors and the New Mutants team up against the MLF. Cable also leads the New Mutants against Cameron Hodge and the Genoshans in the 1990 &quot;X-Tinction Agenda&quot; storyline.

With the aid of Domino, Cable reorganizes the New Mutants into X-Force. &quot;The New Mutants&quot; ended with issue #100, with Cable and other characters then appearing the following month in &quot;X-Force&quot; #1. The &quot;X-Force&quot; series provided further detail for the character&#x27;s back story revealing that he was from the future and that he had traveled to the past with the aim of stopping Stryfe&#x27;s plans as well as preventing Apocalypse&#x27;s rise to power. Cable traveled between the 1990s and his future with his ship &quot;Graymalkin&quot;, which contained a sentient computer program called Professor, the future version of the program built into X-Factor&#x27;s Ship.

In 1992, the character starred in a two issue miniseries, &quot;Cable: Blood and Metal&quot;, written by Fabian Nicieza, pencilled by John Romita, Jr., and inked by Dan Green, published in October and November of that year. The series explored Cable and the villain Stryfe&#x27;s ongoing battle with one another, and its effect on Cable&#x27;s supporting cast.

===&quot;Cable&quot; vol. 1, &quot;Soldier X&quot; and &quot;Major X&quot;===

Shortly after &quot;Blood and Metal&quot;, Cable was given his own ongoing series titled Cable. Issue #6 (Dec. 1993) confirmed the character to be Nathan Christopher Summers, the son of Cyclops (Scott Summers) and Madelyne Pryor (Jean Grey&#x27;s clone) who had been taken to the future in &quot;X-Factor&quot; #68 (July 1991), introduced by writer Chris Claremont, and appeared in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #201 (Jan. 1986). The series ran for 107 issues from May 1993 until September 2002 before being relaunched as &quot;Soldier X&quot;, which lasted 12 more issues until Aug. 2003.

The 1994 miniseries &quot;The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix&quot; provided further information on the character&#x27;s back story. In the future, Mother Askani, a time-displaced Rachel Summers, pulled the minds of Scott and Jean into the future where, as &quot;Slym&quot; and &quot;Redd&quot;, they raised Cable for twelve years. During their time together, the &quot;family&quot; prevented Apocalypse from transferring his essence into a new body, ending his reign of terror. It is furthermore established that Mister Sinister created Cyclops&#x27; son Nathan (who became the time-traveling soldier Cable) to destroy Apocalypse.

The 2019 miniseries &quot;Major X&quot; further revealed that at some point in a possible future, where mutants live together in a Utopian society called the X-Istence, Cable has fathered a son named Alexander Nathaniel Summers. Wearing a red-and-black costume that completely covers him from head-to-toe, Alexander under the Major X alias, traveled to the past in search of Cable with the hope he can help save his reality from fading away.

===&quot;Cable &amp; Deadpool&quot;, &quot;Cable&quot; vol. 2===

After his solo series ended, Cable was paired with the mercenary Deadpool in a new ongoing series titled &quot;Cable &amp; Deadpool&quot;. The series largely dealt with Cable&#x27;s efforts to change the world for the better, including turning his old spaceship &quot;Greymalkin&quot; into the floating utopian island of Providence. The first story arc of the series features a Cable who has learned to suppress his techno-organic virus to a nearly effortless degree, allowing him to access the better part of his vast psionic powers. He gains a power level similar to his Nate Grey counterpart from The Age of Apocalypse reality and tries to use them to force the people of the world to live in peace.

===&quot;Avengers: X-Sanction&quot;===
On July 27, 2011, Marvel announced at San Diego Comic-Con the return of Cable. The new project, originally titled as &quot;Cable Reborn&quot;, was re-titled as &quot;Avengers: X-Sanction&quot;, written by Jeph Loeb and drawn by Ed McGuinness. The miniseries served as a lead-in to the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline beginning in April 2012.

===&quot;Cable and X-Force&quot;===
Cable&#x27;s next appearance was in a new series, &quot;Cable and X-Force&quot; by writer Dennis Hopeless and artist Salvador Larroca. The series debuted in December 2012 and features Cable and a new fugitive team, unofficially referred to by the Marvel Universe media as the new &quot;X-Force&quot;. This version of X-Force initially consists of Cable, Colossus, Doctor Nemesis, Domino, and Forge. This series focuses on eliminating disasters based on mysterious visions that Cable is receiving, resorting to occasionally more brutal methods than the prime X-teams would use. After the events of &quot;Avengers X-Sanction&quot; Cable is forced to wear an eye patch and an advanced harness for his non-functioning left arm that was created by Forge. Although Hope healed his arm, it is useless because it is not his original arm as it has been destroyed a few times, notably in his battles with Silver Surfer and Bastion.

===&quot;X-Force&quot;===
Continuing from &quot;Cable and X-Force&quot; Cable puts together a new X-Force team with Psylocke, Dr. Nemesis, Fantomex, Marrow and new recruit MeMe to track down and deal with mutant threats using lethal force. The story is written by &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot; writer Simon Spurrier. Cable is infected with an extra-dimensional Super Soldier Serum that provides superpowers at the cost of killing them in around a year, however Cable is injected with an early version designed to kill him in a day. Cable&#x27;s daughter Hope accidentally copies this virus, since it is based on superpowers, and has to be placed into a coma to save her life. Cable cannot defeat the virus either, so he creates a new clone each day to replace himself but each clone still has only one day to live. Cable and X-Force eventually track down the man Volga who created the biotech virus and defeat him. However, Fantomex goes insane from needing to &quot;be the best&quot; and betrays the team using new god-like powers derived from a digitized form of the Volga Effect he had copied during a tryst with Meme. Nemesis and Forget-Me-Not unleashes hundreds of Cable clones to fight him, with Hope eventually stopping Fantomex and saving Cable after the last clone is killed wherein her father stepped up to bat while about to catch fire from Volga&#x27;s poison. Hope then takes over as leader of X-Force and &quot;fires&quot; Cable for his morally questionable methods.

===&quot;Cable and Deadpool: Split Second&quot;===
After traveling through time and fixing several mistakes that a future Deadpool caused, Cable and present-Deadpool eventually fix the timeline. The effects on the timeline causes Cable to revert to his original &quot;status quo&quot;, with his robotic arm and his original telekinesis and telepathic power set.

===&quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot;===
Cable is seen in the year 2087 dealing with some unidentified issue related to Stryfe, in the aftermath of an Inhuman attack that covers the city of Boston in sentient plant life led by the Shredded Man. He and his A.I. Belle eventually joins the rest of the Uncanny Avengers helping Synapse in the present and helps deal with the Inhuman causing the problems, before deciding to join the team when he learns the team&#x27;s true mission is dealing with the Red Skull with Professor Xavier&#x27;s brain and powers. After Captain America disbands the Uncanny Avengers in the aftermath of the &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline and Cable and Rogue team up with villains Sebastian Shaw and Toad to find a cure for the Terrigen Mists, Rogue continues the team in their mission to stop the Red Skull.

===&quot;Cable&quot; vol. 3/4, Death, Young Cable ===
After the events of &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Cable stars in his third ongoing monthly series, as part of Marvel&#x27;s 2017 &quot;X-Men: ResurrXion&quot; relaunch of its &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;Inhumans&quot;-related books. In this series, Cable is depicted as a member of an organization that protects the Marvel universe timeline from damage caused by time travel. The first arc of this series &quot;Conquest&quot;, sees Cable tracking down a time-traveling villain. The second arc, &quot;The Newer Mutants&quot;, has Cable assemble a team trying to determine who is murdering Externals. The third arc, &quot;Past Fears&quot;, spans five eras of Cable&#x27;s history and sees him battling a techno-organic villain known as Metus.

During a series called &quot;Extermination&quot; by Ed Brisson and Pepe Larraz, Cable was assassinated by his younger self who takes his place. Later, &quot;Old&quot; Cable returns and obtains a position in S.W.O.R.D., but assisted his younger self defeating Stryfe, ensuring the younger one is sent back in time.

==Powers and abilities==
Cable was born with telepathic and telekinetic abilities. The extent to which he has been able to utilize these powers has varied dramatically throughout his appearances. Originally, both were limited by his need to restrain his techno-organic infection, and his powers were negligible compared to his more traditional fighting skills. Following the subsidence of the infection, they gradually increased to the point where they were similar in magnitude to those of Nate Grey, to whom he is genetically identical. At their height, he demonstrated the ability to simultaneously levitate the floating city of Providence and combat the Silver Surfer.

Following that story, his powers were burnt out and he replaced both with technological substitutes. He later lost and regained his abilities again when he was de-aged during &quot;House of M&quot; while mending Deadpool&#x27;s maligned physiology as he progressed to his proper age. Cable himself stated that both his telepathy and telekinesis have faded to nothing.

Cable has fought Wolverine to a stalemate, defeated Captain America in hand-to-hand combat, and defeated Falcon, Red Hulk, and Iron Man using both brute force and wit, all while Cable was in severe pain and hours away from dying of his techno-organic infection.

When Professor Xavier&#x27;s son Legion travels back in time to kill Magneto in the &quot;Legion Quest&quot; storyline, Beast notes that Cable possesses &quot;latent time-travel abilities&quot;. With the assistance of Shi&#x27;ar technology, Professor Xavier &quot;jump-starts&quot; this ability while Jean Grey telekinetically holds Cable&#x27;s body together, allowing Cable to send his consciousness into the past.

His techno-organic body parts possess enhanced strength and durability, and his techno-organic left eye gives him enhanced eyesight, allowing him to see farther than a normal human and in the infrared spectrum. He is also able to interface his techno-organic body parts with other types of machinery, an ability that allows him to hack into computers, open electronic locks, and travel through time.

In the &quot;Messiah War&quot; storyline, during the fight with his clone, Stryfe, Cable demonstrates the ability to hide others from Stryfe&#x27;s mental view, implying that at least he retains some of his telepathic powers. He also still possesses some of his telekinesis, but he is using it solely to keep the techno-organic virus in his body at bay. As well as holding onto just enough telepathic power to simulate technopathy and facilitate technopathy through the use of future Stark Industries technology.

As of the end of the &quot;Avengers: X-Sanction&quot; storyline, Hope Summer has apparently cured Cable of the techno-organic virus using the Phoenix Force, and appears to at least have his telepathy. As a result, his cybernetic eye and arm have been restored to flesh and blood, although almost nonfunctional and atrophied, forcing Cable to wear an eyepatch (hiding a -like implant) and use an enhanced brace, made by Forge and laden with special weaponry. Due to a future Hope&#x27;s tampering with his mind, he also gained the ability to see multiple possible future events before they unfolded.

After being afflicted by a derivative of the super soldier formula from an alternate reality, Cable was left incapacitated as the faulty chemical weapons test would cause his physiology to self-destruct if left unchecked. To compensate for his genetic instability, he had Dr. Nemesis place his body in suspended animation until they could find a cure for his condition. In the meantime, Cable would operate his X-Force team through short-lived clones whom had a fraction of his precognition and a shortened lifespan due to being carbon copies with the faulty Volga Effect serum coursing in their systems. Making his clones useful for kamikaze attacks as they only last about a day&#x27;s time before violently detonating on their own or when they whistle an audio failsafe to trigger it.

In &quot;Deadpool &amp; Cable: Split Second&quot;, Cable once again loses most of his powers, but retains his precognition. He regains them along with his cybernetics as a result of Deadpool repairing Cable&#x27;s personal timeline.

Cable not only regained his psionic abilities, he had even regained the underlying potential he had always possessed since infancy. Having engaged in a psionic battle with a clone of the Red Skull, who had stolen the brain of the deceased Charles Xavier, the clone revealed that Mr. Summers was in fact an omega level mutant. Nathan often makes use of a spear-like morph weapon called the Psi-Mitar, which was originally a long staff with a spear point on one end and a scythe blade on the other, used primarily by the Askani. It functions as a focus and amplifier for telepathic or telekinetic power, which it can combine then project as powered psychic force blasts.

Apart from his superhuman abilities, Cable has been said to have a brilliant mind for military tactics.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Cable 6th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Cable 11th in their &quot;8 X-Men Kids Cooler Than Their Parents (And 7 Who Are Way Worse)&quot; list.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Cable 1st in their &quot;X-Force: 20 Powerful Members&quot; list.

==Other versions==
In addition to his mainstream Marvel Universe incarnation, Cable has been depicted in other fictional universes.

===Cable and Deadpool===
In the &quot;Cable and Deadpool&quot; series storyline &quot;Enema of State&quot;, Deadpool and the mutants Cannonball and Siryn discover several alternate versions of Cable as they traverse several alternate universes, searching for the Cable who was native to their own reality. They first encounter an evil incarnation of Cable who has become one of the four Horsemen of Apocalypse, taking the name War. Other versions include a guru-type known as &quot;Brother Nathan&quot; living on an Earth where all violence has been abolished, a Phalanx-possessed Cable consumed by the techno-organic virus within his body, and an infant version cared for by Mister Sinister on a quiet Nebraska farm in the &quot;House of M&quot; reality. Deadpool eventually realizes the infant is indeed &quot;his&quot; version of Cable, de-aged. Returning the child to their home universe, Deadpool cares for Nathan until an injection of Deadpool&#x27;s DNA allows him to rapidly grow back into adulthood.

===Earth X===
In the reality of the &quot;Earth X&quot; series and its sequel comics, the Techno-organic virus has overtaken Cable&#x27;s body, transforming him into a blob of organic metal.

===Deadpool Pulp===
In the &quot;Deadpool Pulp&quot; timeline, Cable is a human military officer called General Cable native to the early 20th century. Along with his colleagues General Stryfe and J. Edgar Hoover, he hires former CIA Agent Wade Wilson to get back a stolen nuclear briefcase.

===Wolverine: Rahne of Terra===
In the fantasy world depicted in the graphic novel &quot;Wolverine: Rahne of Terra&quot;, Cable&#x27;s counterpart is a wizard called the Mage, who carries the Warlock Staff and a crossbow.

===Ultimate Marvel===
An Ultimate equivalent of Cable is seen in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; as an older version of Logan / Wolverine who lives in a possible future having lost his healing factor and leaving him an amputee, losing his left arm. He time travels to his past to prepare Professor Xavier for a coming battle with Apocalypse. After Apocalypse&#x27;s death, Cable fades out of existence, having now changed the past and prevented his rule.

===What If...?===
A two-part storyline in the series &quot;What If...?&quot; asks, &quot;What If Cable Destroyed the X-Men?&quot; In this story, Cable clashes with Professor X and the X-Men over their beliefs and differences in methods. Ultimately, Cable leads a faction of mutants loyal to him and assassinates the Professor, Cyclops, and Jean Grey before embarking on a violent crusade. Cable is ultimately killed by Wolverine, but his actions have already led to the further mistrust and oppression of mutants. Magneto attempts to take control of the United States in the chaos, but is killed by a new model of plastic Sentinels, who decide that enslaving humanity is the best way to root out mutants. Wolverine assembles a new team of X-Men to fight the Sentinel rule.

===&quot;X-Men Forever&quot;===
&quot;X-Men Forever&quot; volume 2 and the sequel series &quot;X-Men Forever 2&quot; take place in an alternate universe written by Chris Claremont that picks up after the events of &quot;X-Men&quot; #3 (1991). The series depicts stories and ideas Claremont would have done if he hadn&#x27;t left the series in 1991. In this timeline, Nathan was still saved during the &quot;Inferno&quot; event, but was aged somehow from a toddler into an older child. Wishing to distance him from the dangers the X-Men face, Cyclops sends Nathan to live with his great-grandmother and grandfather in Alaska. An attack by mysterious agents causes Nathan to be moved to the protective custody of the Starjammers. He is shown to possess telepathic powers. Cable appears in one panel of the series but no connection between Cable and Nathan is made, possibly because Claremont intended to follow the original idea that they were separate characters.

==Influence==
Artist Alex Ross drew upon his dislike of Liefeld&#x27;s design of Cable when Ross designed the character Magog for the 1996 miniseries &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. Following writer Mark Waid&#x27;s instructions that the character&#x27;s appearance be based on aspects of superhero design trends of the time that they disliked, Ross said of Cable, &quot;That&#x27;s a character that Mark Waid invented that was really just put to me like come up with the most God awful, Rob Liefeld sort of design that you can. What I was stealing from was ‚Äì really only two key designs of Rob&#x27;s ‚Äì the design of Cable. I hated it. I felt like it looked like they just threw up everything on the character ‚Äì the scars, the thing going on with his eye, the arm, and what&#x27;s with all the guns? But the thing is, when I put those elements together with the helmet of Shatterstar ‚Äì I think that was his name ‚Äì well, the ram horns and the gold, suddenly it held together as one of the designs that I felt happiest with in the entire series.&quot;

<text>Osogbo (also known as &quot;O·π£ogbo&quot;, and seldomly as &quot;Oshogbo&quot;) is a city in Nigeria. It became the capital city of Osun State in 1991. Osogbo city seats the Headquarters of both Osogbo Local Government Area (situated at Oke-Baale Area of the city) and Olorunda Local Government Area (situated at Igbonna Area of the city). It is some 88 kilometers by road northeast of Ibadan. It is also by road south of Ilorin (capital and largest city of Kwara State) and northwest of Akure. Osogbo shares boundaries with Ikirun, Ilesa, Ede, Egbedore, Ogbomosho and Iragbiji and it is easily accessible from any part of the state because of its central nature. It is about 48¬†km from Ife, 32¬†km from Ilesa, 46¬†km from Iwo, 48¬†km from Ikire and 46¬†km from Ila-Orangun; the city had a population of about 200,000 people and an approximate land area of 126¬†km. The postal code of the area is 230.

==Infrastructure and demographics==

Osogbo lies on the railway line from Lagos to Kano. It is known for the Osogbo School of Art and the Oja Oba Market building, said to be the former Oba&#x27;s palace, within yards of the Osogbo Grand Mosque.

Osogbo is the trade center for a farming region. Farm produce such as Yams, cassava, grain, and tobacco are grown. Cotton is grown and used to weave cloth. It is also home to several hotels and a football stadium with a capacity of 10,000 and a second division professional league team.

Most of the population are members of the Yoruba ethnic group.
In 1988, about 27% of the population were engaged in farming as their primary occupation, 8% were traders and about 30% clerks and teachers.

== Culture ==
Osogbo, sometimes called &quot;Ilu Aro&quot; (Home of Tie and Dye), is a major dyeing center. The traditional industry is one of the major industries of Osogbo and the different types of Adire in Osogbo includes Raffia Resist-&quot;Adire Oniko&quot;, Stitch Resist-&quot;Adire Alabere&quot;, Starch Resist-&quot;Adire Eleko&quot;, Wax Batik-&quot;Adire Alabele&quot;. A number of industries also began to rise after independence, notably small scale establishments involved in textile, foam making, and pencils. Osogbo was made a major industrial development center by the government of Nigeria during the 1970s. Osogbo is also the childhood home of the actor and dramatist Duro Ladipo and the Muslim scholar Sheikh Adelabu.

Osogbo is the venue of the annual Osun-Osogbo festival along the River Osun. The festival is centered on the sacred grove of the river goddess ·ªåsun, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The city is also home to several progressive groups and associations, such as the Osogbo Descendants Progressive Union (ODPU; formerly Osogbo Progressive Union - OPU), the Mbari Mbayo Club for African writers, artists and musicians, the Osogbo Professionals&#x27; Initiative (OPI), the Osogbo Affairs, the Osogbo Development Action Group (ODAG), the Osogbo National Students&#x27; Union (ONSU), the Oroki Social Club (OSC), the Ataoja Palace Project Initiative (APPI), the United Associates Osogbo and the Igbonna Progressive Club.

== Flooding ==
The citizens of Osogbo, Erin-Osun, and Ilobu, in particular, had no idea what lay in store for them when the heavens opened up for a rainstorm on Tuesday, 3 August 2021.

In contrast to earlier floods in the state, which were preceded by a warning from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, the nearly 8-hour downpour struck like a robber in the night and left tales of grief, tears, and blood by morning. The state capital, Osogbo, was hardest hit, while the damage also spread to numerous other communities. Ibu-Amo, Oke-Arungbo, Oke-Ayepe, Powerline, Gbonmi, Oke-Baale, Obalende, Obate, Oke-Oniti Alekuwodo, and Oke Awesin in Erin-Osun are some of the most impacted localities as Osun River, Awesin stream, and Opopo stream overflow their bounds.

==Climate==
Osogbo has a tropical climate with rainfall and an average annual temperature of 25.5 degrees Celsius (77.8 degrees Fahrenheit) and 1361 Millimetres (53.6 inches) of precipitation.

 Another data indicating Osogbo temperature at 30.28¬†¬∞C (86.5¬†¬∞F) and it is 0.82% higher than Nigeria&#x27;s averages, typically receives about 136.44 millimeters (5.37 inches) of precipitation and has 253.78 rainy days (69.53% of the time) annually.

== Pollution ==

Osogbo the capital City of Osun State has been in celebration mood as a result of the cultural festival held annually in the state with cultural enthusiasts across the globe.

The contamination of the Osun river raises concerns of stakeholders about this year&#x27;s event which made experts to consider this unfit for humans use.

The health implication of consuming water from the river which is said to be having heavy metal and cyanide thereby causing great safety concerns in Osogbo.

== History ==

According to tradition, In Ipole Omu, seven rulers reigned before Olarooye in the following succession: Adefokanbale, Aikanya, Ogbogba, Saso, Luberin, Laege (also known as Adetuturinrin; father to both Lajomo and Larooye), Lajomo and Olarooye.

During the reign of Oba Olarooye at Ipole Omu, life became very unbearable because of incessant dry seasons. The then Ipole people became much dejected, worried and uncomfortable over the losses involving their farms, domestic animals and human beings. The Oba Olarooye was worried and disheartened by the situation at Ipole Omu. He wanted emergency solutions to inevitable and uncountable losses. This was the time he ordered the chief hunter at Ipole-in the person of Timehin-and his co-hunters to go on expedition and look for greener pastures. Timehin and the other hunters courageously took up the challenge and moved out in search of a better place for settlement. This expedition discovered River Osun.

Yoruba tradition claims many people fleeing the Fulani Invasion settled at Osogbo following the fall of old Oyo. As a result, Osogbo increased in population largely due to migration from other Yoruba towns.

For want of a more open place than a grove and a more central location, Olarooye and his people abandoned their settlement, including the already flourishing market and moved to Ode-Osogbo. At Ode-Osogbo, Olarooye built his new palace at the present-day Idi-Osun while Timehin built the Ogun shrine now known as Idi-Ogun.
Since then, Osogbo has maintained its function as an economic center.

<doc id="596830" wikidata="Q1433418" url="?curid=596830" title="List of proper names of stars">
<text>These names of stars that have either been approved by the International Astronomical Union or which have been in somewhat recent use. IAU approval comes mostly from its Working Group on Star Names, which has been publishing a &quot;List of IAU-approved Star Names&quot; since 2016. As of February 2025, the list included a total of 492 proper names of stars.

==Background==
Of the roughly 10,000 stars visible to the naked eye, only a few hundred have been given proper names in the history of astronomy. Traditional astronomy tends to group stars into constellations or asterisms and give proper names to those, not to individual stars.

Many star names are, in origin, descriptive of the part in the constellation they are found in; thus Phecda, a corruption of Arabic (, &#x27;thigh of the bear&#x27;). Only a handful of the brightest stars have individual proper names not depending on their asterism; so Sirius (&#x27;the scorcher&#x27;), Antares (&#x27;rival of Ares&#x27;, i.e., red-hued like Mars), Canopus (of uncertain origin), Alphard (&#x27;the solitary one&#x27;), Regulus (&#x27;kinglet&#x27;); and arguably Aldebaran (&#x27;the follower&#x27; [of the Pleiades]) and Procyon (&#x27;preceding the dog&#x27; [Sirius]). The same holds for Chinese star names, where most stars are enumerated within their asterisms, with a handful of exceptions such as (&#x27;weaving girl&#x27;) (Vega).

In addition to the limited number of traditional star names, there were some coined in modern times, e.g. &quot;Avior&quot; for Epsilon Carinae (1930), and a number of stars named after people (mostly in the 20th century).

==IAU catalog==

In 2016, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin, dated July 2016, included a table of 125 stars comprising the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN (on 30 June and 20 July 2016) together with names of stars adopted by the IAU Executive Committee Working Group on the Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign and recognized by the WGSN. Further batches of names were approved on 21 August, 12 September, 5 October, and 6 November 2016. These were listed in a table of 102 stars included in the WGSN&#x27;s second bulletin, dated November 2016. The next additions were done on 1 February 2017 (13 new star names), 30 June 2017 (29), 5 September 2017 (41), 17 November 2017 (3), 1 June 2018 (17), and on 10 August 2018 (6). All 336 names are included in the current List of IAU-approved Star Names.

In 2019, the IAU organised its IAU 100 NameExoWorlds campaign to name exoplanets and their host stars. The approved names of 112 exoplanets and their host stars were published on 17 December 2019, with an additional pair of names (for the star HAT-P-21 and its planet) approved on 1 March 2020. An additional two star names were approved on 4 April 2022. In June 2023, an additional 20 names were approved in the NameExoWorlds 2022 campaign, bringing the total to 471 named stars.

Since 2024, newly approved names have appeared on the exopla.net website maintainted by the WGSN. , 21 new star names have been approved, bringing the total to 492.

==List==
In the table below, unless indicated by a &quot;‚Ä†&quot;, the &quot;modern proper name&quot; is the name approved by the WGSN and entered in the List of IAU-approved Star Names or otherwise approved by the IAU. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple-star systems.
Names marked with a &quot;‚Ä†&quot; have not been approved by the IAU.

For such names relating to members of multiple-star systems, and where a component letter (from, e.g., the &quot;Washington Double Star Catalog&quot;) is not explicitly listed, the WGSN says that the name should be understood to be attributed to the visually brightest component. In the &quot;Historical names/comments&quot; column, &quot;NameExoWorlds [year]&quot; denotes that the name was approved by the IAU as a consequence of that year&#x27;s NameExoWorlds campaign.

<doc id="596833" wikidata="Q1147069" url="?curid=596833" title="Tully‚ÄìFisher relation">
<text>In astronomy, the Tully‚ÄìFisher relation (TFR) is a widely verified empirical relationship between the mass or intrinsic luminosity of a spiral galaxy and its asymptotic rotation velocity or emission line width. Since the observed brightness of a galaxy is distance-dependent, the relationship can be used to estimate distances to galaxies from measurements of their rotational velocity.

==History==
The connection between rotational velocity measured spectroscopically and distance was first used in 1922 by Ernst √ñpik to estimate the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy. In the 1970s, Balkowski, C., et al. measured 13 galaxies but focused on using the data to distinguish galaxy shapes rather than extract distances.
The relationship was first published in 1977 by astronomers R. Brent Tully and J. Richard Fisher. The luminosity is calculated by multiplying the galaxy&#x27;s apparent brightness by formula_1, where formula_2 is its distance from Earth, and the spectral-line width is measured using long-slit spectroscopy.

A series of collaborative catalogs of galaxy peculiar velocity values called CosmicFlow uses Tully‚ÄìFisher analysis; the Cosmicflow-4 catalog has reached 10000 galaxies. Many values of the Hubble constant have been derived from Tully‚ÄìFisher analysis, starting with the first paper and continuing through 2024.

==Subtypes==

Several different forms of the TFR exist, depending on which precise measures of mass, luminosity or rotation velocity one takes it to relate. Tully and Fisher used optical luminosity, but subsequent work showed the relation to be tighter when defined using microwave to infrared (K band) radiation (a good proxy for stellar mass), and even tighter when luminosity is replaced by the galaxy&#x27;s total stellar mass. The relation in terms of stellar mass is dubbed the &quot;stellar mass Tully Fisher relation&quot; (STFR), and its scatter only shows correlations with the galaxy&#x27;s kinematic morphology, such that more dispersion-supported systems scatter below the relation. The tightest correlation is recovered when considering the total baryonic mass (the sum of its mass in stars and gas). This latter form of the relation is known as the baryonic Tully‚ÄìFisher relation (BTFR), and states that baryonic mass is proportional to velocity to the power of roughly 3.5‚Äì4.

The TFR can be used to estimate the distance to spiral galaxies by allowing the luminosity of a galaxy to be derived from its directly measurable line width. The distance can then be found by comparing the luminosity to the apparent brightness. Thus the TFR constitutes a rung of the cosmic distance ladder, where it is calibrated using more direct distance measurement techniques and used in turn to calibrate methods extending to larger distance.

In the dark matter paradigm, a galaxy&#x27;s rotation velocity (and hence line width) is primarily determined by the mass of the dark matter halo in which it lives, making the TFR a manifestation of the connection between visible and dark matter mass. In Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), the BTFR (with power-law index exactly 4) is a direct consequence of the gravitational force law effective at low acceleration.

The analogues of the TFR for non-rotationally-supported galaxies, such as ellipticals, are known as the Faber‚ÄìJackson relation and the fundamental plane.

<text>Enugu ( ; ) is the capital city of Enugu State in Nigeria. The city had a population of 4,690,100 spread across the three LGAs of Enugu East, Enugu North and Enugu South, according to the 2022 Nigerian census.

==History==

===Early history===

√ânugw√∫ (Igbo verbalization of Enugu) is the capital city of Enugu State in Nigeria. It is located in southeastern part of Nigeria. The name Enugu is derived from the two Igbo words √ân√∫ ·ª§ÃÅgw·ª•ÃÅ, meaning &quot;hill top&quot;, denoting the city&#x27;s hilly geography. Enugu acquired township status in 1917 and was called Enugwu-Ngwo, but because of the rapid expansion towards areas owned by other indigenous communities, the city was renamed Enugu in 1928.

The first settlement in the Enugu area was the small Nike village of Ogui from present day Igala which was present since the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade. &quot;Nike&quot; in the Igbo language means &quot;with strength or power&quot;. The Nike people acquired most of their lands through slave raiding, as the area was mostly unsettled. The Nike people used slaves as part of their defence strategy. They placed Slave camps at the edge of their territories so that it was harder for an enemy to access the free-born people.

The Nike were allied to the Aro people, who formed the Aro Confederacy (1690‚Äì1901). This Igbo organisation controlled slave trading in the Enugu area.

Numerous Aro people came to trade from Arochukwu in the south; the Hausa people came to trade from the north. The Hausa traders provided horses to the Nike, who used them for Igbo rituals. Both the Aro and Hausa regularly migrated back and forth to what is now the city of Enugu, and were considered foreigners to the area.

===Industrialisation===
A British campaign to invade Arochukwu and open up the hinterland for British military and political rule was carried out in 1901. A war between the British and Aro officially started on 1 December 1901; it lasted until 24 March 1902 when the Aro were defeated.

The Aro Confederacy ended, and the British added the rest of Aro-dominated areas to The Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, declared in 1900.

Europeans first arrived in the Enugu area in 1903 when the British/Australian geologist Albert Ernest Kitson led an exploration of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate to search for especially valued mineral resources under the supervision of the Imperial Institute, London. By 1909 they found coal under the village of Enugwu Ngwo in the Udi area. By 1913 the coal was confirmed to be in quantities that would be viable commercially.

By 1914 the colonial government had merged the Northern and Southern Nigeria Protectorate to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria.

In 1915 the British began talks with the indigenous people of the land that would become Enugu about its acquisition in order to lay the Eastern Line railway and to build a colliery. The first houses built in the area were in a temporary settlement consisting of Igbo traditional clay and earthwork housing inhabited by a W. J. Leck and some other Europeans on Hill-top. This was the only plain on the escarpment rolling before the jungled Milliken Hill. Historic former residences of the colonialists, known as the &quot;Europeans quarters&quot;, still survive on the Hill-top. It is now an outskirt of Enugwu-Ngwo town.

As a result of industrialization, settlements sprang up in the area now known as Enugu. The settlement known as &quot;Ugwu Alfred&quot; (Igbo: Alfred&#x27;s Hill) or &quot;Alfred&#x27;s Camp&quot;, was developed on a hillside and inhabited by Alfred Inoma (a leader of indigenous Coal labourers from Onitsha) and his labourers. Another settlement known as Ugwu Aaron (Igbo: Aaron&#x27;s Hill) or &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Camp&quot;, was also developed on a hillside and inhabited by Aaron Nwaelo (a leader of indigenous Railway labourers from Ezeagu) and his labourers.

After the British acquired land here, Frederick Lugard, the Governor-General of Nigeria at the time, named the colliery built at the bottom of the Udi Hills as &quot;Enugu Coal Camp&quot; to distinguish it from Enugwu Ngwo which overlooks the city from atop a scarp to the west of Enugu.

The first coal mine in the Enugu area was the Udi mine; it opened in 1915, and closed two years later when it was replaced with the Iva Valley mine. Enugu became a major coal mining area, the only significant one in West Africa. The Eastern Line railway connecting Enugu with Port Harcourt was completed in 1916 in order to facilitate the export of coal through its seaport and the city was developed sole for this purpose.

Enugu became one of the few cities in West Africa created explicitly from contact with Europeans. By 1916 the colonial government designated parts of Enugu as reserved for Europeans. The area now known as the Government Reserved Area (GRA) was called the European Quarters, located north of the Ogbete River. To the south of the river was a section developed for African residents. The built-up area of Enugu comprised these two areas, and by 1917 the city officially gained township status. On the African side of the city, a rapid influx of migrant workers led to the development of squatter camps on the Udi Hills near the coal mines and the Iva Valley.

In 1929, Enugu became the administrative headquarters for the Southern Province under the post-World War II constitutions. With this, the number of government departments represented in the town increased tremendously. In 1938 Enugu became the administrative capital of the Eastern Region. The number of employed coal miners in Enugu grew from 6,000 (of mostly Udi men) in 1948 to 8,000 in 1958. Enugu&#x27;s population rose sharply with its industrialisation; the population of the city reached 62,000 in 1952. Under colonial British rule, working conditions in Nigeria were harsh, characterized by regular physical punishment, forced acts of humiliation, and irregular payments of arrears owed to workers. In late 1949, local miners believed that large sums of arrears were owed to them, but were being withheld by the mines&#x27; management. These beliefs were fueled by local &quot;Zikist&quot;, or nationalist, press. &quot;Zikism&quot; was a post World War II movement that was created out of admiration for Nnamdi Azikiwe who was a prominent nationalist of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC). Labour tensions in Enugu came to a head on 18 November 1949, when British police massacred striking miners, killing 21 and wounding 51 others. The massacre that came to be known as &quot;The Iva Valley Shooting&quot; fueled Zikist sentiments among most Nigerians, and especially amongst Eastern Nigerians. Multiple Zikist groups used the shooting to fuel their calls for independence, and to push the British imperial administration out of Nigeria. A detailed account of the incident was also published in the memoirs of the British Resident of Enugu at the time, James Stewart Smith.

===Independence, war, and after===

Enugu became a municipality in 1956 with Umaru Altine its first mayor. After four years passed, Nigeria gained its independence in 1960. On 27 May 1967 the Nigerian government divided the Western, Northern and Eastern Region into 12 states and Enugu was made the capital of the new East Central State. On 30 May 1967 Enugu was declared the capital of the short-lived Republic of Biafra, the latter created out of the eastern Nigerian states of East Central, Cross River and Rivers. Biafra was declared by Ojukwu because of Eastern Nigeria after their members were attacked injured and killed in a series of ethnic attacks launched by some other ethnic groups in other parts of the country following the first military coup executed by mostly Igbo Officers, in which top northern Nigerian leaders among others were assassinated. The main rivals of the mostly Igbo Eastern Nigerians were the Hausa/Fulani people of Northern Nigeria. A northern headed war on the secession (1967‚Äî1970) and continuous attacks on the Igbos in other part of Nigeria lead Igbos from northern and western Nigeria to return to their &quot;native&quot; areas in eastern Nigeria and Enugu became a destination. Radio Biafra, alternatively the Voice of Biafra (formerly the Eastern Nigerian Broadcasting Service), was based in Enugu; it was from here that the Biafran leader, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, broadcast speeches and propaganda to Biafrans and Nigeria. Because of the war, Enugu witnessed a decrease in the number of non-Igbo, specifically non-eastern Nigerian residents. On 4 October 1967 the Nigerian military bombarded Enugu with artillery just outside its boundaries before capturing it a week later, shortly after this Umuahia became the new capital of the republic. Years after the Republic of Biafra reverted to Nigeria, Enugu is still regarded as the &quot;Capital of Igboland&quot;.

Enugu resumed in 1970 as the capital of the East Central State after the republic was dissolved. On 3 February 1976 the East Central State was made into two new states, Imo and Anambra; there were then 19 states in Nigeria; Enugu was the capital of Anambra. On 27 August 1991 the military dictatorship of Ibrahim Babangida divided the old Anambra State into two new states, Enugu State and Anambra State. Enugu remained as the capital of the newly created Enugu State, while Awka became the capital of the new Anambra State.

==Geography==
===Topography===

Despite its name meaning &quot;hill top&quot; in the Igbo language, Enugu lies at the foot of an escarpment and not a hill. Enugu is located in the Cross River basin and the Benue trough and has the best developed coal in this area. Precambrian basement rock in this region is overlaid with sediments bearing coal from the Cretaceous and Tertiary age. Coal seams in the Enugu coal district measure between in thickness and the reserves have been estimated to be more than 300 million tones. Enugu&#x27;s hills at the extreme may reach an elevation of . Highlands surrounding Enugu for the most part are underlain by sandstone, while lowlands are underlain by shale. Much of the escarpment stretching from Enugu to Orlu has been ravaged by soil and gully erosion. Other geological features in Enugu include the Nike Lake near which the Nike Lake Resort has been built. The Ekulu, Asata, Ogbete, Aria, Idaw and Nyaba rivers are the six largest rivers located in the city. The Ekulu River is the largest body of water in Enugu urban and its reservoir contributes to part of the city&#x27;s domestic water supply.

=== Water ===
Access to water has historically been a significant challenge in Enugu. Drilling of borehole in the city is usually an exercise in futility because of the geological formation which has coal large deposits of coal underground. The residents got water by buying from commercial water tanker drivers, digging water wells and harvesting and storing rain water. The Enugu State Water Corporation was established in 1991 to address these challenges and is responsible for providing portable water to the urban population of Enugu State. The corporation&#x27;s primary focus is on serving residents in Enugu Urban and Nsukka Urban, covering areas of 85 square kilometers and 30 square kilometers, respectively. Water production schemes in Enugu State are: Iva Valley Headworks designed to produce 4,500 cubic meter per day, Ajalli Owa Scheme with installed capacity of 77,000 cubic meter per day, Oji Augmentation Scheme that produces 50,000 cubic meter per day and Nsukka Scheme producing 19,000 cubic meter per day. Enugu&#x27;s water supply infrastructure has not kept pace with its growing population. However, in 2021 the Enugu State government received $50million from French Development Agency, AFD, to support the state to revitalize the water schemes at 9th Mile Corner Nsude and Oji River. The Peter Mbah administration in November 2023 using the funds completed the water scheme at 9th Mile Corner Nsude, increasing the daily water production from an occasional 2 million liters to 70 million liters, with the Oji River water scheme expected to add another 50 million liters daily, bringing the total to 120 million liters daily. Reticulation of water to the various buildings remains a challenge, though being continuously addressed by the administration, as aged asbestos pipes are being replaced with modern ductile pipes.

===Climate===
Enugu is located in a tropical rain forest zone with a derived savannah. The city has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen: &quot;Aw&quot;). Enugu&#x27;s climate is humid, and this humidity is at its highest between March and November. For the whole of Enugu State the mean daily temperature is . As in the rest of West Africa, the rainy season and dry season are the only weather periods that recur in Enugu. The average annual rainfall in Enugu is around , which arrives intermittently and becomes very heavy during the rainy season. Other weather conditions affecting the city include Harmattan, a dusty trade wind lasting a few weeks of December and January. Like the rest of Nigeria, Enugu is hot all year round.

===Cityscape and architecture===
The tallest building in Enugu&#x27;s Central Business District (CBD) is the African Continental Bank (ACB) tower with six stories. The tower was built in the late 50s for the African Continental Bank Limited which was founded by Nnamdi Azikiwe who became the first president of Nigeria after the country&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom in October 1960. The opening of the building took place on 30 April 1959. Other tall buildings include the Hotel Presidential opened in August 1963. The seven-story building contains 100 rooms and is located in the Independence Layout. Hotel Presidential cost $2.5 million to build and was commissioned by the government of what was then the Eastern Region to serve visiting businessmen, officials and tourists. In the middle of Enugu is the Michael Okpara Square, dedicated to the premier of the former Eastern Region Michael Okpara. Beside the square is located the Enugu State Government House, Enugu State House of Assembly and Enugu State Judiciary Complex.

Enugu&#x27;s coal mines are dotted around on the outskirts of the city, a majority of which are closed. The Colliery Camp mines are located in the Iva Valley which is near the neighboring town of Ngwo and the Hilltop of Enugu. The Iva Valley coal mine is accessed through the Iva Valley road linking Enugu with Ngwo. Other coal mines are located in the Ogbete and Coal Camp layouts; these mines are located on the periphery of the city near the Iva Valley as well.

Architectural design in Enugu&#x27;s early years was in the hands of the British colonial administration; Enugu&#x27;s architecture was consequently very European. English cottage housing and Victorian houses were used for housing Europeans and Nigerian colonial civil servants in the early 20th¬† century until Europeans started trying to adapt their architecture to the tropical climate. Some other examples of these European styles are visible in churches of the colonial era, such as the Holy Ghost Cathedral with its Greco-Roman stained glass windows depicting Europeans. Enugu&#x27;s roads were reflective of its British rule; much of the city&#x27;s narrow roads in the GRA have been preserved dating back to the incorporation of the city itself. Low rent one bedroom flats in Enugu and other Nigerian cities are known as &quot;face-me-I-face-you&quot; for the way a group of flats face each other and form a square where a compound entrance is led into.

==Government==

Enugu city covers three local government areas: Enugu East, Enugu North and Enugu South. A Local Government Council exists for each of these seats that manages sectors including primary education and health; an elected Executive Chairman and a group of elected Councilors form the Local Government Council that heads each Local Government Area. Enugu South is split between its rural and urban parts when electing an Executive Chairman. The Executive Chairmen include Paul Ogbe for Enugu South Urban, Theresa Egbo for Enugu South Rural, Emma Onoh for Enugu North, and Christopher Ugwu for Enugu East; these chairmen represent their LGA&#x27;s in the Enugu State House of Assembly. The Ministry of Lands, Survey and Town Planning (at the state level) and the Local Planning Authority (at the local government level) are responsible for the administration of urban lands and town planning. Government House, Enugu is where the government of the state is based. On the federal level, the city of Enugu is split between two congressional areas; Enugu North/South represented by Chukwuegbo Ofor and Enugu East represented by Gilbert Nnaji; both representatives are in the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP) as his excellency Peter Mbah ]], the governor of Enugu State.

==Demographics==


According to the 2006 Nigerian census, the Enugu metropolitan area has an estimated population of 722,664. This estimate along with population estimates of other Nigerian cities have been disputed with accusations of population inflation and deflation in favour of the northern part of the country. The population of Enugu is predominantly Christian, as is the rest of southeastern Nigeria. Like the rest of Nigeria, most people in Enugu speak Nigerian English in addition to the dominant indigenous language of the area ‚Äî in the case of Enugu, the dominant language is Igbo with minority groups speaking their own languages along with English and (often) Igbo. Along with standard Nigerian English, Pidgin English is commonly spoken, with the forms of English often being employed lingua francas to communicate across ethnic lines or even between speakers of disparate Igbo dialects. In cultural and linguistic terms, Enugu is within the northern cluster of the Igbo region which includes other communities like Agbani, Awka, Owo, Nike, and Nsukka.

As the city is within the broader cultural region of Igboland, the population of Enugu has historically been predominantly Igbo, with the ethnic composition reflecting the region&#x27;s demographics. Early records, such as the 1929 census, indicated that the vast majority of Enugu&#x27;s population were originally from the Eastern Region, with the ethnic Igbo community alone constituting 85% of the population. Other ethnic groups ‚Äî such as the Hausa, Yoruba, and Fulani ethnic groups along with smaller groups from the Middle Belt and Niger Delta ‚Äî also settled in the city with 10% of the population originating from the Western Region and 2% originating from the Northern Region while another 2% came from non-Igbo eastern communities in 1929. By the 1953 census, the Igbo community remained the vast majority at 87% of the population; however, various Igbo subgroups inhabited different parts of Enugu as of the mid-twentieth century including the Enugwu-Ngwo people (residing on the Hill-Top plain near the Milliken Hills on the west, with farmlands extending into the valleys), the Awkunanaw people (living in the Achara Layout and Uwani areas), and the Ogui Nike people (inhabited areas around Hotel Presidential as well as areas such as Obiagu, Ama-Igbo, Ihewuzi, and Onu-Asata) and other Nike groups (settled in regions like Abakpa, Iji-Nike, and Emene). However, decades of urban sprawl and migration ‚Äî both internal movement within the city and the influx of new residents ‚Äî have significantly altered these demographic patterns over time. While a large portion of the non-native groups of Enugu are ethnic Igbo migrants from other parts of the South East, the city&#x27;s ethnic diversity increased in the mid-twentieth century with migration from other groups, but the civil war significantly shifted demographic patterns. Post-war Enugu saw a higher concentration of Igbo residents, as many inhabitants from other ethnic groups either left or were deterred from settling in the city due to the war&#x27;s lingering effects on ethnic relations. Despite the challenges posed by ethnic diversity, Enugu has maintained a reputation for relatively peaceful coexistence among its various groups. Inter-ethnic relations have generally been harmonious, with residents working to manage tensions. Stereotyping and occasional conflicts have arisen, but they were often resolved through dialogue and community efforts. Relevant authorities also facilitate cooperation between Igbo and non-indigene communities while shared festivals, intermarriage, and religious commonalities ‚Äî particularly among Hausa, Fulani, and Yoruba Muslims ‚Äî contribute to this environment.

===Crime===
Enugu&#x27;s crime rate rose in 2009 as kidnapping and armed robbery rates increased in southeastern Nigeria specifically between September and December. The Enugu State government sought to check the high kidnapping rates by passing a bill in February 2009 that made kidnapping by the use of a weapon a capital offence; the bill was passed by the Enugu House of Assembly unanimously. 1,088 arrests were made in the city between September and December 2009; 270 of these were in September, 303 were in October, 295 in November and 220 were in December. 477 of these detainees were accused of committing capital offences which included kidnapping. The motives of kidnappers in Enugu are primarily financial and some ransoms went into the millions of Naira. The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor of Enugu State, Dan Nwomeh, had his ransom set as high as ‚Ç¶500 million (3.3 million US Dollars ), dropping to ‚Ç¶200 million and then ‚Ç¶50 million before he was released without a ransom being paid because of the refusal of the government to negotiate with the kidnappers. Much of the crime in Enugu and the rest of Nigeria has been attributed to unemployment.

==Economy==

Nicknamed the &quot;Coal City&quot;, Enugu&#x27;s economy in the early 20th¬†century depended on coal mining in the Udi plateau; this industry was the pushing force towards the city&#x27;s growth. The Nigerian Coal Corporation has been based in Enugu since its creation in 1950 where it controlled coal mining. With the creation of the Eastern Line, Enugu was connected with the sea via Port Harcourt to its south and later connected to the city of Kaduna to Enugu&#x27;s north. The Nigerian Civil War brought widespread devastation that forced a decline in coal production from damage or destruction of equipment. coal mining is no longer the major source of income and mines lay unused. Other minerals mined in Enugu include iron ore, limestone, fine clay, marble, and silica sand.

In Enugu most goods are sold in open markets or by street hawkers; a significant number of street hawkers in Nigeria are children. , around 44 under-16-year-olds (equally boys and girls) hawk on every street on every hour in Enugu. There are three main urban markets in Enugu: Ogbete Market, Awkunanaw Market and New Market. New Market is a major market for the sale of garri. Ogbete market is patronised by merchants from all over the surrounding area, including merchants from cities like Onitsha, Aguleri, Abakaliki and Aba. In Ogebete market non-food goods are also sold. Brewing and soft-drink bottling are among other industries in the city; there is also a Mercedes assembly plant as well as the production and manufacturing of machinery, pottery, tiles, steel, cement, asbestos, petroleum, and pharmaceuticals. For a period of time Sosoliso Airlines had its head office on the grounds of Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu.

The former Eastern Region was once famed for producing half the world&#x27;s total output of palm kernels. Since the Nigerian Civil War production has markedly declined largely because the plantations and processing equipment were either damaged or destroyed. The production of other important cash crops such as cocoa, groundnut and groundnut oil, rubber, cassava, cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled after the civil war and the subsequent oil boom years. Consequently, the area called Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, which was once a self-sufficient net exporter in agricultural produce, must import food.

Born out of a passion for innovation and progress, the city has given rise to numerous successful businesses across various sectors.

<text>Major Barbara is a three-act English play by George Bernard Shaw, written and premiered in 1905 and first published in 1907. The story concerns an idealistic young woman, Barbara Undershaft, who is engaged in helping the poor as a Major in the Salvation Army in London. For many years, Barbara and her siblings have been estranged from their father, Andrew Undershaft, who now reappears as a rich and successful munitions maker. The father gives money to the Salvation Army, which offends Barbara because she considers it &quot;tainted&quot; wealth. The father argues that poverty is a worse problem than munitions and claims that he is doing more to help society by giving his workers jobs and a steady income than she is doing by giving people free meals in a soup kitchen.

The play script displays typical Shavian techniques in the omission of apostrophes from contractions and other punctuation, the inclusion of a didactic introductory essay explaining the play&#x27;s themes, and the phonetic spelling of dialect English, as when Bill Walker jeers, &quot;Wot prawce selvytion nah?&quot; (What price salvation now?).

==Setting==
*London
*Act I: Lady Britomart&#x27;s house in Wilton Crescent
*Act II: The Salvation Army shelter in West Ham
*Act III: Lady Britomart&#x27;s house, later at the Undershaft munitions works in Perivale St. Andrews

==Synopsis==
An officer of The Salvation Army, Major Barbara Undershaft, becomes disillusioned when her Christian denomination accepts money from an armaments manufacturer (her father) and a whisky distiller. She eventually decides that bringing a message of salvation to people who have plenty will be more fulfilling and genuine than converting the starving in return for bread.

Although Barbara initially regards the Salvation Army&#x27;s acceptance of Undershaft&#x27;s money as hypocrisy, Shaw did not intend that it should be thought so by the audience. Shaw wrote a preface for the play&#x27;s publication, in which he derided the idea that charities should only take money from &quot;morally pure&quot; sources, arguing that using money to benefit the poor will have more practical benefit than ethical niceties. He points out that donations can always be used for good whatever their provenance, and he quotes a Salvation Army officer, &quot;they would take money from the devil himself and be only too glad to get it out of his hands and into God&#x27;s.&quot;

==Plot==

Lady Britomart Undershaft, the daughter of a British earl, and her son Stephen discuss a source of income for her grown daughters Sarah, who is engaged to Charles Lomax (a slightly comic figure who continually stupidly says &quot;Oh, I say!&quot;), and Barbara, who is engaged to Adolphus Cusins (a scholar of Greek literature). Lady Britomart leads Stephen to accept her decision that they must ask her estranged husband, Andrew Undershaft, for financial help. Mr. Undershaft is a successful and wealthy businessman who has made millions of pounds from his munitions factory, which manufactures the world-famous Undershaft guns, cannons, torpedoes, submarines and aerial battleships.

When their children were still small, the Undershafts separated; now grown, the children have not seen their father since, and Lady Britomart has raised them by herself. During their reunion, Undershaft learns that Barbara is a major in The Salvation Army who works at their shelter in West Ham, east London. Barbara and Mr. Undershaft agree that he will visit Barbara&#x27;s Army shelter, if she will then visit his munitions factory.

A subplot involves the down-and-out and fractious visitors to the shelter, including a layabout painter and con artist (Snobby Price), a poor housewife feigning to be a fallen woman (Rummy Mitchens), an older laborer fired for his age (Peter Shirley), and a pugnacious bully (Bill Walker) who threatens the inhabitants and staff over his runaway partner, striking a frightened care worker (Jenny Hill).

When he visits the shelter, Mr. Undershaft is impressed with Barbara&#x27;s handling of these various troublesome people who seek social services from the Salvation Army: she treats them with patience, firmness, and sincerity. Undershaft and Cusins discuss the question of Barbara&#x27;s commitment to The Salvation Army, and Undershaft decides he must overcome Barbara&#x27;s moral horror of his occupation. He declares that he will therefore &quot;buy&quot; (off) the Salvation Army. He makes a sizeable donation, matching another donation from a whisky distiller. Barbara wants the Salvation Army to refuse the money because it comes from the armaments and alcohol industries, but her supervising officer eagerly accepts it. Barbara sadly leaves the shelter in disillusionment, while Cusins views Undershaft&#x27;s actions both with disgust and sarcastic pleasure.

According to tradition, the heir to the Undershaft fortune must be an orphan who can be groomed to run the factory. Lady Britomart tries to convince Undershaft to bequeath the business to his son Stephen, but neither man consents. Undershaft says that the best way to keep the factory in the family is to find a foundling and marry him to Barbara. Later, Barbara and the rest of her family accompany her father to his munitions factory. They are all impressed by its size and organisation. Cusins declares that he is a foundling, and is thus eligible to inherit the business. Undershaft eventually overcomes Cusins&#x27; moral scruples about the nature of the business, arguing that paying his employees provides a much higher service to them than Barbara&#x27;s Army service, which only prolongs their poverty; as an example, the firm has hired Peter. Cusins&#x27; gradual acceptance of Undershaft&#x27;s logic makes Barbara more content to marry him, not less, because bringing a message of salvation to the factory workers, rather than to London slum-dwellers, will bring her more fulfilment.

==Production history==
The play was first produced at the Court Theatre in London in 1905 by J.E. Vedrenne and Harley Granville-Barker. Barker also played Cusins, alongside Louis Calvert, Clare Greet, Edmund Gwenn, Oswald Yorke and Annie Russell. The Broadway premiere in the United States was at the Playhouse Theatre on 9 December 1915.

A film adaptation of 1941 was produced by Gabriel Pascal, and starred Wendy Hiller as Barbara, Rex Harrison as Cusins and Robert Morley as Undershaft.

A Broadway production in 1956 with Charles Laughton and Burgess Meredith is noted in the discussion following Laughton&#x27;s guest appearance on What&#x27;s My Line on 25 November 1956. Meredith was on the panel.

Caedmon Records released a 4-LP recording of the play in 1965 (TRS 319 S) directed by Howard Sackler with Warren Mitchell as Bill Walker, Maggie Smith as Barbara, Alec McCowen as Cusins, Celia Johnson as Lady Britomart and Robert Morley as Undershaft.

A TV movie production was broadcast in 1966 with Eileen Atkins as Barbara, Douglas Wilmer as Undershaft and Daniel Massey as Cusins.

The play has been produced a number of times for BBC Radio:
* 1955, BBC Light Programme with Irene Worth as Barbara, Anthony Jacobs as Cusins and Frank Pettingell as Undershaft
* 1962, BBC Third Programme with Joyce Redman, Esme Percy and Eliot Makeham
* 1961, BBC Third Programme with June Tobin as Barbara, Richard Hurndall as Cusins and Malcolm Keen as Undershaft
* 1967, BBC Home Service with Dorothy Tutin as Barbara, Alec McCowen as Cusins and Max Adrian as Undershaft
* 1980, BBC Radio 4 with Anna Massey as Barbara, Jeremy Clyde as Cusins and John Phillips as Undershaft
* 1998, BBC Radio 3 with Jemma Redgrave as Barbara, David Yelland as Cusins and Peter Bowles as Undershaft
* 2015, BBC Radio 4 in 2 episodes with Eleanor Tomlinson as Barbara, Jack Farthing as Cusins and Matthew Marsh as Undershaft

==Background==
Lady Britomart Undershaft was modelled on Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle, the mother-in-law of Gilbert Murray, who with his wife Lady Mary served as inspiration for Adolphus Cusins and Barbara Undershaft.

Andrew Undershaft was loosely inspired by a number of figures, including the arms dealer Basil Zaharoff, and German armaments family Krupp. Undershaft&#x27;s unscrupulous sale of weapons to any and all bidders, as well as his government influence and more pertinently his company&#x27;s method of succession (to a foundling rather than a son), tie him especially to Krupp steel. Friedrich Alfred Krupp died by suicide in 1902 following publication of claims he was a homosexual. His two daughters were his heirs. Undershaft shares a name with a Church of England church in the City of London named St Andrew Undershaft; given the district&#x27;s longstanding status as the financial centre of London, the association underscores the play&#x27;s thematic emphasis on the interpenetration of religion and economics, of faith and capital.

==Analysis==
Sidney P. Albert, a noted Shaw scholar, analysed various aspects of the play in several articles. These include first, Shaw&#x27;s own account of the writing of the play; second, the chosen time of the play&#x27;s setting, January 1906, and third, references to the Lord&#x27;s Prayer

Several scholars have compared this work to other works, including one of Shaw&#x27;s own, and others from different periods. Fiona Macintosh has examined Shaw&#x27;s use of classical literary sources, such as &quot;The Bacchae&quot;, in &quot;Major Barbara&quot;. In his discussion of the play, Robert J Jordan has analysed the relationship between &quot;Major Barbara&quot; and another Shaw play, &quot;Man and Superman&quot;. Joseph Frank has examined parallels between the play and the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; of Dante. J.L. Wiesenthal has discussed parallels with the play and Shaw&#x27;s personal interpretations of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;.

Many studies have looked at main character Undershaft&#x27;s beliefs and morals from several points of view, including their relation to Shaw&#x27;s personal beliefs; their presentation throughout the play, and their changes over the course of the play; the counterpoints to them by Adolphus Cusins, and their relation to the social realities of the day. First, Charles Berst has studied the convictions of Andrew Undershaft in the play, and compared them with Shaw&#x27;s own philosophical ideas. Robert Everding has discussed the gradual presentation of the ideas and character of Andrew Undershaft as the play progresses. The pseudonymous commentator &#x27;Ozy&#x27; has compared Andrew Undershaft&#x27;s apparent undermining of Shaw&#x27;s own personal, general convictions about the &#x27;Life Force&#x27;, and Shaw&#x27;s attempt to have Adolphus Cusins restore some philosophical balance. Norma Nutter has briefly discussed conflicts between the character&#x27;s personal convictions compared to the social realities that they eventually face, via the concept of &#x27;false consciousness&#x27;.

Relatedly, several others have looked at the play in relation to the circumstances of the period in which it was written. Bernard Dukore has examined the historical context of the depiction of money in the play, relating the then-contemporary situation with inflation to more recent historical circumstances. Nicholas Williams has discussed possibilities for reinterpretation of the play in a more contemporary context, away from the immediate historical context of its original period.

<text>The hanky panky is a cocktail made from gin, sweet vermouth, and Fernet-Branca. It is a variation on the sweet martini, or Martinez, made distinctive by the Fernet-Branca, a bitter Italian digestivo. It was created by Ada &quot;Coley&quot; Coleman, head bartender at the Savoy Hotel, London.

==Recipe==
A recipe for the cocktail was included in Harry Craddock&#x27;s &quot;The Savoy Cocktail Book&quot;.
:&quot;In a cocktail shaker over ice pour:&quot;
* ( oz) Italian vermouth
* ( oz) dry gin
*2 dashes Fernet-Branca
:&quot;Stir&quot;
:&quot;Strain into a (4 oz.) cocktail glass.&quot; 
:&quot;Garnish by squeezing an orange peel over the top.&quot;

==History==
The hanky panky was the brainchild of Ada Coleman (known as &quot;Coley&quot;) who began as a bartender at the Savoy Hotel in 1903. Her benefactor was Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte, a member of the family that first produced Gilbert and Sullivan operas in London and that built the Savoy Hotel. When Rupert became chairman of the Savoy, Ada was given a position at the hotel&#x27;s American Bar, where she eventually became the head bartender and made cocktails for the likes of Mark Twain, the Prince of Wales, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden, and Sir Charles Hawtrey.

Coleman created the hanky panky for Hawtrey. He was a Victorian and Edwardian actor who mentored No√´l Coward. Coleman told the story behind the creation of the hanky panky to England&#x27;s &quot;The People&quot; newspaper in 1925:

The late Charles Hawtrey¬†... was one of the best judges of cocktails that I knew. Some years ago, when he was overworking, he used to come into the bar and say, &quot;Coley, I am tired. Give me something with a bit of punch in it.&quot; It was for him that I spent hours experimenting until I had invented a new cocktail. The next time he came in, I told him I had a new drink for him. He sipped it, and, draining the glass, he said, &quot;By Jove! That is the real hanky-panky!&quot;, And Hanky-Panky it has been called ever since.

The hanky panky is a variation on the sweet martini, inasmuch as it calls for gin and sweet vermouth, but Coley&#x27;s secret ingredient that made the drink distinctive was Fernet-Branca, a bitter Italian digestivo.

<text>&quot;Deor&quot; (or &quot;The Lament of Deor&quot;) is an Old English poem found on folio 100r‚Äì100v of the late-10th-century collection the Exeter Book. The poem consists of a reflection on misfortune by a poet whom the poem is usually thought to name Deor. The poem has no title in the Exeter Book itself; the title has been bestowed by modern editors.

In the poem, Deor&#x27;s lord has replaced him with another poet. Deor mentions various figures from Germanic tradition and reconciles his own troubles with the troubles these figures faced, ending each section with the refrain &quot;that passed away, so may this.&quot;

The poem comprises forty-two alliterative lines.

==Genre==
Placing this poem within a genre has proven to be quite difficult. Some commentators attempting to characterise the work have called it an &quot;ubi sunt&quot; (&quot;where are they?&quot;) poem because of its meditations on . It can also be considered a traditional lament and poem of consolation. Christian consolation poems, however, usually attempt to subsume personal miseries in a historical or explicitly metaphysical context (e.g., Boethius&#x27;s &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot;), and such perspectives are somewhat remote from the tradition of Anglo-Saxon poetry. Medievalist scholars who have viewed the poem within the Anglo-Saxon tradition have therefore seen it primarily as a begging poem‚Äîa poem written by a travelling and begging poet who is without a place at a noble court‚Äîalthough because few other begging poems survive, assigning it to such a genre is somewhat speculative. Others have related &quot;Deor&quot; to other melancholy poems in the Exeter Book, such as &quot;The Seafarer&quot; and &quot;The Wanderer&quot;. Richard North has argued that the poem was written in about 856 as a satire on King √Üthelwulf of Wessex.

John Miles Foley has hypothesized that the apparent murkiness of &quot;Deor&quot; is also in no small part attributable to the obscurity of the poet&#x27;s references. As he puts it, &quot;Cut off from its traditional background, &#x27;Deor&#x27; makes little sense&quot;. Because the poem is not entirely translatable into modern English‚Äîthe third and fourth stanzas remain indeterminate to this day, and even the refrain prompts argument and poses linguistic difficulties‚Äîwithout grasping the allusions of the poem, it is quite difficult to understand the poet&#x27;s implied attitude, and therefore to place it in &quot;any&quot; genre satisfactorily. Further, given the mass loss of Anglo-Saxon literature, it is possible that constraining the poem to an existing genre is artificial, for the poem may represent yet another, otherwise unattested genre, or it might well stand alone outside of generic rules.

==Summary==

&quot;Deor&quot; is a lament in the voice of a poet exiled from his former life of luxury, respect, and popularity. He compares his current predicament to the predicaments of figures from stories traditional in medieval Germanic-speaking culture.

The first twenty-seven lines of the poem present five vignettes, alluding to traditional stories and separated by a refrain (for which there is no close parallel elsewhere in Old English poetry) which says &quot;&quot; (usually translated &quot;that passed over, so may this&quot;). Although the precise significance of this refrain is debated, it clearly indicates that the misfortunes described in each vignette were eventually overcome. Four of the five vignettes mention characters well known from stories associated with Theodoric the Great, but it is unclear what the other is alluding to. Partly for this reason, many scholars have assumed that there is no narrative thread running through the poem. Recent work has, however, argued that the vignettes imply a narrative sequence connected with Theodoric; in particular, Jennifer Lorden has argued that the vignettes trace the career of Widia as most clearly attested in the Old Norse &quot;√ûi√∞reks saga&quot;.

The first vignette presents the travails of the legendary smith Weland caused by his enslavement by the king Ni√∞had.

The second turns to the difficulties experienced by Ni√∞had&#x27;s daughter Beadohilde, implicitly when Weland takes revenge on her father by murdering her brothers and getting her pregnant.

The text of the third vignette is ungrammatical and its meaning uncertain. In the 1930s, Kemp Malone influentially proposed that it talks about characters called Geat and Maethild, and that their story is the same as that told in the much later Scandinavian ballad known as the Power of the Harp. Variants of this ballad from all the Scandinavian nations are known, and in some of these variants the names of the protagonists are Gauti and Magnhild. Numerous other interpretations exist, including that the vignette is part of a well integrated narrative sequence and concerns Ni√∞had.

The fourth vignette presents the thirty-year reign of Theodoric the Great. A possible connection between this and the preceding sections is that the Old English poem &quot;Waldere&quot;, as well as German and Old Norse analogues, have Widia, the son of Weland and Beaduhild, as one of Theodoric&#x27;s foremost retainers.

The fifth vignette comments on the miseries inflicted by Ermanaric of the Goths, implicitly following his usurpation of Theodoric&#x27;s power as recounted in legendary Germanic-language stories. In Lorden&#x27;s argument, these events too are ones which centrally feature Widia.

The remainder of the poem (lines 28‚Äì42) turn to the narrator&#x27;s own sorrow at having lost his position of privilege. At the poem&#x27;s conclusion, we learn that this person (who, depending on the interpretation of the Old English, may be called Deor) reveals that he was once a great poet among the Heodenings, until he was displaced and sent wandering by Heorrenda, a more skillful poet. Once more, it is clear that the poem alludes to stories attested more widely in the medieval Germanic-speaking world. According to Norse mythology, the Heodenings (&quot;Hja√∞ningar&quot;) were involved in the never-ending &quot;battle of the Heodenings&quot;, the Hja√∞ningav√≠g. Heorrenda (Hjarrandi) was also one of the names of the god Odin.

==Literary influence==
&quot;Deor&quot; had a profound influence on J. R. R. Tolkien, the refrain in particular‚Äîwhich he himself translated as &quot;Time has passed since then, this too can pass&quot;‚Äîdecline and fall in Middle-earth being, according to Tom Shippey, a central theme of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

<text>Shadoe Stevens (born Terry Ingstad; November 3, 1946) is an American radio host, voiceover actor, and television personality. He was the host of &quot;American Top 40&quot; from 1988 to 1995. He currently hosts the internationally syndicated radio show &quot;Top of the World,&quot; and co-hosts &quot;Mental Radio,&quot; an approach to UFOs and paranormal topics. He was co-founder and creator of Sammy Hagar&#x27;s rock station &quot;Cabo Wabo Radio&quot; which broadcast from the Cabo Wabo Cantina in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. In television, he was the announcer for &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; on CBS and, as of July 2015, serves as the primary continuity announcer for the Antenna TV network. His voice can also be heard as the voiceover for &quot;G.O.D.&quot; in the Off-Broadway musical &quot;Altar Boyz&quot;. Stevens is also often heard on &quot;Hits &amp; Favorites&quot;, calling in at least once a week to share wisdom with his brother Richard Stevens and their friend Lori St. James.

== Early life ==
Stevens was born in Jamestown, North Dakota. He first came to fame in 1957 when a &quot;Life&quot; magazine article about him, entitled &quot;America&#x27;s Youngest D.J.&quot;, featured a photo of Stevens broadcasting live over radio station KEYJ (now called KQDJ) in his hometown of Jamestown. The accompanying article extolled the fact that he had built his own working transmitter in the attic of his home the year before, using a &quot;souped-up&quot; wireless broadcasting kit with a hundred-foot antenna. It omitted, however, the additional information that the equipment and advice needed to build the transmitter had both been furnished by the staff engineers at KEYJ, which was owned by his father and uncle; his family continues to own many radio stations in North Dakota to this day, under the Ingstad Family Media group. He was later &quot;discovered&quot; in a &quot;man on the street&quot; interview by the station and was soon broadcasting a weekly rock show called &quot;Spin with Terry&quot;. During his high school years, he obtained a full-time shift at the station as a host of the &quot;Mister Midnight&quot; program, where he developed his now-famous &quot;slow &#x27;n low&quot; style of speaking.

== College and early career ==
Stevens attended and graduated from the University of North Dakota, where he was a member of Sigma Nu fraternity. Majoring in Commercial Art and Radio/TV Journalism at the University of North Dakota and the University of Arizona, Stevens put himself through college working in radio at KILO in Grand Forks, North Dakota; KQWB in Fargo, North Dakota; and KIKX in Tucson, Arizona, where he quickly became the most popular DJ in town, under the on-air persona of &quot;Jefferson K.&quot; Following college, he joined the Bill Drake-formatted station WRKO in Boston during the winter of 1968‚Äì69. At WRKO, he worked the early evening (6‚Äì9 p.m.) shift during the station&#x27;s peak in popularity. In the spring of 1970, he moved to Southern California to another Drake outlet, KHJ, as one of the last true &quot;Boss Jocks&quot;, where his big baritone and energetic enthusiasm soon gained a following. Before long, he gained significant popularity on radio and became the announcer and sidekick on the nationally syndicated television series &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;.

Stevens later went on to become a radio personality and program director at KRLA in Los Angeles. Attaining status as a programmer, he was hired to make a success of KMET-FM and then to create the programming for a new radio format on a new Los Angeles station, KROQ-FM (&quot;K-Rock&quot;), where he remained for five years.

== 1970s and the rise to fame ==
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stevens gained an additional cult following when he created and produced &quot;Fred R. Rated for Federated&quot;, a long-running series of offbeat television commercials for the Federated Group, a chain of home electronics retailers in the western and southwestern United States. These ads were so popular that they were the subject of a two-page spread in &quot;Time Magazine&quot; and led to a movie deal, television shows, and &quot;American Top 40&quot;. From 1978-1979, Stevens served as the off-camera announcer on the syndicated Disco music television show &quot;Hot City&quot;.

In 1984, Stevens entered an inpatient treatment facility to overcome his longtime drug addiction.

== Acting career ==
Stevens acted for the first time when he was coerced into auditioning for Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;After the Fall&quot; at the University of Arizona. He not only won a role, he got the demanding lead of Quentin, who is virtually never off the stage. One local reviewer said, the young performer &quot;commanded the stage with a commanding voice.&quot;
He contributed several deadpan readings of absurd material for &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; and then gained national recognition as the announcer for two incarnations of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; (the 1986‚Äì1989 and the first 4 seasons of the 1998‚Äì2004 version), appearing in the middle square of the bottom row and guest hosting for a week during the final season of the 1980s version, and guest-announcing during the second &quot;Game Show Week&quot; in the final season of the 1990s run. He also became known for playing Kenny Beckett on the sitcom &quot;Dave&#x27;s World&quot; (1993‚Äì1997) and serving as announcer for the Fender Bender 500 segments of &quot;Wake, Rattle, and Roll&quot;. He appeared as himself on an episode of &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; and also on &quot;Caroline in the City&quot;. In 1988, he starred in the film &quot;Traxx&quot;. In 1990, Stevens also starred as the title character on the TV series &quot;Max Monroe: Loose Cannon&quot;. In 1992, he made a small appearance in the comedy film &quot;Mr. Saturday Night&quot;. In 1996, he voiced Doc Samson in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;.

In 1999, he had a cameo in a season 9 episode of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, playing Sonny Sharp, a former top radio DJ who befriends David Silver.

In late 2005, Stevens was hired to be &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;&#x27;s announcer, a position he held until the end of March 2015 when the production contract with producer Worldwide Pants ran out at the end of a two-month interregnum of guest hosts. As part of an April Fool&#x27;s Day hosting swap, Stevens announced for &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; with Craig Ferguson hosting while Drew Carey with his &quot;Price is Right&quot; announcer George Gray hosted &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on April 1, 2014. Shadoe continues to work with Ferguson as the announcer on the History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Join or Die with Craig Ferguson&quot;, and as of February 2017 on &quot;The Craig Ferguson Show&quot; on SiriusXM radio.

In July 2015, Stevens became the primary continuity announcer for Tribune Media&#x27;s television network Antenna TV, replacing Gary Owens, who died in February.

He is also the author of a series of children&#x27;s books. The first, released in 2006, was called &quot;The Big Galoot&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Stevens married his first wife Linda in 1967 (divorced in 1979). He then married Cynthia Gaydos in 1980 (divorced in 1984). He has been married to fashion model Beverly Cunningham since 1986. Stevens has three children: one son, Brad, from his first marriage; and two daughters from his third marriage, Amber Stevens West (also an actress) and Chyna Rose.

Amber, appearing in the ABC Family series &quot;Greek&quot;, made an appearance on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; on July 27, 2007, with her father to promote the show. As a child, she also made a cameo appearance with her father on &quot;American Top 40&quot; the weekend of December 24, 1988, as part of a Christmas skit.

Stevens&#x27; brother Richard, who occasionally filled in for him on the 1986‚Äì89 version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, is a disc jockey on Citadel Media&#x27;s Hits &amp; Favorites format.

<text>Royal Air Force Bishops Court or more simply RAF Bishops Court is a former Royal Air Force airfield, radar control and reporting station located on the south east coast of Northern Ireland, approximately from Downpatrick, County Down, Northern Ireland and from Belfast, Northern Ireland. A Marconi AMES Type 84 radar was located on the airfield and an AMES Type 80 radar was located at Killard Point, Ballyhornan (remote from the station itself). An AMES Type 93 mobile radar was also located on the airfield from 1989 until the station closed.

==History==

===Airfield===
The Class A bomber airfield opened in April 1943 with a main runway of and two subsidiaries of .

Dwight D. Eisenhower landed at Bishops Court in May 1944 while inspecting airfields.

The airfield reopened in March 1953 for training for the Korean War but closed again in April 1954.

A number of different units were based at the airfield:
* 819 Naval Air Squadron
* No. 7 Air Observers School RAF between (17 May 1943 and 15 February 1944
* No. 12 Air Gunners School RAF between 1 August 1943 and 31 May 1945
* No. 7 (Observers) Advanced Flying Unit RAF between 15 February 1944 and 31 May 1945
* No. 7 Air Navigation School RAF between 31 May 1945 and 4 June 1947
* No. 2 Air Navigation School RAF between 4 June and 1 October 1947
* No. 3 Air Navigation School RAF between 3 March 1952 and 14 April 1954
* No. 671 Gliding School RAF between 22 January 1959 and September 1962
* No. 664 Volunteer Gliding School RAF between February 1987 and 31 October 1990

===Radar station===

RAF Bishops Court formed part of the UK Military Air Traffic Service, as one of four reporting stations it was to control its sector (North Atlantic) and was commanded by HQ Military Air Traffic Operations (MATO) at RAF Uxbridge and RAF Strike Command at High Wycombe.
The site was known as Ulster Radar and had both a military and civil role. In its civil role, the civilian personnel (using the military radar) controlled air traffic, primarily over the Atlantic to ensure correct height and separation.

The Irish Republican Army fired five mortar bombs at the radar site on 11 September 1989.

The responsibilities of the site were assumed by the air traffic control centre at Prestwick, Scotland, in October 1978. The radar equipment was soon removed from the site, however the RAF remained. In the early 1980s new bunkers were constructed and a mobile radar was installed. The decision to close the 577¬†acre (2.3¬†km2) site was taken in the late 1980s and it was put up for sale in the period 1991‚Äì1995.

Alexander Galt, the famous Scottish artist, was stationed here during the war. While there, he painted murals on the wall of the Officers&#x27; mess. The paintings are still visible.

==Current use==

Since the sale, the land surrounding the runway has been used for agriculture, while the land at one end of the site (including some of the airfield runways) has been used for motor sport being called Bishopscourt Racing Circuit.
Today at least one runway remains intact and is used by gliders, the married quarters are now civilian housing.

In 2003, it was reported that Bishopscourt was a contender for a Ryanair airfield in the south of Northern Ireland. While the site would require significant infrastructure improvement if this were to happen, the former RAF station would fit into the Ryanair business model (selecting airports some distance from a capital/major city with low landing fees and providing transport to that city.)

<text>Clifton Todd Britt (born November 28, 1969), better known by his stage name Lexington Steele, is an American pornographic actor, director, producer, and former stockbroker. He is the owner of the adult production companies Mercenary Motion Pictures and Black Viking Pictures Inc.

In 2003, Steele became the first actor to receive the AVN Award for Male Performer of the Year three times. He has been inducted into the AVN and XRCO Halls of Fame. Steele has also made several mainstream appearances, including the film &quot;&quot; (2009) and episodes of &quot;Weeds&quot; and &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;.

==Early life==
Steele was born and raised in Morristown, New Jersey. After graduating from Morristown High School, he attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. After two years, he transferred to Syracuse University in New York. In 1993, Steele graduated from Syracuse&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences with Bachelor of Arts degrees in history and African American studies.

==Career==
Steele started out in finance as a stockbroker trainee at a brokerage firm. After earning his Series 7 trading license, he transitioned to working for Oppenheimer Financial at the World Trade Center. Steele believes he would&#x27;ve been a victim of the September 11 attacks had he continued working as a stockbroker.

In a 2015 interview in &quot;AVN&quot; magazine, Steele commented about his transition into the adult industry, &quot;Once I was licensed, it opened the door to a whole new recreational side of the industry. The guy who trained me invited me to a party in a hotel suite, and it ended up being a sex party like the ones in [the film] &quot;Wolf of Wall Street&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t long before a bigger director from Los Angeles gave me a job and suggested I attend the annual porn industry convention in Las Vegas&quot; and with regard to his decision to switch careers and industries and in consideration for how lucrative securities trading can be, Steele stated, &quot;I tell them it&#x27;s not like I was already a master of the universe. I was working 12 to 14 hours six days a week. I made six figures, but my quality of life wasn&#x27;t commensurate&quot;.

Steele has said that his stage name came about back during the days when he worked as a stockbroker when he took the subway to visit a client (at that time, he had already decided to move in the adult film industry and use the last name Steele), who was located in Midtown Manhattan and, Steele said, &quot;I got off the subway at Madison [Avenue], [...] on the corner of Madison and Lexington Avenues&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;], where he was struck by the sound of Lexington as a first name. Steele moved to Los Angeles and joined the industry full-time, initially shooting mainly for companies such as West Coast Productions and director Spunky, before appearing on videotapes produced by Anabolic and Diabolic. At the beginning of 2008, he joined Red Light District Video for a brief period. He appeared in about 1,300 videos in his pornographic career. He is known for his highly productive ejaculation capability and is popular on set.

=== Directing ===
Steele directs and performs exclusively for his own production company, Mercenary Motion Pictures (Headquarters in Encino, California), which he founded in 2009 and serves as chairman and CEO since 2009, with the company reporting annual net profits of $2.6 million in 2011. In 2013, he joined the Evil Angel roster of directors.

=== Mainstream appearances ===
Steele has worked as a model on the side and acted in minor TV roles. He appeared in two episodes of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Weeds&quot; in 2003 (3x07 &quot;He taught me how to drive by&quot; and 3x08 &quot;The two Mrs. Scottsons&quot;) playing himself at a movie shoot filming a scene with Jessica Jaymes and Kirsten Price. He appeared in the 2009 feature film &quot;&quot; and also appeared in an episode of the FX series &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; (5x05 &quot;Chaz Darling&quot;) as a male escort at a party.

== Personal life ==
Steele dated for several years and was at one point engaged to adult film actress and director Vanessa Blue. The two appeared together on &quot;Playboy TV&quot; and in several movies. On June 20, 2006, Blue announced that she would be leaving Steele&#x27;s production company Mercenary Pictures. In 2008, Steele and Blue filed federal lawsuits against each other over the ownership of numerous videos that were released under Mercenary. The suit was ultimately settled in March 2009 after the two met with an alternative dispute resolution jurist.

In October 2016, Steele and French Canadian actress Savana Styles launched Mercenary Enterprises, a division of Mercenary Pictures focusing on fetish-themed productions. In a 2017 interview with &quot;AVN&quot;, Steele revealed he had been married to Styles for a year.

In 2019, Steele underwent hip replacement surgery. During recovery, he experienced complications that required another operation. In November 2019, a crowdfunding campaign through GoFundMe was launched to help pay Steele&#x27;s medical expenses.

==Politics==
During his time studying African-American studies, Steele developed an awareness of American politics and African-American rights. In 2008, he expressed his support for Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign.

<text>David Mills (born January 24, 1959) is an American author. Mills has argued that science and religion cannot be successfully reconciled. He is best known for his book &quot;Atheist Universe&quot; which was published in 2004. In his book &quot;The God Delusion&quot;, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins cites Mills&#x27; writings as &quot;admirable work.&quot; Mills claims in his books to rebut both young- and old-earth creation science, as well as Intelligent Design.

Mills has been interviewed on multiple talk shows including The Infidel Guy, WBAI in New York, on Air America Radio, and elsewhere. He is also a self-proclaimed member of the Rational Response Squad.

He lives in Huntington, West Virginia, and ran for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.

<text>Fazio Cardano (1444 ‚Äì 28 August 1524) was an Italian jurist and mathematician. He was a student of perspective. Cardano was also a professor at the University of Pavia, and was devoted to hermetical science and the world of the occult. He was a friend of Leonardo da Vinci.

It was said that Cardano was always in the company of a familiar spirit who talked to him. This may be a rumour originating from a habit of speaking to himself.

Fazio Cardano was the father of Gerolamo Cardano.

<doc id="596874" wikidata="Q1941315" url="?curid=596874" title="Mo Udall">
<text>Morris King Udall (June 15, 1922 ‚Äì December 12, 1998) was an American attorney and Democratic politician who served as a U.S. representative from Arizona from May 2, 1961, to May 4, 1991. He was a leading contender for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination, but ultimately lost to eventual president, Jimmy Carter. Udall was noted by many for his independent and liberal views.

In 1961, Udall won a special election to succeed his brother, Stewart Udall, as the congressman for Arizona&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. In Congress, Udall became a prominent and popular figure for his independent ways, his leading role in the conservation and environmental protection movements, his key role in reforming Congress and political campaigns, and his pioneering role in opposing the Vietnam War.

Udall sought the Democratic Party nomination in the 1976 presidential election, but was defeated by Jimmy Carter. He supported Ted Kennedy&#x27;s strong challenge to Carter in the 1980 Democratic primary, and delivered the keynote address at the 1980 Democratic National Convention.

Udall served as chairman of the House Interior Committee from 1977 to 1991. Diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1980, he resigned from Congress in 1991 as the effects of the disease worsened. He died in 1998. His son, Mark Udall, represented Colorado in the United States Senate from 2009 to 2015, and his nephew Tom Udall served as a United States Senator from New Mexico from 2009 to 2021. Both also served multiple terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.

== Early life and education ==
Udall was born in 1922 in St. Johns, Arizona, one of six children (&quot;New York Times&quot; says three sons, two daughters) of Louisa (n√©e Lee) and Levi Stewart Udall. His father was a lawyer who served as Chief Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court from 1946 to 1960. His mother was a writer keenly interested in Indian life and culture. His father preached the importance of responsible people entering public service. Udall and his siblings attended local schools in St. Johns.

At age six in 1928, his right eye was cut by a friend&#x27;s pocket knife while the friend and he were trying to cut some string; he lost the eye because his family lacked the money to get him prompt treatment. Udall wore a glass eye for the rest of his life, and he later indicated that the loss of his eye influenced both his personality and his politics.

He described his early rural/small-town life in the desert as harsh and primitive, in a town where &quot;everybody worked.&quot; Noting they had &quot;no tractors,&quot; he added, &quot;we had horses and plows.&quot;

While in high school, despite the lost eye, Udall was a star athlete in basketball, and in football as quarterback leading an undefeated team. He also marched in the school band, wrote a political column for the school paper, and took the lead in the school play.

==Military service==
Udall attempted to enlist in the Army Air Forces during World War II, and almost succeeded by covering his glass eye each time he was told to alternate during the eye exam. After he was medically cleared, another potential enlistee complained that he had been medically rejected for flat feet, while Udall had passed with one eye. The examiners retested Udall under closer scrutiny, and he was rejected. Later, medical standards changed and Udall served in the Army. He joined the Army Air Forces as a private in 1942 and later received his commission as an officer. He commanded an all-black squadron for two years in Louisiana, an experience of which Udall later said, &quot;That really shaped my life,&quot; because he had &quot;fought their fights with them... over local discrimination.&quot; Udall later served in the South Pacific and achieved the rank of captain before being discharged in 1946.

==Higher education and basketball career==
After the war, Udall completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree at the University of Arizona, where he was a star basketball player (team co-captain), President of the Associated Student Government, and a member of Sigma Chi fraternity.

For one year following graduation, Udall played professional basketball with the Denver Nuggets during the 1948‚Äì49 National Basketball League season. At the same time, he attended the University of Denver College of Law. He completed his studies at the University of Arizona&#x27;s law school, where he graduated in 1949 with a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree.

==Personality and philosophy==
Udall was a tall (6&#x27;5&quot;), Lincolnesque figure with a self-deprecating wit and easy manner. Because of his wit, columnist James J. Kilpatrick deemed him &quot;too funny to be president&quot;, which also ended up being the title of his autobiography in the 1980s.

He once said that his physical stature and one eye kept him from ever having a date in high school, and led to his use of self-deprecating humor to survive.

Known for his humor, his irreverent and casual style (particularly his colorful western wear and cowboy boots), and his ethics, Udall was summarized by leading political journalist James M. Perry as &quot;funny, smart, down-to-earth, honest, sassy, patient.&quot;

Despite being raised Mormon, his spiritual views changed during his later years. He ceased being active in church by the time he returned from military service. While in college, as he read philosophy and history, Udall abandoned his Mormon faith. In particular, he rejected the cultural view among some Church members of the time that black people were &quot;cursed.&quot;

==Early career==
In 1949 Udall, with his brother, Stewart, started the law firm of Udall &amp; Udall in Tucson, Arizona, practicing law in Tucson until 1961.

Udall was elected as the Pima County chief deputy attorney (1950‚Äì1952) and county attorney (1953‚Äì1954). In 1954, he failed in a bid to be nominated for a Superior Court judgeship.

He taught labor law at the University of Arizona law school (1955, 1956). In 1961 he became vice-president of the Arizona Bar Association. Udall co-founded the Bank of Tucson, and the Catalina Savings and Loan Association, and in 1960 became president of Tucson&#x27;s YMCA.

== Political career ==
Throughout his early life, Udall dreamed of public office, but‚Äîunder pressure from his wife‚Äîdeferred a congressional race opportunity to his older brother, Stewart Udall. The latter won seat in 1954. The younger Udall&#x27;s hopes for a seat on the Arizona Supreme Court (where their father had served) were dashed when the seat went to his ultra-conservative uncle, Jesse Addison Udall, instead.

===Congressman===

In 1961, his brother was appointed as Secretary of the Interior in the John F. Kennedy administration. Mo then won a special election for his brother&#x27;s vacant seat by 2,000 votes, with 51% of the vote. He won the seat in his own right in 1962, and was reelected 13 more times. He faced only one other close race, in 1978, when he received 52 percent of the vote. He held the post until his resignation May 4, 1991.

For his first term, Udall represented the entire state outside of Maricopa County. After the 1960s round of redistricting, his district was reduced to the southern portion of the state, centered on Tucson. After a mid-decade redistricting ordered as a result of &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders,&quot; his district absorbed some outer portions of the Phoenix area.

From 1977 until his retirement in 1991, Udall chaired the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs (on which he&#x27;d served since 1963). He also served as ranking member of the Committee of the Post Office and Civil Service, chairman of the Office of Technology Assessment and was a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs

====Vietnam War====
Udall first gained national political notice for a speech October 23, 1967, in Tucson at a major regional civic meeting, with an audience of 2,800‚Äîlargely civic leaders, mostly supportive of President Johnson&#x27;s policy on the Vietnam War. Despite their leanings, Udall gave a firm and direct speech calling the nation&#x27;s involvement in Vietnam &quot;a mistaken and dangerous road.&quot; He called for reversing American escalation of the war, and eventual U.S. withdrawal‚Äîthe first major figure in the U.S. Democratic Party to openly oppose the Democratic president on the war. The speech drew a standing ovation, and reverberated nationwide, drawing national media and political attention, and initiating the Democratic Party&#x27;s gradual split over the war.

====Labor legislation====
On labor legislation, however, Udall was less liberal. Though he opposed right-to-work laws that undermined labor unions, his constituents very strongly supported them, so Udall did, too‚Äîparticularly in a 1965 congressional vote that labor leaders held against him for years.

====Conservation and the environment====
On conservation and environmental protection, Udall&#x27;s record was mixed‚Äîand extreme in both directions‚Äîthough he is largely credited with being generally a defender of those causes (he first joined the House Interior committee in 1961), particularly as chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. He fought for environmental protection, and expansion of the National Park System, ushered legislation through Congress absorbing 8 million acres into the federal wilderness system across 20 states, and attempted to restructure the energy industry.

An important exception was his defense of planned dam-and-reservoir projects in Arizona that threatened to inundate key wilderness areas, including a hydroelectric dam that threatened to flood some of the Grand Canyon. Hostile campaigning by the nation&#x27;s leading conservation organization, the Sierra Club, led to Udall&#x27;s bitter fight with them, and the eventual loss of their tax-exempt status, which some have blamed on Udall&#x27;s complaints about them to the Internal Revenue Service. The projects were eventually abandoned, replaced with coal-fired powerplants that Udall thought more polluting than the dams would have been.

However, in the opposite extreme, Udall&#x27;s &quot;proudest achievement&quot; was passage of an Alaska lands bill, permanently preserving 104.3 million acres of extraordinary scenic wilderness, over the furious opposition of many in Alaska and in the natural resource industries.

In 1973, Udall was named &quot;Legislator of the Year&quot; by the National Wildlife Federation.

However, in 1974, his Land Use Bill was defeated‚Äîsome environmentalists blaming Udall&#x27;s inability to work the bill effectively on the floor of the House.

From the beginning of his work on the Interior committee in 1961, Udall had been interested in limiting the controversial practice of strip mining, blamed for massive destruction of wilderness and extensive environmental damage, particularly across the American West. However, it took several years of wrangling with industry, Congress and administrations (Republican President Gerald R. Ford vetoed the legislation twice), before he was able to pass a limited bill, into law (signed by Democratic President Jimmy Carter), which constrained the strip-mining of coal, and forced the reclamation of millions of acres of strip-mined areas.

Udall helped write and pass the Alaska Lands Act of 1980, and landmark 1982 legislation addressing nuclear waste management.

====Government legislative reform====
Udall challenged the arcane and Byzantine rules and protocols of the House of Representatives, demanding a reduction in the ability of powerful leaders to covertly control legislation and dominate committees. Udall&#x27;s efforts eventually led to substantial reform of congressional rules and operations.

Udall gained early national political notoriety for being the first congressman in the 20th century to challenge a sitting Speaker of the House for his seat. He challenged Rep. John McCormack, in 1968. Though defeated, Udall tried again two years later, against House Majority Leader, Hale Boggs; he lost again but shook the foundations of the House seniority system. This was eventually reformed, largely as a result of the revolt begun by Udall.

Like any freshman congressman, Udall struggled to adapt to the office during his first term; but in his second term, he responded to the experience by organizing a school for other incoming freshmen congressman, to teach them the complex and subtle ways of the House of Representatives, and how to navigate the Washington bureaucracy. To aid this effort, Udall wrote a 1966 guidebook, &quot;The Job of a Congressman.&quot;

====Government campaign reform====
Udall co-sponsored the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 and was a key factor in its success. The first major campaign-finance reform legislation since 1925, it required candidates to file campaign finance reports. (President Richard Nixon ran afoul of these requirements in actions related to the Watergate scandal). Udall also co-sponsored the 1974 Campaign Reform Act, which was signed by President Ford. He fought for financial disclosure legislation, and disclosed his own finances and tax returns.

====Government administrative reform====
Reforming civil service and the U.S. Post Office were a major focus of Udall&#x27;s efforts in Congress. On the Committee of the Post Office and Civil Service since 1961, he eventually became the ranking member. He attempted to revise pay scales for federal employees and establish merit pay.

Ultimately, Udall was one of the principal leaders effecting the first substantial reform of the U.S. civil service system since the 1883 creation of that merit-based government-employment system. The bill created performance incentives for workers in the bureaucracy, and made firing federal workers easier. Although the bill was a favorite project of President Carter, whom Udall disliked, the congressman pushed the bill through Congress, against numerous roadblocks thrown up by federal employees (and by congressmen representing districts that employed many of them). Udall compromised until getting a consensus bill before the whole House, fighting through additional opposition to success.

Udall sought to change the Post Office Department from a purely governmental agency into a semiprivate organization (today, it is: the U.S. Postal Service). He was a key force in passage of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970.

====Other issues====
Because of having lost his eye as a child due to inadequate family finances, he strongly believed that people should have access to competent medical care regardless of their financial condition.

In 1963, Udall attempted to get cigarettes (and other tobacco) regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It took years before the scale of tobacco damage due to smoking was known.

On the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Udall opposed Reagan administration policies toward Central America.

=== Presidential campaign ===
In 1976, Udall ran for the Democratic nomination for President as a liberal alternative to Jimmy Carter, the former Governor of Georgia. Carter had gone from obscure maverick to front runner after a string of early caucus and primary victories, beginning in Iowa and New Hampshire. At the time of the Wisconsin primary in April, most of the original 10 candidates had dropped out, leaving Udall, Senator Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson of Washington, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, and Carter. It appeared that Udall would win the primary, which might have slowed Carter&#x27;s momentum. Udall was projected the winner, exclaiming &quot;Oh, how sweet it is&quot;. But Carter eventually won in Wisconsin.
Some newspapers proclaimed Udall the winner because of his lead late the night before. They had been wrong before, in the 1948 presidential election, in which the headlines of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; erroneously proclaimed &quot;Dewey Defeats Truman.&quot;

Carter won in Wisconsin by 1%, no more than 7,500 votes. He won 37% to Udall&#x27;s 36%, gaining one more convention delegate than Udall. Despite the small margins, Carter got the headlines and a further boost to his momentum, and pulled away from Udall and the other candidates. Udall finished second in the New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New York, Michigan, South Dakota, and Ohio primaries, and won the caucuses in his home state of Arizona, while running even with Carter in the New Mexico caucuses. Udall finished a distant second to Carter at the Democratic National Convention, where his name was placed in nomination by Archibald Cox, and Udall&#x27;s speech received great applause from his supporters.

During the Michigan primary Coleman Young, the mayor of Detroit, accused Udall of racism for belonging to the LDS church. At the time, it still prohibited blacks from serving in the church&#x27;s priesthood (this was changed in 1978 by LDS Church President Spencer W. Kimball). Udall had been a longtime critic of that church policy, and had ceased being an active member because of it. Carter&#x27;s subsequent sweeping of the black vote in the Michigan primary was key to his crucial and narrow victory in Michigan.

Udall supported Senator Edward Kennedy&#x27;s challenge to President Carter in 1980, and Kennedy won the Arizona caucuses, one of only three wins for Kennedy in the West. Udall delivered the keynote speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, which was a typically witty Udall speech. He considered running for president again in 1984, but he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1979 and his illness kept him on the sidelines. At the convention that summer, Udall introduced his former opponent, President Carter.

== Legacy ==

In 1992, the US Congress founded the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation. It is an agency of the executive branch of the federal government, and among other functions, gives scholarships to students of environmental policy. In 2009, Congress added Mo&#x27;s brother, Stewart Udall, as an honoree of the foundation by renaming it as the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation.

Federal funds for Parkinson&#x27;s research are designated through the Morris K. Udall Parkinson&#x27;s Disease Research Act of 1997. The legislation funded a national network of &quot;Centers of Excellence&quot; to diagnose and treat Parkinson disease patients and to refer patients into research protocols.

In 1996 Udall received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Clinton.

Point Udall on Guam, considered the westernmost point of the United States, was named for him in 1987. The easternmost spot, Point Udall, U.S. Virgin Islands, was named for his brother Stewart in 1968. This means that &quot;America&#x27;s day ... begin(s) and end(s) at a Point Udall.&quot;

In Tucson, Arizona, the main post office was named in his honor in 2007 as well as a local park.

==Family life==

Udall was married three times. In 1949, he married Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Emery, with whom he had six children. Patricia, who hated politics, had arthritis and spent much time in a wheelchair. She and Udall rarely saw each other due to his hectic political schedule. By Mo Udall&#x27;s own account, Pat had become unsatisfied with her life caused by her illnesses and disinterest in politics. She was also a high-spirited person who had a tendency to frequently start arguments.

Pat Udall struggled emotionally due to the strain of raising six children while struggling with arthritis. Unwilling to undergo psychological counseling due to social stigma, she finally acquiesced and filed for divorce in 1966. Mo Udall, who was opposed to the divorce, did not object to the dissolution of the marriage, mainly because he was more focused on politics than on his family.

Both the Udalls later regretted the divorce, explaining that the marriage ended because Pat had failed to get counseling or help and had simply acquiesced to pressure and made a poor impulse decision. Pat Udall herself stated that she was &quot;ashamed&quot; by her decision to end the marriage. Pat went on to marry and divorce three more times in the seven years following her split from Udall, all of which were brief marriages that she later regretted. Mo and Pat eventually reconciled, and they remained close friends for the rest of his life.

Two years after the divorce, Mo Udall married Ella Lee Royston, a marriage that would last until Royston&#x27;s suicide in 1988. In 1989, he married his third wife, Norma Gilbert, and they remained together until his death in 1998. His years in retirement were plagued by Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Udall&#x27;s son Mark Udall was elected to the U.S. Congress from Colorado&#x27;s 2nd district in 1998, and to the U.S. Senate in 2008. His nephew Tom Udall of New Mexico was also elected to the U.S. Senate in 2008. Mo Udall&#x27;s second cousin, Republican Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, was defeated for re-election the same year.

<text>James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, abbreviated JAGS, is a private day school situated in Dulwich, South London, England. Founded in 1741, it is the second oldest girls‚Äô independent school in Great Britain, with Godolphin School in Salisbury being the oldest, founded in 1726.

It is a registered charity and was originally part of Edward Alleyn&#x27;s College of God&#x27;s Gift charitable foundation, which also included Alleyn&#x27;s School and Dulwich College.

It has a senior school for 11- to 18-year-old girls, a prep school for 7- to 11-year-old girls (James Allen&#x27;s Preparatory School), and a pre-preparatory school for 4- to 7-year-old girls. It is the sister school of Dulwich College and Alleyn&#x27;s.

==History==
===1741: Dulwich Reading School===

In 1604 the hamlet of Dulwich, its name recorded well before the Norman Conquests, was bought by the Elizabethan actor and entrepreneur, Edward Alleyn, for ¬£4,900. Fourteen years later, Alleyn invested his fortune establishing the College of God&#x27;s Gift, buying land for a school, a chapel and the alms houses in Dulwich. In June 1741 James Allen, Master of the College of God&#x27;s Gift from 1723, founded the original Reading School for poor children, both boys and girls living in Dulwich.

The Dulwich Reading School started in two rooms in the Bricklayer‚Äôs Arms, later called The French Horn in Dulwich Village. The boys were taught to read as preparation for entry to Dulwich College and the girls to read and sew.

===Early 1800s: Dulwich Free School===
By the 1800s it was known as the Dulwich Free School. Classes were growing in size and moved into an empty old inn building near the village crossroads and was renamed the Dulwich Free School.

===1842: Dulwich Girls‚Äô School===
The school continued to grow and when the College was reorganised in the 1840s, the boys were moved, leaving the Free School with improved teaching for the girls from 1842. It was renamed The Dulwich Girls‚Äô School with mostly local girls as pupils. It was housed in the building now inhabited by Dulwich Hamlet School.

===1878: James Allen‚Äôs Girls‚Äô School===
The school became known as James Allen‚Äôs Girls‚Äô School in 1878 and finally moved with 141 pupils to its present site in East Dulwich Grove in 1886 with Miss Bettany as its first Headmistress.

Botany Gardens were created in the school grounds soon after Dr Lilian Clarke joined the staff in 1895. It was the first such experiment by a school in this country. In 1902 the first school laboratory equipped solely for botanical study was opened. She was a pioneer and influential in science teaching nationally. In 1890 the school roll had grown to 200 and the curriculum expanded.

===20th century===

In the early 20th century, Ralph Vaughan Williams worked at the school as a singing master, and his friend Gustav Holst worked as music teacher at JAGS from 1904 for 16 years. Holst collaborated on Tennyson‚Äôs Songs from the Princess while at JAGS. He stopped teaching there in 1920 but maintained a close connection with the school. Choral music and singing developed into a core part of school life. By 1916 a school orchestra emerged for the first time and in 1920 JAGS girls participated in Holst‚Äôs 4th Thaxted Festival in Essex as a farewell to the composer. A series of stained glass windows was installed in 1969 in the Holst Hall.

Sports Mistress Mildred Knott was appointed in 1921; she was an excellent hockey player who became captain of the England hockey team.

The school was evacuated at the beginning of WWII (Sept.1939) to Walthamstow Hall school in Sevenoaks, Kent but in May 1940 returned to Dulwich.

In the 1950s and 60s JAGS expanded and community work was popular. Under Miss Prissian a new theatre was opened by Jonathan Miller in 1983; the first girls‚Äô school to have a purpose built theatre.

The 1990s saw a great deal of building work in the school, Community Action was developed and links with local state schools were established.

===21st century===
A new Community Music Centre was officially opened in 2018. The &quot;Vaughan Williams Auditorium&quot; was named after the composer who worked at the school.

<text>Strong Vincent (June 17, 1837 ‚Äì July 7, 1863) was a lawyer who became famous as a U.S. Army officer during the American Civil War. He was mortally wounded while leading his brigade during the fighting at Little Round Top on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, and died five days later.

==Early life and education==
Vincent was born in Waterford, Pennsylvania, son of iron foundryman B. B. Vincent and Sarah Ann (n√©e) Strong. He attended Trinity College and Harvard University, graduating in 1859. He practiced law in Erie, Pennsylvania.

==American Civil War==
At the start of the American Civil War, Vincent joined the Pennsylvania Militia as an adjutant and first lieutenant of the Erie Regiment. On September 14, 1861, he was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the 83rd Pennsylvania Infantry and was promoted to colonel the following June. After the death of his regimental commander in the Seven Days Battles (at the Battle of Gaines&#x27;s Mill), Vincent assumed command of the regiment. He developed malaria on the Virginia Peninsula and was on medical leave until the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. On May 20, 1863, he assumed command of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, V Corps, Army of the Potomac, replacing his brigade commander, who resigned after the Battle of Chancellorsville.
At the Battle of Gettysburg, 26-year-old Vincent and his brigade arrived on July 2, 1863. He had started the Gettysburg Campaign knowing that his young wife, Elizabeth H. Carter, whom he had married on the day he enlisted in the army, was pregnant with their first child. He had written her, &quot;If I fall, remember you have given your husband to the most righteous cause that ever widowed a woman.&quot;

Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles of the III Corps had deviated from his orders, moving his corps to a position that left undefended a significant terrain feature: Little Round Top. The chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, recognized the tactical importance of the hill and urgently sought Union troops to occupy it before the Confederates could. A staff officer sent by Warren encountered Vincent&#x27;s brigade nearby. Vincent, without consulting his superior officers, decided that his brigade was in the ideal position to defend Little Round Top, saying &quot;I will take the responsibility to take my brigade there.&quot; Pvt. Oliver Willcox Norton, Vincent&#x27;s brigade standard bearer and bugler, later wrote that he and Vincent made a reconnaissance of the Confederate forces as the brigade was moving into position, &quot;While our line was forming on the hill at Gettysburg I came out with him in full view of the rebel lines. They opened two batteries on us instantly, firing at the colors. Colonel Vincent looked to see what was drawing the fire and yelled at me, &quot;Down with the flag, Norton! Damn it, go behind the rocks with it.&quot;.
One of Vincent&#x27;s regiments, the 20th Maine, led by Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, has received most of the fame for the defense of Little Round Top, but there is little doubt that the efforts and bravery of Vincent were instrumental in the eventual Union victory. Vincent impressed upon Chamberlain the importance of his position on the brigade&#x27;s left flank and then he left to attend to the brigade&#x27;s right flank. There, the 16th Michigan Infantry was starting to yield to enemy pressure. Mounting a large boulder, Vincent brandished a riding crop given to him by his wife and shouted to his men &quot;Don&#x27;t give an inch!&quot; A bullet struck him through the thigh and the groin and he fell. Due to the determination of the 20th Maine, the 44th New York, the 83rd Pennsylvania and the 16th Michigan Infantry, the Union line held against the Confederate onslaught. Vincent was carried from the hill to a nearby farm, where he lay dying for the next five days, unable to be transported home due to the severity of his injury.

The commander of the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, recommended Vincent for promotion to brigadier general on the evening of July 2. The promotion was dated July 3, 1863, but it is doubtful that Vincent knew about the honor before he died (although Pvt. Oliver Willcox Norton in &quot;Army Letters 1861-1865&quot; writes &quot;His commission as Brigadier General was read to him on his deathbed.&quot;) Vincent&#x27;s wife gave birth to a baby girl two months later, who died before reaching the age of one and is buried next to her father.

His corps commander, Maj. Gen. George Sykes, described Vincent&#x27;s actions in his official report from the battle:

==Legacy==

Vincent is buried in Erie Cemetery in Erie. He is memorialized by a statue on the 83rd Pennsylvania monument on Little Round Top; by a statue erected in 1997 at Blasco Memorial Library, Erie; and by Strong Vincent Middle School in Erie. The portion of Little Round Top to the southeast of Sykes Avenue on the Gettysburg Battlefield is known as &quot;Vincent&#x27;s Spur&quot;. The 1-112 Infantry of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard stationed in Cambridge Springs uses the call sign &quot;STRONG&quot; in recognition of Vincent&#x27;s courage, determination and sacrifice.

==In popular culture==
*Vincent is a character in the novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; by Michael Shaara. In its 1993 film adaptation &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, he is portrayed by Maxwell Caulfield.
*Vincent is a character in the alternate history novel &quot;&quot; by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen.

<doc id="596878" wikidata="Q5752075" url="?curid=596878" title="Hidden-line removal">
<text>In 3D computer graphics, solid objects are usually modeled by polyhedra. A face of a polyhedron is a planar polygon bounded by straight line segments, called edges. Curved surfaces are usually approximated by a polygon mesh. Computer programs for line drawings of opaque objects must be able to decide which edges or which parts of the edges are hidden by an object itself or by other objects, so that those edges can be clipped during rendering. This problem is known as hidden-line removal.

The first known solution to the hidden-line problem was devised by L. G. Roberts in 1963. However, it severely restricts the model: it requires that all objects be convex. Ruth A. Weiss of Bell Labs documented her 1964 solution to this problem in a 1965 paper.
In 1966 Ivan E. Sutherland listed 10 unsolved problems in computer graphics. Problem number seven was &quot;hidden-line removal&quot;. In terms of computational complexity, this problem was solved by Frank Devai in 1986.

Models, e.g. in computer-aided design, can have thousands or millions of edges. Therefore, a computational-complexity approach expressing resource requirements (such as time and memory) as the function of problem sizes is crucial. Time requirements are particularly important in interactive systems.

Problem sizes for hidden-line removal are the total number of the edges of the model and the total number of the visible segments of the edges. Visibility can change at the intersection points of the images of the edges. Let denote the total number of the intersection points of the images of the edges. Both and in the worst case, but usually .

== Algorithms ==
Hidden-line algorithms published before 1984 divide edges into line segments by the intersection points of their images, and then test each segment for visibility against each face of the model. Assuming a model of a collection of polyhedra with the boundary of each topologically equivalent to a sphere and with faces topologically equivalent to disks, according to Euler&#x27;s formula, there are Œò(&quot;n&quot;) faces. Testing Œò(&quot;n&quot;2) line segments against Œò(&quot;n&quot;) faces takes Œò(&quot;n&quot;3) time in the worst case. Appel&#x27;s algorithm is also unstable, because an error in visibility will be propagated to subsequent segment endpoints.

Ottmann and Widmayer 
and Ottmann, Widmayer and Wood
proposed &quot;O&quot;((&quot;n&quot; + &quot;k&quot;)‚ÄØlog2‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;)-time hidden-line algorithms. Then Nurmi improved the running time to &quot;O&quot;((&quot;n&quot; + &quot;k&quot;)‚ÄØlog‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;). These algorithms take Œò(&quot;n&quot;2‚ÄØlog2‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;), respectively Œò(&quot;n&quot;2‚ÄØlog‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;) time in the worst case, but if &quot;k&quot; is less than quadratic, can be faster in practice.

Any hidden-line algorithm has to determine the union of Œò(&quot;n&quot;) hidden intervals on &quot;n&quot; edges in the worst case. As Œ©(&quot;n&quot;‚ÄØlog‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;) is a lower bound for determining the union of &quot;n&quot; intervals,
it appears that the best one can hope to achieve is Œò(&quot;n&quot;2‚ÄØlog‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;) worst-case time, and hence Nurmi&#x27;s algorithm is optimal.

However, the log‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot; factor was eliminated by Devai, who raised the open problem whether the same optimal &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2) upper bound existed for hidden-surface removal. This problem was solved by McKenna in 1987.

The intersection-sensitive algorithms are mainly known in the computational-geometry literature. The quadratic upper bounds are also appreciated by the computer-graphics literature: Ghali notes that the algorithms by Devai and McKenna &quot;represent milestones in visibility algorithms&quot;, breaking a theoretical barrier from &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2‚ÄØlog‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;) to &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2) for processing a scene of &quot;n&quot; edges.

The other open problem, raised by Devai, of whether there exists an &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;‚ÄØlog‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot; + &quot;v&quot;)-time hidden-line algorithm, where &quot;v&quot;, as noted above, is the number of visible segments, is still unsolved at the time of writing.

== Parallel algorithms ==
In 1988 Devai proposed an &quot;O&quot;(log‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;)-time parallel algorithm using &quot;n&quot;2 processors for the hidden-line problem under the concurrent read, exclusive write (CREW) parallel random-access machine (PRAM) model of computation. As the product of the processor number and the running time is asymptotically greater than Œò(&quot;n&quot;2), the sequential complexity of the problem, the algorithm is not work-optimal, but it demonstrates that the hidden-line problem is in the complexity class NC, i.e., it can be solved in polylogarithmic time by using a polynomial number of processors.

Hidden-surface algorithms can be used for hidden-line removal, but not the other way around. Reif and Sen proposed an &quot;O&quot;(log4‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;)-time algorithm for the hidden-surface problem, using &quot;O&quot;((&quot;n&quot; + &quot;v&quot;)/log‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;) CREW PRAM processors for a restricted model of polyhedral terrains, where &quot;v&quot; is the output size.

In 2011 Devai published an &quot;O&quot;(log‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;)-time hidden-surface, and a simpler, also &quot;O&quot;(log‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;)-time, hidden-line algorithm. The hidden-surface algorithm, using &quot;n&quot;2/log‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot; CREW PRAM processors, is work-optimal.

The hidden-line algorithm uses &quot;n&quot;2 exclusive read, exclusive write (EREW) PRAM processors. The EREW model is the PRAM variant closest to real machines. The hidden-line algorithm does &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2‚ÄØlog‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;) work, which is the upper bound for the best sequential algorithms used in practice.

Cook, Dwork and Reischuk gave an Œ©(log‚ÄØ&quot;n&quot;) lower bound for finding the maximum of &quot;n&quot; integers allowing infinitely many processors of any PRAM without simultaneous writes. Finding the maximum of &quot;n&quot; integers is constant-time reducible to the hidden-line problem by using &quot;n&quot; processors. Therefore, the hidden-line algorithm is time optimal.

<text>Ilorin is the capital city of Kwara State located in the Western region of Nigeria. Although Ilorin is classified under the North-Central geopolitical zone, the city is considered a Yoruba city by all historical and sociological standards. As of the 2006 census, it had a population of 777,667, making it the 7th largest city by population in Nigeria.

==History==
Ilorin was founded by the Yoruba, one of the three largest ethnic groups in Nigeria, in 1450. It became a provincial military headquarters of the ancient Oyo Empire, and later became part of the Northern Nigeria protectorate. Before the coming of the British Shehu Alimi, an itinerant Islamic preacher and teacher, took control of the city through the spread of Islam, and aligned it with the Sokoto Caliphate. The capital was occupied by the Royal Niger Company in 1897 and its lands were incorporated into the British colony of Northern Nigeria in 1900, although the emirate continued to perform ceremonial functions. The city retains a strong Islamic influence, although Christianity is now widely practised in the cosmopolitan part of the city due to the significant immigration of people from other parts of Kwara State and the rest of Nigeria.

Ilorin, city, traditional emirate, and capital of Kwara state, western Nigeria. It is located on the Awun River, a minor tributary of the Niger. Founded in the late 18th century by Yoruba people, it became the capital of a kingdom that was a vassal state of the Oyo empire. Oyo‚Äôs commander at Ilorin, Kakanfo (Field Marshal) Afonja, led a rebellion in 1817 that destroyed the unity of the empire. He was aided by Mallam Alimi (a Fulani from Sokoto), and by Hausa slaves. Afonja was double-crossed by the Fulani, and, upon his assassination, Alimi‚Äôs son, Abd al-Salam (Abdul Salami), became emir of Ilorin and pledged allegiance (&quot;c.&quot; 1829) to the Sokoto caliphate. As a Muslim emirate, Ilorin attacked several towns in Northern Yorubaland and destroyed the Oyo capital, Oyo Ile (Old Oyo, or Katunga), 40 miles (64¬†km) northwest, in 1837. Abd al-Salam conducted a jihad toward the sea but was ultimately stopped by the Ibadan victory over his cavalrymen at Oshogbo in 1840.

Throughout the 19th century, Ilorin served as a major trade centre between the Hausa of the north and the Yoruba of the south. It strongly resisted British rule, and not until 1897, when the army of the Royal Niger Company arrived after conquering Bida (106 miles east-northeast), did Ilorin recognize British supremacy. In 1900, Ilorin emirate was the only part of Yorubaland to be included in the Northern Nigeria Protectorate, which, later in the colonial period, developed into the Northern Province and then the Northern Region. With the subdivision of the country‚Äôs administrative regions in 1967, Ilorin became part of West Central (later Kwara) state.

== Demographics ==

Modern Ilorin is mainly inhabited by the Yoruba people, although its traditional ruler has a Fulani heritage.

== Sports ==
Ilorin has an 18,000-capacity stadium and two professional football teams; Kwara United F.C. playing in the top-tier league of Nigeria Professional Football League (N.P.F.L) which is run by the League Management Company; and ABS FC in the second division which is Bet9ja Nigeria National league.

The city has the only standard baseball field in West Africa. It has also hosted several national handball competitions.

==Commerce==

The political economy of Kwara State can be traced to 1967 when it was created. Since then the state has undergone various developmental efforts, mostly initiated by the federal government given the nature of the Nigerian state, a centralized federal system where development policies and programmes originate from the centre.

The state has a large area of rich agricultural land. The limestone and dolomite of Oreke, kaolin and clay at Idofian near Ilorin and other parts of the state, pure gold in Kaiama and the Patigi area, and the highly exportable rich tantalite deposit of Iporin make Kwara State rich in primary resources.

Initially, Kwara State had only a few major industrial companies, Global Soap (not more in operation), Detergent Industries Nigeria Limited and the International Tobacco Company. Successive administrations have attempted to attract industrialists to the state.

With such efforts, Ilorin has become the hub for cashew processing in Nigeria and Olam International has set up Africa&#x27;s biggest cashew processing plant. The plant processes 100 MT of cashews every day and provides employment to over 2000 workers.

Recently established industries include Dangote Flour Mills, Tuyil Pharmaceutical company, KAMWIL, Golden Confectionate Food Industries, Chellaram Motor-Cycle Assembly plants, and Rajrab Pharmaceuticals.

==Climate==
Ilorin has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). It has an annual rainfall which can range between . The city has maximum temperatures varying between , with the third month of the year, March, being the hottest. The minimum and maximum temperature, and also the relative humidity have increased between 1978 and 2017. The wind that blows is typically from points between southeast and northeast.
==Transport==


Ilorin operates a relatively well-developed intra-city public transport system, and the major roads within the metropolis are well constructed.

There are three different modes of available transit from one place to another in the city ‚Äì the most popular being the conventional taxis. Car-hire services are also available in major hotels. Furthermore, there are commercial motorbikes, commonly called &quot;Okada&quot;. A more recent arrival on Ilorin&#x27;s roads are commercial tricycles, popularly called &quot;Keke NAPEP&quot; or &quot;Keke&quot; or &quot;Keke Maruwa&quot;, some of which are given on loan to beneficiaries of the National Poverty Eradication Programme. Ilorin taxis are painted yellow and green.

Ilorin&#x27;s central location makes it easily accessible to all parts of the country by air, road and rail. The state has a good network of roads, rail and air transportation facilities linking it with Nigeria&#x27;s other industrial and commercial centres. Transportation is quite affordable in Ilorin for movement from one place to another for as low as one hundred naira.

There are scheduled daily commercial flights to and from Ilorin International Airport by Arik Air and Overland Airways. The now defunct Capital Airlines also operated from Ilorin. Current destinations include all of the major cities in Nigeria. The airport has also been re-designed and equipped as an international cargo airport.

Ilorin offers reliable road transport services to Lagos, Ogun, Osun, Ondo, Oyo, Ekiti, Kogi, Niger, Kaduna and Plateau States. Similar services are available to and from Onitsha, Port Harcourt, Abuja, Aba and others.

A major expressway to Ibadan, numbered E1, is currently under construction by P.W. International. Ilorin is served by the railway and highway from Lagos (160 miles south-southwest), via Ibadan, which intersect in the city, and it has an international airport.

==Culture==

===Religion===
The city is a confluence of cultures, populated by the Yoruba, Fulani, Nupe, Bariba, Kanuri, Igbo and Hausa ethnicities across Nigeria, as well as foreign and nationals. There are large Christian and Islamic populations, and many ceremonial activities, mostly with religious aspects, take place in the city throughout the year.

==== Christianity in Ilorin ====
The city has a host of ancient and modern churches with moderate to large congregations, such as the Catholic Church, Cherubim and Seraphim churches, Anglican, Methodist, Celestial Church of Christ, Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), Emmanuel Baptist Church, First Baptist Church, and Zion Baptist church. Notable Pentecostal churches include Redeemed Christian Church of God, The Gospel Faith Mission International (Gofamint), Deeper Life Church, and Living Faith Church. Seventh-day Adventists are also represented. Most Christian churches in the state started schools and introduced innovative ideas that were readily adopted by the Muslim schools.

There has been a Latter-day Saint congregation in Ilorin since 1992. In that year an LDS mission was organized in the city that year, but shortly later merged with the one in Enugu. Starting in 2016 additional LDS congregations were organized in Ilorin, which in 2018 was transferred to the new Nigerian Ibadan Mission, and had a district organized.

===Ilorin Central Mosque===
===History===
The first Ilorin central mosque was founded in 1820 in the Agbarere Area, popularly known as &quot;Ile-Elewa&quot;, under the leadership of Sheik Imam Muhammad Munab&#x27;bau. This was followed in 1835 when another central mosque was built at Idi-Ape during the reign of the first Emir of Ilorin, Abdus-salam. However, more than a century later, this central mosque could no longer cope with the growth in the Muslim population of the city. For this reason, in 1974, the ninth Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Zulkarnaini Gambari, invited Grand Mufti Alhaji Mohammed Kamal-u-deen and the then present Wazirin Ngeri of Ilorin, Abubakar Sola Saraki, to co-ordinate the fundraising and construction of a new central mosque.

===The present Ilorin Central Mosque===

On 30 April 1977, the foundation was laid for the new mosque by the Emir of Gwandu on behalf of the Sarki Musulmi, Sultan Abubakar III. The new Ilorin Central Mosque was completed and officially opened in 1981 by the former president Alhaji Shehu Shagari. The Mosque was renovated, rehabilitated and expanded in 2012 with a majestic view. The newly redecorated mosque was recommissioned on 14 December 2012.

===The &quot;New&quot; Ilorin Central Mosque===
Planning for the rehabilitation, refurbishment and redecoration of the Central Mosque started in 2007 when Alhaji Ibrahim Zulu Gambari, CFR, the eleventh Emir of Ilorin, with assistance from Abubakar Bukola Saraki, the Turaki of Ilorin, and the former Governor of Kwara State, set up a technical committee headed by Alhaji Shehu Abdul-gafar on the rehabilitation and enhancement of the central mosque. The committee has invited expertise from specialists in mosque construction from around the world, especially from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Nigeria.

In addition to the general restoration and enhancement of the mosque, it now has a total of 99 domes of different diameters, 75 feet above the floor. The large dome is made of gold finish while the four big domes around are coated in green with reflective illumination. The mosque form is enveloped within a pyramid shape with a square base and 45 inclinations for the faces. It has four accessible minarets, each standing at a height of 150 feet. Moreover, all the dilapidated domes and minarets with mosaic finishing were restored and finished with cut-to-size marble. The exterior and interior are covered by special marble while the expanded courtyard was constructed with heat-absorbing granite (marble) finish. The doors and windows were replaced with specially designed ones befitting the new mosque concept.

== 2019 Flood Crisis ==
In Ilorin City, on 18 September 2019, a flood caused by a heavy downpour ruined valuables worth millions of naira. According to information obtained by &quot;The Nigerian Tribune&quot;, inhabitants of the state capital experienced great difficulty and losses as a result of the deluge, which began at 5:00pm and lasted until about 9:00pm.

Additionally, it was learned that many residents of the impacted buildings along Obbo and Unity roads in Ilorin remained inside until 19 September 2019 afternoon because they were unable to leave the water that had engulfed their structures.

== Pollution ==
Ilorin, a capital city in Kwara State is taken over by heaps of refuse in major streets. This is as a result of Kwara State Waste Management inability to evacuate garbage bins. The bins, stationed at designated points across the city, were full to the brim, thereby forcing residents to dump refuse by the roadside and walkways. The health implication as failure to evacuate the refuse could provoke an outbreak of diseases as a result of abandoned refuse containers by the roadside until they emitted stinking odour into the atmosphere, causing serious discomfort to the residents.

<text>Ge or G (“ê¬†“ë; italics: &quot;“ê&quot;¬†&quot;“ë&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It is part of the Ukrainian alphabet, the Pannonian Rusyn alphabet and both the Carpathian Rusyn alphabets, and also some variants of the Urum and Belarusian (i.e. Belarusian Classical Orthography) alphabets. In these languages it is usually called &quot;ge&quot;, while the letter it follows, ‚ü®–ì¬†–≥‚ü©, is called &quot;he&quot;.

The letterform of this letter is based on the letterform of the letter ‚ü®–ì¬†–≥‚ü©, but its handwritten and italic lowercase forms do not follow the italic modification of ‚ü®–≥‚ü©: &quot;–≥&quot;.

It represents the voiced velar plosive , like the pronunciation of ‚ü®g‚ü© in &quot;go&quot;.

The letter ‚ü®“ë‚ü© is usually romanized using the Latin letter &quot;g&quot;, or sometimes &quot;ƒ°&quot; with a dot or &quot;gÃÄ&quot; with a grave accent.

In the Unicode system for text encoding, the characters representing this letter are called (code point ) and (), while the unmodified characters representing the letter ‚ü®–≥‚ü© are called and ( and ).

== History ==
The common Slavic voiced velar plosive is represented in most Cyrillic orthographies by ‚ü®–ì‚ü©, called –≥–µ, &quot;ge&quot;, in most languages. In Ukrainian, however, around the early 13th century, the sound lenited to the voiced velar fricative (except in the cluster *zg), and around the 16th century, debuccalized to the voiced glottal fricative . The phoneme continued to be represented by ‚ü®–ì‚ü©, called –≥–µ, &quot;he&quot;, in Ukrainian.

Within a century after this sound change began, was re-introduced from Western European loanwords. Since then, it has been represented by several different notations in writing.

In early Belarusian and Ukrainian orthographies, Latin ‚ü®g‚ü© or the Cyrillic digraph ‚ü®–∫–≥‚ü© (&quot;kh&quot;) were sometimes used for the sound of Latin ‚ü®g‚ü© in assimilated words. The first text to consequently employ the letter ‚ü®“ë‚ü© was the 16th-century Peresopnytsia Gospel. The use of the letter was not confined to the Old- and Middle-Ukrainian-speaking territory, and there was a fully-fledged use in the 16th-century printer Pyotr Mstislavets&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Four Gospels&quot;. Later, distinguishing of the sound and using the digraph gradually disappeared from Belarusian orthography.

As far as linguistic studies are concerned, the letter ‚ü®“ë‚ü© was first introduced into the Slavic alphabet in 1619 by Meletius Smotrytsky in his &quot;Slavic Grammar&quot; &quot;(–ì—Ä–∞–º–º–∞—Ç—ñ–∫–∏ —Å–ª–∞–≤—î–Ω—Å–∫–∏—ß –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–Ω–æ—î –°—µ–Ω—Ç–∞“ë–º–∞)&quot;. Later, for an identical purpose, it was saved in the new orthography of Ukrainian.

The letter ‚ü®“ë‚ü© was officially eliminated from the Ukrainian alphabet in the Soviet orthographic reforms of 1933, to bring the Ukrainian language closer to Russian, its function being subsumed into that of the letter ‚ü®–≥‚ü©, pronounced in Ukrainian as . However, ‚ü®“ë‚ü© continued to be used by Ukrainians in Galicia (part of Poland until 1939) and in the Ukrainian diaspora worldwide, who all continued to follow the Kharkiv orthography of 1928 (the so-called &quot;skrypnykivka&quot;, after Mykola Skrypnyk). It was reintroduced to Soviet Ukraine in a 1990 orthographic reform under glasnost, just before independence in 1991. A 2017 study of legal documents found that the letter had returned to active usage in Ukraine.

In Belarusian, the plosive realization of the Proto-Slavic voiced velar plosive has been preserved root-internally in the consonant clusters ‚ü®–∑–≥‚ü©, ‚ü®–∂–≥‚ü©, ‚ü®–¥–∑–≥‚ü©, and ‚ü®–¥–∂–≥‚ü© (in words such as &quot;–º–∞–∑–≥—ñ&quot; , &quot;–≤—ç–¥–∑–≥–∞—Ü—å&quot; or &quot;–¥–∂–≥–∞—Ü—å&quot; but not on a morphological boundary, as in &quot;–∑–≥–∞–¥–∞—Ü—å&quot; , in which is a prefix). It is present in common loanwords such as &quot;–≥–∞–Ω–∞–∫&quot; , &quot;–≥—É–∑—ñ–∫&quot; , or &quot;–≥–∞–Ω–¥–∞–ª—å&quot; . In the 20th century, some Belarusian linguists, notably Jan Stankieviƒç, promoted both the reintroduction of the practice of pronouncing Latin ‚ü®g‚ü©, at least in newly assimilated words, and the adoption of the letter ‚ü®“ë‚ü© to represent it. However, consensus on this has never been reached, and the letter has never been part of the standard Belarusian alphabet and saw only sporadic periods of use. For example, a code of alternative Belarusian orthography rules, based on the proposal of Vincuk Viaƒçorka and published in 2005, has the optional letter ‚ü®“ë‚ü© included in the alphabet, but it can be replaced by ‚ü®–≥‚ü©.

== Usage in Slavic languages ==

=== Belarusian ===
The letter “ë next to –≥ is used in the so-called &quot;Tara≈°kievica&quot; - the classical spelling of the Belarusian language.

An attempt to differentiate in writing the transmission of sounds /…£/ and /g/, using along with the letter –ì, –≥, a special letter “ê, “ë, which differed in size and shape, took place in the history of the Old Belarusian language.

In A. Jelsky&#x27;s publication in 1895, a new sign was introduced for the fricative /…£/ inherent in the Belarusian language, in contrast to the Russian breakthrough [g]. The new letter –≥Ãë differed in contours from the letter –ì, –≥ by the presence of a diacritical mark in the form of a bracket bent downwards. In the publication of folklore and ethnographic work by A.K. Serzhputovsky in 1911, the sign “ê, “ë with a curved upward horizontal line was proposed for the same purpose. The same sign was used in the alphabet of Kupala&#x27;s collection in 1908 and became part of the alphabet approved by the first normative grammar of the Belarusian language by Branislaw Tarashkyevich, only with a different purpose - to convey a sonorous soft palate breakthrough /g/. But in 1933 the letter “ê, “ë, was excluded from the Belarusian alphabet, as well as from the Ukrainian one.

==== Belarusian Classical Orthography ====
¬ß¬†61. G When adopting foreign proper names, explosive /g/ can be transmitted through a letter “ë (‚Äú“ë–µ‚Äù): &quot;“ê—ñ—ë–º, “ê–∞—Å–∫–æ–Ω—å&quot; etc.

In the literary Belarusian language, an explosive sound /g/ (and its soft equivalent /g ≤/) pronounced in Belarusian sound combinations zÃ™g], dÕ°zÃûg], dÕ° êg]: &quot;–≤–æ[–∑“ë]—Ä—ã&quot;, &quot;–º–∞[–∑“ë‚Äô]—ñ&quot;, &quot;—Ä–æ[–∑“ë‚Äô]—ñ&quot;, &quot;–∞–±—Ä—ã[–∑“ë]–ª—ã&quot;, &quot;–±—Ä–∞[–∑“ë]–∞—Ü—å&quot;, &quot;–ø–ª—è–≤—É[–∑“ë]–∞—Ü—å&quot;, &quot;–≤—ç[–¥–∑“ë]–∞—Ü—å&quot;, &quot;[–¥–∂“ë]–∞—Ü—å&quot; and in a number of borrowed words: &quot;[“ë]–∞–Ω–∞–∫&quot;, &quot;[“ë]–∞—Ä—Å—ç—Ç&quot;, &quot;[“ë]–≤–∞–ª—Ç&quot;, &quot;[“ë]–∑—ã–º—Å&quot;, &quot;[“ë]–æ–Ω—Ç–∞&quot;, &quot;[“ë]—É–∑—ñ–∫&quot;, &quot;–∞[“ë]—Ä—ç—Å—Ç&quot;, &quot;[“ë‚Äô]–µ—Ä[“ë‚Äô]–µ—Ç–∞—Ü—å&quot;, &quot;—Ü—É[“ë]–ª—ñ&quot;, &quot;—à–≤–∞[“ë‚Äô]–µ—Ä&quot; etc. This marked the beginning of the restoration in the twentieth century of the use of the letter “ë, which was used in the Old Belarusian language.

In proper names with a non-Slavic lexical basis, explosive /g/ is traditionally pronounced in Belarusian as fricative /…£/; preservation of /g/ in pronunciation does not qualify as a violation of the orthoepic norm: &quot;[–ì]–∞—Ä—ã–±–∞–ª—å–¥–∑—ñ&quot; and &quot;[“ê]–∞—Ä—ã–±–∞–ª—å–¥–∑—ñ&quot;, &quot;[–ì]—Ä—ç–Ω–ª—è–Ω–¥—ã—è&quot; and &quot;[“ê]—Ä—ç–Ω–ª—è–Ω–¥—ã—è&quot;, &quot;[–ì‚Äô]—ë—Ç—ç&quot; and &quot;[“ê‚Äô]—ë—Ç—ç&quot;, &quot;[–ì‚Äô]—ñ–±—Ä–∞–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ä&quot; and &quot;[“ê‚Äô]—ñ–±—Ä–∞–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ä&quot;.

The sound g] in Belarusian also exists in place of etymological k] before voiced consonants, as a result of assimilation. This assimilation is not reflected in writing, so the letter –∫ is used in this case: &quot;–∞–Ω—ç–∫–¥–æ—Ç, –≤–∞–∫–∑–∞–ª, –ø–∞–∫–≥–∞—û–∑, —ç–∫–∑–∞–º—ç–Ω, —ç–∫—Å–≥—É–º–∞—Ü—ã—è&quot;.

=== Ukrainian ===
The letter “ê “ë in the Ukrainian language represents the voiced velar plosive /g/.

It is usually romanized as the letter &quot;g&quot; (while the letter –ì –≥ is transliterated as &quot;h&quot;, and Cyrillic –• —Ö as &quot;kh&quot; or &quot;ch&quot;). Some European standards use &quot;ƒ°&quot; with a dot or &quot;gÃÄ&quot; with a grave accent (see Preu√üische Instruktionen, ISO 9).

It is still the rarest letter of the Ukrainian language, used only in a handful of native and long-borrowed words and toponyms of Ukraine. Transliterations and loanwords containing this sound still use the letter –ì, and may also be pronounced with /h/.

<text>Richard Reeves Brodie (born November 10, 1959) is an American computer programmer and author. He wrote the first version of Microsoft Word. After leaving Microsoft, he became a motivational speaker and authored two books.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Brodie was born in Newton, Massachusetts, the elder son of Mary Ann Brodie and Richard Brodie, a child psychologist. He graduated from Newton South High School and entered Harvard College in the fall of 1977, concentrating in applied mathematics with an emphasis on computer science. He left Harvard after his sophomore year and moved to Palo Alto, CA to work for Xerox Corporation&#x27;s Advanced Systems Division (ASD), where he met Charles Simonyi and helped develop the Bravo X word processor for the Alto computer. Simonyi became a mentor to Brodie at Xerox and took him along when he moved to Microsoft in 1981.

===Microsoft===
Simonyi hired Brodie in 1981 as Microsoft&#x27;s 77th employee and a founding member of the Microsoft Application Division.

Brodie distinguished himself at Microsoft by creating the first version of Microsoft Word in less than seven months. In addition to primary authorship of Microsoft Word, he wrote Microsoft&#x27;s first C compiler, the original version of Notepad, and Word for the IBM PC Jr.

Brodie&#x27;s success as a programmer brought him to the attention of Bill Gates, who made Brodie his technical assistant in 1983. Brodie&#x27;s primary accomplishment as Gates&#x27;s assistant was the management of the Cashmere project, which was released as Word for Windows.
During the Cashmere design, Brodie came up with the idea of the Combo box (a combination text box and drop-down menu widely used today), the Ribbon (a strip of buttons at the top of the screen used to display and change formatting), and the squiggly red underline that checks and flags spelling errors automatically. 

Brodie left Microsoft after the company went public in 1986, but returned in 1991 as Chief Software Designer and Lead Developer of the Omega project, which was released as Microsoft Access in 1992. He left Microsoft again in 1994.

===After leaving Microsoft===
Between his stints at Microsoft, Brodie embarked on a self-improvement quest, taking numerous courses and participating in retreats, seeking an answer to &quot;why money and success didn‚Äôt make me happy.&quot; He wrote about his experience in his first book, &quot;Getting Past OK: The Self-Help Book for People Who Don‚Äôt Need Help&quot;, first published in 1993. It became a regional bestseller and was republished by Warner Books. He followed it with &quot;Virus of the Mind&quot; (1995), which explored the new field of memetics from a practical point of view. Hay House bought the rights to both books and currently publishes them in many languages worldwide.

Brodie spoke about his books on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and &quot;Phil Donahue&quot;.

===Poker player===
Apart from his careers as a programmer and author, Brodie has found creative ways to integrate his love of sports and games into his professional life. In 2003 he joined the professional poker circuit. He has finished in the money in five World Series of Poker events and six World Poker Tours. Until Black Friday, he played as a Full Tilt Poker pro under the screen name Quiet Lion. He appeared on NBC&#x27;s game show &quot;Identity&quot; and played himself in the movie &quot;The Grand&quot;.

In 2023, Brodie bested 440 players on his way to winning the 32nd annual World Recreational Gambling Poker Tournament (WRGPT) after 221 days of play. His efforts earned him $0 and an immutable place in poker history. 

Brodie currently resides in Kirkland, Washington.

<doc id="596886" wikidata="Q2745682" url="?curid=596886" title="Giacomo Andrea da Ferrara">
<text>Giacomo Andrea da Ferrara (also known as Iacomo Andrea; died May 12, 1500) was an architect from Ferrara and the author on a commentary on Vitruvius. Very little is known about him; his name did not appear on any buildings in Milan.

Luca Pacioli wrote that Giacomo Andrea was almost like a brother to Leonardo da Vinci. Giacomo Andrea, active by the 1480s, drew a prototypical &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; which may have served as the basis for Leonardo&#x27;s drawing, or have been conceived alongside it as a collaborative effort.

Giacomo Andrea was very loyal to the Sforza family. After the occupation of Milan by the French, he is said to have plotted against the French. He was put on trial and sentenced to death. Archbishop Pallavicini attempted to plead for his innocence. Giacomo Andrea was publicly beheaded on May 12, 1500. His body was quartered and placed on four different gates of the city. Leonardo da Vinci did not plot against the French, but instead went into their service.

<doc id="596892" wikidata="Q731977" url="?curid=596892" title="Combined Cadet Force">
<text>The Combined Cadet Force (CCF) is a youth organisation in the United Kingdom, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence (MOD), which operates in schools, sub divided into Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Army and Royal Air Force sections. Its aim is to &quot;provide a disciplined organisation in a school so that pupils may develop powers of leadership by means of training to promote the qualities of responsibility, self reliance, resourcefulness, endurance and perseverance&quot;.

One of its objectives is &quot;to encourage those who have an interest in the services to become Officers of the Regular or Reserve Forces&quot;, and a significant number of British military officers have had experience in the CCF.

Before 1948, cadet forces in schools existed as the junior division of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps framework, but in 1948 Combined Cadet Force was formed covering cadets affiliated to all three services. As of 2019, there were 42,720 cadets and 3,370 Adult Volunteers. The MOD provides approximately ¬£28M per year of funding to the CCF. There are approximately 500 contingents (the name for each school or college&#x27;s CCF) in the UK.

Although sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, the CCF is not part of the British Armed Forces or Reserve Forces; as such, cadets are not subject to military &#x27;call up&#x27;. Some cadets do, however, go on to join the armed forces later in life, and many of the organisation&#x27;s leaders have been cadets or have a military background.

== History ==
On 12 May 1859, the Secretary of State for War, Jonathan Peel, sent out a circular letter to the public schools and universities inviting them to form units of the Volunteer Corps. The first school cadet corps was established at Rossall School in February 1860, initially as an army contingent only. Felsted already had an armed drill contingent at the time of the War Office letter under the command of Sgt. Major Rogers RM; its claim on these grounds to be the oldest school corps was upheld by Field Marshal Earl Roberts in a letter to the Headmaster of 1904. In February 1861 the Oxford City Rifle Cadet Corps was founded, with five companies, the first of which was composed of pupils of the Linden House School, a private school in Headington, and the second composed of pupils from Magdalen College School. In 1908, the units were re-titled the Officer Training Corps (OTC).

The CCF was created in 1948 by the amalgamation of the Junior Training Corps (formerly the Junior Division of the Officers Training Corps) and the school contingents of the Sea Cadet Corps and Air Training Corps. CCFs are still occasionally referred to as &quot;The Corps&quot;.
A school contingent may have any combination of Royal Navy, Army, Royal Air Force and sometimes Royal Marines sections, the army section is almost invariably the largest.

=== Independent and state schools ===
The CCF movement used to be dominated by the independent sector with 200 contingents being based in independent schools with only around 60 in state schools. Since the Cadet Expansion Programme was launched in 2012 the number of contingents has reached 500, beating the target set by the government. There are now more contingents in the state sector than in the independent sector. The expansion was funded by ¬£50m from the fines arising from the LIBOR scandal.

It was reported in 2008 that some independent school CCF detachments would be opened to pupils of local state schools One case of a fee-charging school allowing state school pupils to join the cadet force was Aldenham School in Watford, Hertfordshire linking its Cadet Force with the nearby state school Queens&#x27; School to form a joint Cadet force.

=== Investigation into sexual abuse ===
In 2012 payouts made to victims of sexual abuse across all Cadet Forces, including the CCF, totalled ¬£1,475,844. In 2013 payouts totalled ¬£64,782, and in 2014 payouts totalled ¬£544,213.

=== Identity ===
CCF Contingents are part of the CCF, but are also part of their own school and as such are semi-autonomous organisations, run by internal school or school-related staff, supported by armed forces personnel. Army sections may wear their own capbadge. Royal Navy and Royal Air Force sections wear the appropriate RN/RAF other rank and officer capbadges.

The CCF is separate from the Community Cadet Forces namely the Sea Cadet Corps, the Army Cadet Force and the Air Training Corps, and the Volunteer Cadet Corps. Pupils normally join at the age of 12 or 13 (Year 8), or later at the discretion of the Head, with both sexes able to take part.

== Uniform ==
=== Royal Navy Section ===

They may be issued with combat uniform if required and some schools have No 1 uniform for senior cadets. Number 3 uniform is normally the parade uniform for the CCF (RN) and consists of a white shirt, black tie, blue trousers, and blue heavy wool jersey, worn with plain black shoes; a brassard (armband) should be worn on the right arm, displaying qualification badges. Number 4 uniform is the standard working uniform of the Royal Navy, in one form or another it has been in existence for over 60 years. This uniform is fire-retardant and consists of a blue shirt, blue trousers, blue heavy wool jersey, beret, with CCF badge and black boots.

==== Royal Marines Section ====
Royal Marines sections wear the bronzed Royal Marines cap badge of other ranks with a red &quot;tombstone&quot; backing on a blue beret with MTP (Multi-Terrain Pattern) clothing, and either brown or black boots. They may also wear a version of No.1 Ceremonial Uniform with Cadet insignia for special occasions.

=== Army Section ===
Working uniform

The Army Section dress regulations are set out in Army Dress Regulations, Part 8 (Cadets). and Cadets wear the No. 8 Combat Dress - Multi-Terrain Pattern (MTP) uniform (&#x27;combats&#x27;) for most occasions.

All cadets wear a rank slide with the word &quot;CADET&quot; in embroidered red capital letters at the top, any rank is then shown underneath in black. Cadets may be given permission to wear a stable belt of CCF, school, or affiliated unit pattern. Cadet Force Adult Volunteers (CFAVs) wear rank slides with &quot;CCF&quot; underneath.

Tactical Recognition Flashes are not to be worn by CFAVs or cadets of the Combined Cadet Force, irrespective of any affiliation to a Corps or Regiment. Cadets and CFAVs do wear county and contingent flashes. 
Ceremonial uniform

No. 2 Dress (also known as &quot;Future Army Dress&quot; (FAD)) is not issued to Cadets or CFAV but may be worn.

Evening Dress

Mess Dress is also worn, by CFAVs only and at personal expense only, it is not an issued item. Rank (depending on regimental custom) is sometimes worn, but a &quot;CCF&quot; pin must be worn.

=== Royal Air Force Section ===

RAF cadets wear a version of the RAF No.2 dress. This consists of either light blue shirt and tie or a dark &quot;working&quot; blue shirt, blue-grey trousers or skirt/slacks, a blue-grey jumper: V-neck or round neck version, and an RAF blue beret with the RAF cap badge. They also wear a brassard to distinguish themselves as cadets. Except for the cap badge and brassard badge, this is identical to the uniform of the ATC and regulations for its wear can be found in ACP1358. Most RAF sections wear combat clothing, formerly the CS95 DPM standard, but many now wear Multi-terrain pattern uniform (MTP). Officers, Adult Warrant Officers and Senior Non-Commissioned Officers and cadets wear RAFAC Cadet formation flash.

== Cadets ==


The &quot;MOD Sponsored Cadet Forces Statistics&quot; are published annually. Statistics are provided for the Community Cadets (the Sea Cadet Corps and Volunteer Cadet Corps (VCC), Army Cadet Force (ACF) and Air Training Corps (ATC)) and the Combined Cadet Force. The Volunteer Cadet Corps (VCC) is included in these statistics for the first time, as its status changed to become the fifth MOD sponsored cadet force in 2017.

=== Number of CCF Cadets (nationwide) ===
The strength of CCF, both Cadets and CFAVs is published every year by the Office for National Statistics, usually in April.

In November 2019 the Government announced that it had achieved its target of 500 contingents under the Cadet Expansion Programme (CEP)

=== Cadet ranks ===

All cadet ranks are standard non-commissioned ranks, prefixed by &quot;Cadet&quot;. The highest rank depends on the size of the contingent, but are usually Cadet Regimental Sergeant Major, (Army and RM Sections) and Cadet Warrant Officer (RN and RAF Sections). 
Some contingents may have Junior (and sometimes Senior) Under Officers. Cadet Under Officers&#x27; rank badges are blue bands 12¬†mm wide across each shoulder slide, with the addition of the letters CCF underneath.

Cadets are promoted on their level of experience and their level of commitment to the cadet force. Also cadets are promoted on excellence or merit. Senior cadets&#x27; duty is to help the running of parades etc. and to help their Contingent Commander or another officer of their contingent.

The Naval Cadet that is in command of the naval section is also addressed as Coxswain.

Army cadets ranks share associated regiment&#x27;s equivalent rank title (e.g. Corporal in the Royal Artillery becomes Bombardier.)

== Cadet Force adult volunteers (CFAV) ==
Cadet Force Adult Volunteers (CFAVs), who are the uniformed civilian staff that work in the school contingents, provide training to the cadets. Unlike the other cadet organisations (ATC/SCC/ACF), most adult volunteers are commissioned officers, the exception often being the School Staff Instructor (see below) and the newer position of Sergeant Instructor (SI).

=== CCF Officers ===
CCF officers are not members of the armed forces and are usually teachers or other school staff. As such they are not subject to military law, but are subject to CCF Regulations they are subordinate to officers in the Armed Forces whether Regular or Reserve. Until 2017 CCF (Army) and CCF (RAF) officers were in special categories of the reserves of their service whereas CCF (RN) Officers were &#x27;appointed&#x27; and did not hold commissions. However, on 1 December 2017, the Cadet Forces Commission was introduced and since then this type of commission has been held by all CCF officers.

=== Training ===
* Officers in the Naval section of the CCF, undertake the six day CCF Royal Navy officer induction course training at Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. It is commanded by a course officer (regular Naval Service) and at least two CFAVs to assist. The training is delivered by regular sailors.
* Similar to officers in the Army Cadet Force, CCF (Army) officers attend the Cadet Forces Commissions Board of the Army Officer Selection Board and must be approved by the Headmaster of the employing school and confirmed by the relevant Army Brigade in order to attend. Prospective officers may be appointed as an &quot;Adult Under Officer&quot;, awaiting commissioning.
* CCF (RAF) officers attend the RAFAC Command and Leadership course and undertake the five day RAF Air Cadets Officers and NCO&#x27;s combined Initial Course at RAF College Cranwell, as Acting Pilot Officer. Upon successful completion of the course, they are awarded their Cadet Forces Commission. Their rank slides are similar to their RAF counterparts, with the addition of the text &#x27;RAF Air Cadets&#x27; underneath the displayed rank.

All CCF adult induction/basic/initial courses cover the basic skills needed for CFAVs who wish to serve in the CCF, such as drill and turnout, leadership and teamwork tasks, weapon training, navigation, etc.

=== School Staff Instructors (SSI) ===
Supporting officers in the running of the Contingent is the School Staff Instructor (SSI) - usually a retired Senior Non-commissioned Officer (SNCO) or Warrant Officer. Although they are civilians, they retain their rank as a courtesy and are employed by the school to instruct and assist in the running of the Contingent.

Whilst the majority of the SSIs are (former) SNCOs it is also possible for them to be a Cadet Forces commissioned officer. There is usually only one SSI per Contingent and they are also supported by other external staff, including the RN&#x27;s Area Instructors, various Brigade Cadet Training Teams (CTTs) and RAF TEST SNCOs.

=== Civilian Instructors (CI) ===
Like the community cadet forces, some Contingents may have one or more Civilian Instructors (CI). These are adult volunteers who may instruct in either a specialist (first aid, signals, etc.) or more generalised role when the establishment level of officers does not include sufficient suitably qualified and experienced personnel to teach these subjects. Many are members of staff at the school.

=== Adult Strength ===
The strength of CCF CFAVs is published every year by the Office for National Statistics, usually in April. At 1 April 2020 it was:

=== Officer ranks ===
CCF (RN) ranks are almost the same as for RN (and RNR) officers (with the post-nominals &#x27;RNR&#x27; used only in writing, not on insignia) but their rank braid is &#x27;wavy&#x27; as used in the past by the RNVR.

CCF (Army) officers are required to wear a &quot;CCF&quot; title on their rank slides, epaulettes, or other part of their uniform as appropriate in addition to any insignia of affiliated Army regiment or corps. Some contingents may also have the school or college name on rank slides.

CCF (RAF) Officers wear &#x27;RAF Air Cadets&#x27; on their rank sides, as although they are CCF, they are part of the wider &quot;Air Cadets&quot; family.

Since the introduction of the Cadet Forces Commission, ranks do not indicate membership of the British Armed Forces.

== Cadet training ==
Each of the CCF sections have different syllabi with a degree of overlap. All the sections learn drill and all cadets are trained to fire the L98A2 5.56¬†mm Cadet General Purpose rifle, a semi-automatic only version of the L85A2 used by the UK armed forces. There are also opportunities to fire the L144 A1 Cadet Small Bore Target Rifle (CSBTR) and the L81 Cadet Target Rifle.

=== Royal Navy section ===

Cadets in the Royal Navy section receive instruction in boat-work and other naval subjects (including flying with the Fleet Air Arm). The Royal Navy also offers many CCF courses during the school holidays which are open to any members of any CCF.

==== Royal Marine Section ====
The Royal Marines section, although a part of the Navy, tend to train independently, covering battle drills, weapons handling and marksmanship, fieldcraft, camouflage and concealment and the history of the Royal Marines.

=== Army section ===
The Army section follows the Army Proficiency Certificate (APC) subjects such as drill and turnout, skill at arms, shooting, map and compass, fieldcraft and first aid.Army Cadets get the option to attend specialist to arm courses such as Combat Information Systems (CIS) at Blandford giving them skills in radio, semaphore and morse code. As each school comes under a brigade area most run fieldcraft competitions such as Black Rat formally run by 4Bde. CCF Army Sections also have the opportunity to train in specialist areas and gain badges that represent that proficiency, examples include Royal Artillery, Infantry, Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers. These can be delivered by local reserve units in support of the school or by courses put on by regular Army units.

=== Royal Air Force section ===
As CCF (RAF) sections form part of the larger Royal Air Force Air Cadets, they are eligible to undertake the same syllabus and training opportunities as the Air Training Corps:
RAF section cadets are given the opportunity to fly in both powered aircraft, most notably the Grob Tutor and in unpowered gliders such as the Grob Viking; their training and flying courses are identical to those available to members of the Air Training Corps. Cadets can also be involved in a multitude of battle training and tactics as well as opportunities to fly in various aircraft from the RAF and allied nations. The section also learn about aerospace management, aircraft structure and propulsion, engineering, air power doctrine as well as an opportunity to see how most RAF stations, sections and wings or squadrons operate. As well as practical learning, RAF cadets also follow an academic syllabus. Cadets are usually taught &quot;Part 1&quot; before being expected to complete Parts 2 - 4 by themselves through the medium of Bader Learn. Completing Part 4, also known as the Master Cadet Award, leads to a BTEC Level 2 in Aerospace Studies (accredited by Pearson) being awarded, although CCF cadets, unlike those in the ATC, have to pay to receive this BTEC.

Cadets may also take part in regional and national competitions, such as the Air Squadron Trophy Competition.

=== Further training ===
All sections can undertake leadership courses as well as adventurous training. There are also other courses available for cadets to enhance their skills, such as Junior and Senior Cadet Instructor Courses (JCIC, SCIC) and Method of Instruction (MOI).

<text>The University Officers&#x27; Training Corps (UOTC), also known as the Officers&#x27; Training Corps (OTC), are British Army reserve units, under the command of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, which recruit exclusively from universities and focus on training and developing leadership. Their role is to allow university students the opportunity to undertake modules of Reserve Officer training designed to fit around their degree and to develop the leadership abilities, skills and experience of their members, which could be useful in a future career in the British Army, or skills and training that can be utilised in a civilian career. While in the UOTC, Officer Cadets will undertake the Reserve Officer Training Modules (Alpha &amp; Bravo). 

UOTC personnel are part of the Army Reserve and are attested and paid when on duty. They are classed as Group B (Non Deployable). Officer cadets (OF-D) have no obligation to pursue a further career in the armed forces when they leave university and can resign from the UOTC at any time. UOTCs are led by officers and non-commissioned officers from the Regular Army and Army Reserve.

Each UOTC unit is effectively an independent regiment (since 2011, four UOTCs are in joint units, Leeds UOTC and Sheffield UOTC form the Yorkshire Officers&#x27; Training Regiment, and Liverpool UOTC and Manchester and Salford UOTC form the North West Officers&#x27; Training Regiment) with its own cap badge and other insignia, its own stable belt and its own customs and traditions.

UOTCs also organise non-military outdoor pursuits such as hill walking and mountaineering as well as fielding teams in other sports which compete against other UOTCs and regiments, there is also opportunity for Officer cadets to represent the army in sports.

==History==
===General history of the units===
The emergence of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps as a distinct unit began in 1906, when the Secretary of State for War, Lord Haldane, first appointed a committee to consider the problem of the shortage of officers in the Militia, the Volunteer Force, the Yeomanry, and the Reserve of Officers. The committee recommended that an Officers&#x27; Training Corps be formed. The Corps was to be in two divisions: a junior division in public schools and a senior division in the universities. In October 1908, therefore, authorised by Army Order 160 of July 1908, as part the Haldane Reforms of the Reserve forces, the contingents were formally established as the Officers&#x27; Training Corps and incorporated into the new Territorial Force, which was created by the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907.

During the First World War, the OTCs became officer producing units and some 20,577 officers and 12,290 other ranks were recruited from the OTCs between August
1914 and March 1915. The Munich Crisis saw a huge increase in recruitment to military units generally and OTCs in particular as large numbers of people volunteered for military service in the prelude to the Second World War. At the start of the Second World War the UOTCs became Senior Training Units (STCs) and their membership automatically joined the Home Guard and in 1948 they became University Training Units (UTCs).

From 1910 to 1922, Dublin University Officers&#x27; Training Corps recruited students at Trinity College Dublin, reinforcing the university&#x27;s reputation at the time as a stronghold of Irish unionism and opposition to Home Rule. During the 1916 Easter Rising, Trinity College was targeted by the Volunteer and Citizen Army forces, but was successfully defended by a small number of unionist students, most of whom were UOTC officer cadets, as well as some staff. In the first meeting of the College Board following the Easter Rising, the Provost, J. P. Mahaffy, proposed a resolution expressing gratitude to those who had defended the university. In July that year, Dublin UOTC were offered, as a further gesture of thanks, the gift of a silver cup by the Ulster Unionist MP for Dublin University, Sir Edward Carson; the cup was ultimately gifted to the university itself in trust for its UOTC. Eventually, Dublin UOTC was disbanded following the partition of Ireland.

In 1948, the senior OTC divisions became part of the Territorial Army (Now called the Army Reserve), and women were accepted for the first time with the formation of Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps sub-units. Women are now fully integrated into all sections. The junior divisions, by then renamed the Junior Training Corps, became the Army Sections of the Combined Cadet Force. The units became University Officers&#x27; Training Corps (UOTCs) again in 1955.

There are now fifteen UOTCs and two Officer Training Regiments (OTRs) throughout the United Kingdom, each of which serves the universities and Army Reserve units in a distinct geographic area. Those serving larger areas may have several detachments. Each UOTC is effectively an independent regiment, with its own cap badge, its own stable belt, and its own customs and traditions. UOTC members hold the rank of Officer cadet (OCdt), and are members of the Army Reserve, paid when on duty. They are not classed as trained ranks, and do not hold a Commission therefore they cannot be mobilised for active service and are classed as Group B reservists during their time in the UOTC. Being classed as untrained strength meaning remuneration does not attract X Factor and is not pensionable. Officer cadets can gain appointments as a Junior Under Officer (JUO), a Company Under Officer (CUO), or a Senior Under Officer (SUO) and can also apply to the Army Officer Selection Board (AOSB), which, if they pass, leads to the opportunity to complete the Army Reserve Commissioning Course with the goal of commissioning as a second lieutenant.

==Selection and training==
Each UOTC Unit have a similar processes of joining, that begins with the candidate finding the UOTC that recruits from their university and getting in contact with them through their page on the Army website or at their university&#x27;s freshers fair and apply. UOTCs also conduct interviews and selection events to narrow down the list of candidates who applied. Candidates also need to undertake a British Army Medical Assessment and have the basic standard of fitness expected by the British Army.

The overview of the training officer cadets receive is:

=== Year one: Basic training (MOD Alpha) ===
Officer Cadets under take the Reserve Officer Training Module Alpha. This involves instruction in all basic military techniques, including drill, map reading, camouflage, first aid, weapons training, small unit tactics, radio procedure, and fieldcraft.

===Year two: Leadership training (MOD Bravo) ===
Having learnt how to be a member of an effective military team, the second year teaches the Reserve Officer Training Module Bravo. Officer Cadets learn how to manage soldiers, equipment, and the battlefield. This involves everything from planning an attack, to giving effective orders and ensuring they are carried out and from directing a constructive debrief after an exercise to ensuring the welfare of all of those under command.

===Year three: Leadership in action===
This year Senior Officer Cadets may hold appointments in their UOTC Unit such as Junior Under Officer and Senior Under Officer, and will mentor the less experienced Officer Cadets completing MOD A and MOD B. Some Officer cadets choose to go forward to the Army Officer Selection Board, to seek a commission from Sandhurst in either the Regular Army or Army Reserve. For those who choose the Reserve route, they can complete their reserve commission after successful completion of the AOSB by undertaking the remaining training required, which can only be completed on short courses (two weeks per remaining module or in an eight-week short course) at Sandhurst. For those who seek a Regular commission, they must undertake the full regular commissioning course which takes 42 weeks at Sandhurst.

There is no obligation for Officer Cadets of the UOTC, to go to AOSB and finish the Reserve officer, Commissioning Course, or undertake the Regular Commissioning Course. and some choose to not continue training with the Armed Forces after University. 

== Command and control ==
The overall commander of the UOTC is the Deputy Commandant RMAS (UOTC) an appointment held by a Colonel (OF-5).

== UOTC Units ==

=== Aberdeen ===

The first military unit formed by the University of Aberdeen was a battery of the 1st Aberdeen Volunteer Royal Artillery, raised in December 1885. The battery was officered by members of the university staff and commanded by Captain William Stirling, then professor of physiology. In March 1895, the University Battery was absorbed by the 1st Heavy Battery. In November 1897, an Aberdeen University detachment of the 1st Volunteer Battalion, Gordon Highlanders, was recruited, and in 1898 the detachment became University Company (&quot;U&quot; Company). In 1912, the Aberdeen University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formally raised in response to the recommendations of the committee formed by Lord Haldane under the chairmanship of the then principal Sir George Adam Smith. The War Office authorised the formation of a medical unit and appointed as Commanding Officer Major G A Williamson MA MD DPH.

&quot;U&quot; Company had by this time become part of the 4th Battalion, Gordon Highlanders, and at the outbreak of the First World War was mobilised and sent to France, the only university contingent to go. The story of &quot;U&quot; Company as a fighting unit is told by Alexander Rule in his book &quot;Students Under Arms&quot;.

In February 1924, the War Office authorised the establishment of an infantry unit and the right to wear the Gordon tartan. The infantry unit was commanded initially by Major John Boyd Orr DSO MC (later John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr). The pipe band was instituted in 1924 and became one of the most popular features of the unit. In 1929, the Scots Guards provided the senior warrant officer of the permanent staff and established a Household Division link. In 1935, it was decided that the cap badge, which up to then had been the university crest, should be replaced by the boar&#x27;s head, the family crest of the founder of the university, with the motto &quot;Non Confundar&quot; (&#x27;I shall not be troubled&#x27;).

During the Second World War, the unit expanded as all students of military age who had been granted deferment were required to enroll as part of a National Service obligation. At its peak, the unit was some 491 strong with four infantry companies, two medical companies and a signals section. Throughout the war, the unit in conjunction with the university ran special technical courses for Royal Artillery cadets, of which a total of 427 attended. In February 1943, the unit provided the backbone of the 9th City of Aberdeen (University Home Guard) Battalion, in addition to its normal role.

In October 1948, Medical, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Intelligence, Royal Engineers, Royal Signals and infantry sub-units were formed. As a result of various re-organisations over the years, only the last three sub-units survive today. In 1951, women were allowed to join the UOTC and a Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps sub-unit was formed; this has now been absorbed into the existing three sub-units. The unit is now based at Gordon Barracks in Bridge of Don.

=== Birmingham ===
In 1900 the University of Birmingham raised a company, sanctioned by the War Office, which was known as U Company of the 1st Volunteer Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment. Captain W. E. Bennett, one of the staff of the university, was given the command. The company held its first parade in May 1900, and the occasion was celebrated by the presentation of the Inter-Section Challenge Cup by the chancellor of the university, Joseph Chamberlain. In 1900 the Volunteers, of which U Company was part, were 1,406 strong.

In 1908, the Birmingham University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formally raised in response to the recommendations of the committee formed by Lord Haldane. Field Marshal William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim was a member of the Birmingham UOTC from 1912 to 1914. Birmingham UOTC is based at Montgomery House in Sparkbrook.

=== Bristol ===
In 1910, the Bristol University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formally raised in response to the recommendations of the committee formed by Lord Haldane. Some 1,000 men joined the Bristol UTC during the course of the First World War and, of these, some 105 were killed in action during that war. In 1925 it provided the Guard of honour for the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Bristol to open buildings for the University of Bristol. It undertook its training collectively with other universities until 1928 when it arranged its own annual camp. During the Second World War twenty-one cadets volunteered for immediate service. Bristol UOTC is based at the Artillery Grounds in Whiteladies Road, Bristol.

=== Cambridge ===

Cambridge UOTC claims descent from a unit raised in 1803, when, with Britain under threat of French invasion, undergraduates from the University of Cambridge formed a corps of Volunteers to help defend British shores. Thereafter, the Cambridge University Rifle Volunteers (CURV) was formally raised in 1860. During British involvement in the Second Boer War in 1899 there was a public focus on volunteering for the forces serving in South Africa. In response to this, a detachment was sent to South Africa.

Attached to the Suffolk Regiment, the CURV men reported for duty on 20 January 1900 in Bury St Edmunds. On 11 February, they sailed from Southampton on the SS &quot;Doune Castle&quot;, arriving in Cape Town on 7 March. Initially the Cambridge Volunteers worked as guards on the railway lines around Cape Town, but then marched with the Suffolk Regiment as part of General Bryan Mahon&#x27;s column to attack a Boer position in Barberton in September 1900. With a large welcome home awaiting them, including a service in Great St Mary&#x27;s Church, the volunteers were back in Cambridge on 6 May 1901. All the Volunteers were made Honorary Freemen of the Borough of Cambridge and on 21 December 1904, three years later, CURV was granted the battle honour &quot;South Africa 1900-01&quot;. Cambridge is the only UOTC to have earned a battle honour.

In 1908, Cambridge University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formally raised in response to the recommendations of the committee formed by Lord Haldane and consisted of a battalion of infantry, a squadron of cavalry, a battery of artillery and medical and engineering units. During the First World War, Cambridge UOTC supplied 3,000 officers to the British Army between August 1914 and March 1915: this was more than any other UOTC. During the Second World War, Cambridge UOTC raised the 8th (Cambridge University) Cambridgeshire Battalion of the Cambridgeshire Regiment. Cambridge UOTC is based at the Army Reserve Centre in Coldham&#x27;s Lane, Cambridge.

=== East Midlands ===

The University College Nottingham Officers&#x27; Training Corps was first formed on 27 April 1909 when 27 students from University College Nottingham petitioned the university&#x27;s Senate Council to form a contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps. Their petition was accepted by the War Office and later that same year, the unit was formed.

The names of those who died in both World Wars are recorded on a plaque in the University of Nottingham&#x27;s Trent Building. The name of the unit was changed in 1966 to the &quot;East Midlands Universities Officers&#x27; Training Corps&quot; in a move that allowed volunteers from all higher education institutions in the East Midlands to join.

East Midlands UOTC&#x27;s cap badge is that of the Sherwood Foresters, with replaced wording. As part of the unit&#x27;s historic affiliations with the Sherwood Foresters (since amalgamated into the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment and, later, into 2nd Battalion, Mercian Regiment before it was disbanded in 2022), East Midlands Universities OTC&#x27;s stable belt is horizontally green, maroon and green again, charged with a thin central horizontal silver strip for differentiation known as the &#x27;silver stripe of learning.&#x27; East Midlands UOTC is based at the Army Reserve Centre, Broadgate in Beeston.

=== Edinburgh ===

Edinburgh UOTC has its origins in No. 4 Company of the 1st City of Edinburgh Rifle Volunteer Corps (from 1865 the 1st Queen&#x27;s Edinburgh Rifle Volunteer Brigade), which was raised on 31 August 1859. Some 90 volunteers from the University of Edinburgh joined the company. In 1908, the Edinburgh University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formally raised in response to the recommendations of the committee formed by Lord Haldane (the Haldane Reforms). Haldane was Rector of the University of Edinburgh at the time. &#x27;A&#x27; Company of 3rd Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Edinburgh Rifles, Royal Scots, (the old No 4 Company) and Left Half of 1st Heavy Battery, 1st Edinburgh (City) Royal Garrison Artillery (also populated by members of the university) transferred to the new contingent. Some 2,250 students from the university were commissioned during the First World War.

The unit moved to the former Queen&#x27;s Edinburgh Rifles&#x27; Forrest Hill drill hall in 1957: it became the &quot;Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt Universities OTC&quot; in 1966 and the &quot;City of Edinburgh Universities OTC&quot; in 1993. It moved to Duke of Edinburgh House in Colinton Road, Edinburgh in 1993.

=== Exeter ===
A UOTC was formed in Exeter in the late 1930s, but after supplying officers to the British Army during the Second World War, recruitment fell and the UOTC was placed in suspended animation in November 1947. The UOTC was formed on 1 April 1980 to provide military training for the students of the University of Exeter. Initially based at Higher Barracks, Exeter, the UOTC moved to Wyvern Barracks in February 1988, when Major-General Sir John Acland, its first honorary colonel, opened the Acland Building.

=== Glasgow and Strathclyde ===

The origins of the University of Glasgow&#x27;s links with the military can be traced back to the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745, when companies of Militia were raised to defend the pro-Hanoverian University and the City of Glasgow against the absolutist Highland Jacobites. In 1880s, Glasgow professors such as William John Macquorn Rankine and students formed two infantry companies as part of the local 1st Lanarkshire (Glasgow 1st Western) Rifle Volunteers. This unit later became the 5th Battalion of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), based at West Princes Street drill hall in the Woodlands area of Glasgow.

In 1908, the Glasgow University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formally raised in response to the recommendations of the committee formed by Lord Haldane and consisted of three infantry companies and an engineering company. The new unit was located in its own drill hall at University Place on the Glasgow University campus.

During the First World War, UOTC members were amongst the first to volunteer, and Glasgow UOTC trained many potential officers for Kitchener&#x27;s New Armies. By the summer of 1916, some 2,800 officers had been raised by the university.

In the Second World War, conscription was introduced immediately, and every student was regarded as a potential officer. The UOTC&#x27;s role was to train officers from those University students conscripted into the Army and to provide basic training for those who remained behind as a Home Guard unit. At its height the Corps rose to 1,500 members. Glasgow UOTC remains based at the drill hall in University Place.

=== London ===

In 1909, the London University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formally raised in response to the recommendations of the committee formed by Lord Haldane. By autumn 1914 the University of London had enrolled 950 students in the UOTC. During the First World War, University of London OTC supplied 500 officers to the British Army between August 1914 and March 1915 alone. Some 665 officers, trained by the ULOTC, died during the whole of the First World War and some 245 officers, trained by the ULOTC, died in the Second World War. The University of London OTC is the largest UOTC with about 400 officer cadets. It has been based at Yeomanry House in Handel Street, London since 1992. In 2011, Canterbury Company was founded to recruit officer Cadets from the Kent area.

=== Northumbrian ===

Durham University formed the &quot;K&quot; Company of the 3rd Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers in 1908. With the formation of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps later in that year, this was transferred to the OTC. The UOTC sent a detachment to London to act as part of the Guard of honour at the coronation of King George V in June 1911. Some 2,464 members of Durham University (including Armstrong College and the College of Medicine in Newcastle, both now part of Newcastle University) served in the First World War, with 325 being killed, along with 525 members of Bede College (then an associated college rather than part of the university), of whom 91 were killed. In a serious accident in April 1955, four officer cadets from the UOTC were killed when they were hit by a de Havilland Chipmunk at Otterburn.

Following the creation of Newcastle University (formerly King&#x27;s College, Durham University) in 1963, the unit became the &quot;Northumbrian Universities Officers Training Corps&quot;: it was initially based at the Yeomanry Drill Hall in Northumberland Road in Newcastle, but moved to St George&#x27;s Army Reserve Centre in Sandyford Road, Jesmond in 1975 and then moved again to St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Keep at Holland Drive in Fenham in the 1990s.

=== North West Officers&#x27; Training Regiment ===
==== Liverpool ====
The Liverpool University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formed in 1919 to provide military training for the students of the University of Liverpool. It occupied its own drill hall from 1928 and was re-organised on a faculty basis at the start of the Second World War but was re-unified again in 1955. At the turn of the century it was based at 128 Mount Pleasant in Liverpool but is now based at Crawford Hall in Allerton. Since September 2011 it has formed part of the North West Officers&#x27; Training Regiment.

==== Manchester and Salford ====
In 1898 the University of Manchester raised a company, sanctioned by the War Office, which was known as N Company of the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Manchester Regiment. In 1908 N Company became the Manchester University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps. Some 314 members of Manchester University died in the First World War and another 200 members of the university died in the Second World War. The unit was based at a Drill Hall in Stretford Road, but since 1994, has been based at University Barracks in Boundary Lane, Manchester 15. Since September 2011 it has formed part of the North West Officers&#x27; Training Regiment.

=== Oxford ===

Oxford UOTC claims descent from the bodyguard to Charles I that students of the University of Oxford formed in 1642, during the English Civil War. But the immediate origin of the present body is the 1st Oxfordshire (Oxford University) Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed in 1859 and established (together with many other volunteer corps across the country) in response to the threat of war with France. From 1881, the OURVC served as one of several volunteer battalions of the Oxfordshire Light Infantry and in 1887 it became known as the 1st (Oxford University) Volunteer Battalion or the Oxford University Volunteers (OUV).

In 1908, the Oxford University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formally raised in response to the recommendations of the committee formed by Lord Haldane. From 1912 to 1918, the Oxford OTC was commanded by John Stenning, a fellow of Wadham College, Oxford. In September 1914, at the start of the First World War the university processed some 2,000 applications for commissions in the British Army and another 3,000 subsequently passed through its School of Instruction. The OTC was based at Yeomanry House in Manor Road from 1929, but moved to Harcourt House in Marston Road from 1994 and moved again to purpose-built facilities at Falklands House in Oxpens Road in 1998.

=== Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (Queen&#x27;s) ===
In October 1908, the Queen&#x27;s University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formally raised in response to the recommendations of the committee formed by Lord Haldane. Parades were held in the old gymnasium which occupied the site of the former Drill Hall located south of the Queen&#x27;s University Belfast Students&#x27; Union. A Drill Hall was subsequently built at the cost of ¬£4,000 and officially opened on 20 November 1912 by Brigadier General Count Gleichen, who deputised for the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in Ireland.

During the First World War, training was increased for UOTC members being commissioned into newly formed battalions. By the end of the war almost 1,200 commissions had been obtained by cadets who had passed through the ranks of the contingent. In 1930 the Corps&#x27; title was changed to the &quot;Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast Contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps&quot;. A Reception Unit and a Joint Recruiting Board were set up in the Drill Hall to deal with applications for commissions during the Second World War. Queen&#x27;s UOTC is based at Tyrone House in Malone Road, Belfast.

=== Southampton ===

In November 1902 twenty students from Hartley University College raised a company, sanctioned by the War Office, which formed part of the 2nd Volunteer Battalion of the Hampshire Regiment. Members of the company were commissioned into the 5th Battalion of the Hampshire Regiment in 1914 and served on the Western Front during the First World War.

A separate UOTC was formed in Southampton in November 1937, and the relationship with the Hampshire Regiment discontinued. However, after supplying significant numbers officers to the British Army during the Second World War, recruitment fell and the UOTC was placed in suspended animation in April 1951. The UOTC was reformed in October 1979 and moved to its present premises at Carlton Place in Southampton in 1981.

=== Tayforth ===
The origins of the University of St Andrews&#x27; links with the military can be traced back to the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745, when companies of Militia were raised to defend the pro-Hanoverian University and the City of St Andrews against the absolutist Highland Jacobites. In 1859 a committee was formed in St Andrews to form a volunteer corps of both rifle and artillery. This was carried in a town meeting on 5 December 1859 and was carried unanimously and 3rd (St Andrews) Fife Artillery Volunteers was formed. In November 1908, the St Andrews University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formally raised in response to the recommendations of the committee formed by Lord Haldane.

Following the formation of Dundee University from University College Dundee, a part of the University of St Andrews in 1967, the unit became the St Andrews and Dundee UOTC. With the Addition of Stirling University the UOTC was renamed Tayforth UOTC, as St Andrews, Dundee and Stirling Universities OTC was considered a bit of a mouthful. The name Tayforth was chosen as Dundee is situated on the River Tay and Stirling on the River Forth. The concern at the time was that St Andrews, as the senior university might not agree with this name, however as the River Tay and the River Forth are the boundaries of the Kingdom of Fife, within which St Andrews is located, it was approved by the MEC.

In May 1976, the Old Wyvernians formed as a regimental association for the former officer cadets of St Andrews UOTC. The inaugural meeting of the Tayforth Regimental Association was held on 16 June 1984, and was the first of its kind. Whilst other UOTCs followed the example, the Tayforth Regimental Association is the oldest of its kind. Tayforth UOTC is based at Park Wynd in Dundee.

=== Wales ===

In 1900 University College, Wales in Aberystwyth raised a company, sanctioned by the War Office, which was known as E Company of the 5th Volunteer Battalion, South Wales Borderers. In 1908, the University College, Wales contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formally raised in response to the recommendations of the committee formed by Lord Haldane. In 1910, the University College of North Wales contingent followed and, in 1913, the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire contingent was also raised. The UOTCs of Aberystwyth and Bangor supplied officers to the British Army during the Second World War, but after the war recruitment fell and the UOTCs were suspended in October 1952 and March 1948 respectively.

Meanwhile, the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire OTC had also supplied officers to the British Army during the Second World War but subsequently developed to become &quot;Cardiff UOTC&quot; and, in October 1990, it became &quot;Wales UOTC&quot;. Wales UOTC is based at Maindy Barracks in Cardiff.

=== Yorkshire Officers&#x27; Training Regiment ===

==== Leeds ====

In January 1909, the Leeds University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formally raised in response to the recommendations of the committee formed by Lord Haldane. The contingent was initially based at Woodhouse Lodge. During the First World War some 1,596 officers were recruited from Leeds University: of these some 328 were killed. The contingent received an inspection by King George V on 27 September 1915. Captain David Hirsch, a former member of the contingent, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on the Western Front during the First World War.

Leeds UOTC is based at Carlton Barracks in Leeds. Since September 2011 it has formed part of the Yorkshire Officers&#x27; Training Regiment.

==== Sheffield ====

In 1900 staff from the University of Sheffield raised a company, sanctioned by the War Office, which was known as G Company of the West Yorkshire Royal Engineers. In 1911, the Sheffield University contingent of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps was formally raised in response to the recommendations of the committee formed by Lord Haldane. Lieutenant William Allen, a former member of the contingent, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on the Western Front during the First World War.

From 1969 the UOTC began recruiting students from Sheffield Hallam University as well as Sheffield University. Sheffield UOTC is based at Somme Barracks in Sheffield. Since September 2011 it has formed part of the Yorkshire Officers&#x27; Training Regiment.

==Adventurous training and social life==
Concurrently with military training, many OTCs provide the opportunity to pursue sporting and adventurous hobbies. Sports such as skiing, mountain trekking, climbing, and sailing are actively encouraged. With access to the Army Reserve&#x27;s resources for adventurous training, students are enabled to pursue their other hobbies alongside their degrees. Socially, the OTCs hold frequent socials and informal events throughout the year alongside formal events such as regimental dinners. 

==Inter-OTC competitions==
The British Army runs several competitions throughout the academic year where the OTCs and the four Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme (DTUS) squadrons have a chance to compete against each other. One of these is the King&#x27;s Challenge Cup, a sports competition.

==Bans==
In January 1972, at the height of the Troubles, a meeting of 1,500 students at the University of Manchester banned the OTC from carrying out activities anywhere on the university campus.

In March 2008, a motion was passed during the University College London Union&#x27;s annual general meeting to ban armed forces groups and societies such as the University Royal Naval Unit (URNU), Officers&#x27; Training Corps (OTC) and University Air Squadron (UAS) from operating within UCLU locations and events. Through a subsequent motion passed through the Union Council, the decisions made at the annual general meeting were ratified; however, the ban was subsequently overturned by a large majority in following year&#x27;s AGM of 27 February 2009.

In April 2008 the University of Manchester tabled a proposal to ban military recruitment which also received press attention: however, this proposal ultimately failed.

<text>Tse (–¶¬†—Ü; italics: &quot;–¶¬†—Ü&quot; or –¶¬†—Ü; italics: &quot;–¶&quot;¬†&quot;—Ü&quot;), also known as Ce, is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

It commonly represents the voiceless alveolar affricate , similar but not identical to the pronunciation of zz in &quot;pizza&quot; or ts in &quot;cats&quot;.

In the standard Iron dialect of Ossetic, it represents the voiceless alveolar sibilant fricative /s/. In other dialects, including Digoron, it has the same value as in Russian.
In English, Tse is commonly romanized as . However, in proper names (personal names, toponyms, etc.) and titles it may also be rendered as (which signifies the sound in Serbo-Croatian, Czech, Polish, Hungarian etc.), (which signifies the sound in Italian and German), (which was one of the conventions to represent the sound in Medieval Latin) or . Its equivalent in the modern Romanian Latin alphabet is .

==History==
Tse is thought to have come from the Hebrew letter Tsadi ‚ü®‚ü© or the Arabic letter , via the Glagolitic letter Tsi (‚∞ú¬†‚±å). It is unclear what Egyptian hieroglyph originated the letter Tse, possibly derived from an image of a fish hook or a papyrus plant.

The name of Tse in the Early Cyrillic alphabet is (&quot;tsi&quot;). New Church Slavonic and Russian (archaic name) spelling of the name is . In modern Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian, the name of the letter is pronounced [ts…õ] and spelled (sometimes ) in Russian, in Ukrainian, and in Belarusian.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, Tse has a value of 900. Tse may also have been derived from Sampi (based on numerical relationship) or Fai (based on shape and numerical relationship).

==Usage==
===Russian===
It is the 24th (if Yo is included) letter of the Russian alphabet. It is used both in native Slavic words (and corresponds to Proto-Indo-European *k in certain positions) and in borrowed words:
* as a match for the Latin in words of Latin origin, such as —Ü–∏—Ä–∫ (circus), —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä (centre),
* for the German and (which in turn both came from the High German consonant shift), in words borrowed from German, such as —Ü–∏–Ω–∫ (Zink), –ø–ª–∞—Ü (Platz),
* may correspond to Latin (before vowels), such as —Å—Ü–∏–Ω—Ç–∏–ª–ª—è—Ü–∏—è (scintillation).

Unlike most other consonants (but like and ), never represents a palatalised consonant in Russian (except occasionally in foreign proper names with or ). Since /i/ after unpalatalised consonants becomes […®], the combinations and are pronounced identically: [ts…®]. A notable rule of Russian orthography is that is seldom followed by , with the following exceptions:
* the ending - of the plural number or the genitive case (–ø—Ç–∏—Ü–∞ nominative singular ‚Üí –ø—Ç–∏—Ü—ã nominative plural or genitive singular),
* possessive suffix - is spelled - after and only then: —Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ü—ã–Ω, –∫—É—Ä–∏—Ü—ã–Ω,
** the suffix is very popular in Russian last names, but spelling varies and both - and - are possible, –ï–ª—å—Ü–∏–Ω is an example,
* the ending of adjectives - (that becomes -, -, -, - in declension) such as –∫—É—Ü—ã–π or –±–ª–µ–¥–Ω–æ–ª–∏—Ü—ã–π,
* conjugation of a vulgar verb —Å—Ü–∞—Ç—å (—Å—Ü—ã, —Å—Ü—ã–º, —Å—Ü—ã—Ç, —Å—Ü—ã—Ç–µ, —Å—Ü—ã—à—å) and its prefixed derivatives,
* a few other word roots: —Ü—ã–≥–∞–Ω, —Ü—ã–∫- (—Ü—ã–∫–∞—Ç—å, —Ü—ã–∫–Ω—É—Ç—å), —Ü—ã–ø- (—Ü—ã–ø–ª—ë–Ω–æ–∫, —Ü—ã–ø–∫–∏, —Ü—ã–ø–æ—á–∫–∏, —Ü—ã–ø-—Ü—ã–ø), —Ü—ã—Ü, —Ü—ã—Ä–∫–∞—Ç—å,
** pre-1956 lists contain words such as —Ü—ã–±–∏–∫, —Ü—ã–±—É–ª—è, —Ü—ã–≥–∞—Ä–∫–∞, —Ü—ã–¥—É–ª–∫–∞, —Ü—ã–∫–ª—è, —Ü—ã–º–±–∞–ª—ã, —Ü—ã–º–µ—Å, —Ü—ã–Ω–≥–∞, —Ü—ã–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∞, —Ü—ã–Ω—É–±–µ–ª—å, —Ü—ã—Ä—é–ª—å–Ω—è, —Ü—ã—Ç–≤–∞—Ä–Ω—ã–π, —Ü—ã—Ñ–∏—Ä—å, –ø–∞–Ω—Ü—ã—Ä—å, etc. (examples taken from Ya. S. Khomutov&#x27;s spelling dictionary, 1927 but now all those words are spelled with -—Ü–∏-),
* Pinyin&#x27;s becomes , and becomes .

<text>The Air Training Corps (ATC) is a British volunteer youth organisation; aligned to, and fostering the knowledge and learning of military values, primarily focusing on military aviation. Part of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets (RAFAC), the ATC is sponsored by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the wider Ministry of Defence (MoD). The majority of Air Training Corps staff are volunteers, though some staff are paid for full-time work; including Commandant Air Cadets, who is a Royal Air Force officer as part of a Full Term Reserve Service commitment.

Members of the Air Training Corps are known as Air Cadets, which is often interchanged with the term &#x27;ATC cadets&#x27;. Although many ATC cadets subsequently go on to join the Royal Air Force, or the other branches of the British Armed Forces (or have the desire to do so), the ATC is not a recruiting organisation for its parent service (the Royal Air Force).

Activities undertaken by the Air Training Corps include sport, adventure training (such as walking and paddle-sports), ceremonial drill, rifle shooting, fieldcraft, air experience flights in both powered aircraft and sail-plane gliders, and other outdoor activities, as well as educational classification training. Week-long trips, or &#x27;camps&#x27; to RAF stations, along with other camps offering adventure training or music, allow the opportunity for cadets to gain a taste of military life, and often some flying experience in RAF gliders and RAF training aircraft such as the Grob G 115, an aerobatic-capable elementary flying training aircraft, known in UK military service as the Tutor T1. The Viking T1 glider is used to train cadets on gliding the manufacturer name for the Viking T1 is the Grob G103a Twin II, manufactured by Grob.
Cadet membership can begin when cadets are 12 years old and in school Year 8 (England and Wales), or equivalent in Scotland and Northern Ireland. New members will join with a rank of Cadet and can earn positions of increasing responsibility in a military rank structure, as well as having increasing skill and competence recognised in a classification scheme (joining as a Second Class cadet then First Class, Leading, Senior, Master). As a cadet becomes more experienced with camps and activities, the skills they will acquire will be rewarded with a corresponding badge according to the skill achieved and how advanced the cadet is at that particular skill (e.g. drumming, shooting, leadership, first aid).

Service as a cadet in the Air Training Corps ends at the age of 18, although a cadet over the age of 18 can continue service until the age of 20 if appointed as a Staff Cadet. As of 2nd September 2024 Cadets reaching the age of 18 can also transition to become a Cadet Forces Adult Volunteer (Adult staff member). However, cadets wishing to serve on the same Squadron must spend a minimum six months secondment period at a different Squadron.

, the ATC strength is 34,070 cadets (30% female) and 9,190 adult volunteers (30% female).

Together, the RAF contingent (or RAF section) of the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) and the Air Training Corps comprise the Royal Air Force Air Cadets (RAFAC), previously known as the Air Cadet Organisation (ACO), part of the British Government&#x27;s Community Cadet Forces.

==History==
===Foundation===

Air Commodore Sir John Chamier is affectionately known as the &#x27;father of the air cadet movement&#x27;. He joined the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), the forerunner of the Royal Air Force, where he served as a pilot in World War I. He transferred to the Royal Air Force (RAF) upon its formation in 1918. After retiring from the service in 1929, Chamier became Secretary-General of the Air League; an organisation made up of people who wanted to make the British public aware of the importance of military aviation. With the clouds of war beginning to form over Europe, and the personal memory of how young men with only a few hours of training had been sent into air combat only to fall victim to well-trained enemy aviators, he conceived the idea of an aviation cadet corps.

===Air Defence Cadet Corps===
The purpose of the Air Defence Cadet Corps (ADCC), set up in 1938 by Air Commodore Chamier, was to train young men in various aviation-related skills. The ADCC proved popular, with thousands joining up. In 1941, to provide the means of giving part-time air training to teenagers and young men who might later join the Royal Air Force, the ADCC was formally established as the Air Training Corps by Royal Warrant.

===Air Training Corps===

On , the Air Training Corps (ATC) was officially established, with King George VI agreeing to be the Air Commodore-in-Chief, and issuing a Royal Warrant setting out the Corps&#x27; aims. Within the first month of its existence, the size of the old ADCC, now the ATC, virtually doubled to more than 400 squadrons, and continued to grow thereafter. A new badge was designed for the ATC and, once approved by the King, was distributed in August 1941. The motto &#x27;Venture Adventure&#x27;, devised by Air Commodore Chamier, was adopted by the ATC and incorporated into the badge.

The new ATC squadrons adopted training programmes to prepare young men for entry into the Royal Air Force. Squadrons arranged visits to RAF and Fleet Air Arm stations as part of the cadets&#x27; training, where a flight might be a possibility. Such opportunities were not widely available, however, and many cadets were disappointed. One solution was to introduce opportunities for flying, as a way to allow a cadet to get the feel of an aircraft in flight and to handle an aircraft&#x27;s controls whilst airborne. After the end of the Second World War, gliding lessons became available.

Before the 1980s, females were unable to join the ATC, although they were able to join an attached unit of the Girls Venture Corps (GVC) which had been formed in the early years of the Second World War, if one was available at their location. As of 2013, the GVCAC still exists, although in greatly reduced numbers due to competition from the ATC, and the two organisations no longer share a site.

Before May 2008, cadets would spend a lot of time in the classroom before obtaining First Class classification, studying the following subjects: The Air Training Corps, The Royal Air Force, History of Flight, Initial Expedition Training, Basic Communications, and Airmanship I. After many lectures, and when the cadet felt ready, they would take a multiple-choice examination, either on paper or on a computer. Some wings ran courses that would involve the cadet spending a few days learning, and then awarded the appropriate classification if successful in their exams. In May 2008, HQ Royal Air Force Air Cadets (RAFAC) decided to change the training programme for junior and second class cadets, sensing that recruits were being deterred by exams. In March 2016, after a review of the then current training syllabus, the new &#x27;Progressive Training Syllabus&#x27; was introduced, which provided for four levels of each badge (blue, bronze, silver, and gold).

===Investigation into sexual abuse===

In 2012, payouts made to victims of sexual abuse by the MOD, across all Cadet Forces, totalled ¬£1,475,844. The payouts in 2013 totalled ¬£64,782, and ¬£544,213 in 2014.

In 2017, a BBC Panorama episode entitled &#x27;Cadet Abuse Cover-Up&#x27; highlighted sexual abuse cases in the British Cadet Forces. Through the years 2012 to 2017, there were 134 allegations of sexual abuse made against ATC volunteers, including historical allegations; 96 cases were referred to the Police for investigation, and 9 offenders were dismissed.

===Air Cadet Organisation===

Until October 2017, advertising material such as leaflets and official websites branded the Air Training Corps and Combined Cadet Force collectively as the Air Cadet Organisation (ACO). This term was replaced by the Royal Air Force Air Cadets (RAFAC).

==Structure and organisation==
The Air Training Corps includes three parts; the officer and staff cadre (which comprises uniformed and civilian instructors), the Civilian Committee, and the Chaplaincy.

The United Kingdom is split into six regions (akin to the former geographic groups of the RAF), each commanded by a Full-Time Reserve Group Captain in the RAF Reserves, and having a Regional Chairman and Regional Chaplain. Each region is sub-divided into many wings. There were historically six wings per region, however, as of 2013 there were 34 wings, most named after the one or two counties of the United Kingdom that they operate in. Wings are further sub-divided into sectors. Within the sectors lie squadrons, and it is the squadron that is the focal point for the majority of members of the Corps. As of 2019, there were 952 ATC squadrons and detached flights, each assigned to a wing.

The Air Training Corps is the largest part of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets (RAFAC), along with the RAF sections of the Combined Cadet Force (CCF).

===Regions===
* Central &amp; East Region
* London and South East Region (LaSER)
* North Region
* Scotland &amp; Northern Ireland Region
* South West Region
* Wales &amp; West Region
===Wings===
==Governance==
===National===
Headquarters Royal Air Force Air Cadets (HQ RAFAC, formerly Headquarters Air Cadets or HQAC) is based at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire, England. There are subordinate headquarters at region and wing levels, staffed by RAF and RAFAC officers and civil servants. HQ RAFAC controls two National Air Cadet Adventure Training Centres (NACATC): at Fairbourne, Gwynedd, Wales; and Windermere, Cumbria, England. These NACATCs provide a range of adventure training courses and accommodation for squadron and wing expeditions. HQ RAFAC also controls () twelve Volunteer Gliding Squadrons (VGS) around the UK, through the Air Cadet Central Gliding School at RAF Syerston.

===Local===
ATC squadrons are established in most large towns in the United Kingdom. There are also ATC units in Cyprus, Germany, Gibraltar, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man. In towns not large enough to sustain a squadron of 30 cadets, or as a supplement to an existing squadron in a larger town or city, a Detached Flight (DF) may be formed. A detached flight operates much like any other unit, but is a component part of a nearby, larger squadron. , there were over 912 ATC squadrons and 40 detached flights.

An Officer Commanding (OC) a squadron is typically a flight lieutenant (RAFAC). If a squadron commanded by an SNCO, warrant officer, pilot officer, or flying officer, they are referred to as Officer in Charge (OIC) (unless they have completed their Squadron Commanders Course at RAF Cranwell, then they retain the title of Officer Commanding). Officers were previously appointed in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch) RAFVR(T), but now receive a Cadet Forces Commission, introduced in 2017. The OC has a good deal of autonomy in running their ATC unit, albeit with the responsibility that goes with it. Where a unit has other members of staff, the OC usually allocates duties and provides recommendations on appointments, retentions, and promotions. The OC of an ATC squadron can appoint cadets up to the rank of cadet flight sergeant (Cdt FS) without any external approval. Further cadet promotion to the rank of cadet warrant officer (CWO) requires recommendation being sent to their squadron&#x27;s wing HQ.

The squadron warrant officer (Sqn WO) commonly holds the rank of warrant officer, or may be a senior non-commissioned officer (SNCO) if no warrant officer is available, and will typically have spent many years working within the squadron or the ATC.

The establishment of officers, WOs, senior NCOs, and Cadet NCOs, is dependent on the size of the squadron or detached flight, and this basic structure has many permutations; varying with the number of cadets and staff, accommodation and facilities. A typical small detached flight may consist only of the Officer Commanding and fifteen cadets, while a large squadron can consist of upwards of 120 cadets and numerous staff.

===Civilian committees===

A Civilian Committee (or &#x27;CivCom&#x27;) underpins all local funding that the RAF centrally cannot provide beyond core services for an individual squadron. Each is an independent charity, and operates to meet the funding needs of the local squadron. Since the Cadet Forces Adult Volunteers (CFAV) and civilian instructors (CI) in the ATC have no financial responsibilities, but still need money to manage and support cadet activities such as annual and overseas camps and adventure training, the funding responsibilities lie with the Civilian Committee. Serving as trustees, they are volunteers who support the cadet activities financially.

The RAFAC (ATC) is itself not a charitable organisation, and is not itself a legal entity, and so has no official legal status. That defers to the MOD. For this and other reasons, the trustees within each Civilian Committee are required to be responsible for, and accountable for, the charitable fundraising of the squadron. As with any charity, three officers (Chairperson, Secretary and Treasurer) are elected at an annual general meeting (AGM), possibly with the addition of a deputy chairperson, and then exist as an independent group to raise and manage funds in a lawful manner in accordance with the Charities Act. They do this under the status of an &#x27;excepted charity&#x27;, which requires that they conduct themselves wholly to the Charities Act 2011, but are excepted from sending in annual reports to the Charity Commission.

The squadron commander and chaplain are &quot;ex-officio&quot; members of their civilian committee, and have no voting rights; however, common sense determines they may advise in squadron-related matters. While co-operation between the squadron and the civilian committee is desirable at all times, there is no line of command or authority of anyone other than the trustees of the Civilian Committee. This includes any uniformed personnel up to, and including, the Commandant Air Cadets.

A Civilian Committee is responsible for overseeing the initial unit formation and direction, and will monitor the welfare of cadets. Civilian committees often include parents of cadets and retired ATC staff. Many squadron charities decide to operate against the RAFAC document known as ACP-11, which has been the traditional constitution. However, there is no requirement to do so, as long as the civilian committee establishes a constitution with acceptable charitable object statements; these may be similar to those in ACP-11. The Charity Commission produced model constitutions of which the &#x27;Model Constitution for a Small Charity&#x27; is used for the purpose of registering a charity at squadron level, and this has been the route required for all squadrons in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Any civilian committee in England and Wales that has an annual income that exceeds ¬£5,000 in any one year, may register their charity with the Charity Commission. The charity commissions of Scotland and Northern Ireland require committees located in those countries to register and have done so for several years.

==Culture==
===Aims and motto===

The aims of the Air Training Corps, as set out in the Royal Warrant and approved by Elizabeth II, are:
* To promote and encourage among young men and women a practical interest in aviation and the Royal Air Force (RAF);
* To provide training which will be useful in both the Armed Forces and civilian life;
* To foster a spirit of adventure and to develop the qualities of leadership and good citizenship.

The corps&#x27; motto is &#x27;Venture, Adventure&#x27;.

In December 2015, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh resigned from his role as honorary Air Commodore-in-Chief, having served in this role since 1953. On 16 December 2015, Prince Philip was succeeded as honorary Air Commodore-in-Chief by the then Duchess of Cambridge.

===Oath===
Upon enrolment into the Air Training Corps, every cadet has to make the following promise, usually at a ceremony presided over by the unit&#x27;s padre or commanding officer:

:&quot;I, *Full Name*, hereby solemnly promise on my honour to serve my Unit loyally and to be faithful to my obligations as a member of the Air Training Corps. I further promise to be a good citizen and to do my duty to (God and^) the King, my Country and my Flag.&quot;

The promise has recently been rewritten to accommodate everyone, whether or not they are religious, by allowing the option to drop the &#x27;God and&#x27; from the oath. The promise was formally recorded by the cadet&#x27;s signature in the cadet&#x27;s Cadet Record of Service Book (RAF Form 3822).

===Ensign===

The Air Training Corps Ensign is hoisted for every parade in the summer, and hauled-down at dusk. It is treated with the same respect and dignity afforded to the Royal Air Force Ensign. In the event of poor weather conditions e.g., heavy rain or snowfall, the ensign would not be raised. If poor weather conditions are present whilst the ensign is raised, it would be hauled down at the soonest possible point. This is to avoid damage to the ensign and also as a mark of respect and discipline.

The ATC ensign is raised and lowered by a nominated member of the squadron, sometimes a cadet non-commissioned officer (NCO), member of staff, or simply a cadet who has been chosen, with the salute being taken by any commissioned officer, normally the squadron&#x27;s Officer Commanding. All officers within view or earshot of the ensign salute during the hoisting and hauling down.

Most ATC wings and squadrons also have a banner, in addition to an ensign, which is paraded on formal occasions. The ATC also has a Corps Banner, which is afforded the same courtesies as an RAF Squadron Standard or the RAF King&#x27;s Colour, although its status is different.

===Uniform===
All cadets are issued with a uniform that is derived from that worn by RAF personnel, and are regulated by dress regulations known as ACP¬†1358.

Cadets primarily wear one of three uniforms:
* &quot;No. 2A (Full) Service Dress&quot; -AKA &#x27;Blues&#x27;‚Äî consisting of a light blue (Wedgewood) shirt and black tie, a blue V-neck wool jumper, a brassard, blue-grey trousers or skirt / slacks, and an RAF blue beret with an Air Training Corps cap badge. The jumper is removed in variation &quot;No. 2A (Long Sleeved) Service Dress&quot;.
* &quot;No. 2C Service Dress&quot; ‚Äî AKA &#x27;Dark Blues&#x27;- as above, but replacing the light blue shirt and tie with a dark blue shirt, worn with the top button undone. May be worn with or without the jumper.
* &quot;No. 3 Service Dress - Field Clothing&quot; ‚Äî AKA &#x27;Greens&#x27;- consisting of either CS95 or PCS-MTP field clothing.

Other cadet uniforms do exist, such as mess dress and warm-weather service dress for overseas squadrons, however these are not issued to cadets unless the need arises.

Some squadrons differentiate themselves from each other at a local level. One such example would be different coloured pieces of cloth behind the cap badges on the beret, allowing cadet NCOs and CFAVs to distinguish between cadets of differing flights. However, this is an unofficial practice, and not permitted on official parades. All No.2 uniform, except black parade shoes and combat boots are provided at the expense of the Ministry of Defence (MoD). No.3 uniform &#x27;Greens&#x27; are not funded by the MOD for air cadets and must be purchased privately.

===Squadron insignia===
The first fifty Air Training Corps squadrons that were formed retain an &#x27;F&#x27; to show they are &#x27;founder&#x27; squadrons, e.g., 10F (Luton) Squadron, 48F (Hampstead) Squadron, or 1F (City of Leicester) Squadron. Only thirty of the original F squadrons are still in existence; the other twenty have disbanded over time. Some founder squadrons have reformed under Roman numerals, having been refused permission to re-assume their F; the first squadron to do so was XIX (19 Crawley) Squadron, Sussex Wing. Although Brooklands Squadron was the first actual squadron to be established, it was given the squadron number of 11F due to a clerical error.

A Detached Flight uses its parent squadron number followed by the letters DF, to show that it is a detached flight, e.g., No 1408DF for No 1408 (Cranleigh) Detached Flight, raised by No 1408 (Dorking) Squadron.

==Activities==
There are also opportunities for band music, and many camps offer teenagers the chance to spend a week away from parents, practising fieldcraft or receiving instruction in gliding and other outdoor pursuits. Many of these activities, including gliding, have a well-defined scale of achievement that a cadet can work to build up; this includes the leadership qualities reflected in an NCO structure.

===Annual camps===

The Air Training Corps runs numerous annual camps each year, run on RAF stations so that cadets may get a taste of Royal Air Force life. Annual camps are organised at Wing level, with place for all squadrons, so that every cadet who wishes to and who has achieved at least the First Class qualification may take part. Cadets usually stay in RAF barrack blocks, and eat in the station&#x27;s mess facilities. The itinerary includes typical ATC activities, such as drill, air experience flying, shooting, and adventure training. Cadets also have the opportunity to visit various sections of the station, and meet the people who work there. Cadets may also have the opportunity to attend other sorts of annual camp, such as a locally (i.e. wing- or squadron-) organised camp based around adventure training or fieldcraft, or as guests on a camp run by one of the other cadet forces such as the Army Cadet Force or the Sea Cadet Corps. There are also Music camps for band members.
One large annual camp is the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) camp held annually in July for the major airshow at RAF Fairford. Each year, cadets aged above 16 years and their staff spend between one to three weeks, carrying out essential work in the preparation, and the subsequent taking-down of the infrastructure for RIAT. On air display days, cadets have jobs to do, and after the show weekend they are able to meet the crews and see the aeroplanes at close range.
===Work experience camps===
Another option for more senior cadets are work experience camps. Whilst annual camps aim to give cadets a general taste of service life, the work experience camps cater for cadets who are interested in a specific trade, such as the RAF Regiment or RAF Police. However, in recent years, the opportunities for work experience placements have decreased. Cadets can, however, contact their local Armed Forces Information Office AFIO.

===Overseas camps===
For older and more experienced cadets who have achieved the Leading Cadet qualification and have attended at least one UK Annual Camp, the Air Training Corps also offers overseas camps. These are generally more relaxed, and seen as a reward for hard-working and long-serving cadets. Since the end of the Cold War, and the closure of RAF stations in Germany, the number of overseas camp opportunities has decreased. As of 2007 the destinations for overseas camps are:
* RAF Akrotiri on Cyprus; a seven-day camp over the Easter school holiday period and at select other times of the year.
* RAF Gibraltar in Gibraltar.
* Sennelager Training Area in Germany.
* JHQ Rheindahlen in Germany.
* USAF Ramstein in Germany; a camp at the base during the summer.
* International Four Days Marches at Nijmegen, in the Netherlands; annually in July, where cadets complete a walk during four days.

Former RAF bases that hosted overseas camps included RAF Bruggen, RAF Laarbruch, RAF G√ºtersloh, and RAF Gatow.

===Corps-wide trophies===
Air Training Corps squadrons each have a chance annually to win the two most prized trophies in the corps. The Sir Alan Lees trophy is awarded by the commandant Air Training Corps to the squadron with the best statistics and overall impression when inspected. The Morris Trophy is awarded to one of the six regional candidates upon inspection by the commandant.
The Foster Trophy is awarded to the cadet who has achieved the highest academic results in the entire corps over their time in the Air Training Corps, after finishing the cadet syllabus that leads to a BTEC Level 2 Certificate in Aviation Studies. In addition, there are also trophies presented annually by the Royal Air Forces Association (RAFA). These trophies include the &#x27;Sir Douglas Bader Wings Appeal Trophy&#x27; for the ATC squadron collecting the most money on a per capita basis, the squadron achieving second place is awarded the &#x27;Sir Augustus Walker Trophy&#x27;. The &#x27;Sir Robert Saundby Trophy&#x27; is awarded for collecting the highest net Wings Appeal amount.

The Quinton Memorial Trophy is a national award presented annually to the adult non-commissioned officer (NCO) who has gained the top academic results in the senior non-commissioned officer (SNCO) initial courses held at the Air Cadet Adult Training Facility, Royal Air Force College Cranwell (RAFC). This trophy is named in honour of Flight Lieutenant John Quinton.

==Air Training Corps ranks==
===Cadets===

Young people who have begun their 2nd year of Secondary School (Year 8), and are under 16¬†3/4 years old can join the Air Training Corps (ATC). They are initially given the title &#x27;Junior Cadet&#x27;, and can go along to most squadron (or flight) meetings to get a feel for the ATC. Enrolment confers the status of Second Class Cadet, and upon completion of the First Class syllabus, they become First Class Cadets and receive their First Class badge to be worn on their brassard. First class classification may take three to six months to achieve, depending upon the squadron&#x27;s activities and schedule. Once cadets have successfully completed lessons in a number of subjects and achieved first class classification, they are able to take part in almost all ATC activities. Those who stay on beyond 18 are known as Staff Cadets, and wear rank slides denoting such. All cadets over the age of 18 must complete an Adult Volunteer Induction Programme (AVIP) prior to their 18th birthday, and must be cleared by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS). Once a Cadet has completed the AVIP, and subject to approval from the cadet&#x27;s wing commander, their Cadet service is extended to their 20th birthday. After this point Cadet service must be terminated.

All cadets are issued with a uniform (free), and must each pay a small amount in subscriptions (or &#x27;subs&#x27; as they are commonly known), usually around ¬£70‚Äì¬£200 per year, although this can vary widely from squadron to squadron. Activities such as smallbore and fullbore target rifle shooting, flying, and gliding are paid for from the Air Cadets central budget of the Royal Air Force.

===Cadet non-commissioned officers (NCOs)===
As cadets become more experienced within the Air Training Corps (ATC), and if suitable, they can be promoted by their squadron&#x27;s commanding officer (CO) to the status of cadet non-commissioned officers (NCOs). Promotion to the rank of Corporal, Sergeant, and Flight Sergeant is at the discretion of the Commanding Officer. They (or a representative) will make a decision based on merit and leadership potential; many squadrons have formal selection procedures including interviews, whilst others select by observing potential during normal training. All cadets, regardless of rank, must leave the Air Training Corps by age 20.

The Cadet NCO ranks within the ATC mirror those of the RAF&#x27;s non-technical / non-flying trades, and are, in descending order of seniority:

It is common within the ATC to abbreviate these ranks by dropping the prefix &#x27;cadet&#x27;. Cadet Warrant Officers are not addressed as &#x27;Sir&#x27; or &#x27;Ma&#x27;am&#x27;, but as &#x27;Cadet Warrant Officer&#x27;, &#x27;Warrant Officer&#x27;, or informally as &#x27;CWO&#x27; (pronounced &#x27;si&#x27;, &#x27;w…ô ä&#x27;, or alternatively as an acronym), the former being preferred by cadets and staff, in order to reduce ambiguity with the adult substantive rank of Warrant Officer. This is the only rank in the Corps to accommodate the &#x27;Cadet&#x27; prefix upon being referred to by members of the Corps. This is to distinguish them from the adult staff, as they are at least 18 years of age and could easily be confused with an adult member of staff, or a serving member of the RAF.

Promotion to Cadet Warrant Officer is decided by a panel at wing level, once a recommendation form has been submitted by the Officer Commanding of the prospective candidate&#x27;s squadron. Prospective candidates will be a Cadet Flight Sergeant (aged 17 or above), preferably holding the Master Air Cadet classification (see below), and will be required to attend an interview with the wing commander or their representative. Once the Wing Commander approves the promotion to Cadet Warrant Officer, the recommendation is sent to HQ RAFAC at RAFC Cranwell. The recommendation will then receive final approval, and a certificate of appointment will be issued to the successful candidate.

===Staff cadets===
All cadets who are over the age of 18 must have completed the Adult Volunteer Induction Programme (AVIP) These cadets wear a rank slide with the words &#x27;STAFF CADET&#x27; embroidered below their rank insignia (or on plain slides for those of cadet rank). A staff cadet has extra responsibilities over cadets who are under the age of 18, including a duty of care to younger cadets. These cadets also hold enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Certificates or Protection of Vulnerable Groups certificates (in Scotland), in the same way as adult staff.

Staff cadets are sometimes considered adult members of staff to some extent, however this is erroneous. Their ablutions and accommodation is segregated from both adult staff and cadets.

==Cadet classification syllabus==
Whilst not all cadets who join the Air Training Corps (ATC) will be eligible for promotion, all cadets can progress through the (ATC) training system and, by passing exams, achieve different classifications. The classification levels are Junior Cadet, Second Class Cadet (this is automatically achieved on enrolment), First Class Cadet, Leading Cadet, Senior Cadet, and Master Air Cadet. To achieve these qualifications, cadets study a variety of subjects through tuition from the instructors and / or self-study from Ultilearn. Each successive qualification generally allows a cadet greater participation in ATC activities. Cadets who have achieved the Master Air Cadet classification have completed their academic training, and could formerly attain a Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC) Level 2 in Aviation Studies (equivalent to 2 GCSEs A*‚ÄìC) via CVQO.

The Method of Instruction course is not a classification as such, but rather a qualification. This allows them to teach other cadets a variety of subjects. Although this is not compulsory, ATC Wings ordinarily feed this hand-in-hand with the Staff Cadet Course (see below). Upon successful completion of this course, the cadet will be awarded a yellow lanyard to distinguish them. This is worn over the left shoulder, and fastened to a small black Royal Air Force button or the left shirt pocket button when not wearing a jumper.

===Marking methodology===
Leading Cadet, Senior Cadet, and Master Air Cadet exams consist of multiple assessment criteria each containing two questions. A cadet must achieve either 1 or 2 marks (50% or 100%) for each module in order to pass. All exams are taken online on a system called Bader Learn.

===First Class Cadet===
First Class Cadet is also informally referred to as &#x27;Basic Training&#x27;. A variety of methods are used to test a cadet&#x27;s understanding of the subject, including practical tests and exercises to test ability, and interviews / quizzes to test knowledge.
All junior cadets also have to pass a practical Drill Test to become first class. The drill test is a sequence of simple drill manoeuvres essential for forming squads, and a good foundation to build on for more advanced drill.

===Leading Cadet===
For a cadet to become a Leading Cadet, they must have already gained First Class Cadet status. They will then have to complete three examinations: Land Navigation, Principles of Flight and Airmanship Knowledge.
===Senior Cadet and Master Cadet===
In September 2010, a new classification structure, syllabus and examination process came into force. The Senior Cadet badge shows a four-bladed propeller with a small four pointed star in the centre in an X orientation. The Master Air Cadet badge for the brassard shows an ATC Falcon surrounded by laurel leaves.

For each badge, cadets must pass three of the following subjects, for Master Air Cadet they may not use the same three subjects they used on Senior Cadet.

The following subjects are available:
* Aircraft handling and flying techniques
* Air Power
* Piston engine propulsion
* Jet engine propulsion
* Rocketry
* Airframes
* Avionics and aircraft electrical systems
* Basic air navigation
* Basic principals of pilot navigation
* Advanced radio and radar
* Data communications

===Specialist Instructor and Leadership Qualifications===

With the change of the classification structure in September 2010, the classification of staff cadet changed to become Instructor Cadet. An Instructor Cadet is denoted by a yellow lanyard worn over their left shoulder. In 2019, the syllabus for attaining Instructor Cadet was updated. There is now no minimum classification needed to obtain it, but one must complete a presentation skills course, usually delivered on the cadet&#x27;s squadron, and then complete the Method of Instruction course. Previous to this, the Master Air Cadet classification was needed to obtain this lanyard.

====Qualified Aerospace Instructors====
Alongside Instructor Cadet there is another lanyard that can be awarded to cadets who are interested in specialising in teaching aerospace subjects. These qualified cadets are known as Qualified Aerospace Instructors (QAIs), and wear a light blue lanyard over their left shoulder. The Qualified Aerospace Instructors Course (QAIC) has been available since September 2008. The course is held at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, and as of 2011, also at MOD Boscombe Down (as of RAF Linton-on-Ouse&#x27;s closure in December 2020, the North centre was moved to Inskip Cadet Centre as of QAIC 14). The course is held from early September to Easter of the following year, beginning with a selection weekend in early September, and seven total weekends (as of QAIC 8, prior to this there were only six training weekends) from late September until early March. The course culminates in a &#x27;Graduation Week&#x27; which is organised to coincide with the Easter holidays to avoid clashing with school programmes. After completing training in various modules, they carry out examinations in all modules (air traffic control, air power, flight simulators, aerodynamics, and Instructional Teaching and Presentation Skills (ITPS)); satisfactory performance in all exams results in the cadet being awarded the pale blue QAIC lanyard and flight suit badge. Upon completion of the course, graduating students are offered affiliated membership to the Royal Aeronautical Society.

====Junior Leaders Course====
For those interested in fieldcraft teaching and leadership, there is the Junior Leaders Course. Successful completion of the course awards the participant a maroon lanyard to be worn over their left shoulder and a junior leaders badge to sew on to the left sleeve of their No.3 Service Dress (field uniform) to show they are a qualified Junior Leader. The course runs from September to Easter, involving six weekend training camps and an assessment week. The course is aimed at more senior cadets, and as such, an age restriction of 17 years applies. Not only this, but the course also requires the participant to hold the rank of Cadet Sergeant or higher. The course is also open to Sea Cadets and Army Cadets, and culminates in the award of a Level 3 Certificate in Leadership &amp; Management from the Institute of Leadership and Management.

==Adult staff and ranking==

Three categories of supervisory staff run the Air Training Corps (ATC) at the unit level: commissioned officers, senior NCOs, and civilian instructors (CIs). All uniformed staff must attend training courses run by the Royal Air Force at the Royal Air Force Air Cadets (RAFAC) Adult Training Facility (ATF), located at RAF College Cranwell (RAFC), usually within a year of appointment, with further courses as they progress up the rank structure. Cadet Forces Adult Volunteers (CFAV) are non-combatants, and there is no training for any form of active duty, or integration into the duties of other full-time or reserve military personnel. The CFAV is concerned only with the Air Cadets.

===Officers===
Since December 2017, all RAFAC officers in the Air Training Corps are commissioned with a Cadet Forces Commission (CFC) and ranks framework, with previous RAFVR(T) officers having their commissions transferred to CFC commissions.

Squadrons are usually commanded by CFC Flight Lieutenants (Flt Lt) and Flying Officers (Fg Off), who are also found as Wing and Regional staff officers, along with Squadron Leaders (Sqn Ldr) and Wing Commanders (Wg Cdr). Particularly large squadrons are sometimes commanded by Squadron Leaders (typically when the squadron has 100 or more cadets).

The most senior rank in the Cadet Forces Commission is that of Wing Commander, with the exception of the ambassador to the Air Cadets, and the single Senior RAFAC Volunteer, who both hold the honorary rank of Group Captain (Grp Capt) RAFAC, under a CFC. The current ambassador is Carol Vorderman.

Unless an officer has previous service in the British Armed Forces, they are appointed as an Acting Pilot Officer (A/Plt Off) until they complete the Officers Initial Course (OIC) at RAF College Cranwell. They are then awarded a Cadet Forces Commission (CFC). Promotion to Flying Officer normally occurs after two years. Former regular commissioned officers are usually appointed as Flying Officers, subject to certain conditions being met. Upon becoming Officer Commanding of a squadron, completing a Squadron Commander&#x27;s Course (SCC), and subject to certain conditions being met, officers may become eligible for promotion by either one or two ranks (in the case of a Flying Officer, promotion will not be more than one rank unless the Sqn size dictates such).
===Ambassador to the Air Cadets===
In April 2013, Sir Chris Hoy was appointed the first Ambassador to the Royal Air Force Air Cadets (RAFAC), and assumed the rank of Honorary Group Captain RAFVR(T).

In November 2014, Carol Vorderman accepted the appointment of Ambassador to the Royal Air Force Air Cadets, saying: &quot;I am truly honoured to be appointed as an ambassador for the RAF Air Cadets. I can&#x27;t wait to meet the cadets, and the adult volunteer staff who give so much of their time to support them. The cadets themselves are a shining example of the best of British youngsters, standing with them on a parade square will be a great privilege.&quot; Vorderman assumed the rank of Honorary Group Captain RAFVR(T) (changed to Group Captain RAFAC from December 2017) for the duration of her appointment. She is the first female to be appointed Ambassador.

In November 2021, rower Emma Wolstenholme was appointed Wing Commander (RAFAC) and Honorary Ambassador to the Air Cadets. She is a former serving Royal Air Force officer, and planned to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean in early 2022. However, this attempt and later ones were postponed due to sub-optimal weather conditions. A successful attempt was made on Sunday 4th June 2023, rowing 2,000 miles around Great Britain.

===NCOs and WOs===
Adults may also be appointed as senior non-commissioned officers (SNCO), these being ranks within the Air Training Corps. Adult SNCOs and warrant officers (WO) are uniformed in the same way as their RAF counterparts, except that the embroidered text of &#x27;RAF AIR CADETS&#x27; appears below their rank insignia.

Since December 2017, Air Training Corps SNCOs and WOs had their ranks transferred to the new RAFAC commissions and ranks framework. A gilt RAFAC badge is worn on the lapels when in No.1 dress uniform, to denote membership within the cadet forces.

In 2020, all RAFAC Warrant Officers and Warrant Officers (Aircrew) in the Air Training Corps were granted use of the Royal Arms insignia, to bring the RAFAC other ranks insignia into alignment with those of their Royal Air Force counterparts.
===Staff (adult) ranks pre-December 2017===

Air Training Corps officers were previously commissioned into the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch), RAFVR(T), a specific training branch of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, the RAFVR (military reservists). They previously wore a gilt &#x27;VRT&#x27; pin badge upon their rank braid, while warrant officers and SNCOs wore a gilt &#x27;ATC&#x27; pin badge. The Air Training Corps ranks of adult SNCOs and WOs were Sergeant (ATC), Flight Sergeant (ATC), and Warrant Officer (ATC).
===Civilian instructors and chaplains===
Civilian instructors, abbreviated CI, play an important role in training Air Training Corps cadets. Unlike adult NCOs and officers, civilian instructors do not wear a uniform. Civilian instructors are recognised by their light-blue polo shirt and dark-blue sweatshirt bearing the name of the corps and &#x27;Royal Air Force Air Cadets&#x27;. This is a recent effort to standardise their identity. When addressing a CI by cadets, Sir or Ma&#x27;am is used; whereas staff will use Mr, Mrs, Miss, followed by their surname to address a CI.

Many civilian instructors are ex-Royal Air Force or ex-military; they invariably bring valuable skills which directly complement the aims of the Air Training Corps. Whilst they do not form part of the squadron chain of command, in some circumstances they may hold positions within the squadron such as the adjutant, training officer, or treasurer.

Similarly, Air Training Corps chaplains are usually civilian members of the local clergy (although uniformed forces chaplains may join as Service Instructors). The role of the chaplain in the ATC is to &#x27;provide appropriate pastoral care for all personnel within the Air Cadet Organisation, irrespective of religious belief or status&#x27;. A chaplain&#x27;s role in the local squadron is to offer guidance and leadership to cadets and members of staff on moral and spiritual matters. The commitment expected of a chaplain is a monthly visit to lead what is termed &#x27;the Padre&#x27;s hour&#x27;, and to conduct the formal Enrolment Service when new cadets join. ATC chaplains are supported by the Royal Air Force Chaplains Branch. ATC chaplains do not wear uniform, but are recognised by a chaplain&#x27;s badge on their lapel, and a larger version on their tippet (preaching scarf), vestments, or other clerical clothing. Even if it is not their custom to do so, ATC chaplains are expected to wear a clerical collar (&#x27;dog collar&#x27;) when on an RAF station. The equivalent No.2 working dress for a chaplain is a dark sweater with chaplain&#x27;s badge and a clerical collar.
===Service instructors===
Members of the full-time (Regular) and part-time (Reserve) Armed Forces often assist at Air Training Corps squadrons in the role of Service Instructor; they engage in instructional duties which are often related to their serving role or profession. Service Instructors wear the uniform of their parent unit, and are addressed appropriately, with ranks junior to NCO being addressed as &#x27;Staff&#x27;.

<text>The Sea Cadet Corps is a national youth charity. It is present in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Malta and Bermuda. Cadets follow an ethos, training plan and rank structure similar to that of the Royal Navy, and are recognised by the UK Ministry of Defence.

== History ==
In 1854, a Vicar in Whitstable, Kent returned from the Crimean War and founded an orphanage where sailors taught nautical skills to prepare orphans for future careers. Multiple similar orphanages were founded across the country, and the organisation became known as the Naval Lads&#x27; Brigade. In 1899 Queen Victoria presented ¬£10 (around ¬£1,000 today) to the Windsor Unit to purchase uniforms.

In 1910 The Navy League sponsored a small number of units as the Navy League Boys&#x27; Naval Brigade, and in 1919 the organisation adopted the name Navy League Sea Cadet Corps. Lord Nuffield donated ¬£50,000 in 1937 to fund an expansion of the Corps. By the outbreak of World War II, there were 100 Units across the UK with more than 10,000 Cadets.

King George VI became the Admiral of the Corps in 1942 and the name was changed to the Sea Cadet Corps. The Sea Cadets had approximately 400 Units and 50,000 Cadets. The Girls Naval Training Corps was formed as well (later renamed Girls Nautical Training Corps in 1950). Queen Elizabeth II became the Patron of the Sea Cadets in 1952. In 1955 the Sea Cadet Council agreed to the formation of the Marine Cadet Section. The Girls Nautical Training Corps became affiliated with the Sea Cadet Corps in 1963. The Royal Naval Association began planning the first British colonial unit in Bermuda in 1964, with TS Bermuda formed on 12 January 1966.~ Located at Admiralty House, Bermuda, it was followed by two further units (TS Venture at the former Roman Catholic chapel of the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda and TS Admiral Somers at Convict Bay, St. George&#x27;s, another former Admiralty property).

On 31 March 1980 the Ministry of Defence approved the admission of girls into the Sea Cadet Corps. The successful integration of girls into the Sea Cadet Corps led to the dissolution of the Girls Nautical Training Corps in 1992.

== Ethos ==
The Sea Cadets&#x27; ethos is made up of three parts: its values, its mindset, and the customs and traditions of the Royal Navy. The promise made by every cadet who joins the Sea Cadet Corps is as follows:

The Sea Cadet Promise:
&quot;I promise to serve my God, my King, my country, and, the Sea Cadet Corps and to obey the orders of my superior officers. I will be proud of my uniform and be smart and seamanlike in wearing it, and, always do my duty.&quot; 
Note: My God refers to an individual‚Äôs own faith and is intended to apply equally to those from all faiths or none. (Sea Cadets&#x27; Ethos, 2019, p4)

The ethos is underpinned by the Sea Cadet Values which are: Courage, Commitment, Discipline, Respect, Loyalty, Honesty, and Integrity. These are taught by staff throughout the time cadets are with a unit, there is also an expectation that Chaplains will take a lead in such delivery.

== Cadets ==
=== Junior Sea Cadets ===
For 9 to 12-year-olds, Junior Cadets have their own training programme and uniform, based on a more practical version of the Sea Cadets training programme. When Junior Sea Cadets turn 12 years old, they can move up to being a New Entry to learn the New Entry courses, before moving up to become a Sea Cadet.

=== Sea Cadets ===
For 12 to 18-year-olds, young people can join as a Sea Cadet and work their way up through the training programme. When cadets turn 18, they can either leave the Corps or they can stay and train as staff.

=== Royal Marines Cadets ===

For 13 to 18-year-olds, the Sea Cadets has detachments of Royal Marines Cadets. They follow a more infantry-based syllabus including fieldcraft; section battle drills, fire and manoeuvre, and general patrolling including reconnaissance missions, ambush, and fighting patrols. Other Royal Marines Cadets exist in the Volunteer Cadet Corps and Combined Cadet Force.

* Eastern (including Malta)
* Northern (including Northern Ireland and Bermuda)
* Southern (including the Channel Islands &amp; Falkland Islands)
* North West (including the Isle of Man)
* London 
* South West

Each area is run by an Area Officer (AO) with a small team of support staff.

=== District level ===
Each area is subdivided into districts of between five and twelve units which are led by volunteers.

=== Unit level ===
Each unit is led by a Commanding Officer. Some units also have a Royal Marines Cadets Detachment, headed by a detachment commander.

Volunteers fulfil roles such as water sports instructors, fundraisers, administrative staff, etc. Sea Cadets has both uniformed adult volunteers and non-uniformed adult volunteers.

Each unit is a separate registered charity, affiliated to the Marine Society &amp; Sea Cadets. The trustees are elected annually, except the Commanding Officer, who is appointed ex-officio. They form the Unit Management Team, responsible for providing the resources to safely carry out the training programme.

== Training regime ==

=== Cadet Training Programme ===
The Sea Cadet Corps follows the Cadet Training Programme (CTP) which covers various water-based activities and skills as well as first aid and leadership with lots more. Royal Marine Cadets also complete the CTP but have additional elements such as camp craft and weapon handling, amongst others.

When you become the rating of Able Cadet (AC) you start a new syllabus called the LDP (Leadership and Development Programme). This is to perfect your leadership skills and teaching skills, this will also help if cadets are looking to become members of staff.

The Cadet Training Program is broken down by ratings. For example, a Cadet 1st Class (CFC) will complete the CFC to Ordinary Cadet (OC) training.

=== Specialisation and proficiency training ===
Skills learned in a cadet&#x27;s time in the SCC usually fall into one of two categories - Specialisations and Proficiencies. Specialisations are often larger subjects than proficiencies, and so are split into three levels; Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced, each level increasing in difficulty by building on the knowledge gained from the prior levels. Basic specialisations are often gained at the unit during regular training, while Intermediate and Advanced awards are held on an Area or National basis.

Some specialisations and proficiencies, such as Marine Engineering, are also divided into disciplines such as Electrical and Mechanical engineering.

All of the following are on offer to cadets, either at the unit or on district/area/national courses.

Cadets may also work towards recognised qualifications including, Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award and BTEC qualifications. The BTECs are offered by CVQO, and include Teamwork and Personal Development in the Community (formerly Public Service), Music, and Engineering.

Many qualifications are run by the Sea Cadets but regulated by external bodies. In these cases, cadets earn independent qualifications that are recognised outside the Corps. These include paddle sport, where they can gain Paddle Power or Star Awards through British Canoeing (formerly known as BCU), First Aid, where they can earn St John Ambulance First Aid certifications, Rowing, where they can earn British Rowing (BR) qualifications and Powerboating/Sailing/Windsurfing/Navigation where they can gain Royal Yachting Association (RYA) qualifications. National courses are also held, often on Royal Navy bases, to teach skills such as leadership and teamwork. Specialist qualification courses include power boating in Scotland, cooking in Preston, and fire fighting in Cornwall. There are competitions at varying levels in many of the sports, proficiencies, and specializations of the SCC. Competitions start at a District level and progress through to the National level.

== Ranks and rates ==
=== Cadets ===
From New Entry through to Able Cadet, Sea Cadets are promoted based on their completion of various task-based modules under the CTP - Cadet Training Programme. Leading Cadets and Petty Officer Cadets are required to attend and pass a promotion board (held at an area or national level) before being promoted. If they then go on to become an instructor they must join as a civilian instructor first, unless they were a Petty Officer Cadet then they will be able to join as a Probationary Petty Officer.

The ranks of Marine Cadet 2nd Class (MC2) and Marine Cadet 1st Class (MC1), which were equivalent to Ordinary Cadet and Cadet 1st Class respectively, were phased out at the end of 2018. The rank of Marine Cadet (MC) is now equivalent to all three Sea Cadet ranks of Cadet, Cadet 1st Class and Ordinary Cadet (OC).

All Royal Marines Cadets are required to complete boards for each promotion. The higher the board the higher the level the board is run at. The former promotions from Marine Cadet to Marine Cadet 2nd Class and to Marine Cadet 1st Class were run at the detachment level. Marine Cadet to Lance Corporal boards are at troop or company level, Lance Corporal to Corporal boards are at the company level, and Corporal to Sergeant boards are at a national level. All promotions boards have multiple sections all of which must be passed individually.

==== Junior Cadets ====
=== Adult officers ===
The following rates and ranks can be awarded to uniformed adult volunteers, there are also Non-uniformed Civilian Instructors (CIs) and Unit Assistants (UAs). From 2009 to 2019, if a person joined as a Civilian Instructor and wanted to be a uniformed member of staff, they would become an Acting Petty Officer or Sergeant, following a 6-month probationary period. From 2020, an adult can join as a uniformed member of staff as a probationary Petty Officer or Sergeant on completion of their application process.

Officers are commissioned under the Cadet Forces Commission.


Another rank is Chaplain, they also commission under the Cadet Forces Commission. 
== Uniform ==

Cadets are issued two uniforms. Some units ask for a deposit for uniforms that is returned after the uniform is given back.

The two primary uniforms that cadets receive are:

Sea Cadets
* No. 1s (Formal Dress) - Seaman&#x27;s Cap, Blue Class II Jumper, Blue Class II Trousers, Shirt Uniform Class II (white front), Seaman‚Äôs Blue Collar, Black Scarf Assembly, Lanyard, Black Boots/Shoes

* No. 4s (General Duty Rig) - Beret, Blue Jersey (worn in cold weather), Blue Working Shirt, Blue Working Trousers, Black Boots. No. 4s will gradually be decommissioned as the RNPCS takes over as General Duty Rig as of the 19th of July 2024.
* RNPCS (Royal Navy Personal Clothing System) - Beret, Blue Stable Belt, Blue Jersey (for use in cold weather), Black undershirt, Blue Working Jacket, Blue Working Trousers, Black Boots. As of the 19 July 2024 the Sea Cadets have adopted RNPCS as the General Duty Rig. Many Sea Cadet units will operate using a variety of RNPCS and No. 4s as not every unit has received every item of RNPCS clothing. Cadets are issued three badges to be sewn onto the uniform, one &quot;Cadet Forces&quot; badge, to be sewn onto the top seam of the left breast pocket. Cadets are also issued two &quot;Sea Cadet Corps&quot; shoulder flashes. 

Marine Cadets
* No. 1s (Regimental Blue Dress) - Cap, Blue Tunic, Blue Trousers, White Belt, White Gloves, Black Boots
* No. 3B/3D (General Duty Dress) - Beret, Combat Jacket, Combat Trousers, Smock (worn in cold weather), Belt, Boots

There are also other uniforms cadets can wear like 2s (Evening Mess Dress). As well as 5s (Working Rigs) which consist of aviation dress, catering dress, and physical training dress. All uniforms except 4s and 5s are split into 3 categories A, B, and C which are used for different occasions.

== Ships ==
The Sea Cadets have three classes of offshore vessels, all of which are capable of coastal/offshore passage making. Sea Cadet voyages normally last for 6 days, with cadets gaining RYA qualifications for their voyage. Individual Sea Cadet units also have various boats including MOD motor boats such as Vikings, Champs, Dories. Units may also have 1 or more ribs equipped with outboard engines, and possibly a rigiflex 360, in addition to vessels designed specifically for the SCC such as the Trinity 500 rowing boat and RS &quot;Quest&quot; dinghy. Also on loan from the MOD, canoes, kayaks, and windsurfing equipment. Larger Boat Stations and Training Centres have larger ribs and other vessels

=== Current offshore fleet ===
==== TS &quot;Royalist&quot; ====
TS &quot;Royalist&quot;, the Sea Cadet flagship, is a tall ship owned by the MSSC. She is used to providing week-long training courses for Sea Cadets and Royal Marines Cadets. The ship was launched in 2014 to replace the previous TS &quot;Royalist&quot;, which was over 40 years old when decommissioned. In 2013 there had been an appeal to replace the ageing flagship: ¬£250,000 was needed this target was achieved in April 2013.

She is rigged as a 34m brig, with a sail area of . Her draught is . The ship&#x27;s hull is of high tensile steel, with her superstructure of glass reinforced plastic. She has a crew of eight, plus up to twenty-four Cadets and two adult trainees. Twelve passengers can also be carried.

==== TS &quot;City of London&quot; and TS &quot;Sir Stelios&quot; ====
TS &quot;City of London&quot; and TS &quot;Sir Stelios&quot; is the Sea Cadets&#x27; new (2017 and 2018 respectively) Rustler 42 yachts which have replaced the Tradewinds 35s TS &quot;Vigilant&quot; and TS &quot;City Liveryman&quot;. They are both Rustler 42 yachts and provide nationally-recognised RYA training for those wishing to gain qualifications and experience in yacht sailing. The pair travel the UK together each accommodating a crew of two, plus up to six cadets each.
==== TS &quot;John Jerwood&quot; and TS &quot;Jack Petchey&quot; ====
These two vessels are the cadets&#x27; offshore powered training-ship. They are long and each cost about ¬£2.6m. TS &quot;Jack Petchey&quot; is so named because the Jack Petchey Foundation donated ¬£1m in order for it to be built. The Jerwood Foundation donated ¬£1,216,700 for the construction of TS &quot;John Jerwood&quot;. The training ships can hold between 12-16 cadets, four permanent staff, and two CFAVs and provides an experience at sea focussing on deck work, navigation, bridge watchkeeping, cook/steward, and marine engineering. Each vessel is fitted with twin Perkins Sabre Type M215C Turbo Diesel main engines, each giving at 2,500 rpm.

=== Current Inshore Fleet ===

=== Trinity 500 rowing boats ===
The Trinity 500 is a stable fixed-seat rowing boat, purpose-built for the Sea Cadets to deliver the full SCC Rowing Scheme. The boat has also been approved by British Rowing, to allow for the delivery of their Explore Rowing Scheme. The boat was designed by Jo Richards, Olympic medallist and designer of a wide range of craft, in response to the requirement of the Sea Cadets for modern, low maintenance, purpose-designed fixed seat rowing boat with good performance under oars and with the capacity to mount a small outboard motor. The Trinity 500 is named to mark the quincentenary of the incorporation of Trinity House, the statutory authority for aids to navigation in England, Wales, The Channel Islands, and Gibraltar. The Trinity House Maritime Charity, a separately funded arm of the Corporation of Trinity House, funded the design and development costs of the boat.

=== RS dinghies ===
In a partnership between RS Sailing and the Sea Cadets, a new dinghy known as the RS &quot;Quest&quot; was designed by Jo Richards, who is also responsible for formulating the design for the Trinity 500 rowing vessel. The RS &quot;Quest&quot; was designed to accommodate the need for a new sailing dinghy within the SCC that is strong and easy to maintain and is capable of comfortably accommodating an instructor and up to three cadets. The RS &quot;Quest&quot; was unveiled at the Southampton Boat Show in 2015.
*Continuing the partnership between MSSC and RS Sailing, the single sail RS &quot;Zest&quot; dinghy was launched at the 2017 Southampton Boat Show. It is intended for a crew of two but can be sailed single-handed. It is aimed at benefiting units with limited access to water, as RS &quot;Zest&quot; can operate in shallower water than the RS &quot;Quest&quot;.

== Investigation into sexual abuse ==
In 2012 payouts made to victims of sexual abuse across all Cadet Forces totalled ¬£1,475,844. In 2013 payouts totalled ¬£64,782, and in 2014 payouts totalled ¬£544,213.

In 2017, a &quot;Panorama&quot; episode entitled &quot;Cadet Abuse Cover-Up&quot; highlighted sexual abuse cases in the British Cadet Forces. In a 1979 case of sexual abuse of a 14-year-old cadet in Hertfordshire, the boy&#x27;s parents were dissuaded from reporting the offender to police by Sea Cadet officers in full uniform, who had visited their home. The offender was neither dismissed or suspended but instead promoted to oversee 10 cadet units in London. Further historical cases have been investigated with settlements being made. In the years 2012 to 2017 there were 28 allegations of sexual abuse made against SCC volunteers, including historical allegations. All 28 offenders were dismissed and referred to the police.

Today, Sea Cadets has a &#x27;zero tolerance&#x27; approach to any abuse. A national specialist safeguarding team manages all cases in line with the charity&#x27;s safeguarding policy, procedures and statutory responsibilities. The charity has a 24/7 safeguarding incident reporting line. All staff and volunteers are recruited following &quot;safer recruitment practices&quot;, including enhanced criminal record checks for all who work directly with children and young people. The charity promotes a culture of safety alongside its own safeguarding support systems, including whistle-blowing procedures.

<doc id="596906" wikidata="Q173928" url="?curid=596906" title="Sha (Cyrillic)">
<text>Sha, She or Shu, alternatively transliterated ≈†a (–®¬†—à; italics: &quot;–®¬†—à&quot;) is a letter of the Glagolitic and Cyrillic scripts. It commonly represents the voiceless postalveolar fricative , like the pronunciation of sh in &quot;ship&quot;. More precisely, the sound in Russian denoted by —à is commonly transcribed as a palatoalveolar fricative but is actually a voiceless retroflex fricative . It is used in every variation of the Cyrillic alphabet for Slavic and non-Slavic languages.

In English, Sha is romanized as sh or as ≈°, the latter being the equivalent letter in the Latin alphabets of Czech, Slovak, Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian, Latvian and Lithuanian.

==History==
Sha has its earliest origins in Phoenician Shin and is possibly linked closely to Shin&#x27;s Greek equivalent: Sigma (Œ£, œÉ, œÇ). (The similar form of the modern Hebrew Shin (◊©), which is probably where the Cyrillic letter was actually derived from, derives from the same Proto-Canaanite source). Sha already possessed its current form in Saints Cyril and Methodius&#x27;s Glagolitic alphabet. Most Cyrillic letter-forms were derived from the Greek, but as there was no Greek sign for the Sha sound (modern Greek uses simply &quot;Œ£/œÉ/œÇ&quot; to spell the sh-sound in foreign words and names), Glagolitic Sha (‚∞û) was adopted unchanged. There is also a possibility that Sha was taken from the Coptic alphabet, which is the same as the Greek alphabet but with a few letters added at the end, including one called &quot;shai&quot; (œ¢œ£) which somewhat resembles both sha and shcha (–©, —â) in appearance. There is also a possibility that Sha was taken from the Arabic letter ÿ¥.

== Usage ==
Sha is used in the alphabets of all Slavic languages using a Cyrillic alphabet, and of most non-Slavic languages which use a Cyrillic alphabet. The position in the alphabet and the sound represented by the letter vary from language to language.
==Use in mathematics==
The Cyrillic letter –® is internationally used in mathematics for several concepts:

In algebraic geometry, the Tate‚ÄìShafarevich group of an Abelian variety &quot;A&quot; over a field &quot;K&quot; is denoted –®(&quot;A&quot;/&quot;K&quot;), a notation first suggested by J. W. S. Cassels. (Previously it had been denoted &quot;TS&quot;.) Presumably the choice comes from the first letter of –®–∞—Ñ–∞—Ä–µÃÅ–≤–∏—á = Shafarevich.

In a different mathematical context, some authors allude to the shape of the letter Sha when they use the term &quot;Shah function&quot; for what is otherwise called a Dirac comb.

The shuffle product is often denoted by —à.

<doc id="596907" wikidata="Q2900944" url="?curid=596907" title="Liar's poker">
<text>Liar&#x27;s poker is an American bar game that combines statistical reasoning with bluffing, and is played with the eight numerical digits of the serial number on U.S. dollar bills (that is, excluding the letters/symbols which appear just before and after the eight numerical digits). The digits are usually ranked with the 1 as &quot;ace&quot; as the highest value, followed by 0 as &quot;10&quot;, down to 2 as the lowest. Each player holds one bill, unseen by the other players. The objective is to guess how often a particular digit appears among all the bills held by all the players. Each guess or bid must be higher in quantity, or equal in quantity but higher in value, than the previous bid. The round ends when all the other players challenge a bid.

The game is similar in structure to Liar&#x27;s dice.

In his 1989 book &quot;Liar&#x27;s Poker&quot;, Michael Lewis details how Salomon Brothers traders would play liar&#x27;s poker. He recounts how John Meriwether was once challenged by CEO John Gutfreund to a game of liar&#x27;s poker for stakes of one million dollars. Gutfreund then declined to play when confronted by a counter-offer of ten million from Meriwether.

==Gameplay==
Each player takes a dollar bill and looks at its serial number without letting any other players see it.

The starting player makes an opening bid on how many of a particular digit appears across all serial numbers held by the group. For example, if the first player bids three 6s, they are predicting there are at least three 6s among all the players including their own note. The next player can bid a higher value at that quantity (three 7s), any value at a higher quantity (four 5s), or challenge the bid. The game continues clockwise around the table until a particular bid is challenged by every other player. If the challenge is correct, and the total number of the digit on all the bills is lower than the bid, the bidder loses a dollar to each of the other players. If the challenge is incorrect, the bidder wins a dollar from each player.

<doc id="596910" wikidata="Q1781646" url="?curid=596910" title="Army Cadet Force">
<text>The Army Cadet Force (ACF), generally shortened to Army Cadets, is a national youth organisation sponsored by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Ministry of Defence and the British Army. Along with the Sea Cadet Corps and the Air Training Corps, the ACF make up the Community Cadet Forces. It is a separate organisation from the Combined Cadet Force which provides similar training within principally private schools.

Although sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, the ACF is not part of the British Army, and as such cadets are not subject to military &#x27;call up&#x27;. Some cadets do, however, go on to enlist in the armed forces later in life.

The Army Cadet Charitable Trust UK (ACCT UK) is a registered charity that acts in an advisory role to the Ministry of Defence and other Government bodies on matters connected with the ACF.

As of 1 April 2023, there are 38,180 cadets, and 8,020 Cadet Force Adult Volunteers (CFAVs).

== History ==
In 1859 the British Army was heavily committed to suppressing the Indian Mutiny which left a shortage of Armed Troops in Britain to dissuade or repel a French invasion which at the time was a very real threat. At this time the War Office made the decision to organize local Militia units (predecessors of the Territorial Army), into a nationwide Volunteer Reserve Force which it names &quot;the Volunteers&quot;. A number of these Volunteers formed their own Cadet Companies, and during the 1860 Volunteer review by Queen Victoria one unit - the Queen&#x27;s Westminster&#x27;s - paraded their Cadet Company alongside their adult Companies. At this time some public schools had started to form independent cadet units, and at least eight are known to have been in existence at this point (fore-runners of the Combined Cadet Force).

In 1889 renowned social reformer Miss Octavia Hill formed the first independent Cadet Battalion in Southwark. Octavia Hill considered strongly that the military context of the Volunteer Cadet Companies could be used to socialise urban youths struggling for direction, and wrote that &quot;There is no organisation which I have found that influences the boys so powerfully for good as our cadets ... and if such ideals can be brought before the young lad before he gets in with a gang of loafers it may make all the difference to his life&quot;. At this time recruitment for the Cadet Forces was limited to young men &quot;who had passed the age of make-believe&quot;; Hill invited a serving officer of the Derbyshire Regiment to set up the company, and such was its popularity that its numbers had to be capped at 160 cadets.

The late Victorian period was when the time of social change began to take hold in Britain and Adam Gray - who was considered to be a pioneer in Social Work - founded Independent Cadet Corps units. The formation of Cadet units also spread to the colonies. The Bermuda Cadet Corps was formed at the turn of the Century with detachments in the schools of the British Army&#x27;s Bermuda Garrison and the Royal Navy&#x27;s dockyard, as well as a handful of civilian schools; its cadets wore the cap badge of the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps, to which the Bermuda Cadet Corps was attached.

In 1908, when the Territorial Force was formed, both the Volunteer and Independent Cadet Companies came under the control of the Territorial Forces Association under the new name of the Cadet Force, whilst the Public School units were part of the Officer Training Corps.

In 1914 at the onset of World War I there was a massive expansion of the Cadet Force; at this time the War Office took back control of the organisation and administration of all Cadet Forces from their Territorial Associations and once again integrated the units into the central war effort.

During World War I, the War Office extended the earning of Certificate &quot;A&quot;, which with Certificate &quot;B&quot;, had been used by the OTCs (Officer Training Corps), to the Cadets. This became the goal for most Cadets until the Army Proficiency Certificate tests were introduced. The tests covered many aspects of infantry training, including drill, map reading, weapon training and shooting, fieldcraft (also known as Battle-drill), fitness, and command instruction.

The award of the certificate permitted the holder to wear a four-pointed star (red with khaki edgings) on the lower sleeve. A technical certificate (Certificate &quot;T&quot;) was also developed, in 1943, covering engineering knowledge. The award of this gave another four-pointed star, but with the centre in blue. The holder of a Certificate &quot;T&quot; was assured entry into one of the technical corps (RE, RAOC, or REME) on being called up. A Certificate &quot;A&quot; holder was given a shorter training period.

In 1923, as a result of defence cut-backs, all governmental and military support for the Cadet Force was withdrawn, and Cadets were prohibited from wearing regimental insignia, buttons, or badges. This led to the forming of the British National Cadet Association (BNCA) by notable figures such as Lord Allenby who were keen to ensure the survival of the Cadet Force, and who lobbied the Government for both support and funding. This was partially successful during the 1930s, and in 1932 the BNCA was permitted to run the Cadet Force under the guidance of the Territorial Associations.

At the onset of World War II the Cadet Forces supported the Home Guard at a time when there was a significant threat of German invasion; this led to the War Office in 1942 re-assuming administration of Cadet Forces, which at this time consisted of the Cadet Force, Sea Cadet Corps (SCC), and the Air Training Corps (ATC) (named in 1941). When it resumed administration in 1942, the title Army Cadet Force (ACF) was bestowed upon the Cadet Force, leading in 1945 to the BNCA changing its name to the Army Cadet Force Association (ACFA). In 1948 those elements of the Army Cadet Force that came under School administration (approximately 100 units) were split from the ACF and were granted the title Combined Cadet Force (CCF).

In 1956, with World War II over and with National Service coming to an end, the government set up the Amery Committee to report on the future organisation and training of Cadets. Citizenship training was one of the needs and main benefits identified. During this period all Cadet organisations, including the ACF, participated in a pilot scheme for The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award; to date it remains one of the UK&#x27;s largest operating authorities of the Award.

Following the publication of the Amery Report by the government in 1957, the ACF assumed its role as a national youth organisation sponsored by the War Office. This sponsorship remains in place - however, current sponsorship is provided by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), as the War Office was renamed in 1967.

In 1959, also as a result of the Amery Report, a centralized Cadet Training Centre was established at Frimley Park, which remains the home of the Cadet Forces.

In 1960 the ACF celebrated its 100th anniversary with a review of the ACF and CCF in the grounds of Buckingham Palace by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal Highness Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh. At this time the Duke of Edinburgh presented a banner to the ACF.

Prior to 1982, females were unable to join the ACF, though they were able to join an attached unit (if there was one at that location) of the Girls Venture Corps which had been formed in the early years of the Second World War. Female instructors and cadets were formally enrolled into the ACF following numerous pilot schemes over several years; this led to the introduction of the ACF APC Syllabus in 1990, which noticeably dropped the requirement for hand-to-hand combat and included a major overhaul of instruction, tactics, and subjects. Today nearly 30% of Army Cadets are girls.

In 2010 the Cadet movement celebrated its 150th anniversary with over 150 events in communities up and down the country, and beyond, under the banner of Cadet 150. The main ceremonial event took place on 6 July 2010, when over 1,700 Cadets and adult volunteers paraded down the Mall for inspection by His Royal Highness, Charles the Prince of Wales before joining friends, family, and VIP guests at a garden party in the grounds of Buckingham Palace.

The Army Cadet Force was also a member of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS), as an organisation with a voluntary and community youth focus until it closed in 2016.

In 2018, after the theft of three Drill Purpose L103A2 rifles (modified SA80 assault rifles) from an Army Cadet Hall in Newport-on-Tay Drill purpose rifles have been taken into quarantine by the MOD; it was realised during the ensuing police investigation that the Drill Purpose rifles could be modified to fire live rounds.

In 2021 the Army Cadet Force Association (ACFA) was renamed the Army Cadet Charitable Trust UK(ACCTUK). This organisation is a registered charity and continues to play a vital role in the life of the ACF.

=== Investigation into sexual abuse ===
In 2012, payouts made to victims of sexual abuse across all Cadet Forces totalled ¬£1,475,844. In 2013 payouts totalled ¬£64,782, and in 2014 payouts totalled ¬£544,213. In 2017, a BBC Panorama episode entitled &quot;Cadet Abuse Cover-Up&quot; highlighted sexual abuse cases in the Community Cadet Forces. In the years 2012 to 2017 there were 201 allegations of sexual abuse made against ACF volunteers, including historical allegations. 158 cases were referred to the Police for investigation, and 62 offenders were dismissed.

=== Deaths on Exercises ===
The Cadet Forces follow a tight safety programme, and as such injury&#x27;s or more serious incidents are rare. 
A freedom of information request to the Ministry of Defence revealed that a total of 10 cadets have died whilst taking part in cadet duties and activities. 5 fatalities were due to Road Traffic Accidents, 3 fatalities were due to aircraft accidents, 1 fatality was due to a boating incident and 1 fatality was due to substance abuse. In 1998, a cadet was fatally injured on a fieldcraft training exercise.

== Structure and organisation ==
Most British counties have centralised cadet forces that make up the ACF as a national whole. The counties, or sectors in London, are generally split into companies, each of which includes several detachments, the name given to a unit of cadets that parade in a particular town or village. Some battalions or Counties are affiliated with a certain Regiment or Corps within the British Army, and wear their insignia including cap badge, colour of beret and stable belt subject to individual County/Area regulations. In other battalions or counties each detachment is individually affiliated to a Regiment or Corps within the British Army. Detachments are usually called by the name of the place in which they are based or those attached to schools may use the name of the school.

== Cadet Force Adult Volunteers ==
Adults may join the ACF to instruct through two different routes ‚Äì as an Adult Instructor (AI) or as a Commissioned Officer.

=== Adult Instructors ===
Prospective Adult Instructors begin as a Civilian Assistant (CA) before passing an enhanced disclosure. After completing the Familiarization and Assessment weekend (F&amp;A) the Adult Volunteer is appointed as a Probationary Instructor (PI) at this stage they gain the use of the title Cadet Force Adult Volunteer (CFAV). They will attend 1 further training event to be classed as a &quot;Safe Person&quot; after completing modules on child protection, unit administration and introduction to the ACF. After this event the CFAV will attend further training at county / sector level. Only once completed they are invited to attend an Advanced Instructors Course (AIC) held over one week at brigade level and run by a Cadet Training Team (CTT). On successful completion of this course they will be appointed to the rank of Sergeant Instructor (SI). Progressive training takes place for Adult Instructors, as with cadets, an Adult Instructor may take part in a variety of different courses. An example of a further course which takes place at CTC Frimley Park is the Adult Leadership and Management Course. On successful completion of a course like this (which demonstrates the ability to plan and manage detachment level training) an AI is eligible for promotion to the rank of Staff Sergeant Instructor (SSI). The Exercise Conducting Officer&#x27;s (ECO) and Cadet Drill instructor Course (CADIC) are also available to AIs and the further ranks of Sergeant Major Instructor (SMI) and Regimental Sergeant Major Instructor (RSMI) are possible on completion of the King George VI course. Adult Instructors will be expected to work in a team with their superiors and senior cadets they are responsible for, to deliver effective training to the cadets.

=== Officers ===
The other route a Cadet Force Adult Volunteer (CFAV) in the ACF may take is that of becoming a commissioned officer. The CFAV will apply and partake in the same selection process as above, however once a Probationary Instructor, the individual may apply or be nominated to become a commissioned officer. To do so, as of 2006, the individual must then attend a Cadet Forces Commissions Board (CFCB), similar to an Army Officer Selection Board though less physically demanding. The applicant will be assessed on their literacy, problem solving, and leadership ability. Successful applicants will then be appointed to a Cadet Forces Commission, which replaced the previous Army Reserve General List Group B commission in 2017. Commissioned Officers in the ACF will hold senior leadership roles with more responsibility and commitment attached than roles occupied by Adult Instructors, for example detachment commander or within their Company HQs.

=== Staff costs ===
The Cadet Force is one of the few voluntary organisations that pays its volunteer staff for their time as an optional Volunteers Allowance (VA). These staff can receive up to 50 days pay per year (Depending on unit size and local budgets), they also receive subsistence and travel expenses for attendance on evenings, weekends and annual camps. In 2009/10 pay bill for ACF part-time staff was ¬£14,632,160 and their expenses totalled ¬£368,349. The cost of full-time staff was estimated at around a further ¬£6,250,000 of public funds.

=== Safeguarding ===
Like most organisations involving young people, all adult volunteers are required to undergo a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check before having unsupervised contact with cadets. They must also receive safeguarding training when joining and must receive update training every 12 months. All ACF counties have a Training Safety Advisor (TSA) who is responsible for reviewing the safety aspects of all training.

== Activities ==

=== Army Cadet Syllabus ===

Army Cadet Syllabus [ACS] (the army cadet syllabus brought about in June 2022) is the training syllabus of the ACF and is divided into five levels each covering the core subjects but in more detail as they progress.
* Basic/Recruit (introductory training)
* 1 Star (cadets learn the rudiments of each subject)
* 2 Star (cadets learn each subject in more depth)
* 3 Star (cadets master each subject)
* 4 Star (complete two progressive subjects or courses)
* Master Cadet (cadets must successfully complete the Master Cadet Course held at CTC Frimley following a recommendation from their Cadet Commandant). Cadets must have passed Senior Cadet Instructors Cadre (SCIC) and 4 Star Fieldcraft before attempting the Master Cadet course.

=== Core subjects ===

* Drill and Turnout
* Military Knowledge
* Fieldcraft
* Skill at Arms
* Shooting
* Navigation
* Expedition Training
* First Aid
* Physical Training
* Cadet in the Community

==== Drill and turnout ====

Cadets are taught a subset of the drill movements taught to the regular army. They begin by learning basic foot drill and progress to learn rifle drill and banner drill. They are also taught how to wear and service their issued uniform.

==== Fieldcraft ====
In fieldcraft lessons, cadets learn infantry skills such as patrolling, section battle drills, ambush drills, harbour routines, and how to survive in the field. Field exercises can take place once every few months, and at annual camp. On exercise, cadets wear Multi-Terrain Pattern camouflage clothing, camouflage cream 
(and use other skills to enhance the individuals personal camouflage), a cadet training vest or PLCE webbing to carry rifle magazines, water bottles and emergency rations, and a bergen to carry a sleeping bag and basha (improvised shelter) building materials. Cadets are issued with 24-hour ration packs (coequally known as rat packs) and solid fuel cookers as used by the infantry. As part of a platoon, cadets set up harbour areas (operations bases), post , and send out patrols to carry out reconnaissance, lay ambushes, and assault enemy positions. Cadets become familiar with hand signals for silent communication, and patrol formations for crossing different types of terrain. Scaled down versions of these expeditions are regularly held at a local detachments.

==== Skill at Arms and Shooting====

An Army cadet can train on one of 4 different weapon systems. Each with its own unique characteristics.

&quot;Air Rifle&quot;

Cadets will begin with the BSA Scorpion .177 air rifle introduced in the mid 2010s

The BSA .177 Scorpion Cadet Air Rifle was introduced as an introductory weapon to develop marksmanship, these were purchased and delivered to Cadet units by the ACFA to replace aging .177 El gamo air rifles.

&quot;Small Bore Target Rifle&quot;
Cadets can be trained on the .22 calibre Small Bore Target Rifle.

In 2015 the cadet forces made the decision to start retirement and decommissioning of the No.8 rifle, this was replaced after trials and selection by the L144A1 Cadet Small Bore Target Rifle (CSBTR) manufactured by Savage Arms and rolled out gradually to Counties and Contingents. By early 2018 this roll out was complete.

&quot;L98A2 Cadet GP Rifle&quot;

The primary weapon of the cadet forces is the L98A2 Cadet GP Rifle this is a cadet specific version of the British Armed Forces&#x27; L85A2 SA80 which has been adapted to fire only on repetition (semi-automatic) and therefore does not have a change lever, the weapon system is chambered in the NATO 5.56x45mm cartridge. In order to become proficient in this weapon system the cadet must show they can handle the weapon safely, perform stoppage drills, and strip, clean and maintain the weapon system.

Once deemed competent, the cadet can fire the weapon using blank rounds in field exercises using the Safe Blank Firing System (SBFS) and with live rounds on a range possibly gaining marksman qualification badges based on their accuracy.

There is also a non-firing training version of the GP Rifle, the L103A2 DP (Drill Purpose), this is generally used for teaching cadets the basics of the weapon they are handling and for rifle drill.

&quot;Cadet Target Rifle&quot;

In addition to the L98A2, the cadet forces also use a number of weapons to foster and develop marksmanship and competitive shooting, the largest of these being the L81A2 Cadet Target Rifle which is a cadet version of the Parker-Hale M82. This weapon is chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO. As of late 2024 the MoD and cadet forces have opened discussions to retire the L81 target rifle due to its age amongst other factors, with no current firm plan to replace it after the 2025 shooting season.

&quot;Competitions&quot;

Cadets can enter various shooting competitions, including the ACF Cadet 100 .22 Rifle Competition and the CCRS Country Life (Green Howards) Small-bore .22 Rifle Competition.

Cadets may also be trained on the use of Shotguns to apply the skills towards Clay pigeon shooting.

==== Navigation ====
Cadets are introduced to maps and the use of a compass at a progressive stages during level. They are given the skills to read Ordinance Survey maps, identifying signs and features moving into more complex information utilising the compass such as bearings, back bearings and resection.

Navigation syllabus largely supports the expedition syllabus and the Duke of Edinburgh awards scheme.

==== First aid ====
As part of the training syllabus Cadets are taught First Aid to recognised standards and are awarded relevant certificates in line with the St Johns Ambulance award scheme.

* Basic complete an introduction on the emergency services and how to deal with minor incidents. 
* One Star Cadets build on the knowledge gained at basic level and learn how to deal with other minor injuries.
* Two Star Cadets are required to complete the St John Ambulance Youth First Aid certificate Course
* Three Star Cadets complete part of the Activity First Aid Certificate Course
* Four Star Cadets may choose to complete first aid as one of their progressive subjects. This includes passing the full Activity First Aid Course and completing practical work within their county such as training other cadets for ACS awards or competitions.

==== Cadet in the community ====

These community projects enrich local knowledge and encourage good citizenship, usually a cadet can contribute to their community by charity collection, public parades, assisting local services and helping at public events. This involvement within the community is important for improving confidence and social skills.

==== Communications &amp; Information Systems ====
Communications &amp; Information Systems (CIS) is the name for the signals training in the ACF. Cadets learn about the history of signalling, how to send messages over radios and how to erect masts. They are trained on the following radios:

* PRC 343 PRR
* PRC 710
* PRC 715
* PRC 720

There are also other courses available including things such as Cyber Security. As the cadet progresses they can obtain work towards obtaining an amateur ratio licence.

Cadets can take part in competitions such as Exercise Rolling Thunder, using all the skills taught to compete nationally.

==== Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award ====

The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award is a voluntary, non-competitive programme of practical, cultural and adventurous activities for young people aged 14‚Äì25 (year 9, if they&#x27;re a cadet). A young person can undertake a DofE programme at three levels, Bronze (year 9), Silver (year 10) and Gold (16+). Each have differing criteria for entry and the level of commitment necessary to gain each award. Cadets who meet the age criteria can become DofE participants and work towards their own DofE Award.

Cadets are often encouraged to achieve the Bronze, Silver and Gold awards as they progress through their cadet careers. Many cadet force activities can count towards each level of a participants&#x27; DofE programme and very often gets them recognition for developing skills and giving to their communities. The DofE is widely recognised by employers as it helps demonstrate that young people who hold a Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s are keen to take on new challenges, have a higher level of self-confidence than their counterparts and have leadership qualities with the added experience of teamwork.

Many detachments hold charity events, and participate in various activities such as tree planting, or carrying their standards at a Remembrance Parade in their local area.

==== Leadership training ====
Leadership training is an important part of the ACF training programme, with training available at higher levels too. Most areas run NCO courses, designed to help newly promoted NCOs to perform their duties well, or to train those eligible for promotion. There are also a number of courses run centrally by the ACF. This includes the Junior Cadet Instructors Cadre (run locally at a county level) and the Senior Cadet Instructors Course which is run at a Brigade level by Cadet Training Teams.

==== Master Cadet Course ====
The Master Cadet Course was introduced in 1989 to advance to the leadership, instructional and administrative abilities of post 4-star cadets. It is held at Cadet Training Centre Frimley Park in Surrey. Passing both this course and the Senior Cadet Instructors&#x27; Cadre makes the candidate eligible to be appointed as a Master Cadet.

The following criteria must be met to be eligible for the course:
* Aged 16 years old or older
* Hold the rank of sergeant or above
* Have passed fieldcraft as a progressive subject at 4-star level

==== Cadet Leadership Courses ====
The Aim of the Cadet Leadership Courses (CLC) is:
&quot;To develop cadets&#x27; initiative and self-reliance and to exercise them in the problems of practical leadership.&quot;

The course is open to members of all the Cadet Forces (SCC, ACF, ATC and CCF) providing they are over 16 and have passed their APC 3 star or equivalent. Each Course has 120 places and is focused on leadership training and assessment, which is developed through a variety of activities including:
* Minor Tactics
* Watermanship Training
* Command Tasks
* Sport
* Skill-at-Arms
* Endurance Training

The courses are run by Brigade Cadet Training Teams at varying locations every year, usually at Easter and Autumn half term.

==== Cadet Vocational Courses ====
The Cadet Vocational College (CVC) gives opportunities for cadet and adult volunteers to gain vocational qualifications, alongside their day job or school to enhance their future prospects. Some of the syllabi aligning with that already delivered during normal training.

The CVC state that &quot;We are an education charity dedicated to improving lives through vocational education by recognising and validating the skills that young people and their adult instructors develop within their cadet or uniformed youth organisation.&quot;

== Uniform ==
All Cadets and CFAVs are issued with Personal Clothing System Combat Uniform (PCS-CU) in Multi-Terrain Pattern (MTP). Cadets are scaled to receive the following:
* Headdress (depends on regimental affiliation) ‚Äì Beret, Tam o&#x27; Shanter, Glengarry or Caubeen
* Two PCS Lightweight Jackets
* Two pairs of PCS trousers
* PCS Windproof Smock
* Thermal Undershirt
* Two Olive Undershirts
* Working Belt
* two pairs of woolly socks

Some counties may charge a small deposit for uniform that is refundable on its return. All CFAVs must have &quot;ACF&quot; visible at all times on their uniform and cadets wear rank slides titled &quot;CADET&quot;. Boots must be purchased by the cadet or their parents if not supplied.
The ACF has its own stable belt which can be worn by cadets and instructors, but they can also wear the stable belt of their affiliated regiment/corps. Stable belts can be worn by cadets of any rank but many counties impose local requirements such as star level or rank. They may be issued at the expense of the detachment or company but are usually a private purchase item.

Tactical Recognition Flashes are not to be worn by Cadet Force Adult Volunteers (CFAVs) or cadets irrespective of any affiliation to a Corps or Regiment. Cadets and CFAVs do wear county and contingent flashes of the Army Cadet Force.

=== Mayor&#x27;s Cadet ===
Some mayors appoint a member of the cadet forces to the role of Mayor&#x27;s Cadet. The cadet may wear a special badge or carry a pace stick to indicate their role.

=== Lord Lieutenant&#x27;s Cadet ===
Cadets can be appointed to this role and are then entitled to wear the Lord Lieutenant&#x27;s Cadet badge as well as issue Number 2 Dress. The cadet will be asked to accompany the Lord Lieutenant on events and parades to represent the cadet forces. Other cadet forces such as Sea Cadet Corps also have this appointment.

== Ranks ==

Ranks in the ACF follow the pattern of those in the British Army.

=== Cadet ranks ===
As well as learning new skills by working through the APC syllabus, experienced cadets can be awarded a rank. As the Army allows its soldiers to take on responsibility and leadership as non-commissioned officers (NCOs), so too does the ACF.
Cadet NCOs wear the issued cadet rank slides, pictured above. The titles of some ranks may vary as cadet detachments are affiliated to Army regiments and adopt their terminology. There is usually only one Cadet RSM per county or sector.

Although promotion is based on merit rather than progression through the APC syllabus, the following criteria must be met before a cadet is eligible for promotion:
* Cadet Lance Corporal ‚Äì Passed ACS 1 Star
* Cadet Corporal ‚Äì Passed ACS 2 Star
* Cadet Sergeant ‚Äì Passed ACS 3 Star and the JCIC course
* Cadet Staff/Colour Sergeant ‚Äì Passed ACS 4 Star and the SCIC course
* Cadet Sergeant Major/Company Sergeant Major ‚Äì Passed APC 4 Star and the SCIC course
* Cadet Regimental Sergeant Major ‚Äì Passed Master Cadet and the SCIC course
* Cadet Under Officer ‚Äì Passed Master Cadet and the SCIC course

In some instances, cadets that do not meet the requirements for these ranks can be promoted with the agreement of the ACF Cadet Commandant.

==== Staff cadets ====
From 2020 cadets who are over the age of 18, have completed APC 3-Star and hold the rank of Sergeant or above can become a &quot;Staff Cadet&quot;. These cadets wear a rank slide with the words &#x27;STAFF CADET&#x27; embroidered above their rank insignia. A staff cadet can remain a cadet until their 20th birthday. As of 2024 the staff cadet programme was suspended, and a waisting out programme was introduced to allow current staff cadets to achieve their goal or rank before stepping down.

=== CFAV ranks ===
The adults who help to run the ACF are collectively known as Cadet Force Adult Volunteers (CFAVs). CFAVs wear the badges of rank as worn by Army NCOs with the addition of the letters ACF under the badge.
=== Officer ranks ===
=== National Honorary Colonel ===
In November 2019, Lorraine Kelly was appointed the first National Honorary Colonel of the Army Cadet Force.

=== National Army Cadet Force Museum ===

Victoria Cross recipient, WO2 Johnson Beharry opened the National Army Cadet Force Museum in Octavia Hill‚Äôs Birthplace House, Wisbech on 11th Sept 2023 to mark Octavia‚Äôs legacy from 1889, when she established the first Independent Army Cadet Unit.

==Biography==
===1936‚Äì1950: Early life and career beginnings===
Stockwell was born into a family of entertainers in the North Hollywood section of Los Angeles, and grew up between there and New York City. He was the younger son of Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; (Veronica) Stockwell, a vaudeville actress, and Harry Stockwell, an actor and lyric baritone singer. His father appeared in New York productions of &quot;Carousel&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, and was the voice of the Prince in Disney&#x27;s 1937 animated feature film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. His elder brother was television and film actor Guy Stockwell. His stepmother, Nina Olivette, was an actress, comedian, singer, and toe dancer in burlesque and theater in New York and throughout North America. His mother&#x27;s family was Italian.

Stockwell&#x27;s father was appearing on Broadway in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; when he heard about a play, &quot;Innocent Voyage&quot; by Paul Osborne, that was looking for child actors. Stockwell&#x27;s mother took their two sons down to audition, and both boys were successful. Stockwell&#x27;s part was small and the play had only a short run, but it led to a contract with MGM.

The studio cast him in a small role in &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot; (1945), a popular melodrama. Producer Joe Pasternak gave him a bigger part in &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; (1945) with Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, where he played the nephew of Kathryn Grayson.

The film was popular, and MGM gave him a key role in &quot;The Green Years&quot; (1946) as Robert Shannon, an Irish Catholic orphan who grows up in a Scottish Presbyterian household. It was a huge hit. He also made a brief appearance in the MGM school room during the chase sequence of &quot;Abbott and Costello in Hollywood&quot; (1945).

20th Century Fox borrowed him for &quot;Home Sweet Homicide&quot; (1946) with Peggy Ann Garner where he was billed fourth. He co-starred with Wallace Beery in &quot;The Mighty McGurk&quot; (1947) at MGM, a remake of &quot;The Champ&quot; (1931) which Beery had made previously with Jackie Cooper. He also had the lead in the short &quot;A Really Important Person&quot; (1947).

He had supporting roles in &quot;The Arnelo Affair&quot; (1947), &quot;The Romance of Rosy Ridge&quot; (1947) (as Janet Leigh&#x27;s brother), and &quot;Song of the Thin Man&quot; (1947), billed fourth as the son of William Powell and Myrna Loy&#x27;s characters. He later said, &quot;I have very positive feelings regarding both of them, they were very sweet people, especially Myrna Loy. And that cute little dog, Asta. I liked that little dog.&quot;

Nevertheless, Stockwell found being a child actor difficult overall, stating, &quot;I didn&#x27;t enjoy acting particularly, when I was young. I thought it was a lot of work. There were a few films that I enjoyed, they were comedies, they were not important films, weren&#x27;t very successful, so I was always pretty much known as a serious kid. I got those kind of roles and I didn&#x27;t care for them very much.&quot; He found that this work meant he didn&#x27;t have any friends except his brother, and he was constantly working, with only one holiday in nine years. He said it was &quot;a miserable way to bring up a child, though neither my parents nor I recognised it at the time&quot;.

Fox borrowed him again to play Gregory Peck&#x27;s son in &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1947), a film which Stockwell &quot;didn&#x27;t like doing at all, because it was so serious. In other words, when I would find out I was going to do another movie, my mother would always bring that news to me, and the first question that I would always ask was, &#x27;Is there a crying scene in the movie?&#x27; And there almost always was.&quot;

He played an orphaned runaway longing to go to sea in &quot;Deep Waters&quot; (1948). He was then borrowed by RKO Pictures to play the title role in &quot;The Boy with Green Hair&quot; (1948) directed by Joseph Losey, a notorious flop for the Dore Schary regime. Stockwell said that &quot;during the production, I did feel that I was part of something that meant something to me, it was important.&quot;

Back at Fox, he was cast as Lionel Barrymore&#x27;s grandson and Richard Widmark&#x27;s prot√©g√© in &quot;Down to the Sea in Ships&quot; (1949), before supporting Margaret O&#x27;Brien at MGM in &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1949), a box office disappointment. Stockwell later described the picture as &quot;More crying scenes! And temper tantrums! But I enjoyed very much working with Margaret, she was a very talented little actress.&quot;

In MGM&#x27;s popular &quot;Stars in My Crown&quot; (1950), which he did not enjoy doing, he was billed third after Joel McCrea and Ellen Drew.

Stockwell was top billed in &quot;The Happy Years&quot;, which lost a considerable amount of money for the studio, but then played the title role in &quot;Kim&quot; (1950) alongside Errol Flynn and Paul Lukas, a big commercial success. During its filming, Flynn played a prank on him in a scene where he was supposed to hand him a bowl of food, instead handing him a bowl of camel dung.

In 1951 Stockwell had a lead role with Joel McCrea in a Western at Universal, &quot;Cattle Drive&quot;.

===1952‚Äì1968: Adult career and hiatus===
Stockwell graduated from Alexander Hamilton High School in Los Angeles, and attended the University of California, Berkeley for a year before dropping out. &quot;I was unhappy and could not get along with people,&quot; he later said. At UC Berkeley, he immersed himself in music and wrote several small compositions.

He took a number of years off and resumed his acting career as an adult in 1956. He guest-starred on shows such as &quot;Front Row Center&quot;, &quot;Matinee Theatre&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Men of Annapolis&quot;, &quot;Cimarron City&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, and &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (in 1957 as &quot;Jimmy Drew&quot;, brother to Shelley Winters in &quot;The Ruth Owens Story&quot;, S1E3, also in 1958, as Juan Ortega in ‚ÄúThe Juan Ortega Story‚Äù S2E2 and again in 1959, as Rodney Lawrence in ‚ÄúThe Rodney Lawrence Story‚Äù, S2E36). He had a supporting role in a Western, &quot;Gun for a Coward&quot; (1957), and the lead role in a low-budget teen melodrama, &quot;The Careless Years&quot; (1957), the feature directorial debut of Arthur Hiller. It was made for Bryna Productions, the company of Kirk Douglas. He signed a five-year deal with the company, but this was the only film he made for them.

In 1957, he starred as Judd Steiner in the Broadway adaptation of &quot;Compulsion&quot;, based on the Leopold and Loeb story. He reprised the role in the 1959 film version, for which he and co-stars Orson Welles and Bradford Dillman shared the 1959 Cannes Film Award for Best Actor. Stockwell continued to work heavily in TV on such shows as &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Johnny Staccato&quot;, and &quot;Buick-Electra Playhouse&quot;.

Stockwell married actress Millie Perkins on April 15, 1960. That year, he played coal miner Walter Morel&#x27;s son Paul Morel in the British film &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;, with Trevor Howard and Wendy Hiller. He later called it &quot;a very delightful film to do&quot;. He continued to work mostly on television, including episodes of &quot;Checkmate&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;, &quot;Outlaws&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; (&quot;The Joke and the Valley&quot;), &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;A Quality of Mercy&quot;), &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, and &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot;. He appeared with Millie Perkins on &quot;Wagon Train&quot; as the lead character in the episode &quot;The Will Santee Story&quot;.

In 1962, Stockwell and Perkins divorced. He appeared in an adaptation of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night&quot; with Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Richardson and Jason Robards, under the direction of Sidney Lumet. He later called it &quot;as intense and rewarding an experience as I&#x27;ve had.&quot; He subsequently guest starred on &quot;Combat!&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, had a six-episode arc on &quot;Dr. Kildare, and&quot; had a supporting part in the feature &quot;Rapture&quot; (1965).

In the mid-1960s, Stockwell dropped out of show business, becoming active in the Topanga Canyon hippie subculture as a close friend of visual artists George Herms and Wallace Berman, fellow child actor and &quot;dropout&quot; Russ Tamblyn, and musician Neil Young. &quot;I did some drugs and went to some love-ins,&quot; he later said. &quot;The experience of those days provided me with a huge, panoramic view of my existence that I didn&#x27;t have before. I have no regrets.&quot; Stockwell once said ‚ÄúThe flower children and the love-ins ‚Ä¶ were the childhood I didn‚Äôt have.&quot;

===1968‚Äì1983: Return to acting===

Stockwell returned to acting with a supporting role in &quot;Psych-Out&quot; (1968) co-starring Susan Strasberg and Jack Nicholson. He guest starred on &quot;Thirty-Minute Theatre&quot; in Britain, &quot;The FBI&quot;, and &quot;Bonanza&quot;, and played the lead in AIP&#x27;s &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; (1970) with Sandra Dee.

He also had a key part in Dennis Hopper&#x27;s &quot;The Last Movie&quot; (1971). In 1985 Stockwell said this film &quot;is a great picture. It was ahead of its time then¬† ‚Äì and it still is¬†... it will gain respect over the years. Dennis Hopper is a marvelous director.&quot;
Stockwell guest starred on &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;The FBI&quot; (again), &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, &quot;Orson Welles&#x27; Great Mysteries&quot;, and &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; and had the lead in some TV movies, &quot;Paper Man&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Failing of Raymond&quot; (1971) as well as a support part in &quot;Adventures of Nick Carter&quot; (1972).

Stockwell had the lead in a biker movie, &quot;The Loners&quot; (1972), the last film of Sam Katzman, which Stockwell called &quot;a mess&quot;, and horror comedy &quot;The Werewolf of Washington&quot; (1973), the script for which he said &quot;had a brilliant edge to it. It was satirical, political, funny, witty and wonderful&quot;, but the director ruined it, according to Stockwell.

During the mid-1970s, he designed the distinctive cover of Neil Young&#x27;s album &quot;American Stars &#x27;n Bars&quot; (1976).

He continued to guest for TV shows such as &quot;Police Surgeon&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Joe Forrester&quot;, &quot;Three for the Road&quot;, &quot;Cannon&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;, &quot;Police Story&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot;, &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;, &quot;Greatest Heroes of the Bible&quot;, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, &quot;The A Team&quot;, and &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;.

He appeared in the occasional feature such as &quot;The Pacific Connection&quot; (1974), &quot;Win, Place or Steal&quot; (1974), &quot;Won Ton Ton: The Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976), &quot;Tracks&quot; (1976) with Dennis Hopper, &quot;One Away&quot; (1976), &quot;A Killing Affair&quot; (1977), &quot;She Came to the Valley&quot; (1979), &quot;Born to Be Sold&quot; (1981), and &quot;Wrong Is Right&quot; (1982).

On December 15, 1981, Stockwell married his second wife, Joy Marchenko, a textiles expert who worked in Morocco. The following year, Stockwell and Neil Young together directed and appeared in &quot;Human Highway&quot; (1982). He starred in &quot;Alsino and the Condor&quot;, a Nicaraguan film, and &quot;To Kill a Stranger&quot; (1983). By this time Stockwell had moved to Taos, New Mexico, and was depressed about the state of his career, turning to real estate to pay the bills. On November 5, 1983, his wife gave birth to their son, Austin.

===1984‚Äì1988: Mainstream comeback and critical success===
In 1984, he appeared in Wim Wenders&#x27;s critically acclaimed film &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;, and in the same year, in David Lynch&#x27;s film version of &quot;Dune&quot; as Wellington Yueh. In between he appeared in &quot;Fox Mystery Theater&quot;. Stockwell later said &quot;After &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; and &quot;Dune&quot; I think I&#x27;ve got a pretty good start on what amounts to a third career.&quot;

Between 1985 and 1988, he was a busy character actor, appearing in 14 films and one telefilm. In 1985, he turned in a brief but significant role as attorney Bob Grimes in William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot;. He was also in &quot;The Legend of Billie Jean&quot; (1985), an episode of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, and &quot;Papa Was a Preacher&quot; (1986). Stockwell&#x27;s second child with wife Marchenko, Sophia, was born on August 5, 1985.

In 1986, Stockwell made an appearance in another Lynch production, the neo-noir thriller &quot;Blue Velvet.&quot; He was in episodes of &quot;Hunter&quot; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, and the films &quot;Gardens of Stone&quot; (1987) (directed by Francis Ford Coppola), &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; (1987), &quot;Kenny Rogers as The Gambler, Part III: The Legend Continues&quot; (1987), &quot;The Time Guardian&quot; (1987), &quot;Banzai Runner&quot; (1987), and &quot;The Blue Iguana&quot; (1987).

In 1988, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Mafia boss Tony &quot;the Tiger&quot; Russo in the comedy &quot;Married to the Mob&quot;. Stockwell later called it &quot;the favorite part I&#x27;ve ever had in a film. I just felt that that part was just perfect for me and I had a way to approach it that I thought was just right and it turned out that way.&quot; Jonathan Demme, who directed the film, said that what made Stockwell special was that he was a &quot;chameleon&quot; and had a &quot;mercurial presence.&quot;

He also had roles in &quot;&quot; (1988) from Coppola, &quot;Smokescreen&quot; (1988), the Brazilian &quot;The Long Haul&quot; (1989), the reboot of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Buying Time&quot; (1989), and &quot;Limit Up&quot; (1989).

<text>A9.com was a subsidiary of Amazon that developed search engine and search advertising technology. A9 was based in Palo Alto, California, with teams in Seattle, Bangalore, Beijing, Dublin, Ia»ôi, Munich and Tokyo. A9 had development efforts in areas of product search, cloud search, visual search, augmented reality, advertising technology and community question answering.

==History==

A9, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, was founded in 2003 with an exclusive focus on producing technology for search and advertising. They moved into the building previously used by the DEC Systems Research Center in Palo Alto, California. One purpose of A9.com was to leverage algorithms, and the name was chosen as a numeronym to represent that word (i.e. &#x27;A&#x27; + 9 other letters). The office was in Silicon Valley, near Stanford University. Under the direction of its first president, Udi Manber, A9 focused on several areas, including the A9.com destination website, product search, and a search advertising platform. Some early A9 services such as &quot;search inside the book&quot; continued, while others have been discontinued. The A9 search engine powered product search for Amazon.com and several other eCommerce retailers.

In February 2006, Manber was replaced by David L. Tennenhouse as president. In September 2006, William Stasior, one of A9&#x27;s founders and a former AltaVista and Amazon.com executive, was named president. In June 2009, A9 acquired SnapTell, which developed smartphone-based visual search applications.

Stasior left in October 2012 to join Apple Inc. to work on Siri. Brian Pinkerton, who had developed WebCrawler in the 1990s, became general manager of A9 in 2012.

Brian Pinkerton was replace by Srikanth Thirumalai, who left when A9 became Amazon Search.

In 2019, after reporting from &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; revealed that Amazon had changed its search algorithm to favor more profitable products, Amazon took down the A9.com site and pointed the domain name to Amazon&#x27;s home page.

==Projects==

===A9.com search portal===

A9.com originally operated a search portal, along with an A9 toolbar, which was first demonstrated on April 14, 2004. The service featured some innovative design elements, allowing users to choose from over 400 sources to search and view results in separate columns grouped by source. In addition to web search results, users could get product search results from Amazon, encyclopedia results from Wikipedia, movie information from IMDb, and others, starting in September 2004. Web search results were provided by different search engines over time. The search portal functionality was discontinued in 2008.

===OpenSearch===

A9 developed a protocol called OpenSearch that enabled the &quot;plug-in&quot; search source functionality from the A9.com portal. The original specification, OpenSearch 1.0, was released in March 2005. A9 made the protocol freely available through a Creative Commons license.

===BlockView===

A9 developed the first service that allowed users of maps and &quot;yellow pages&quot; (a telephone directory) to view buildings at street level. Called BlockView, the service was announced in January 2005. Within a year, the service included images for 24 US cities. Both BlockView and maps (as well as support for the A9 tool bar) were discontinued in September 2006.

===Clickriver===

In November 2006, A9 announced Clickriver, an advertising program that let third parties place advertisements on Amazon.com pages.
Clickriver focused primarily on products and services that complemented Amazon&#x27;s own offerings. For example, if a customer viewed a television on Amazon, a Clickriver ad might offer installation services in his or her local area. Clickriver was discontinued in 2010, replaced by other Amazon advertising programs.

=== Community question answering ===
A9 operated Askville, a community-based question-and-answer site first tested in December 2006. Service began in November 2007. Compared with other question-and-answer sites, Askville focused more on social interaction, allowing users to follow other users as well as track specific topics.
On October 25, 2013, Askville was shut down.

===CloudSearch===
CloudSearch is a managed Amazon Web Services service that makes client data searchable. For example, a business that wanted to allow customers to search their catalog could upload the catalog entries to CloudSearch and then route search requests from their application or web site to the service. CloudSearch instances could be brought online as data or traffic volume demanded. Sites using CloudSearch included SmugMug, and Sage Bionetworks.

In March 2014, Amazon moved away from using A9 for CloudSearch to technology based on Apache Solr.

===Product search===
A9 continued to develop and operate the service that provides search on all nine Amazon.com sites, as well as other retail sites owned by Amazon such as Endless.com, Javari.de, and Audible.com. In addition, A9 search is also used by other retailers, such as Marks &amp; Spencer, that license the Amazon retail platform for their online presence.

A9 provided the &quot;search inside the book&quot; capability for Amazon. Announced in 2003, this service allows customers to search through the full text of hundreds of thousands of books. This feature is available both for searching individual books and for the entire book catalog.

===Visual search===

The visual search group at A9 created mobile applications that recognize objects and allow users to find these products on Amazon.com. Their first augmented reality app, Flow, provided both object and barcode recognition. It was released in 2011.

A9 visual search technology powers features to let customers search for certain products (such as shoes) by shape, and find visually similar items on Amazon.com, Zappos.com, Endless.com, and other retail sites.

===Advertising technology===

A9&#x27;s advertising technology group began delivering sponsored link advertisements on the Amazon.com retail Web site in 2003 and continued to manage this program for Amazon properties. A9 also invested in display advertising technology, including technology for Amazon&#x27;s ad-supported e-reader, the Kindle with special offers.

<text>John Angus MacLean (May 15, 1914 ‚Äì February 15, 2000) was a politician and farmer in Prince Edward Island, Canada.

He was an alumnus of both Mount Allison University and the University of British Columbia with degrees in science. MacLean left farming to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, serving from 1939 to 1947 and achieving the rank of Wing Commander.

MacLean&#x27;s bomber was shot down, and he evaded capture in Nazi-occupied Europe with the help of the Belgian escape-line Com√®te with Andr√©e De Jongh.

MacLean returned to Prince Edward Island after the war, and ran for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as a Progressive Conservative Party of Canada candidate, but was defeated in the 1945 and 1949 federal elections.

He was first elected to Parliament in a 1951 by-election and held his seat continuously until he left federal politics in 1976. MacLean served in the cabinet of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker as Minister of Fisheries from 1957 until the government&#x27;s defeat in the 1963 election.

In 1976, MacLean was persuaded to leave federal politics and take the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island which had languished in opposition for a decade. On 8 November 1976, MacLean was elected to the provincial legislature in a by-election. MacLean led the party to victory in 1979, and formed a government that emphasized rural community life, banned new shopping malls and instituted a Royal Commission to examine land use and sprawl. His government cancelled the province&#x27;s participation in the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station in New Brunswick.

On 17 August 1981, MacLean announced his intention to resign as premier upon electing a new party leader. MacLean retired as premier on 17 November 1981, when James Lee was sworn-in as his successor and did not run in the 1982 provincial election. He returned to the family farm that he redeveloped for low-intensity blueberry farming. A respected steward of the land and of rural communities, MacLean was a committed Presbyterian of Scottish descent. In 1991, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

He died in Charlottetown on February 15, 2000.

<text>Pagan metal is a genre of heavy metal music which fuses extreme metal with &quot;the pre-Christian traditions of a specific culture or region&quot; through thematic concept, rustic melodies, unusual instruments or archaic languages, usually referring to folk metal or black metal. The Norwegian band In the Woods... was one of the first bands commonly viewed as pagan metal. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; author Marc Halupczok wrote that Primordial&#x27;s song &quot;To Enter Pagan&quot; from the band&#x27;s demo &quot;Dark Romanticism&quot; contributed to defining the genre.

== Characteristics ==

Pagan metal is &quot;more of an idea than a genre&quot; and consequently bands tend to be &quot;wildly different&quot; from one another. Bassist Jarkko Aaltonen of the band Korpiklaani notes that bands singing about &quot;Vikings or other ancient tribes of people are all labelled as pagan&quot;, regardless of whether they use folk instruments. Heri Joensen expressed a similar description of pagan metal as bands that sing about &quot;pre-Christian, European traditions, be they historical or mythological&quot; and notes that it is &quot;musically extremely diverse because it is more about the lyrics than the music&quot;. Some bands are known to be &quot;sprightly and spirited&quot; while others are &quot;bleak and doomy&quot;. Vocal styles range from &quot;melodic chanting to unearthly growling&quot; and while some acts sing in their native language, others sing in English.

Pagan metal bands are often associated with Viking metal and folk metal. Bands such as Moonsorrow and Kampfar have been identified as fitting within all three of those genres.

== History ==

Led Zeppelin and Manowar had already explored pagan themes in the 1970s and 1980s though pagan metal bands share few if any similarities, preferring instead to credit the influence of bands such as Bathory, Enslaved, Amorphis, and Skyclad. Bathory and Enslaved are also known as Viking metal bands while Amorphis and Skyclad are also known as folk metal bands.

Jarkko Aaltonen notes that Black Sabbath &quot;was quite pagan&quot; as well but of &quot;the current metal scene&quot;, he credits Skyclad as starting &quot;the mix of traditional folk-rock music with mythology-concentrated lyrics&quot;. Chrigel Glanzmann of Eluveitie similarly credits Skyclad as the first pagan metal band, remarking that the band had mixed heavy metal music with Celtic folk music &quot;in a way that was really inspiring&quot;. The author Ian Christe has also identify Skyclad as the pioneers of pagan metal. In contrast, Heri Joensen credits Bathory as the first pagan metal act instead, noting that Bathory had gotten &quot;tired of the childishness of satanic lyrics, so they added some cultural weight by going to Nordic mythology&quot;. Alan A. Nemtheanga of Primordial remarks that one &quot;can see the formation of pagan metal&quot; in Bathory&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Blood Fire Death&quot;. He also contends that Bathory &quot;were copying Manowar, which most people don&#x27;t like to admit&quot;. Mathias Nyg√•rd of Turisas identified Amorphis as the first pagan metal band for playing &quot;a huge role in guiding us in the direction we are now&quot;.

In April 2008, performers on the folk and pagan metal festival Paganfest were subject to accusations of being neo-Nazis and fascists from the Berliner Institut f√ºr Faschismusforschung. Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow and Heri Joensen of T√Ωr issued a joint video statement to refute these accusations, noting that &quot;one of the biggest issues seems to be that we use ancient Scandinavian symbols in our imagery like the S in the Moonsorrow logo and the T in the T√Ωr logo [even though] that is how the S and the T runes have been written for thousands of years&quot;. Moonsorrow has also issued a written statement in response to the controversy while T√Ωr notes on their official website that they &quot;got the idea for the rune logo&quot; from the Black Sabbath album of the same name. Other pagan metal bands such as Skyforger have also disassociated themselves from Nazism, fascism or racism. Skyforger went as far as to add the words &#x27;No Nazi Stuff Here!&#x27; on the back of their album covers.

As of 2009, the genre has become something of a phenomenon. Mikael Karlbom of Finntroll feels that pagan metal has become something of a trend. Jarkko Aaltonen of Korpiklaani expresses a similar opinion and laments the number of people &quot;jumping on a bandwagon&quot;. Johan Hegg of Amon Amarth has distanced his band from the trend, stating that &quot;We don‚Äôt really see ourselves as one of those bands doing pagan folklore music.&quot;

<text>Ernst Toch (; 7 December 1887 ‚Äì 1 October 1964) was an Austrian composer of European classical music and film scores, who from 1933 worked as an √©migr√© in Paris, London and New York. He sought throughout his life to introduce new approaches to music.

== Biography ==
Toch was born in Leopoldstadt, Vienna, into the family of a humble Jewish leather dealer when the city was at its 19th-century cultural zenith. He studied philosophy at the University of Vienna, medicine at Heidelberg and music at the Hoch Conservatory (1909‚Äì1913) in Frankfurt. His main instrument was the piano, and he was a pianist of considerable stature, performing to acclaim throughout much of western Europe. Much of his writing was intended for the piano.

Toch continued to grow as an artist and composer throughout his adult life, and in America came to influence whole new generations of composers. His first compositions date from c. 1900 and were pastiches in the style of Mozart (quartets, 1905 album verses for piano). His first quartet was performed in Leipzig in 1908, and his sixth (Opus 12, 1905) in the year 1909. In 1909, his Chamber Symphony in F major (written 1906) won the Frankfurt/Main Mozart prize. From this time onwards, Toch dedicated himself to being a full-time composer. He won the Mendelssohn prize for composition in 1910. In 1913, he was appointed lecturer of both piano and composition at the College of Music in Mannheim. After winning a further five major prizes for his works, he served four years in the army on the Italian Front during World War I. In 1916, he married Lilly Zwack, the daughter of a banker.

After World War I, he returned to Mannheim to compose, developing a new style of polyphony. He received his Ph.D. degree from Heidelberg University in 1921. He then taught on the faculty of the Mannheim Conservatory where one of his pupils was Hugo Chaim Adler.

Following Hitler&#x27;s seizure of power in 1933, Toch went into exile, first to Paris and then London, where Berthold Viertel and Elisabeth Bergner helped him find work as a composer for the cinema. Films scored during this period included &quot;Catherine the Great&quot;, &quot;Little Friend&quot; and &quot;The Private Life of Don Juan&quot;. In 1935, he accepted an invitation from Alvin Johnson of the New School for Social Research to go to New York City. He could, however, only secure his living in California by composing film music for Hollywood, completing 16 scores. Unlike his colleague Erich Wolfgang Korngold Toch never got much attention in the industry and was rarely top-billed, although he did win three Academy Award nominations - for &quot;Peter Ibbetson&quot; (1935), &quot;Ladies in Retirement&quot; (1941) and &quot;Address Unknown&quot; (1944). His score for the chase scene in Shirley Temple&#x27;s 1937 &quot;Heidi&quot; perhaps remains his best-known piece of film music.

During his residence in California, he was a professor at the University of Southern California, where he taught both music and philosophy. He was also a guest lecturer at Harvard University. In 1958, he received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (Grand Merit Cross). He died in Santa Monica, California, and was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. He is the grandfather of authors Lawrence Weschler and Toni Weschler.

== Work ==
Toch wrote eight string quartets before the war and five afterwards. No 9 (1919) marked a significant stylistic change, shifting from the influence of Brahms towards a more radical, extended tonality and linear development. During the 1920s Toch was considered one of the great avant-garde composers. His work during that decade included the Cello Concerto (1925) and the humorous &quot;Bunte Suite&quot; (1929), but also two short operas, &quot;Die Prinzessin auf der Erbse&quot; (1927) and &quot;Egon und Emilie&quot; (1928), notable examples of the short-lived Zeitoper genre. These led him towards the full-length three act opera &quot;Der F√§cher&quot; of 1930.
That year he also invented &quot;Gesprochene Musik,&quot; the idiom of the &quot;spoken chorus&quot;, a technique used in his most performed work, &quot;Fuge aus der Geographie&quot;, which he himself regarded as an unimportant diversion.

Between 1950 and 1964 he wrote seven symphonies. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1956 for his Third Symphony (premiered by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra on December 2, 1955). He also wrote books dealing with musical theory: &quot;Melodielehre&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Shaping Forces in Music&quot; (1948). His notable students included Vagn Holmboe, Andr√© Previn and Richard Wernick.

<text>Sir Ernest Alexander Campbell MacMillan, (18 August 1893 ‚Äì 6 May 1973) was a Canadian orchestral conductor, composer, organist, and Canada&#x27;s only &quot;Musical Knight&quot;. He is widely regarded as being Canada&#x27;s pre-eminent musician from the 1920s through the 1950s. His contributions to the development of music in Canada were sustained and varied, as conductor, performer, composer, administrator, lecturer, adjudicator, writer, humourist, and statesman.

==Biography==

===Early life and education (1893‚Äì1914)===

Ernest Alexander Campbell MacMillan was born in Mimico (Etobicoke), Ontario. His first musical influences were his parents. From a very young age, he became fascinated while watching his mother play piano and decided to learn music. His father, who was a minister at St. Enoch&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, bought an organ for a new house the family moved to in 1898. The house had an adjoined drawing room and study room, with enough space for both an organ and piano. Thereafter, Macmillan was officially hooked.

Macmillan started studying the organ at the age of 8 with Arthur Blakely. A child prodigy, he gave his first organ recital at the age of ten. His talents astonished the public and critics alike in 1904 when he performed in the &quot;Festival of Lillies&quot;, which &quot;firmly established him a prodigy&quot;. 4000 people were known to attend. Moreover, he was the appointed organist at St. Enoch&#x27;s, which gave him a sense of importance and great experience in accompanying singers. Between 1908 and 1910, MacMillan held his first professional appointment as an organist and choirmaster in Toronto at Knox (Presbyterian) Church. In 1910 he had his first official organ recital. After that, he performed elsewhere in Toronto until 1914. He earned the associateship and fellowship diplomas of the Royal College of Organists, and from 1911 to 1914 studied modern history at the University of Toronto, earning a BA. He was a member of the Canadian fraternity, Phi Kappa Pi.

===Internment in Germany (1914‚Äì1919)===

MacMillan travelled to Paris in the spring of 1914 and began to study piano privately with Th√©r√®se Chaigneau. He was visiting Bayreuth, Germany, to attend performances of the Bayreuth Festival, when the First World War began in August, following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June. MacMillan was initially detained by the German police, and then imprisoned as an enemy alien, as Canada had declared war on Imperial Germany on 5 August. MacMillan was subsequently interned for the duration of the war at Ruhleben, a British civilian detention camp, located on the site of a former horse racing track, on the outskirts of Berlin. During this period, he became a prominent member of the Ruhleben Musical Society and directed performances of &quot;The Mikado&quot; (with orchestra) and a pantomime version of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. MacMillan transcribed the music for the former from memory with the help of four other musicians, including Benjamin Dale. Among those attending these performances was James W. Gerard, the United States Ambassador to Germany. MacMillan was also a member of the Ruhleben Drama Society and acted in productions of &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. MacMillan gave lectures on each of the nine symphonies of Beethoven; at the end of each lecture, MacMillan and Dale would perform a four hand piano arrangement of the symphony under discussion. MacMillan was later interviewed about his experiences as an internee at Ruhleben, as part of a series of CBC interviews with Canadian First World War veterans.

==Career==

=== As a conductor ===

Upon return to Canada in 1919, MacMillan was appointed organist and choirmaster in Toronto at the Timothy Eaton Memorial Church. He was especially known there for his performances of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; and Brahms&#x27; &quot;Requiem&quot; His career as a conductor truly began when he conducted a performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;St. Matthew Passion&quot; in the Timothy Eaton Memorial Church in 1923. MacMillan conducted annual performances of this work for the next 30 years. Another annual tradition Macmillan initiated during his career includes the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir&#x27;s Christmas-time performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;.

Throughout his time with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, MacMillan accomplished many of the major achievements of his conducting career. His authority as a composer influenced some major changes within the orchestra. During the Depression, he changed the concert times from 5¬†pm to a more &quot;evening hour&quot;.

As many theatre musicians were out of work during the Depression era, MacMillan hired them to play in these evening concerts on a regular basis. As a result, MacMillan was able to select much more ambitious repertoire for this stronger performing force, as well as lengthening its season, and increased their number of concerts.

MacMillan tried to make concerts fun and entertaining. The Christmas Box Symphony Concerts were a great example of this. Not only did MacMillan conduct, but he dressed up as Santa Claus and had the audience participate by singing along. He also &quot;appeared in overalls with a monkey wrench for a baton to conduct Alexander Mosolov&#x27;s &quot;Iron Foundry&quot;&quot;.

The entry of Canada into WWII proved to be &quot;a difficult period&quot;, but it was during the post-war years that his conducting was regaled as being &quot;the most successful in the Toronto Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s history&quot;. MacMillan innovations in his repertoire changed yet again. He included Canadian music, as well as works by Hungarian and Russian composers B√©la Bart√≥k, and Dmitri Shostakovich.

During World War II, he gained fame as a guest conductor in the United States. He conducted many Hollywood Bowl concerts, and the National Broadcasting Company Symphony Orchestra in NYC. In Canada, he guest-conducted the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. By the end of the 1940s, he had conducted the Vancouver Symphony on 45 different occasions, and 25 different occasions in Montreal. MacMillan toured Australia as well for three months and conducted 30 concerts in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

Later in his career (1948‚Äì1953), MacMillan introduced Canada to entirely new prospects of recording and broadcasting. A good number of performances he conducted were recorded for Beaver Records; these were also broadcast nationally by CBC Radio. However, his silence over the Symphony Six issue prompted criticism.

=== As a composer ===

While a prisoner in Ruhleben, MacMillan wrote what is seen to be his most significant composition, titled &quot;String Quartet in C-minor&quot;. Influenced by the &quot;war-time style and themes&quot;, the first performance of this piece was heard on 8 February 1925, by the Hart House String Quartet, and was conducted by MacMillan himself. Although MacMillan&#x27;s composing abilities were much praised during this performance, he stated composition was not his main preoccupation; he preferred conducting to composing.

Nevertheless, not only did the musical language of the 19th century romantic period influence MacMillan, but he was interested in Folklore music also. In 1927, he travelled alongside Marius Barbeau to the Nass River region of British Columbia to &quot;hear, record and notate music of the Tsimshian People&quot;. As a result, he composed &quot;Three Songs of the West Coast&quot;, arranged for voice and piano.

MacMillan composed less during his commitment to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Still, he managed to compose Scottish and French songs for the ballad opera &quot;Prince Charming&quot;. In addition, he composed &quot;Te Deum Landamus in E Minor&quot; (1936) and &quot;Song of Deliverance&quot; (1944), both choral works.

His only work composed strictly for the organ was named &quot;Cort√®ge acad√©mique&quot;. In 1953, he was asked both to compose and to perform it at the University College in Toronto.

Apart from composing his own works, MacMillan made arrangements of works by composers such as Bach, Beethoven, Handel, and Tchaikovsky, all of whom he said had great influence on his style. Both Canadian and US orchestras have performed his orchestra arrangement of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Prelude and Fugue in C Minor&quot;.

=== As a performer ===

MacMillan became well known in Toronto music circles after he first started giving performances in his earlier career. Upon returning to Canada after the war, MacMillan relaunched his later career as a performer by giving 5 organ recitals commissioned by the Canadian Academy of Music from November 1919 to March 1920. In addition, he gave recitals at the Timothy Eaton Memorial Church after each Sunday service. MacMillan gave &quot;all Bach recitals&quot; which attracted members of the congregation and Toronto musicians.

CBC Radio in the 1920s helped to heighten MacMillan&#x27;s talent as a performer. Thus, he became acknowledged as far west as Vancouver. He was frequently asked to perform there, as well as in the United States, and at the 1935 Convention of the Royal College of Organists in Toronto.
In the early 1940s, MacMillan formed &quot;The Canadian Trio&quot;. Alongside musicians Zara Nelsova (cellist) and Kathleen Parlow (violinist), MacMillan often performed in Toronto and occasionally elsewhere. Amazingly, they once performed Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Triple Concerto in C Major&quot; with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra at Massey Hall. Furthermore, MacMillan founded &quot;The Canadian Duo&quot; with Kathleen Parlow; their performances were broadcast on CBC Radio as well.

MacMillan gave 100 concerts and recitals between the 1920s and 1950s. He eventually stopped performing due to his other responsibilities as a conductor, composer and an educator.

=== As an educator ===

Throughout his professional life, MacMillan put emphasis on music education, and &quot;contributed to the foundations of the development of music in Canada.&quot; In the year 1919, MacMillan was selected for a staff position at the Canadian Academy of Music, though he had little training in teaching. He taught theory, harmony, counterpoint, piano and organ. MacMillan was sent to lead examination tours at McGill University in Southern Ontario, and in various parts of the west coast on the Academy&#x27;s behalf.

Eventually, MacMillan was appointed the Dean of the Faculty of Music at the University of Toronto. He made many innovations during his tenure with its music department. He then established a conservatory choir in 1927, because he felt that the vocal students &quot;needed experience in choral singing&quot;. He also started the first opera classes at the conservatory in 1920, with performances of &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; and &quot;Hugh the Drover&quot;. He improved the library, made improvements to the college&#x27;s sight reading/ear tests, and prepared teaching materials which include &quot;The Modern Piano Student&quot; in 1931 and &quot;On the Preparation of Ear Tests&quot; in 1938.

MacMillan was interested as well in youth education. He worked in children&#x27;s concerts and secondary school concerts, which were presented by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. To enrich children&#x27;s musical experience, he introduced a series called &quot;Music for Young Folk&quot; in 1942. Focusing on all primary, junior and senior levels, the program ran for 45 minutes with soloists accompanied by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

Alongside composing, conducting and performing, MacMillan became recognized internationally as an adjudicator starting in 1924, when he adjudicated for the Ottawa Music Festival. In 1937, he was the first Canadian to adjudicate at the National Eisteddfod of Wales; and he adjudicated at various festivals in Jamaica and the United States.

===Honours and awards===

For his &quot;services to music in Canada&quot;, MacMillan was knighted in 1935 by King George V on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada, R. B. Bennett.

He became an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in 1938, and was made a recipient of the University of Alberta National Award in Music (1952). MacMillan received the Canada Council Medal twice (1964 and 1973) for &quot;outstanding achievements in the arts, humanities or social sciences&quot;. 
The University of Toronto&#x27;s Faculty of Music received a new facility in 1964, named the new theatre &quot;The MacMillan Theatre&quot;. It holds up to 815 people, and the orchestra pit is large enough to sit 60 musicians.

Honorary degrees conferred upon MacMillan, include: 
*&quot;1936, LL. D. University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC&quot;,
*&quot;1941, LL. D., Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston, Kingston, Ontario&quot;,
*&quot;1947, Mus. D., Laval University, Quebec City,&quot;
*&quot;1948, Litt. D, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario&quot;,
*&quot;1953, LL. D., University of Toronto.&quot; 

An Elementary School was named in his honour in Scarborough, Ontario in 1978. It is now part of the Toronto District School Board. 

MacMillan&#x27;s sons, Keith and Ross MacMillan, established the Sir Ernest MacMillan Memorial Foundation. The annual award is endowed with $7,500.

Sir Ernest MacMillan died in Toronto on May 6, 1973.
He is buried along with family at Toronto&#x27;s Mount Pleasant Cemetery.

=== Sir Ernest MacMillan (1893‚Äì1973): Portrait of a Canadian Musician ===

A special Exhibition, &quot;Sir Ernest MacMillan (1893‚Äì1973): Portrait of a Canadian Musician&quot; was mounted by the former National Library of Canada from 17 October 1994 to 12 March 1995. The Exhibition&#x27;s Curator, Maureen Nevins, wrote that MacMillan&#x27;s &quot;story should be known by all aspiring Canadian musicians and students of Canadian culture as a model of personal achievement and service to profession and country&quot;.

== The Sir Ernest MacMillan Memorial Foundation ==

The Sir Ernest MacMillan Memorial Foundation (Fondation comm√©morative Sir Ernest MacMillan) was founded in 1984 by Sir Ernest&#x27;s sons, Keith and Ross MacMillan, with a donation from the MacMillan family. Additional funds have been obtained through the generosity of other donors.

The principal goal of the Foundation is to assist young musicians in their advanced education at the graduate level and in so doing commemorate a great Canadian and his unique career.

In 1993, the Foundation played a major role in celebrating the centenary of Sir Ernest&#x27;s birth. The Foundation encouraged many commemorative activities throughout the country, and collaborated with the Music Division of the former National Library of Canada in presenting at Roy Thompson Hall part of the Library&#x27;s comprehensive MacMillan exhibit.

The Foundation accepts donations from individuals and organizations interested in furthering the musical arts in Canada through its awards program.

== Examples of MacMillan&#x27;s recordings and music ==

MacMillan conducted the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in two films produced by the National Film Board of Canada in 1945. In the first film, &quot;Toronto Symphony No. 1&quot; the TSO performed &quot;Jamaican Rhumba&quot;, &quot;√Ä St. Malo&quot; (one of MacMillan&#x27;s own compositions), and the overture to the opera &quot;Colas Breugnon&quot;. The film is 12 minutes in length. In the second film, &quot;Toronto Symphony No. 2&quot;, the TSO performed the third movement of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Sixth Symphony in B Minor&quot;. The film is 9 minutes in length. In 1942, MacMillan conducted the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (TSO) in a recording of the orchestral suite &quot;The Planets&quot;, by Gustav Holst, recorded on 78 RPM phonograph records, for RCA Victor. During the Second World War, MacMillan conducted the TSO in a recording of &quot;Pomp and Circumstance March No. 2&quot;, by Sir Edward Elgar, recorded on 78 RPM phonograph records, for RCA Victor. This was reportedly the first recording of this work made outside of the United Kingdom.
MacMillan conducted the TSO in a number of recordings with Canadian pianist Glenn Gould as soloist, playing works by various composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven. An RCA Victor recording by the TSO of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s fifth symphony was also issued by their budget label, RCA Camden.

==Sir Ernest MacMillan Home==

<text>El Hombre de las Narices, Home dels nassos (; &quot;Man of the noses&quot;) is a mythological character whose tradition is kept in Catalonia and other regions from Spain like Aragon, La Rioja, Navarre, √Ålava, Burgos, etc. The legend says that this man has as many noses as the year has days, and loses one every day and can only be seen on December 31. In this way, children of Catalonia are led to believe that there is a man with 365 noses, and they are asked to search him on last day of the year. Being the last day of the year, he has only one nose remaining, the rest have been already lost.

<text>Sergey Vladilenovich Kiriyenko (&quot;n√©&quot; &quot;Izraitel&quot;; ; born 26 July 1962) is a Russian politician who has served as First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Administration of Russia since 5 October 2016. He previously served as the 30th Prime Minister of Russia from 23 March to 23 August 1998 under President Boris Yeltsin, and was head of the Rosatom nuclear energy company between 2005 and 2016. Kiriyenko was the youngest Prime Minister of Russia, taking the position at age 35. Ideologically a technocrat, he has played a leading role in the governance of Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Early life==
Sergei Kiriyenko&#x27;s father, Vladilen Israitel, made his name as a doctor of philosophy. Sergei Kiriyenko, son of a Jewish father, was born in Sukhumi, the capital of the Abkhaz ASSR, and grew up in Sochi, in southern Russia. He adopted the Ukrainian surname of his mother. After graduation from high school, Kiriyenko enrolled in the shipbuilding faculty at the Nizhny Novgorod (Gorky) Water Transport Engineers Institute, where his divorced father taught.

== Prime Minister of Russia (1998) ==

Kiriyenko was appointed Prime Minister after the dismissal of Viktor Chernomyrdin&#x27;s Second Cabinet. The State Duma, dominated by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, twice refused to confirm his appointment but President Yeltsin nominated him a third time and Kiriyenko was confirmed.

Russians would popularly call the nomination of Kiriyenko &quot;Kinder Surprise&quot;, a reference to both the unexpectedness of such an appointment and his youth at the time of his appointment. His appointment was assisted by Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, who later became a leading critic of and activist against Vladimir Putin&#x27;s government. Along with Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais, Kiriyenko was known during the late 1990s as part of a group of &quot;young reformers&quot;, who sought wide-reaching overhauls to the economic system. This was in contrast with his immediate predecessor, the more moderate Viktor Chernomyrdin. Kiriyenko&#x27;s premiership was noted in hindsight for the appointment of Vladimir Putin as Director of the Federal Security Service, eventually leading to his accession to the presidency in 2000.

Kiriyenko&#x27;s cabinet defaulted the GKO-OFZ government bond coupons which led to devaluation of the Russian ruble and 1998 Russian financial crisis. Kiriyenko took responsibility for the crisis and resigned on 23 August.

=== Libel lawsuit ===
In 2004, Novaya Gazeta printed seven articles by columnist Georgy Rozhnov, which accused Kiriyenko of embezzling US$4.8 billion of IMF funds in 1998 when he was Prime Minister of Russia. The newspaper based the accusations on a letter allegedly written to Colin Powell and signed by US Congressmen Philip Crane, Mike Pence, Charlie Norwood, Dan Burton and Henry Bonilla and posted on the website of the American Defense Council. The newspaper went on to claim that Kiriyenko had used some of the embezzled funds to purchase real estate in the United States. The Moscow newspaper, &quot;The eXile&quot;, announced it had sent the letter as a prank, but later claimed that this had been a joke. In response, Kiriyenko sued Novaya Gazeta and Rozhnov for libel, and in passing judgement in favour of Kiriyenko the court ordered Novaya Gazeta to retract all publications relating to the accusations. The court noted &quot;Novaya gazeta‚Äôs content on the missing IMF funds include a great deal of unproven information&quot; and also went on to order the newspaper &quot;to publish only officially proven information linking Mr Kiriyenko with embezzlement.&quot;

== Union of Right Forces (1999) ==

Together with Boris Nemtsov and Irina Hakamada and along with others, Kiriyenko formed the Union of Right Forces. Kiriyenko led the party in the 1999 legislative election. The party finished fourth in the election, receiving 29 seats. Kiriyenko headed the parliamentary group of the party.

Since 2000 Kiriyenko has held the federal state civilian service rank of 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation.

== Rosatom (2005‚Äì2016) ==

Kiriyenko was appointed to head Rosatom, the Federal Atomic Energy Agency, on 30 November 2005 by Mikhail Fradkov&#x27;s Second Cabinet during the second term of President Vladimir Putin. He was also appointed by the same administration to chair the board of directors of the vertically integrated Atomenergoprom nuclear company in July 2007.

Kiriyenko said on 18 September 2006 while in Vienna, that the reactor in the Bushehr nuclear plant in Iran should be operational by September 2007 and the plant itself will be active in November 2007. He advocated President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s idea of creating an international system of uranium enrichment centers. A uranium enrichment center could be operational in Russia in 2007. Responding to a reporter&#x27;s question, Kiriyenko said that the Bushehr power plant would not affect nuclear non-proliferation and that there was nothing preventing Iran-Russia energy cooperation. The Government of Russia planned to deliver nuclear fuel to the plant in March 2007. After a delay of some three years, Kiriyenko said 21 August 2010&#x27;s arrival of nuclear fuel at Iran&#x27;s Bushehr I marks &quot;an event of crucial importance&quot; that proves that &quot;Russia always fulfills its international obligations.&quot; Spent nuclear fuel from the plant will be sent back to Russia.
Kiriyenko was replaced as General Director of Rosatom on 5 October 2016 by Alexey Likhachev, former Deputy Minister for Economic Development.

It came to light in July 2018 that for his work in Rosatom Kiriyenko was awarded by a confidential decree a Hero of Russia honorary title.

== First deputy chief of staff to President Putin ==
In October 2016 Kiriyenko was appointed First Deputy Chief of Staff in Putin&#x27;s administration. The position has significant status within the Russian government, with &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; referring to Kiriyenko as &quot;Putin&#x27;s right-hand man&quot; and a &quot;gray cardinal&quot; following the appointment.

Kiriyenko spoke publicly about the need to work with Russian youth and their fondness for debauched hip-hop, most notably in response to the crackdown in late 2018.

Vadim Prokhorov, one of his former colleagues, described him as &quot;a very flexible man [ideologically], who will never go against the wind.&quot;

=== Administrator of occupied Ukraine ===
Following the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kiriyenko&#x27;s portfolio as First Deputy Chief of Staff was expanded to cover administration of Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine. By June 2022 it was reported by &quot;Meduza&quot; and &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; that Kiriyenko had been entrusted with managing the occupied territories, a role that earned him the popular nickname &quot;Viceroy of the Donbas&quot;. Kiriyenko has continued to influence Russian domestic policy since the invasion, including allegedly preventing the cancellation of the 2022 Russian gubernatorial elections.

On 5 May 2022 it was reported that Kiriyenko visited the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol, taking part in the unveiling of a statue of an old woman holding the Soviet flag. Kiriyenko said that &quot;Babushka Anya is a symbol of the motherland for the entire&quot; Russian world.

On 6 June Kiriyenko visited occupied Kherson, and it was reported by the Ukrainian mayor of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, that the occupiers had conducted a meeting of more than 70 Russian sympathisers aimed at conducting a referendum on the region integrating the occupied areas into Russia. Kolykhaiev&#x27;s sources told him that the dates discussed were two: in September or at the end of 2022. A Russian election happens on 11 September and the Kherson vote would be scheduled to coincide that day. An elected official in Russia named Igor Kastyukevich had discussed this plan on 7 June, following the visit of Kiriyenko. By June, Russian occupational forces in Kherson had begun adjusting local curriculum to match Russia&#x27;s, and Russian SIM cards were on the market. Kolykhaiev also witnessed Russian forces distributing Russian passports to Kherson residents. A caf√© frequented by Russian soldiers was bombed on 7 June and at least four people were injured.

In late 2022, Russian opposition politician Nikita Yuferev accused Kiriyenko of violating Russia&#x27;s 2022 war censorship laws.

===Architect of Russian Disinformation===
In September 2024, the United States Justice Department asserted that Kiriyenko had created some 30 internet domains to spread Russian disinformation, including on Elon Musk‚Äôs X which was formerly known as Twitter. In October 2024, the Wall Street Journal disclosed that Musk had been in contact with Kiriyenko and Vladimir Putin which Dmitry Peskov affirmed.

=== Sanctions ===
While Kiriyenko was in office, he was sanctioned by both the United Kingdom and European Union (amongst the list of six individuals and one organization) on 15 October 2020 over the Alexei Navalny poisoning. Navalny, an opponent of Putin&#x27;s, was poisoned on 20 August 2020, while travelling on a flight inside Russia.

On 21 February 2022, after Putin officially recognized the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic and Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic as independent from Ukraine, other countries began to sanction Russian individuals and companies. On 22 February 2022, US President Joe Biden imposed sanctions on Kiriyenko, along with his son Vladimir for their connections to the Russian government.

==Family==
Kiriyenko&#x27;s son Vladimir was appointed CEO of VKontakte in December 2021, the influential Russian social network after the controversial takeover of VKontakte by companies affiliated with state-owned gas giant Gazprom, in what critics said was a sign of the Kremlin tightening its grip over the social media network. Critics have accused the company of sharing user&#x27;s data with Russia&#x27;s security services.
