<text>In the United Kingdom censorship has been applied to various forms of expression such as the media, cinema, entertainment venues, literature, theatre and criticism of the monarchy. While there is no general right to free speech in the UK, British citizens have a negative right to freedom of expression under the common law, and since 1998, freedom of expression is guaranteed according to Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as applied in British law through the Human Rights Act.

Current law allows for restrictions on threatening or abusive words or behaviour intending or likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress or cause a breach of the peace, sending another any article which is indecent or grossly offensive with an intent to cause distress or anxiety, incitement, incitement to racial hatred, incitement to religious hatred, incitement to terrorism including encouragement of terrorism and dissemination of terrorist publications, glorifying terrorism, collection or possession of a document or record containing information likely to be of use to a terrorist, treason, sedition, obscenity, indecency including corruption of public morals and outraging public decency, defamation, prior restraint, restrictions on court reporting (including names of victims and evidence and prejudicing or interfering with court proceedings, prohibition of post-trial interviews with jurors), time, manner, and place restrictions, harassment, privileged communications, trade secrets, classified material, copyright, patents, military conduct, and limitations on commercial speech such as advertising.

As of 2025, the United Kingdom is ranked 23rd on the Press Freedom Index.

==Ministry of Information==
The Ministry of Information was created during the First World War and then reformed for the Second World War for propaganda purposes. In the Second World War it was located at the Senate House of the University of London. During the Second World War it was infamous for having a staff of 999.

The Ministry was responsible for keeping much information out of the public domain during the war years, as it was thought that this would have been harmful to the national sentiment. It also censored many press reports that were not deemed to be sufficiently patriotic, or that listed military operations to a level of detail that could be used by the enemy.

The Ministry took over the General Post Office Film Unit, renaming it the Crown Film Unit. It produced documentaries such as &quot;Target for Tonight&quot; (1941), &quot;Western Approaches&quot; (1944) and &quot;London Can Take It!&quot; (1940). It also created a feature-length fictional film; &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941). Following this it solely created documentaries, although it also laid down propaganda guidelines for commercial films.

The Ministry was disbanded following the end of the Second World War. 

==Laws on obscenity and sexual content==
Obscenity law in England and Wales is currently governed by the various Obscene Publications Acts, and Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 but obscenity laws go back much further into the English common law.

The conviction in 1727 of Edmund Curll for the publication of &quot;Venus in the Cloister or The Nun in her Smock&quot; under the common law offence of disturbing the King&#x27;s peace was the first conviction for obscenity in Great Britain, and set a legal precedent for other convictions.

A defence against the charge of obscenity on the grounds of literary merit was introduced in the Obscene Publications Act 1959. The OPA was tested in the high-profile obscenity trial brought against Penguin Books for publishing &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; (by D. H. Lawrence) in 1960. The book was found to have merit, and Penguin Books was found not guilty – a ruling which granted far more freedom to publish explicit material. This trial did not establish the &#x27;merit&#x27; defence as an automatic right; several controversial books and publications were the subject of British court cases throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s. &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;, a 1964 novel by American author Hubert Selby, Jr. was subject of a private prosecution in 1966.

The distinction between legal erotic literature and illegal pornography was traditionally made in the English-speaking courts on the basis of perceived literary merit. No prosecutions of purely textual pornography took place following the &quot;Inside Linda Lovelace&quot; trial of 1976 until October 2008 when a man was charged (but later cleared) under the Obscene Publications Act for allegedly posting fictional written material to the Internet describing kidnap, rape and murder of pop group Girls Aloud (the R v Walker trial). In late August 2005, the government announced that it planned to criminalise possession of extreme pornographic material, rather than just publication, and the law came into force as Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008.

Under a law introduced in May 2015, not only creation but also possession of manuals giving advice how to groom or abuse children is also outlawed.

Almost all adult stores in the UK are forbidden from having their goods in open display under the Indecent Displays Act 1981, which means the shop fronts are often boarded up or covered in posters. A warning sign must be clearly shown at the entrance to the store, and no items can be visible from the street. No customer can be under eighteen years old. The Video Recordings Act 1984 introduced the R18-rated classification for videos that are only available in licensed sex shops, but hardcore pornographic magazines are available in newsagents in some places. The Ann Summers chain of lingerie and sex shops won the right to advertise for workers in job centres, which was originally banned under restrictions on what advertising could be carried out by the sex industry.

===Mull of Kintyre test===

According to an urban legend, the Mull of Kintyre test or Mull of Kintyre rule was an unofficial guideline used by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) to decide whether an image of a penis could be shown. According to the myth, the BBFC would not permit the general release of a film or video if it depicted a penis erect to the point that the angle it made from the vertical was higher than that of the peninsula of Kintyre in Argyll and Bute on maps of Scotland. This test has often been called &quot;the angle of the dangle&quot;.

The Mull of Kintyre test was said to have first been used for the release of the controversial erotic historical drama film &quot;Caligula&quot; in 1979.

== Stage licensing ==

Censorship of stage plays was exercised by the Master of the Revels in England by about 1600 until the English Civil War in 1642.

In 1737, partly as a result of political attacks by Henry Fielding against Robert Walpole, Parliament enacted a law that established &quot;the Examiner of the Stage&quot; (an official in the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s office) to censor plays on the basis of both politics and morals (i.e. sexual impropriety, blasphemy, and foul language). Plays had to be licensed by the Lord Chamberlain. In 1737, through the influence of the Duke of Grafton, the Shakespearian commentator Edward Capell was appointed with an annual salary of £200 as deputy-examiner of plays. This censorship by licensing requirement was finally abolished by the Theatres Act 1968.

According to Rufus Osgood Mason (who gives an example of a written license from 1814):

Charles Kemble, later in life, received the appointment of &quot;Examiner of Plays&quot;. The duties consisted in reading the plays which had been accepted by the managers of the different theatres, to see that they contained nothing objectionable either on the score of politics or morals. Those that were approved were reported to the Lord Chamberlain who issued the license.

==Libel law==
England and Wales have relatively strict libel laws (&quot;defamation&quot; in Scotland) in that they are often considered pro plaintiff with the defendant asked to prove that they did not commit libel. Compensation awards for libel are also unlimited, in contrast to those for personal injury. Further controversy surrounds the libel laws with regard to costs. Whilst costs can be awarded the ability both to bring and to defend libel cases is often considered to be restricted to the wealthy. Conversely it is possible to initiate a &quot;no win – no fee&quot; case against a wealthy individual or organisation if the individual bringing the case has insignificant assets as even if the case is lost the wealthy individual or organisation are unable to recover their costs. Typically in such cases an out of court settlement is forced upon the wealthy individual or organisation.

A relevant example is the case of Simon Singh&#x27;s lawsuit, where author and journalist Simon Singh was sued by the British Chiropractic Association for criticism of chiropractic therapy which rested on a summary of recent scientific research. Singh was able to pursue a legal defence because of his earnings from four best-sellers.

In another case the UK based academic publisher Equinox was forced to remove a peer reviewed academic article from its publication International Journal of Speech, Language and the Law. The article &quot;charlatanry in forensic speech science&quot; was a metastudy of lie detector research and came to the conclusion that lie detectors don&#x27;t work. The Israeli manufacturer of lie detectors Nemesysco forced the publisher to remove the already published article from the online databases and the journal was also forced to publish an apology in a later issue.

On 15 March 2011, a &quot;Draft Defamation Bill&quot; (CP3/11) was published by the Ministry of Justice with an accompanying &quot;consultation paper containing provisions for reforming the law to strike the right balance between protection of freedom of speech and protection of reputation&quot;. (Close date: 10 June 2011) The Defamation Act 2013 reformed English defamation law on issues of the right to freedom of expression and the protection of reputation. It also comprised a response to perceptions that the law as it stood was giving rise to libel tourism and other inappropriate claims.

==Blasphemy law==

Blasphemy against Christianity was long an important part of British censorship, with the unwritten common law containing an offence of blasphemous libel. Prosecutions were rare, however, the last one being the 1977 &quot;Gay News&quot; legal case &quot;Whitehouse v. Lemon&quot;. Later developments around the turn of the 21st century put the continued viability of blasphemy prosecutions in doubt. The offence was definitively abolished on 8 May 2008.

Critics claimed the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 could hinder freedom of speech. Leaders of major religions as well as non-religious groups such as the National Secular Society and English PEN spoke out in order to campaign against the Bill. Comedians and satirists also fear prosecution for their work. However, a late amendment to the Act as a result of these campaigns reads: &quot;Nothing in this Part shall be read or given effect in a way which prohibits or restricts discussion, criticism or expressions of antipathy, dislike, ridicule, insult or abuse of particular religions or the beliefs or practices of their adherents, or of any other belief system or the beliefs or practices of its adherents, or proselytising or urging adherents of a different religion or belief system to cease practising their religion or belief system.&quot;

==National security==
There are several Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament for the protection of official information, mainly related to national security. The latest revision is the Official Secrets Act 1989 (1989 chapter 6), which removed the &quot;public interest defence&quot; by repealing section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911. In 2004, a memo containing details of a possible US bombing of broadcaster Al Jazeera was leaked to the press. Attorney General Peter Goldsmith warned newspapers that they could be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act if they publish the contents of the memo, saying &quot;You are reminded that to publish the contents of a document which is known to have been unlawfully disclosed by a crown servant is in itself a breach of section 5 of the Official Secrets Act 1989&quot;.

The Terrorism Act 2000 makes it an offence to collect or possess, and as amended in 2019 also to access, information likely to be of use to a terrorist. Bilal Zaheer Ahmad, 23, from Wolverhampton, is believed to be the first person convicted of collecting information likely to be of use to a terrorist, including the al-Qaeda publication &quot;Inspire&quot;. Since then, Ben Raymond of the group National Action has also been convicted, among other charges, of possession of terrorist information, including Anders Breivik&#x27;s manifesto and a guide to homemade detonators.

The Terrorism Act 2006 makes it an offence to &quot;glorify&quot; terrorism. There are concerns that this could limit free speech.

DSMA-Notices (Defence and Security Media Advisory Notice, formerly a DA-Notice) are official but voluntary requests to news editors not to publish items on specified subjects, for reasons of national security.

==Prior restraint==
Beyond obscenity law, there have been a number of organisations whose main function was to approve material prior to distribution.

Plays and theatres had long been licensed by the Crown prior to 1737. Licensure of a playhouse, however, only gave a general patent. The crown had no ability to censor before plays were performed. Under the provisions of the Theatrical Licensing Act 1737 as extended by the Theatres Act 1843, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office was able to censor plays. This role continued until the Theatres Act 1968 abolished the practice following several causes célèbres, and a long campaign by the theatre critic Kenneth Tynan among others.

The British Board of Film Classification is the &quot;de facto&quot; film censor for films in the United Kingdom; since films not rated by the BBFC cannot be shown in most cinemas, or distributed as videos or DVDs, lack of BBFC approval generally makes productions of such films uneconomic.
*In the case of films shown in cinemas, local authorities have the final legal say about who can watch a particular film. Almost always local authorities accept the Board&#x27;s recommendation for a certificate for a film.
*Under the Video Recording Act 1984, almost all video recordings must be classified by an authority chosen by the Home Secretary. This classification is then legally binding. Since the introduction of the Act, the BBFC has been the chosen authority. Certain works such as those that are related to sport, religion or which are designed to educate can be exempt from classification by the BBFC under the act.

Up until 2007, the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre pre-approved most British television advertising (under Ofcom rules, other broadcasters can also approve their own advertising content, but most rely on the BACC). The Advertising Standards Authority is the regulatory advertising body, but can only prevent the republication of advertisements after upholding complaints from the general public.

The advent of the Internet access has made the act of censorship more difficult, and there has been a relaxation of censorship in recognition of this. BBFC guidelines have been relaxed further to allow the limited distribution of hardcore pornography under an R18 certificate, partially because of this, and partially because of a recognition that public attitudes have changed. Further confirmation of this change in attitude was provided by the French film &quot;Baise-moi&quot;, which was given an 18 certificate despite showing scenes of unsimulated sexual activity.

Ofcom is now the regulatory body for UK television, radio, and telecommunications services since the abolition of the Independent Television Commission. Ofcom exerts its powers under the Communications Act 2003. The government&#x27;s new requirements for Ofcom only require it to ensure adherence to &quot;generally accepted standards&quot; and prevention of harm, removing the former requirement to adhere to standards of &quot;taste and decency&quot;.

&quot;Worldwide Press Freedom Index&quot;, published by Reporters Without Borders, gave the United Kingdom a score of 5.17, making it 24th.

==Self-regulation of publication==
A number of industries carry out what is known as self-regulation. Self-regulation seeks to keep content within the bounds of what is publicly acceptable, thus preventing government intervention to bring about official regulation. Some of the areas they are concerned about include obscenity, slander and libel. There is no clear line between self-regulation in matters of expression and self-censorship.

In 2019, intelligence researcher James Flynn reported an example of self-regulation resulting in the cancelled publication of a book about censorship itself. Flynn&#x27;s book, &quot;In Defence of Free Speech&quot; was originally accepted by Emerald Insight but later rejected over concerns that there was a &quot;significant possibility of legal action&quot; under the UK&#x27;s hate speech and libel laws. Douglas Murray criticised this decision and compared it to the 2006 controversy that prevented &quot;Alms for Jihad&quot; from being published in the United Kingdom.

Industry self-regulatory bodies include the Advertising Standards Authority. In the wake of the Leveson Inquiry the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which had been the main industry regulator of the press in the United Kingdom since 1990, was wound up and most national newspapers now belong to the Independent Press Standards Organisation, established in 2014, refusing to sign up to IMPRESS, the Leveson-compliant alternative.

== Parliamentary footage ==
Proceedings of the House of Lords, House of Commons, and various Parliamentary Committees are broadcast on BBC Parliament and Parliament&#x27;s Web site. The Rules of Coverage released by the House of Commons Broadcasting Committee place severe limitations on the use of this footage, including a prohibition of its use in the context of political satire. For this reason, rebroadcasts of foreign comedy shows containing Parliamentary footage are restricted from broadcast in the UK, or the footage removed or replaced, often to comic effect.

==Gag orders==
==Censorship by medium==

=== Art ===
Art was often used as propaganda in Europe, often to point out political scandals but also to spread patriotism in times of need. More specifically, caricature was often used to satirise these events and people and bring attention to the artists&#x27; perspectives. Although censorship laws changed based on the stability of the monarchy and their opinions of the citizens, Britain was one of the European countries with the least amount of censorship in this area. During the French Revolution, Britain was in fact the only country where such propaganda was free and legal. The most famous British caricaturists at the time included Isaac Cruikshank, James Gillray, and Thomas Rowlandson. Although all three caricaturists had different perspectives and opinions, they were the frontrunners in the push towards patriotism of the United Kingdom when the UK faced attack from Napoleon.

===Internet===
Although freedom of expression and protection of privacy over the Internet is guaranteed by UK law, since about 2010 there has been an increasing shift towards authoritarian measures such as increased surveillance (The United Kingdom has more police surveillance cameras than anywhere else outside of China) and police action. Combating terrorism and preventing child abuse have been widely used by state agencies and private commercial actors (e.g. Internet service providers) to justify the implementation of interception and direct filtering measures. Nevertheless, in 2010 the OpenNet Initiative (ONI) found no evidence of technical filtering in the political, social, conflict/security, or Internet tools areas. The UK openly blocks child pornography websites, for which ONI does not test.

98.6% of UK internet traffic consume a service called the child abuse image content list which uses data provided by the Internet Watch Foundation to identify pages judged to contain indecent photographs of children. When such a page is found, the system creates a &quot;URL not found page&quot; error rather than deliver the actual page or a warning page.

In July and again in October 2011, the UK High Court ruled that BT Retail must block access to a website (newzbin.com) which &quot;provides links to pirated movies&quot;. In September 2011, in response to the court ruling and with encouragement from government, leading UK ISPs are reported to have privately agreed in principle to quickly restrict access to websites when presented with court orders. In May 2012 the High Court ordered UK ISPs to block The Pirate Bay to prevent further copyright infringing movie and music downloads facilitated by the website. Soon after, the High Court ordered UK ISPs to block other websites linking to, or endorsing online &quot;piracy&quot;, such as KickAss Torrents (kat.ph).

Since the end of 2013 a rolling program has been in place to ensure that most households in the UK have pornography and other material (such as suicide, alcohol and violence-related content) filtered from the Internet by default unless a household chooses to receive it. This follows an announcement by the Prime Minister David Cameron on 22 July 2013.

In addition to Internet filtering, the UK also prosecutes those who are alleged to be violating hate speech laws online. In particular, the Communications Act 2003 outlaws the act of sending &quot;by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character&quot;. In 2017, Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecution, announced the allocation of additional resources for enforcing it and the intent to treat online speech as equivalent to a conversation in person. In 2018, the Sentencing Council began deliberating on whether to increase the maximum sentence for suspects with many social media followers. Digital secretary Margot James also outlined a plan to increase government regulation of social networks with possible penalties including 4% of the firm&#x27;s global turnover. Culture secretary Matt Hancock elaborated on this plan and likened it to the controversial German law NetzDG. After the refusal by ten technology companies to send representatives to a meeting he held, he stated that this gave him &quot;a big impetus to drive these proposals to legislate through&quot;. As of 2017, it was estimated that nine people per day were being arrested for online speech within the UK, with five leading to convictions. In February 2021 a Scottish man from Lanark was arrested and subsequently convicted for an &quot;offensive tweet&quot; insulting (deceased) World War 2 veteran Thomas Moore, which read: “The only good Brit soldier is a deed one, burn auld fella buuuuurn” . In September 2024, billionaire and SpaceX owner Elon Musk wrote:&quot;I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts,&quot; after apparently being &quot;shunned&quot; from a UK summit that year. In November 2024, former prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote on X, in regards to a journalist being visited by police for a tweet:&quot; This is appalling. How can Starmer’s Britain lecture other countries about free speech when an innocent journalist gets a knock on the door - for a tweet? Our police have their hands full of burglaries and violent crime. They are being forced to behave like a woke Securitate - and it has to stop.&quot; In 2024, a man from Carlisle, England was jailed for posting three images on Facebook which included men of Asian appearance, one of which showed the men wielding knives, with the captions, “Coming to a town near you.&quot; and “When it’s on your turf, then what?”. In another incident reported on in 2024 a black woman from London was convicted of using the n-word on twitter in 2023, writing: “I’m so p***** off let me get my hands on that f**** n***a,”. 

Some regulation of the Internet is coordinated through an online police presence. The Metropolitan Police Service&#x27;s Twitter account for example, which has been online since 2009, has been applauded for its responsiveness. It has also been condemned for what critics see as police intimidation. In 2016, former IT consultant Paul Perrin expressed resentment over the level of attention given to LGBT issues in the news. When an officer from an LGBT-specific account of the MPS joined the discussion, he or she allegedly revealed knowledge of Perrin&#x27;s family members.

====Age verification====

Since March 2019, the Digital Economy Act 2017 has given the government power to require certain websites to implement an age verification scheme, under rules defined in the Online Pornography (Commercial Basis) Regulations 2019. , reports state that there is no firm date for the implementation of this policy, which has been beset by many technical problems. A BBC report described implementation of the scheme as being &quot;in a holding pattern&quot;.

==== Think before you post ====
On August 8, 2024, after 2024 United Kingdom riots the UK government official account on x.com (Twitter) quoted &quot;Think before you post&quot; the Crown Prosecution Service announcement of the criminalization of social media contents that are so called &quot;inciting criminal behaviour&quot;.

===Literature===
See also under &quot;Laws on obscenity and sexual content&quot; above.

In 1873, controversy over the depiction of William Ewart Gladstone, Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke, and Acton Smee Ayrton in W. S. Gilbert and Gilbert Arthur à Beckett&#x27;s &quot;The Happy Land&quot; led to the play&#x27;s licence being revoked by the Lord Chamberlain. A censored version of the play was eventually allowed to be performed, but uncensored scripts, with the censored portions printed in all capital letters, were printed by the theatre&#x27;s manager. The play became a smash hit.

The novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce was banned in the United Kingdom in 1922 when it was declared obscene.

Novelist George Orwell wrote several articles on censorship including an item titled &quot;The Freedom of the Press&quot; in 1943. It appears that this was a preface for his book &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, but it is unclear if it had been deliberately suppressed or if Orwell himself chose not to publish it.

Any fair-minded person with journalistic experience will admit that during this war official censorship has not been particularly irksome. We have not been subjected to the kind of totalitarian &#x27;co-ordination&#x27; that it might have been reasonable to expect. The press has some justified grievances, but on the whole the Government has behaved well and has been surprisingly tolerant of minority opinions. The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary. – George Orwell

Orwell went on to suggest that because both the UK and the Soviet Union were members of the Allied powers at the time, this self-censorship was preventing valid criticism of the Communist regime. Orwell worked for the Ministry of Information during the war and used it as his inspiration for the Ministry of Truth in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

===Radio===
Censorship of music on the airwaves was in effect the power of the BBC. (A full list of songs banned on the BBC can be seen here: List of songs banned by the BBC.) Some songs were banned for containing sexually explicit lyrics, or promoting the use of drugs. Some songs were banned for political reasons such as Paul McCartney and Wings song &quot;Give Ireland Back to the Irish&quot; in the 1970s, or in the 1980s Christy Moore&#x27;s &quot;Back Home in Derry&quot; since it was written by Bobby Sands.

In 1949, the &quot;BBC Variety Programmes Policy Guide For Writers and Producers&quot; (commonly known as &quot;the Green Book&quot;) was issued by the BBC to its producers and writers of comedy. Among things absolutely banned were jokes about lavatories, effeminacy in men, immorality of any kind, suggestive references to honeymoon couples, chambermaids, fig leaves, ladies&#x27; underwear (e.g. &quot;winter draws on&quot;), prostitution, and the vulgar use of words such as &quot;basket&quot;. The guidelines also stipulated that &quot;such words as &quot;God, Good God, My God, Blast, Hell, Damn, Bloody, Gorblimey, Ruddy&quot;, etc etc should be deleted from scripts and innocuous expressions substituted.&quot;

In April 2013, after the death of Margaret Thatcher, the song &quot;Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead&quot; from the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, rose to number two in the BBC Radio 1 UK singles chart as many people bought the song to celebrate the former PM&#x27;s death. The BBC refused to air the full song however, with only a small clip being played on the hit chart show.

===Television===
During The Troubles in Northern Ireland the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 regularly stopped or postponed the broadcast of documentaries relating to Ireland. A &quot;Real Lives&quot; documentary for the BBC, &quot;At the Edge of the Union&quot;, was temporarily blocked in August 1985 by direct government intervention from the then Home Secretary Leon Brittan which led to a one-day strike by the National Union of Journalists to defend the independence of the BBC.

From November 1988 to September 1994, the voices of Irish republicans and Loyalist paramilitaries were barred by the British government from British television and radio. This necessitated the use by broadcasters of an actor &#x27;revoicing&#x27; the words which had been spoken by interviewees or at public meetings by the affected groups. The case of &quot;After Dark&quot; – &quot;the most uncensorable programme in the history of British television&quot; – is also relevant, specifically the unmade edition of the programme in 1988 with Gerry Adams. The ban was lifted a fortnight after the first Provisional Irish Republican Army ceasefire, on 16 September 1994. The ban could not be enforced for the duration of election campaigns.

An international academic conference on censorship noted other &quot;&quot;After Dark&quot; case histories which bear on issues of censorship include the intelligence services, drugs, freemasonry, sex ... and Oliver Reed.&quot;

The 1986 documentary &quot;&quot;, that investigated the involvement of British forces in the Dekemvriana events and the Greek Civil War, was banned from being reshown.

===Video games===
The introduction of controversial video games featuring photo-realistic images, such as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and &quot;Night Trap&quot;, led to calls from the tabloid press for games to fall under the Video Recordings Act. The UK games publisher trade body ELSPA responded by introducing a voluntary age rating system in 1994. The ELSPA ratings were succeeded by PEGI in 2003.

Nevertheless, although games are generally exempt from the Video Recordings Act, those depicting sexual content, or gross violence towards people or animals, must still be submitted to the BBFC for consideration. BBFC ratings are legally binding, and British law imposes stiff penalties on retailers who sell to under-aged customers. However, the Act was discovered in August 2009 to be unenforceable. The rating system is to be reviewed as part of the Digital Britain project.

&quot;Carmageddon&quot;, in which the gameplay involved mowing down innocent pedestrians, was the first game to be refused classification in 1997, effectively banning it from sale. The game&#x27;s publisher, SCI, had a modified version created in which the pedestrians in question were replaced by green-blooded zombies, which completed a successful appeal against the BBFC to overturn their original decision. The uncensored, unmodified version of &quot;Carmageddon&quot; was later released under an 18-certificate.

In 2002 the IO Interactive game &quot;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin&quot; was withdrawn by a number of retailers due to religious sensitivities. The area in question involved a Sikh sect that were depicted as terrorists involved in arms smuggling and assassination. It also involved a section that many Sikhs believed to closely resemble the 1984 massacre at the Amritsar temple.

In 2004, the parents of a murdered 14-year-old boy blamed &quot;Manhunt&quot; as having been &quot;connected&quot; to the murder. It was later found not to be, as the game was found in the victim&#x27;s home, rather than the killer&#x27;s. Leicestershire police &quot;did not uncover any connections to the computer game&quot;. The accusations prompted some retailers to remove the game from their shelves. Nevertheless, following this incident the sales of the game rose due to the free publicity from newspaper headlines.
The sequel, &quot;Manhunt 2&quot;, released in 2007, was banned from being sold in the UK by the BBFC. On appeal to the Video Appeals Committee this ruling was overturned however the BBFC launched a successful judicial review into the VAC&#x27;s decision, forcing the VAC to reconsider its judgment. On 14 March 2008, the VAC again recommended that the game be released, a position to which the BBFC agreed. The game is now available.

==Specific case studies==
*In 1795, the administration of William Pitt (the Younger) enacted the Treason Act and Seditious Meetings Act to suppress the burgeoning Radical movement calling for Parliamentary reform. Fearing a &quot;Jacobin uprising&quot; of the kind that had just been seen in France, the government censured reform societies such as the London Corresponding Society, despite no evidence suggesting that these organisations engaged in any illegal activities.
* In 1963, in the &quot;Profumo affair&quot;, the government instituted criminal proceedings against Stephen Ward to stifle press comment under the sub judice rule concerning the sexual relationship between the War Minister John Profumo and Christine Keeler, who was having a sexual relationship with Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet Naval Attache and alleged spy.
* In 1972, Lord Longford and Raymond Blackburn decided to pursue a matter of pornography classification for the film &quot;Language of Love&quot; into the Court of Appeal of Lord Denning, MR, and lost the writ of mandamus against the Police Commissioner, who had refused to intrude upon the BBFC remit.
* In 1977, the Sex Pistols&#x27; single God Save the Queen was &quot;the subject of a blanket ban on BBC&quot;.
*In 1985, the British government attempted to ban the book &quot;Spycatcher&quot; by MI5 officer Peter Wright because of the sensitive material it contained. Several British newspapers attempted to report on its principal allegations, but were served with gag orders. They persisted and were tried for contempt of court, charges that were later dropped.
*In 1994, 6 members of LGBT rights group OutRage! protested against 6,000 members of Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir at Wembley Arena. The counter-protestors were arrested for displaying placards in support of gays, Jews and women.
*In 1995, Prince Charles obtained a court injunction that prevented his former housekeeper Wendy Berry from publishing her tell-all book about his marital troubles. After publishing her book &quot;The Housekeepers Diary&quot; in the United States, Berry left the UK to avoid contempt-of-court charges.
*In 1999, 78-year old veteran George Staunton from Liverpool displayed advertisements for the UK Independence Party bearing the slogans &quot;Free speech for England&quot; and &quot;Remember 1939-1945&quot;. He was arrested and charged with racially aggravated criminal damages but the charges were later dropped.
*In July 2001, 25-year old Daryl Barke, whose bakery had been in the family for 22 years was forced to remove a sign advertising that the store&#x27;s bread was &quot;none of that French rubbish&quot;. The police stated that they were investigating the sign under the Race Relations Act 1976 in response to an anonymous complaint. Barke protested that Essex police officers who shop at the bakery and a French Algerian greengrocer working on the same block all enjoyed the joke.
*In October 2001, Harry Hammond held up a sign reading &quot;Jesus Gives Peace, Jesus is Alive, Stop Immorality, Stop Homosexuality, Stop Lesbianism, Jesus is Lord&quot;. Nearby demonstrators attempted to physically remove the sign. None of them were charged but Hammond was convicted of breaching section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 and fined £300 with £395 in costs. Attempts to appeal were unsuccessful as Hammond died shortly after the trial.
*In December 2004, controversy surrounding the play &quot;Behzti&quot; sparked violent protests leading to the play&#x27;s cancellation. A controversial scene set in a Sikh temple included rape, physical abuse, and murder. Some members of the Sikh community found the play deeply offensive to their faith.
*In 2006, 21-year old Sam Brown from Belfast was arrested for walking up to police while inebriated and asking &quot;Excuse me, do you realise your horse is gay?&quot; The police argued that these were homophobic remarks and tried to charge him under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. The charges were later dropped.
*British National Party leader Nick Griffin and activist Mark Collett were found unanimously not guilty of charges of inciting racial hatred in November 2006. The pair had been secretly recorded making statements about Islam and immigration in a 2004 documentary.
*In 2007, 19-year old Kyle Little from Newcastle was fined a total of £200 for barking at a Labrador dog and saying &quot;woof&quot; near police. He had his conviction overturned later that year with the judge remarking that &quot;the law is not an ass&quot;.
*On 15 January 2008 it was announced that the trial of Wang Yam, accused of murdering Allan Chappelow, would be held &quot;in camera&quot; on the grounds of the administration of justice and national security. This was the first UK murder trial held behind closed doors. The UK press were prohibited from speculating as to the reasons for this order.
*In 2008, the poem Education for Leisure was removed from the &quot;AQA Anthology&quot;, after complaints were received. The poem explores the mind of a person who is planning to commit a murder.
*Starting in 2008 the press were barred from printing the names of concerned parties in the murder of Baby Peter, a 17-month-old boy. Websites which published the names of the defendants and the boy came under police investigation for conducting an &quot;internet hate campaign&quot;. On 10 August 2009 the ban was lifted.
*The Twitter joke trial, which took place between 2009 and 2012, centered on a complaint by Paul Chambers about Robin Hood Airport being closed. It read &quot;You&#x27;ve got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise I&#x27;m blowing the airport sky high!!&quot; Chambers was convicted of breaching the Communications Act 2003 before getting the verdict overturned on his third appeal. Public figures, including Nick Cohen, Graham Linehan and Stephen Fry supported Chambers. The final ruling read &quot;a message which does not create fear or apprehension in those to whom it is communicated, or who may reasonably be expected to see it, falls outside this provision&quot;.
*In March 2010, American Baptist preacher Shawn Holes was convicted of a breach of peace for remarks made in Glasgow. He opined &quot;homosexuals are deserving of the wrath of God, and so are all other sinners, and they are going to a place called hell&quot; in response to a question before the police received a complaint. The Catholic Church in Scotland and the Muslim Council of Scotland opposed the prosecution.
*In April 2010, Baptist preacher Dale McAlpine was questioned by a police community support officer for the LGBT population and later arrested by another officer. The arrest concerned his pronouncement that homosexuality was sinful, which McAlpine says was not in his sermon but part of a conversation he had with a listener. After holding him in a cell for seven hours, Cumbria police released McAlpine and dropped the charges stating that they respected freedom of expression.
*In 2011, a series of privacy injunctions, so called &#x27;super injunctions&#x27;, gained widespread attention. The press was barred from publishing details about various prominent individuals. One case involving journalist and broadcaster Andrew Marr was dropped; another involving footballer Ryan Giggs became untenable, although many such injunctions remain in force.
*In July 2011, highlights from &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, an American TV program, were not shown on Channel 4&#x27;s More4 channel because showing coverage of the House of Commons in a comedic or satirical context in Britain is prohibited by parliamentary rules. American viewers were able to see the material.
*In September 2011, public preacher John Craven was approached by two male teenagers and asked for his views on homosexuality. He allegedly declined to give his own views but stated that homosexual acts were considered sinful in The Bible. According to reports, the boys subsequently kissed in front of Craven and reported him to a nearby officer. Craven was detained for at least fifteen hours. He stated that he was held &quot;without food or water&quot; and that his access to medication for rheumatoid arthritis was interrupted. Three years later, he was awarded £13,000 in compensation under the Human Rights Act 1998.
*In October 2011, 28-year old Stephen Birrell was sentenced to eight months in jail for engaging in Scottish sectarianism. He made posts to a Facebook page called &quot;Neil Lennon should be banned&quot; which insulted Catholics and the Pope. Sheriff Bill Totten stated &quot;the right-thinking people of Glasgow and Scotland will not allow any behaviour of this nature&quot;.
*In January 2012, British communications regulator Ofcom revoked Press TV&#x27;s licence to broadcast in the UK; it remains available via the internet. Ofcom found that the News channel&#x27;s editorial control was based in Tehran, which breaches the Communications Act 2003. This had come to their attention while investigating a Press TV interview with journalist Maziar Bahari, given under duress, in which he &#x27;confessed&#x27; that western journalists working in Iran were spies. A connection has been made by opponents of the decision with WikiLeaks cables suggesting the US and UK governments wanted to end Press TV&#x27;s broadcasting licence in response to the Iranian government&#x27;s jamming of the BBC Persian Service and the Voice of America.
* In March 2012, 20-year old Azhar Ahmed was arrested for writing &quot;all soldiers should die and go to hell&quot; on Facebook. The post was reported by the mother of a soldier who had been killed by an IED in Afghanistan two days earlier. District Judge Jane Goodwin called it &quot;beyond the pale of what&#x27;s tolerable in our society&quot; and sentenced Ahmed to £300 and 240 hours of community service. Several attendees protested when she delivered the ruling and Paul Chambers, having been acquitted in the Twitter joke trial said &quot;Glad all that fighting wasn&#x27;t for nothing.&quot;
* In May 2012, 21-year old Liam Stacey spent 56 days in jail for tweeting &quot;LOL, Fuck Muamba. He&#x27;s dead.&quot; The line referred to English footballer Fabrice Muamba after a cardiac arrest which led to his retirement. After a large influx of criticism from other Twitter users, Stacey argued back with racial insults including &quot;go pick some cotton&quot;. He was charged under the Public Order Act 1986 and apologised for the comments.
* During the 2012 Olympics, diver Tom Daley retweeted a message that said &quot;You let your dad down i hope you know that&quot;, insulting him for finishing fourth. Its 17-year old author was arrested on suspicion of &quot;malicious communication&quot; and given a harassment warning.
* In August 2012, following publication of naked photographs of Prince Harry, lawyers for his father, Prince Charles, issued threats of legal action. The photographs were not used by British newspapers or television stations after St James&#x27;s Palace warned that the royal family regarded the pictures as a gross invasion of the prince&#x27;s privacy.
* In September 2012, Britain&#x27;s royal household began legal proceedings against a French magazine, &quot;Closer&quot;, that published paparazzi photographs of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge and wife of Prince William. And on 18 September a French court ordered the magazine to hand over all digital copies of the topless photos within 24 hours and blocked further publication of what it called a &quot;brutal display&quot; of the couple&#x27;s private moments. The case is the first of two legal actions, St. James&#x27;s Palace said that family lawyers would also be filing a criminal complaint.
* In October 2012, 19-year old Matthew Woods was jailed for 12 weeks because of jokes he made about two abducted children April Jones and Madeleine McCann. The messages, including &quot;Who in their right mind would abduct a ginger kid?&quot; were copied from Sickipedia and posted to Facebook. Although Woods was initially threatened with violence and detained for his own safety, prosecutors decided to charge him with sending a grossly offensive message, to which he pleaded guilty. Judge Bill Hudson opined that &quot;there was no other sentence this court could have passed which conveys to you the abhorrence that many in society feel this crime should receive.&quot;
* Also in October 2012, paroled criminal Barry Thew was sentenced to eight months in prison for wearing a T-shirt that expressed approval of police officers being murdered. This occurred shortly after the murder of Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone.
* In November 2012, Linford House, 19, was arrested in Canterbury under the Malicious Communications Act 1988 for posting a picture of a burning poppy on Facebook on Remembrance Sunday, accompanied by a message calling military personnel (squaddies) an offensive word. The act makes it a crime to send anything &quot;indecent or grossly offensive, or which conveys a threat … [where] there is an intent to cause distress or anxiety to the recipient&quot;. Nick Pickles, the director of the campaign group Big Brother Watch, argued: &quot;Kent police need to urgently release this man and drop an utterly ridiculous investigation into something that has harmed no one.&quot; The teenager was not charged after he met and apologised to serving and former military personnel.
* Between July and August 2013, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper was subject to prior restraint as well as property destruction by members of GCHQ following its publication of documents relating to PRISM, the NSA and Edward Snowden.
* From October 2013, The existence of the criminal case &quot;R v Incedal and Rarmoul-Bouhadjar&quot; was a complete secret until an application made by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. However, the details of the evidence involved and why the defendants were acquitted are still censored. The case involved Erol Incedal and Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar who were charged under the &quot;Terrorism Act 2000&quot; and the &quot;Terrorism Act 2006&quot;. &quot;Accredited journalists&quot; who were allowed to report the trial were denied possession of their physical reports (notebooks) and will be imprisoned if they publicly report their findings. The gagging order was upheld in February 2016 and censorship of the case continues.
* In January 2014, &quot;The Bible: The Complete Word Of God (Abridged)&quot; by the Reduced Shakespeare Company was cancelled due to pressure from the Democratic Unionist Party and politician Billy Ball. Amnesty International condemned the campaign.
* In April 2014, Liberty GB candidate Paul Weston was arrested after being reported by an audience member at a campaign speech. The complaint objected to his remarks on Islam which were quotations from a passage by Winston Churchill. The police later dropped the charges.
* In May 2014, LGBT activist Gareth Lee requested a cake from Ashers Bakery featuring the characters Bert and Ernie and the message &quot;support gay marriage&quot;. The owners refused, citing religious objection, and were successfully sued for £500 by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. The Bakery subsequently lost an appeal against the ruling. Columnist Kenan Malik criticised compelled speech and stated that the bakers did not break the law because they did not refuse service to Lee or any other gay customer. Activist Peter Tatchell adopted this view after supporting the lawsuit previously. In October 2018, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled unanimously the bakers did not refuse to fulfill the customer&#x27;s order because of his sexual orientation and would have refused to make a cake with this message for any customer, irrespective of their sexual orientation. Therefore, the Court ruled there was no discrimination on the grounds of the sexual orientation.
* In December 2014, 19-year old Ross Loraine was arrested and cited for making light of the 2014 Glasgow bin lorry crash on Twitter. The tweet, which he deleted shortly after posting, stated that after the driver&#x27;s vehicle struck pedestrians, this was &quot;the most trash it has picked up in one day&quot;.
* In March 2015, 24-year old Scott Lamont was sentenced to spend four months in jail for singing &quot;Billy Boys&quot; at a Rangers FC game. Sheriff Paul Crozier stated &quot;This sort of behaviour will not be tolerated, certainly not by me.&quot; Author Mick Hume condemned the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act under which Lamont was charged.
* In 2015, 78-year old pastor James McConnell went on trial for making a speech in Belfast which described Islam as &quot;satanic&quot; and &quot;heathen&quot;. Prosecutors argued that the speech was contrary to the Communications Act 2003 but he was eventually acquitted.
* In 2016, 23-year old Rowan O&#x27;Connell was fined £275 with costs of £115 for self-described trolling that he performed on Reddit. The anonymous post insulted Mzee Mohammed, who had died that year in police custody, by calling him a &quot;good for nothing, spice smoking Toxteth monkey&quot;.
* In April 2016, Scottish YouTuber Mark Meechan uploaded a video showing how he had trained his dog to raise its paw (similar to a Nazi salute) in response to Meechan saying &quot;sieg heil&quot; and &quot;gas the Jews&quot;. Meechan was arrested after sharing the video, with the video having been seen more than three millions times before it was removed by YouTube. Meechan said the video was intended to annoy his girlfriend. Meechan was supported in court by former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson. On 20 March 2018, the court convicted him of a hate crime under the Communications Act 2003, describing the material as &quot;grossly offensive&quot;. Tory MP Philip Davies requested a review of freedom of expression in parliament in response to the conviction. Comedians Ricky Gervais and David Baddiel tweeted in support of Meechan. Tom Walker, Shappi Khorsandi, and Stephen Fry defended Meechan and criticised other comedians for their silence on the issue. Meechan, who plans to appeal, was sentenced to pay an £800 fine ( which he refused to pay. The money was later seized from his bank account) on 23 April 2018. A crowd of about 500 people protested the move in London.
* In 2017, 19-year old Croxteth resident Chelsea Russell quoted a line from Snap Dogg&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m Trippin&#x27;&quot; on her Instagram page. The line, which read &quot;Kill a snitch nigga, rob a rich nigga&quot;, was copied from a friend&#x27;s page as part of a tribute to Frankie Murphy who was killed in a car accident at age 13. Hate crime investigators were alerted to the presence of the slur and charged Russell with &quot;sending a grossly offensive message by means of a public electronic communications network&quot;. Defence lawyer Carole Clarke stated that she received a request from one of the arresting officers that the word &quot;nigga&quot;, the subject of the trial, not be used in court. In April 2018, District Judge Jack McGarva found Russell guilty and delivered a sentence which included a £585 fine, a curfew and an ankle monitoring bracelet. However, this was overturned on appeal in February 2019.
* In March 2018, Humanists UK criticised Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls&#x27; School for censoring references to sexual orientation and women&#x27;s liberation in their class materials. A description of &quot;Roe v Wade&quot; was redacted from a history textbook and homosexuals were removed from the list of groups targeted by the Holocaust. Ofsted indicated that it would take this criticism into account when investigating the publicly funded school.
* In June 2018, the television show &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; was not permitted to broadcast a segment about Brexit in the UK, as the clip contained scenes of debate in the House of Commons. John Oliver, calling the restriction &quot;genuinely insane and frankly antidemocratic&quot;, replaced the clip in the UK broadcast with Gilbert Gottfried reading three-star Yelp reviews of Boise, Idaho, restaurants.
* In June 2018, Kingston upon Thames Crown Court imposed a Criminal Behaviour Order on five members of UK drill group 1011. The order restricts them from mentioning death or injury in their songs and requires them to notify police of video uploads 24 hours in advance and performances 48 hours in advance. The men, aged between 17 and 21, had previously been arrested with police saying that they planned to attack rival group 12 World with machetes and baseball bats. The 1011 members stated that the objects were props for a music video but pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit violent disorder. Liberty and Index on Censorship both announced opposition the order. Youth worker Ciaran Thapar criticised it as ineffective while solicitor Elena Papamichael compared it to &quot;blaming rock groups for drug use&quot;.
* In August 2018, transgender rights activist Giuliana Kendal brought a private prosecution against feminist activist Linda Bellos for discussing the possibility of a fight between Bellos and her political opponents.
* In October 2018, screenwriter Graham Linehan was given a &quot;verbal harassment warning&quot; for making Twitter posts that deadnamed transgender activist Stephanie Hayden. The exchange arose from a debate over whether legal recognition of a gender transition should require a medical opinion.
* In January 2019, community cohesion officer Mansoor Gul questioned Lincolnshire ex-police officer Harry Miller over the fact that he had retweeted a poem that condemned gender transitions. While confirming that no crime had been committed, Gul stated that it qualified as a &quot;hate incident&quot; and told Miller that his employer might be displeased. Miller also reported that he heard the line &quot;we need to check your thinking&quot;. Conservative MPs including Boris Johnson and Martin Vickers criticised the police response. Miller subsequently launched a legal challenge which concluded in February 2020. The judge&#x27;s ruling condemned the police for interfering with protected speech.
* In 2021, Piers Portman, the son of the 9th Viscount Portman, was sentenced and jailed for calling a male &#x27;Jewish Scum.&#x27; 
*In July 2022, British army veteran Darren Brady, was arrested &quot;on suspicion of sending by public communication network an offensive, indecent, obscene, menacing message&quot; for allegedly retweeting an image of the &quot;Progress Pride Flag&quot; arranged into a swastika. No further action was taken, and the arrest was later criticised by the Hampshire police and crime commissioner Donna Jones.
*In September 2022, a British woman was arrested and charged for holding up an &quot;abolish monarchy&quot; sign at a proclamation ceremony for King Charles III in Edinburgh. Similar arrests throughout the country around this period over anti-monarchy republican sentiment have alarmed human rights groups.
* In August 2024, in connection with the disorder following the knife attack in Southport, a man received a 21 month custodial sentence for the offence of stirring up racial hatred. He was convicted for a post saying to &quot;deflate the boats&quot; and saying people that didn&#x27;t support the disorder &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to live in the United Kingdom&quot;. In another post he seemed to identify places with high concentrations of migrants.

<text>The River Otter is a river that rises in the Blackdown Hills just inside the county of Somerset, England near Otterford, then flows south through East Devon. It enters the English Channel at the western end of Lyme Bay, part of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Permian and Triassic sandstone aquifer in the Otter Valley is one of Devon&#x27;s largest groundwater sources, supplying drinking water to 200,000 people.

==Topography==


The river&#x27;s source is north of Otterford, where a stream feeds the Otterhead Lakes: and then through Churchstanton before entering Devon.

The river flows through a predominantly rural area, with small cattle, sheep and dairy farms. The largest town in the Otter Valley is Honiton. Tourism and leisure play important roles in the economy. For much of its length, the river flows through two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) – the Blackdown Hills National Landscape (to the north of Honiton) and East Devon National Landscape (to the south of Ottery St Mary).

The river passes through or by Upottery, Rawridge, Monkton, Honiton, Alfington, Ottery St Mary, Tipton St John, Newton Poppleford and Otterton. It then reaches the Otter Estuary to the east of Budleigh Salterton.

The Otter Estuary Nature Reserve is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) consisting of tidal mudflats and saltmarsh. There is no public access to the estuary itself but footpaths lead to two viewing platforms on the west and two hides one on the west and one on the east. The wintering population of wildfowl and waders includes common redshank, greenshank, dunlin, common sandpiper, ringed plover, grey plover, Eurasian curlew, common snipe, water rail, Eurasian wigeon, Eurasian teal, common shelduck, brent goose, red-breasted merganser and little grebe. Eurasian reed warbler, reed bunting and sedge warbler breed on the reserve.

The Environment Agency measures the water level of the Otter and its tributaries at six or more &quot;river level stations&quot;.

The point at which the river reaches the coast () is part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site.

A small tributary is the River Tale, with the confluence NW of Ottery St Mary. This small town (associated with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Sir Walter Raleigh, and an annual tar barrel rolling event) is the site of an unusual circular weir, known as the Tumbling Weir. Another small tributary is Budleigh Brook, which joins the Otter at East Budleigh.

At one time there were as many as fifty watermills powered by the River Otter. One of the remaining working mills, thought to date from the 17th century, is Tracey Mill near Honiton. In the 1970s, fish ponds were dug around the mill, fed by the leat; over a million gallons of fresh water flow through these ponds every day, helping the commercial production of trout &quot;without the need for antibiotics or added oxygen&quot;.

One mill, at Dotton, is known to have operated from around 1100 to 1960, after which the building was demolished. The site was excavated by Channel 4&#x27;s archaeological television programme &quot;Time Team&quot;, the episode &quot;The Domesday Mill&quot; being broadcast in 2007. This mill is mentioned in the Domesday Book. A weir diverted water to the mill&#x27;s leat, supplying the vertical breast-shot wheel. Dotton (now little more than a farm) is from the mouth of the Otter, and about north of the village of Colaton Raleigh.

At the village of Otterton (once a seaport on a larger Otter Estuary), Otterton Mill is a working watermill over 1,000 years old; it was one of the three largest mills in Devon as recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is powered by water diverted through a leat. Immediately north of the leat, a fish pass has been constructed beside a river-wide weir, restoring migratory fish runs to the river after a break of over 100 years.

== Coleridge ==

The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834), who was born in Ottery St Mary, wrote a sonnet entitled &quot;Sonnet to the River Otter&quot;.

At Ottery St Mary the river is spanned by a foot and cycle bridge named Coleridge Bridge; built at a cost approaching £1 million, this was officially opened on 29 August 2011. A small area of land at one end of the bridge was sold to the local authority by William Coleridge, 5th Baron Coleridge, a descendant of the poet.

==Beaver population==
The Otter is the only river in England known to contain a wild breeding population of Eurasian beavers, a species that died out in Britain in around 1550. The origin of the population is not known; it was first noticed in 2013, apparently successfully bearing three kits the next year.

Following concern from local landowners and anglers, as well as farmers worrying that the beavers could carry disease, the government announced that it would capture the beavers and place them in a zoo or wildlife park. A sport fishing industry lobbyist group, the Angling Trust, said &quot;it would be irresponsible even to consider re-introducing this species into the wild without first restoring our rivers to good health.&quot;

This decision to immediately remove the beavers was protested by local residents and campaign groups, with environmental journalist George Monbiot describing the government and Angling Trust as &quot;control freaks&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m an angler, and the Angling Trust does not represent me on this issue...most anglers, in my experience, have a powerful connection with nature. The chance of seeing remarkable wild animals while waiting quietly on the riverbank is a major part of why we do it.&quot; The introduction of beavers to rivers has been encouraged by environmentalists, who have argued that beaver dams provide a habitat for birds and fish, reduce the strength of flooding by trapping water high up in a catchment area, away from homes further downstream, and could be a future tourist attraction.

In January 2015, Natural England said that the beavers would be allowed to remain on condition that they were disease-free and of the Eurasian species (not North American beavers, which would be invasive). These conditions were met, and the beavers were returned to the river as part of a five-year trial. In August 2020, the government announced that the beavers, which by then numbered 15 family groups, could remain on the river indefinitely. It was the first legally sanctioned reintroduction of an extinct native animal anywhere in England.

<text>The Bermuda skink, longnose skink, or (Bermuda) rock lizard (Plestiodon longirostris) is a critically endangered species and the only endemic land-living vertebrate of Bermuda. It is a relatively small skink (a kind of lizard): adults reach an average snout-to-vent length of about .

== Description ==
Adult Bermuda skinks (also known as &quot;rock lizards&quot;) have dark brown or black backs and are pinkish or light gray on the underside. Juveniles are lighter in color and have black stripes running along the sides of their bodies, which fade with age. Females are thought to retain the stripes longer than males. Adult males have larger heads. Hatchlings have bright blue tails. All have salmon orange cheeks and throat.

The Bermuda skink lives predominantly in rocky coastal areas. They feed on small invertebrates such as cockroaches or woodlice, but also on small terrestrial crustaceans.

While being more active during summer, the Bermuda skink does not hibernate, because the frost free winters allow it to be active year-round.

== Distribution ==
The species occurs only in Bermuda, and exists mainly on some of the smaller islands and nature reserves on the mainland, where the populations are fragmented into isolated pockets.
==Conservation==
The Bermuda skink has been listed on the IUCN Red List as critically endangered. It is threatened primarily by habitat destruction, predators introduced by humans (such as cats, rats, American crows, chickens, great kiskadees, yellow-crowned night herons, cane toads and anoles), as well as by human litter: the Bermuda skink has tiny claws on its feet, but no friction pads, and when it gets trapped in cast-away empty glass bottles or soda cans, it cannot climb out and thus starves or dies of heat stress or dehydration.

The Bermuda skink is listed as protected under the 2003 Bermuda Protected Species Act.

Chester Zoo is attempting to increase numbers of the skink with its own captive breeding program.

<doc id="607822" wikidata="Q16257550" url="?curid=607822" title="History of Ireland (400–795)">
<text>The early medieval history of Ireland, often referred to as Early Christian Ireland, spans the 5th to 8th centuries, from the gradual emergence out of the protohistoric period (Ogham inscriptions in Primitive Irish, mentions in Greco-Roman ethnography) to the beginning of the Viking Age. The period includes the Hiberno-Scottish mission of Christianised Ireland to regions of pagan Great Britain and the spread of Irish cultural influence to Continental Europe.

==Overview==
Early Christian Ireland began after the country emerged from a mysterious decline in population and standards of living that archaeological evidence suggests lasted from c. 100 to 300 AD. During this period, called the Irish Dark Age by Thomas Charles-Edwards, the population was entirely rural and dispersed, with small ringforts the largest centres of human occupation. Some 40,000 of these are known, although there may have been as many as 50,000, and &quot;archaeologists are agreed that the vast bulk of them are the farm enclosures of the well-to-do of early medieval Ireland&quot;. These commonly featured souterrains: underground passages and chambers for hiding in or escaping through. It is likely that raiding Great Britain for slaves and other loot gave an important boost to an otherwise almost entirely agricultural economy. The lakeside enclosures called crannógs continued to be used and seem especially associated with crafts.

The older view that early medieval Irish farming concentrated on livestock has been overturned by pollen studies and other evidence, and it is now clear that cereal farming was increasingly important from about AD 200 onwards, with barley and oats more important crops than rye, wheat and others. Cattle were greatly prized, and cattle-raiding constituted a large part of warfare, so cattle needed the constant presence of a herdsman in daylight hours and were put in an enclosure at night. By the end of the period, the largest herds were probably those of monasteries. Generally, mild Irish winters seem to have meant they were never put in roofed shelters in winter, although young calves might spend a period in the house. There was a very considerable clearance of forests in the early part of the period, such that by the 9th century, large tracts of forest appear to have been rare, and the native Scots pine cleared almost to extinction; the large areas of bogland were harder for the medieval Irish to affect.

By 800, small towns had started to form around some of the larger monasteries, such as Trim and Lismore, and some kings were based in them, but the foundation of larger towns by the Vikings had yet to occur. Otherwise, kings lived in ringforts larger than the norm, but generally similar; however the possession of luxury objects such as elaborate Celtic brooches was much greater among royalty. The latter part of the period was the peak of the Irish contribution to Insular art, whose surviving products include illuminated manuscripts, most famously the Book of Kells, brooches, which were worn by clergy as well as nobles, carved stone high crosses, and other isolated survivals of metalwork, such as the Derrynaflan and Ardagh Hoards.

==Early Christian history==
Recorded Irish history begins with the introduction of Christianity and Latin literacy, beginning in the 5th century or possibly slightly before. When compared to neighbouring Insular societies, early Christian Ireland is well documented, at least for later periods, but these sources are not easy to interpret. Many questions remain unanswered and the study of early Christian Ireland continues to produce new theories and new discoveries. Since the later 19th century, when scholars such as Kuno Meyer and Whitley Stokes applied an increasingly rigorous approach to the study of written sources, a great deal of new information has been extracted from the written material. New fields, such as paleobotany, have contributed to the debate, while the volume of archaeological evidence has increased.

===Ecclesiastical history===

The first reliable historical event in Irish history, recorded in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Prosper of Aquitaine, is the ordination by Pope Celestine I of Palladius as the first bishop to Irish Christians in 431 – which demonstrates that there were already Christians living in Ireland. Prosper says in his &quot;Contra Collatorem&quot; that by this act Celestine &quot;made the barbarian island Christian&quot;, although it is clear the Christianisation of the island was a longer and more gradual process. The mission of Saint Patrick is traditionally dated around the same time – the earliest date for his arrival in Ireland in the Irish annals is 432 – although Patrick&#x27;s own writings contain nothing securely dateable. It is likely that Palladius&#x27; activities were in the south of Ireland, perhaps associated with Cashel, while Patrick&#x27;s were later, in the north, and associated with Armagh.

By the early 6th century the church had developed separate dioceses, with bishops as the most senior ecclesiastical figures, but the country was still predominantly pagan. The High Kings of Ireland continued pagan practices until the reign of Diarmait mac Cerbaill c. 558, traditionally the first Christian High King. The monastic movement, headed by abbots, took hold in the mid 6th century, and by 700 Ireland was at least nominally a Christian country, with the church fully part of Irish society. The status of ecclesiastics was regulated by secular law, and many leading ecclesiastics came from aristocratic Irish families. Monasteries in the 8th century even went to war with each other.

From the 7th century on, Irish churchmen such as Columbanus and Columba were active in Gaul, in Scotland and in Anglo-Saxon England. The mixing of Irish, Pictish, Anglo-Saxon and even Byzantine styles created the Insular style of art, represented by the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells. Ireland&#x27;s reputation for scholarship was such that many scholars travelled from Britain and the European mainland to study in Irish schools.

===Political history===
Eoin MacNeill identified the &quot;oldest certain fact in the political history of Ireland&quot; as the existence in late prehistory of a pentarchy, probably consisting of the &quot;cóiceda&quot; or &quot;fifths&quot; of the Ulaid (Ulster), the Connachta (Connacht), the Laigin (Leinster), Mumu (Munster) and Mide (Meath), although some accounts discount Mide and split Mumu in two. However, by the dawn of history this pentarchy no longer existed. The rise of new dynasties, notably the Uí Néill in the north and midlands and the Eóganachta in the south-west, changed the political landscape. The Uí Néill, or their parent group the Connachta, reduced the former fifth of the Ulaid to counties Down and Antrim in the 4th or 5th centuries, establishing the tributary kingdom of the Airgíalla in the centre and the Uí Néill kingdom of Ailech in the west of the old province. Early Irish annals also show regular warfare between the Uí Néill and the Laigin in the midlands, with the Uí Néill conquering as far south as the Kildare/Offaly border, and claiming the kingship of Tara, beginning to be conceptualised as the High Kingship of Ireland. This led to a new division of the country into two halves, &quot;Leth Cuinn&quot;, &quot;Conn&#x27;s half&quot; after Conn of the Hundred Battles, supposed ancestor of the Uí Néill and Connachta, in the north, and &quot;Leth Moga&quot;, &quot;Mug&#x27;s half&quot;, after Mug Nuadat, supposed ancestor of the Eoganachta, in the south. Dynastic propaganda claimed this was a traditional division dating back to the 2nd century, but it probably originated in the 8th, at the height of Uí Néill power.

<doc id="607826" wikidata="Q7043156" url="?curid=607826" title="No. 216 Squadron RAF">
<text>Number 216 Squadron is a squadron of the Royal Air Force based at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, since reforming on 1 April 2020 and is tasked with testing future drone swarm technology. It had previously operated Lockheed TriStar K1, KC1 and C2s from RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, between November 1984 and March 2014.

==History==
===First World War===
No. 216 Squadron&#x27;s beginnings can be traced back to August 1917 when No. 7 Squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) sent a detachment of four Handley Page O/100 to Redcar in order to fly anti-submarine missions. Moving to Manston in October, the unit was re-designated as &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron. At the end of October, &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron was deployed to Ochey, France, joining No. 41 Wing as a strategic night bomber squadron. On 8 January 1918, &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron was re-designated as No. 16 Squadron (RNAS). In March, the squadron began to convert to the Handley Page O/400. On the night of 24/25 March, an aircraft from the squadron carried out an 8 and a half hour attack on Cologne. On 1 April, while operating out of Villeseneux (south east of Reims), No. 16 Squadron (RNAS) became No. 216 Squadron of the Royal Air Force.

===Interwar===
Between the two World Wars the squadron used Vickers Vimy, Vickers Victoria and Vickers Type 264 Valentia aircraft on transport duties around the Middle East. No. 216 Squadron had their squadron badge approved by King Edward VIII in May 1936.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, with a few exceptions, such as the attacks from 17 to 21 June 1940 by a single aircraft of No. 216 Squadron on the airfields of El Adem and Tobruk, the unit was principally a transport squadron, operating the Vickers Type 264 Valentia, Bristol Bombay, de Havilland DH86, Lockheed Hudson and Douglas Dakota. It spent a lengthy time deployed to Cairo from November 1942 to July 1945.

===Post-War===
In late 1949, the Dakotas were replaced by Vickers Valettas transport aircraft; in 1955 the squadron moved to RAF Lyneham from RAF Fayid in Egypt to operate the De Havilland Comet C.2 jet airliner until 27 June 1975, when No. 216 Squadron disbanded after 58 years of service.

The squadron reformed at RAF Honington on 1 July 1979 as a maritime strike squadron assigned to Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) with twelve Blackburn Buccaneer S.2 aircraft transferred from the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s 809 Naval Air Squadron. These aircraft had been embarked on until flying off for the last time in November 1978 for a delivery flight from the carrier in the Mediterranean to RAF St Athan. Designated Buccaneer S2A by the RAF, they were equipped with twelve WE.177A nuclear bombs, free-falling conventional HE bombs and Martel missiles for non-nuclear strike. However, on 7 February 1980, a No. XV Squadron Buccaneer crashed after a wing failed in flight during the Red Flag exercise in the USA. The resulting grounding and inspections saw the size of the Buccaneer fleet reduced, with the result that No. 216 Squadron had its assets merged with No. 12 (Bomber) Squadron barely a year after its reformation, however the squadron was not officially disbanded.

===Lockheed TriStar (1984–2014)===

Following the Falklands War, the RAF found itself lacking in the strategic transport capabilities required to sustain the expanded military presence there; this shortfall was filled initially by chartered British Airways Boeing 747s and Britannia Airways Boeing 767s. To address this, in December 1982 the RAF purchased six former British Airways Lockheed TriStar 500s. The first TriStar (ZD949) was leased back to British Airways on 29 March 1983 until November, eventually undergoing conversion at Cambridge Airport by Marshall Aerospace in 1986. In 1984, the RAF purchased a further three TriStar 500s from Pan-Am. 

No. 216 Squadron was reactivated on 1 November 1984 at RAF Brize Norton to operate the Lockheed TriStar. The aircraft were operated initially in the air-transport role but the fleet&#x27;s role was eventually expanded to air-to-air refuelling. On 24 March 1986, TriStar KC.1 &quot;ZD953&quot; became the first aircraft to be handed over to the squadron. 

No. 216 Squadron deployed the TriStar fleet in support of many high-profile missions including the Gulf War (for which the aircraft received a desert paint scheme), Operation Allied Force (Kosovo), Operation Veritas and Operation Herrick (Afghanistan), Operation Telic (Iraq 2003) and Operation Ellamy (Libya).

The squadron was disbanded on 20 March 2014 at RAF Brize Norton, with the last Tristar sortie being flown on 24 March. In October 2017, it was announced that Queen Elizabeth II had approved the award of &#x27;Iraq 2003–2011&#x27; and &#x27;Libya 2011&#x27; battle honours to No. 216 Squadron (without the right to emblazon).

===Unmanned &#x27;loyal wingmen&#x27; (2020–present)===
On 17 July 2019, at the Air &amp; Space Power Conference, the RAF announced that No. 216 Squadron would reform to become an experimental unit that will test future drone swarm technology. No. 216 Squadron formally stood up on 1 April 2020 at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire. In March 2024, James Cartlidge, the minister for defence procurement, informed Parliament that notwithstanding its formation in 2020, 216 Squadron had “completed [no] tests or trials [of any drones] ... either in-house or with industry” since being reconstituted.

In a large change, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence Luke Pollard answered a written parliamentary question stating that the squadron will transition from its current role as the swarming drone trials unit &quot;to become the operational delivery squadron for an Autonomous Collaborative Platforms [ACP] capability in 2025.&quot; The ACP is also known as the &#x27;loyal wingman&#x27; and 216 Squadron will initially be a blend of a test and evaluation and more traditional frontline squadron as the capability transitions from a research and development to an operational footing. The role of the drone trials unit will pass to 744 Naval Air Squadron as the Joint Uncrewed Air System Test and Evaluation Squadron.

<text>The Judicates (, or in Sardinian, in Latin, or in Italian), in English also referred to as Sardinian Kingdoms, Sardinian Judgedoms or Judicatures, were independent states that took power in Sardinia in the Middle Ages, between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries. They were sovereign states with &quot;summa potestas&quot;, each with a ruler called judge ( in Sardinian), with the powers of a king.

==Historical causes of the advent of the kingdoms==

After a relatively brief Vandal occupation (456–534), Sardinia was a province of the Byzantine Empire from 535 until the eighth century.

After 705, with the rapid Arab expansion, Saracen pirates from North Africa began to raid the island and encountered no effective opposition by the Byzantine army. In 815, Sardinian ambassadors requested military assistance from the Carolingian Emperor Louis the Pious.

In 807, 810–812, and 821–822 the Arabs of Spain and North Africa tried to invade the island but the Sardinians resisted several attacks. This defence was so effective that in a letter in 851 Pope Leo IV asked the (&#x27;judge of the province&#x27;) of Sardinia, based in Caralis, for aid in the defense of Rome. With the fall of the Exarchate of Africa, based in Carthage, at the end of the seventh century, and especially with the emergence of the Arab presence in Sicily (827), Sardinia remained disconnected from the core lands of the Byzantine Empire and had, out of necessity, become economically and militarily independent.


===The birth of the four kingdoms===
The almost total absence of historical sources does not allow certainty surrounding the date of the passage from Byzantine central authority to self-government in Sardinia. It is believed that at some point the or Archon of Sardinia, residing in Caralis, had complete control of the island. He appointed, in the most strategic area for the defense of the coast, the (lieutenant), belonging to his family, the Lacon-Gunale, who became substantially autonomous from Caralis over time; this was probably the action that precipitated the birth of the kingdoms, or &quot;judgedoms&quot;.

The first incontrovertible source that cites the existence of four kingdoms is the epistle sent by Pope Gregory VII from Capua on October 14, 1073 to the Sardinian judges Orzocco of Cagliari, Orzocco d&#x27;Arborea, Marianus of Torres and Constantine of Gallura; however their autonomy was already clear in a later letter of Pope John VIII (872) in which he referred to them as (&quot;princes of Sardinia&quot;).

The known medieval giudicati were:

*Kingdom of Cagliari with capital in Santa Igia
*Kingdom of Arborea with capital in Oristano,
*Kingdom of Gallura with capital in Civita,
*Kingdom of Torres with capital in Porto Torres, Ardara and then Sassari.
Each of the four States had fortified borders to protect their political and commercial interests, as well their own laws, administration and emblems.

==Governments==
The administrative organization of the &quot;judgedoms&quot; differed significantly from the feudal forms existing in the rest of medieval Europe as their institutions were closer to those of the territories of the Byzantine Empire, although with local peculiarities that some scholars consider of Nuragic derivation.

In the international context of the Middle Ages, the &quot;judgedoms&quot; were characterized by semi-democratic institutions such as the which in turn elected their own representatives to the parliamentary assizes called .

===The Corona de Logu and the central council===
The central government and the entire Judiciary were ruled substantially by the judge. The king did not have possession of the land nor was he the repository of sovereignty since this was formally held by the , a council of elders (representatives of the administrative districts - ) and high priests. They appointed the ruler and attributed the supreme power to him, while maintaining the power to ratify acts and agreements related to the entire kingdom.

During (coronation ceremony) in the capital, a representative of each , members of the high clergy, the castle lords, two representatives of the capital elected by delegates from , came together. Then the was crowned with a mixed-elected hereditary system following the direct male line and, only in the alternative, the female line.

The judge ruled on the basis of a covenant with the people (the ). The sovereign could be dethroned and even, in cases of serious acts of tyranny and oppression, executed legitimately by the same people, without this prejudging the inheritance of the title within the same ruling dynasty.
===Judges===

The judge was not an absolute ruler in the sense of later absolutism—at least in form: he could not declare war or sign a peace treaty without the consent of the . However, that was composed primarily of the nobility&#x27;s relatives and, therefore, linked by common interests.

The succession to the throne was dynastic but in some case there was the possibility of election by the .

===The judicial chancellery===
In the government of the territory, the Judge was assisted by the Chancellery. The sovereign authority was in fact formalized with the drafting of official acts called paper, written by the statal chancellor, usually a bishop or at least a senior member of the clergy, assisted by other officials called .

===Local administration===
====Curadorias====

The territory of various kingdoms was divided into , administrative districts of varying sizes formed by urban and rural villages, dependent on a capital which housed the . These administrators, aided especially by (judges) and a council the , represented the judicial authority locally and tended to the public property of the Crown.

The appointed for each village was part of the a (the modern equivalent of a mayor) with administrative and judicial powers, and direct responsibility for the successful actions of land management.

===Law===
The &quot;Cartas de Logu&quot; are collections of penal, public, civil and land regulations of great importance, in force in the various Giudicati. Unfortunately, only a few parts of the &quot;Carta Caralitana&quot; have been preserved. The Carta de Logu of the Giudicato of Arborea marks, towards the end of the fourteenth century, the birth of a rule of law by Mariano IV first and then by his daughter Eleonora, who extended the scope of the rules to adapt them to a changed reality in social conditions. The Chart is written in Sardinian (of the Logudorese variety) and from this we can deduce the judicial intent to actually make it known to citizens in order to make them aware of lawful and unlawful behaviors, with the consequent criminal implications. A situation of legal certainty is therefore defined.

The chart survived, albeit with some difficulty, the judicial period and remained in force in the Spanish and Savoyard era until the enactment of the Code of Carlo Felice in April 1827. From the study of the Chart we can deduce a great attention of the Giudicati towards the protection of the safety of the countryside and agricultural production, including horse breeding and leather production, even to the detriment of sheep farming. This denotes a great attention towards the productive base which supports the efforts of the enemies in the struggle for the independence of Sardinia.

The Condaghes are also of great importance for the study of the judicial period between the 11th and 13th centuries. Term of Byzantine origin (&quot;kontakion&quot; - stick on which cards sewn together were rolled up) which defines the register on which the parchments of the deeds of donation to monasteries or other ecclesiastical bodies were transcribed. In them the sums of money, the servants, the maids, the cultivated lands, the vineyards, the wooded areas (the salts), the pastures and the livestock donated by the local nobility were reported in great detail. From the Condaghes it was possible to reconstruct a large part of the judicial dynamics known to us as well as being the most ancient evidence of the ancient Sardinian vernacular.

==Judicial army==
The Sardinian &quot;judicial&quot; armies were composed of troops made up of soldiers and free citizens, subject to periodic rotation. In an emergency forced conscription was used. The elite corps was made up of so-called , chosen riders who served under the command of the , the commander in charge of the security of the sovereign. The main armaments were the sword, chain mail, the shield, the helmet, and the , a weapon similar to the ancient , the Roman javelin.

The militias of the ground and the infantry () used a shorter version of this same weapon. Besides the use of spears and shields, another common weapon was the , a sword with a bone handle and curved blade, between 50 and 70 cm long which was still in use, in a more contained dimension, until the end of nineteenth century. In Sardinia a type of longbow was made, and over time the use of the crossbow spread.

In case of conflict judges often used mercenary troops, such as the dreaded Genoese crossbowmen.

==Culture==
===Religion===

Christianity spread throughout most of the island in the early centuries, excluding much of the Barbagia region. At the end of the sixth century Pope Gregory I reached an agreement with Hospito, chief of the , that guaranteed the conversion of his people from paganism to Christianity. Since Sardinia was in the political sphere of the Byzantine Empire, it developed an array of Greek and Eastern Christianity traits as a result of evangelisation by Basilian monks.


The Sardinian Church was an autocephalous institution for five centuries, independent from both the Byzantine and the Roman Curia. In the eleventh century, after the schism of 1054, the , according to Pope Alexander II, began a policy for the development of Western monasticism on the island, with the aim of a wider dissemination of culture but also of new techniques for cultivating the land. The immigration of monastics to the island was fueled by donated funds, and local churches were built by the &quot;judicial&quot; aristocracy. However, there were still strong ties with the Eastern liturgy. In 1092 a papal bull expressly abolished the autonomy and autocephaly of the Church of Sardinia, which was placed under the primacy of the Archbishop of Pisa.

The first act of donation was made in 1064 by Barisone I of Torres who gave the Benedictine monks of Monte Cassino a large area of its territory with churches (including the Byzantine church of Nostra Segnora de Mesumundu), not far from the then capital of Ardara. For several centuries afterwards representatives of many religious orders including the monks of the Abbey of Montecassino, the Camaldolese, the Vallombrosians, the Vittorini of Marseille, the Cistercians of Bernard of Clairvaux arrived and settled in Sardinia. As a result of this, Romanesque architecture flourished in the island.

===Language===
Byzantine Greek was used as an administrative language during the Byzantine period, but fell into disuse. Latin, which had long been the language of the native population, developed into the Sardinian language and became the official language. It was also used in legal and administrative documents such as the , municipal statutes, and the laws of the kingdoms such as the .

==Pisan-Genoese and Aragonese interference and end of the four kingdoms==
Pisa and Genoa began to infiltrate the Judicial politics and economy in the eleventh century intervening to support the , against the Taifa of Dénia, an Iberian Muslim kingdom, which was trying to conquer the island.
From the second half of the thirteenth century the autonomous existence of the kingdoms of Logudoro, Gallura and Calari ended due to the diplomatic maneuvers of Genoa and Pisa on the territory, on trade, on the episcopal curiae, and the &quot;judicial&quot; chancelleries. The Kingdom of Logudoro ended effectively in 1259 with the direct management of his territories by the Doria and the Malaspina Genoese families. Cagliari was conquered by a Pisan-Sardinian alliance in 1258 and his territory was divided between the winners. Gallura went to the Visconti family and then to Pisa in 1288.

Arborea lasted longer and, between 1323 and 1326, participated in an alliance with the Crown of Aragon at the conquest of the Pisan possessions in Sardinia (the former kingdoms of Gallura and Calari). However, threatened by the Aragonese claims of suzerainty and consolidation of the rest of the island, in 1353 the Kingdom of Arborea, under Marianus IV of Arborea, broke the alliance with the Aragonese and together with the Doria declared war against the Iberians. In 1368 an Arborean offensive succeeded in nearly driving the Aragonese from the island, reducing the Kingdom of Sardinia to just the port cities of Cagliari and Alghero and incorporating everything else into their own kingdom. A peace treaty returned the Aragonese their previous possessions in 1388, but tensions continued. In 1391 the Arborean army, led by Brancaleone Doria, again conquered most of the island, subjecting it to Arborean rule. This state of affairs lasted until 1409, when the army of the Kingdom of Arborea suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of the Aragonese army in the Battle of Sanluri.

The Kingdom of Arborea ceased to exist in 1420, after the sale of its territories to the Aragonese by the last judge, William II of Narbonne, for 100,000 gold florins.

<text>In computing, redirection is a form of interprocess communication, and is a function common to most command-line interpreters, including the various Unix shells that can redirect standard streams to user-specified locations. The concept of redirection is quite old, dating back to the earliest operating systems (OS). A discussion of the design goals for redirection can be found already in the 1971 description of the input-output subsystem of the Multics OS. However, prior to the introduction of UNIX OS with its &quot;pipes&quot;, redirection in operating systems was hard or even impossible to do.

In Unix-like operating systems, programs do redirection with the system call, or its less-flexible but higher-level stdio analogues, and .

==Redirecting standard input and standard output==
Redirection is usually implemented by placing certain characters between commands.

===Basic===
Typically, the syntax of these characters is as follows, using codice_1 to redirect input, and codice_2 to redirect output. command &gt; file1 executes , placing the output in , as opposed to displaying it at the terminal, which is the usual destination for standard output. This will clobber any existing data in .

Using command &lt; file1 executes , with as the source of input, as opposed to the keyboard, which is the usual source for standard input.

command &lt; infile &gt; outfile combines the two capabilities: reads from and writes to 

===Variants===
To append output to the end of the file, rather than clobbering it, the codice_3 operator is used: command1 » file1.

To read from a stream literal (an inline file, passed to the standard input), one can use a here document, using the codice_4 operator:

$ tr a-z A-Z « END_TEXT
&gt; one two three
&gt; uno dos tres
&gt; END_TEXT
ONE TWO THREE
UNO DOS TRES
To read from a string, one can use a here string, using the codice_5 operator: tr a-z A-Z «&lt; &quot;one two three&quot;, or:
$ NUMBERS=&quot;one two three&quot;
$ tr a-z A-Z «&lt; &quot;$NUMBERS&quot;
ONE TWO THREE
==Piping==

Programs can be run together such that one program reads the output from another with no need for an explicit intermediate file. command1 | command2 executes , using its output as the input for (commonly called piping, with the &quot;codice_6&quot; character being known as the &quot;pipe&quot;).

The two programs performing the commands may run in parallel with the only storage space being working buffers (Linux allows up to 64K for each buffer) plus whatever work space each command&#x27;s processing requires. For example, a &quot;sort&quot; command is unable to produce any output until all input records have been read, as the very last record received just might turn out to be first in sorted order. Dr. Alexia Massalin&#x27;s experimental operating system, Synthesis, would adjust the priority of each task as they ran according to the fullness of their input and output buffers.

This produces the same end result as using two redirects and a temporary file, as in:
$ command1 &gt; tempfile
$ command2 &lt; tempfile
$ rm tempfile
But here, does not start executing until has finished, and a sufficiently large scratch file is required to hold the intermediate results as well as whatever work space each task required. As an example, although DOS allows the &quot;pipe&quot; syntax, it employs this second approach. Thus, suppose some long-running program &quot;Worker&quot; produces various messages as it works, and that a second program, TimeStamp copies each record from &quot;stdin&quot; to &quot;stdout&quot;, prefixed by the system&#x27;s date and time when the record is received. A sequence such as Worker | TimeStamp &gt; LogFile.txt would produce timestamps only when Worker had finished, merely showing how swiftly its output file could be read and written.

A good example for command piping is combining codice_7 with another command to achieve something interactive in a non-interactive shell, e.g. echo -e &#x27;user\npass&#x27; | ftp localhost. This runs the ftp client with input , press , then .

In casual use, the initial step of a pipeline is often codice_8 or codice_9, reading from a file or string. This can often be replaced by input indirection or a here string, and use of cat and piping rather than input redirection is known as useless use of cat. For example, the following commands:

$ cat infile | command
$ echo $string | command
$ echo -e &#x27;user\npass&#x27; | ftp localhost

can be replaced by:

$ command &lt; infile
$ command «&lt; $string
$ ftp localhost «&lt; $&#x27;user\npass&#x27;

As codice_9 is often a shell-internal command, its use is not as criticized as cat, which is an external command.

==Redirecting to and from the standard file handles==
In Unix shells derived from the original Bourne shell, the first two actions can be further modified by placing a number (the file descriptor) immediately before the character; this will affect which stream is used for the redirection. The Unix standard I/O streams are:

For example, executes , directing the standard error stream to .

In shells derived from csh (the C shell), the syntax instead appends the (ampersand) character to the redirect characters, thus achieving a similar result. The reason for this is to distinguish between a file named &#x27;1&#x27; and stdout, i.e. vs . In the first case, stderr is redirected to a file named &quot; and in the second, stderr is redirected to stdout.

Another useful capability is to redirect one standard file handle to another. The most popular variation is to merge standard error into standard output so error messages can be processed together with (or alternately to) the usual output. For example, will try to find all files named . Executed without redirection, it will output hits to stdout and errors (e.g. for lack of privilege to traverse protected directories) to stderr. If standard output is directed to file , error messages appear on the console. To see both hits and error messages in file , merge stderr (handle 2) into stdout (handle 1) using .

If the merged output is to be piped into another program, the file merge sequence must precede the pipe symbol, thus, 

A simplified but non-POSIX conforming form of the command, is (not available in Bourne Shell prior to version 4, final release, or in the standard shell Debian Almquist shell used in Debian/Ubuntu): or .

It is possible to use codice_11 before &quot;codice_2&quot; but the result is commonly misunderstood.
The rule is that any redirection sets the handle to the output stream independently.
So &quot;codice_11&quot; sets handle codice_14 to whatever handle codice_15 points to, which at that point usually is &quot;stdout&quot;.
Then &quot;codice_2&quot; redirects handle codice_15 to something else, e.g. a file, but it does not change handle codice_14, which still points to &quot;stdout&quot;.

In the following example, standard output is written to &quot;file&quot;, but errors are redirected from stderr to stdout, i.e. sent to the screen: .

To write both errors and standard output to &quot;file&quot;, the order should be reversed. Standard output would first be redirected to the file, then stderr would additionally be redirected to the stdout handle that has already been changed to point at the file: .

==Chained pipelines==
The redirection and piping tokens can be chained together to create complex commands. For example, sort infile | uniq -c | sort -n &gt; outfile sorts the lines of in lexicographical order, writes unique lines prefixed by the number of occurrences, sorts the resultant output numerically, and places the final output in . This type of construction is used very commonly in shell scripts and batch files.

==Redirect to multiple outputs==
The standard command can redirect output from a command to several destinations:ls -lrt | tee xyz. This directs the file list output to both standard output and the file .

<text>Hotepsekhemwy is the Horus name of an early Egyptian king who was the founder of the Second Dynasty of Egypt. The exact length of his reign is not known; the Turin canon suggests an improbable 95 years while the ancient Egyptian historian Manetho reports that the reign of &quot;Boëthôs&quot; lasted for 38 years. Egyptologists consider both statements to be misinterpretations or exaggerations. They credit Hotepsekhemwy with either a 25- or a 29-year rule.

== Name sources ==

Hotepsekhemwy&#x27;s name has been identified by archaeologists at Sakkara, Giza, Badari and Abydos from clay seal impressions, stone vessels and bone cylinders. Several stone vessel inscriptions mention Hotepsekhemwy along with the name of his successor Raneb.

The Horus name of Hotepsekhemwy is the subject of particular interest to Egyptologists and historians, as it may hint at the turbulent politics of the time. The Egyptian word &quot;Hotep&quot; means &quot;peaceful&quot; and &quot;to be pleased&quot; though it can also mean &quot;conciliation&quot; or &quot;to be reconciled&quot;, too. So Hotepsekhemwy&#x27;s full name may be read as &quot;the two powers are reconciled&quot; or &quot;pleasing in powers&quot;, which suggests a significant political meaning. In this sense, &quot;the two powers&quot; could be a reference to Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt as well as to the major deities Horus and Seth.

From the reign of Hotepsekhemwy onward it became a tradition to write the Horus name and the Nebty name in the same way. It is thought that some kind of philosophic background affected that choice, since the Horus name reveals a clearly defined, symbolic meaning in its translation. Horus- and nebty names being the same might also indicate, that the Horus name was adopted after ascending the throne.
== Family ==
The name of Hotepsekhemwy&#x27;s wife is unknown. A &quot;son of the king&quot; and &quot;priest of Sopdu&quot; named &quot;Perneb&quot; might have been his son, but since the clay seals providing his name and titles were found in a gallery tomb which is attributed to two kings equally (Hotepsekhemwy and his successor, Raneb), it is uncertain whose son Perneb really was.

== Identity and possible misreadings ==

Hotepsekhemwy is commonly identified with the Ramesside cartouche names &quot;Bedjau&quot; from the Abydos King List, &quot;Bedjatau&quot; from Giza, &quot;Netjer-Bau&quot; from the Sakkara King List and the name &quot;Bau-hetepju&quot; from the royal canon of Turin. Egyptologist Wolfgang Helck points to the similar name &quot;Bedjatau&quot;, which appears in a short king list found on a writing board from the mastaba tomb G1001 of the high official Mesdjeru. &quot;Bedjatau&quot; means &quot;the foundryman&quot; and is thought to be a misreading of the name &quot;Hotepsekhemwy&quot;, since the hieroglyphic signs used to write &quot;Hotep&quot; in its full form are very similar to the signs of a pottery kiln and a chick in hieratic writings. The signs of two &quot;Sekhem&quot; sceptres were misread as a leg and a drill. A similar phenomenon might have occurred in the case of King Khasekhemwy, where the two sceptres in the Horus name were misread as two leg-symbols or two drill-signs. The Abydos king list imitates this Old Kingdom name form of &quot;Bedjatau&quot;. The names &quot;Netjerbau&quot; and &quot;Bau-hetepju&quot; are problematic, since Egyptologists can&#x27;t find any name source from Hotepsekhemwy&#x27;s time that could have been used to form them.

== Reign ==
Little is known about Hotepsekhemwy&#x27;s reign. Contemporary sources show that he may have gained the throne after a period of political strife, including ephemeral rulers such as Horus Bird and Sneferka (the latter is also thought to be an alternate name used by king Qa&#x27;a for a short time). As evidence of this, Egyptologists Wolfgang Helck, Dietrich Wildung and George Reisner point to the tomb of king Qa&#x27;a, which was plundered at the end of 1st Dynasty and was restored during the reign of Hotepsekhemwy. The plundering of the cemetery and the unusually conciliatory meaning of the name Hotepsekhemwy may be clues of a dynastic struggle. Additionally, Helck assumes that the kings Sneferka and Horus Bird were omitted from later king lists because their struggles for the Egyptian throne were factors in the collapse of the first dynasty.

Seal impressions provide evidence of a new royal residence called &quot;Horus the shining star&quot; that was constructed by Hotepsekhemwy. He also built a temple near Buto for the little-known deity &quot;Netjer-Achty&quot; and founded the &quot;Chapel of the White Crown&quot;. The white crown is a symbol of Upper Egypt. This is thought to be another clue to the origin of Hotepsekhemwy&#x27;s dynasty, indicating a likely source of political power. Egyptologists such as Nabil Swelim point out that there is no inscription from Hotepsekhemwy&#x27;s reign mentioning a Sed festival, indicating the ruler cannot have ruled longer than 30 years (the Sed festival was celebrated as the anniversary marking a reign of 30 years).

The ancient Egyptian historian Manetho called Hotepsekhemwy &quot;Boëthôs&quot; (apparently altered from the name &quot;Bedjau&quot;) and reported that during this ruler&#x27;s reign &quot;a chasm opened near Bubastis and many perished&quot;. Although Manetho wrote in the 3rd century BC—over two millennia after the king&#x27;s actual reign—some Egyptologists think it possible that this anecdote may have been based on fact, since the region near Bubastis is known to be seismically active.

== Tomb ==
The location of Hotepsekhemwy&#x27;s tomb is uncertain. Egyptologists such as Flinders Petrie, Alessandro Barsanti and Toby Wilkinson believe it could be the giant underground &quot;Gallery Tomb A&quot; beneath the funeral passage of the Unas-necropolis at Saqqara. Many seal impressions of king Hotepsekhemwy have been found in these galleries.

Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck and Peter Munro are not convinced and think that &quot;Gallery Tomb B&quot; is instead the burial site of king Raneb, as several seal impressions of this ruler were also found there.

The more accepted theory is that Hotepsekhemwy and his son Raneb shared Tomb A.

<text>Statistics New Zealand defines urban areas of New Zealand for statistical purposes (they have no administrative or legal basis). The urban areas comprise cities, towns and other conurbations (an aggregation of urban settlements) of a thousand people or more. In combination, the urban areas of the country constitute New Zealand&#x27;s urban population. As of , the urban population made up % of New Zealand&#x27;s total population.

The current standard for urban areas is the Statistical Standard for Geographic Areas 2018 (SSGA18), which replaced the New Zealand Standard Areas Classification 1992 (NZSAC92) in 2018.

There are four classes of urban area under SSGA18:
*Major urban areas, with a population of 100,000 or more. There are seven major urban areas which combined have a population of (% of the total population).
*Large urban areas, with a population of 30,000 to 99,999. There are 13 large urban areas which combined have a population of (% of the total population).
*Medium urban areas, with a population of 10,000 to 29,999. There are 23 medium urban areas which combined have a population of (% of the total population).
*Small urban areas, with a population of 1,000 to 9,999. There are 152 small urban areas which combined have a population of (% of the total population).
Each urban area consists of one or more level-2 statistical areas (SA2s). Urban areas under SSGA18 do not cross territorial authority boundaries, with one exception (Richmond, which lies in the Tasman District but includes the Daelyn SA2 area from neighbouring Nelson City).

Statistics New Zealand also defines rural settlements with a population of 200 to 999 people or at least 40 dwellings. While these do not fit the standard international definition of an urban population, they serve to distinguish between true rural dwellers and those in rural settlements or towns. There are 402 rural settlements which combined have a population of (% of the total population).

In 2023, Stats NZ updated the 2018 standard for geographical areas with the new NZ Statistical standard for geographic areas 2023. While similar, the new standard has added a new geographical area (SA3), has upgraded Wānaka to a medium urban area, seven rural settlements to small urban areas and has created thirteen new rural settlements.

<text>Qa&#x27;a (also Qáa or Ka&#x27;a) (literal meaning: &quot;his arm is raised&quot;) was the last king of the First Dynasty of Egypt. He reigned for 33 years at the end of the 30th century BC.

== Identity ==

Manetho calls Qa&#x27;a Biénechês and gives him a reign of 26 years according to the version preserved by Sextus Julius Africanus. Other versions of copies of Manetho&#x27;s epitomes give other hellenized names such as Óubiênthis for versions by Eusebius and Víbenthis by Armenian versions of Eusebius.

== Family ==

The parents of Qa&#x27;a are unknown, but it is thought that either his predecessor Anedjib or Semerkhet was his father, since it was tradition to leave the throne to the eldest son. If Manetho suggested correctly (remembering the tradition), Semerkhet was the father.

== Reign ==
There is not much known about Qa&#x27;a&#x27;s reign, but it seems that he reigned for a long time (around 33 years). Several stone vessel inscriptions mention a second Sed festival for Qa&#x27;a, which points to at least 33 years of reign. The first festival was usually not celebrated before 30 years of reign, and subsequent festivals could be repeated every third year. The Palermo Stone only mentions the year of coronation and some usual cultic events that were celebrated under every king. The numerous ivory tags dating to his reign also mention only typical arrangements, such as depicting and counting burial offerings and personal possessions of the king. Several mastaba tombs of high officials date into Qa&#x27;a&#x27;s reign: &quot;Merka&quot; (S3505), &quot;Henuka&quot; (burial unknown), &quot;Neferef&quot; (burial also unknown) and &quot;Sabef&quot; (buried in the royal necropolis of Qa&#x27;a).

== End of reign ==
Despite Qa&#x27;a&#x27;s long and prosperous reign, evidence shows that after his death, a dynastic war between different royal houses began over the newly empty throne. In the tomb of the high official &quot;Merka&quot;, a stone vessel with the name of a king Sneferka was found. It is unclear whether &quot;Sneferka&quot; was an alternate name of Qa&#x27;a or if he was a separate, ephemeral ruler. Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck and Toby Wilkinson point to a further mysterious ruler named &quot;Horus Bird&quot;, whose name was found on vessel fragments dating to the end of the first dynasty. It is postulated that Sneferka and Horus Bird fought for power and that Hotepsekhemwy ended the fight and finally ascended the throne of Egypt, thus starting the Second Dynasty. Strong clues to that theory are traces of grave robberies and arsons found in the royal tombs of Abydos. Clay seals of Hotepsekhemwy found in Qa&#x27;a&#x27;s tomb suggest that he restored the tomb or buried Qa&#x27;a, maybe in an attempt to legitimize his rule.

==Attestations from tombs==

Qa&#x27;a had a fairly large tomb in Abydos which measures 98.5 X 75.5 feet or 30 X 23 meters. A long reign is supported by the large size of this ruler&#x27;s burial site at Abydos. This tomb was excavated by German archaeologists in 1993 and proved to contain 26 satellite (i.e. sacrificial) burials. A seal impression bearing Hotepsekhemwy&#x27;s name was found near the entrance of the tomb of Qa&#x27;a (Tomb Q) by the German Archaeological Institute in the mid-1990s. The discovery of the seal impression has been interpreted as evidence that Qa&#x27;a was buried, and therefore succeeded, by Hotepsekhemwy, the founder of the second dynasty of Egypt, as Manetho states. The beautiful tomb stela of Qa&#x27;a is now on display at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

The tomb of one of Qa&#x27;a&#x27;s state officials at Saqqara—a certain nobleman named Merka—contained a stele with many titles. There is a second Sed festival attested. This fact plus the high quality of a number of royal steles depicting the king implies that Qa&#x27;a&#x27;s reign was a fairly stable and prosperous period of time.

A number of year labels have also been discovered dating to his reign at the First Dynasty burial site of Umm el-Qa&#x27;ab in Abydos. Qa&#x27;a is believed to have ruled Egypt around 2916 BCE. A dish inscribed with the name and titles of Qa&#x27;a was discovered in the tomb of second dynasty pharaoh Seth-Peribsen (Tomb P of Petrie).

<text>The title of oldest town in Britain is claimed by a number of settlements in Great Britain.

==Abingdon==
Abingdon in the English county of Oxfordshire (historically Berkshire) claims to be the oldest town in Britain in &quot;continuous settlement&quot;. Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age remains have been found in and around the town, and evidence of a late-Iron Age enclosure of 33 hectares known as an &#x27;oppidum&#x27; was discovered underneath the town centre in 1991. It continued to be used as a town throughout the Roman occupation of Britain and subsequently became a Saxon settlement, named Sevekesham (or Seovechesham) at a time when most other Roman cities were being abandoned. Abingdon Abbey which gave the town its present name was founded in the seventh century.

==Amesbury==
Amesbury along with Stonehenge in Wiltshire is claimed to be Britain&#x27;s oldest settlement, dating back to 8820 BC according to a project led by the University of Buckingham. The place is said to have been a transport point with the River Avon acting as a transit route. Evidence of frogs&#x27; legs being eaten as well as 31,000 flints and animal bones have also been found.

==Colchester==

Colchester claims to be Britain&#x27;s oldest &quot;recorded&quot; town. However as of 2019 (possibly pre-empting its grant of city status in 2022) it has begun claiming the title of &quot;Britain&#x27;s First City&quot;. Its claim is based on a reference by Pliny the Elder, the Roman writer, in his &quot;Natural History&quot; (&quot;Historia Naturalis&quot;) in 77 AD. He described Anglesey as &quot;about from Camulodunum, a town in Britain&quot;, where Camulodunum was the Roman name for Colchester. It is claimed that this is the first known reference to any named settlement in Britain, although coins minted by Tasciovanus mention the Celtic name of the settlement, &quot;Camulodunon&quot;, as early as 20-10 BC.

Archaeological evidence near Colchester has been dated to the Palaeolithic, with flint tools including at least six Acheulian handaxes having been discovered, from the Mesolithic, the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. In the 1980s, an inventory showed that over 800 pieces of Neolithic and Bronze Age pottery have been found within the town, as well as many examples of worked flint. However the origins of the town lie in the Celtic tribal capital of &quot;Camulodunon&quot;, which was in existence from at least the first century BC under Addedomarus. Later, under the Celtic warlords Cunobelin and Caratacus in the first century AD, it became the most powerful Celtic kingdom in Britain. In 43 AD, the settlement was conquered by the Roman Empire under Emperor Claudius, who led the attack in person, building a legionary fortress on the site, the first in Britain. This was converted into the town of Colonia Victricensis in 49 AD, becoming the provincial capital and the only pre-Boudican town to have the honour of Roman citizenship. Its town walls, constructed between 61 AD and 80 AD, are the oldest Roman town walls in Britain by at least 150 years. The town was home to a large classical temple, two theatres (including Britain&#x27;s largest), several Romano-British temples, Britain&#x27;s only known chariot circus, Britain&#x27;s first town walls, several large cemeteries and over 50 known mosaics and was home to around 30,000 people. The town is mentioned by name several times by Roman authors, including in Ptolemy&#x27;s Geography, Tacitus&#x27;s Annales, The Antonine Itinerary and the Ravenna Cosmography, as well as on monuments such as the tomb inscription for Gnaeus Munatius Aurelius Bassus in Rome, which mentions his time in the town as a census-officer for the Roman population. There is much evidence of activity in Colchester until the early fifth century AD, after which it becomes more scarce. Although there are scattered settlement sites, burials and artefacts in Colchester from between the fifth and ninth centuries AD there is a debate over whether it could be called a “town” in this period (see ). Aside from a ninth-century reference by Nennius to a &quot;Caer Colun&quot;, the first time Colchester is explicitly mentioned in &quot;written&quot; accounts is an entry for 917 AD in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, when it is recorded that King Edward the Elder led a Saxon army from Surrey, Kent and Essex to recapture the town from a Danish army that had been encamped there since the mid to late ninth century.

==Ipswich==

The claim of Ipswich, the county town of the English county of Suffolk, is to be the &#x27;oldest English town&#x27;, and is made in a quite specific sense. Within the Borough boundaries of modern Ipswich, and in its vicinity, there is plentiful evidence of Lower Palaeolithic and Upper Palaeolithic, Neolithic, other prehistoric, Roman and Migration Age occupation. But the claim of Ipswich is grounded upon the fact that it never was an Iron Age or Romano-British town, but at its core was and is the oldest still continuing town to have been established and developed by the English. It has an unbroken history of community as a town since early Anglo-Saxon times.

In this claim,
*by &#x27;oldest&#x27; is meant &#x27;first originated or established&#x27;, and also &#x27;still continuing and existing on that site&#x27;:
*by &#x27;English&#x27; is meant &#x27;established (as a town) and occupied by peoples collectively identified by their use of the Old English language&#x27; (subsuming the various migrant and native peoples who coalesced in the area now called England during the 5th to 7th centuries): 
*by &#x27;town&#x27; is meant, originating as a densely-occupied non-rural community comprising a full range of specialized trades and occupations, with its own industrial and domestic components, serviced by a market-place and forming a centre for mercantile activity, provisioned externally from its hinterland, and so necessarily having had some form of local governance or official organization: a town-like component related economically and politically to a wider region of agrarian occupation under a single power or collective identity.

During the Migration age Germanic customs, the roots of the English language and the distinctive industrial arts and construction techniques of the northern continent were transplanted into eastern Britain. Industrial activity ceased to follow Roman models of organized provincial distribution, but (in the absence of a money currency) reflected more localized needs, or else communications between grand households and patrons. The emergence of regional powers and kingdoms was accompanied by the growth of Emporia, or regional trading-centres for the production, import and export of goods, with attendant service communities. Ipswich (Gipeswic, Yepiswyche, etc.) (in the historic Kingdom of East Anglia) is thought to have been comparable to early &quot;Hamwic&quot;, a forerunner of modern Southampton (in the historic Kingdom of Wessex), emerging as a primary community serving the kingdom&#x27;s trade activity towards the Rhine (comparably to Dorestad) through the 7th and 8th centuries, as Hamwih served the north French sea routes to Quentovic.

Modern Southampton however did not develop with the site of Hamwih as its centre. In Ipswich it has been shown that ancient routes linked the 7th century quayside, river-crossing and early market and pottery-making areas, which grew rapidly, enclosing a burial-ground in their midst. In the 8th century a planned grid of streets grew up over the cemetery site between the older roads, uniting the expanding districts. Dense Middle-Saxon structures fronted directly onto the made-up streets. The Viking Age ramparts erected around 900 A.D. enclosed some 52 hectares of settlement but fell well within the area already developed. In the same period a new more spacious reconstruction occurred upon the same grid, with cellared houses and surrounding yards. These streets remain the principal streets and lanes of modern Ipswich, and it is not thought that the community has ever been abandoned or deserted.

The &#x27;city&#x27; denomination of both London and York rests partly upon the importance of their Roman antecedents, and as two of the principal seats of Christian bishops in late Roman Britain. Gildas stated that trade was busy in London in his time (540s), and in the 7th century it was focused at the Anglo-Saxon centre of Aldwych. But neither these, nor anything that has been shown from the ruins of the abandoned Roman Colonia of Colchester, can be taken to represent the formation of a new township along distinctively early English principles. Ipswich makes that claim. Ipswich is also the birthplace of the Jeshua Joshua King of the East Anglians, who reigned between 450-498 Although this is disputed due to the lack of evidence to support this.

==Thatcham==

Thatcham in Berkshire is often said to be the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in Britain, since its occupation can be traced back to a mesolithic hunting camp, which was discovered there beside a Post-glacial rebound period lake, and there is evidence of human occupation within and around Thatcham covering the past 13,000 years or more.

There is strong evidence to support the case that people settled in Thatcham in the Mesolithic Age (10,000 BC – 4,000 BC). Thatcham has strong evidence that it was settled by the Romans, then Saxons, and was mentioned in the Domesday Book. Subsequently, it received medieval charters.

Thatcham has a place in the 1990 Guinness World Records as being the strongest claimant to the longest continually inhabited settlement in the UK. It is mentioned in the 1993 Guinness World Records book as an example of a place with early prehistoric occupation with a comment on the difficulty of showing continuous habitation.

<doc id="607850" wikidata="Q4705893" url="?curid=607850" title="Alamein Kopu">
<text>Manu Alamein Kopu (1943 – 4 December 2011) was a New Zealand politician.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Kopu was raised in Ōpōtiki, Kopu was the seventh in a family of twenty children. Her family was not wealthy, and Kopu characterised her youth as containing &quot;much hardship&quot;. In 1978, her family moved to Sydney, Australia. 

In Australia, Kopu worked in community programmes aimed at drug addicts and prostitutes at a crisis centre in Kings Cross, New South Wales. She continued this line of work after arriving back in New Zealand in 1986, working with Betty Wark at the Aroha Society. Kopu also had considerable involvement in rehabilitation programmes for criminals acting as house parents for long term prison inmates after their release.

===Political career===

In addition to her rehabilitation work, Kopu was also involved in various Māori cultural and educational programs. She quickly joined Mana Motuhake, a political party based around promoting Māori interests and welfare. When Mana Motuhake joined with several other groups to establish the Alliance, Kopu became involved in the new organisation. In the 1993 election, she stood as its candidate in Eastern Maori, but was unsuccessful. In the 1996 election, the first to be conducted under the new MMP system, Kopu contested the Te Tai Rawhiti seat, essentially a reconfigured Eastern Maori. She was also ranked twelfth on the Alliance list. While she did not win Te Tai Rawhiti, the Alliance received enough votes for Kopu to enter parliament as a list MP. In parliament she was an Alliance spokesperson on Māori affairs, women and youth.
Kopu gradually came under increasing criticism. She had been unemployed for nearly two decades prior to her lucrative election as an MP. She was also seen as having been elected in a &#x27;backdoor&#x27; manner; Mana Mohutake leader Sandra Lee had threatened to resign if the Alliance did not include Kopu in a high place on the party list. This was compounded by her apparent lack of participation – many Alliance colleagues complained that she was rarely seen in Parliament, and believed that she was not doing sufficient work. She claimed her disengagement was a perception that she was being left out of Alliance decision making. Other causes of criticism stemmed from internal tensions between different factions of Mana Motuhake. Kopu resented the criticism, and voiced the possibility of leaving the Alliance. Party leader Jim Anderton and party president Matt McCarten sought a meeting to address Kopu&#x27;s concerns, wishing her to remain in the party, but just before the scheduled meeting with them Kopu gave an interview on &quot;Māori News&quot; stating she was leaving the Alliance to form her own party. 

In July 1997, Kopu finally resigned from the Alliance. In a televised statement, she refused to speak English, but only spoke Maori. She blamed racist discrimination for her predicament, going as far as stating that &quot;apartheid is alive and well in New Zealand&quot;. When parliamentary services entered her electorate office it was missing furniture earlier allocated to her. The police carried out an investigation and recovered the missing material. No charges were laid against Kopu.

The issue was also of particular relevance since had been elected to parliament by virtue of her position on the Alliance list, not through any votes she had received personally. As such, many believed that Kopu had no right to remain in parliament. Moreover, Kopu (like all other Alliance MPs) had previously signed a pledge affirming that if she ever left the party, she would resign from parliament. Kopu had, in fact, reaffirmed this pledge only a few days before she quit. The leader of the Alliance, Anderton, said that Kopu&#x27;s actions &quot;breach[ed] every standard of morality and ethics that are known&quot;.

Kopu defended her decision by saying that she was only doing what was best for Māori. Upon leaving the Alliance, she also received strong support from several other Māori MPs, notably Tau Henare of the New Zealand First party. Henare, who had often criticised the Alliance&#x27;s (and Mana Motuhake&#x27;s) approach to Māori affairs, said that Kopu was welcome to join New Zealand First, although this was later rejected by other members of the party. Kopu quickly aligned herself with the governing coalition.

A hearing of parliament&#x27;s privileges committee found that Kopu had not resigned from parliament, and that her pledge to the Alliance did not constitute a constructive resignation. The dispute ultimately led to the introduction of the Electoral Integrity Act (2001), which – for four years – prevented what became known as waka jumping.

==== Mana Wahine ====
After spending some time as an independent, Kopu decided to establish her own political party, Mana Wahine Te Ira Tangata. When she launched the party in October 1997, Kopu claimed to have 6,000 members. The party was ostensibly based on promoting the welfare of Māori women. Many of Kopu&#x27;s critics, however, claimed that the party was established primarily to ensure Kopu received more generous parliamentary funding. As a party leader rather than an independent, Kopu was eligible for an additional $80,000 in funding. Mana Wahine became significant when, in 1999, the governing National Party was with a precarious majority when its coalition with New Zealand First collapsed. National needed as much support as it could find, and managed to obtain Kopu&#x27;s backing along with that of several former New Zealand First MPs.

In the 1999 election, Kopu stood as her party&#x27;s candidate in the Waiariki electorate. Eleven other Mana Wahine candidates also stood. The party had also intended to submit a party list, but Kopu failed to submit it before the deadline – stating herself that she missed the deadline by mere minutes. This eliminated the possibility of Kopu remaining in parliament as a list MP – she would need to win her electorate race in order to remain in parliament. In the election, however, Kopu won only 1.7% of the vote in Waiariki, placing sixth. Moreover, Mana Wahine candidates only won 1,082 votes nationwide, nowhere near enough for Kopu to be returned as a list MP in any case. Following this loss, she left politics permanently, and the party was dissolved in 2001.

==Personal life==
Kopu was married with six children and (as of 1996) thirteen grandchildren. Her husband had been long term unemployed since 1990.

===Death===
Kopu died in Rotorua on 4 December 2011.

<text>Carrauntoohil, Carrauntoohill or Carrantuohill ( ; , meaning &quot;Tuathal&#x27;s sickle&quot;) is the highest mountain in Ireland at . It is on the Iveragh Peninsula in County Kerry, close to the centre of Ireland&#x27;s highest mountain range, MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks. Carrauntoohil is composed mainly of sandstone, whose glaciation produced distinctive features on the mountain such as the Eagle&#x27;s Nest corrie and some deep gullies and sharp arêtes in its east and northeastern faces that are popular with rock and winter climbers.

As Ireland&#x27;s highest mountain, Carrauntoohil is popular with mountain walkers, who most commonly ascend via the Devil&#x27;s Ladder route; however, Carrauntoohil is also climbed as part of longer mountain walking routes in the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks range, including the Coomloughra Horseshoe or the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks Ridge Walk of the entire mountain range. Carrauntoohil, and most of the range is held in private ownership and is not part of any Irish national park; however, reasonable access is granted to the public for recreational use.

==Geology==
Carrauntoohil is composed of sandstone particles of various sizes which are collectively known as Old Red Sandstone. Old Red Sandstone has a purple-reddish colour (stained green in places), and has virtually no fossils; it dates from the Devonian period (410 to 350 million years ago) when Ireland was in a hot equatorial climate. The sedimentary rocks of the Iveragh Peninsula are composed of three layers that are up to thick (in ascending order): Lough Acoose Formation, Chloritic Sandstone Formation, and the Ballinskelligs Sandstone Formation.

Carrauntoohil was later subject to significant glaciation during the last ice age, the result of which is deep fracturing of the rock, and the surrounding of Carrauntoohil by U-shaped valleys, sharp arêtes, and deep corries.

==Geography==
Carrauntoohil is the central peak of the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks range, and has three major ridges. A narrow rocky ridge, or arête, to the north, known as the Beenkeragh Ridge, contains the summit of The Bones (&quot;Na Cnámha&quot;), and leads to Ireland&#x27;s second-highest peak, Beenkeragh (&quot;Binn Chaorach&quot;) at . The ridge westward, called the Caher Ridge, also an arête, leads to Ireland&#x27;s third-highest peak, Caher at . A third and much wider unnamed south-easterly ridge, or spur, leads down to a col where sits the top of the Devil&#x27;s Ladder (the classic access route for Carrauntoohil from the Hag&#x27;s Glen), but then rises back up to Cnoc na Toinne , from which the long easterly ridge section of MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks is accessed.

Carrauntoohil overlooks three U-shaped valleys, each of which containing their own lakes. To the east of Carrauntoohil is the Hag&#x27;s Glen (), to the west is Coomloughra (), and to the south is Curragh More ().

Carrauntoohil has a deep corrie, known as the Eagle&#x27;s Nest, at its north-east face, which is accessed from the Hag&#x27;s Glen, and rises up through three levels. At the top, the third level, is Lough Cummeenoughter, Ireland&#x27;s highest lake. The Eagle&#x27;s Nest gives views of the gullies on Carrauntoohil&#x27;s north-east face: Curved Gully, Central Gully, and Brother O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s Gully. Sometimes the term Eagle&#x27;s Nest is used to refer to the small stone Mountain Rescue Hut that sits on the first level of the corrie, where the Heavenly Gates descent gully meets the Eagle&#x27;s Nest corrie.

Carrauntoohil is the highest mountain in Ireland on all classification scales. It is the 133rd-highest mountain, and 4th most prominent mountain, in Britain and Ireland, on the Simms classification. Carrauntoohil is regarded by the Scottish Mountaineering Club (SMC) as one of 34 Furths, which are defined as mountains above in elevation and meeting the SMC criteria for a Munro (i.e. &quot;sufficient separation&quot;), and which are outside (or &quot;furth&quot;), of Scotland; this is why Carrauntoohil is also referred to as one of the thirteen Irish Munros.

Carrauntoohil&#x27;s larger prominence qualifies it to meet the P600 classification and the Britain and Ireland Marilyn classification. Carrauntoohil is the highest mountain in the MountainViews Online Database, &quot;100 Highest Irish Mountains&quot;.

==Summit==
In the 1950s, a wooden cross was erected on the summit, a privately owned commonage, by the local community. In 1976, the wooden cross was replaced by a steel cross. In 2014, the cross was cut down by unknown persons, who filmed the felling and said it was in protest against the Catholic Church. It was re-erected shortly after.

Because of the dangers of the steep north-eastern and eastern faces of Carrauntoohil, the Kerry Mountain Rescue Team (KMRT) have placed danger signs on the summit, and particularly above the Howling Ridge sector (the ridge between the north-east and east faces), whose initial section can be mistaken for a hill-walkers descent route.

==Naming==

&quot;Carrauntoohil&quot; is the most common and official spelling of the name, being the only version in use by Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Placenames Database of Ireland, and by Irish academic Paul Tempan, compiler of the &quot;Irish Hill and Mountain Names&quot; database (2010). &quot;Carrauntoohill&quot; has also been used in the past, for example by Irish historian Patrick Weston Joyce in 1870. Other less common spelling variations have included &quot;Carrantoohil&quot;, &quot;Carrantouhil&quot;, &quot;Carrauntouhil&quot; and &quot;Carrantuohill&quot;; all of which are anglicisations of the same Irish-language name.

Paul Tempan&#x27;s &quot;Irish Hill and Mountain Names&quot; notes that Carrauntoohil&#x27;s Irish name &quot;is shrouded in uncertainty&quot;, and that &quot;Unlike some lesser peaks, such as Mangerton or Croagh Patrick, it is not mentioned in any surviving early Irish texts&quot;. The official Irish name is , which Tempan notes is interpreted as &quot;Tuathal&#x27;s sickle&quot;, Tuathal being a male first name. Patrick Weston Joyce previously interpreted it as &quot;inverted sickle&quot;, translating from the Irish language term meaning left-handed but according to PWJ, &quot;is applied to everything reversed from its proper direction&quot;. From yet another perspective, one of the earliest written accounts of the mountain by Isaac Weld in 1812, calls it &quot;Gheraun-Tuel&quot;, and Samuel Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot; (1837) calls it &quot;Garran Tual&quot;; suggesting the first element was (&#x27;fang&#x27;)—which is found in the names of other Kerry mountains—and that the earlier name may have been (&#x27;Tuathal&#x27;s fang&#x27;).

==Ownership==

The climber and author Jim Ryan noted in his 2006 book &quot;Carrauntoohil and MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks&quot; that the actual mountain of Carrauntoohil, including most of the Hag&#x27;s Glen, is in private ownership. The freehold is owned by four families: Donal Doona, John O&#x27;Shea, John B. Doona, and James Sullivan. Their great-grandfathers bought the land from the Irish Land Commission, &quot;paying the sum of eleven shillings and two pence (€0.70 in today&#x27;s money), twice a year for many decades&quot;. Ryan&#x27;s book commended the owners for providing access over the years, despite damage to their farms.

A state-sponsored report into access for the range in December 2013 titled &quot;MacGillycuddy Reeks Mountain Access Development Assessment&quot; (also called the Mountain Access Project, or MAP), mapped the complex network of land titles. Unlike many other national mountain ranges, MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks are not part of a national park or a trust structure, and are instead completely privately owned.

The ownership situation has raised concerns in light of the material rise in visitors to Carrauntoohil (and the range in general), and the erosion and lack of infrastructure that other state-owned sites have been able to address. In 2019 the &quot;Irish Times&quot; reported that the MacGillycuddy Reeks Mountain Access Forum, a cross-body group of landowners, commercial users and public access and walking groups set up in 2014 with the aim of &quot;protecting, managing and sustainably developing the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks mountain range, while halting and reversing the obvious and worsening path erosion&quot;, had achieved some success laying down new pathways in the Hag&#x27;s Glen approach to Carrauntoohil; however, the &quot;Irish Times&quot; still wondered, &quot;Should the Kerry reeks be a national park?&quot;

==Recreation==

===Visitors===

Separate statistics do not exist for visitors or ascensions of the stand-alone peak of Carrauntoohil; however, it was recorded that over 125,000 accessed the range in 2017, and 140,000 accessed the range in 2018, the majority of which are related to Carrauntoohil. The attraction of the mountain has led to many accidents and fatalities over the years, and by the 50th anniversary of the KMRT in 2017, they recorded having attended more than 40 fatalities in the range, noting that many were &quot;in the immediate Carrauntoohil area&quot;. Accidents on the mountain have been attributed to bad weather, late departures combined with darkness on the way down and falling rocks in eroded areas.

===Mountain walking===

The straightforward route is via the Devil&#x27;s Ladder, which starts at Cronin&#x27;s Yard () in the north-east, moves into the Hag&#x27;s Glen, continues along between Lough Gouragh and Lough Calee, until the Devil&#x27;s Ladder, a worn path from the glen to the col between Carrauntoohil and Cnoc na Toinne is visible. No special climbing equipment is needed, but caution is advised as the Devil&#x27;s Ladder has become unstable with overuse; alternatives to the ladder include the Bothar na Gige Zig Zag track (the north-east spur of Cnoc na Toinne ). The full route back to Cronin&#x27;s Yard is and takes 4–5 hours.

Other popular, but more serious, routes to Carrauntoohil from the Hag&#x27;s Glen are via the Hag&#x27;s Tooth Ridge up to Beenkeragh, and then across the Beenkeragh Ridge to Carrauntoohil; or via the Eagle&#x27;s Nest route to Lough Cummeenoughter, Ireland&#x27;s highest lake, and up to the summit via Brother O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s Gully or Curved Gully.

Instead of descending via the Devil&#x27;s Ladder, some climbers use a route known as the Heavenly Gates, which starts above the col of the Devil&#x27;s Ladder but takes a small stone path that cuts across the east-face of Carrauntoohil, through a narrow gap, known as the Heavenly Gates (see photo), and then heads diagonally down a deep gully to the base of the first level of the Eagle&#x27;s Nest corrie, where the Mountain Rescue Hut is situated. This route, however, is hazardous, difficult to find as it is not marked, and particularly dangerous in poor visibility; it has been the source of several serious accidents on Carrauntoohil.

A strenuous undertaking is the Coomloughra Horseshoe, which takes 6–8 hours and is described as &quot;one of Ireland&#x27;s classic ridge walks&quot;. It starts from the north-west up the Hydro-Track (), and is usually done clockwise, first climbing Skregmore , and then to Beenkeragh , across the famous Beenkeragh Ridge, at the centre of which is The Bones , and on to the summit of Carrauntoohil itself. The horseshoe is completed by continuing to Caher , Caher West Top , and descending to the starting point. Carrauntoohil is also climbed as part of the full MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks Ridge Walk, a 12- to 14-hour, traverse of the entire Reeks range.

===Rock and winter climbing===

Although the Reeks are not particularly known for their advanced rock climbing (e.g. unlike Ailladie in Clare, or Fair Head in Antrim), the east face of Carrauntoohil, looking into the Hag&#x27;s Glen, and the north-east face, looking into Brothers O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s Gully, have a number of multi-pitch, mixed route, rock climbing routes. The most well-known is the Howling Ridge (climbing grade Very Difficult, or V-Diff), which starts at the base of the gap of Heavenly Gates, and takes the arête between Carrauntoohil&#x27;s east and north-east faces.

These same east and north-east faces are also used for winter climbing, conditions permitting, and seven routes of climbing grade V are marked amongst almost eighty routes in total.

<doc id="607864" wikidata="Q7641151" url="?curid=607864" title="Sunrise problem">
<text>The sunrise problem can be expressed as follows: &quot;What is the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow?&quot; The sunrise problem illustrates the difficulty of using probability theory when evaluating the plausibility of statements or beliefs.

According to the Bayesian interpretation of probability, probability theory can be used to evaluate the plausibility of the statement, &quot;The sun will rise tomorrow.&quot;

The sunrise problem was first introduced publicly in 1763 by Richard Price in his famous coverage of Thomas Bayes&#x27; foundational work in Bayesianism.

== Laplace&#x27;s approach ==

Pierre-Simon Laplace, who treated it by means of his rule of succession. Let &quot;p&quot; be the long-run frequency of sunrises, i.e., the sun rises on 100 × &quot;p&quot;% of days. &quot;Prior&quot; to knowing of any sunrises, one is completely ignorant of the value of &quot;p&quot;. Laplace represented this prior ignorance by means of a uniform probability distribution on &quot;p&quot;.

For instance, the probability that &quot;p&quot; is between 20% and 50% is just 30%. This must not be interpreted to mean that in 30% of all cases, &quot;p&quot; is between 20% and 50%. Rather, it means that one&#x27;s state of knowledge (or ignorance) justifies one in being 30% sure that the sun rises between 20% of the time and 50% of the time. &quot;Given&quot; the value of &quot;p&quot;, and no other information relevant to the question of whether the sun will rise tomorrow, the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow is &quot;p&quot;. But we are &quot;not&quot; &quot;given the value of &quot;p&quot;&quot;. What we are given is the observed data: the sun has risen every day on record. Laplace inferred the number of days by saying that the universe was created about 6000 years ago, based on a young-earth creationist reading of the Bible.

To find the conditional probability distribution of &quot;p&quot; given the data, one uses Bayes&#x27; theorem, which some call the &quot;Bayes–Laplace rule&quot;. Having found the conditional probability distribution of &quot;p&quot; given the data, one may then calculate the conditional probability, given the data, that the sun will rise tomorrow. That conditional probability is given by the rule of succession. The plausibility that the sun will rise tomorrow increases with the number of days on which the sun has risen so far. Specifically, assuming &quot;p&quot; has an a-priori distribution that is uniform over the interval [0,1], and that, given the value of &quot;p&quot;, the sun independently rises each day with probability &quot;p&quot;, the desired conditional probability is: 

: formula_1

By this formula, if one has observed the sun rising 10000 times previously, the probability it rises the next day is formula_2. Expressed as a percentage, this is approximately a formula_3 chance.

However, Laplace recognized this to be a misapplication of the rule of succession through not taking into account all the prior information available immediately after deriving the result:

E.T. Jaynes noted that Laplace&#x27;s warning had gone unheeded by workers in the field.

A reference class problem arises: the plausibility inferred will depend on whether we take the past experience of one person, of humanity, or of the earth. A consequence is that each referent would hold different plausibility of the statement. In Bayesianism, any probability is a conditional probability given what one knows. That varies from one person to another.

<doc id="607882" wikidata="Q832297" url="?curid=607882" title="Bette Davis Eyes">
<text>&quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; is a song written and composed by Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon in 1974. It was recorded by DeShannon that year but made popular by Kim Carnes in 1981 when it spent nine non-consecutive weeks at the top of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It won the 1982 Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Record of the Year. The music video was directed by Australian film director Russell Mulcahy.

On the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the song was No. 1 for five weeks, interrupted for just one week by &quot;Stars on 45&quot; before it returned to the top spot for another four weeks, becoming &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s biggest hit of the year. The single also reached No. 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Tracks charts and No. 26 on the Dance charts. It reached No. 2 in Canada for twelve consecutive weeks, and was 1981&#x27;s No. 2 hit in that country, after &quot;Stars on 45&quot;. It peaked at No. 10 in the United Kingdom, to date Carnes&#x27;s only Top 40 hit in that country. Additionally, it ranked No. 12 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s list of the top 100 songs in the first 50 years of the magazine&#x27;s Hot 100. &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; was a No. 1 hit in 21 countries.

==Background==

&quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; was written in 1974 by Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon, the latter of whom recorded the song that same year for her album &quot;New Arrangement&quot;. Weiss had traveled to DeShannon&#x27;s house with a set of lyrics, including several additional verses that were ultimately scrapped. DeShannon refined some of the lyrics and also developed the song&#x27;s music. In this original incarnation, the track is performed in an &quot;R&amp;B lite&quot; arrangement, featuring a prominent uptempo piano part, as well as flourishes of pedal steel guitar and horns. However, it was not until March 1981, when Carnes recorded her version of the song in a radically different synthesizer-based arrangement, that it became a commercial success.

According to producer Val Garay, the original demo of the tune that was brought to him sounded like &quot;a Leon Russell track, with this beer-barrel polka piano part.&quot; Carnes initially rejected the song based on the demo&#x27;s arrangement, until keyboardist Bill Cuomo, using the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 synthesizer, came up with the signature riff which defines Carnes&#x27;s version. In an interview with Dick Clark on the &quot;National Music Survey&quot;, Carnes credited Cuomo with the song&#x27;s new arrangement, saying that &quot;the minute he came up with that, then it fell into place. Everybody went, &#x27;That&#x27;s it!&#x27;&quot;

Only three takes were recorded, the first of which was used with no overdubbing. Craig Krampf insisted on incorporating a Synare electronic drum into the song, although Garay objected to the instrument&#x27;s inclusion on the grounds that it was &quot;the most annoying thing I&#x27;d ever heard in my life.&quot; However, Garay changed his mind once Krampf hit the instrument on the chorus, which Garay believed was a great fit. The drums were miked at close proximity with a Sennheiser MD 421 on the bass drum, a Shure 56 and Sennheiser MD 441 on the snare drum, Telefunken 251s on the toms, and an AKG 452 on the hi-hat. Carnes sang her vocals through a Neumann U67 microphone situated next to the mixing console.

Actress Bette Davis was 73 when Carnes&#x27;s version became a hit. She wrote letters to Carnes, Weiss, and DeShannon to thank them for making her &quot;a part of modern times&quot; and said that her grandson now looked up to her. After their Grammy wins, Davis sent them roses and happily accepted the gift of gold and platinum records from Carnes, hanging them on her wall.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Record World&quot; called it a &quot;haunting pop-rocker&quot; and said that Carnes&#x27;s &quot;earthy vocal rasp and guitar chimes are unforgettable.&quot; Joe Viglione of AllMusic believed that &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; was superior to all other tracks on &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;.

American actress Gwyneth Paltrow covered &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; for the soundtrack for the 2000 road trip film &quot;Duets&quot;. This version was released as a single in Australia on March 26, 2001, debuting and peaking at No. 3 on the ARIA Singles Chart on April 8, 2001. It spent nine weeks in the top 10, and came in at No. 35 on Australia&#x27;s year-end chart for 2001.

=== Taylor Swift live performance ===
American singer Taylor Swift included a live performance cover of &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; on her 2011 &quot;Speak Now World Tour – Live&quot; album.

== In popular media ==
Kim Carnes&#x27; version of the song has appeared in various films and TV series including &quot;200 Cigarettes&quot; (1999), &quot;Cold Case&quot; S1E6 (2003), &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; (2012) &quot;The Final Girls&quot; (2015), &quot;American Horror Story&quot; S5E5 (2015), &quot;Riverdale&quot; S2E18 (2018), &quot;The After Party&quot; (2018), &quot;Anaïs in Love&quot; (2021), &quot;The Tourist&quot; S1E1 (2022), &quot;Angelyne&quot; S1E3 (2022) and &quot;MaXXXine&quot; (2024).

The song is a major plot element of the second season episode 9, &quot;Invasion of the Potty Snatchers&quot;, of the show &quot;Bless the Harts&quot;, in which the character of Betty Hart reminisces about a high point of her high school time, in which she received public acclaim for singing the song; Maya Rudolph&#x27;s rendition of the song in the episode has been called &quot;a highlight of the season thus far&quot;.

The song was parodied in the October 10, 1981 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the sketch &quot;Buh-Weet Sings&quot;, when Buckwheat (Eddie Murphy) sings the song so incomprehensibly that the subtitles read &quot;?????&quot;.

The 1986 single &quot;Dickie Davies Eyes&quot; by the band Half Man Half Biscuit parodies the song title - Dickie Davies was a British television presenter, notably presenting &quot;World of Sport&quot; from the 1970s.

<doc id="607886" wikidata="Q1026492" url="?curid=607886" title="Haast, New Zealand">
<text>Haast is a small town in the Westland District on the West Coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. The township is beside the Haast River, south of Haast Junction, on State Highway 6. The Haast region is in Te Wahipounamu – The South West New Zealand World Heritage, a UNESCO World Heritage Site designated in 1990.

== Toponymy ==
The township, the major river that is close to the town, a gorge on the river and the pass across to the eastern side of the Southern Alps are all named after Julius von Haast, a Prussian-born geologist who travelled through the area in 1863. Although the prospector Charles Cameron is said to be the first European to ‘discover’ the pass, Haast was recognised by having the town named after him.

==History==

The main Māori settlement in the area was the pā at the mouth of the Arawhata River.

The Haast area was extensively used by Māori as a key source of pounamu. Their main route from inland was called . 

Ngāi Tahu occupation of the land was ended by attacks by North Island tribes. In 1836, the Ngāti Tama chief Te Pūoho led a 100-person war party, armed with muskets, down the West Coast and over the Haast Pass. He ambushed a Ngāi Tahu encampment between Lake Wānaka and Lake Hāwea, then went south past Lake Wakatipu. His raid ended in Southland where he was killed and his war party destroyed by the southern Ngāi Tahu leader Tūhawaiki.

European settlement of the area dates back to the 1860s. The remoteness of the area initially limited access to seagoing vessels, with some rough tracks from the north and east.

Early European explorers searched for the Māori routes to cross from the eastern to the western sides of the South Island and back again, having learnt of the pass when Huruhuru drew a map for the explorer Edward Shortland in 1844. The first European ascent was from the Wānaka side in March 1861, when the exploring surveyor John Holland Baker, seeking new sheep country, looked down from the saddle towards the West Coast. Gold prospector Charles Cameron claimed to have made the first crossing to the coast in 1863; however he was widely believed to have only got to the upper reaches of the Haast River / Awarua. 

The honour of first official crossing was claimed by Julius von Haast, Canterbury&#x27;s provincial geologist, who led a five-man expedition in January 1863. He named the Haast River after himself, &quot;directed, so he said, by his provincial superindendent&quot;, and returned to Lake Wānaka &quot;nearly shoeless&quot; after six weeks.

Haast&#x27;s party travelled up the headwaters of the Makarora River. On 23 January they reached the open, boggy summit of the pass, which was surrounded by beech forest. Haast made a watercolour which was used to illustrate a later report. The party then crossed the pass and travelled downstream to the coast, which they reached on 20 February.

The present Haast township was originally a New Zealand Ministry of Works road construction camp, which expanded into a permanent township when the opening of the Haast Pass in 1962 made the region more accessible. The road through the pass to Wānaka was upgraded in 1966.

In 1990 the Haast area was included as part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, giving international recognition to a region of significant natural value, named as Te Wahipounamu – The South West New Zealand World Heritage Area.

== Geography ==

=== Setting ===
The Haast township is located on the Haast River, approximately south of Haast Junction, on State Highway 6. The Haast River () is 100 kilometres (62 mi) in length, and enters the Tasman Sea near the Haast township. It drains the western watershed of the Haast Pass, and passes through a gorge known as the Gates of Haast.

The New Zealand Department of Conservation operates a visitor centre in Haast Junction, on the southwest bank of the Haast River, immediately south of the Haast Bridge, at the junction of State Highway 6 and the Haast–Jackson Bay Road. The visitor centre offers a wide range of information about the surrounding area.

Lake Moeraki is to the northeast, and the Haast Pass is to the southeast by road. The settlement of Okuru is located on the coast south-west of Haast.

The small settlement of Haast Beach is on the coast of the Tasman Sea, approximately west southwest of Haast Junction, on the road to Jackson Bay.

=== Climate ===
Haast holds the distinction of being the wettest town in New Zealand.

== Biodiversity ==
The Haast tokoeka is one of the rarest subspecies of kiwi, with more than half the known population living in an actively managed area of the Haast ranges.

== Economy ==
The main economic activities in the Haast region are farming, fishing and tourism.

== Infrastructure ==
The Haast area is not connected to the national electricity grid. New Zealand Energy operates an electricity distribution network supplying the town. Electricity is generated by an 800-kilowatt hydroelectric scheme on the Turnbull River, constructed in 1972. The scheme is backed up by a 375-kilowatt diesel generator. In 2023, the company applied for consent to build a second hydro power station on the Turnbull River.

Haast received mobile coverage in May 2018. 3G mobile coverage is provided for all three mobile networks within a radius of Haast township. Fibre broadband became available in the township in 2022.

==Education==
The Haast School is a coeducational full primary (years 1–8) school with a student roll of as of The school opened in the 1890s and is the most isolated school in the mainland of New Zealand.

There are no secondary schools in the Haast area. The nearest is Mount Aspiring College, 140 kilometres (85 mi) away over the Haast Pass in Wānaka, too far away to be practical. Most secondary students board at schools in Alexandra, Oamaru or Dunedin.

<text>The Junkers Ju 86 is a monoplane bomber and civilian airliner designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Junkers.

It was designed during the mid-1930s in response to a specification for a modern twin-engined aircraft suitable for use as both a high-speed airliner and a bomber. Junkers responded with a low-winged twin-engined all-metal monoplane; unusually, it was intended to be powered by Junkers Jumo 205 diesel engines instead of petrol engines for greater fuel efficiency. It also had a smooth metal skin instead of the company&#x27;s traditional corrugated exterior. On bomber-configured aircraft, bombs were carried vertically in four fuselage cells behind the cockpit; these bomb cells were replaced by seating for up to ten passengers on the civil airliner version of the Ju 86. On 4 November 1934, the first prototype, powered by Siemens SAM 22 radial engines, made its maiden flight; on 4 April 1935, the third prototype, which was the first civil-configured aircraft, flew for the first time.

The civil-oriented Ju 86 models were operated by a range of airlines, including the German flag carrier Deutsche Luft Hansa, Manchukuo National Airways, South African Airways, Iberia Airlines and AB Aerotransport amongst others. Some civilian aircraft would be converted into military aircraft following the outbreak of the Second World War. The type was employed by various air forces on both sides of the conflict, although the first military use of the Ju 86 was during the Spanish Civil War, where it was flown by the Condor Legion with mixed results. The Luftwaffe deployed its Ju 86s during the invasion of Poland, but opted to withdraw its diesel-engined aircraft fairly promptly while the radial-engined Ju 86 models were predominantly assigned to training roles thereafter. During late 1942, Ju 86s, along with all other available transport aircraft, were pulled from training schools to reinforce the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s transport force in its attempt to supply the German 6th Army besieged at Stalingrad, although this attempt was soon ended due to Soviet advances.

The &quot;Ju 86P&quot;, which emerged in early 1940, possessed considerable high altitude performance as a result of its longer wingspan, pressurized cabin, Junkers Jumo 207A-1 turbocharged diesel engines; used as both a bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, it was used as a &quot;nuisance bomber&quot; for a time over England until effective interception by modified Supermarine Spitfires led to its withdrawal. At one point, Junkers was developing the &quot;Ju 86R&quot;, fitted with even larger wings and new engines, to attain even higher altitudes, but this model never progressed beyond the prototype stage. By the twenty-first century, only a single Ju 86 is known to still exist; it is on permanent static display at the Swedish Air Force Museum outside Linköping.

==Design and development==
===Background===
The origins of the Junkers Ju 86 are closely linked to the clandestine build-up of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during the mid-1930s. During 1934, the recently created German &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) and the German flag carrier Deutsche Luft Hansa worked together to produce a specification for a twin use aircraft, capable of operating both as a high-speed airliner for Deutsche Luft Hansa and as a medium bomber for the Luftwaffe. Distinct civil and military variants of the aircraft were sought; however, where the requirements were not fully compatible with one another, it was deemed that military needs took precedence over those of the civil side of the programme.

Two German aircraft manufacturers, Junkers and Heinkel, were both approached regarding this specification; each company received an initial order for five prototypes (three military and two civil) of their designs, these being the Ju 86 and Heinkel He 111 respectively. Junkers&#x27; opted for a low-winged twin-engined monoplane that featured all-metal stressed skin construction. Unlike the majority of Junkers&#x27; previous designs, the Ju 86 discarded the typical corrugated skinning in favour of smooth metal skinning, which helped to reduce drag. It was intended to be powered by Junkers Jumo 205 diesel engines, which although heavy, gave better fuel efficiency than conventional petrol engines. This decision made the Ju 86 one of the earliest quantity production aircraft to use diesel propulsion.

The wing of the Ju 86, which was tapered, comprised two primary spars and one auxiliary spar. It was outfitted with distinctive Junkers control surfaces on the wing, similar to those on the Junkers Ju 52, that were hinged below the wing&#x27;s trailing edge, with the outboard section on each side functioning as an aileron, and the inner section functioning as a wing flap. The aircraft was fitted with a retractable main-gear conventional undercarriage with a fixed tailwheel, and twin fins and rudders. Unusually, the main undercarriage members were attached to the wing roots and outwardly retracted into recesses within the wings; this arrangement meant that the undercarriage had a particularly narrow track.

The bomber aircraft had a crew of four: a pilot, navigator, radio operator/bombardier and gunner. Defensive armament consisted of three machine guns: at the nose, at a dorsal position, and within a retractable ventral position. Bombs were carried vertically in four fuselage cells behind the cockpit. The airliner version replaced these bomb cells with seating for ten passengers; furthermore, the fuel tanks were relocated from the fuselage to the wings.

===Into flight===
As the Jumo 205 was unavailable when the first prototype airframe was completed, the bomber-configured Ju 86ab1 was fitted with Siemens SAM 22 radial engines instead when it performed its maiden flight on 4 November 1934. Early flight trials were reportedly demonstrated the prototype to possess unsatisfactory control and stability; modifications were made. The second prototype, which was also a bomber, flew during January 1935. The third Ju 86, the first civil prototype, flew on 4 April 1935. The fourth and fifth prototypes, which were more representative of production aircraft, were furnished with a new wing design with an increased chord, and thereby wing area, towards the tips.

During late 1935, production of both pre-series military and civil aircraft commenced. In April 1936, full-rate production of the Ju 86A-1 bomber was achieved. Many of the early modifications made were centred around increasing the aircraft&#x27;s stability, such as the addition of a spine-like dorsal fin on the tail end of the fuselage on the Ju 86C. Production was quickly transitioned to the improved Ju 86D, the chief differences of which being a modified tail cone that improved stability and an almost 50 per cent increase in fuel capacity over that of the Ju 86A. During the late 1930s, demand for the type was such that rival firm Henschel became involved in the production program.

Early use of the Jumo-powered Ju 86 bomber in the Spanish Civil War showed that it was inferior to the He 111, with the diesel engines being unsuitable for rough treatment during combat and thus difficult to keep operational. Accordingly, production plans of the type were promptly cut back. One Ju 86 had already been converted to use radial engines as a testbed for possible export versions, and this showed improved reliability. Production switched to a version powered by the BMW 132 engine, the Ju 86E, the production of which continued though to 1938. The sudden end to production without advance warning meant that there were still enough component parts to construct a further 1,000 aircraft.

While the Ju 86 was deemphasised as a bomber as time went on, Junker opted to continue development of the aircraft as a high altitude platform for both reconnaissance and bombing missions. The &quot;Ju 86P&quot;, which possessed a longer wingspan, pressurized cabin, Junkers Jumo 207A-1 turbocharged two-stroke, opposed-piston diesel engines and a two-man crew, could fly higher than 12,000 m (39,000 ft), where it was felt to be safe from enemy fighters. Furthermore, it could be produced by remanufacturing existing Ju 86D airframes.

During early 1942, Junkers was working on the &quot;Ju 86R&quot;, which used even larger wings and new engines that were reportedly capable of even higher altitudes - up to 16,000 m (52,500 ft) - in order to continue evading increasingly advanced interceptors. While a few aircraft were built and delivered to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during 1943, production was limited to a small quantity of aircraft. Further advanced models, such as the Ju 86 R-3 and the Ju 186, but these never left the drawing board.

===Export variants===

Civil variants, introduced in 1936, were designated Ju 86Z in three different models differing in their engines. The Jumo-engined Ju 86Z-1 (corresponding to the former B-0 or C-1) was sold to Swissair (one), Airlines of Australia (one), and LAN-Chile (three). The BMW 132H-powered Ju 86Z-2 was sold to DLH (two) and the para-military Manchukuo Air Transport (five or more). The Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1690 Hornet-engined Ju 86Z-7 was delivered to AB Aerotransport (ABA) of Sweden (one, for use as a mail carrier), Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano (three), and South African Airways (SAA) (seventeen). The ABA aircraft was later transferred to the Swedish Air Force, with which it served, under the designation Tp 9, until 1958. South African Airways&#x27; original intention was to have its Ju 86s powered by 745 hp Rolls-Royce Kestrels. Six aircraft for SAA, flown with these engines, were refitted with Hornets before delivery, and the remainder were also Hornet-powered.

The &quot;Ju 86K&quot; was an export model, also built under license in Sweden by Saab as the B 3 with (905 hp) Bristol Mercury XIX radial engines. Several aircraft remained in service with the Swedish Air Force until 1958. A few were converted for radio interception activities.

==Operational history==
The bomber was field-tested in the Spanish Civil War by the Condor Legion. Four Ju 86D-1s arrived in Spain in early February 1937, but after a few sorties one of them was shot down in late February–early March 1937 by Republican fighters. A replacement aircraft was sent from Germany, but after two more were damaged in landing accidents, the remaining two aircraft were sold to the Nationalist air force, where they remained in service until at least the end of the Civil War. The Ju 86 had proved to be generally inferior to the Heinkel He 111 evaluated at the same time.

A single &quot;Gruppe&quot; of Ju 86 bombers (III KG 1 &quot;Hindenburg&quot;) remained in operational service at the start of the Second World War and were used in the invasion of Poland, but replaced soon after. The diesel-engined Ju 86A and Ds were quickly retired while the radial-engined Ju 86E and Gs were transferred to bomber training schools. Soon after the conflict started, the (Air Fleet) commanders raided their training schools for Ju 52s as transport aircraft, together with their experienced aircrew instructors. This depletion continued with the formation of special bomber crews for the invasions of Norway, the Low Countries, and Crete. This was to a severe blow to the pilot training programme, and Lt-Colonel Paul Deichmann, Chief of Staff to the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Chief of Training Helmuth Wilberg suggested that Ju 86s with dual controls and instruments could be easily produced to replace the appropriated Ju 52s. However, his contention that &quot;the need for air transport services would soon reach tremendous proportions&quot; was simply brushed aside by the commander-in-chief of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, Hermann Göring.

In late 1942, all available aircraft, including Ju 86s, were pulled out of the training schools to reinforce the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s transport force in its attempt to supply the German 6th Army, besieged at Stalingrad. The Ju 86s formed two transport &quot;Gruppen&quot;, equipped with 58 aircraft, operating out of Tatsinskaya Airfield. They were unsuited to the transport role, and suffered heavy losses (42 Ju 86s were lost by the end of January 1943) before being forced out of the airlift when the Soviets captured Tatsinskaya, not having the range to reach Stalingrad from the replacement airfields. More than 40 Ju 86s were lost in this endeavour while the survivors were reallocated to training bomber crews.

Ju 86s operated by the Allies in the Second World War included 17 early-model units that had been in use by South African Airways. When the conflict broke out, these aircraft were militarised and armed as bombers with defensive guns and external bomb racks. These aircraft were initially used for coastal patrols along with the sole Ju 86K-1, playing an important role in the interception of the German blockade runner in December 1939. In May 1940, they were used to re-equip No. 12 Squadron SAAF, which was deployed in the East African Campaign from June 1940. It flew its first bombing missions on 14 June 1940. As more modern aircraft became available, the South African Ju 86s were passed from squadron to squadron, seeing their last use with No. 22 Squadron SAAF, which used it along with the Avro Anson in the coastal reconnaissance role, finally retiring its Ju 86s in September 1942.

During March 1939, Hungary used its Ju 86s to bomb Slovakian airfields and defensive positions during the Slovak–Hungarian War. From June 1941, Hungary&#x27;s Ju 86s began to be replaced by Italian Caproni Ca.135 bombers. An independent bomber squadron, equipped with a mix of Ju 86s and Ca 135s was deployed in support of the Hungarian Gyorshadtest (or Fast Corps) during the German-led invasion of the Soviet Union. However, the Ju 86 was withdrawn from front line service by Hungary during 1942.
In January 1940, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; evaluated the prototype &quot;Ju 86P&quot;, which could fly higher than 12,000 m (39,000 ft), where it was felt to be safe from enemy fighters. The British Westland Welkin and Soviet Yakovlev Yak-9PD were developed specifically to counter this threat. Satisfied with the trials of the Ju 86P prototype, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; ordered that some 40 older-model bombers be converted to &quot;Ju 86P-1&quot; high-altitude bombers and &quot;Ju 86P-2&quot; photo-reconnaissance aircraft, with pressurized fuselage, no armament, and a crew of two.

The Ju 86P operated successfully for some years over Britain, the Soviet Union and North Africa. During early 1941, the reconnaissance version flew sorties over Britain, but these stopped when Hitler invaded Russia (Operation Barbarossa). By mid-1942, the pressurized bomber version was available, and flew about a dozen nuisance raids over southern England. In response, the RAF mounted a special interception squadron equipped with modified Supermarine Spitfire Mk IXs, leading to one bomber attempting a raid on Portsmouth being intercepted on 12 September 1942; after this, no further flights over England were attempted. In August 1942, a modified Spitfire Mk V shot a Ju 86P down over Egypt at an altitude of some 14,500 m (49,000 ft); following the loss of two more aircraft, the Ju 86P was withdrawn from service in 1943.

A single unit operated the &quot;Ju 86R&quot;, which was capable of even greater altitudes than the Ju 86P, between 1943 and mid 1944.

==Surviving aircraft==

Only one Junkers Ju 86 is known to exist today. The aircraft was built in Germany and sold to Sweden in 1938. Before it was retired from Swedish service in 1958, the aircraft was used in the 1955 movie &quot;Des Teufels General&quot;. It is on permanent static display at the Swedish Air Force Museum near Linköping.

<text>The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis is the head of London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Service. Sir Mark Rowley was appointed to the post on 8 July 2022 after Dame Cressida Dick announced her resignation in February 2022.

The rank of Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police is regarded as the highest in British policing. Although authority is generally confined to the Metropolitan Police Service&#x27;s area of operation, the Metropolitan Police District, the Metropolitan Police also has certain national responsibilities such as leading counter-terrorism policing and protection of the royal family and senior members of the government.

The commissioner is directly accountable to the Home Secretary, the Mayor&#x27;s Office for Policing and Crime, and the mayor of London.

==History==
The post of commissioner was created by the Metropolitan Police Act 1829. For the force&#x27;s first ten years, commissioners were known as &quot;justices of the peace of the counties of Middlesex, Surrey, Hertford, Essex, and Kent, and of all the liberties therein&quot;. Section 4 of the Metropolitan Police Act 1839 first gave the post the title of Commissioner, and it was held jointly by two officers until the Metropolitan Police Act 1856 merged these into a single post. The Commissioners were not appointed as sworn constables until the Administration of Justice Act 1973 amended the phrase on justices of the peace in Section 1 of the 1829 Act to &quot;a Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis to execute the duties of chief officer of the [Metropolitan Police]&quot;.

The insignia of rank is a crown above a Bath Star, known as a &quot;pip&quot;, above crossed tipstaves within a wreath. This badge is all but unique within the British police, shared only with the Commissioner of the City of London Police, the smallest territorial police force, and HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary. Like all chief officer ranks in the British police, commissioners wear gorget patches on the collars of their tunics. The gorget patches are similar to those worn by generals, aside from being of silver-on-black instead of the Army&#x27;s gold-on-red. 

At one time, the commissioners were either retired military officers or civil servants. Sir John Nott-Bower, who served as commissioner from 1953 to 1958, was the first career police officer to hold the post, despite several previous commissioners having served in senior administrative positions in colonial forces and the Metropolitan Police itself. Nott-Bower&#x27;s successor Sir Joseph Simpson was the first commissioner to have started his career at the lowest rank of constable. However, Sir Robert Mark, appointed in 1972, was the first to have risen through all the ranks from the lowest to the highest, as all his successors have done.

, the post of commissioner is appointed for a period of five years. Applicants are appointed to the post by the monarch, following a recommendation by the Home Secretary under the Police Act 1996.

==Eligibility and accountability==
The post of commissioner is &quot;accountable to the Home Secretary; to the Mayor&#x27;s Office for Policing and Crime, and must answer to Londoners and the public nationally.&quot; In 2008 and 2011, applicants to the post of commissioner had to be British citizens (in 2008 this was explicitly stated to be because of the role of the commissioner in national security), and be &quot;serving UK chief constables or of equivalent UK ranks and above, or have recent experience at these levels&quot;. In contrast, applicants in 2018 were told that the post of commissioner was &quot;non reserved&quot; (seemingly a reference to the Aliens&#x27; Employment Act 1955 (as amended)) and that there were no specific restrictions on nationality.

The requirement to be a British national blocked the appointment of non-British commissioners in the past, such as in August 2011, when Prime Minister David Cameron wanted former Los Angeles Police Department Chief Bill Bratton to become the new commissioner. However, in 2014 section 42 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 was amended by section 140 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, whereby a person who is or has been &quot;a constable in any part of the United Kingdom&quot; or &quot;a police officer in an approved overseas police force, of at least the approved rank&quot; could be appointed. Determinations made in 2018 under Regulation 11 of the Police Regulations 2003 restrict the constables eligible for appointment to those who are serving, or have served, in the ranks of assistant chief constable, commander, or a more senior rank in a police force in any part of the United Kingdom. The Appointment of Chief Officers of Police (Overseas Police Forces) Regulations 2014 approve certain Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and US police forces and ranks.

The selection process in 2017, to select Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe&#x27;s successor, involved the candidates undergoing psychometric testing in addition to interviews with the Home Secretary, Mayor of London and Policing Minister. The process is conducted in private and the Home Office has specifically called for a &quot;news blackout&quot;. The discussion and public profile of the candidates was limited to speculation and rumour, with the Home Office refusing to even confirm the shortlisted candidates covered in the media.

The Centre for Public Safety has recommended the selection process be reformed, to provide opportunities for greater public, community and workforce engagement in the process. In particular, suggesting a series of community interview panels and a public candidate forum – though they maintain that the final decision should still rest with the Home Secretary.

<doc id="607902" wikidata="Q186537" url="?curid=607902" title="Khanate of Kazan">
<text>The Khanate of Kazan was a Tatar state that occupied the territory of the former Volga Bulgaria between 1438 and 1552. The khanate covered contemporary Tatarstan, Mari El, Chuvashia, Mordovia, and parts of Udmurtia and Bashkortostan; its capital was the city of Kazan. It was one of the successor states of the Golden Horde 
(Mongol state), and it came to an end when it was conquered by the Tsardom of Russia.

==Geography and population==
The territory of the Khanate comprised the Muslim Bulgar-populated lands of the Bolğar, Cükätäw, Kazan, and Qaşan duchies and other regions that originally belonged to Volga Bulgaria. The Volga, Kama and Vyatka were the main rivers of the khanate, as well as the major trade ways. The majority of the population were Kazan Tatars. Their self-identity was not restricted to Tatars; many identified themselves simply as Muslims or as &quot;the people of Kazan&quot;. Islam was the state religion.

The local feudal nobility consisted of ethnic Bulgars, but the court and bodyguard of the Kazan khans were composed of steppe Tatar (Kipchaks, and later of Nogais) that lived in Kazan. According to the Ginghizide tradition, the local Turkic tribes were also called &quot;Tatars&quot; by the steppe nobility and, later, by the Russian elite. Part of the higher nobility hailed from the Golden Horde. It included members of four leading noble families: Arghin, Barin, Qipchaq, and Shirin.

Peoples subject to the khan included the Chuvash, Mari, Mordvins, Mishar Tatars, Udmurt, and Bashkir. Some of the Komi tribes were also incorporated into the Khanate. The Mishars had arrived during the period of the Golden Horde and gradually assimilated the resident Mordvins and Burtas. Their territory was governed by former steppe Tatars. Some Mishar duchies were never controlled from Kazan and instead gravitated towards the Qasim Khanate or Muscovite Russia.

Most of the khanate territory was covered by forests, and only the southern part adjoined the steppe. The main population of the steppes were the nomadic Manghites, also known as Nogais, who sometimes recognized the rule of the Kazan khan, but more often raided agricultural Tatars and Chuvash, as they had done in the Golden Horde period. Later, Nogais were transplanted and replaced with Kalmyks. More recently, this area was settled by Tatars, Chuvash and Russians, who erected defensive walls to guard the southern border. Since the khanate was established, Tatar Cossack troops defended the khanate from the Nogais.

Russian sources indicate that at least five languages were used in the Kazan khanate. The first and foremost was the Tatar language, including the Middle dialect of the Kazan Tatars and the Western dialect of the Mishars. Its written form (Old Tatar language) was the favoured language of the state. The Chuvash language was a descendant of the Bolgar language, spoken by the pagan Chuvash people. The Bolgar language also strongly influenced the Middle dialect of Tatar language. The other three were probably the Mari language, the Mordvin languages and the Bashkir language, likewise developed from the Bolgar and Kipchak languages.

==History==
The former territories of Volga Bulgaria (Kazan Ulus or Kazan Duchy) may have regained a degree of independence within the disintegrating Golden Horde by the turn of the 15th century. The principality was self-governed and maintained a dynasty of Bolgar rulers. Whatever the status of this proto-state, the founder of the khanate was Ulugh Muhammad, who assumed the title of khan and usurped the throne of Kazan with some help from local nobility in 1437 or 1438. It has been suggested that the transfer of power from the local Bolgar dynasty to Muhammad was finalized by his son Maxmud in 1445.

Throughout its history, the khanate was prone to civil turmoil and struggles for the throne. The khans were replaced 19 times in 115 years. There were a total of fifteen reigning khans, some ascending the throne multiple times. The Khan was often elected from the Gengizides by vernacular nobility and even by the citizens themselves.

Regarding the history of the khanate, there is a scarcity of sources. Not only no single document of the khanate survived the Russian conquest, but even the documents of early Russian colonial administration (Prikaz Kazanskogo Dvortsa) were all destroyed during the Time of Troubles.

===Early history===
During the reign of Ulugh Muhammad and his son Maxmud, Kazan forces raided Muscovy and its subject lands several times. Vasily II of Moscow engaged in the Muscovite War of Succession against his cousins, was defeated in a battle near Suzdal, and was forced to pay ransom to the Kazan khan.

In July 1487, Grand Duke Ivan III of Moscow occupied Kazan and seated a puppet leader, Möxämmädämin, on the Kazan throne. After that, the Kazan Khanate became a protectorate of Moscow, and Russian merchants were allowed to trade freely throughout its territory. Supporters of a union between the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate tried to exploit the population&#x27;s grievances to provoke revolts (in 1496, 1500, and 1505), but with negligible results.

In 1521, Kazan emerged from the dominance of Moscow, concluding a mutual aid treaty with the Astrakhan Khanate, the Crimean Khanate and the Nogay Horde. The combined forces of khan Muhamed Giray and his Crimean allies then attacked Muscovy.

===The final decade===
The reinforcement of Crimea displeased the pro-Moscow elements of the Kazan Khanate, and some of these noblemen provoked a revolt in 1545. The result was the deposition of Safa Giray. A Moscow supporter, Şahğäli, occupied the throne. Following that year, Moscow organized several campaigns to impose control over Kazan, but the attempts were unsuccessful.

With the help of the Nogays, Safa Giray returned to the throne. He executed 75 noblemen, and the rest of his opposition escaped to Russia. In 1549 he died, and his 3-year-old son Ütämeşgäräy was recognized as khan. His regent and the de facto ruler of the khanate was his mother Söyembikä. The administration of the ulan Qoşçaq gained a degree of independence under her rule.

At that time Safa Giray&#x27;s relatives (including Devlet I Giray) were in Crimea. Their invitation to the throne of Kazan was vitiated by a large portion of vernacular nobility. Under Qoşçaq&#x27;s government relations with Russia continued to worsen. A group of disgruntled noblemen at the beginning of 1551 invited a supporter of Tsar Ivan the Terrible, Şahğäli, for the second time.

At the same time the lands to the west of the Volga River (Taw yağı) were ceded to Russia. Ütämeşgäräy, along with his mother, was sent to a Moscow prison. Şahğäli occupied the Kazan throne until February 1552. Anti-Moscow elements in the Kazan government exiled Şahğäli and invited the Astrakhan prince Yadegar Mokhammad, along with the Nogays, to aid them.

===Downfall===
In August 1552, forces of Ivan the Terrible, operating from the Russian castle of Sviyazhsk, laid siege to Kazan. The Russians defeated the Tatar inland troops and burnt Archa and some castles. On October 3, after two months of siege and destruction of the citadel walls, the Russians entered the city. Some defenders managed to escape but most were put to the sword. Yadegar Moxammad was imprisoned and the population was slaughtered.

After the fall of Kazan, territories such as Udmurtia and Bashkortostan joined Russia without a conflict. The administration of the khanate was wiped out; pro-Moscow and neutral nobles kept their lands, but others were executed. Tatars were then resettled far away from rivers, roads and Kazan. Free lands were settled by Russians and sometimes by pro-Russian Tatars. Orthodox bishops such as Germogen forcibly baptized many Tatars.

===Resistance===
Part of the population continued to resist Russian rule until 1556. Rebel governments were formed in Chalem and Mishatamaq, but as the Nogays under Ğäli Äkräm often raided the agricultural population, the coalition went to ruin. After a brutal repression against the Kazan rebels, their commanders were executed.

By some estimates, the population of the former khanate declined by several thousand during the wars. The administration, known as the Kazan Palace&#x27;s Office undertook the forced Russification and Christianization of the Tatars and other peoples. The term &quot;Tsardom of Kazan&quot; was in use until 1708 when the Kazan Governorate was formed.

==Economics==
The Khanate&#x27;s urban population produced clay ware, wood and metal handiworks, leather, armor, ploughs and jewels. The major cities included Qazan, Arça, Cükätaw, Qaşan, Çallı, Alat and Cöri. The urban population also traded with the people of Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Russia. In the 16th century, Russia became the main trading partner of Kazan, and the khanate shared the economic system of Moscow. The major markets were the Taşayaq Bazaar in Kazan and the Markiz Isle fair on the Volga River. Agricultural landownership was based on the söyurğal and hereditary estates.

==Society==
The khan governed the state. He based his actions on decisions and consultations of a cabinet council, or Diwan. The nobility comprised the ranks of &quot;bäk&quot; (beg), &quot;ämir&quot; (emir), and &quot;morza&quot;. Military estates consisted of the &quot;uğlan&quot; (ulan), &quot;bahadir&quot;, &quot;içki&quot; (ichki). Muslim clergy also played a major role. They were divided into &quot;säyet&quot; (seid), &quot;şäyex&quot; (sheikh), &quot;qazí&quot; (qazi), and &quot;imams&quot;. The &quot;ulema&quot;, or clergy, played a judicial role and maintained the &quot;madrassas&quot; (schools) and &quot;maktabs&quot; (libraries).

The majority of the population comprised &quot;qara xalıq&quot; (black people), a free Muslim population
who lived on state land. The feudal lands were mostly settled by &quot;çura&quot; (serfs). Prisoners of war were usually sold to Turkey or into Central Asia. Occasionally they were sold within the Khanate as slaves (&quot;qol&quot;) and sometimes were settled on feudal lands to become &quot;çura&quot; later. The Muslim and non-Muslim population of the Khanate had to pay the yasaq.

==Administration and military==
The Khanate was divided into 5 daruğa: Alat, Arça, Gäreç, Cöri and Nuğay. The term daruğa translates as &quot;direction&quot;. They replaced the &quot;duchies&quot; that the khanate originated from. Some feudal lords sporadically asserted independence from Kazan, but such attempts would be promptly suppressed.

The military of the khanate consisted of armament and men from the darughas and subject lands, khan guards, and the troops of the nobility. The number of soldiers was never constant, ranging from 20,000 to 60,000 in number. Often, troops from Nogay, the Crimea and Russia also served the Kazan khans. Firearms (arquebuse) were used for defending the walls of Kazan.

==Culture==

In general, the culture of the Kazan Khanate descended from that of Volga Bulgaria. Cultural elements of the Golden Horde were also present in noble circles.

A large part of the urban population was literate. Large libraries were present in mosques and madrassahs. Kazan became a center of science and theology.

Although Islamic influence predominated, lay literature also developed. The most prominent Old Tatar language poets were Möxämmädyar, Ömmi Kamal, Möxämmädämin, Ğärifbäk, and Qolşärif. Möxämmädyar renovated the traditions of Kazan poetry, and his verses were very popular.

The city of Bolghar retained its position as a sacred place, but had this function only, due to the emergence of Kazan as a major economic and political center in the 1430s.

The architecture of the khanate is characterized by white-stone architecture and wood carvings.

<text>In Islam, Jahannam () is the place of punishment for evildoers in the afterlife, or hell. This notion is an integral part of Islamic theology, and has occupied an important place in the Muslim belief. It is often called by the proper name Jahannam, but other names refer to hell and these are also often used as the names of different gates to hell. The term &quot;Jahannam&quot; itself is used not only for hell in general but (in one interpretation) for the uppermost layer of hell.

The importance of Hell in Islamic doctrine is that it is an essential element of the Day of Judgment, which is one of the six articles of faith (belief in God, the angels, books, prophets, Day of Resurrection, and decree) &quot;by which the Muslim faith is traditionally defined.&quot;

It is often called by the proper name Jahannam, but other names include &quot;the fire&quot; (, &quot;al-nar&quot;), &quot;blazing fire&quot; (, &quot;jaheem&quot;), &quot;that which breaks to pieces&quot; ( &quot;hutamah&quot;), &quot;the abyss&quot; (, &quot;haawiyah&quot;), &quot;the blaze&quot; (, &quot;sa’eer&quot;), &quot;place of burning&quot; ( &quot;Saqar&quot;), which are also often used as the names of different gates to hell. 

Punishment and suffering in hell, in mainstream Islam, is physical, psychological, and spiritual, and varies according to the sins of the condemned person. Its excruciating pain and horror described in the Qur&#x27;an often parallels the pleasure and delights of Jannah (paradise). It is commonly believed by Muslims that confinement to hell is temporary for Muslims but not for others, although there are disagreements to this view 
and Muslim scholars disagree over whether Hell itself will last for eternity (the majority&#x27;s view),&lt;ref name=&quot;Islamic Traditions p. 12 w/quote&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or whether God&#x27;s mercy will lead to it eventually being eliminated.

The common belief among Muslims holds that Jahannam coexists with the temporal world, just as Jannah does (rather than being created after Judgment Day).
Hell is described physically in different ways by different sources of Islamic literature. It is enormous in size, and located below Paradise. It has seven levels, each one more severe than the one above it, but it is also said to be a huge pit over which the bridge of As-Sirāt crosses and the resurrected walk. It is said to have mountains, rivers, valleys and &quot;even oceans&quot; filled with disgusting fluids; and also to be able to walk (controlled by reins), and ask questions, much like a sentient being.

==Sources==
Different sources used by (or related to) Islam give different descriptions of hell, its torments, location, inhabitants and their sins, etc.
===Pre-Islamic: Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Babylonian Talmud===
In the Hebrew Bible, &quot;Gei-Hinnom&quot; or &quot;Gei-ben-Hinnom&quot;, the &quot;Valley [of the Son] of Hinnom&quot; is an accursed Valley in Jerusalem where child sacrifices took place. In the canonical Gospels, Jesus talks about Gehenna as a place &quot;where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched&quot; (). In the apocryphal book of 4 Ezra, written around the 2nd century BCE, Gehinnom appears as a transcendental place of punishment. This change comes to completion in the Babylonian Talmud, written around 500 CE.

It can be thought that the narrative of Hell in Islam is largely shaped by the offerings of human sacrifices by passing it over fire or burning it to Molech, which the Torah describes as taking place in the Gehenna (Jeremiah 7; 32–35). While the Gehenna gives its name to Hell, the fire used for the offerings turns into Hellfire, and Molech turns into Malik, the guardian of Hell in the Qur&#x27;anic narrative. (Q.43:77)

===Qur&#x27;an===
According to Einar Thomassen, much of how Muslims picture and think about Jahannam comes from the Qur&#x27;an. He found nearly 500 references to Jahannam in it, using a variety of names.

The following is an example of the Qur&#x27;anic verses about Hell:
:Surely the day of decision is (a day) appointed:
:The day on which the trumpet shall be blown so you shall come forth in hosts,
:And the heaven shall be opened so that it shall be all openings,
:And the mountains shall be moved off so that they shall remain a mere semblance.
:Surely hell lies in wait,
:A place of resort for the inordinate,
:Living therein for ages.
:They shall not taste therein cool nor drink
:But boiling water and filth,
:as a corresponding recompense.
:Surely they did not feared the account,
:and they rejected Our messages as lies.
:And We have recorded everything in a book,
:So taste! For We will not increase you in anything except torment. (Q.78:17–30)
Among the different terms and phrases mentioned above that refer to Hell in the Qur&#x27;an, Fire (&quot;nār&quot;) is used 125 times, Hell (&quot;jahannam&quot;) 77 times, and Blazing Fire (&quot;jaḥīm&quot;) 26 times, or 23 by another count.
The description of Jahannam as a place of blazing fire appears in almost every verse in the Qur&#x27;an describing Hell.
One collection of descriptions of Hell found in the Qur&#x27;an include &quot;rather specific indications of the tortures of the Fire&quot;: flames that crackle and roar; fierce, boiling waters, scorching wind, and black smoke, roaring and boiling as if it would burst with rage.

Hell is described as being located below Paradise, 
having seven gates and &quot;for every gate there shall be a specific party&quot; of sinners (Q.15:43–44). The Qur&#x27;an also mentions wrongdoers having &quot;degrees (or ranks) according to their deeds&quot;, (which some scholars believe refers to the &quot;specific parties&quot; at each of the gates); and of there being &quot;seven heavens ˹in layers˺, and likewise for the earth&quot; (Q.65:12), (though this doesn&#x27;t indicate that the seven layers of earth are hell). The one mention of levels of hell is that hypocrites will be found in its very bottom.

====Disbelievers====
According to Thomassen, those specifically mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an as being punished in Hell are &quot;most typically&quot; disbelievers (&quot;kāfirūn&quot;). These include people who lived during Muhammad&#x27;s time, the polytheists (&quot;mushrikūn&quot;), or enemies of Muhammad who worshiped idols (Q.10:24), and the &quot;losers&quot;, or enemies of Muhammad who died in war against him (Q.21:70), as well as broad categories of sinners: the apostates (&quot;murtaddūn&quot;; Q.3:86–87), hypocrites (&quot;munafiqūn&quot;; Q.4:140), self-content (Q.10:7–8, 17:18), polytheists (&quot;mushrikūn&quot;; Q.4:48,116), and those who do not believe in certain key doctrines of Islam: those who deny the divine origin of the Qur&#x27;an (Q.74:16–26) or the coming of Judgement Day (Q.25:11–14).

====Committers of major sins====
In addition are those who have committed serious criminal offenses against other human beings: the murder of a believer (Q.4:93, 3:21), usury (Q.2:275), devouring the property of an orphan (Q.4:10), and slander (Q.104), particularly of a chaste woman (Q.24:23).

====Biblical and historical individuals====
Some prominent people mentioned in hadith and the Qur&#x27;an as suffering in Hell or destined to suffer there are: Pharaoh (Firʿawn; the pharaoh of The Exodus; Q:10:90-92), the wives of Noah and Lot (Q:66–10), and Abu Lahab and his wife, who were contemporaries and enemies of Muhammad (Q:111).
====Punishments====
The punishments of Hell described in the Qur&#x27;an tend to revolve around &quot;skin sensation and digestion&quot;.
 Its wretched inhabitants sigh and wail, their scorched skins are constantly exchanged for new ones so that they can taste the torment anew, drink water and though death appears on all sides they cannot die. They are linked together in chains of 70 cubits, wearing pitch for clothing and fire on their faces have boiling water that will be poured over their heads, melting their insides as well as their skins, and hooks of iron to drag them back if they should try to escape, and their remorseful admissions of wrongdoing and pleading for forgiveness are in vain.

Hell&#x27;s resemblance to a prison is strong. Inmates have chains around their necks (Q.13:5, 34:33, 36:8, 76:4, etc.), are &quot;tethered&quot; by hooks of iron (Q.22:21), and are guarded by &quot;merciless angels&quot; (&quot;zabāniyyah&quot;; Q.66:6, 96:18).

Its inmates will be thirsty and hungry &quot;constantly&quot;. Their fluids will include boiling water (Q.6:70), melted brass, and/or be bitterly cold, &quot;unclean, full of pus&quot;.
In addition to fire (Q.2:174), it has three different unique sources of food:
#&quot;Ḍari&quot;, a dry desert plant that is full of thorns and fails to relieve hunger or sustain a person (Q88:6); 
#&quot;Ghislin&quot;, which is only mentioned once (in Q69:36, which states that it is the only nourishment in hell); 
#Heads of devils hanging from the tree of Zaqqum that &quot;springs out of the bottom of Hell&quot;. (These are mentioned three or four times: Q.17:60 (as the &quot;cursed tree&quot;), Q.37:62-68, Q.44:43, Q.56:52.)

Psychological torments are humiliation (Q.3:178) and listening to &quot;sighs and sobs&quot;. (Q.11:106).

There are at least a couple of indications that physical rather than &quot;spiritual or psychological&quot; punishment predominates in jahannam according to scholars Smith and Haddad. For example, the Quran notes that inmates of jahannam will be denied the pleasure of &quot;gazing on the face of God&quot;, but nowhere does it state &quot;that this loss contributed to the agony&quot; the inmates experience. While the Quran describes the regret the inmates express for the deeds that put them in hell, it is &quot;for the consequences&quot; of the deeds &quot;rather than for the actual commission of them&quot;.

=== Hadith ===
There are &quot;scores&quot; of narrations or &quot;short narratives traced back to the Prophet or his Companions&quot; from &quot;the third/ninth century onwards&quot;, that &quot;greatly elaborate&quot; on the Quranic image of hell.

====Organization, size, and guards====
Similarly to how the Qur&#x27;an speaks of the seven gates of Hell, &quot;relatively early&quot; narrations attest that Hell has seven levels. This interpretation became &quot;widespread&quot; in Islam. The bridge (&quot;ṣirāṭ&quot;) over Hell that all resurrected souls must cross is mentioned in several narrations.

Some hadith describe the size of hell as enormous. It is so deep that if a stone were thrown into it, it would fall for 70 years before reaching the bottom (according to one hadith). Another states that the breadth of each of Hell&#x27;s walls is equivalent to a distance covered by a walking journey of 40 years. According to another source (Qurṭubī) it takes &quot;500 years&quot; to get from one of its levels to another.

Traditions often describe this in multiples of seven: hell has seventy thousand valleys, each with &quot;seventy thousand ravines, inhabited by seventy thousand serpents and scorpions&quot;.

According to one hadith, hell will be vastly more populous than Paradise. Out of every one thousand people entering into the afterlife, nine hundred and ninety-nine of them will end up in the fire. (According to at least one scholarly salafi interpretation, the hadith expresses the large disparity between the number of saved and damned rather than a specific literal ratio.)

Malik in Hadith quotes Muhammad as saying that the &quot;fire of the children of Adam [humans] which they kindle is a seventieth part of the fire of &quot;Jahannam&quot;.&quot; He also describes that fire as &quot;blacker than tar&quot;.

In book 87 Hadith 155, &quot;Interpretation of Dreams&quot; of &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot;, Muhammad is reported to have talked of angels guarding hell, each with &quot;a mace of iron&quot;, and describes Jahannam as a place &quot;built inside like a well and it had side posts like those of a well, and beside each post there was an angel carrying an iron mace. I saw therein many people hanging upside down with iron chains, and I recognized therein some men from the Quraish&quot;.

====Punishments====
Hadiths introduce punishments, reasons and revelations not mentioned in the Quran. In both Quranic verses and hadiths, &quot;the Fire&quot; is &quot;a gruesome place of punishment that is always contrasted with &quot;Jannah&quot;, &quot;the Garden&quot; (paradise). Whatever characteristic &quot;the Garden offered, the Fire usually offered the opposite conditions.&quot; Several hadith describes a part of hell that is extremely cold rather than hot, known as Zamhareer.

According to Bukhari, lips are cut by scissors. Other traditions added flogging. An Uighur manuscript also mentions drowning, stoning and falling from heights. Based on hadiths, the sinners are thought to carry signs in accordance with their sins.

====Inmates and their sins====
Hadith describe types of sinners populating hell. Seven sins doom a person to Hell, according to reports of &quot;as-Saheehayn&quot;, (i.e. the reports of the two most esteemed Sunni hadith collections: al-Bukhaari and Muslim): &quot;Associating others with Allah (&quot;shirk&quot; or idolatry); witchcraft; killing a soul whom Allah has forbidden us to kill, except in cases dictated by Islamic law; consuming orphans&#x27; wealth; consuming &quot;riba&quot; (usury); fleeing from the battlefield; and slandering chaste, innocent women.&quot;

According to a series of hadith, Muhammad claims the majority of the inhabitants of hell will be women, due to an inclination for gossip, conjecture, ungratefulness of kind treatment from their spouses and idle chatting.
The Salafi Muslim scholar ʿUmar Sulaymān al-Ashqar (d. 2012) reaffirms the arguments of al-Qurṭubī, that women have an attachment to the here and now, inability to control their passions; but allows that despite this, many women are good and pious and will go to Paradise, and some are even superior to many men in piety.

However, other hadith imply that the majority of people &quot;in paradise&quot; will be women. Since the number of men and women are approximately equal, al-Qurṭubī attempts to reconcile the conflicting hadith by suggesting that many of the women in Hell are there only temporarily and will eventually be brought reside in Paradise; thereafter the majority of the people of Paradise would be women.

Other people populating hell mentioned in hadith include, but are not limited to, the mighty, the proud and the haughty. Einar Thomassen writes that this almost certainly refers to those too proud and haughty to submit to God, i.e. unbelievers (the literal translation of Muslim is one who submits to God).

Sahih Muslim quotes Muhammad as saying that suicides would reside in Jahannam forever.
According to the hadith collection &quot;Muwaṭṭaʾ&quot; of Imam Mālik (711–795), Muhammad said: &quot;Truly a man utters words to which he attaches no importance, and by them he falls into the fire of Jahannam.&quot;

Al-Bukhari in book 72:834 added to the list of dwellers in Jahannam: &quot;The people who will receive the severest punishment from Allah will be the picture makers&quot;. Use of utensils made of precious metals could also land its users in Jahannam: &quot;A person who drinks from a silver vessel brings the fire of Jahannam into his belly&quot;. As could starving a cat to death: &quot;A woman was tortured and was put in Hell because of a cat which she had kept locked till it died of hunger.&quot;

At least one hadith indicates the importance of faith in avoiding hell, stating: &quot;... no one will enter Hell in whose heart is an atom&#x27;s weight of faith.&quot;

=== Eschatological manuals ===

&quot;Eschatological manuals&quot; were written after the hadith, they compiled the hadith on hell, and also developed descriptions of Jahannam &quot;in more deliberate ways&quot;. While the Quran and hadith tend to describe punishments that nonbelievers are forced to give themselves, the manuals illustrate external and more dramatic punishment, through devils, scorpions, and snakes.

Manuals dedicated solely to the subject of Jahannam include Ibn Abi al-Dunya&#x27;s &quot;Sifat al-nar&quot;, and al-Maqdisi&#x27;s &quot;Dhikr al-nar&quot;. 

Other manuals—such as texts by al-Ghazali and the 12th-century scholar Qadi Ayyad – &quot;dramatise life in the Fire&quot;, and present &quot;new punishments, different types of sinners, and the appearance of a multitude of devils,&quot; to exhort the faithful to piety. His hell has a structure with a specific place for each type of sinners.

According to Leor Halevi, between the moment of death and the time of their burial ceremony, &quot;the spirit of a deceased Muslim takes a quick journey to Heaven and Hell, where it beholds visions of the bliss and torture awaiting humanity at the end of days&quot;.

In &quot;The Soul&#x27;s Journey After Death&quot;, Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya, a theologian in the 14th century, writes explicitly of punishments faced by sinners and unbelievers in Jahannam. These are directly related to the wrongdoer&#x27;s earthly transgressions.

====Inmates and their sins====
In addition to those who engage in traditional sins of wine drinking, fornication, sodomy, suicide, atheism (&quot;dahriyya&quot;); hell is where those &quot;who sleep during prayer (or speak of worldly matters during it), or deny the doctrine of predestinarianism or assert absolute free-will (Qadarites), are punished. Another tradition consigns to the seven different levels of hell, seven different types of &quot;mischievous&quot; Islamic scholars. Government authorities are also threatened with hell, but often in &quot;oblique ways&quot;.

==Location and topography==
===Location===
There are many traditions on the location of paradise and hell, but not all of them &quot;are easily pictured or indeed mutually reconcilable&quot;. For example, some describe hell as in the lowest earth, while one scholar (Al-Majlisī) describes hell as &quot;surrounding&quot; the earth.
Islamic scholars speculated on where the entrance to hell might be located. Some thought the sea was the top level, or that the sulphourus well in Hadramawt (in present-day Yemen), allegedly haunted by the souls of the wicked, was the entrance to the underworld. Others considered the entrance in the valley of Hinnom (surrounding the Old City of Jerusalem). In a Persian work, the entry to hell is located in a gorge called &quot;Wadi Jahannam&quot; (in present-day Afghanistan).

===Seven levels===
Einar Thomassen writes that the seven levels of hell mentioned in hadith &quot;came to be associated&quot; with the seven names used in the Quran to refer to hell, with a category of inmates assigned to each level.
#&quot;Jahannam&quot; was reserved for Muslims who had committed grave sins.
#&quot;al-Laza&quot; (the blaze) 
#&quot;al-Hutama&quot; (the consuming fire) 
#&quot;al-Sa&#x27;ir&quot; 
#&quot;al-Saqar&quot; (the scorching fire) 
#&quot;al-jahim&quot; (the hot place) 
#&quot;al-Hawiya&quot; (the abyss) for the hypocrites.
&quot;Various similar models exist with a slightly differing order of names&quot;, according to Christian Lange, and he and A. F. Klein give similar lists of levels. &quot;Al-Laza&quot; and &quot;al-Saqar&quot; are switched in Lange&#x27;s list, and there is no accompanying type of unbelievers for each level. In A. F. Klein&#x27;s list, it is the names of the levels that&#x27;s not included, and instead of a level for Zoroastrians there is one for &quot;witches and fortunetellers&quot;.
Another description of the layers of hell comes from &quot;models such as that recorded by al-Thalabi (died 427/1035)&quot; corresponding to &quot;the seven earths of medieval Islamic cosmology&quot;; 
the place of hell before the Day of Resurrection. This idea derives from the concept of &quot;seven earths&quot;, each beneath the surface of the known world, serving as a sort of underworld, with hell at its bottom. Sources Miguel Asin Palacios and Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes describe these levels as:
# &quot;Adim&quot; (surface), inhabited by mankind and jinn.
# &quot;Basit&quot; (plain), the prison of winds, from where the winds come from.
# &quot;Thaqil&quot; (region of distress), the antechamber of hell, in which dwell men with the mouth of a dog, the ears of a goat and the cloven hoof of an ox.
# &quot;Batih&quot; (place of torrents or swamps), a valley through which flows a stream of boiling sulphur to torment the wicked. The dweller in this valley have no eyes and in place of feet, have wings.
# &quot;Hayn&quot; (region of adversity), in which serpents of enormous size devour the infidels.
# &quot;Masika&quot;/&quot;Sijjin&quot; (store or dungeon), the office where sins are recorded and where souls are tormented by scorpions of the size of mules. In &quot;tafsir&quot;, this place is sometimes considered the lowest place instead.
# &quot;As-Saqar&quot; (place of burning) and &quot;Athara&quot; (place of damp and great cold) the home of Iblis, who is chained, his hand fastened one in front of and the other behind him, except when set free by God to chastise his demons.

A large number of hadith about Muhammad&#x27;s tour of hell during the miʿrāj, describe the various sinners and their torments. A summary of the uppermost level of hell, &quot;reserved for deadly sins&quot; and &quot;subdivided into fourteen mansions, one close above the other, and each is a place of punishment for a different sin&quot;, was done by Asin Palacios:

The first mansion is an ocean of fire comprising seventy lesser seas, and on the shore of each sea stands a city of fire. In each city are seventy thousand dwellings; in each dwelling, seventy thousand coffins of fire, the tombs of men and women, who, stung by snakes and scorpions, shriek in anguish. These wretches, the Keeper enlightens Mahomet, were tyrants.

In the second mansion beings with blubber lips writhe under the red-hot forks of demons, while serpents enter their mouths and eat their bodies from within. These are faithless guardians, devoured now by serpents even as they once devoured the inheritances committed to their trust. Lower down usurers stagger about, weighed down by the reptiles in their bellies. Further, shameless women hang by the hair that they had exposed to the gaze of man. Still further down liars and slanderers hang by their tongues from red-hot hooks lacerating their faces with nails of copper. Those who neglected the rites of prayer and ablution are now monsters with the head of dogs and the bodies of swine and are the food of serpents. In the next mansion drunkards suffer the torture of raging thirst, which demons affect to quench with cups of a liquid fire that burns their entrails. Still lower, hired mourners and professional women singers hang head downwards and howl with pain as devils cut their tongues with burning shears. Adulterers are punished in a cone-shaped furnace... and their shrieks are drowned by the curses of their fellow damned at the stench of their putrid flesh. In the next mansion unfaithful wives hang by their breasts, their hands tied to their necks. Undutiful children are tortured in a fire by fiends with red-hot forks. Lower down, shackled in collars of fire, are those who failed to keep their word. Murderers are being knifed by demons in endless expiation of their crime. Lastly, in the fourteenth and lowest mansion of the first storey, are being crucified on burning pillars those who failed to keep the rule of prayer; as the flames devour them, their flesh is seen gradually to peel off their bones.

===Three Valleys===

The three valleys in Jahannam described in the Quran on separate occasions are:
# &quot;Ghayy&quot;
# &quot;Wayl&quot;
# &quot;Saqar&quot;
Of these valleys, Ghayy is for those who postpone their prayers to the time of the next prayer, Wayl is for worshippers who neglect their prayers, and Saqar (also described as one of the seven levels above) is for those who did not pray, did not feed the poor, waded in vain dispute with vain talkers, and denied the Day of Judgement until they died.

===Pit===
In addition to having levels, an important feature of Judgement Day is that hell is a huge pit over which the bridge of As-Sirāt crosses, and from which sinners fall making their arrival in hell (see &quot;Eschatological manuals&quot; above) Christian Lange writes &quot;it made sense to picture [hell] as a vast subterranean funnel, spanned by the Bridge, which the resurrected pass on their way to paradise, with a brim (&quot;shafīr&quot;) and concentric circles leading down into a central pit at the bottom (&quot;qaʿr&quot;).&quot;

But along with a pit and levels, hell also has mountains, rivers, valleys and &quot;even oceans&quot; filled with &quot;fire, blood, and pus&quot;.

===Sentience===
Along with being a pit and a series of levels, some scholars, like al-Ghazali and the thirteenth-century Muslim scholar Al-Qurtubi, describe hell as a gigantic sentient being, rather than a place. In &quot;Paradise and Hell-fire in Imam al Qurtubi&quot;, Qurtubi writes, &quot;On the Day of Judgment, hell will be brought with seventy thousand reins. A single rein will be held by seventy thousand angels...&quot;. Based on verse 67:7 and verse 50:30, Jahannam inhales and has &quot;breaths&quot;. Islamicity notes &quot;the animalistic nature&quot; of &quot;The Fire&quot; in Quranic verse 25:12: &quot;When the Hellfire sees them from a distant place, they will hear its fury and roaring&quot;. According to verse 50:30, God will ask Jahannam if it is full and Jahannam will answer: &quot;Are there any more (to come)?&quot;

==Inmates==
=== Humans ===

Thomassen writes that in Islamic thought, there was &quot;a certain amount of tension&quot; between the two &quot;distinct functions&quot; of hell: to punish disbelievers/non-Muslims and to punish anyone who committed serious sins—both of which could draw support from Quranic verses and hadith. Factors involved in who will be consigned to hell are: 
*Unforgiveableness of unbelief. According to Smith and Haddad, perhaps &quot;almost the only point on which Muslim thinkers completely agreed&quot; was that it was &quot;certain that the one unpardonable sin, that for which the pain of the Fire is assured, is refusal to testify to the &quot;tawẖīd&quot; (the indivisible oneness) of God, called either &quot;kufr&quot; (unbelief) or &quot;shirk&quot; (worshiping other besides the one God).
*God&#x27;s mercy. &quot;The tendency has been to suggest that even grave sinners may hope for God’s mercy, as long as they have professed belief and are Muslims&quot;, based on (two types of) Quranic verses: 
**&quot;Indeed, Allah does not forgive associating others with Him ˹in worship˺ but forgives anything else of whoever He wills...&quot; (Q.4:48),
**&quot;Whoever commits evil or wrongs themselves then seeks Allah&#x27;s forgiveness will certainly find Allah All-Forgiving, Most Merciful&quot; (Q.4:110); 
**&quot;So whoever does an atom&#x27;s weight of good will see it&quot; (Q.99:7–8) (and would be recompensed). 
*That all human beings &quot;are responsible&quot; for their actions in this world, and all (even Muslims) face a &quot;real possibility&quot; of going to hell, (Q.19:71); This theme &quot;has continued to play an important role throughout the history of Islam&quot;;
*God&#x27;s freedom to send to Paradise or Hell, whoever he chooses, 
**&quot;We do certainly know best those who deserve most to be burned therein&quot; (Q.19:70); 
**&quot;Indeed, Allah does not forgive associating others with Him ˹in worship˺ but forgives anything else of whoever He wills&quot;. (Q.4:48); 
*What sins are considered grave enough to merit damnation (&quot;There is no fixed canon of mortal sins in Islamic theology&quot;); 
*Whether if grave sins such as usury, murder of another Muslim, are not unpardonable in themselves, they are sufficiently serious that those that commit them cease to be Muslims and become guilty of unbelief, a sin that &quot;is&quot; unpardonable. (&quot;Famous&quot; issue in the theological debates of early Islam between &quot;Khawarij&quot;, &quot;Murji&#x27;a&quot;, &quot;Mutazila&quot;, &quot;Ash&#x27;ari&quot;).
&quot;Ultimately&quot; the view of the Ash&#x27;arite school prevailed in &quot;classical Islamic theology&quot;: God was free to judge as he chose, but on the other hand all believers can feel assured of salvation.

This left the issue of how/whether to punish sinful Muslims (to &quot;ensure ... moral and religious discipline&quot; and responsibility for individual actions). One solution was to reserve for Muslims the highest level of hell with the most lenient punishments, but a &quot;more common&quot; solution was to make the stay of Muslims in hell temporary.

The issue of whether People of the Book are a variety of believers or unbelievers destined for hell is also discussed. In two places in the Quran, almost identical verses seem to indicate they are saved:
*&quot;Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve&quot; (Q.2:62; cf. 5:69)
But there &quot;exists a strong exegetical tradition&quot; that claims these verses were abrogated by a later verse indicating a much less pleasant hereafter: 
*&quot;...whoever desires a religion other than Islam, it shall not be accepted from him, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers.&quot; (Q.3:85)

=== Jinn, devils, and angels ===
According to Islam, the jinn are obligated to follow the Islamic law (&quot;sharīʿa&quot;). The pairing of humans and jinn as subjects of God&#x27;s judgement is settled in the Quranic phrase &quot;al-ins wa-l-jinn&quot; (&quot;the humans and the jinn&quot;). Both are created to &quot;serve&quot; (&quot;&#x27;abada&quot;) God (51:56), both are capable of righteous and evil deeds (11:119). The Quran confirms that hell will be filled with both sinful humans as well as sinful jinn.

The fate of Satan is less clear. Some say, he and his offspring are already chained in hell (&quot;Sijjin&quot;), others say he and his hosts will be the first to enter hell, while yet others say, the devils will all perish at Judgment Day. Since Satan and the devils are created from fire, some scholars suggest that they will not burn in fire, but suffer from the intense cold of intense cold (&quot;Zamharīr&quot;). A popular opinion among Shias is, that the Mahdi will kill Iblis. In some manuals of Islamic eschatology, the Angels of divine justice will seize and kill Iblis, instead. Although there is a disagreement about the exact fate of the devils, most agree that the devils are damned to hell. An exception are the Murji&#x27;ah who argue that even Satan might be restored to his former glory.

Instead of devils, angels punish the sinners and guard the entrances to hell. These angels were created from the fires of hell, and therefore, do not suffer wherein. They are described as subordinates of God and thus, their punishment is ultimately just.

Quranic verses suggest that Judgment Day, Paradise and Hell are not &quot;conceived to lie&quot; off in some indefinite future, but &quot;immediately ahead; it is &quot;now&quot;, or almost there already&quot;.

It is also a common belief among Muslims that hell, like paradise, is not awaiting the destruction of earth and arrival of Judgment Day, but &quot;coexists in time&quot; with the temporal world, having already been created. The basis of this belief was the Quranic statement &quot;hell &quot;has been&quot; prepared (&quot;uʿiddat&quot;) for the unbelievers&quot;, and also hadith reporting that Muhammad had seen the punishment of sinners in hell during his miraculous &quot;miraj&quot; journey on a winged creature.

===Eternal or temporary===
The common belief among Muslims (as indicated above) is that duration in hell is temporary for Muslims but not for others. 
This combines in Jahannam two concepts: an eternal hell (for unbelievers), and a place (an &quot;outer level&quot; of hell was sometimes called &quot;al-barrāniyya&quot;), 
resembling the Christian Catholic idea of purgatory (for believers eventually destined for heaven after punishment for their sins).

Several verses in the Quran mention the eternal nature of Hell or both Paradise and Hell, 
or that the damned will linger in hell for ages. Two verses in the Quran (6:128 and 11:107) emphasize that consignment to hell is horrible and eternal — but include the caveat &quot;except as God (or your Lord) wills it&quot;, which some scholars considered an exemption from the eternity of hell. which suggests to some that Jahannam will be destroyed some day, 
so that its inhabitants may either be rehabilitated or cease to exist. The concept of hell&#x27;s annihilation is referred to as &quot;fanāʾ al-nār&quot;. 
Thomassen writes that &quot;several types of concerns&quot; weigh &quot;against the idea of an eternal hell in Islamic thought&quot;: belief in the mercy of God; resistance to the idea that Muslims—even great sinners—would &quot;end up together with the disbelievers in the hereafter&quot;; and resistance to the idea that &quot;something other than God himself might have eternal existence&quot;.

The Ulama (Islamic scholars) disagree on this issue. According to Christian Lange, &quot;the majority&quot; of theologians agreed that Hell like Paradise &quot;was eternal&quot;. Ahmad ibn Hanbal argued the eternity of hell and paradise are proven by the Quran, although earths and heavens (sun, moon, stars) will perish. In modern times Shia cleric Sayyid Mujtaba Musavi Lari argues against the idea that hell will not last for eternity.

Contrarily, for Muʿtazilis the eternity of paradise and hell posed a major problem, since they regard God as the only eternal entity.
Egyptian Hanafi author al-Tahawi writes that God punishes sinners in proportions to their offense in accordance with his justice, afterwards release them in accordance with his mercy. Ibn Taymiyya (d.728/1328) also argued for a limited abode in hell, based on the Quran and God&#x27;s attribute of mercy
(in more recent times &quot;fanāʾ al-nār&quot; has been supported by Rashīd Riḍā (d. 1936), İzmirli Ismail Hakkı (d. 1946) Yūsuf al-Qarādāwī (d. 2022)).

How optimistic Muslims were about whether they and the rest of humanity would avoid hellfire, or at least long durations of it, varied considerably. The idea of the &quot;demise of hell&quot; (ibn Taymiyya, Yemenite ibn al-Wazir (d. 840/1436)) meant (or at least meant to these theologians) that God would provide for &quot;universal salvation even for non-Muslims&quot;.
At the other end of the theological &quot;spectrum&quot; were fearful &quot;renunciants&quot; such as al-Hasan al-Basri. Though Hasan was so faithful he was considered a &quot;pious exemplar&quot; of his age, he still felt great anxiety as to whether he would be among those fortunate enough to spend 1,000 years suffering in hell before being released to Jannah.

==Doctrines and beliefs==
=== Sufism ===
Many prominent Sufis preached &quot;the centrality of the love of God&quot; for which focus on eternal reward was a &quot;distraction&quot;. Rabi&#x27;a al-&#x27;Adawiyya aka Rabia of Basra (died 801), is said to have proclaimed to passersby
&quot;O God! If I worship You for fear of Hell, burn me in Hell, and if I worship You in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise. But if I worship You for Your Own sake, grudge me not Your everlasting Beauty&quot;.

Similarly, Bāyazīd Basṭāmī (d. 234/848) proclaimed the fire of &quot;God&#x27;s love&quot; burns a thousand times more intensely than hellfire.

Others did not take literally the Quran&#x27;s verses on Paradise and Hell as physical places where believers are rewarded with pleasure and sinners tortured with pain. According to ibn ʿArabī, Hell and Paradise are psychological states of the soul manifested after its separation from the body.
He believed Hell and Paradise are only the distance or closeness from God, respectively, in the mind of resurrectant. The torments of Hell wrong-doers endure are actually their conception of their distance from God, created by their sinful indulgence in their earthly desires and the illusion of things other than God as existent. But distance from God is also only illusory, because everything other than God is an illusion, since &quot;everything is a form of the degrees of the Divine Existence&quot;. So in fact, Hell and Paradise are just as real as the current world, which is unreal in comparison to God.

Many ideas attributed Ibn Arabi have been rejected by Wahhabis. For example, the Wahhabi Ahmad ibn Idris debated in detail with the ex-Wahhabi Nasir al-Kubaybi about sins committed by him and his students, and deviations that are said to have been propagated by Ibn Arabi. For Ahmad ibn Idris, Nasir al-Kubaybi explained that no human except the Prophet is protected from sins, and he also said that individuals&#x27; actions are to be judged in line with Qur&#x27;an and Sunnah only, and regarding Ibn Arabi, he fiercely defended the stance that Ibn Arabi was a Muslim of sound faith and whatever contradicted this was in fact not from him. 

Many other prominent Sufis too had more conventional attitudes, such as al-Ghazali, who warned Muslims,&quot;your coming unto it (hellfire) is certain, while your salvation therefrom is no more than conjecture. … fill up your heart therefore with a dread of that destination.&quot;Moreover, Abd Al-Aziz Al-Dabbagh gave precise details of the locations of the two abodes in terms of Islamic Cosmology, while noting that the ignorance of existence of the two abodes at present alone suffices to lead someone to Hell, and Shaykh Rifai attributed its bottom level to oppressors. Abdulqadir Jilani said that through the blessings of his students&#x27; association with him none of them were going to enter Hell, Abu Madyan Al-Ghawth in Hikam likened working for other than God to the past behavior of Hell&#x27;s inhabitants.

===Non-Sunni schools===
====Twelver Shia====
According to a major Shia Islam website, al-Islam.org, Hellfire is the eternal destination of unbelievers, although another essay on the site states that there is a set of unbelievers known as &quot;‘Jahil-e-Qasir’&quot; (lit. ‘inculpable ignorant’), who &quot;will attain salvation if they are truthful to their own religion&quot; because the message of Islam either didn&#x27;t reach them, or reached them in an incorrect form. For those Muslims &quot;who have committed a certain number of lesser sins and offences, they shall either spend an appropriate amount of time in hellfire or receive the kindness and forgiveness of God&quot;.
Al-Islam also states: &quot;According to the Qur`an and ahadith, heaven and hell exist at present. However, they will become fully apparent and represented only in the Hereafter ...&quot;.

====Isma&#x27;ili====
Isma&#x27;ili authors (such as Abu Yaqub al-Sijistānī) believe resurrection, heaven and hell do not involve physical bodies, but what is spiritual. Suffering of hell came from failure to be enlightened by the teachings of the Isma&#x27;ili Imam, but such suffering does not require resurrection. According to one source, they do not believe hell will last for eternity, based on their interpretation of Quranic verse 11:106. Instead, they believe hell to be a possible station of the soul&#x27;s journey to its perfection in afterlife.

====Ibadis====
According to Interfaith Alliance, Ibadis believe sinning Ibadis and all non-Ibadis are doomed to hell. According to Islamic studies professor Gavin Picken, Ibadis believe non-Ibadis and Ibadis who committed major sins without repenting will remain in hell forever.

====Ahmadiyya====
According to the Ahmadiyya movement (by way of their official website), the places of Paradise and Hell are actually images of man&#x27;s own spiritual life during lifetime, hell is a manifestation of his sins. Contrary to the belief that sinners or at least unbelieving sinners will spend eternity in hell, 
&quot;there are numerous passages in the Holy Quran showing that those in hell shall ultimately be taken out&quot;. Whereas the word &quot;abad&quot; used in the Quran has been translated as &quot;eternity&quot;, it should be translated as &quot;a long time&quot;, and the actual purpose of suffering in hell should not be thought of as punishment of sinners, but the purging of &quot;the evil effects of their deeds done in this life&quot; for the sinners &quot;spiritual advancement&quot;. This is because in the afterlife, Muslims and Non-Muslims, even those &quot;who never did any good deeds&quot;, will eventually be taken out of hell.

===Modernism, postmodernism===
According to Smith and Haddad, &quot;The great majority of contemporary Muslim writers, ... choose not to discuss the afterlife at all&quot;. Islamic Modernists, according to Smith and Haddad, express a &quot;kind of embarrassment with the elaborate traditional detail concerning life in the grave and in the abodes of recompense, called into question by modern rationalists&quot;. Consequently, most of &quot;modern Muslim Theologians&quot; either &quot;silence the issue&quot; or reaffirm &quot;the traditional position that the reality of the afterlife must not be denied but that its exact nature remains unfathomable&quot;.

The beliefs of Pakistani modernist Muhammad Iqbal (died 1938), were similar to the Sufi &quot;spiritual and internalized interpretations of hell&quot; of ibn ʿArabī, and Rumi, seeing paradise and hell &quot;primarily as metaphors for inner psychic&quot; developments. Thus hellfire is actually a state of realization of one&#x27;s failures as a human being&quot;, and not a supernatural subterranean realm. Egyptian modernist Muhammad ʿAbduh, thought it was sufficient to believe in the existence of an afterlife with rewards and punishment to be a true believer, even if you ignored &quot;clear&quot; (&quot;ẓāhir&quot;) hadith about hell.

Some postmodernists have found at least one &quot;sahih&quot; (authentic) hadith on hell unacceptable—the tradition of Muhammad stating, &quot;most people in hell are women&quot; has been explained as an attempt to &quot;legitimate social control over women&quot; (Smith and Haddad), or perpetuate &quot;the moral, social, political, sectarian hierarchies&quot; of medieval Islam (Lange).

==Doubts and criticisms==

In modern times a number of criticisms have been made of the Islamic doctrine of hell: 
*the seeming relish with which the Quran and/or commentators detail &quot;the torture and the sufferings awaiting the sinners&quot;, the &quot;boiling water, running sores, peeling skin, burning flesh, dissolving bowels, and crushing of skulls with iron maces&quot;; what Christian Lange describes as indulging in &quot;phantasies of violence and pain&quot; which are &quot;often shockingly violent, and frequently obscene&quot;; Thomassen thinks shows an &quot;almost sadistic delight&quot;; and ibn Warraq finds out of character for a creator who begins all but two of the chapters of His holy book with the statement that God is merciful and compassionate. 
::Replies include that hell serves as deterrence. Fear of hell&#x27;s horror will strengthen the will of the morally weak to obey God and to turn away from the temptations of sinful pleasure and the pollution of unbelief; that the wholesome fear of God&#x27;s &quot;just punishments ... grounded in religious faith&quot; is very different than &quot;coercion and force&quot; (Mujtaba Musavi Lari). God created Paradise and Hell because &quot;the people should worship their Lord, desiring His reward and fearing of His torment.&quot; God being &quot;the Wisest of the judges&quot;, knows that his creations &quot;love security and benefits and hate misery and torture&quot; (Islamweb). 
*that the gruesome punishments of hell last for eternity, while the sins were committed over (some part) of a lifetime of a few decades. Antony Flew wonders if the &quot;infinite punishment&quot; of hell (where, for example, the skin of the damned being replaced with &quot;fresh skins&quot; when &quot;their skins are roasted through&quot; so that the process can continue for eternity Q.4:56), is out of proportion to the &quot;finite offenses&quot; of the damned. 
::Shia cleric Mujtaba Musavi Lari acknowledges that this &quot;presents a problem for many people&quot;, and offers a number of arguments: He notes that God&#x27;s &quot;essence is utterly pure of any trace of injustice&quot;, and reminds readers that &quot;utter justice prevails in God&#x27;s judging of men&quot;, with even small amounts of good being weighed in the balance; he quotes Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq that eternal punishment is appropriate because of the intention of the sinners was &quot;to persist in sin&quot; as long as they lived and if they had been &quot;made immortal in this world&quot; they would have kept on sinning indefinitely; and furthermore their sins may have long lasting consequences, and/or lead other humans &quot;to the wrong path&quot;, spreading sin all over.
*the standard doctrine that the eternal reward for non-believers is hell, &quot;irrespective of who they were and what they did.&quot; E. Thomassen writes that while the traditional idea that hell is punishment for unbelievers and Paradise the reward for Muslims plays &quot;an important role in the construction and maintenance&quot; of Muslim religious identity, it has &quot;become increasingly challenged&quot; by the &quot;common humanitarian values&quot; of global society. (One ex-Muslim – &quot;Abu Lahab&quot;—writing in The Guardian Editor press review, felt he was &quot;forced out of Islam&quot; because he could not accept the idea of eternal punishment of torture for non-Muslims. &quot;I found it hard to understand why every non-believer would end up&quot; in hell, no matter how kind and good they may have been.)
::Conservative scholars (Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid and his subordinates) emphasize Islamic doctrine in the judging of whether someone goes to Paradise or Hell: &quot;the point is not whether their morals are good, rather the point is whether they submit to Allaah ... and obey his commands.&quot; In answering an audience question, well-known preacher Zakir Naik compares the consigning to hell of otherwise righteous non-Muslims (like Mother Teresa), to giving a failing grade/mark to a student who scores 99 out of 100 in five of the six subjects they must pass, but fails one subject (comparing this to failing iman, i.e. Islamic faith). Jonathan Brown concludes an examination of the matter by saying &quot;anxiety over the fate&quot; of human beings after death (whether Muslims or non-Muslims) &quot;is best assuaged by trusting in God&#x27;s total justice and immense mercy&quot;. Finally, some, (such as Gabriel Said Reynolds) simply deny the traditional doctrine, arguing God will &quot;find goodness, even holiness, in those who do not practice Islam.&quot;.
::Abu Hamid al-Ghazali categorized non-Muslims into three categories:

::::1. People who never heard of the message, who live in far away lands, such as the Byzantines (&quot;Romans&quot;). These will be forgiven.
::::2. People who were exposed to a distorted understanding of Islam and have no recourse to correct that information. These too will be forgiven.
::::3. People who heard of Islam because they live in neighboring lands and mix with Muslims. These have no hope of salvation.

::He also wrote about non-Muslims who have heard a distorted message: &quot;The name of Muhammad has indeed reached their ears, but they do not know his true description and his character. Instead, they heard from the time they were young that a deceitful liar named Muhammad claimed to be a prophet. As far as I am concerned, such people are [excused] like those who the call of Islam has not reached, for while they have heard of the Prophet&#x27;s name, they heard the opposite of his true qualities. And hearing such things would never arouse one&#x27;s desire to find out who he was.&quot;

::Islamic scholars disagree on duration of Hell&#x27;s punishment. The common view holds that Hell will continue to exist for an eternity with some inhabitants, while others hold that Hell exists to purify rather than inflict pain, and may even cease to exist after a while.

*that God literally &quot;creates beings to fill hell with&quot;, punishing his creatures for actions beyond their power to control, as reflected in verses such as 
** &quot;If We had so willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but now My Word is realized—&#x27;I shall fill Hell with jinn and men together.&#x27;&quot; (Q.32.32.)
** &quot;God misleads whom He will and whom He will He guides.&quot; (Q.14:4) 
:and the logical conclusion of a world where God is omnipotent, controlling even the behavior of human beings. In the words of verse Q.9:51, 
:*&quot;By no means can anything befall us [his creatures] but what God has destined for us.&quot; 
:Michael Cook notes that &quot;compassion is conspicuously absent&quot; in these verses, and philosopher, political economist John Stuart Mill condemns the combination of predestination and hell as a &quot;dreadful idealization of wickedness.&quot;
::In reply the Hanafi fiqh fatwa site IslamQA states that predestination is one of those issues which God urges Muslims to &quot;abstain from&quot; speaking about &quot;as much as possible&quot;. &quot;We must believe in predestination, yet we cannot assume that our actions are entirely bound by it.&quot; Though &quot;everyone&#x27;s abode (for Jannat or Jahannam [i.e. for Paradise or Hell]) has been written&quot;, because God &quot;knows everything we have done&quot;, are currently doing, or will do in the future, nonetheless God has still &quot;given us the choice in everything&quot; we do.
::Based on Sunni traditions, God wrote everything that will happen (in all of his creation) on a &quot;tablet&quot; before creating the world. Thus it is asked: how can humans be punished for what God has determined they do. In this tradition, in Ashari thought, God created good and evil deeds, which humans decide upon—humans have their own possibility to choose, but God retains sovereignty of all possibilities. This still leaves the question of why God set out those people&#x27;s lives (or the negative choice of deeds) which result in Hell, and why God made it possible to become evil. In Islamic thought, evil is considered to be movement away from good, and God created this possibility so that humans are able to recognize good. (In contrast, angels are unable to move away from good, therefore angels generally rank lower than humans as they have reached heaven because they lack the ability to perceive the world as humans do.)

==Comparison with other religions==
=== Christianity ===
====Bible====

Some of the Quranic parables describing the sufferings in hell resemble those of the Christian New Testament.

The Book of Revelation describes a &quot;lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death&quot;, which most Christians believe to be a description of Hell, comparable to &quot;Jahannam&quot; as &quot;the fire&quot;. While the Quran describes &quot;Jahannam&quot; as having seven levels, each for different sins, the Bible (as regards the issue of levels), speaks of the &quot;lowest Hell (Sheol)&quot;. It also refers to a &quot;bottomless pit&quot;, comparable to the lowest layer of Jahannam in most Sunni traditions.

====Christian popular culture====

Just as Hell is often depicted as the seat of the devil in Christian culture (though not in the bible itself), so too some Islamic scholars describe it that way.

Al-Tha&#x27;alibis (961–1038) in his Qisas Al-Anbiya and Al-Suyutis &quot;Al-Hay&#x27;a as-samya fi l-hay&#x27;a as-sunmya&quot; describes Iblis as chained to the bottom of hell, commanding his hosts of demons from there. Also in the poetry of Al-Ma&#x27;arri, Iblis is the king of Jahannam. These depictions of Iblis as lord of hell simultaneously chained at its very bottom influenced Dante&#x27;s representation of Lucifer and gave rise to the Christian depiction of hell as the seat of the devil. &quot;Inferno&quot; by Dante also shares the Islamic idea of dividing hell into multiple &quot;circles&quot;. According to the Divine Comedy, each layer corresponding to another sin, with Satan inside a frozen area at the very bottom. As with Christian popular understanding of hell, &quot;ʿKitāb al-ʿAẓama&quot;, a popular cultural work, describes hell as inhabited not only by the &quot;Zabaniyya&quot; (guarding angels), but also by devils (&quot;shayatin&quot;), dwelling in the fourth layer of hell and rising up from coffins to torture the sinners.

As evident from late Ottoman poetry, the notion of Iblis ruling hell remained in Islamic popular tradition until modern times. In one of Ğabdulla Tuqay&#x27;s works, Iblis&#x27; current abode in hell is compared to working in factories during Industrial Revolution. When Iblis gets weary about Hell, he remembers his time in Heaven. According to Salafi shaikh Osama al-Qusi, Iblis scolds the inhabitants of hell from a &quot;minbar&quot;, how they could have listened to him, knowing it is his nature to deceive them.

Notably, Iblis&#x27; temporary rule over Jahannam depends always on God&#x27;s power and hell is still a form of punishment for Iblis himself. (&quot;We have appointed only ˹stern˺ angels as wardens of the Fire.&quot; according to Q.74:31) Einar Thomassen points out that Iblis is chained to the floor of hell as punishment, whereas Malik is head of the 19 angels who guard hell, indicating it is the angels who are in charge and not the devils.

====Christian Liberalism====
In modern times some Christians and Christian denominations (such as Universalism) have rejected the concept of hell as a place of suffering and torment for sinners on the grounds that it is incompatible with a loving God. There are also symbolic and more merciful interpretations of hell among Muslims. Muslims Mouhanad Khorchide and Faheem Younus write that since the Quran states that God has &quot;prescribed to himself mercy&quot;, and &quot;... for him whose scales (of good deeds) are light. Hell will be his mother,&quot; suffering in Jahannam is not a product of vengeance and punishment, but a temporary phenomenon as the sinner is &quot;transformed&quot; in the process of confronting the truth about themselves. The idea of annihilation of hell was already introduced earlier by traditionalistic scholars, such as Ibn Taimiyya. However, according to at least one source—Christian evangelist Phil Parshall, who spent several decades observing and writing about Muslims in Asia—this has not been the common view of Muslims; Parshall writes that he &quot;never met a Muslim who has attempted to undercut the bluntness and severity of their doctrine of hell.&quot;

=== Judeo-Islamic sources ===
Arabic texts written by Jews in Judeo-Arabic script (particularly those which are identified with the Isra&#x27;iliyyat genre in the study of hadith) also feature descriptions of Jahannam (or Jahannahum). These seem to have been strongly influenced by the Islamic environment in which they were composed, and may be considered as holding many of the same concepts as those today identified with Islamic eschatology. A Judeo-Arabic version of a popular narrative known as &quot;The Story of the Skull&quot; (whose earliest version is attributed to Ka&#x27;ab al-Ahbar) offers a detailed picture of the concept of Jahannam. Here, &quot;Malak al-Mawt&quot; (the Angel of Death) and a number of sixty angels seize the soul of the dead and begin torturing him with fire and iron hooks. Two black angels named Nākir and Nakīr (identified with Munkar and Nakir in Islamic eschatology) strike the dead with a whip of fire and take him to the &quot;lowest level&quot; of Jahannam. Then, they order the Earth to swallow and crush the dead inside its womb, saying: &quot;Seize him and take revenge, because he has stolen Allāh&#x27;s wealth and worshipped others than Him&quot;. Following this, the dead is brought before the dais of God where a herald calls for throwing the dead into Jahannam. There he is put in shackles sixty cubits long and into a leather sackcloth full of snakes and scorpions.

The Judeo-Arabic legend in question explains that the dead is set free from the painful perogatory after twenty-four years. In a final quote alluding to Isaiah 58.8, the narrative states that &quot;nothing will help Man on the last day except good and loving actions, deeds of giving charity to widows, orphans, the poor and the unfortunate.&quot;

Some Jewish sources such as Jerahmeel provide descriptive detail of hell-like places, divided into multiple levels; usually Sheol, which is translated as a grave or pit, is the place where humans descend upon death.

=== Zoroastrianism ===
Like Islam, Zoroastrianism, holds that on Judgement Day all resurrected souls will pass over a bridge over hell (As-Sirāt in Islam, Chinvat Bridge in Zoroastrianism), and those destined for hell will find it too narrow and fall below into their new abode.

=== Hinduism ===
In terms of a finite hell, as asserted by some Sufi thinkers, conceived as a circulation of beginning and reset, the cosmology resembles the Hindu notion of an eternal cosmic process of generation, decay, and destruction.

A detailed description of the journey of the soul and the punishments of Hell (Naraka) are detailed in the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot;.

===Buddhism===
Some descriptions of Jahannam resemble Buddhist descriptions of Naraka from Mahayana sutras in regard of destroying inhabitants of hell physically, while their consciousness still remains and after the body is destroyed, it will regenerate again, thus the punishment will repeat. However, according to Buddhist belief, beings in Hell have a limited lifespan, as with all beings trapped in the cycle of Samsara; they will ultimately exhaust their bad karma, experience death, and be reborn in a higher realm.

<text>Jackson Bay / Okahu () is a gently curving bay on the southern West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It faces the Tasman Sea to the north, and is backed by the Southern Alps. It contains the settlements of Hannahs Clearing, Waiatoto, Neils Beach, and the fishing village of Jackson Bay at its western end. The bay is the southernmost terminus of the West Coast&#x27;s roads.

== Toponymy ==
Jackson Bay was named Open Bay by Captain Cook; the origins of its current name are obscure. Possible namesake sources include: Port Jackson, New South Wales; James Hayter Jackson, a local whaler; or William Jackson, a sealer said to have been part of a party that was marooned in the area in 1810. In the early years of settlement, the bay was known as Jackson&#x27;s Bay, later losing its possessive. Following the passage of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the name of the bay was officially altered to Jackson Bay / Okahu.

== History ==
Jackson Bay and the mouth of the Arawhata River was home to a Māori settlement for hundreds of years. Māori harvested fish and seals, and gathered the valuable pounamu (greenstone) that originated in the Red Hills inland. When the explorer John Boultbee visited the bay in 1826, the settlement&#x27;s population was about 300, but it had declined by the time Europeans began to settle the area, and was abandoned in 1866.

In 1842, the whaler Thomas Chaseland set up a shore whaling station at Jackson Bay, a spot he knew from his days as a sealer, to target migrating whales such as southern right and humpbacks. On the foreshore of Jackson Bay is a grave and marker for Claude Ollivier of the schooner &quot;Ada&quot;, who died in Jackson Bay on 27 August 1862.

Jackson Bay was chosen in 1874 as the site of a government-supported settlement under the assisted immigrant programme. A plan for a seaport named Arawata was drawn up by Westland chief surveyor Gerhard Mueller. The plans included a network of streets crossing the peninsula and hugging the cliffs, and a waterfront esplanade. The vision for the settlement was a thriving port that would support fishing, forestry, mining, and the farming and settlement of the nearby river flats. The immigrants (Poles, Irish, Italians, Scandinavians, Germans, and English) arrived in 1875, and immediately ran into difficulties. Flat land was hard to come by and was infertile and frequently flooded; the rainfall, sandflies, and isolation took their toll; and there was no wharf or road. Within three years, most of the settlers had departed.

A wharf was finally built in Jackson Bay in 1938, so road-building machinery could be landed for the construction of the Haast highway. A road was built from Jackson Bay to Haast, and then upriver over the Haast Pass. The wharf allowed a timber and fishing industry to start, but milling proved uneconomic as there were still plenty of forest being felled closer to the main timber markets.

After Cyclone Fehi in 2018 the Westland District Council added a rock wall to the esplanade, and the wharf was upgraded in 2021 as part of a $150 million of West Coast targeted funding from the Provincial Growth Fund.

== Geography ==

=== Setting ===
This bay is the only sheltered harbour between Greymouth, north, and Milford Sound, south (although &quot;sheltered&quot; is a relative term, as it is fully exposed to northerly storms). The waters off the coast are particularly productive, marking the convergence of the cool West Wind Drift and the warm Westland Current.

The westernmost point of Jackson Bay is marked by the headland Jackson Head; in the northeast the end of the bay is less well defined, but corresponds roughly with the mouths of the Turnbull and Okuru Rivers. The small Open Bay Islands Taumaka and Popotai lie off the coast at this point.

The bay marks a major change in the terrain of the west coast. To the north, narrow fertile plains lie between the mountains and the sea, allowing for dairy and deer farming. To the south, the coastal plains disappear as the land becomes steeper and more mountainous. Within , the first of the deep glacial valleys that further south become the fiords of Fiordland start to become evident, with Lake McKerrow at the foot of the Hollyford Track.

From the junction with State Highway 6 at Haast, to the northeast, a small road travels southwest, crosses the Okura and Waiatoto Rivers, turns northwest after crossing the Arawhata River|Arawhata (or Arawata) River, and terminates at the settlement of Jackson Bay.

===Climate===

== Economy ==
The settlement of Jackson Bay is New Zealand&#x27;s closest harbour to Australia, and supports a fishing industry of small boats catching mostly tuna and spiny lobster (known in New Zealand as crayfish or koura), although not many of the fishers live in the bay. The settlement contains about 30 dwellings, but few permanent residents, and in the summer so many recreational fishers come with their boats from Central Otago or Queenstown for a weekend&#x27;s fishing that local iwi Te Rūnanga o Makaawhio have discussed setting up &quot;mataitai&quot; (marine reserves).

Located on the foreshore is The Craypot, a fish-and-chip stand and one of the main tourist attractions of the settlement. Originally constructed in Timaru as a pie cart, it was moved to Cromwell to support the construction of the Clyde Dam in the 1980s. The Cromwell pie cart was sold to a Haast local, who towed it over the Haast Pass behind a tractor and set it up on the Jackson Bay waterfront.

== Important bird area ==

The stretch of coastline from Jackson Head for about westwards to the mouth of the Stafford River has been identified as an Important Bird Area because it supports a breeding population of Fiordland penguins.

<text>The Danbury Fair (also known as The Great Danbury State Fair) was a yearly exhibition in Danbury, Connecticut. It was begun in 1821 as an agricultural fair, but did not have a regular schedule until 1869 when hat manufacturers Rundle and White helped form the Danbury Farmers and Manufacturers Society. From then until its closing, the fair was open for ten days every October.

The fair took up 142 acres (0.57 km²) of what Rundle and White had hoped would be a Danbury Pleasure Park. Admission was 25 cents for adults and 15 cents for children. The fair offered everything from tobacco, pears, and home-brewed wines to hats, boots, saddles, carriages, wagons, churns, and stoves. In 1895, more than 1000 people were employed by the fair.

In 1932, a race track was built on the fairgrounds for the midget car and stock car races that had replaced the earlier harness races.

During the 1950s through 1970s, the fair&#x27;s multiple attractions included New England Village, Dutch Village, lumberjack competitions, oxen draws, sheep shearing contests, music and dancing, puppet shows, animal petting zoos, rides and games, displays of farm machinery, and food and livestock exhibits and judging.

When the fair&#x27;s owner John Leahy died in 1975, the organization fell into disarray. The escalating value of the land led to the assessment of high estate taxes that compelled the organization to sell it. Meanwhile, due to its prime location, outside entities increasingly expressed interest in purchasing the land, and the amounts they offered to buy it regularly increased. The last day of the fair was October 12, 1981, with an estimated 400,000 people having attended that year. All of the rides, attractions, and holdings were auctioned off. The Danbury Fair Mall was built on the fairgrounds by the Wilmorite Corporation. Photos of the fair and original signs used to be found in the mall&#x27;s food court.

The fair featured large fiberglass sculptures of characters such as Uncle Sam and Paul Bunyan. Many of these were purchased after the fair was closed, and continue to exist. Notably, Jack Gillette purchased hundreds of objects to put on display at the Magic Forest amusement park in Lake George, New York. (Photo of Uncle Sam at Magic Forest in Lake George, New York). The sculpture of Uncle Sam is 38 feet tall and is claimed to be the tallest Uncle Sam in the world. The Uncle Sam statue returned to its home in Danbury in 2019 and is located at the Danbury Railway Museum. The sculpture of Paul Bunyan was manufactured by International Fiberglass, which mass-produced identical sculptures to sell to stores such as tire or muffler shops (thus the sculptures are generally referred to as Muffler Men). The Danbury Fair Paul Bunyan was eventually painted like a &quot;hippy&quot; and moved to Max Yasgur&#x27;s Farm in Bethel, New York (home of annual Woodstock reunions). It has since returned to Danbury.

<text>Flairck was a Dutch musical ensemble formed in 1978 by guitar virtuoso Erik Visser. and multi-instrumentalist Peter Weekers. The group had varying members, depending on the project. Their musical style was a blend of folk music, jazz and classical chamber music, with touches of blues. The music written by the members of the ensemble was often centred on an album theme and was played with a wide variety of acoustic instruments.

The name of the band was derived from the French word &quot;flair&quot; and the Dutch word &quot;vlerk&quot;, which means &#x27;a nimble fingered hand&#x27; or &#x27;wing&#x27;, but also &#x27;rowdy young man&#x27;.

== History ==
Flairck started as an instrumental group, playing acoustic instruments and composing the majority of its own material. They play a form of chamber music, classically influenced new &quot;traditional&quot; music.

The group played in many countries, including Indonesia, Japan, Australia, and North and South America. The group toured France with Georges Moustaki and recorded an album with producer Mike Batt and singer Maggie Reilly (&quot;Sleight of Hand&quot;, EMI).

After two years of preparation Flairck released its first album in 1978. &quot;Variations on a Lady&quot; went platinum in the Netherlands and received three awards, including an Edison. The second album, &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Back&quot; (1979), went gold and received several distinctions including an Edison. Over the years Flairck has released 17 albums. The third album, &quot;Live in Amsterdam&quot;, was released in 1980, &quot;Circus&quot; in 1981, &quot;Flairck and Orchestra&quot; and &quot;Moustaki and Flairck&quot; in 1982, &quot;Bal Masque&quot; in 1984, &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot; in 1985, &quot;Encore&quot; in 1986 and &quot;The Emigrant&quot; in 1988. In February 1989 (for 1988) Flairck received the Gouden Harp (Golden Harp).

&quot;Alive&quot;, a live double CD, was released in 1990. &quot;The Parade&quot; (1992) was based on the paintings of the Dutch medieval painter Hieronymus Bosch and the CD &quot;Chambers&quot; (1994) on the work of the Belgian surrealist René Magritte. In 1995 the CD &quot;The Chilean Concerts&quot; was recorded and released in South America. &quot;The Golden Age&quot; (1996) was set in the 17th century and based on the true story of the VOC sailing ship &quot;Batavia. In 1997 the group spent three months in Chile composing and recording music for the photographer Roberto Edwards&#x27; project &quot;Cuerpos Pintados&quot;. In 1998 the tour &quot;Lijf&quot; celebrated the 20th anniversary of Flairck. In 1999 the &quot;Symphony for the Old World&quot; incorporated 9 musicians, including 4 soloists from the four corners of Europe. The CD and video &quot;Symphony for the Old World&quot; were released in 2000.

&quot;Circus Hieronymus Bosch&quot;, a cooperation with acrobatics theatre group &#x27;Corpus&#x27; and based on the paintings of the Dutch mediaeval painter Hieronymus Bosch, premiered in 2001, in Den Bosch, followed by more than 80 concerts in the Netherlands and Belgium. &quot;Circus Hieronymus Bosch&quot; was recorded as a DVD and released in 2002.

Because of the success of this unusual circus show the cooperation between Flairck and Corpus continued the following year, resulting in the opera &quot;Lucia the Moucheron&quot;, which premiered on 21 September 2002 in Middelburg.

In 2003 and 2004 Flairck stopped touring for the first time in its 25-year history. Erik Visser took the time to polish some old scores: together with editor Piet Zweers he prepared the final musical scores of &quot;Symphony for the Old World&quot;, &quot;Circus Hieronymus Bosch&quot; and &quot;Lucia de Moucheron&quot;. Flairck released these music books online.

In 2004 and 2005 Erik Visser worked on a solo tour called &quot;The One Man Parade&quot; traveling through 45 Dutch theaters.

In January 2014 Flairck returned to Chile to lead World Music Festival 2014 (Festival de Músicas del Mundo 2014), performing in Santiago, Viña del Mar and Concepción.

In 2017, Pablo Ortiz teamed up with new musicians to form the next generation of Flairck. The new line-up started to present new compositions while empowering Flairck’s characteristic acoustic sound.

In 2020, hindered by the global pandemic, Flairck started a crowdfunding campaign for their new album. More than 60 people pitched in and Flairck released their first new album in years, &quot;Back Alive&quot;.

In October 2022, the newest line-up announced that they would no longer be performing under the name &quot;Flairck&quot; and instead would be performing under the name Motyk.

<text>Samuel Crompton (3 December 1753 – 26 June 1827) was an English inventor and pioneer of the spinning industry. Building on the work of James Hargreaves and Richard Arkwright, he invented the spinning mule, a machine that revolutionised the industry worldwide.

== Early life ==
Samuel Crompton was born at 10 Firwood Fold, Bolton, Lancashire to George and Betty Crompton (née Elizabeth Holt of Turton). His father was a caretaker at nearby Hall i&#x27; th&#x27; Wood. Samuel had two younger sisters. While he was a boy he lost his father and had to contribute to the family resources by spinning yarn, learning to spin on James Hargreaves&#x27;s spinning jenny. The deficiencies of the jenny imbued him with the idea of devising something better, which he worked on in secret for five or six years. The effort absorbed all his spare time and money, including that which he earned by playing the violin at the Bolton theatre.

On 16 February 1780 at Bolton Parish Church, Crompton married Mary Pimlott (or Pimbley). They had eight children including George Crompton (born 8 January 1781), who followed in the family business.

==Spinning mule==
About 1779, Samuel Crompton succeeded in producing a mule-jenny, a machine which spun yarn suitable for use in the manufacture of muslin. It was known as the &quot;muslin wheel&quot; or the &quot;Hall i&#x27; th&#x27; Woodwheel&quot;, from the name of the house in which he and his family now lived. The mule-jenny later became known as the spinning mule. There was a strong demand for the yarn which Crompton was making at Hall i&#x27; th&#x27; Wood but he lacked the means to take out a patent. The prying into his methods forced Crompton to choose between destroying his machine or making it public. He adopted the latter alternative after promises by a number of manufacturers to pay him for the use of the mule. He then resumed spinning on his own account, but with indifferent success.

The mule-jenny twisted the rovings using rollers in the manner of Arkwright&#x27;s frame, while the spindle carriage moved back and forth 54 inches to stretch the thread, and then to gather it in the spinning spindles in the manner of Hargreaves jenny. The mule&#x27;s importance was that it could spin thread better than could be done by hand, which led to ever finer thread. Coarse thread (40s) sold for 14 shillings per pound whilst (80s) spun on his mule sold at 42 shillings a pound.

As the mule was unpatented others soon manufactured it. The machine was constructed in iron, power was applied to assist the inward motion in 1790 and by 1834 it was fully automatic or self-acting. A survey in 1812 showed there were between 4 and 5 million mule spindles in use. Crompton received no royalties for his invention.

In 1800, a sum of £500 was raised for his benefit by subscription, and when in 1809, Edmund Cartwright, the inventor of the power loom, obtained £10,000 from parliament, Crompton was determined to apply for a grant. In 1811, he toured the manufacturing districts of Lancashire and Scotland to collect evidence showing how extensively his mule was being used, and in 1812 parliament awarded him £5000. With the aid of this money, Crompton started a business as a bleacher and then as a cotton merchant and spinner, but without success. In 1824, some friends and members (including Isaac and Benjamin Dobson, Benjamin Hick, John Kennedy and Peter Rothwell) of Bolton&#x27;s Black Horse &quot;prosecution&quot; Club, bought him an annuity of £63 without his knowledge.

Crompton died at his house in King Street, Bolton on 26 June 1827, and was buried at the parish church of St Peter&#x27;s.

<doc id="607934" wikidata="Q5325852" url="?curid=607934" title="Earl Faison">
<text>Earl Faison (January 31, 1939 – June 12, 2016) was an American professional football player who was a defensive end in the American Football League (AFL) between 1960 and 1966. He spent most of his career with the San Diego Chargers.

==Career==
Drafted by both the Detroit Lions of the National Football League and the Los Angeles Chargers of the AFL, Faison signed with the Chargers as a first-round pick immediately after the conclusion of the East–West Shrine Game on December 31, 1960.

The 6-foot-5, 260 pound Faison had been an All-American at Indiana University, playing on both offense and defense. After entering the pro ranks, he worked with Chargers&#x27; assistant coach Chuck Noll to continually blow past opposing offensive lineman on his way to smashing American Football League quarterbacks.

Faison was a member of the original &quot;&quot;Fearsome Foursome&quot;&quot; (the Chargers&#x27; defensive line) from 1961 to 1966. The &quot;Foursome&quot; was made up of Faison and Chargers Hall of Fame linemate Ernie Ladd, with alternate members of the group including Bob Petrich, Ron Nery, George Gross, Bill Hudson and Henry Schmidt.

Despite often being double and triple-teamed, Faison was chosen as the American Football League Rookie of the Year and All-AFL in 1961. He missed the early portion of the 1962 season, after suffering a knee injury, then reported late the following year after a contract dispute. The contract problems would resurface in 1965, but his performance remained good enough to continue a string of five consecutive All-Star seasons in the league from 1961 to 1965.

On January 15, 1966, Faison and Ladd were dealt to the Houston Oilers as part of a five-player trade, but four days later, the trade was nullified because of tampering by Oilers&#x27; owner Bud Adams. In response, Faison looked to the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Toronto Argonauts, but eventually signed a three-year $90,000 contract with the Chargers on July 29.

The bitter contract problems, coupled with Faison&#x27;s back problems, continued to linger until October 18 when Faison was released by the Chargers. In announcing the dismissal, head coach Sid Gillman bitterly noted that Faison, &quot;has a long way to go to become average.&quot; One day later, the expansion Miami Dolphins signed Faison for the remainder of the year.

On June 27, 1967, Faison was involved in a seven-player trade which sent him to the Denver Broncos, although 10 days later, the team returned him to the Dolphins, who then placed him on waivers on July 24. Faison&#x27;s release led him to file a lawsuit against Miami on October 6, citing breach of contract. Claiming his three-year contract entitled him to the remaining $60,000 over two years, Faison was ultimately unsuccessful in his lawsuit.

A member of the Chargers Hall of Fame, Faison was also inducted into the Indiana University Hall of Fame in 1990. In his post-playing career, Faison briefly dabbled in acting, including and a pair of appearances in The Beverly Hillbillies. He then returned to California as an educator and football coach, and while at Lincoln High School, he served as head coach during the era of future Pro Football Hall of Famer Marcus Allen before eventually serving as the school&#x27;s principal. He later coached P.E. at Muirlands Junior High School in La Jolla. It was there that he coined the term &quot;grabasser&quot; for unruly students. Faison later went on to become the Vice Principal at University City High School in San Diego.

Earl Faison is a member of The Pigskin Club Of Washington, D.C. National Intercollegiate All-American Football Players Honor Roll.

In 1997, Faison was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego&#x27;s finest athletes both on and off the playing surface. Faison was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1989.

He died on June 12, 2016, in Prescott, Arizona.

<text>Karamea is a town on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It is the northernmost settlement of any real size on the West Coast, and is located northeast by road from Westport. Apart from a narrow coastal strip, the town of Karamea and its local area are completely surrounded to the south, east and north by Kahurangi National Park.

The town is located on the coastal plain adjacent to the Karamea River and the Ōtūmahana Estuary. The town consists of two small settlements, Market Cross and Karamea proper, located about apart. Up the Karamea River are the farming areas of Arapito (on the south bank) and Umere (on the north bank).

Karamea is a gateway to the Kahurangi National Park, and provides a base for visitors coming to walk or mountain bike the Heaphy Track, or see popular local attractions such as the Ōpārara Basin, Ōpārara Arches, the Fenian Track and caves, the Big Rimu Walk and the coastal scenery north of Kōhaihai on the Heaphy Track.

== Toponymy ==
The name &quot;Karamea&quot; is Māori – despite local jokes suggesting it was named by an Italian for his love – and is thought to either mean &quot;red ochre&quot; or be a corruption of &quot;Kakara taramea&quot;, &quot;the smell of speargrass leaves.&quot; The name is used for the township and also for the surrounding area.

==History==
Large shell middens have been found in the area. Radiocarbon dating indicates that these middens are associated with occupation in the period AD 1400 to AD 1600. The evidence suggests that the site was used by Māori as a temporary stopping place on the route down the coast to collect pounamu.

The mouth of the Heaphy River is the site of an early Māori encampment dating back to perhaps 1380 AD, and there is evidence it was one of the few sites in the northwest South Island occupied by people for extended periods of time. There is significant evidence of stoneworking, including local pounamu as well as argillite, obsidian, and chert imported from elsewhere in Aotearoa. The significance of the site to Ngāi Tahu led to it being excluded from Kahurangi National Park.

The first Europeans and Chinese would have been early gold-miners in the 1860s.

=== Special Settlement Area ===
In the early 1870s, the Nelson Provincial Government investigated the use of Special Settlement Areas as a way of developing remote parts of the province, and attracting immigrants. The conditions to be offered to immigrants included the offer of land on deferred payment terms, and the opportunity of partial employment by the Provincial Government for the first year after the immigrants arrived. The allotments of land would be between forty and two hundred acres to each head of family, and be open to those already in the Colony, as well as new immigrants. The Nelson Special Settlements Act was passed on 25 October 1872, to allow the scheme to proceed, but there were disputes with central government about allowing the scheme to extend to those already resident.

Prior to 1874, the Nelson Province had not been significantly involved in the immigration schemes organised by the Colonial Government, but in October of that year, around 250 adults arrived in Nelson seeking work, and another shipload of immigrants was on the way. There was insufficient work available to employ all these immigrants, and the province turned again to Special Settlement Areas as a solution. Karamea was chosen as a site for a Special Settlement Area partly because the area was already known from a gold rush 7 years earlier, but also that it had a harbour, and there were steamers passing regularly along the coast. By November 1874, a block of land of had been reserved on the south side of the Karamea River, and in April 1875 a further was reserved on the north side of the Karamea River . The planning of the settlement was placed under the control of Eugene O&#x27;Conor, Provincial Secretary, and member of the New Zealand House of Representatives.

The settlers at Karamea were mostly immigrants from four ships that arrived at Nelson between August 1874 and February 1875. The first settlers to arrive in Karamea were landed from the steamer &quot;Charles Edward&quot;, on 27 November 1874. Most of the 20 men who were landed had no experience of breaking in new land. They were initially allocated small sections of pakihi – flat boggy land with infertile, waterlogged soil high up on a terrace to the south of the Karamea River. Better land was found on the Karamea River flats below the terrace, but there were delays before this land was allocated. Women and children arrived in January 1875.

In October 1875, using labour from the settlers, work began on creating an inland track over the hills between Little Wanganui and Mohikinui to bypass the difficult and dangerous coastal track. The road to Karamea over the hilly section (known as the Karamea bluffs) north of Mokihinui, was not opened until 1916.

=== Murchison earthquake ===
The Murchison earthquake on 17 June 1929 caused severe damage in the Karamea area, with all roads in the district closed and nearly all bridges damaged. Houses were badly damaged, with no chimneys left standing, and some houses burnt down. The wharf and wharf sheds were also badly damaged. The road from Westport to Karamea was severely damaged by large landslides, and telephone lines were broken completely isolating the town. A party travelled on foot from Karamea to Westport to report the damage. The earthquake disrupted efforts underway at the time to control an outbreak of diphtheria in the settlement, and it was necessary for serum to be delivered by air. The earthquake caused the silting up of the harbour and cut the community&#x27;s road link for about two years. The reconstruction of the road over the hilly section between Mokihinui and Little Wanganui required a workforce up to 400 men at times. Small coastal vessels were used to transport people and supplies between Westport and the Karamea harbour while the road was rebuilt.

=== Dairy farming ===

Dairy farming in the area began with the opening of the first Karamea Co-operative Dairy Company in 1893. This company struggled with payouts to farmers less than expectations and the venture was wound up in March 1897. There was no further progress until 1906, when J Curtin &amp; Co opened a butter factory near the site of the 1893 plant. A newly formed Karamea Co-operative Dairy Company was established in 1911, to purchase the Curtin&#x27;s factory. The new company received its first cream for processing on 20 September 1911. Approximately 40 tonnes was produced in the first year. There was no road out of Karamea at the time, so all the production had to be shipped on vessels that were capable of crossing the Karamea bar.

In 1935, the Karamea dairy factory was manufacturing 300 tonnes of butter annually. The industry slowly expanded, and milk powder was manufactured locally from the 1970s. Local processing eventually ceased, and milk is now transported by road tanker to Hokitika.

== Geography ==
=== Setting ===
Karamea is north of Westport on State Highway 67. The town is situated on a coastal plain adjacent to the mouth of the Karamea River and the Ōtūmahana Estuary in Karamea Bight, a large bay formed by the curve of coastline for north from Cape Foulwind, to the Heaphy River. Apart from a narrow coastal strip, the town of Karamea and its local area are completely surrounded to the south, east and north by Kahurangi National Park.

There are two main areas of residential accommodation and businesses on the north side of the Karamea River. These are Market Cross and the settlement of Karamea itself. These two locations are around apart. On the south side of the river, and inland, is the small settlement of Arapito, and across the river from it is the settlement of Umere. These were originally called &quot;Promised Land&quot; and &quot;Land of Promise&quot;, respectively, when they were settled around 1880.

The mouth of the Ōpārara River is around north of the centre of Karamea.

Little Wanganui is a small dairy farming village located south of Karamea. It has a surfing beach and a river popular for whitebaiting and fishing.

=== Ōtūmahana estuary ===

There is a large estuary known as Ōtūmahana, at the mouth of the Karamea River. This estuary is also the mouth of Baker Creek and Granite Creek. The combined river mouths have formed a shallow mudflat and salt marsh estuary with an area of approximately . This type of environment is vulnerable and is nationally uncommon. The estuary is an important feeding and breeding area for birds and fish.

The estuary is the third largest tidal estuary on the West Coast, after Ōkārito Lagoon and Saltwater Lagoon. It has been classified as a Significant Wetland by the West Coast Regional Council in its Regional Land and Water Plan. A small specially protected area of wetland known as Ōtūmahana Reserve was established at the south-east corner of the estuary in 1983.

A life-size bronze statue of the extinct Haast&#x27;s eagle or hōkioi was erected in Karamea in 2020. The initiative was a joint undertaking of the Karamea Estuary Enhancement Project and local iwi Ngāti Apa ki te Rā Tō and Ngāti Waewae. The hōkioi represents the spiritual guardian of the estuary. The statue is called &quot;Te Maia Kahurangi&quot;, and was unveiled on 22 February 2020. It depicts the ancestor Te Maia who rode an eagle he raised from a chick. It was cast in bronze by Gillie and Marc and is 300 cm high.

===Karamea River===

The Karamea River has a catchment area, including its tributaries, of , representing around 23% of the entire area of Kahurangi National Park.

There is a history of the river causing flooding in the township. In 1899, a large flood swept away a new bridge across the river and caused damage to settlers homes, farms and crops. Another major flood caused serious damage in January 1915, inundating the main street and the majority of houses.

The Murchison earthquake on 17 June 1929 led to debris blocking the existing mouth of the Karamea River, and a new outlet to the sea formed from the Ōtūmahana lagoon around to the south of the existing outlet. Deposits of silt raised the level of the river bed and led to a greatly increased risk of flooding in the townships of Karamea and Market Cross. On 30 December 1929 there was heavy damage in Karamea and Arapito from a sudden flood attributed to the breach of a dam created during the earthquake. In April 1931, floodwaters entered most of the homes around Market Cross, and some in the Karamea township. In August 1931, the settlers were given access to relief funding from the West Coast Earthquake Relief Fund for the damage caused by these floods.

Over the next few years, stop banks and training walls were constructed on the north side of the river to help mitigate the flood risk to the town. In May 1936 the Karamea School Committee notified the Education Board of their concerns about the damage caused by repeated flooding of the school. Relocation to a new site was proposed. In October 1936 there was a further major flood that entered 40 houses in Karamea and Market Cross. In September 1937, a large flood led to the river breaking through to the sea at the location of the old river mouth, cutting a new channel that greatly reduced the flood risk to the town and enabled the entry of vessels at high tide. Further river protection works were installed between 1938 and 1940, and these successfully defended the township during a heavy flood in the river in February 1940.

Survey records since 1912 indicate that there have been either single or double openings to the sea from the Ōtūmahana Estuary, and that these openings have migrated over of shoreline since records began. Between 2008 and 2010, the two openings merged at a location giving a direct exit from the Karamea River to the sea. From December 2010, the combined opening migrated south. Between 2013 and 2015, the channel moved further south by over . In 2016, the channel was south of the most direct route from the river to the sea. This southern location of the channel increases the risk of flooding in some areas of Karamea. A report to the West Coast Regional Council in 2016 recommended mechanical excavation of a breach channel to allow the next major flood to cut a new direct route to the sea, and mitigate the flood risk. Breach channels were constructed at the north end of the spit and a direct path was opened to the sea in 2017. The Regional Council cautioned that further interventions could be required in future to keep the outlet in a northern location.

=== Environmental restoration ===
In July 2020, the West Coast Regional council secured funding to support Clean Streams Karamea, a locally based not-for-profit environmental group. The funding will enable the raising and planting of 315,000 trees along of riparian margins of waterways through farms. The project is expected to take 3–5 years.

== Economy ==
In 2020, it was reported that Karamea had a GDP of $26.8m, with 199 jobs in 111 businesses. Dairy farming and tourism are the main economic drivers, and the service industry employs approximately a quarter of the workforce. Other former industries in the area include sphagnum moss, possum control, fishing, and fine furniture production. Horticultural tomato growers and a plant nursery also provide income. Fruit grown in the area includes tamarillo, which can be grown here due to the area&#x27;s mild and frost-free microclimate.

In 2020, it was reported that there had been a significant increase in the local population, with increasing demand for housing, and an increase in the roll at Karamea Area School.

==Attractions==
Tourists visit Karamea all year round to enjoy the many scenic attractions in the region, including Kahurangi National Park. Tourism is a fast-growing segment of the local economy, and the region has been said to be &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s best-kept secret&quot;.

=== Walking tracks ===
The southern end of the Heaphy Track, one of New Zealand&#x27;s nine &quot;Great Walks&quot;, is at the Kōhaihai River, about north of Karamea. The western end of the Wangapeka Track is near Little Wanganui, around south of Karamea.

Popular attractions in the area include the Ōpārara Basin, (including the Ōpārara Basin Arches), Honeycomb Hill Cave, Fenian Track and caves, and the Big Rimu Walk.

=== Mountain biking ===
Karamea provides a base for transport and accommodation for visitors coming to the area for mountain biking. Prior to the establishment of Kahurangi National Park in 1996, mountain biking was a popular activity on the Heaphy Track. In the final 12 months before the North West Nelson Forest Park became a National Park, around 2,000 mountain bikers completed the route. At the time, the National Parks Act 1980 did not permit mountain biking in National Parks, other than on formed roads. Lobbying activities to allow the return of mountain biking on the Heaphy Track continued through until 2011, when a three-year trial began. The trial permitted mountain biking during the winter season from 1 May to 30 September. The mountain bike trial period ended in 2016 and mountain biking became a permanent option over the colder part of the year. Mountain biking the Heaphy Track is now allowed each year from 1 May to 30 November for groups not exceeding six riders.

== Transport ==
Karamea is north of Westport on State Highway 67. There is no other connecting road to the town – the road north ends at the Kōhaihai River some from Karamea, at the southwestern end of the Heaphy Track. As at 2018, the road to Karamea was funded by Waka Kotahi via a special purpose road funding category, but the agency signalled that this funding category could end by 2024.

Air transport is available from Karamea Aerodrome. Golden Bay Air flies from Karamea to from Wellington, Takaka and Nelson. There is also a helicopter charter service at the aerodrome.

== Amenities ==

Karamea township offers local services including a general store, supermarket, petrol pumps, information centre, cafe, hotel, camping ground, motels, backpackers, art &amp; craft shop, and a community library. 

The Karamea War Memorial Library was opened in 1954 and for decades shared its building with the Plunket rooms. It expanded to occupy the whole building in the mid 1990s, and now operates as an entirely volunteer-run library with approximately 50 subscriptions.The Karamea Centennial Museum is a small museum opened in 1974. The museum collections include photographs and exhibits on the local industries of sawmilling, dairying, gold mining, flax milling and shipping.

Until 1908 there was no church in Karamea; services were conducted in private homes, and a minister would visit from Westport or Mokihinui, often having to take an arduous coastal route along beaches and rocks. After the death by drowning in August 1906 of the crew of the Rangi while taking soundings on the Karamea Bar, the Westport vicar Rev Dart held services. He suggested locals might like to acquire a memorial, such as an organ, but the people of Karamea organised the construction of a church, taking three months and costing £69. The Holy Trinity Church was dedicated on 24 June 1908, and has stayed an interdenonominational community church ever since.

==Education==
Karamea Area School is a coeducational composite school (years 1–13), with a roll of as of The Ministry of Education classifies the school amongst the four most isolated schools in the country. The school celebrated 125 years of settlement and schooling in 2000. A rebuild costing $11m was underway in 2020. The project won the top award in the Education category in the Te Kāhui Whaihanga New Zealand Institute of Architecture 2023 Nelson and Marlborough Architecture Awards.

== Notable people ==
Notable people from Karamea include:
* Atholl Anderson (1943–present), archaeologist, was assistant principal of Karamea Area School 1968–1970
* Sophia Anstice (1849–1926), dressmaker, draper and businesswoman, lived in Karamea 1874–1878 and started her dressmaking business there

<text>Plan of Attack is a 2004 book by the American author and investigative reporter Bob Woodward. It was promoted as &quot;a behind-the-scenes account of how and why President [George W.] Bush decided to go to war against Iraq&quot;.

The book&#x27;s chief contention, which provides the rationale for its title, is that President Bush planned from early in his presidency to remove Saddam Hussein from power by force, after the failure of serious and extensive diplomacy. The book describes White House deliberations implying that if Saddam were removed from power without a military invasion, Iraq would need a foreign-implemented regime change. It focuses mainly on President Bush, Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, U.S. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, General Tommy Franks, and CIA Director George Tenet, as well as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair. Other fixtures are White House advisers such as Karen Hughes and Karl Rove.

==Content==

&quot;Plan of Attack&quot; picks up where Woodward&#x27;s previous work, &quot;Bush at War&quot;, left off, focusing on the decision-making that led up to the U.S.-led war in Iraq. As a result of the broad access Woodward was granted to the White House and to interview Bush administration officials, the book is able to paint a realistic picture of what happened behind the scenes. Woodward&#x27;s own approach is to resist making judgements about the war itself, but rather try to describe the decision-making process. As a result of refraining to interpret the story that he presents, Woodward has been described as being both opposed to the Bush administration by some, as well as an apologist of the administration by others.

Woodward describes in &quot;Plan of Attack&quot; a small group of administration officials including Vice-President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld who were urging the President to go to war in Iraq beginning shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Secretary of State Colin Powell and General Tommy Franks are described as being part of a group within the government more skeptical of the plan to invade Iraq.

In the narrative, President George W. Bush is described as having been intent on exercising a policy of regime change with regard to Iraq immediately after 9/11, a perspective that remained largely unchanged throughout the debates that would follow.

Secretary of State Colin Powell is depicted as being increasingly at odds with members of the Bush administration, and even goes as far as to reject some of the evidence put forward on weapons of mass destruction. This depiction is despite the fact that he gave hours of testimony to the UN to convince them of the presence of weapons of mass destruction. However, by the end of the book, Powell ultimately endorses the invasion, a decision which is not entirely explained, other than to suggest Powell may have lined up with the President out of a sense of duty.

The Bush administration&#x27;s own view of &quot;Plan of Attack&quot; is convincing. When the book was published the administration denied many of the accounts in the book, but the Bush/Cheney re-election campaign listed Woodward&#x27;s book as recommended reading nevertheless. The Kerry/Edwards campaign also listed the book as recommended reading.

==Book versus individual accounts==

* Bob Woodward says Bush decided that the United States would invade Iraq on January 11, 2003. In interviews, Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice have stated the decision was much later – not until March. Paul O&#x27;Neill, on the other hand, stated that the decision was made in January 2001, well before even the September 11 attacks.
*In the book, CIA director George Tenet is noted as responding to skepticism that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction by leaping out of his chair and exclaiming &quot;It&#x27;s a slam dunk case!&quot; Later, Tenet is forced to admit that his intelligence was flawed when months of post-war searches turned up nothing. In 2007, during an interview on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Tenet claimed that his words were taken out of context.
* Woodward portrays Secretary of State Colin Powell as reluctant to go to war and often at odds with other Bush administration officials. Powell has stated for the record that he was always fully supportive of the administration and its efforts to invade Iraq, although he wanted tens or hundreds of thousands more soldiers on the ground.
* General Tommy Franks calls Pentagon official Douglas Feith &quot;the fucking stupidest guy on the face of the earth&quot;. In his biography, &quot;American Soldier&quot;, General Franks clarified the context of this phrase by stating that he was talking to his subordinates who were upset with Rumsfeld.

<doc id="607942" wikidata="Q4928621" url="?curid=607942" title="Blown flap">
<text>Blown flaps, blown wing or jet flaps are powered aerodynamic high-lift devices used on the wings of certain aircraft to improve their low-speed flight characteristics. They use air blown through nozzles to shape the airflow over the rear edge of the wing, directing the flow downward to increase the lift coefficient. There are a variety of methods to achieve this airflow, most of which use jet exhaust or high-pressure air bled off of a jet engine&#x27;s compressor and then redirected to follow the line of trailing-edge flaps.

&quot;Blown flaps&quot; may refer specifically to those systems that use internal ductwork within the wing to direct the airflow, or more broadly to systems like upper surface blowing or nozzle systems on conventional underwing engine that direct air through the flaps. Blown flaps are one solution among a broader category known as powered lift, which also includes various boundary layer control systems, systems using directed prop wash, and circulation control wings.

Internal blown flaps were used on some land and carrier-based fast jets in the 1960s, including the Lockheed F-104, Blackburn Buccaneer and certain versions of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21. They generally fell from favour because they imposed a significant maintenance overhead in keeping the ductwork clean and various valve systems working properly, along with the disadvantage that an engine failure reduced lift in precisely the situation where it is most desired. The concept reappeared in the form of upper and lower blowing in several transport aircraft, both turboprop and turbofan.

==Mechanism==
In a conventional blown flap, a small amount of the compressed air produced by the jet engine is &quot;bled&quot; off at the compressor stage and piped to channels running along the rear of the wing. There, it is forced through slots in the wing flaps of the aircraft when the flaps reach certain angles. Injecting high energy air into the boundary layer produces an increase in the stalling angle of attack and maximum lift coefficient by delaying boundary layer separation from the airfoil. Boundary layer control by mass injecting (blowing) prevents boundary layer separation by supplying additional energy to the particles of fluid which are being retarded in the boundary layer. Therefore, injecting a high velocity air mass into the air stream essentially tangent to the wall surface of the airfoil reverses the boundary layer friction deceleration; thus, the boundary layer separation is delayed.

The lift of a wing can be greatly increased with blowing flow control. With mechanical slots, the natural boundary layer limits the boundary layer control pressure to the freestream total head. Blowing with a small proportion of engine airflow (internal blown flap) increases the lift. Using much higher quantities of gas from the engine exhaust, which increases the effective chord of the flap (the jet flap), produces supercirculation, or forced circulation up to the theoretical potential flow maximum. Surpassing this limit requires the addition of direct thrust.

Development of the general concept continued at NASA in the 1950s and 1960s, leading to simplified systems with similar performance. The &quot;externally blown flap&quot; arranges the engine to blow across the flaps at the rear of the wing. Some of the jet exhaust is deflected downward directly by the flap, while additional air travels through the slots in the flap and follows the outer edge due to the Coandă effect. The similar &quot;upper-surface blowing&quot; system arranges the engines over the wing and relies completely on the Coandă effect to redirect the airflow. Although not as effective as direct blowing, these &quot;powered lift&quot; systems are nevertheless quite powerful and much simpler to build and maintain.

A more recent and promising blow-type flow control concept is the counter-flow fluid injection which is able to exert high-authority control to global flows using low energy modifications to key flow regions. In this case, the air blow slit is located at the pressure side near the leading edge stagnation point location and the control air-flow is directed tangentially to the surface but with a forward direction. During the operation of such a flow control system two different effects are present. One effect, boundary layer enhancement, is caused by the increased turbulence levels away from the wall region thus transporting higher-energy outer flow into the wall region. In addition to that another effect, the virtual shaping effect, is utilized to aerodynamically thicken the airfoil at high angles of attack. Both these effects help to delay or eliminate flow separation.

In general, blown flaps can improve the lift of a wing by two to three times. Whereas a complex triple-slotted flap system on a Boeing 747 produces a coefficient of lift of about 2.45, external blowing (upper surface blowing on a Boeing YC-14) improves this to about 7, and internal blowing (jet flap on Hunting H.126) to 9.

==History==

Williams states some flap blowing tests were done at the Royal Aircraft Establishment before the Second World War, and that extensive tests were done during the war in Germany including flight tests with Arado Ar 232, Dornier Do 24 and Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft. Lachmann states the Arado and Dornier aircraft used an ejector-driven single flow of air which was sucked over part of the trailing edge span and blown over the remainder. The ejector was chemically powered using high pressure vapour. The Bf 109 used engine-driven blowers for flap blowing.

Rebuffet and Poisson-Quinton describe tests in France at O.N.E.R.A. after the war with combined sucking at le of first flap section and blowing at second flap section using a jet engine compressor bleed ejector to give both sucking and blowing. Flight testing was done on a Breguet Vultur aircraft.

Tests were also done at Westland Aircraft by W.H. Paine after the war with reports dated 1950 and 1951.

In the United States, a Grumman F9F Panther was modified with flap blowing based on work done by John Attinello in 1951. Engine compressor bleed was used. The system was known as &quot;Supercirculation Boundary Layer Control&quot; or BLC for short.

Between 1951 and 1955, Cessna did flap blowing tests on Cessna 309 and 319 aircraft using the Arado system.
During the 1950s and 60s, fighter aircraft generally evolved towards smaller wings in order to reduce drag at high speeds. Compared to the fighters of a generation earlier, they had wing loadings about four times as high; for instance the Supermarine Spitfire had a wing loading of and the Messerschmitt Bf 109 had the &quot;very high&quot; loading of , whereas the 1950s-era Lockheed F-104 Starfighter had .

One serious downside to these higher wing loadings is at low speed, when there is not enough wing left to provide lift to keep the plane flying. Even huge flaps could not offset this to any large degree, and as a result many aircraft landed at fairly high speeds, and were noted for accidents as a result.

The major reason flaps were not effective is that the airflow over the wing could only be &quot;bent so much&quot; before it stopped following the wing profile, a condition known as flow separation. There is a limit to how much air the flaps can deflect overall. There are ways to improve this, through better flap design; modern airliners use complex multi-part flaps for instance. However, large flaps tend to add considerable complexity, and take up room on the outside of the wing, which makes them unsuitable for use on a fighter.

The principle of the jet flap, a type of internally blown flap, was proposed and patented in 1952 by the British National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) and thereafter investigated by the NGTE and the Royal Aircraft Establishment.
The concept was first tested at full-scale on the experimental Hunting H.126. It reduced the stall speed to only , a number most light aircraft cannot match. The jet flap used a large percentage of the engine exhaust, rather than compressor bleed air, for blowing.

One of the first production aircraft with blown flaps was the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, which entered service in January 1958. After prolonged development problems, the BLCS proved to be enormously useful in compensating for the Starfighter&#x27;s tiny wing surface. The Lockheed T2V SeaStar, with blown flaps, had entered service in May 1957 but was to have persistent maintenance problems with the BLCS which led to its early retirement. In June 1958, the Supermarine Scimitar with blown flaps entered service. Blown flaps were used on the North American Aviation A-5 Vigilante, the Vought F-8 Crusader variants E(FN) and J, the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and the Blackburn Buccaneer. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 had blown flaps. Petrov states long-term operation of these aircraft showed high reliability of the BLC systems. The TSR-2, which was cancelled before it entered service, had full-span blown flaps.

Starting in the 1970s, the lessons of air combat over Vietnam changed thinking considerably. Instead of aircraft designed for outright speed, general maneuverability and load capacity became more important in most designs. The result is an evolution back to larger planforms to provide more lift. For instance the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon has a wing loading of , and uses leading edge extensions to provide considerably more lift at higher angles of attack, including approach and landing. Some later combat aircraft achieved the required low-speed characteristics using swing-wings. Internal flap blowing is still used to supplement externally blown flaps on the Shin Meiwa US-1A.

Some aircraft currently (2015) in service that require a STOL performance use external flap blowing and, in some cases, also use internal flap blowing on flaps as well as on control surfaces such as the rudder to ensure adequate control and stability at low speeds. External blowing concepts are known as the &quot;externally blown flap&quot; (used on the Boeing C-17 Globemaster), &quot;upper surface blowing&quot; (used on the Antonov An-72 and Antonov An-74) and &quot;vectored slipstream&quot;, or &quot;over the wing blowing&quot;, used on the Antonov An-70 and the Shin Meiwa US-1A and ShinMaywa US-2.

Powered high-lift systems, such as externally blown flaps, are not used for civil transport aircraft for reasons given by Reckzeh, which include complexity, weight, cost, sufficient existing runway lengths and certification rules.

<text>Tippu Tip, or Tippu Tib (c. 1837 – June 14, 1905), real name Ḥamad ibn Muḥammad ibn Jumʿah ibn Rajab ibn Muḥammad ibn Saʿīd al Murjabī (), was an Afro-Omani ivory and slave owner and trader, explorer, governor and plantation owner. He worked for a succession of sultans of Zanzibar and was the Sultan of Uterera, a short-lived state in Kasongo, Maniema ruled by himself and his son Sefu.

Tippu Tip traded in slaves for Zanzibar&#x27;s clove plantations. As part of the large and lucrative trade, he led many trading expeditions into Central Africa, constructing profitable trading posts deep into the Congo Basin region and thus becoming the best-known slave and ivory trader in Africa, supplying much of the world with ivory from enslaved Africans.

==Early life==
Based on descriptions of his age at different points in his life, it is believed that Tippu Tip was born around 1832 in Zanzibar. Tippu Tip&#x27;s mother, Bint Habib bin Bushir, was a Muscat Arab of the ruling class. His father and paternal grandfather were coastal Arabs of the Swahili Coast who had taken part in earlier slave-trading expeditions to the interior. His paternal great-grandmother, wife of Rajab bin Mohammed bin Said el Murgebi, was the daughter of Juma bin Mohammed el Nebhani, a member of a respected Muscat (Oman) family, and a Bantu woman from the settlement of Mbuamaji, south of what would later become the German capital of Dar es Salaam in present-day Kigamboni District. 

Throughout his lifetime Hamad bin Muhammad bin Juma bin Rajab el Murjebi was more commonly known as &quot;Tippu Tib&quot;, which translates to &quot;the gatherer together of wealth&quot;. According to him, he was given the nickname Tippu Tip after the &quot;tiptip&quot; sound that his guns gave off during expeditions in Chungu territory.

At a relatively young age, Tippu Tip led a group of about 100 men into Central Africa seeking slaves and ivory. After plundering several large swathes of land, he returned to Zanzibar to consolidate his resources and recruit for his forces. Following this he returned to mainland Africa.

==Career==
Tippu Tip built a slave-trading empire, and is considered the second wealthiest Muslim slave trader in history, using the proceeds to establish clove plantations on Zanzibar. Abdul Sheriff reported that, when he left for his twelve years of &quot;empire building&quot; on the mainland, he had no plantations of his own. By 1895, he had acquired &quot;seven &#x27;shambas&#x27; [plantations] and 10,000 slaves&quot;.

He met and helped several Western explorers of the African continent, including David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley. Between 1884 and 1887, he claimed the Eastern Congo for himself and for the Sultan of Zanzibar, Bargash bin Said el Busaidi. In spite of his position as protector of Zanzibar&#x27;s interests in Congo, he managed to maintain good relations with the Europeans. When, in August 1886, fighting broke out between the Swahili and the representatives of King Leopold II of Belgium at Stanley Falls, al-Murjabī went to the Belgian consul at Zanzibar to assure him of his &quot;good intentions&quot;. Although he was still a force in Central African politics, he could see by 1886 that power in the region was shifting. 

===Governor of the Stanley Falls District===
In early 1887, Stanley arrived in Zanzibar and proposed that Tippu Tip be made governor of the Stanley Falls District in the Congo Free State. Both Leopold and Sultan Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar agreed and on February 24, 1887, Tippu Tip accepted. At the same time, he agreed to man the expedition which Stanley had been commissioned to organize for the purpose of rescuing Emin Pasha (E. Schnitzer), the German governor of Equatoria (a region of Ottoman Egypt, today in South Sudan) who had been stranded in the Bahr el Ghazal area as a result of the Mahdi uprising in Sudan.

Tippu Tip travelled back to the Upper Congo in the company of Stanley, but this time by way of the Atlantic coast and up the Congo River. Aside from its doubtful usefulness, the relief expedition was marred by the near annihilation of its rearguard. 

===Congo–Arab War===
After his tenure as governor, the Congo–Arab War broke out. Both sides fought with armies consisting mostly of local African soldiers fighting under the command of either Arab or European leaders. 

When Tippu Tip left the Congo, the authority of King Leopold&#x27;s Free State was still very weak in the Eastern parts of the territory and the power lay largely with local Arabic or Swahili strongmen. Amongst these were Tippu Tip&#x27;s son Sefu bin Hamid and a trader known as Rumaliza in the area close to Lake Tanganyika.

In 1892, Sefu bin Hamed attacked Belgian ivory traders, who were seen as a threat to the Arab-Swahili trade. The Free State government sent a force under commander Francis Dhanis to the East. Dhanis had an early success when chief Ngongo Lutete changed sides from Sefu&#x27;s to his. The better armed and organised Belgian force defeated their opponents in several fights until the death of Sefu on 20 October 1893, and finally forcing also Rumaliza to flee to German territory in 1895.

===Death===

After returning to Zanzibar around 1890/91, Tippu Tip retired. He set out to write an account of his life, which is the first example of the literary genre of autobiography in the Bantu Swahili language. Dr. Heinrich Brode, who knew him in Zanzibar, transcribed the manuscript into Roman script and translated it into German. It was subsequently translated into English and published in Britain in 1907.

Tippu Tip died June 13, 1905, of malaria (according to Brode) in his home in Stone Town, the main town on the island of Zanzibar.

<text>Lapponia is a book written by Johannes Schefferus (1621 - 1679) in Latin covering a very comprehensive history of Northern Scandinavia topology, environment and Sámi living condition, dwelling-places, clothing, gender roles, hunting, child raising, shamanism, and pagan religion. It was published in late 1673 and closely followed by English, German, French, and Dutch translations. Adapted and abridged versions followed, where only the original chapters on shamanism and religion were preserved, the others being replaced by tales of magic, sorcery, drums and heathenism.

The book uses &quot;Lap&quot; mainly to notice that Sámi are still pagan and it is concluded that Lap is a word introduced by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus (ca. 1150–1220) to distinguish Sámi peoples living near the ocean (coast-fenni) and in the woodland (lapp-fenni).

It was aimed to meet rumors, or as the councillor Magnus De La Gardie saw it, degrading propaganda, from particular German pamphlets claiming the Swedes had used &quot;Sami magic&quot; on European battlefields.

The book was not fully translated into Swedish (as &quot;Lappland&quot;, Acta Lapponica 8, Uppsala 1956) until 1956. Its references are, however, based on &quot;clergy correspondence&quot;, that is, reports made by priests.

A smaller part of the geographical region described in the book is today named Lappland (or Laponia.)

<doc id="607950" wikidata="Q374982" url="?curid=607950" title="Bert Trautmann">
<text>Bernhard Carl &quot;Bert&quot; Trautmann (22 October 1923 – 19 July 2013) was a German professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

Born in Bremen in 1923, he joined the Jungvolk, the junior section of the Hitler Youth in August 1933. Trautmann joined the Luftwaffe early in the Second World War, and then served as a paratrooper. He was initially sent to occupied Poland, and subsequently fought on the Eastern Front for three years, earning five medals, including an Iron Cross. Later in the war, he was transferred to the Western Front, where he was captured by the British as the war drew to a close. As a volunteer soldier, he was classified a category &quot;C&quot; prisoner by the authorities, meaning he was regarded as a Nazi. One of only 90 of his original 1,000-man regiment to survive the war, he was transferred to a prisoner-of-war camp in Ashton-in-Makerfield, Lancashire. Trautmann refused an offer of repatriation, and following his release in 1948 decided to settle in Lancashire, combining farm work with playing goalkeeper for a local football team, St Helens Town.

Performances for St Helens gained Trautmann a reputation as an outstanding goalkeeper, resulting in interest from Football League clubs. In October 1949, he signed for Manchester City, a club playing in the country&#x27;s highest level of football, the First Division. The club&#x27;s decision to sign a former Axis paratrooper sparked protests, and 20,000 people attended a demonstration. Over time, he gained acceptance through his performances in the City goal, playing in all but five of the club&#x27;s next 250 matches.

Named FWA Footballer of the Year for 1956, Trautmann entered football folklore with his performance in the 1956 FA Cup final. With 17 minutes of the match remaining, Trautmann suffered a serious injury while diving at the feet of Birmingham City&#x27;s Peter Murphy. Despite his injury, he continued to play, making crucial saves to preserve his team&#x27;s 3–1 lead. His neck was noticeably crooked as he collected his winner&#x27;s medal; three days later an X-ray revealed it to be broken.

Trautmann played for Manchester City until 1964, making 545 appearances. After his playing career, he moved into management, first with lower-division sides in England and Germany, and later as part of a German Football Association development scheme that took him to several countries, including Burma, Tanzania and Pakistan. In 2004, he was appointed an honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for promoting Anglo-German understanding through football. In 2013, Trautmann died at home near Valencia, Spain, aged 89.

==Early life in Germany==
Bernhard Carl Trautmann was born on 22 October 1923 in Walle, a working class area in west Bremen, living with his father, who worked in a fertiliser factory by the docks, and his mother Frieda. He had a brother, Karl-Heinz, three years his junior, with whom he enjoyed a close relationship. The bleak economic climate of the early 1930s forced the Trautmanns to sell their house and move to an apartment block in the working class area of Gröpelingen, where Bernhard lived until 1941.

The young Bernhard had a keen interest in sport, playing football, handball and &quot;völkerball&quot; (a form of dodgeball). To this end, he joined the YMCA and football club &quot;Blau und Weiss&quot;. He took to playing for the football club with enthusiasm, but the YMCA activities did not interest him to the same extent.

In August 1933, he joined a new organisation, the Jungvolk, the junior section of the Hitler Youth. The following year, he won several local junior athletics events and was awarded a certificate for athletic excellence signed by Paul von Hindenburg, the President of Germany. At the onset of the Second World War, Trautmann was working as an apprentice motor mechanic.

==Second World War==
Trautmann joined the Luftwaffe as a radio operator in 1941. During training, he showed little aptitude for radio work, and transferred to Spandau to become a &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; (paratrooper). He first served in Occupied Poland, although being stationed far behind the front line meant experiencing prolonged bouts of monotony; consequently, Trautmann and the rest of his regiment resorted to sports and practical jokes to pass the time. One such practical joke involving a car backfired on Trautmann, resulting in a staff sergeant burning his arms. Trautmann was court-martialled over this incident and sentenced to three months in prison. At the start of his confinement, Trautmann came down with acute appendicitis, and spent the remainder of his sentence in a military hospital.

In October 1941, he rejoined the 35th Infantry Division at Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, where the German advance had halted. Over-winter hit-and-run attacks on Soviet Army supply routes were the unit&#x27;s main focus and in spring, Trautmann was promoted to &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; (corporal). Gains were made in 1942, but the Soviet counter-offensive hit Trautmann&#x27;s unit hard, and by the time it was withdrawn from the Eastern Front, only 300 of the original 1,000 men remained. Trautmann won five medals for his actions on the Eastern Front, including an Iron Cross First Class.

Promoted to &quot;Feldwebel&quot; (sergeant), Trautmann was part of a unit formed from the remnants of several others that had been decimated in the east, and moved to France to guard against an expected Allied invasion of France. In 1945, he was one of the few survivors of the Allied bombing of Kleve, and decided to head home to Bremen. By this point, German soldiers without valid leave papers were being shot as deserters, so Trautmann sought to avoid troops from either side. However, a few days later, he was captured in a barn by two Allied soldiers. Deciding that Trautmann had no useful intelligence to give them, the soldiers marched him out of the barn with his hands raised. Fearing he was about to be executed, Trautmann fled. After evading his captors, he jumped over a fence, only to land at the feet of a British soldier, who greeted him with the words &quot;Hello Fritz, fancy a cup of tea?&quot; Earlier in the war, he had been captured by the Soviets and later the French, but escaped both times.

He was imprisoned near Ostend, Belgium, then transferred to a transit camp in Essex, where he was interrogated. As a volunteer soldier who had been subject to indoctrination from a young age, he was classified a category &quot;C&quot; prisoner by the authorities, meaning he was regarded as a Nazi. Trautmann, one of only 90 of his original regiment to survive the war, was then transferred to a prisoner-of-war camp at Marbury Hall, near Northwich, Cheshire, and interned with other category &quot;C&quot; prisoners. He was soon downgraded to non-Nazi &quot;B&quot; status, after which he was taken to Fort Crosby in Hightown near Liverpool where he stayed for a short while working on local farms and mixing with the locals; from here he was sent to PoW Camp 50 (now Byrchall High School) in Ashton-in-Makerfield in Lancashire between St Helens and Wigan, where he stayed until 1948.

Football matches were regularly held at the camp, in which Trautmann played outfield. However, in a match against amateur team Haydock Park, Trautmann was injured while playing centre-half. He swapped positions with goalkeeper Günther Lühr, and from that day forward played as a goalkeeper. During this time he became known as &quot;Bert&quot;, as the English were unfamiliar with &quot;Bernd&quot;, the abbreviated version of his name.

==Football career==
===Early years===
With closure of the PoW camp imminent, Trautmann declined an offer of repatriation and stayed in England, working on a farm in Milnthorpe then subsequently working on bomb disposal in Huyton.

In August 1948, he started playing amateur football for the non-league Liverpool County Combination club St Helens Town, through which he met the club secretary&#x27;s daughter, Margaret Friar, whom he later married. Over the course of the 1948–49 season, Trautmann&#x27;s goalkeeping reputation steadily grew and a series of large crowds were attributed to his performances, including a record 9,000 attendance in the final of a local cup competition, the Mahon Cup. The success of that season elevated the club into Division Two of the Lancashire Combination League for the start of 1949–50.

===Manchester City===
Performances for St Helens gained Trautmann a reputation as an able goalkeeper, resulting in interest from Football League clubs. As the following season commenced, a number of League clubs showed interest in signing him. The first to offer him a contract was Manchester City, a club playing in the highest level of football in the country, the First Division. On 7 October 1949 Trautmann signed for the club as an amateur and turned professional shortly after. Trautmann became the first sportsman in Britain to wear Adidas, thanks to his friendship with Adolf Dassler.

====Supporter discontent and initial period====
Some Manchester City fans were unhappy about signing a former member of the German Army. Season ticket holders threatened a boycott, and various groups in Manchester and around the country bombarded the club with protest letters. In addition to this difficulty, Trautmann was replacing the recently retired Frank Swift, one of the greatest keepers in the club&#x27;s history. Though privately expressing doubts about the signing, the club captain, Eric Westwood, a Normandy veteran, made a public display of welcoming Trautmann by announcing, &quot;There&#x27;s no war in this dressing room&quot;. Trautmann made his first team debut on 19 November against Bolton Wanderers, and after a competent display in his first home match, protests shrank as fans discovered his talent. Before his first home game, Alexander Altmann, the community rabbi of Manchester, had written a remarkable open letter to the &quot;Manchester Evening Chronicle&quot;, appealing to City fans and the Jewish community to treat Trautmann with respect. He continued to receive abuse from crowds at away matches, which affected his concentration in some early games; in December 1949, he conceded seven goals at Derby County.

City&#x27;s match against Fulham in January 1950 was Trautmann&#x27;s first visit to London. The match received widespread media attention, as most of the British press were based there; several leading sportswriters watched Trautmann in action for the first time. The damage caused to the city by the Luftwaffe meant former paratrooper Trautmann was a target of hatred for the crowd, who yelled &quot;Kraut&quot; and &quot;Nazi&quot;. City were struggling in the league, and widely expected to suffer a heavy defeat but a string of saves from Trautmann meant the final score was a narrow 1–0 loss. At the final whistle, Trautmann received a standing ovation, and was applauded off the pitch by both sets of players. The Manchester City team struggled throughout the season, and was relegated to the Second Division.

Manchester City returned to the top flight at its first attempt, and in the following years Trautmann established himself as one of the best keepers in the league, playing in all but five of his club&#x27;s next 250 league matches. By 1952, his fame had spread to his home country, leading Schalke 04 to offer Manchester City £1,000 () for his services. The offer was refused; the club responded that they thought Trautmann to be worth twenty times more.

In the mid-1950s, the Manchester City manager Les McDowall introduced a new tactical system using a deep-lying centre-forward, which became known as the Revie Plan after Don Revie, who played centre-forward. The system depended on maintaining possession of the ball wherever possible, which required Trautmann to make use of his throwing ability. For goalkeepers of Trautmann&#x27;s era, it was usual to kick the ball as far as possible downfield after making a save. By contrast, Trautmann, influenced by the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics, sought to start attacks by throwing the ball to a wing-half, typically Ken Barnes or John McTavish. The wing-half then passed to Revie to develop the attack.

====1955 and 1956 FA Cup finals====
Using the Revie Plan, Manchester City reached the 1955 FA Cup final, in which Trautmann became the first German to play in an FA Cup final. City faced Newcastle United, winners of the cup in 1951 and 1952. Nerves affected the City players, and they went behind to a Jackie Milburn goal after only 45 seconds. Further problems were caused by the loss of Jimmy Meadows to injury after 18 minutes, leaving City with 10 men, a disadvantage that meant Trautmann&#x27;s ability to start attacks from throws was limited. Though Bobby Johnstone equalised in the first half, they struggled in the second, and after 57 minutes Trautmann was outwitted by Bobby Mitchell, who scored Newcastle&#x27;s second goal. The match finished as a 3–1 defeat for City, giving Trautmann a runners-up medal.

Manchester City had a strong season in 1955–56, finishing fourth in the league and reached the FA Cup final against Birmingham City. Trautmann, one of the team&#x27;s most prominent performers, won the FWA Footballer of the Year Award shortly before the match, the first goalkeeper to win the award. Two days later, Trautmann stepped out onto the Wembley pitch for the match that would gain him worldwide acclaim.

During the previous final, nerves had contributed to the opposition scoring an early goal, but the City team was more settled on this occasion. Under the influence of Don Revie who was outstanding on the day, City scored an early goal, a left-footed strike by Joe Hayes. Birmingham equalised on 14 minutes. The match remained level until midway through the second half, when Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone scored two goals in as many minutes to give Manchester City a 3–1 lead. Birmingham attacked strongly in the next ten minutes. In the 75th minute, Trautmann, diving at an incoming ball, was knocked out in a collision with Birmingham&#x27;s Peter Murphy in which he was hit in the neck by Murphy&#x27;s right knee. No substitutes were permitted in those days, so Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, carried on. For the remaining 15 minutes he defended his net, making a crucial interception to deny Murphy once more. Manchester City held on for the victory, and Trautmann was the hero because of his spectacular saves in the last minutes of the match. Trautmann admitted later that he had spent the last part of the match &quot;in a kind of fog&quot;.

His neck continued to cause him pain, and Prince Philip commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner&#x27;s medal. Trautmann attended that evening&#x27;s post-match banquet despite being unable to move his head, and went to bed expecting the injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to St George&#x27;s Hospital, where he was told he merely had a crick in his neck which would go away. Three days later, he got a second opinion from a doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.

====Recovery from injury====
Trautmann&#x27;s convalescence took several months, resulting in him missing a large part of the 1956–57 season. Jack Savage deputised during his absence. At the start of December, Trautmann played two reserve matches, but lacked confidence. He was restored to the first team on 15 December for a match against Wolverhampton Wanderers, but conceded three goals. He struggled to regain his form in the remainder of the season, leading to calls from some fans and media for him to retire. Others criticised the club, believing that Trautmann had been forced to play while still not fully recovered from injury.

The 1957–58 season was an unusual one for Manchester City, who became the only English team to both score and concede 100 goals in a season. Trautmann played in 34 matches, and though he did not play in the 9–2 defeat to West Bromwich Albion, an 8–4 defeat to Leicester City was a record for the most goals conceded by Trautmann in a match in his career, and in the entire season he kept only two clean sheets.

====Testimonial====
Trautmann appeared in 545 matches for City during the 15-year period between 1949 and 1964.

On 15 April 1964, he ended his career with a testimonial in front of a crowd officially numbered at 47,000, though the true figure was estimated to be closer to 60,000. Trautmann captained a combined Manchester City and Manchester United XI that included Bobby Charlton and Denis Law, against an International XI that included Tom Finney, Stanley Matthews and Jimmy Armfield.

===Later career===
After leaving City, Trautmann played for Wellington Town, who offered him £50 per match, signing in September 1964 to replace an injured regular keeper. Age had diminished his abilities, but his debut at Hereford United showed he still had the ability to draw crowds. However, he was sent off at Tonbridge for violent conduct in his second match and, in all, ended on the losing side in five of the seven matches he played for Wellington.

==International career==
Though recognised as one of the leading goalkeepers of his era, Trautmann never played for his native country. Trautmann met with the German national coach, Sepp Herberger, in 1953, who explained that travel and political implications prevented him from selecting a player who was not readily available, and that he could only consider including Trautmann if he were playing in a German league. Consequently, Trautmann&#x27;s international isolation prevented him from playing in the 1954 World Cup, in which his countrymen were victorious. Trautmann&#x27;s only experience of international football came in 1960, when the Football League decided to include non-English players in the Football League representative team for the first time. Trautmann captained the League against the Irish League, and also played against the Italian League.

==Coaching career==
After a couple of months pondering his future career plans, Trautmann received a telephone call from the Stockport County chairman, Victor Bernard, who offered him the position of general manager. Stockport was a struggling lower league club with a small budget, and Trautmann&#x27;s appointment was an attempt to improve its image. Many people in the local area supported one of the two Manchester clubs, so to stimulate interest Trautmann and Bernard decided to move matches to Friday evenings, when neither Manchester club would be playing. This improved revenue, but the team continued to struggle. Trautmann resigned in 1966 following a disagreement with Bernard. From 1967 to 1968, he was the manager of the German team Preußen Münster, taking them to a 13th-place finish in the Regionalliga West, following which he had a short spell at Opel Rüsselsheim.

The German Football Association then sent Trautmann as a development worker to countries without national football structures. His first posting was in Burma, where he spent two years as the national coach, qualifying for the 1972 Olympics, and winning the President&#x27;s Cup, a tournament contested by Southeast Asian countries, later that year. His work subsequently took him to advisory coaching roles for the national teams of Tanzania, Liberia, Pakistan and North Yemen, where he trained several coaches and helped them obtain the coaching license. Following his retirement, Trautmann settled in Spain.

==Style of play==
Trautmann excelled at shot-stopping, particularly penalties, saving 60% of those he faced over the course of his career. The Manchester United manager Matt Busby mentioned Trautmann&#x27;s anticipation in his pre-match team talks: &quot;Don&#x27;t stop to think where you&#x27;re going to hit it with Trautmann. Hit it first and think afterwards. If you look up and work it out he will read your thoughts and stop it.&quot; Similar sentiments were expressed by the Manchester City forward Neil Young, who recalled that &quot;the only way to beat him with a shot in training was to mis-hit it&quot;. As a former handball player, Trautmann was adept at throwing the ball long distances, an attribute he used to start attacking moves, particularly after witnessing the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics use such tactics to good effect in Hungary&#x27;s 6–3 victory over England in 1953.

Trautmann found it difficult to accept criticism, and allowed only close friends to suggest changes to his game. He occasionally dwelt on mistakes to the detriment of his concentration, a tendency his friend Stan Wilson called &quot;picking at daisies&quot;. A short temper also caused occasional problems; he was sent off on more than one occasion.

==Legacy and influence==

Over the course of his career, Trautmann received many plaudits from leading football figures. The Russian goalkeeper Lev Yashin, himself considered one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, believed that Trautmann and himself were the &quot;only ... two world-class goalkeepers&quot;.

Trautmann&#x27;s idiosyncratic style of play also had an influence on budding young goalkeepers at the height of his career. The former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson named Trautmann as his boyhood hero, and Gordon Banks cited him as an influence on his playing style.

Media outlets have since recognised Trautmann&#x27;s reputation. ESPN consider Trautmann as one of the greatest FA Cup goalkeepers, with Trautmann representing Manchester City in two consecutive FA Cup finals in 1955 and 1956 while his lunge at Peter Murphy&#x27;s feet to grasp the ball in the 1956 FA Cup final is rated as the greatest FA Cup save; a save that broke Trautmann&#x27;s neck.

In November 1995, Trautmann returned to Maine Road to open the rebuilt Kippax Stand. However, the stand was gone within a decade: in May 2003 the club moved to the City of Manchester Stadium, Maine Road was closed and was demolished the following year.

Trautmann was portrayed by German actor David Kross in the 2018 biopic &quot;The Keeper&quot;.

==Awards==
In 1997, Trautmann received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. He was appointed an honorary OBE in 2004 for his work in Anglo-German relations, and received the award at the British Embassy in Berlin, making him possibly the only person to have won an OBE and an Iron Cross. The following night, at a concert given by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, he met the Queen. &quot;Ah, Herr Trautmann. I remember you&quot;, she said. &quot;Have you still got that pain in your neck?&quot;

In 2005, he was inducted into the National Football Museum&#x27;s Hall of Fame. He continued to follow Manchester City and visited Manchester to watch them play, with his last visit in April 2010. In 1999, he had also appeared in the BBC &quot;Timewatch&quot; programme episode &quot;The Germans We Kept&quot;, recounting the experiences of German prisoners of war who decided to remain in the UK.

==Personal life==
Trautmann married a St Helens woman, Margaret Friar, in 1950, but they divorced in 1972. The couple had three children, John, Mark and Stephen. John, his firstborn son, was killed in a car accident a few months after the FA Cup final in 1956, aged five. According to Trautmann, his wife&#x27;s struggle to come to terms with the loss ultimately resulted in the breakup of their marriage. He also had a daughter from a previous relationship, from whom he was estranged for many years. He reunited with his daughter in 1990, and with her mother, Marion Greenhall, in 2001. He married Ursula von der Heyde, a German national, while living in Burma in the 1970s, but divorced in 1982. From 1990, Trautmann lived with his third wife Marlis in a small bungalow on the Spanish coast near Valencia. He later helped found the Trautmann Foundation, which continues his legacy by fostering courage and sportsmanship.

Trautmann&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Steppes to Wembley&quot; was published in 1956.

===Death===
Trautmann died at home in Spain on 19 July 2013 at the age of 89. He had suffered two heart attacks earlier in the year. The president of the German Football Association, Wolfgang Niersbach, said that Trautmann was &quot;an amazing sportsman and a true gentleman ... a legend&quot;. Bob Wilson, a former Arsenal goalkeeper, tweeted, &quot;Amazing man who helped bring our warring countries closer together&quot;. Joe Corrigan, a former Manchester City goalkeeper, said Trautmann was &quot;a fantastic man and was one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time&quot;.

<doc id="607953" wikidata="Q5140024" url="?curid=607953" title="Code Complete">
<text>Code Complete is a software development book, written by Steve McConnell and published in 1993 by Microsoft Press, encouraging developers to continue past code-and-fix programming and the big design up front and waterfall models. It is also a compendium of software construction techniques, which include techniques from naming variables to deciding when to write a subroutine.

==Summary==
McConnell defines the main activities in software construction as detailed design, construction planning, coding and debugging, unit testing, integration and integration testing. Although he does not dismiss the value of other aspects of software development such as requirements and documentation, McConnell emphasises the construction of software due to several reasons. Within the view of the book, construction is a large part of software development, as the central activity within software development and can significantly improve the productivity of a programmer when focus is directed towards it; in addition, the source code is seen as defining the operation of the software, with documentation implicated when code and documentation are opposed. Lastly, the book contends that construction is the exclusive activity which is guaranteed to remain completed.

The techniques of a good programmer are also given throughout the book. The whole part seven of the book is about software craftsmanship (layout, style, character, themes and self-documentation).

The other six parts of the book are: laying the foundation, creating high-quality code, variables, statements, code improvements and system considerations.

==Review==
&quot;Code Complete&quot; has received outstanding reviews, being widely regarded as one of the leading must-reads for software developers. It won a Jolt Award in 1993.

There are also negative reviews about the length and style of the book, which runs to over 900 pages and goes into detail on many topics.

The first edition has been superseded by &quot;Code Complete 2&quot;. The first editions can be found used and are still relevant for programmers using C, Pascal and GW-BASIC

<doc id="607957" wikidata="Q856085" url="?curid=607957" title="Marree, South Australia">
<text>Marree ( , formerly Hergott Springs) is a small town located in the north of South Australia. It is located north of Adelaide at the junction of the Oodnadatta Track and the Birdsville Track, above sea level. Marree is an important service centre for the large sheep and cattle stations in north-east South Australia as well as a stopover destination for tourists travelling along the Birdsville or Oodnadatta Tracks.

The area is the home of the Dieri Aboriginal people. The major areas of employment are mining, agriculture and accommodation services.

The town was home to Australia&#x27;s first mosque, which was made of mud brick and built by the Afghan cameleers employed at Marree&#x27;s inception. At the turn of the 20th century the town was divided in two, with Europeans on one side and Afghans and Aboriginals on the other.

==History and etymology==
The first European to explore the area was Edward John Eyre, who passed through in 1840. In 1859, explorer John McDouall Stuart visited the area together with the German botanist and accomplished bushman Joseph Herrgott, who discovered the springs which Stuart named after him. Herrgott had previously taken part of B. H. Babbage&#x27;s expedition to Lake Torrens. He died two years afterwards in 1861; he was 36 years old.

Initially the area was known as &quot;Herrgott (or Hergott) Springs&quot;, with the town&#x27;s post office given the name &quot;Hergott Springs&quot; after surveying of the town in 1883. The town was also recognised as Hergott Springs in the 1911 census. In that year the District Trained Nursing Society sent Clara Winifred Howie to establish a nursing facility in Hergott Springs.

The town&#x27;s name was changed to Marree in 1917 due to anti-German sentiment during World War I.

Marree Hotel and Marree Fettlers&#x27; Cottages are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.

The movie &quot;The Rover&quot;, starring Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson, was filmed in Marree in January 2013.
Parts of &quot;The Inbetweeners 2&quot;, a 2014 British comedy film set in Australia, were filmed in Marree.
Scenes from &quot;Last Cab to Darwin&quot;, starring Michael Caton, were filmed in Marree in May 2014. Jan Palo, a local identity, had a non-speaking part filmed in his home, the old butcher&#x27;s shop.

==Early transportation and telegraphy==

The Central Australia Railway reached the town in 1883 and the first train ran to the railway station in January 1884. The South Australia Post and Telegraph Department established a telegraph and post office in Maree in June 1884. It operated in a canvas tent, until a more permanent structure was built. The first station master was James Arthur O&#x27;Brien (born 1863) who held the post from 1884 to 1901.

The town became a major railhead for the cattle industry. The railway was extended north from the town in stages, reaching Alice Springs in 1929. It was on the route of the passenger train which became known as &quot;The Ghan&quot;. In 1957, a standard-gauge line was built south from Marree on a flatter alignment to facilitate the movement of coal from the Leigh Creek Coalfield to Port Augusta. That made Marree a break of gauge on &quot;The Ghan&quot; service because the remainder of the line was still narrow gauge. In 1980 the narrow gauge line from Marree to Alice Springs closed when the Adelaide–Alice Springs line was rebuilt much further west. In 1987 the standard gauge line to Marree was closed north of the coal mine and the town lost its railway connection completely.

Marree was also the home of Tom Kruse, one of the men who drove the mail trucks from Marree to Birdsville in Queensland, a distance of some 700 kilometres. This route crosses some of the most challenging sandy and stony desert country in Australia, and it was a remarkable feat for fully loaded trucks to make the run at all. A collection of hundreds of photographs, documents and memorabilia from Kruse&#x27;s Birdsville mail run are on display at the Marree Hotel.

==Marree Man==
The name &quot;Marree&quot; was referred to briefly around the world when in 1998, a chalk figure recently etched into the landscape 60 km west of Marree was discovered, dubbed the &quot;Marree Man&quot;. Calls were made to turn it into a state icon but the unimpressed local population preferred to let it fade naturally back into the landscape.

==Governance==

Marree is located within the federal Division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart, the Pastoral Unincorporated Area of South Australia and the state&#x27;s Far North region. In the absence of a local government authority, the community in Marree receives municipal services from a state government agency, the Outback Communities Authority.

==Climate==
Like much of inland Australia, Marree has a very hot and dry climate in a desert environment. Temperatures above have been recorded in every month from October to April and rainfall is extremely erratic, falling mostly in brief heavy downpours experienced usually between one and five times per year, or when cold fronts in winter manage to penetrate far north enough into the Tirari Desert.

<doc id="607960" wikidata="Q831403" url="?curid=607960" title="Harm principle">
<text>The harm principle holds that the actions of individuals should be limited only to prevent harm to other individuals. John Stuart Mill articulated the principle in the 1859 essay &quot;On Liberty&quot;, where he argued that &quot;The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.&quot; An equivalent was earlier stated in France&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&quot; of 1789 as, &quot;Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law.&quot; It finds earlier expression in Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s 1785 &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;, Query 17 (Religion) in which he writes, &quot;The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others.&quot;

== John Stuart Mill&#x27;s formulation ==
The harm principle was first fully articulated by the English philosopher John Stuart Mill [JSM] (1806–1873) in the first chapter of &quot;On Liberty&quot; (1859), where he argued that:

Mill also put the harm principle within his list of rights that sprung from liberty. It was found within his list of political rights (political activities that did not involve harm to others) - but also within his non-political liberty rights - his &quot;tastes and pursuits&quot; - activities which did not involve politics and did not involve harm to others:

According to Mills, harm is thus necessary but sometimes insufficient to justify legal coercion.

== Legal applications ==

=== Historical examples ===
The harm principle is found in article 5 of the first English-language constitution from 1647: &quot;An Agreement of the People for a firme and present Peace, upon grounds of common right and freedome...&quot;, presented to the Army Council, E. 412, 21. October 28, 1647:
The harm principle is found in Articles 4 and 5 of the first French constitution (and first nationally adopted constitution) from 1789: Declaration of Human and Civic Rights of 26 August 1789:

One might rightly argue that the &quot;pursuit of Happiness&quot; mentioned in the 1776 US Declaration of Independence was one of the &quot;tastes and pursuits&quot; that Mill had in mind:

==== Restrictions ====
In On Liberty, J. S. Mill writes that his principle does not apply to persons judged as mentally ill, &quot;barbarians&quot; (which he assimilated to minors) and minors while the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&quot; did not concern women, slaves, foreigners and minors, as they were not citizens.

Modern interpretations of the principle often does not make distinction of race or sex.

=== In modern policy ===
The harm principle is also found in recent US case law - in the case of the People v Alvarez, from the Supreme Court of California, in May, 2002:

The harm principle even found its way into the drug laws of Columbia, in 1994, and again in 2009:

Even if a self-regarding action results in harm to oneself, it may still be considered beyond the sphere of justifiable state coercion.

==== Libertarianism ====
The belief &quot;that no one should be forcibly prevented from acting in any way he chooses provided his acts are not invasive of the free acts of others&quot; has become one of the basic principles of libertarian politics.

The US Libertarian Party includes a version of the harm principle as part of its official party platform. It states:

== Broader definitions of harm ==
In the same essay, Mill further explains the principle as a function of two maxims:

The second of these maxims has become known as the social authority principle.

However, the second maxim also raises the question of broader definitions of harm, including harm to the society. Harm is not limited to harm to another individual but can extend to groups or communities, without specifying the affected individuals.

This is an important principle for the purpose of determining harm that only manifests gradually over time—such that the resulting harm can be anticipated, but does not yet exist at the time that the action causing harm was taken. It also applies to other issues—which range from the right of an entity to discharge broadly polluting waste on private property, to broad questions of licensing, and to the right of sedition.

Harm can also result from a failure to meet an obligation. Morality generates obligations. Duty may be exacted from a person in the same way as a debt, and it is part of the notion of duty that a person may be rightfully compelled to fulfill it.

== Criticism ==
Stewart Hamish has argued that the harm principle does not provide a narrow scope of which actions count as harmful towards oneself or the population and that it cannot be used to determine whether people can be punished for their actions by the state. A state can determine whether an action is punishable by determining what harm the action causes. If a morally unjust action occurs but leaves no indisputable form of harm, there is no justification for the state to act and punish the perpetrators for their actions. The harm principle has an ambiguous definition of what harm specifically is and what justifies a state to intervene.

Ben Saunders has also said that the harm principle does not specify on whether the state is justified with intervention tactics. The ambiguity can lead a state to define what counts as a harmful self-regarding action at its own discretion. That freedom might allow for an individual&#x27;s own liberty and rights to be in danger. It would not be plausible for a state to intervene with an action that will negatively affect the population more than an individual. The harm principle scope of usage has been described as too wide to follow directly and to implement possible punishment by a state.

<text>Abū al-ʿAbbās Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī () also known as Alfraganus in the West (870), was an astronomer in the Abbasid court in Baghdad, and one of the most famous astronomers in the 9th century. Al-Farghani composed several works on astronomy and astronomical equipment that were widely distributed in Arabic and Latin and were influential to many scientists. His best known work, &quot;Kitāb fī Jawāmiʿ ʿIlm al-Nujūmi&quot; (whose name translates to &quot;Elements of astronomy on the celestial motions&quot;), was an extensive summary of Ptolemy&#x27;s Almagest containing revised and more accurate experimental data. Christopher Columbus used Al Farghani&#x27;s calculations for his voyages to America (but mistakenly interpreted Arabic miles as Roman miles). In addition to making substantial contributions to astronomy, al-Farghani also worked as an engineer, supervising construction projects on rivers in Cairo, Egypt. The lunar crater &quot;Alfraganus&quot; is named after him.

==Life==
Al-Farghani was born sometime in the early 9th century, and his last name suggests that his birthplace was most likely in Quva city, Farghana, Uzbekistan. He has been described as Persian. He was involved in the calculation of the diameter of the Earth by the measurement of the meridian arc length, together with a team of scientists under the patronage of the ʿAbbāsid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mūn in Baghdad. Later he moved to Cairo, where he composed a treatise on the astrolabe around 856. There, he also supervised the construction of the large Nilometer, called the New Nilometer, on the Rawda Island (in Old Cairo) at the behest of the ʿAbbāsid caliph al-Mutawakkil, which was completed in the year 861. This instrument allowed the height of the Nile to be measured in the event of a flood. Also in Cairo, al-Farghani was tasked with building a canal, called al-Ja‘fari, by the two brothers Muhammad and Ahmad ibn Musa, who were themselves ordered by al-Mutawakkil to oversee the construction of the canal. Reports indicate that al-Farghani made a critical mistake in the design of the canal, and had the entrance of the canal dug too deep for water to enter the rest of the canal without unusually high water levels. Al-Mutawakkil was enraged when he heard of the mistake, and so he sent Sanad ibn ‘Ali to assess the culpability of the brothers Muhammad and Ahmad who contracted al-Fraghani to build it. Sanad ibn ‘Ali ultimately reported (deceitfully) to al-Mutawakkil that there was no mistake in the design of the canal created by al-Farghani, which delayed any consequences long enough for the controversy to cease abruptly after the assassination of al-Mutawakkil in 861 that resulted in the canal remaining unfinished. Al-Farghani died in Egypt sometime after 861.

There is some debate about whether the two names for al-Farghani, Muhammad ibn Kath lr and Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kat, mentioned in historical sources refer to two different people, but most historians argue that both names describe just one al-Farghani.

==Works==
The most influential work produced by al-Farghani was his textbook &quot;Kitāb fī Jawāmiʿ ʿIlm al-Nujūm&quot; ( &quot;A Compendium of the Science of the Stars&quot;) or &quot;Elements of astronomy on the celestial motions&quot;, written sometime between about 833 and 857. &quot;Elements&quot; was a descriptive summary of Ptolemy&#x27;s Almagest that included the findings and revised values of earlier Islamic astronomers. Among the revisions included in the book were corrections to calculations of the circumference of the Earth, the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt, and the apsides of the Sun and the Moon. Though al-Farghani&#x27;s summary of Almagest contained these numerical corrections, the summary itself did not emphasize the mathematics of Ptolemy&#x27;s astronomical theory and was instead focused more on conveying the conceptual parts of the theory in an easily-understood manner. Al-Farghani&#x27;s book was translated into Latin in the 12th century by John of Seville in 1135 and later by Gerard of Cremona prior to 1175. These translations remained very popular in Europe until the time of Regiomontanus. Dante Alighieri&#x27;s knowledge of Ptolemaic astronomy, which is evident in his &quot;Divina Commedia&quot; as well as other works such as the &quot;Convivio&quot;, seems to have been drawn from his reading of Alfraganus. &quot;Elements&quot; was also translated into Hebrew by Jacob Anatoli sometime from 1231 to 1235. This translation of &quot;Elements&quot; contains an additional section discussing Ptolemy&#x27;s 48 constellations, which was probably also written by al-Farghani, but is not found in other translations of the book. Drawing primarily from Anatoli&#x27;s Hebrew translation, but also from John of Seville&#x27;s previous Latin translation, Jacob Christmann translated yet another Latin translation of &quot;Elements&quot; in 1590. In the 17th century the Dutch orientalist Jacob Golius published the Arabic text on the basis of a manuscript he had acquired in the Near East, accompanied by Golius&#x27; own Latin translation, the last recorded, and extensive notes and revisions.

Al-Farghani also wrote several documents about astronomical instruments. His most famous is his treatise on the astrolabe, which is the oldest surviving document that details the theoretical construction and use of the tool. Although historical sources indicate that there were probably other documents regarding the theory of astrolabes (including one written by al-Khwarizmi) circulating around the time that al-Farghani wrote his treatise, al-Farghani notes in his treatise that he was not aware of any such documents, suggesting that his treatise was a purely original work. Al-Farghani&#x27;s treatise on the astrolabe provides the mathematical basis for the construction of the astrolabe, along with tables containing thousands of data points enabling the construction of astrolabes that function at varying lines of longitude. Though a theoretical basis for the construction of an astrolabe is presented in this work, the treatise lacked specific methods for physical construction because the purpose of the treatise was not to give instructions for building an astrolabe, but rather to provide mathematical justification for the functionality of the astrolabe. The work &quot;Kitāb al-Fihrist&quot; by Ibn al-Nadim suggests that al-Farghani was also responsible for writing a book about the use and function of sundials, though no copies exist in the present day.

In the 15th century, Christopher Columbus used al-Farghani&#x27;s estimate for the Earth&#x27;s circumference as the basis for his voyages to America. However, Columbus mistook al-Farghani&#x27;s 7091-foot Arabic mile to be a 4856-foot Roman mile. This error caused him to underestimate the Earth&#x27;s circumference, leading him to sail to North America while he believed that he was taking a shortcut to Asia.

<doc id="607964" wikidata="Q5750135" url="?curid=607964" title="Hi-5 (Australian group)">
<text>Hi-5 were an Australian children&#x27;s musical group formed in 1998 in association with the children&#x27;s television series of the same name. Helena Harris and Posie Graeme-Evans created the television series for the Nine Network, which premiered in 1999. The group were made up of five performers who entertained and educated preschool children through music, movement and play. Kellie Crawford, Kathleen de Leon Jones, Nathan Foley, Tim Harding and Charli Robinson were the founding members. By the end of 2008, all of the original line-up had left, and the group&#x27;s membership changed several more times after that. They collectively starred in several television series, released albums, and performed on worldwide tours. The television series features puppet characters Chatterbox and Jup Jup, who were included in the group&#x27;s live stage shows.

Hi-5 were one of Australia&#x27;s highest paid entertainment groups, placing in the &quot;Business Review Weekly&quot;″s annual list several times, earning an estimated A$18 million in 2007. As employees of the brand, once owned by the Nine Network, the members of Hi-5 did not hold equity. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified their albums as double platinum (&quot;It a Party&quot;), platinum (&quot;Jump and Jive with Hi-5&quot;, &quot;Boom Boom Beat&quot;, &quot;It a Hi-5 Christmas&quot;) and gold (&quot;Celebrate&quot;). Four of them reached the top 10 on the ARIA Albums Chart; &quot;It a Party&quot; (number four, July 2000), &quot;Boom Boom Beat&quot; (number three, August 2001), &quot;It&quot; &quot;a Hi-5 Christmas&quot; (number four, December 2001) and &quot;Hi-5 Hits&quot; (number ten, July 2003). By 2004, the original line-up had received three Logie Television Awards for Most Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program and five consecutive ARIA Music Awards for Best Children&#x27;s Album.

The group&#x27;s later iterations did not enjoy the same popularity or critical success as its original line-up. Hi-5 were last nominated for a major Australian award in 2012 and last released an album in 2014. The Nine Network sold the brand in 2012 to Malaysian-based group Asiasons, who shifted its commercial focus to the Southeast Asian market. After a short-lived television revival in 2017, the group&#x27;s production company wholly relocated to Singapore and began employing a roster of temporary performers for touring purposes until 2019.

==History==
===1998–1999: Formation===
Hi-5 were formed in September 1998 in Sydney, Australia, as a children&#x27;s musical group. Television producer Helena Harris, who had worked on &quot;Bananas in Pyjamas&quot;, co-created Hi-5 as a concept for a new television show of the same name for the Nine Network. She and co-producer Posie Graeme-Evans developed the series as preschool entertainment, blending educational theories with a musical appeal to capture children&#x27;s attention. Harris said that while &quot;Hi-5&quot; was predominantly a television series, its music was able to be differentiated from the show. Featuring five performers, the cast were intended to act as the audience&#x27;s older siblings or friends, rather than adults teaching children. Harris was inspired to develop a show with broad appeal and accessible themes such as family and animals. She modelled the group&#x27;s style on the fast-paced nature of contemporary music videos and strove to allude to items of current interest (such as relevant curriculum as well as popular jokes, films and music) to keep children engaged. Harris recalled watching the Spice Girls, whose dance moves she believed preschoolers could copy. The creators saw the need for &quot;life-affirming&quot; television for rapidly maturing preschoolers and found most children learn from programs which use music and movement.

After auditions for the group in June 1998 (narrowing down around 300 people to only five), the television pilot for &quot;Hi-5&quot; was produced in mid-1998. The original cast consisted of Kellie Crawford (née Hoggart), Kathleen de Leon Jones, Nathan Foley, Tim Harding and Charli Robinson. After being commissioned, production began in October 1998. The first series premiered in April 1999 on the Nine Network. In September, Sony Music released their debut album, &quot;Jump and Jive with Hi-5&quot;, which reached number 33 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart.

===2000–2006: Early success===

Hi-5 won the 2000 Logie Award for Most Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program in recognition of their television program, and the ARIA Award for Best Children&#x27;s Album for &quot;Jump and Jive with Hi-5&quot;. Their releases consistently received album accreditations; &quot;Celebrate&quot; was certified as gold, while &quot;Jump and Jive with Hi-5&quot;, &quot;Boom Boom Beat&quot; and &quot;It a Hi-5 Christmas&quot; went platinum, and &quot;It a Party&quot; received double platinum status. Four of their albums reached the top 10 on the ARIA Albums Chart; &quot;It a Party&quot; (number four, July 2000), &quot;Boom Boom Beat&quot; (number three, August 2001), &quot;It a Hi-5 Christmas&quot; (number four, December 2001) and &quot;Hi-5 Hits&quot; (number ten, July 2003). It was reported in 2005 that a feature film starring the group was in early development, as well as arrangements for a single release.

Hi-5 toured nationally for up to eight months of every year, with sell-out concerts in venues such as the Sydney Opera House. The quintet&#x27;s production of &quot;Hi-5 Alive&quot; won the 2002 Helpmann Award for Best Presentation for Children, while their &quot;Space Magic&quot; production was nominated in the same category in 2006. The group first toured the UK in 2004, and in 2005 performed in arenas around Australia to maximise the audience capacity. In addition to their regular tours, Hi-5 appeared annually at Vision Australia″s Carols by Candlelight in Melbourne, broadcast live by the Nine Network on Christmas Eve.

===2006–2008: Replacement of original members===

In early 2006, de Leon Jones announced she was pregnant, and would take maternity leave from April onwards. Sun Park was introduced as her temporary replacement; de Leon Jones gave birth to her first child in July. Park was part of the television series filming in 2006 and toured with the group across Australia. In July 2006, de Leon Jones said she was intent on returning to Hi-5; however, in July 2007, made the decision to leave the group permanently to focus on being a mother. Park took her place as a full-time member.

A serious motorcycle accident in June 2007 left Harding unable to keep up with the pace of Hi-5&#x27;s performances. Just a few days before this, Stevie Nicholson had been hired as an understudy and was put straight to work as a temporary replacement for Harding. The group toured the &quot;Hi-5 Circus Stageshow&quot; in 2007; the show adopted a circus theme and incorporated tricks such as trapeze, tightrope walking and gymnastics. They had only one week of training; some members benefitted from prior experience. Nicholson debuted on tour with the &quot;Circus&quot; show in Singapore. Harding permanently departed in November after recovering from his injuries and was replaced by Nicholson.

Robinson (then referred to as Delaney) exited from the group in February 2008. She expressed an interest in proving herself as an actor for an adult audience and said she would help find a replacement member. After leaving, she established a career in the Australian media industry as a presenter. In April, Casey Burgess was revealed as Robinson&#x27;s replacement and began touring with the group.

In March 2008, the Nine Network, along with production company Southern Star, purchased the Hi-5 brand. The change of ownership saw Harris and Graeme-Evans end their involvement with the franchise, which was placed under the direction of Martin Hersov and Cathy Payne, Nine and Southern Star executives.

By November 2008, the remaining original cast members had stated their intent to withdraw from the group. Crawford reported in October that she would be leaving at the end of the year to explore other options, and a month later, Foley outlined his plan to exit and focus on his adult music career. In December, Park also stated she would be departing the group since she had expected only to be a temporary replacement. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s &quot;Sydney Confidential&quot; reporter alleged that Hi-5&#x27;s production company had asked Crawford and Foley to leave, and that the producers were &quot;opting to recruit younger, cheaper performers&quot;. Neither of them responded to these reports, but Park denied the industry rumours, saying that there had been no pressure for any of them to resign. The departing members gave their final performance at Carols by Candlelight on Christmas Eve in Melbourne.

===2009–2013: Second generation===

In February 2009, Lauren Brant, Fely Irvine and Tim Maddren joined Nicholson and Burgess to complete the group&#x27;s new line-up. Burgess described the change as a difficult transition period that led to uncertainty over their future. They toured regional Australian locations in early 2010 to build a new audience. The group celebrated the 500th episode of the television series in 2010, and in 2011, they rerecorded several of the original line-up&#x27;s songs. They did not receive the same positive critical reception as the original members; one reviewer found fault with the new line-up&#x27;s vocal abilities. The group joined World Vision Australia as ambassadors in 2009, beginning their work in the Philippines while on a promotional tour, and completing a volunteer trip to Cambodia in 2012. They also became representatives of the Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation in 2009; their work included regular visits to hospitals while on tour.

Irvine&#x27;s final performance as part of Hi-5 was at Carols by Candlelight on Christmas Eve 2011. Nine Network representatives said she would leave to explore &quot;other career options&quot;. Her replacement, Dayen Zheng, joined the group in January 2012. Burgess and Maddren departed in early 2013; Maddren had secured a role in the Australian musical production of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, while Burgess had decided to further her solo music career.

In June 2012, the Nine Network announced that because of their ongoing financial difficulties, they had sold the Hi-5 brand in its entirety to Malaysian-based equity group, Asiasons. Datuk Jared Lim, Asiasons&#x27;s managing director, described plans to expand Hi-5 throughout Southeast Asia, while keeping the group&#x27;s presence in Australia intact. Julie Greene, former producer of the television series, assumed the role of executive creative director.

===2013–2016: Third generation, shift to Southeast Asia===
New members Mary Lascaris and Ainsley Melham joined Nicholson, Brant, and Zheng in early 2013. The audition process was filmed and turned into a documentary-style film, &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot;, which premiered exclusively through Hoyts Cinemas in Australia in March. The press branded this line-up as a &quot;new generation&quot; of the group.

Throughout this period, the production company shifted the commercial focus of the group to the Southeast Asian market, with an increase in Asian touring locations. In 2014, the group debuted in the Middle East with a Dubai show and toured Bangkok for the first time in ten years. They returned to the Philippines in 2015 for an encore season after a sold-out run of concerts the previous year. A new television series entitled &quot;Hi-5 House&quot; was filmed in Singapore and Malaysia between 2013 and 2015, and aired on pay-TV channel Nick Jr. in Australia and Disney Junior in Asia; its success in Asia resulted in an Asian Television Award for Best Preschool Program in 2015. The program premiered worldwide on online television streaming service Netflix in March 2016.

Brant&#x27;s final performances were in July 2014 for the Australian &quot;House Hits&quot; tour, in which the cast wore costumes she designed under her new fashion label, Loliboli. Her successor, Tanika Anderson, was already working with the group as an understudy and puppeteer. Nicholson departed in December 2015 to further his performing career and promote his children&#x27;s book, &quot;Superdudes&quot;. He was replaced by Lachie Dearing, who was introduced on tour in January 2016. After being cast in an Australian musical production of &quot;Xanadu&quot; in January 2016, Melham left the group, and new member Gabe Brown took his place in February. Brown was later succeeded by Chris White.

===2016–2019: Fourth generation, short-lived television revival===
The Nine Network renewed its partnership with the Hi-5 franchise in October 2016 and expressed plans to revive the original television series with a new cast in 2017. As a result, Zheng, Lascaris, Anderson and White gave their last performances in December 2016. After auditions were held in November 2016, new members Courtney Clarke, Shay Clifford, Joe Kalou and Bailey Spalding were revealed in December, joining Dearing to form the fourth generation of the group. The quintet debuted at Carols by Candlelight on Christmas Eve, Hi-5&#x27;s first appearance at the Nine event since 2012. The new television series was filmed in Malaysia and premiered in May 2017 on Nine&#x27;s multichannel, 9Go! in Australia. Additional filming in 2018 was halted before the Australian production office was closed and the brand was relocated to Singapore. All five members departed the group, and the brand used temporary touring members for the remainder of 2018. The franchise continued employing non-permanent performers for touring purposes in 2019.

==Musical style==
Hi-5 were described as &quot;a pop group for kids&quot; by Foley in 2004. Chris Harriott was the group&#x27;s primary composer, writing thousands of their tracks. Graeme-Evans and Harriott had worked together when he scored the themes for the teen dramas series, &quot;The Miraculous Mellops&quot; (1991) and &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; (1995), and he had worked on his own in Australian theatre. The creators approached him and tasked him with writing top ten songs for an age range of two to six. Harriott worked regularly with a group of lyricists, including Chris Phillips, Leone Carey and Lisa Hoppe. Foley cited the Wiggles as an influence of Hi-5, but noted the respective groups had different musical styles, with Harriott&#x27;s compositions resembling top 40 rather than nursery rhymes. Original member of the Wiggles and classical musician Phillip Wilcher commended the gentle educational appeal of Hi-5&#x27;s music, and declared that they seemed to &quot;know the subtle difference between childlike and childish.&quot;

===Educational value===
Hi-5, and the related television series, blended educational aspects with music and movement, while regularly updating the music and costumes to remain &quot;abreast of the times&quot;. The members were presented as older siblings or friends to their young audience, rather than appearing as adults teaching them. The series&#x27; creators loosely based it on an underlying educational structure influenced by Howard Gardner″s theory of multiple intelligences. The producers recognised that most children have a preferred style of learning, and structured the group&#x27;s work to have each member modelling skills in a specific area such as kinesthetic learning and musicality. Harris observed most children would identify with the presenter who demonstrated their favoured learning style. According to the group&#x27;s website, Hi-5 incorporated Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development. The educational theory caters to a wide range of ages in the audience while being aimed primarily at children aged two to eight. Harris intended for the central themes promoted to be universally accessible, as she believed children are essentially the same around the world. The pace and design of the group&#x27;s performances were influenced by that of contemporary music videos. They encouraged participation at their live stage shows through interactive elements with which the children engage. Group members expressed that performances were adapted to include more songs and physical elements in countries where English is not the main spoken language.

==Brand and finances==
Hi-5 brand creators, Harris and Graeme-Evans, originally owned it under their joint production company Kids Like Us. In contrast to their peer entertainers, the Wiggles, the cast of Hi-5 did not hold equity, but were employees of the brand. Crawford noted, &quot;the money system has to go a long way around before it gets to us&quot;. In March 2008, the Nine Network and production company Southern Star purchased the Hi-5 brand. The franchise was placed under the direction of Martin Hersov and Cathy Payne, Nine and Southern Star executives, while Harris and Graeme-Evans ended their involvement with the company with the sale.

The brand dropped from a net worth of A$18 million in 2009 to A$9.7 million in 2010. In June 2012, the Nine Network sold the Hi-5 brand to Asian equity group, Asiasons, through a private fund. The company planned to expand the brand throughout Southeast Asia, while maintaining its presence in Australia. Former series&#x27; producer Julie Greene became the brand&#x27;s executive creative director. The Hi-5 brand was consolidated under Tremendous Entertainment in 2014, after the equity fund was sold. The Nine Network renewed its partnership with the Hi-5 franchise in October 2016 and participated in the production of a new television series in 2017. In September 2018, the Australian production office was closed; the entire franchise relocated to Singapore.

The franchise launched a series of international versions; each group toured and produced local adaptations of the television series. In 2002, an American version of Hi-5 was created; the group filmed for television, recorded albums and toured. By 2005, franchises local to India, South America and Germany were planned, but these did not eventuate. A television series and a tour introduced the UK group in 2008. After the brand&#x27;s sale in 2012, there was a return to licensing international groups. In 2014, a Latin American group was created, followed by a local version for the Philippines in 2015, and the introduction of an Indonesian group in 2017.

==Reception==

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Business Review Weekly&quot;″s annual Australian income list recognised the group as one of the country&#x27;s highest paid entertainment groups, estimating annual earnings of A$18 million in 2007. The franchise was reported as Australia&#x27;s highest selling children&#x27;s music property in 2007. The original quintet consistently received album ARIA accreditations for their releases: &quot;Celebrate&quot; was accredited as gold, while &quot;Jump and Jive with Hi-5&quot;, &quot;Boom Boom Beat&quot; and &quot;It a Hi-5 Christmas&quot; went platinum. &quot;It a Party&quot; received double platinum status. Four of the original line-up&#x27;s albums reached the top 10 on the ARIA Albums Chart&quot;It a Party&quot; peaked at number four in July 2000; &quot;Boom Boom Beat&quot; reached number three in August 2001; &quot;It a Hi-5 Christmas&quot; at number four in December 2001; and their greatest hits album, &quot;Hi-5 Hits&quot;, reached number ten in July 2003.

===Critical reviews===

Critics in the Australian press often described Hi-5 as quality children&#x27;s entertainment. The original line-up were praised both as a cohesive ensemble, and for their talents at singing and dancing. Reviewers highlighted the group members&#x27; energy and enthusiasm. Hi-5&#x27;s music has been described as simple, &quot;infectious&quot;, and inspired by pop music. The brand&#x27;s employment of diverse performers, to serve as positive role models for children, was well-received. The group&#x27;s concert tours were admired for the fast pace of the shows and the bright colours of the staging design. Reviewing the &quot;Circus Stageshow&quot; in 2008, Nicole Bittar of &quot;The Age&quot; described the members as versatile and cheerful, and commended their circus skills. A 2015 concert was viewed by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as &quot;well-choreographed and performed&quot;. The group&#x27;s productions have also been noted for their humour, incorporating slapstick elements inspired by pantomime comedy. Reporters said they had a teenage and adult following, with dedicated older fans; adult followers in the Philippines would use the group&#x27;s songs to learn English.
Later iterations of the group were criticised for their performances, and the brand was criticised for frequent membership changes. In her blog for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2011, Sarrah Le Marquand found fault with Brant&#x27;s musical abilities, claiming that while she was an enthusiastic entertainer, she had limited vocal talent. The reporter went on to suggest the entire line-up at the time were &quot;melodically challenged&quot;. A business blog argued that the group&#x27;s target audience was unclear; while the franchise was aimed at preschoolers, the music and choreography seemed too complicated and like it was designed for an audience of older children. The writer stated that the group had undefined member roles and that the performers attempted to upstage each other. Similarly, in a 2011 survey by the Australian Council on Children and the Media, parents condemned the costuming of the group, stating it was inappropriate for the audience and &quot;premature sexualisation&quot;. Commentators have expressed disapproval of the franchise frequently replacing its performers with new talent; the newer line-ups were described as unrecognisable. Critiquing the debut of a new line-up at Carols by Candlelight in 2016, David Knox wrote that the performance was unmemorable, and suggested that their strengths were not demonstrated at the event.

<text>Carcinology is a branch of zoology that consists of the study of crustaceans. Crustaceans are a large class of arthropods classified by having a hard exoskeleton made of chitin or chitin and calcium, three body regions, and jointed, paired appendages. Crustaceans include lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill, copepods, barnacles and crabs. Most crustaceans are aquatic, but some can be terrestrial, sessile, or parasitic. Other names for carcinology are malacostracology, crustaceology, and crustalogy, and a person who studies crustaceans is a &quot;carcinologist&quot; or occasionally a &quot;malacostracologist&quot;, a &quot;crustaceologist&quot;, or a &quot;crustalogist&quot;.

The word &quot;&quot; derives from Greek , &quot;karkínos&quot;, &quot;crab&quot;; and , &quot;-logia&quot;.

==Subfields==
Carcinology is a subdivision of arthropodology, the study of arthropods which includes arachnids, insects, and myriapods. Carcinology branches off into taxonomically oriented disciplines such as:
* astacology – the study of crayfish
* cirripedology – the study of barnacles
* copepodology – the study of copepods
* arachnology – the study of arachnids

==Journals==
Scientific journals devoted to the study of crustaceans include:
* &quot;Crustaceana&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Crustacean Biology&quot;
* &quot;Nauplius&quot;

<text>Albert Christoph Dies (175528 December 1822) was a German painter, engraver, and biographer most noted for his biography of Joseph Haydn, although it is now considered sentimental and not entirely accurate. As an artist, he is also not very well-regarded.

==As painter==
Dies was born in Hanover (baptized 11 February 1755), and began his studies there. For one year he studied in the academy of Düsseldorf, and then he started at the age of twenty with thirty ducats in his pocket for Rome, studying briefly on the way in Mannheim and Basel. In Rome he lived a frugal life till 1796; his son Johannes (Giovanni) was born there in 1776. Copying pictures, chiefly by Salvator Rosa, for a livelihood, his taste led him to draw and paint from nature in Tivoli, Albano and other picturesque places in the vicinity of Rome. Naples, the birthplace of his favorite master, he visited more than once for the same reasons.

Goethe visited him in 1787. The poet, interested in the theory of color, reported in his &quot;Zweiter römischer Aufenthalt&quot; (&quot;Second stay in Rome&quot;), &quot;At the moment I am engaged in something from which I learn a great deal; I have found and sketched a landscape that a clever artist, Dies, colored in my presence; thus eyes and mind grow ever more accustomed to color and harmony.&quot;

During the Rome visit, Dies also composed music, though later on he apparently destroyed all that he had written, and none of it survives today.

At one point, Jacques-Louis David, then composing his &quot;Oath of the Horatii&quot; (1784) at Rome, wished to take him to Paris. But Dies had reasons for not accepting the offer. He was courting a young Roman whom he subsequently married. Meanwhile, he had made the acquaintance of the engraver Giovanni Volpato, for whom he executed numerous drawings, and this no doubt suggested the plan, which he afterwards carried out, of publishing, in partnership with Jacob Wilhelm Mechau, Johann Christian Reinhart and Johann Friedrich Frauenholz, the series of plates known as the &quot;Collection de vues pittoresques de l&#x27;Italie&quot;, published in seventy-two sheets at Nuremberg in 1799.

According to Gotwals, &quot;In May, 1796, Dies apparently eloped with a young girl to Salzburg.&quot; The following year he moved to Vienna, and lived there on the produce of his brush as a landscape painter, and on that of his pencil or graver as a draughtsman and etcher. He also taught landscape painting at the Imperial and Royal Academy, and later, in his final post, was gallery director to Prince Nikolaus Esterházy II. During this time his physical condition grew worse, and he even lost the use of one of his hands.

==As biographer==
Dies was a great admirer of the music of Joseph Haydn and during his Vienna years he undertook to meet the composer and write his biography. He obtained an introduction from his fellow artist Anton Grassi, who had made a number of busts of Haydn. Over the course of three years during Haydn&#x27;s old age (starting 15 April 1805, ending 8 August 1808), Dies made a series of 30 visits to the frail and ailing composer, even though Haydn was convinced no one would be interested in his life story. On a number of occasions Haydn was unable to see him, but frequently Dies was admitted and was able to interview him. In 1810, one year after Haydn&#x27;s death, Dies published a biography based on what he learned in his visits (see References below). This work is organized around the sequence of visits, reporting each in turn. It continues to serve as a substantial source of information on the composer&#x27;s life.

Compared with another biography written at the same time by Georg August Griesinger, Dies&#x27;s work is almost certainly less accurate and is more likely to have been sentimentalized and embellished, which he himself alludes to in the introduction of his book:

In order not to leave out of the picture the most interesting phase of Haydn&#x27;s life, I meanwhile made unhesitating use of several articles from the Leipzig &quot;Musikalische Zeitung&quot;, without entirely suppressing my own untutored opinions.

For instances of probable embellishment, see Mathias Haydn and Haydn and Mozart; for an apparent outright blunder, see Rebecca Schroeter. Dies&#x27;s translator Vernon Gotwals, comparing Dies to Griesinger, concludes:

It is now clear that for facts about Haydn one will turn first to the &quot;Biographische Notizen&quot; of Griesinger, but that reliance upon that source alone would deprive Haydn&#x27;s portrait of many authentic details, mixed inescapably with some imaginary ones. Dies&#x27;s &quot;Biographische Nachrichten&quot; is the work of a sentimental artist who fancied himself a &quot;universal man&quot; but whose approach to the problem of biography was that of his time and place.
==Death==
In 1787, he accidentally swallowed of lead acetate. He never recovered from the ensuing lead poisoning, which caused the loss of use of one of his hands, and eventually died in Vienna on 28 December 1822.

==Assessment==
Dies is perhaps better known today from his acquaintanceship (e.g. Goethe, Haydn) than from his own merits as an artist or writer.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition gives harsh opinions of Dies&#x27;s work as an artist:

*&quot;[In Rome] he became a bold executant in water-colours and in oil, though he failed to acquire any originality of his own.&quot;
*&quot;Lord Bristol, who encouraged him as a copyist, predicted that he would be a second Salvator Rosa. However, Dies did not have the creativity necessary to become a great artist.&quot;
*&quot;With so many irons in the fire Dies naturally lost the power of concentration.&quot;
*&quot;From two pictures now in the Belvedere gallery, and from numerous engraved drawings from the neighborhood of Tivoli, we gather that Dies was never destined to rise above a respectable mediocrity. He followed Salvator Rosa&#x27;s example in imitating the manner of Claude Lorraine. But Salvator adapted the style of Claude, whilst Dies did no more than copy it.&quot;

Gotwals writes, &quot;Friedrich Noack in his article in the Thieme and Becker &quot;Allgemeines Lexicon der bildenden Künstler&quot; [&quot;General lexicon of graphic artists&quot;], describes Dies&#x27;s work as clumsy, mediocre, and prosaic.

Gotwals adds, concerning Dies&#x27;s writing, that &quot;his literary style is hardly better.&quot;

<doc id="608002" wikidata="Q165930" url="?curid=608002" title="Tyramine">
<text>Tyramine ( ) (also spelled tyramin), also known under several other names, is a naturally occurring trace amine derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Tyramine acts as a catecholamine releasing agent. Notably, it is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier, resulting in only non-psychoactive peripheral sympathomimetic effects following ingestion. A hypertensive crisis can result, however, from ingestion of tyramine-rich foods in conjunction with the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

==Occurrence==
Tyramine occurs widely in plants and animals, and is metabolized by various enzymes, including monoamine oxidases. In foods, it often is produced by the decarboxylation of tyrosine during fermentation or decay. Foods that are fermented, cured, pickled, aged, or spoiled have high amounts of tyramine. Tyramine levels go up when foods are at room temperature or go past their freshness date.

Specific foods containing considerable amounts of tyramine include:

* Strong or aged cheeses: cheddar, Swiss, Parmesan, Stilton, Gorgonzola or blue cheeses, Camembert, feta, Muenster
* Meats that are cured, smoked, or processed: such as salami, pepperoni, dry sausages, hot dogs, bologna, bacon, corned beef, pickled or smoked fish, caviar, aged chicken livers, soups or gravies made from meat extract
* Pickled or fermented foods: sauerkraut, kimchi, tofu (especially stinky tofu), pickles, miso soup, bean curd, tempeh, sourdough breads
* Condiments: soy, shrimp, fish, miso, teriyaki, and bouillon-based sauces
* Drinks: beer (especially tap or home-brewed), vermouth, red wine, sherry, liqueurs
* Beans, vegetables, and fruits: fermented or pickled vegetables, overripe fruits
* Chocolate

Scientists more and more consider tyramine in food as an aspect of safety. They propose projects of regulations aimed to enact control of biogenic amines in food by various strategies, including usage of proper fermentation starters, or preventing their decarboxylase activity. Some authors wrote that this has already given positive results, and tyramine content in food is now lower than it has been in the past. 

===In plants===
Mistletoe (toxic and not used by humans as a food, but historically used as a medicine).

===In animals===
Tyramine also plays a role in animals including: In behavioral and motor functions in &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;; &quot;Locusta migratoria&quot; swarming behaviour; and various nervous roles in &quot;Rhipicephalus&quot;, &quot;Apis&quot;, &quot;Locusta&quot;, &quot;Periplaneta&quot;, &quot;Drosophila&quot;, &quot;Phormia&quot;, &quot;Papilio&quot;, &quot;Bombyx&quot;, &quot;Chilo&quot;, &quot;Heliothis&quot;, &quot;Mamestra&quot;, &quot;Agrotis&quot;, and &quot;Anopheles&quot;.

==Biological activity==
Tyramine is a norepinephrine and dopamine releasing agent (NDRA) and indirectly acting sympathomimetic. Evidence for the presence of tyramine in the human brain has been confirmed by postmortem analysis. Additionally, the possibility that tyramine acts directly as a neuromodulator was revealed by the discovery of a G protein-coupled receptor with high affinity for tyramine, called the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR1). The TAAR1 receptor is found in the brain, as well as peripheral tissues, including the kidneys. Tyramine is a full agonist of the TAAR1 in rodents and humans.

Tyramine is physiologically metabolized by monoamine oxidases (primarily MAO-A), FMO3, PNMT, DBH, and CYP2D6. Human monoamine oxidase enzymes metabolize tyramine into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. If monoamine metabolism is compromised by the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and foods high in tyramine are ingested, a hypertensive crisis can result, as tyramine also can displace stored monoamines, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, from pre-synaptic vesicles. Tyramine is considered a &quot;false neurotransmitter&quot;, as it enters noradrenergic nerve terminals and displaces large amounts of norepinephrine, which enters the blood stream and causes vasoconstriction.

Additionally, cocaine has been found to block blood pressure rise that is originally attributed to tyramine, which is explained by the blocking of adrenaline by cocaine from reabsorption to the brain.

The first signs of this effect were discovered by a British pharmacist who noticed that his wife, who at the time was on MAOI medication, had severe headaches when eating cheese. For this reason, it is still called the &quot;cheese reaction&quot; or &quot;cheese crisis&quot;, although other foods can cause the same problem.

Most processed cheeses do not contain enough tyramine to cause hypertensive effects, although some aged cheeses (such as Stilton) do.

A large dietary intake of tyramine (or a dietary intake of tyramine while taking MAO inhibitors) can cause the tyramine pressor response, which is defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure of 30 mmHg or more. The increased release of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from neuronal cytosol or storage vesicles is thought to cause the vasoconstriction and increased heart rate and blood pressure of the pressor response. In severe cases, adrenergic crisis can occur. Although the mechanism is unclear, tyramine ingestion also triggers migraine attacks in sensitive individuals and can even lead to stroke. Vasodilation, dopamine, and circulatory factors are all implicated in the migraines. Double-blind trials suggest that the effects of tyramine on migraine may be adrenergic.

Research reveals a possible link between migraines and elevated levels of tyramine. A 2007 review published in Neurological Sciences presented data showing migraine and cluster diseases are characterized by an increase of circulating neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (including tyramine, octopamine, and synephrine) in the hypothalamus, amygdala, and dopaminergic system. People with migraine are over-represented among those with inadequate natural monoamine oxidase, resulting in similar problems to individuals taking MAO inhibitors. Many migraine attack triggers are high in tyramine.

If one has had repeated exposure to tyramine, however, there is a decreased pressor response; tyramine is degraded to octopamine, which is subsequently packaged in synaptic vesicles with norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Therefore, after repeated tyramine exposure, these vesicles contain an increased amount of octopamine and a relatively reduced amount of norepinephrine. When these vesicles are secreted upon tyramine ingestion, there is a decreased pressor response, as less norepinephrine is secreted into the synapse, and octopamine does not activate alpha or beta adrenergic receptors.

When using a MAO inhibitor (MAOI), an intake of approximately 10 to 25 mg of tyramine is required for a severe reaction, compared to 6 to 10 mg for a mild reaction.

Tyramine, like phenethylamine, is a monoaminergic activity enhancer (MAE) of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in addition to its catecholamine-releasing activity. That is, it enhances the action potential-mediated release of these monoamine neurotransmitters. The compound is active as a MAE at much lower concentrations than the concentrations at which it induces the release of catecholamines. The MAE actions of tyramine and other MAEs may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism.

==Biosynthesis==
Biochemically, tyramine is produced by the decarboxylation of tyrosine via the action of the enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase. Tyramine can, in turn, be converted to methylated alkaloid derivatives &quot;N&quot;-methyltyramine, &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltyramine (hordenine), and &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-trimethyltyramine (candicine).

In humans, tyramine is produced from tyrosine, as shown in the following diagram.

==Chemistry==
In the laboratory, tyramine can be synthesized in various ways, in particular by the decarboxylation of tyrosine.
==Society and culture==
===Legal status===
====United States====
Tyramine is a Schedule I controlled substance, categorized as a hallucinogen, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in the state of Florida without a license at any purity level or any form whatsoever. The language in the Florida statute says tyramine is illegal in &quot;any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any quantity of [tyramine] or that contains any of [its] salts, isomers, including optical, positional, or geometric isomers, and salts of isomers, if the existence of such salts, isomers, and salts of isomers is possible within the specific chemical designation.&quot;

This ban is likely the product of lawmakers overly eager to ban substituted phenethylamines, which tyramine is, in the mistaken belief that ring-substituted phenethylamines are hallucinogenic drugs like the 2C series of psychedelic substituted phenethylamines. The further banning of tyramine&#x27;s optical isomers, positional isomers, or geometric isomers, and salts of isomers where they exist, means that meta-tyramine and phenylethanolamine, a substance found in every living human body, and other common, non-hallucinogenic substances are also illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida. Given that tyramine occurs naturally in many foods and drinks (most commonly as a by-product of bacterial fermentation), e.g. wine, cheese, and chocolate, Florida&#x27;s total ban on the substance may prove difficult to enforce.

<doc id="608006" wikidata="Q937690" url="?curid=608006" title="Pilot ACE">
<text>The Pilot ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) was one of the first computers built in the United Kingdom. Built at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in the early 1950s, it was also one of the earliest general-purpose, stored-program computers – joining other UK designs like the Manchester Mark 1 and EDSAC of the same era. It was a preliminary version of the full ACE, which was designed by Alan Turing, who left NPL before the construction was completed.

==History==
Pilot ACE was built to be a cut-down version of Turing&#x27;s full ACE design. After Turing left NPL (in part because he was disillusioned by the lack of progress on building the ACE), James H. Wilkinson took over the project. Donald Davies, Harry Huskey and Mike Woodger were involved with the design. The Pilot ACE ran its first program on 10 May 1950, and was demonstrated to the press in November 1950.

Although originally intended as a prototype, it became clear that the machine was a potentially useful resource, especially given the lack of other computing devices at the time. After some upgrades to make operational use practical, it went into service in late 1951 and saw considerable operational service over the next several years. One reason Pilot ACE was useful is that it was able to perform floating-point arithmetic necessary for scientific calculations. Wilkinson tells the story of how this came to be.

When first built, Pilot ACE did not have hardware for either multiplication or division, in contrast to other computers at that time. (Hardware multiplication was added later.) Pilot ACE started out using fixed-point multiplication and division implemented as software. It soon became apparent that fixed-point arithmetic was a bad idea because the numbers quickly went out of range. It only took a short time to write new software so that Pilot ACE could do floating-point arithmetic. After that, James Wilkinson became an expert and wrote a book on rounding errors in floating-point calculations, which eventually sold well.

Pilot ACE used approximately 800 vacuum tubes. Its main memory consisted of mercury delay lines with an original capacity of 128 words of 32 bits each, which was later expanded to 352 words. A 4096-word drum memory was added in 1954. Its basic clock rate, 1 megahertz, was the fastest of the early British computers. The time to execute instructions was highly dependent on where they were in memory (due to the use of delay-line memory). An addition could take anywhere from 64 to 1024 microseconds.

The machine was so successful that a commercial version of it, named the DEUCE, was constructed and sold by the English Electric Company.

Pilot ACE was shut down in May 1955, and was given to the Science Museum, where it remains today.

==Software==

Installing the magnetic drum in 1954 opened the way to develop a control program for running programs dealing with matrices. Following urging by J. M. Hahn of the British Aircraft Corporation, Brian W. Munday developed General Interpretive Programme (GIP), which required only simple codewords to run a collection of programs called &quot;bricks&quot;. Each brick could perform a single task, such as to solve a set of simultaneous equations, to invert a matrix, and to perform matrix multiplication. Though there was nothing new in this concept, where GIP was unique was in the simplicity of the codewords that did not specify the bounds of the matrices. Bounds were taken from the matrix on the drum, where the bounds were the second and third element stored. When a matrix was punched on cards, the bounds were given as the first two elements. Thus, once a program was written, it could run automatically with different sizes of matrices, without needing to change the program.
GIP was running in 1954, and was re-written for DEUCE, the successor to Pilot ACE.

Bricks to be used with GIP were written by M. Woodger, who devised a unique scheme for storing array elements, namely, &quot;block floating&quot;. To use regular floating-point would have required two words for each element. The compromise was to use a single exponent for all the elements of an array. Thus, only one word was required for each element. Only the largest element(s) were normalized. Smaller elements were scaled accordingly. Though there was some loss of precision associated with the smaller elements, it was not great, considering that elements tended to be within a factor of ten of each other. The exponent was stored with the matrix, along with the dimensions.

<text>Darren Day is an English actor, singer and television presenter, known for his West End theatre starring roles.

==Early life==
Day undertook drama classes at evenings and weekends until he was 13, when he turned his attention to snooker. He became a professional snooker player at 17, but found himself drawn to entertainment.

==Career==
Day started his career as part of a comedy cabaret trio when he was 17. He also worked as a Butlin&#x27;s redcoat for a season. He later went solo and auditioned for BBC&#x27;s talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; in 1987 and appeared on the show in 1988, introduced by host Bob Monkhouse. He won several heats and came fourth in the final.

Day made his breakthrough as an actor in London&#x27;s West End theatre, starring in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; when he replaced the departing Phillip Schofield. He then starred in many West End shows, such as &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; and &quot;Godspell&quot; and went on to develop a career as a television presenter, presenting programmes such as &quot;You Bet!&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Try This at Home!&quot;. In 1991, Day presented the &quot;Classic Nursery Rhymes&quot; video.

Day has appeared in many touring stage musicals, including &quot;Summer Holiday&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;, &quot;Hello Dolly&quot; and &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. In 2007, Day made a guest appearance in July on ITV&#x27;s police drama &quot;The Bill&quot;.

In 2001, he appeared in &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;, and in 2002, he appeared in the first series of the reality television show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;

In 2007, Day returned to pantomime at the Lowry, Salford as King Rat in &quot;Dick Whittington&quot;. In 2009 he changed management and was then cast in the musical, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, alongside Kevin Kennedy, which toured the UK. From October 2010 to January 2011, Day played soap villain Danny Houston in the popular series &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;.

In early 2012, Day took on the role of American author Paul Sheldon in a production of &quot;Misery&quot;. The production was nominated for a Time Out Theatre Award. In Autumn 2012, he played HIV-positive gospel singer Gideon in the European premiere of the award-winning USA musical &quot;The Last Session&quot;, for which he was nominated for Best Actor in the Off West End Awards (&quot;The Offies&quot;). In September 2013, he starred in the new musical comedy &quot;Stand Up&quot; with Lionel Blair and Billy Pearce. In 2014, he revisited his cabaret roots when he stepped in for his old friend, Joe Longthorne, who was ill.

<text>Victorian morality is a distillation of the moral views of the middle class in 19th-century Britain, the Victorian era.

Victorian values emerged in all social classes and reached all facets of Victorian living. The values of the period—which can be classed as religion, morality, Evangelicalism, industrial work ethic, and personal improvement—took root in Victorian morality. Contemporary plays and all literature—including old classics, like William Shakespeare&#x27;s works—were cleansed of content considered to be inappropriate for children, or &quot;bowdlerized&quot;.

Historians have generally come to regard the Victorian era as a time of many conflicts, such as the widespread cultivation of an outward appearance of dignity and restraint, together with serious debates about exactly how the new morality should be implemented. The international slave trade was abolished, and this ban was enforced by the Royal Navy. Slavery was ended in all the British colonies, child labour was ended in British factories, and a long debate ensued regarding whether prostitution should be totally abolished or tightly regulated. Male homosexuality remained illegal.

== Personal conduct ==
Victorian morality was a surprising new reality. The changes in moral standards and actual behaviour across the British were profound. Historian Harold Perkin wrote:Between 1780 and 1850 the English ceased to be one of the most aggressive, brutal, rowdy, outspoken, riotous, cruel and bloodthirsty nations in the world and became one of the most inhibited, polite, orderly, tender-minded, prudish and hypocritical.Historians continue to debate the various causes of this dramatic change. Asa Briggs emphasizes the strong reaction against the French Revolution, and the need to focus British efforts on its defeat and not be diverged by pleasurable sins. Briggs also stresses the powerful role of the evangelical movement among the Nonconformists, as well as the evangelical faction inside the established Church of England. The religious and political reformers set up organizations that monitored behaviour, and pushed for government action.

Among the higher social classes, there was a marked decline in gambling, horse races, and obscene theatres; there was much less heavy gambling or patronage of upscale houses of prostitution. The highly visible debauchery characteristic of aristocratic England in the early 19th century simply disappeared.

Historians agree that the middle classes not only professed high personal moral standards, but actually followed them. There is a debate whether the working classes followed suit. Moralists in the late 19th century such as Henry Mayhew decried the slums for their supposed high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births. However new research using computerized matching of data files shows that the rates of cohabitation were quite low—under 5%—for the working class and the poor. By contrast, in 21st-century Britain nearly half of all children are born outside marriage, and nine in ten newlyweds have been cohabitating.

==Slavery==

Opposition to slavery was the main evangelical cause from the late 18th century, led by William Wilberforce (1759–1833). The cause organized very thoroughly, and developed propaganda campaigns that made readers cringe at the horrors of slavery. The same moral fervor and organizational skills carried over into most of the other reform movements. Victoria ascended to the throne in 1837, only four years after the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire. The anti-slavery movement had campaigned for years to achieve the ban, succeeding with a partial abolition in 1807 and the full ban on slave trading, but not slave ownership, which only happened in 1833. It took so long because the anti-slavery morality was pitted against powerful economic interests which claimed their businesses would be destroyed if they were not permitted to exploit slave labour. Eventually, plantation owners in the Caribbean received £20 million in cash compensation, which reflected the average market price of slaves. William E. Gladstone, later a famous reformer, handled the large payments to his father for their hundreds of slaves. The Royal Navy patrolled the Atlantic Ocean, stopping any ships that it suspected of trading African slaves to the Americas and freeing any slaves found. The British had set up a Crown Colony in West Africa—Sierra Leone—and transported freed slaves there. Freed slaves from Nova Scotia founded and named the capital of Sierra Leone &quot;Freetown&quot;.

==Abolishing cruelty==
===Cruelty to animals===

William Wilberforce, Thomas Fowell Buxton and Richard Martin introduced the first legislation to prevent cruelty to animals, the Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822; it pertained only to cattle and it passed easily in 1822.

In the Metropolitan Police Act 1839, &quot;fighting or baiting Lions, Bears, Badgers, Cocks, Dogs, or other Animals&quot; was made a criminal offence. The law laid numerous restrictions on how, when, and where animals could be used. It prohibited owners from letting mad dogs run loose and gave police the right to destroy any dog suspected of being rabid. It prohibited the use of dogs for drawing carts. The law was extended to the rest of England and Wales in 1854. Dog-pulled carts were often used by very poor self-employed men as a cheap means to deliver milk, human foods, animal foods (the cat&#x27;s-meat man), and for collecting refuse (the rag-and-bone man). The dogs were susceptible to rabies; cases of the disease among humans had been on the rise. They also bothered the horses, which were economically much more vital to the city. Evangelicals and utilitarians in the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals persuaded Parliament it was cruel and should be illegal; the Utilitarian element added government inspectors to provide enforcement. The owners had no more use for their dogs, and killed them. Cart dogs were replaced by people with handcarts.

Historian Harold Perkin writes:

===Child labour===

Evangelical religious forces took the lead in identifying the evils of child labour, and legislating against them. Their anger at the contradiction between the conditions on the ground for children of the poor and the middle-class notion of childhood as a time of innocence led to the first campaigns for the imposition of legal protection for children. Reformers attacked child labor from the 1830s onward. The campaign that led to the Factory Acts was spearheaded by rich philanthropists of the era, especially Lord Shaftesbury, who introduced bills in Parliament to mitigate the exploitation of children at the workplace. In 1833, he introduced the Ten Hours Act 1833, which provided that children working in the cotton and woollen mills must be aged nine or above; no person under the age of eighteen was to work more than ten hours a day or eight hours on a Saturday; and no one under twenty-five was to work nights. The Factories Act 1844 said children 9–13 years could work for at most 9 hours a day with a lunch break. Additional legal interventions throughout the century increased the level of childhood protection, despite the resistance from the laissez-faire attitudes against government interference by factory owners. Parliament respected laissez-faire in the case of adult men, and there was minimal interference in the Victorian era.

Unemployed street children suffered too, as novelist Charles Dickens revealed to a large middle class audience the horrors of London street life.

==Sexuality==

Historians Peter Gay and Michael Mason both point out that modern society often confuses Victorian etiquette for a lack of knowledge. For example, people going for a bath in the sea or at the beach would use a bathing machine. Despite the use of the bathing machine, it was still possible to see people bathing nude. Contrary to popular conception, however, Victorian society recognised that both men and women enjoyed copulation.

Regular sex was seen as important to male health. Married women were expected to agree to sex whenever their husbands wished for it, though it was seen as immoral for men to ask for sex in certain situations, such as when their wife was sick. Too much sex was seen as unhealthy, which led to a moral panic about masturbation, especially its perceived prevalence among middle class adolescent boys. Women were expected to be faithful to their husbands, or if unmarried, to refrain from sexual activity. There was more tolerance for men employing prostitutes or engaging in extramarital affairs. In the early Victorian period, a traditional idea that married women had an intense sex drive which needed to be controlled by their husband was still common. As the period progressed, this changed, with wives expected to control the sexual behaviour of men.

Victorians also wrote explicit erotica, perhaps the most famous being the racy tell-all &quot;My Secret Life&quot; by the pseudonym Walter (allegedly Henry Spencer Ashbee), and the magazine &quot;The Pearl&quot;, which was published for several years and reprinted as a paperback book in the 1960s. Victorian erotica also survives in private letters archived in museums and even in a study of women&#x27;s orgasms. Some current historians now believe that the myth of Victorian repression can be traced back to early 20th-century views, such as those of Lytton Strachey, a homosexual member of the Bloomsbury Group, who wrote &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot;.

===Homosexuality===

The enormous expansion of police forces, especially in London, produced a sharp rise in prosecutions for illegal sodomy at midcentury. Male sexuality became a favorite subject of study especially by medical researchers whose case studies explored the progression and symptoms of institutionalized subjects. Henry Maudsley shaped late Victorian views about aberrant sexuality. George Savage and Charles Arthur Mercier wrote about homosexuals living in society. Daniel Hack Tuke&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Psychological Medicine&quot; covered sexual perversion. All these works show awareness of continental insights, as well as moral disdain for the sexual practices described.

Simeon Solomon and poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, as they contemplated their own sexual identities in the 1860s, fastened on the Greek lesbian poet Sappho. They made Victorian intellectuals aware of Sappho, and their writings helped to shape the modern image of lesbianism.

The Labouchere Amendment to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, for the first time, made all male homosexual acts illegal. It provided for two years&#x27; imprisonment for males convicted of committing, or being a party to public or private acts of homosexuality. Lesbian acts—still scarcely known—were ignored. When Oscar Wilde was convicted of violating the statute, and imprisoned for such violations, in 1895, he became the iconic victim of English puritanical repression.

===Prostitution===
During Victorian England, prostitution was seen as a &quot;great social evil&quot; by clergymen and major news organizations, but many feminists viewed prostitution as a means of economic independence for women. Estimates of the number of prostitutes in London in the 1850s vary widely, but in his landmark study, &quot;Prostitution&quot;, William Acton reported an estimation of 8,600 prostitutes in London alone in 1857. The differing views on prostitution have made it difficult to understand its history.

Judith Walkowitz, a professor emerita at the department of history of the Johns Hopkins University, has multiple works focusing on the feminist point of view on the topic of prostitution. Many sources blame economic disparities as leading factors in the rise of prostitution, and Walkowitz writes that the demographic within prostitution varied greatly. However, women who struggled financially were much more likely to be prostitutes than those with a secure source of income. Orphaned or half-orphaned women were more likely to turn to prostitution as a means of income. While overcrowding in urban cities and the amount of job opportunities for females were limited, Walkowitz argues that there were other variables that lead women to prostitution. Walkowitz acknowledges that prostitution allowed for women to feel a sense of independence and self-respect. Although many assume that pimps controlled and exploited these prostitutes, some women managed their own clientele and pricing. It is evident that women were exploited by this system, yet Walkowitz says that prostitution was often their opportunity to gain social and economic independence. Prostitution at this time was regarded by women in the profession to be a short-term position, and once they earned enough money, there were hopes that they would move on to a different profession.

The arguments for and against prostitution varied greatly from it being perceived as a mortal sin or desperate decision to an independent choice. While there were plenty of people publicly denouncing prostitution in England, there were also others who took opposition to them. One event that sparked a lot of controversy was the implementation of the Contagious Diseases Acts. This was a series of three acts in 1864, 1866 and 1869 that allowed police officers to stop women whom they believed to be prostitutes and force them to be examined. If the suspected woman was found with a venereal disease, they placed the woman into a lock hospital. Arguments made against the Acts claimed that the regulations were unconstitutional and that they only targeted women. In 1869, a National Association in opposition of the Acts was created. Because women were excluded from the first National Association, the Ladies National Association was formed. The leader of that organization was Josephine Butler. Butler was an outspoken feminist during this time who fought for many social reforms. Her book &quot;Personal Reminiscences of a Great Crusade&quot; describes her oppositions to the Contagious Diseases Acts. Along with the publication of her book, she also went on tours condemning the Acts throughout the 1870s. Other supporters of reforming the Acts included Quakers, Methodists and many doctors. Eventually the Acts were fully repealed in 1886.

Prostitutes were often presented as victims in sentimental literature such as Thomas Hood&#x27;s poem &quot;The Bridge of Sighs&quot;, Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s novel &quot;Mary Barton&quot;, and Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. The emphasis on the purity of women found in such works as Coventry Patmore&#x27;s &quot;The Angel in the House&quot; led to the portrayal of the prostitute and fallen woman as soiled, corrupted, and in need of cleansing.

This emphasis on female purity was allied to the stress on the homemaking role of women, who helped to create a space free from the pollution and corruption of the city. In this respect, the prostitute came to have symbolic significance as the embodiment of the violation of that divide. The double standard remained in force. The Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 allowed for a man to divorce his wife for adultery, but a woman could only divorce for adultery combined with other offences such as incest, cruelty, bigamy, desertion, etc., or based on cruelty alone.

The anonymity of the city led to a large increase in prostitution and unsanctioned sexual relationships. Dickens and other writers associated prostitution with the mechanisation and industrialisation of modern life, portraying prostitutes as human commodities consumed and thrown away like refuse when they were used up. Moral reform movements attempted to close down brothels, something that has sometimes been argued to have been a factor in the concentration of street-prostitution.

The extent of prostitution in London in the 1880s gained national and global prominence through the highly publicised murders attributed to Whitechapel-based serial killer Jack the Ripper, whose victims were exclusively prostitutes living destitute in the East End. Given that many prostitutes were living in poverty as late as the 1880s and 1890s, offering sex services was a source of desperate necessity to fund their meals and temporary lodging accommodation from the cold, and as a result prostitutes represented easy prey for criminals as they could do little to personally protect themselves from harm.

== Crime and police==

After 1815, there was widespread fear of growing crimes, burglaries, mob action, and threats of large-scale disorder. Crime had been handled on an ad-hoc basis by poorly organized local parish constables and private watchmen, supported by very stiff penalties, including hundreds of causes for execution or deportation to Australia. London, with 1.5 million people—more than the next 15 cities combined—over the decades had worked out informal arrangements to develop a uniform policing system in its many boroughs. The Metropolitan Police Act 1829, championed by Home Secretary Robert Peel, was not so much a startling innovation, as a systemization with expanded funding of established informal practices. It created the Metropolitan Police Service, headquartered at Scotland Yard. London now had the world&#x27;s first modern police force. The 3000 policemen were called &quot;bobbies&quot; (after Peel&#x27;s first name). They were well-organized, centrally directed, and wore standard blue uniforms. Legally they had the historic status of constable, with authority to make arrests of suspicious persons and book offenders before a magistrate court. They were assigned in teams to specified beats, especially at night. Gas lighting was installed on major streets, making their task of surveillance much easier. Crime rates went down. An 1835 law required all incorporated boroughs in England and Wales to establish police forces. Scotland, with its separate legal system, was soon added. By 1857 every jurisdiction in Great Britain had an organized police force, for which the Treasury paid a subsidy. The police had steady pay, were selected by merit rather than by political influence, and were rarely used for partisan purposes. The pay scale was not high (one guinea a week in 1833), but the prestige was especially high for Irish Catholics, who were disproportionately represented in every city where they had a large presence.

By the Victorian era, penal transportation to Australia was falling out of use since it did not reduce crime rates. The British penal system underwent a transition from harsh punishment to reform, education, and training for post-prison livelihoods. The reforms were controversial and contested. In 1877–1914 era a series of major legislative reforms enabled significant improvement in the penal system. In 1877, the previously localized prisons were nationalized in the Home Office under a Prison Commission. The Prison Act of 1898 enabled the Home Secretary to impose multiple reforms on his own initiative, without going through the politicized process of Parliament. The Probation of Offenders Act of 1907 introduced a new probation system that drastically cut down the prison population, while providing a mechanism for transition back to normal life. The Criminal Justice Administration Act of 1914 required courts to allow a reasonable time before imprisonment was ordered for people who did not pay their fines. Previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced solely for that reason. The Borstal system after 1908 was organized to reclaim young offenders, and the Children Act of 1908 prohibited imprisonment under age 14, and strictly limited that of ages 14 to 16. The principal reformer was Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise, the chair of the Prison Commission.

==Causation==

Intellectual historians searching for causes of the new morality often point to the ideas by Hannah More, William Wilberforce, and the Clapham Sect. Perkin argues this exaggerates the influence of a small group of individuals, who were &quot;as much an effect of the revolution as a cause.&quot; It also has a timing problem, for many predecessors had failed. The intellectual approach tends to minimize the importance of Nonconformists and Evangelicals—the Methodists, for example, played a powerful role among the upper tier of the working class. Finally, it misses a key ingredient: instead of trying to improve an old society, the reformers were trying to lead Britain into a new society of the future.

Victorian era movements for justice, freedom, and other strong moral values made greed, and exploitation into public evils. The writings of Charles Dickens, in particular, observed and recorded these conditions. 
Peter Shapely examined 100 charity leaders in Victorian Manchester. They brought significant cultural capital, such as wealth, education and social standing. Besides the actual reforms for the city they achieved for themselves a form of symbolic capital, a legitimate form of social domination and civic leadership. The utility of charity as a means of boosting one&#x27;s social leadership was socially determined and would take a person only so far.

The Marxist intellectual Walter Benjamin connected Victorian morality to the rise of the bourgeoisie. Benjamin alleged that the shopping culture of the petite bourgeoisie established the sitting room as the centre of personal and family life; as such, the English bourgeois culture is a &quot;sitting-room culture&quot; of prestige through conspicuous consumption. This acquisition of prestige is then reinforced by the repression of emotion and of sexual desire, and by the construction of a regulated social-space where propriety is the key personality trait desired in men and women.

<text>Abbassi Madani (; 28 February 1931 – 24 April 2019) was an Algerian politician who was the President of the Islamic Salvation Front. As its leader, he became the voice of a large part of the dispossessed Algerian youth.

==Career==

Madani was born in Diyar Ben Aissa, Sidi Okba, now in Biskra Province. In his youth he joined the National Liberation Front (FLN) and participated in the first day of the Algerian War of Independence, 1 November 1954, by planting a bomb at an Algiers radio facility, but was arrested by the French on 17 November 1954, and remained in jail until independence in 1962.
After studying for a doctorate in educational psychology in London from 1975 to 1978, he became a professor of educational sciences at the University of Algiers. Madani grew critical of the FLN&#x27;s socialist orientation, and in 1989, after the Algerian Constitution was changed to allow multiparty democracy, he co-founded the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which rapidly grew to enjoy success in the ensuing local elections. Madani contended that the Islamic essence of November 1954 was betrayed by the Charters of Tripoli and Algeria, along with other charters upheld by Houari Boumediene and Chadli Bendjedid.

==Political positions==
Madani advocated, on the one hand, the &quot;stepwise&quot; introduction of Sharia (Islamic Law) and called Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of the dominant religious movement in Saudi Arabia, the &quot;avant-garde of the reform-oriented Muslim world&quot;. On the other hand, he declared that his party had no intention to impose the wearing of the veil or to ban women from driving. He named the Muslim reformer Muhammad Abduh as part of the same &quot;avant-garde&quot; as Abd al-Wahab. In a 1990 interview he said he wanted to suppress &quot;usury&quot; in banking and to substantially reduce taxes, while he avoided answering a question about the financing of development projects.

In 1990, the Algerian Government pushed a new electoral law which was unanimously condemned by all Algerian opposition parties. Protesting against this law, Dr. Abbassi helped organize a general strike and massive peaceful demonstrations in Algiers. An attack by armed forces ended the protest. After the strike, Dr. Abbassi was arrested and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment following charges of threatening state security. The UN Human Rights Committee investigated the arrest made by the military court of Blida, during its 89th session in New York in 2007. The committee concluded that the trial and sentencing of Dr. Abbassi by the military court constituted a violation of article 14 of the Covenant.

==Retirement==
Politically, he was widely considered to represent the moderate wing of FIS, contrasted with Ali Belhadj&#x27;s more hardline views. His positions included free markets, early Islamic education, Arabization of education and government, segregation of the sexes, and sharia-based law. He expressed support for democracy, but with the reservation that it could not override Sharia law.

In January 2011, Agence France-Presse announced, in connection with ongoing demonstrations in Algeria, that Madani had fled to Qatar. Madani died on 24 April 2019.

<doc id="608032" wikidata="Q30944" url="?curid=608032" title="Streptopelia">
<text>Streptopelia (collared doves and turtle doves) is a genus of 15 species of birds in the pigeon and dove family Columbidae native to the Old World in Africa, Europe, and Asia. These are mainly slim, small to medium-sized species. The upperparts tend to be buffy brown and the underparts are often a shade of pinkish-brown, and they have a characteristic black-and-white patch on the neck. They have cooing or purring songs, monotonous in some, restful and soothing in others. The genus divides into two groups, the collared dove group (11 species) with uniform upperparts and a black half-collar edged with white, and the turtle dove group (4 species) with patterned upperparts and a barred side panel on the neck. They range in size from the 20–23 cm red collared dove to the 33–35 cm oriental turtle dove. Most of the species are resident or disperse over short distances, but two (the European and Oriental turtle doves) are long-distance migrants breeding in temperate areas and wintering in the tropics. The sexes are not differentiated in most of the species, except for the red collared dove, where the males are orange-red with a greyish head, and the females a duller brown.
As a group, this genus is highly successful; several species are abundant in a range of habitats in the tropics, with three species having a more extensive distribution into temperate areas as well. The Eurasian collared dove (&quot;Streptopelia decaocto&quot;) in particular has expanded naturally out of its original range of the warmer temperate regions from southeastern Europe to India to colonise the rest of Europe, reaching as far west as Great Britain by 1960 and Ireland soon after, and also east across northern China to Japan. It has also been introduced into the Americas where it has now colonised most of North America, Central America, and the Caribbean, and is still spreading rapidly. Some other species have been less successful in recent years, with two species listed by IUCN as Vulnerable.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Streptopelia&quot; was described in 1855 by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The name is from the Ancient Greek στρεπτός (&quot;streptós&quot;) – literal meaning &quot;twisted&quot; but, by extension, &quot;wearing a torc&quot; (i.e., twisted metal collar) – and πέλεια (&quot;péleia&quot;) meaning &quot;wild dove&quot;. Also in 1855, the English zoologist George Robert Gray designated the type species as &quot;Streptopelia risoria&quot;, the Barbary dove. Although &quot;Streptopelia risoria&quot; has been confirmed as a valid name by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, the Barbary dove is generally treated as a domesticated form of the African collared dove &quot;Streptopelia roseogrisea&quot;.

== Species ==
The genus contains 15 species:


The genera &quot;Spilopelia&quot; and &quot;Nesoenas&quot; were formerly included in &quot;Streptopelia&quot;, but have since been separated out to make the genus monophyletic.

<text>The Nikon D100 is a discontinued 6-megapixel digital single-lens reflex camera made by Nikon Corporation and designed as a consumer alternative to the professional D1 series cameras. It was the precursor of both the more advanced D70 and D200 cameras with the former continuing the consumer offerings and the latter beginning an advanced consumer and professional lineup. The D70 kept the controls which the D100 inherited from the F80 film camera, which has evolved into the current D7500 and D750 offerings, in cropped frame and full frame respectively. The D200 adopted the controls of the D1 series.

==History and Design==
It was introduced on February 21, 2002 at the Photo Marketing Association Annual Convention and Trade Show as a direct competitor to the Canon EOS D60. With a price of US$1,999 for the body only in the United States, it was the second 6-megapixel DSLR to break the $2000 barrier, after the EOS D60.

Although the name D100 suggested that it was a digital version of the Nikon F100, the camera design more closely resembles the Nikon F80 (also known as Nikon N80 in the United States), which is a much more consumer-oriented camera than the professional F100. The price of the camera dropped over time to $1699 in May 2003, and $1499 in December 2003. In the Spring of 2004 Nikon released the D70, which offered superior features to the D100 at a lower price of $999. However, Nikon continued to produce the D100 until 2005 when a more advanced and professional-oriented successor, the Nikon D200, was released.

<text>Willem Bilderdijk (; 7 September 1756 – 18 December 1831) was a Dutch poet, historian, lawyer, and linguist.

==Life==
Willem Bilderdijk was born on 7 September 1756 in Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic.

He was the son of an Amsterdam physician. When he was six years old an accident to his foot incapacitated him for ten years, and he developed habits of continuous and concentrated study. His parents were ardent partisans of the House of Orange-Nassau, and Bilderdijk grew up with strong monarchical and Calvinistic convictions.

After studying at Leiden University, Bilderdijk obtained his doctorate in law in 1782, and began to practise as an advocate at The Hague. Three years later he contracted an unhappy marriage with Rebecca Woesthoven. He refused in 1795 to take the oath to the administration of the new Batavian Republic, and was consequently obliged to leave the Netherlands. He went to Hamburg, and then to London, where his great learning procured him consideration.

There he had as a pupil (1776–1830), the daughter of the Dutch painter Heinrich Wilhelm Schweickhardt and herself a poet. When he left London in June 1797 for Braunschweig, this lady followed him, and after he had formally divorced his first wife (1802) they were married.

In 1806 he was persuaded by his friends to return to the Netherlands, where the Batavian Republic had been replaced by a monarchy, the first king being Louis Bonaparte, a brother of the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Louis Napoleon received Bilderdijk kindly and made him his librarian, and a member and eventually president (1809–1811) of the Royal Institute.

Bilderdijk also taught the king Dutch although on one occasion, the king supposedly told his people that he was the &quot;Konijn van &#x27;Olland&quot; (&quot;rabbit of &#x27;Olland&quot;), rather than &quot;Koning van Holland&quot; (&quot;King of Holland&quot;) because he had difficulty mastering Dutch pronunciation.
After the abdication of Louis, Bilderdijk suffered great poverty; on the accession of William I of the Netherlands in 1813, he hoped to be made a professor but was disappointed and became a history tutor at Leiden. He continued his vigorous campaign against liberal ideas to his death.

Bilderdijk was the founder of the spiritual movement &quot;Het Réveil&quot;, which tried to give a Christian answer to the ideals of the French Revolution. Among his disciples were Abraham Capadose, Willem de Clercq, Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer, and especially Isaac da Costa, who called his teacher &quot;anti-revolutionary, anti-Barneveldtian, anti-Loevesteinish, anti-liberal&quot;.

Bilderdijk died in Haarlem in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands on 18 December 1831.

==Legacy==
According to Godfried Bomans, who named a club after his pseudonym &quot;Teisterbant&quot;, the bed Bilderdijk died in was kept until 1950 as a curiosity for people to look at. A commemorative gable stone was placed on the top gable of his old house in 1885, and a commemorative stone is also in the St. Bavochurch.

The collection of the Bilderdijk Museum is available at Leiden University Library.

<text>Sir Arthur George Tansley FLS, FRS (15 August 1871 – 25 November 1955) was an English botanist and a pioneer in the science of ecology.

Educated at Highgate School, University College London and Trinity College, Cambridge, Tansley taught at these universities and at Oxford, where he served as Sherardian Professor of Botany until his retirement in 1937. Tansley founded the &quot;New Phytologist&quot; in 1902 and served as its editor until 1931. He was a pioneer of the science of ecology in Britain, being heavily influenced by the work of Danish botanist Eugenius Warming, and introduced the concept of the ecosystem into biology. Tansley was a founding member of the first professional society of ecologists, the Central Committee for the Survey and Study of British Vegetation, which later organised the British Ecological Society, and served as its first president and founding editor of the &quot;Journal of Ecology&quot;. Tansley also served as the first chairman of the British Nature Conservancy.

Tansley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1915, and knighted in 1950.

The &quot;New Phytologist&quot; publishes regular Tansley Reviews, while the New Phytologist Trust awards a Tansley Medal, both named in his honour.

==Early life and education==
Tansley was born in London to businessman George Tansley and his wife Amelia. Although a successful businessman, George Tansley&#x27;s passion had been education after he started attending classes at the Working Men&#x27;s College when he was 19. George Tansley later went on to be a volunteer teacher, retiring from his business in 1884 to dedicate himself to teaching at the college. He married Amelia Lawrence in 1863 and had two children – the older a daughter, Maud, followed by Arthur seven years later, in 1871.

Tansley&#x27;s interest in science was sparked by one of his father&#x27;s fellow volunteer-teachers, who was described as &quot;an excellent and enthusiastic field botanist&quot;. After attending preparatory school from the ages of 12 to 15, he enrolled in Highgate School. Unhappy with the science teaching, which he considered &quot;farcically inadequate&quot;, he switched to University College London in 1889 and studied at the faculty of Biological science, where he was heavily influenced by Ray Lankester and F. W. Oliver. In 1890 Tansley attended Trinity College, Cambridge. After completing Part I of Tripos in 1893, he returned to University College London as an assistant to Oliver, a position he retained until 1907. In 1894 he returned to Cambridge and completed Part II of Tripos, and received a degree with first class honours.

==Professional career==
Tansley taught and conducted research at University College London from 1893 until 1907. In 1907 he took a Lecturer position at the University of Cambridge. During the First World War, with very little teaching going on at the university, Tansley took a position as a clerk with the Ministry of Munitions. In 1923 he resigned his position at Cambridge and spent a year in Vienna studying psychology under Sigmund Freud. When he returned to Britain in 1924 Tansley was appointed acting chairman of the British Empire Vegetation Committee. After four years away from a formal academic position in botany, Tansley was appointed Sherardian Professor of Botany at the University of Oxford in 1927, where he remained until his retirement in 1937.

==Major contributions==
Tansley&#x27;s early publications focused on palaeobotany, especially fern evolution. Tansley founded the botany journal &quot;New Phytologist&quot; in 1902 to serve as &quot;a medium of easy communication and discussion between British botanists on all matters . . . including methods of teaching and research&quot;. It was named after &quot;The Phytologist&quot;, a botanical magazine published between 1842 and 1863. In establishing this journal, Tansley&#x27;s aim was to provide a venue for the publication of &quot;notes and suggestions&quot;; existing botanical journals only published records of completed research. He remained editor of the journal until 1931.

Tansley&#x27;s introduction to ecology came in 1898 when he read Warming&#x27;s &quot;Plantesamfund&quot; (in its German translation, &quot;Lehrbuch der ökologischen Pflanzengeographie&quot;). Reading the book provoked him to &quot;[go] out into the field to see how far one could match the plant communities Warming had described for Denmark in the English countryside&quot;. In 1903 he learned of the work done by the Smith brothers in mapping the vegetation of Scotland and Yorkshire. The work was initiated by Robert Smith and continued by his brother, William Gardner Smith (in conjunction with Charles Edward Moss) after Robert&#x27;s death. In 1904 Tansley suggested the formation of a central body for the systematic survey and mapping of the British Isles. This led to the establishment of the Central Committee for the Survey and Study of British Vegetation by Tansley, Moss, William Smith and T. W. Woodhead, with the support of Marcel Hardy, F. J. Lewis, Lloyd Praeger and W. M. Rankin. These eight formed the original committee, with Tansley as its leader. F. W. Oliver later joined the group as its ninth member. The name of the group was later shortened to the British Vegetation Committee. The aim of the group was to coordinate ongoing studies and standardise the methodology being used. The committee met twice more in 1905 and produced a six-page pamphlet, &quot;Suggestions for Beginning Survey Work on Vegetation&quot;.

In 1911 Tansley, in conjunction with the British Vegetation Committee, organised the first International Phytogeographic Excursion (IPE). He was inspired by a plant geography tour of Switzerland organised by Swiss botanist Carl Schröter in 1908, which introduced him not only to vegetation types, but also to botanists from other countries. The connections made between Tansley and American ecologists Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements helped build a philosophical and methodological link between British and American plant ecology. Other attendees included Schröter, Swedish botanist Carl Lindman, and German botanists Oscar Drude and Paul Graebner. Tansley&#x27;s book &quot;Types of British Vegetation&quot; was prepared with an eye to serving as a guide to the vegetation for the attendees of the first IPE. The second IPE in 1913 was hosted by Cowles. This brought Tansley to America.

In 1913, the British Vegetation Committee organised the British Ecological Society (BES), the first-ever professional society of ecologists. Tansley served as its first president, and was first editor of the &quot;Journal of Ecology&quot;, a position he held for 21 years. In 1915 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1923 he was elected president of the Botanical Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. At the Imperial Botanical Congress in 1924 he was appointed chairman of the British Empire Vegetation Committee. He served as president of the BES a second time in 1938.

William S. Cooper considered Tansley&#x27;s most influential publications synthesised individual studies into a whole. In 1935 Tansley published &quot;The use and abuse of vegetational terms and concepts&quot; in which he introduced the ecosystem concept. In the 1930s ecological thinking was dominated by the work of Clements, who thought of ecological communities as organisms, and associations as superorganisms. Tansley questioned the concept by proposing the idea that ecological communities could be regarded as quasi-organisms and he devised it to draw attention to the importance of transfers of materials between organisms and their environment, regarding ecosystems as the basic units of nature.
Tansley&#x27;s interest in teaching led to the production of the &quot;Elements of Plant Ecology&quot; in 1922, which was followed by &quot;Practical Plant Ecology&quot; in 1923 and &quot;Aims and methods in the study of vegetation&quot; in 1926, coauthored with Thomas Ford Chipp. The last book, edited for the British Empire Vegetation Committee, was extremely influential not just in defining ecological methods but in highlighting the need for a complete inventory of the empire&#x27;s &quot;vegetational assets&quot;. With this information, it would be possible to efficiently manage the vast natural resources of the empire. Tansley&#x27;s most comprehensive work, &quot;The British Islands and Their Vegetation&quot; was published in 1939. Volume 2 was published in 1949. In recognition of this achievement, he was awarded the Linnean Medal in 1941.

During the Second World War Tansley became committed to conservation, and this continued through post-war reconstruction. He chaired a committee of the BES that formulated a policy on nature reserves and led to the formation of the Nature Conservancy, which he also chaired. Tansley&#x27;s conservation work was the basis cited for his knighthood in 1950.

Tansley was introduced to psychology by a former student, Bernard Hart, who worked as a doctor in mental hospitals near London. While working for the Ministry of Munitions during the First World War, he had a dream which was described as &quot;one of the major turning points in his life&quot; – from this dream came Tansley&#x27;s interest in Freud and psychoanalysis. In 1920 he published &quot;The New Psychology and its Relation to Life&quot;, one of the first books that attempted to introduce the ideas of Freud and Carl Jung to a general audience. The book was a bestseller, selling 10,000 copies in the United Kingdom and 4,000 in the United States. In 1922 Tansley spent three months with Freud, and the following year he moved his family to Vienna for a year. Although he later returned to botanical pursuits, Tansley remained in contact with Freud and wrote his obituary. Research by Peder Anker has suggested a close theoretical relationship between Tansley&#x27;s ecology and his psychology.

==Personal life==

In 1903 Tansley married Edith Chick, a former student with whom he coauthored two papers. They had three daughters–Katharine, Margaret Tomlinson and Helen. Lady Edith Tansley died in 1970, at age 100.

Tansley was an atheist.
