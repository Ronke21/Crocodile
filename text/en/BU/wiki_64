<doc id="601598" wikidata="Q157165" url="?curid=601598" title="Creditor">
<text>A creditor or lender is a party (e.g., person, organization, company, or government) that has a claim on the services of a second party. It is a person or institution to whom money is owed. The first party, in general, has provided some property or service to the second party under the assumption (usually enforced by contract) that the second party will return an equivalent property and service. The second party is frequently called a debtor or borrower. The first party is called the creditor, which is the lender of property, service, or money.

Creditors can be broadly divided into two categories: secured and unsecured.
*A secured creditor has a security or charge over some or all of the debtor&#x27;s assets, to provide reassurance (thus to &quot;secure&quot; him) of ultimate repayment of the debt owed to him. This could be by way of, for example, a mortgage, where the property represents the security.
*An unsecured creditor does not have a charge over the debtor&#x27;s assets.

The term creditor is frequently used in the financial world, especially in reference to short-term loans, long-term bonds, and mortgage loans. In law, a person who has a money judgment entered in their favor by a court is called a &quot;judgment creditor&quot;.

The term creditor derives from the notion of credit. Also, in modern America, credit refers to a rating which indicates the likelihood a borrower will pay back their loan. In earlier times, credit also referred to reputation or trustworthiness.

== Accounting classification ==
In accounting presentation, creditors are to be broken down into &#x27;amounts falling due within one year&#x27; or &#x27;amounts falling due after more than one year&#x27;...

The financial statements presentation is this:

*Long-term liabilities
**&#x27;Long-term creditors&#x27;
*Current liabilities
**&#x27;Current creditors&#x27;

==Rights==

Creditors&#x27; rights are the procedural provisions designed to protect the ability of creditors—persons who are owed money—to collect the money that they are owed. These provisions vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may include the ability of a creditor to put a lien on a debtor&#x27;s property, to effect a seizure and forced sale of the debtor&#x27;s property, to effect a garnishment of the debtor&#x27;s wages, and to have certain purchases or gifts made by the debtor set aside as fraudulent conveyances. The rights of a particular creditor usually depend in part on the reason for which the debt is owed, and the terms of any writing memorializing the debt.

===Priority of creditors===
Creditors&#x27; rights deal not only with the rights of creditors against the debtor, but also with the rights of creditors against one another. Where multiple creditors claim a right to levy against a particular piece of property, or against the debtor&#x27;s accounts in general, the rules governing creditors&#x27; rights determine which creditor has the strongest right to any particular relief.

Generally, creditors can be divided between those who &quot;perfected&quot; their interest by establishing an appropriate public record of the debt and any property claimed as collateral for it, and those who have not. Creditors may also be classed according to whether they are &quot;in possession&quot; of the collateral, and by whether the debt was created as a purchase money security interest. A creditor may generally ask a court to set aside a fraudulent conveyance designed to move the debtor&#x27;s property or funds out of their reach.

===Specialized legal practices===
Some lawyers have a specialized practice area focused on the collection of such debts. Such attorneys are frequently referred to as collection attorneys or collection lawyers.

Attorneys who practice in the area of creditor&#x27;s rights perform one or all of the following:

*File lawsuits and using other legal collection techniques to collect consumer debts (i.e., debts owed by individuals)
*File lawsuits and using other legal collection techniques to collect commercial debts (i.e. debts owed by businesses)
*Represent creditor&#x27;s interests in a bankruptcy proceeding
*Foreclose on homes or commercial real estate if the purchaser defaults on payment
*Recover (or replevin) secured goods (e.g., automobiles) if the purchaser defaults on payment

==Creditors&#x27; powers during insolvency==
In the UK, once an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) has been applied for, and is in place through the courts, creditors are prevented from making direct contact under the terms of the IVA. All ongoing correspondence of an IVA must first go through the appointed Insolvency Practitioner. The creditors will begin to deal with the Insolvency Practitioner and readily accept annual reports when submitted.

Under the Companies Act 2006, a company&#x27;s creditors may apply to the court for an order summoning a meeting of the creditors or some of the creditors who fall into a specific category, in order to consider a compromise or &quot;arrangement&quot; between the company and its creditors. If a majority representing 75% in value of the creditors or class of creditors present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting agree a compromise, the meeting may apply to the court for the compromise to be enforced. The same provision would apply to members (shareholders) of a company seeking to make an arrangement with the company. The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 makes similar provision where a compromise has been proposed between creditors or members and a company that &quot;has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties&quot;.

==History==
Ogasa District was created on April 1, 1896 through the merger of former and . At the time it was divided into one town (Kakegawa) and 45 villages. Osuka Village was renamed Yokosuka and was elevated to town status on May 1, 1914, and Nishikata Village became Horinouchi Town on January 1, 1922. Ikeshinden was raised to town status on November 1, 1940. Following some consolidation in 1942–1943, the district had four towns and 35 villages.

In 1950–1951, Kakegawa expanded by annexing four neighboring villages, and the town of Kikugawa was created on January 1, 1954 by the merger of Horinouchi Town with three neighboring villages. Kakegawa was raised to city status on March 1, 1954. In a round of mergers and consolidation from 1954 to 1957, the towns of Ogasa (March 31, 1954), Hamaoka (March 31, 1955), and Ōsuka (June 1, 1956) were created and the number of villages reduced from 27 to 2. Mikasa Village was annexed by Kakegawa on October 1, 1960 and Kito Village by Ohama Town on April 1, 1973 to form the town of Daitō.

===Recent mergers===

The village of Inui was elevated to town status on November 15, 1928. On September 1, 1948, the village of Kudonishi was transferred to the town of Fukuroi in Iwata District, as were Mizukubo and village of Shironishi on July 1, 1951. In another round of consolidation from 1955 to 1956, the town of Haruno wa created by the merger of Inui with the villages of Kumakiri and Keta, and the remaining villages were consolidated with Mori or Yamanashi. Yamanashi was merged into Fukuroi on January 1, 1963 and Haruno with Hamamatsu on July 1, 2005.</text><links>

==Festivals==

===Misakubo Matsuri (水窪まつり)===

The most famous festival is the aptly named &quot;Misakubo Matsuri&quot; (Misakubo Festival) which takes place in mid-September. For more than a month prior to the two-day event the local people gather in area-groups and build a float, make costumes and practice skits. During the day of the festival the floats and performers travel round the town performing for the leaders of each area and the best performances are rewarded. The evenings are a traditional Yatai festival where wooden carved floats are pulled around the town by the revelers.

===Kuni-Tori Tsunahiki (くにとり綱引き)===
This is yearly tug-of-war competition between Misakubo, representing Shizuoka Prefecture and Nagano Prefecture.
The winning team moves the border of the prefecture by 1 meter, expanding the winning prefecture. In 2006 Misakubo won but is currently 3 meters in the red.

<text>was a town located in Hamana District, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.

As of March 31, 2010, the town had an estimated population of 16,975 and a population density of 910 persons per km2. The total area was 18.65 km2.

On March 23, 2010, Arai was merged into the expanded city of Kosai and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality. Hamana District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

==Geography==
Arai was located at the southwest end of Shizuoka Prefecture, with part of Lake Hamana located within the town boundaries. The town was on the Enshu Sea of the Pacific Ocean, with a temperate maritime climate with hot, humid summers and mild, cool winters.

==History==
Arai was located in former Tōtōmi Province, and was largely &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate in the Edo period, when it was called Arai-juku, and prospered as a post town on the Tōkaidō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. During the cadastral reform of the early Meiji period in 1889, the area was reorganized into Arai Town within Fuchi District, Shizuoka Prefecture. Fuchi District was merged into Hamana District in 1896.

==Economy==
The economy of Arai was largely based on commercial fishing, edible seaweed cultivation, and fireworks production.

<doc id="601621" wikidata="Q1344782" url="?curid=601621" title="Hubbert peak theory">
<text>The Hubbert peak theory says that for any given geographical area, from an individual oil-producing region to the planet as a whole, the rate of petroleum production tends to follow a bell-shaped curve. It is one of the primary theories on peak oil.

Choosing a particular curve determines a point of maximum production based on discovery rates, production rates, and cumulative production. Early in the curve (pre-peak), the production rate increases due to the discovery rate and the addition of infrastructure. Late in the curve (post-peak), production declines because of resource depletion.

The Hubbert peak theory is based on the observation that the amount of oil under the ground in any region is finite; therefore, the rate of discovery, which initially increases quickly, must reach a maximum and then decline. In the US, oil extraction followed the discovery curve after a time lag of 32 to 35 years. The theory is named after American geophysicist M. King Hubbert, who created a method of modeling the production curve given an assumed ultimate recovery volume.

==Hubbert&#x27;s peak==
&quot;Hubbert&#x27;s peak&quot; can refer to the peaking of production in a particular area, which has now been observed for many fields and regions.

Hubbert&#x27;s peak was thought to have been achieved in the United States contiguous 48 states (that is, excluding Alaska and Hawaii) in the early 1970s. Oil production peaked at per day in 1970 and then declined over the subsequent 35 years in a pattern that closely followed the one predicted by Hubbert in the mid-1950s. However, beginning in the late 20th century, advances in extraction technology, particularly those that led to the extraction of tight oil and unconventional oil resulted in a large increase in U.S. oil production. Thus, establishing a pattern that deviated drastically from the model predicted by Hubbert for the contiguous 48-states as a whole. Production from Wells utilizing these advances extraction techniques, exhibit a rate of decline far greater than traditional means. In November 2017 the United States once again surpassed the 10 million barrel mark for the first time since 1970. 

Peak oil as a proper noun, or &quot;Hubbert&#x27;s peak&quot; applied more generally, refers to a predicted event: the peak of the entire planet&#x27;s oil production. After peak oil, according to the Hubbert Peak Theory, the rate of oil production on Earth would enter a terminal decline. Based on his theory, in a paper he presented to the American Petroleum Institute in 1956, Hubbert correctly predicted that production of oil from conventional sources would peak in the continental United States around 1965–1970. Hubbert further predicted a worldwide peak at &quot;about half a century&quot; from publication and approximately 12 gigabarrels (GB) a year in magnitude. In a 1976 TV interview Hubbert added that the actions of OPEC might flatten the global production curve but this would only delay the peak for perhaps 10 years. The development of new technologies has provided access to large quantities of unconventional resources, and the boost in production has largely discounted Hubbert&#x27;s prediction.

==Hubbert&#x27;s theory==

===Hubbert curve===
In 1956, Hubbert proposed that fossil fuel production in a given region over time would follow a roughly bell-shaped curve without giving a precise formula; he later used the Hubbert curve, the derivative of the logistic curve, for estimating future production using past observed discoveries.

Hubbert assumed that after fossil fuel reserves (oil reserves, coal reserves, and natural gas reserves) are discovered, production at first increases approximately exponentially, as more extraction commences and more efficient facilities are installed. At some point, a peak output is reached, and production begins declining until it approximates an exponential decline.

The Hubbert curve satisfies these constraints. Furthermore, it is symmetrical, with the peak of production reached when half of the fossil fuel that will ultimately be produced has been produced. It also has a single peak.

Given past oil discovery and production data, a Hubbert curve that attempts to approximate past discovery data may be constructed and used to provide estimates for future production. In particular, the date of peak oil production or the total amount of oil ultimately produced can be estimated that way. Cavallo defines the Hubbert curve used to predict the U.S. peak as the derivative of:

:formula_1

where formula_2max is the total resource available (ultimate recovery of crude oil), formula_3 the cumulative production, and formula_4 and formula_5 are constants. The year of maximum annual production (peak) is:

:formula_6

so now the cumulative production formula_3 reaches the half of the total available resource:

:formula_8

The Hubbert equation assumes that oil production is symmetrical about the peak. Others have used similar but non-symmetrical equations which may provide better a fit to empirical production data.

===Use of multiple curves===

The sum of multiple Hubbert curves, a technique not developed by Hubbert himself, may be used in order to model more complicated real life scenarios. When new production methods, namely hydraulic fracturing, were pioneered on the previously unproductive oil-bearing Shale formations, the sudden, dramatic increase in production necessitated a distinct curve. Advances in technologies such as these are limited, but when a paradigm shifting idea impacts production and causes a need for a new curve to be added to the old curve, or the entire curve to be reworked. It should be noted, &amp; it is well documented, that production from shale wells are unlike that of traditional well. A traditional oil well&#x27;s rate of decline is shallow, &amp; exhibits a slow, predictable rate of decline as the reservoir is drawn down (Drinking of Milkshake). Whereas production from shale wells, assuming successful fracturing, will see its peak production at the moment the well is brought in, with a drastic rate of decline shortly thereafter. However, one revolutionary aspect of these types of production methods are the ability to refracture the well. Production may be brought back up, to near peak levels with a reapplication of the fracturing technology to the subject formation. Once again releasing the hydrocarbons trapped tightly within the shale &amp; allowing them to be drawn to the surface. This process allows the for an outward manipulation of the curve, simply by purposefully neglecting to rework the well until the operator&#x27;s desired market conditions are present. 

===Reliability===

====Crude oil====

Hubbert, in his 1956 paper, presented two scenarios for US crude oil production:
* most likely estimate: a logistic curve with a logistic growth rate equal to 6%, an ultimate resource equal to 150 Giga-barrels (Gb) and a peak in 1965. The size of the ultimate resource was taken from a synthesis of estimates by well-known oil geologists and the US Geological Survey, which Hubbert judged to be the most likely case.
* upper-bound estimate: a logistic curve with a logistic growth rate equal to 6% and ultimate resource equal to 200 Giga-barrels and a peak in 1970.
Hubbert&#x27;s upper-bound estimate, which he regarded as optimistic, accurately predicted that US oil production would peak in 1970, although the actual peak was 17% higher than Hubbert&#x27;s curve. Production declined, as Hubbert had predicted, and stayed within 10 percent of Hubbert&#x27;s predicted value from 1974 through 1994; since then, actual production has been significantly greater than the Hubbert curve. The development of new technologies has provided access to large quantities of unconventional resources, and the boost of production has largely discounted Hubbert&#x27;s prediction.

Hubbert&#x27;s 1956 production curves depended on geological estimates of ultimate recoverable oil resources, but he was dissatisfied by the uncertainty this introduced, given the various estimates ranging from 110 billion to 590 billion barrels for the US. Starting in his 1962 publication, he made his calculations, including that of ultimate recovery, based only on mathematical analysis of production rates, proved reserves, and new discoveries, independent of any geological estimates of future discoveries. He concluded that the ultimate recoverable oil resource of the contiguous 48 states was 170 billion barrels, with a production peak in 1966 or 1967. He considered that because his model incorporated past technical advances, that any future advances would occur at the same rate, and were also incorporated. Hubbert continued to defend his calculation of 170 billion barrels in his publications of 1965 and 1967, although by 1967 he had moved the peak forward slightly, to 1968 or 1969.

A post-hoc analysis of peaked oil wells, fields, regions and nations found that Hubbert&#x27;s model was the &quot;most widely useful&quot; (providing the best fit to the data), though many areas studied had a sharper &quot;peak&quot; than predicted.

A 2007 study of oil depletion by the UK Energy Research Centre pointed out that there is no theoretical and no robust practical reason to assume that oil production will follow a logistic curve. Neither is there any reason to assume that the peak will occur when half the ultimate recoverable resource has been produced; and in fact, empirical evidence appears to contradict this idea. An analysis of a 55 post-peak countries found that the average peak was at 25 percent of the ultimate recovery.

====Natural gas====

Hubbert also predicted that natural gas production would follow a logistic curve similar to that of oil. The graph shows actual gas production in blue compared to his predicted gas production for the United States in red, published in 1962.

==Economics==
===Energy return on energy investment===
The ratio of energy extracted to the energy expended in the process is often referred to as the Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI or EROEI). Should the EROEI drops to one, or equivalently the Net energy gain falls to zero, the oil production is no longer a net energy source.

There is a difference between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source. Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using natural gas to fuel enhanced oil recovery. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most Athabasca tar sands plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to ethanol fuel produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.

The assumption of inevitable declining volumes of oil and gas produced per unit of effort is contrary to recent experience in the US. In the United States, as of 2017, there has been an ongoing decade-long increase in the productivity of oil and gas drilling in all the major tight oil and gas plays. The US Energy Information Administration reports, for instance, that in the Bakken Shale production area of North Dakota, the volume of oil produced per day of drilling rig time in January 2017 was 4 times the oil volume per day of drilling five years previous, in January 2012, and nearly 10 times the oil volume per day of ten years previous, in January 2007. In the Marcellus gas region of the northeast, The volume of gas produced per day of drilling time in January 2017 was 3 times the gas volume per day of drilling five years previous, in January 2012, and 28 times the gas volume per day of drilling ten years previous, in January 2007.

===Growth-based economic models===

Insofar as economic growth is driven by oil consumption growth, post-peak societies must adapt. Hubbert believed:

Some economists describe the problem as uneconomic growth or a false economy. At the political right, Fred Ikle has warned about &quot;conservatives addicted to the Utopia of Perpetual Growth&quot;. Brief oil interruptions in 1973 and 1979 markedly slowed—but did not stop—the growth of world GDP.

Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation.

David Pimentel, professor of ecology and agriculture at Cornell University, and Mario Giampietro, senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), in their 2003 study &quot;Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy&quot;, placed the maximum U.S. population for a sustainable economy at 200 million (actual population approx. 290m in 2003, 329m in 2019). To achieve a sustainable economy world population will have to be reduced by two-thirds, says the study. Without population reduction, this study predicts an agricultural crisis beginning in 2020, becoming critical c. 2050. The peaking of global oil along with the decline in regional natural gas production may precipitate this agricultural crisis sooner than generally expected. Dale Allen Pfeiffer claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level such as never experienced before.

==Hubbert peaks==

Although Hubbert&#x27;s peak theory receives the most attention concerning peak oil production, it has also been applied to other natural resources.

===Natural gas===

Doug Reynolds predicted in 2005 that the North American peak would occur in 2007. Bentley predicted a world &quot;decline in conventional gas production from about 2020&quot;.

===Coal===

Although observers believe that peak coal is significantly further out than peak oil, Hubbert studied the specific example of anthracite in the US, a high-grade coal, whose production peaked in the 1920s. Hubbert found that anthracite matches a curve closely. Hubbert had recoverable coal reserves worldwide at 2.500 × 1012 metric tons and peaking around 2150 (depending on usage).

More recent estimates suggest an earlier peak. &quot;Coal: Resources and Future Production&quot; (PDF 630KB), published on April 5, 2007 by the Energy Watch Group (EWG), which reports to the German Parliament, found that global coal production could peak in as few as 15 years. Reporting on this, Richard Heinberg also notes that the date of peak annual energetic extraction from coal is likely to come earlier than the date of peak in quantity of coal (tons per year) extracted as the most energy-dense types of coal have been mined most extensively. A second study,
&quot;The Future of Coal&quot; by B. Kavalov and S. D. Peteves of the Institute for Energy (IFE), prepared for the European Commission Joint Research Centre, reaches similar conclusions and states that &quot;coal might not be so abundant, widely available and reliable as an energy source in the future&quot;.

Work by David Rutledge of Caltech predicts that the total world coal production will amount to only about 450 gigatonnes. This implies that coal is running out faster than usually assumed.

===Fissionable materials===

In a paper in 1956, after a review of US fissionable reserves, Hubbert notes of nuclear power:

As of 2015, the identified resources of uranium are sufficient to provide more than 135 years of supply at the present rate of consumption. Technologies such as the thorium fuel cycle, reprocessing and fast breeders can, in theory, extend the life of uranium reserves from hundreds to thousands of years.

Caltech physics professor David Goodstein stated in 2004 that

===Helium===

Almost all helium on Earth is a result of radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. Helium is extracted by fractional distillation from natural gas, which contains up to 7% helium. The world&#x27;s largest helium-rich natural gas fields are found in the United States, especially in the Hugoton and nearby gas fields in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The extracted helium is stored underground in the National Helium Reserve near Amarillo, Texas, the self-proclaimed &quot;Helium Capital of the World&quot;. Helium production is expected to decline along with natural gas production in these areas.

Helium, which is the second-lightest chemical element, will rise to the upper layers of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, where it can forever break free from Earth&#x27;s gravitational attraction. Approximately 1,600 tons of helium are lost per year as a result of atmospheric escape mechanisms.

===Transition metals===

Hubbert applied his theory to &quot;rock containing an abnormally high concentration of a given metal&quot; and reasoned that the peak production for metals such as copper, tin, lead, zinc and others would occur in the time frame of decades and iron in the time frame of two centuries like coal. The price of copper rose 500% between 2003 and 2007 and was attributed by some to peak copper. Copper prices later fell, along with many other commodities and stock prices, as demand shrank from fear of a global recession. Lithium availability is a concern for a fleet of Li-ion battery using cars but a paper published in 1996 estimated that world reserves are adequate for at least 50 years. A similar prediction for platinum use in fuel cells notes that the metal could be easily recycled.

===Precious metals===

In 2009, Aaron Regent president of the Canadian gold giant Barrick Gold said that global output has been falling by roughly one million ounces a year since the start of the decade. The total global mine supply has dropped by 10 percent as ore quality erodes, implying that the roaring bull market of the last eight years may have further to run. &quot;There is a strong case to be made that we are already at &#x27;peak gold&#x27;,&quot; he told The Daily Telegraph at the RBC&#x27;s annual gold conference in London. &quot;Production peaked around 2000 and it has been in decline ever since, and we forecast that decline to continue. It is increasingly difficult to find ore,&quot; he said.

Ore grades have fallen from around 12 grams per tonne in 1950 to nearer 3 grams in the US, Canada, and Australia. South Africa&#x27;s output has halved since peaking in 1970. Output fell a further 14 percent in South Africa in 2008 as companies were forced to dig ever deeper – at greater cost – to replace depleted reserves.

World mined gold production has peaked four times since 1900: in 1912, 1940, 1971, and 2001, each peak being higher than previous peaks. The latest peak was in 2001 when production reached 2,600 metric tons, then declined for several years. Production started to increase again in 2009, spurred by high gold prices, and achieved record new highs each year in 2012, 2013, and 2014, when production reached 2,990 tonnes.

===Phosphorus===

Phosphorus supplies are essential to farming and depletion of reserves is estimated at somewhere from 60 to 130 years. According to a 2008 study, the total reserves of phosphorus are estimated to be approximately 3,200 MT, with peak production at 28 MT/year in 2034. Individual countries&#x27; supplies vary widely; without a recycling initiative America&#x27;s supply is estimated around 30 years. Phosphorus supplies affect agricultural output which in turn limits alternative fuels such as biodiesel and ethanol. Its increasing price and scarcity (the global price of rock phosphate rose 8-fold in the 2 years to mid-2008) could change global agricultural patterns. Lands, perceived as marginal because of remoteness, but with very high phosphorus content, such as the Gran Chaco may get more agricultural development, while other farming areas, where nutrients are a constraint, may drop below the line of profitability.

===Renewable resources===

===Wood===
Unlike fossil resources, forests keep growing, thus the Hubbert peak theory does not apply. There had been wood shortages in the past, called Holznot in German-speaking regions, but no global peak wood yet, despite the early 2021 &quot;Lumber Crisis&quot;. Besides, deforestation may cause other problems, like erosion and drought by ending forests&#x27; Biotic pump effect.

===Water===

Hubbert&#x27;s original analysis did not apply to renewable resources. However, over-exploitation often results in a Hubbert peak nonetheless. A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.

For example, a reserve such as the Ogallala Aquifer can be mined at a rate that far exceeds replenishment. This turns much of the world&#x27;s underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil. These debates usually center around agriculture and suburban water usage but generation of electricity from nuclear energy or coal and tar sands mining mentioned above is also water resource intensive. The term fossil water is sometimes used to describe aquifers whose water is not being recharged.

===Fishing===

At least one researcher has attempted to perform Hubbert linearization (Hubbert curve) on the whaling industry, as well as charting the transparently dependent price of caviar on sturgeon depletion. The Atlantic northwest cod fishery was a renewable resource, but the numbers of fish taken exceeded the fish&#x27;s rate of recovery. The end of the cod fishery does match the exponential drop of the Hubbert bell curve. Another example is the cod of the North Sea.

===Air/oxygen===
Half the world&#x27;s oxygen is produced by phytoplankton. The plankton was once thought to have dropped by 40% since the 1950s. However, the authors reanalyzed their data with better calibrations and found plankton abundance dropped globally by only a few percent over this time interval (Boyce et al. 2014)

==Criticisms of peak oil ==
Economist Michael Lynch argues that the theory behind the Hubbert curve is simplistic and relies on an overly Malthusian point of view. Lynch claims that Campbell&#x27;s predictions for world oil production are strongly biased towards underestimates, and that Campbell has repeatedly pushed back the date.

Leonardo Maugeri, vice president of the Italian energy company Eni, argues that nearly all of peak estimates do not take into account unconventional oil even though the availability of these resources is significant and the costs of extraction and processing, while still very high, are falling because of improved technology. He also notes that the recovery rate from existing world oil fields has increased from about 22% in 1980 to 35% today because of new technology and predicts this trend will continue. The ratio between proven oil reserves and current production has constantly improved, passing from 20 years in 1948 to 35 years in 1972 and reaching about 40 years in 2003. These improvements occurred even with low investment in new exploration and upgrading technology because of the low oil prices during the last 20 years. However, Maugeri feels that encouraging more exploration will require relatively high oil prices.

Edward Luttwak, an economist and historian, claims that unrest in countries such as Russia, Iran and Iraq has led to a massive underestimate of oil reserves. The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas (ASPO) responds by claiming neither Russia nor Iran are troubled by unrest currently, but Iraq is.

Cambridge Energy Research Associates authored a report that is critical of Hubbert-influenced predictions:

CERA does not believe there will be an endless abundance of oil, but instead believes that global production will eventually follow an &quot;undulating plateau&quot; for one or more decades before declining slowly, and that production will reach 40 Mb/d by 2015.

Alfred J. Cavallo, while predicting a conventional oil supply shortage by no later than 2015, does not think Hubbert&#x27;s peak is the correct theory to apply to world production.

==Criticisms of peak element scenarios==
Although M. King Hubbert himself made major distinctions between decline in petroleum production versus depletion (or relative lack of it) for elements such as fissionable uranium and thorium, some others have predicted peaks like peak uranium and peak phosphorus soon on the basis of published reserve figures compared to present and future production. According to some economists, though, the amount of proved reserves inventoried at a time may be considered &quot;a poor indicator of the total future supply of a mineral resource.&quot;

As some illustrations, tin, copper, iron, lead, and zinc all had both production from 1950 to 2000 and reserves in 2000 much exceed world reserves in 1950, which would be impossible except for how &quot;proved reserves are like an inventory of cars to an auto dealer&quot; at a time, having little relationship to the actual total affordable to extract in the future. In the example of peak phosphorus, additional concentrations exist intermediate between 71,000 Mt of identified reserves (USGS) and the approximately 30,000,000,000 Mt of other phosphorus in Earth&#x27;s crust, with the average rock being 0.1% phosphorus, so showing decline in human phosphorus production will occur soon would require far more than comparing the former figure to the 190 Mt/year of phosphorus extracted in mines (2011 figure).

<text>Jacques Arcadelt (also Jacob Arcadelt; 10 August 150714 October 1568) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance, active in both Italy and France, and principally known as a composer of secular vocal music. Although he also wrote sacred vocal music, he was one of the most famous of the early composers of madrigals; his first book of madrigals, published within a decade of the appearance of the earliest examples of the form, was the most widely printed collection of madrigals of the entire era. In addition to his work as a madrigalist, and distinguishing him from the other prominent early composers of madrigals – Philippe Verdelot and Costanzo Festa – he was equally prolific and adept at composing chansons, particularly late in his career when he lived in Paris.

Arcadelt was the most influential member of the early phase of madrigal composition, the &quot;classic&quot; phase; it was through Arcadelt&#x27;s publications, more than those of any other composer, that the madrigal became known outside of Italy. Later composers considered Arcadelt&#x27;s style to represent an ideal; later reprints of his first madrigal book were often used for teaching, with reprints appearing more than a century after its original publication.

==Life==
Arcadelt was born in Namur in the Habsburg Netherlands on 10 August 1507. He moved to Italy as a young man, and was present in Florence by the late 1520s, thereby gaining an opportunity to meet or work with Philippe Verdelot, who wrote the earliest named madrigals. In 1538, or immediately before, he moved to Rome where he obtained an appointment with the papal choir at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica; many composers from the Netherlands served as singers there throughout this period, and it is even possible that he went to Rome before coming to Florence. Still in Rome, in January 1539, he was probably made a member of the Julian Chapel (the records give his name as &quot;Jacobus flandrus&quot;, suggesting a Flemish origin, but it cannot be known with certainty if this record refers to Arcadelt). After some months there, he became a member of the Sistine Chapel, where he was appointed &quot;magister puerorum&quot;. The same year saw the publication of no fewer than four books of his madrigals. The first of these collections, &quot;Il primo libro di madrigali,&quot; went through 45 editions, becoming the most widely reprinted collection of madrigals of the time.

Arcadelt remained in Rome as a singer and composer at the Sistine Chapel until 1551, except for one leave of absence to visit France in 1547. During this period, probably in early 1542, he made the acquaintance of Michelangelo, but his madrigalian settings of two of the artist&#x27;s sonnets were received with indifference; indeed, from Michelangelo&#x27;s letters on the topic, he probably considered himself unmusical and incapable of appreciating Arcadelt&#x27;s work. Michelangelo paid Arcadelt with a piece of satin suitable for making into a doublet.

Arcadelt wrote over 200 madrigals before he left Italy in 1551 to return to France, where he spent the remainder of his life; his numerous chansons date from this and subsequent years. In 1557 he published a book of masses, dedicated to his new employer, Charles de Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine (Arcadelt was &quot;maître de chapelle&quot;, i.e. choirmaster for him). In this publication he was mentioned as a member of the royal chapel, and therefore must have served both Henry II (died 1559) and Charles IX during this late phase of his career. In Paris he employed the publishing house of Le Roy and Ballard, who printed his abundant chansons, masses and motets just as the Venetian printers had earlier printed his madrigals.

Arcadelt died in Paris on 14 October 1568.

François Rabelais immortalized Arcadelt in the introduction to Book IV of &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;, where he includes the musician between Clément Janequin and Claudin de Sermisy as part of a choir singing a ribald song, in which Priapus boasts to the gods on Mount Olympus of his method of using a mallet to deflower a new bride.

==Music==
During his long and productive career, Arcadelt wrote music both sacred and secular, all of it vocal. He left a total of 24 motets, 125 French chansons, approximately 250 madrigals (about fifty of which are of uncertain attribution), three masses, as well as settings of the Lamentations of Jeremiah and the Magnificat. There may be as many as 250 more madrigals by Arcadelt which survive anonymously in manuscript sources. Influences on his music ranged from the chanson and polyphonic style of his northern homeland, to the native secular music of Italy such as the frottola, to the music he heard while he served in the Sistine Chapel choir. Of all the early madrigalists, he was the most universal in his appeal; his influence on others was enormous. Arcadelt brought the madrigal form to its early maturity.

===Secular music===

====Madrigals====
 (Madrigal for four voices; setting of a poem by Michelangelo, from the early 1540s)
Arcadelt&#x27;s several hundred madrigals, composed over a span of at least two decades, were usually for four voices, although he wrote a few for three, and a handful for five and six voices. Stylistically his madrigals are melodious and simple in structure, singable, and built on a clear harmonic basis, usually completely diatonic. The music is often syllabic, and while it sometimes uses repeated phrases, is almost always through-composed (as opposed to the contemporary chanson, which was often strophic). Arcadelt alternates homophonic and polyphonic textures, &quot;in a state of delicate, labile equilibrium&quot;. His madrigals best represent the &quot;classic&quot; phase of development of the form, with their clear outline, four-part writing, refinement, and balance; the word painting, chromaticism, ornamentation, virtuosity, expressionistic and manneristic writing of madrigalists later in the century are nowhere to be found in Arcadelt.

His music became immensely popular in Italy and France for more than a hundred years, with his first book of madrigals being reprinted fifty-eight times by 1654, and his music appearing in innumerable intabulations for instruments such as the lute, guitar, and viol. Additional hints to his popularity are the frequency with which anonymous compositions were attributed to him, and the appearance of his music in several paintings of musicians from the time. Likely his popularity was due to his gift for capturing the Italian spirit and marrying it with the technical perfection of the Franco-Flemish harmonic and polyphonic style; in addition he wrote catchy tunes which were easy to sing. Unlike later generations of madrigal composers, Arcadelt did not expect professional singers to be the only consumers of his work; anyone who could read notes could sing his madrigals.

For his texts, Arcadelt chose poets ranging from Petrarch (and his setting of a complete canzone, as a set of five interrelated madrigals, was the predecessor of the vogue for madrigal cycles), Pietro Bembo, Sannazaro, to Florentines Lorenzino de&#x27;Medici, Benedetto Varchi, Filippo Strozzi, and Michelangelo himself, to others such as Luigi Cassola of Piacenza, a now-obscure writer who was among the most often-set poets of the early madrigalists. Much of the poetry of Arcadelt&#x27;s madrigals has remained anonymous, just as some of Arcadelt&#x27;s music is believed to survive anonymously. Another poet he set was Giovanni Guidiccioni, who wrote the words to his most single famous composition, and one of the most enduring of the entire 16th century: the four-voice madrigal &quot;Il bianco e dolce cigno&quot; (The white and gentle swan).

This madrigal was appealing on many levels. According to Alfred Einstein, writing in &quot;The Italian Madrigal&quot;, &quot;… he is content with a simple, tender declamation of the text, depending upon the elementary and magical power of music, of harmony, which veils this poem in a cloak of sublime and distant sentimentality. Here is attained the ideal of what the time expected of the &quot;dolcezza&quot; [sweetness] and the &quot;suavità&quot; [suaveness] of music. Arcadelt has conferred upon this composition a quality which is very rare in sixteenth-century secular music, namely durability …&quot; The texture is mostly homophonic, with a hint of fauxbourdon in the harmony; the subject matter is erotic, with the orgasmic &quot;thousand deaths&quot; portrayed by a rising fourth figure in close imitation; brief bits of word-painting occur, such as the use of a flattened seventh on &quot;piangendo&quot;; and the musical phrases overlap the lines of verse, blurring the formal division of the line, a technique known in music, as in poetry, as enjambment.

====Chansons====
Since Arcadelt lived both in France and Italy, writing secular music in both countries, his chansons and madrigals not unexpectedly share some features. The chanson was by its nature a more stable form, often strophic and with patterned repetition; the madrigal, on the other hand, was usually through-composed. Arcadelt borrowed some features of the chanson when he wrote his madrigals, in the same way, he wrote some of his chansons with madrigalian features. Most of his chansons are syllabic and simple, with brief bursts of polyphonic writing, occasionally canonic, and with sections imitating the &quot;note nere&quot; style of the madrigal – the fast &quot;black notes&quot; producing the effect of a patter song. Some of his chansons were actually &quot;contrafacta&quot; of his madrigals (the same music, printed with new words French instead of Italian). Rarely in music history were the madrigal and the chanson more alike.

===Sacred music===
In addition to his copious output of madrigals and chansons, Arcadelt produced three masses, 24 motets, settings of the Magnificat, the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and some sacred chansons – the French equivalent of the &quot;madrigale spirituale&quot;. The masses are influenced by the previous generation of Franco-Flemish composers, particularly Jean Mouton and Josquin des Prez; the motets, avoiding the dense polyphony favored by the Netherlanders, are more declamatory and clear in texture, in a manner similar to his secular music. Much of his religious music, except for the sacred chansons, he probably wrote during his years in the papal chapel in Rome. Documents from the Sistine Chapel archives indicate that the choir sang his music during his residence there. Arcadelt&#x27;s &quot;Ave Maria&quot; is not an original sacred work by the composer. In 1842, Pierre-Louis Dietsch adjusted Arcadelt&#x27;s chanson &quot;Nous voyons que les hommes&quot; to the Latin text and added a bass line.

===Publishers===
Antoine Gardano became the primary Italian publisher for Arcadelt, although the competing Venetian publishing house of Scotto brought out one of his madrigal books as well. Arcadelt&#x27;s &quot;Il bianco e dolce cigno&quot; opened one of Gardano&#x27;s books; as the piece had already achieved immense fame, it was the main selling point. In Paris, some of Arcadelt&#x27;s chansons appeared as early as 1540 in the publications of Pierre Attaingnant and Jacques Moderne, so must have been written in Italy. After Arcadelt returned to France, his chansons, masses, and motets appeared in the editions of the printing firm of Le Roy and Ballard throughout the 1550s and 1560s, while his music was still being printed in distant Venice.

==Works==

A complete modern edition of Arcadelt&#x27;s works is published in CMM, xxxi, 1–10 (ten volumes), edited by Albert Seay. The first volume contains Arcadelt&#x27;s masses; his secular compositions are in volumes two through nine, and his motets and other sacred music are in volume ten. Below is a partial list of his works. Note that numbering is by number of voices: for example, there is an &quot;Il primo libro di madrigali&quot; (First Book of Madrigals) for four voices, and another &quot;Primo libro di madrigali&quot; for three.

<doc id="601626" wikidata="Q11487138" url="?curid=601626" title="Inasa District, Shizuoka">
<text>was a rural district located in western Shizuoka, Japan.

As of the end of 2003 (the last data available before its dissolution), the district had an estimated population of 52,485 and a population density of 227.20 persons per km2. Its total area was 231.01 km2.

==History==
Inasa District was created in the early Meiji cadastral reforms of April 1, 1889, and consisted at the time of two towns (Kito and Kanasashi) and six villages. On April 1, 1896 and Nishi-Hamana Village from were joined to Inasa District. Nishi-Hamana became a town on May 1, 1922, and was renamed Mikkabi, giving the district three towns and eight villages.

Iitani Village was annexed by Kanasashi, and the town renamed Inasa on April 1, 1953. On April 1, 1955, Kito annexed Nakamura Village and was renamed Hosoe. The remaining villages were consolidated in 1955–1956, with Miyakoda Village going to the city of Hamamatsu, Higahi-Hamada joining Mikkabi Town, Okuyama and Ihei Villages joining with Inasa Town and Aratama Village joining the town of Hamakita in Hamana District.

On July 1, 2005, the towns of Hosoe, Inasa and Mikkabi, along with the cities of Tenryū and Hamakita, the town of Haruno (from Shūchi District), the towns of Misakubo and Sakuma, the village of Tatsuyama (all from Iwata District), and the towns of Maisaka and Yūtō (both from Hamana District), were merged into the expanded city of Hamamatsu. Inasa District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

<text>A party is an individual or group of individuals that compose a single entity which can be identified as one for the purposes of the law. 

==Parties to litigation==
Parties include:· 

* plaintiff (person filing suit), 
* defendant (person sued or charged with a crime), 
* petitioner (files a petition asking for a court ruling), 
* respondent (usually in opposition to a petition or an appeal), 
* cross-complainant (a defendant who sues someone else in the same lawsuit), or 
* cross-defendant (a person sued by a cross-complainant). 

A person who only appears in the case as a witness is not considered a party.

Courts use various terms to identify the role of a particular party in civil litigation, usually identifying the party that brings a lawsuit as the plaintiff, or, in older American cases, the &quot;party of the first part&quot;; and the party against whom the case was brought as the defendant, or, in older American cases, the &quot;party of the second part&quot;. In a criminal case in Nigeria and some other countries the parties are called prosecutor and defendant.

<doc id="601629" wikidata="Q1405629" url="?curid=601629" title="Bhishma">
<text>Bhishma (), also known as Pitamaha, Gangaputra, and Devavrata, is a central figure in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. He was a statesman and military commander of the ancient Kuru Kingdom. Renowned for his wisdom, valor, and unwavering principles, Bhishma served as the supreme commander of the Kaurava forces during the Kurukshetra War.

Born to King Shantanu and the river goddess Ganga, he was originally named Devavrata. He was designated the heir-apparent to the throne. However, he renounced his claim and took a vow of lifelong celibacy to facilitate his father&#x27;s marriage to Satyavati. This unparalleled sacrifice earned him the title Bhishma, meaning &quot;the one who undertakes a severe vow,&quot; and he was blessed with &quot;Ichcha Mrityu&quot;—the boon of choosing his time of death.

Bhishma&#x27;s life after his vow was marked by unwavering loyalty to the Kuru dynasty. He served as the chief advisor and regent to successive rulers of Hastinapura, including his stepbrothers Chitrangada and Vichitravirya, as well as their successors—Pandu and Dhritarashtra. During this period, he came into confrontation with his teacher in warfare, Parashurama, for abducting Amba—a princess he had taken for Vichitravirya’s marriage. Under Bhishma&#x27;s guidance, the kingdom navigated complex political and familial challenges. He also played a pivotal role in arranging the marriages of Pandu and Dhritarashtra as well as in the upbringing of their children—the five Pandava brothers led by Yudhishthira, and the hundred Kauravas led by Duryodhana. Bhishma also mediated numerous conflicts within the royal family, including the division of the Kuru kingdom between Duryodhana and Yudhishthira. Despite his personal allegiance to dharma, Bhishma&#x27;s loyalty to the throne bound him to side with the Kauravas during the Kurukshetra War.

In battle, Bhishma was unmatched in skill and strategy, holding off the Pandava forces for ten days. On the tenth day, however, the Pandava prince Arjuna, aided by Shikhandi (reincarnation of Amba), incapacitated him with a volley of arrows, leaving him lying on a bed of arrows. Bhishma spent fifty-one days in this state, offering counsel to the Pandavas and Kauravas alike. Before his death, timed to the auspicious Uttarayana (winter solstice), he imparted the Vishnu Sahasranama to Yudhishthira and shared his vast knowledge on governance, dharma, and the duties of a king.

Revered in Hindu tradition, Bhishma is extolled for his sacrifice and duty. His death anniversary, observed as Bhishma Ashtami, falls on the eighth lunar day of the bright half of the Magha month (January–February).

==Etymology and epithets==
According to Monier Monier-Williams, the word &quot;Bhishma&quot; (भीष्म) means &quot;extreme&quot; or &quot;fierce&quot;. The word is also used to describe Rudra, the fierce god, as well as the Rakshasa. In the epic, Devavrata received this as he undertook a fierce or terrible vow (Bhishma pratigya) and fulfilled it. Bhishma was given the name Devavrata (देवव्रत) at his birth, meaning one who is devoted to Gods.

As Bhishma was the only surviving son of Ganga, he was given many epithets which mean &quot;son of Ganga&quot; &quot;Gangaputra&quot; (गंगापुत्र), &quot;Gang&quot; (गंग), Gangasuta (गंगासुत) and Gangeya (गांगेय). The word &quot;Gangadatta&quot; (गंगादत्त) means given by Ganga. Patronymics of Bhishma include Shantanava (शान्तनव), Shantanuputra, Shantanusuta and Shantanuja. Bhishma was also referred as:
* Gaurānga (गौरांग) – the one with fair body
* Shvetaveera (श्वेतवीर) – a white warrior or the one who is heroic white and has all weapons in white Colour
* Bhārata (भारत) – a descendant of Bharata
* Mahāmahima (महामहिम) – his excellency
* Parshuramashishya (परशुरामशिष्य) – disciple of Parshurama
* Pitāmaha (पितामह)- Grandfather (also known as Bhishma Pitamaha; called by Pandavas and Kauravas)
==Birth and early life==
Bhishma&#x27;s birth and youth are mainly narrated in the &quot;Adi Parva&quot; book of the epic. He was the only surviving son of Shantanu, a king belonging to the lunar dynasty, and his first wife Ganga, a river goddess. It is believed that he was the avatar of a Vasu named Dyu, alias Prabhasa.

According to the legend, Shantanu, the youngest son of the king Pratipa and the king of Kuru kingdom, was on a hunting trip, when he saw a beautiful woman on the banks of the river Ganga. He fell in love with her and asked for her hand in marriage. The lady agreed to his proposal but with one condition that he will never question her actions; and if this condition was broken, she would abandon him. Shantanu accepted it and lived a happy marital life with her. However, when a child was born, the queen used to drown him in the river Ganga. One by one, seven sons were born and drowned, while Shantanu remained silent because of his commitment. When she was about to throw the eighth child into the river, Shantanu, unable to control himself, stopped her and confronted her about her actions. After hearing Shantanu&#x27;s harsh words, the woman revealed herself to be the goddess Ganga and justified her actions and narrated the following story.

Once the celestial Vasus and their wives were enjoying themselves in the forest when the wife of Dyu spotted an excellent cow and asked her husband to steal it. The cow was Nandini, daughter of the wish-fulfilling cow Surabhi, and was owned by the sage Vashishtha. With the help of his brothers, Dyu tried to steal it but Vashishtha caught them and cursed them to be born as mortals and suffer a miserable life. Upon their pleading, Vashishta showed mercy and told the other seven Vasus that they will be liberated soon after their birth. However, Dyu being the protagonist of the theft was cursed to endure a longer life on the earth. Before the birth of her sons, Ganga was requested to kill the seven children soon after their birth. Hearing this, Shantanu was filled with grief and regrets and Ganga decided to abandon him as her condition was broken. Before disappearing, she promised Shantanu to return his heir.

Ganga named her son Devavrata and took him to different &quot;loka&quot; (realms), where he was brought up and trained by many eminent sages.

* Brihaspati and Shukracharya taught Devavrata the duties of kings (Dandaneeti), or political science and other Shastras.
* The sages Vashishtha and Chyavana taught the Vedas and Vedangas to Devavrata.
* Sanatkumara: The eldest son of the god Brahma taught Devavrata the mental and spiritual sciences.
* Markandeya: The immortal son of Mrikandu of Bhrigu&#x27;s race who acquired everlasting youth from the god Shiva taught Devavrata in the duties of the Yatis.
* Parashurama: The son of Jamadagni trained Bhishma in warfare.
* Indra: The king of the Devas. He bestowed celestial weapons on Bhishma.

Years later, Shantanu was roaming on the banks of the Ganga and observed that the water of the river had turned shallow. He saw a young man blocking the water currents with a dam made up of arrows. Shantanu recognised his son because of the similarities and begged Ganga to return him. Ganga appeared in a youthful form and handed her son to Shantanu as per her promise. The young Devavrata was known as Gangadatta as he was handed over by Ganga.

==The oath==

Devavrata was made the heir-apparent, and the citizens loved him because of his divine background and eligibility. Meanwhile, Shantanu went to the forest and met a fisherwoman named Satyavati, who operated the boats crossing the Yamuna. He fell in love with her and asked for her hand in marriage from her father. However, the fisherman-chief told that he would only agree if Shantanu promised to put the son born to Satyavati as the heir. Shantanu rejected the offer as he had already promised the throne to Devavrata and returned to the palace. He started to avoid any company and spend his time in bed in grief and solitude. Devavrata noticed his father&#x27;s sorrow and discovered the reason behind it from a minister.

Devavrata immediately rushed to the cottage of the fishermen-chief and begged him for Satyavati, but the fishermen-chief repeated his former condition. For his father&#x27;s pleasure and happiness, Devavrata ceded his rights to the throne and promised to put the son of Satyavati on the throne of the kingdom. Satyavati&#x27;s father was not assured as he claimed that disputes were likely to arise between Satyavati&#x27;s son and Devavrata&#x27;s children regarding the rights to the throne. To satisfy him, Devavrata took the vow of lifelong &quot;Brahmacharya&quot; (celibacy), thus denying himself the pleasures of marital life.

The celestials showered flowers from heaven and he came to be known as &quot;Bhishma&quot; as he took a terrible vow. With the consent of the fisherman, Bhishma took Satyavati to his father on a chariot and informed him about his vows. A loving father Shantanu gave him a boon of &quot;Iccha Mrityu&quot;, the control over the time of his death. Shantanu and Satyavati soon married and two children – Chitrangada and Vichitravirya were born.

==Affairs of Kuru Kingdom==
After the death of his father, Bhishma played a major role in the affairs of the Kuru kingdom. He managed the kingdom when there were succession crises. He also arranged the marriage of his nephews and tried to bring peace between his grand-nephews, the Kauravas and the Pandavas.

The text &quot;Harivamsa&quot; mentions that during the mourning period after Shantanu&#x27;s death, Bhishma killed Ugrayudha Paurava, a statesman of Panchala kingdom who lusted for Satyavati and tried to buy her with wealth. According to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Chitrangada was crowned as the king, however, he was soon killed by a &quot;Gandharva&quot; (celestial musician). Bhishma performed Chitrangada&#x27;s funeral rites. Vichitravirya, who was too young to rule, was crowned as the king by Bhishma but the actual control of the kingdom was under Satyavati until he reached adulthood. Bhishma aided Satyavati during that time.

===Swayamvara of the Kashi princesses and battle with Parashurama===

When Vichitravirya grew up, Bhishma decided to bring Amba, Ambika and Ambalikathe princesses of Kashi kingdomand get them married to him. Bhishma reached the kingdom and fought Shalva, easily defeating him and rightfully won over the princesses, who were choosing their spouse in a &quot;Swayamvara&quot; (ceremony where a woman chooses her husband from a group of suitors either by holding a competition or a task and the winner marries the princess). Shalva, the ruler of Shalwa or Saubala Kingdom and the lover of Amba, attempted to stop Bhishma but failed. Upon reaching Hastinapura, Ambika and Ambalika consented to marry Vichitravirya, while Amba told Bhishma about her love for Shalva. Learning about her feelings, Bhishma sent Amba to Saubala Kingdom.

The &quot;Udyoga Parva&quot; further narrates about Amba as well as the battle between Bhishma and Parashurama. When Amba requested Shalva to marry her, he rejected her, claiming that he was already humiliated during the Svayamvara. He also told her that he could not accept a woman, who was won by another man. A variant suggests that after Amba returned to Hastinapur, Bhishma then asked Vichitravirya to marry her, but he also refused to marry her as she loved another man. With no one to accept her, Amba blamed Bhishma for her misery and wanted revenge from him. She went to the kings of several kingdom and tried to convince them to slay Bhishma; but none of them agreed. After she was advised by some sages, she met Parasurama, Bhishma&#x27;s teacher and successfully convinced him in giving vow to help her.

Parasurama went to Kurukshetra and sent a message to Bhishma to meet him. Bhishma arrived at the place and offered his service to his teacher. Wanting to solve the situation, Parasurama ordered him to marry Amba, telling him that it was his duty. However, Bhishma denied it, reminding him about his vow. This enraged Parashurama and he threatened Bhishma with death. Bhishma tried to calm him but it failed. An intense battle began with both protecting their words. They fought for twenty-three days, each using celestial weapons. Ganga tried to stop them but was unsuccessful. On the twenty-fourth day of battle, Bhishma attempted to use the Prashwapastra against Parashurama, but the divine sage Narada and the gods intervened and showed their concern over the use of powerful weapons which could destroy the world. Parashurama ended the conflict and the battle was declared a stalemate. After hearing about the event, Amba decided to take her revenge on her own and did severe austerities to please the god Shiva. Shiva appeared in front of her and assured that she would be reborn and become instrumental in Bhishma&#x27;s death. Satisfied, she then made a funeral pyre of woods and killed herself. Years later, she was reborn as Shikhandini, daughter of King Drupada of Panchala kingdom.

===Political influences===

Vichitravirya was crowned as the king of Hastinapura and he ruled for a few years, before he died of tuberculosis. He had no offspring and the lineage was at the risk of extinction. Satyavati persuaded Bhishma to marry the widows of Vichitravirya and rule as the king or at least impregnate them to produce an heir. However Bhishma refused the proposal and told her about his vow. He then suggested that a sage could be requested to perform &quot;Niyoga&quot; (a practice in which another person is requested to impregnate a woman, whose husband is deceased or impotent). Satyavati called her premarital born son, Vyasa, to impregnate her daughters-in-law. Three children were born Dhritarashtra from Ambika, Pandu from Ambalika and Vidura from a maid. Bhishma trained them and also got them married. He arranged the wedding of Dhritarashtra with Gandhari, the princess of Gandhara Kingdom. He also brought Madri for Pandu from Madra Kingdom and also got Vidura married to the daughter of Devaka.

Despite Dhritrashtra being the eldest among the brothers, he was denied the throne because of his blindness. Pandu was appointed as the king, but later, he renounced his position and went to the forest with his wives. Dhritarashtra was made the de facto king and Gandhari gave birth to the Kauravas siblings. Meanwhile, Pandu&#x27;s two wives gave birth to the five Pandava brothers. After the premature death of Pandu, his first wife Kunti returned to Hastinapur with her sons. Satyavati, along with Ambika and Ambalika, decided to retire to the forest for penance, leaving Bhishma with the responsibility of the kingdom. A Brahmin warrior Drona, was hired by Bhishma to train the princes in warfare.

From their childhood, the Kauravas hated their cousins and tried to kill them multiple times. One such was the event of Lakshagriha, in which Duryodhana—the eldest Kaurava—decided to burn the Pandavas. Bhishma was despondent but Vidura consoled him and told them that the Pandavas were alive. The event led to the succession dispute between Duryodhana and Yudhishthira. To resolve this, Bhishma advised Dhritarashtra to divide the kingdom among the princes. The Pandavas made their capital in Indraprastha and performed the &quot;Rajasuya&quot; to achieve sovereignty and the status of the emperor. Bhishma supported them and attended the ceremony. He suggested Yudhishthira give Krishna the highest place in the ceremony, but this enraged Shishupalaan enemy of Krishna. He initially protested to give the position to Bhishma, but after Bhishma showed no objection in honouring Krishna, Shishupala started insulting him.

Bhishma was present during the gambling game in Hastinapur, where Draupadi—the wife of the Pandavas—was humiliated in the court. When she questioned the dharma of Yudhishthira losing her in the game, Bhishma tried but failed to answer her and described dharma to be subtle.

==The Kurukshetra War==
In the great battle at Kurukshetra, Bhishma was the supreme commander of the Kaurava forces for ten days. He fought reluctantly on the side of the Kauravas, having vowed to protect the city of Hastinapur from all threats and invasions.

Before the battle, at the Kauravas army&#x27;s assembly, Bhishma singled out Karna and forbade him from participating in the war under his command, and even affronted him as Sutaputra (son of Suta - child of a charioteer). Karna then mutually returned the hostility by refusing to serve under Bhishma. In truth, both sides of the affront were aware of Karna&#x27;s true lineage, and had to make pretext to prevent Karna from battling his brothers.

Bhishma was one of the most powerful warriors of his time and in history. He acquired his prowess and invincibility from being the son of the sacred Ganga and by being a student of Lord Parashurama. Despite being about five generations old, Bhishma was too powerful to be defeated by any warrior alive at that time. Every day, he slew at least 10,000 soldiers and about a 1,000 rathas.

At the beginning of the war, Bhishma vowed not to kill any of the Pandavas, as he loved them, being their grand-uncle. Duryodhana often confronted Bhishma alleging that he was not actually fighting for the Kaurava camp as he would not kill any of the Pandavas. He also did not allow any of the Kauravas to be killed in the war, as he loved all his grand-nephews and wanted a peace negotiation.

Duryodhana approached Bhishma one night and accused him of not fighting the battle to his full strength because of his affection for the Pandavas. On the next day there was an intense battle between Bhishma and Arjuna. Although Arjuna was very very skilled and powerful, he was not fighting seriously as his heart was not in it to hurt his beloved grandsire Bhishma. Bhishma fired arrows such that Arjuna and Krishna were both injured. Krishna, enraged over Bhishma&#x27;s devastation of the Pandavas army, got down from his charioteer seat and picked up a displaced wheel, intending to use it in place of his Sudarshana Chakra. Seeing this, both Arjuna and Bhishma stopped their battle, with the protector of Hastinapur humbly telling the avatar of Vishnu that he would immediately lay down his life should Krishna took action here and now. Arjuna ultimately convinced Krishna to remain true to his vow and returned themselves to their chariot. Thus Bhishma fulfilled his vow of forcing Krishna to raise a weapon. Then Arjuna used stronger weapons, injuring Bhishma. Bhishma and Arjuna&#x27;s duel was praised by the gods themselves as they watched over it from the sky.

The war was thus locked in a stalemate. As the Pandavas mulled over this situation, Krishna advised them to visit Bhishma himself and request him to suggest a way out of this stalemate. Bhishma loved the Pandavas and knew that he stood as an obstacle in their path to victory and so when they visited Bhishma, he gave them a hint as to how they could defeat him. He told them that if faced by one who had once been of the opposite gender, he would lay down his arms and fight no longer.

Later Krishna told Arjuna how he could bring down Bhishma, through the help of Shikhandi. The Pandavas were not agreeable to such a ploy, as by using such tactics they would not be following the path of Dharma, but Krishna suggested a clever alternative. And thus, on the next day, the tenth day of battle Shikhandi was accompanied by Arjuna as Arjuna was his chariot protector and they faced Bhishma who avoided Shikhandi. He was then felled in battle by Arjuna, pierced by innumerable arrows. Arjuna shot arrows at Bhishma, piercing his entire body. Thus, as was preordained (Mahadeva&#x27;s boon to Amba that she would be the cause of Bhishma&#x27;s fall) Shikhandi, that is, Amba reincarnated was the cause of Bhishma&#x27;s fall.

As Bhishma fell, his whole body was held above the ground by the shafts of Arjuna&#x27;s arrows which protruded from his back, and through his arms and legs. Seeing Bhishma lying on such a bed of arrows humbled even the gods who watched from the heavens in reverence. They silently blessed the mighty warrior. When the young princes of both armies gathered around him, inquiring if there was anything they could do, he told them that while his body lay on the bed of arrows above the ground, his head hung unsupported. Hearing this, many of the princes, both Kaurava and the Pandava alike brought him pillows of silk and velvet, but he refused them. He asked Arjuna to give him a pillow fit for a warrior. Arjuna then removed three arrows from his quiver and placed them underneath Bhishma&#x27;s head, the pointed arrow tips facing upwards. To quench the war veteran&#x27;s thirst, Arjuna shot an arrow into the earth, and a jet stream of water rose up and into Bhishma&#x27;s mouth. It is said that Ganga herself rose to quench her son&#x27;s thirst.

==Death==
After the war, while on his deathbed (arrow bed), he gave deep and meaningful instructions to Yudhishthira on statesmanship and the duties of a king. Bhishma always gave priority to Dharma. He always walked in the path of Dharma, despite his state because of the vow, he was supposed to forcefully follow the orders of his king Dhritharashtra, which were mostly Adharma, he was totally upset. He was sure he must let dharma win and Pandavas win, but the way he led the war and stayed silent were his sins in a way and he paid for it with the bed of arrows. Finally, Bhishma gave up the fight, focusing his life force and breath, sealing the wounds, and waiting for the auspicious moment to give up his body on the arrow bed. He did wait for about 58 nights for the winter solstice or first day of Uttarayana to give up his body on the arrow bed. His body was later cremated by Emperor Yudhishthira in a great ceremony.

&quot;Mahabharata&quot; states that he attained salvation after his death. He was granted the Maatru Lok (which is considered even above Swarga, the heaven). Magha (month) Shukla Ashtami marks the death anniversary of Bhishma Pitamah (Father), the day being known as Bhishma Ashtami. Hindus observe Ekodishta Śrāddha for him on this day, for many generations, and can only be performed by those whose fathers are not alive. Bhishma Panchaka vrata (fast) is observed in all Vishnu temples, starting from Bhishma Ashtami, for five days until Bhishma Dwadasi. People believe that they will have a son with the steadfast qualities of Bhishma if they observe these holy rituals on the river banks. It is also said that those who will perform this fast will live a happy life and attain salvation after their death.

<text>TheForce.Net (&quot;TFN&quot;) is a &quot;Star Wars&quot; news website that provides updates on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; media franchise. The web site launched in 1996 as the &quot;Star Wars Site At Texas A &amp; M.&quot; It was founded by Scott Chitwood and Darin Smith. TFN is officially &quot;TheForce.Net, LLC,&quot; and is currently part-owned by Philip Wise, who also runs the &quot;Star Wars&quot; collecting news site Rebelscum.com.

==Content==
The main page of TheForce.Net features the site&#x27;s news coverage. There are categories for movies, television, literature, games, and the fan community. Several categories also have special sections. For example, the television category hosts reviews of the TV show &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, and the literature category hosts TFN&#x27;s book release schedule and its literature reviews.

In addition to its function as a news site, TFN also archives a variety of media and resources. In the summer of 2000, the site hosted a fake movie trailer for &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; that included actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Hayden Christensen. The trailer surpassed one million downloads and generated favorable publicity for the movie itself.

TFN hosts astrophysicist Dr. Curtis Saxton&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars Technical Commentaries&quot;, a set of documents exploring the nature and limits of the technology in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Dr. Saxton has also written &quot;Incredible Cross Sections of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Incredible Cross-sections of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith&quot;, two publications by Dorling Kindersley which draw on material from the SWTC.

==History==
The area around Kaizu was part of traditional Mino Province. A midden from Jōmon period was found in Kaizu, which includes sea shells, tools, and human remains. These artifacts indicate that the area was settled as early as 2,500 years ago. Around these period, Kaizu was much closer to the ocean and many basket clam shells can be found. In 1319, towards the end of the Kamakura period, the first circle levee was completed. Originally, levees were only on the upstream portion of the city, leaving the downstream side vulnerable to floods. Once the full circle levee was completed, numerous other circle levees were built in the surrounding area. During the Edo period, most of the area was divided between Takasu Domain and &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate. Many of the events of the 1754 Horeki River incident occurred in this area. During the post-Meiji restoration cadastral reforms, the area was organised into Ishizu District, Gifu. The town of Takasu was created on July 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. During the early Meiji period, the foreign advisor Johannis de Rijke worked on improving flood control and man of the dikes in this area. The town of Kaizu was established on January 15, 1954 by the merger of Takasu with four neighbouring villages. The modern city of Kaizu was established on March 28, 2005, from the merger of the former town of Kaizu, absorbing the towns of Hirata and Nannō (all from Kaizu District).

==Cultural Locations/Events==
Hirata is home to Ochobo Inari shrine, dedicated to the Shinto god Inari (god of commerce). The shrine is somewhat famous around central Japan. Travelers visit Ochobo Inari every weekend to pray for success in business, and a street festival is held on the last night of every month. Visitors can try to get a favor from Inari by throwing &quot;age&quot; (fried tofu) into a special trough for him. 

Hirata is also home to the Sagicho Festival held every February. For several weeks before the event, the people of the town prepare special bamboo &quot;dashi&quot; (floats) measuring up to several meters high. They are then arranged onto wooden frames for carrying, and within the bamboo are placed items such as New Year&#x27;s poems, pictures, and Japanese flags. On the day of the festival the floats are carried to the town center by volunteers, and are then burned in front of hundreds of onlookers.

<text>Kim Carnes (; born July 20, 1945) is an American singer and songwriter born and raised in Los Angeles. A veteran writer of many of her own hits, as well as those for numerous other artists, she began her career in 1966 as a member of folk group the New Christy Minstrels, before embarking on a solo career as a songwriter and performer in the early 1970s, playing in local clubs. She also worked for several years as a session background singer with the famed Waters Sisters, Maxine Waters Willard and Julia Waters Tillman, who were later featured in the acclaimed 2013 documentary &quot;20 Feet from Stardom&quot;. In 1971, after she signed her first publishing deal with Jimmy Bowen, Carnes released her debut album &quot;Rest on Me&quot;. Released in 1975, Carnes&#x27; self-titled second album primarily contained self-penned songs, including her first charting single &quot;You&#x27;re a Part of Me&quot;, which reached No. 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. In the following year, Carnes released &quot;Sailin&#x27;&quot;, produced by Jerry Wexler, which featured &quot;Love Comes from Unexpected Places&quot;. The song won the American Song Festival and the award for Best Composition at the Tokyo Song Festival in 1976.

In her breakthrough year, 1980, Carnes and her husband, David Ellingson, were commissioned by Kenny Rogers to co-write the songs for his concept album &quot;Gideon&quot;. Her duet with Rogers, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall in Love with a Dreamer&quot;, hit No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and earned the duo a Grammy Award nomination. Later that year, Carnes&#x27; cover of Smokey Robinson&#x27;s &quot;More Love&quot;, from her fifth album, &quot;Romance Dance&quot;, hit No. 10. The following year, Carnes released &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;, which featured the chart-topping &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot;. A worldwide hit, it became the best-selling single of the year in the United States, spending nine weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, going Gold, and winning the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, was certified Platinum, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.

Carnes also had success with the singles &quot;Draw of the Cards&quot;, &quot;Does It Make You Remember&quot;, &quot;Crazy in the Night (Barking at Airplanes)&quot;, &quot;Make No Mistake, He&#x27;s Mine&quot; with Barbra Streisand, &quot;What About Me?&quot; featuring Kenny Rogers and James Ingram, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Here Where the Heart Is&quot; from the &quot;Flashdance&quot; soundtrack, and the Grammy Award-nominated singles &quot;Voyeur&quot; and &quot;Invisible Hands&quot;. Her other successes as a songwriter include co-writing the No. 1 duet &quot;The Heart Won&#x27;t Lie&quot; with Donna Weiss (who had co-written &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; with Jackie DeShannon); it was recorded by Vince Gill and Reba McEntire, and released on McEntire&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;It&#x27;s Your Call&quot;.

Her most recent studio album is &quot;Chasin&#x27; Wild Trains&quot; (2004). Since 1994, Carnes has resided in Nashville. She continues to write and perform and her songs have been featured in numerous films and TV series.

== Early life ==
Kim Carnes was born on July 20, 1945, in Los Angeles. Her father, James Raymond Carnes, was an attorney and her mother was a hospital administrator. Kim Carnes knew she would be a singer and songwriter from the age of three, despite the fact that she was not born into a musical family. &quot;My mother didn&#x27;t get my career, and my father, who was an attorney, didn&#x27;t think singing and writing was even a job.&quot; 

== Career ==
===Pre-solo career===
In 1966, she joined the folk group, The New Christy Minstrels, remaining with them until she embarked on a solo career. Joining her in the group around the same time was Kenny Rogers whom she later collaborated with during her solo years.

=== Early solo career and first studio album ===
Kim Carnes signed her first publishing deal with producer Jimmy Bowen. During this period, she shared demo-recording time with Bowen&#x27;s other writers, including Don Henley, Glenn Frey, and JD Souther. Carnes also sang &quot;Nobody Knows&quot;, written by Mike Settle, which was featured prominently in the 1971 film &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;. The film also featured Carnes&#x27; first cut as a songwriter, &quot;Sing Out for Jesus&quot;, which was recorded by Willie Mae &quot;Big Mama&quot; Thornton. After signing with Amos Records, her first solo album &quot;Rest on Me&quot; was released in 1971. It was produced by Jimmy Bowen.

In the early 1970s, Carnes and husband Dave Ellingson co-wrote several songs with David Cassidy, who was then at the peak of his career as an international idol. Carnes and Ellingson toured the world with Cassidy as an opening act. Cassidy&#x27;s albums &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot;, &quot;Dreams are Nuthin&#x27; More than Wishes&quot;, and &quot;Cassidy Live!&quot; include several songs penned by Carnes along with Ellingson and Cassidy. Carnes also provided backing vocals for these albums.

=== 1975–1979: Early chart successes ===
In 1975, Carnes released her self-titled second album on A&amp;M Records, and her first chart hit, &quot;You&#x27;re a Part of Me&quot;, written by Carnes, reached No. 32 on the US Adult Contemporary chart. Also recorded by both Rita Coolidge and Anne Murray, Carnes re-recorded this track with Gene Cotton three years later. The majority of tracks on this second album were written by Carnes and Ellingson.

Her third album &quot;Sailin&#x27;&quot; was produced by Jerry Wexler and released in 1976. One track, &quot;Love Comes from Unexpected Places&quot;, won Grand Prize at the 1976 American Song Festival. The song also earned the award for Best Composition at the Tokyo Song Festival. It gained additional notice after it was recorded by Barbra Streisand on her 1977 album &quot;Superman&quot;. Streisand also recorded Carnes&#x27;s &quot;Stay Away&quot; on her 1978 album &quot;Songbird&quot;. In spite of Streisand&#x27;s endorsement of her material, Carnes&#x27;s own Top 40 breakthrough did not occur until 1978 when Gene Cotton recruited her to record a duet version of &quot;You&#x27;re a Part of Me&quot;, which reached No. 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 1979, using the pseudonym &quot;Connie con Carne&quot;, Carnes recorded a song titled &quot;She Dances with Meat&quot;, written by herself and Dave Ellingson. The song was also recorded by country comedy duo Pinkard &amp; Bowden on their 1989 live album.

=== 1980–1981: Collaboration with Kenny Rogers and &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; ===
In 1980, her duet with Kenny Rogers &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall in Love with a Dreamer&quot; became a major hit on the Pop (No. 4), Country (No. 3) and Adult Contemporary (No. 2) charts. The song was culled from Rogers&#x27; concept album &quot;Gideon&quot;, written entirely by Carnes and her husband Dave Ellingson. Later that year, her cover version of the Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles song &quot;More Love&quot; became her first solo top-10 hit (number 10 in the pop charts and number six in the Adult Contemporary charts). Robinson was, indeed, so impressed with Carnes&#x27;s recording and success with the song that he later wrote and composed &quot;Being with You&quot; for her. However Robinson&#x27;s then producer George Tobin insisted instead that he record and release the song himself. &quot;The record that went number one for me is a demo for Kim,&quot; Robinson told &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. In 1981, Carnes provided backing vocals on Dionne Warwick&#x27;s &quot;No Night So Long&quot; album.

In 1981, Carnes recorded the Jackie DeShannon and Donna Weiss song &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot;, originally written and composed in 1974. As the first single released from the album &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;, it spent nine weeks at number one on the U.S. singles charts and became a worldwide hit. The song&#x27;s success propelled the album to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for four weeks. The single became the biggest hit of the entire year for 1981, and is second only to Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s &quot;Physical&quot; as the biggest hit of the 1980s in the U.S., according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. The song earned both the Record of the Year and Song of the Year awards at the 1982 Grammy Awards. Carnes was nominated for Best Pop Female, and &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; also earned a nomination for Album of the Year. Two follow-up singles were released from the album, the title track and &quot;Draw of the Cards&quot;, which also charted in the UK and Australia.

Carnes and her band rehearsed &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; in the studio for three days to take the melody and overall sound of the record to a darker, more haunting place. Produced by Val Garay, the song&#x27;s signature instrumental lick was created by keyboard player Bill Cuomo. Carnes and her band, including Cuomo, recorded a completely new arrangement of the song, the next day, with no overdubs.

Bette Davis admitted to being a fan of the song and approached Carnes and the songwriters to thank them. Davis wrote to Carnes after the song was released, saying she loved the song. &quot;It was a thrill to become a part of the rock generation,&quot; she said in her memoir &quot;This &#x27;N That&quot;. Davis&#x27; grandson Ashley told the screen legend she had &quot;finally made it&quot;. Carnes and Davis struck up a special friendship, with the singer visiting her at her home several times before Davis&#x27; death in 1989. In what she considers a career highlight, Carnes performed the song live for Davis at a tribute to the legendary actress held just before her death. More recently, the song was used in a 2008 Clairol Nice &#x27;n Easy TV commercial in the United Kingdom, and the ad featuring the song expanded into South Africa and other territories around the world. In 2008, the song was featured in the opening scene of the documentary film &quot;&quot; and continues to be licensed for film and TV use. In November 2015, the song was the set piece for the back-story of Liz Taylor in the TV anthology &quot;American Horror Story: Hotel&quot;.

=== 1982–1985: &quot;Voyeur&quot; and further releases ===
Carnes&#x27; later hits included two more singles that just missed the pop top 10: &quot;Crazy in the Night&quot; (from &quot;Barking at Airplanes&quot;) and &quot;What About Me?&quot; with Kenny Rogers and James Ingram. Kim also reached the Adult Contemporary Top 10 four times after &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot;–with &quot;I Pretend&quot; (No. 9), &quot;What About Me?&quot; (No. 1), &quot;Make No Mistake, He&#x27;s Mine&quot; with Barbra Streisand (No. 8) (co-produced by Carnes with Bill Cuomo) and &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; (No. 10). On January 19, 1985, Carnes had the distinction of being on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with three singles simultaneously, &quot;What About Me&quot;, &quot;Make No Mistake, He&#x27;s Mine&quot;, and &quot;Invitation to Dance&quot; from the soundtrack to the film &quot;That&#x27;s Dancing!&quot; It meant she was on the chart as a solo artist in addition to being part of a duo and a trio.

Carnes was nominated for additional Grammy Awards–including Best Rock Vocal Performance Female for &quot;Voyeur&quot;, in 1983 and Best Rock Vocal Performance Female for &quot;Invisible Hands&quot; in 1984. In 1983, Carne&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Here Where the Heart Is&quot; was included on the &quot;Flashdance&quot; soundtrack which received a Grammy for Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture. Carnes was also one of the singers invited to perform on USA for Africa&#x27;s 1985 famine relief fundraising single &quot;We Are the World&quot; and can be seen in the music video and heard singing the last line of the song&#x27;s bridge with Huey Lewis and Cyndi Lauper. In 1987, she sang the song &quot;My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own&quot; in a duet with Jeffrey Osborne for the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Spaceballs&quot;. In the same year, Carnes recorded &quot;The Heart Must Have a Home&quot; for the American film &quot;Summer Heat&quot;.

=== 1988–1993: Return to Nashville and Japanese releases ===
Carnes reunited with producer Jimmy Bowen for her eleventh album &quot;View from the House&quot;, released in July 1988. It peaked at no. 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. Featuring musicians including Vince Gill, Lyle Lovett, Steve Wariner and Bruce Hornsby, the album was described as a return to the country and folk influences of her early albums. &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single, peaking at no. 13 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart.

In 1991, Carnes recorded the single &quot;Hooked on the Memory of You&quot; as a duet with Neil Diamond for his album &quot;Lovescape&quot;. A second track titled &quot;Hard Times for Lovers&quot; was released as a bonus track. In 1992, Diamond released a compilation album titled &quot;The Greatest Hits: 1966–1992&quot; which featured a third duet with Carnes, a cover of &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;.

In 1993, Carnes released &quot;Gypsy Honeymoon: The Best of Kim Carnes&quot;. The title track peaked at No. 65 in Germany.

In 1997, Carnes co-wrote &quot;Just One Little Kiss&quot; with Greg Barnhill for Lila McCann&#x27;s debut album &quot;Lila&quot;.

=== 1994–present: Further songwriting success and &quot;Chasin&#x27; Wild Trains&quot; ===
In 1994, Carnes permanently moved from Los Angeles to Nashville. Throughout the 90s, she continued to write songs for other artists. &quot;The Heart Won&#x27;t Lie&quot; became a US Country no. 1 hit for Reba McEntire and Vince Gill, and was nominated for Single of the Year at the TNN &quot;Music City News&quot; Country Awards in 1994.

In 1997, Carnes recorded a cover of &quot;Bad, Bad Leroy Brown&quot; for a tribute album to Jim Croce. Numerous country artists recorded Carnes&#x27; songs in the late 90s and early 2000s, including Smokie&#x27;s version of &quot;When the Walls Come Down&quot; for &quot;Wild Horses – The Nashville Album&quot; (1998), Tim McGraw&#x27;s version of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me Anymore&quot; for &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1999), and Collin Raye&#x27;s version of &quot;Gypsy Honeymoon&quot; for &quot;Can&#x27;t Back Down&quot; (2001). Carnes provided backing vocals on the latter two recordings.

In June 2004, Carnes released her thirteenth and latest studio album, &quot;Chasin&#x27; Wild Trains&quot;, featuring songs co-written with Angelo Petraglia, Matraca Berg, Kim Richey, Al Anderson, Jeffrey Steele, Marc Jordan, Anders Osborne, and Chuck Prophet. The album was noted for its Americana and alt-country influences; it was compared to the musical styles of Stevie Nicks, Lucinda Williams and Melissa Etheridge. In the same year, Carnes provided backing vocals for two tracks on Tim McGraw&#x27;s album &quot;Live Like You Were Dying&quot;.

Throughout the 2000s Carnes continued to write and record songs for movie soundtracks, including &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; with Jeff Bridges for &quot;The Contender&quot; (2000), &quot;The Silver Cord&quot; for &quot;Loggerheads&quot; (2005), and &quot;It&#x27;s a Mighty Hand&quot; for &quot;&quot; (2006).

In 2007, Carnes recorded &quot;It&#x27;s Clear Sky Again Today&quot; for a tribute album to the Japanese singer-songwriter Noriyuki Makihara, and a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; song &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; with Jill Johnson for her album &quot;Music Row&quot;. Subsequent songwriting credits include &quot;Enough&quot; for Dana Cooper on his album &quot;The Conjurer&quot; (2010), &quot;Live to Tell&quot; for Alyssa Reid&#x27;s album &quot;The Game&quot; (2011), and three tracks for the Australian country duo O&#x27;Shea.

In October 2012, American label Culture Factory reissued Carnes&#x27; &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;, &quot;Voyeur&quot; and &quot;Cafe Racers&quot; albums. &quot;Light House&quot; and &quot;Barking at Airplanes&quot; followed in August 2013. In 2013, Carnes featured in an episode of the LMN series &quot;The Haunting of...&quot;.

In May 2015, Carnes was interviewed by singer-songwriter Peter Cooper at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville. In the same year, Carnes co-wrote and performed backing vocals on two tracks from Dana Cooper&#x27;s album &quot;Building a Human Being&quot;. She also recorded a cover of &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; by The Rolling Stones for &quot;80s Re:Covered&quot;, a conceptual compilation album featuring songs from the 70s recorded with the production style of the 80s. In the following year, Carnes was featured on &quot;To Be with You Again&quot; from Frankie Miller&#x27;s duets album, &quot;Double Take&quot;.

In 2021, Carnes performed at the Rheneypalooza Jam, an online concert and auction to raise funds for St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in Memphis.

== Artistry ==
=== Musical and vocal style ===
Carnes&#x27; voice has been described as &quot;distinctively raspy&quot; and &quot;throaty&quot;, leading to comparisons to the voices of Rod Stewart and Bonnie Tyler. In 1993, Keith Tuber of &quot;Orange Coast&quot; magazine referred to Carnes as &quot;The Queen of Rasp &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; in one of his articles.

== Personal life ==
Carnes resides in Nashville with husband Dave Ellingson (1967–present). They have two sons, Collin and Ry.

Ry, who is named after musician Ry Cooder, accompanies her vocally on the song &quot;Rough Edges&quot; from her album &quot;Barking at Airplanes&quot;. Collin is featured on this album at the beginning of the song &quot;Crazy in the Night&quot;. Collin co-wrote, with his mother, the songs &quot;Divided Hearts&quot;, &quot;Gypsy Honeymoon&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Now&quot;, and &quot;River of Memories&quot;.

== Awards ==
=== Grammy Awards ===
The Grammy Awards are awarded annually by The Recording Academy of the United States for outstanding achievements in the music industry. Often considered the highest music honour, the awards were established in 1958. Carnes has won two awards, from eight nominations.

<text>The United States Hockey League (USHL) is the top junior ice hockey league sanctioned by USA Hockey. The league consists of 16 active teams located in the Midwestern United States and Great Plains, for players between the ages of 16 and 21. The USHL is strictly amateur, allowing former players to compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college hockey.

The Fargo Force won the Anderson Cup as the 2023–24 regular season champions, as well as the 2024 Clark Cup playoff championship, their second in franchise history.

== Operations ==

The USHL is the country&#x27;s top sanctioned junior hockey league, classified as Tier I. Like comparable entities such as the Canadian Hockey League&#x27;s (CHL) three member leagues, the USHL offers a schedule of high-level, competitive games for top players aged 16 to 20.

Teams are subject to strict roster rules. In 2017–18 they may have no more than four overage skaters (players who have turned 20 in the first year of the season) and are limited to a maximum of five import players, three international players and two Canadian skaters. Starting in 2018–19, non-American goaltenders will count as two import players in a move designed to give more development time to American goalies, who are also exempt from the overage rule.

USHL teams, typically located in mid-sized cities, pay for all uniforms and equipment. Players live with local families, who receive a small stipend for food expenses, and either continue school or work part-time jobs. Due to their schedules, more than 90% of games are on weekends, which many NHL and college scouts attend. Average attendance at regular season games for the 2014–15 season was 2,715 with 1,384,820 fans attending games during the season.

Kyle Woodlief of &quot;Red Line Report&quot; stated in 2007 that the USHL&#x27;s first line players are as good as their counterparts in the CHL—historically an important producer of NHL players—but that the Canadian-based league has better third and fourth lines. In 2006, Trevor Lewis, the 17th pick in the NHL Entry Draft, was the first USHL player to sign an NHL contract immediately after playing in the league.

At the conclusion of the 2014–15 regular season, the USHL has tallied 251 alumni that have played in the NHL and has 347 current players with NCAA college commitments. According to the league, approximately 95 percent of its players will eventually land a Division I college scholarship.

On March 18, 2020, the USHL cancelled the rest of 2019–20 season and playoffs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The start of the following season was delayed to November 2020 and some teams had to suspend operations for the 2020–21 season.

== Draft ==

The USHL Draft is an annual event conducted in two &quot;phases&quot; during the second week of May. The first phase is an eight-round draft of U-17 players for the upcoming season. The second phase of the draft is open to all players eligible to play junior hockey who are not already protected by a USHL team. The number of players drafted varies, as each team will draft until they have filled the 45 spots available on their roster. Undrafted players are open to try out for any team as a try-out player. Each team must reduce their roster to 23 players for the start of the season, but may carry 18 additional players on an affiliate list.

== History ==

Precursors to this league were:
*American Amateur Hockey League (1947–52)
*Central Hockey League (1952–53)
*Minnesota Hockey League (1953–55)
*United States Central Hockey League (1955–61)

=== American Amateur Hockey League ===

The United States Hockey League was established as the American Amateur Hockey League in 1947 and began play for the 1947–48 season. When the league began operations it had five teams in and around the Twin Cities arena along with a team in Rochester. The league was made up three clubs from St. Paul which were 7-Up, Koppy&#x27;s and Tally&#x27;s, and two from Minneapolis, Jersey&#x27;s and Bermans, along with a team from Rochester called the Rochester Mustangs. After the 1947–48 season the St. Paul Tally&#x27;s dropped out of the league and left the five remaining members to make up the league for the 1948–49 and 1949–50 seasons. For the 1950–51 season the St. Paul 7-Up and St. Paul Koppy&#x27;s merged and became St. Paul 7-Up/Koppy&#x27;s. The Minneapolis Bermans dropped out of the league and new team called the Twin City Fords were added to give the American Amateur Hockey League four teams for 1950–51 season. The Rochester Mustangs were the only club to return for the fifth and final season of the American Amateur Hockey League in 1951–52. Gone were the St. Paul 7-Up/Koppy&#x27;s, Twin City Fords and the Minneapolis Jerseys, replaced by the St. Paul Saints, Hibbing Flyers, Minneapolis Millers, Eveleth Rangers and the first club based outside of the state of Minnesota, the Sioux City Iowa Sunhawks, which gave the league six clubs for 1951–52, its final season as the American Amateur Hockey League.

=== Central Hockey League ===

The American Amateur Hockey League was renamed the Central Hockey League for the 1952–53 season. Only five of the clubs who had made up the American Amateur Hockey League for 1951–52 season returned. Those clubs were the Rochester Mustangs, St. Paul Saints, Minneapolis Millers, Hibbing Flyers and the now called Eveleth-Virginia Rangers. Gone were the Sioux City Sunhawks.

=== Minnesota Hockey League ===

After a year as the Central Hockey League the league was renamed the Minnesota Hockey League and would be called this for the 1953–54 and 1954–55 seasons. Only two teams who had made up the Central Hockey League returned to make up the Minnesota Hockey League for the 1953–54 season. Those teams were the Rochester Mustangs and the Hibbing Flyers. Gone were the St. Paul Saints, Minneapolis Millers and the Eveleth-Virginia Rangers. The Grand Forks Red Wings were added and this gave the league three teams for 1953–54 season. The Rochester Mustangs were the only team to return for the second and final season of the Minnesota Hockey League. Gone were Hibbing and Grand Forks. The league added two teams in Minneapolis called the Culbersons and Bungalows and a new team in St. Paul, again called the Saints, to give the league four teams for 1954–55.

=== United States Central Hockey League ===

After two seasons as the Minnesota Hockey League the league became the United States Central Hockey League and would be called this for five years, 1956 to 1960. Only three of the four teams who had made up the Minnesota Hockey League for the 1954–55 season returned. Those teams were the Rochester Mustangs along with both Minneapolis clubs, the Culbersons and the Bungalows. Gone were the St. Paul Saints who replaced by a team called the St. Paul Peters. These four clubs would make up the USCHL for the 1955–56 and 1956–57 seasons. For the 1957–58 season the St Paul Peters were replaced by a team called St. Paul K.S.T.P. The Rochester Mustangs were the only team to return for the 1958–59 season. Gone were St. Paul K.S.T.P. along with both Minneapolis clubs (the Culbersons and the Bungalows). The league returned to four teams when it replaced these clubs with the St. Paul Capitols, Minneapolis Millers and the Des Moines Ice Hawks, marking the league&#x27;s return to Iowa. For the fifth and final season of the USCHL the St Paul Capitols dropped out and the league expanded to five teams and into new territory with a team in Michigan with the addition of the Marquette Sentinels and into Wisconsin with the addition of the Green Bay Bobcats.

==== 1961–79 ====

The United States Hockey League (USHL) operated as a senior ice hockey league from 1961 to 1979.

The USHL welcomed the first female professional hockey player in 1969–70, when the Marquette Iron Rangers signed Karen Koch.

By the late 1970s, the USHL had fallen on hard times. In the summer of 1977, clubs from the recently folded Midwest Junior Hockey League contacted the USHL. A unique merger was formed, with the three junior teams (Bloomington Junior Stars, Austin Mavericks, St. Paul Vulcans) and three remaining pro teams (Sioux City Musketeers, Waterloo Black Hawks, Green Bay Bobcats) gathered under the USHL banner. League governors decided on a two-division format, with the junior-aged teams in the Midwest Division and the professionals in the U.S. Division. The teams played an interlocking schedule that was, predictably, dominated by the professionals. The USHL&#x27;s split existence would last just two seasons. The minor-pro wing of the league folded following the 1978–79 season, providing junior hockey operators with the opportunity to redefine the circuit. The 1979–80 season was the league&#x27;s first as an entirely junior arrangement.

The league&#x27;s last season as a senior hockey league was 1978–79. During this final season the league comprised seven teams in two conferences. The U.S. Conference (with the Green Bay Bobcats, the Sioux City Musketeers and the Waterloo Black Hawks); while the Midwest Conference (with the Anoka Nordiques, the Austin Mavericks, the Bloomington Junior Stars and the St. Paul Vulcans). All seven teams were made up with players categorized as &quot;Senior Amateur&quot;. Following the 1978–79 season the senior league teams in the U.S. Conference folded and the USHL became an all-junior league the following season.

<text>Mon Mothma is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, primarily portrayed by Genevieve O&#x27;Reilly. Introduced as the leader of the Rebel Alliance in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), in which she is played by Caroline Blakiston, Mon has become a prominent character in subsequent prequel media, including the anthology film &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016), the animated series &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; (2010) and &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; (2017), and the live-action television series &quot;Andor&quot; (2022–present). The character also appeared in the 2023 live-action television series &quot;Ahsoka&quot;, again portrayed by O&#x27;Reilly, her first time playing the character in sequel media set after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s portrayal of Mon Mothma has received a universally positive critical reception, and Blakiston&#x27;s initial cameo appearance as the character has become an Internet meme.

One of only four female characters with dialogue in the original three &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, Mon Mothma was portrayed by Caroline Blakiston in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983). In 1997, Blakiston said of the supporting role, &quot;Certainly people are always very envious of me. When I join a new theater company, the other actors look down the program, see my &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; credit and say, &#x27;Oh, you were part of &quot;Star Wars&quot;.&#x27; I smile and say, &#x27;Yes, but only for twenty-six and a half seconds.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas cast Genevieve O&#x27;Reilly as Mon in the 2005 prequel film &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, but most of her scenes were ultimately cut from the theatrical release of the film. In advance of the role, O&#x27;Reilly studied Blakiston&#x27;s 1983 performance. She said, &quot;I remember studying the scene, really trying to work on capturing her voice, her syntax, so that fans could see a connectedness between me playing her and Caroline playing her.&quot; O&#x27;Reilly reprised the role in the 2016 prequel film &quot;Rogue One&quot;, and voiced the character in five 2017 episodes of the animated series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;. She portrayed Mon again, this time as a lead character, in the live-action 2022 television series &quot;Andor&quot;. O&#x27;Reilly noted in 2022 that Blakiston&#x27;s performance continually influences her own. She said, &quot;I was always interested in her, and each time I go to play her, I go back to that scene. You can see when Caroline does that in that scene, for me, there was always a pain at the heart of it. You could see that she was carrying a pain, and I was really curious about what that was. What has happened in this woman&#x27;s life? What has it cost to be her? What are the sacrifices that she has had to make along the way to be that leader of a rebellion?&quot; In expanding the character for &quot;Andor&quot;, O&#x27;Reilly drew from various real-life female politicians, including Liz Cheney, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jacinda Ardern and Angela Merkel.

Kath Soucie voiced Mon Mothma in three 2010 episodes of the animated series &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;.

=== Description ===
Initially, Mon Mothma is the senator from the planet Chandrila during the last years before the fall of the Galactic Republic. A leader and outspoken voice of the Galactic Senate&#x27;s Loyalist faction, she pushes back against the increasing overreach of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine&#x27;s policies and the subtle subjugation of the galaxy&#x27;s citizens. Finding herself fighting a losing battle, Mon ultimately leaves the Senate and founds the Rebel Alliance against Palpatine&#x27;s rising Galactic Empire, ultimately uniting the emerging Rebel factions into a singular unit. Under her leadership as the Chancellor and Commander-in-Chief of the Rebel Alliance, the Rebels destroy both iterations of the Empire&#x27;s planet-destroying weapon known as the Death Star, and eventually bring down the Empire itself. Mon subsequently serves as Chancellor of the New Republic, moving the seat of government from Coruscant to Chandrila. She later advocates that it be periodically rotated among different worlds. Mon&#x27;s policies spark the rise of two opposing factions within the Senate: the Populists, who support the autonomy of individual planets and systems, and the Centrists, who believe a stronger central government is necessary. She later steps down as Chancellor due to illness.

Amy Ratcliffe of &quot;Nerdist News&quot; described the character as &quot;continually a beacon of serenity. Calm and measured, Mon Mothma is a steady hand that the entire Rebel Alliance, and later the New Republic, can grasp for support. She has a hard edge to her; she has to, in order to carry the weight she does. But she only shows it when necessary.&quot; O&#x27;Reilly said that Mon is a &quot;genuine humanitarian&quot;, has a &quot;strong moral compass&quot;, and is a &quot;critical thinker&quot; and a &quot;considered decision maker&quot;. O&#x27;Reilly added, &quot;Early on when we met her, when she was much younger, we didn&#x27;t really see her taking action. We see her listening a lot, we see her gathering a lot of information ... these were foundation moments for that character and it informed her behavior with the rebels group.&quot; Ratcliffe wrote that Mon&#x27;s appearances prior to &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; have &quot;painted a quiet portrait of the character. She&#x27;s careful. She listens. She has strength, to be sure, but we don&#x27;t see it outwardly illustrated like [we do in &quot;Rebels&quot;]&quot;. In that series, Mon realizes that she cannot effectively fight the Emperor from the Senate, and boldly calls him a &quot;lying executioner&quot; in public. The comic &quot;Star Wars&quot; #28 (October 2022), set after the events of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), shows Mon&#x27;s unflinching reaction to the news that the Empire is building a second Death Star. Her confidence that the Rebels can destroy this one as they did the first makes Mon a character that Adrian Quidilla of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; called &quot;the beacon of hope that guides the Rebel Alliance.&quot; O&#x27;Reilly said, &quot;The iterations that we found her in, both in &quot;Rebels&quot; and in &quot;Rogue One&quot;, were similar: a leader of a rebellion with a tough decision. It requires a dignity and a strength, which is at the heart, I think, of Mon Mothma.&quot;

&quot;Andor&quot; creator Tony Gilroy noted that in previous appearances, Mon is &quot;presented as very proper and sober and perfectly put together all the time&quot;. He called Mon &quot;sort of a Nancy Pelosi character ... She&#x27;s kind of trying to do good ... and she&#x27;s losing&quot;. He noted, &quot;She a powerful presence in the Senate but she&#x27;s facing defeat after defeat after defeat as the Empire is taking over&quot;. O&#x27;Reilly said, &quot;I think she has been a woman who really believes in diplomacy, really believes in the power of a democratic chamber, for everyone to have a voice. I believe, with the encroachment of Empire and Palpatine, she has believed that she could still affect change from within. That she could make a difference, that chambers of parliament, for want of a better word, can breed allies, and can create effective opposition, diplomatically. I think when we meet her in &quot;Andor&quot;, she&#x27;s at the end of that line. O&#x27;Reilly explained, &quot;She&#x27;s been fighting this fight for a long time. And I feel like she&#x27;s been getting nowhere ... It is a wall of power and oppression in front of her that she is tired of fighting.&quot; Zosha Millan of &quot;Polygon&quot; compared Mon to series hero Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) in that they are both fighting against the Empire to give regular people better lives, but in different ways. While he pushes back against any authority figure, she has been trying to effect change from within the very power structures he resists, with little success. O&#x27;Reilly explained, &quot;Now she has to go outside structure. She has to risk, she has to enter a dangerous environment. And she really has to put her own beliefs on the line ... You see a woman put her life on the line in a very different way than Cassian is putting his life on the line.&quot;

In &quot;Andor&quot;, Mon&#x27;s efforts to finance and build the Rebel Alliance are paramount, even at the expense of her family. After some resistance, she agrees to commence the Chandrilan courtship process between her daughter and the son of shady banker Davo Sculdun (Richard Dillane) in exchange for his assistance with her financial machinations. Mon also sets up her husband to take the fall should the Empire notice the discrepancies in her accounts.

== Appearances ==
=== Film ===
==== &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) ====

Mon Mothma is introduced in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) as the leader of the Rebel Alliance against the Empire, portrayed by Caroline Blakiston. As the Rebels prepare to assault the Empire&#x27;s second iteration of the Death Star, Mon notes that &quot;many Bothans died&quot; to bring information about the Death Star to the Rebel Alliance. In 2022, Genevieve O&#x27;Reilly said, &quot;[&quot;Star Wars&quot; creator] George Lucas wrote this female leader back in the 1980s. That is to be respected and to be celebrated.&quot; She added, &quot;I think that was as ambitious then—perhaps even more ambitious—than it is now.&quot;

==== &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005) ====
A younger Mon is featured in scenes shot with O&#x27;Reilly for the 2005 prequel film &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, but most were ultimately cut from the theatrical release of the film. Corey Larson of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; argued that this was done because &quot;the movie&#x27;s political aspects needed to be shaved down considerably in order to make the film more palatable in the theater.&quot; O&#x27;Reilly said:

In a deleted scene from the film, Mon secretly meets with senators Bail Organa of Alderaan (Jimmy Smits) and Padmé Amidala of Naboo (Natalie Portman) during the last days of the Galactic Republic. Mon explains, &quot;We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.&quot; The group discusses Palpatine&#x27;s growing authoritarianism, and how to counter it, in what would be the seed of the rebellion against the Empire.

==== &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016) ====
In &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016), Mon Mothma (O&#x27;Reilly) and senator Bail Organa (Smits) are Rebel leaders who enlist Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), a young renegade woman sent to a work camp for her crimes against the Empire, to help identify and extract her father, scientist Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen), from Imperial confinement. Mon intends Galen to testify before the Senate and confirm the existence of the Death Star. He is killed during the extraction, but Jyn joins the dangerous mission to acquire the plans to the Death Star from the Imperial archive on Scarif. The success of this mission leads directly to the events of the originating 1977 film, &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

=== Animated series ===

==== &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; (2010) ====
Kath Soucie voiced Mon Mothma in three 2010 episodes of the animated series &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;. In &quot;Senate Murders&quot;, &quot;Heroes on Both Sides&quot; and &quot;Pursuit of Peace&quot;, supporting character Mon is an ally of fellow senators Bail Organa (Phil LaMarr) and Padmé Amidala (Catherine Taber). She makes her opposition to the war with the Separatists &quot;her defining campaign promise&quot;, and even attempts to reach out to the Separatist Senate in &quot;Heroes on Both Sides.&quot;

==== &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; (2017) ====
O&#x27;Reilly voiced Mon Mothma in five 2017 episodes of the animated series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, set a couple of years before the events of &quot;Rogue One&quot;. She said, &quot;I had finished filming &quot;Rogue One&quot;, and they rang and asked if I would I like to be involved in &quot;Rebels&quot;. I was thrilled. It was such an extraordinary thing to be a part of and to work with the team at Lucasfilm ... I would meet them via satellite link-up from wherever I was ... It was such a treat to step in at a different point in their storytelling.&quot; O&#x27;Reilly explained that Mon comes into the series in a &quot;highly charged time&quot; in which the &quot;stakes are high for everybody&quot;, and noted that the character &quot;really shows the traits of a true leader in very difficult, very heightened, dangerous times.&quot;

In &quot;Secret Cargo&quot;, the crew of the Rebel ship &quot;Ghost&quot; finds themselves secretly transporting Mon Mothma, who is being hunted by the Empire after speaking out publicly against Palpatine. She resigns from the Senate, calling for those who oppose the Emperor to join her in opposition. Ships begin to appear over Dantooine as the Rebel Alliance is formed. Rebel fighter Ezra Bridger petitions Mon Mothma to send reinforcements to thwart Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn&#x27;s assault on the rebel base on Atollon in &quot;Zero Hour: Part 1&quot;. Refusing, Mon points out that it is too soon for the Rebels to openly battle the Empire, and doing so would, as Thrawn surely intends, decimate their growing forces. In &quot;In the Name of the Rebellion: Part 1&quot;, the Rebel Alliance receives valuable intel from extremist Saw Gerrera, but Mon makes it clear she does not condone Saw&#x27;s unscrupulous methods. He later confronts Mon via hologram, accusing the Rebel Alliance of being too spineless to win against the Empire. Mon insists that Saw&#x27;s tendency to target civilians, kill surrendering enemies and break every rule of engagement are things the Empire would do. In &quot;The Occupation&quot;, Mon informs the &quot;Ghost&quot; crew that the Empire is testing a new kind of TIE Defender, and sends the team to Lothal for reconnaissance. In &quot;Crawler Commandeers&quot;, Mon approves a plan for Hera Syndulla and her team to attack an Imperial TIE Defender factory on Lothal.

=== Live-action television ===
==== &quot;Andor&quot; (2022) ====
In 2022, O&#x27;Reilly reprised the role of Mon Mothma in the live-action television series &quot;Andor&quot;, set five years before the events of the 2016 film &quot;Rogue One&quot;. &quot;Andor&quot; is centered on smuggler and future rebel Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), and Mon Mothma first appears in the fourth episode, &quot;Aldhani&quot;. Dalton Ross of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote of Mon&#x27;s inclusion, &quot;[We] are finally seeing this classic original trilogy character ... fleshed out beyond mere Rebellion briefings and interviews in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and &quot;Rogue One&quot;. Larson called her appearance in &quot;Andor&quot; &quot;by far—the most demanding role of the character seen yet&quot;, and noted that &quot;almost none of what Mothma does in &quot;Andor&quot; is what it seems&quot;.

===== Development =====
O&#x27;Reilly said of &quot;Andor&quot; portrayal of Mon, &quot;We really get to develop her as a character, and we get to learn about her not just as a senator, but as a woman. [We learn] what her life is like, what she has to wrestle with, what are the dangers to her life, what it costs to be her.&quot; Gilroy said of the character, &quot;She&#x27;s always presented as very proper and sober and perfectly put together all the time in canon, and it just seemed like that was such a perfect opportunity to say, &#x27;Well what&#x27;s really going on behind here?’ It was very exciting to take a sort of still portrait of someone and throw it away and build a real life behind it. She has a much, much, much more complicated life [than] anybody was ever aware.&quot; O&#x27;Reilly said it has been an &quot;extraordinary gift&quot; from Gilroy to be able to explore &quot;not just the role of the senator or the leader, but the woman behind that—who she is, what that is, what she has to sacrifice, what she has to risk, what the cost is to her, what this rebellion is to her.&quot; She explained, &quot;We meet a woman who looks different than we&#x27;ve seen her before, who feels different, who certainly dresses different. When she walks in, you can see the power that she wields. But within a couple of minutes ... it shifts dramatically to reveal a private face that we&#x27;ve not encountered before. You see that she&#x27;s under threat. You see that she&#x27;s in danger. You see that she&#x27;s taking risks.&quot;

O&#x27;Reilly added, &quot;We meet a woman steeped in empire, navigating a very male-dominated empire with a very powerful Emperor Palpatine at the top of it. We&#x27;ve seen her surrounded by people... maybe with different opinions, but like-minded rebels. We find her in &quot;Andor&quot; very alone, living in a world of orthodoxy and construct. We see a woman who has had to navigate her ideals and beliefs within systems of oppression.&quot; O&#x27;Reilly said that Gilroy wanted to explore the rules and constructs that Mon, who has been married and a senator since she was 16 years old, has had to navigate within during the intervening 14 years. She asked, &quot;What is that cage?&quot; O&#x27;Reilly explained that &quot;Andor&quot; presents Mon as a &quot;deeply complicated woman&quot; who &quot;might make compromising choices that we haven&#x27;t seen before.&quot; Being set five years before the events of &quot;Rogue One&quot; allows the series &quot;to discover where this woman goes, and how she navigates the dangers and the risks that is her life, and how she ends up in a world where she introduces Cassian Andor to Jyn Erso.&quot;

In the series, Mon has an elevated wardrobe and hairstyle from previous appearances. O&#x27;Reilly said, &quot;We wanted to meet her at a new stage, a stage we hadn&#x27;t seen before. And so, you meet a very successful, political woman ... she is successful, she is sophisticated, she is a political mover, she is living within a world of high society. So, we wanted her look to reflect that. It&#x27;s five years before she&#x27;s in a bunker, you know?&quot; She added, &quot;What Tony [Gilroy] has done is write a character ... in a polar opposite moment of their life to &quot;Rogue One&quot;, so we have somewhere to go. So, why not meet her in an art gallery, in beautiful clothes, flown in on this extraordinary car and navigating this sophisticated, but deceptive, life?&quot;

===== Storylines =====
In &quot;Andor&quot;, Mon is an embattled senator from Chandrila, fighting against the increased overreach of the Imperial regime. Watched closely by agents of the Imperial Security Bureau (ISB), she is secretly raising funds for the nascent Rebel Alliance. &quot;Andor&quot; also introduces Mon&#x27;s disaffected husband Perrin Fertha (Alastair Mackenzie) and daughter Leida Mothma (Bronte Carmichael). Vel Sartha (Faye Marsay), an active member of the Rebel Alliance in the field, is revealed to be Mon&#x27;s cousin in &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Listening!&quot;. Gilroy said, &quot;Of all the people that walk through this show and face all kinds of decisions and problems and pressures and the hiding and chasing and betrayal—[Mon] has to stand out almost in the open for the whole show, in a really dangerous position. In many ways her story is the most tense story in the whole show, because she has to do everything in the open.&quot;

In &quot;Aldhani&quot;, Senator Mon Mothma meets with antiques dealer Luthen Rael (Stellan Skarsgård) on Coruscant, ostensibly looking for a gift for her husband. Luthen, however, runs a network of rebels quietly fighting against the Empire, and Mon is funding his efforts. Restricted by Imperial policies and suspecting that she is being watched by the Imperial Security Bureau, Mon is having increased difficulty accessing and moving money, and they both face challenges in keeping their opposition to the Empire hidden. At home, Mon&#x27;s husband Perrin has invited some of her opponents in the Senate to their dinner party. He does not share her sense of urgency regarding the Empire&#x27;s rising power, and is dismissive of how seriously she takes it. O&#x27;Reilly said that the episode &quot;exposes how much of Empire is also within the marriage, and how far she has to go to fight for what she really believes in. She has to lose a lot, because her husband is Empire. Perhaps her life is Empire. She has to escape it, right? Or she has to risk stuff. And she ends up in that rebel bunker.&quot; She noted that though Mon&#x27;s passions are expressed in her encounter with Luthen, at home she must put on the armor of her political persona.

In &quot;The Axe Forgets&quot;, Mon establishes a new charitable foundation while managing increasingly tense relations with her husband and daughter, who are annoyed by her devotion to her work. Mon&#x27;s protests to the Senate about the Republic&#x27;s treatment of the planet Ghorman fall on deaf ears in &quot;The Eye&quot;. In &quot;Announcement&quot;, Mon learns that Luthen was involved in the recent robbery of an Imperial base on Aldhani. Though fearful of the inevitable Imperial crackdown, she understands it is time to step up efforts against the Empire. Mon also reunites with banker Tay Kolma (Ben Miles), a childhood friend from Chandrila, and enlists him to help her funnel her family funds to the Rebellion without detection. In &quot;Narkina 5&quot;, Mon attempts to collect votes to oppose new Imperial legislation, which Tay agrees is having a chilling effect. He warns Mon that the Empire&#x27;s new banking laws are making it more difficult to move money surreptitiously. Mon&#x27;s daughter Leida remarks how often Tay has been visiting. At a banquet, Mon explains to her guests that she and Perrin were married at 16, per Chandrilan custom, around the same time she became a senator.

Mon addresses the Senate to criticize the Empire&#x27;s new directives in &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Listening!&quot;, but is met with opposition. She reunites with Vel, revealed as her cousin, and encourages her to keep a low profile while maintaining the facade of a rich and politically uninvolved young woman. Tay alerts Mon that one large transaction she has made may put her in jeopardy should the authorities examine her accounts. He suggests she cover the amount with a loan from shady Chandrilan banker Davo Sculdun (Richard Dillane), whom she calls a thug. Mon meets with Davo in &quot;One Way Out&quot;, and he offers to help her facilitate her clandestine financial transactions. His price for the assistance is for Mon arrange a meeting between her daughter and his son, an initial step towards marriage in Mon and Davo&#x27;s Chandrilan culture. Horrified at the idea of a child betrothal for Leida, like Mon&#x27;s own, Mon declines the offer. In &quot;Daughter of Ferrix&quot;, Mon and Vel are uncomfortable with Leida&#x27;s interest in Chandrilan courtship rituals. Mon laments to Vel the danger she is in concerning missing funds in her accounts. Mon admits she is considering a solution that would require her to use Leida as a bargaining chip. Mon&#x27;s daughter Leida and Davo&#x27;s son Stekan (Finley Glasgow) are formally introduced in &quot;Rix Road&quot;. To create a cover story for the missing funds, Mon stages an argument in front of her driver Kloris (Lee Ross), who she knows is an ISB spy, suggesting that Perrin has gambled the money away. Kloris reports the conversation to ISB supervisor Blevin (Ben Bailey Smith).

==== &quot;Ahsoka&quot; (2023) ====
O&#x27;Reilly appears as Mon, now the Chancellor of the New Republic, in the series &quot;Ahsoka&quot;. In &quot;Part Three: Time to Fly&quot;, General Hera Syndulla (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) seeks New Republic resources from Mon and her team of high-ranking government officials, but Senator Hamato Xiono (Nelson Lee) is dubious of Hera&#x27;s desire to pursue rumors of Grand Admiral Thrawn. In &quot;Part Five: Shadow Warrior&quot;, Mon appears to Hera via hologram, warning Hera that her disobedience has prompted New Republic Oversight to demand her return to Coruscant to be questioned by them. In &quot;Part Seven: Dreams and Madness&quot;, Mon reluctantly oversees the tribunal administering Hera&#x27;s disciplinary hearing, and comes to believe that the threat of Thrawn&#x27;s return is real.

===Other media===
====Novels====
Chuck Wendig&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;Aftermath&quot; establishes that after the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Mon quickly transitions the Rebel Alliance into the New Republic, forming the New Republic Senate and becoming the new government&#x27;s first Chancellor. Hoping to prevent the New Republic from ever becoming corrupted into a fascist state, she scales down the centralized military in favor of local planetary forces. In the 2016 novel &quot;Star Wars: Bloodline&quot;, Mon has stepped down as Chancellor due to illness. But her attempt to prevent centralized overmilitarization from creating a new Empire by advocating a drastic reduction of the New Republic fleet has sparked the rise of two opposing factions in the Senate: the Populists, who support autonomy of individual planets and systems, and the Centrists, who believe a stronger central government is necessary. As member systems are allowed to build their own defense forces, some Centrist elements ultimately back the nascent First Order regime.

Mon also appears briefly in the novels &quot;Lost Stars&quot; (2015), &quot;The Princess and the Scoundrel&quot; (2022) and the &quot;Alphabet Squadron&quot; trilogy (2019–2021).

====Comics====
Mon appears in the 2015 comic series &quot;Shattered Empire&quot;, set immediately after the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. In the comic &quot;Star Wars&quot; #28 (October 2022), set after the events of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), Mon is informed that the Empire is building a second Death Star. While others are shocked to silence, she expresses her confidence that after destroying the first one, they can do it again.

===&quot;Star Wars Legends&quot;===
Mon Mothma has a major role in &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; media. &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; refers to the alternate continuity of &quot;Star Wars&quot; ancillary works starting with the 1991 Timothy Zahn novel &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; and ending when Lucasfilm rebranded the &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; continuity in 2014 to accommodate plans for film sequels, TV series and new fiction. In this continuity, New Republic Chief of State Mon Mothma is unable to demilitarize the government due to ongoing conflicts with Imperial warlords and other remnants of the Empire. In &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;, she becomes the New Republic&#x27;s Chief of State and works with characters including Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Admiral Ackbar to restore Coruscant as the democratic heart of the galaxy. Mon survives an assassination attempt in the &quot;Jedi Academy&quot; trilogy (1994), and prepares Leia to become her successor.

In the 1990s comic series &quot;Dark Empire&quot;, Mon also helps Luke form a New Jedi Order less involved with Republic politics than the original Jedi.

The 1993 West End Games &quot;Dark Empire Sourcebook&quot; for &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot; notes that Mon and her family were forced to flee their homeworld when she was revealed to be part of the Rebel Alliance. Her son, Jobin, was a rebel soldier killed in the Battle of Hoth, and Mon&#x27;s duties as a resistance leader impacted the time she could spend with her daughter, Lieda. Both &quot;The Essential Guide to Characters&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia&quot; (2008) mention that Lieda ultimately worked alongside Mon toward peace for the Republic.

====Video games====
Mon is featured in the 1995 first-person shooter video game &quot;Star Wars: Dark Forces&quot;. She appears in the 2008 action-adventure video game &quot;The Force Unleashed&quot;, and its novelization. In the story, Bail Organa meets with fellow senators Mon and Garm Bel Iblis on Corellia to formally organize a rebellion, only for the group to be arrested by Darth Vader.

== Merchandising ==
Hasbro has produced three Mon Mothma action figures: the &quot;Star Wars: The Power of the Force II&quot; Mon Mothma with Baton in 1998; the &quot;Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Collection&quot; Mon Mothma in 2005; and an &quot;Andor&quot;-related figure, &quot;Star Wars: The Black Series&quot; Senator Mon Mothma, in 2023.

== Reception ==
Eric Diaz of &quot;Nerdist News&quot; called Mon Mothma &quot;crucial to &quot;Star Wars&quot;&quot;. Adrian Quidilla of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; wrote that &quot;Mon Mothma&#x27;s ability to inspire and organize a galaxy-wide revolution makes her arguably the most significant Rebellion figure of them all, as the outcome of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; original trilogy couldn&#x27;t have happened without her unflagging hope.&quot; Jeremy Smith of &quot;Slashfilm&quot; agreed that the character has been an integral figure in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga since her first film appearance&quot;, but noted that prior to &quot;Andor&quot;, Mon had been &quot;completely underserved&quot; in live-action media. Corey Larson of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; called O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s performance in &quot;Andor&quot; &quot;revelatory&quot;, noting that &quot;George Lucas clearly recognized how Mon Mothma had the potential to be a pivotal and popular figure in &quot;Star Wars&quot; lore and that O&#x27;Reilly was the perfect candidate for the job.&quot; Simon Cardy of &quot;IGN&quot; agreed that &quot;O&#x27;Reilly is fantastic in her portrayal of a thoroughly empathetic character going up against an Empire [in &quot;Andor&quot;]&quot;. Blake Hawkins of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; called Mon a &quot;badass&quot; and &quot;master manipulator&quot; for the character&#x27;s actions in the season one finale &quot;Rix Road&quot;.

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s portrayal of Mon Mothma has received a universally positive critical reception, and Blakiston&#x27;s initial cameo role as the character has become an Internet meme.

<text>Alstroemeriaceae is a family of flowering plants, with 254 known species in four genera, almost entirely native to the Americas, from Central America to southern South America. One species of &quot;Luzuriaga&quot; occurs in New Zealand, and the genus &quot;Drymophila&quot; is endemic to south-eastern Australia.

The genus &quot;Alstroemeria&quot;, commonly called the Peruvian lilies, are popular florist&#x27;s and garden flowers. The genus &quot;Bomarea&quot; is a vine that produces clusters of variously-colored, bell-shaped flowers.

==Classification==
The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), treats the family in the order Liliales, in the clade monocots. The APG III system, of 2009, merged the obscure family Luzuriagaceae into the Alstroemeriaceae, since the former group included only two genera, was the sister group of the Alstroemeriaceae, and possessed the same distinctive twisted petioles.

==Distribution==
Alstroemeriaceae is distributed in tropical and temperate America, from Mexico and the Antilles to Tierra del Fuego. Luzuriageae is distributed from Peru to the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego, New Zealand and Australia (NSW to Tasmania).

==Uses==

===As food===
&quot;Bomarea edulis&quot; is distributed from Mexico to Argentina. Its tubers have been used from pre-Columbian times as a food source. A single plant can have up to 20 tubers each 5 cm in diameter.

===As ornamental plants===
Some of the Alstroemeriaceae species used for ornamental purposes are:
*&quot;Alstroemeria aurea&quot;: endemic to Southern Chile. Flowers in the summer. Flowers are 3–4 cm in diameter, they&#x27;re yellow and orange, tinged with green.
*&quot;Alstroemeria haemantha&quot;: endemic to Chile, especially near Valparaíso. It grown near rocks and flowers at the beginning of summer. It has red flowers that can grow up to 5 cm in diameter. 
*&quot;Alstroemeria ligtu&quot;: endemic to Chile, it grows in stoney, sand, dry soil. It flowers at the end of spring and the beginning of summer and has a height of 60 cm–1 m. Its flowers present several colours, usually lilac and pink, red or white.
*&quot;Alstroemeria psittacina&quot;: distributed in the Brazilian swamp, Peru and the Misiones Province in Argentina. Its flowers have a length of 4–5 cm, and grow in bunches of 5 to 6 flowers. Its petals are red and green.
*&quot;Bomarea ovallei&quot; (syn.: &quot;Leontochir ovallei&quot;): endemic to Chile, grows in stoney soil in full sunlight in the 3rd Region of Chile. It has red flowers, which can also be yellow, although rarely. They can have a diameter of up to 10 cm. It is an endangered species due to its modest distribution and its use as food by wild animals.

Other species, such as &quot;Luzuriaga radicans&quot;, also endemic to Chile, have potential as ornamental plants.

<text>The sandcrawler is a fictional transport vehicle in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe that is found on the desert planet Tatooine. The vehicle, as it appears in its major appearances in &quot;Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope&quot;, is 37 meters long and 18 meters tall. Only a 27-meter length of its lower hull was constructed as a set for the film. Other appearances were simulated with matte paintings and a remote-controlled model.

== Origin and design ==
The design of the sandcrawler was first inspired by photographs of a NASA-designed rover created to explore alien planets. It was conceived as large, old, very rusty, and having treads. The front of the vehicle was envisioned to have a mouth-like scoop that lowered with hydraulics to pick up things, like a garbage truck. While its original design was streamlined, it was modified to be taller and more awkward-looking. The final design was created on April 5, 1975.

== Production ==
The prefabricated movie set of the sandcrawler was shipped from England and took special effects expert John Stears and his crew four days to move it thirty miles into the Tunisian desert. It was two stories tall and ninety feet long when it was fully assembled, with the caterpillar tracks being almost twice as tall as a person, and covered in sand and mud to give them a &quot;used&quot; look. The night before the scene with the Jawas was to be shot, a sandstorm blew apart the set, and it took a day to put it back together and an additional day to shoot the scene. Afterwards, it was transformed into a burned-out hulk, taking another day.

The construction of the sandcrawler piqued the interest of the Libyan government, who sent inspectors across the border to make sure it was not an actual military vehicle of some kind.

== Depiction ==

Most sandcrawlers are homes to Jawas. They were originally constructed in Corellia for the purpose of serving as ore haulers during mining operations, and many were brought to Tatooine when it was first settled as a mining colony. When the mining industry collapsed they were abandoned and the native Jawa took them over. The number of sandcrawlers is unknown on Tatooine because most Jawa clans only meet during the annual &quot;swap meets&quot; when Jawa clans meet to trade with each other. Jawa clans usually worship the Sandcrawler they have inhabited for generations. The Sandcrawler is powered by eight massive turbines to power the treads which pull it over the dunes of the desert. Since repairs are not done thoroughly, sandcrawlers are liable to fail at any time. Within the Sandcrawler are a maze of tunnels, living quarters and rooms which keep spare parts, machinery and captured droids. The front of the Sandcrawler opens to form a large ramp though there are also hatches between the giant treads that provide access to and from the crawler. They are powerful enough to withstand Tusken Raiders but are no match for Imperial Stormtroopers.

The Sandcrawler first appeared in the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope&quot;, where R2-D2 and C-3PO were transported across the desert terrain of Tatooine. They make a cameo appearance in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; in the establishing shot for the podrace, and also appeared in the &quot;Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot; when Anakin Skywalker asks a Jawa leader for directions to a Tusken Raider camp. One also appeared in the post credits of a documentary on &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; DVD. It was shown during the podrace, moving faster than and overtaking Sebulba&#x27;s podracer. A Sandcrawler and Jawas are also seen in the final sequence of &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; when Rey arrives on Tatooine. Sandcrawlers, or early predecessors, have made appearances in many &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games, such as &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot; (used by the Czerka Corporation), and &quot;Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy&quot;. A digital pinball table based on &quot;Star Wars&quot; droids has a cabinet that moves and is shaped like a sandcrawler.

The vehicle appears in the Disney+ series &quot;The Mandalorian,&quot; in a scene where the titular character pursues a sandcrawler carrying the scavenged parts from his ship.

==Cultural references==
A 17-inch, radio-controlled toy Sandcrawler was released in 1979 as part of the original Kenner Star Wars toy line; a recolored version with a more &quot;authentic&quot; painted surface was issued in 2004. In 2005, Lego came out with a detailed model.

Lucasfilm&#x27;s Singapore base is shaped and named after the Sandcrawler.

<doc id="601694" wikidata="Q1143195" url="?curid=601694" title="Greater China">
<text>In ethnogeography, Greater China is a loosely-defined term that refers to the region sharing cultural and economic ties with the Chinese people, often used by international enterprises or organisations in unofficial usage. The notion contains a &quot;great deal of ambiguity in its geographical coverage and politico-economic implications&quot;, because some users use it to refer to &quot;the commercial ties among ethnic Chinese, whereas others are more interested in cultural interactions, and still others in the prospects for political reunification&quot;. The term encompass &quot;linkages among regional Chinese communities&quot;, but usually refers to an area encompassing the People’s Republic of China (mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau) and the Republic of China (known as Taiwan), places where the majority population is culturally Chinese. Some analysts may also include places which have predominantly ethnic Chinese population such as Singapore.

The term&#x27;s usage is contested; some observers in Taiwan characterise the term as harmful or a conflation of distinct polities and markets, while the Chinese government has avoided it, either to allay fears of its economic expansionism or to avoid suggesting Taiwan (known as the Republic of China) and the People&#x27;s Republic of China are on equal footing. Australian sinologist Wang Gungwu has characterised the concept as a &quot;myth&quot;, and &quot;wrong&quot; if applied to overseas Chinese communities.

==Usage==
Multinational corporations frequently use the term when naming their headquarters in the region. For example, Procter &amp; Gamble uses the term to name its regional headquarters in Guangzhou that also operates in Hong Kong and Taipei; Apple Inc. uses it when referring to its regional headquarters in Shanghai.

The term is often used to avoid invoking sensitivities over the political status of Taiwan. Contrastingly, it has been used in reference to Chinese irredentism in nationalist contexts, such as the notion that China should reclaim its &quot;lost territories&quot; to create a Greater China.

==History==

The term has been used for a long time, but with differing scopes and connotations.

During the 1930s, George Cressey, an American academic who did work for the US State Department throughout his career, used the term to refer to the entirety of the territory controlled by the Qing dynasty, as opposed to China proper. Usage by the United States on government maps in the 1940s as a political term included territories claimed by the Republic of China that were part of the previous Qing Empire, or geographically to refer to topographical features associated with China that may or may not have lain entirely within Chinese political borders. 

The concept began to appear again in Chinese-language sources in the late 1970s, referring to the growing commercial ties between the mainland and Hong Kong, with the possibility of extending these to Taiwan, with perhaps the first such reference being in a Taiwanese journal &quot;Changqiao&quot; in 1979. 

The English term subsequently re-emerged in the 1980s to refer to the growing economic ties between the regions as well as the possibility of political unification. It is not an institutionalized entity such as the EU, ASEAN, or AU. The concept is a generalization to group several markets seen to be closely linked economically and does not imply sovereignty. The concept does not always include Taiwan, for instance Cisco uses &quot;Greater China and Taiwan&quot; to refer to the market.

<text>Sir Thomas Mackenzie (10 March 1853 – 4 February 1930) was a Scottish-born New Zealand politician and explorer who briefly served as the 18th prime minister of New Zealand in 1912, and later served as New Zealand High Commissioner in London.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Mackenzie was born in Edinburgh in 1853. His family emigrated to New Zealand in 1858 when he was four and Mackenzie was educated at Green Island School and at the Stone School, both in Dunedin. After ending his education in his early teens he worked for several years in commercial firms before, aged 20, following his brother James into surveying. He gained employment at the Department of Lands and Survey and worked in several locations including the Hutt Valley, Rangitikei and Manawatu before finally returning to his home area in Dunedin.

In 1877 he purchased a general storekeeping business in Balclutha. He managed the business well and it developed well before he sold it in 1886 for a considerable profit. In the Balclutha area he became a well-known man and was accordingly elected a member of the Balclutha Borough Council from 1881 to 1887. During this period he married, on 24 September 1884, to Ida Henrietta Nantes with whom he had five sons and two daughters.

Mackenzie was also a notable explorer. He was a member of expeditions to the Tautuku Forest (1883), the wild country between Milford Sound and Lake Te Anau (1888; discovered the Sutherland Falls), and the Matterhorn Mountains (1888; discovered a pass between Lake Manapouri and Hall Arm). He was the first person to try to map an overland route to Dusky Sound (1894–1896). He crossed the land between Lake Te Anau and Lake Wakatipu in 1907.

===Member of Parliament===



Mackenzie was elected to the New Zealand Parliament for Clutha in 1887. He resigned in 1896 to assess the British markets for New Zealand products and remained in his native land for three years. On his return to New Zealand he was elected to Parliament successively for Waihemo –1902, Waikouaiti 1902–1908, Taieri 1908–1911 and Egmont (in the North Island) 1911–1912, never losing an election he contested. In addition to parliamentary duties Mackenzie was Mayor of Roslyn from 1901 to 1902. Additionally he served for many years on the Otago Education Board, Otago High Schools&#x27; Board and the Otago Hospital Board.

===Minister and Prime Minister===
In January 1909 he was appointed Minister of Industries and Commerce, Tourist and Health Resorts, Scenery Preservation and State Forestry Departments in the government of Sir Joseph Ward with a seat in the Cabinet. In May the same year he also became Minister of Agriculture. In May 1912 Ward resigned as Prime Minister. Mackenzie was one of several names floated as possible successor and after a 10-hour caucus meeting on 22 March, presided over by Ward, Mackenzie won a ballot by the caucus 22 votes to 9 over George Laurenson. He also served as Minister of Lands in his own government.

Mackenzie&#x27;s Ministry was criticised by both the opposition and Liberal dissidents. Liberal MP Roderick McKenzie stated that Mackenzie&#x27;s ministers were political novices who had forsaken their liberal principles and John Millar should have been Ward&#x27;s successor as Prime Minister. The Mackenzie government survived only until July 1912 when he lost a vote of no confidence moved by the opposition. Two of Ward&#x27;s Ministers withdrew their support and several members crossed the floor to defeat the ministry and William Massey&#x27;s Reform Party came to power. Mackenzie then resigned as leader of the Liberals. He did so believing the Liberal Party&#x27;s policies and reforms had become too mainstream and entrenched for them to be abolished.

===Diplomatic career===
The new Prime Minister Massey appointed him to London as High Commissioner of New Zealand to the United Kingdom. He served in this role until 1920 during which time he carried an unexpectedly high workload due to the advent of World War I. He was New Zealand delegate at the peace conferences with Austria, Bulgaria and Turkey in 1919, a member of the Dardanelles Commission and the Imperial War Graves Commission (later the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). Historian David Hall wrote that his work as New Zealand&#x27;s wartime High Commissioner was the most valuable period of his career.

===Later life and death===
In March 1921 he was appointed member of the New Zealand Legislative Council for Otago.

In 1923 he supported Val Sanderson in establishing the Native Bird Protection Society (later the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand) and was the society&#x27;s first president. New Zealand historian Tom Brooking wrote that Mackenzie&#x27;s greatest contribution was his vigorous support of the cause of conservation in New Zealand.

Mackenzie died in Dunedin on 4 February 1930 of heart failure and was buried in the Dunedin Northern Cemetery.

==Honours and recognition==
He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1916 New Year Honours (1 January 1916) and promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) in June 1920.

==Family==
His son Clutha Mackenzie who was blinded at Gallipoli was active in work for the blind. He followed his father in also becoming, briefly, a Member of Parliament. His brother James Mackenzie was Surveyor-General of New Zealand from 1912 to 1914.

<text>is a town located in Anpachi District, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 9,910 in 3,183 households and a population density of 439 persons per km2.The total area of the town is .

==Geography==
Wanouchi is located in the northwestern portion of the Nōbi Plain in southwestern Gifu Prefecture. The &quot;kanji&quot; for Wanouchi (輪之内) literally translates to &quot;within a circle.&quot; This name is derived from the fact that Wanouchi is situated between the Ibi River and the Nagara River. Historically, these two rivers ran together and the area known as Wanouchi today was one of many ring-levees in the middle of the river. Naturally, these levees were prone to frequent flooding and so the waters had to be diverted. Hence, Wanouchi&#x27;s physical environment and history has been greatly shaped by the constant threat of floods. The town has a climate characterized by characterized by hot and humid summers, and mild winters (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;).

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Wanouchi has recently plateaued after a long period of growth.
== History ==
The area around Wanouchi was part of traditional Mino Province. During the Edo period, it was mostly controlled by Ōgaki Domain. In 1754, the Tokugawa shogunate, ordered the powerful Satsuma Domain from Kagoshima to build embankments in order to divert the rivers in the area for flood control and as a measure to drain off Satsuma Domain&#x27;s wealth to reduce its potential as a threat to Tokugawa rule. This was later known as the Hōreki Age River Improvement Incident. The construction of these banks proved extremely dangerous and difficult, hampered both by nature and by obstruction from the Tokugawa shogunate. It is said that a human sacrifice was made in the Wanouchi area during the construction when a local retainer voluntarily gave his life by remaining under the rushing waters in order to keep a foundation pillar from moving until it could be secured from above. As well as aiding in the construction, this sacrifice was also treated as an offering to the gods ensuring the successful completing of the project. Several Satsuma samurai associated with the project committed &quot;seppuku&quot; (ritual suicide). The construction was completed in 1755. More than 80 people died. The graves of 8 of these men are located around Wanouchi, serving as a reminder of the sacrifices made so that people could live in a safer environment. Due to the construction of many banks over the last 200 years, the waters surrounding Wanouchi have become two separate rivers, the Ibi River and Nagara River. The area located between the two rivers is referred to as the &quot;Waju-tei&quot; (輪中堤 or Waju levee). The name Wanouchi originates from this word and means &quot;the town in Waju-tei&quot;.

During the post-Meiji restoration cadastral reforms, the area was organised into Anpachi District, Gifu. In 1954, the three villages Niki, Fukuzuka, and Oyabu were merged to form the town of Wanouchi. In 1976, the Nagara River swelled and flooded Wanouchi&#x27;s neighbouring towns, Anpachi, Gifu and Sunomata, Gifu. However, the people of Wanouchi were protected from the floods because of the strong embankments.

== Economy ==
Wanouchi&#x27;s main areas of employment is in the manufacturing industry. However, many citizens also derive income from agricultural activities.

==Education==
Wanouchi has three public elementary schools and one public middle school operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school.

Kayu no Tsuke

For over 100 years, every January, a ritual has been performed to predict the coming year&#x27;s rice harvest. In the dead of night, farmers gather at four shrines in Wanouchi to witness the ritual. Rice is steamed together with hollow, slender stalks of bamboo about 20 cm. in length. When the rice is ready, a priest slices the bamboo lengthwise. The amount of rice that has been cooked inside the stalk is believed to indicate the abundance of the next year&#x27;s harvest.

<text>The Ghetto Brothers were a gang and music group founded in New York City&#x27;s South Bronx in the late 1960s with the motivation to uplift young Latino and Black men in their community.

==History==
Founded in New York City&#x27;s South Bronx in the late 1960s, the gang eventually spread to much of the Northeastern United States. Like the Young Lords, they were involved in politics, particularly the Puerto Rico independence movement, and were associated with the then-new Puerto Rican Socialist Party. Its members had political motivation to uplift young Latino and Black men in the community.

Under Benjamin Melendez&#x27;s leadership, the Ghetto Brothers represented one end of the spectrum in terms of how they treated the women involved with the gang. Referred to as the Ghetto Sisters—the respectful term contrasted sharply with the names used for the women attached to other New York gangs of the period—the women were generally viewed as organization members and as girlfriends, whereas many other gangs treated women almost entirely as sexual property.

Former Hartford, Connecticut mayor Eddie Perez was a member of the Ghetto Brothers when young. &quot;New York Daily News&quot; columnist Robert Dominguez was the leader of a Ghetto Brothers division in the Bronx when he was a teen. In the Connecticut prison system, during the 1990s, the Ghetto Brothers and the Savage Nomads joined to form Los Solidos (the Solid Ones), which is now one of the most powerful Puerto Rican gangs in the state.

==Origin of the Name==
The name Ghetto Brothers was chosen by Hui Cambrelen one of the original founders along with Ray DelaVega and Benji Melendez.

==Music Group==
Benjamin Melendez, who left the organization in 1976, was also known as a guitarist. He led a band, also known as the Ghetto Brothers, which included his late brother Victor Melendez on bass. They released one album &quot;Ghetto Brothers - Power-Fuerza&quot; in 1971, which had only informal, local distribution. It has since been re-released on CD.

<doc id="601718" wikidata="Q2916092" url="?curid=601718" title="White Night riots">
<text>The White Night riots were a series of violent events sparked by an announcement of a lenient sentencing of Dan White for the assassinations of George Moscone, the mayor of San Francisco, and of Harvey Milk, a member of the city&#x27;s Board of Supervisors who was one of the first openly gay elected officials in the United States. The events took place on the night of May 21, 1979, in San Francisco. Earlier that day White had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter, the lightest possible conviction for his actions. The lesser conviction outraged the city&#x27;s gay community, setting off the most violent reaction by gay Americans since the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City.

The gay community of San Francisco had a longstanding conflict with the San Francisco Police Department. White&#x27;s status as a former police officer intensified the community&#x27;s anger at the SFPD. Initial demonstrations took place as a peaceful march through the Castro district of San Francisco. After the crowd arrived at the San Francisco City Hall, violence began. The events caused hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of property damage to City Hall and the surrounding area, as well as injuries to police officers and rioters.

Several hours after the riot had been broken up, police made a retaliatory raid on a gay bar in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro District. Many patrons were beaten by police in riot gear. Two dozen arrests were made during the course of the raid, and several people later sued the SFPD.

In the following days, gay leaders refused to apologize for the events of that night. This led to increased political power in the gay community, which culminated in the election of Mayor Dianne Feinstein to a full term the following November. In response to a campaign promise, Feinstein appointed a pro-gay Chief of Police, which increased recruitment of gay people in the police force and eased tensions.

==Background==

===Gay history of San Francisco===
The American settlers who moved west toward California in the 18th and 19th centuries were largely male prospectors and miners. Events such as the California Gold Rush created a broadly male society in that region. Romantic friendships were common, and often tolerated. As San Francisco was settled the ratio of men to women remained disproportionately high, resulting in the growth of a culture that was more open-minded towards homosexuality. The city&#x27;s notorious brothel district – named the Barbary Coast – earned the city a reputation as a lawless and amoral society leading to San Francisco becoming known as &quot;Sodom by the Sea.&quot;

The end of Prohibition prompted the opening of several gay bars along North Beach. The most notable of these were the Black Cat where female impersonation shows became the main draw, and a lesbian bar known as Mona&#x27;s.

During World War II, San Francisco became a major debarkation point for servicemen stationed in the Pacific Theater. The U.S. military, which was concerned about male homosexuality, had a policy of dismissing servicemen caught in known gay establishments with blue discharges. As many of these men faced ostracism from their communities and families, they chose to remain in the city. The number of men that remained was a significant factor in the creation of a homosexual community in San Francisco.

===Gay activism in San Francisco===
In 1951, the California Supreme Court affirmed in &quot;Stoumen v. Reilly&quot; the right of homosexuals to assemble peacefully. To assist homosexuals with legal problems, in 1951 labor activist Harry Hay started the Mattachine Foundation from his living room in Los Angeles. Two years later, the Mattachine Society had expanded to several cities through the organizational skills of Chuck Rowland and under the leadership of less radical leaders Ken Burns in Los Angeles, Hal Call in San Francisco, and Curtis Dewees, Joe McCarthy, and Tony Segura in New York, and Prescott Townsend of Boston. A few years later, Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin started the Daughters of Bilitis with six other women in San Francisco, initially to have a place to socialize without fear of harassment or arrest. Within a few years, both organizations learned of each other and grew to have similar goals: helping assimilate homosexuals into general society, working for legal reform to repeal sodomy laws, and assisting those who were arrested. Both groups were headquartered in San Francisco by 1957, where &quot;The Ladder&quot; was edited by Lyon and Martin while &quot;The Mattachine Review&quot; was edited by Hal Call. Both publications were printed by Call&#x27;s Pan Graphic Press.

Police continued to arrest homosexuals in large numbers, routinely bringing paddy wagons to gay bars and arresting their patrons. Charges were usually dismissed, but those arrested often lost their anonymity when newspapers printed their names, addresses and places of employment. Officers also notified the employer and family of the accused, causing serious damage to their reputations.

In 1964, a New Year&#x27;s Eve benefit event was held for the Council on Religion and the Homosexual. Police stood outside with large floodlights, and in an effort to intimidate took photographs of anyone entering the building. Later, several officers demanded that they be allowed inside. Three lawyers explained to them that under California law, the event was a private party and they could not enter unless they bought tickets. The lawyers were then arrested. Several ministers who were in attendance held a press conference the next morning, likening the SFPD to the Gestapo. Even the Catholic archbishop strongly condemned the actions of the police. In an attempt to reduce such harassment two officers were tasked with improving the police department&#x27;s relationship with the gay community.

The Mattachine Society and Daughters of Bilitis promoted non-confrontational education for homosexuals and heterosexuals, hoping to prove that homosexuals were respectable and normal. Living beyond the mostly white, middle class scope of these groups was an active community of cross-dressers, hustlers, and &quot;street queens&quot; who worked primarily in the Tenderloin district of the city. After being denied service at Gene Compton&#x27;s Cafeteria, a few activists picketed the restaurant in 1966. A few days later, early in the morning, the police arrived to arrest patrons in drag. A riot ensued when a drag queen threw the contents of a cup of coffee in the face of a police officer in response to the officer&#x27;s grabbing of her arm. The cafe&#x27;s plate glass windows were shattered in the melée, and then again a few days later after they had been replaced. Although three years later the Stonewall Riots would have a more significant impact, the Compton&#x27;s Cafeteria riots were among the first in American history where homosexuals and the newly forming transgender community fought against the authorities.

===Political history===
San Francisco continued to grow as a haven for homosexuals. North Beach and Polk Street had been quiet neighborhoods each with a large homosexual population, but in the 1960s the growth of the Castro District outpaced either of them. Thousands of gay men migrated to San Francisco, turning the quiet Irish working-class neighborhood around Castro Street into a bustling center of activity. Meanwhile, many lesbians moved their homes and businesses to nearby Valencia Street in the Mission District. New Yorker Harvey Milk resettled on Castro Street in 1972, and opened Castro Camera the following year. Dissatisfied with the level of bureaucratic apathy and indifference toward the gay community, Milk decided to run for city supervisor. Through his multiple campaigns, culminating in his 1977 election, he became the political voice for the gay community, promoting himself as the &quot;Mayor of Castro Street.&quot; By 1977, 25 percent of the population of San Francisco was reported to be gay.

On Labor Day of 1974, tensions between the gay community and the SFPD came to a head when a man was beaten and arrested while walking down Castro Street. Police reinforcements suddenly appeared on the street, their badge numbers hidden, and beat dozens of gay men. Of these, 14 were arrested and charged with obstructing a sidewalk. Harvey Milk dubbed them the &quot;Castro 14&quot;, and a $1.375 million lawsuit was filed against the police.

In 1975, after George Moscone had been elected Mayor, he appointed Charles Gain as his Chief of Police. Gain, whose conciliatory position towards African Americans had branded him as one of the most liberal law enforcement officers in the country, soon earned the ire of the police force. Gain implemented policies that proved unpopular with his staff, such as painting police cars powder blue, and barring officers from drinking on the job. His lenient policies towards gays also angered the police force. When asked what he would do if a gay police officer came out, Gain replied &quot;I certainly think that a gay policeman could be up front about it under me. If I had a gay policeman who came out, I would support him 100 percent.&quot; This statement sent shock waves through the police department, and made national headlines. Made during the first week of Gain&#x27;s tenure, the remark also made Mayor Moscone extremely unpopular with the police. The two were so intensely disliked by the police that in 1977 rumors circulated about a plan by right-wing police officers to assassinate Gain, and a year later similar plans formed targeting Mayor Moscone. Upon being informed of this threat, Moscone hired a bodyguard.

===Assassination of Harvey Milk===

Dissatisfied with city politics, and in financial difficulty due to his failing restaurant business and low annual salary of $9,600, former police officer and Supervisor Dan White resigned from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on November 10, 1978. However, after a meeting with the Police Officers&#x27; association and the Board of Realtors, White announced that he wanted his seat back. Liberal Supervisors saw this as an opportunity to end the 6-5 split on the Board that blocked progressive initiatives they wanted to introduce. After intense lobbying by Supervisors Milk and Silver, as well as State Assemblyman Willie Brown, Moscone announced on November 26, 1978, that he would not be reappointing Dan White to the seat he had vacated.

The next morning White went to City Hall armed with his police .38 Smith &amp; Wesson revolver and 10 extra cartridges in his coat pocket. To avoid the metal detector he entered the building through a basement window, and proceeded to the office of Mayor George Moscone. Following a brief argument, White shot the Mayor in the shoulder and chest, and then twice in the head.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt11/28/78&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; White then walked to his former office, reloading his gun, and asked Milk to join him. White then shot Milk in the wrist, shoulder and chest, and then twice in the head. Supervisor Dianne Feinstein heard the gunshots and called the police, who found Milk on his stomach, bleeding out from his head wounds.

===Dan White verdict===
White was charged with first-degree murder with &quot;special circumstances&quot;, which would have permitted the death penalty under the terms of 1978 California Proposition 7. The circumstances alleged in this case were that Mayor Moscone had been killed in order to block the appointment of someone to fill the City Supervisor seat from which Dan White had resigned, and also that multiple people were killed.

White&#x27;s sentence was reduced due in part to the so-called Twinkie defense. White&#x27;s defense was that he suffered diminished capacity as a result of his depression, a symptom of which was a change in diet from healthy food to Twinkies and other sugary foods. Contrary to contemporary reports, White&#x27;s attorneys did not argue that the Twinkies were the cause of White&#x27;s actions, but that their consumption was symptomatic of his underlying depression. The product itself was only mentioned in passing during the trial.

The jury heard a tape recording of White&#x27;s confession, which consisted of highly emotional ranting about the pressure he was under, and members of the jury wept in sympathy for the defendant.
White represented the &quot;old guard&quot; of San Francisco, who were wary of the influx of minority groups into the city and represented a more conservative, traditional view that the more liberal forces in the city, like Moscone and Milk, were perceived to be eroding. Members of the San Francisco Police and Fire Departments raised more than $100,000 to defend White and some wore shirts reading &quot;Free Dan White.&quot;

On May 21, 1979, White was found guilty of the voluntary manslaughter of Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Milk. He was sentenced to seven years and eight months in Soledad prison. With good behavior he had the chance to be released after serving two-thirds of his sentence, about five years. Upon hearing the verdict, District Attorney Joseph Freitas, Jr., said &quot;It was a wrong decision. The jury was overwhelmed by emotions and did not sufficiently analyze the evidence that this was deliberate, calculated murder.&quot; In defense of his client, White&#x27;s attorney Douglas Schmidt stated that White &quot;is filled with remorse and I think he&#x27;s in a very bad condition.&quot;

White would later confirm that the killings were premeditated. In 1984, he told former police Inspector Frank Falzon that not only had he planned to kill Moscone and Milk, but also had plans to kill Assemblyman Willie Brown and Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver. He believed that the four politicians were attempting to block his reinstatement as Supervisor.
 Falzon quoted White as having said, &quot;I was on a mission. I wanted four of them. Carol Ruth Silver, she was the biggest snake ... and Willie Brown, he was masterminding the whole thing.&quot;

==Riots==

===March through the Castro===
When told of the verdict, Milk&#x27;s friend and activist Cleve Jones addressed an audience of about 500 people that had gathered on Castro Street, telling them of the verdict. With shouts of &quot;Out of the bars and into the streets&quot; Jones led a crowd down Castro Street, its numbers bolstered by people emerging from each bar. The crowd circled around and marched through the Castro again, by now numbering about 1,500 people.

In a 1984 interview, Jones gave a voice to the feeling in the crowd as they began to group together on Castro Street after news of the verdict spread, stating, &quot;The rage in people&#x27;s face—I saw people I&#x27;d known for years, and they were so furious. That to me was the scariest thing. All these people I&#x27;d know from the neighborhood, boys from the corner, these people I&#x27;d ridden the bus with, just out there, screaming for blood.&quot;

===Violence at City Hall===

By the time the crowd reached City Hall its numbers had increased to over 5,000. Protesters shouted slogans such as &quot;Kill Dan White!&quot; and &quot;Dump Dianne!&quot;, a reference to Mayor Dianne Feinstein. The handful of police officers on duty at the scene were uncertain about how to deal with the situation, and the Police Department, which was unaccustomed to an angry gay crowd, was similarly uncertain of how to proceed. The protesters were convinced that the police and prosecution had conspired to avoid a severe sentence for White, although Prosecutor Thomas Norman denied this repeatedly until his death.

Members of the crowd tore gilded ornamental work from the building&#x27;s wrought iron doors and then used it to break first floor windows. Several of Harvey Milk&#x27;s friends monitored and attempted to hold back the crowd, including Milk&#x27;s long term partner Scott Smith. A formation of police appeared on the north side of the Civic Center Plaza, and those attempting to hold back the mob sat down, grateful for the reinforcements. The officers however did not restrain themselves to holding back the crowd, and instead attacked them with night sticks.

One young man used a metal signpost to smash the window of a police car, and two of his companions threw burning toilet paper on the upholstery, setting it on fire. A dozen more police cars would be destroyed in a similar fashion by these three young men, while others burned eight more non-police vehicles. The photo on the front cover of the Dead Kennedys 1980 album &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot;, which shows several police cars on fire, was taken that night. Several crowd members threw tear gas, which they had stolen from police vehicles. Riots began to break out, with one mob disrupting traffic. Electric trollies were disabled when their overhead wires were pulled down, and violence broke out against the police officers, who were outnumbered. Police Chief Charles Gain, standing inside City Hall, ordered officers not to attack and to simply stand their ground.

Mayor Feinstein and Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver addressed the demonstrators in an attempt to defuse the situation. Mayor Feinstein said that she had received news of the verdict &quot;with disbelief&quot;, and Supervisor Silver stated, &quot;Dan White has gotten away with murder. It&#x27;s as simple as that.&quot; Silver was injured when struck by a flying object. More than 140 protesters were also injured.

===Police retaliation===
After nearly three hours of shouts from the angry crowd, officers moved in to quell the riot. Police reportedly covered their badges with black tape—preventing any identification—and attacked rioters. Dozens of police officers swept into the crowd, using tear gas to force protesters away from the building. Police were surprised at the resistance they faced from the protesters, who attempted to push them back using tree branches, chrome torn off city buses, and asphalt ripped from the street, as weapons. As one man ignited the last police car he shouted to a reporter &quot;Make sure you put in the paper that I ate too many Twinkies.&quot; Sixty officers were injured, and about two dozen arrests were made.

The second stage of the violence was a police raid/riot hours later in the predominantly gay Castro neighborhood, which vandalized the Elephant Walk bar and injured many of its occupants. After order was restored at City Hall, SFPD cars carrying dozens of officers headed into the Castro District. Officers entered a gay bar called the Elephant Walk, despite their orders not to do so. They shouted &quot;dirty cocksuckers&quot; and &quot;sick faggots&quot;, shattered the large plate glass windows of the bar, and attacked patrons. After 15 minutes police withdrew from the bar and joined other officers who were indiscriminately attacking gays on the street. The incident lasted nearly two hours.

When Police Chief Charles Gain heard about the unauthorized Elephant Walk raid, he immediately went to the location and ordered his men to leave. Later that night, freelance reporter Michael Weiss saw a group of police officers celebrating at a downtown bar. &quot;We were at City Hall the day [the killings] happened and we were smiling then,&quot; one officer explained. &quot;We were there tonight and we&#x27;re still smiling.&quot;

At least 61 police officers and an estimated 100 members of the public were hospitalized in the course of the riot. A civil grand jury convened to find out who ordered the attack, but it ended inconclusively with a settlement covering personal injury claims and damages.

===Aftermath===
The next morning gay leaders convened in a committee room in the Civic Center. Supervisor Harry Britt, who had replaced Milk, along with members of the Harvey Milk Democratic Club, made it clear that nobody was to apologize for the riots. Britt informed a press conference, &quot;Harvey Milk&#x27;s people do not have anything to apologize for. Now the society is going to have to deal with us not as nice little fairies who have hairdressing salons, but as people capable of violence. We&#x27;re not going to put up with Dan Whites anymore.&quot; Reporters were surprised that a public official would condone the violent acts of the previous night, expecting an apology from Britt. Subsequent attempts to find a gay leader who would give an apologetic statement proved unsuccessful.

That evening, May 22, would have been the 49th birthday of Harvey Milk. City officials had considered revoking the permit for a rally planned for that night, but decided against it for fear of sparking more violence. Officials stated that the rally could channel the community&#x27;s anger into something positive. Police from San Francisco and its neighboring towns were placed on alert by Mayor Feinstein, and Cleve Jones coordinated contingency plans with the police, and trained 300 monitors to keep an eye on the crowd. Approximately 20,000 people gathered on Castro and Market streets, where the mood was &quot;angry, but subdued.&quot; Officers monitored the crowd from a distance, however the crowd engaged in a peaceful celebration of Milk&#x27;s life. Attendees danced to popular disco songs, drank beer, and sang a tribute to Milk.

On the same night, for over three hours about a hundred people held a demonstration at Sheridan Square in Manhattan, to protest the verdict. About 20 officers observed the protest, which began at 8 pm, but no arrests were made. A candlelight vigil was planned for two days later, sponsored by the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Rights and the National Gay Task Force.

On October 14, 1979, between 75,000 and 125,000 people marched on Washington for gay rights. Many carried portraits of Milk, and placards honoring his legacy. The rally, something that Milk had intended to organize, was instead a tribute to his life.

Dan White was released from prison on January 14, 1984 after serving five years of a seven-year, eight-month sentence. On the evening following his release, 9,000 people marched down Castro street and burned his effigy. State authorities reportedly feared an assassination attempt, and in response Scott Smith urged people not to retaliate with violence. He stated, &quot;Harvey was against the death penalty. He was a nonviolent person.&quot;

White committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning on October 21, 1985. He connected a rubber hose to his car&#x27;s exhaust system and routed it to the interior of the vehicle, which he let fill with carbon monoxide. Mayor Feinstein said, &quot;This latest tragedy should close a very sad chapter in this city&#x27;s history.&quot; According to Orange County lawyer Jeff Walsworth, White had expressed remorse for the killings in February 1984. White reportedly stated that it would always cause him inner turmoil. Inspector Falzone said the contrary, however, commenting that at no time did White express remorse in any form at the deaths of Moscone and Milk.

==Analysis==

===Causes===
The community had a long history of conflict with the San Francisco Police Department. Following World War II, gay bars were subject to frequent raids and attempts by the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to revoke their alcohol licenses. They were accused of serving alcohol to homosexuals, a criminal act at the time.

The growing political and economic power of the city&#x27;s gay community conflicted with the established but dwindling numbers of the conservative institutions, such as the police and fire departments. By 1971, police were arresting an average of 2,800 men per year on public sex charges; by contrast, 63 such arrests were made in New York City, although up to a quarter of San Francisco was reported to be gay at the time. Many charges were dismissed due to entrapment, but several men were given harsh sentences. In March, 1979, an attack on a lesbian bar by off-duty police officers made the national news and highlighted the tension between the LGBT community and police. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; cited the incident when it reported a week before the White Night riots that anti-homosexual violence had &quot;increased to a level unparalleled in San Francisco&#x27;s recent history&quot;, including what the gay community perceived as &quot;increasing harassment and abuse directed toward homosexuals by the police themselves,&quot; as well as indifference by city officials.

When Dan White was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter, his successful diminished capacity defense enraged the gay community. That the police and fire departments had raised money for his defense gave their anger a focus, turning it against the city government and especially the SFPD.

===Effects on San Francisco politics===
With the 1979 municipal elections occurring only months after the riot, prominent gay leaders feared a backlash at the polls. The elections continued without incident, and the gay community fared better than expected, wielding unprecedented influence. Although the virtually unknown gay Mayoral candidate David Scott finished third in the election, his showing was strong enough to force Mayor Feinstein into a runoff election against conservative City Supervisor Quentin Kopp. Feinstein&#x27;s promises to appoint more gay people to public office, and her heavy campaigning in the Castro, ensured that she won enough support from the gay community to give her a full term as Mayor.

One of Mayor Feinstein&#x27;s first actions upon being elected was to announce the appointment of Cornelius Murphy as the new Chief of Police. Murphy declared that police cars would no longer be colored powder blue, but instead would be repainted as &quot;macho black-and-whites.&quot; This pleased the rank and file, and restored confidence in police leadership. Murphy also vowed to maintain the progressive policy towards gays that his predecessor had implemented. By 1980, one in seven new police recruits was either gay or lesbian. In one of his last public appearances, outgoing Police Chief Charles Gain stated that he fully expected to see the day when San Francisco would have both a gay mayor and Chief of Police. By October 1985, an organization for gay law enforcement personnel in California, the Golden State Peace Officers Association, had incorporated as a non-profit organization. It was founded by Art Roth, an Oakland police officer who was present on the night of the riots.

Thirty years after the announcement of Dan White&#x27;s guilty verdict, the Supreme Court of California prepared their decision on &quot;Strauss v. Horton&quot;. The case was an attempt to overturn Proposition 8, which had added the statement &quot;Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California&quot; to Article I, section 7.5 of the California State Constitution. This ballot initiative, which was approved in 2008, eliminated the right of same-sex couples to marry in the state.

In late May 2009, while the Court was preparing its announcement, rumors surfaced on the Internet that San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom had asked the court not to announce the decision on May 21. They suggested that he made this request so that the announcement would not coincide with the 30th anniversary of the White Night riots. On May 26, the court upheld the validity of Proposition 8, but ruled that the 18,000 marriages that had already been performed would remain valid. In 2013, same-sex marriage again became legal when that voter initiative was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. 
Supreme Court in &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot;.

===Effects on the AIDS movement===

Cleve Jones played a major role in the investigation of the riots, and had since become a prominent activist. He dropped out of school to work as a legislative consultant to California State Assembly Speakers Leo McCarthy and Willie Brown. He also spent time organizing political campaigns. In 1981, while working as a consultant to the California State Assembly Health Committee, he became aware of gay men in San Francisco contracting unusual diseases, such as Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma. The gay community was eventually seriously affected by the AIDS epidemic, and Jones became a key AIDS activist. Jones co-founded the Kaposi&#x27;s Sarcoma Research &amp; Education Foundation, which in 1982 became the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. On November 27, 1985, at a candlelight vigil on the anniversary of the Moscone-Milk assassinations, Jones learned that 1,000 people had died of AIDS. He proposed the creation of a quilt, in remembrance of those who had died. In 1987, Jones, by then HIV-positive himself, launched the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt. As of 2009, the quilt consists of over 44,000 individual panels. In a 2004 interview, Jones said &quot;I thought, what a perfect symbol; what a warm, comforting, middle-class, middle-American, traditional-family-values symbol to attach to this disease that&#x27;s killing homosexuals and IV drug users and Haitian immigrants, and maybe, just maybe, we could apply those traditional family values to my family.&quot;

<doc id="601744" wikidata="Q2474626" url="?curid=601744" title="Jumbunna, Victoria">
<text>Jumbunna is a town in South Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. The name is taken from the eastern Kulin language of the Bunnerong tribe and means &quot;a place to meet and talk&quot;.

Today the community of Jumbunna consists of 13 houses and about 30 residents in the township and 29 houses and 50 residents in the surrounding rural area.

Farming (mainly in fat lamb, beef and dairy industries) continues and is now complemented by a diverse range of small businesses.

== History ==
Jumbunna was once a thriving coal mining township. Land was opened up for selection in 1878. The Jumbunna Coal Company was registered in 1890, after T.W. Horsley discovered a seam in the area. The Company began operations in 1894.

A Jumbunna Post Office opened on 1 May 1890. This was renamed Glen Alvie in 1893 when the railway arrived and a new Jumbunna office was opened near the station. This office closed in 1976.

In its hey-day in 1901 the town boasted 153 houses and a population of approximately 800, many of whom lived in tents. The first house in Jumbunna (&quot;Cora Lynn&quot;) was built in 1880 by John Glew.

The shopping precinct at that time had amongst its businesses three grocers, two butchers, two bakers, two drapers, two boot repairers, one fancy goods shop, one barber, one wine saloon, one hotel, one iron mongery, three blacksmiths and several boarding houses, as well as a coffee salon. The Jumbunna General Store opened in 1893 and closed in 1976. (The Store building now has Category 1 heritage listing with the South Gippsland Shire Council.) There was also a school, at first using the Jumbunna Hall, which started in 1894. It continued in a new building from 1900 to 1977. Portable buildings were then used until 1986 after the sale of the school building.

The Korumburra-Jumbunna Railway was constructed in 1893, was extended to Outtrim in 1896 and closed in 1953.

Electricity was introduced to the town in 1930.

After the miners&#x27; strike of 1903 to 1904, the town began to decline and many houses were shifted by bullock dray to Wonthaggi.

The records show that the single stream mine continued producing until 1939. (From 1931-1939 it was operated by locals, including the Durkin family.) The top seam was re-opened in 1947 and worked by the Axford Leighton Syndicate until 1962.

During the entire operation of the Jumbunna mine 1,364,376 tons of coal were produced.

The coal mine,
railway embankment, and
railway line viaduct
are listed in the Victorian Heritage Inventory.

<text>was a village located in Ōno District, Gifu Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the village had an estimated population of 1,359 and a population density of 4.20 persons per km2. The total area was 323.28 km2.

On February 1, 2005, Shōkawa, along with the town of Kuguno, and the villages of Asahi, Kiyomi, Miya, Nyūkawa and Takane (all from Ōno District), the town of Kokufu, and the village of Kamitakara (both from Yoshiki District), was merged into the expanded city of Takayama and no longer exists as an independent municipality.

In Fall, the village puts on Japan&#x27;s longest lion dance festival (Renjishi - 連獅子).

During the building of the Miboro dam, a portion of the village was submerged. One of the village&#x27;s oldest cherry trees, which was threatened by the dam project, was transplanted to an area alongside the dam made lake.

Though it is merely a pit stop on the way to Shirakawa or Takayama, it boasts an onsen.

In 1999, a prehistoric reptile, &quot;Shokawa ikoi&quot;, was discovered and named after the town.

==Climate==

Shōkawa, including parts of Takasu-cho have a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;), with four distinct seasons.

Some of the coldest settlements of mainland Japan (Honshu) can be found on this plateau, with a climate similar to that of Hokkaidō, boasting an average of 10 metres snowfall throughout the winter season and giving rise to a selection of ski resorts and winter activities.

<doc id="601774" wikidata="Q174085" url="?curid=601774" title="Willem Janszoon">
<text>Willem Janszoon (; ) was a Dutch navigator and colonial governor. He served in the Dutch East Indies in the periods 1603–1611 and 1612–1616, including as governor of Fort Henricus on the island of Solor. During his voyage of 1605–1606, Janszoon and his crew became the first Europeans known to have seen and landed on the coast of Australia.

His name is sometimes abbreviated to Willem Jansz. and sometimes to Willem Jansz, as was customary at his time, but &quot;always pronounced in full and generally still is in the Netherlands where this bit of common knowledge is taught at school.&quot; However, the abbreviation &quot;Jansz&quot; is not the same as the now more predominant unabbreviated but identical &quot;Jansz&quot; that is a petrified form of &quot;Janszoon&quot;.

==Early life==
Willem Janszoon (Willem Jansz) was born around 1570 as the son of Jan (, but nothing more is known of his early life or of his parents.

Janszoon is first recorded as having entered into the service of the , one of the predecessors of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), in 1598 as a mate aboard &quot;Hollandia&quot;, part of the second fleet under Jacob Corneliszoon van Neck, dispatched by the Dutch to the Dutch East Indies. Around 1600 he became the father of Jan Willemsz before setting sail again on 5 May 1601, for the East Indies as master of &quot;Lam&quot;, one of three ships in the fleet of Joris van Spilbergen.

Janszoon sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on 18 December 1603, as captain of (or &quot;Duijfken&quot;, meaning &#x27;Little Dove&#x27;), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of Steven van der Hagen. When the other ships left Java, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in &quot;the great land of New Guinea and other East and Southlands&quot;.

==Exploration and discovery==
===First voyage to Australia===

On 18 November 1605, &quot;Duyfken&quot; sailed from Bantam to the coast of western New Guinea. After that, Janszoon crossed the eastern end of the Arafura Sea into the Gulf of Carpentaria, without being aware of the existence of Torres Strait. &quot;Duyfken&quot; was actually in Torres Strait in February 1606, a few months before Spanish explorer Luís Vaz de Torres sailed through it. On 26 February 1606, Janszoon made landfall at the Pennefather River on the western shore of Cape York in Queensland, near what is now the town of Weipa. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea.

Finding the land swampy and the people inhospitable (ten of his men were killed on various shore expeditions), Janszoon decided to return at a place he named (, the name persist as Cape Keer Weer), south of Albatross Bay, and arrived back at Bantam in June 1606. He called the land he had discovered , or , after the Dutch province of Zeeland, but the name was not adopted, and was later used by Dutch cartographers for New Zealand.

In 1607, Admiral Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge sent Janszoon to Ambon and Banda. In 1611, Janszoon returned to the Netherlands, believing that the south coast of New Guinea was joined to the land along which he had sailed, and Dutch maps reproduced that error for many years. Though there have been suggestions that earlier navigators from China, France, or Portugal may have discovered parts of Australia earlier, &quot;Duyfken&quot; is the first Eurasian vessel provably known to have done so.

===Second voyage to Australia===
Janszoon reported that on 31 July 1618 he had landed on an island at 22° South with a length of 22 miles and 240 miles south-southeast of the Sunda Strait. This is generally interpreted as a description of the peninsula from Point Cloates () to North West Cape () on the Western Australian coast, which Janszoon presumed was an island without fully circumnavigating it.

==Political==
Around 1617–1618, he was back in the Netherlands and was appointed as a member of the Council of the Indies. He served as admiral of the Dutch Defence fleet. Janszoon was awarded a gold chain worth 1,000 guilders in 1619 for his part in capturing four ships of the British East India Company near Tiku on West Sumatra, which had aided the Javanese in their defence of the town of Jakarta against the Dutch. In 1620, he was one of the negotiators with the English. In a combined fleet, they sailed to Manila to prevent Chinese merchants dealing with the Spanish. Janszoon became vice-admiral, and the year later admiral. Near the end of his life, Janszoon served as governor of Banda (16231627). He returned to Batavia in June 1627 and soon afterwards, as admiral of a fleet of eight vessels, went on a diplomatic mission to India. On 4 December 1628, he sailed for Holland and on 16 July 1629, reported on the state of the Indies at The Hague. He was now probably about sixty years old and ready to retire from his strenuous and successful career in the service of his country. Nothing is known of his last days, but he is thought to have died in 1630.

==Records==
The original journal and log made during Janszoon’s 1606 voyage have been lost. The Duyfken chart, which shows the location of the first landfall in Australia by &quot;Duyfken&quot;, had a better fate. It was still in existence in Amsterdam when Hessel Gerritszoon made his map of the Pacific in 1622, and placed &quot;Duyfken&quot; geography upon it, thus providing us with the first map to contain any part of Australia. The chart was still in existence around 1670, when a copy was made. This eventually went to the Imperial Library in Vienna and remained forgotten for two hundred years. The map is part of the &quot;Atlas Blaeu Van der Hem&quot;, brought to Vienna in 1730 by Prince Eugene of Savoy. The information from his charts was included in the marble and copper maps of the on the floor of The Citizens&#x27; Hall of the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.

<doc id="601779" wikidata="Q592146" url="?curid=601779" title="Yellow-fronted tinkerbird">
<text>The yellow-fronted tinkerbird (Pogoniulus chrysoconus) is a small bird in the family Lybiidae formerly known as yellow-fronted tinker barbet. It is sometimes considered conspecific with its southern counterpart, the red-fronted tinkerbird, &quot;Pogoniulus pusillus&quot;. Barbets are near passerine birds with bristles around the base of the bill and a world-wide tropical distribution.

==Subspecies==
The subspecies vary with respect to size and colour tone of the plumage streaks. They include:
* &quot;P. c. chrysoconus&quot; 
* &quot;P. c. extoni&quot; — southern Africa
* &quot;P. c. xanthostictus&quot; 
If &quot;P. c. extoni&quot; is restricted to the southernmost population occurring in southeastern Botswana, northern South Africa and Eswatini, the following two subspecies are also recognized:
* &quot;P. c. rhodesiae&quot; — Angola, Zambia, northeastern Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe
* &quot;P. c. dryas&quot; — eastern to northern Mozambique and northwards

==Range and habitat==
The yellow-fronted tinkerbird is a widespread and frequently common resident breeder in much of Africa south of the Sahara Desert. It is associated with mesic, open to closed broadleaved or mixed woodlands and scrub. It is found in riparian vegetation but occurs only sparsely in dry savanna and teak woodlands.

==Description==
The yellow-fronted tinkerbird is approximately in length. It is plump, with a short neck, large head, and short tail. The adult has black upperparts heavily streaked with yellow and white. Its head has a strong black and white pattern, with a yellow forecrown spot. The underparts and rump are lemon yellow. Both sexes are similar in appearance, but young birds have a differentiating dark crown that lacks the distinct yellow spot.

==Breeding==

The species nests in cavities excavated in dead limbs of trees, some 2 to 5 meters above the ground. A clutch of 2 to 3 matt white eggs is laid on a base of wood chips at the bottom of the nesting chamber. The nestlings call persistently, and are reared on fruit and insects by both parents. Nests usually do not survive a season and maybe usurped by larger species of barbet.

==Vocalizations==
At about 100 repetitions per minute, the yellow-fronted tinkerbird&#x27;s call is a fast &quot;tink-tink-tink-tink&quot;. Many barbets perch prominently, but, unlike their larger relatives, the smaller tinkerbirds sing from cover and are more frequently heard than seen.

==Diet==
The yellow-fronted tinkerbird eats insects and fruit. Mistletoe fruits (&quot;Tapinanthus&quot; and &quot;Viscum&quot; spp.) are swallowed whole. The sticky seeds are regurgitated and wiped off on nearby branches. Across their distribution range, yellow-fronted tinkerbirds are the most important disperser of mistletoes.

<doc id="601792" wikidata="Q2674257" url="?curid=601792" title="White rice">
<text>White rice is milled rice that has had its husk, bran, and germ removed. This alters the flavor, texture and appearance of the rice and helps prevent spoilage, extend its storage life, and makes it easier to digest. After milling (hulling), the rice is polished, resulting in a seed with a bright, white, shiny appearance.

The milling and polishing processes both remove nutrients. An unbalanced diet based on unenriched white rice leaves many people vulnerable to the neurological disease beriberi, due to a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). White rice is often enriched with some of the nutrients stripped from it during its processing. Enrichment of white rice with B1, B3, and iron is required by law in the United States when distributed by government programs to schools, nonprofits, or foreign countries. As with all natural foods, the precise nutritional composition of rice varies slightly depending on the variety, soil conditions, environmental conditions and types of fertilizers.

Adopted over brown rice in the second half of the 19th century because it was favored by traders, white rice has led to a beriberi epidemic in Asia.

At various times, starting in the 19th century, brown rice and other grains such as wild rice have been advocated as healthier alternatives. The bran in brown rice contains significant dietary fiber and the germ contains many vitamins and minerals.

Typically, 100 grams of uncooked rice produces around 240 to 260 grams of cooked grains, the difference in weight being due to absorbed cooking water.

==Milling rice==

Before mechanical milling, rice was milled by a hand pounding technique with large mortar and pestle type devices. Some versions of this improved uniformity of the product, but with mechanical milling much larger quantities were able to be produced. In the late 19th century, different machines were produced like the Huller &amp; Sheller Mills (1870) and the Engelberg Milling Machine (1890). By 1955, new machinery had been developed in Japan that had significantly improved the quality and output capacity.

== Nutritional content ==
While brown rice and white rice have similar amounts of calories and carbohydrates, brown rice is a far richer source of all nutrients when compared to unenriched white rice. Brown rice is whole rice from which only the husk (the outermost layer) is removed. To produce white rice, the bran layer and the germ are removed, leaving mostly the starchy endosperm. This process causes the reduction or complete depletion of several vitamins and dietary minerals. Missing nutrients, such as vitamins B1 and B3, and iron, are sometimes added back into the white rice, a process called enrichment. Even with the reduction of nutrients, unenriched white rice is still a good source of manganese and contains moderate amounts of other nutrients such as pantothenic acid and selenium.

<text>Impression management is a conscious or subconscious process in which people attempt to influence the perceptions of other people about a person, object or event by regulating and controlling information in social interaction. It was first conceptualized by Erving Goffman in 1956 in &quot;The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life,&quot; and then was expanded upon in 1967.

Impression management behaviors include accounts (providing &quot;explanations for a negative event to escape disapproval&quot;), excuses (denying &quot;responsibility for negative outcomes&quot;), and opinion conformity (&quot;speak(ing) or behav(ing) in ways consistent with the target&quot;), along with many others. By utilizing such behaviors, those who partake in impression management are able to control others&#x27; perception of them or events pertaining to them. Impression management is possible in nearly any situation, such as in sports (wearing flashy clothes or trying to impress fans with their skills), or on social media (only sharing positive posts). Impression management can be used with either benevolent or malicious intent.

Impression management is usually used synonymously with self-presentation, in which a person tries to influence the perception of their image. The notion of impression management was first applied to face-to-face communication, but then was expanded to apply to computer-mediated communication. The concept of impression management is applicable to academic fields of study such as psychology and sociology as well as practical fields such as corporate communication and media.

== Background ==
The foundation and the defining principles of impression management were created by Erving Goffman in &quot;The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life&quot;. Impression management theory states that one tries to alter one&#x27;s perception according to one&#x27;s goals. In other words, the theory is about how individuals wish to present themselves, but in a way that satisfies their needs and goals. Goffman &quot;proposed to focus on how people in daily work situations present themselves and, in so doing, what they are doing to others&quot;, and he was &quot;particularly interested in how a person guides and controls how others form an impression of them and what a person may or may not do while performing before them&quot;.

== Theory ==

=== Motives ===
A range of factors that govern impression management can be identified. It can be stated that impression management becomes necessary whenever there exists a kind of social situation, whether real or imaginary. Logically, the awareness of being a potential subject of monitoring is also crucial. Furthermore, the characteristics of a given social situation are important. Specifically, the surrounding cultural norms determine the appropriateness of particular nonverbal behaviours. The actions have to be appropriate to the targets, and within that culture, so that the kind of audience as well as the relation to the audience influences the way impression management is realized. A person&#x27;s goals are another factor governing the ways and strategies of impression management. This refers to the content of an assertion, which also leads to distinct ways of presentation of aspects of the self. The degree of self-efficacy describes whether a person is convinced that it is possible to convey the intended impression.

A new study finds that, all other things being equal, people are more likely to pay attention to faces that have been associated with negative gossip than those with neutral or positive associations.
The study contributes to a body of work showing that far from being objective, human perceptions are shaped by unconscious brain processes that determine what they &quot;choose&quot; to see or ignore—even before they become aware of it. The findings also add to the idea that the brain evolved to be particularly sensitive to &quot;bad guys&quot; or cheaters—fellow humans who undermine social life by deception, theft or other non-cooperative behavior.

There are many methods behind self-presentation, including self disclosure (identifying what makes you &quot;you&quot; to another person), managing appearances (trying to fit in), ingratiation, aligning actions (making one&#x27;s actions seem appealing or understandable), and alter-casting (imposing identities on other people). Maintaining a version of self-presentation that is generally considered to be attractive can help to increase one&#x27;s social capital, and this method is commonly implemented by individuals at networking events. These self-presentation methods can also be used on the corporate level as impression management.

=== Self-presentation ===

Self-presentation is conveying information about oneself – or an image of oneself – to others. There are two types and motivations of self-presentation:
* presentation meant to match one&#x27;s own self-image, and
* presentation meant to match audience expectations and preferences.

Self-presentation is expressive. Individuals construct an image of themselves to claim personal identity, and present themselves in a manner that is consistent with that image. If they feel like it is restricted, they often exhibit reactance or become defiant – try to assert their freedom against those who would seek to curtail self-presentation expressiveness. An example of this dynamic is someone who grew up with extremely strict or controlling parental figures. The child in this situation may feel that their identity and emotions have been suppressed, which may cause them to behave negatively towards others.

* &quot;Boasting&quot; – Millon notes that in self-presentation individuals are challenged to balance boasting against discrediting themselves via excessive self-promotion or being caught and being proven wrong. Individuals often have limited ability to perceive how their efforts impact their acceptance and likeability by others.
* &quot;Flattery&quot; – flattery or praise to increase social attractiveness
* &quot;Intimidation&quot; – aggressively showing anger to get others to hear and obey one&#x27;s demands.

Self-presentation can be either defensive or assertive strategies (also described as protective versus acquisitive). Whereas defensive strategies include behaviours like avoidance of threatening situations or means of self-handicapping, assertive strategies refer to more active behaviour like the verbal idealisation of the self, the use of status symbols or similar practices.

These strategies play important roles in one&#x27;s maintenance of self-esteem. One&#x27;s self-esteem is affected by their evaluation of their own performance and their perception of how others react to their performance. As a result, people actively portray impressions that will elicit self-esteem enhancing reactions from others.

In 2019, as filtered photos are perceived as deceptive by users, PlentyOfFish along with other dating sites have started to ban filtered images.

=== Social interaction ===

Goffman argued in his 1967 book, &quot;Interaction ritual&quot;, that people participate in social interactions by performing a &quot;line&quot;, or &quot;pattern of verbal and nonverbal acts&quot;, which is created and maintained by both the performer and the audience. By enacting a line effectively, the person gains positive social value, which is also called &quot;face&quot;. The success of a social interaction will depend on whether the performer has the ability to maintain face. As a result, a person is required to display a kind of character by becoming &quot;someone who can be relied upon to maintain himself as an interactant, poised for communication, and to act so that others do not endanger themselves by presenting themselves as interactants to him&quot;. Goffman analyses how a human being in &quot;ordinary work situations presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, and the kinds of things he may and may not do while sustaining his performance before them&quot;.

When Goffman turned to focus on people physically presented in a social interaction, the &quot;social dimension of impression management certainly extends beyond the specific place and time of engagement in the organization&quot;. Impression management is &quot;a social activity that has individual and community implications&quot;. We call it &quot;pride&quot; when a person displays a good showing from duty to himself, while we call it &quot;honor&quot; when he &quot;does so because of duty to wider social units, and receives support from these duties in doing so&quot;.

Another approach to moral standards that Goffman pursues is the notion of &quot;rules of conduct&quot;, which &quot;can be partially understood as obligations or moral constraints&quot;. These rules may be substantive (involving laws, morality, and ethics) or ceremonial (involving etiquette). Rules of conduct play an important role when a relationship &quot;is asymmetrical and the expectations of one person toward another are hierarchical.&quot;

=== Dramaturgical analogy ===
Goffman presented impression management dramaturgically, explaining the motivations behind complex human performances within a social setting based on a play metaphor. Goffman&#x27;s work incorporates aspects of a symbolic interactionist perspective, emphasizing a qualitative analysis of the interactive nature of the communication process. Impression management requires the physical presence of others. Performers who seek certain ends in their interest, must &quot;work to adapt their behavior in such a way as to give off the correct impression to a particular audience&quot; and &quot;implicitly ask that the audience take their performance seriously&quot;. Goffman proposed that while among other people individual would always strive to control the impression that others form of him or her so that to achieve individual or social goals.

The actor, shaped by the environment and target audience, sees interaction as a performance. The objective of the performance is to provide the audience with an impression consistent with the desired goals of the actor. Thus, impression management is also highly dependent on the situation. In addition to these goals, individuals differ in responses from the interactive environment, some may be non-responsive to an audience&#x27;s reactions while others actively respond to audience reactions in order to elicit positive results. These differences in response towards the environment and target audience are called self-monitoring. Another factor in impression management is self-verification, the act of conforming the audience to the person&#x27;s self-concept.

The audience can be real or imaginary. IM style norms, part of the mental programming received through socialization, are so fundamental that we usually do not notice our expectations of them. While an actor (speaker) tries to project a desired image, an audience (listener) might attribute a resonant or discordant image. An example is provided by situations in which embarrassment occurs and threatens the image of a participant.

Goffman proposes that performers &quot;can use dramaturgical discipline as a defense to ensure that the &#x27;show&#x27; goes on without interruption.&quot; Goffman contends that dramaturgical discipline includes:
# coping with dramaturgical contingencies;
# demonstrating intellectual and emotional involvement;
# remembering one&#x27;s part and not committing unmeant gestures or faux pas;
# not giving away secrets involuntarily;
# covering up inappropriate behavior on the part of teammates on the spur of the moment;
# offering plausible reasons or deep apologies for disruptive events;
# maintaining self-control (for example, speaking briefly and modestly);
# suppressing emotions to private problems; and
# suppressing spontaneous feelings.

=== Manipulation and ethics ===
In business, &quot;managing impressions&quot; normally &quot;involves someone trying to control the image that a significant stakeholder has of them&quot;. The ethics of impression management has been hotly debated on whether we should see it as an effective self-revelation or as cynical manipulation. Some people insist that impression management can reveal a truer version of the self by adopting the strategy of being transparent. Because transparency &quot;can be provided so easily and because it produces information of value to the audience, it changes the nature of impression management from being cynically manipulative to being a kind of useful adaptation&quot;.

Virtue signalling is used within groups to criticize their own members for valuing outward appearance over substantive action (having a real or permanent, rather than apparent or temporary, existence).

Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or perception of others through abusive, deceptive, or underhanded tactics. By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another&#x27;s expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive. The process of manipulation involves bringing an unknowing victim under the domination of the manipulator, often using deception, and using the victim to serve their own purposes.

Machiavellianism is a term that some social and personality psychologists use to describe a person&#x27;s tendency to be unemotional, and therefore able to detach him or herself from conventional morality and hence to deceive and manipulate others. (See also Machiavellianism in the workplace.)

Lying constitutes a force that is destructive and can manipulate an environment allowing them to be narcissistic human beings. A person&#x27;s mind can be manipulated into believing those antics are true as though it relates to being solely deceptive and unethical. Theories show manipulation can cause a huge effect on the dynamic of one&#x27;s relationship. The emotions of a person can stem from a trait that is mistrustful, triggering one&#x27;s attitude and character to misbehave disapprovingly. Relationships with a positive force can provide a greater exchange whereas with relationships having poor moral values, the chances of the connection will be based on detachment and disengagement. Dark personalities and manipulation are within the same entity. It will intervene between a person&#x27;s attainable goal if their perspective is only focused on self-centeredness. The personality entices a range of erratic behaviors that will corrupt the mind into practicing violent acts resulting in a rage of anger and physical harm.

Public relations Ethics. Professionals both serve the public&#x27;s interest and private interests of businesses, associations, non-profit organizations, and governments. This dual obligation gave rise to heated debates among scholars of the discipline and practitioners over its fundamental values. This conflict represents the main ethical predicament of public relations.[40] In 2000, the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) responded to the controversy by acknowledging in its new code of ethics &quot;advocacy&quot; – for the first time – as a core value of the discipline.[40]

The field of public relations is generally highly un-regulated, but many professionals voluntarily adhere to the code of conduct of one or more professional bodies to avoid exposure for ethical violations.[41] The Chartered Institute of Public Relations, the Public Relations Society of America, and The Institute of Public Relations are a few organizations that publish an ethical code. Still, Edelman&#x27;s 2003 semi-annual trust survey found that only 20 percent of survey respondents from the public believed paid communicators within a company were credible.[42] Individuals in public relations are growing increasingly concerned with their company&#x27;s marketing practices, questioning whether they agree with the company&#x27;s social responsibility. They seek more influence over marketing and more of a counseling and policy-making role. On the other hand, individuals in marketing are increasingly interested in incorporating publicity as a tool within the realm marketing.[43]

According to Scott Cutlip, the social justification for public relations is the right for an organization to have a fair hearing of their point of view in the public forum, but to obtain such a hearing for their ideas requires a skilled advocate.[44]

Marketing and communications strategist, Ira Gostin, believes there is a code of conduct when conducting business and using public relations. Public relations specialists have the ability to influence society. Fact-checking and presenting accurate information is necessary to maintain credibility with employers and clients.[45]
Public Relations
Code of Ethics
The Public Relation Student Society of America has established a set of fundamental guidelines that people within the public relations professions should practice and use in their business atmosphere. These values are:

Advocacy: Serving the public interest by acting as responsible advocates for the clientele. This can occur by displaying the marketplace of ideas, facts and viewpoints to aid informed public debate.
Honesty: Standing by the truth and accuracy of all facts in the case and advancing those statements to the public.
Expertise: To become and stay informed of the specialized knowledge needed in the field of Public Relations. Taking that knowledge and improving the field through development, research and education. Meanwhile, professionals also build their understanding, credibility, and relationships to understand various audiences and industries.
Independence: Provide unbiased work to those that are represented while being accountable for all actions.
Loyalty: Stay devoted to the client while remembering that there is a duty to still serve the public interest.
Fairness: Honorably conduct business with any and all clients, employers, competitors, peers, vendors, media and general public. Respecting all opinions and right of free expression.[46]
International Public Relations Code of Ethics
Other than the ethics put in place in the United States of America there are also International ethics set to ensure proper and, legal worldwide communication. Regarding these ethics, there are broad codes used specifically for international forms of public relations, and then there are more specific forms from different countries. For example, some countries have certain associations to create ethics and standards to communication across their country.

The International Association of Business Communication (founded in 1971),[47] or also known as IABC, has its own set of ethics in order to enforce a set of guidelines that ensure communication internationality is legal, ethical, and is in good taste. Some principles that members of the board of IABC follow include.

Having proper and legal communication
Being understanding and open to other people&#x27;s cultures, values, and beliefs
Create communication that is accurate, trusting, to ensure mutual respect and understanding
The IABC members use the following list of ethics in order to work to improve values of communication throughout the world:[47]

Being credible and honest
Keeping up with information to ensure accuracy of communication
Understanding free speech and respecting this right
Having sensitivity towards other people&#x27;s thoughts, beliefs, and way of life
Not taking part in unethical behaviors
Obeying policies and laws
Giving proper credit to resources used for communication
Ensuring private information is protected (not used for personal gain) and if publicized, guarantee proper legal measures will be put in place.
Publishers of said communication do not accept gifts, benefits, payments etc.; for work, or their services
Creating results and spreading results that are attainable and they can deliver.
Being fully truthful to other people, and themselves.

Media is a major resource in the public relations career especially in news networks. That is why as a public relations specialist, having proper information is very important, and crucial to the society as a whole.
Spin
Main article: Spin (public relations)
Spin has been interpreted historically to mean overt deceit that is meant to manipulate the public, but since the 1950s has shifted to describing a &quot;polishing of the truth.&quot;[48] Today, spin refers to providing a certain interpretation of information meant to sway public opinion.[49] Companies may use spin to create the appearance of the company or other events are going in a slightly different direction than they actually are.[48] Within the field of public relations, spin is seen as a derogatory term, interpreted by professionals as meaning blatant deceit and manipulation.[50][51] Skilled practitioners of spin are sometimes called &quot;spin doctors.&quot;

In Stuart Ewen&#x27;s PR! A Social History of Spin, he argues that public relations can be a real menace to democracy as it renders the public discourse powerless. Corporations are able to hire public relations professionals and transmit their messages through the media channels and exercise a huge amount of influence upon the individual who is defenseless against such a powerful force. He claims that public relations is a weapon for capitalist deception and the best way to resist is to become media literate and use critical thinking when interpreting the various mediated messages.[52]

According to Jim Hoggan, &quot;public relations is not by definition &#x27;spin&#x27;. Public relations is the art of building good relationships. You do that most effectively by earning trust and goodwill among those who are important to you and your business... Spin is to public relations what manipulation is to interpersonal communications. It&#x27;s a diversion whose primary effect is ultimately to undermine the central goal of building trust and nurturing a good relationship.&quot;[53]

The techniques of spin include selectively presenting facts and quotes that support ideal positions (cherry picking), the so-called &quot;non-denial denial&quot;, phrasing that in a way presumes unproven truths, euphemisms for drawing attention away from items considered distasteful, and ambiguity in public statements. Another spin technique involves careful choice of timing in the release of certain news so it can take advantage of prominent events in the news.

Negative
See also: Negative campaigning
Negative public relations, also called dark public relations (DPR), &#x27;black hat PR&#x27; and in some earlier writing &quot;Black PR&quot;, is a process of destroying the target&#x27;s reputation and/or corporate identity. The objective in DPR is to discredit someone else, who may pose a threat to the client&#x27;s business or be a political rival. DPR may rely on IT security, industrial espionage, social engineering and competitive intelligence. Common techniques include using dirty secrets from the target, producing misleading facts to fool a competitor.[54][55][56][57] In politics, a decision to use negative PR is also known as negative campaigning.

== Application ==

=== Face-to-face communication ===

==== Self, social identity and social interaction ====
The social psychologist, Edward E. Jones, brought the study of impression management to the field of psychology during the 1960s and extended it to include people&#x27;s attempts to control others&#x27; impression of their personal characteristics. His work sparked an increased attention towards impression management as a fundamental interpersonal process.

The concept of self is important to the theory of impression management as the images people have of themselves shape and are shaped by social interactions. Our self-concept develops from social experience early in life. Schlenker (1980) further suggests that children anticipate the effect that their behaviours will have on others and how others will evaluate them. They control the impressions they might form on others, and in doing so they control the outcomes they obtain from social interactions.

Social identity refers to how people are defined and regarded in social interactions. Individuals use impression management strategies to influence the social identity they project to others. The identity that people establish influences their behaviour in front of others, others&#x27; treatment of them and the outcomes they receive. Therefore, in their attempts to influence the impressions others form of themselves, a person plays an important role in affecting his social outcomes.

Social interaction is the process by which we act and react to those around us. In a nutshell, social interaction includes those acts people perform toward each other and the responses they give in return. The most basic function of self-presentation is to define the nature of a social situation (Goffman, 1959). Most social interactions are very role governed. Each person has a role to play, and the interaction proceeds smoothly when these roles are enacted effectively. People also strive to create impressions of themselves in the minds of others in order to gain material and social rewards (or avoid material and social punishments).

==== Cross-cultural communication ====
Understanding how one&#x27;s impression management behavior might be interpreted by others can also serve as the basis for smoother interactions and as a means for solving some of the most insidious communication problems among individuals of different racial/ethnic and gender backgrounds (Sanaria, 2016).

&quot;People are sensitive to how they are seen by others and use many forms of impression management to compel others to react to them in the ways they wish&quot; (Giddens, 2005, p. 142). An example of this concept is easily illustrated through cultural differences. Different cultures have diverse thoughts and opinions on what is considered beautiful or attractive. For example, Americans tend to find tan skin attractive, but in Indonesian culture, pale skin is more desirable. It is also argued that Women in India use different impression management strategies as compared to women in western cultures (Sanaria, 2016).

Another illustration of how people attempt to control how others perceive them is portrayed through the clothing they wear. A person who is in a leadership position strives to be respected and in order to control and maintain the impression. This illustration can also be adapted for a cultural scenario. The clothing people choose to wear says a great deal about the person and the culture they represent. For example, most Americans are not overly concerned with conservative clothing. Most Americans are content with tee shirts, shorts, and showing skin. The exact opposite is true on the other side of the world. &quot;Indonesians are both modest and conservative in their attire&quot; (Cole, 1997, p. 77).

One way people shape their identity is through sharing photos on social media platforms. The ability to modify photos by certain technologies, such as Photoshop, helps achieve their idealized images.

Companies use cross-cultural training (CCT) to facilitate effective cross-cultural interaction. CCT can be defined as any procedure used to increase an individual&#x27;s ability to cope with and work in a foreign environment. Training employees in culturally consistent and specific impression management (IM) techniques provide the avenue for the employee to consciously switch from an automatic, home culture IM mode to an IM mode that is culturally appropriate and acceptable. Second, training in IM reduces the uncertainty of interaction with FNs and increases employee&#x27;s ability to cope by reducing unexpected events.

==== Team-working in hospital wards ====
Impression management theory can also be used in health communication. It can be used to explore how professionals &#x27;present&#x27; themselves when interacting on hospital wards and also how they employ front stage and backstage settings in their collaborative work.

In the hospital wards, Goffman&#x27;s front stage and backstage performances are divided into &#x27;planned&#x27; and &#x27;ad hoc&#x27; rather than &#x27;official&#x27; and &#x27;unofficial&#x27; interactions.

* &quot;Planned front stage&quot; is the structured collaborative activities such as ward rounds and care conferences which took place in the presence of patients and/or carers.
* &quot;Ad hoc front stage&quot; is the unstructured or unplanned interprofessional interactions that took place in front of patients/carers or directly involved patients/carers.
* &quot;Planned backstage&quot; is the structured multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT) in which professionals gathered in a private area of the ward, in the absence of patients, to discuss management plans for patients under their care.
* &quot;Ad hoc backstage&quot; is the use of corridors and other ward spaces for quick conversations between professionals in the absence of patients/carers.
* Offstage is the social activities between and among professional groups/individuals outside of the hospital context.

Results show that interprofessional interactions in this setting are often based less on planned front stage activities than on ad hoc backstage activities. While the former may, at times, help create and maintain an appearance of collaborative interprofessional &#x27;teamwork&#x27;, conveying a sense of professional togetherness in front of patients and their families, they often serve little functional practice. These findings have implications for designing ways to improve interprofessional practice on acute hospital wards where there is no clearly defined interprofessional team, but rather a loose configuration of professionals working together in a collaborative manner around a particular patient. In such settings, interventions that aim to improve both ad hoc as well as planned forms of communication may be more successful than those intended to only improve planned communication.

=== Computer-mediated communication ===
The hyperpersonal model of computer-mediated communication (CMC) posits that users exploit the technological aspects of CMC in order to enhance the messages they construct to manage impressions and facilitate desired relationships. The most interesting aspect of the advent of CMC is how it reveals basic elements of interpersonal communication, bringing into focus fundamental processes that occur as people meet and develop relationships relying on typed messages as the primary mechanism of expression. &quot;Physical features such as one&#x27;s appearance and voice provide much of the information on which people base first impressions face-to-face, but such features are often unavailable in CMC. Various perspectives on CMC have suggested that the lack of nonverbal cues diminishes CMC&#x27;s ability to foster impression formation and management, or argued impressions develop nevertheless, relying on language and content cues. One approach that describes the way that CMC&#x27;s technical capacities work in concert with users&#x27; impression development intentions is the hyperpersonal model of CMC (Walther, 1996). As receivers, CMC users idealize partners based on the circumstances or message elements that suggest minimal similarity or desirability. As senders, CMC users selectively self-present, revealing attitudes and aspects of the self in a controlled and socially desirable fashion. The CMC channel facilitates editing, discretion, and convenience, and the ability to tune out environmental distractions and re-allocate cognitive resources in order to further enhance one&#x27;s message composition. Finally, CMC may create dynamic feedback loops wherein the exaggerated expectancies are confirmed and reciprocated through mutual interaction via the bias-prone communication processes identified above.&quot;

According to O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s (2000) impression management model of communication channels, individuals will prefer to use mediated channels rather than face-to-face conversation in face-threatening situations. Within his model, this trend is due to the channel features that allow for control over exchanged social information. The present paper extends O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s model by explicating information control as a media affordance, arising from channel features and social skills, that enables an individual to regulate and restrict the flow of social information in an interaction, and present a scale to measure it. One dimension of the information control scale, expressive information control, positively predicted channel preference for recalled face-threatening situations. This effect remained after controlling for social anxiousness and power relations in relationships. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s model argues that some communication channels may help individuals manage this struggle and therefore be more preferred as those situations arise. It was based on an assumption that channels with features that allow fewer social cues, such as reduced nonverbal information or slower exchange of messages, invariably afford an individual with an ability to better manage the flow of a complex, ambiguous, or potentially difficult conversations. Individuals manage what information about them is known, or isn&#x27;t known, to control other&#x27;s impression of them. Anyone who has given the bathroom a quick cleaning when they anticipate the arrival of their mother-in-law (or date) has managed their impression. For an example from information and communication technology use, inviting someone to view a person&#x27;s Webpage before a face-to-face meeting may predispose them to view the person a certain way when they actually meet.

==== Corporate brand ====
The impression management perspective offers potential insight into how corporate stories could build the corporate brand, by influencing the impressions that stakeholders form of the organization. The link between themes and elements of corporate stories and IM strategies/behaviours indicates that these elements will influence audiences&#x27; perceptions of the corporate brand.

===== Corporate storytelling =====
Corporate storytelling is suggested to help demonstrate the importance of the corporate brand to internal and external stakeholders, and create a position for the company against competitors, as well as help a firm to bond with its employees (Roper and Fill, 2012). The corporate reputation is defined as a stakeholder&#x27;s perception of the organization (Brown et al., 2006), and Dowling (2006) suggests that if the story causes stakeholders to perceive the organization as more authentic, distinctive, expert, sincere, powerful, and likeable, then it is likely that this will enhance the overall corporate reputation.

Impression management theory is a relevant perspective to explore the use of corporate stories in building the corporate brand. The corporate branding literature notes that interactions with brand communications enable stakeholders to form an impression of the organization (Abratt and Keyn, 2012), and this indicates that IM theory could also therefore bring insight into the use of corporate stories as a form of communication to build the corporate brand. Exploring the IM strategies/behaviors evident in corporate stories can indicate the potential for corporate stories to influence the impressions that audiences form of the corporate brand.

===== Corporate document =====
Firms use more subtle forms of influencing outsiders&#x27; impressions of firm performance and prospects, namely by manipulating the content and presentation of information in corporate documents with the purpose of &quot;distort[ing] readers&quot; perceptions of corporate achievements&quot; [Godfrey et al., 2003, p. 96]. In the accounting literature this is referred to as impression management. The opportunity for impression management in corporate reports is increasing. Narrative disclosures have become longer and more sophisticated over the last few years. This growing importance of descriptive sections in corporate documents provides firms with the opportunity to overcome information asymmetries by presenting more detailed information and explanation, thereby increasing their decision-usefulness. However, they also offer an opportunity for presenting financial performance and prospects in the best possible light, thus having the opposite effect. In addition to the increased opportunity for opportunistic discretionary disclosure choices, impression management is also facilitated in that corporate narratives are largely unregulated.

==== Media ====
The medium of communication influences the actions taken in impression management. Self-efficacy can differ according to the fact whether the trial to convince somebody is made through face-to-face-interaction or by means of an e-mail. Communication via devices like telephone, e-mail or chat is governed by technical restrictions, so that the way people express personal features etc. can be changed. This often shows how far people will go.

The affordances of a certain medium also influence the way a user self-presents. Communication via a professional medium such as e-mail would result in professional self-presentation. The individual would use greetings, correct spelling, grammar and capitalization as well as scholastic language. Personal communication mediums such as text-messaging would result in a casual self-presentation where the user shortens words, includes emojis and selfies and uses less academic language.

Another example of impression management theory in play is present in today&#x27;s world of social media. Users are able to create a profile and share whatever they like with their friends, family, or the world. Users can choose to omit negative life events and highlight positive events if they so please.

===== Profiles on social networking sites =====
Social media usage among American adults grew from 5% in 2005 to 69% in 2018. Facebook is the most popular social media platform, followed by Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter.

Social networking users will employ protective self-presentations for image management. Users will use subtractive and repudiate strategies to maintain a desired image. Subtractive strategy is used to untag an undesirable photo on Social Networking Sites. In addition to un-tagging their name, some users will request the photo to be removed entirely. Repudiate strategy is used when a friend posts an undesirable comment about the user. In response to an undesired post, users may add another wall post as an innocence defense. Michael Stefanone states that &quot;self-esteem maintenance is an important motivation for strategic self-presentation online.&quot; Outside evaluations of their physical appearance, competence, and approval from others determines how social media users respond to pictures and wall posts. Unsuccessful self-presentation online can lead to rejection and criticism from social groups. Social media users are motivated to actively participate in SNS from a desire to manage their online image.

Online social media presence often varies with respect to users&#x27; age, gender, and body weight. While men and women tend to use social media in comparable degrees, both uses and capabilities vary depending on individual preferences as well perceptions of power or dominance. In terms of performance, men tend to display characteristics associated with masculinity as well as more commanding language styles. In much the same way, women tend to present feminine self-depictions and engage in more supportive language.

With respect to usage across age variances, many children develop digital and social media literacy skills around 7 or 8 and begin to form online social relationships via virtual environments designed for their age group. The years between thirteen and fifteen demonstrate high social media usage that begins to become more balanced with offline interactions as teens learn to navigate both their online and in-person identities which may often diverge from one another.

Social media platforms often provide a great degree of social capital during the college years and later. College students are motivated to use Facebook for impression management, self-expression, entertainment, communication and relationship maintenance. College students sometimes rely on Facebook to build a favorable online identity, which contributes to greater satisfaction with campus life. In building an online persona, college students sometimes engage in identity manipulation, including altering personality and appearance, to increase their self-esteem and appear more attractive to peers. Since risky behavior is frequently deemed attractive by peers, college students often use their social media profiles to gain approval by highlighting instances of risky behavior, like alcohol use and unhealthy eating. Users present risky behavior as signs of achievement, fun, and sociability, participating in a form of impression management aimed at building recognition and acceptance among peers. During middle adulthood, users tend to display greater levels of confidence and mastery in their social media connections while older adults tend to use social media for educational and supportive purposes. These myriad factors influence how users will form and communicate their online personas. In addition to that, TikTok has made an influence on college students and adults to create their own self-image on a social media platform. The positivity of this is that college students and adults are using this to create their own brand for business purposes and for entertainment purposes. This gives them a chance to seek the desires of stardom and build an audience for revenue. Media fatigue is a negative effect that is caused by the conveyance of social media presence. Social anxiety stems from low-self esteem which causes a strain of stress in one&#x27;s self-identity that is perceived in the media limelight for targeted audiences.

According to Marwick, social profiles create implications such as &quot;context collapse&quot; for presenting oneself to the audience. The concept of &#x27;context collapse&#x27; suggests that social technologies make it difficult to vary self-presentation based on environment or audience. &quot;Large sites such as Facebook and Twitter group friends, family members, coworkers, and acquaintances together under the umbrella term &#x27;friends&#x27;.&quot; In a way, this context collapse is aided by a notion of performativity as characterized by Judith Butler.

==== Political impression management ====
Impression management is also influential in the political spectrum. &quot;Political impression management&quot; was coined in 1972 by sociologist Peter M. Hall, who defined the term as the art of marking a candidate look electable and capable (Hall, 1972). This is due in part to the importance of &quot;presidential&quot; candidates—appearance, image, and narrative are a key part of a campaign and thus impression management has always been a huge part of winning an election (Katz 2016). Social media has evolved to be part of the political process, thus political impression management is becoming more challenging as the online image of the candidate often now lies in the hands of the voters themselves.

The evolution of social media has increased the way in which political campaigns are targeting voters and how influential impression management is when discussing political issues and campaigns. Political campaigns continue to use social media as a way to promote their campaigns and share information about who they are to make sure to lead the conversation about their political platform. Research has shown that political campaigns must create clear profiles for each candidate in order to convey the right message to potential voters.

=== In the workplace ===
In professional settings, impression management is usually primarily focused on appearing competent, but also involves constructing and displaying an image of oneself that others find socially desirable and believably authentic. People manage impressions by their choice of dress, dressing either more or less formally, and this impacts perceptions their coworkers and supervisors form. The process includes a give and take; the person managing their impression receives feedback as the people around them interact with the self they are presenting and respond, either favorably or negatively. Research has shown impression management to be impactful in the workplace because the perceptions co-workers form of one another shape their relationships and indirectly influence their ability to function well as teams and achieve goals together. 

In their research on impression management among leaders, Peck and Hogue define &quot;impression management as conscious or unconscious, authentic or inauthentic, goal-directed behavior individuals engage in to influence the impression others form of them in social interactions.&quot; Using those three dimensions, labelled &quot;automatic&quot; vs. &quot;controlled&quot;, &quot;authentic&quot; vs. &quot;inauthentic&quot;, and &quot;pro-self&quot; vs. &quot;pro-social&quot;, Peck and Hogue formed a typology of eight impression management archetypes. They suggest that while no one archetype stands out as the sole correct or ideal way to practice impression management as a leader, types rooted in authenticity and pro-social goals, rather than self-focused goals, create the most positive perceptions among followers.

Impression management strategies employed in the workplace also involve deception, and the ability to recognize deceptive acts impacts the supervisor-subordinate relationship as well as coworker relationships. When it comes to workplace behaviors, ingratiation is the major focus of impression management research. Ingratiation behaviors are those that employees engage in to elicit a favorable impression from a supervisor. These behaviors can have a negative or positive impact on coworkers and supervisors, and this impact is dependent on how ingratiating is perceived by the target and those who observe the ingratiating behaviors. The perception that follows an ingratiation act is dependent on whether the target attributes the behavior to the authentic-self of the person performing the act, or to impression management strategies. Once the target is aware that ingratiation is resulting from impression management strategies, the target will perceive ethical concerns regarding the performance. However, if the target attributes the ingratiation performance to the actor&#x27;s authentic-self, the target will perceive the behavior as positive and not have ethical concerns.

Workplace leaders that are publicly visible, such as CEOs, also perform impression management with regard to stakeholders outside their organizations. In a study comparing online profiles of North American and European CEOs, research showed that while education was referenced similarly in both groups, profiles of European CEOs tended to be more professionally focused, while North American CEO profiles often referenced the CEO&#x27;s public life outside business dealings, including social and political stances and involvement.

Employees also engage in impression management behaviors to conceal or reveal personal stigmas. How these individuals approach their disclosure of the stigma(s) impacts coworker&#x27;s perceptions of the individual, as well as the individual&#x27;s perception of themselves, and thus affects likeability amongst coworkers and supervisors.

On a smaller scale, many individuals choose to participate in professional impression management beyond the sphere of their own workplace. This may take place through informal networking (either face-to-face or using computer-mediated communication) or channels built to connect professionals, such as professional associations, or job-related social media sites, like LinkedIn.  

== Implications ==
Impression management can distort the results of empirical research that relies on interviews and surveys, a phenomenon commonly referred to as &quot;social desirability bias&quot;. Impression management theory nevertheless constitutes a field of research on its own.
When it comes to practical questions concerning public relations and the way organizations should handle their public image, the assumptions provided by impression management theory can also provide a framework.

An examination of different impression management strategies acted out by individuals who were facing criminal trials where the trial outcomes could range from a death sentence, life in prison or acquittal has been reported in the forensic literature.
The Perri and Lichtenwald article examined female psychopathic killers, whom as a group were highly motivated to manage the impression that attorneys, judges, mental health professions and ultimately, a jury had of the murderers and the murder they committed. It provides legal case illustrations of the murderers combining and/or switching from one impression management strategy such as ingratiation or supplication to another as they worked towards their goal of diminishing or eliminating any accountability for the murders they committed.

Since the 1990s, researchers in the area of sport and exercise psychology have studied self-presentation. Concern about how one is perceived has been found to be relevant to the study of athletic performance. For example, anxiety may be produced when an athlete is in the presence of spectators. Self-presentational concerns have also been found to be relevant to exercise. For example, the concerns may elicit motivation to exercise.

More recent research investigating the effects of impression management on social behaviour showed that social behaviours (e.g. eating) can serve to convey a desired impression to others and enhance one&#x27;s self-image. Research on eating has shown that people tend to eat less when they believe that they are being observed by others.

<doc id="601801" wikidata="Q946681" url="?curid=601801" title="African grey woodpecker">
<text>The African grey woodpecker (Dendropicos goertae) is a species of bird in the woodpecker family Picidae. Is a widespread and frequently common resident breeder in much of Sub-Saharan and equatorial Africa. It is a species associated with forest and bush which nests in a tree hole, often in an oil palm, laying two to four eggs. It is a common bird with a very wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The African grey woodpecker was described by the German zoologist Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller in 1776 from a specimen collected in Senegal. He coined the binomial name &quot;Picus goertae&quot;. The specific epithet is from the French polymath Comte de Buffon who noted that &quot;Goërtan&quot; was the name used for the species in Senegal. The species was also illustrated in a set of plates that accompanied Brisson&#x27;s work. The African grey woodpecker is now placed in the genus &quot;Dendropicos&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Alfred Malherbe in 1849.

Five subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;D. g. koenigi&quot; (Neumann, 1903) – Mali to west Sudan
* &quot;D. g. abessinicus&quot; (Reichenow, 1900) – east Sudan to west Ethiopia
* &quot;D. g. goertae&quot; (Müller, PLS, 1776) – Senegal and Gambia to Mali.
* &quot;D. g. centralis&quot; (Reichenow, 1900) – Sierra Leone to Nigeria, south Sudan, west Kenya and northwest Tanzania
* &quot;D. g. meridionalis&quot; Louette &amp; Prigogine, 1982 – south Gabon and northwest Angola to south central Democratic Republic of the Congo

The African grey woodpecker and the eastern grey woodpecker (&quot;Picidae spodocephalus&quot;) were formerly treated as conspecific.

==Description==
Like other woodpeckers, this species has a straight pointed bill, a stiff tail to provide support against tree trunks, and zygodactyl or “yoked&quot; feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. The long tongue can be darted forward to capture insects. This bird is in length. It is a typical woodpecker shape, and has unmarked green upperparts and a pale grey head and underparts. The rump is red, and there is a small red belly patch. The short tail is blackish. The adult male grey woodpecker has a red crown. Females have a plain grey head, lacking the red crown. Young birds are like the female, but the reds are paler, and there may be some flank barring.

==Distribution and habitat==
The African grey woodpecker is native to tropical parts of western and central Africa. Its range includes Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo and Uganda.

<text>Hatzor HaGlilit () is a town in the Korazim Plateau in the Upper Galilee in northern Israel near Rosh Pinna and Safed. It is named for the nearby biblical site of Tel Hazor. In it had a population of .

==History==
=== Ancient Hazor ===

Hatzor HaGlilit is named after the biblical city of Hazor, a Canaanite and later Israelite city belonging to the tribe of Naphtali (Joshua 19:36). In 732 BCE, it was conquered by Tiglath-Pileser III of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and its population was deported, while the city was burnt to the ground.

Ancient Hazor was discovered in Tel Hazor, a tell located near kibbutz Ayelet HaShahar, few kilometers north of Hazor HaGlilit.

=== Modern Hatzor HaGlilit ===
Hatzor HaGlilit was founded in 1952–1953 as a transit camp. The new camp was located on the land of the depopulated Palestinian village of Mughr al-Khayt, 1 km southeast of the village site. The two adjacent transit camps were initially named &quot;Hatzor A&quot; and &quot;Hatzor B&quot;, named for the nearby biblical site of Tel Hatzor, and housed immigrants and refugees, primarily Jews from North Africa.

In 1956, Hatzor HaGlilit was given the status of local council. By 1958, Hatzor HaGlilit had a population of 4,000 and received development town status. Over time, the city preserved its Jewish religious-traditional demographic status and later a Jewish ultra-Orthodox neighbourhood was also established, housing Gur Hassids.

In December 2011, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Hazor was populated by 8,705 residents, with 0.0% population growth.

==Landmarks==
One of the town&#x27;s most well-known landmarks is the tomb of Honi the Circle-Maker, adjoining the burial sites of two of his grandsons, Abba Hilkiyah and Hanan HaNihba. According to Jewish legend, Honi HaM&#x27;agel had the power to bring rain through his prayers. The presence of this shrine attracted a large Gerrer hassid population to the town.

<text>Stephan &quot;Steff&quot; Eberharter (born 24 March 1969) is a former World Cup alpine ski racer from Austria.

==Biography==
Born in Brixlegg, Tyrol, Eberharter was the winner of the overall World Cup title in 2002 and 2003, as well as the season titles in downhill and super-G. He was the nearest rival of compatriot Hermann Maier in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Eberharter retired from international competition following the conclusion of the 2003–04 season.

==Career==
Eberharter made his World Cup debut during the 1990 season at age 20, where he finished 32nd in the overall standings. The next year he finished second in the super-G standings and won two gold medals at the 1991 World Championships in Saalbach, the super-G and combined. He was voted the Austrian Sportspersonality of the year for 1991.

After injury setbacks, he became particularly successful in the downhill event, and finished third in the downhill standings in 1998 and was the runner-up in 2001. His nemesis on the snow, teammate Maier, was involved in a serious motorcycle accident in August 2001 which sidelined him for the 2002 season. In Maier&#x27;s absence, Eberharter went on to take the overall World Cup title (and downhill and super-G) in 2002 and 2003. His 2004 victory at the Hahnenkamm downhill in Kitzbühel is often regarded as one of the most impressive downhill victories in alpine skiing history, besting runner-up Daron Rahlves by a lengthy 1.21 seconds, an equivalent of at .

Eberharter enjoyed success at the World Championships and Olympic Games as well. In 1991 in Saalbach, he won two gold medals in the super-G and combined events. Twelve years later, at St. Moritz in 2003, he took gold in the super-G event again. At the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, he finished second in the giant slalom, but went on to take gold in the same event at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, where he also won the bronze medal in the downhill, and took silver in the super-G.

In his final season in 2004, Eberharter won four downhills and the downhill season title; he had twelve podiums, was second in the overall standings, and third in Super-G.

<doc id="601814" wikidata="Q913313" url="?curid=601814" title="Three (Sugababes album)">
<text>Three is the third studio album by British girl group Sugababes, released by Island Records on 27 October 2003. It generated four singles that charted in various parts of the world; the first, &quot;Hole in the Head&quot;, became the group&#x27;s third UK number one single. The three members of the Sugababes each recorded a &quot;solo&quot; song on the album—&quot;Whatever Makes You Happy&quot; (Keisha Buchanan), &quot;Sometimes&quot; (Heidi Range) and &quot;Maya&quot; (Mutya Buena). &quot;Three&quot; debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart.
==Background==
After releasing &quot;Shape&quot;, the fourth and final single from their successful previous album &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (2002), the group announced that they had gone back into the studio to start work on the next album with producers whom they worked with on the previous album such as Jony Rockstar and Xenomania. They went over to America to work with producers such as Linda Perry and Diane Warren, who wrote the ballad &quot;Too Lost in You&quot;. They had also aimed to promote the new album in America. The girls co-wrote and recorded their own tracks on the new album—Keisha&#x27;s being &quot;Whatever Makes You Happy&quot;, Heidi&#x27;s being &quot;Sometimes&quot;, and Mutya&#x27;s being &quot;Maya&quot;, a song about her sister who died unexpectedly. The Sugababes later announced the lead single &quot;Hole in the Head&quot; and its release date of 13 October. The UK release was a special edition with two extra tracks, &quot;Twisted&quot; and &quot;Buster&quot;. Initially, the digital download version offered by Woolworths in the UK accidentally contained an earlier demo version of &quot;Whatever Makes You Happy&quot; but the mistake was quickly rectified. On streaming services, an alternative version of &quot;Whatever Makes You Happy&quot; has replaced the original album version.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Three&quot; debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart with 52,905 copies sold in its first week. The first single, &quot;Hole in the Head&quot;, was the group&#x27;s third number-one single in the United Kingdom and also went to number one in Denmark. It reached number two in Ireland and Norway, and the top forty in Australia. The second single, &quot;Too Lost in You&quot;, reached the top ten in the UK and Norway, and the top forty in Australia. The third single, &quot;In the Middle&quot;, went top ten in the UK, top twenty in Ireland and top forty in Europe and Australia. A fourth single, &quot;Caught in a Moment&quot;, also reached the top ten in the UK.

In 2004, &quot;Hole in the Head&quot; was serviced to radio in the United States and became a top forty hit on pop radio. Following the moderate success of the single, &quot;Three&quot; was due for release in the US on 22 June 2004 with an altered track listing featuring singles from the group&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (2002). The release was subsequently cancelled. In the UK, the album is certified two times Platinum by the BPI. The album also received a Platinum Europe Award by the IFPI in recognition of European sales in excess of 1 million copies.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Three&quot; received positive reviews from critics, who praised the experimental new urban and hip hop sounds on the album. Alan Braidwood from the BBC gave &quot;Three&quot; a positive review, stating the album takes lead from &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; and calling it a fresh and exciting album. He also praised the new sound on the album. Ross Hoffman from AllMusic described the album as &quot;tuneful, R&amp;B-inflected dance-pop with fresh-sounding but accessible productions, along with a healthy smattering of big droopy ballads with an expanded stylistic range&quot;.

<doc id="601816" wikidata="Q407605" url="?curid=601816" title="Barium hydroxide">
<text>Barium hydroxide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula Ba(OH)2. The monohydrate (&quot;x&quot; = 1), known as baryta or baryta-water, is one of the principal compounds of barium. This white granular monohydrate is the usual commercial form.

==Preparation and structure==
Barium hydroxide can be prepared by dissolving barium oxide (BaO) in water:

:BaO + H2O → Ba(OH)2

It crystallises as the octahydrate, which converts to the monohydrate upon heating in air. At 100 °C in a vacuum, the monohydrate will yield BaO and water. The monohydrate adopts a layered structure (see picture above). The Ba2+ centers adopt a square antiprismatic geometry. Each Ba2+ center is bound by two water ligands and six hydroxide ligands, which are respectively doubly and triply bridging to neighboring Ba2+ centre sites. In the octahydrate, the individual Ba2+ centers are again eight coordinate but do not share ligands.
==Uses==
Industrially, barium hydroxide is used as the precursor to other barium compounds. The monohydrate is used to dehydrate and remove sulfate from various products. This application exploits the very low solubility of barium sulfate. This industrial application is also applied to laboratory uses.

===Laboratory uses===
Barium hydroxide is used in analytical chemistry for the titration of weak acids, particularly organic acids. Its aqueous solution, if clear, is guaranteed to be free of carbonate, unlike those of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, as barium carbonate is insoluble in water. This allows the use of indicators such as phenolphthalein or thymolphthalein (with alkaline colour changes) without the risk of titration errors due to the presence of carbonate ions, which are much less basic.

Barium hydroxide is occasionally used in organic synthesis as a strong base, for example for the hydrolysis of esters and nitriles, and as a base in aldol condensations.
:

There are several uses for barium hydroxide such as to hydrolyse one of the two equivalent ester groups in dimethyl hendecanedioate.

Barium hydroxide has also been used in the decarboxylation of amino acids liberating barium carbonate in the process.

It is also used in the preparation of cyclopentanone, diacetone alcohol and -gulonic γ-lactone.
:

==Reactions==
Barium hydroxide decomposes to barium oxide when heated to 800 °C. Reaction with carbon dioxide gives barium carbonate. Its aqueous solution, being highly alkaline, undergoes neutralization reactions with acids. It is especially useful on reactions that require the titrations of weak organic acids. Thus, it forms barium sulfate and barium phosphate with sulfuric and phosphoric acids, respectively. Reaction with hydrogen sulfide produces barium sulfide. Precipitation of many insoluble, or less soluble barium salts, may result from double replacement reaction when a barium hydroxide aqueous solution is mixed with many solutions of other metal salts.

Reactions of barium hydroxide with ammonium salts are strongly endothermic. The reaction of barium hydroxide octahydrate with ammonium chloride or ammonium thiocyanate is often used as a classroom chemistry demonstration, producing temperatures cold enough to freeze water and enough water to dissolve the resulting mixture.

==Safety==
Barium hydroxide presents the same hazards such as skin irritation and burns as well as eye damage, just as the other strong bases and as other water-soluble barium compounds: it is corrosive and toxic.

<doc id="601834" wikidata="Q423245" url="?curid=601834" title="Hydrobromic acid">
<text>Hydrobromic acid is an aqueous solution of hydrogen bromide. It is a strong acid formed by dissolving the diatomic molecule hydrogen bromide (HBr) in water. &quot;Constant boiling&quot; hydrobromic acid is an aqueous solution that distills at and contains 47.6% HBr by mass, which is 8.77 mol/L. Hydrobromic acid is one of the strongest mineral acids known.

==Uses==
Hydrobromic acid is mainly used for the production of inorganic bromides, especially the bromides of zinc, calcium, and sodium. It is a useful reagent for generating organobromine compounds. Certain ethers are cleaved with HBr. It also catalyzes alkylation reactions and the extraction of certain ores. Industrially significant organic compounds prepared from hydrobromic acid include allyl bromide, tetrabromobis(phenol), and bromoacetic acid. HBr participates in anti-Markovnikov hydrohalogenation of alkenes in the presence of peroxides. The resulting 1-bromoalkanes are versatile alkylating agents, giving rise to fatty amines and quaternary ammonium salts.

==Synthesis==
Hydrobromic acid can be prepared in the laboratory via the reaction of Br2, SO2, and water.

More typically laboratory preparations involve the production of anhydrous HBr, which is then dissolved in water.

Hydrobromic acid has commonly been prepared industrially by reacting bromine with either sulfur or phosphorus and water. However, it can also be produced electrolytically. It can also be prepared by treating bromides with non-oxidising acids like phosphoric or acetic acids.

Alternatively the acid can be prepared with dilute (5.8M) sulfuric acid and potassium bromide:

Using more concentrated sulfuric acid or allowing the reaction solution to exceed 75 °C further oxidizes HBr to elemental bromine. The acid is further purified by filtering out the KHSO4 and by distilling off the water until the solution reaches an azeotrope (124.3 °C). The yield is approximately 85%.

Hydrobromic acid is available commercially in various concentrations and purities.

<doc id="601836" wikidata="Q17157349" url="?curid=601836" title="Sociosexuality">
<text>Sociosexuality, sometimes called sociosexual orientation, is the individual difference in the willingness to engage in sexual activity outside of a committed relationship. Individuals who are more &quot;restricted&quot; sociosexually are less willing to engage in casual sex; they prefer greater love, commitment and emotional closeness before having sex with romantic partners. Individuals who are more &quot;unrestricted&quot; sociosexually are more willing to have casual sex and are more comfortable engaging in sex without love, commitment or closeness.

==Measurement==

The revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI-R) was designed to measure sociosexuality, with high SOI scores corresponding to an unrestricted orientation and low SOI scores denoting a more restricted orientation. The SOI-R also allows for the separate assessment of three facets of sociosexuality: behavior, attitude and desire.

==Gender differences and sexual orientation==
Men tend to have higher SOI scores and be more unrestricted than women across a variety of cultures. However, there is more variability in scores within each gender than between men and women, indicating that although the average man is less restricted than the average woman, individuals may vary in sociosexuality regardless of gender.

Bisexual women are significantly less restricted in their sociosexual attitudes than both lesbian and heterosexual women. Bisexual women are also the most unrestricted in sociosexual behavior, followed by lesbians and then, heterosexual women. Gay and bisexual men are similar to heterosexual men in sociosexual attitudes, in that they express relatively unrestricted attitudes relative to women. However, gay men are the most unrestricted in sociosexual behavior, followed by bisexual men and then, heterosexual men. This may be because gay men have more potential partners who prefer short-term, casual sexual encounters.

Unrestricted sociosexuality is associated with early life experiences with sex, more frequent sexual activity and a greater number of lifetime sex partners. Unrestricted women tend to have more sexual fantasies involving having dominance and lower levels of sexual conservatism than restricted women.

==Individual differences==
Individuals who are sociosexually unrestricted tend to score higher on openness to experience, and be more extraverted, less agreeable, lower on honesty-humility, more erotophilic, more impulsive, more likely to take risks, more likely to have an avoidant attachment style, less likely to have a secure attachment style, and score higher on the dark triad traits (i.e. narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy). Higher masculinity and eveningness in women is related to unrestricted sociosexuality. High self-monitoring is also associated with unrestricted sociosexuality, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.

Individuals with an intrinsic religious orientation (i.e., religion as an end) tend to be sociosexually restricted, while those with an extrinsic religious orientation (i.e., religion as a means to achieve non-religious goals) tend to be unrestricted.

==Mating tendencies==

===Motives===
Unrestricted women are more motivated to engage in casual sex than restricted women as they perceive more benefits associated with short-term mating. These include sexual benefits (e.g., experiencing the novelty of a new partner), resource benefits (e.g., receiving expensive gifts) and the improvement of their seduction skills. Sociosexuality is not associated with short-term benefits for men.

When viewing attractive female models, unrestricted men are more interested in the models&#x27; physical attractiveness, while restricted men show more interest in the social traits presumably possessed by attractive females. Unrestricted women report more interest in attractive male models&#x27; popularity and are less interested in their willingness to commit, compared to restricted women.

===Mate preferences===
Men and women with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation view short-term mates with greater sexual experience as more desirable, whereas restricted women perceive partners&#x27; sexual inexperience as desirable. Unrestricted individuals place more importance on partners&#x27; physical attractiveness and sex appeal, while restricted individuals place more weight on characteristics indicative of good personal and parenting qualities (e.g., kind, responsible, faithful). Judgement of sexual attractiveness is more variable in unrestricted men than in restricted males.

Individuals are able to accurately assess the sociosexuality of computer-generated and real faces, with unrestricted sociosexuality being associated with greater attractiveness in female faces and greater masculinity in male faces. Women tend to prefer male faces associated with restricted sociosexuality, while men prefer unrestricted female faces, both for short-term and long-term partners.

===Relationship interactions===
Unrestricted women report engaging in more social interactions with men on a daily basis than restricted women. However, unrestricted individuals rate their interactions with their best friends (non-romantic) as lower in quality (i.e., as less pleasant and satisfying) than restricted individuals. Unrestricted individuals are also more likely to view cheating or infidelity as acceptable under certain conditions (e.g., when involved in a bad relationship), and report engaging in more cheating than restricted individuals. The relationship between sociosexual orientation and infidelity is mediated by commitment, meaning unrestricted individuals may cheat because they are less committed to their partner than restricted individuals.

==Hormones==
Individuals who are partnered typically have lower testosterone levels than individuals who are single. However, this was found to apply solely to individuals who have a restricted sociosexuality. Partnered, unrestricted men and women&#x27;s testosterone levels are more similar to the levels of single men and women.

==Culture==
In regions that suffer from a high prevalence of infectious diseases, both men and women report lower levels of sociosexuality, as the costs of an incautious lifestyle (i.e., being unrestricted) may outweigh the benefits.

==Implications==
Possessing an unrestricted sociosexuality seems to increase the likelihood of having a son by 12-19% in American samples. This may be explained by the generalized Trivers-Willard hypothesis, which states that parents who possess any heritable trait that increases males&#x27; reproductive success above females&#x27; will have more sons, and will have more daughters if they possess traits that increase females&#x27; reproductive success above males&#x27;. Since unrestricted sociosexuality increases the reproductive fitness of sons more than daughters (as males have the potential to have more offspring through casual sex), unrestricted parents have a higher-than-expected offspring sex ratio (more sons).

==Relevant theories==

===Parental investment theory===
According to the parental investment theory, the gender that invests more in offspring tends to be more discriminating and more sociosexually restricted (usually women, due to pregnancy, childbirth and lactation). In a year, a woman can give birth once (except in the case of a multiple pregnancy), regardless of the number of partners she has had, whereas a man can potentially have more children than the number of women with whom he has slept due to multiple births. Thus, women should be more selective and restricted in order to have children with partners possessing good genes and resources, who can provide for potential offspring. Men, however, may increase their reproductive fitness by being unrestricted and having many children with many women. Thus, since men do not need to invest as much physically (no pregnancy), they tend to have a more unrestricted sociosexuality.

===Sex ratio theory===
Operational sex ratio is the number of sexually competing males versus the number of sexually competing females in the local mating pool. High sex ratios indicate that there are more men than women available, while low sex ratios imply more women than men are sexually available. High sex ratios (more men) are associated with lower SOI scores (more restricted sociosexual orientation), as men must satisfy women&#x27;s preference for long-term monogamous relationships if they are to effectively compete for the limited number of women. Low sex ratios (more women) are correlated with more unrestricted sociosexuality, as men can afford to demand more casual sex if they are relatively scarce and in demand.

===Strategic pluralism theory===
Strategic pluralism suggests that women evolved to evaluate men on two dimensions: their potential to be a good provider for offspring and their degree of genetic quality. The local environment should have influenced which mate characteristics were preferred by women. In demanding environments where biparental care was critical to infant survival, women should have valued good parenting qualities more, leading men to adopt a more restricted sociosexuality and invest more in their offspring to help ensure their children survive. In disease-prevalent environments, good genes that would help offspring resist pathogens should have been prioritized by women, leading healthy men to be more sociosexually unrestricted in order to pass on their genes to many offspring.

===Social structural theory===
According to social structural theory, the division of labor and social expectations lead to gender differences in sociosexuality. In cultures with more traditional gender roles (where women have less freedom than men), gender differences in sociosexuality are larger. In these societies, where women have less access to power and money than men, it is expected that women should be more sexually restricted and only have sexual relations with men in the context of a committed relationship, whereas men may be sexually unrestricted if they wish. In more egalitarian societies, where men and women have equal access to power and money, the gender difference in sociosexuality is less pronounced, as individuals may take on the social role of the other gender.

<text>A flood myth or a deluge myth is a myth in which a great flood, usually sent by a deity or deities, destroys civilization, often in an act of divine retribution. Parallels are often drawn between the flood waters of these myths and the primeval waters which appear in certain creation myths, as the flood waters are described as a measure for the cleansing of humanity, in preparation for . Most flood myths also contain a culture hero, who &quot;represents the human craving for life&quot;.

The flood-myth motif occurs in many cultures, including the &quot;manvantara-sandhya&quot; in Hinduism, Deucalion and Pyrrha in Greek mythology, the Genesis flood narrative, the Mesopotamian flood stories, Cheyenne and Puebloan traditions.

==Mythologies==
One example of a flood myth is in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; (c. 2100–1800 BCE). This account is similar to the Akkadian &quot;Atra-Hasis&quot;, which dates to the 18th century BCE. In the Gilgamesh flood myth, the highest god, Enlil, decides to destroy the world with a flood because humans have become too noisy. The god Ea, who had created humans out of clay and divine blood, secretly warns the hero Utnapishtim of the impending flood and gives him detailed instructions for building a boat so that life may survive. There is also the similar Eridu Genesis (), known from tablets found in the ruins of Nippur in the late 1890s and translated by assyriologist Arno Poebel.

Academic Yi Samuel Chen analyzed various texts from the Early Dynastic III Period through to the Old Babylonian Period, and argues that the flood narrative was only added in texts written during the Old Babylonian Period. With regard to the Sumerian King List, observations by experts have always indicated that the portion of the Sumerian King List talking about before the flood differs stylistically from the King List Proper. Old Babylonian copies tend to represent a tradition of before the flood apart from the actual King List, whereas the Ur III copy of the King List and the duplicate from the Brockmon collection indicate that the King List Proper once existed independent of mention of the flood and the tradition of before the flood. Chen gives evidence to prove that the section of before the flood and references to the flood in the Sumerian King List were all later additions added in during the Old Babylonian Period, as the Sumerian King List went through updates and edits. The flood as a watershed in early history of the world was probably a new historiographical concept emerging in the Mesopotamian literary traditions during the Old Babylonian Period, as evident by the fact that the flood motif did not show up in the Ur III copy and that earliest chronographical sources related to the flood show up in the Old Babylonian Period. Chen also concludes that the name of &quot;Ziusudra&quot; as a flood hero and the idea of the flood hinted at by that name in the Old Babylonian Version of &quot;Instructions of Shuruppak&quot; are only developments during that Old Babylonian Period, when also the didactic text was updated with information from the burgeoning Antediluvian Tradition.

In the Hebrew Genesis (9th century BC), the god Yahweh, who had created man out of the dust of the ground, decides to flood the earth because of the corrupted state of mankind. Yahweh then gives the protagonist, Noah, instructions to build an ark in order to preserve human and animal life. When the ark is completed, Noah, his family, and representatives of all the animals of the earth are called upon to enter the ark. When the destructive flood begins, all life outside of the ark perishes. After the waters recede, all those aboard the ark disembark and have Yahweh&#x27;s promise that he will never judge the earth with a flood again. Yahweh causes a rainbow to form as the sign of this promise.

In Hindu mythology, texts such as the Satapatha Brahmana ( 6th century BCE) and the Puranas contain the story of a great flood, &quot;manvantara-sandhya&quot;, wherein the Matsya Avatar of the Vishnu warns the first man, Manu, of the impending flood, and also advises him to build a giant boat. In Zoroastrian Mazdaism, Ahriman tries to destroy the world with a drought, which Mithra ends by shooting an arrow into a rock, from which a flood springs; one man survives in an ark with his cattle. Norbert Oettinger argues that the story of Yima and the &quot;Vara&quot; was originally a flood myth, and the harsh winter was added in due to the dry nature of Eastern Iran, as flood myths did not have as much of an effect as harsh winters. He has argued that the mention of melted water flowing in Videvdad 2.24 is a remnant of the flood myth, and mentions that the Indian flood myths originally had their protagonist as Yama, but it was changed to Manu later.

In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;, written , Timaeus describes a flood myth similar to the earlier versions. In it, the Bronze race of humans angers the high god Zeus with their constant warring. Zeus decides to punish humanity with a flood. The Titan Prometheus, who had created humans from clay, tells the secret plan to Deucalion, advising him to build an ark in order to be saved. After nine nights and days, the water starts receding and the ark lands on a mountain.

The Cheyenne, a North American Great Plains tribe, has a tradition where a flood altered the course of their history, perhaps occurring in the Missouri River Valley. The Hopi have a tradition of a flood that nearly reached the tops of the mountains, and other Puebloans have similar legends.

== Historicity ==

Floods in the wake of the Last Glacial Period (c. 115,000 – c. 11,700 years ago) are speculated to have inspired myths that survive to this day. Plato&#x27;s allegory of Atlantis is set over 9,000 years before his time, leading some scholars to suggest that a Stone Age society which lived close to the Mediterranean Sea could have been wiped out by the rising sea level, an event which could have served as the basis for the story.

Archaeologist Bruce Masse stated that some of the narratives of a great flood discovered in many cultures around the world may be linked to an oceanic asteroid impact that occurred between Africa and Antarctica, around the time of a solar eclipse, that caused a tsunami. Among the 175 myths he analyzed were a Hindu myth speaking of an alignment of the five planets at the time, and a Chinese story linking the flood to the end of the reign of Empress Nu Wa. Fourteen flood myths refer to a full solar eclipse. According to Masse these indications point to the date May 10, 2807 BC. His hypothesis suggests that a meteor or comet crashed into the Indian Ocean around 3000–2800 BCE, and created the undersea Burckle Crater and Fenambosy Chevron, and generated a giant tsunami that flooded coastal lands.

===Mesopotamia===

Mesopotamia, like other early sites of riverine civilisation, was flood-prone; and for those experiencing valley-wide inundations, flooding could destroy the whole of their known world. According to the excavation report of the 1930s excavation at Shuruppak (modern Tell Fara, Iraq), the Jemdet Nasr and Early Dynastic layers at the site were separated by a 60-cm yellow layer of alluvial sand and clay, indicating a flood, like that created by river avulsion, a process common in the Tigris–Euphrates river system. Similar layers have been recorded at other sites as well, all dating to different periods, which would be consistent with the nature of river avulsions.
Shuruppak in Mesopotamian legend was the city of Uta-napishtim, the king who built a boat to survive the coming flood. The alluvial layer dates from around 2900 BC.

The geography of the Mesopotamian area changed considerably with the filling of the Persian Gulf after sea waters rose following the last glacial period. Global sea levels were about lower around 18,000 BP and rose until 8,000 BP when they reached current levels, which are now an average above the floor of the Gulf, which was a huge () low-lying and fertile region in Mesopotamia, in which human habitation is thought to have been strong around the Gulf Oasis for 100,000 years. A sudden increase in settlements above the present-day water level is recorded at around 7,500 BP.

===Mediterranean Basin===
The historian Adrienne Mayor theorizes that global flood stories may have been inspired by ancient observations of seashells and fish fossils in inland and mountain areas. The ancient Greeks, Egyptians, and Romans all documented the discovery of such remains in such locations; the Greeks hypothesized that Earth had been covered by water on several occasions, citing the seashells and fish fossils found on mountain tops as evidence of this idea.

Speculation regarding the Deucalion myth has postulated a large tsunami in the Mediterranean Sea, caused by the Thera eruption (with an approximate geological date of 1630–1600 BCE), as the myth&#x27;s historical basis. Although the tsunami hit the South Aegean Sea and Crete, it did not affect cities in the mainland of Greece, such as Mycenae, Athens, and Thebes, which continued to prosper, indicating that it had a local rather than a region-wide effect.
====Black Sea deluge hypothesis====
The Black Sea deluge hypothesis offers a controversial account of long-term flooding; the hypothesis argues for a catastrophic irruption of water about 5600 BCE from the Mediterranean Sea into the Black Sea basin. This has become the subject of considerable discussion. The Younger Dryas impact hypothesis offered another proposed natural explanation for flood myths. However, this idea was similarly controversial and has been refuted.

=== Comets ===
The earliest known hypothesis about a comet that had a widespread effect on human populations can be attributed to Edmond Halley, who in 1694 suggested that a worldwide flood had been the result of a near-miss by a comet. The issue was taken up in more detail by William Whiston, a protégé of and popularizer of the theories of Isaac Newton, who argued in his book &quot;A New Theory of the Earth&quot; (1696) that a comet encounter was the probable cause of the Biblical Flood of Noah in 2342 BCE. Whiston also attributed the origins of the atmosphere and other significant changes in the Earth to the effects of comets.

In Pierre-Simon Laplace&#x27;s book &quot;Exposition Du Systême Du Monde&quot; (&quot;The System of the World&quot;), first published in 1796, he stated:

A similar hypothesis was popularized by Minnesota congressman and pseudoarchaeology writer Ignatius L. Donnelly in his book &quot;&quot; (1883), which followed his better-known book &quot;&quot; (1882). In &quot;Ragnarok&quot;, Donnelly argued that an enormous comet struck the Earth around 6,000 BCE to 9,000 BCE, destroying an advanced civilization on the &quot;lost continent&quot; of Atlantis. Donnelly, following others before him, attributed the Biblical Flood to this event, which he hypothesized had also resulted in catastrophic fires and climate change. Shortly after the publication of &quot;Ragnarok&quot;, one commenter noted, &quot;Whiston ascertained that the deluge of Noah came from a comet&#x27;s tail; but Donnelly has outdone Whiston, for he has shown that our planet has suffered not only from a cometary flood, but from cometary fire, and a cometary rain of stones.&quot;

<text>Pandanales, the pandans or screw-pines, is an order of flowering plants placed in the monocot clade in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group and Angiosperm Phylogeny Web systems. Within the monocots Pandanales are grouped in the lilioid monocots where they are in a sister group relationship with the Dioscoreales. Historically the order has consisted of a number of different families in different systems but modern classification of the order is based primarily on molecular phylogenetics despite diverse morphology which previously placed many of the families in other groupings based on apparent similarity. Members of the order have a subtropical distribution and includes trees, shrubs, and vines as well as herbaceous plants. The order consists of 5 families, 36 genera and about 1,610 species.

==Description ==

Pandanales are highly diverse including large arboraceous plants of tropical rainforests and coastal areas, climbing vines and lianas, as well as very small achlorophyllous (mycoheterotrophic) and saprophytic herbaceous forest floor species. This has made it difficult to reliably define synapomorphies, but the loss of trimery distinguishes many of them from other lilioid monocots.

The Pandanales order is distinctive with its highly variable and hardly definable floral morphology, especially the number of stamens and their structure as well as many other characteristics. In some of the members, different interpretations exist regarding the composition and organization of the reproductive structures.

The order includes plants with traits that seem atypical when compared to other groups of monocots. A good example is the female reproductive organ and its position relative to other parts of the flower. Some of the species included in the families Pandanaceae and Stemonaceae show flowers formed from only one carpel, while in the Triuridaceae, a family that lacks chlorophyll, the carpels are free from each other. In fact, the Triuridaceae possess the least &quot;typical&quot; flower morphology in the order.

==Taxonomy ==

===History ===
The components of the order &quot;sensu&quot; APG have been difficult to place consistently, and historically have been associated with a number of other groupings. The Bentham &amp; Hooker system (1883) had a similar order under the name Nudifloreae, incorporating:
* Pandaneae
* Cyclanthaceae
* Typhaceae
* Aroideae
* Lemnaceae

The Wettstein system (1935) placed the order in class Monocotyledones and used a different circumscription, incorporating:
* Pandanaceae
* Sparganiaceae
* Typhaceae

The Cronquist system (1981) placed the order in subclass Arecidae in class Liliopsida [=monocotyledons] with only one family:
* Pandanaceae

In the classification system of Dahlgren the Pandanales were in the superorder Pandaniflorae (also called Pandananae) with the single family Pandanaceae.

=== Angiosperm Phylogeny Group ===
The APG III system (2009) places the Pandanales in the monocots. Both the APG III and APG II systems include five families in this order.
Since the morphology of the order varies on such scale, its classification and phylogeny are based on genetic analyses.

Inside the order, some doubt remains about the position of the entirely mycoheterotrophic family Triuridaceae, since it is the only one on which genetic analyses have not yet been applied. With high probability, the family may be sister to the Velloziaceae, but similarities with the family Zingiberaceae (which is a part of a whole different order – Zingiberales) do not exclude the chance for a different phylogeny. The family Velloziaceae on its own is placed at the base of the tree. The Pandanaceae and Cyclanthaceae are sister groups, and they form a clade which on its own is sister to the Stemonaceae (a family composed of two more clades).

=== Evolution ===
The order Dioscoreales holds sister relationship with Pandanales by diverging from them around 121 million years ago in the mid-Cretaceous. The formation of the crown groups took place with a difference of 2 million years between the orders - 116 Mya for the Dioscoreales and 114 Mya for the Pandanales.
However, the stem group of the Pandanales is much older and goes back to 130 Mya in the early Cretaceous.

=== Phylogeny ===
=== Subdivision ===
The composition of the order in APG III and APG II were slightly from that in the 1998 APG system, which used the circumscription
* Cyclanthaceae
* Pandanaceae
* Stemonaceae
* Velloziaceae

APG III includes the following families;
* Cyclanthaceae
* Pandanaceae
* Stemonaceae
* Triuridaceae
* Velloziaceae

==Distribution==
The order contains members mainly distributed in all the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, both New and Old World (including Africa, South America, Australia and Asia). Also, a species is present in China.

== Ecology==

The species are members of various ecological groups, including tropical shrubs, lianas and trees, xerophytic plants, mycoheterotrophs, as well as different herbaceous representatives.

== Uses ==
Several species in this order produce strap-like leaves used for basketry and mats; &quot;Pandanus&quot; (Pandanaceae) is used across Oceania for thatch, basketry, and to make cloth, and &quot;Carludovica palmata&quot; (Cyclanthaceae) leaves are made into Panama hats. Other members as &quot;Stemona&quot; are present in traditional Chinese medicine and possess medical properties. Some species are used as insecticides. Some species of &quot;Pandanus&quot; are used as ornamentals. &quot;Pandanus amaryllifolius&quot; is a common food flavoring in Southeast Asia and karuka (&quot;Pandanus julianettii&quot;) is a staple food in New Guinea.

<text>Rudy Hartono Kurniawan (born Nio Hap Liang (); 18 August 1949) is an Indonesian former badminton player holding the record of winning the men&#x27;s singles title at the All-England Championship eight times, including seven times consecutively from 1968 to 1974. He won the World Championship in 1980 on his only attempt at this title. He is one of the most famous players in the history of the sport and is considered to be one of the greatest badminton players of all time.

==Early life==
Hartono was born on 18 August 1949 as Nio Hap Liang in Surabaya. He is the son of Zulkarnain Kurniawan and the third child of eight siblings in the family. His sister Utami Dewi is a five-time national badminton champion and former Indonesia Uber Cup team member. The family lived in Jalan Basuki Rachmat and owned tailoring and dairy farming businesses. The young Hartono embraced many types of sports, including athletics, swimming, volleyball, football, and roller skating, but his athletic path soon led him towards badminton.

At age 11, Hartono started formal badminton training under the tutelage of his father. He would train for almost the entire day in a small badminton club set up by his father in a railway station warehouse. In 1961, he entered his first tournament at the Surabaya&#x27;s junior championship when he was 12 and won. After leaving his father&#x27;s club, Hartono would later play for the much bigger Rajawali Club where many good Indonesian badminton players were trained. At age 15, he won the national junior championship. While competing in municipal tournaments, the teenage Hartono soon caught the eye of the national scouts and was drafted into the National Training Center in late 1965 to help the national team in the upcoming Thomas Cup.

==Badminton career==
As a member of the 1967 Thomas Cup squad, Hartono won all of his matches, but Indonesia was beaten by Malaysia in a highly controversial final in which play was suspended due to the unruly crowd. Both teams were later offered a chance to resume their clash in New Zealand but Indonesia declined, thus handing Malaysia the cup.

A year later, on his first try at the All England Championships, the 18-year-old Hartono became the youngest ever champion of the tournament, beating Tan Aik Huang from Malaysia who had been the winner two years earlier. From then on, he dominated the event like very few had before, winning seven titles consecutively from 1968 to 1974. In 1975, in search of his eighth consecutive title and the chance to break Erland Kops’s record of seven, Hartono would once again face the challenge of his archrival, Svend Pri, who he had beaten before in the 1970 and 1972 finals, but this time he was not able to fend off the Dane’s attack and fell to a 11–15, 14–17 defeat. Hartono, however, came back the following year to win his eighth title against his compatriot Liem Swie King thus becoming the most successful men’s singles player in the history of the tournament. His eight titles at the All England also earned Hartono a mention in the Guinness Book of Records. In 1978, Hartono would return to try his hand for a ninth title, but he could not overcome Liem Swie King and lost 10–15, 3–15 in the final. He attempted another comeback in 1981, but lost in the semi-finals to Prakash Padukone in a three sets battle, 15–10, 7–15, 8–15.

Besides his All England success, Hartono won many international open titles throughout his career. In 1969, he won the Canadian and the US Open titles after defeating Sture Johnsson and his compatriot Muljadi in the respective finals. In the same year, he also won both the Singapore Open men&#x27;s singles and doubles titles. He defeated Muljadi in the singles final and partnered with Indratno to beat Lee Wah Chin and Yeo Ah Seng in the doubles final. In 1971, he won his second Canadian Open title and clinched his first Denmark Open title after defeating Ippei Kojima on both occasions. He also competed in the Western Indian Championship that year and won a hat trick of titles, beating Muljadi in the men&#x27;s singles final, partnered with Indra Gunawan to beat Muljadi and Sumiratta in the men&#x27;s doubles final and partnered with Rafia Latif to beat Indra Gunawan and Sunila Ape in the mixed doubles final. In 1973 and 1975, Hartono won his second and third Denmark Open titles after beating Flemming Delfs and Svend Pri respectively. In 1981, he would win his maiden Japan Open title after beating his compatriot Lius Pongoh in the final.

Hartono also had some success in major games. At the 1970 Asian Games held in Bangkok, he won gold in the men&#x27;s team event and two bronze in the men&#x27;s doubles and mixed doubles events. In 1971, he would win another gold at the Asian Championships where Indonesia defeated Malaysia in the men&#x27;s team final. In the 1972 Munich Games in which badminton was presented as a demonstration sport, Hartono won the men’s singles event, after beating Jamie Paulson of Canada in the first round, Sture Johnsson of Sweden in the semi-finals, and Svend Pri of Denmark in the final. In his attempt to win an &#x27;official&#x27; world championships, Hartono participated in the 1980 IBF World Championships held in Jakarta and managed to reach the final where he would meet his successor Liem Swie King. In a final that lacked intensity, Hartono prevailed in two straight games with the score of 15–9, 15–9.

Since his debut in 1967, Hartono remained active in the Thomas Cup competition and continued to play for his country at the event from 1970 to 1982. The 1970, 1973, 1976, and 1979 Thomas Cup would turn out to be a resounding success for Hartono and his team, with Indonesia sweeping four straight titles. At the 1982 Thomas Cup Finals, the aging Hartono once again answered the call of his nation but his play was not on par with his previous performances and he was not able to help his team to prevent China from winning their first ever Thomas Cup title. Hartono’s defeat in the third singles to Luan Jin was only his second defeat in the competition with the first coming in 1973 when he lost against his long-time nemesis Svend Pri. After the competition, Hartono announced his retirement, saying &quot;I believe I have to retire now... Actually, I was already retired. But this was the Thomas Cup and my country needed me and because I live in Indonesia and I love Indonesia, I must do what they ask.&quot;

==Post-retirement==
Hartono became involved with the Indonesian Badminton Association (PBSI), holding different positions such as Chairman of Development Affairs until 2006. He is currently a member of PBSI’s Board of Honour. Hartono also played an active role within the Badminton World Federation (BWF). He was a member of the Council in 1985-1986, and later from 1994 to 2009. Hartono’s image and reputation led the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to appoint him as a Goodwill Ambassador for Indonesia.

Hartono who attended the Economics Faculty of Trisakti University, Jakarta, also began to expand his business after his retirement. He ventured into dairy business in Sukabumi and also the sports equipment business by acting as an agent for brands such as Mikasa, Ascot and Yonex. Then through PT Havilah Citra Footwear founded in 1996, he imported various kinds of sportswear.

==Personal life==
Hartono married Jane Anwar in 1976 and they have two children, a son (Christopher) and a daughter (Christine).

In the late 70s and early 80s, age began to catch up to Hartono and he started losing matches. This resulted in his depression. He credits a preacher for his &quot;conversion experience&quot; to Christianity during his mid-30s. Later, the death of Svend Pri in 1983 prompted Hartono to preach about Jesus to others. In 1988, Hartono had coronary bypass surgery in Australia. Since 1989, Hartono has been extremely active with his church ministry. In 2001, Hartono became associate pastor of Bethel Church in Jakarta, Indonesia.

A film lover, Hartono once starred in an Indonesian movie titled &quot;Matinja Seorang Bidadari&quot; (Death of An Angel) in 1971.

Hartono also had a wax sculpture in his likeness at the Madame Tussauds museum in Singapore.

<doc id="601859" wikidata="Q5190021" url="?curid=601859" title="Cruller">
<text>A cruller () is a deep-fried pastry popular in parts of Europe and North America. In Europe it is typically either made of a string of dough that is folded over and twisted twice to create its signature shape or is formed from a rectangle of dough with a cut in the center allowing it to be pulled over and through itself to produce distinctive twists in the sides of the pastry. In North America, it is typically a form of cake doughnut made in a small loaf or simple stick shape or, in the case of the &quot;French cruller&quot;, extruded in a ring from choux pastry. 

Crullers are typically topped with cinnamon sugar, dipped in plain icing, or served plain.

== History ==
The name &quot;cruller&quot; comes from the early 19th-century Dutch , from &#x27;to curl&#x27;. In northern Germany they are known as (&#x27;deer horns&#x27;). In Scandinavia, these types of crullers are common at Christmas. They are traditionally baked on New Year&#x27;s Eve as a family project, with the children doing the labor-intensive shaping and the grown-ups handling the deep frying. In Danish they are known as &quot;klejner&quot; and in Swedish as &quot;klenäter&quot;, both names deriving from Low German. 

In the United States, crullers were introduced in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by Pennsylvania Dutch settlers, and became popular in regions with large German populations. The Milwaukee-style cruller, for example, is a loaf-shaped glazed cake doughnut with a crunchy exterior.

The term &quot;Chinese cruller&quot; is occasionally applied to the youtiao (), a similar-looking fried dough food eaten in East and Southeast Asia. The term cruller is also associated with the mahua (), a type of twisted fried dough much denser and sweeter than youtiao.

The &quot;Aberdeen crulla&quot; is a traditional Scottish pastry made in the same way as the rectangular, plaited cruller of New England. It is first attested in Edinburgh in 1829 and is thought to copied from the &#x27;cruller&#x27; of the United States according to the Scottish National Dictionary (1931–1976). Distinct from this, the &quot;yum-yum&quot; is a commonly available treat in the United Kingdom, which resembles a straightened French cruller coated in thin glacé icing.

==French cruller==
A French cruller is a light airy, fluted, ring-shaped glazed doughnut extruded from choux pastry. The name likely refers to the use of the French choux dough, with the actual origin of the pastry being German or Dutch, and was popularized in the United States by Dunkin&#x27; Donuts. When filled, they are often referred to as a chouxnut.

The French cruller is similar to the German &quot;Spritzkuchen&quot; (), which is traditionally made from choux pastry that is piped onto parchment and then deep fried. It dates back to 18th century Nuremberg, but became associated with Eberswalde in the 19th century. It is said to have originated as part of carnival celebrations that take place before Lent to use up supplies of animal fats so they would not spoil and go to waste.

==Availability==
Crullers are most commonly found in Canada, New England, the Mid-Atlantic and North Central states of the United States; they are also common in California. The German origin is probably why traditional crullers can be found more easily in the Midwest, where many German immigrants settled. Some family-owned bakeries still call them &quot;krullers.&quot;

In 2003, the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts chain of doughnut shops stopped carrying traditional crullers, claiming that the hand-shaped rectangular treats were too labor-intensive, and couldn&#x27;t be simulated with new machines for mixing doughnut batter. 
In its place some, of the chain’s franchises offered a simplified, machine-made rectangular version called a &quot;cake stick&quot;.
As of 2003, the company still sold &quot;French crullers&quot;, which can be formed by a kind of extruding nozzle similar to the way choux pastry is piped.

French crullers have been gaining popularity in the UK, Australia, and the USA, with specific mentions of Cardabelle in the UK, Moon Cruller in Australia, and Deli Provision in the USA. In the southeastern U.S., French crullers are a fresh-baked everyday bakery item at many donut shops and grocery stores. In 1973, the French cruller became available in Mister Donut stores in Japan.

Tim Hortons and Honey Dew Donuts sell only the French cruller, not crullers. Krispy Kreme sell a similar doughnut the company refers to as a cruller, but is a molded/formed cake doughnut.

<doc id="601865" wikidata="Q5123985" url="?curid=601865" title="City of Westminster Magistrates' Court">
<text>The City of Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court was a magistrates&#x27; court located at 70 Horseferry Road, in the City of Westminster, London. It was originally called Horseferry Road Magistrates&#x27; Court, after the road in which it was sited. However, it was renamed in July 2006 following the closure of Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court. It served as the court where the Chief Magistrate of England and Wales sat, and all extradition and terrorism-related cases passed through the court. The court closed permanently on 22 September 2011, and was replaced on 27 September 2011 with Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court, built on the site of Marylebone Magistrates&#x27; Court at 181 Marylebone Road.

The court pictured has since been demolished, and replaced with a development of flats.

==History==

The court building, designed by C. A. Legerton and opened in 1974, was functional and &quot;of minimal personality and minimal expression of function and purpose&quot;, according to Pevsner. It was opened as one of a series of three larger court houses, with the others at Camberwell Green and Highbury Corner. It had four courtrooms as opened and a further two were added later. The central location and proximity to New Scotland Yard caused the court to be involved in a number of high-profile cases.

<text>Cyprian Kamil Norwid (; – 23 May 1883) was a Polish poet, dramatist, painter, sculptor, and philosopher. He is now considered one of the four most important Polish Romantic poets, though scholars still debate whether he is more aptly described as a late romantic or an early modernist.

Norwid led a tragic, often poverty-stricken life. He experienced mounting health problems, unrequited love, harsh critical reviews, and increasing social isolation. For most of his life he lived abroad, having left Polish lands in his twenties. Having briefly travelled across Western Europe in his youth, and briefly travelling to United States, where he worked as an illustrator, he lived chiefly in Paris, where he eventually died.

Considered a &quot;rising star&quot; in his youth, Norwid&#x27;s original, nonconformist style was not appreciated in his lifetime. Partly due to this, he was excluded from high society. His work was rediscovered and appreciated only after his death by the Young Poland movement of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Today his most influential work is considered to be &quot;Vade-mecum&quot;, a vast anthology of verse he finished in 1866. Much of his work, including &quot;Vade-mecum&quot;, remained unpublished during his lifetime.

==Life==

=== Youth ===
Cyprian Norwid was born on 24 September 1821 into a family of Polish–Lithuanian minor nobility bearing the Topór coat of arms, in the Masovian village of Laskowo-Głuchy near Warsaw, His father was a minor government official. One of his maternal ancestors was the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania John III Sobieski.

Cyprian Norwid and his brother were orphaned early. His mother died when Cyprian was four years old, and in 1835 his father also died: Norwid was 14 at the time. For most of their childhood, Cyprian and his brother were educated at Warsaw schools. In 1836 Norwid interrupted his schooling (not having completed the fifth grade) and entered a private school of painting, studying under Aleksander Kokular and . His incomplete formal education forced him to become an autodidact, and eventually he learned a dozen languages.

Norwid&#x27;s first foray into the literary sphere occurred in the periodical &quot;Piśmiennictwo Krajowe&quot;, which published his first poem, &quot;Mój ostatni sonet&quot; (&quot;My Last Sonnet&quot;), in 1840s issue 8. That year he published ten poems and one short story. His early poems were well received by critics and he became a welcome guest at the literary salons of Warsaw; his personality of that time is described as that of a &quot;dandy&quot; and a &quot;rising star&quot; of the young generation of Polish poets. In 1841-1842 he travelled through the Congress Poland with .

=== Europe ===
In 1842 Norwid received inheritance funds as well as a private scholarship to study sculpture and left Poland, never to return. First he went to Dresden in Germany. He later also visited Venice and Florence in Italy; in Florence he signed up for a course in sculpture at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze. His visit to Verona resulted in a well-received poem &quot;&quot; (&quot;In Verona&quot;) published several years later. After he settled in Rome in 1844, where for several years he became a regular at Caffè Greco, his fiancée Kamila broke off their engagement. Later he met Maria Kalergis, née Nesselrode; they became acquaintances, but his courtship of her, and later, of her lady-in-waiting, Maria Trebicka, ended in failure. The poet then travelled to Berlin, where he participated in university lectures and meetings with local &quot;Polonia&quot;. It was a time when Norwid made many new social, artistic and political contacts. At that time he also lost his Russian passport, and after he refused to join the Russian diplomatic service, the Russian authorities confiscated his estate. He was also arrested for trying to cross back to Russia without his passport, and his short stay in Berlin prison resulted in partial deafness. After being forced to leave Prussia in 1846, Norwid went to Brussels. During the European Revolutions of 1848, he stayed in Rome, where he met fellow Polish intellectuals Adam Mickiewicz and Zygmunt Krasiński.

During 1849–1852, Norwid lived in Paris, where he met fellow Poles Frédéric Chopin and Juliusz Słowacki, as well as other emigree artists such as Russians Ivan Turgenev and Alexander Herzen, and other intellectuals such as Jules Michelet (many at Emma Herwegh&#x27;s salon). Financial hardship, unrequited love, political misunderstandings, and a negative critical reception of his works put Norwid in a dire situation. He lived in poverty, sometimes forced to work as a simple manual laborer. He also suffered from progressive blindness and deafness, but still managed to publish some content in the Polish-language Parisian publication &quot;Goniec polski&quot; and similar venues. 1849 saw several of his poems published, those included among others his &#x27; (&quot;Social Song&quot;). Some of his other notable works from that period include the drama &#x27; and the philosophical poem-treaty about the nature of art, &#x27;, both published in 1851. &quot;Promethidion&quot;, a long treatise on aesthetics in verse, has been called &quot;the first important piece of Norwid&#x27;s writing&quot;. It was, however, not well received by contemporary critics. That year also saw him finishing the manuscripts for the dramas &#x27; and &quot;&quot; and the poem &quot;Bema pamięci żałobny rapsod&quot; (&quot;A Funeral Rhapsody in Memory of General Bem&quot;).

=== United States ===
Norwid decided to emigrate to the United States in the Fall of 1852, receiving some sponsorship from Wladysław Zamoyski, a Polish nobleman and philanthropist. On 11 February 1853, after a harrowing journey, he arrived in New York City aboard the &quot;Margaret Evans&quot;, and he held a number of odd jobs there, including at a graphics firm. He was involved in the creation of the memorial album of the Crystal Palace Exhibition and the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations. By autumn, he learned about the outbreak of the Crimean War. This, as well as his disappointment with America, which he felt lacked &quot;history&quot;, made him consider a return to Europe, and he wrote to Mickiewicz and Herzen, asking for their assistance.

=== Back in Paris ===
During April 1854, Norwid returned to Europe with Prince . He lived in England and with Krasiński&#x27;s help he was finally able to return to Paris by December that year. Over the next few years Norwid was able to publish several works, such as the poem &#x27; (&quot;Quidam. A Story,&quot; 1857) and stories collected in &#x27; (&quot;Black Flowers&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;White Flowers&quot;), published in &#x27; in 1856–1857. He gave a well-received series of six lectures on Juliusz Słowacki in 1860, published the next year. 1862 saw the publication of some of his poems in an anthology &quot;Poezje&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;) at Brockhaus in Leipzig. He took a very keen interest in the outbreak of the 1863 January Uprising (a Polish–Lithuanian revolt against the Russian Empire). Although he could not participate personally due to his poor health, Norwid hoped to personally influence the outcome of the event by establishing a newspaper or magazine; that project however did not come to fruition. His 1865 &quot;&quot; (&quot;Chopin&#x27;s Piano&quot;) is seen as one of his works reacting to the January Uprising. The poem&#x27;s theme is the Russian troops&#x27; 1863 defenestration of Chopin&#x27;s piano from the music school Norwid attended in his youth. 

Norwid continued writing, but most of his work met with little recognition. He grew to accept this, and even wrote in one his works that &quot;the sons pass by this writing, but you, my distant grandchild, will read it... when I&#x27;ll be no more&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;The Hands Were Swollen by Clapping...&quot;, 1858).

In 1866, the poet finished his work on &quot;Vade-mecum&quot;, a vast anthology of verse. However, despite his greatest efforts it could not be published until decades later. One of the reasons for this included Prince Władysław Czartoryski failing to grant the poet the loan he had promised. In subsequent years, Norwid lived in extreme poverty and suffered from tuberculosis. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, many of his friends and patrons were distracted with the global events: Norwid experienced starvation, and his health further deteriorated. Material hardships did not stop him from writing: in 1869 he wrote &#x27; (&quot;A Poem About the Freedom of the Word&quot;), a long treatise in verse about the history of words, which was well received at that time. The next year he wrote &#x27;, a poem reflecting his views on Christian love, which Hungarian poet George Gömöri called Norwid&#x27;s &quot;most successful narrative poem&quot;. Those years also saw him write three more plays, comedies &#x27; (&quot;Actor. Comedy-drama&quot;, 1867), &#x27; (&quot;Behind the Scenes&quot;, 1865–1866), and &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Ring of a Grand Lady&quot;, 1872), which Gömöri praised as Norwid&#x27;s &quot;real genre within the theater&quot;. The latter play became Norwid&#x27;s most frequently performed theater piece, although like many of his works, it gained recognition long after his death (published in print in 1933, and staged in 1936).

In 1877 his cousin, relocated Norwid to the (Œuvre de Saint Casimir) on the outskirts of Paris in Ivry. That location, run by Polish nuns, was home to many destitute Polish emigrants. There, Norwid was befriended by Teodor Jełowicki who also gave him material support. Some of his final works include a comedy play &#x27; (&quot;Pure Love at Sea Baths&quot;, 1880), the philosophical treatesie &#x27; (&quot;Silence&quot;, 1882), and novels &quot;&quot; (written c. 1881–83), &quot;Stygmat&quot; (&quot;Stigmata&quot;, 1881–82) and &quot;Tajemnica lorda Singelworth&quot; (&quot;The Secret of Lord Singelworth&quot;, 1883). Throughout his life, he also wrote many letters, over a thousand of which survived to be studied by scholars.

During the last months of his life, Norwid was weak and bed-ridden. He frequently wept and refused to speak with anyone. He died in the morning of 23 May 1883. Jełowicki and Kleczkjowski personally covered the burial costs, and Norwid&#x27;s funeral was also attended by Franciszek Duchiński and . After 15 years the funds to maintain his grave dried out and his body was moved to a mass grave of Polish emigrants.

== Themes and views ==
Norwid&#x27;s early style could be classified as belonging within the romanticism tradition, but it soon evolved beyond it. Some scholars consider Norwid to represent late romanticism, while others see him as an early modernist. Polish literary critics, , Tamara Trojanowska and Joanna Niżyńska described Norwid as &quot;a &#x27;late child&#x27; and simultaneously a great critic of Romanticism&quot; and &quot;the first post-Romantic poet [of Poland]&quot;. Danuta Borchardt who translated some of Norwid&#x27;s poems to English wrote that &quot;Norwid&#x27;s work belongs to late Romanticism. However, he was so original that scholars cannot pigeonhole his work into any specific literary period&quot;. Czesław Miłosz, a Polish poet and Nobel laureate, wrote that &quot;[Norwid] preserved complete independence from the literary currents of the day&quot;. This could be seen in his short stories, which went against the common trend in the 19th century to write realistic prose and instead are more aptly described as &quot;modern parables&quot;.Critics and literary historians eventually concluded that during his life, Norwid was rejected by his contemporaries as his works were too unique. His style increasingly departing from then-prevailing forms and themes found in romanticism and positivism, and the subjects of his works were also often not aligned with the political views of the emigre Poles. His style was criticized for &quot;being obscure and overly cerebral&quot; and having a &quot;jarring syntax&quot;. Even today, a number of scholars refer to his works, in this context, as &quot;dark&quot;, meaning &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;difficult to understand&quot;.

While Norwid did not create neologisms, he would change words creating new variations of existing language, and he also experimented with syntax and punctuation, for example through the use of hyphenated words, which are uncommon in the Polish language. Much of his work is rhymed, although some is seen as a precursor to free verse that later became more common in Polish poetry. Miłosz noted that Norwid was &quot;against aestheticism&quot;, and that he aimed to &quot;break the monotony... of the syllabic pattern&quot;, purposefully making his verses &quot;roughhewn&quot;.

While Norwid displays a Romantic admiration for heroes, he almost never addresses the concept of romantic love. Norwid attempted to start new types of literary works, for example &quot;high comedy&quot; and &quot;bloodless white tragedy&quot;. His works are considered to be deeply philosophical and utilitarian, and he rejected &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot;. He is seen as a harsh critic of the Polish society as well as of mass culture. His portrayal of women characters has been praised as more developed than that of many of his contemporaries, whose female characters were more one-dimensional. Borchardt summarized his ideas as &quot;that of a man deeply distressed by and disappointed in mankind, yet hopeful of its eventual redemption&quot;. Miłosz pointed out that Norwid used irony (comparing his use of it to Jules Laforgue or T. S. Eliot), but it was &quot;so hidden within symbols and parables&quot; that it was often missed by most readers. He also argued that Norwid is &quot;undoubtedly... the most &#x27;intellectual&#x27; poet to ever write in Polish&quot;, although lack of audience has &quot;permitted him to indulge in such a torturing of the language that some of his lines are hopelessely obscure&quot;.

Norwid&#x27;s works featured more than purely Polish context, employing pan-European, Greco-Christian symbology. They also endorsed orthodox Christian, Roman Catholic views; in fact Gömöri argues that one of his major themes was &quot;the state and future of Christian civilization&quot;. Miłosz similarly noted that Norwid did not reject civilization, although he was critical of some of its aspects; he saw history as a story of progress &quot;to make martyrdom unnecessary on Earth&quot;. Historical references are common in Norwid&#x27;s work, which Miłosz describes as affected by &quot;intense historicism&quot;. Norwid&#x27;s stay in America also made him a supporter of the abolitionist movement, and in 1859 he wrote two poems about John Brown &quot;Do obywatela Johna Brown&quot; (&quot;To Citizen John Brown&quot;) and &quot;John Brown&quot;. Another recurring motif in his work was the importance of labor, particularly in the context of artistic work, with his discussions of issues such as how artists should be compensated in the capitalistic society - although Miłosz noted that Norwid was not a socialist.

Norwid&#x27;s work has also been treated as deeply philosophical. Miłosz also noted that some consider Norwid to be a philosopher more than an artist, and indeed Norwid has inspired, among others, philosophers such as Stanisław Brzozowski. Nonetheless, Miłosz disagrees with that notion, quoting Mieczysław Jastrun who wrote that Norwid was &quot;first of all, an artist, but an artist for whom the most interesting material is thought, reflection, the cultural experience of mankind&quot;.

== Legacy and commemoration ==
Following his death, many of Norwid&#x27;s works were forgotten; it was not until the early 20th century, in the Young Poland period, that his finesse and style was appreciated. At that time, his work was discovered and popularised by Zenon Przesmycki, a Polish poet and literary critic who was a member of the Polish Academy of Literature. Przesmycki started republishing Norwid&#x27;s works c. 1897, and created an enduring image of him, one of &quot;the dramatic legend of the cursed poet&quot;.

Norwid&#x27;s &quot;Collected Works&quot; (&quot;Dzieła Zebrane&quot;) were published in 1966 by , a Norwid biographer and commentator. The full iconic collection of Norwid&#x27;s work was released during the period 1971–76 as &quot;Pisma Wszystkie&quot; (&quot;Collected Works&quot;). Comprising 11 volumes, it includes all of Norwid&#x27;s poetry as well as his letters and reproductions of his artwork.

On 24 September 2001, 118 years after his death, an urn with soil from the collective grave where Norwid had been interred in Paris&#x27; Montmorency cemetery was buried in the &quot;&quot; at Wawel Cathedral. There, Norwid&#x27;s remains were placed next to those of fellow Polish poets Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki. During a mass held at the cathedral, the Archbishop of Kraków, cardinal Franciszek Macharski said that the doors of the crypt have opened &quot;to receive the great poet, Cyprian Norwid, into Wawel&#x27;s royal cathedral, for he was an equal of kings&quot;.

In 2021, on the 200th anniversary of Norwid&#x27;s birth, the brothers Stephen and Timothy Quay produced a short film titled &quot;Vade-mecum&quot; about the poet&#x27;s life and work in an attempt to promote his legacy among foreign audiences.

Norwid is often considered the fourth more important poet of the Polish romanticism, and called the Fourth of the Three Bards. In fact, some literary critics of the late 20th-century Poland were skeptical as to the value of Krasiński&#x27;s work and considered Norwid to be the &quot;Third&quot; bard instead of &quot;Fourth&quot;. Well known in Poland, and a part of Polish school&#x27;s curricula, Norwid nonetheless remains obscure in English-speaking world. He has been praised as the best poet of the 19th century by Joseph Brodsky and Tomas Venclova. Miłosz notes he has become recognized as a &quot;precusor of modern Polish poetry&quot;.

The life and work of Norwid have been subject to a number of scholarly treatments. Those include the English-language collection of essays about him, published after a 1983 conference held to commemorate century since his death (&quot;Cyprian Norwid (1821-1883): Poet - Thinker - Craftsman&quot;, 1988) or monographs such as &#x27;s (2016) &quot;Cyprian Norwid. Poeta wieku dziewiętnastego&quot; (&quot;Cyprian Norwid. A Poet of the Nineteenth Century&quot;). An academic journal dedicated to the study of Norwid, &quot;&quot;, has been published since 1983.

== Works ==

Norwid authored numerous works, from poems, both epic and short, to plays, short stories, essays and letters. During his lifetime, according to Miłosz and Gömöri, he published only one large volume of poetry (in 1862) (although Borchardt mentions another volume from 1866). Borchardt considers his major works to be &quot;Vade-mecum&quot;, &quot;Promethidion&quot; and &quot;Ad leones!&quot;. Miłosz acknowledged &quot;Vade-mecum&quot; as Norwid&#x27;s most influential work, but also praised the earlier &quot;Bema pamięci rapsod żałobny&quot; as one of his most famous poems.

Norwid&#x27;s most extensive work,&quot;Vade-mecum&quot;, written between 1858 and 1865, was first published a century after his death. Some of Norwid&#x27;s works have been translated into English by Walter Whipple and Danuta Borchardt in the United States of America, and by Jerzy Pietrkiewicz and Adam Czerniawski in Britain. A number have also received translations to other languages, such as Bengali, French, German, Italian, Russian, Slovakian and Ukrainian.

From May 2024, an autograph copy of &quot;Vade-mecum&quot; is presented at a permanent exhibition in the Palace of the Commonwealth. There are also presented two albums &quot;Orbis I&quot; and &quot;Orbis II&quot;, containing Norwid&#x27;s original works and copies of works in various media, in addition to hand written notes, magazine cuttings and photographs.

<doc id="601867" wikidata="Q1141056" url="?curid=601867" title="Crosley">
<text>Crosley was a small, independent American manufacturer of economy cars or subcompact cars, bordering on microcars. At first called the Crosley Corporation and later Crosley Motors Incorporated, the Cincinnati, Ohio, firm was active from 1939 to 1952, interrupted by World War II production. Their station wagons were the most popular model, but also offered were sedans, pickups, convertibles, a sports car, and even a tiny jeep-like vehicle. For export, the cars were badged Crosmobile.

Crosley introduced several &quot;firsts&quot; in American automotive history, including the first affordable, mass-market car with an overhead camshaft engine in 1946; the first use of the term &#x27;Sport(s-) Utility&#x27; in 1947, for a 1948 model year convertible wagon; and the first American cars to be fitted with 4-wheel caliper type disc brakes, as well as America&#x27;s first post-war sports car, the Hotshot, in the 1949 model year.

All of Crosley&#x27;s models were lightweight () body-on-frame cars with rigid axles front and rear, and engines with less than displacement. With exception of the late introduced Hotshot and Farm-O-Road models, the vast majority of all Crosleys were built on an wheelbase, and with leaf-springs.

==History==

Powel Crosley Jr. made his fortune in the automotive parts and accessories business, before diversifying into manufacturing other consumer products and Crosley automobiles in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1925 his company became the largest manufacturer of radios in the world. The financial success of his manufacturing and radio broadcasting businesses provided the funds for Crosley to pursue his lifelong interest in manufacturing automobiles. He introduced the first Crosley compact car in 1939.

During World War II the Crosley company discontinued civilian automobile manufacturing and began production of war-time materials, including development of experimental vehicles. In 1946 Crosley resumed production of compact and subcompact vehicles at its facility in Marion, Indiana, in addition to introducing new models and innovations to its offerings. After gas rationing was discontinued and the Big Three car makers began producing larger cars, consumer interest in Crosley&#x27;s compact cars declined. The last Crosley car rolled off the assembly line on July 3, 1952, and the company focused on its other, more successful business ventures.

===Developer and company founder===

Industrialist Powel Crosley Jr. of Cincinnati, Ohio, owner of Crosley Broadcasting Corporation and the Cincinnati Reds baseball team, among other business interests, had ambitious plans to build subcompact cars. Crosley had built his first automobile at the age of twelve, and in 1907, at the age of twenty-one, formed Marathon Six Automotive in Connersville, Indiana. Crosley built a prototype of the &quot;Marathon Six,&quot; a six-cylinder automobile priced at US$1,700, which was at the low end of the luxury car market, but failed to fund its production.

After working for several auto manufacturers in Indianapolis and Muncie, Indiana, and several more failed attempts to manufacture his own cars, including a cycle car model, Crosley found success in manufacturing automobile accessories as cofounder with Ira J. Cooper of the American Automobile Accessory Company in 1916, and bought out Cooper’s interest in the company. By 1919, Crosley and his younger brother and business partner, Lewis M. Crosley, had sold more than $1 million in parts and were diversifying into other consumer products.


Crosley increased his fortune in the 1920s and 1930s by developing, manufacturing, and selling inexpensive radios, such as the &quot;Harko&quot;, the Crosley &quot;Pup&quot; and the &quot;Roamio&quot; models. The Crosley Radio Corporation became the world&#x27;s largest radio manufacturer in 1925. It expanded operations at Camp Washington, a Cincinnati neighborhood, and began commercial radio broadcasting with WLW radio, considered &quot;the Nation&#x27;s Station.&quot; Crosley&#x27;s company also introduced new consumer products and home appliances in the 1930s, including the &quot;Shelvador,&quot; a refrigerator that had shelves in the doors, and other product innovations. The wealth that Crosley amassed from sales of these products provided the funds to diversify into other areas, including automobile manufacturing.

===First Crosley automobiles===
Beginning in the late 1930s Crosley developed low-priced compact cars and other pint-size vehicles. The first experimental prototype of the Crosley car was the 1937 CRAD (for Crosley Radio Auto Division) that had an rear track. With the assistance of his brother, Lewis, a graduate engineer, Crosley also designed assembly plants for his manufacturing operations at Richmond and Marion, Indiana.

On April 28, 1939, the first Crosley production car debuted at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to mixed reviews. It was a two-door convertible that weighed under . Initially offered at US$325 for a two-passenger coupe or $350 for a four-passenger sedan, the Crosley cars were cheaper than the nearest competition, the American Austin Car Company&#x27;s American Bantam, which sold for $449 to $565.

The Crosley car&#x27;s chassis had an wheelbase and used beam axles with leaf-springs (half-elliptic springs in front, and quarter-elliptic springs in the rear). Under the hood, a gravity-fed fuel-tank mounted above the motor made it possible for the car to operate without a fuel pump. The engine was a small, air-cooled Waukesha two-cylinder boxer, much like that of the Citroen 2CV, and had a fan as an integral part of the flywheel. The engine was connected to a three-speed transmission that provided power directly via a torque tube to the rear axle, eliminating the need for joints. This arrangement was judged unreliable, and conventional universal joints were fitted starting in 1941.

Production for 1939 was 2,017 units; however, only 422 cars were built in 1940. For 1941 a range of new, body-style variations of the wide car were introduced to expand the line-up: a station wagon, two panel vans (one called the &quot;Parkway Delivery&quot; had no front cabin roof), and a pick-up truck and &quot;Covered Wagon&quot; model that could convert into a truck by means of a removable back seat and detachable soft-top over the rear section. Crosley built nearly 2,300 cars in 1941. When the company introduced its first metal-topped model, the &quot;Liberty Sedan,&quot; for 1942, pricing across the model range was $299 to $450.

During World War II, the Crosley car became attractive due to gasoline rationing and the car&#x27;s fuel efficiency, an estimated at speeds of up to . Crosley was the last company to cease production of civilian vehicles in 1942, after building another 1,000 units that year. When the onset of war ended all automobile production in the United States in 1942, Crosley had produced a total of 5,757 cars. During the pre-war years the Crosley company operated manufacturing plants in Camp Washington, Ohio; Richmond, Indiana; and Marion, Indiana. The Crosley factories were converted to wartime production during the war.

===War-time production===

The Crosley Corporation was involved in war production planning before December 1941, and like the rest of American industry, it focused on manufacturing war-related products during the war years. The company made a variety of products, ranging from proximity fuzes, radio transceivers, field kitchens, and quarter-ton trailers, to gun turrets, among other items. Powered gun turrets for PT boats and B-24 and B-29 bombers were the company&#x27;s largest contract.

Crosley also produced a number of experimental vehicles during the war for the U.S. government. Crosley&#x27;s auto manufacturing division, CRAD, in Richmond, Indiana, produced experimental motorcycles, tricycles, four-wheel-drive military light utility vehicles, a self-propelled gun, and continuous track vehicles, some of which were amphibious models. All of these military prototypes were powered by the 2-cylinder boxer engine that powered the original Crosley automobiles. Crosley had nearly 5,000 of the engines on hand when auto production ceased in 1942, and hoped to put them to use in war-time production of miniature vehicles.

One vehicle prototype was the 1942–1943 Crosley CT-3 &quot;Pup,&quot; a lightweight, single-passenger, four-wheel-drive vehicle that was transportable and air-droppable from a C-47 Skytrain. Six of the , 2-cylinder Pups were deployed overseas after undergoing tests at Fort Benning, Georgia, but the project was discontinued due to several weak components. Seven of 36 Pups built are known to survive.


===Post-war continuation; notable innovations===
In the post-war period, Crosley introduced several &quot;firsts&quot; in the American automobile industry, including:
* first mass-produced slab-sided / ponton-style car, the model &#x27;CC&#x27;, introduced in 1946, together with the Frazer / Kaiser of the same year.
* first mass-production overhead camshaft engine, the CoBra (for &quot;Copper Brazed&quot;), carried over from military production, also starting in the 1946 model CC,
* first use of the term &#x27;Sport(s-) Utility&#x27; in 1947, for the 1948 model year (albeit for an open model based on the wagon, not a wagon on a truck chassis),
* first American cars to be fitted with 4-wheel caliper type disc brakes, for the 1949 model year only — (the Chrysler Imperial introduced four-wheel disc brakes as standard equipment on Crown Imperials for the 1949 model year, but they were not of the caliper type), and
* first American post-war volume production sports car, the Hotshot, also in the 1949 model year.

In 1950 Crosley brought the Farm-O-Road model, a wheelbase utility vehicle, decades ahead of the John Deere Gator and other small Utility vehicles. From 1950 onwards, Crosley&#x27;s main models gained roll-down instead of sliding side windows.

===Crosmobile===
Crosleys were built under the Crosmobile marque for overseas export. Crosmobiles were simply &quot;badge-engineered&quot; Crosleys, and were identical to standard Crosley models except for having Crosmobile-lettered hood and rear badges and hubcaps and instrument-cluster demarcations. The purpose of differentiating the exported Crosleys was to avoid confusion or conflict with Great Britain&#x27;s non-related Crossley marque. Crosmobiles not only made it to Europe, but also elsewhere, including Cuba.

===Post-war production and demise===
Post-war production began with 4,999 vehicles in 1946, and increased to five-figure numbers, producing more than 22,500 cars in 1947. Crosley sales peaked in 1948, with 24,871 or 27,707 cars sold, depending on the source; however, the CoBra copper and stamped steel &quot;tin block&quot; engine proved a major misstep. Although it had proven reliable in military use, it fared poorly under less diligent civilian maintenance. The CoBra was replaced with a redesigned and more reliable conventional cast-iron engine in 1949, but the company&#x27;s reputation suffered. Sales fell to 8,939 units in 1949, and to 7,612 in 1950. The addition of the Crosley &quot;Hotshot&quot; sports model and the &quot;Farm-O-Road&quot; model, a combination farm-tractor and all-wheel-drive vehicle in 1950, could not stop the decline.

More trouble came after the Big Three automakers introduced bigger, more lavish cars, and began manufacturing them in higher volumes and priced, in some cases, only a little higher than a new Crosley car. Crosley sales dwindled to 4,839 units in 1951; only 1,522 Crosley vehicles were sold in 1952. Production ended on July 3, 1952. Crosley sold about 84,000 cars in total before closing down the operation in 1952. Crosley continued building engines for a short while to fulfill a government contract, but eventually the rights to the engine were sold. The Crosley plant in Marion, Indiana, was sold to the General Tire and Rubber Company.

===Crosley CC Four (1946–1948)===

Crosley resumed civilian car production in 1946 with the largely new model CC, designed by the firm of Sundberg &amp; Ferar of Royal Oak, Michigan. The slightly larger and more aerodynamic model CC featured an all new body and engine. The chassis, suspension, brakes, and the rest of the drive-train were carried over from the pre-war models. Together with the Frazer / Kaiser of the same year, the 1946 Crosley CC was the first American mass-produced slab-sided / ponton-style bodied car. The post-war Crosleys also had a new, water-cooled, straight-four CoBra engine, carried over from military production. Although not much larger in displacement than its predecessor, power output was doubled to , improving the car&#x27;s performance, with a claimed cruising speed of , while fuel economy remained excellent at . Additionally, the CoBra (for &quot;Copper Brazed&quot;) was America&#x27;s first affordable mass-production overhead camshaft car engine, built in five-figure numbers after Duesenberg built some 650 OHC Straight Eights from 1921–1926.

Introduced as a steel roof, two-door, two-box fastback sedan and a fixed profile convertible (with fixed side windows and frames, like the Citroën 2CV and the 2007 Fiat 500), the car also became available as a pick-up – initially with a pickup-box with the same rounded rear-side panels as the sedan (roundside pickup). In late 1947 a station wagon was added, as a 1948 model, as well as a panel van – a derivative of the wagon, but with a different floorpan to yield a flatter floor. The panel delivery also had a side opening rear door, as opposed to the Station wagon&#x27;s above/below split tailgate, while the basic sedan had no outside trunk lid – access to the luggage space was only from inside the car.

From the arrival of the station wagon, the pickups were built with the wagon&#x27;s straight rear panels, giving a wider, more square rear box. In 1948 Crosley added bolt-on grille-bars and a chromed bull-nose to the front for the &#x27;48½ model year, and introduced a new convertible wagon variant without doors, dubbed the &quot;Sports Utility.&quot; The vehicle was advertised with a &quot;quarter-ton&quot; payload capacity for utility use, and its rear seat was optional. The entire range of CC models were based on the same two-door car and frame. The 1948 Station Wagon became the most popular model Crosley built, with 23,489 units made.

A 1947 test of the Crosley sedan and convertible determined that &quot;There is leg room for a man as tall as six feet two or three but due to the over-curve of the top and the window design, he may have to duck to see left or right&quot;, and unless he is narrow-shouldered &quot;he will have to ride these things side saddle or not at all&quot;. Further, the tester felt that the engine lacked bottom-end power, and that the true cruising speed was between — the car will do , and he drove one faster than that, but at these speeds &quot;the little 4-cylinder engine screams like a banshee with the hot-foot&quot; and driving felt quite uncomfortable. Also, the inside door handles were placed too far back, and the two-piece, sliding door windows made it impossible to comfortably drive with one arm out of the window. On the other hand the tester deemed that &#x27;the chassis rides exceptionally well&quot;, &quot;.. undoubtedly the best of the miniature type ever made in this country&quot;.

===Crosley CD Four (1949–1952)===

In 1948 Crosley replaced the CC with the 1949 model year CD. Front and rear bodywork were redesigned on the sedan / coupe and convertible, though rear bodywork on the station wagon and pickup remained largely unaltered. A significant change was fitting the cast-iron block CIBA engine instead of the stamped-steel CoBra engines, that were lighter, but required more maintenance, or else would yield reliability problems.

For 1949 and 50 there were standard and Deluxe models. The &#x27;49 model year still had sliding glass side windows in the doors, but from the 1950 model year, roll-down windows and electric wipers were offered. For 1951 and 1952 the front was again redone; the Deluxe model replaced the standard model as the bottom of the range, and &#x27;Super&#x27; models were introduced as the new top of the line.

The CD models started with the same mechanical brakes as previous Crosleys on the 1949 model, but switched to 4-wheel Goodyear–Hawley aircraft-type disc brakes in May 1949, However, they were short-lived, and only continued through mid 1950. The alloy disc material was found to rust, and had freeze-up problems in parts of the country where salt was used on the roads. So hydraulic brakes were phased back in, and these remained til the end of production.
===Crosley Hotshot===

After building only bottom-end of the market economy cars since its inception, Crosley introduced a little sports car in 1949, the doorless Hotshot roadster. It also featured a largely new, dropped frame – both more low slung, and for the first time with a wheelbase that diverged from all the previous Crosley models&#x27; wheelbase by extra. The rear suspension used a combination of coil springs, assisted by single leaf quarter-elliptical leaf-springs that doubled as torque-rods, and the car had disc brakes on all four wheels. The engine was placed behind the front axle, for a front mid-engined layout. The long Hotshot, introduced for $849, weighed just . But to go racing, the weight was further reducible to , by temporarily discarding such things as the detachable windscreen, and the non-folding (stowed) soft-top and side-curtains. There was no trunk lid — the spare wheel was mounted on the down-sloping rear deck, above the rear bumper, and access to the rear stowage room was by folding the seat-backs forward. Powered by a CIBA engine, the Hotshot was capable of more than .

A Super version of the HotShot was added in 1950, featuring solid hinged doors and a fold-down top that didn&#x27;t have to be stowed, and &quot;full red plastic leather upholstery and lining&quot;. For 1951 and 1952 the Super Hotshot was simply renamed the &quot;Super Sports&quot;.

Regardless of its short life and small size, the Hotshot is remembered as an impressive sports car within its class. A Hotshot won the Sam Collier Memorial Endurance Grand Prix, (averaging ), as well as the &quot;index of performance&quot; — an award which took speed and engine size into account — at the 1950 Six Hours of Sebring; and a Siata 300 fitted with Crosley power won the SCCA&#x27;s 12 hour Vero Beach race.

Throughout the 1950s, Crosley engines dominated 750 cc sports car racing, winning 10 out of 12 SCCA west-coast races alone.

===Crosley Farm-O-Road===

Crosley had produced different products for the war effort, including the &#x27;Pup&#x27; 4x4 prototype, a tiny air-portable 4WD. In 1950, to broaden its line-up into the commercial and agricultural market, the &quot;Farm-O-Road&quot; was introduced – an ATV sized utility vehicle that looked like a small Jeep. It was a combination of a light tractor, a small pickup and a passenger vehicle, and was intended for rural customers who wanted a vehicle for doing chores around the farm, but which could also take them into town. According to Crosley, the Farm-O-Road was designed: “To do big jobs on small farms, and smaller jobs on big farms.” Although it could be viewed as a precursor to today’s &quot;Side by Side&quot; UTV&#x27;s, the Farm-O-Road was fully street-legal, with a top speed estimated at on the highway.

The Farm-O-Road took its cues from the Jeep and the wartime Pup. It had a boxy, minimalist body, riding on a wheelbase, and it weighed . The Farm-O-Road was powered by the same CIBA engine as the other Crosley models at the time, mated to a three-speed Warner T-92 transmission with a two-ratio, PTO-capable range box mounted behind it. In addition to normal gearing, it offered a 4-to-1 low reduction. The base price was $795, or $939 with a hydraulic system including a hydraulically operated drawbar. 

Options included dual rear wheels, a detachable pickup bed which could come with a hydraulic dump, power take-offs on both front and rear, a rear seat, a soft-top, and side window curtains. An extensive range of farm-implement attachments was available, including a single bottom plow, a moldboard plow, snow plow, a cutter-bar mower, sickle-bar mower, three-gang reel-type mower, a rolling coulter, disc harrow, cultivator, hay rake, row crop seeders, fertilizer unit, row guide, velocity governor, hand throttle, radiator chaff screen, post-hole digger, and spring blocks. Crosley even offered steel front snow skis that could be strapped to the front tires to convert the Farm-O-Road into a snowmobile. For the rest, equipment was spartan. Most Farm-O-Roads had only one windshield wiper – a right wiper was optional; and a heater or radio were not offered.

Exact production numbers aren’t known, but historians with the Crosley Automobile Club estimate less than 600 Farm-O-Roads were built. Later, Crofton Marine Engineering bought the rights and tooling for the rig and put it back into production from ’59-’63 as the &quot;Crofton Bug&quot;, resulting in another ~250 units. The Farm-O-Road measured long (without the optional, detachable bed) by wide (excluding the side-mounted spare wheel), and high (with the windshield and top up), and offered a payload. Axles were rigid front and rear – as on all other Crosleys – with a 5.38:1 ratio Spicer 23 in the rear.

The little 1950 vehicle was also compared with the 1959/1960 M422 Mighty Mite, the U.S. military&#x27;s smallest jeep, originally with a wheelbase.
==Engines==
===Waukesha Model 150 Cub Twin===
The original engine is the Waukesha Model 150 Cub Twin, a or air-cooled L-head opposed twin-cylinder engine, putting out at 3,200 rpm, built by Waukesha Engines of Waukesha, Wisconsin, and used from 1939 through 1942. The engine was originally designed to power orchard sprayers. However, many of the over 12,000 built between 1938–44, were used in the pre-war (1939–42) Crosley mini-cars and the military during WWII, some of which were also used for Auxiliary Power Units (APU).

It was replaced in 1946 with the CoBra (for &quot;Copper Brazed&quot;), a overhead-cam four with a bore and stroke. That engine in turn was replaced in 1949 by the new and more reliable CIBA (Crosley Cast Iron Block Assembly) engine utilizing five main bearings.

===Crosley CoBra (1946–1949)===
The CoBra (Copper Brazed, also known as &quot;The Mighty Tin&quot;) was originally developed by Lloyd Taylor, of Taylor Engines in California, for military use aboard PT boats and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers. The engine was made from sheet metal rather than cast iron like most other engines. This was done to get a thin, uniform wall thickness and thus avoid the creation of hot spots around the combustion chamber that could ignite the fuel, causing pre-ignition (knocks), which in turn limited the compression ratio. These engines were used mainly to power generators, refrigeration compressors, etc., and were widely praised for their successes in the war effort.

The engine was adopted for automobile use in 1946. It was a small, lightweight engine with single overhead camshaft driven by two sets of bevel gears and a vertical shaft at the front of the block. It was America&#x27;s first overhead camshaft automobile engine to be produced in five-figure numbers, after Duesenberg built some 650 overhead cam Straight Eights from 1921–1926. The unitary block and cylinder head weighed only dry; complete with all accessories (including the flywheel) weighing only . The engine displaced and produced at 5,400 rpm and at 1,200 rpm. Because of its remarkable power to weight ratio, and super efficiency for its time, the CoBra engine has been compared to Ford&#x27;s 1.0 litre inline-3 EcoBoost engine. Longevity was measured in hours and was strictly controlled by equipment maintenance schedules for the wartime duties, but corrosion became a problem for these engines in civilian service. This problem with these automotive powerplants had tarnished Crosley&#x27;s reputation by 1948.

===Crosley CIBA (1949–1952; 1955)===

The Crosley CIBA (Cast Iron Block Assembly) was a more traditional and more reliable engine utilizing a cast-iron block. Nevertheless it had a unique design. Instead of a removable cylinder head, the combustion chambers, valve seats, cam supports, ports and cylinders are one casting, and the crankcase is another. In both the early and later cast-iron engines, the crankcase is aluminum. The engine produced at 5,400 rpm and at 3,000 rpm.

When Crosley Motors, Inc. was sold, the engine was renamed &quot;AeroJet&quot; and production continued. Production of the AeroJet ended in 1955 and the engine rights were sold to Fageol and later to a series of different companies ending in 1972 with the Fisher-Pierce Bearcat 55. Maritime modifications mostly included increasing displacement and converting the engine to operate with a vertical axis.

In Europe the Crosley CIBA would be used to great advantage in 750cc sports car class, eventually maturing to a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) design used in the Bandini 750 sport internazionale as well as Nardi 750LM and Siata Amica.

<text>Petrosaviaceae is a family of flowering plants belonging to a monotypic order, Petrosaviales. Petrosaviales are monocots, and are grouped within the lilioid monocots. Petrosaviales is a very small order composed of one family, two genera and four species accepted in 2016. Some species are photosynthetic (&quot;Japonolirion&quot;) and others are rare, leafless, chlorophyllous, mycoheterotrophic plants (&quot;Petrosavia&quot;). The family is found in low-light montane rainforests in Japan, China, Southeast Asia and Borneo. They are characterised by having bracteate racemes, pedicellate flowers, six persistent tepals, septal nectaries, three almost-distinct carpels, simultaneous microsporogenesis, monosulcate pollen, and follicular fruit.

==Taxonomy==
The family has only been recognized in modern classifications; previously, the family members were typically treated as belonging to the Liliaceae. The APG II system recognized the family and assigned it to the clade monocots, unplaced as to order. The APG III system of 2009 and the APG IV system of 2016 placed the family Petrosaviaceae in the order Petrosaviales.

===Genera===
, two genera are accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families:
* &quot;Japonolirion&quot; , with one species
* &quot;Petrosavia&quot; , with three species

==Distribution and habitat==
The plant species in both genera are found in high-elevation habitats.

<doc id="601871" wikidata="Q486670" url="?curid=601871" title="Ebeye Island">
<text>Ebeye ( ; Marshallese: &#x27;, or &#x27; in older orthography, ; locally, , , after the English pronunciation) is the populous island of Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, and the second most populated in the Marshall Islands. It is a center for Marshallese culture in the Ralik Chain of the archipelago. Settled on of land, it 2021 it had a population of 8,416. Over 50% of the population is estimated to be under the age of 18.

Ebeye is home to the RMI Emergency Operations Center and other facilities, including schools, health facilities, stores, and hotel, along with residential structures. It has some docks but no airstrip, but is connected by causeway to Loi, Shell, and Gugeegue islands to the north.

==History==
Ebeye was an island of the Marshalese people, it was annexed in 1885 by the German Empire. In 1914 it became a mandate of the Empire of Japan. In 1944 it was captured by the United States during WW2, after Japan attacked the USA. After WW2, it was part of U.N. protectorate administered by the USA until 1979. The Marshall Islands maintains a compact of free association with United States to the present day. Ebeye is popular location for those employed at the military base to the south, which coordinates many logistical and aid programs for the island. Ebeye was connected by causeway in 1992 to the islands to North of it, so is physically now connected to Loi, Shell and Gugeegue islands.

Aid projects have increased programs for schools, medical, water, and sewage though concerns of about over-topping waves has led to a seawall project in the 2020s.

===Etymology===
When Christian missionaries first arrived in the Marshall Islands, they introduced Latin script writing and orthographized the Marshallese language. Originally, Ebeye was written &quot;Ebeje&quot; by Europeans (&#x27; in modern orthography, pronounced ), which (according to elders of the atoll) means &quot;making something out of nothing.&quot; However, the colonial German administration mispronounced the J as if it were German language , and foreign observers recorded the resulting pronunciation as &quot;Ebeye&quot;. During the Japanese period, though, the island&#x27;s pronunciation in katakana, , re-approximated Marshallese. After World War II, the Americans took possession of the regional mandate from Japan and mispronounced the island&#x27;s name as from its spelling. Because most of the modern Marshallese residents of Ebeye don&#x27;t have family roots on the island, the American pronunciation has stuck, and is the usual name for Ebeye among the island&#x27;s current population. This pronunciation has even been adapted to Marshallese orthography, so that there are now two synonymous Marshallese names for the island officially and historically &#x27;, and locally &quot;&quot;.

It was also called Burton Island by the USA, in what was called the Carillon atoll.

===World War II===

The Imperial Japanese Navy constructed a seaplane base on Ebeye in the early 1940s. Following the Battle of Kwajalein from 31 January to 3 February 1944, Ebeye was occupied by US forces. On 7 March the 107th Naval Construction Battalion was sent to Ebeye to redevelop the seaplane base. The Seabees repaired the existing pier, adding a ell extension, and also repaired a Japanese H-shaped pier. The Seabees assembled a pontoon wharf and pontoon barges for transporting damaged carrier aircraft to repair units ashore. Further installations on Ebeye consisted of housing in floored tents and Quonset huts, a 150-bed dispensary, four magazines, of covered storage, and a aviation-gasoline tank farm.

===Emigration from the Mid-Atoll Corridor===
Before the early 1950s, a large number of present-day residents of Ebeye lived on small islands throughout Kwajalein Atoll. When Kwajalein island started to be used as a support base for the nuclear tests conducted at Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll, Marshallese residents of Kwajalein were relocated by U.S. authorities to a small, planned community constructed on Ebeye, which was largely unpopulated and had served as a Japanese seaplane base before the Pacific War.

In 1950, the US Navy constructed a LORAN station on Ebeye. It was disestablished in 1977.

With the advent of the Nike-Zeus anti-ballistic missile testing program of the 1960s, the U.S. military decided for safety and security reasons to evacuate slightly more than 100 residents of the central part of the atoll to create a zone where unarmed guided missiles could be targeted from the continental United States.

Subsequent population growth by migration from outlying rural atolls and islands throughout the Marshalls created a housing shortage and problems with resources throughout the following decades. Some of the original Ebeye inhabitants with land rights did not feel adequately compensated for the tenants who came to live on their land even though their paramount chief had worked with the Trust Territory to move them there.

=== 21st century ===

In 2010, 40,000 gallons of water had to be shipped to Ebeye when its water plant failed.

A new Emergency Operations Center for the RMI was opened in 2024 on Ebeye. The new 2-story building houses offices to coordinate disaster relief through out the RMI. 

In early 2024, the Marshal Islands were experiencing three months of drought, and in response international aid organization mobilized to bring some relief, such as extra water storage tanks.

In 2024, a plan was announced to build a protective seawall at Ebeye, to reduce erosion and help prevent inundation from waves that over top the island. The Marshall Islands periodically have issues with overtopping waves, which can damage infrastructure, cause injuries, and render ground water undrinkable.

There is also a plan in the late 2010s and 2020s to modernize waste management. Currently there is a large dump at the north end of Ebeye.

==Geography==

Ebeye is the most populous island of Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, as well as the center for Marshallese culture in the Ralik Chain of the archipelago. It comprises .

Kwajalein is one of the largest coral atolls in the world, consisting of 97 main islands, of which Ebeye is one. However, they are only about 2 meters/yards or 6 feet above sea level on average.

Ebeye is about half way between Australia and the Hawaiian islands.

A road goes north to Loi, Shell, and Gugeegue atolls on causeways; it stops at Nene. Then there is Bigej channel and to the north is Bigej Island. The causeway connecting Ebeye to South and North Loi, Little Shell, Big Shell, and Gugeegue islands was completed in 1992. To the south is the main Kwajalein atoll island which has the airport and military base.

===Climate===
==Demographics==

Ebeye has a population of more than 15,000 (2011 est). In 2008, the population was 12,000. In 1968, the population was 3,000.

9,789 people lived on the Kwajalein including Ebeye in the 2021 census, 

This is the second most populous island of the Marshall Islands, with Majuro being larger at about 25 thousand, as of the 2020s. These are much greater than the next populated islands at this time including Arno (~2 thousand), Jabor (~1200), and Wotje (~900).

Ebeye is famed for being one of the most densely populated small islands on Earth. It is the sixth most densely populated island in the world as of the early 21st century.

===Refuge from nuclear fallout===
Some of the residents of Ebeye are refugees or descendants of refugees from the effects of the 15- Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll on 1 March 1954. The detonation unexpectedly rained nuclear fallout and two inches (50 mm) of radioactive snow on nearby Rongelap Atoll, which had not been evacuated as had Bikini. The 1954 American authorities then evacuated Rongelap and were returned in 1957 with extensive medical surveillance. In 1985, Greenpeace evacuated the inhabitants of Rongelap to Mejato (island in Kwajalein atoll). Ebeye was the final destination for many of them.

===Health===
Infant mortality on Ebeye is 3.0% . There have been recurrent outbreaks of cholera, dengue fever, and tuberculosis. In 1963 there was a polio outbreak, and in 1978 a measles outbreak. In 2009, the Ebeye Community Health Center was awarded a grant as part of the United States Stimulus for monitoring influenza (e.g. H1N1).

=== Potable water ===
Potable water for the population comes from a water purification system, and a rain-water catchment. In an emergency water has been shipped from the nearby military base to the south. In the late 2010s the USA and Australia cooperated on a plan to increase the amount of potable water, increase its purity, and also improve the sewage system.

==Economy==

The Marshall Islands subsists primarily upon foreign aid and lease payments from the United States for the military use of Kwajalein Atoll. The United States provides $1.5 billion in aid under the Compact of Free Association, spread out over the 20 years of the agreement, which expires in 2023. It was renewed for another 20 years after that by the RMI. Apart from this, handicrafts are produced and there is a small fishery. Some larger projects are funded through international aid organizations such as Red Cross or the U.N..
